5277504,2,B009904NLY,"Oh Dr. Lisa, just shut the heck up for 2 seconds.  I actually enjoy the workout, but I have to put it on mute to make it through the whole thing without yelling at the TV.  Dr. Lisa yammering on and on, repeating herself about how this is such a great move, and you can do it anywhere, even at your desk, and it'll make you live longer and not need plastic surgery.  We get it already, shut up!  And that part about plastic surgery really bothered me.  I guess she just assumes that everyone thinks that way?  And she says it numerous times throughout the video too.  Really annoying and almost offensive.  For all her chattering, she contributes absolutely nothing to the video.  (She doesn't even do the moves right!)  But anyway, my point is this: do yourself a favor and turn the sound down first!  The moves are easy enough to follow just by watching.  It's an enjoyable, simple, low-impact, beginner/out-of-shape workout that's very easy to fit into my morning routine, and for that I like it.  The instructor knows what she's doing and demonstrates well, though maybe goes through the move a few too many times before doing them at normal speed, but you can adjust that yourself.",1361318400,,1186,4.563981042654029
5277505,2,B009904NLY,"I don't know what to think about this workout, I found it low key and not at all a yoga blast as described...What irritated me the most is that Dr. Lisa's form throught the dvd was horrible almost like she had never done any of this before but yet the whole dvd is loaded with constant chatter between the two about the benefits of moving and exercise..I mean after the first 20 minutes of hearing it constantly between the two, I was saying ALRIGHT ALREADY! I get it, move your butt...it got old after awhile..

Dr. Lisa didn't look like she was interested in doing any of the moves and that she did them half heartedly, I did like the instructor but found this lacking in the cardio & something that would be good for an absolute beginner...

Not sure I would discourage someone from buying it & not sure if I would recommend it to buy...",1359676800,,840,4.343949044585988
5277506,5,B009904NLY,"I have to say that I am a big Denise Austin workout fan, but I liked this even better! I like that it switches up from yoga to dance and that it also lets me know what benefits I am actually getting medically from the workout...that keeps me going!  If you are a marathoner or a yoga expert, yes this might be not as complex as you want. but if you are like me and trying to drop some pounds and have fun this is absolutely perfect!",1357776000,,432,3.9655172413793105
5277507,3,B009904NLY,"I thought this was a pretty decent yoga fitness dvd especially for beginners. It is a little bit over an hour and the different segments focuses on stretching, strength exercises and some dance moves. I got what I needed out of this and was satisfied.",1368576000,,251,4.6
5277508,3,B009904NLY,"After having 3 babies within 4 1/2 years, I decided it was time to do a bit of damage control! I thought this looked like something quick and effective, so I wanted to give it a try.

Unfortunately, it's not really for me. I think I prefer more of a ""Tae-Bo"" kind of workout. I'm out of shape, so I'm looking around at different types of workouts to find the one that fits my tastes the best. This isn't it! I also didn't realize this was the Doctor off of the Doctor show(which I've only seen little pieces of before) when I got it. In an attempt to put it nicely, I don't really connect with her. :S

These are short sessions. If that's what you need and you like Dr. Lisa, and you aren't looking for hard-core yoga, give these a try.",1368576000,,736,4.13986013986014
5277509,2,B009904NLY,"I have absolutely NO idea who Dr. Lisa is. I didn't get it because of her, nor do I watch whatever show she is on. I liked the idea of the Yoga blast workout. Unfortunately, I did not like the DVD itself.

First of all - this isn't really about yoga. Sure, there are a few moves sprinkled here and there, but it's not truly a yoga workout.

Second - If you aren't familiar with the yoga moves performed, watch out. There is very little instruction regarding good form or alternate moves for those not ready for the full thing. Not very safe, particularly for those who may just be getting started with an exercise program (which the ""yoga"" and ""20-minute"" parts would should have been perfect for). This goes really for ALL moves, not just the yoga-based ones.

Third - Dr. Lisa (for whom the DVD is named) seemed fairly clueless at times about what was going on. She was like those people in an exercise class that you can spot a mile away, who are there for the first time and trying to fake it. I would sincerely not mind that, except for the fact that her name shouldn't be on the title of the video. The impression given by the cover is that she is, if not teaching, then at least helping to lead or show alternate moves or *something*. In reality - notsomuch.

Third - TOO. MUCH. BABBLE.

This DVD, quite honestly, take the worst things about the old 80's ""exercise"" videos, puts them all together, and releases it out into the wild. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, unless you can borrow it first and see if you really like it.",1368316800,,1538,4.363636363636363
5277510,4,B009904NLY,"This is a three-program set of exercises that are loosely based on yoga moves.  It's certainly not an ""official"" yoga style video, but it still gets good ratings from me as a nice, basic program.  Each one is 20-35 minutes, and there's strength conditioning, cardio, and stretching.

My favorite is the stretching.  Good instructions mean you can do them without your eyes glued on the tv...you can just listen.  Dr. Lisa has a soft manner: no hostile shouting or impatience like Jillian Michaels' videos.  Just a pleasant demeanor that wouldn't get irritating after several viewings.  The range of the videos gives a good assortment to plan an exercise regimen that wouldn't get dull.

On the down side, there's not a lot of challenge if you want something particularly tough.  You could amp the cardio up on your own if you wish, with more reps, etc....but all in all, this is a good beginner dvd.",1367452800,,899,4.785714285714286
5277511,4,B009904NLY,"Dr. Lisa Masterson from the show 'The Doctors' and health instructor Elise Joan have combined cardio dance moves, strength and stretch exercises to create a DVD that is easy to use for beginners, such as myself. After having two children in the last five years, I was looking for a workout that would help tone my body, but would also be fun to do. At 5'7 and 130 lbs. I'm not overweight, but I definitely need to tone and tighten my whole body. This regimen is broken down in three 20 minute workouts that I do early in the morning before my children wake up. What a difference this has made with my energy levels and it really kick starts my whole day.  After using this DVD four times a week for two months (combined with powerwalking and stairstepping) the overall tone of my body has improved. As other reviewers have stated, Dr. Lisa can be overly chatty at times, but I overlook it and focus on the workout. Overall, I do recommend this DVD.",1367280000,,948,4.417142857142857
5277512,4,B009904NLY,"Dr. Lisa Yoga Blast is a great home workout for anyone that is too busy to get over the gym. It has cardio, strength, and power stretch routines, all of them right around 20 minutes long. There is also the option to play all three for a total workout of 63 minutes. If that's too long for you, the video plays fine at 1.2 times speed and the workout is still doable, just a little faster. Dr. Lisa's assistant leads each segment with comments from Dr. Lisa to help explain the benefits of the moves.

The cardio portion is like any aerobics or cardio class I've taken over the years with stretching and stepping to elevate the heart rate. The strength workout uses a chair for support some of the time and most of the routine focuses on core strengthening exercises with some good leg exercises too. The power stretch is a nice yoga workout, although much shorter than what you'd do at a yoga class. At the end of it though, I do feel very relaxed.

Dr. Lisa mentions more than once about how exercise boosts your immune system and helps fight colds. It's an important point to make, but I only need to hear it once, particularly if I'm using this workout a few times a week. Now, I usually use the mute volume button or play music since I've heard the dialog so often. Dr. Lisa also makes a comment about how you don't need a facelift if you have a healthy lifestyle, but it looks to me that she has had some work done. It could just be the heavy make up for the cameras, but the comment comes off as hypocritical. Even so, it's not a distraction from the benefits of the workout.

There are other features worth mentioning on this DVD. There is a very brief introduction that should be watched the first time through the disc. The bonus features include biographies of both Dr. Lisa and her assistant as well as some additional workouts - a barre routine using a chair and kettlebell workouts for beginners. Both of these are about nine or ten minutes long and led by trainers trying to sell their own exercise videos on the subjects. I don't have kettlebells, but the barre workout is a nice bonus for me to get in a different or more varied exercise routine.

Overall, I feel like this video is a wonderful opportunity to get in a workout whenever it's not convenient to get to a class or go to the gym. I'm not familiar with Dr. Lisa Masterson from TV, but the case says she's a practicing physician and on a show called The Doctors. She certainly seems to know what she's talking about and she looks like she maintains a healthy lifestyle herself. I'm quite happy to use this DVD as part my home workout.",1367280000,,2610,4.375257731958763
5277513,3,B009904NLY,"I was expecting each 20 minute segment to be yoga, but only one is yoga. One is cardio and one is strength training. The yoga segment was good. I like that Dr Lisa is not quite as flexable as her instructor, so she shows some variation of the yoga moves.",1366588800,,254,4.1
5277514,5,B009904NLY,"Dr. LIsa is amazing with her workout dvd. When I got it I thought I was not going to break out in a sweat, but she really gets a good workout in and helps you stretch in the process. She knows her stuff!",1366329600,,203,3.744186046511628
5277515,1,B009904NLY,"Everything about this ""yoga"" video is horrible.  The instructors are not synchronized and carry on an inane conversation with each other, saying things like, ""Exercise is a natural face lift!"" and ""You're giving a one-two punch for cholesterol!""  Exercise instructors need to instruct, not chatter.  It is really annoying and something I see in workout DVDs way too much.  The brunette instructor honestly seems drunk.  She does not do the moves correctly, says the weirdest things, and looks like she is about to topple over at any second.

I cannot understand why this is called a yoga DVD.  Did the seemingly drunk brunette instructor come up with the title?  There are three workout sections--cardio, strength, and power stretch--totaling 63 minutes.  The cardio section consists of lots of flailing, the strength section is more flailing with some wiggling added in, and the power stretch section is the closest you get to some very imprecise and ungraceful yoga.  Yoga moves should be slow and controlled, not sloppy.

This was a very disappointing DVD.  I would most definitely not recommend it.  I love yoga and have gone through lots of DVDs to find a workout I like, and I still prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/YOGA-FOR-INDIE-ROCKERS/dp/B000V6LT0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">YOGA FOR INDIE ROCKERS</a>.  The instructor does not ramble and has a nice voice (which is rare in a workout video); there are three levels of difficulty, so you can work your way up; the moves are done well and not sloppy; and if you don't like the music, you have the option to turn it off and play your own.  It's low-budget, but a lot better than this mess of a ""yoga"" DVD.",1365811200,3,1712,5.197080291970803
5277516,1,B009904NLY,"I recently had a baby and was looking forward to getting back in shape. Three short workouts seemed like it would be great because I don't have a whole lot of time. I have seen The Doctors show a few times but mainly ordered this because it was yoga based. I didn't expect it to be hard core yoga, I expected a few non yoga moves, but this video is ridiculous. Almost the entire thing is non yoga. I don't really like dance videos much, and that's what this video should have been called. I thought the moves were rather boring and the cueing was not great. Not to mention Dr Lisa does not ever stop talking.

I am very disappointed and will not be doing this video again.",1365638400,,672,4.209302325581396
5277517,2,B009904NLY,"It's taken me a lot longer to review this than I normally take. I guess I didn't want to be mean to the ever-perky Dr. Lisa. Still, here goes.

Poorly named to start with, this product is not what I expected. I guess want my yoga more ""Lilias"" than ""Lisa.""

I found this to be very entertaining to watch but a bit more frenetic to try to do. Yoga is enough of a workout for me. I don't want dancing and pilates and whatever else got tossed into this mix.

Had it been named Energy Blast, I might have had a different reaction. But this is no yoga blast at all. Wouldn't look for another product by this company given this misleading product.",1365379200,,641,4.195121951219512
5277518,3,B009904NLY,"I was at something of a loss for roughly the first 2/3rds of this vid.  It's entitled ""Yoga Blast"" but I wasn't seeing the yoga.  I was seeing a lot of dancing for sure, which is almost the exact opposite of yoga.  Finally, though, the power stretching stuff in the final segment introduced yoga poses.  I'm not going to go into the different uses of yoga; everyone has their own opinion of it.  This is strictly yoga for toning and stretching.  In spite of Dr Lisa's contention that this is mediation, it's not.

Which brings me to Dr. Lisa.  She never shuts up.  Throughout the whole video she yammers on about oooh doesn't that feel good? and We're preventing breast cancer by doing these moves, and a lot of other blather that over-simplifies the connection between movement and health.  I think her point might better have been served by letting the instructor instruct, and talking about the link between exercise and both physical and emotional health in a separate segment.  It'd be less distracting and you'd only have to listen to it once to get the info.  Dr. Lisa, by the way, is a Gynecologist.  She doesn't appear to have any special sports or fitness-related medical knowledge.

As for the exercises themselves, they're decent enough.  I cringed a little whenever a move was touted as ""sexy"" or was implied to be something that will improve your bedroom performance.  Again, it's all part of the distracting quality of the chatter.  It didn't make me feel like I wanted to work out, it made me feel like I was in a workout class with women who talked so much I wasn't getting the instructions.

There are some extras on the DVD, excerpts from a ballet-style workout and a kettlebell workout.  Basically adverts for more vids from this company.

I think there are far better workouts on the market, and many better yoga vids you can choose from.",1365379200,2,1859,4.661538461538462
5277519,3,B009904NLY,"Dr. Lisa Masterson has designed ""three efficient workouts to fit any busy lifestyle.""  These are Yoga-based workouts, however, there are several moves that are derived from ballet and even hip-hop.  The title, ""Yoga Blast,"" is somewhat of a misnomer in that regard.  There are moves, or blasts, which take off from some yoga moves.  For example, the Peaceful Warrior move is used almost in a freestyle manner, or blast during the cardio portion.  The three workouts are:

*  Cardio (21 minutes)

*  Strength (22 minutes)

*  Power Stretch (20 minutes)

The workouts, which are ""all about conditioning and having fun,"" will do just that if you stick with them.  Elise Joan, Dr. Masterson's trainer, is superb and moves right along with her instruction, demonstrating via her body the proper way to move.  There is no delineation of each move, but there is a some scattered commentary from Dr. Masterson about the purpose.  For example, when performing one exercise to strengthen the hips, she claims that it's ""going to help you in so many ways, not just in the bedroom.""  Seriously?

Elise Joan is definitely worth watching as she's a pro and her method of explaining what she is doing is spot on.  The added commentary from Dr. Masterson was quite distracting and took the fun out of the workouts.  These are loosely yoga-based, but definitely not fully.  These are doable workouts, but I didn't find them inspirational.  Whenever anyone sees a Zumba workout they want in.  This one ... sorry to say, I wanted out because the added dialogue was just too much.",1365379200,,1560,4.85171102661597
5277520,4,B009904NLY,"After having my baby I started into the Sparkpeople bootcamp... doing their easy 10 minute workouts with some additional cardio of my own during the week; tracking my calories and losing weight.  But at some point I built up and found the workouts easy. This dvd is PERFECT for the next level.  It was a bit challenging and exposed me to even more general workout moves that allowed me to eventually go up to Turbofire and REALLY get in shape.  So I definitely recommend it to those who have started out in very easy workouts and need a level up; but find many of the typical workout programs to be too much.  I also used it after I got pregnant again and found the Turbofire ones impossible as I got further along.  It doesn't kill you but you do get a good workout done!

Also, it's great time-wise.  After doing Turbofire and getting fatigued with all the time needed (hey, I'm an ultra busy mom with 8 kids... who has an hour each evening?!), it was nice to have this program to fall back on in case I didn't have all the time in the world to workout that evening after the kids were in bed.  It's about 20 minutes per session, and there are 3 sessions on the dvd.  So this again, makes it a perfect step up from the Sparkpeople bootcamp... just a little extra time each day.

My complain about it is that it's advertising it as a Dr. Lisa workout but she's not the trainer, she's basically the participant.  Also, it's nothing fancy or interesting and it's NOT all yoga.  It's a wide range of various workout moves and has one section that is yoga.  I don't have an issue with any of this because it was perfect for what I needed; but I could see how some would be irritated that it's not exactly what they are describing it. So the misleading title and description caused me to take off one star.",1365379200,2,1802,4.311572700296736
5277521,3,B009904NLY,"This is a nice mix of yoga, pilates and dance for the average person. There are 3 20 minute routines and the instructor has nice form and is pleasant to listen to. Dr. Lisa did keep up a constant bauble that was annoying at times. I am not worried about my hip moves in the bedroom nor plastic surgery, when I exercise it is for my health only.  After I got used to the routine I would mute the sound,and listen to music... that is just my personal choice.  I have neck and issues so thee were times I did adjust the exercises to my ability.

If you are looking for a new routine with a nice a mix of movements, this is for you.",1365120000,,628,4.008
5277522,4,B009904NLY,"I think the title of this DVD should have said Exercise routines with some yoga mixed in for variety. Now that is not a bad thing mind you. If you are looking for a yoga DVD that is only yoga, i can recommend some good ones for you. If you are look for a routine with a nice variety of things to do to exercise, you will like this DVD.",1365120000,,335,3.8
5277523,3,B009904NLY,"I like that this is broken down into three different segments you can attack depending on what you feel like doing that day. But it's like walking into a class for the first time that started without you and has been working together for a few weeks. So everyone else knows what's going on and doesn't need any instruction, because there is very little given. These instructions are usually for doing a harder version of the pose. It will make you sweat but it will also give you whiplash trying to see the tv in awkward poses so that you can see what the heck the instructors are doing now.

This just goes way too fast with too little instruction. I do like that there are harder and easier poses, but it's kind of a pain to learn so you tend to edge away from doing it and find something else to do.",1365120000,,802,4.241830065359477
5277524,1,B009904NLY,"The three workouts on this DVD aren't a blast and certainly aren't yoga.  Instead, there are some pretty standard aerobic dance moves, some pretty poor form, incessant chatter (but no real instruction) and a lot of Dr. Lisa's cleavage on display.  I'd say this is nothing but an amateurish vanity project.",1365033600,,305,4.96078431372549
5277525,3,B009904NLY,"I was mislead by the title ""Yoga Blast"" when it came to this DVD.  Very soon into it I realized ""yoga blast"" referred to a yoga infusion into an otherwise energetic workout.  So this really isn't yoga, but I thought ""all right, it's still a workout"".

And it is a workout.  And it's fun.  I rather enjoyed the three programs for what they were.  However, that's all that's really offered here besides the adorableness of Dr. Lisa and her trainer.  The good is that these exercises, even the stretch program, were rather energetic.  Work gets done.  It's all low-impact, which is a bonus for those not wanting too much struggle.  I trust these women know what they are talking about and demonstrating.  But even accepting the exercises, this remained a rather ""eh"" DVD for me.

My complaints:  I feel very little is properly discussed, which is saying something as both women talk incessantly.  A good workout DVD should be as good a substitute for a teacher as possible.  While these women vaguely mentioned what they were doing, I felt I was relying almost entirely on sight when I prefer the instructor to specifically describe what I ought to be doing with my body.  The lessons move rather fast, which isn't a bad thing by itself--but I can't help but feel lost as I'm still wondering if I moved right.  If you're going to talk so much, make it useful.

The other criticism (I can't call it a complaint as I overall enjoyed the workouts) is this program really doesn't seem to know what it wants to do.  Beyond the ""yoga infusion"" I don't know if this is ballet, dance... I""m guessing it's just general movement.  So... fun stuff to do, but it seems most consumers are looking for something specific.

Exercise-wise, this DVD is fine.  But its identity crisis and lack of proper instruction is going to leave it struggling to be noticed and remembered.",1365033600,2,1856,4.6461538461538465
5277526,1,B009904NLY,"Well, I love Dr Lisa. She is just the most adorable thing, and she is so sweet on The Doctors or whatever that show is named. She's just as perky and cute in this video. That's the only thing positive I can say about it. I think they came up with the title first. Pick a popular, low-key, healthy sounding thing like YOGA and then add a word that sounds like it's going to be super fast and fun..BLAST! Then make a video that was nothing but a dance video. Lots of aerobics, no real yoga to speak of. Too hard core for me and too dance-y.",1365033600,3,538,4.037383177570093
5277527,2,B009904NLY,"The title, Yoga Blast, is misleading.  If I were to title this workout, I might call it Low Impact and Interval Training Aerobics.  There are a few yoga postures like downward dog that are used as transitional movements to more traditional low impact, dance, or straight out exercise movements.

Dr. Lisa is a poor example of form as well.  I found her movements awkward, uncoordinated and when she was talking at the same time she was out of sync with the trainer.

If you're interested in Low Impact and Interval Training with some floorwork, I'd suggest any of Leslie Sansonne's DVD'S over this.  I've done Leslie's low impact aerobics for many years and enjoyed them.  If you're interested in yoga, I'm a big fan of Paul Grilley's Yin Yoga DVD as well as Seane Corne's DVD.

Having said this, the good part about this DVD is that it has 3 short workouts.  If you're okay with chatty talk during your workouts and like to get something done quick without paying too much attention to form, this may work for you.",1364515200,2,1015,4.594444444444444
5277528,3,B009904NLY,"Elise Joan does a couple of interesting things during this video.  I'm all for no wasted time and she combines a couple of yoga moves so that you don't have the downtime between them.  Uhm, I guess that was one interesting thing.

Elise is an inexperienced dance instructor: There are no verbal cues - she just starts something new and tells you, ""Doesn't it feel good?"" She is also likely to put in a new hip-hop move and start counting it in without telling anyone.

Hip hop? Ballet?  Hip circles?  This could be a useful warm up tape.  Some of these moves could be useful for loosening up -- other people, at least.  The guys at my gym would really laugh at me doing any of these moves.  Then they would do these really big sighs and ask who I have been watching now.

Dr. Lisa talks CONSTANTLY.  There is no silent space. Or as Dr. Lisa puts it ""Love the Yoga!"" or ""Love it!""  I'd also like a list of all the promises she makes during this video - no colorectal cancer, no facelift, and no plastic surgery.  What kind of medical degree is that?  Sometimes Dr. Lisa watches so intently she misses steps.  It was really LOL funny to watch Dr. Lisa miss the moves. Then call out WOOO or LOVE IT!  She should not wear fuschia shoes if she doesn't know the moves.

For some reason my hot yoga instructor shut down for a month so I have been looking for a not-ooohm-ooohm replacement.  This one goes all the way to the other end.  It involves very little yoga.

While this video had its own sense of entertainment sometimes, I think my heart rate went up from sheer annoyance of listening to Dr. Lisa babble incessantly.  This is not likely one I will replay.",1364256000,2,1657,4.3322475570032575
5277529,4,B009904NLY,"I cycle, walk, and use the weights. I thought I'd add some Yoga into the routine. While the explanations were easy to understand it was the background noise that got to me. Yoga should be a peaceful enterprise while stretching and strengthening the body.

While I did learn some moves, I was annoyed by the constant chatter, telling the hows, the whys, and the ways, I could avoid plastic surgery and look great. So, I'm giving Yoga Blast a 4 for the new information and taking one star off for the noise.",1364169600,,505,4.489130434782608
5277530,1,B009904NLY,"First let me say that the color on this DVD is terrible.  Dr. Lisa says in her intro, that you will crave this workout more than candy.  Both practioners look as green as the ferns in the background.  All I could keep thinking was I have a craving for broccoli.  My biggest qualm with this DVD is that it is called ""Dr. Lisa Yoga Blast"", but she looks more like an awkward student then an instructor.  If you are going to put your name and face on the DVD, you ought to have a certain mastery of the workout and flexibility.  Throughout the workout Dr. Lisa glances to the instructor as if to see what the form is, etc.  Dr. Lisa's movement is awkward, clumsy, and wobbly at times.  Again, I would have no problem with this if she was not marketing this as ""her"" DVD.  The instructor, Elise Joan does know what she is doing and practices proper yoga form.  Dr. Lisa's constant chatter throughout the DVD is also annoying and superfluous.  I don't need to hear that you can do this at your desk, over, and over, and over again.  It also seem like she was trying to interject medical knowledge, but not really helpful knowledge like ""regulating breathing helps your heart rate and blood pressure"".  OK...""and this helps prevent diseases, regulates, blood flow"", etc.  Again, I have no problems with sharing this information, but it could be shared just as easily during the introduction to the DVD rather than incessantly throughout the workout resulting in superfluous chatter.

These three 20 minute sections seem like they are meant to be done separately, rather than all together.  They all seem to have sun salutations and the third section (Power Stretch), I believe is a cut and paste from the second (Strength, which is really yoga as well).

The CARDIO section is ""meh"".  Nothing special.  A lot of side to side movements with knee lifts.  The Hip Hop moves are fun and have several slow repetitions before speeding up.  Dr. Lisa looked awkward like she was constantly looking at the instructor.  The yoga poses were really there for cardio and strength.  There was not a lot of focus on breadth or alignment in this section.  I would have really appreciated more focus on these given the title.

The STRENGTH section is really yoga, sun salutations with little cueing.  Dr. Lisa talks about how breathing helps with medical conditions, but never really talks about how to use yogic breadth within the pose.  I really was feeling I preferred Dr. Lisa not to be there and just the instructor.  I did not feel she added any value other than being a talking student going on and on about health benefits of yoga.  Her flexibility was poor, form awkward, and she seemed wobbly at times.  Her pigeon pose form was not good at all.  I have no problem with this as long as you talk about making modifications for those students who may be less flexible and then demonstrating it.  For example, if you are less flexible, you can put a towel or blanket underneath your hips.

The POWER STRETCH Dr. Lisa calls ""meditation in motion"".  However, it seemed like it was a cut and paste, or at least repeat of exercises from the STRENGTH section.

All and all, if the green tinge doesn't bother you and you are a fan of Dr. Lisa, and you watch the instructor for proper form, this is an ""o.k."" workout.  In my opinion this DVD would have been better if it were just the instructor and there are many other better quality yoga DVD's out for the money with better cuing and instructions on alignment and breadth.  If you are looking for exceptional yoga instruction and workouts, check out Shiva Rea, Baron Baptiste, Bryan Kest, or Rodney Yee to name a few.  If you are looking for a more easy going yoga workout try Max Strom, Suzanne Deason, or Eric Schiffman.  Also, check out the Exhale Core Fusion, these are great DVDS that focus on Yoga and Pilates for strength building.",1363910400,2,3868,4.591240875912408
5277531,3,B009904NLY,"This is a video to add if you're bored with what you already have. However, I've found others that are a better actual workout -- keep in mind that I am an active person. If you're starting out, this might be a great seque. It also has a lot of aerobic activity v. straight yoga. I also found some of the banter annoying and hard to listen to over and over again. It's not bad, just not the best one out there.",1363824000,,410,4.012195121951219
5277532,3,B009904NLY,"One of the reasons I ordered this DVD was because my wife was looking for an exercise video so I figured we could both use this one. It is geared mainly for women but for most things, exercise is exercise, right?

First thing, as many have pointed out, this is really not much of a ""yoga"" video so why it is called ""Yoga Blast"" escapes me except I have to think they are trying to capitalize on the popularity of yoga and set it apart from the numerous other exercise videos out there of which this one to me seems not much different in terms of a workout.

What I initially noticed when viewing the DVD is how revealing Dr. Lisa's outfit is, leaving little to the imagination. What's funny is the next day articles appeared in the news about how Lululemon has recalled the yoga pants it manufactures because they are too sheer and revealing. That gave me a good laugh because I was thinking Dr. Lisa and her assistant Joan must be wearing Lululemon gear. It looks just way too tight.

The exercise routines themselves to me are beneficial although I find some to be too difficult, at least for now. But there are three different routines on the DVD and overall it seems to provide a well-rounded workout if you have the time to go through all of them. Both of the instructors do an awful lot of talking and there is hardly any silence.  Is that talking helpful?  I'd say the first time through a lot of it is useful information but then if you do these routines regularly it gets to be tiresome. A reviewer found Dr. Lisa to be particularly annoying but to me both of them are on the same level - either you tolerate their talking or just mentally block it out of your mind and focus on letting them lead you in the exercises.

Overall - this is an average workout DVD and I feel like they are trying to mislead you with the ""Yoga Blast"" title just to get you to spend your money because it mentions the word ""yoga"" when really very little of it has to do with yoga. There's nothing particularly special about any of it - it's just average, which is why I gave it 3 stars.",1363824000,,2073,4.289002557544757

5277535,2,B009904NLY,"Horrible.  My wife bought this CD and she will never use it.  It has almost no elements of yoga, and ""Dr Lisa""'s participation is awful and contributes nothing.  At best this workout is aerobics routines.",1361664000,,204,4.771428571428571

When I asked the recipient her opinions, she offered the following:
1. It's called ""Yoga Blast"" but wheres the yoga?
2. There is a lot of dancing , but that is not yoga.
3. There are some yoga poses and power stretching in the final segment
4.  This Dr. Lisa certainly talks and talks and talks and talks and talks. Get the message?
5. She thought there were much better workout and yoga videos on the market,

8537695,2,B009904NLY,"For starters, they do not explain the proper technique. If you're new to yoga, you won't be able to follow along and if by some miracle you are able to, you will most likely not be doing it properly therefore diminishing your results. I'm not new to yoga but I'm not an expert by any means and it was really hard for me to keep up. They went through the poses way too quickly and were not explaining what they were doing so unless, you were watching the screen the entire time, you wouldn't know what they were doing. It's really hard to do the poses correctly and still watch the tv. This product is not worth the money.",1392681600,,621,4.226890756302521

8537697,2,B009904NLY,"Dr. Lisa is not the instructor another lady is the instructor.
Yoga is done in between other exercises; it is not really a Yoga DVD.
Dr. Lisa has a dance background but she is not that good doing the dance moves.
The most annoying thing is that Dr. Lisa talks during the whole DVD so instead of having one lady talking and annoying you, you have two ladies.
The music is not inspirational or rhythmic.
The scenery is good (a pool with some purple flowers).

Would I have bought this on my own? No.  Would I recommend this DVD? No, because it states it is a YOGA DVD and it is not a Yoga DVD.

8537698,1,B009904NLY,"I liked the video, but this is not the video I thought I was getting.

The video I thought I was getting was Dr. Lisa (the woman on the DVD) doing Yoga with the Yoga moves progressively getting more difficult.

This DVD is actually cardio with Yoga moves mixed in. Dr. Lisa (The woman on the DVD) is not even the one directing the moves. Another woman shows you the move, and ""Dr. Lisa"" is on HER side giving added commentary.

""Dr. Lisa"" gives too much commentary. What I like about Yoga videos are the tranquility vibes that they give off. True Yoga videos are mostly silent, with the lady explaining the move in a minimalist fashion, and you hear ""zen music"" in the background. Its supposed to relax you while your body is getting a great workout at the same time.

In Yoga Blast, ""Dr. Lisa"" is CONSTANTLY talking. Not one moment is there a true 'talk break'. She says things like ""this move is great for the bedroom, ladies"" and its annoying when she says that. Especially if your quest for yoga is for inner peace, not outside validation.

Now in terms of the cardio, the cardio and yoga is good for beginners who want a good 20 minute workout. It just wasn't the video I thought I was getting.",1369267200,2,1199,4.382882882882883
8537699,1,B009904NLY,"Honestly, I picked this up because the description made it sound like an engaging, invigorating yoga workout, but I couldn't have been more wrong.  This is the worst fitness DVD I have seen in a while.  I am not sure why yoga is even in the title.  The instructor in the routine always makes modifications and uses cutesy names instead of official terms when doing the workout.  Also, Dr. Lisa and the instructor keep repeating the same stupid phrases throughout the entire DVD (""see, strengthening without weights!"").  I tend to gravitate toward yoga because I love the stretches and I injured my knee a little over a year ago.  The routines are odd and the conversation between Dr. Lisa and the trainer seems like they have a running inside joke that we viewers will never understand.  As a result, I would not recommend this to anyone.",1369094400,,838,4.698630136986301
