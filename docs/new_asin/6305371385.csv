7888796,5,6305371385,"SHE WAITS is a made-for-TV movie from 1972. When Mark (David McCallum- DOGS) and Laura Wison (Patty Duke- THE BABYSITTER, GRAVE SECRETS: THE LEGACY OF HILLTOP DRIVE) arrive at his family mansion, strange occurrences begin almost immediately. Mark has a dark past that involves his first wife, Elaine, and her untimely demise! Laura grows increasingly obsessed w/ Elaine, slowly taking on her characteristics. Is Laura going insane? Worse, could she be possessed by Mark's dead wife? Mark tries his best to keep Laura away from his mother (Dorothy McGuire), leery of what secrets she could divulge. Ms. Duke is the perfect person to play Laura, able to go sleuthing around one minute, and scream hysterically the next! The wonderful cast also includes Lew Ayres (DONOVAN'S BRAIN, DAMIEN: OMEN 2, TV's SALEM'S LOT) as Dr. Carpenter, and Beulah Bondi (THE INVISIBLE RAY) as Mrs. Medina. As supernatural creepers go, SHE WAITS is yet another 70's TV terror that needs to be resurrected...",1454371200,2,984,5.118012422360248

It is a must for my collection but the quality of the VCR tape was not good which is what I expected!",1396396800,2,253,4.1020408163265305

7888801,3,6305371385,"This film is a good psychological thriller, with great performances by Patty Duke, David McCallum, Lew Ayres, Beulah Bondi, and Dorothy McGuire. The story is about a newly married couple Lara and Mark Wilson (Duke & McCallum), who for go their Hotel reservations to go stay at his Mother's home unannounced. It's the first time New wife Lara will meet her Mother-in-law. Mother Wilson (Mcguire) is in the midst of some mental problems where she thinks her first daughter-in-law is speaking to her from the beyond -  Yes, the first Mrs. Wilson is dead!
Of course Mark hasn't told Lara how his first wife died, and he doesn't want Lara talking to his Mom - Why?  Mother Wilson is also very adamant about Lara & Mark leaving the house immediately. Mark and Laura don't heed Mother Wilson's' request to leave the house and the supernatural fun begins!
This is a fun film with a decent story that would be fine for the whole family - however the VHS version is plagued by a very bad transfer - it's a very soft transfer and where it's supposed to be black, it's kind of dark green! Since this film is not available in any other format,  It's not a bad way to spend 90min.
(Recommended only for content of film not quality of VHS tape.)",1049068800,8,1230,4.506726457399103

I'm not telling, (:  But it turns out the husband has secrets in his past that have come back to haunt him.  Problem is the haunt doesn't want to possess him, you guessed it, it's sweet Patty it's after.  Now she has a fight for her life when her impulese grow more uncontrollable. Patty's great movie, ""If Tomorrow Comes"" had a sad ending, will this one?  My lips are sealed, ]:  See how it ends.  This is another one that will be in my video library until I end, (:  misskittykatt ^..^",1009670400,6,570,4.165137614678899
7888803,4,6305371385,"Back in the days when TV-movies were more about stories than the latest adaptation of a news event, ""She Waits"" appeared as a CBS movie of the week.  Featuring Patty Duke, ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'s"" David McCallum, and film vets Lew Ayres, Beulah Bondi, and Dorothy McGuire, the flick is a nice psychological thriller.  Although it is not a classic of the genre, it still benefits from great performances, a satisfying denouement, and a haunting score, similar to John Williams' work on ""Jane Eyre.""
The movie exhibits more of a subtle style of horror that makes it a fitting companion to the likes of ""The Haunting"" (1963's version, not the recent Liam Neeson/Catherine Zeta-Jones fiasco), ""The Innocents,"" and Disney's underrated ""Watcher in the Woods.""",981072000,7,756,5.088709677419355
7888804,4,6305371385,"In this mysterious Film starring Patty Duke, we get to see the tremendous dramatic ability that she brings to her character, Laura.  Laura, newly married, discovers that her husband is still haunted by the death of his  first wife, Elaine.  Elaine's ghost seems to be after Laura---but, is it  really happening or is it only in Laura's mind?  This film would be  marginally entertaining only if not for the outstanding dramatic  performance of Patty Duke.  She makes the character riveting and memorable  and turns what might have been a mediocre film into a viewer's delight.",963187200,16,576,4.978947368421053
