This looks like it would be a lovely movie. I'm requesting a replacement in hopes that some of the copies aren't complete garbage copies. Someone went to a great deal of effort to make a beautiful documentary - is it even them copying and selling this, or just an incompetent pirate?",1489795200,,460,4.476190476190476
8747503,1,B01AIX1TZI,"Had to return it, unfortunately, because you can't watch it on a regular DVD player.  It's meant for European DVD players!  Very sad and disappointing because my husband is an amateur astronomer and really wanted to see it after hearing about it on NPR.  I bought it as a surprise for him but we were both saddened that we couldn't watch it.  I don't understand why something like this is listed when Americans can't view it!  I hope it becomes available in our format.  I would buy it in a heartbeat....",1489190400,,504,4.483516483516484

8747505,5,B01AIX1TZI,"This is a remarkable film, turning preconceptions about young girls living in a Muslim culture (Iran) on their head.  Sepideh lives in a remote mountain village.  Her idol is Albert Einstein.  She dreams of becoming an astronaut.  She is the star of the village astronomy club, and the male teacher encourages her - you see boys and girls together, star-gazing, without chaperones and free to follow their dreams.  An amazing documentary celebrating the dreams of girls and the possibility of achieving them.",1472774400,2,508,5.146341463414634
