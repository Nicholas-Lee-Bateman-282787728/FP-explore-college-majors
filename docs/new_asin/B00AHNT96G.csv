This story is set in North Africa. Three French Foreign Legionnaires in disguise are out to capture a wanted man. It works. [Comic action.] In the city of Tarfa an administrator has a complaint about the actions regarding a Berber merchant. Kincaid brings in the prisoners. Later he washes in his room; the tub is emptied! He visits the new dancer in her room. Lt. Kruger questions the prisoner, who gives unwanted information. Later he gives advice to Sgt. Kincaid. Kincaid proposes an attack to Lt. Kruger; this will use only the prisoners. They leave on their mission. [Alcohol is dehydrating and can result in sunstroke. How do they water their horses?] They see a camp of Riffs and learn valuable information. Can they destroy the ammunition in that tent?

Those tribes have been united, they no longer fight each other. That tent does not contain ammo! A wedding will unite the tribes. Sgt. Kincaid plans to delay this by kidnapping the bride, a very dangerous action. They succeed! Can a false clue be planted? It works. But there is another problem. Sgt. Kincaid solves it. One Legionnaire is wounded, and stays behind. ""Get that machine gun!"" The rest escape. Will they make a mistake? The prisoner can't escape, she is guarded by Sgt. Kincaid for the next three days. [If he lives that long.] The Riffs discover them. Shooting follows. Can they make a deal? No. The death of Mala will allow the attack. A sandstorm allows an opportunity for attack or escape. Mala offers a deal to one Legionnaire, but he wants cash in advance. They reach an oasis for needed water. They can reach Tarfa the next day, the five days are over. Mala offers threats.

That abandoned wagon contained a payroll, millions of francs. Will this affect their mission? Night falls. One man makes a mistake. Who fired that shot? There is an explosion; will it send an alarm? Sgt. Kincaid tries a ruse, it draws an attack. [Believable?] Kincaid and Mala escape, but are pursued by another tribe. Kincaid is captured. Is this the end? Mala intercedes for him. [Believable?] The surviving Legionnaires meet him. But Kincaid has another idea. Wedding guests must not be armed. [To avoid personal conflicts?] This wedding will unite two tribes. Some create arguments among the guests. [The reason guests are separated by family.] There is a ceremony where medals are awarded. Will Kincaid get another reward? [Believable?]

This movie is sort of like a Western that is located in North Africa. It is about average for an action movie in that era, with predictable events. How does it compare to the shows on TV? The French defeat at Dien Bien Phu was followed by a revolt in Algeria that ended French colonial rule around 1960.",1376352000,2,2728,4.785562632696391
