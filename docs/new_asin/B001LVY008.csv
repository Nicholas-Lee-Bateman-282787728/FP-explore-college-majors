8326573,5,B001LVY008,A very good video. Shows all the moves and applications.,1491350400,,56,4.7
8326574,4,B001LVY008,"The dvd gives a brief history of o-mei and a quick bio on the lienage. it's fairly easy to learn the pattern of the form by watching tony chen. He does not do any explainng of his movements, that's all up to you and your eyes. The application sections of the dvd are easy to learn from too. this was a good buy but if you are not willing to do the work to learn this form then you should buy a dvd that spoon feeds you. I'm happy with my buy.",1367884800,2,442,3.8152173913043477
