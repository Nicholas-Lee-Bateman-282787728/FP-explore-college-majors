2636847,5,B000HEWGXI,"I actually have both of the Julia Child DVD sets.  It's amazing to watch these shows and see how great she really was.  She was fearless and she makes you fearless to try new recipes, ideas and techniques!",1257638400,,205,4.368421052631579

2636849,5,B000HEWGXI,"The more I learn about cooking the more I realize how superior her television show is compared to most cooking programs. Not only do the episodes hold up to those of  today's chefs, she is a much better teacher than, I think, any of them.  Her commentary as she works is just right.  Some of her remarks just seem funny then when you cook the dish you realize there was a perfect instruction tucked in there.  I learn more from watching her than any other chef; she is incredibly fast but seems to be taking her time to show the correct way to do things. And her explanations of ""why"" are priceless. Chefs don't do that much now, yet it is valuable in the sense that ambitious cooks (like me) really benefit from knowing WHY things are supposed to be done in a certain way. It helps me improve.  I watch all the cooking shows and hers really are the best. I wish I had all of her shows on dvd.",1212019200,9,893,4.1988304093567255
2636850,5,B000HEWGXI,"I am a french trained pastry chef who grew up watching Julia in my mothers kitchen.  She was a groundbreaking culinairian, and paved the way for French cuisine in the US and the television cooking shows.  Every Big name from the food network owes  it to Julia Child.  If you love cooking, then you will love this DVD.",1196812800,6,317,4.413793103448276
2636851,3,B000HEWGXI,"I'm very happy that WGBH has released this third DVD set of Julia Child's wonderful show, but like another reviewer I was very disappointed that the first disk was taken up entirely by a 1-hour biography of Julia, and there are only 12 cooking shows on the other two disks, versus 18 shows provided on the first two sets. But, on the other hand, I'm extremely happy to have it at all. Early last year I emailed WGBH in praise of the DVD sets, hoping for more in the future, and was told that no more were in the works...then this came along.

The ""American Masters"" biography is quite good, but I didn't think it was necessary to devote an entire disk to it when it is only an hour long. In this respect, I felt kind of cheated.

Nonetheless...I really, truly hope that WGBH keeps releasing these sets, there are MANY MORE ""French Chef"" episodes that we could be watching! I hate to think them mouldering in a vault somewhere. Unlike some folks, I don't particularly care for Julia's later collaborative shows (somehow they seem diluted and the full character of Julia doesn't come through) so these originals are my holy grail.",1176163200,39,1128,4.551724137931035
2636852,5,B000HEWGXI,"I am amused that I got an invite to review this product, as I have yet to be able to RECEIVE this product. Due to a 'whoopsie' somewhere in their automated system, my order for Julia Child III was magically transformed into Julia Child I.  I asked that it be replaced and received... Julia Child I again! When I asked for that to be fixed, I was informed in a very nice and polite email that the problem was not yet fixed and sorry, you're out of luck and there's Just No Julia III.  :(

So if you've gotten this product, consider yourself lucky!",1169164800,3,546,4.230769230769231
2636853,5,B000HEWGXI,"I can't wait for more episodes!  The addition of the biography in this one was nice, but I would rather have had more t.v. episodes.  I already had the biography.

Waiting patiently for # 4.",1168819200,5,190,4.371428571428571
2636854,4,B000HEWGXI,"This is the third installment in which I hope continues to be a series of Julia's cooking shows. The difference in this set is that one of the three discs contains the biography of her life and her two loves (Paul Child and cooking and in that order) and and weaves them wonderfully from her pampered beginning to her iconic growth that created the cooking world as we know it today.

Regarding her biography I have seen several bits and pieces of her life on various programs but this one particular tribute was most well done. They must have been quite acceptable to Julia because there is film and photos of her from her youngest years to present day events, as well as her own accounts that seemed to have been made rather close to her later years. And sometimes its the little details that are mentioned that give you just one more insight into who she was, and you feel that you know her just a little more. But what is our interest in this tall, gangly lady from the East Coast? Many have tried to figure it out, but then again, why analyze? Just enjoy.

Per usual superb standards, the package which contains the golden nuggets of her TV shows come rather well-contained and protected in a sturdy jacket. There are various photos of Julia from different times of her show, both black & white and one in color. Each of those photos give you insight into what made the country love her. She was so very much above being pretentious that what you saw was what you got; if it was a good show, she looked comfortable at the end but if she truly worked extra hard to get a dish and its finer points across, she looked a bit disheveled with her hair a bit messy, and seemingly a wee bit tired for the effort. But all this not because the cooking was impossible or difficult, but because the technology that modern day cooks and chefs have now is the art of takes and retakes, and Julia did not have that luxury back then. It was real-time cooking; the shows were live. The ability to re-do a scene or clean up a spill were not available because it was live TV and very expensive. With Julia, she gave you honesty and a great deal of empathy for loving an art that can put you through your paces, but a challenge that you gladly accept nonetheless. As her shows progressed and technology changed, she was able to enjoy an easier pace and filming was less stressful. But you will learn all that in the biography portion of this set so that when you watch the actual cooking shows themselves, your appreciation for her will be much more fine-tuned and much more understood.

Disc One:

The American Masters Series on ""Julia Child: America's Favorite Chef!""

Disc Two:

STARTERS and SIDE DISHES: Brioche and Pate a Choux (this was particularly enjoyable in that you can use a variation of the dough to make other types of main meals or use it as dessert)

MAIN COURSES: Coq au vin (also known as Chicken Fricassee though it sounds so much more lovely in French) and Pot au Feu

DESSERTS: ""Introducing Charlotte Malakoff"" which was simply a fun name to describe making lady fingers as is and for other desserts, and Petit Fours (these are the greatest individual, yet elegant way of serving the most beautiful cakes!)

Disc Three

STARTERS and SIDE DISHES: Bourride and aioli, quiche lorraine offerings

MAIN COURSES: Coquilles Saint Jacque and Piperade for lunch

DESSERTS: Madelines and a genoise jelly roll (she makes it so easy)

and napoleans (pastry cream, custard, whipped cream centers....the possibilities are endless).

As I mentioned previously, part of the charm associated with her shows was the era in which they were filmed. Technology was somewhat in its infancy, perhaps getting to the toddler stage, but it was still rather crude in its form. As you watch the opening credits in her earliest episodes, you see Julia keeping a watchful eye on what she is creating as well as on the cue she will be receiving in order to start the show or segment. More than once you see a stagehand ever so slightly getting in the way of the camera, unlike today in which you sadly never see an error or see much of anything go awry.

Julia herself is her own best and most sympathetic critic; when stuff happens, what are you going to do? For Julia, ""ce la vie"" and move on!! My only criticism of this set is that they included the biography as part of the package; I would have preferred to purchase the biography separately and instead, have gotten another dose of her cooking episodes. But it's not even worthy of a criticism so consider this to add to your DVD library of gastronomic delight, all of it courtesy of our beloved Julia.",1167264000,73,4634,4.532934131736527
2636855,3,B000HEWGXI,"I absolutely love watching Julia Child, was excited when the first 2 sets came out.  I enjoyed both of those.  My complaint with this one is that it is only 12 episodes, instead of 18 like the other sets.  Disc 1 is a biography from the American Masters series instead of the French Chef show. If it had 18 episodes, I'd rate it higher.",1163980800,45,336,4.21875

8139359,5,B000HEWGXI,"I love Julia Child and love the French Chef series, I wish there was more than just the few seasons they've put out, but I bought them all and I highly recommend them.

She goes from artichokes to omelettes and making croissants from scratch... each one is great and full of fun and information. Skip some of the trash on Food network about diners and shows with poor grammar in the titles and by these. You'll love them!",1416009600,2,421,4.397435897435898
8139360,4,B000HEWGXI,Great DVD! I did think the first two in the series was better.,1409184000,,62,3.8461538461538463
8139361,5,B000HEWGXI,Like a little kid I would wait for these to arrive. It's amazing to be able to purchase her programs on DVD and to select the recipe to watch her cook it just before I cook it... simple and healthly!!,1364428800,,200,4.025
8139362,5,B000HEWGXI,"I've been a fan of Julia Child since I was a kid and my mom used to watch these shows on PBS when they were first aired. The quality of the video seems good, it is amazing that she did all of this live. Julia was so not Food Network material and sadly she would never have gotten a show in this day and age of Bobby Flay and EVOO Rachel Ray!",1361836800,,341,3.75
8139363,5,B000HEWGXI,"If you loved Julia, you will loved this and learn so much about cooking as well.  It's hard to get enough of her refreshing approach to cooking, enjoy.",1359590400,,151,4.392857142857143
8139364,5,B000HEWGXI,"This is the way cooking shows ought to be, and the TV food networks ought to take a lesson from them.  It's a great teaching tool, and also a whale of a lot of fun to watch.  She was priceless.",1358553600,,193,3.8

8139366,5,B000HEWGXI,I love biographies so to get the biography along with 2 disks of The French Chef was great! Loved it!,1343088000,,101,4.1
8139367,5,B000HEWGXI,"Julia is such an inspiration. These shows are wonderful to watch and to cook by. The dvd about her life was great to watch, very informative and I loved the photos. I wish all of her shows were available and in order. Come on PBS, it's time to release All of Julia's French Chef shows. Hopefully the more people that buy these dvds the more they will release.",1275264000,,359,4.294117647058823
