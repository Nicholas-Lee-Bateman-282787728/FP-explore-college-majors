8582210,4,B00CIVORZI,"I enjoyed this, but it wasn't quite up to the level of the movie with Jimmy Stewart. I thought Art Carney was good but not great as Elwood.  I love Marion Lorne on Bewitched but she wasn't as good as I expected her to be here.

Speaking of Bewitched, Elizabeth Montgomery makes an early appearance here as the nurse at the sanitarium.  It is a fairly dull role but she does her best with it.

The surprise to me was Charlotte Rae as Myrtle Mae.  One of my favorite cast members in the movie is Victoria Horne, so I was expecting to be disappointed but Rae does a great job.

The video itself is not the best but considering its age I was fine with it.  I was disappointed in the very dull commercials for DuPont that were included. I'd previously watched the tv version of Arsenic and Old Lace and had found the old Hallmark commercials fascinating but these weren't as interesting. Overall I'd recommend this if you like the stars or want to compare it to the movie.",1495152000,,967,4.338888888888889
8582211,3,B00CIVORZI,Grainy picture quality because it is such an old play back when TV was very grainy.  Art Carney is good but the rest of cast not very good and nothing will ever compare to Jimmy Stewart's performance in the classic 1950 movie.  Kind of a disappointment.,1475366400,,253,4.478260869565218

The disc played fairley well thoe it did jump a couple times but it didn't effect the show.",1473897600,,605,4.05
8582213,5,B00CIVORZI,Just to see Marion Lorne in the role she was born to play is worth the cost of this DVD. Art Carney is equally wonderful as are Elizabeth Montgomery and Charlotte Rae. A real treasure.,1469664000,,184,4.285714285714286
