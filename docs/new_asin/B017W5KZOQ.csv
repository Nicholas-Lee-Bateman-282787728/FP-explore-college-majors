7535763,5,B017W5KZOQ,"A cinematic achievement unlike anything you've ever seen before. This film cannot be described, by mere words. It must be seen to be believed. What we have is a film DESTINED to become a Troll 2, Birdemic, or The Room-esque cult classic.",1472947200,2,237,4.666666666666667

7535767,1,B017W5KZOQ,"Though there is no problem with the disc or case themselves, Dancin' It's On is a truly bottom-of-the-barrel film that does not deserve to be paid for or seen by anyone. Poor acting, abysmal dubbing, ugly cinematography, dull story, and not even that good of dancing.",1459382400,,267,4.826086956521739
7535768,1,B017W5KZOQ,"Worst movie even scene, lack of acting talent, sound does not match up, just a cheap knock-off of much better theatrical releases for this genre. It supposedly opened on many screens, those people who paid to see it, should get a refund",1457049600,,236,4.642857142857143
7535769,5,B017W5KZOQ,"Dance fans will FREAK at the great moves and production numbers in this film, and I mean that as a good thing! Lots of happy and hot young dancers competing for the grand prize is the setting for a romantic story of unlikely lovers. Nobody is going to win an Acting Oscar here, but that's the same for Step Up and High School Musical. This is fun escapism, put-a-smile-on-your face ENTERTAINMENT!",1457049600,3,396,4.591549295774648

8740845,5,B017W5KZOQ,This movie is hilarious. I know it's supposed to be a dance movie.. but the acting is so bad that it makes the movie ridiculous and you can't help but just laugh through the whole thing.  I watched it on Netflix first and my daughter and I laughed through the whole thing and then we made our friends watch it.  Recently Netflix took it off.. guess they do that periodically.. to put new things on.. and so we had to buy it.  We then bought more copies for our friends so they could watch it again.  If you think this is a good quality dance movie.. you will be disappointed.  The lines are cheesy and so are the dances.. the best part is when the old man does a solo... don't want to spoil it.. I would RECOMMEND the movie.,1522627200,,724,4.142857142857143
8740846,5,B017W5KZOQ,It's not The Room or even Mac and Me (it's somewhere between Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas and The Baby) but if you love awful movies it's a must watch.,1511049600,,154,4.344827586206897
8740847,4,B017W5KZOQ,"Let's be clear, this is a fun movie for the dance sequences but the acting and dialogue are definitely on the cheesy side (if you're a 70s/80s kid, think ""Roller Boogie"".)  The people in this movie are DANCERS, not actors. That being said, I really enjoyed it. The director has stated he made this movie so families could watch it together, so there's no nudity, cursing, drug use, etc. This means I can watch it with my son and neither of us get embarrassed!  The setting in Florida is gorgeous! A cute little movie. Harmless fun.",1502928000,,531,4.520833333333333
8740848,2,B017W5KZOQ,"It's really hard to know how to rate this movie.  I thought there was some great dancing,  but I admit I have limited knowledge.  It was fun to watch the dancing.

The acting and storyline were baaaaaad. Lines were stilted. Over dramatic big time - main guy  got very angry when the main girl goes out on a date with someone her father is pressuring her to go with. They ""break up"". Kind of amazing since they have known each other 2 days.

The song lyrics are funny. I still wonder if they were intentionally bad to see if someone noticed.

Song sung as main male runs to tell the main female he loves her:

 ""I'd run 500 mills just to prove that I love ya.
I would even try to be a lesbian.
I'd sleep with a snake in my bed just to prove that I love ya.
I would give up my life - it's the last thing I'd do just to prove, just to prove that I love you.
I would hold hands with a man,
 I'd swim with sharks and show you I can.
There's no place I'd rather be than right here with you. ..""",1501286400,,988,3.895
8740849,1,B017W5KZOQ,"The acting in this movie is AWFUL. I couldn't even get half way through it. I love the dancers from SYTYCD, but they dance way better than what's shown in the movie. The highlight was Russell, who was adorable as usual.",1500163200,,219,4.365853658536586
8740850,5,B017W5KZOQ,Great Movie dancing was great!!! Love story love it!!!,1487376000,,54,5.111111111111111
8740851,5,B017W5KZOQ,"This is the seminal story in modern literature. Girl meets boy, girl is an heiress, boy is a dishwasher. Both are exquisite dancers. I urge you, dear reader, to embark on the same journey I went on, and to truly embrace the majesty that is: ""Dancin': It's On!"".  This is the movie that in ten years will be remembered among the likes of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, A Tale of Two Cities, and other classics of fiction. Not only are you lucky enough to be able to own this movie for less than ten dollars, you will be able to watch it countless times, and break it down shot by shot.

David Winters asserts himself as the John Carpenter of this generation with breathtaking shots of the local Miami night life. Flawless acting from star Witney Carson leads to a mastery of a role not seen since Orson Welles in ""Citizen Kane"".

This is a movie that will be taught in film classes for years and years to come, and magnificently, you can be among the first to behold this glorious screenplay on finely scanned DVD.

I honestly want to start a phone banking campaign to get this movie back in theaters because it did not earn nearly enough. Dare I say anything short of a billion dollars globally is a statement on how undervalued the amazing craftsmanship that went into this movie is?

In summary, I would urge anyone, of any age to purchase and welcome this movie into their household.

It is truly amazing.",1479686400,7,1417,4.494163424124514
