3415037,1,B0018CAFZO,"The DVD content could have been done in 5 mins. Titles appeared on screen and then were read out slowly purely to  pad out the time. The most beneficial part of this purchase is the DVD case that it came in.
Save your money and never buy anything from this production group. I can only repeat RUBBISH RUBBISH. I rate this item as minus 10 stars not the 1 given at the beginning.",1217030400,10,378,4.178082191780822
3415038,1,B0018CAFZO,The actual content of DVD is about 19 minutes long and the good part looks like some kind of Powerpoint presentation with almost no pictures. The actual demonstration of clit massage is less than 5 minutes long. And the woman in the demonstration is almost silent. The demonstrator tells how the woman is aroused but the viewers have no way of knowing. I'd rather recommend Loving Sex video series.,1216166400,18,398,4.782608695652174
8269385,5,B0018CAFZO,"This was an excellent DVD that was informative without all the frills or sensationalism. Very much appreciated because it was not that. My partner really enjoys what I learned and I hope to improve on my ability. I would recommend this to EVERY MALE and FEMALE.

8269387,5,B0018CAFZO,"I really enjoyed the ride this video takes the viewer on, every aspect from talking about the Deliberate Orgasm date before, during and after. This type of open communication about what a woman wants was very refreshing to see and experience. Having a three minute orgasm is a great introduction to Deliberate Orgasm, or DOing. Knowing that more pleasure can be incorporated in one's life three minutes at a time makes having more intimate time with my boyfriend an attainable goal. We bought it with the other part of the series - Orgasm at the First Touch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Orgasm-First-Touch-Welcomed-Consensus/dp/B0050RFJD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Orgasm First Touch Welcomed Consensus</a>&nbsp;which enforced even more how easy and Doable it could be to carve out an orgasm nearly every day! It really has been a turn-around for us, because now when we do have more time to be intimate together we have a base that we have built and we don't feel ""rushed"" to get to the good part. The whole experience is good! I can't thank these people enough for putting out such simple information on how a man and woman can get together and in three minutes feel so much closer. If you buy this video, do exactly as they say and exactly as they do - even if you think you already know the information. If you actually DO it, you will understand how truly great it is.",1382832000,3,1420,5.098712446351931
8269388,2,B0018CAFZO,"A couple is better off watching porn to learn more about becoming better lovers than this DVD.  Unless a couple if offended by seeing fun sex in movies I do not recommend this DVD or any others in the series.  Reading a book, asking friends or watching a movie with ""super sex"" is more instructive this series.",1382400000,,310,4.421052631578948
8269389,1,B0018CAFZO,"Terrible DVD. It looks as it was done back in the 80's. It's just a catch in order to get the consumer to purchase a continuation DVD. Pitty me the fool, for my buying of such media.",1307577600,,182,3.945945945945946
8269390,1,B0018CAFZO,"For 10 bucks I expect to be told something new. After a brief overview of female anatomy they show a quick ""sample"" of DOing, and then a sales pitch for the rest of the series.  The total film was about 10 minutes and most of it was a narrator talking VERY slowly as if trying to fill the time.

I agree with their philosphophy, and would love it if the product was able to deliver what was promised, but I felt that this was a promotional film, and should have been given away. Since I paid really money for it I'm pretty disappointed, and am VERY unlikely to buy another film from them as I am afraid it will be a repeat performance (nothing new, long and drawn out, over priced).

(let me qualify this by saying I bought this actually learn how to improve, not to see naked women. And with that in mind I still found this disappointing).",1279670400,2,840,4.2375
8269391,1,B0018CAFZO,This product is more a demo CD than a DVD that should be sold to consumers.  A good part of the DVD is actually powerpoint presentations.  DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY on this!  WIthout a doubt the worst item I have ever purchased from Amazon.,1275696000,3,238,4.2444444444444445
8269392,2,B0018CAFZO,"I have purchased most of all the dvd's put out by welcomed consensus. an was quite satisifed by their other products..The entire dvd could have been done in 5 minuet's. It's a play on their other dvd,""Deliberate Orgasm ""...  3 min orgasm should have been promoted as a info-comerical... it was 30 minuet's of hype",1254355200,8,313,4.6909090909090905
8269393,1,B0018CAFZO,"In my opinion, this DVD is a scam and I will report that to Amazon! FYI: I didn't see this for sale at any other DVD site.

First, this video's main feature is NOT 35 minutes long. Perhaps there are 10 minutes of bonus features, but DVD length is normally the main feature length. We started at 7pm and were done before 7:20.
Spoiler alert: Don't read any further if you prefer to see it first-hand.

Summary:
It starts with about 10 minutes of cutting back and forth between slowly narrated on-screen text and a slow speaking woman. Honestly, it seemed they were talking slowly for 2nd graders. All of the text (about 1 sentence at a time) could have easily been on a a single screen. Periods of complete silence in these segments probably adds up to about 20% (2 minutes) of the time .

How do you get a 3 minute orgasm? Here is their secret: Redefine orgasm to mean any time you are getting more pleasure from your genital area than any other.... THIS IS NOT A JOKE! They could have called it the 3-hour orgasm, except they wouldn't have fooled anyone into buying it.

The last ?? minutes is a clinical demonstration of manual stimulation of a woman. It was only about 3 minutes for us, but we watched most of it at 2x speed, so it might have been 5 minutes or more.

The last minute is credits.

We didn't look at any special features. I got the DVD I ordered in a timely fashion, so at the end of the 15 minutes or so I broke the DVD in half and shredded the cover.  I essentially paid $[...] to get an empty DVD case and to waste 20 minutes of my time and my wife's. I value the cover at [...] cents.

I do not believe a single 5-star review of this dvd is legit. They are probably all friends or employees of the company (person?) who released this.

Do not waste your money or your energy. I intend to try to get it removed from Amazon's offerings.",1252627200,24,1856,4.220338983050848
8269394,1,B0018CAFZO,"This is a B-rate, 15 minute film that looks like it was shot in the 80's.  It's largely uninformative, unsexy, and the two ""instructors"" resemble a father/daughter pair, which makes the whole scene even weirder. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU DO NOT PURCHASE THIS VIDEO.",1242259200,15,264,5.0
