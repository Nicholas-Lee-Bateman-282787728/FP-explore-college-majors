She has a good understanding of the US monitary system and has figured out its basic scam.  Which is making money from nothing so producing the ever present infation as the money supply gets diluted (just like all other countries with paper money)

But in these times a person really needs to figure out just exactly what is up.  Because if you don't your wealth will be gone before the depression is over.  Either through real estate that continues to drop or a stock market that recovers only to crash again over and over, or paper money that inflates to nothing or even physical Gold that is conficated by the gov.  Her book is a part of the puzzel.  This video is a quick study.

Whatch out, were going down!",1235865600,2,917,4.218390804597701
