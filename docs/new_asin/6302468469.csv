471716,3,6302468469,"This is one of the few DVD's in the collection that you could actually consider conceptual: somehow all episodes deal with the powers of the mind.  Who wants to know the future? William Shatner's character does, but does  he realizes the price? Find out in ""Nick of Time"" (Season 2).  ""The Prime Mover"" (Season 2), is about telekinesis at the service  of a gambler... and that equals risky business. ""It's a Good  Life"" (Season 3), stars a very young Billy Mummy with incredible and  dangerous powers. Finally ""The Mind and the Matter"" (Season 2)  shows a guy how the power of thought can create his perfect world.",963532800,6,614,4.682242990654205

471760,5,6302468469,"""The Mind and the Matter"" stars comedian Shelley Berman. Serling wrote the script for a few comedian in mind, before settling with Berman. The scene with Berman as a woman in the elevator was Berman's idea -- Serling went home and rewrote the scene that evening so the next day they were able to film that. ""It's a Good Life"" is a classic. Jack Harris was responsible for the stop-motion animation for the dinosaurs in this episode. The original script called for Dan Hollis' head to be sewed onto a snake -- not a jack in the box.

The stock footage of the car rolling on the transistors originated from the movie THUNDER ALLEY. ""Nick of Time"" was one of Richard Matheson's favorite episodes. Like many of his stories, it plays in real time (24 - 25 minutes).

Trivia above supplied not from the DVD, but from the book, ""The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic"" because the 800 plus page book is a P-E-R-F-E-C-T companion to the DVD.

I remember being scared watching ""It's a Good Life"". How could a little boy wish people into a cornfield? and ""Nick of Time"" was a favorite because...well, William Shatner (need I say more).

I wouldn't suggest TZ to younger kids now a days but for us older;) folks I'd say this disc a definitely worth buying.",1167177600,,403,4.36
471762,4,6302468469,"I hate in the ep Stopover In A Quiet Town when they are panning to Rod Serling you can see the studio background showing the house Bob and Millie Frazier are in is really a studio. They pan in a similar way in the ep about the old lady getting the strange phonecalls, too. Other than the eps are usually great (unless they're sappy like Kick The Can).About Adam West (Batman). Yes he was never on the original TZ and what a pity! He was perfect for the TZ. In one ep Caesar and Me, Stafford Repp (later Chief O'Hara on Batman with Adam West) was in it. There is a character in Caesar and Me named Jonathon WEST! Also the name in the title Caesar, a Dummy (like Caesar Romero who played the Joker on Batman!) and this Caesar tells jokes! Was the writer of Caesar and Me psychic? I believe so! If there are alternate universes I feel there Adam West was on The Twiight Zone!",1110153600,,872,4.196428571428571
471763,5,6302468469,"""The Lonely"" is the classic here, a textbook example of an effective Rod Serling TWILIGHT ZONE episode.  Mr. James A. Corry is a convict who, as punishment, has been sent to an asteroid (which, in The Twilight Zone, resembles a desert that stretches ""to infinity"") for fifty years.  As the action begins, Corry is languishing from loneliness.  His head supplier, Allenby, takes pity on him and gives him a robot woman, named Alicia, for a companion.  Though Alicia is ""a machine,"" she looks and sounds like a human being.  This makes Corry boil over with frustration and anger, since he desires her but cannot have her; he is ""sick of being mocked by the memory of women.""  But when Corry learns that Alicia has feelings, too, a relationship blossoms.  Jack Warden gives an intense, wholly believable performance as the convict, and the rest of the cast - including Jean Marsh as Alicia and Ted Knight as one of Allenby's crew - are a perfect team.  ""The Lonely"" includes what has been called the most romantic scene in any episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, that in which Corry and Alicia sit outside at night, gazing at and talking about the stars.  Bernard Herrmann's musical score, which suggests the infinity of the desert and the emptiness a lonely person feels, sets the seal on a most satisfying episode.",1095724800,,1307,4.747787610619469
471764,5,6302468469,"THE PRIME MOVER from the Second season aired on March 24, 1961 and was written by Charles Beaumont and is an episode that deserves repeated viewing. Dane Clark and Buddy Ebsen operate a small diner. When Clark discovers that Ebsen has telekinetic powers he drags him off to Vegas to make a killing at the casinos. This is a good-natured episode as opposed to THE FEVER on the allure and pitfalls of gambling. What really makes this episode so repeatedly viewable are the performances of Dane Clark and Buddy Ebsen. It's like water and oil. Clark is the ""fly by the seat of your pants - happy go lucky guy"" who will try anything for a dime. Ebsen stands for reason and patients. Ultimately we learn to use the tools we are given with a sense of responsibility tempered with passion. This is an excellently conceived and delivered episode. IT'S A GOOD LIFE from the Third season aired on November 3, 1961. It was written by Rod Serling and is one of the most famous episodes of the series. Serling's introduction, which leads up to Billy Mumy's wide-eyed stare into the camera, is an indelible and disturbing image. The jack-in-the-box scene is also unforgettable and equally disturbing. Even Serling's dialogue is so memorable and conjures up images of fear. Just the mention of ""the cornfield"" sends chills down the back. Anyone who has seen this episodes knows what I am referring to. Anyone who has not must see it! The excellent cast includes John Larch, Cloris Leachman, Tom Hatcher and we must not forget Billy Mumy. Director Jim Sheldon really captured the fear and terror of the captive inhabitants of this rural community. NICK OF TIME from the Second season aired on November 18, 1960 and was written by Richard Matheson. Traveling newlyweds William Shatner and Patricia Breslin stop in a luncheonette while their car is being repaired. While in a booth an ever-confident Shatner puts a coin into a fortune-telling machine adorned with the bobbling head of a smiling plastic devil. Each question and answer begins to make Shatner question his fate to the point that he becomes unraveled about his future. Thematically this is similar to THE FEVER where just one more coin in the machine may give you solace. This is a fascinating episode that bears repeated viewing just to observe the ease at which one can be drawn in. However, the denouement makes the morality of the story clear. THE MIND AND THE MATTER directed by Buzz Kulik from the Second season aired on May 12, 1961 and was written by Rod Serling. Clerk, Shelly Berman eliminates people from the face of the earth by using the power of thought that he mastered from a book given to him. He soon repopulates the planet with people who look exactly like him with disconcerting results. Though lighthearted in nature this episode attempts to reveal life as others view each of us. Be careful of what you wish for. Volume 9 is a good well-balanced representation of THE TWILIGHT ZONE.",1025222400,16,2949,4.76171875
471765,5,6302468469,"THE LONELY is one of Rod Serling's classics from the series. Jack Warden convincingly plays a convict sentenced to forty years alone on a distant asteroid. A periodic supply ship commanded by John Dehner one day leaves him a companion, a robot played flawlessly by Jean Marsh. Bernard Herrmann's poignant score evokes the enigmatic inner feeling of Jack Warden's love for his companion. And subsequently Herrmann's score captures the human quality of this female robot as she reciprocates that love. The combination of scripting, acting and scoring realistically captures our perceptions of loneliness, love, loss and reality.  PROBE 7 - OVER AND OUT leisurely written by Rod Serling for the fifth Season examines the relationship of two beings, Richard Basehart and Antoinette Bower, the sole survivors of their respective annihilated planets. Basehart and the much underrated and forgotten Bower give good performances.",1020729600,4,921,5.485915492957746
471766,5,6302468469,"Two classics and two whimsical pieces are found on Volume 9 in ""The Twilight Zone"" DVD series.  William Shatner makes his first appearance in the Zone as Don Carter in ""Nick of Time,"" a classic written by Richard Matheson.  On his honeymoon with Pat (Patricia Breslin), the happy couple stop in Ridgeview, Ohio to have their car repaired.  While waiting they go to the local diner where the superstitious Don becomes convinced that the table top fortune telling machine is really predicting the future (Just think of the Magic 8 Ball from Hell).  One of Matheson's best stories and a nice restrained performance from Shatner.  ""The Prime Mover"" was written by Charles Beaumont based on an unpublished story by George Clayton Johnson.  Buddy Ebsen plays Jimbo Cobb, who has telekinetic powers.  When his friend Ace Larsen (Dane Clark) learns Jimbo's secret, they go on a very successful gambling spree until Jimbo's mind blows a fuse.
""It's a Good Life"" written by Rod Serling and based on Jerome Bixby's short story, is one of the most memorable and frightening episode in the series history.  Billy Mumy is Anthony Fremont, a six-year old boy who is absolutely in charge of Peaksville, Ohio.  Cloris Leachman is among the terrified adults who have to consider everything little Anthony does to be a ""good thing.""  Mumy's performance is outstanding and the episode features the longest introduction by Serling in the show's history.  This is one of the episodes that was redone, to lesser effect, in ""The Twilight Zone: The Movie.""  ""The Mind and the Matter"" tells a slightly similar but different tale about Archibald Beechcroft (Shelley Berman), who hates people so much he reads a book on mind power and makes everybody else disappear.  Then he repopulates the world with people just like him and discovers he does not like them very much.  The first and third episodes on this DVD are ""Twilight Zone"" classics, good enough to warrant 5 stars for this particular volume.",990576000,,1973,4.9393939393939394

7826471,5,6302468469,"Volume 9 in the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series is definitely one of the best volumes around with some of the best and most classic episodes. Four episodes in all on this disc that will keep you on the edge of your seat and one could give you nightmares.

The first show on the disc is ""Nick Of Time"". It stars a young William Shatner who with his new wife, played by Patricia Breslin, has car problems while in a small Ohio town and stops to have it repaired. While they wait they go into a diner to have a bite to eat. At every table is a fortune telling machine with a bobble Devil head on it. It all starts out innocent asking silly questions but soon the future Captain Kirk is caught up with the answers the machine is giving convinced that the fate of their lives hang in the balance of what the bobbling devil tells them. Shatner made two appearances on TZ. This was his first appearance. The other would be the famous ""Nightmare At 20,000 Feet"". Like ""Nightmare"" I rate this one of the classic TZ episodes.

Next on the disc is ""The Prime Mover"". This episode stars two of Hollywood's best actors, Dane Clark and Buddy Ebsen. Clark and Ebsen have a small diner they have owned for years. Clark thought he knew everything about his pal Ebsen after all these years but SURPRISE! It turns out Ebsen has telekinetic powers. He can move objects at any time in anyway he wants too. Clark sees this as their path to money, lots and lots of money and he drags Ebsen off to Vegas to play craps. Why craps? Because Ebsen can move the dice to whatever numbers Clark wants them to be. This is a humorous episode for the ""Twilight Zone"" with a strong message behind it. Dane Clark and Buddy Ebsen play well off each other which is what really makes this story so good to watch. I would rate this a classic.

Next up is one of the greatest and most powerful episodes from the Zone. This is a true classic, ""It's A Good Life"". Creepy, scary and tension filled this is the episode that could give you nightmares and its all because of one little boy. Played by Billy Mumy, who would go on the star as Will Robinson in ""Lost In Space"", whose name is Anthony in the story has a power to change and do things by just thinking about it. OH and he can read minds too so you better be careful what you think about him because if you think bad thoughts about him you will be sent off to the cornfield! For one so young at the time Billy plays this role well. He really plays a really creepy part. When you first see him in the episode during the introduction you see him swinging on a fence gate with this wide eye stare that lets you know right off the bat this is no ordinary kid. His parents, played by John Larch and Cloris Leachman, have their hands full. They plus everyone else in town are always on their guard always careful what they think. And they always have to think good thoughts especially about Anthony. If I had to come up with a top ten list of the best episodes from ""Twilight Zone"" this would have to be on that list. Otherwise Anthony might send me to the cornfield!!!

""The Mind and the Matter"" is the last story on the disc and while not a classic it is still a great story starring one of the great comedians from the late '50s early '60s Shelly Berman. Berman's character can't stand people with all their problems and hassles and mindless talking. Then one day he is given a book. Not just any book because remember this is the ""Twilight Zone"". It is a book on the power of thought and how you can change the world around you. Tired of the crowded trains and traffic jams and people in general one day Berman masters the powers taught in the book and makes everyone but himself disappear. It is heaven for him at first. Even however with the quite and peacefulness of not having people around he starts to get lonely. Then he has an idea. If everyone was like him the world would be perfect and wishes everyone back but as himself. Problem solved right? Or is it? It has a good ending to it with a message behind it about being careful what you wish for.

For the serious fan of TZ this is definitely one of those volumes to get because of the great episodes on here. But for anyone this is a DVD I highly recommend. Great stories. Great actors. Great entertainment and at a great price to boot! What more could you want?",1397001600,2,4329,4.267965895249695

7826474,5,6302468469,"I own nearly all of the T.Z. discs. Today, I made a list of my most favorite episodes and my ""next-most-favorite"" episodes. It turned out that Volume 2, Volume 3, and Volume 9, came out ahead of all of the other volumes. Shown below are my narratives on my favorite episodes. VOLUME NINE has three winners: (1) Nick of Time; (2) The Prime Mover; and (3) The Mind and the Matter.  Although many people have expressed admiration for the remaining story, ""It's a Good Life,"" I could not warm up to it, and so I won't speak about it.

Nick of Time stars William Shatner as a young husband, who stops at a little cafe in a small town during the course of a pleasure trip.  Shatner's character proves to have a mild affinity for typical harmless superstitions, but his belief in superstitions gradually reaches an alarming level and his young wife begins to doubt his sanity.  Nick of Time is a charming tale, and there is nothing annoying about it.  The Prime Mover stars Buddy Ebsen, as a man who gains the power to make coins flip over, to make beds rise, and to make dice flip over.  The second half of the story takes place in a casino, a theme that is also shown in the T.Z. episode, THE FEVER.  Even though The Prime Mover is not one of my most favorite T.Z. episodes, I do enjoy watching it once every year.  Now, The Mind and the Matter is another story entirely.  The Mind and the Matter is one of my very, very, very favorite T.Z. episodes, because of its accurate disclosure of certain inconveniences of the workplace environment that makes use of cubicles.  As a companion story, I recommend the color T.Z. episode called, MISTER MOTIVATION.

The commentary below provides my overview of the entire black and white T.Z. series. Immediately below is a list of T.Z. episodes that I've watched at least 25 times each. Without these particular episodes, I would not be me. For some of these stories, I provide a reason why the episode contributes to my personna. And below these, I provide the names of other T.Z. episodes that are charming and engaging enough to watch once every year or so.

NECESSARY FOR LIFE.
(1) Kick the Can. This story, along with Walking Distance and A Stop at Willoughby are the most nostalgic of the T.Z. episodes. If I was required to watch Kick the Can every week for the next ten years, that would be quit fine with me. I love Kick the Can.
(2) A Game of Pool. Stars Jonathan Winters.
(3) What's in the Box. This stars William Damarest, Joan Blondell, and Sterling Holloway. Damarest and Blondell are a married couple. They fight with each other just like my parents used to do in the 1950s and 1960s. What's in the Box lends a comedic frosting to my childhood memories.
(4) One for the Angels. This stars Ed Wynn. This T.Z. episode concerns a deal made with The Devil. This movie is soooo charming it almost makes me want to cry. This is one of the many T.Z. episodes that stars a child. THE BIG TALL WISH, which is about boxing, also stars a child actor.
(5) Nick of Time. Stars William Shatner as a superstitious young husband during a visit to a cafe in a small town. Don't miss the other great episode starring William Shatner, namely Nightmare at 20,000 Feet.
(6) Mind and the Matter. This stars Shelley Berman. This T.Z. episodes speaks my own opinion about noisy workplace arrangements, for example, noisy workplace arrangement involving cubicles. For this reason, watching Mind and the Matter over and over and over has become my religion.
(7) Steel. This stars Lee Marvin. More than any other T.Z. episode, this teaches the virtue of continuing and persevering, despite adversity.
(8) Thirty-Fathom Grave. This stars Mike Kellin as the mentally-deranged ""Chief Bell."" Perhaps the reason Iike THIRTY-FATHOM GRAVE so much, is that it concerns a submarine. Some of my favorite movies are submarine movies, e.g., RUN SILENT RUN DEEP, CRIMSON TIDE, 1941, and U-571. This T.Z. episode also stars Simon Oakland as ""Captain Beecham."" I was amazingly and stunningly and pleasantly surprised to learn, this year, that Simon Oakland starred in THE SAND PEBBLES starring Steve McQueen. Simon Oakland is also in the T.Z. episode, A World of Difference, where Simon Oakland plays a director (the man who cries, ""Cut!"") of a television program.
(9) A Stop at Willoughby. This stars James Daly as the overworked advertising executive. The story reminds me of part of my childhood. In this T.Z. episode, James Daly has repeated dreams during his trainride commute of returning to a simpler time, to living in a small rural town in New England. Perhaps that is why I love A Stop at Willoughby so much -- because I was raised in the outskirts of New Haven, Connecticut. At that time, I had some experience riding the same type of commuter train as featured in A Stop at Willoughby. The ironic ending in this T.Z. episode is among the very best of all the T.Z. episodes, and is equal in greatness to that of TO SERVE MAN, NIGHT CALL (old lady communicating to dead boyfriend), and TIME ENOUGH AT LAST.
(10) Printer's Devil. This stars Burgess Meredith, Robert Sterling, and Pat Crowley. The rapport between Mr. Meredith and Mr. Sterling in the scene in this movie that involves putting a signature on The Devil's contract, could be better than rapport between actors in any other movie in the history of cinema. This scene with the contract-signature really cooks.
(11) Person or Persons Unknown. This stars Richard Long in the character of ""David Gurney."" His last name comes from the fact that the character is being committed to a hospital. Get it? Get it?
(12) A Piano in the House. This stars Barry Morse as the cruel theater critic. And who cannot fall in love with Cyril Delavanti. What a delight is the Cyril Delavanti character in this T.Z. story. Cyril Delavanti also plays a delightful character in A Penny for your Thoughts.
(13) A Penny for your Thoughts. This stars Dick York. Dick York has charmed millions of Americans with his starring role in INHERIT THE WIND, starring Gene Kelly, Frederic March, and Spencer Tracy.
(14) Time Enough to Last. This T.Z. episode is so great that I quivver with humility at the thought that I might types few words about it. It stars Burgess Meredith as the incompetent bank clerk, who had the luck to marry a nagging wife. The nagging wife is played by Jacqueline deWit. Her character is strident in the same way as the wife of Gunther Toody, in CAR 54 WHERE ARE YOU. The ironic ending is one of the greatest of all ironic endings in literary history.
(15) The Fever. This is about a man who initially harbors the notion that gambling is immoral, but who becomes converted to a gambling addict during a trip to a hotel that has gambling machines.
(16) Cavender is Coming. This stars Carol Burnett. This is one of the ""workplace situation"" T.Z. episodes. It seems that I love the T.Z. episodes that feature ""workplace situations"" the most. The ""workplace situation"" T.Z. episodes include, Stop at Willoughby, Mr. Bevis, Printer's Devil, and Mind and the Matter.
(17) A World of Difference. This is another ""workplace situation"" T.Z. episode. The plot involves a man doing his daytime job, when it suddenly turns out, he is only acting in a play.

CHARMING AND ENGAGING.
(1) Walking Distance. Concerns nostalgia for childhood. I have plenty of that, since my grandma was the best of the best of the best of the best of the best, and because I had lots of friends from the years 1955 to 1960.
(2) To Serve Man. Although To Serve Man is one of the greatest of the greatest of the T.Z. episodes, for some reason I only watch it every three years, and not more often.
(3) The Shelter. This stars Larry Gates who plays a doctor. The plot is about a false air-raid warning about an attack by Russian missiles. Larry Gates also performs in YOUNG SAVAGES. YOUNG SAVAGES is one of the greatest films in history. It stars Burt Lancaster, as well as Telly Savalas (Telly Savalas also starred in the T.Z. episode, Living Doll) and Edward Andrews (Edward Andrews stars in two T.Z. episodes).
(4) Third from the Sun. This stars Edward Andrews, who was so delightfully creepy in another T.Z. episode, You Drive.
(5) You Drive. Concerns a hit-and-run driver and the fact that he is haunted by his own automobile.
(6) Living Doll. This stars Telly Savalas. This is a great ""starter Twilight Zone"" episode that is suitable for introducing children of the age of eight or nine to the T.Z. series.
(7) Mr. Dingle the Strong. Stars Burgess Meredith. Not to be missed in this T.Z. episode is Don Rickles. Don Rickles also has a part in RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP, one of the greatest of the greatest of movies.
(8-22) Okay, now I will just list the titles of the rest of my favorite T.Z. episodes. They are, Sixteen Millimeter Shrine, Prime Mover, Mr. Garrity and the Graves, Mighty Casey, Caesar and Me, Nightmare at 20,000 Feet, Night of the Meek, Mr. Bevis, The Silence, The Dummy, Big Tall Wish, Night Call, A World of Difference, Judgement Night, Purple Testament, and Monsters are Due on Maple Street.

COLOR TWILIGHT ZONE. Many of the color Twilight Zone episodes are quite excellent. The best of these include, Execution of Grady Finch, Mister Motivation, and Shades of Guilt. The color Outer Limits episode ""Time to Time"" concerns time travel back to Berkeley in the year 1969, and this story is one of my all-time-favorite stories.",1381017600,,9384,4.66908650937689
