7946198,5,B00005N5R5,Had been looking to view this for a long time...quite fascinating. Amanda Burton was easy to dislike and distrust--but did she in fact know what she was talking about? The ending leaves us wondering. Paul McGann is sympathetic and ambiguous as a man who may have suffered an unimaginable experience.,1407888000,,299,5.0
7946199,5,B00005N5R5,"Ironically, while doing an update to the catalog of my movie library, I ran across this one and decided to watch it this evening - having no recollection of it.  I see that it has great review ratings from other owners, and their details I will leave to you to peruse.

This is a great mystery drama. Don't miss it.

7946200,5,B00005N5R5,"This is worth watching. I felt as if I was looking into the lives of the people of this village instead of just watching a show. Storyline and acting are very good. Just when you think you have solved the mystery, the storyline has you second-guessing yourself. You will always be rethinking who the real villain is. The Amazon's editorial review does a great job in describing this production.

This three part series starts of when a local girl goes missing. We shortly learn that the young girl was murdered. And more then that, the murder has been executed in the exact same manner as one that happened twenty years prior. We see how the investigation affects not only everyone in the village, but the inspectors themselves. This is a very real portrayal of what it might be like to live in such a small community when something like this happens. You have to watch it.",1168992000,3,873,4.596153846153846
7946201,5,B00005N5R5,"This was an excellent story.  It keeps you off balance until almost the last frame.  Extremely well done and I plan to view it again.  Several of my fav actors are in it:  Amanda Burton (Silent Witness), Paul McGann (Withnail and I, Our Mutual Friend), and Zara Turner (McCallum). I love these British productions - keep 'em coming Amazon.",1141603200,3,339,4.694915254237288
7946202,5,B00005N5R5,"Going through some Paul McGann movies online, I ran across this little gem. Rarely do I buy dvds that I'm not familiar with, but this one grabbed me and wouldn't let go. I sat through the whole thing, not knowing where it was leading me. Rarely do you see in a mystery how a crime affects each member of the community and the relationships. This one has it all. Highly recommended!

7946203,5,B00005N5R5,"With the possible exception of Hetty Wainthrop, Forgotten is probably the most unusual production I've seen on PBS's popular Mystery! series.  It is certainly not a cozy little mystery with brilliant detectives and happy endings, like Poirot or Cadfael (both of which I love, by the way); it is more deeply personal, steeped in realism, and will haunt you for many nights to come.
Several things strike me about this miniseries (movie, tv show?  I'm not sure what to call it!).  First of all, it is not typical Hollywoodized fare - the characters are all painfully real, down to the DCI who suffers from hay fever to the bookstore employee who walks with crutches.  The relationships are scripted and acted so well that you feel like you're watching a slice out of their lives, not actors performing roles.  And the acting is absolutely superb.  Amanda Burton is both chilling and sympathetic (a hard balance to acheive) and utterly believable.  The extremely likeable Paul McGann (Dr. Who, Horatio Hornblower) is such a perfectly bemused Ben Turner that you are left believing that this is what Paul McGann must be truly like.  However, the show is stolen (at least in my opinion) by the very handsome Christopher Villiars as the tortured DI Andrew Cannon, whose role, like everyone's, is fleshed out extremely well.  Also very notable is the fetching young Karis Copp, who gives an outstanding and surprisingly sensitive performance as 7-year-old Emmy.
Against the picturesque backdrop of a charming little Cotswolds village (a wonderful contrast to the ultimate evil of a murdered child) the story plays itself out at an unhurried pace, letting you savor the characters and live their lives alongside them as events unfold.  With each new revelation the plot twists and turns, culminating in a conclusion so disturbing that it kept me awake half the night pondering it.
My only complaints are the COMPLETE lack of any kind of extra features on the DVD, and the full-screen presentation (it was broadcast on PBS in widescreen).  But the story itself is without flaw, and these minor complaints do not take away from its impact.
Absolutely one of the most memorable and gripping stories you will ever watch.",1031788800,19,2208,4.9728260869565215
7946204,4,B00005N5R5,"What makes this British television film so strong is a combination of the acting and the emphasis on family.  Especially noteworthy is Amanda Burton as Rachel Monro, the woman who enters the family life of Ben and Nattie Turner to show both of them that the past cannot be escaped.
While the preservation in DVD format of the original film's three parts is a bit annoying--rather than following the entire story straight through--the strength of the film makes up for this quite a bit.  So even though you have to view Part I, then go back to the menu and view Part II, then Part III, it's worth it.  The plotting is strong, the pacing is well thought out, and, as mentioned, the acting does quite a bit to carry the tale.
A little girl is missing, and finally found dead.  A young couple, with a 7-year old daughter, becomes involved, thanks to the attentions of the mysterious Rachel Monro.  Soon the entire small village is aware of the supposed guilt of the husband, played well by Paul McGann.  But things are not as straightforward as they may seem: complicating the picture are a corrupt retired cop; another policeman, bitter due to a failing marriage; and Rachel Monro herself.
The revelation of the killer is not completely surprising, if you pay close attention.  What is surprising is that over the course of 2 1/2 hours, this holds up so well.  Most of the lead and primary supporting characters have families--their family bonds are critical to them, and to the tone and context of the film.
This is a good movie to see on a rainy Sunday afternoon, or on a long cold night when the nearby fire is warm enough to keep you where you are for a while.
Well done.",1006646400,17,1672,4.53156146179402
