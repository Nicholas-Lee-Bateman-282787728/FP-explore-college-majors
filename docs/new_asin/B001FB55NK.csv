3573353,5,B001FB55NK,"Not only did this movie come from a true story, but it was a great story.
And on top of this it was very well told with an all star cast including Forest Whitaker, Isaiah Washington, and others you'll recognize.

The movie shows just enough of Katrina footage to remind us of the travesty of the storm and our handling of the aftermath - but it does not over do it.  Then it moves on at a perfect pace to the story of rebuilding. It comes with inspiring words balanced with a real glimpse of the dirty and slow process it was in New Orleans.

It's crazy that this never hit the big screen because it was so good, because it was a true story, and because it had an Academy Award Winner and stars like Lil Wayne.

It really should sit on everyone's shelf along side your true story sports classics like The Blind Side, Hoosiers, More than a Game, Glory Road, Miracle, Cinderella Man, Brian's Song, and Remember the Titans.",1337990400,16,920,4.3313953488372094
3573354,5,B001FB55NK,This movie should have been seen on the big screen. The story we all know was sad due to the loss of so many lives during Hurricane Katrina. But the story of these students/basketball players and their coaches was inspiring. My sons and I have watched it at least 5 times since it aired on television and another 3 times since we purchased the DVD from Amazon.com,1325635200,9,363,4.432835820895522
