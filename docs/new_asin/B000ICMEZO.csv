8172433,5,B000ICMEZO,I don't consider it to be a downside if the film is in German with no translation since that is what I'm looking for to study German.  I appreciate your telling this because nothing is worse than buying a German film and all you get is some British announcer talking over the German language.  Thanks for your comments.,1168732800,7,319,4.482758620689655
8172434,5,B000ICMEZO,"A really, really nifty DVD for the modeler or any fan of the Kriegsmarine...  Here is a newsreel collection which contains many of the films seen by the German public prior to and during WWII.  The most thrilling for me were the U-boat films, but also on display here are newsreels about the E-boats, the cruiser Scharnhorst, and the Graf Spee being sunk by the British (this last one is actually an American newsreel, one of two non-German films on the disc).  The only downside is that the films are all in German with no translation or commentary, but then again that's also the fun of it -- you feel like you're really seeing history here.",1165795200,9,643,4.525862068965517
