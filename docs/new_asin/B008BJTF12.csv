5146098,4,B008BJTF12,"This DVD is an extremely welcome and long overdue addition to the virtually non-existent DVD treatment of Barnes and his glorious art collection.  However, this DVD is misleadingly titled.  Rather than THE BARNES COLLECTION, a more appropriate title for this DVD should probably be something like COLLECTING THE BARNES COLLECTION, or CREATING THE BARNES COLLECTION - because this DVD really does not comprehensively discuss the paintings in the Barnes collection, but I do not regard this DVD as being flawed because of its alternate focus.

After viewing this DVD, I greatly appreciate the focus this DVD does take.

Regarding this DVD's somewhat misleading title, this ""customer review"" presumes that perhaps the majority of visitors to the Barnes Collection are predominately if not exclusively interested in this collection's paintings, rather than about Dr. Barnes and, therefore, that persons may purchase this DVD with that predominate if not exclusive interest in mind.

After experiencing the Barnes Collection first hand, and reflecting on that incredibly unique experience, what may ultimately emerge in a reflective visitor's consciousness is the revelation that the subject of Dr. Albert Barnes, the multifaceted person and visionary, is an immensely more fascinating and instructive subject - and enduring, distinguished personal example - than Dr. Barnes' fabulously superb, ""in a unique, world-caliber class of its own,"" art collection.  This DVD facilitates - if not constitutes - such a revelation.

If a person is not a first-time visitor to the Barnes Collection, but has already personally experienced the Barnes art collection, and has reflected upon that experience, viewing THE BARNES COLLECTION DVD is not so much an ""introduction"" to the Barnes art collection, as this DVD is an ""introduction"" to Dr. Albert Barnes the brilliantly visionary art collector, as an appreciative, revelatory ""culmination"" or ""climax"" of a visitor's personal experience of the Barnes art collection itself.

One or two commentators in this DVD treat Dr. Albert Barnes' character as a conundrum, a psychologically incomprehensible ""Rubik's Cube.""  In fact, Dr. Albert Barnes was on the genius side of creativity, not only in science, business and visionary conceptualizations and institutional innovations regarding education, but also in regard to Dr. Barnes' creative magnum opus, his magnificent art collection.  A singularly fascinating aspect of Dr. Barnes' approach to art is the ""scientific method"" of reasoning and study which Dr. Barnes applied to this central aspect of his life's work.  Dr. Barnes' academic training in science and scientific reasoning clearly did not trump Dr. Barnes' dominant, overriding personal humanism, as this DVD clearly portrays.  Dr. Barnes' courageous and abiding humanism is what makes Dr. Barnes such a compelling person - and genius can lead to a lonely and isolated existence.

It was not in spite of, but because of, Dr. Barnes' overriding humanism that Dr. Barnes ""did not suffer fools gladly.""  Bravo!

In contrast to this DVD's sparse comments about the paintings which are the center piece of Dr. Barnes' art collection, this DVD appropriately discusses the iron metal work which Dr. Barnes conspicuously interposes among his paintings, and African ""masks"" which Dr. Barnes acquired and included in his art collection.

I enjoyed this DVD's informative content, and appreciated its unique perspective, including its coverage of the Barnes Collection's attractive new museum.  The commentators and commentary was excellent.  However this DVD would have significantly benefited from including some commentary, by art experts who are not staff members of the Barnes Foundation, regarding the stature and cultural value of the ""impressionist"" paintings in the Barnes Collection.

Parenthetically, the heated controversy about the re-location of the Barnes Collection from its original home in Marion, Pennsylvania (a suburb of Philadelphia), to downtown Philadelphia, is an extremely notable event which involves seriously significant cultural and legal issues - aside from being a particularly unique and fascinating story.  However, that controversy is an independent issue that is not relevant to the Barnes' art collection itself, and should be separately treated, apart from this DVD's focus on Dr. Barnes' creation of his art collection and associated educational foundation.

I believe Dr. Barnes would be enormously pleased, gratified, and feel thoroughly vindicated about the transfer of his art collection to its new, prestigious location in central Philadelphia, and the new museum's meticulously faithful honoring of Dr. Barnes' conception of displaying his collection's artwork.",1344988800,12,4739,5.646478873239436
5146099,4,B008BJTF12,"This 55-minute documentary was produced by Philadelphia's PBS TV station WHYY to coincide with the opening of the new Barnes Foundation art gallery in May 2012 on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, just a few blocks from the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It aired on PBS in August. If it wasn't so long, it might be the kind of film you would see in a small theater at the Barnes just before you viewed the collection. And, it is something that those visiting the Collection should see before they go, especially if they have never visited the Barnes Collection in its former (and original) home in Merion, PA (about 12 miles from the new location).

For those who have an appreciation for art - especially the ""Impressionist Period"" - and may not get to visit the new Barnes museum, you will learn a bit about Dr. Barnes and his collection but you won't know WHY it was moved from his estate to Center City Philadelphia. (more on that in a minute)

The film jumps around in time going from Barnes original purchases in Paris in the early 20th Century to the ""Art in the schools"" outreach program of the new Barnes Foundation (a section that probably belongs near the end, rather than the beginning) to interviews with the two New York architects - who, we learn in the film, had never visited the Merion location prior to submitting their proposal. Then we have comments from the construction workers as they construct the new building and comments from the curators at the new location. One this that is obviously missing is even one image of the new structure in relation to it's surroundings. I live in Philadelphia and there wasn't one scene there that would say to me ""Hey, that's Philadelphia"" or, ""the Rodin Museum is practically next door."" And the Philadelphia Museum of Art is never mentioned at all in the film.

The documents from the Barnes archives are fascinating to see - especially copies of the invoices with the prices Barnes paid for the works. And we hear excerpts of an undated radio interview with Barnes on WCAU radio taken from a transcription disc. Barnes written words from his autobiography are read by TV actor (and Philly resident) David Morse.

As noted above, this film was conceived as a promotion film for the new Museum and the politics of how this man's PRIVATE collection became a ""quasi-public"" institution is glossed over. For that story you need to see the 2010 documentary ""The Art of the Steal"" which I highly recommend. Taken together you get a full picture of Dr. Barnes, the Merion Collection and the new home of ""the largest collection of French Impressionist Art outside of  France"".

There are no supplemental or ""special features"" on the DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Barnes had the genius to amass an incredible collection of Impressionist art during its early stages.

8526603,1,B008BJTF12,"I was soooo looking forward to seeing this program.  I read about it months ago and noted the pbs airing date on my calendar.  When the date came around, my local pbs station, KQED, decided to bury it in the wee hours.  They showed it three or four times but not once earlier than 11pm which, with my schedule, meant I didn't get to see it.  I was able to obtain a copy before the official release date and watched it last night.  First of all, the title is a misleading come-on.  The program is NOT about the collection, it's about Dr. Barnes.  You see very few of the paintings in the collection, and primarily as something to show while boring people talk about Dr. Barnes.  Also, I was quite surprised at what short shrift they gave to the controversy surrounding moving the collection from Merion to Philadelphia.  If you didn't know anything about it before seeing the program, you'd think moving the collection had universal approval except, perhaps, for a couple of naysayers who objected for reasons that are either unknown or so inconsequential they needn't be mentioned.

In sum, recommended only for those who are interested in Dr. Barnes and not in his collection.  If you do decide to watch this show, I strongly recommend also watching The Art of the Steal to get some idea of why so many people were against the move.  For those interested in finding out about the actual collection, you'll have to settle for the book, Great French Paintings from the Barnes Foundation, or go to Philadelphia and see it yourself.",1345852800,34,1529,4.643122676579925
