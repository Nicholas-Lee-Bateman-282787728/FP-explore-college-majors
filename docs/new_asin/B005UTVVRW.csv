8508645,3,B005UTVVRW,"As I said, this isn't the North American release by Funimation. I don't know if it's an import or a bootleg, but in any case you're better off not wasting your money on it because Funimation has already confirmed that they're releasing OVAs 9 and 10 of Hellsing Ultimate this Fall. That version will most likely be a lot cheaper, it will most likely come with both the dub and sub, etc., so anyone who plans on owning OVAs 9 and 10 would probably be better off just waiting another few months.",1402272000,7,493,4.369565217391305
