208057,5,5819906179,"Incredible love story. This story has everything - the entire package - comedy, drama, and a moral love story, all handled with grace and sincerity. The producers of South Korean television truly get it. We watch television to escape reality, not be bombarded by it. The acting is second to none here in the United States and I look forward to watching more South Korean television",1436832000,7,381,4.787878787878788
208058,3,5819906179,"There is much to like with CUNNING SINGLE LADY.  The cunning lady is Na Ae Ra (Min Jung Lee).  But the title of ""cunning"" is one that is applied by others to her, all of whom assume that her actions are entirely motivated by a monomaniacal self-interest. Early on, we learn that she is happily married to Cha Jung Woo (Sang-wook Joo), who is a struggling and impoverished engineer trying to build a business from his own bare hands.  In the cinematic universe of Korean dramas, the need of many a male need to make his mark in Corporate Korea is overpowering. Cha Jung Woo is no exception. He has promised Na Ae Ra a life free from want and her concept of marital bliss is inexorably commingled with her love for him. Min Jung Lee is convincing as the young wife of a would be magnate. The problem that arises time and again in various forms is the conflict between what was promised and what was delivered. His promise of a life free from financial woe clashes with his unexpected decision to quit a salaried job to start his own firm.  He fails and both are reduced to penury. Na Ae Ra feels cheated and deceived so she divorces him in a manner that smacks of deliberate cruelty. She literally throws him out with no place for him to go.  At this point, Na Ae Ra is less cunning but more vindictive.  She sets in motion the plot driver of love twisted into hate with Cha Jung Woo determined to be a Korean Gatsby who will succeed if only to prove that his wife made a colossal blunder in abandoning him at the point that he viewed as inexcusably cruel.

As CUNNING SINGLE LADY continues past the first few episodes of a 16 episode run, the viewer can detect the general flow of theme and tone. The theme is can love be buried under a mish-mash of poorly thought out revenge and counter-revenge? This theme dominates until the very last episode.  It is the tone that varies markedly.  The first few episodes use flashbacks to set a tone of early hope marred by unwise bickering over establishing one's destiny. Quickly enough, there is a shift to drama as Na Ae Ra is now herself impoverished and is stunned to learn that Cha Jung Woo has channeled his rage at being unceremoniously dumped into becoming the fabulously successful CEO of a software giant. Determined to spite him by forcing him to admit that his success is due more to her than to his own initiative, she connives to get a job as an intern in his firm.  For most of the movie's middle parts, the tone is an odd mixture of screwball comedy set as a backdrop of retribution in which Cha Jung Woo is equally fixated on proving that his success is a function of his genius rather than her bitterness at her earlier marital poverty.

The cunning of the title slowly arises as Na Ae Ra's co-workers suspect that something is going on between her and her ex-husband.  No one suspects that they were married. They assume that she is merely using her feminine wiles to advance her career. During her internship, there is the usual assortment of subplots commonly found in Korean romantic dramas. Cha Jung Woo's best friend falls in love with Na Ae Ra.  His female director loves Cha Jung Woo but he sees her only as a valued manager. Na Ae Ra's family loathes him as they understandably take her side.  The family of the female director want her to marry him.

The tone shifts for a third time in the last several episodes. Cha Jung Woo morphs from a hard-headed realist to a mushy-headed love sick puppy dog who remembers his love for his ex-wife.  It is difficult to accept this change in his view of an ex-wife who has alternated between making his life miserable on a personal level to one who accepts that professionally speaking she truly is a boon to his firm. In the last two episodes one can almost predict how matters will sort themselves out.  Still the chemistry between the leads is so evident that one can almost overlook the occasionally shoddy scripting that pushes the actors into their accustomed slots such that by the last episode the inevitable re-unification of the lovers brings to mind the forced gaiety of a Shakespearean early comedy.  I give CUNNING SINGLE LADY a cautious thumbs up mostly because I admired how the leads bounced off one another (sometimes literally) to produce a romantic comedy that even in its most somber moments dared pose the annoying question of where broken promises begin and forgiveness for them ends.",1433808000,,4413,4.529559748427673

After 4 years of working multiple part time jobs and sinking deeply into debt, she divorces him. 2 years later he is the CEO of a software company that he started and she is desperate for a full time job and gets a job as an intern in one of the departments there.  As usual there are a number of subplots that keep it interesting. My only complaint is that there is occasionally a line o f type in Korean streaming under the English subtitles (perhaps news or ads) but after the first bit, it doesn't intrude much.",1447027200,2,632,4.258333333333334
