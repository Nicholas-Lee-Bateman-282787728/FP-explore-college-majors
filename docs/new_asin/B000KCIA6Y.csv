8155578,4,B000KCIA6Y,"This is really good quality animation, my kids love to watch this on the big screen even my husband. However even though i had the Towel of Babel 3 dvd's box that had Genesis and Noah's ark and even the brothers in war so after this i thought the next DVD box serie (GENESIS) supposed to have what the other one do not have so i ordered the other one and plus the Rain of Fire one so now i have two Rain of Fires and two Genesis and brothers at war and Noah's ark....The animation is good but there is no new testament even though i believe in not making the image of God or the Son of God, they should make New Testament ones with our Savior's face as light(like they did God's image/voice as a light after Cain killed his brother) and make the rest of NT and more OT then  i highly would buy it to be honest even though i was complaining about the price before i'm happy with my purchases now:)!!!",1342569600,,899,4.0790960451977405
