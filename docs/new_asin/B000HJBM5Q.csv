It has a little of everything and everything is in its place. Like a giant puzzle where all the pieces fit and not even one is missing. No loose ends, no nonsense.
The two parallel stories join when we least expect it and after all we have seen and laugh we are sure there's more. We just don't know if it will keep the level or will go higher.
P. Tinto (Luis Ciges) and his wife had tried everything in the book to have a child, to no avail. They need children to take care of them and the family business. One of the problems is that ''dad'' never told ''son'' about the flowers and the bees and when ''son'' heard it through the grapevines, he got everything wrong.
The couple move to a lonely place where the train passes every 25 years. Pray to God for a miracle and one day they get it. Two cute little martians arrive at their door and they take them as their own. Now they're happy but could be happier, so they write to the African Embassy in order to adopt a little orphan from over there.
I need to stop here. Everything is hilarious and you have to see it to enjoy it!",1316649600,2,1149,4.111111111111111
