8367633,1,B002EEKUWS,"You gotta be kidding.  This is a real POS.  The acting sucks, the production values are amateurish at best, the plot drags and is about as predictable as a sunrise.  Did I mention boring?  Lose this turkey.",1456704000,,206,4.486486486486487
8367634,3,B002EEKUWS,"I won't say I made a bad purchase on this one......but I could & will say that I could have made a far BETTER purchase with this particular duo of movies.  I purchased this at another retailer, mainly because I am a HUGE HP Lovecraft fan & having a movie titled ""Beyond The Dunwich Horror"" in my film collection is definately a boon.
  I was NOT impressed by it by any means.  Low budget z-rate movie I can handle (I have ALOT of them), but little to no redeeming quality.....OY!!!!
  Pretty Dead Thing I found to be a bit more palitable.  I kinda enjoyed it.  While Low budget in the extreme, it doesn't take itself seriously.  And actually has a few moments that are really funny in the slapstick sense.
  So one movie I didn't really like (Beyond The Dunwich Horror) & One I Kinda Liked (Pretty Dead Things).",1393459200,,811,4.375838926174497

8367636,5,B002EEKUWS,Anyone who's a fan of Richard Griffin movies will enjoy this. It's a bit of a step away from the crazy goofiness of a lot of his films since it is based on a H.P. Lovecraft story. BUT it does have a bit of the wackiness mixed in with the seriousness of the story so it's not a totally dark feature. I thoroughly enjoyed the changes in mood and just lent my copy to a friend whom I'm sure will enjoy this film as much as I did.,1282694400,3,426,3.852272727272727
