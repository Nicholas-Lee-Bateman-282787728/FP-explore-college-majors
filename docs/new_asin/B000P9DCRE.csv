8189924,5,B000P9DCRE,"This is one of the most compelling UFO documentaries I have ever seen. If someone doesn't believe that people who are reliable witnesses occasionally see something that is beyond conventional explanation, they need to watch this video. I hope Discovery Channel re-releases this video on DVD or better, Blu Ray as it is currently unavailable. This video shows a scientific investigation of a sighting made by several different law enforcement officers from three different departments, that was also seen on radar..",1455926400,,514,5.3580246913580245
8189925,5,B000P9DCRE,"This video will probably be more interesting to the UFO enthusiast than to the casual viewer just wanting to see and hear a good UFO story.  The sightings that took place over southern Illinois in the early morning hours of January 5, 2000, do make for an interesting story, but the focus of this video is indeed ""the anatomy of a sighting,"" the process by which investigators went about studying this case in the absence of any video or significant photographic evidence (one Polaroid shot was taken of the object, but it is rather unrevealing).

There were six primary witnesses of this particular unidentified flying object, four of them police officers from four separate jurisdictions.  A trucker first spotted the UFO just before 4 AM on January 5, 2000, and alerted the local police dispatcher.  Then, as the object made its way south-southwest across the Illinois skies, police officers from the localities of the corresponding towns reported their own sightings of the object.  We have the tape of these calls to the dispatcher.  The final witness was a teacher traveling to work just before 7 AM.  While witness testimony naturally differed slightly (the first and last witnesses saw a more box-like structure, whereas the policemen described the object as having the shape of an arrowhead), important correlations did exist in their individual descriptions.

In the absence of any substantial video or photographic evidence, investigators hired an animation specialist to recreate the sightings.  Besides the careful interviewing all of the witnesses, extensive surveying of the areas of each sighting were undertaken and brought to bear on the eventual animation.  Still, of course, no explanation is forthcoming for the sightings.  The policemen are especially careful to describe what they saw without making conjectures, and the animation specialist stresses the fact that his job was to recreate the sightings, not to explain them.  With local military bases insisting nothing of theirs was in the air that night, though, the viewer is basically left with just two possibilities - either this was some type of experimental craft (perhaps something along the lines of a stealth blimp) or else it was something from another world.",1191110400,,2244,5.2027777777777775
