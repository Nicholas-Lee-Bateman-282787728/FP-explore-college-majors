2292874,5,B0009I8PHS,"On available record, the great Austrian conductor Karl Boehm had three Enthurung recordings: the 1945 mono with Dermota/Schwarzkopf; the 1974 with Schreier/Auger/Grist, and this his last opera conducting in 1980.
So you see, this was Karl Boehm's last opera conducting, and the emotional side of the whole thing WAS evident.  Boehm came out at the end of curtain calls all by himself, saluting the orchestra members.  It was a very moving event by istelf.
Back to the performance.  A special event is a special event.  There is no need, absolutely no need, to prick the legend and excruciate imperfections, which there WERE, given the high tension of the event.
The singers here, with the exception of Reri Grist, are all in their prime.  As Konstanze, Gruberova is very capable vocally, but she did not give a perfect performance.  Her duet with Belmonte at the last Act is one-sided and there was no chemistry between her and Araiza at all.
As Blonde, Reri Grist was slightly past prime, having sung her first Blonde more than two decades earlier. Her affinity with the role, however, remains.
Tavela's performance is starry, delivering drama both in voice and in acting, and his physical height is the greatest fun-poking element.
The two men Belmonte and Pedrillo are the real gems of this performance. Two tenors with distinct timbres and vocal qualities deliver the pair respectively in completely convincing terms.
That Francisco Araiza is the best Belmonte since Wunderlich is without a single doubt, and is unsurpassed till this very day.
It is a shame that he found so little chemistry with Edita Gruberova in this performance.",1350345600,2,1637,5.022140221402214
2292875,3,B0009I8PHS,"Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail recently has been such a rediscovery for me - listening to it live suddenly explained eloquently what an abduction of his own life Mozart did with this extraordinary opera, escaping the ungrateful labor camp of Archbishop Colloredo of Salzburg.  Die Entfhrung hears as a firework to the liberation and triumphal entry in Vienna, where coincidentally Emperor Joseph's famous Edict of Tolerance was introduced in the year in which this opera was created - 1781.

The ideas of the Enlightenment were obviously illustrated by Mozart and his librettist Johann Gottlieb Stephanie the younger through the character of Pasha Selim.  Stephanie used already known  sources for this opera - a libretto by Christoph Friedrich Bretzner ""Belmont und Constanze oder die Entfhrung aus dem Serail (Belmont and Constanze, or the Abduction from the Seraglio), which had been preceded by the opera semi-seria ""La schiava Liberata (The Liberated Slave Girl), with a text by Gaetano Martinelli, first set to music by Niccolo Jommelli in 1768.  Also it is worth mentioning the Turkish theme was very popular in France as well, even thought Paris was not besieged by the Turks as Vienna was in 1683 - Christoph Willibald Gluck had two operas created on the theme: Le cadi dupe (The Cadi Deceived) (1761) and ""La recontre imprevue, ou Les pelerins de Mecque"" (The Unexpected Meeting, or The Pilgrims to Mecca) (1764), with the latter enjoying great popularity in Vienna.  In 1783, Mozart, in Gluck's presence, improvised, on the basis of a popular basso buffo sung in the first act of ""Les pelerins de Mecque"",  the exquisite piano variations, KV 455 (""unser dummer Pobel meint"").  It is a shame that Marie-Antoinette preferred Gluck over Mozart as a court composer.

Now back to Mozart's opera - the librettist Stephanie extended Pasha Selim's goodness beyond Bretzner's ideas.  Pasha Selim is not a Turk, but a Christian who converted the Turkish Islam; if in Bretzner's version Belmonte turns out to be Selim's own son, Stephanie&Mozart  bestow Pasha Selim with truly sublime nobility - his benevolence towards his enemy's son, his unreal virtue probably suppose to celebrate the new era of an enlightened ruler, in a person of the future Emperor Joseph II, great admirer and benefactor of Mozart.

This could be another reason why Pasha Selim does not sing, although it remains an enigma why Mozart&Stephanie left Selim's part unsung;  another possibility is that there was no suitable singer at Mozart's disposal at that time; and also, the spoken part could be left just to promote the idea of Singspiel which appealed much to Joseph II, who considered this genre as an awakening of national feeling.  Joseph II welcomed Singspiel as an opportunity to teach correct German to multi-ethnic population of Vienna, and to strengthen national pride by means of popular stage works.  The Burgtheater, where the premier took place on July 16 1782, was raised to the statue of ""royal and imperial national theater"" in 1777, five years before the premier.  Before the Die Entfhrung, the most successful Singspiel was Die Jagd (The Chase, 1774), with a text by Christian Felix Weisse (1732-1804) and music by Adam Hiller (1728-1804) - another sad example of a baroque composer totally forgotten by today (but hopefully, resurrected one day in today's baroque revival trend).

Next interesting character is Osmin.  The first Osmin, Johann Ignaz  Ludwig Fischer, was a star of the Viennese opera scene. ""his voice had the depth of the violoncello and the natural height of the tenor (its range was C-a)"".  Osmin is on the side of evil, yet the means he uses are inappropriate, so that his effect is comic but also uncanny.  With him, Mozart extends the boundaries of a buffo character; this opera was supposed to make one heavily entertained, on a lighter, humorous side.  And here is an opportune moment, with all the aforementioned history of this masterpiece, to assess this production.

I approached this production with great anticipation, how else - such a star-studded cast, big names.  But from the opening moment, it was already somewhat unpleasant - the ovation Karl Bohm is given from the beginning is so excessive that it is already a warning sign that whatever is to come will be met with elation.  The overture was played perfectly; but then the action enfolds.  However,  everyone is behaving as a fearful pupil putting up the best performance, scared of punishment if something goes wrong.  It feels as  some members of Politburo are in the theater, so stiff, proper and strict it is, afraid to overstep some agreed boundaries of what is allowed for an important serious audience.  Definitely the director did not want to be blamed for deviant ways, or entartete Kunst, which with Karl Bohm as the maestro is not unexpected, alas.  Everyone seems to behave as knowing well what this conductor could do; no trifling here.

Francisco Arazia (Belmonte) is flawless and agreeable in singing, but acts so timidly and artificially;  Osmin (Martti Talvela)  is NOT FUNNY at all, despite solid singing.  Pedrillo (Norbert Orth) is barely adequate.  Reri Grist (Blonde) is near disasterous, with her voice screeching at times, having problems with volume and overall not producing pleasant sounds at all.  The scene of ""Durch Zartlichkeit und Schmeicheln"" is oh-so-proper, with a screen for Osmin's bath!  But it is boring to watch.  The public gives an applause after each aria, but is obviously bored, erupting in laughter later on, in an episode with a ladder, which is rather goofy.  All that constant hand-clapping is something quite bothersome and annoying, and indeed unfortunately happens in Munich too many times - but not in Vienna, luckily.

And finally, the most illustrious soprano aria ever written by Mozart ""Martern aller Arten"" arrives.  Edita Gruberova's voice is perfect, as always, but she is visibly, or rather, audibly, catching up with the orchestra, or vice versa, as the tempo was not well-set, or maybe she and Karl Bohm did not rehearse enough; or maybe they over-rehearsed it; but a few times one can see and hear distinctly that she and the orchestra are not singing in tandem - she is either too early or too late, and it is heard, and even her eyes are blinking confusedly.  That was quite an astonishment in such an blown-out-of-proportion rave-reviewed programme performance.

The Mozart  music makes up for it all, as always, and Bohm at times conducts it very movingly, especially during the despairing duet "" Welch ein Geschick! O Qual der Seele!""; we hear incomparable anguish of Mozart, so exquisitely beautiful, sincere and expressive; here the despair is extreme, and the musical language is different from simply melancholic arias at the beginning of the opera; Mozart finds amazing ways, as he always does, to express true mortal danger and imminent demise.  All that only stresses the overjoy that follows.

There are so many references to future operas, and Rossini too heavily borrowed for his many First Act finales from ""Marsch! Trollt euch fort!""  Osmin-Belmonte-Pedrillo Trio.  The quartet of faithfulness""Doch ach! Bei aller Lust"" is a precursor to Cosi fan Tutte, the dialog mixed with music to Die Zauberflte, and  many times Konstanze sounds like Donna Anna.

It is certain that this production is overall a classic and beneficial one.  But it lacks thrill and excitement;  it is disappointing that among DVDs available for this opera, there is no really a perfect one; all recorded productions are somewhat inadequate and have severe flaws.  This is why it is important to see this opera live whenever possible.

And I was lucky in that; for me this particular opera has a special significance - after being besieged in Vienna in March this year by Eugene of Savoy, a final liberator of central Europe from  a century and a half of Turkish occupation and from Ottoman menace in Vienna, with his equestrian statue galloping into me  from the center of Hofburg, chasing me towards his lavish Belvedere palace, I ended up in Berlin, in Schiller Theater, where I have heard this opera live.  Again, perhaps because it is the first Vienna opera of Mozart just escaped from Salzburg captivity and artistic abuse,  it is so incredibly rich in music - after being in the theater and listening to it live for one hour, I simply began to suffocate from the avalanche of beauty;  they played the whole thing in ONE PIECE in Berlin, without an entracte, and suddenly one realises what ""too many notes, my dear Mozart"" meant.  It truly feels as submerging below the vast ocean of genius drowning you in tsunami of magical sounds, sung by angels.

Being at Die Entfhrung in Berlin's Schiller Theater this year, I could see what a different approach is taken today to this masterpiece, and what is amazing of our epoch that singers whose names would not resonate with most people sing with the same quality or better that the stars of the past.  This is one positive thing that a sound-video-recording revolution had produced - a phenomenal quality of singing and music performing that we enjoy today.  I uploaded some parts of that production on Youtube (see comments for link)

The modern singer Anna Prohaska is so much superior to Reri Grist, and others too are interesting to compare to this Bohm-Gruberova production, although in Schiller Theater it was done without fanfare, pomp and circumstance - and it was in many ways more satisfying performance.  Hopefully there will be a DVD with that and many contemporary productions.

All in all, this production is recommended as a benchmark and a classic, but it lacks true liveliness, charm, wittiness and humor, robbing Mozart of his essence.",1309910400,6,9741,5.013051584835301
2292876,4,B0009I8PHS,"The program notes tell us that this 1980 Munich production was ""hotly contested"" by the opening night audience, and that filming was delayed until the third evening. Apparently some liked the high level of slapstick in the staging, and some found it offensive. ""Die Entfhrung"" is a problematic work in its uneasy balance between the serious and comic and in its theatrical pacing. Mozart hadn't yet learned that long, elaborate arias, however beautiful, can impede the progress of the drama. I don't mind seeing the whole thing lightened up a bit by the droll visual jokes.
The excellent cast is led by the Konstanze of Edita Gruberova, who sings her very demanding music with aplomb (including the major challenge of ""Traurigkeit"" and ""Martern aller Arten"" back-to-back), and creates a sympathetic character. She is well partnered by Francisco Araiza's noble Belmonte; he was a fine Mozart tenor, with a lovely lyric line. Too bad his biggest aria, ""Ich baue ganz"", was cut. The servant couple is also well cast. Reri Grist is a pert, feisty Blonde, and Norbert Orth a good comic Pedrillo. Grist avoids the famous high E in her first aria; I would guess the note simply wasn't working on that particular evening. The Osmin is Martti Talvela, and it's fun to see the great Finnish bass in a comic role. He splutters effectively, sings his music beautifully, and his massive frame is the source of a few jokes - as when he towers over the diminutive Araiza. The conductor is the redoubtable veteran Karl Bhm. I never cared much for his Mozart, which featured an unpalatable mixture of rhythmic rigidity and soft-edged articulation. But the problem here is his tempos, which tend to speed up and slow down unpredictably, sometimes catching the singers by surprise. The program notes praise Bhm's flexibility, but it sounds to me as though he has difficulty sustaining a steady tempo. But, at age 86, he was nearing the end of a long and distinguished career, and perhaps we should give him a break. In any case, the beautiful singing largely makes up for his inconsistency.
In short, a beautifully sung and thoroughly enjoyable performance. Recommended.",1280188800,9,2151,4.94475138121547
2292877,5,B0009I8PHS,"I didn't expect such a glorious Abduction when I sat down with friends to watch this DVD. Re-releases of such old productions (1980) are often plagued by stiff camera work, unbalanced recording, and/or outmoded vocal technique. This offering from Deutsche Grammophon has none of those flaws. Thus I rushed here to the keyboard, to proclaim the excellence of my ""discovery"" to the world, only to find that Mike Birman has already written everything I wanted to say, and in 2006! Bravo, Mike!

The only addition I can make is to call attention to the role of Thomas Holtzmann as Pasha Selim, the pivotal character in this operatic sermon of Enlightenment values. Holtzmann conveys just the right measure of despotic arrogance in the first two acts so that his noble gesture of tolerance becomes both powerful and plausible in the third act. After the DVD viewing, I asked my friends what they thought of Selim's singing. They were predictably somewhat reticent; not one of them had realized that Selim never sings. The role of the Pasha is spoken only.

On the other hand, the role of Osmin is so prominent that a good actor can effectively steal the show from the two romantic couples. Martti Talvela was born to sing and act Osmin. A huge bear of a basso, he manages to carry the opera's humor to hilarious extremes without overwhelming or upstaging the fine performances of Reri Grist as his slave Blonde or Norbert Orth and his rival and foil Pedrillo.

If you have a friend who needs to be converted to the joys of opera, and particularly of opera on DVD, you couldn't find a better choice than this flawless evening's entertainment.",1207699200,45,1636,4.773851590106007
2292878,5,B0009I8PHS,"Karl Bohm is very old by the time he conducted this performance. During curtain calls, he was virtually escorted up the stage by Gruberova and Grist.
For quite some time after Bohm, there weren't many dedicated conductors for Mozart's operas, the most dedicated one being Leopold Hager followed by Nicolas Harnoncourt of Austria.
Edita Gruberova, who sang a lot under Harnoncourt, was just starting her career as a Mozartian in this production. Her Konstanz is very securely delivered, if not outright outstanding. And she was a real gem to watch - voluptuously beautiful in the lowcut cream satin dress.
Francisco Araiza sang Belmonte with a bright, ardent tone that eclipsed second-rate interpretors like Ernst Haefliger before him. His voice hasn't yet grown harsh in this recording, and it is a real treat for the ears, even if his stagecraft was on the stiff side.
Orth and Grist made a charming secondary pair.
The star of this show, however, goes to Martti Talvela as the ominously difficult to sing Osmin.
Talvela is such a joy to watch and a delight to hear - full of comedy and drama.  His duet with Reri Grist when he was bathing is outright hilarious and deathly funny. His later duet with Orth is another high light of the opera. Not to mention his final solo aria that demanded a real virtuoso's skill.
This is a very respectable historical production, showing the singers in their prime, and the conductor's veteran skills as a seasoned Mozartian. Any one who misses Bohm and Talvela must get this DVD.",1174262400,38,1517,4.834615384615384
2292879,5,B0009I8PHS,"[This review is for the Karl Bohm version on DGG and not for the Glyndebourne version. Amazon has mistakenly placed the DGG reviews on the wrong page as well as the correct one. I will try to alert them. Perhaps others can do so as well.]

Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail or The Abduction from the Seraglio was composed by Mozart in 1782 during his first heady days in Vienna. He'd recently thrown off the shackles of provincial Salzburg and his odious servitude under the Prince-Archbishop Colloredo. This Singspiel (song-play) was first performed at the Burgtheater in Vienna, and is the wellspring of the famous story about Mozart's postperformance meeting with Emperor Joseph II in which the illustrious Enlightenment ruler uttered his famous critique: ""Too beautiful for our ears and monstrous many notes, my dear Mozart"". Mozart supposedly replied ""Exactly as many as necessary, your majesty"".

Joseph II had founded a National Singspiel Company in 1778 which was designed to promote German culture in Vienna where the predominant culture, at least among the aristocracy, was French. The work, Mozart's first imperial operatic commission, combines elements of Italian opera seria, opera buffa and even folklike German song. It is a truly new amalgam of elements with lovely melodies and gentle humor that still manages to entertain. Mozart would perfect this recipe nearly a decade later in his last Singspiel, ""The Magic Flute"". Die Entfuhrung features a wonderful, fairly complex Act II finale: a dramatic technique Mozart famously utilized with even greater success 4 years later in le Nozze di Figaro. It enables him to heighten the drama while deftly exploring the characters of multiple onstage protagonists simultaneously. This dramatic technique was truly new: a nail into the heart of static opera seria for which the da Ponte operas would be the hammer. It is the source of a new Romantic spirit in music, the full flowering of which was decades away. And the Turkish elements in the opera represented the continuing fascination of the Viennese with those same Turks who had invaded Austria not too many years earlier. This Turkish exoticism is another element in nascent Romanticism. This humble little Singspiel's importance should not be minimized.

Karl Bohm conducts the Chorus and Orchestra of the Bayerischen Staatsoper with the right balance of serious purpose and light lilting lyricism. This production, staged by August Everding with set and costume design by Max Bignens, was filmed from a live television production relayed on the First Programme (Channel 1) of German television on 25 April 1980. Bohm was nearly 86 years of age at the time and had first conducted this work in 1924. He was a true Mozartean who mastered Mozart's youthful, bubbling music while also revealing the ineffably sad, emotionally ambiguous drama that lays just underneath. It is a volatile mixture that can evaporate or combust in a conductor's face if not approached properly. Mozart has been described as too easy for beginners, too difficult for experts. Bohm was an expert who evoked a beginner's Mozart: he made the difficult sound easy. He is the real star of this excellent DVD.

The singers are superb. Thomas Holtzmann is Selim, Belmonte is Francisco Araiza. Konstanze is Edita Gruberova. Blonde is sung by the wonderful Reri Grist. Pedrillo is sung by Norbert Orth and Osmin is Martti Talvela. The production is relatively  traditional, extremely colorful and fun to watch. I've enjoyed it immensely every time I've watched it.

This DVD has a picture format of NTSC color shot fullscreen with a 4:3 format. Region code is 0 worldwide. The film is crystal clear with no discernable video artifacts. It appears to be digitally remastered. Sound formats are PCM stereo and DTS 5.1 Digital Surround sound. Both formats sound great with the DTS Surround providing ambiance from the rear speakers and good spatial location of instruments and voices. Menu language is English. Subtitles are in German, English, French, Spanish and Chinese. Total time of the disc is 146 minutes. There are no extras other than DGG promos.

This is an excellent version of Mozart's Abduction. Those familiar with Karl Bohm know what to expect. Those who don't know him will find this disc a nice introduction. Strongly recommended.

8061247,4,B0009I8PHS,"Could you really put this opera on today, in the current political climate, I wonder?  Yes, Bassa Selim comes out looking good, but Osmin is grossly caricatured, and so is his religion.  I know it's a comedy -- but still . . . Anyway: here's Karl Bohm in 1980, at 86, looking frail, in Munich, a year before his death, conducting a warm and lively performance and with a good cast, it all comes over quite well.  The sound can be a bit congested in ensembles, at least on my equipment, but not enough to be seriously troubling.  The great pleasure was hearing the young Edita Gruberova as Constanze, sounding a bit careful in places but well in command of the very demanding music and looking good in a dark wig.  Reri Grist is Blonde and she sings with spirit.  It's possible that we under-rated her in her prime (she's just a few years younger than Leontyne Price), thinking of her mainly as Oscar in ""Ballo,"" though I remember seeing her as a very credible Gilda in 1972, with Wixell at the Met.  Francisco Araiza sings a good, straightforward Belmonte (the wretched ""Ich baue ganz"" mercifully cut), and Martii Talvela has great fun as Osmin.  The dignified Bassa Selim is well-taken by Thomas Holtzmann.  There are a lot of good ""Entfuhrungs"" on CD, and this one won't make you forget Simoneau or Wunderlich as Belmonte, or Auger as Constanze, not to mention the enlivening conducting of Beecham and Davis on their respective sets, but I'm glad to have it, political incorrectness and all.",1492646400,,1493,4.64638783269962

What a pity no videos exist of the great Josef Greindl performing as Osmin!  His audio recording under Fricsay is second to none.

8061253,2,B0009I8PHS,"I didn't even bother watching past the first act. From the overture there is a problem with the balance, most likely due to the recording rather than the orchestra. The high instruments and percussion sound very loud, and the bass instruments (particularly basses and low register of cellos) are nearly inaudible. This problem continues past the overture. I don't really like the singers either. Araiza sounds like the stereotypical tenor who doesn't really have a clue what he's doing (I generally dislike him though). Near the end of the first act, Gruberova sounds heavy and labored in Konstanze's aria.

Instead of this, I would recommend the recording with Harnoncourt conducting in Zurich, although it is only audio. The singers are great, tempi are appropriate, and the orchestra plays well.",1416096000,,798,5.186046511627907
