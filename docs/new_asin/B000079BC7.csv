1802794,2,B000079BC7,"DEath Valley is a very low budget horror film about a cursed ghost town of Sweet Valley.  After the civil war, the residents hung the sister of a Confederate raider by the name of Bloody Bill Anderson.  Bill sets his revenge on the town until he is actually captured, shot numerous times, and burned in his coffin.  But even that can't keep Bill down as he still haunts the town as an undead zombie, turning all who mistakenly roam into the town as flesheaters themselves.

Enter now a group of college students who are on their way to a debate along with their coach.  Now if this group could muster a 200 IQ between the six of them I'd be very surprised, let alone this bunch of jarheads actually being a debate team.  A car-jacker/drug trafficker named Earl...out in the middle of the desert no less...takes over their van as he is searching for his missing partner and they end up in the ghost town.  Well soon all hell breaks loose and zombies run, ala 28 Days Later, at the group from all sides, taking them down with Bloody Bill directing traffic.  The group makes no attempt to get back in the van and leave even though there appear to be numerous opportunities.  Jerry, is bitten by a zombie early on and spends the bulk of the film overacting with his screams while a dim-witted Mandy keeps asking him to tell her what's wrong...What's Wrong?  He was bitten by a FEAKING ZOMBIE, you twit, that's what's wrong!

The make-up is fairly mediocre at best but the hide it by not giving you many closeups of the zombies and when they do they are very fleeting as the zombies zoom past.  Add to that there is an annoying, pounding, heavy metal sidetrack that starts whenever the zombies attack that is repetitive and kills any atmosphere that may have been building.

One thing you can generally count on with low-budget films is the inclusion of some good, female eye-candy.  But not here.  The female stars are average at best and the lead female character, Gwen, is downright unattractive.  Add to that is that this is the first or second film for most of the cast including the two leads and it all adds up to a subpar film.  It's not completely horrible.  It's certainly better than House of the Dead which received widescreen release a couple of years ago, but there isn't anything that really stands out as being above average.  I suppose one positive is that the filmed is pretty much filmed all during the day...since it's always near sunset in ""Sunset"" so they didn't use the cheap trick of filming in the dark to hide any inadequacies.

All in all a weak to marginal low budget horror film",1113177600,5,2602,4.519230769230769
7974417,1,B000079BC7,"The debate club on their way to Arizona gets high jacked by a drug dealer looking for his money and blow. They end up in Sunset Valley which has been cursed by Bloody Bill. Low budget zombie/slasher type film. Chelsea Jean had most of the lines setting her up for ""the final girl."" Lots of zombies chases, attacks and blood. Flashbacks done in grainy films as if they actually filmed this after the Civil War.  Why do cursed zombies pass on zombie traits with a bite? It is not a viral infection.

One of the better 1 star films, for what that's worth. Sound track good at times.",1462838400,,579,4.351851851851852
7974418,5,B000079BC7,"Excellent science-oriented introduction to Death Valley, visually impressive. I've spent several days exploring Death Valley but found in watching the video there was a lot I didn't know about. Tourist attractions like Scotty's Castle, Zabriskie Point, and Furnace Creek, with its inn, are not in evidence here; the focus is on teaching, not entertainment.  Highly recommended for people interested in adventure, wildlife, geology, and the survival of the planet.",1458864000,,463,5.7101449275362315

7974421,2,B000079BC7,I bought this disc for the interactive map but I have had trouble accessing it.  I have an iMac with Mavericks but National Geographic maps apparently isn't designed to work with the new Mac OS's.  I can open the map but I can't use all its features.  Or at least I haven't figured out how to yet.  I took it to the Apple store and consulted a One on One trainer.  He c/n figure it out either.  Disappointing,1396137600,,408,4.166666666666667

7974424,5,B000079BC7,"From the first words this DVD grabs you, unlike many educational films. It speaks of sand dunes that hum/sing, rocks that move and leave trails, creatures that glow in the dark.
For much of the film I found my myself open mouthed at the extremes of what and how the living things exist in this park where the temperature has reached 134 degrees - the hottest ever recorded in the US.
There are several basic areas that are covered here on the last days of the park super indent's tour - the plants that might only live for a few weeks in a year or more, the animals that sometimes need no drinking water at all.
Yes all the scientists that study this area are worried about global warming, but the message here is the valley itself and all that still even baffles scientists. Yes they, like most other scientists that study the natural wonders of the earth are worried, just a degree average warming and living creatures that are already at the extreme edge of their existence will be no more - that includes polar bears and many others.
But what is focused on here are the questions: Why are so many plants dying? Why do rocks move and leave trails, when no one has seen them move? Why is there sound coming from the inside of some of  the sand dunes. Why are one of the most endangered species of fish that live no where else except in an underground cave - Devil's hole dying out even though the area is fenced off and video monitored 24 hours a day to keep out people?
All are shown as the scientists examine and attempt to find out the answers to all their questions, after all as it is said...we ignore the smallest and most vulnerable of us at our peril",1254355200,5,1660,4.337620578778135
7974425,1,B000079BC7,"I ordered this new DVD for my mother-in-law's birthday, and a copy of one for us.  My husband's relatives discovered DeathValley and I thought this would give the story of and a tour of Death Valley.  It was all about how global warming is ruining everything in Death Valley.  We did not like it for the most part, there were some interesting things to learn about, but it all went back to global warming.  We would not recommend it.",1251072000,11,433,4.443037974683544
