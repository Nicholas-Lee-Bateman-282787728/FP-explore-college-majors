8265318,2,B00177Y9R0,"Two petty thieves and a prostitute (?) decide they want to strike the big one. They kidnap a young girl and fly off to a safe house in the grasslands of South America where the cannibals live. The thieves insult their host and become feed stock.

The dubbing was bad. Sometimes people are ""talking"" when their lips are not moving. The ""Indian"" dancing left something to be desired. If you are going to restore the film, get rid of the corny soundtrack. There is a spicy extra of a deleted scene where a woman dances and strips.

2 stars for the camp value.

F-word, sex, rape, nudity.",1463184000,,584,4.4392523364485985
8265319,4,B00177Y9R0,"Yes, this movie deserves bad reviews.  It's not super gory, nor is it well shot or scary.  But it's sort of like a funny b-movie.  If you can dig so bad it's good, this movie gets half-way there.  Bad, certainly, but fun if you've got that kind of sense of humor.",1398124800,,263,4.098039215686274
8265320,1,B00177Y9R0,"The cannibal horror movie sub-genre is a popular one for low budget film makers, as like zombie films, it doesn't take that much cash to make movies in both styles that are at least moderately convincing. But alas, even that small amount of effort was not put into this cinematic cow pie. I could fill the entire running time of this film talking about what's wrong with it, but rather than bore your brain needlessly, I'll hit the high points, or low, as it were.

1. The voice of the little girl is dubbed by an adult woman so obviously and badly, that even the overdub often steps on the lines of other actors.

2. The scene in which a woman is tied to a tree and raped, but is soon afterwards (like an hour or so) stripping and dancing at a drunken party is just shows a total lack of thought going into the plot (or lack of same).

3. The only gore footage is not only used twice, but is obviously the body of a roasted pig or similar animal and not a human. Even at a glance, this ""shocking"" footage is as fake as breast implants.

4. The ""cannibals"" are clearly contemporart city dwellers (witness the hair styles) and seem to have been instructed to make goofy faces whenever possible, greatly diminshing whatever threat they supposedly pose.

5. They also seem to make a ritual habit of hopping in place around a fire for long periods of time just before eating. No, I'm not kidding.

6. The plot also seems to imply that the cannibals only eat ""bad"" people, like the criminals who kidnapped the little girl. Good to know that apart from the whole eating people thing, their morals are pretty solid.

All of the this is directed and shot with the camera stuck in cement, some of the worst acting ever seen, and a conclusion that ends the movie like a dull thud. But don't take all of this as a ""so bad it's good"" recommendation, because it isn't. This isn't a guilty pleasure or a MST3K worthy film. It's just dull and badly made. That's it. By comparison, Cannibal Holocuast comes across like The Godfather. Oh yeah, it's that bad. Did I mention it was bad?",1277942400,3,2067,4.395287958115183
8265321,1,B00177Y9R0,"""Cannibal Terror"" was banned in England for a time. It is known as ""Cannibal Terrible"" at my house and is currently banned there as well.

It's a somewhat watchable movie. You want to keep watching in hopes that something extra cool will happen. It never does.

The DVD version is very clean and crisp and that helps. It's just not a very exciting movie. It could have been a decent cult kind of cannibal movie if the pace and editing of the movie had a little help. Some scenes just drag on way too long. Not scenes with people talking. Scenes of the woods and people walking. The same overhead shot of a bunch of trees is shown several times. Folks walking through the woods. Zzzzzzzzz. Wake me up when someone is being eaten!

The ending is very stupid and unexciting.",1259539200,7,771,4.453900709219858
8265322,1,B00177Y9R0,"I am a seasoned Euro Cult enthusiast and in turn own many Italian/Euro cannibal films. Other than such films as Cannibal Holocaust and Jungle Holocaust (which are good films), most of the other films in the infamous subgenre are just sleazy B-grade movies that people unusually watch for cheezy performances, nudity, and/or creative gore. Cannibal Terror fails miserably on all accounts.

The first thing that sets Cannibal Terror apart from other films in the genre is that its a Spanish/French co-production. This proves that cannibal exploitation films should be left to the Italians as this shameful bandwagon effort is an insult to people looking for a bloody, exploitative good time.

Cannibal films aren't known for great plots this film literally has no plot. Some lowlife criminals kidnap a girl and run into Cannibals in a jungle. Almost the entire film is filler with pointless, boring dialogue. There is only two gore scenes but nothing viewers haven't seen in this genre before and better. The wost aspect of the film is the cannibal tribe itself as they don't even look like jungle tribal members. It's a bunch of extras from all different races and hairdos. Some of the tribal members are fat, middle aged white men and there is even one tribal member with 70's style sideburns!

I do not recommend buying this film. I got sent this film as a free promo by Severin films and I thank God every day that I didn't pay a dime for it. Only buy if your an absolute completest or you are into torturing yourself.

As for the DVD itself....Severin did a tremendous job at transferring this dreadful film. This transfer is TOO GOOD for this film. The only special features to speak of are are a ""deleted scene"" and a trailer.",1223164800,8,1731,4.7792642140468224
8265323,1,B00177Y9R0,"Folks, the ""cannibals"" in this unintentional comedy appear to have been recruited from a local pool hall: they all have different haircuts, none of which are even remotely convincing - and at least one ""cannibal"" has sideburns! They jump around with sticks, hooting and chanting like it's a pledge initiation. It does have a few decent gore scenes, but it's hard to keep from laughing. Fortunately I love really bad films, and I'll buy this new version. I just wish I could share it with Mike and the 'bots.",1217635200,7,507,4.707865168539326
