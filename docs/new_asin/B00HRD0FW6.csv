6200352,1,B00HRD0FW6,"""Contract Killers"" has the distinguished honor of being the only movie I have been unable to finish due to motion sickness. That is saying a lot, as I love B films and found footage films. Apparently the filmmakers decided that if a shaky camera added realism to an action scene, a VIOLENTLY shaking, pitching, rocking camera must make things look really, really cool. I would love to have been on set, watching the actors go through the motions as the camera operator spasmed around, shaking and rocking the camera while everyone tried to not be distracted by his insane movements. I fast forwarded a bit to see if the movie settled down, but to my surprise even during scenes containing just dialogue the camera operator would still sway and tilt back and forth, as if he was on a small ship being tossed around by waves. Watch if you dare, but be sure to bring Dramamine.",1411948800,,874,4.608974358974359
6200353,5,B00HRD0FW6,"The Contract Killers is one of many, but this one is real good! You should add this title to your collection, cheep!",1403308800,,116,4.318181818181818
6200354,2,B00HRD0FW6,"The film starts out with a plot and semi-subplot. Marshall (James Trevena-Brown) is a quiet guy who helps people in distress and is a hitman after dropping out of acting school. He works for Dario (Dallas Barnett ) who doesn't want him to date his niece Annabella (Renee Cataldo) at least until after he is dead.

Lee-Seng (Rob Young) is contracted to kill the contact killers and Dario. Being a contract killer is great work. You get to wear all black with a restrictive black trench coat, sunglasses at night to impede your vision, and no gloves so you can leave your prints all over the crime scene. And most of you work takes place at night in no security parking garages and abandoned warehouses.

The plot was fairly straight forward. No fancy twist or heavy thinking. The acting was stiff, even for an action film; not Seagal stiff, but fairly bad, especially Kerry Glamsch who played Callahan.

Watchable if free.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Stripper nudity. No sex.",1400976000,,971,4.761904761904762
6200355,2,B00HRD0FW6,"This apparently direct-to-DVD production, directed by Mathew John Pearson and featuring Renee Cataldo, Rob Young, James Trevina-Brown, Dallas Barnett and others, was filmed in Wellington New Zealand.  The director apparently has not had any prior full-length features to his credit, and I'm afraid this will not mark the break-out in his career.

The plot has something to do with dirty police in cooperation with a drug-lord eliminating the competition with the use of contract killers, one of whom (Trevina-Brown in the role of ""Marshall"") is the lead character.  His arch-nemesis is another contract killer dubbed Lee-Seng (Rob Young), flown in from Korea to ""tie up loose ends"" by killing the other contract killers, leaving nobody to know what actually went on, other than the drug-lord, police chief and a few henchmen.

Rob Young looks like a Koren Arnold Schwarzenegger, and his lack of facial expression or vocal inflection is reminiscent of a younger Schwarzenegger, a la the first ""Terminator"" film.  If anyone looks like they are working hard in their part, it would be him, even if his expression looks like a zombie given an overdose of botox, his inflection makes Schwarzenegger sound positively effusive, and he has almost no memorable one-liners (and very little speech to memorize, for that matter).

Fans of action films don't necessarily mind lack of great dialog, or even an intricate plot, but this is so bad that the dialog and plot are on a par with X-rated movies, where they serve essentially to string together the sex scenes.  In this case however, they are only the filler between the scenes of combat.

Even the combat is not terribly convincing-- at least where it comes to shooting (of which there is PLENTY).  True, the weapons look great.  There are also some nice tracer-effects at times, and satisfactory scenes of wood splintering (or human bodies impacted).  But other times, it looks like they were running out of money and time--particularly the final prolonged fight scene.  It's not just the lame over-used clichs, like a gunman riddling an obviously empty chair with a dozen or more bullets without bothering to notice there's nobody in it.  It's not even the automatic weapon-fire sprayed against a wall which afterward appears remarkably untouched.  When it comes down to one plaster-wall stopping automatic weapon fire, or two guys firing madly at each other, each with two weapons, separated only by one rack with tires with plenty of air-spaces allowing each clear sight of the other--when they both are supposed to be trained assassins it simply strains credibility that no one is hit by a single bullet.  Or, there's the miraculous healing of our hero from a six-inch (or was it 12?  It's probably as certain as the claims men make regarding the length of other things) deep penetrating abdomen wound by some tape, judiciously applied by Cataldo.  Yes, at times it reminded me of the Rambo parody ""Hot Shots"" where an army shoots at the Stallonesque hero and all miss; he fires a couple of shots, and they all drop dead.  Except this is not supposed to be comedy.

Almost all the film is shot at night, or in darkened interior rooms (which brings us to the question--why the sunglasses?).  The city is generic enough that it could serve as almost any American big city.

The one redeeming feature of this film is the martial-arts fight scenes.  Here Rob Young in particular shows that he's serious about it.  They certainly don't match ""Enter the Dragon"", but on the other hand there's none of the ridiculously surreal wire-stuff like ""Crouching Tiger..."", either.  No, there's quite a bit of close hand-to-hand (and leg, and foot, and stick, etc.) combat, which was much better-done than in the average action-film.

For a movie with a high body count, there wasn't really any gratuitous gore either; very little swearing, and only one brief suggestive-sex scene...in short, it avoids some of the extremes it could easily have gone to, though it would still rate a stiff ""R"" in American theatres (had it appeared there).

Although the martial arts combat scenes were quite competent, I just didn't feel there was enough of anything else (plot, dialog, characterization...) to make this something I'd recommend...to anybody (sigh).",1396656000,5,4281,5.01980198019802

8634767,2,B00HRD0FW6,"It's a shame that they make movies like this today.  Low budget (I think it was funded by Indiegogo or GoFundMe) but that doesn't excuse the failure to give any depth to any of the characters (except maybe the bad guy, Young).  I realize it's Australian but there are great actors who come from that island nation ... it's just that none of them showed up in this offering.  It's really not necessary to discuss the plot nor the action (bad guys shoot thousands of rounds at good guy and miss - good guy is spot on with his killing shots, except when he's shooting at bad guy Young). The love interest is of no interest.  I'd give it a ""one star"" rating but that says ""I hate it"" and I really don't hate that many things ... but I was sorely tempted in this released on DVD offering.",1505692800,,783,4.23489932885906
