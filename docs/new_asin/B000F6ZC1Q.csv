The truth is that girls as young as 14 are very adult when it comes to interactions in this industry. Far more experienced than girls that are still with their parents, a little bit of girlie charm that they had gives way to pressures to act and perform. They have to pay their own rent and for food out of money they earn for themselves. Can your 15 year old daughter do that?

While they are excited to be on their own, there is still a little bit of naiive natures to want to go drink and party all night, but for the most part the agency keeps them focused. For a parent it is both comforting and sobering seeing their girls grow up and go away to places like Japan and NY on their own, but you can't over romanticize youth anymore. And to be honest these girls handle themselves much more maturely than girls their age hanging out in malls.",1247184000,,926,4.144444444444445
