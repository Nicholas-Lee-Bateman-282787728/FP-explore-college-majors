8738772,4,B017DSEAOS,"With the debates for the Presidential Election in the US concentrating on the power of the big banks and brokerage firms, this 2014 French film is certainly relevant. It was co-produced (and financed) by Francetelevisions, Film Fund Luxembourg, Brussels film Board and almost a dozen other European film or TV organizations. Though it is based on a true story it is a work of fiction about the actual collusion between European banks and corporations to hide funds by transferring them through a financial clearing house named Clearstream.

Like similar exposes about covert operations (think Watergate), it took a managing editor at a major (in this case Paris) newspaper to pull an investigative story from a reporter, to have the reporter leave to find the REAL story on his own. The question is always who do you trust and journalist Denis Robert doesnt always make the right choices. But  and this is no spoiler, or there wouldnt be a story to tell  thinks end positively for most of those involved. Its the back-story on this event  which filled decade after the 2001 World Trade Center bombing  that keeps you interested in this thriller.

It is in French with reasonably easy-to-read English subtitles. The 102 minute film is not accompanied by any bonus features on the DVD.
This is not a must-see film but will certainly be of interest to those who like political thrillers or those interested in international finance.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
