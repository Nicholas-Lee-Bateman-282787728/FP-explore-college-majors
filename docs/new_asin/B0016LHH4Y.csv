8263045,5,B0016LHH4Y,"This story is about a young man named Rin. Rin lives with his friend Kaede. Both of them lost their mothers in an accident, and Kaede takes care of Rin's every need. It looks like they will always be together, until a couple of princesses form other worlds show up and ask him to choose one of them to marry. There is also a classmate named Asa who is gunning for his affections. After things start to settle down a young girl comes from the demon world to live with Kaede and Rin, making everything even more crazy. With all these really great ladies after his attention Rin must choose one, and break the others hearts.

This story is very good. It's a great harem style anime with lots of awesome characters and plot twists. It is also very emotional. The last 6 episodes or so are really heavy. The animation quality and voice acting are also very good in this anime. I enjoyed every minute of it. I hope you do too.",1354924800,,920,4.317919075144508
8263046,5,B0016LHH4Y,"SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG FOR MY REVIEW....I DID NOT GET TO SEE THIS DISC UNTIL THE ORIGINS GAMES FAIR (YES I AM A GAMER AS WELL)....

WITH REMU GONE, THE FIRE SEEMS TO BE OUT OF RIN AND THE GIRLS.  RIN QUESTIONS IF HE DID THE RIGHT THING SENDING HER TO GET HELP, AND THE GIRLS QUESTION THEIR FEELINGS TOWARDS RIN.  WHEN RIN LEARNS ABOUT REMUS HISTORY AND THE FACT THAT SHE IS THE THIRD TO UNDERGO THE TESTING TO MAKE AN ARTIFICIAL LIFEFORM.  TO TAKES A STERN TALKING TO (AND A FEW SMACKS) FROM ASA TO GET RIN TO DECIDE TO GO TO THE DEMON WORLD TO BRING REMU BACK.  BUT WHEN THEY ASK RINA (EVEN DARK SIA GETS INTO THE ACT) TO TAKE THEM OVER, SHE REFUSES AND RUNS OFF.  WHEN RIN GOES AFTER HER, ASA PASSES OUT IN FRONT OF KEADE AND SIA.  WHEN RIN CATCHES UP TO RINA AT THE PLAYGROUND, HE LEARNS THAT THE YOUNG GIRL HE MET YEARS AGO WAS NOT HER, BUT A CLONE NAMED LYCOSIS.  RINA EXPLAINS THAT LYCOSIS WAS THE SECOND TEST SUBJECT (A CLONE MADE OF HER LIFE FORCE AND THAT AS A CHILD SHE WAS VERY SICKLY)AND THAT BECAUSE SHE WAS ILL, LYCOSIS WENT TO THE HUMAN WORLD WITH THE DEMON KING. ALSO SHE IS UNHAPPY THAT SHE STOLE NOT ONLY THE SONG WE HEAR RINA SING, BUT ALSO SHE THINKS THE FEELINGS FOR RIN IS NOT HERS. WHEN RINA AND RIN FIND OUT ABOUT ASA GETTING ILL, HE DECIDES TO GO VIST.  HE LEARNS THAT ASA WAS ALSO A SICKLY CHILD AND THAT SHE BLAMED HER MOTHER FOR HER CONDITION, BUT SOON LEARNED THAT DESPITE IT ALL HER MOTHER KEPT CARING AND LOVING HER.  WITH THIS NEW RESOLVE RIN AND COMPANY GO TO THE DEMON WORLD TO FIND OUT ABOUT REMU.  WHEN THEY GET TO THE LAB, THEY ARE CONFRONTED BY THE TWO FATHERS IN ALL THEIR MAJESTIC POWER (BUT THEY FOLD SOON AFTER).  THEY ARE TOLD THAT THERE MAY BE ONE CHANCE TO SAVE REMU, TO RESET HER BACK TO THE BEGINNING AND SEAL HER POWERS, BUT WHEN REMU GOES OUT OF CONTROL IT TAKES RIN, THE GIRLS, AND ONE OTHER TO BRING REMU BACK.  THE FINAL EPISODE SHOWS EVERYONE GETTING BACK TO THEIR LIVES, BUT SIA SEEMS TO BE FALLING BEHIND, SO MUCH SO THAT HER DARK HALF GAINS STRENGTH AND SEALS HER INTO THE MIRROR.  SHE THEN AMBUSHES RIN AND INVITES HIM TO ""HAVE SOME FUN"".

THIS DISC SHOWS THE GIRLS BEING MORE HUMAN, AND RIN BEING MORE RESPONSIBLE.  THIS STORY HAS MUCH MORE TO OFFER THAN WHAT 5 DISCS CAN GIVE, HOPEFULLY THIS IS JUST SEASON ONE.  BUT I CAN NOT WAIT FOR IT TO COME TO A HEAD.  SEE YOU NEXT DISC......",1215129600,,2340,4.05
8263047,5,B0016LHH4Y,"When watching this volume of Shuffle! it seemed as though I was watching a completely different anime. Its like they took the Shuffle! characters and put them in a world where nothing goes right and there is only pain. I went on wikipedia and read what happens so I knew the show was going to go in this direction. The first 11 1/2 episodes are care free and a I love Rin fest. The second half of episode 12 is where for those who have seen things get a lot more serious. In that episode gone are the orange arrows, and upbeat music that goes with it. You instead have a black screen with Frozen Summer written in the lower right hand corner, with a sad sounding piano tune playing. The midpoint animation changes from cats playing to the shuffle! girls appearing nude and looking quite sad. Again with sad piano music. For the fan service freaks the nudity is not hot at all nor was it meant to be. They drew them in my opinion to show the vonurablity in the female characters. This episode as seen from the cover for three episdses focuses mainly on Rimu, and getting her back. I personally like this direction it gives the characters depth. Before they seemed to hollow and happy go lucky. Now you see every one of the female characters have issues and they are not pretty. I am most looking foreward to the part where Kaide not to spoil it for those that don't know she has a bit of a break down, I'll leave it at that.",1213747200,2,1423,4.29368029739777
