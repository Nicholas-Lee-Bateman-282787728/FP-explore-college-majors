As a work of filmmaking, it's pretty DIY. There are annoying errors in the graphics -- for example, Glen Campbell's last name is missing a ""p,"" and one has to wade through a lot of gushing hagiography to find detail of the sort that would be of interest to musicians, historians, or collectors. On the other hand, the filmmakers got some great anecdotes from Michael Lloyd, and many of the stories told by the sisters themselves are interesting, like the harrowing tale of their trip to the Spahn Ranch. The tale of loss toward the end of the film is moving. In light of Kim Fowley's death, his interview footage is valuable, though he spends an inordinate amount of time telling us about how they were sexy, presaged the Runaways, and so on -- all things that will be obvious to those who purchase this film. We all know the Clingers were ahead of their time; a documentary should focus upon  _how_ they came to be so innovative. Even so, my gratitude goes out to the sisters for doing the best they could on this documentary with what appears to be limited resources.",1423008000,2,1324,4.610169491525424
8616390,4,B00FKN1E5M,"I give it 4 stars because someone did a documentary on The Clingers. If you know nothing about the group & other music biz folks (Kim Foley, etc), this dvd doesnot help. Peggys life is glossed over (no mention tthat she hooked up with music veteran Johnny (Mr. BassMan/Cinammon) Cymbal & recorded at least 1 lp with him (on the Chelsea label). (They wrote David Cassidys semi-hit ""Rock me Baby). But, something is better than nothing & I loved the clips of the girls with Danny Kaye where you could see Danny & the girls clicked . Always loved the 45 of ""Gonna have a goodtime:"" &  liked seeing a performance that wasn't from The Smothers Brothers TV show, (Now when will we get a cd compilation of their music? I know 2 early singles as The Clinger Sisters are available on a couple of compilations from outside the US). Anyway, if you remember The Clingers, buy the dvd. If you don't know The Clingers, buy the dvd (the price is reasonable). Thanks for remembering The Clingers..",1385856000,,981,4.5423728813559325

It has a lot of excellent video clips of the sisters throughout their career, and I was glad to see three of them on camera with their memories.  It was a hoot to see Kim Fowley's comments, too.  In general, I would have loved to see many more clips and memories, in a longer program; but I would have liked, also, to see more history of the family, and more detail on why they made the decisions to change styles in music.  I also would have liked to hear more about their tribulations in life; but this was their story to tell, and I was really happy to get the info they were willing to share.",1385251200,3,683,4.151515151515151
