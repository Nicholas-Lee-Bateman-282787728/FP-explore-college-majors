The answer is yes.
Forget talent, pick a winner and get it over with, the suspense is killing me. Let me get on with my life, if I wasn't meant to be an artist, then good. I've always wanted to try to play poker for a living.
This gameshow will answer those questions for a lucky few. I wish there was a home boardgame version, or maybe idol could expand this nationwide.
I'm just sad I wasn't in Boston to have my big shot. Next year they will be lining up around the block for tryouts.
Damn you Art Showdown.",1193875200,,782,4.117647058823529
8216565,5,B000V5IPC4,"This is an amazing, independently-produced comedy tv game show spoof. A refreshing mix of intelligent parody and creative improvisation, this show will take off like a rocket if picked up by someone like Comedy Central! Much funnier than something like 'Who's Line is it Anyway?"", this is the kind of TV I've been waiting for...",1192924800,,328,4.9818181818181815

I think it's just hilarious.

If you're a fan of Jeff ""jeffu"" Warmouth (Kaiju Big Battel, SPUDNIK), you won't be disappointed.  Host Chorine hams it up to western hick perfection, and the guests are earnest while still able to add personal twists I've found lacking in other game shows.  I'm no art critic, but I think if you have any interest in art, you'll at least find Art Show Down supremely entertaining.

Not mentioned in the description is the inclusion of bonus spoof commercials, each of which is it's own mini comedic art piece.  As a final bonus, you can see me in the audience during the Ultimate Artist Showdown!  But you'll more likely notice my three-year-old son -- who even now, a year later, still says, ""Let's go to Art Showdown!"" when we pass the former studio.

Thanks also to contestants Heidi and Andy for the cowboy hat (watch for it)!",1192579200,,921,4.506024096385542
