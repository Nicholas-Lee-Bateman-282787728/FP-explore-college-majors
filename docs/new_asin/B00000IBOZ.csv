8375062,5,B00000IBOZ,"This is the last video of Saber Marionette's forst season and it's simply  amazing!  The emotion and action that rivited through this is worth  watching.  NOt only does things turn out unexpectedly, but the end is like  embracing an old friend.  Vol. 8 still has the great SMJ humor and  silliness, but there are undertones that should never be missed!  Go out  and buy this one, I sure will when I'm not broke!",965779200,,411,4.52054794520548
