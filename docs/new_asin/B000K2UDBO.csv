8154027,4,B000K2UDBO,"Excellent introduction to the Hustle. Covers basic steps, throw outs, turns, back passes, back bows, hammerlocks, sweethearts, bow ties and many other patterns. One can get a list of all the patterns for all of his DVD's at [...]. The DVD is one hour thirty minutes long. The only fault was that amalgamation 7,8,9 was not listed at the dance lovers web site. That goof-up kept it from getting 5 stars.

I am still watching and learning patterns, and moves from this DVD. January 11, 2012.",1248739200,,489,4.686046511627907
