8119757,5,B000FAGURW,"My kids (ages 4 and 2) love Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, and love to watch this DVD over and over.  I don't mind them watching it because it is educational and Maggie is very imaginative.  The DVD teaches manners and how to make believe.  I recommend this DVD it is light hearted, no violence, absolutely nothing in it that a child shouldn't see.",1207872000,3,349,4.421875
