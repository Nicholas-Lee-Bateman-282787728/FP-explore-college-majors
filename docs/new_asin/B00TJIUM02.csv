7011619,1,B00TJIUM02,"It's one thing to make a horrible movie.  Maybe all the people involved didn't plan on making an awful, so I'll give them that.  But when you make an awful movie supposedly based on a well-known historical event, i.e. The Donnor Party, and an even more well known tribe of Native Americans, i.e. The Cherokee Nation, and you don't bother to check facts to make sure your movie is at least going to be historically correct, you should be ashamed.  Such is the case for one of the biggest turds ever put to film--""The Burning Dead.""

This movie is loosely based on the infamous Donnor Party.  For those of you who are not aware of the story, I suggest you google it.  It opens with Danny-I'll-do-anything-for-a-quick-buck Trejo trying to pass as an American Indian.  He wails, moans, and whittles on a big stick while trying to scare his grandchildren with tales from the darkside involving the cursed Devil's Peak where (from what I gather) if you result to cannabalism, a really bad CGI volcano will erupt and you'll be doomed.  I guess the two people involved in the aforementioned cannabalism were just hungry--not zombies--but I couldn't really tell, because their makeup stopped at the neckline.  Trejo's character (Chief Ugly Mug) tells of how the great Cherokee Nation was supposed to guard this mountain range, blah, blah, blah.  Here's the rub with that:  unless some Cherokee Indians left WITH the Donner Party, the Cherokee Nation is nowhere to be found in California.

Flash forward to present day, where the old volcano is about to bust.  Before its supposed final eruption, it chucks out green gasses that sprout zombies.  I refuse to go on...

To say this movie blew chunks would be giving it a positive review of some sort.  It was horrible--beyond horrible--and so pitifully put together, I don't see how it could have possibly gotten funding from anyone.  But, then again, there is hope.  After all, ""Birdman"" won the Oscar for best picture last year...  Unrated, this is garbage, and not one bit remotely fun.",1425945600,3,2027,4.823188405797102

7011622,2,B00TJIUM02,"I only gave this two stars because it actually is entertaining in an inept, funny way. As a zombie film it's a terrible mess with an almost incoherent script and a cast seemingly from the lower reaches of television sitcoms. But really, in the end I just couldn't resist seeing a film with lava-filled zombies being spewed by a cursed volcano. Who could? You see, it's all connected to the Donner Party who (unknown to historic testimony) were actually zombies craving the usual human flesh. Somehow the volcano sucks them all up and lies dormant for over a century.

Now it's 2015 and a sitcom-like Roberts family of Mom and daughter Nicole bicker at each other while Nicole's boyfriend Ryan just stands around. There's also Granddad, a grumpy old man who lives in a cabin home near the mother's fancier mountain home. They have issues and haven't spoken for years. Add a sheriff who is attracted to Mindy (the Mom character), an old granola type who lives in a forest tower, and a vulcanologist and his assistant Eve. And, oh yes, there's the comely Blogger-Photographer played by Jenny Lin who is there to take topless selfies for her blog and to cater to one assumed part of the audience. The volcano is now obviously getting ready to blow but some people just won't evacuate. Then the volcano starts spewing the most pathetic-looking CGI lava you've ever seen and of course, hurling zombie-bombs.

This gives everyone a chance to run around the woods, which keeps the budget down, and do really stupid things like abandon all their vehicles when one of the group turns. Oh yes, where's Danny Trejo? For those who aren't familiar with him, he's a decent actor, mostly in action films, who seems to accept any project he's offered in a bid to appear in more films than Samuel L. Jackson. The producers wanted his face on the cover so people might actually rent the film so they added in a framing device where he is an Indian telling two young members of the tribe about the legend of the evil mountain. The movie cuts to this a few times. It must have been filmed in one day, but then you have Trejo on the cover of your DVD. Fans beware!",1474070400,,2142,4.590078328981723

7011663,3,B00TJIUM02,"THE BURNING DEAD

I love B movies, I love horror movies, I love zombie movies, I love zombie horror B movies. When I first came across this I was loving it. The title lead me to believe it was a zombie flick, volcano zombies at that which made me think of The Asylum. But whose face and name was all over this, Danny Trejo. Now I knew that he was going to have a very small part in this because he was promoted so heavy on that front cover, thats just how it works.

The story follows a family who are not fans of one another and the local Sheriffs department in a small town with an active volcano. They have been warned and have a time frame for the eruption but something worse is coming out of that volcano, lava zombies. This of course is leading to an earlier and more devastating eruption. All this goes back to a story one Native American man is telling the youth for way back in the day.

Now that all sounded all well and good to me from what was stated on the back cover, but it turned out to be a little of a letdown. Now don't get me wrong I actually liked this movie but those with me for the most part disagreed. The effects are bad as was most of the acting and while the idea and story are good the writing seemed like it could have been improved. But like I said I like these kinds of things so it didn't stop me from enjoying it.

For those wondering Trejo is basically the guy telling the story so he is in it very little. Also the DVD only comes with the trailer from what I remember; as usual I would have loved a commentary from the writers and or director. Writers Jason Ancona and Jeff Miller also wrote Axe Giant: The Wrath of Paul Bunyan. And director Rene Perez is the person behind the The Dead and the Damned films. Over all if you like bad movies you may enjoy this.",1437523200,,1797,4.0821529745042495

With such a plot, I had to see this. If nothing else, lava zombies are unique. I really wish I didn't have to watch every horror movie out there because this was just plain awful. The acting is actually not that bad, well okay, it is bad but I have seen much worse. The direction killed me, such a long, boring, plodding pace. The story is pretty asinine, especially when they try to tie in The Donner Party, which seemed extraneous. The FX are pretty awful, bad CGI and the zombies don't look very good. I really wasn't expecting a good movie but instead hoping for a mindless romp with some fun and unique zombies. What I got was an almost unbearable borefest with very little nudity and gore to help move the story along.",1437523200,2,880,4.404907975460123
7011665,2,B00TJIUM02,"I cannot stand looking at these movie covers and seeing Danny Trejo as the hero or the star of the movie and when I watch it is just him sitting around a campfire telling some kids a story about the curse of the mountain. Grrrr!! Danny Trejo is not the star of this movie. He probably has a combined five or ten minutes of screen time and it is all of him sitting around the fire. Then the real characters are introduced. That is when I begged my screen to let Trejo show up and show all of these douche weeds how to kick some azz. The acting in this is terrible. The effects are so-so. The zombies look dumb and the people dressed as zombies don't know the zombie walk so they come off as bumbling idiots. The characters do nothing but bicker and fight with each other for most of the movie. I hate that. Why is it that almost every horror movie has a bunch of douche bags who do nothing but fight with each other? At least every sub-par horror movie has the bickering, fighting losers. And of course, all of the characters are stupid and make every dumb move known to man all in the name of survival. By half way, I wanted all of the characters to die. I'm a fan of campy flicks, really, I am. But this goes beyond camp and stops right in the middle of SUCK! Bunch of morons. And the dialogue is crap to top off this pile of monkey crap.

7011668,3,B00TJIUM02,"The story is a standard disaster, impending doom scenario that has become the norm for such channels as Syfy. And for all intents and purposes, The Burning Dead seems specially produced for the channel that has brought cheap, CGI entertainment to American audiences. The same dramatic stakes arise in the story as a family reconnects in order to see that all survive the coming disaster. The twist here is the added supernatural element in the form of a curse which has lava fueled zombies raining down on the cast and picturesque landscape. As ridiculous and beyond sci-fi as the story premise sounds, the concept translates into a entertaining, all be it cheesy spectacle.

The acting is pretty much what you would expect from a flick like this, sometimes contrived, often over-the-top scenes of melodrama mixed with screams and amusing dialog delivery. If you have enjoyed or delighted in any of the made for Syfy flicks similar to this film then The Burning Dead will give equal bemusement. It is pretty much a cookie cutter assortment of CGI induced disaster action sequences and practical make-up effects zombies. A lot of the situations and dialog does seem far too familiar as with most of these stories, but like junk food, it is all about the melodrama and cheap theatrics.

Overall, The Burning Dead will not pull in any new fans to this CGI infused genre, but it holds its own against anything Syfy or the straight-to-video market puts up next to it. Trejo fans may be slightly disappointed considering the limited part he has in the film, but the scenes that his character is in are some of the more grounded ones. I felt he was under utilized , but that is just my thoughts. For what The Burning Dead is, the film has some amusing, and entertaining moments. The zombies, when not drowned in CGI emptiness, fall more toward the Zombi style than the Night Of The Living Dead creatures.",1431216000,3,1897,4.762917933130699
7011669,4,B00TJIUM02,"The film creeps into the category ""so bad it is good"" which is why my rating is higher than most people would claim the film deserves.

If you look at the front cover, you know the basic plot: Zombies from volcanoes and Danny Trejo in another minor role. The smaller his role, the bigger his face is on the DVD cover. Trejo plays a wicked bad Native American (California Cherokee????) who explains the plot but doesn't. His later speeches had me holding my side in laughter as he poorly reads his lines...lines that should have been left on the cutting room floor.

The setting is the Donner Pass. We get an 1846 flashback to people eating other people until they are covered by CG magma, something the other films about Donner Pass omitted for some reason. And one of the guys had on clown make-up while gnawing on a body part. I guess that was what the make up artist did best. In the present people are evacuating and the volcano explodes early.

Zombie green flashing steaks come from the mountain and creates zombies from the ground. They move herky-jerky  but fairly fast. They prefer  to feast on Troma intestines to standard Romero brains. Jenny Lin provides us with the token Asian topless scene, most likely because she will work for scale. I recall one MF bonb. There wasn't much swearing, but for some reason they felt they needed to squeak one in by someone who doesn't seem to know how to really swear.

Cute Nicole Cummins who should really stay away from her creepy grandfather (Robert F. Lyons) has a boyfriend (Kevin Norman) who collects comic books, goes to the conventions, and knows how to kill a zombie. In one scene lava flows down one side of the road while coming up the other at the same time. All other roads in the area are clear for the sheriff. Don't think too hard.

The movie boasts a generic Asylum style soundtrack, writing, historical errors, acting,and special effects. Feel free to laugh at the serious parts. I know I did.
