8520575,3,B007PQ50CA,"Marketing the Blu-ray of this Richard Strauss program from the August 2011 Salzburg Festival handed Opus Arte a big problem -- what title to give it. Christian Thielemann conducts the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in all the music on the disc, but the presence of international star Rene Fleming in about a third of the concert proved too attractive a prospect to pass up. And so, the prominence of Fleming's name and the dominant photograph of her on the cover make it appear the package consists primarily of the popular American soprano's performances of Strauss lieder, with the words ""Eine Alpensinfonie"" in smaller print toward the bottom and Thielemann on the podium in the background.

Opus Arte's title difficulty doesn't help finding this disc on Amazon, either. If you do a search in Movies & TV for ""strauss eine alpensinfonie thielemann,"" which was my primary interest, all that comes up is the DVD issue, which is not connected with the Blu-ray listing. Do a search for ""strauss fleming,"" and again all you find is the DVD. To locate the Blu-ray, you must search under ""rene fleming"" or for ""rene fleming live in concert.""  So much for sighting ""Eine Alpensinfonie.""

As it happens, Fleming's contribution is fine indeed (video and audio quality are superb throughout), but her fans and devotees of Strauss lieder will probably feel cheated that she is called on to sing only four songs and the aria from the end of Act I of Arabella. (Subtitles are available in English, French, German, and Spanish, but lyrics are not printed in the booklet. Also absent is a track listing, although ""chapters"" are accessible on-screen.) Most of the songs are short, and Fleming sings for only about 24 minutes of the disc's 84-minute running time. The highlights are ""Befreit,"" Op. 39, No. 4, the bittersweet monologue of a dying husband to his wife as he sets her free to return to the world; and the longest piece Fleming sings, ""Gesang der Apollopriesterin,"" Op. 33, No. 2, with its opulent orchestration. Fleming and Thielemann enjoy an obvious rapport. And even though I bought this primarily for the Alpine Symphony, I would liked to have heard more.

Fleming's performances are oddly matched with the work for full orchestra that makes up the bulk of the disc. In a 2000 concert in the Musikverein issued on CD the following year by Deutsche Grammophon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Richard-Strauss-Eine-Alpensinfonie-Rosenkavalier-Suite-Christian-Thielemann-Wiener-Philharmoniker/dp/B00005AAFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Richard Strauss: Eine Alpensinfonie / Rosenkavalier Suite - Christian Thielemann / Wiener Philharmoniker</a>, Thielemann and the VPO made one of the two or three best recorded performances I'd heard of my favorite Strauss symphonic composition. Unfortunately, after watching this concert with the same conductor and orchestra, I still feel the same way.

The VPO has played this work so many times, it can probably do so without a conductor. Extended passages deliver glorious sound -- especially from the VPO's justly vaunted horn section. It's terrific to see them and all the other members of this storied institution in action. The performance, however, has an air of routine about it. To be sure, a routine delivery by the VPO is nothing to scoff at. But Thielemann and the orchestra seem content to play the piece as mere ""cinema music"" -- nothing more than superficial nature painting, beautiful as that may be -- with no awareness of or reference to any underlying philosophical or spiritual program, which Strauss wrote that he had in mind as the work's foundation.

Not all of the execution is squeaky clean. In particular, the off-stage brass in ""The Ascent"" (33:40-33:50 in this recording) are really out of synch. Not only are they too distant, but also they're botched, which badly mars the listening experience. (On Thielemann's CD with the VPO, the off-stage effects are perfect.) Thielemann remains poker-faced as this minor disaster occurs, but viewers can easily imagine the thoughts running through his head. Those at the concert probably forgot about this blunder by the time the descent from the mountain was completed. For a recording, though, it's no fun to sit through again and again.

Thielemann displays one distracting mannerism on the podium. He sometimes bends forward from the waist and waves his arms down below his knees, as though he's trying to scoop the sound up off the floor. I don't think musicians beyond the first row can't tell what he's doing down there, and this peculiarity becomes irritating. Apparently the Salzburg audience thought Thielemann's conducting belonged to the ages because he's brought back out so many times it's embarrassing. When he finally gets around to designating individual musicians to stand, instead of going straight to the principal horn player, it's the oboist who comes first, followed by clarinet, flute, and bassoon. Only then is the principal horn recognized. Of course, all the winds make valuable contributions, but it's the horns, after all, that form the backbone of the entire piece and sound so glorious on the summit.

The three stars are for Fleming, the VPO, and its horn section. The one on stage, that is. Now where did I leave that CD?",1455321600,,5299,5.23321554770318

8520583,5,B007PQ50CA,"Optimum beauty of voice and optimum musical intelligence are rarely combined in the classical vocalist. I have been collecting for many years and the list is small. Victoria de los Angeles comes to mind. Elizabeth Grummer I only know through the records she made and they are all estimable. Regine Crespin during the short period before her top compromised her talent would qualify, I think. And very controversially I would add Elizabeth Schwarzkopf to that list, a soprano I hear many times both iin recital and opera. I suspect we can all make our own list.

These thoughts were the result of combing through YouTube one evening when I came across a Salzburg concert in the large festival hall given by Renee Fleming and Christian Thielemann. The program consisted of some songs by Strauss, an excerpt from Arabella and the Alpine Symphony. I was thrilled to find that it was available on a CVD. Ome might add uncharitably, not the most balanced of programs even one devoted to Richard Strauss. With Fleming's photograph on the cover one could logically assume that her portion of the program would be longer than it was. Given the level of Fleming's artistry that evening we should have demanded more. I have kept my distance from this artist on many occasions. Her addiction to jazz and pop would be acceptable if it remined a personal quirk and one rare brought out--and never in public. She has been guilty of self indulgent performances that were not worthy of her talent. But this is neither the time nor the place to cite chaper and verse.

That evening in Salzburg was pure vocal magic. It is ungallant to say it but the lady had reached the half century mark. She doesn't look it and more important she doesn't sound sound as if she had over twenty years of singing under her belt. Strauss loved the soprano voice and Fleming was made to sing this music. But even more important to me she reflected that she had spent some time thinking about this music. It meant something to her and accordingly it meant something to me. Of all the songs she sang only Befreit was known to me. It stands as one of Strauss' greatest songs and her performance was heartbreaking; It's a great song in the original piano accompaniment but his orchestration makes it transcendent. Interestingly enough on this same eventing when I discovered the Salzburg performance I came across a clip of Ariadne auf Naxos from Baden Baden. Thielemann was the conductor and Fleming the Ariadne. I understand that she sang only three performances and at least one was taped. It was to be a trial run; would the role be a good fit? On the basis of the great aria Es gibt ein Reich my answer would be an unqualified yes. And here in Baden she set out to create a character--one of the more unusual in  the repertoire, but a character none the less. I truly hope that a DVD will shortly be forthcoming!

I will refrain from commenting on the remainder of the concert. The Alpine Symphony is not one of my favorite but it was unquestionably well played by one of the three greatest orchestras iin Europe. The price was reasonble so that even though I probably won't play the tone poem as often as the songs it was a worthwhile iinveestment.

Highly recommended for all the reason cited above!",1345939200,3,3265,4.651646447140381
