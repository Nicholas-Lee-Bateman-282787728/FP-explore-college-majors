Fearlessly mature, Faerie Tale Theatre's ""Rapunzel"" is a high water mark in the series' enduring legacy.

Starring series creator Shelley Duvall as both the title character and her mother Marie, and featuring such giants as Jeff Bridges and Gena Rowlands, ""Rapunzel"" expertly tells the story of the lonely girl with the long hair locked in a high tower.  A handsome, if spatially limited, production marks this film.  It beautifully walks a fine line between the suspense needed for the story and over-the-top scares for young ones.  I will tentatively say that this should not outright scare kids, but intrigue them with very well-done suspense and intelligence.

Also featuring welcome narration by Roddy McDowell(the 1968 original ""Planet of the Apes"" film) and a screenplay loaded with wit, Faerie Tale Theatre's ""Rapunzel"" is exceptional.",1264982400,,860,5.380597014925373
7812921,5,6301599306,"I love this addition to the series. Shelley Duvall is enchanting, in front of or behind the scenes. I am a huge fan of her work and have loved this series since I was a small boy.

This episode is stupendous! Gena Rowlands is phenominal as the witch. Wounded and human, this witch is more encompassing than most. Jeff Bridges is appealing to both children and adults in his effortless manipulation of charm. Shelley, well, she is as magnetic and stalwart as ever. The colors and gorgeously painted sets can transport back to a time when we all could believe in faerie tales.

There is a thread of magic which is rampant throughout these tales. The amazing casts, who basically GAVE their time and talents to make these projects come to life, never disappoint. I was a hardcore fan at 5 years old and I am still.

THANK YOU SHELLEY.",1162339200,2,831,4.526666666666666
7812922,5,6301599306,"The only flaws in this fairy tale, as the others in the series, come from a low budget. The costume changes are few, the sets usually leave something to be desired. And with Rapunzel, that goes double. So what? It's a fairy tale land, a realm where you use your imagination, and if you can't, maybe you should try harder.

Every actor does a splendid job. Shelly Duvall shines as the innocent, unwittingly charming Rapunzel. She also plays Rapunzel's mother, and does a credible job there too. Jeff Bridges plays both Prince and Father. As the father figure, he infuses a delightful humor into the role, and as the Prince, he brings a dashing romance that will have little girls and mothers everywhere sighing wistfully. Gena Rowlands plays the witch with range. One minute, she's a genuinely loving mother, the next she's a cold-hearted force of evil. She's a villainess with heart, one that will scare the kiddies, but not scar them for life.

Watch this with your kids, younger relatives, or watch it to connect with your inner child. It's a treasure to be sure.",1127174400,,1065,4.720430107526882
7812923,4,6301599306,"Shelley Duvall, creator and producer of the FAERIE TALE THEATRE series, takes centre stage in the lead role of RAPUNZEL, one of the best entries in the series.

Gena Rowlands is deliciously evil as the jealous old witch who takes the young girl from her parents and imprisons her in an impossibly tall tower in the middle of an enchanted forest.

Jeff Bridges is great as the dashing Prince who charms Rapunzel and plans to elope with her. Their scenes together are very beautiful, and their chemistry is evident for all to see.

Shelley Duvall and Jeff Bridges also portray Rapunzel's parents at the beginning of the tale, which is a nice touch.

Filled with dazzling costumes and an intelligent script, RAPUNZEL is worth a look, as are all the other great FAERIE TALE THEATRE's.",1098662400,10,780,4.7555555555555555
7812924,5,6301599306,"After years of waiting, Faerie Tale Theatre fans can finally own the series on DVD. Shelley Duvall's series originally appeared on Showtime 20 years ago and featured well-known and rising stars of the time. The series' enthusiastic interpretations of beloved fairy tales has made it a cult classic. Better yet, the DVD prices are affordable, especially after the high prices the used VHS copies have been earning in recent years.
