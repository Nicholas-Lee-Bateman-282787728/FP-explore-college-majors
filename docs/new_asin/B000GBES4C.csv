8130299,3,B000GBES4C,"Boring video .  Wore black outfits with white background . lot of turns but not much you could use if you were dancing with new partner at dance . they didn't wear mics ,so its hard to hear them.  moves more country swing and old ballroom . would recommend dvd  ""Introduction to six count swing"" with Julee Mertz if you want swing from 1920s to 50s",1388275200,,348,4.242424242424242
8130300,5,B000GBES4C,"This is the best video I have found for East Coast (triple step) Swing.  I have several others, including some that are highly regarded by reviewers on Amazon.  What is great about this video is that it covers it all, from beginning steps clear through a large number of very complicated and beautiful moves.  There is more on this one video than one any 6 of my other ones combined.

The reason it is so good is that Baker and Taylor realize that it is a video, not a dance lesson.  Other videos don't do this.  What I mean by this is that in a lot of videos, the dancers will show you steps over and over again, like would be done during a live dance lesson.  What Baker and Taylor do, instead, is show you the different steps once (or maybe twice).  Then they count on you to rewind and watch it over and over.  Consequently, they get a whole lot more information onto this video than do other dance instructors.

The dance moves toward the end of the video are stunning.  I just hope I can find a partner willing to spend the time to learn them.

This dvd is the best, and by far the best for your money.",1185408000,7,1108,4.1745283018867925
