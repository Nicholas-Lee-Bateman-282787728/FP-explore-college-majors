8258305,3,B0015FNGJG,"Eager to own this title that is not yet available in the States under a Region 1 release, I tried out this offering from Spain (Region 2) and found it to be a little less worth the effort than I hoped for.  For one thing, it I apparent that the company used an old Turner video release of the film as its master; the picture quality is of a second or third generation copy.  (Pirated??)  Also, while the film is offered in a Spanish dubbed version, it is also offered in English with Spanish subtitles.  (Maybe not pirated after all.)  My only complaint is that the Spanish subtitles on the English language version are not optional and cannot be shut off.

I suppose I am glad to at least have access to a film I haven't seen in many years.  Still, it would be nice to have it in a Region 1 release in which the subtitles and video quality would not be an issue.  Buyers beware if you are a stickler for perfection.  The Spanish disc is not for you if you are.",1408233600,,961,4.179347826086956
