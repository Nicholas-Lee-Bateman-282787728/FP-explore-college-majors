8419809,3,6304450745,"Somewhat uncut - and should be. I read the other review about the 'f-word' being in this (I read it After I watched this video) - but don't recall hearing that word. They could have either done this as a highlights of Cops - Or - a few select examples of Great moments of Cops. - Instead they tried to ride the fence - and end up with Neither.
Video dated 1996. They offer little or No information as to what is going on.
I have most of the Cops DVD singles - but When or 'Are' Cops going to release some sort of DVD box set??
I have watched this on TV over the years - and there are a Lot better and interesting moments
I have seen that this selection.
Someone at Cops merchandising - is asleep at the wheel.
All in all - I'd skip this one - unless you just have to have Everything.",1386547200,2,783,3.962025316455696
