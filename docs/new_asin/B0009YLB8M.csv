2340705,5,B0009YLB8M,"Really enjoy this workout.  My whole lifestyle change started with the YBB live dvds and has continued to evolve.  Another great part of this is that my 6 year old niece likes to ""workout"" with me and do Hip Hop.  Even if she isn't doing all the steps, I feel good to be setting a good example and getting her to move around more.",1329350400,,330,4.125
2340706,3,B0009YLB8M,"The warm up did not really warm me up for cardio.  Maybe if it was my pilates/yoga day, sure, but not for cardio. The dance section was pretty good.  But oh man, the blonde instructor was pretty annoying.  She kept sticking her tongue out - STOP!  Otherwise I like their energy overall.  I just wish the warm up was an actual warm up for cardio and the blonde instructor kept her tongue in.",1309305600,,390,4.287671232876712

I liked this one's dance portion much better then the ones on Light & Easy, Latin & Cardio Cabaret.

I felt energized & positive after doing this & it made me want to exercise even more like all their other dvds. Their positive words were helpful to make me want to do this again & again. Gillian & Teigh have great body awareness and have great focused energy while still reminding you to always have fun & have the correct intentions as great as any great guru yogi master. (Teigh studied studied Kundalini yoga and meditation under Siri Sat Nam Singh for over 8 years & Anusara yoga with Desiree Rumbaugh and John Friend.)",1186185600,8,2013,4.497267759562842

2340710,1,B0009YLB8M,You are NOT getting what you see. Your getting part of an older dvd series that's worth about $8. Tells you AFTER you buy it that it's not what is pictured. Better of dealing with someone from Nigeria than this seller.,1174953600,9,218,4.341463414634147
2340711,4,B0009YLB8M,"I have the orginal YBB ballet workout, but this was my first exposure to one of the newer ones, including the Live series. In this video, instructors Gillian and Teigh teach live in front of a large studio class, leading in a tag team style; Ravi the drummer returns, and the music during the warm-up and cool-down is the same as in the original YBB.

The workout begins in a seated position. Gillian and Teigh instruct you to begin ujayyi breathing, and they then go into a Breath of Fire exercise (they don't explain either type of breathing). They also use mudras, or hand gestures, to help set an intention for the class. After this initial 2 1/2 minute section, you get to your feet for some warm-ups which Gillian says are dervived from jazz isolations; these simple moves last another 3 minutes.

Next comes the cardio portion of the workout. Gillian and Teigh teach a dance routine, gradually adding in steps and frequently taking it from the top.  I'm somewhat of a choreography klutz, but I was able to pick up all of the moves either the first or the second time through (although I have been doing other dancey videos lately, so that probably was a help). Most of the moves were fun--slide steps, hip shakes, etc.--but some felt a bit silly to me, like the odd cowboy move.  Overall, however, I enjoyed the cardio section--I wished it had been a little longer than 17 1/2 minutes, but I still got a pretty strenuous workout in that time.

The last segment is about 11 minutes long. The first 5 minutes of this is abs work using the YBB squishy ball; I don't have a ball, but substituing my Pilates ring plus a light dumbbell in some places worked fine. This was a decent abs workout, but again, it could have been a little longer. The last 6 minutes of the workout is a combination of a few additional strength moves--eg, planks, push-ups--combined with yoga stretching and more mudras, bringing the workout in at 34 minutes total.

Overall, I found this to be a fun, easy-to-follow workout--not necessarily the best dance video I have ever done, but one that I am likely to continue using.",1123804800,59,2102,4.577127659574468
8070462,5,B0009YLB8M,"Fun dance workout that builds on a progression.  Not particularly difficult choreography but a fun change to exercise program.  Would not consider this workout high impact, but I still sweated so I know I got my heart rate up.  Includes some basic yoga moves and ballet type stances and a AB workout.",1465344000,2,300,4.730769230769231

8070469,5,B0009YLB8M,"I was gotta order hip hop abs (newer version) but I saw this and it is cheaper I was thinking that as long I am dancing , my pounds might come off so it might not hurt to try it. it is only a few cents ...and when I tried it it is very engeric meaning if you can keep up with dance like steps faster and mixed then buy it. If you can't do it, you will have to buy something else because main part is dancing with faster steps (looking like taps) but it is like a fast mixed steps . You will feel like you are in club and dancing fast not slow but it get fast then faster! They won't let you relax ...lol. It is abt 10 min? I am not sure

At first she did a breathing excrise but I ingore and did it with Christ name because I think she trying get you to do some psychic breathing. I am not into psychic , I am christian. I will only ingore that part and relax in His name

Afterward that she wanna dance for abt 10 mins or 20

When it is done, she calm ya'll down with yoga mat and small yoga ball but you don't need small ball I usually lay there and do what she did like stretch and yoga",1359158400,,1089,3.726086956521739

8070471,5,B0009YLB8M,"My mother bought this workout video when it first hit the market, and she opened it, tryed it once, hated it and gave it to me. I let a ""friend"" ""borrow"" it and I never seen it from them again!, So I was ecstatic when I found out that amazon sold it, Now I love it for many reasons: 1.)It worked for me, I was in great shape while doing it! now everyone is different so I won't garuntee it'll work for everyone but, 2.)The price is worth trying it if your into this kinda workout. 3.) Its so upbeat and encouraging! I also like that they trainers feel like real people, they mess up now and then, they make funny noises, and they get so fired up, I love it!
Now the reason my mom hated it and the only small teeny dislike of mine is they don't breakdown move by move they kinda say it and do it and u have to try and keep up!",1357257600,,825,3.9166666666666665
