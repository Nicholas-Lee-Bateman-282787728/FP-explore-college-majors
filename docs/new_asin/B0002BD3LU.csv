8461212,5,B0002BD3LU,"I am 35 year veteran of this great game and have never come across a training tool as informative and helpful as this.  As a former minor leaguer and a current high school baseball coach, I'm always was looking for ways to improve baseball knowledge and training skills. A good friend and major league scout recommended ""Baseball Skills and Drills"" by Bragg A. Stockton and I thanked him repeatedly. This DVD breaks down every part of the game to its fundamental form and helped me incredibly. If you're looking for something to help your team or your individual child, this is the perfect training video.",1106611200,6,605,4.761904761904762
