7563201,5,B0195PEEGQ,"The movie was super.  We especially liked learning that the races that we witnessed in August of 2013 were included in the movie.  We also enjoyed learning about the drama of the young rider repeating as Palio champion two consecutive races, a feat we were unaware of before seeing the movie.",1453334400,4,292,4.705882352941177
7563202,5,B0195PEEGQ,"This is a beautiful film that conveys a great deal about Siena, the horserace known as the Palio, and the Jockeys that race in it. Its advertised as a documentaryand indeed its all factualbut its staged like and old-fashioned western, profiling the complexities and rivalries between both the districts of Siena (the contrade) and the jockeys they hire to race for them in their famed Palio. Filmmaker Cosima Spender is an astute observer of Siena and the Palio phenomenon, and has marvelously captured many elements of the race, the contrade, and the city itself. Highly recommended.

Siena is a jewel of a city in the heart of the Tuscan hills. The ancient city is enclosed by walls, and (by virtue of being subdued by Florentines in the 1500s), was isolated and thus preserved in its mediaeval splendor.  Within the city walls are 17 self-governing districts (contrade) each with their own identity, culture and membership. Birth into, or membership in, a contrada defines the people of Siena and their social interactionsperhaps moreso than in any other Italian city.

Endlessly studied by social anthropologists, the Palio horse race is the most prominent manifestation of citys cultural identity and that of each district. Normally held twice each summer (July 2 and August 16th), it comprises a bare-backed horse race 3 times around the main piazza in Siena, which is covered in local Tuscan dirt for the occasion.

Although each race lasts only about 90 seconds, the contrade live and breathe the events year-round. As one citizen told me, we prepare for each Palio for 6 months and then spend the next 6 months recovering. Indeed, the palio cycle never really ends among contrada members (contradioli). It is, for them, almost quasi-religious: it epitomizes the relationship between man and fate: what can men control through their actions, and what is left to fate? What can men do when fate casts them a lucky choice or a setback? The tribal emotions brought forth during the 4 days around each Palio are so intense that they have to be  seen to be believed.

The film itself uses the jockeys as a focal point to portray the Palio phenomenon. This is an interesting approach, since, (in the end), the Jockeys must execute on the race strategy of the contrada that hired them, deal with the horses and competing jockeys and make last-minute adjustments before and during the race. I especially enjoyed the insights from the Jockeys, both current and retired. Youd rarely hear this from contradioli, who dismissively see jockeys as mercenaries, to be discarded when the race is finished.

The film is beautifully shot; editing and cinematography are just first rate. More importantly, as a documentary, it succeeds in bringing to life many aspects of the Palio experience within Siena. Its also effectively uses the interplay of the jockeys (both current and past) to underscore the many-layered complexities of this horse race as a metaphor for life within a provincial Italian town, poised between modernity and centuries-old rivalries that are never far beneath the surface.

Ive ardently observed the Palio for 20+ years, and my son is a baptized member of a contrada. I was excited to see this film come to fruition, and not least because I felt it was safe in the hands of director Cosima Spender and producer John Hunt. Their visuals go a long way to breathing life into the many books that have been written about Siena and its horserace.

However, any film has a point of view that governs editing and plot choices, but of necessity leaves things out. For example, the focus on the jockeys in ""Palio"" provides a great dramatic arc to the story, but maybe inadvertently downplays other aspects of the overall Palio drama:

--The Jockeys may be passionate, but its nothing when compared to typical contrada members. The film could have conveyed more of the intensity of the districts for whom the jockeys race. The Palio engulfs nearly all citizens with a sheer ferocity that is hard to explain. Its impossible to overestimate the emotion displayed by the Senese during the 4 Giorni di Palio in July and August. Their emotionsas reflected in crowd behavior during key points in the processcan be downright frightening, and they make few accommodations or observe niceties for outsiders. (In this sense Siena is still a very closed mediaeval city).

-- The role of the jockey is but one subset of the totality of the Palio. It would be a mistake to assume the jockeys alone determine the entire outcome. The 4 days surrounding each palio are merely the last act of a year-long play, and the 10 minutes surrounding the actual race are just the final scene in the final act. The play startsif indeed it ever really endsthe year before. Strategizing and bargaining amongst contrada officials (capitani) goes on year round, and can start even 13+ months before a race, when 7 of the 10 districts racing are known for the following year. A full month before each Palio, the full slate of 10 districts is identified, and everything kicks into much higher gear.well before horsesor jockeysare finalized. Yes, jockeys can spend money at the last minute, but those amounts often pale in comparison to the deals made well before the race itselfbetween capitani.

--Fate is a cruel mistress, and even the most influential jockeys cant fix everything.. Despite dark mutterings in the film that certain jockeys control everything, in reality, it doesnt always work out that way. Thats why the Senese view the race as a metaphor for life and fate.

These are nits, however. This is a great film and if you have any interest in this race or the city of Siena and its people, Id highly recommend watching it.",1452729600,4,5707,4.907676348547718

8744091,5,B0195PEEGQ,"This is a moving, sexy and thrilling insight into the circus that is the Palio. It has it clowns, animals, trapeze artists and circus generals, intermingled with pick pockets, glamour and dodgy characters. Cosima Spender delivers a masterpiece with an epic feel, yet tender and tense like a thriller. It is all there!
