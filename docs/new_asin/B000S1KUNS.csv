8203848,4,B000S1KUNS,"Due to what was done to Joe Wilsons wife, Valerie Plame, in her being ""outed"" by this gov't of ours after her husband wrote that ""yellow-cake"" as it was called hadn't been bought by or even Saddam's people hadn't gone to find out about it & my gov't took the steps it did, I'm not saying Saddam didn't need to be gone from power.  I couldn't learn enough about that situation--watched the hearing of his wife on c-span, everything gov't was saying, the Skooter Libby trial & Chaney leting Libby take the rap.  What was really disappointing about Libby's outcome was he paid $250,000.00--was sentenced to prison time.  Then Bush commutted his sentence for prison the minute the trial was over.  That told me a lot of how Chaney had influenced everything.",1296864000,,753,4.681818181818182
8203849,5,B000S1KUNS,"We watched this Video from a title we chose at our Public Library.  After viewing, I ordered it to keep for my grandchildren to watch at a future time.  It is a historical event that bears scrutiny by future generations.  It is truthful, insiteful and bears out our original gut feeling that our President was acting far too soon.",1226188800,,330,4.559322033898305
8203850,3,B000S1KUNS,"I've seen this DVD at least three time before I felt I could write about it. One problem I had was putting all of it in context. It's because the ""Rush to War"" was not just about a rush to war. It was about many topics including the rush to war. It was easy to follow when being viewed, but extremely difficult to write about.

This DVD examines the reasons behind the attacks of 9/11, which includes our history of giving precedence to our support for repressive regimes that served the US interests, rather than the spread of liberty and democracy. Unfortunately, numerous examples abound such as Guatamala, Iran, and Chile where democratically elected governments where overthrown in favor of governments that served our interests.

The ""Rush to War"" finally gets around to the lead-up to the war and the lies told by the administration regarding weapons of mass destruction (WMD), yellow cake, reconstituted nuclear weapons programs, and the imminent ""mushroom cloud,"" permeating another cloud of fear in this country, and the penchant for moving rashly and foolishly into Iraq. This part concludes that not one WMD was found, and that there was no connection at all, between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. David Kay's lecture here is particularly powerful.

That alone would have been enough, but Robert Taicher wanted to explore more, so he included the abu-Ghraib scandal, the detention of Jose Padilla as an enemy combatant, the exposure of Valerie Plame as a CIA operative, the arrest and conviction of Scooter Libby, and the most poignant of all, and an interview with parents who lost their son in Iraq. What made it so touching was that it was coupled with George W. Bush's speech where he jokes about not being able to find WMD with pictures of him looking under various pieces of furniture in the Oval Office. The message is clear: Whether as an intelligence failure or outright deception, George Bush, at the very least appears grossly insensitive, by making light of an appalling decision that had already cost the lives of hundreds of Americans. The mother who lost her son gives his humor the litmus test: ""Would George Bush have done the same in front of the families of the deceased?""

These topics are discussed through the eyes of several illuminaries such as Chris Hedges, General Anthony Zinni (ret), Noam Chomsky, Robert Scheer, Molly Ivans, George McGovern and others. Several quotes add to the story form James Madison, Hermann Goering, George Herbert Walker Bush, and even Adolf Hitler (in a cynical way) reveal wisdom that adds to the theme Robert Taicher is attempting to convey.

Two things I had trouble with about this DVD: It strayed from the thesis. It was all over the political landscape. It would have been more comprehensible if he stayed on the reasons behind world animosity to the US, and our manipulation of intelligence to take us to war. The second source of annoyance was the monotonous, drone-like voice of John Doman. It was worse than Kevin Costner's in ""Dances with Wolves,"" and I didn't think anything could be as bad as that!

This is an excellent, overall discussion of geo-political strategy and blunders of the past seven years. It is also an example of what a government, in the name of security is willing to do. The commentary is outstanding. When Robert Scheer states, that by giving up our liberty for security we have given the terrorists a victory, it is a message worth remembering. While the content is completely worthwhile, it is out of context with its title.

It should have been called, ""Everything That's Gone Wrong.""",1212969600,85,3585,4.8962108731466225
8203851,5,B000S1KUNS,"Excellent documentary, thanks for exposing the truth on the Bush administration. May God forgive the United States for what were doing, Hitler/Bush its hard to tell the difference in then & now.",1212451200,,194,5.09375
8203852,4,B000S1KUNS,"""Rush to War"" is a very good political documentary. It examines American foreign policy after 9/11. The title is a little misleading, however. The film deals less with the lead-up to the Iraq War than with the foreign policy blunders the Bush Administration made after 9/11. Although the film is a little one-sided (liberal), it still brings up good points and sheds some light on the inner workings of our government.",1195603200,,418,4.901408450704225
8203853,4,B000S1KUNS,"Solid information very passionately delivered.  Molly Ivins calls it like it is, and it is great to be reminded of the wisdom of George McGovern. The 45 minute interview with Joe Wilson was incredibly informative -- he was able to expand on events involving the Valerie Plame outing that he normally only gets 3 or 4 minutes on talk shows to explain.",1193356800,4,350,4.645161290322581
