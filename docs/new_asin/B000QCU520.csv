8195540,1,B000QCU520,"I'm watching Ozu in the middle of a personal research project about the way the ""fleeting world"" has left an imprint in Japanese visual arts, and particularly, cinema and cinematographic technique. It was natural to find this title, but right after I placed my order I had the chance to see it, and I changed my mind. I've come to understand why some people (maybe most people) can consider Ozu's films as slow or boring, but I've also realized they are really far from that. It's just that the stitches are so carefully crafted, that you cease watching ""acting"", ""lighting"", ""editing"", etc, and you start to see something dramatically ""life-like"" unfoolding before your eyes. There's no drama the way you see it in films, but drama the way it happens in your house, with your family, with your parents or your siblings, everytime something changes in our lives. And you don't have to be Japanese to get it.
Since People like Jarmusch seemed to get it when he did the segment of the young Japanese couple in ""Mystery Train"", I thought this homage from Kiarostami was in line with that ""reading"" of Ozu.
But I was wrong. I saw this film before my DVD arrived, and now I think  Kiarostami simply didn't get Ozu and made a willingly boring film as an homage to the Japanese director, who never did a boring piece as far as his surviving films can testify.
If his intention was to mimic the ""cushion"" shots between scenes in Ozu's films, those shots worked in context, and only partially accounted for Ozu's style. And even Ozu didn't extend those shots more than it was necessary.
Although I tried to cancel my order, my DVD finally arrived, but I won't give it away, and I'll try to leave it close to Jarmusch's ""Mystery Train"", at least because it makes you wonder. I won't say this is a film you shouldn't watch, because that would be extremely unfair. But it's a Kiarostami film, and I don't think it adds anything to the way Ozu can be watched and enjoyed.",1396828800,,1958,4.578347578347579
