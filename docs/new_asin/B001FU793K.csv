3589320,2,B001FU793K,"An hero who has to deal with the real problems of the elementary school,
a head master who takes bribes and some seriously disturbed teachers
makes for some comedy when an inspector shows up from the district board.
But the inspector is an old  classmate of the hero... a crush he never forgot. With all this build up we are hoping for the bad guy to get his and the school and teachers to bounce back? The teachers when approached
don't seem to care except for keeping their jobs: school shuts down they go to other schools like the kids.
The fight is on...
Mostly if you can read and multiply,
you can call your American elementary school life a success?
God forbid, they should actually teach you something you can use?
I think my teacher that taught us to have basic manners
may have been the best I got.
How do you feel about your children wasting their first 6 years?
For me it seems that real education should start sooner
and have more kick, not be a subject of comedy about recess fights.
Enjoy this movie if you can?!",1225238400,,1027,4.37696335078534
3589321,4,B001FU793K,"Jason Biggs plays a failed hostage negotiator who decides to take a less stressful job as a guidance councelor at a failing elementary school being run into the ground by a crooked principal played by Rob Corddry. Eva Longoria plays a school distict auditor with a ""slight"" drug addiction that has been hired to determine why the little school is in trouble. For Jason, Eva was the one girl that got away that he never could forget. Laugh out loud funny.",1301875200,,454,4.617283950617284
3589322,4,B001FU793K,"This movie is rated R and takes place at an elementary school so have that in mind while watching. It does take it to the next level and has many scenarios that you would never want to happen at your kid's elementary school, but that's what makes it so funny. Many times comedies are supposed to change it up and take it to the next level. Starring Jason Biggs, who has never had a problem being in comedies with absurd and crude qualities (ex: the american pies) delivers in this movie. Eva Longoria, is quite hilarious in this too. Yes, very attractive too but if you have seen her in Desperate Housewives you already know that she can deliver when it comes to comedy. Then you have the villain.............Rob Corddry. I'd say he steals the movie. If you haven't seen him before he's always a comedic mastermind. Hot Tub Time Machine would not have been the same without his overthetop character. And anything with kids doing something vulgar has always made me laugh.",1291593600,2,971,4.618497109826589
3589323,4,B001FU793K,"Not only did this movie introduce me to Zacharias' amazing song, ""I'm in Edukashun,"" it almost single-handedly (though not always smoothly) paves over the ham-handed attempt at 'inspiring' teachers with films like ""Freedom Writers.""

Critics seem to have a knee-jerk reaction to dark humor; it's hit-or-miss depending on who's doing the critiquing. Personally, I loved the blithely satirical reality of an elementary school where the students wait on the Principal hand and foot, and offer relationship advice to their lovelorn and emotionally constipated educators. ""Lower Learning"" allows kids to say the darnedest things, with the added benefit of Bill Cosby being nowhere in sight. Instead, we get the always-funny Rob Corddry, and Jason Biggs/Eva Longoria, who played their parts well enough.

More than the humor, however, I like to think the reality of the educational world is somewhere between teachers like Erin Gruwell and, well, someone who would threaten a student with the punishment of ""being tied to Smelly Alice again"". In complete honesty, I'm pretty sure more of them tend towards the latter. ""Lower Learning,"" then, lets us actually see ourselves on-screen, or at least the self we would be if our school principal took chocolate baths every day in his office. Somehow, self-awareness makes ""Lower Learning"" easier to swallow (and a much more 'fun' ride!) than any teaching movie starring Hilary Swank.",1275350400,,1422,5.34375
3589324,2,B001FU793K,"This movie was somewhat funny and goofy. I found my self laughing out loud at various things. Spoilers: for example, the principal with his team of white gloved army of elementary aged butlers who instead of being in class are busy serving wine and lobster. The board of education inspector who randomly does drugs in the middle of conversations (like sniffing spraypaint out of a paper bag). A turtle-obsessed teacher who is best friends with his students and congregates with them as if they are adults.

It seems like it was once a hilarious movie on paper (and maybe even on film) but somewhere along the way, the execution was messed up. Maybe in the editing room if I had to guess: tThere's little if any music, the pacing is too slow, they should have cut the movie down a bit, things like that. I figured it might be a dark comedy at one point, but not long after I came to the conclusion that it was just dry and boring.

It might be worth renting and seeing once, that's about it. It wasn't that great of an experience.",1271030400,,1029,4.439153439153439
3589325,1,B001FU793K,"I found this movie in the to for $[...] bin at the HEB market. I had gotten some great titles there that were pretty decent Rocky among others that were at least good enough to keep in my collection even though some of them, I would never watch again. In this movie it's nauseating right from the start. It shows a principal at an elementary school that has an office with appointments like jeweled globes, inlaid burl wood paneling and a teakwood desk. All that didn't seem too much out of the ordinary, if not plausible. Then they showed a scene of him doing a line of coke or some other type of drug and this is where I drew the line. I decided that this movie wasn't even worth watching despite the star power of Eva Longoria and Jason Biggs. I couldn't even stand to watch it long enough to see her in it. I don't know, being a teacher probably tilted my perception somewhat by deciding that this movie had to be a ridiculous mistake when it was made and an equally bad decision on my part to buy it. The fact that the elementary school was named after Geraldine Ferraro added more to the ridiculousness of the picture. If you want to see Eva Longoria in a film with a little more credibility, check out the Sentinel. I admit to making a mistake in forking out the 16 bucks to see that one in the theater but would not hesitate for diving for it if I see it at the bargain bin at HEB. The bottom line is I wouldn't even give this movie as a present to my worst enemy, Seeing a principal doing drugs in a school was just too disgusting for me. I'm sorry.

3589326,4,B001FU793K,"This movie does have STRONG language, etc.., But if you'll understand that is why the movie titled, ""LOWER LEARNING"" the lowest of the low (Uneducated) tends to associate with bad language.  If you are offended don't watch this movie.  Giving only Four Star, because the end needs to extend to a happier ending where the principal and superintendent gets punished, but normally movies with single-layer dvd tends to fall short of good endings.",1243728000,,443,5.054794520547945
3589327,1,B001FU793K,"Unlike other reviewers, I was not offended by this movie. It was just complete GARBAGE! I wouldn't even want this movie to serve as a coaster because it would be a constant reminder that I watched it. Thankfully, I rented this movie, and even then I wanted to destroy the Disc. I roughly returned this junk heap back to blockbuster.
The argument that I am not the target audience would not apply to me, because I love movies such as American Pie, Sex Drive, Road Trip, and other raunchy comedies. I believe if a talented writer and director were attached to this movie, it would have been at the least decent. Even the two hot girls in this movie weren't enough to save this POS. It does surprise me that these well known actors agreed to do this. I don't write reviews but I was pissed and this had to be published to save others. I guess that's the humanitarian in me. For the Love of God, stay away, or you shall suffer the wrath of complete boredom.",1239926400,3,953,4.359550561797753
3589328,1,B001FU793K,"I have enjoyed some of Jason Biggs past films since it is mindless, simple humor.  But, this is nothing like American Pie, Road Trip, or that sort of movie. It involves a bunch of screwed up teachers in an elementary school. Cursing, smoking / doing drugs, and cracking raunchy jokes to 6-8 year old kids is not funny.  It is disturbing.  At best, this movie is background noise while you're doing something else.

Avoid wasting your money and watch something else. This movie is pure garbage.

Also, as to the comment that this is like Family Guy:  This is nothing like that cartoon (which I enjoy!).  These are adults and real elementary school age kids.  It doesn't mix well -- at all.  The net effect is that you actually feel sorry for the kids (who are portrayed as helpless in a poorly run school) rather than amused by the situation.",1233446400,2,841,4.553333333333334
3589329,4,B001FU793K,"Lower Learning is surprisingly funny at times... it feels like one big improv skit (And the deleted scenes seem to attest to that theory, as 35+ jokes are thrown out there, and only the best 5 are used), and for this movie, it mostly works. The cast is tremendous, I didn't expect to see so many familiar faces, and most are well-known for their roles in movies like this. The stand out for me, in a field of all of these other comic actors is Monica Potter. She is relatively unknown to me, other than a few movies she has been in, and she manages to deliver some of the funniest lines as a down on her luck teacher who is going through a bad marriage. Much of the comedy of Lower Learning is based on kids ""saying the darndest things"", but not all of it. The plot of the story is basically Jason Biggs vs. Rob Corddry in a fight to save a struggling school. Also surprising is some of the stuff Longoria gets to do. She has a running gag as a troubled woman who inhales paint fumes, Cool whip can fumes, chews tobacco, drinks whiskey, abuses pain pills and more. When confronted about her issues, she becomes defensive and asks: ""What is this Nuremberg?"", ""What is this Salem""? She actually had some funny lines here, I'll give her credit for that.",1232236800,5,1250,4.346153846153846
3589330,5,B001FU793K,"I knew when I rented Lower Learning that I'd have to adapt my standards to the direct to DVD level to enjoy it, but I was in the mood for a cheap laugh. I wasn't offended by this film. I found it to be quite funny at times. Maybe the people who are reviewing this are not the film's target audience, because there is nothing in Lower Learning that would offend fans of Family Guy, for example, and I think that people who find Family Guy funny will find something to laugh about in Lower Learning.",1231372800,3,497,4.1875

8302782,3,B001FU793K,"Lower Learning is funny and a wild ride. From the teachers drinking to
the principal having lobsters delivered to his office, you are in for a
roaring good time. Within Lower Learning there is tons and tons of
tongue and cheek humor, with is not only at times witty but also smart.

With a cast like this I wish they would have let them do what they do
best. Eva Longoria plays a role that many have never seen her in before
and it is sort of refreshing. Jason Biggs is raunchy and full of laughs
but the role seemed a bit stretched and unnatural. I also wish that it
focused on the problem at hand and the whole film seemed a but rushed.

If you are looking for a film that will make you laugh this one is it!",1363651200,,710,4.064285714285714
8302783,4,B001FU793K,"In Lower Learning, Tom Willowman (Jason Biggs) is the vice principal of a horrid elementary school and does everything he can to stop the school from being shut down. This movie is a pure comedy. Do not watch this, expecting an amazing story or acting. I think people who grow up watching Hollywood movies, unconsciously train themselves to judge a movie based on its story. I judge comedies based on how funny they are; this film was made for laughs and I thought it was hilarious. The nature of this story is really over the top and absurd. The teachers curse at the students and the principal basically uses the students as his personal slaves. The comedic moments are based around shock-value. I personally am not a fan of shock-value humor but I really laughed at this movie because I think the jokes are a bit witty as well. I really like the absurdity of the film and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh.",1360108800,,929,4.535714285714286

8302785,3,B001FU793K,"If you're looking for a fun, no pressure movie that you can just sit back and relax with, this one's for you. Not the most complicated of plots, but certainly has its funny parts and charm. Rob Corddry is a comedic genius in my opinion, and I always enjoy his performances. This movie was no exception. Overall a good time, if you're aware of what you're watching, which is a simple comedic picture.",1343692800,,399,4.47945205479452
8302786,3,B001FU793K,"Rob Corddry stars as Principal Harper Billings at Geraldine Ferraro Elementary. He has been embezzling money from the school district. He has run the school in a manner that would induce failure, so when the school closes down, he can pocket the money.  The teachers make Cameron Diaz look like teacher of the year. Assistant principal Tom Willoman (Jason Biggs) gets wind of the plan and with the help of Eva Longoria they plan to save the school.

Some of the humor was disrespectful. The kid dragging a worn American flag across the ground, flying it at half mast, and passing gas as if to salute it, was not the type of humor I enjoyed. The teachers drinking, smoking, dropping the f-bomb in front of the kids and abusing them emotionally...okay that was funny. Will Sasso fans will agree he gave us a good performance as a moping gym teacher who allows his students to have inter-gender boxing until they brain hemorrhage.

There were a number of funny moments, but there were also scenes that didn't work (like the flag scene) which dragged the film down. For those who can't get enough of over the top children being abused scenes, this is your film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, drinking, drug use, no sex, no nudity.",1340668800,,1221,4.691588785046729
8302787,5,B001FU793K,"Lower Learning is Hilarious!!! With a cast led by Jason Biggs, Eva Longoria Parker and Rob Corddry, this movie is a gem. The acting is stellar and it is a brand of comedy that rivals The Hangover. It's amazing that this movie was made independently because the production value and style are that of a studio picture. I would recommend this film highly to anyone I know. If you are in the mood to laugh and have a rip roaring, hilarious adventure check out Lower Learning.",1302566400,,472,4.5
