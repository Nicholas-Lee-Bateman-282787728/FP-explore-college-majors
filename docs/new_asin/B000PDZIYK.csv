8190638,5,B000PDZIYK,"I wish more or Robin Miller's shows were available on dvd!  She had the perfect format - prep everything one day a week - then super quick and easy meals that just need to be assembled during the week, pronto!

Great set for those that love to cook - but don't want to spend every single day cooking from scratch!",1361145600,7,313,4.2
8190639,5,B000PDZIYK,Robin Miller is My Guru. I have been making the recipes from this Vol 1. WOW!! I have been prepping sauces and different styles of pasta all today. We have a stretch of 100 degree weather starting tomorrow. My duplex gets real hot so I am ready with tasty great meals. Hubby will be happy. Thanks Robin Miller.,1248480000,5,310,4.362068965517241
