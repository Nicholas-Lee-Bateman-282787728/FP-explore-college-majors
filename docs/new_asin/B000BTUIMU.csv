8540630,5,B000BTUIMU,"It's been many years since my younger brothers and sisters watched the Donut Repair Club videos and I secretly enjoyed them at the same time.  Now I'm a mother of two who still remembers the songs and stories of the Donut movies we watched all those years ago, and my four year old has recently been introduced to the Donut Man and his crew as well.

I most highly recommend the first two Donut Repair Club movies, although there are many subsequent incarnations.  Despite the desperately outdated clothing and hair styles, I bet you and yours will find yourselves singing along with these fun, memorable movies.",1199491200,,612,4.754716981132075
