2203899,3,B0007808A2,"I was really excited about this movie, but I found it underwhelming and at times just plain bad.  I need to read the novel, and maybe it was the accents that threw me (beings that it was hard to hear and or follow at times) but that's never been an issue with me before, especially if the movie is good.  That isn't to say that `Brighton Rock' is bad, but it just didn't do it for me like I wanted it to.  Overall, the performances were stellar, except for Richard Attenborough, who I found to be a major weak link.  Seriously, what is with all the boundless praise for his performance?  I found it clich&eacute;d and at times totally unbelievable.  The actors around him certainly drove the film for him.  The direction was also nicely crafted and the mood was set beautifully, with expert cinematography that milked the screen, creating a character all its own in Brighton.

Still, the film is lacking.

I found it a struggle to get on board with the films actual prose, which I found to be ineffectively constructed.  The idea of a hoodlum marrying a girl he loathes just to drive her to suicide so she can't squeal on him for bumping off a rival is far fetched and really needs serious innovation used to give it even the remotest air of honesty.  I mean, if he was so willing to kill a man why wouldn't he kill the girl?  It just doesn't make sense, and I don't get the impression from `Brighton Rock' that it wanted us to suspend disbelief.

Still, I can't say that this was a total waste because it wasn't.  Like I said, the supporting cast was seriously stellar, especially Carol Marsh who sunk her teeth into that nave role of Rose, the beautiful waitress who marries a monster.  The final scene, with the record, is phenomenally played out.

Hauntingly effective considering the lack of conviction I got from the film as a whole.

Hermoine Baddeley and William Hartnell were equally impressive, but I find it sad that the main thing I got from this film was the insatiably need to own a suit like the one Hartnell's character Dallow sports throughout the entire film.

Alas, the film needed that extra something to take it over the edge, but it never got it.  This is sad since it had all the makings of a memorably crime thriller.  While it remains visually captivating, the lack of follow-through (plot-wise) makes `Brighton Rock' a failed attempt at something great.",1296432000,,2379,4.552941176470588

I thought this was a finely acted british gangster movie with standout performances, especially by richard attenborough as pinkie,(And like someone said here already... it's amazing he wasn't typecast as a mobster for this great performance!) carol marsh as his naive and sweet lover waitress,Hermione baddeley- as the lady who tries to protect the good waitress from the evil pinkie brown mobster-knowing he was probably involved in more then one murder or two.and william hartnell as pinkies henchmen who does some protecting of the young waitress himself. great movie all around.

2203901,5,B0007808A2,"('Young Scarface' is the American Title for 'Brighton Rock')

`Brighton Rock' is essentially a tale of a teenage gangster, Pinkie Brown, and his attempts to silence a potential witness, Rose, to a crime. John Boulting (Thunder Rock, 1942; I'm All Right Jack, 1959) directed it in 1947 and was producer by his twin brother Roy. The screenplay was adapted from the Graham Greene novel of the same name by Terence Rattigan. There are significant differences at the ending of the film in relation to the novel (the book is more brutal) but I think that it takes nothing away from the film or the book. Due to BBFC rules at the time some changes had to made to the intended ending (the record scene) of the film because they wanted it to have a happy ending, which I think in retrospect made it better. The only feature really missing is the strength of character development one could only expect from a novel. However saying all that, the adaptation is excellent.

`Brighton Rock' featured two brilliant performances from Richard Attenborough (In Which We Serve, 1942; A Matter Of Life And Death, 1946) as Pinkie and Carol Marsh as Rose. Richard's performance is a career highlight for him, which could be regarded as the emergence of the `angry young man' in British cinema, but it was Carol's performance that I really loved. Her performance of innocence is something we so rarely see in modern cinema that it is remarkably refreshing to watch. One thing worth pointing out though is that Rose in the novel was not quite as pretty and we see more of her family life and the possible reason for her attachment to Pinkie. Carol Marsh never made many other significant films that I feel it's a bit of a shame because I think we've missed something there. I place her performance alongside Dorothy Malone's bit part in `The Big Sleep' (1946) who we also never saw enough of sadly.

Cinematography on `Brighton Rock' was by Gilbert Taylor who would later work on films such as `Repulsion' (Polanski, 1965) `Dr Strangelove' (Kubrick, 1964) and the much loved `Star Wars' (Lucas, 1977). Other films adapted from Graham Greene novels worth watching are `This Gun For Hire' (Tuttle, 1942) which has a similar theme and the excellent `The Third Man' (Reed, 1949). I loved this film and I loved the novel and I recommend both to you.

2203913,5,B0007808A2,"This year's Film Noir Festival at the American Film Institute has an international focus, ""exploding the long-held belief that noir stories and styles are a specifically American phenomenon.""  With this goal, the festival presented this 1947 British gangster film, ""Brighton Rock"", which the British Film Institute lists as no. 15 of the 100 best British films.  Besides seeing this film on a large screen in a beautiful theater,  I had the opportunity to hear a succinct introduction to the movie by the scholar of noir film, Foster Hirsch.

""Brighton Rock"" was the first film setting of a novel by Graham Greene.  Greene also wrote the screenplay in collaboration with Terrence Rattigan. John Boulting directed the film, but the primary attraction is the acting by a young Richard Attenborough, 24 years old at the time of this film.  Attenborough plays a lean, snarling and psychotic Pinky Brown who leads a small gang of older men in the British resort village of Brighton. Attenborough acts with a sharp coldness and a hard stare in his eyes throughout. His hands nervously twitch around a rope which could be used for a whip or a garrotte. At 17, Pinkie is already a cool hardened cynical killer with a puritan streak -- no drinks, tobacco, or drugs and little interest in sex.

The convoluted plot of the film turns on a gang war between Pinkie's small group and a much larger and more powerful Brighton gang for control of the races and slot machines.  Pinkie rashly is attempting to muscle in. In the course of the conflict a newspaper reporter is killed and Pinkie must kill further to cover his tracks.  Among his victims is an innocent young witness, a waitress named Rose, played by Carol Marsh who also gives a beautiful performance of a nave, gullible, lonely woman who falls in love with a hard, cruel man.  Pinkie marries Carol to prevent her from giving testimony against him.  A third well played role in the film is given by Hermione Bradley who portrays a busy-body middle-aged woman who pursues Pinky for his crimes even while the police are ready to give up.

The film has a strong noir sense with its sharply etched black-and-white cinematography. The film is set both in the amusement park area on the beach as well as in the alleys and backstreets which included old rooming houses and pubs and an aggressive criminal element. With the book and script by Greene, the film also includes a strong positive emphasis on Catholicism and on redemption, particularly in an ironic scene at the movie's close.

I was fortunate to have the opportunity to see ""Brighton Rock"" onscreen and to have the benefit as well of an informed commentary.  Fans of noir or of gangster films or British films will enjoy this movie.

2203926,4,B0007808A2,"""Brighton Rock,"" (1947) is a classic 92-minute black and white film noir adaptation of outstanding British author Graham Greene's classic, early career, downbeat novel of the same name,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brighton-Rock/dp/1441703861/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brighton Rock</a>. This British mystery/romantic crime drama/thriller was actually adapted for the screen by the 20th century figure Greene himself, working with noted British playwright/screenwriter Terence Rattigan, and was directed by John Boulting, soon to become a comic icon through his work at Ealing Studios.

The production is, of course, set in Brighton, once a quiet seaside resort town, with some historic artifacts and buildings from the days when it was a favorite royal resort.  The Brighton Pavilion, which we see here, and I've managed to see a couple of times in my life, is an exotic fantasy made beautiful reality.  Nevertheless, Brighton did, in the 1930s, enter rather a high-crime period, much of it centered on the city's race track.  The rivalry between gangster Pinky Brown's gang and the bigger, more efficient one run by Colletti provides the background, with a riveting scene at the racetrack, where Colletti's boys are waving around straight razors.  Soon Pinky, who runs a protection racket at the race course, has ordered the death of Fred Hale, member of Coletti's gang.  The police believe the rival mobster's death to be suicide.  But Ida Arnold was with Fred just before he died, and does not believe he killed himself.  She sets out to find the truth.  The none-too-bright Rose, who waitresses at the local tea room, Snow's, has somehow witnessed the murder. Older and wiser heads in his gang advise Pinky to romance, seduce and marry the waitress, in hopes of preventing her telling the police what she saw. So Pinky begins  this program, which he finds rather distasteful. But, unfortunately, he has been destabilized by recent events; he will become more desperate and violent, and will begin to act out in ultimately self-destructive ways.  Pinky murders one of one of his own gang on a beach front amusement park ride; tries to cover it up, and has growing difficulty dealing with his people.

A young Richard Attenborough, at the start of his long, prolific, greatly honored career, as actor/ director/producer, stars as Pinky.  Lord Richard Attenborough, as he now is styled, gives a performance full of menace and malice that I, for one, having only seen some of his later work, never imagined he had in him.  In the 1950s, Attenborough worked in several successful Ealing comedies, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-m-All-Right-Jack/dp/B00007AJE5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I'm All Right Jack</a>.

The picture's b/w cinematography, by Harry Waxman, is superb, deep focused, and moody, and, for once, the sea looks threatening, rather than that picture postcard bright smiley blue.  The gang members also look a lot meaner in this black and white treatment than they ever could in color.

2203930,4,B0007808A2,"If you like classic gangster-psychology films like ""Little Caesar"" and ""The Public Enemy"", you will probably enjoy this original film adaptation of Graham Greene's novel set in crumbling 1930s Brighton.  The recent remake transplanted the story to the 60s and changed quite a few more details; I think this original is better, and it regularly makes lists of top British films as well.  The main character is a psychopathic teenage gangster named Pinkie (played by a very young Richard Attenborough), and he is truly menacing to the point where he can practically scare people to death.  When a newspaperman on assignment to Brighton runs afoul of Pinkie's mob and later turns up dead, a blowzy boardwalk performer, Ida (Hermione Baddeley) is convinced that Pinkie killed him and sets out to prove it and see justice done.  Meanwhile, Pinkie is romancing a very young and naive waitress, Rose, who also happens to be a witness, and Ida becomes concerned with protecting her as well.  Rose, of course, is the classic good girl who thinks she can help save a very bad guy just by loving him enough, and even if she can't save him, she's willing to go to the ends of the earth and die trying.

Will Rose wise up and escape in one piece?  Will Pinkie have a last-minute redemption through the power of love?  Will Ida succeed in getting the cops to take an interest before Rose and/or herself end up dead?  Oddly, there's not as much suspense to all of this as you'd expect, even if you haven't read Greene's book and don't know how it's going to turn out (although if you have read the book, the film's ending differs from it slightly - just enough to be interesting in its own right).  Perhaps the lack of thrills is partly due to liberal use of Catholic symbology of heaven, hell (represented by fire), death, and other holy allusions (another ""witness"" is a blind man being led by a little girl) signifying that in the end, everybody is bound to get the ""reward"" they deserve, and the only question is how they're going to get there.  It's still a good, solid, well-made and well-acted film, and the emphasis on Rose's Catholicism is in keeping with Greene's work.  Also wonderful to see Baddeley in a long meaty role, sort of like a younger brash Jessica Fletcher, rather than her usual character roles as a maid or neighbor or whatnot.  She was one heck of an actress.  It's too bad that in her era, there weren't tons of leading roles for chubby fortyish ladies.

Overall, I recommend this version.  It's so awesome, I have no idea why someone felt a need to remake it.  About my only complaint is that the characters' accents and slang can be a little hard for Americans to understand - you need to know that a ""blower"" means the telephone, for instance.  But not too far removed from similarly slang-ridden US vintage gangster films.",1336348800,3,2838,4.642

2203932,2,B0007808A2,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE FEBRUARY 2011 UK ""BLU RAY"" REISSUE ***

I not sure 'what' exactly has been 'digitally remastered' on this BLU RAY reissue (as the cover loudly proclaims), but it sure ain't the print.

There are scratches on the negative, lines in some scenes, blurriness in others and a general slapdash feel to the whole thing. If this has been supposedly restored, then I can't see where...

If you're a lover of the film, then I'd say hire the BLU RAY 'before' you buy to avoid disappointment...",1303689600,5,509,4.571428571428571

The audio is excellent as well, but the fast British dialogue is sometimes a bit much for this Yank to decipher---no fault of Nostalgia Family, but subtitles would have helped.

8045601,5,B0007808A2,"A beautiful movie, a gem.  I cannot believe that more people are not aware of this movie.  The acting is tops:  Richard Attenborough, Carol Marsh and many supporting characters.  The screenplay by Graham Greene is fabulous and rich.  The only negative is the print shouled be better.  With the Brighten Rock accent and the low volume on the print (I had it turned up to 100 % a good art of the time) the movie requires careful listening.  But that care is rewarded.  Criterion or someone else should treat and reproduce it in better condition.  It is a masterpiece.",1494892800,,565,4.626262626262626
8045602,4,B0007808A2,"A classic, much better and truer to the book than the newer version (the newer version emphasizes violence, gore and ugliness).

8045605,5,B0007808A2,"It might be a commonplace critically to pronounce the first film version of Graham Greene's novel to be not as good as the source- text, but in this case we would be terribly wrong.

John Boulting's film offers a dystopian world of mid-twentieth century Brighton: ostensibly set during the Thirties but applying as much to the time when the film was released. The resort's streets teem with people desperately trying to have a good time in the sunshine, sitting in deck-chairs, eating in shabby restaurants, enjoying rides in the Chamber of Horrors or eating candy-floss. Brief romances wither and flourish; older citizens find solace in the pub. No one, it seems, can think about the future; everything must be lived in the present, otherwise they might succumb to desperation.

In this kind of environment it's hardly surprising that Pinkie (Richard Attenborough) and his gang should thrive. They can offer 'protection' from the chaos - at a price, of course - and should their victims be unable to pay up, they can be readily disposed of. This was the time of the spiv and his henchpersons, who walked unmolested through the streets, carefully concealing themselves from public view and striking when and where necessary.

Harry Waxman has produced some truly memorable visual metaphors for this world. He uses a tilted camera in which the characters' faces are reflected in the mirror; on at least two occasions he has people smashing china figures on the ground. The death of Pinkie's loyal associate Spicer (Wylie Watson) is truly shocking, especially when the gang-leader throws a suitcase of the old man's clothes from an upper level down to the lower level, to rest on the inanimate corpse. Human life is that cheap for the young man.

Yet the Boultings' version of the book also focuses on another level of meaning, as it tries to explore Pinkie's psychology in terms of his religion. He continually fingers his rosary beads, reminding us of his lapsed Catholicism; this represents a source of considerable guilt, but he conceals it beneath a veneer of bravado. Attenborough is quite masterful at this; his face remains impassive throughout, his eyes staring coldly at the camera or boring into his friends' expressions as if defying them to detect a chink of emotion underneath. He believes that the only means to survive in an amoral world is to be a 'hard man.'

In line with the censorship codes of the day, Pinkie is brought to bear in the end, as he loses his sang froid and commits suicide - a final betrayal of his Catholic faith. But the Boultings have not finished yet; in a supremely unexpected moment, they have Pinkie's common-law widow (Carol Marsh) playing a gramophone record of her husband disclosing her true feelings for him. The needle sticks, and we hear only one phrase repeated over and over, so much so that it becomes meaningless - a suitable metaphor for the world Pinkie inhabited.

Owing a lot to the pragmatic techniques of British documentary film=making, with lighting and shadow effects straight from German Expressionist movies of the previous decade, BRIGHTON ROCK is a true classic of the postwar British cinema, as arresting today as it ever was.",1473984000,5,3192,4.934823091247672
