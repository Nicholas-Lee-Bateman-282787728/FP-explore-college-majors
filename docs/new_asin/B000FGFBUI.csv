8122215,5,B000FGFBUI,Good movie and great acting. The beginning was a tad bit slow pacing for me but it's short and understandable. As soon as it picks up the story is great. David Hewlett and Robin Givens did their performances perfectly!,1459641600,,218,4.615384615384615
8122216,5,B000FGFBUI,"This movie will keep you guessing until the very end. Very scary when Dinah St. Clair (Robin Givens) is held hostage in her own home by a deranged man who escaped from a mental ward. Her father Eugene (Robert Guillaume) is worried and police want to kill him. However in the end he jumps off the penthouse balcony and dies.

Neither of the model has no idea of acting and probably Sunny Leone is the worst of the lot. Sunny is not that good looking to begin with then they glammed her up with so much makeup that you may seemed to think it's a fake person with some robotic features. I always wondered how she won the Pet of the year contest. It's needless to mention that it's impossibe to make quality production with couple of prostitutes, especially Sunny. Aria and Devon were glamorous as usual but if you like them buy different video not this ... .",1060214400,,669,4.4471544715447155
