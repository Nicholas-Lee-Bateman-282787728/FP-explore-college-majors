7901709,4,9687000171,For those Wayland Flowers fans out there this is one of the few examples of his amazing work.,1498348800,,93,4.222222222222222
7901710,4,9687000171,"We loved the Madame's Place show and can't understand why it isn't available on DVD.  This DVD has some sound quality issues - sometimes clear while at others not.  What talent though.  If it weren't for the sound, I would have said it was a 5.  Grateful to have anything with Wayland and Madame.",1471564800,,296,4.425925925925926
7901711,3,9687000171,"I just adore Madame, and for that I give her 3 stars.  Alas the video quality is, as has been written, not very good at all.  The DVD is missing the introduction of Madame and her finale, but they were not available, so it's a treat to get any Madame at all.

Waylan Flowers made Madame sing.  For anyone fortunate enough to have seen them perform live, it was an event that was unforgettable.  So, if you, like me, are willing to spend some money to get a little of that nostalgia back, as poorly recorded as it might be, this is for you.  If you are looking for something pristine, then keep waiting.  Perhaps, someday, some treasure chest will reveal itself to be full of Madame videos.  Just don't hold your breath.",1438732800,2,719,4.353383458646617

7901713,5,9687000171,"I give this DVD five stars simply because it is Madam and there is precious little you can find on her.  It's a cabaret performance and, as described, not of 'professional' quality.  I didn't and don't care.  It's Wayland and Madame and Crazy Mary - and if you haven't seen their show before it sure ain't Hollywood Squares.  The show is blue (very) and hilarious and if you like their humor you will love your purchase.  Thanks to those who found this gem and worked to give it the quality they could.",1361836800,7,502,4.413043478260869
7901714,5,9687000171,When we lost Wayland Flowers and his alter ego Madame...........we lost a vast amount of talent....we lost much humor.  Thank goodness Madame has been saved on DVD.  She is a true classic!!!!!,1353024000,9,192,4.96875
7901715,3,9687000171,"the book was cute, but no facts about how Wayland Flowers started out with her. Would have enjoyed more on that aspect.",1328400000,2,119,4.454545454545454
