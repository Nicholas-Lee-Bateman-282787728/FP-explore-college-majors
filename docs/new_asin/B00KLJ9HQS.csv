Plot: WWI field hospital, with primary focus on the nurses. What was splendid about this series is that it showed the ugly part of the war. The people who were shot for cowardess in the face of the enemy when they were clearly shell shocked, because before WWI no one had ever seen shell shock. It touches on many more things but to say more would be to give things away. It has always irritated me when WW time pieces gloss over the atrocities that were committed on the winning side. This one does not. It touches on both the war and many of the social issues of the time. I found the portrayal of both very accurate.

What some people may not like about it: The tempo is a little slow in the start. This doesn't bother me, but may bother other viewers. Because the show was cancelled there are a lot of loose ends left untied and a lot of unanswered questions. There is enough closure that you don't feel totally unsatisfied, but the lack of follow up is annoying. Clearly the writers were hoping for and anticipating more seasons. (Which I would love to see). As in any time piece drama there are some moments that don't feel entirely realistic. For example a nurse going down to the beach (where the hospital is very near) and finding no one there but herself. It seems a little far fetched. These moments are not numerous and do not effect the overall authenticity of the show. But they are there, and it might drive some of you mad. You know who you are.

I gave it five stars because I loved it. But I've tried to point out the faults that others may find.",1442275200,,1626,4.2727272727272725

It gives an honest representation of life in the war hospitals of Northern France during the First World War. While many depictions of war-time focus on the absolute patriotism of those involved, this series shows that lines do get blurred when individual, real people are involved. The impeccable production is what initially catches your attention, but then an outstanding cast brings the writing of Sarah Phelps to life. The dynamic relationships between the characters means that there is truly something for everyone to love in this show. In fact, I would argue that it has a lot in common with the massive hit show, Downton Abbey, as it explores many of the same themes though in a completely unique way. Where D.A. explores the realities of hierarchy in early 20th century British society, The Crimson Field does the same with the ranking within the army and hospital camps. Also present are complicated love stories, a discussion of homosexuality, loyalty and duty, one's honour, and so much more! Truly, this is one of the greatest television shows that I have seen of late. If you feel as I do, passionately about great TV, please head to ipetitions and sign to have the BBC recommission this show!",1437091200,7,1283,4.863013698630137
