5132768,5,B0085CVPVS,"The DVD's are perfect. Play very well in our DVD player. Hubby loves the show and was surprised to find the DVD's were for hour long episodes. So even though some were part of what he has already seen, he saw a more expanded version!",1398470400,2,233,4.2
5132769,5,B0085CVPVS,"Ice Pilots was dropped by the US TV network that broadcast the first season.  The second and third seasons were broadcast by another US TV network.  However those episodes were edited down to half an hour.
Season two DVD set has three DVDs with 13 hour long episodes.",1366416000,,267,4.541666666666667
5132770,5,B0085CVPVS,"I absolutely love Ice Pilots NWT.  It's amazing to see how creative solutions are found for problems unique to the climate.  Landing on frozen lakes, flying supples that were to be ferried, but ferry can't run.  Seeing places where groceries are flown in.  Watching the rookie pilots flying the planes for the first time.  Watching all the things go wrong that can go wrong with the airplanes and the weather when a load needs to go out right now but can't.  I recently received the third season and love it.  My review is actually for all three seasons.",1365465600,3,554,4.591836734693878
5132771,5,B0085CVPVS,"This is simply superb viewing for anyone who loves big, old aircraft. The planes are beautifully filmed: from other aircraft while in the air, from within the cockpits, and on the ground. The glorious scenery of the North West Territories provides a stunning backdrop for the piston-engined workhorses. There are many scenes you will want to replay time and time again, so stirring is the photography of the great, old planes.

The directors (three are credited) clearly understand what aviation buffs want to see and the camera lingers lovingly on the planes from every angle, particular attention given to the  rugged engines. You can't help but love these sixty year-old veterans: DC 3s, C 46s, and a DC 4. A comparative youngster, a turbine-powered Electra, also appears in some episodes.

Around the planes, each episode presents stories about the people of Buffalo Airways and how they interact act with each other as they cope with a variety of issues arising from the airline's operations. While initially I was impatient with this human interest content interrupting photography of the planes, I have come to enjoy this material too. The men and women seem at times to be unaware of the cameras and emotions flow freely in response to the pressures and problems that arise. You come to understand the characters and look forward to seeing them featured in the stories, be they the boss of the airline, his two sons in management roles, or the pilots, 'rampies', mechanics and cargo managers who work so hard in the harsh conditions. And you never have to wait too long before the camera takes you back to the aircraft.

This is stunning stuff.",1362096000,2,1652,4.910394265232975
5132772,5,B0085CVPVS,"Son in law is a pilot, so I have to buy all airplane movies for him.the show is very entertaining.",1355875200,,98,3.95
5132773,1,B0085CVPVS,Don't waste your time or money on this season.  They re-reused stories and footage from season one.  There is not enough new material to make it worth the time.  Also the constant reviewing of what just happened before the breaks (where the commercials would be) is mind numbing and boring.,1355529600,3,290,4.76
5132774,5,B0085CVPVS,Very enjoyable except for the maddening repititions where the commercials had been originally.  An excellent depiction of the problems and frustrations of the aviation business.,1350950400,,177,6.08
5132775,5,B0085CVPVS,"Season Two of Ice Pilots continues the exploits of Buffalo Airways. It is great viewing watching young pilots operate WW2 piston transports in blizzard conditions. I love watching these old warbirds in action, as well as the dramas of living in arctic conditions, as well as operating a small airline. Mikey is still Mikey, Joe is still Joe and all that comes with it. There is great flying, interesting characters, and plenty of adventure.

If you want entertainment, interesting adventures and like aviation, then Ice Pilots is for you.",1350432000,,538,5.044943820224719

5132777,3,B0085CVPVS,I love the show but the DVD does not have closed captions for those of us that are hearing impared or deaf. Nither does Season One for that matter. So keep this in mind when purchasing this DVD. Bummer in this day and age.......................................,1344470400,3,260,4.931818181818182

8525496,5,B0085CVPVS,First started this series with Prime and became very interested in the love of the pilots for the WWII planes and the difficulties faced in keeping them going.
