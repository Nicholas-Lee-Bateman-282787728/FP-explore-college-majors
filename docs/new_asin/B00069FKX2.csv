2179256,5,B00069FKX2,"This DVD set consists of two separate DVD performances: ""No One Gets Out of Here Alive"", and ""The Doors on Soundstage"".

""No One Gets Out of Here Alive"" was produced in the very early eighties and is largely a look back at the late Jim Morrison thru the eyes of John Densmore, Robby Kreiger and Ray Manzarek, as well as a few rock critcs, Danny Sugarman, first and foremost. I thoroughly enjoyed the video. One of the things about the Doors' music to me is that: it stands up well thru time. Songs like ""The End"", ""L.A. Woman"", ""Light My Fire"", and other Doors classics...are over FORTY years old ...and they STILL sound fresh and exciting. Much of the info gathered here about the Doors, generally, and Jim Morrison, in particular ... still sounds pertinent and provocative. I've seen almost every video about the Doors available on DVD. Don't be fooled. This is a GOOD One.

The other video is a compilation of 3 PBS Soundtage Performances given by the Doors, as well as an interview given by the Doors to a New York station after their 1969 Soundstage performance. These are excellent, tight performances. Even if you've seen parts of these performances elsewhere...this compilation of all their Soundstage performances gathered together is worth having.

An Excellent Addition to your Doors Video Library.

The Doors were a band WAY ahead of their time. They and their music still stand up well today.

P.S. On a small side note: my two discs had their labels reversed. Poor quality control out of thefactory I guess. But the videos WERE GOOD! A bargain.",1317168000,3,1558,4.7555555555555555
2179257,5,B00069FKX2,"The Soundstage is one of my favorite DVD of The Doors.
You get a lot of Jim close up and personal.
The interviews are good as well, However I am not sure who or why the Sugerman fellow is and why he is so predominantly featured in the interviews...
As for the tribute to Jim Morrison..... It is mostly the band talking about themselves & the songs with a little bit about Jim thrown in the mix.

I am overall very pleased & glad to have this to add to my collection.

(The DVD's are mislabeled on my set, The one that says Sound~stage is the No One Here Gets Out Alive & visa-versa)",1307232000,,582,4.0964912280701755

I am in awe of ""The Wordman, never a Birdman""!

2179259,5,B00069FKX2,"Let me preface my review by letting you know that I'm a ""Johnny come lately"" to the immense pleasure of knowing ""The Doors"".  I was there in the late 60s but did't have a clue.  Now, I'm trying to catch up, and am not nearly as sophisticated as some of you out there.
This video is most definitely worth watching.  The three completely different Doors performances are mezmerizing (as all of them are) and the commentaries by the three remaining Doors just gives you an insight/information about what was going on with the group - I loved seeing and hearing what the three Doors had to say. I watch this video over and over and am trying to learn all I can about this great/remarkable band.  There will never again be anything come close to touching them.  Their talents were beyond belief!

2179262,5,B00069FKX2,"With the recent passing of Danny Sugerman, my interest in the Doors legacy, music and performance history has reached an all time high and his interview footage contained here from 1981 is especially precious. Disc One is a treasure trove of performances from the band at 3 distinct phases of their career;

performing a terrifying, full-bore rendition of the end in 1967, with Morrison at the top of his powers, a longer performance from German TV in vivid black and white from 1968 (the laid back version of ""Back Door Man"" is my favorite segment)and the real capper, the legendary 1969 Public TV performance of ""The Soft Parade"" and the most extensive interview of Jim Morrison and The Doors ever captured on film. This band squeezed a lot of living and music into their six years together and the weariness shows with the passing of each year. Also included on ""No One Here..."" are full TV performances of ""Moonlight Drive"", ""Touch Me"" from the Smothers Brothers Hour (with Jim missing his vocal cue on the second verse and Robby Krieger sporting a black eye) and the classic appearance of the band on ""Ed Sullivan"" (Jim scaring the devil out of America with his screaming vocals, leering and dirty shirt cuffs)that forever changed censorship on TV.

all great footage from a great band and priceless for anyone wanting to see Jim Morrison as the ever-youthful, preening and troubled genius he was.",1109980800,29,1402,4.8375
2179263,2,B00069FKX2,"Here once again The Doors have decided to release repeat performances with a few new cookies in simple DVD sets that don't offer much except performances you probably already have with a new moment and interview here and there. If you have already bought these two DVDs seperately then there is no point in buying this package because it's the same stuff. Curious how this band, the greatest to emerge out of the U.S. in the 60's, releases such excellent CD packages with the highest quality but always give us DVDs that just plain suck. Organist Ray Manzarek likes to describe himself as a filmmaker, well, I would expect more from a supposed director. The first DVD, ""No One Here Gets Out Alive"" is a special from the 80's simply transferred to DVD with nothing else to offer. The documentary is all you get, and it's already VERY out of date considering it was first released in 1981. Deceased producer Paul Rothchild appears to speak about Jim Morrison and his influence on the Punk genre while Manzarek babbles and says ""Man"" at least once in every sentence. The concert footage is nothing you can't get in better releases. The ""Soundstage Performances"" DVD is a little better. It features a color performance of ""The End"" from a TV show in 1967 where Morrison looks shamanistic in black leather, collapsing on the floor and delivering a passionate performance. This is a great performance for Doors fans. The rest of the stuff is the same old broadcast from European TV that is available in ""The Doors Collection"" DVD. We get the complete PBS special performance, including a moody ""Backdoor Man,"" but the video quality is horrible and looks deteriorated, strange considering the same footage looks clean and crisp in ""The Doors Collection."" Other than the footage there are no special features to speak of. It seems the band wants to just release the same old tired clips over and over on DVD but it's a sad waste. The only noteworthy DVD they have released is their recent ""L.A. Woman Live"" concert which features their new lead singer Ian Astbury of The Cult. And even THAT has NO special features! Manzarek should stop smoking so much pot, clear his head and give the fans DVDs they deserve.",1104192000,37,2201,4.749347258485639
2179264,4,B00069FKX2,"The Doors were a great band -- I saw them live twice way back in '67 and '68 and I remember both shows for two things -- how great the music was and how stoned/pretentious Jim Morrisson was.  So it's great to hear Densmore and the other guys laughing about how they used to space out when Jim was free associating about the Lizard King, etc.  They obviously liked the guy but not as much as he liked himself.

The performances here are good -- but the interviews and commentary are what make this worth viewing.",1102118400,8,511,4.302083333333333
8040596,5,B00069FKX2,"I've been a fan for 50 years (since I was 14). This is one of the few decent compilations of The Doors videos. Soundstage Performances is by far the best of the two. The Toronto TV footage done in May of 1967 of a live performance of The End makes the two DVDs totally worthwhile. In the Toronto video Morrison is still young (23), thin, obviously stoned but, not drunk, and mesmerizing to watch. The Oedipal part is edited out. No One Here Gets Out Alive had nothing I hadn't seen or heard before, but a good viewing if you like The Doors. Overall a very good purchase for any Doors fan, young or old.",1497052800,,602,4.243478260869566

8040603,4,B00069FKX2,"A review of half this set.

In the hour-long Doors documentary NO ONE HERE GETS OUT ALIVE (1981), it's nice to see Densmore, Krieger and Manzarek still young. Ray chose to film his comment segments on a beach. Apropos, for he and Jim Morrison, ex-students who attended the same film class, hooked up after meeting on a Southern California beach and the self-conscious poet sang to Manzarek the lyrics of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moonlight-Drive/dp/B000MCIBAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moonlight Drive</a>.""

This moment is immortalized in Oliver Stone's 1991 biopic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-DOORS/dp/B003UN409Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE DOORS</a>, a film that often sensatioinalizes the group's history. One example is the infamous Ed Sullivan Show live performance. Stone's version has Morrison boldly lunging toward the camera and emphasizing the word ""higher"" in the song ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Light-My-Fire/dp/B000MCIBE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Light My Fire</a>."" As we see here, that never happened. Twice Jim slipped in the word that the Sullivan gang didn't want, as he stood in partial left profile with eyes closed.

So was or wasn't Jim Morrison an ""in your face"" confrontational sort? That night in New Haven (my home town) when he got maced by a cop backstage, Jim definitely was. Telling the Arena crowd what happened to him was cause for an arrest on grounds of inciting a riot. Morrison afterward tangentially immortalized the bust in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peace-Frog/dp/B000002I2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peace Frog</a>"" (""Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven..."").

The other incident of his public defiance wrecked the group's first national tour. In Miami, as Ray Manzarek describes it, Jim mocked his thrill-seeking fans, warned he was going to show ""it"" to them. Ray says the singer removed his shirt to cover his groin area, then playfully pulled the shirt away for brief flashes. ""Did you see it? Did you see it?"" he taunted. Manzarek insists his bandmate never exposed little Jim to the crowd. It was a group hallucination which made them see a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/crawling-kingsnake/dp/B000002I2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">crawling kingsnake</a>&nbsp;that wasn't there.

Whatever the truth, Jim was arrested again, tried and convicted of public exposure. This was the turning point for Morrison and the Doors. Bingeing on alcohol and drugs and constant partying after gigs wore Morrison out. His poor health was apparent on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-SOFT-PARADE/dp/B000002I2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE SOFT PARADE</a>-- you can hear it in his voice. By the time&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-A-WOMAN/dp/B000002I2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L.A. WOMAN</a>&nbsp;was recorded, Jim had ditched the tight leather pants, gained weight and grown a beard. It's suggested that he was trying to change his image. A move to Paris may have been more to escape time in a Florida jail than as a way to gain a lower profile, for even in the ""City of Lights"" Morrison was pursued by small crowds of fans.

Of course there's clips of performances here (both great and awful) and the segment of Coppola's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/APOCALYPSE-NOW/dp/B0045INOCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">APOCALYPSE NOW</a>&nbsp;(1978) that used ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-End/dp/B000MCIBE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The End</a>"" as musical backdrop. For this Doors fan, the hour's best moments are when Robbie, John and Ray speak, for they are Jim Morrison's friends, colaborators and biggest supporters. Expect no answers in this program to the mystery that was Jim. Just enjoy the ride.",1372032000,,4058,6.839458413926499
