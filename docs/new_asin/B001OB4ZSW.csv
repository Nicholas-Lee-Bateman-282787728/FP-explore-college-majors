3729388,5,B001OB4ZSW,great artist great set and great audio and great picture which in all makes show .it just made a even bigger fan,1347580800,,112,4.136363636363637
3729389,5,B001OB4ZSW,"Really Paul Rodgers has a privileged voice and it keeps as good as since times of Free and Bad Company, and includes songs from all his career and some blues songs.",1332633600,2,164,4.32258064516129
3729390,5,B001OB4ZSW,"Well, I've never heard his music before when I bought this, so, it was a GREAT surprise. I usually buy 10 or so DVDs of alternative rock concerts to get one pearl like this...

Let me entertain you with a quick story.
My wife IS NOT into alternative music as much as I am. With very few exceptions (Twilight Singers is one band that comes to mind), she thinks my records are awful and she has the (very annoying) habit of judging music by it's commercial success. I was playing this DVD some other day and she asked me: did this guy breakthrough?
I replied: of course not, look at the guy, his clothes, his songs... He is as alternative as it gets. Maybe he has some cult following, more in Europe than in US.
I was astonished when she said: it's a shame he's not that successful, because he's great!

In few words: cool alternative rock, played by a great singer with a great band.

And yes, I bought it in PAL format (but I bought it directly from amazon.co.uk), so, it does not play on all my DVD players.",1321401600,,1008,4.267015706806283
3729391,1,B001OB4ZSW,"I've just wasted my time ordering this for the second time, and for the second time NOT receiving the disc as described.  BOTH discs that I received were PAL, NOT NTSC, and were NOT PLAYABLE on my DVD players.  The music is incredible, as is the video (I've viewed it on my computer).  I just wish I could watch it on my TV.",1310515200,,324,4.111111111111111
3729392,5,B001OB4ZSW,"Willy DeVille, rest in peace, and thanks for what many more popular artists never do. Give us fans what we want. And in ""Live at Montreux 1994,"" Willy again is in peak form. For devout DeVille fans assuredly they have all three concert DVDs, from ""Montreux 1982"" to ""Montreux 1994"" to ""Live In The Lowlands (2005)"".  Three concerts spanning three distinct and magnificent times in Willy's life. All excellent, especially with the audio. (The '82 disc suffered slightly from some shaky camera work. Thanks Willy for your music. You will always be remembered and listened to.",1252800000,4,573,4.96875
3729393,5,B001OB4ZSW,"I just received my latest Mink Deville Dvd.  It was 12 years later at the same venue and the Man still had it.  It's amazing that he or the band were so underrated.  He dazes with one of his first tunes from 1976 ""Mixed up Shook up Girl"", with an acoustic intro and a beautiful rendition.  I was glad to see ""Angel Eyes"" made it live.  The record company should have put that out as a single in the 80's and Willy would have had a major Hit Record.  It is that good.  Spanish Stroll, Hey Joe, Stand by me all make it on here.  It is about 110 minutes long and the bonus I received was a 15 song Cd of the performance that I wasn't expecting.  I know the manufactuer has discontinued this DVD, but you can still get it here on Amazon.  a must for ""Mink"" fans.  Rest in Peace Willy, your music will live on.",1251417600,5,805,4.0

8330053,5,B001OB4ZSW,"Got this on a whim as a Christmas gift for my husband as a stocking stuffer.  He loves it and was impressed I found this without his input.  I usually just buy from his wish list because if I don't, I end up with something he already has.  Not this time plus it's a winner!",1361404800,,273,3.9272727272727272
