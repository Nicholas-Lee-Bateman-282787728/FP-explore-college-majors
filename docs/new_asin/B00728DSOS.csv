8508773,5,B00728DSOS,"""Everything Is Terrible!"" has created...something.

I don't know what to say about ""Doggiewoggiez! Poochiewoochiez!"" other than it's a brilliant reinterpretation of Alejandro Jodorowsky's film ""The Holy Mountain"" using footage of dogs sourced from who knows where. I was confused at first, because it was seeming to shape up as a canine version of Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"", but then Gary Busey showed up to deal with dog flatus and I realized I needed to rein in my imagination. This is one of the trippiest things I have ever seen, and the sheer scope of the dog footage is breathtaking, as is the dialogue, much of it sourced from the originals (""Have you ever looked at your paws...I mean, really looked at them?"") This is a viewing experience that I loved, but that can't be described, so I'll stop trying and say simply that if you want to see something different (really, really different), this is the movie for you.

The DVD doesn't end there though, oh, no. There are tons of extras, most of which I enjoyed (with exceptions made for a few of the religious videos and occasional themes that are truly distasteful; ""Hinyin For Men"" leads the way here: just really, really no). The ""2 Minute Movies"" are generally very funny: ""Infested"" and ""Vibrations"" are particularly good, but the unquestionably funniest is ""Red Baron"" which must be seen to be believed, though ""Cell Block Q"" is unpleasant and repetitive, while the evil clothes-optional female bodybuilder in ""Nemesis 4"" makes this sound like more fun than it actually is. The ""Best Of"" segments are definitely weird. The best are ""Dustin Diamond Teaches Chess"" (Screech teaches chess), the best ever concealed carry class with Lenny Magill (must be seen to be believed), the ultra-80's bad taste vanity project ""Thin Thighs"" (which concludes with a woman showing off her thighs on horseback in a bikini!), ""Telephone Manners"" (kids rap about good phone manners at the Telephone Museum of New Mexico), ""Torah Tots"" (which includes singing and a vacuum cleaner plot), ""Ritter Hates You"" (featuring John Ritter as a tough guy talking about recycling), and finally ""Mondo Bigfoot"", which would be the hands down best of the bunch without the gratuitous and just plain nasty adult bigfoot action scene. Ish. These are offset by the challenging ""Just Don't Do It"" (worst abstinence video ever in history), ""Psalty"" (unorthodox blue religious character and kids), ""Ricky Goes to Church"" (very disturbing ventriloquist puppet preacher), and finally the just plain unbearable ""Rapraprap"" which features, you guessed it, rap. Really bad rap, from Ernie as it turns out. Ernie can't touch the last of these features, though he does presage it: ""Street Style"" is a how-to Hip Hop video featuring dance lessons from an extremely white woman. Watch her say with a straight face: ""I took some of this from an African piece"" and ""Hip Hop is an attitude!"" This is horrible, but I admittedly couldn't look away. You'll see why they saved it for last.

As if your senses had not been stimulated (some might say assaulted) enough by this point, bringing up the rear are some choice ""Music Videos"" that I actually had to struggle to get through, particularly the white guy in dreadlocks who has composed a Rasta jam about Jonah and the whale. I thought that was bad until I saw ""Bike Safety Rap"": if you like musical dissonance and inability to successfully employ rhyme or meter, this is the video for you! Finally, there is the indescribably but unimaginably terrible ""Caveman Blues"" which features the refrain ""Yeah, yeah! There's a bear in my cave!"" Groan.

Although some of the DVD extras really tried my patience, the movie itself was just so great that I couldn't not give it five stars in the end. This will not be a viewing experience for everyone, and don't be afraid to watch the extras over a prolonged period of time. Everyone will have parts they like better than others (especially in the extras) but that's where individual taste comes in (I mean surely somebody loves ""The Chinese Guide to the Bedroom Arts""), and ""Doggiewoggiez! Poochiewoochiez!"" definitely has something for all tastes, and then some!",1445904000,,4166,4.964183381088826
