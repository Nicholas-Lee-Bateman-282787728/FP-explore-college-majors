Brings back many memories, especially the tunes from The Search for Animal Chin, the first skate video I saw as a kid! If you're thinking of buying it, pull the trigger, some good 80's tracks represented here that most people have never heard, all original! Great addition to any music collection!! Blues, rock, synth style music",1344124800,,390,4.835820895522388
8261558,4,B00168GWLQ,"It's amazing the memories this collection brings back. Me and my best bud, sitting on an old couch watching the Future Primitive VHS, over and over. It was impossible to watch those vids and not go skate afterwards. Ah the simple life of a 17 year old. Old t-shirts and Thrasher magazine.

If you're anywhere near 40, and spent time watching the old Bones Brigade vids, you'll enjoy this. Younger dudes, you might too.",1324425600,,418,4.648648648648648
8261559,5,B00168GWLQ,"I grew up watching the early Bones Brigade videos (Video Show, Future Primitive & The Search For Animal Chin) back in the 1980's and they're full of adrenaline charged music that's perfect for skating or anything else physical. The original music on this soundtrack encompasses all three films and is sure to put a charge into your ipod. My personal faves are The Rad Boys ""Future Primitive (Skateboard Blues II)"" & ""Calling All Cars"", Los Pukes ""One,Two,Three,Four"" & ""Condemned"" and the great instrumental work done for ""The Search For Animal Chin"" by the A and B Team on ripping tracks like ""Chin Ramp II,III, & IV"". that would give Joe Satriani notice. Also included are tunes by Johnny Rad and the Jordanaires like his classic ""Skate & Create"".Great soundtrack!",1243468800,3,766,4.945736434108527
