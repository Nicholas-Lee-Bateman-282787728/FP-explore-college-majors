8417196,3,B0046E4MW8,"Durango Kid Collection V is advertised by Amazon and the disc set case
as comprising 10 B-Westerns made over a period of time from 1946 to
1951.

The titles listed are:
""Landrush"" (1946)
""Two-fisted Stranger"" (1946)
""South of the Chisholm Trail"" (1947)
""West of Dodge City"" (1947)
""Riders of the Lone Star"" (1947)
""Trail to Laredo"" (1948)
""Challenge of the Range"" (1949)
""Bandits of El Dorado"" (1949)
""Trail of the Rustlers"" (1950)
""Cyclone Fury"" (1951)

In actual fact there are only 9 titles and the one not recorded is
""Trail to Laredo"" (1948) on disc 2. It is amazing that the one you
want most is always the one that is missing. Well, as the saying
goes - life is full of disappointments.

The series stars Charles Starrett as the Durango Kid and his usual
saddle partner Smiley Burnette who supplies the comic relief -
again and again and again. His silly antics are predictable and soon
become tedious, although I will admit that at times he can sing and
hold a tune. The series could do well with a little less clowning
around, a little less singing by Smiley and the harmony groups, a
little more serious action and story-telling.

In the B-Westerns, the cast all wear six-shooters and are trigger
happy. When they mount their horses to give chase, they all draw
their six-shooters and blazing away, they appear to hit nothing.
In the western classics like ""Shane"" and ""The Tin Star"", it is
the first shot that counts - then it is all over. Well, I guess
that this random shooting is all the fun of B-Westerns and this
disc set is certainly loaded with it.

My personal favourites are:
""Riders of the Lone Star""
""Trail of the Rustlers""

If you love the early B-Westerns, then this selection is for you.
If you don't, then give it a miss.

The average running time for each movie is approximately 65
minutes.",1350691200,3,1816,4.603715170278638
8417197,3,B0046E4MW8,"This review if from the Durango Kid Collection Volume V - 10 Westerns.

The ten Durango Kid films on two DVDs are kinda dark, so you'll have to adjust your TV screen. Probably there are no better sources anyway. At the time these films showed at the theatres and later on TV, nobody cared about saving a good copy for posterity.
If you're a B-Western afficionado, they will do. The service is fast, real fast. And for the price, I'd say it's a good buy. All in all I'm happy with this purchase.",1289520000,6,494,4.311827956989247
