But with the rise of Neo-Nazism disgused as ultra conservative, TParty, and right wing RethugliKKKanism this film no long seems to have a popular following on issues that are still important, but clearly passe now!",1423699200,,267,4.933333333333334

3521052,5,B000063KLB,"Just want to clarify here as I see nearly everyone who has reviewed this watched the Amazon Instant Video version.  I happened to purchase the DVD since i'm a bit of a Dudikoff fan.  I didn't realize until after I had ordered that Amazon lists the language as Castilian.  But it is in fact in English and doesn't even have a Castilian language option. So if your in the states and want to purchase this DVD rest assured it is in English.  This film did not get a NTSC release and probably won't so you will need a region free DVD player that plays PAL DVD's or you can just do what I did,pop it in your pc since there is no region restrictions then hook up to yer tv with hdmi cable to watch it. Hope this helps any Dudikoff completists",1449100800,,736,4.161971830985915
3521053,2,B000063KLB,Old and crappy. Cheese acting and lame story.,1435968000,,45,4.75
3521054,1,B000063KLB,It was like watching the 6 Million Dollar Man run in slow motion for 90 minutes.,1435449600,,80,4.0625
3521055,4,B000063KLB,"This had a good plot.  How it got to the end was as interesting as the end.  Most of the acting was pretty good.  The dialog was OK.  A couple of sex scenes put it out of the family category.  Quite a bit of violence all part of the plot.  The sex scenes were not necessary to the plot.  Some value in showing a little Indian culture.  I enjoyed the story and the presentation was mostly realistic.  The helpful deputy character was not developed enough to make his end actions believable at the time they happened.  The ""good guys"" were not so good but were honest and dependable.  The evil characters had no good to them.  Some of the other characters were more developed.  It was a fun action movie to watch.  Not great; but worth watching.  I would recommend it.",1434931200,,766,4.333333333333333
3521056,3,B000063KLB,Passable B movie.  Fun to watch,1428710400,,31,4.166666666666667
3521057,5,B000063KLB,"The Musketeers Forever was a fun video to watch.  I love to see Lee Majors, the others characters were great also.  Plenty of action, good spirits, fun to watch, had me guessing for a while  of how it would all work out for the god of the Musketeers.  Thank you",1428019200,,261,4.16

8290532,4,B000063KLB,"This is a fun movie. It's not perfect, but if you're a fan of old-school action films from the '80s and early '90s then you might enjoy this film. Dudikoff and Majors help carry the film with their charisma and there is a nice laid back vibe to the film at times. Give it a try!",1514332800,,278,3.982142857142857
8290533,4,B000063KLB,Nice movie. It didn't need the sex. It was nice seeing Lee Majors and Michael Dudikoff again.,1504483200,,93,4.529411764705882

8290536,3,B000063KLB,"Not the best action movie & not the best project Lee Majors was a ever a part of.
Mr. Dudikoff has done plenty of better action & fight scene's But so did ""The Fall Guy""
However, it is a okay movie & for the time it was made a bit controversial, casinos on Native lands. That was a big deal a one time.
This is clearly a project that could be updated",1491264000,,350,3.875
8290537,3,B000063KLB,Okay not enough action,1486598400,,22,4.75
8290538,2,B000063KLB,The acting was not very good and had a poor plot. Think it would have been better if there had been more action.,1484697600,,112,3.9130434782608696
8290539,1,B000063KLB,"Pathetic is too weak a description for this moronic, badly written, badly acted and ill-conceived movie. If you must watch it, do so while taking a nap, it will seem like less of a waste of time that way.",1482883200,2,204,4.256410256410256
