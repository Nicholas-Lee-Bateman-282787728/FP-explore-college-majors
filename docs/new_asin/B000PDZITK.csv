8231668,4,B000PDZITK,"Back in the 60's a show called: Bewitched was on the air. It started with an animated beautiful witch ridding her broomstick. Then she's a housewife, who get's kissed by her mortal husband and turns into a cat. You see it happen here..
That's because Enspelled is an updated Hentai version of: Bewitched.
The young witch, (even though she may be 150 yrs old), looks like a small chested teenager. Her husband doesn't mind.
Unless it's his 500 yr old Mother in law.
A purple haired hag who looks a little like Susan Sarandon.
She plots to get her daughter back to fulfill her kinky sexual needs.
It seems she hates mortal men and is mad that her daughter married one.
Intending to lure her daughter back.
She kidnaps her son in law as bait.
While she waits, the wicked Mother in law tries drain him of his Sexual Energies.
That Horny Hag is in for a Big surprise!",1405641600,,862,4.427672955974843
8231669,3,B000PDZITK,"This is an average hentai.  I didn't hate it, and I didn't love it.  It's basically a combination of the following hentai's:  Anyone You Can Do I Can Do Better, Magical Twilight; The Hex Files and the old classic T.V. sit-com Bewitched.
This one is odd and I'll explain why.  The witch's name is Anastasia and while I think the idea of a man and a witch living together is a cute idea, it should, for the most part, focus on the couple rather then easily forgettable supporting characters such as the horny widow next door and the witch's deranged and sexually deprived ""magic"" mother.  Apparently this woman is centuries old and maintains her youthful look through relations with her female slaves.  She drains their life force causing them to rapidly age until they die.  While she does have a lot of ""willing"" women, she also knows that her ""supply"" won't last forever.  She soon takes an interest in Ana's husband and while Ana's away, her mother plays!  Ana and her mother ""have it out"" in a magical way and Ana ends up winning temporally.  Ana and her mother kiss and make up, but her lustful mother is still ""hot for hubby!""

That about sums it up, folks!  I don't regret my purchase only because I didn't know anything about this hentai.  Sometimes Amazon has a tendency to leave out certain tidbits of information on their less popular items and that can lead to a crossroads for a lot of potential buyers.  Anyway, average hentai, nothing to write/type home about.",1309651200,3,1474,4.619230769230769
