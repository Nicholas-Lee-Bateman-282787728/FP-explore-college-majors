5183784,3,B008UZA8FY,"Harry Potter Ultimate Edition:  Year 7.

If you already own the Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 & 2 on Blu Ray, I will say that this is certainly not for you.  There's a couple of new features such as the case, the book, and cards that come along... but other than that, it's the same exact layout and DVD/Blu Ray that you have at home.  It's a waste of money, to say at the very least.

Now if you don't own it on Blu Ray already, or have the other Ultimate Editions Years 1-6, then this is a nice little bookend to your collection.  I was originally under the impression that ALL OF THEM would be director's cuts and I went out and bought all of the editions; The Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets are INDEED Extended and wonderful, but the others on the other hand are NOT.  Which is quite silly due to the fact that ABC family has at least released the first 4 films with additional scenes on television.  I can never truly understand why they do this, but in the end of things it boils down to half-@$$ed work and stealing more of your money.

All that aside, I purchased this at Target, and it is indeed only a Target Exclusive; they can probably be found here too, but it's limited, and you would be paying over $50 alone having that it's been targeted only for 1 store franchise and it's limit would appear to be far more rare that the others you can find.  So it's pricey, but not uncalled for due to it's rarity.  And it's pretty well put together, overall; a nice dust cover box, Blu Ray set is in a nice case that has a slight magnetic hold, and the artwork inside and out is truly wonderful.

But as I've said:  Don't bother getting this if you already own the Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 & 2.  If you don't own it and are looking into investing on some decent Harry Potter sets, I would recommend this one, along with the other Years 1-6.  Getting these is equivalent to the Wizard's Collection that recently came out, which isn't BAD, but has many flaws to count if you're a Harry Potter geek like me; at least with those you get a few more goodies!  I have all the rest of the Ultimate Editions, so it's a decent collection of have.

If you want to save your money and get the Harry Potter set we fans deserve, it's going to be awhile, so the choice is yours; get these or just the standard discs.  HELL, record them on tv if you can and at least you'll see the first 4 films with extended scenes.",1351728000,12,2403,4.198257080610022
5183785,1,B008UZA8FY,"Same here.  This double feature only contains special features, not the movies.  It is misleading at best, hope Warner Brothers clears this up.
UPDATE 11/30/2012:  called WB 1-800-553-6937 and they admitted the manufacturing error and mailed 2 new BDs with the movies and special features on them.  It does take 2-3 weeks to get the discs but there is no charge.  They were very apologetic.  Thanks WB for making it right.",1351468800,9,422,4.873239436619718
5183786,1,B008UZA8FY,"Fellow Harry Potter enthusiasts will appreciate how disappointing it is to watch when network television airs an ""edited for content"" version of one of the movies.  Sadly, this two-DVD set has been edited for content.  Expect to find yourself wondering what became of Wormtail.  Try to figure out why Grawp got left on the cutting room floor.  Scratch your head contemplating the missing scene of Fred and George chatting just before an explosion.  These are just a few of the omissions, none of which were noted in the product packaging or the online description.  Having placed this order in August and waiting over eight weeks for it to arrive, I'm equally disappointed in Warner Brothers and this website.",1351382400,32,709,4.966101694915254
5183787,1,B008UZA8FY,"This disc is mislabeled.  It only contains the special features content of the movies.  No movies at all! Purchased through major retailer that starts with ""w"".  Was told that I could only exchange for another defective product because I had opened it.  So ticked!",1351036800,4,264,4.931818181818182
5183788,5,B008UZA8FY,"There is bonus material only.  I bought this from a local retail outlet and found this contained special features and language settings.  No movies.

Looks like I'll have to get a refund.

*  *  *  *  *

Okay.  Now that I've received updated discs with functional movies, I must say that this is an impressive set.  It has the theatrical versions of both movies along with with special features.  The blu-ray transfer is everything we've come to expect in newer-released blu-ray movies.

As a result, I've changed my review to 5 stars.",1350604800,8,535,4.684782608695652
5183789,1,B008UZA8FY,"Those interested in this 2 disc set supposedly featuring both parts of The Deathly Hallows may want to wait until a problem I've encountered is resolved (or try buying elsewhere).  I ordered a copy from Amazon, received it and found that both discs have bonus material only on them---no feature film.  I checked the size of content on each disc and they are only 6gb and 8gb--so obviously no hidden feature anywhere on the disc.  I ordered a replacement from Amazon and noted it came from a different location but received the identical set of bonus materials...",1350432000,64,562,4.77319587628866
5183790,4,B008UZA8FY,"**Note: This is for the 6-disc Ultimate Edition release of year 7, NOT the 2-disc year 7 release. Amazon is mistakenly combining reviews of all year 7 versions***

We all know the movies, so i will just review this re-packaging.  And YES I do have this in-hand for reviewing, I got the early retail release.

The two big disappointments are 1) NO 3-D and 2) NO EXTENDED VERSIONS.  O.K., stretching the book into two movies means no extended versions, but there are DELETED SCENES that you can watch outside of the movies.

Even though both movies were filmed in 2-D, Part 2 was released to theaters in 3-D with all of the CGI effects produced in 3-D.  So I do consider it an official 3-D movie and a 3-D version should have been included, instead of the DVDs of the same movie.  The DVDs do not include the two ""Creating The World Of Harry Potter"" documentary discs, and that means those collecting this Ultimate series on DVD will lose out.

For those who bought the limited edition 4-disc sets of the individual releases of Part 1 & Part 2, you may find yourself with another dilemma.
The 4th disc Bonus Documentaries in Part 1 were ""Part 1: Behind The Magic"" and ""Harry Potter On The Road"" and they ARE INCLUDED HERE on the Creating the World Bonus Disc for Part 1 as well as a wealth of additional bonus material.
The 4th disc Bonus Documentary in Part 2 was ""When Harry Left Hogwarts"" and there is nothing by that name in this new set and I have not found it under any other name. At 44 minutes, this documentary would stand out, there is nothing running that long in this new set. This ""Fly-On-The-Wall"" type of documentary about the filming of Deathly Hollows captures the actors out of costume casually talking about their experience. Also interviewed are the carpenters & stage crew as well as the extras. You will find out just how tightly the props were watched over so that extras did not take home souvenirs. You will also experience the tension on set before the live explosions.

All Bonus Material from the previous 3-disc combo sets are included here, with the second Blu-ray disc bonus contents expanded. Some previous documentaries are presented in extended versions, while new documentaries have been added.

Since the big difference is in DISC #2 for each movie, here is the run-down of NEW material not on the old 3-disc sets:
PART 1
Part 1 Behind The Magic (previously on the 4-disc limited release)
On The Road (previously on the 4-disc limited release)
The Return of the Order
Seabor and Greyback
Dobby's Farewell
The Look of Bill Weasley
The Weasley's
The State of Evil
The New Guys

PART 2

Part 2 Behind The Magic
The Great Hall of Hogwarts
Ron and Hermoine's Kiss
That's A Wrap Harry Potter
Nevill's Battle Makeup

Sadly missing from the previous 4-disc special edition: ""When Harry Left Hogwarts""  44 minutes.

While the collectable book is nice, I found the color photos inside to be a bit grainy.

The packaging places two discs together, one overlapping the other. I decided to put the two DVDs underneath as I would not be watching them. I only have trouble getting to the bonus disc for Part 2.
**DVD Update**
It is not announced anywhere on the packaging, but the standard DVD for PART ONE (single disc) does include 5 deleted scenes as a bonus.
The standard DVD for PART TWO (single disc) contains 8 deleted scenes as a bonus.
There are also 7 minutes of commercials encouraging you to buy Harry Potter Ultimate Editions on Blu-ray, buy Harry Potter Video Games, visit Pottermore, and just buy Warner Brothers movies on Blu-ray for better picture quality.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
You will need to keep your 3-D copies if you have them, and at least the second limited edition 4-disc release of Part 2 as these contain material not in this set.
If you don't have these earlier deluxe sets, then you will have a total replacement.
Blu-ray fans will get hours of new documentaries. Sadly the DVD fans are left wanting to buy a Blu-ray player as Warner Home Video has not created DVD bonus discs.
Some of these new documentaries are only 6 minutes long, so it is questionable if it is worth spending more money if you have the Blu-ray combo sets.
I had a hard time giving this four stars, in some ways it is only a three star set.",1349827200,93,4887,4.632369942196532
5183791,5,B008UZA8FY,"It makes no sense at all.  But it's true.  Target is selling the Deathly Hallows Ultimate Edition now for $50.  How is this possible while Amazon.com and everyone else won't release it until sometime in November?  With sales tax, the Target price is $9 more than Amazon's price.  For me, paying the extra $9 was worth it to avoid the month long delay.  If waiting the extra month is not an issue for you, save your $9 and order from Amazon.com.  The product itself is exactly as expected with the usual photo book, 4 souvenir photo cards, 2 more installments in the ""Creating the World of"" series, and, of course the two movies in blu-ray and DVD.  The quality matches the prior Ultimate Editions.  Glad I was patient and now own the complete Ultimate Edition set.",1349654400,12,764,4.5588235294117645

5183856,4,B008UZA8FY,"Warner Bros. already released ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Parts 1 and 2,"" to high-definition Blu-ray in separate three-disc sets; now they've released both films in a single, six-disc box set, the ""Ultimate Edition,"" along with a bevy of additional materials.  It's perhaps still hard to justify an upgrade if you already own the BD issues, but if you don't already have them or even if you do, this new edition is so attractive, it's hard to resist.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1:
""These are dark times, there is no denying.  Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today.""  --Rufus Scrimgeour, Minister of Magic

Everything comes to an end.  In this case, slowly.  Very slowly.  Warner Bros. couldn't let one of the biggest franchises in movie history just end with a single film, so they divided the final book in the series, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" into two parts, releasing them in 2010 and 2011.  Whether this was a good idea or a bad one, viewers will have to determine for themselves.  Basically, you've got the slower, talkier section in ""Part 1"" and the more action-oriented section in ""Part 2.""  Personally, I find most of J.K. Rowling's works wordy, overwritten, so I could have done with a single movie reduction of the final chapter in the saga.  But I'm not a typical viewer or a typical ""Potter"" fan, so what do I know.  I just like the movies but don't particularly need to see any more in them than necessary.

Remember when the publishers changed the title of Rowling's first book in the series, ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" to ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" for American audiences because they weren't sure Americans would know what a Philosopher's Stone was?  OK, so what the heck are ""Deathly Hallows""?  To quote from Wikipedia, which puts it better than I could, ""The Deathly Hallows refer to three legendary magical objects (supposedly obtained from Death himself) mentioned in a fairy tale: the Elder Wand, which could defeat all others in battle, the Resurrection Stone, which could bring back the souls of the deceased, and the Cloak of Invisibility, which could hide the wearer from most forms of detection and shield them from many magic spells. Together the objects were said to make their owner a 'Master of Death.'""

Harry not only has the three Deathly Hallows to sort out, he determines to continue looking for the hidden horcruxes that can defeat Voldemort.  So, essentially, this final pair of episodes is a quest adventure, with Harry, Ron, and Hermione seeking or using all these objects.  It becomes a sort of fantasy video game where the heroes must find their way through a maze to obtain all the needed magical articles to win.  Fair enough; since Rowling freely borrows from just about every other fantasy writer in creation (leaning heavily toward Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" and Malory's ""Le Morte D'Arthur,"" with a dose of Orwell's ""1984"" thrown in), why not use a video-game format for the action.

But so far it sounds as though I'm just grousing.  Perhaps I am.  The fact is, I found much to like in ""The Deathly Hallows, Part 1,"" as well as much that almost put me to sleep.  Fortunately, the good outweighs the mediocre, so in the end this is an acceptable installment in the series.

David Yates, who directed ""The Order of the Phoenix"" and ""The Half-Blood Prince,"" also directed these final two chapters.  He does so in an honest, straightforward, unmannered style; if you liked his previous work, you'll like ""The Deathly Hallows.""  Most important to the story line, Yates and director of photography Eduardo Serra create a look and feel of loneliness in the film.  Sure, you'll find all the old, familiar characters here, from Hagrid to Snape to Bellatrix to the Malfoys, but they each show up only for a moment or two, practically cameos.  This first half of the final book is all about Harry, Hermione, and Ron, their adventure, and their ever-more-complicated personal relationships.

As he has with all the ""Potter"" films except ""The Order of the Phoenix,"" Steve Kloves wrote the screenplay, this time without quite as many constraints on what he could adapt from the book and what he had to leave out.  And composer Alexandre Desplat (""The Golden Compass,"" ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" ""The King's Speech"") did the music for a change, although you'd be hard pressed to remember much of the score.

An opening scene with the Death Eaters is rather grim.  An escape sequence with the Harry look-alikes is quite exhilarating.  And a sequence in the Ministry of Magic is appropriately suspenseful.  Then comes a lengthy chain of events in the woods and mountains that seems to go on forever.  There's a little something here for everyone.

When the Wife-O-Meter and I first saw this motion picture in a theater, a man and his young daughter were sitting next to us.  The daughter, who looked probably ten or under, appeared scared to death throughout the story.  Beware:  ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1"" is not a children's film.

Film rating, Part 1:  7/10

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2:
""He knows if we find them and destroy all the horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him.  I reckon he'll stop at nothing to make sure we don't find the rest.  There's more:  One of them is at Hogwarts.""
--Harry Potter

Everything ends, even the ""Potter"" series, with ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.""  Just don't tell that to Warner Bros.  Not too keen on seeing their most-lucrative franchise in history just stop with author J.K. Rowling's final book, they broke it into two parts, two movies.  It probably made ""Potter"" fans happy as well, as it ensured they wouldn't miss even a smidgeon of the book's detail, and it helped prolong the fun for one more picture.

""Part 2"" begins where ""Part 1"" left off, with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), Luna (Evanna Lynch), Ollivander (John Hurt), Griphook the Goblin (Warwick Davis), and several others at the beach.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione will continue looking for the horcruxes they need to defeat the evil Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), who has hidden bits of his soul in each of them, and the adventure will next take the heroes to Gringotts Bank and the vault of Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter).  Meanwhile, Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) has taken over as headmaster at Hogworts, and he has confined the students there inside its fortified walls.

Now, besides the various horcruxes, there are a few other magical objects involved in the story.  They are the three ""Deadly Hallows"":  the Elder Wand, the Cloak of Invisibility, and the Resurrection Stone.  Voldemort is trying to get his hands on these items because together they can make a person the ""master of death.""  Voldemort wants them in order to control the Wizarding world.  Then he plans to subdue our own Muggle world.  What's next?  No doubt, he wants to hook up with George Lucas and acquire a Death Star to conquer the galaxy and beyond.  Only Harry and his pals can stop him.

As Harry finds and destroys each horcrux one by one, Voldemort loses yet more of his power.  The problem is that wounded, Voldemort is more dangerous than ever.  Or maybe they just ticked him off so much it seems as though he's more powerful.  Who knows, except that he's really out to get Harry, whom he thinks is the only person to stand in his way of world (or galaxy or universe) domination.  He may be right.  Moreover, Harry comes to realize he must face Voldemort alone. So it all comes down to the final moments of the saga.

""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2"" boasts some of the best special effects, CGI, sets, and costumes of any film to come out in 2011 or any other year.  The film is truly a marvel to behold.  Everything from dragons to castles to hairstyles seems to look better in this last installment.  I especially liked the escape from Gringotts and the detail in the imagery.

More important, the characters have matured to the point that we care about them more than ever as real people.  Now young adults, the characters interact more rationally, more intelligently than before, the actors, too, maturing into their roles and developing their craft more effectively.  Understand, though, that in this concluding segment, you'll see little or no bickering among the main characters anymore.  They've developed beyond that stage and come to an understanding of their relationships.  Where in ""Part 1"" we saw the interpersonal relationships among the main characters evolving, we now find the primary relationship in ""Part 2"" is between Harry and Voldemort alone.

In any case, ""Part 2"" is no longer a children's narrative but a dark, sinister, psychological, physical, and very adult adventure.  In this regard, it makes for a more absorbing, more gripping, more entertaining drama than previous ""Potter"" films as we see that the consequence of all the action is no longer just fun and games but life and death.  And as in real life, expect the serious death of loved ones.

Just as recounted in the book, the majority of ""Part 2"" describes the final great battle, waged at Hogworts, between the forces of good and evil, where everyone we've met in the previous seven movies (everyone who is still alive and a few who aren't) shows up to wage war.  However, that final battle goes on for so long, well over an hour, that it kind of dilutes some of the energy of the tale, making the big finale almost anticlimactic to everything that had gone before.  Besides, it's kind of hard to tell where the final battle actually ends, and when it does it's well before the actual end of the movie.  Because it seems to end before we expect it to end, it creates a slightly disconcerting feeling.

Nevertheless, the movie's closing scenes are so stirring, and ultimately so touching, it's hard to resist their charms.  ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2"" makes a fitting conclusion to a series that most of the film-going public had followed for over a decade.

Film value, Part 2:  8/10

Video:
The Warners video engineers do an excellent job transferring both 2.40:1 ratio films to Blu-ray, using MPEG-4/AVC codecs and dual-layer BD50's.  The engineers don't appear to have fussed with it too much, leaving a thin veneer of natural print grain intact and eschewing much or any DNR or edge enhancement.  It's an extraordinarily dark film, even for this series, so don't expect to see many bright colors or revealing details.  Still, there is decent definition, about what I remember from seeing in a movie theater; good contrasts; and solid black levels that, nevertheless, admit a fair amount of particulars to show through.  When the picture is good, it is very, very good, and even in the shadows it looks fine.  There are soft spots, to be sure, but, overall, it looks excellent.

Audio:
For Blu-ray, Warners employ lossless DTS-HD Master 5.1 to reproduce the audio, where you'll hear some splendid surround sounds during the more action-packed sequences, as well as more-subtle, environmental noises throughout the film, things like leaves rustling, breezes whispering, thunder faintly rumbling, and voices making themselves known from all around the room.  Strong dynamics, a wide frequency range, and a clear, quiet midrange round out an impressively nuanced audio experience.

Extras:
For this six-disc Ultimate Edition of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" Parts 1 and 2, we get just about everything a person could want, and more.  Blu-ray disc one contains Part 1, along with slew of extras.  First, there's a ""Maximum Movie Mode,"" a picture-in-picture affair hosted by Jason Isaacs with Focus Point featurettes along the way.  Next, you can access the Focus Points separately, and there are six of them, totaling about nineteen minutes, their titles fairly self-explanatory:  ""The Last Days of Privet Drive,"" ""Hagrid's Motorbike,"" ""Magical Tents!,"" ""Death Eaters Attack Cafe,"" ""Creating Dobby and Kreacher,"" and ""The Return of Griphook.""  Also on disc one, you'll find a BD-Live feature for those viewers who have player access to the Internet.

On disc two, a DVD, we find a standard-definition edition of the movie.

On disc three, a Blu-ray, there is another array of extras, mostly featurettes.  The first is ""The Seven Harrys,"" a five-minute look at the sequence in which seven of the movie's characters must all appear as Harry.  Next is ""On the Green with Rupert, Tom, Oliver and James,"" thirteen minutes with Rupert Grint, Tom Felton, and Oliver and James Phelps on the golf course discussing their roles over the years; followed by ""Dan, Rupert and Emma's Running Competition,"" three minutes with the director discussing the team's competitive spirit.  Then, we have ""Godric's Hollow/The Harry and Nagini Battle,"" six minutes; ""The Frozen Lake,"" four minutes, more making-of material.

Also on disc three we get eight additional scenes for Part 1, totaling about eleven minutes; ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1: Behind the Soundtrack,"" four minutes on the film's music; a promotional trailer for ""The Wizarding World of Harry Potter,"" six minutes at the grand opening of the Universal Orlando, Florida, resort and amusement park; and a Sneak Peek at ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2""; and a ton of other stuff.

Blu-ray disc four contains Part 2 of the feature film and many more extras.  The primary bonus here is another feature-length Maximum Movie Mode, ""Blowing Up Hogwarts,"" hosted by Matthew Lewis (Neville Longbottom).  As always, it uses picture-in-picture, featurettes, film clips, and interviews to take one behind the scenes of the filmmaking.  Then, if you'd like to watch the ""Focus Points"" separately, there are twenty-six minutes of them:  ""Aberforth Dumbledore,"" ""Deathly Hallows Costume Changer,"" ""Harry Returns to Hogworts,"" ""The Hogworts Shield,"" ""The Room of Requirement Set,"" ""The Fiery Escape,"" ""Neville's Stand,"" and ""Molly Takes Down Bellatrix.""  The featurettes conclude with a ""Final Farewell from Cast and Crew,"" about three minutes.  Additionally, disc four contains another BD-Live connection.

Disc five contains a DVD copy of the movie in standard definition.

Disc six, a Blu-ray, contains even more bonus items related to Part 2.  First, there's ""A Conversation with J.K. Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe,"" fifty-three minutes.  Next, there's ""The Goblins of Gringotts,"" eleven minutes, followed by ""The Women of Harry Potter,"" twenty-two minutes.  After those items are eight deleted scenes totaling about six minutes; a ""Warner Bros. Studio Tour--London,"" about a minute and a half; and a ""Pottermore"" preview where J.K. Rowling takes a minute to introduce her new Web site; and again a ton of other stuff.

The Blu-ray discs of the movies also include twenty-eight and thirty scene selections; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

In addition to the six discs, the Ultimate Edition set contains ""Creating the World of Harry Potter:  Growing Up,"" a 50-page hardbound book of text and pictures from all eight films; a Year Seven lenticular (3-D) card; Nos. 13-16 in a series of character cards; and access to UltraViolet streaming and downloading of the two films.

The six discs fasten to the inside of a separate, foldout Digipak-type container, which fits snugly into a beautifully decorated hardbound box, further enclosed by a hard-cardboard slipcover.  It does make getting to the discs a bit of a chore if you use the whole shebang, taking the box out of the slipcover, opening it, extracting the inner packaging, opening it, and then removing the discs.  It's a box within a box within a box affair.  Fortunately, you don't have to keep the entire box on your shelf if you don't want to; the Digipak alone suffices nicely, even if it's not quite as handsome as the entire package.

Parting Thoughts:
Even though there is a certain sadness in good things coming to an end, with the magic of today's movie reproduction in the home, one can relive the ""Potter"" adventures any time one feels the urge.  Certainly, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" brings the Potter epic to a proper conclusion, preserving most of what author Rowling put into her final book.  Whether we needed to have the book divided into two parts to preserve every last detail is open to question, but we have what we have, and it's pretty darn good, which is not to say it's everything I wanted.  At almost five hours, the final two-film fling seems a little much, just as the book seemed inflated.  But who am I to complain.  If you don't like parts of the movie, use the forward button.  The parts that do work are as enjoyable as anything in the series.",1433548800,,16883,4.933404179950408

I converted from DVD (all 8 movies in separate cases) to these Double Features, meaning I now have all 8 movies in 4 smaller Blu-ray cases. I like saving the space, as well as the price. The picture and sound quality on mine are, in a word, outstanding (with a Sony Blu-ray player and a JBL sound bar). These are the theatrical versions of the movies and the Part 1 disk includes behind the soundtrack and additional scenes, while the Part 2 disk contains additional scenes. If you want more, and probably the ultimate, in additional features, then you might want to consider the much pricier Blu-ray/DVD Hogwarts collection (with 37 hours of specials).

After all was said and done, evaluating the entire journey, I was not as mesmerized as I was at each segment of the movies.

Dark in theme and in cinematography which i suppose is supposed to enhance the doom-ridden atmosphere of the storyline but can be annoying and a bit of an eyestrain. What really comes across though is Hermione and Ron  are oh so wrong, something that with hindsight the author herself admitted.

5183963,1,B008UZA8FY,"We upgraded from 720p to blu-ray and 1080p this Christmas and re-purchased the entire Harry Potter series on blu-ray for the occasion. We thought we were going to be wowed by HP in high def, but we were immediately disappointed in the extremely 'grainy' quality of the movies!!!

At first we thought the culprit was either the new player or the new television... after experimenting with the television display settings and trying other discs and a streaming high def movie, though, it was definitely the Harry Potter movies that were the problem. A quick Google search also turned up a lot of folks with the same complaint about the poor quality of the HP blu-ray discs (and for the record, we bought our set from Best Buy).

Long story short, don't waste your money 'upgrading' your Harry Potter library to blu-ray until the movies have been digitally remastered. Currently, they're no better than the standard DVD versions.",1419552000,,926,4.89171974522293

I can't help but feel that these movies are going to be worth a great deal, someday, and are real collectors items (besides being fun to watch!).  Every time I see them I am amazed at the incredible acting skills of these youngsters, who spent 10 years of their lives growing up in front of the whole world.  They are truly a phenomena!  The books and the movies have so much to recommend them to any age.  They are magical, they have good lessons in them about self confidence, love and friendship and, of course, the wonderful sets and special effects are not to be missed.  I had the first 5 movies and now my collection is complete.  This set includes the 2 full length movies and special features.

5184106,3,B008UZA8FY,"This is about the DVD's only; I have never read the books!
If you love Harry Potter and have seen the other films you'd likely give this 5 stars.  First you need to see part one of ""THE DEATHLY HALLOWS"" before you watch this.  As a stand alone (that is: ""THE DEATHLY HALLOWS"" parts I & II) These films are 'dark' and a bit depressing [much like Frodo going into Mordor and Mt. Doom].  Thus the reason I give 3 stars.  The good part of it being so dark is that it is not the normal Hollywood story and ending.  I say: ""Film Noir is- 'Nohting good will ever come from this.""  Maybe good triumphs but all will be scarred for life and will always have a black stain they carry with them.
  If the day comes that you are ready to watch the Harry Potter films You should watch all 8 films in a quick succession [say, one each night for 8 nights.  Most will be glad that they did.
  REVIEW:  ""THE DEATHLY HALLOWS- I & II"" are a dark tale which starts with 3 brothers cheating death at a place called the Deathly Hallows.  Death gives them 3 gifts- like a Djinn gives gifts.  When this part of the film come into play the Deathly Hallows, part, is as told like/as a fairy tale.  Then we jump to some future time.  We meet a disturbed guy- Tom Riddle.  Tom decides that he is best suited to rule the world- wizards, normal humans, and half breeds.  In his paranoia he puts bits of his essence into objects 'horcruxes'. Thus if he is killed there remains a link to the world, so that he can come back.
  We see Tom's (aka: Lord Voldemort)followers attempt to bring all of the horcruxes together.  This will allow him to achieve full form and power.  And to find the 3 peaces of the Deathly hallows, so that he may cheat death. As Tom's force gain power and size through terror they show their Progressive philosophy (We know about how to make a perfect society and world, you don't.  So, you shut up, sit back, and let us have our way.  All will be perfect and happy when we're done.)
  Their adversary's are ""The Order Of the Phoenix"" Which includes Harry Potter and friends.  Harry and friends decide that their action is to hunt and destroy horcruxes. As they are off searching, the battle between good and evil is going to take place at Hogwarts's.
  This DVD has my second favorite Harry Potter scene:  the Griffindor sword/dragon scene at Gringold's.
  The final battle takes place, many are lost, much is destroyed, and an outcome is achieved.
If you don't like or want to see Harry Potter Then don't watch.  If you'd like to see Harry Potter then Watch it in order [over a short period of time].  ""THE DEATHLY HALLOWS- I & II"", are dark and close to depressing.  Definitely no Hollywood story or ending here!  All of the series are top notch in: acting, directing, script, plot, story, ...
The order:
1- H. P. and the sorcerer's stone
2- The Chamber of Secrets
3- The Prisoner of Azkaban
4- The Goblet of Fire
5- The Order of the Phoenix  [scene 29 best scene in series]
6- The Half Blood Prince  [probably my favorite]
7 & 8- ""THE DEATHLY HALLOWS- I & II""",1391904000,,3054,4.311619718309859

I see it as another way of enjoying your movie (on a device) just like you would put your music on an MP3 player. That being said, the sudden change to UltraViolet ""digital copies"" for this final installment is positively maddening. Frankly, it's useless to me. Makes me regret investing in all the Ultimate Editions.

Also, the listed expiration date for the aforementioned useless ultraviolet copy is September 2014, not November

Not to mention I am thankful I have a blu ray player, otherwise I would be even more frustrated!

I have now bought these movies twice and no digital version to show for it. Warner Brothers has made a choice that is obviously inconvenient and frustrating to consumers. What a shame!",1386115200,3,1097,4.558375634517766

5184140,1,B008UZA8FY,"This 6 disc set is advertised (on the packaging) as being inclusive of BOTH dvd AND blu-ray versions of the films, as well as supplemental materials. Essentially it is Warner Bros.' lame excuse for addressing putting out the last of the Ultimate Editions. Instead of offering them on BOTH dvd and blu-rayl, they have included both movies in both formats, with the special features accessible and viewable ONLY on blu-ray.

It's kind of an exercise in false advertising, since the box containing all the discs says, ""...on blu-ray and dvd PLUS OVER 7 HOURS OF SPECIAL FEATURES."" Below that is a big banner breaking down the ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" special features. Nowhere in that bannered breakdown of the special features does it say that those features are on blu-ray discs ONLY. The only indication regarding the features being on Blu-ray is a small caption below a picture of the 2 supplemental discs.

Unlike all previous movies in the series, this Ultimate Edition is the only version of The Deathly Hallows (parts one and two) that is available. For those of us who are completists and who don't have blu-ray players it is annoying that in efforts to force those of us who don't feel the need to purchase a blu-ray player that Warner Bros. feels the need to at one and the same time gouge us on the price and then mislead us as to what is on the discs and not including the same features on both formats.

I already own Parts 1 & 2 on dvd. I was looking forward to completing my set of all Ultimate Editions by acquiring HP&TDH Ultimate Editions. I was excited when it looked as if Warner Bros had included BOTH films in the the latest version, along with the special features that were similar to the ones they had included on all previous films. However, apart from the cards and the book that is included  - oh, and the Ultra Violet version, which I don't care about - the dvd versions in this set are the same as the ones that I have already purchased. However, unlike all previous Ultimate Editions that include dvd-accessible special features, Warner Bros has chosen to include them as ONLY blu-ray accessible.

So, be warned. If you're looking to complete your Ultimate Edition with Year 7 on dvd, essentially all you'll be getting are the films themselves on dvd, along with the booklet and cards. All the watchable supplemental materials - in other words the extras that were available to watch on all previous Ultimate Editions - are now accessible ONLY if you have a blu-ray player. So much for having the Ultimate Editions of both parts one and two of HP&TDH on dvd...",1385424000,6,2601,4.645652173913043

I'm highly impressed with the level of detail and care taken in reviewing the contents of the discs and the packing and everything else.  I find those reviews very helpful given all the different versions available.  I'm not that technically savvy so I'm just going to review the movie and the few features I actually used.

I confess that I've never read the books; I've followed the movies and only then because of my nieces and later my wife.  I always thought they were well done but I have to say by these last two movies I was feeling a little Harry fatigue.  I actually didn't care for the final two films all that much when I saw them in the theaters.  We rented them once shortly after they came out on DVD but haven't seen them since.  My wife decided she wanted to watch them again starting with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Order-of-the-Phoenix/dp/B0012GE91W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a>&nbsp;so we went out and bought this two disc set and watched them over two nights.  I have to say I have a new found respect for them.  The thing that stands out is the quality of the story.  It is so original when compared to a movie like Transformers or GI Joe.  Actually it is original when compared to any pop movie.  These movies don't pander, you actually have to pay attention and follow along.  I love that you aren't spoon fed.  I remember when these movies came out there were several big epic type films with huge battles and frenetic action scenes.  I think this also contributed to my Harry fatigue.  With the seperation of time and space from these other movies, the final battle in the second film was well done and in the style of the entire series.  I was amazed that the entire last half of part 2 took place during the finale battle.  In a movie like Transformers (pick whichever of the 3 or 4 of them you like) the climax feels like three hours while only being about twenty minutes.  The opposite is true here.  The action supports the story, the story isn't just an excuse to blow stuff up.  The real heart of the story is the people.

As for extras, I didn't look at any of them, we may go back eventually.  I'm not even sure what is on the disc.  You can't beat the price paid for two Blu-Ray movies.

Watching these again kind of made me sad that the series was over and also that we'll have to wait who knows how long to have a great mature movie again.",1373500800,2,2564,4.60485651214128

5184175,5,B008UZA8FY,"Fair warning up front.  This will contain spoilers from throughout the series, so if you are one of the few who have not yet watched the movies or read the books proceed with caution.

This is essentially one long (approximately 5hr) movie.  The movie was split into two parts, which are both included in this set.  The set contains both movies on Blue Ray, on DVD, and then two creating the world of Harry Potter blu ray discs, which finishes the special features that have been included in the ultimate edition versions of the movies.  I know when Amazon was initially releasing this set they mixed up discs and were sending sets without the movies or multiple copies of the bonus discs.  It seems like that has been corrected, because I received all the correct discs in my set.

The movies themselves are very good.  They do cut and change some elements from the book.  There was however no massive change between the books and the movie that I can remember.  They do introduce a little sexual tension between Harry and Hermione in part I when they are stuck in the tent together, and even add a scene where they slow dance, but like the books noting happens.  I really like they way they resolved the Snape storyline and revealed him not to be a bad guy, and the real reason he took out his anger with Harry's father on Harry is because he loved Lilly Potter.  That played out pretty close to how it did in the book.  Unlike in the Half Blood Prince where they cut out a lot of scenes about what happened between Snape and James Potter when they were in school together, and changed the fact that Harry was stunned and covered with the invisibility cloak when Dumbledore died, there were no wholesale changes to the story.

The final climactic battle was pulled off very well.  While they could not spend a lot of time on the death scenes for all those who did die during the battle, I think the intended impact was felt.  I really liked the scene between Harry, Ron and Hermione before Harry went out to the woods to face Voldemort.  All the actors did a great job there.

Again there are no extended edition of the films.  The deleted scenes are just available on the bonus disc.  The extras are very good, and the documentaries and features are extensive.  The amount of bonus material are as long as the movies themselves, so if you like watching bonus content, then this is worth picking up.",1364515200,3,2401,4.486175115207374

I don't own this product yet because I don't own a Blu-ray player. (Why would I buy a product that I can't use?) I have the HP UEs 1-6, and I purposely never bought another copy of the HP7 part I or II because I knew I was going to buy the UE. Either way, I'm not going to buy a Blu-ray player (total waste of money--as a college student who's already splurging on HP UEs). But does anyone know if at least the extra features are on DVD? I know my friends HP UE Blu-ray has DVDs for the extra features for HP 1. I feel like that should be indicated somewhere in the description.
As a side note, the fact that it's not in 3-D is more a matter of relief for me. I was so worried that I wouldn't be able to get a 2-D copy. This movie didn't need to be in 3-D in the first place. It did not enhance my experience one bit, nor did it add any aesthetic value to the film. Seriously, DOWN WITH THE 3D MOVIES!!

3) Here's the biggest problem for Canadians..... The ultraviolet copies, ARE ONLY FOR PEOPLE IN THE USA! Even though it says that nowhere before you open the packaging. I collect the digital copies too and that was a real BUMMER.

I don't regret buying it because it does complete my collection but I am really disappointed. I feel that if people have stuck with this series for the entire decade, by the final DVD's we should be treated a lot nicer. We are a following, not a one time purchaser.

Though there weren't as many extras in this package, I was just grateful they decided to at least make an attempt at appeasing the fans.  Kind of disappointing that each film didn't merit it's own package as the others did.  I think Warner Brothers was more focused on creating their new super-duper collection with never-before-released footage.

Also Boycott BluRay for perpetrating their global mafia tactics.

I will never, ever buy BluRay... especially after this dirty ploy. Any corporation that would pull this on the final episode ultimate edition, does not deserve any Patronage.

5184230,4,B008UZA8FY,"I picked this up early at Target (thanks to the other reviewer who mentioned it was available there) -- a bit more expensive than Amazon, but the long and short of it is I was getting tired of waiting.

First, kudos to WB for including parts 1&2 in one set, and not making us buy another ginormous case for our shelves (although I guess it means one less set of collector cards and books, but I doubt anyone is buying the Ultimate Editions for those).  And kudos for not making this only available with the super deluxe, super expensive, re-released set of all the movies AGAIN, which was my fear for a long time.

This is just as feature-rich as the other Ultimates (minus extended versions of the films, but that is a subject already covered exhaustively in all the other sets' reviews).  I wasn't keeping track, but there are at least 2-3 extras lasting 40+ minutes, plus a bunch of approximately 4-minute featurettes.  Thankfully, they for the most part avoid being redundant (apart from Hermione and Ron's kiss, which if I never again hear how awkward and difficult it was for them, it will be too soon).  (However, is it too much to ask for a ""play all"" button?  It exists on the Deleted Scenes section so I know they've heard of it.  It gets extremely tiresome returning to the menu after every single 4-minute segment.  Also, no ""resume"" function on these discs, which is hard to believe in this day and age.)

The other reviewer Paul J. Mular is correct:  What is NOT included is the 47-minute doc ""When Harry Left Hogwarts"" that can be found in this ""Target exclusive"" set:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deathly-Hallows-Part-2-4-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-UltraViolet-Digital-Copy-Edition-with-Bonus-Disc/dp/B006678VWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (4-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo UltraViolet Digital Copy Edition with Bonus Disc)</a>.  This is fascinating maybe only for truly hardcore fans, and probably worth the used purchase price if you want to get a feeling for what it was like on the set of HP.  I swapped out one of my DVDs for the bonus disc in my Ultimate case, making it truly ""ultimate.""

They've again included on both movies a ""Maximum Movie Mode,"" where the film is interrupted with little pop-up featurettes, again miraculously somehow rarely repeating what is included in the other features.  For part 1 this adds another 20 minutes of extras.  For part 2, it's over 35 minutes, but don't get too excited--Most of this is ""Remember this character?  Let's go back to the other 6 films and look at what they did.""  Really boring and unnecessary I think for anyone who is a big enough fan to buy the Ultimate Editions.  In addition, there are even more ""Focus Points"" which have to be manually selected.  Hint: These are also included in their own section of extras if you don't want to keep one hand on the remote.

Also in Maximum Movie Mode, on part 2 they have inserted the deleted scenes back into the movie -- albeit surrounded by a big frame reading ""DELETED SCENE,"" and sometimes preceded by a brief featurette explaining the scene--but still apparently as close to an ""extended version"" we're going to get.

One last tiny quibble:  The sound mixing on the extras is horrible, and the ""background"" music almost completely drowns out the voices.  I also experienced this on my ""American Werewolf in London"" Blu-ray, and it's enormously irritating.  Don't they have fancy mixing boards to make sure this doesn't happen?

I'm glad I bought this, since I couldn't very well live with just the first six films.  I'm also glad to be off the HP movie buying train, because it hasn't always been a pleasant ride thanks to bottomless studio greed and double dips.  But I don't want to end on a down note.
