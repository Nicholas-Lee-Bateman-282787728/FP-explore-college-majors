I grew up bilingual in English and Mandarin, but I refused to speak it once we moved back to the US.  Nevertheless, I encouraged two of our three children to study Mandarin in high school and college.  Walker and Ping Ping will open a whole new world to children who grow up in the 21st century, and they will appreciate the importance of a global society and the value of understanding the interpersonal relationships that emerge from being able to speak another language.  ""Walker and Ping Ping"" make this transition accessible and enjoyable to all generations, and I believe that it will help transend social and political issues in a way that will make the world a better place.",1201910400,11,856,4.6490066225165565

3099484,4,B0012XS5SS,We live in Shanghai and were looking for a good way to help our children learn more Chinese (especially the 5 year old). I thought the video was well done and interesting. My kids enjoyed it. If the goal is to teach your child Chinese you need to be realistic about the amount of content on this video. This is a short video and I would say there are less than 20 words in the entire video. I had expected a lot more content. If they put 4 episodes on one DVD it would be a lot better.,1252540800,8,485,3.9591836734693877
3099485,5,B0012XS5SS,"I was concerned that my 3.5 yr old son, adopted from china, was beginning to reject chinese that I wanted him to learn. We have all sorts of ""learn chinese"" dvds, which he liked when he was younger, but lately has been rejecting chinese in favor of English.

Then I saw this dvd, which really was geared towards ""big kids"". And it is in english. I wasn't disappointed. Walter in the film has just moved to Hong Kong, and wants to learn Chinese. His enthusiasm for the language is infectious, and my son was soon repeating the chinese words as Walter learned them from his new friend Ping Ping, and exclaiming ""chinese! I know it!""

In this video, Walter befriends Ping Ping and her grandfather, who introduces them to magical travel to faroff destinations, this time the Great Wall. We learn all sorts of facts (where is Hong Kong, how long is the Great Wall, it goes from the Gobi Desert to BoHai Sea, what is a chop...)... who knew there were camels in China? Between the search for the three symbols they must collect before going home, the camel, the imposing Great Wall guards, the sand storm, we forget we are learning, and just go along for a fascinating adventure in another land.

My son loved it so much, he must have watched it 10 times in three days! And no more ""don't like chinese, mommy!"" There could be more chinese introduced, but when it is, it is practical, in context, and natural. Ie we learn ""wo hui shuo zhongwen"" ""I can speak chinese"" which is repeated several times to make friends and open doors. It doesn't have that feeling of learning a vocabulary list (red, green, blue, one, two, three, mom, dad, big brother, big sister...) that plagues a lot of chinese learning materials. Some words we learn: pengyou, mama, zou ba, bu yao. New words are shown on screen in both characters (exciting flaming characters that go out in a puff of smoke!) and pinyin with tones. The words are repeatedly used within the story so that we gain confidence along with Walker.

The animation is beautiful and top quality, the songs are catchy (you will walk around singing the theme song), the story interesting enough for a 3 year old, school age or adults. And there are so many tastes of chinese language, culture, geography, artifacts that just whet one's appetite for more.

Fortunately the next episode"" Walter and Ping Ping in the Chinese Market"" is available. We can hardly wait for more. In the meantime, they have a companion website with recipes, crafts and intros to the characters.",1251849600,5,2502,4.63882618510158

8248131,5,B0012XS5SS,"I'm really surprised at the negative review from Bobo. We have several videos and books on Mandarin and have some Chinese friends that have also helped us. The language in these videos is exactly right. It uses the correct tones and phrases, on par with the best resources we have. The animation, stories and music are just great! There is NOTHING wrong with these videos. Maybe ""Bobo"" is referring to the character Walker, specifically. He is an American that moved to China with his family and is learning the language. His Chinese is shakey, but it's supposed to be. That should be obvious to the viewer. These videos are a pleasure and teach correctly. I hope they make more!",1440892800,,679,4.714285714285714
8248132,3,B0012XS5SS,"It is fun to watch. My kid likes it a lot, even brought it to school and watch it with whole class as Chinese lesson. But the Chinese pronunciation in the DVD is not standard Chinese Mandarin. It's obvious that all of them have foreign accent. It's too often that their Shen1 Diao4 is wrong.",1400976000,,291,4.3090909090909095
8248133,5,B0012XS5SS,"While there may not be a ton a Chinese in these DVDs, it is presented in a very fun way. My kid frequently asks to watch ""ping-ping"". The production value is high and the songs are decent. They have the both pinyin and chinese characters on the screen and the phrases/words are repeated several times. I would definitely recommend this set as a supplement to other materials. The bottom line is that my toddler actually wants to watch it and that says it all.",1330819200,,459,4.476190476190476
8248134,1,B0012XS5SS,"Yeah, sorry, it may look nice on the outside looking in, but there are several major issues with this thing.
The ""cultural"" aspect is questionable, that's not China today and a lot of it isn't accurate even from a historical aspect. Never mind, good enough for most little kids.

It doesn't teach a lot of words in each episode, but the words they do teach? Well, there's problems. It's not spoken by native or fluent speakers because the pronounciation is all wrong. (How would you like it if your English teach has a thick Chinese accent?). Unlike most other languages, Chinese is tonal, so any inaccuracy in pronounciation sticks out like a sledgehammer whacking you in the gut.
On top of all that, another clue that they are not native speakers is the words & phrases they use, while technically is correct Chinese, which are often used incorrectly or almost comical in their usage. This may not be apparent to a non-native, but it is painfully obvious to native speaker.

Whoever put it together isn't doing a good job, probably just a quick money grab. Check the website, they state that Walker & Ping Ping are in Hong Kong. Guess what? The predominant dialect in Hong Kong is Cantonese, not Mandarin. And the predominant written form is Traditional, not Simplified. The show uses Mandarin with Simplified Chinese.

You may think it's not a big deal, but as an analogy I alluded to before, what do you think about someone teaching you ""American"" style English using Australian slang and a Chinese accent? Yes, you will learn English, but it will be ... odd.

If you think it's an entertaining show, by all means get it, but don't expect to learn anything well from these series.",1320451200,3,1684,4.717687074829932
8248135,5,B0012XS5SS,"I'm so pleased that I was told about Walker and Ping Ping.  Walker & Ping Ping make learning simplified Chinese interesting and entertaining without dumbing it down.  My six year old daughter actually enjoys watching these videos, unlike Mei Mei and Ni Hao Kai Lan, which have never kept her interest.  We both appreciate the Chinese cultural elements and she even asks for us to do activities based on the episodes.

A new episode is well overdue, which is my only complaint.

Thank you for increasing my daughter's interest in Chinese language and culture.  These episodes have even helped her pay more attention during her Chinese language lessons.",1315699200,,651,4.981481481481482
8248136,5,B0012XS5SS,"Again, a great teaching tool for younger children (6-3) with just the right amount of learning the Mandarin phrases, while older children with some Mandarin will still enjoy the storyline and learn the culture of China. Well done!",1315094400,,230,5.078947368421052
8248137,3,B0012XS5SS,"Pros: The pronunciation is clear
  The Dora-like story (adventure in threes) is cute
Cons: Songs are SOOO annoying **""Greaaaat Waaaaal of Chinaaaaaaa""
  Too short
  Not many words used
  Not enough pinyin

Kai-Lan has more to offer, I think.  But this changes it up a bit.  Try Muzzy if you're serious (and have the $$).",1308009600,,320,4.7407407407407405
8248138,5,B0012XS5SS,"Really good - informative and well done, learn some language and some culture

Only downside - no new ones in about two years.  Please make more!",1293580800,,145,4.538461538461538
8248139,5,B0012XS5SS,"He may be a little young to fully understand all that is happening in this DVD but my 1 1/2 year old is hooked!  The characters are fun, the story line is well conceived and educational, the music is enjoyable and it is all set in front of a beautiful Chinese backdrop.  Having grown up in Hong Kong, and having traveled in the area I found the DVD quite 'authentic'.  Highly recommended.",1263945600,,388,4.361111111111111
8248140,5,B0012XS5SS,"This is exactly the same as the two individual discs on 1 disc (chinese market and great wall).

It's a nice balance of chinese culture, pinyin, simplified chinese and mandarin.  The animation isn't bad, the voices are accurate yet understandable and the music is actually quite pleasant.  For educational reference, I'd say it's more useful than Kai Lan, but less informational than the River Dragon King.

Unfortunately, these seem to be the only in this series.",1255219200,4,464,5.065789473684211
