The story begins with two riders being pursued by six riders. The two riders split up, one is caught by the sheriff. Corrigan is jailed. At night Dusty appears outside his barred window. The other prisoner wants to go along, he promises them a safe hideout at the Whip's headquarters. Gray discusses leadership with Corrigan. Later they leave to rob a stagecoach. Corrigan has a new trick to rob a stagecoach. A magician was on the stage. Will a pigeon carry a message? Does a purple tongue show a disease? Curiosity can be worse than a disease? [Or blueberry pie?] Gray is warned by Brandon to keep an eye on the new boys. We learn about the motives of Ann and Steve. Dusty is well enough to get out of bed but not well enough to work. Ann has a secret! She meets men to tell them about Brandon's trip to the bank. Another pigeon visits the sheriff, it's a message from Alibi.

Gray will pass out his plan for the next raid. If a posse shows up he'll know there's a leak. Dusty and Corrigan talk to Ann. The sherif learns of the plans. Hammo entertains with his magic act. Then there is a big surprise! Can the sheriff's men get into Fugitive Valley? Can Dusty and Corrigan warn them? Can Gray's men ride to the pass first? There is shooting when the sheriff's posse arrives at the pass. But Dusty and Corrigan eliminate the guards so the tables are turned on Gray's gang. Ann and her men find the proof in the safe, but Gray's gang rides up. ""I wonder where them horses come from?"" Will Gray's gang be trapped when the law arrives? Can they catch Brandon in town? We learn the true identity of Ann. She and her friends wanted to get back the lands that were swindled from them. Will Dusty and Corrigan settle down? A pigeon brings a new message asking for help, the Range Busters will leave on a new mission. ""We'll be seeing you folks.""

This movie has more comedy than the other films. Was it a parody for Ann to head a bandit gang that tried to redress their grievance? The end justified the means? Two of the actors were formerly part of the ""Three Mesquiteers"".",1292889600,,2096,4.383033419023136
7931131,4,B0000558MO,"Monogram Pictures presents ""FUGITIVE VALLEY"" (30 July 1941) (61 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- With the success of Republic's Three Mesquiteers, several forces came together around 1940 to develop a new 'trigger trio' for the screen --- The star was Ray 'Crash' Corrigan, a producer named George W. Weeks and Monogram Pictures --- With a character of his own name. Ray starred in 20 of the 24 films in this series between 1940 and 1943 --- The Range Busters was clearly a lower budget copy of the Mesquiteers --- Big, muscular Ray 'Crash' Corrigan was the lead, the second lead was John 'Dusty' King, a big band singer (Ben Bernie Orchestra) with a reasonably good baritone, who would vocalize a tune or two in each film --- And comic relief was in the hands of ventriloquist Max 'Alibi' Terhune (and his wise-cracking dummy Elmer --- Monogram would distribute the Range Busters but not be directly involved in the productions --- The deal gave Corrigan a substantial share of the film profits (in an interview years later, Ray said he received 50%).

R. Finkel  - Director
Roy S. Luby  - Director
John Vlamos  - Director
George W. Weeks  - Producer

Our story line and plot, Our heroes Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan (Himself), Dusty (John King) and Alibi (Max Terhune) members of the Range Busters are infiltrating a notorious gang of criminals in an attempt to break it up and determine the identity of their elusive leader --- Lawmen are waiting on the outside to move in if the trio succeeds, but suspicions soon begin to mount. Meanwhile, the daughter of Fugitive Valley's doctor seems to be involved in her own secret activities. It's an interesting combination of circumstances --- This film features some musical numbers, including ""Riding Along,"" ""My Little Prairie Annie,"" and ""Chisholm Trail."" --- Watch for some of my favorite character actor villains Bob Kortman and Glenn Strange --- also appearing in this film is the best of the best B-Western actors Tom London, He played heavies and comical roles with equal skill and became, throughout the Thirties and Forties, a familiar face low-budget pictures --- London played the comic sidekick to Western star Sunset Carson in a number of B-Westerns and continued to play character roles until his death --- London is listed in the Guiness Book of World Records for having appeared in more films than any other actor (into the thousands).
