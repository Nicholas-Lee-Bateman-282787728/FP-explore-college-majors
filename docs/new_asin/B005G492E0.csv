4687350,4,B005G492E0,"The new adult generation pays homage to our parents and grandparents who weathered the Battle of Britain in 1940 in a fresh and exhilarating way without losing the sober, serious spirit of what they went through in beating back the murderous bullies of the Third Reich. Ewan's relationship with his brother is interesting, too.",1355875200,6,327,5.074074074074074
4687351,5,B005G492E0,"Just a great DVD movie & very happy to have it in my collection. Really , the biggest percentage of the other reviewers tell it better than I can. I have flown a Tiger/Moth & I could really associate with Colin on the next steps in his training & finally leading up to flying a Spitfire. The ""Oh Lord"" - Don't let me screw up syndrome was wreaking havoc on me just viewing Colin's check outs leading up to the Spitfire. From a Tiger/Moth with 130-45 HP to a Harvard of 600 HP to the MK9 Spitfire trainer of 1580 HP. Then talking to a couple of ""The Few"" over a pint in the pub. Just like talking to a couple of old friends or relatives relaxing on a Sunday afternoon - What a beautiful touch ! Also words from other pilots of this era with combat experience. Interviews with more than a few Battle of Britain pilots & historians. Lots of Spitfires, Hurricanes along with actual footage from the past & up to the present including an interview at a modern day radar station. A great piece of history with great narrating. This DVD has a lot to offer for anyone with a genuine interest in the Battle of Britain. If you're into Hollywood fiction & make believe, this DVD is NOT for you. Again & I repeat, if fantasies turn you on, this DVD is NOT for you ! This is actual fact & reality not a cartoon with special effects or the likes of a soap opera but ""REALITY"" !  DEFINITELY FIVE STARS !",1344988800,12,1388,4.198501872659176
4687352,5,B005G492E0,"Fascinating documentary on the Battle, seventy years on. Ewan is joined by his former RAF officer brother Colin to take a look at the planes, the pilots, the support network, and the history of the Battle of Britain. Having known quite a bit about that part of the war, there were still new things I picked up here. And it's always spectacular to watch Spitfires and Hurricanes in flight. Both of the brothers are enthusiastic about the subject and make for good guides, and the people they talk with are ideal experts with long memories of the times. Very worthwhile to see.",1338508800,8,575,4.647058823529412
4687353,5,B005G492E0,I REALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE A LOT. I AM INTO HISTORICAL AND MILITARY MOVIES VERY MUCH. HOW SO FEW CAN DO SO MUCH FOR SO MANY.,1334620800,7,123,3.769230769230769

4687355,5,B005G492E0,"All those of us, who spent their youth flying imaginary spitfires and hurricanes across school playing fields, arms out stretched; creating the howl of the Merlin engine will immediately love this feature. The genuine enthusiasm of the brothers, the interviews with the veteran pilots, such non assuming men, but genuine heroes to keep going up there despite overwhelming odds, the flying sequences and the recreation of the battle of Britain day attack make this a wonderful documentary to watch, learn and yes even resorting to blinking rapidly my eyes to hide one or two tears. A genuine tribute to the RAF pilots of an average age of 22 who sacrificed their lives that we may live in freedom. Brilliant.",1326153600,19,707,4.949579831932773
4687356,5,B005G492E0,"This DVD has something for everyone.  For the WWII history buff who is already familiar with the Battle, the interviews with the veterans (especially the two vets reminiscing with the McGregor brothers over pints of beer) and the cockpit shots of a Spitfire in flight are worth the cost of the product.  For a more casual viewer, this is a clear and interesting presentation of a pivotal moment in world history.

The McGregor brothers are obvious history buffs and their enthusiasm is infectious.  Their good-natured ribbing and evident love of each other adds to the production.  In order to show viewers the training of Spitfire pilots, Colin McGregor undergoes an abbreviated WWII training regimen, starting with Tiger Moth biplanes.  Later, to simulate what could happen to downed fighter pilots, Colin jumps into a frigid English Channel to demonstrate how quickly pilots could succumb to hypothermia.  These guys (Colin especially) really go the extra mile to make this interesting.

If you are trying to get a young person interested in history, this fast-paced documentary hosted by a movie star and his fighter-pilot brother is hard to beat.  I highly recommend it for everyone.",1325462400,23,1188,5.145833333333333
4687357,5,B005G492E0,"I have watched many documentarys and I am also a big military history fan. This movie is going to go down as one of the greatest every made. One of the best things about this movie is that the people making it realy care about the subject and genuinely want others to learn about what happened during the ""Battle of Britain"".",1321660800,46,325,4.344262295081967
4687358,5,B005G492E0,"The Battle of Britain - the only way this production could be better, is if it came with a flight in a Spitfire.",1320364800,28,112,3.9130434782608696
4687359,5,B005G492E0,"David Johnson, DVD Verdict --The Battle of Britain is absolutely fantastic, a gorgeously-produced, feature-length documentary that is rich with information and profoundly moving. Granted, I may be pre-disposed to misting up over stories of valor from the armed forces (our guys or our allies), but I defy you not to be affected by the recollections of the pilots or the culminating tour at the Battle of Britain memorial.

The McGregor brothers are fantastic guides, with Colin's expertise nicely supplementing Ewan's charisma. The relationship of the two brothers comes through and gives the production an added dose of sentimentality. The pay-off is the surprise Colin has in store for his younger brother: informing him that he'll get to ride in a Spitfire for a formation run. It was an impromptu offering, captured on film and Ewan's authentic reaction is priceless. Two guys with an abiding love for this history, and it shows.

The engagement is tracked chronologically, using real footage from the battles, clips of Churchill's speeches, breakdowns of the German and British tactics and interviews. The token historian fleshes out the story well but the real heartstring-pullers are the chats with the pilots, especially a conversation between two of the surviving ""few"" and the McGregors. They chat over a couple of pints and it's mesmerizing.

Look, if you have even a sliver of interest in the subject matter, I implore you with every fiber of my being to track this down. The Battle of Britain occupies the very upper echelon of World War II presentations and deserves to be viewed by as many people as possible.

""Never was so much owed by so many to so few."" A sober reminder in this age of whiny entitlement.

The DVD: clean 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer, 2.0 stereo, and no extras (which is the lone sore spot in an otherwise superlative release).

4687434,2,B005G492E0,"If you're British, you'll love this feature.  It's a BBC celebration of the Battle Of Britain enmasse.  The MacGregor boys dominate the video which is expected because their photos highlight the DVD cover.  Some of the aerial footage was taken from the 1960's full length film ""The Battle of Britain"".  The video was okay, but it didn't hold my interest.  I kept surfacing the Web on the laptop while it played.  The video documentary ""First Light"" (another BoB 70th anniversary BBC production) is much better.",1401148800,2,510,4.9411764705882355

4687453,5,B005G492E0,"This is a refreshing documentary about the Battle of Britain with a very interesting foray into the training fighter pilots underwent prior to entering combat.  It was refreshing to see Colin, a former RAF fighter pilot, subject himself to training as it was during the WWII with respect and some trepidation.  Ewan's genuine joy at the chance to fly in a Spitfire would make anyone smile.  I thought the final seen with the brothers at the memorial was particularly moving.",1366761600,,474,4.9

8471103,5,B005G492E0,"A fantastic and interesting documentary about the Battle of Britain.  Both Ewan McGregor and his brother, Colin, a former RAF fighter pilot and now a commercial pilot (as far as I understand) were excellent in their presentations.  The often touching interviews with men who piloted Hurricanes and Spitfires during the war, were memorable and fitting such a serious subject.  Yet, as serious as the subject of this documentary is, it is also a positive and complementary tribute to the pilots and military leaders, including Winston Churchill, who led Britain in the trying battles of 1940 when Hitler tried, but failed, to crush the British.  The old planes are a sight to see as they engage in dog fights (original footage from the war) as well as the restored and replicas that are proudly kept in mint condition.

The delight of the McGregor brothers as they pilot (Colin) and fly as a passenger (Ewan) is contagious;  both their smiles and their obvious respect for the men who flew these planes, are obvious.  The last words of this great video, werei given by a 97 year old who was one of the original pilots of the campaign to stop the Nazi invasion of Great Britain, a fitting ending to a documentary I will share with family and friends, and surely watch many more times.

The follow-up documentary, Bomber Boys, also with the McGregor brothers, is just as excellent.

Both documentaries are highly recommended for anyone interested in WWII history.",1490832000,,1459,4.874493927125506
