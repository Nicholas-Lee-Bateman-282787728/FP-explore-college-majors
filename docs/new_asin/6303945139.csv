While confronting Algy (Reginald Denny) on this delicate matter he gets a call form Inspector Col. Sir Reginald Nielson (Sir Guy Standing) who warns him to go home or leave the country immediately. ""But Inspector!"", ""Don't call me inspector!""

Sir Reginald explains that he is on vacation and every time Bulldog shows up there is a mystery with a beautiful woman in distress and a murder near by.

Naturally Bulldog shrugs him off, and sure enough runs into a beautiful woman (Phyllis Clavering) in distress and a near by body being bogged down. A friend of the inspector (Walter Kingsfordis) is staying and running her house. Try as he may Bulldog can not convince the inspector that his so called friend is up to no good. So now he must enlist Algy to help prove it.

Does he succeed or is it really all a mistake?

8311360,5,6303945139,"This is one of many films depicting Bulldog Drummond by various actors. This 67-minute black and white 1937 film has Ray Milland playing Captain Hugh Drummond, called Bulldog because he does not give up a chase. The series is based on a play Bulldog Drummond Again by McNeile and Fairlie. The film is somewhat granny and there are no captions, no ability to see writing on the bottom of the screen for people who are hard of hearing depicting what is being said.
Drummond and his partner Algy try to help a woman who is being held by two men and a woman and a gun carrying butler. Drummond's boss tells him not to get involved. The film is filled with humor, and the humor predominates over the action.",1501632000,,702,4.449612403100775

Drummond goes to see Miss Clavering, and learns more about her from Mr. Merrydew. He reads her note about being a prisoner. Colonel Neilson advises Hugh to ""go away"". There is entertaining conversation to carry the story forward. Hugh visits Greystone and looks around. Was Phyllis' brother Jack shot in a hunt, a murder passed off as an accident?

There are attacks and counter-attacks for drama and intrigue. Can a ruse create a target to collect a bullet? Or can something go wrong with Hugh's proof? There are some comic scenes and turn-abouts. Hugh and Algy go to Greystone to investigate. Can Hugh rescue Phyllis? Or will they be caught? Is there counterfeiting of War Bonds Series D going on? Will Phyllis asve Hugh from the villains?

This was adapted from a stage play. It is a low-budget drama with comedy. There were better dramas in that era. Note the dark backgrounds (film noir).",1289001600,,1316,4.591489361702128
8311364,3,6303945139,The picture quality of this VHS tape was very unsteady. It required some additional devices to steady the picture. but this was not a complete success. The sound track too was poor. It could be linked to the unsteady recording  I had a previous  copy with a dark print but a good sound track... so I matched to p\ir on my film edit programme. Several hours of uneeded work  I have a very good NTSC VHS player.,1275955200,,409,4.285714285714286
8311365,5,6303945139,"Bulldog Drummond films date all the way back to the silent era. While the two films with Ronald Colman are considered to be the best by many critics, the most fun and entertaining films are surely the ""B"" films with John Howard in the role of Hugh Drummond. But others had their turn at the famous adventurer, including a young Ray Milland.

Ray Milland has fun as Bulldog in this lighthearted entry. Pal Algy is an expecting father as Bulldog arrives by plane with a bit of derring-do, landing in a dangerous fog. Guy Standing is the Clolonel this time, and he's not pleased to see Hugh, knowing his arrival is sure to bring adventure.

It isn't long before his fears are realized, when our hero Bulldog finds a damsel in distress in the road. There's a murdered man nearby and the girl disappears! Hugh suspects she's being held against her will in Greystone Manor, but can't convince the Colonel. Pretty Heather Angel is enough to make any man take a risk or two, and Bulldog's nose for adventure and damsels leads him right into trouble.

Milland makes a fun and dashing Drummond in this entry in the series. This one is important because it shows how Bulldog and Phyllis first met. The very fun tone makes for fine entertainment for ""B"" fans. Bulldog plays a clever trick to tear Algy away from the delivery and an even neater trick involving a dummy to find the evidence he needs to save Phyllis from the ruffians. So grab the kids and some popcorn and have a good time watching this one.",1270166400,,1494,4.525925925925926
8311366,1,6303945139,"While the film may have been a good entry into the B movie world, the transfer by Alpha Video was not.
A large part of the credits are off the screen.  The transfer is dark, blurry at times, and generally not very enjoyable.
Fortunately, I have the Image Entertainment version as well and recommend it over the Alpha Video attempt.",1113264000,,331,4.516666666666667
8311367,3,6303945139,"Yes, they are both B grade films with low production values, but both show the real strength of Hollywood, when even their second string efforts have something. I doubt if Hollywood could put out a film with such effortless ease now. Ray Milland plays a somewhat daffy Bulldog Drummond, while John Howard is lot sterner. Both films rattle along with dastardly and bearded villans. I liked them both.",1052524800,,399,4.882352941176471
8311368,5,6303945139,"BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES was one of four movies made in this series in 1937. It starred Ray Milland as Drummond and Reginald Denny as his pal Algy Longworth. The plot centered on an attempt to rescue a captive female (Heather Angel) from a band of international criminals. The film received some good reviews at the time for a ""B"" production.
BULLDOG DRUMMOND COMES BACK was also issued in 1937. John Howard had the role of Drummond and John Barrymore appeared as Colonel Neilson. Much of the focus was on Barrymore who wore many disguises while he was helping Drummond.",1049155200,,570,4.767676767676767
