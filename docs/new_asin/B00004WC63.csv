In this episode we find out that Lotta loves April 1st and while she does Daisy Town dreads it because of her April Fools pranks and no one is left untouched. Luke is summoned to the tent of a visiting Russian Prince, and lets Lotta come along. The prince appoints Luke as his bodyguard and takes great interest in Lotta. Trouble starts when the prince and his fiancee (who is jealous of Lotta) fight. The prince declares he'll marry Lotta instead. The princess declares that she too will marry a ""commoner"" Lucky Luke!
I'm going to give away the ending - but I will tell you it is GOOD!
The picture quality of the DVD and the music is excellent.
Be careful, the DVD appears to have no regional code (as stated on the cover) - it plays fine on my non-regional DVD player but will not play on my older one.",1021075200,5,841,4.329113924050633
