7916218,4,B00002RAPM,"Light comedy and humor of the Playboy generation.  The story of several girls trying to get ahead in the entertainment business and their adventures along the way. The plot is light and entertaining with no real message other then trying to win the money and contract that the show has to offer.
I liked the movie because it required no thinking or trying to figure what was coming up next.  The girls were usual ""B"" movie types however I had seen most of them in other movies and this movie was closer to the start of their career so you do not have some of the bad body augmentation they have in more recent films which I liked.  In my opinion the movie was one could could watch on a night when you just wanted to relax and not think but just wanted a laugh or two.",1323302400,2,768,4.210884353741497
7916219,2,B00002RAPM,"Yikes, it had the makings of being a funny T n' A / cult type movie but near the end the cheesy ""games"" were just too cheesy. It almost was a cool commentary on cheesy movies but lost that vision, if ever it had that vision. All I could do was be my best in my part.  That and convince my movie girlfriend that we should make out (a lot!) before the cameras roll.  Since we were supposed to be dating for awhile, our first kiss should not be on camera.  I asked that our scene not involve nudity. There was plenty of that with the other performers anyway.  More fun making than watching.  But so is life!",1149465600,9,604,4.084745762711864

this is a fun movie so don't expect a great drama.",1122768000,,78,3.875
7916221,1,B00002RAPM,"The main reason why I bought the DVD is because I am a big fan of Barbara Moore. However, even this lovely lady could not rescue this film from being  an absolute disaster. Even though she is featured in most of the film her  role is not worth mentioning and she is completely overshadowed by Stevie  Jean. The rest of the cast as well as the plot is pathetic to say the  least. Don't waste your money on this one.",947203200,,414,4.1375
7916222,1,B00002RAPM,"So how come the star list doesn't go down do zero stars?  This film is pretty much beyond bad, you can tell that just from the title.  Basically what it is is a contest between a bunch of big busted ladies to see who  will win a role in a film, which is a shame, because the whole cast can't  act one bit.  There's even a band that plays throughout the film and  they're just as bad as the actors.  If you're watching this film with some  friends, then you'll get a lot of laughs, it's perfect for a bad movie  party.",946512000,,517,3.9901960784313726
7916223,1,B00002RAPM,"Never before has there been such a poorly acted movie, that it is more fun to watch while making fun of it than watching a good movie. The acting is so bad in this movie, one of the funniest scenes in it was where one of the  talentless, big-busted girls pretends to be accepting an Oscar. For anyone  who knows what Academy Award winning acting is, this is just about the  farthest thing possible from it. If you want a good laugh, (almost a bigger  laugh than most good comedies) watch this movie, but don't expect to have a  new favorite after viewing it. The only favorite category it can occupy is  ""favorite bad movie.""",945388800,,625,4.391304347826087
