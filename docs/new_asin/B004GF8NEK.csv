8428687,1,B004GF8NEK,"I feel absolutely swindled.  I couldn't endure more than ten minutes of this ""documentary,"" which uses nothing but third-generation, poor quality film clips from other television specials, originally aired by the History Channel, the Discovery Channel, and local news anniversary retrospectives.  Mazzucco supplies no original research or interviews.  While there are a limited number of RFK documentaries out there, ANY of them are preferable to this one.

I was going to buy Mazzucco's documentary on 9/11, but I would rather spend my money more wisely.",1434499200,,555,5.4941176470588236

8428690,5,B004GF8NEK,"Of all the documentaries I've seen on the RFK assassination, this one is probably the best because it compiles the most important footage in one place - from Ted Chirach's essential THE SECOND GUN from 1973 to more recent interviews and revelations.",1408147200,3,249,4.9523809523809526

8428692,5,B004GF8NEK,"Once again our government has fed us a bunch of ""bull"" who the supposed assassin was. Having been born and raised in L.A.,I remember the assassination,Sirhan did not fire the shot that killed Senator Kennedy. This well done documentary spells out clearly who fired the shot that killed the Senator. Why were C.I.A.subordinates at the Ambassador that night? Why did the L.A.P.D. destroy critical evidence and coerce key witness Sandra Serrano into changing her account of what she saw and heard? Jim Garrisons retort""if Bobby Kennedy wins the California Primary,he's a dead man"" will help explain the apprapro title! Check this d.v.d. out,it's well worth it.",1307491200,18,657,5.2075471698113205
