8186455,3,7115220174,"What a dissapointment...As a recent visitor to China where I visited the Summer Palace this dvd did not live up to my expectations for two reasons...It failed to cover all areas of the Summer Palace and I felt it did not give me value for money as the running time was only a little over 1/2 hour, an aspect the cover of the dvd failed to list. In general though for people who have not visited the Summer Palace would have quite enjoyed it and the dvd may have even encouraged them to see the real thing. This DVD was only one of the Great Palaces of The World series which included many European Palaces.",1277683200,,606,4.278260869565218
