8474653,1,B005IGVTKG,Not good.  Basically another home video of a wrestling school trying to put on a show.  No talent women who don't work out at all.  The 'wrestling' is nonexistant.  Really lame.,1345766400,4,177,4.612903225806452
8474654,4,B005IGVTKG,"instead of the usual T&A aspect of women's wrestling, we get some real intense actual wrestling. 10 matches the run close to 4 hours, plus radio interviews with the stars of WSU. Aside from the indy names on the DVD, there are current & former stars from WWE & Impact Wrestling. ODB, Awesome Kong, Pryme Tyme Amy Lee,Angel Orsini, and Jazz appear on the DVD. The bonus 67 minute Iron Women Match was a first ever and even went outside the venue and into the street. As a long time wrestling fan I was very impressed with this DVD.",1328313600,14,530,4.363636363636363
