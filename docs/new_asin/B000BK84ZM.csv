8087662,2,B000BK84ZM,"Kimba The White Lion is a classic anime series that has been released on DVD by several different companies. The ""Ultra Edition DVD set"" has the original Kimba; the others have later re-workings of the series. This DVD here is one of 4 Kimba DVDs released by Genius Products. It comes in a carboard envelope and contains 2 Kimba episodes: ""The Birth of Kimba"" (original title: Go, White Lion) and ""The Law of the Jungle"" (original title: Great Caesar's Ghost). These are the 1993 version of Kimba, not the original. The picture quality is really washed out; these DVDs were very poorly made. The only thing they have going for them is that both episodes have both an English soundtrack and and a Spanish soundtrack.",1132876800,8,715,4.728
