1398611,5,B000056NWZ,"Excuse me Mr. Charles Solomon??  Grotesque imagery, ethnic stereotyping?? What is your problem?? Where does it look like they're making fun of anyone? Everyone on that show is made up of different skin colors. Blue,green,purple,silver and lots of other shades of hair colors too!
  I am African-American and I don't see what the problem is with the show at all! Are you really watching this stuff before you write an ""editorial review"" about it?
  I just don't think you like ReBoot which is fine by me but you are supposed to write about thinks objectively and not be biased on insignificant details!! ReBoot is not racially stereotypical OK?
  There are more shows on TV now with more graphic displays of violence on all the time especially the news! The only thing Cartoon Network censored was a bar scene which was stupid anyway because all they were doing was hanging around together having a nice time. Please look more closely at the shows before you put your 2 cents in.
 I'm sure ABC and Disney feel like fools for letting go of such a wonderful thing now!! Hope to not see anymore comments from you anytime soon. Have a nice day!:)",1003536000,8,1141,4.67
1398612,5,B000056NWZ,"First off, let me say that the computer animation in this last season is *stunning*, far superior to the previous two seasons. Secondly, the third season is very much like a Japanese anime in the complex storytelling and direction. Thirdly, these are THE best 4 episodes of Reboot. Ever. While I don't want to spoil anything, these 4 bring the series to a definite conclusion and the last scene is like NOTHING seen before to end a series--A wonderful surprise. =)",990835200,3,464,4.7407407407407405
1398613,5,B000056NWZ,"Ok, this one is awesome. I've been watching Reboot since it came on way back when. As a 26 year old, I found this series somewhat primitive with it's CG in the beginning but amazingly beautiful in the end. I've got these last episodes on tape and without wanting to ruin the ending, all I can say is that it's a must see. You can trust me that it's something that has incredible replay value and you might want to even hook up you're DVD player to you're home stereo so you can get some audio grabs from it.",988761600,,507,4.1313131313131315
1398614,4,B000056NWZ,"I always loved the ReBoot series, and was extra jazzed when I found out that it was on DVD.  This one has the end of the series (dang shame), and I must say, it is the coolest way to end a show.  I can never get enough of ReBoot, and I am going to end up watching this on all the time!",986688000,2,285,3.5806451612903225
1398615,5,B000056NWZ,"Your only reading this because you've seen part of the reboot dvd's or a couple shows here or there.  This DVD collection is great for any fan of the show.  The graphics are a bit dated, and anybody who hasn't watched it might not become a fan, but it really was/is a good show.  A lot of the voices were in Beast Wars/Machines.
Of the 4 DVDs in the collection, this one had probably the 4 least engaging episodes, but it is the ending four and not bad...just not as good as the 2nd or 3rd DVD.  This DVD is esp. great for this little 3 minute thing, which I won't spoil.  You won't even know how great it was till the end of the credits...take my word for it.",986342400,,660,4.046153846153846
1398616,4,B000056NWZ,The wrap up os season 3 is at times a bit to tidy and the pacing is a bit staggered.  Some back points from earlier episodes seem to be ignored but I think mostly they were to be possibly carried on in a vapor season 4.  The recap song is priceless though and Hexdecimal rocks my face off.  The name of this disk is The Virual Wars no The Battle Comes Home (that is just the caption on the disk).  Good series and worth owning all.  Next I gotta buy Battle Planets.,986169600,,465,4.010869565217392
1398617,5,B000056NWZ,"In the final four episodes of season three, Bob is reunited with the restof the group as they return to mainframe. Upon their arival megabyte has a few surprizes waiting for them incuding a crash that could wipe out Mainframe. Bob and the others must rush to save Mainframe from Megabyte's Wrath. This DVD also contains the hilarious recap song. In my opinion this is the best part of the Reboot series.",982540800,3,403,4.611111111111111
1398618,5,B000056NWZ,"This video is comprised of 4 episodes: MEGAFRAME: The Saucy Mare and Crew return to Mainframe but find that it's not quite what they expected it to be....... (episode 13)
SHOWDOWN:  The rebels attack the viral principle office.  Hexidecimal has kidnapped Bob, therefore Matrix has to confront Megabyte. (episode 14)
SYSTEMS CRASH:  The inhabitants of Mainframe panic as the city crumbles. The team are reaquainted with some old ""friends"". (episode 15)
END PROG:  A game cube drops into Mainframe, or what is left of it.  Our heroes have to win, gambling that if the user loses, mainframe will be re-installed. Will Mainframe survive? Watch and see. (episode 16-finale) A thoroughly good video. Superb animation.:-)",982454400,3,714,5.228070175438597
1398619,5,B000056NWZ,"I'm more than a little amused by the Amazon review for this disk.  Apparently, Mr. Solomon has never watched any of the earlier seasons of ReBoot, and is therefore completely baffled by already introduced concepts of the show.  While this isn't surprising, it's ludicrous for him to be doing the reviews, at least without doing some research first.  Naturally, the third season of any series that includes arcing storylines is going to seem at least a little bit inexplicable to the begining viewer.

Literary critiques aside, volume four of the third season of ReBoot is perhaps the best set of episodes in the series.  It begins with ""Megaframe"", where the series finally returns to our home base of Mainframe, and ends with (what else?) ""End Prog"", resolving the main conflicts of the season 3 storyline.  A great many poignant and funny moments are packed into these four episodes, and the ending is one that still gives me chills every time I watch it.  This DVD may be discontinued, but do whatever it takes to see it!  Better yet, send letters to ADV, Anchor Bay, and/or MFE themselves asking for a complete box set of the first three seasons.  Currently, no distribution company owns the rights to the DVD distribution, so any company could buy them.  Let them know we'll buy them if they come!",1141862400,3,1302,4.772321428571429
1398620,5,B000056NWZ,"ReBoot is unsurpassed. Later CGI series fell far short of this original and groundbreaking series. Bill Gates inaugerated ReBoot into the Smithsonian as the first CGI series, but it was much more than that. Great writing and wonderful charcters meant you cared about Enzo, Dot, Bob and the fate of Mainframe. ReBoot combined the heroic and humorous in an unusual and unique way. It remains a marvelous achievement and repays repeated viewing. When Disney bought ABC, ReBoot was one of the casualties, so the third season never aired in the US. That gave its Canadian creators more leeway to push the envelope, since the series didn't have to comply with network standards and practices boundaries. This resulted in an edgier, widely-praised third season, which finally aired on Cartoon Network. Now the entire third season is available on four DVDs. Own this piece of history and be part of the magnificent achievement that is ReBoot. Ask a million fans: ReBoot Reigns!",1078963200,3,969,5.0625
1398621,5,B000056NWZ,"Season 3 is best by far with how much the characters grow.  I would very much like to see Seasons 1 and 2 get on DVD especially Season 2 which sets up Season 3 with the web creature entering Mainframe and their battle to save Mainframe from the evils of the web and treachery of the guardians. However, did everyone forget about Daemon?  Reboot Season 4 aired briefly, and I mean briefly, on Toonami a couple of years ago.  I missed the event but I assume it involved the battle to take back the super computer and save the guardians from Daemon. So Season 3 is not the series end.  I would love to see Season 4 so start pressuring the producers to put it on DVD ASAP!",1061942400,3,668,4.1953125
1398622,2,B000056NWZ,"As a fan of Reboot I was thrilled that I might see the entire collection. Although DVD's are sold as Volumes they only contain a few episodes.  Not near enough to enjoy the true richness of the series.  When I purchased ALL 4 volumes some even purported to be ""seasons"" I expected to get just that.  Not 4 selected epsiodes from each year.  I would have GLADLY paid more to actually get what I wanted...",1051142400,3,403,4.333333333333333

1398624,5,B000056NWZ,"This is a great DVD and a fantasic conclusion to the series, that is, until the fourth season. I would also like to say that the above writer of the Editorial is a appantly not a fan. Mouse is a hacker, she can do those kinds of thing to the ""red spheres"". Mouse used to work for Megabyte, but got him in the end, showing revenge. Just a thought.",1031961600,,346,4.028985507246377
1398625,5,B000056NWZ,"was, imho, as good as animation gets. All ReBoot fans must own this DVD, and the 3 which preceeded it. The Mainframe Strolling Players alone are worth the price of admission. Let's hope seasons 1, 2 and 4 are also released on DVD!",1023753600,,230,4.372093023255814
1398626,5,B000056NWZ,I purchased all four for my 9 year old and of course watched the series with him.  The last one (Vol. 4) is by far the best - not just for kids.  I'm 42 and keep asking him to watch it again and again - especially the last episode.  Worth it,1014076800,,241,3.6862745098039214
1398627,5,B000056NWZ,Now What Can I say that the amazon reveiwer didn't besides This is one of the best companies to do animation and that It's the best dvd I own. Lets See I cna't wait for beast wars on dvd and I am so glad that There are two reboot moives now.  If you think expostion is boring then you shouldn't be reveiwing things by the way.,1003795200,,326,3.9393939393939394
7932420,5,B000056NWZ,"The show was truly amazing.  The plot twists were shocking, it keep me on the edge of my seat... I can't stop watching season 4 of ReBoot.  It's really sad that they left the show at such a cliffhanger.  I laughed, I cried, I couldn't believe how much emotion I put into this show.  It's time for them to bring back ReBoot!",1367539200,,323,4.161290322580645

7932422,5,B000056NWZ,"Worth it just for the ""surprise"" ending of the last episode of Season 3. The production of the Season 3 DVDs are among the highest quality I have encountered. In my humble opinion, the boys & girls down at Mainframe Entertainment should have just let the series end here. The two ""Season 4"" movies are sub-par and unnecessary (again, IMHO).",1360022400,,340,4.683333333333334
7932423,3,B000056NWZ,"Good, but I would stick with Vol 1 or 2 unless your trying to collect the entire collection.",1244592000,,92,4.166666666666667
7932424,5,B000056NWZ,"I have been a fan of ReBoot ever since the beginning.  Being the first fully CGI TV series made it a big hit in my eyes.  My first ReBoot DVD purchase was Season 4, but when I saw the season 3 DVDs, I knew I had to have them.  I only hope that they'll release Seasons 1 and 2 someday.",1243987200,,284,3.7
7932425,5,B000056NWZ,"Pure and simple, this is the climax of the series.
Megabyte doesn't get destroyed by tentacles, he gets pulled into the web. The problem with editorial reviews is that the reviewer may not have seen the entire series. And compares the technology with that of today.... this series started in 1994! So, ignoring that obviously technology does get better as time passes, the ReBoot series is quite well put together. There is a lot of filler, but for the most part, all the crucial points from the previous seasons are all addressed in this final disc of season 3

A MUST SEE!!",1243468800,,575,4.637254901960785
7932426,5,B000056NWZ,"I'm going to add to this later.
But boy did the Amazon Reviewer get a wrong number.
in the contect of teh time of production Mainframe Entertainment was pushing the envelope.

""long strethces of filler"" He's reviewing the Twinkie he's getting a sugar rush from - and is paying more attentionto the twinkie.

Criticizing the voice of one of the characters ""sounds like George Sanders as Shere Kahn in Disney's The Jungle Book"" - I'm sorry if this film frightened you as a child - complain to Disney.

""while Bob struggles to save the cybercity, only to vanish inexplicably"" Been a while since I watched it - but since it was pivotal - Bob was ejected by Megabyte through the Web Creature Portal out of Mainframe. Turn off your earPod while watching a DVD you intend to review.

""Reboot inadvertently showcases the limits of the technology"" - in retrospect through our 2008 eyes [when I am writing this]. In 2 years I will feel I was too kind bury our reviewer under more of my trash. I will then use the latest slang-tech to crush his misconceived perceptions futher.

""The motion-capture technique gives the characters an unsettling weightless look, which robs their fights and gymnastics flips of any power."" Yeah I have to agree with that. Give me Drew Barrymore from the Charlies Angel movie, or Britney without underwear. [I wonder if I'll regret typing this in 2010]

""motion capture is still inferior to limited drawn animation""
AHA! the problem revealed - well I think a traditional photo with ""grains"" of 1/10,000 of a milligram is finer than a pixel - and guess what it is - why bother with HD - well a photo has more detail than most of us can preceive since our eyes are being destroyed by Laptop and LCD screens. He's a purist - it is what it is. I bet he likes B&W animation better than Color and Film better than Video.

""I yam what I yam"" Popeye [B&W Animated Film Sailor]

""grotesque imagery, and ethnic stereotypes are inappropriate for children under 10."" This is the wrong PC for a PC animated Sci-Fi Cartoon series.

Go back to writing instruction manuals for Wooden Ice Cream Spoons.",1210982400,,2104,4.634408602150538
7932427,1,B000056NWZ,Is it just me or do the DVDs seem a little more then just ridiculously expensive? I mean I payed 34$ for season 3 part 2 and I think that that was over priced for a used DVD with only four episodes on it but now I'm looking at some of the other DVDs and there going for like 175$ now I can maybe see that if it was a box set with all the seasons included but its only another four episode DVD. I just think these prices are criminal. there is no was in hell that a single DVD with four episodes on it is worth 175$,1196640000,3,514,3.7247706422018347
7932428,5,B000056NWZ,ReBoot was one of the best shows ever created.  I'm furious to find that amazon gave it such a poor review.  I am going to right to amazon and insist that they right a better review for this show.  It is by far one of the best story lines I've ever seen.,1194825600,,254,3.8461538461538463
7932429,2,B000056NWZ,"While I'm a great fan of reboot, my second favorite show growing up (transformers was my first), this is outrageous, to charge this sort of price for four or five episodes, and they didn't even release season 1 or 2, I would gladly pay the price there asking if it was the full season, but this isn't worth it.",1160179200,2,310,4.271186440677966
