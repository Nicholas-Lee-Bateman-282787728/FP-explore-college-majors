3443452,5,B0019SOR4W,"Years ago I attempted to read a card counting book but quickly put it down. The recnt movie ""21"" rekindled my curiousity and I decided to gamble on this DVD.  Wow, did I come up a winner.
No extraneous fluff or distracting flashy stuff, this vidoe slowly and clearly explained exactly how it is done.  It was all content and I got it. The presentation was very vivid, the charts immensely helpful, the audio was smooth and it was well paced.  Not only was it obvious that Sarge is a professional gambler who has been around but I bet he has teaching experience.
The chapters have a logical flow. Chapter three is the meat.  It exposes the mystery of card counting.  He slowly, with very clear visuals, explains how to keep a running count.  And instead of the dreaded division formula the running count is displayed onto a grapg divided into cold, warm and hot sections.  A light bulb moment! A very novel concept those charts.
This DVD will appeak to the intellectually curious who want to know what is behind door number three-how it is done.  Also, to those who aspire to give it a try this is a boot camp without the heavy math.  You will learn exactly how to extract money from a casino. Sarge used an expression that stuck with me, ""Become the David against the casino Goliaths"". IO haven't thrown a stone yet, but one is in my hand.",1211932800,10,1339,4.454918032786885

8275123,4,B0019SOR4W,Good information but dry.  It's in a power point type presentation and he sounds pretty mona-tone to me. It's not going to get an entertainment award but it some solid points.,1459382400,,175,4.645161290322581

8275125,5,B0019SOR4W,"I have studied different card counting systems, this is not the simplest one, yet this video tell you all the things you should know to become a pro-player, from money management to self-discipline, from the winning percentage rate to how many units you should bet - when table turning cold, warm to hot, this video provide all details I have been trying to get answers in mind, the most precious part especially from author's experiences and provide practical rules you can follow, which is no money can buy.
I simply loves this video, highly recommend it!",1404432000,,557,4.8125
8275126,4,B0019SOR4W,"I watched this movie, although not the best movie I have ever seen, it really helped my black jack game big time.  The only problem with the strategy taught on this video is the it is based off the idea that the deck only has 52 cards in the deck.  Yet at the casino the decks have 312 cards in the deck because they use 6 decks at a table.  Still fun and informative movie.",1379116800,,374,3.96
8275127,3,B0019SOR4W,"Daniel Dravot explains his simplified card counting technique using KO without the complicated math conversions.  The info is presented in a simple and logical breakdown of concepts not to overwhelm but to teach and instruct.

I thought that the presentation was okay.  It has good information although a bit awkward and slow at times - one chart was displayed upside down - go figure.  Q&A videos included.  Its not magic and you are still gambling, but definitely worth the money to understand blackjack basic concepts and an effective card counting technique - especially when you move from cold to warm to hot when an advantage is revealed in the game.",1292198400,2,656,4.927272727272728
8275128,5,B0019SOR4W,"I've used Hi-Lo for years. A friend told me to check out TCOB.  After watching this video, my new system is ""The Color of Blackjack"". Hard to believe it's more powerful because it's easier than Hi-Lo. The video is well organized. Chapters 3 and 4 contain the meat. Let me save you time, if you are serious about card counting, this is the way to go.",1271030400,,349,4.287878787878788
8275129,2,B0019SOR4W,"I found that with the different counting methods, it all depends on what works best for you. I didn't think concepts were explained well in this clip. Not sure if it is really going to make anyone that much better at the game. Up to you...",1260230400,,239,4.217391304347826
8275130,5,B0019SOR4W,"Admittedly I was hesitant to venture into card counting but they promised easy and it was.  The video moved along at a nice pace.  I had no trouble picking up the concept.  There was no distracting flashy visuals.  The author stayed with the content.

My girlfriend was impressed with my cerebral venture.  We watched it together one night and she jumped up and said ""I can do this"".  We practiced together and now we have been making a little money as a team.  You won't be disappointed with this video.",1212364800,5,504,4.522222222222222
8275131,5,B0019SOR4W,"Blackjack has been a hobby of mine for the past 10 years. I've read a lot of books, know a couple of different systems and made a little money over the years as a part timer. ""Revolutionary system"" did not mean much to me. I've seen that false promise all too often. But I was intrigued by the charts on the cover and the author's card counting experience, so I decided to put it in my library.

When he showed how the formulae could be laid out on a simple chart I kicked myself. Why didn't I think of that. I have read plenty of books and to my knowledge it has never been explained that way. This will lift the math nerd veil of mystery off of card counting. This system is very powerful in two respects: early entry and betting efficiency. It will bring home the bacon. If you want a quick and easy way to make money card counting this dvd will deliver.",1212192000,5,857,4.162650602409639
