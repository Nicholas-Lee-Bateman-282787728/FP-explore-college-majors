8254565,5,B001450EDI,"Dumbfounding history of how low mankind has sunk in dealing out overly severe punishment over the millenniums.  This well-documented presentation included the instruments of torture used during the Catholic Inquisition to force confessions of ""heresy"" (sometimes just daring to read the Bible, or more especially, daring to hold what it says as having higher authority than the teachings of priests).  Such barbaric mechanisms still exist and fill huge castle basements, which are now preserved as historical museums.  A surprisingly large portion of this film was about that subject alone, and although it was painfully eye-opening I figured I should know the truth about it and so made myself watch the whole thing.  Whew!  Don't watch this one until you're ready for it!",1505347200,,773,5.30327868852459
