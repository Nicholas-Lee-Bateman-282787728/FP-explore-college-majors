2122671,5,B0002V7TYM,"I have been waiting for this movie to come out for months.  I have only seen the preview for it, but was so intrigued by the plot.  I wrote to the producer of the movie and he informed me of when the DVD would be released and I am so happy to see amazon will be selling it!  I have no doubt that it will become a cult favorite.

From Filmmaker Magazine, a short synopsis: ""In the vein of Silkwood or Rosemary's Baby, Corn is about a young woman (Jena Malone) who seeks refuge on her father's sheep ranch after an affair with the politician she works for leaves her pregnant. When the sheep turn preternaturally aggressive after munching weeds produced by a neighbor's biogenetically altered corn crop, she embarks on an investigation that also exposes uncomfortable truths in her own family. ""It's a dark, gothic kind of story that crosses a lot of territory,"" ... ""I wanted to meditate on biology and our ability to control it in the context of an experiment that goes badly wrong. It's in a storytelling tradition that goes back to Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley.""

The 35mm Corn was shot in New Jersey, Yonkers, downtown Manhattan and at Columbia University over 25 days this July and August.",1097020800,9,1197,4.5488372093023255
8032498,3,B0002V7TYM,"This movie was honestly good for the most part, if you like Jena Malone you'll definitely like it. I contemplated pay $9.99 for it but I don't regret doing so. The ending was the only downer, it was weak so I have to give it three stars. Some side plots were unnecessary as well, but as a whole, I enjoyed it very much. Like I said before if you like Jena Malone, give it a shot.",1389052800,,379,4.0
8032499,5,B0002V7TYM,We've always loved Modern Marvels.  They cover nearly every subject and the shows are packed full of information.  This is a good family show that everyone can learn something from.,1382572800,2,181,5.0
8032500,3,B0002V7TYM,"The state of Illinois is billions of dollars in debt.  Whenever I hear that we have ways of bringing in money, I get excited.  This work said 10 states make most of the corn in this country.  It turns out that Iowa is state #1, but Illinois is way up there.  That's good: we need the money.

Having said the aforementioned, I appreciate that the program mentions the bad side of corn.  There's no way to feed the starving of the world and supply corn for gas.  Corn wouldn't exist if it weren't for man's attention to it.  A former classmate once told me that corn has little nutrition and that Natives of this hemisphere had lower life expectancies once they started eating corn.  This program says little about biodiversity, but the fact that most corn is yellow and all the purple and brown stuff is almost gone doesn't come up here.

On ""The Simpsons,"" they once laughed at how modern humans would be deprived if we didn't have zinc.  Here, the programs says humans eat sweet corn, but it lists the many ways that animals can eat the nastier kinds.  Also, corn goes into oils, pie crusts, and all kinds of other stuffs that one wouldn't likely guess.  All MM episodes focus a lot on how machine produce a product.  Here, they follow suit about how machine can pick ears and get rid of bad pieces.

They never mention natural selection here.  However, I thought about Thai fighting fish when watching this.  Without human intervention, that fish is very plain-looking.  It's human selective breeding that turns into this beautiful fish with flowing, pretty fins.  This work speaks about places in the US where companies are trying to grow selected corn year-round in places that barely change weather degrees.  If I remember correctly, the work says some plain-old gas must be used to create ethanol, corn-based grass.

For little kids, yes, popcorn and its production does come up.",1372291200,,1885,4.685975609756097
8032501,3,B0002V7TYM,"I didn't know Jena Malone (main character and producer!) was into defence of the environment and anti genetic food. Good to see her taking positions. Like in most of her movies, she's pregnant, which makes one wonder why she's so willing to take the same kinda roles over and over - but she acts well enough, i'll give her that. As a whole, an average movie, but i wasn't bored one minute though.",1127865600,,396,4.438356164383562
8032502,1,B0002V7TYM,"Pointless is the one word that best describes this movie. The acting is decent, but just barely. Maybe they could have done better with a better script. Who knows? The premise is decent, but it goes nowhere. There are countless meaningless subplots in this storyline which have no bearing on the outcome of the movie.

To be blunt, there IS no outcome to this movie. The movie seems to exist solely for the sake of using up an hour and 37 minutes of film. There is one painfully long and awkward 30-45 second scene that involves a mailman delivering a letter and getting a scientist to sign for it. What's the point? Surely there must be one. You keep thinking they must be going somewhere with all of these painfully long and awkwardly paced scenes, so you keep watching. After all, you have invested an hour or so watching scene after scene of this, so you figure surely something is going to happen. Nope.

I wish I could think of a better way to describe how boring and pointless this movie is, but just like it's plot, there's no point.",1125705600,3,1041,4.473684210526316
8032503,1,B0002V7TYM,"A.N. Roman: The neighbor had a miscarraige the day after the sheep attacks. She had been eating lamb meat of the toxic animals. At least that's what we got from it.

Was this movie boring? Yes. Was the script terrible? Certainly. Will I purchase it? Of course not. A friend and I rented this ... thing... to watch tonight, hoping there would be something to make fun of. This movie gave us NOTHING. My mother declared her disinterest within the first 20 minutes of Jena Malone rambling on about the violent sheep. Great bursts of dialogue consisting of the words ""sheep"", ""weed"", and ""corn"" on a loop appeared every so often, mixed with meaningless obscure fantasy sequences, apparently depicted as Jena's hallucinations. I can understand the point behind this idiocy, however scientists do not talk like high school dropouts and a criminal trial will not begin and complete within 8 weeks. We went into convulsions every time the farmer would yell about the sheep going for the ""grass"" and the ""weed"". We had more fun with THE GRUDGE. Rent that if you want something to laugh at. Rend CORN if you suffer from insomnia.",1119571200,,1119,4.768041237113402
8032504,3,B0002V7TYM,"I have to say CORN is one of the most unusual movies I've seen in a while.  It's premise is original considering most of what is coming out these days; unfortunately, the originality doesn't always make a great movie.  I'm not sure what screenwriter/director Dave Silver was hoping to accomplish, other than giving his little boy Luke a small but pivotal role.  It's obvious he's trying to make a social comment on genetic engineering and corporate coverups; but also we have a young 18 year girl who is carrying the child of a man old enough to be her grandfather; she's also the victim of potential child abuse from her father when she was young; and she's having trouble keeping her job due to her pregnancy and the fact that she becomes a social megaphone for what's going on with the sheep on her father's ranch.  But Silver doesn't truly focus on the corn issue as much as the girl's attempts to have a child, be a friend to Rachel, and understand her father.  Jena Malone (Saved, Cold Mountain) gives a commendable if somewhat overwrought performance; Don Harvey as her father wasn't a strong enough actor to bring all the dimensions out; the rest of the cast is merely adequate.  CORN is not a horror movie, so don't let the cover fool you; this is not a supernatural movie, just another one of those man vs. nature flicks.  If the script had focused more on building suspense and showing us more of what the sheep were doing (there is one scene where they are attacking the little boy and you can surely tell the sheep are animatronic puppets).  Overall, though, there is some interesting facts about genetics and Malone makes us stay interested, even up to its uh-oh, here come the chickens ending.",1107907200,6,1708,4.6138613861386135
8032505,5,B0002V7TYM,"Im not really sure why everyone here disliked this movie.  It stars jena malone from donnie darko and jamie harrold dr. elmer from steven king's kingdom hospital.  The story is great the cinematography was really good the actors were great, the special effects were awesome.  This isn't really a horror movie its a thriller with lots of elements that could come true.  I would have to say that the ending is not what i would have done with it and is a bit unfinished but the movie had lots of story and got to long.  Most places around carry this for rent, just don't be afraid and make your own opinion.",1107648000,2,604,4.405405405405405
8032506,3,B0002V7TYM,"This movie isn't that bad, it's not a big bugget movie people shouldnt complaint just because a movie dun have enough special effect to fool ur logical determination for how good it should be. THIS movie does make a point, its kindda taking the danger of eating mad cow meat point to a further side, u can even consider this is a sci-fi movie. Some of the scene have taken the materials too over-done and the cuttie Jena Malone is good but not that kindda acting u would say good if u compare it to something like ""erin brockouich"" from Julia robert, which u can kindda put this movie to the same catergory with EB.",1107216000,,615,4.356521739130435
8032507,2,B0002V7TYM,"So I see this movie at Blockbuster. It's got a pretty ridiculous 3-D prismatic cover that features a herd of demonic sheep and it's called ""Corn"". I couldn't resist...

The tagline on the video box, ""It's not nice to fool with Mother Nature"" is borrowed from an old margarine commercial. This thing has got to be awful, right? Well, the reality is that it's not quite as bad as you might imagine. It ends up being a weird Rosemary's Baby kind of story about genetic manipulation and aggression. Not done with the same panache of 28 Days Later, it still strives for a unique story. In the end, ""When Sheep Attack"" might have been a better title, and it's pretty boring at times... but I think two stars is fair.",1104883200,,710,4.461538461538462
