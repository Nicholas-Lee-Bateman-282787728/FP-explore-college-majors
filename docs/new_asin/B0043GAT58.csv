NAKED FURY (aka: The Pleasure Lovers) -- (1959) (57 min/B&W) -- Charles Saunders [Director] - Reed De Rouen, Kenneth Cope, Leigh Madison, Arthur Lovegrove, Alexander Field, Tommy Eytle & Ann Lynn
Low budget production with some atmospheric locations, filmed in black and white with characters acting natural in unexpected ways even with a crisis breathing down their necks --- keeps you interested in where this story is going.  [2 Star Rating]

COVER GIRL KILLER -- (1960) (61 min/B&W) -- Roy Boulting (Director) - Harry H. Corbett, Felicity Young, Spencer Teakle, Victor Brooks, Bernadette Milnes,  Christina Gregg & Tony Doonan,
One of the better low budget British crime dramas, as young girls are dying after appearing on the cover of ""WOW"" magazines --- Take note that the ""Cover Girl Killer' digs deep into our souls on the subject matter of entertainment, reflecting on the subject as we watch plans for a film version of the film we are actually watching --- Considered a lost film, but kept alive on the strength of Corbett's appearance and historically being one of the earliest slasher films.  [3 Star Rating]
