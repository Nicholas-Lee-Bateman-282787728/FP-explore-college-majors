I've lived on the border of Canada my whole life. I've watched allot of Canadien TV. Some good, some not so good. This show blows me away! the music is incredible, the cast is believable, and the stories are very relavent in today's world. Highly recommend this show.",1298505600,2,409,4.54054054054054
