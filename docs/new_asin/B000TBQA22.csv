8393818,5,B000TBQA22,This paints a delightful picture of how to teach language skills to elementary and preschool aged children. The preschool ideas remind me somewhat of the Montessori method I used professionally and at home to teach little children. I believe this method is more effective and thorough.,1483920000,,285,5.217391304347826
8393819,3,B000TBQA22,"There is no information on the jacket or the review as far as what is covered in this video so I thought I would expound. It is about 30 minutes long. It is home-made by the whole McColl family. Britta speaks briefly a few times about the program...what you need to carry it out, how she used it with her children. Then she is filmed in many short clips teaching her children using this method. I bought is as an intro to the program before I bought whole core kit because I wanted to know if I need to go to the seminar in order to teach it. I wouldn't say that it helped me tremendously with my decision. Personally I would say that $20 is a little steep for a 30 minute homemade video without a clear purpose.",1406332800,8,712,4.129496402877698
