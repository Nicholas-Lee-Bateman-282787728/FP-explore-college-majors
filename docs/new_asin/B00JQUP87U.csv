8653387,3,B00JQUP87U,I didn't think the quality of the DVD itself was very good.  It seemed to pixelate and break up on my HD TV.  It wasn't up to par with the other DVDs I have from Star Cinema.  The storyline was fairly good but you have to be ok with an unhappy ending.,1420502400,,251,3.7884615384615383
