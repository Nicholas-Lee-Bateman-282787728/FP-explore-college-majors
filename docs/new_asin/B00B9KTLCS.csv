5564549,5,B00B9KTLCS,"I love this video so much. Almost as much as I love the malibu Pilates chair. It seems like a simple workout but it gives GREAT results. I also love it because on days that I just dread working out and have zero energy, i can pop this in and get a good workout instead of sitting on the couch and not have to run on a treadmill or lift million pound weights. I stopped working out for a while (ok a few months) and just recently started this up again and actually broke out in a good sweat and found it much harder than when I last did it. (I built up great strength while doing it and now am back at square 1 since I stopped. Not surprising.) last time I stuck to it though, I felt my thighs slim down within a few weeks! (Doing this 3-4 times/wk) such an awesome feeling. It's also super easy to fit into your schedule and very relaxing so it's great to unwind after a long day but still gives you energy to start the day if you do it in the morning. I can't say enough good things about this!",1353974400,4,995,3.98

8564675,5,B00B9KTLCS,"I ordered this because I had lost the one I had.  The DVD is wonderful and I've made a lot of progress by using it.
I am completely satisfied with the DVD and the seller who helped me purchase it.",1377475200,,196,3.9
8564676,5,B00B9KTLCS,This is a great starting point for those new to Malibu Pilates.  I've wanted one of these chairs for years and finally got one cheaper on EBay.  This DVD starts you off on a relatively easy routine that takes only 20-25 minutes to complete.  It lets you get used to the chair and how to preform the exercises.  I think I will continue to use it when time is a factor.,1375142400,,367,4.126760563380282
8564677,4,B00B9KTLCS,Short but detailed!  Very helpful introduction for the beginner.  Probably could have shown different levels of beginners rather than and experienced trainer.,1361491200,,158,6.136363636363637
