7559687,5,B018YGWQH6,"Justin Kurzels new presentation of Macbeth is a stunning and original interpretation. The play is well known yet every element has been reimagined and the viewer is treated to a powerful and satisfying experience.

Visually, the film is extraordinary. The battle scenes are brutal and shocking. The director uses a realist approach which emphasises the harshness and ruthlessness of this world. The shots of the landscape evoke desolation. Each of the settings is not simply a backdrop to the action, but functions more like a character in its right. The most effective and interesting camera work creates the wonderful interpretations of familiar scenes. To avoid spoilers I will simply say that key scenes in the play, such as Macbeths vision of the dagger, the brilliant interpretation of Birnam Woods encroachment on Dunsinane, or the deaths of Lady Macduff and her children, are brilliant. Each of the soliloquys is skilfully reimagined.
Of particular note are the images of children throughout the film. The opening scene shows Macbeth and Lady Macbeth burying a child and childrens faces are a key focus in many scenes. The horrific effects of this society on its children are foregrounded. We are familiar with images of child victims of war and of child soldiers. These are re-conctextualised in Macbeth, making a powerful statement about war. This is also one of the keys to Fassbeners Macbeth, who is grim and smouldering. We see a man who has had some element of his soul and his humanity, ripped from him.

Comparisons with Polanskis Macbeth are inevitable. Both interpretations are brilliant. Where Fassbender broods, Jon Finch rages. Both films are dark and Gothic. The imagery in Kurzels version adds fire and flames as a significant symbol. The dialogue in this interpretation has been pared back, and some viewers may be disappointed at what has been left out. But the film more than makes up for this with its stunning visuals which give a strong impression of medieval Scotland; a world both familiar and alien. The changes made to the story and the scenes that have been added all enhance its meaning. Like the Polanski, this film uses an eerie and haunting soundtrack to great effect.",1449705600,69,2206,5.041095890410959

7559690,2,B018YGWQH6,I found this version of Macbeth unimpressive. It makes use of too much flash. The dialogue is somewhat stale and action too spotty. There's no real flow to this version of Macbeth.,1523664000,,180,4.65625

7559693,5,B018YGWQH6,"When I decided to find a film of ""Macbeth"" to purchase, I was quickly drawn to this one, since the murderous couple was played by 2 of the most talented and beautiful actors on the planet, Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard. And I was not disappointed. Lady Macbeth chilled me to the bone as she called upon the spirits to ""unsex me here, and fill me from the crown to the toe, top-full of direst cruelty"". She was revved up for action before her husband was. As for Macbeth himself, he was calm and almost matter-of-fact as he first stabbed his victim with the dagger; but his facial expression and his actions increased in savagery as he continued, as if he could tear the deed itself to shreds, to make it disappear. Another element of the film that impressed me was the starkness of the outdoor scenes, of which there were many. The bleak surroundings prepare the viewer for the evils to come. When I read the reviews of others, I noticed 3 negative things that I ignored when I made my choice. The first was that the film was generally so dark that it was hard to see what was happening. I have to agree; much of the film was dark but I did not find this to be a disadvantage. The second criticism was that the actors mumbled their lines, making it difficult to understand what was said. Again, I agree. The actors kept it extremely low-key. Even the witches were surprisingly quiet. But I take issue with the third negative, that the subtitles did not help. They absolutely did. They were easy to see and easy to read, and they made up for the low-key speech. The beauty of Shakespeare's language was not lost. All things considered, I thought this film was excellent. It helps if you already know the story, but this is true of just about every historical drama I have seen.",1521331200,2,1786,4.464831804281346

Dont get me wrong, its beautiful and well produced, but this truncated version, omitting most of the material from the witches, including some of the most memorable lines and ideas of the play, really let me down.",1519689600,,280,4.73469387755102

7559699,4,B018YGWQH6,"Macbeth the film takes some liberties with Macbeth the play. Not all of them work: editing out lines that get called out in later soliloquies kind of takes some of the edge off them. But some of them are brilliant. Lady Macbeth is recontextualized with an added ""prequel"" scene that has ample textual support as something that must have happened at some point. We get more context for Macbeth as well, most of which made sense. Head to the comment section for a brief but spoiler-y description of that new context.

The cinematography is fantastic, and Marion Cotillard is the best Lady Macbeth I have ever seen. (And I seriously cannot get enough of this play - I have watched it so many times, so many ways, by so many companies - put it on, andI'll go see it.) To me, this felt almost like one of Zeffirelli's adaptations: lush, natural, unstaged, with actors who are almost too beautiful. The main difference is that Zeffirelli always stuck very close to the text, almost line for line, and this adds material and takes some away. If it had stuck with additions and skipped the subtractions, I'd have rated it five stars. As is, it is a solid four-and-a-half.",1518739200,,1163,4.618357487922705
7559700,5,B018YGWQH6,"I just finished watching the movie version of the play Macbeth with Michael Fassbender. Director Justin Kurzel's movie is well acted. Subdued, angry, desperate and bloody with all the conniving and angst of Shakespeare's original play. Kurzel's version of Macbeth does leave out a page here and there from the original script with a few minor variations. In my opinion it is a great movie with well thought out cinematography, fantastic visuals and music. Different than what I have seen before and possibly not a film for the purest .This version of Macbeth is a slightly different treatment of Shakespeare's timeless play of political corruption in 11th century Scotland and very apropos for the vile self aggrandising  politics of today.",1518393600,,740,5.166666666666667

7559702,4,B018YGWQH6,"This comes close to taking too much liberty with the source material, but it's outstanding nonetheless. The acting is excellent, the dialogue is natural, and the aesthetic is gritty and original. Other than Branagh's films, this is perhaps the finest on-screen adaptation of Shakespeare I have seen (and the best version of Macbeth).",1515024000,,333,5.30188679245283

7559706,2,B018YGWQH6,"I know that it's always a concern when filming Shakespearean plays that running time not get out of hand, and this issue was certainly addressed in this version - unfortunately. It was entirely too obvious that the director was intent on creating a memorable cinematic work and had no qualms about shortchanging the deservedly famous story in order to do this. Macbeth seems to go from honorable, loyal thane to vicious, ruthless traitor to the crown in the space of five minutes and for no particular reason. His legendary wife has even less motivation than he does. The acting that so many people rave about was all but absent, with mumbled deadpan deliveries of some of the Bard's most impassioned writing. The best acting was, in my opinion, that of Macduff. After the reviews I had read elsewhere, I was expecting far better. It's not all bad - the cinematography, while at times overly burdened with gimmickry, was fascinating; the score, which some found irritating, was wonderfully bleak and dirge-like; the production design takes us to a frigid, wind-swept Scotland ravaged by endless warfare in an age when this was the norm for most Europeans. The film - to its detriment, as I noted earlier - certainly can't be accused of being slow. It moves along so quickly it felt more like an episode of some Netflix series than a feature film.",1512432000,4,1346,4.806034482758621
7559707,5,B018YGWQH6,"Honestly the best version of Macbeth out there, in my opinion.  It takes a couple liberties, very creative ones that read the text well and respectfully, but these breathe new life into a play that has been done over and over with little variation.  (If you want a by-the-book, word-for-word version of play, this isn't for you.)  This film delves into the psychology of the characters more than any other I've seen.  Why are the Macbeths willing to murder?  It's a complex interplay of personal loss and trauma, and trauma as a means to fill a void.  Lady Macbeth is not evil, she is broken.  Macbeth is not evil, he is also broken, weary, and willing to do anything for his wife who's been utterly destroyed by the loss of their child.  The landscapes are epic and breathtaking, the music is haunting and tense.  The acting is superb.",1512259200,,836,4.594594594594595

7559710,1,B018YGWQH6,"I have watched at least a dozen film versions of Macbeth, and this is one is the most disappointing. I found the sound tract very hard to follow. The actors tended to whisper or mumble their lines. There were numerous, significant deviations from Shakespeare's script, so this film would be totally unsuitable for students.

7559722,4,B018YGWQH6,"I've not liked these Shakespearean adaptions. Granted, I have not seen many, but there is something inherently disorienting in applying such lyrical and baroque dialogue to film--the close-ups and deftness with which film can unpack behavior almost renders the language moot. The said, I did enjoy it in this picture. First off, the acting is stellar. Cotillard and Fassbender are so so so good. There's something more than just well-enunciated verse here. They are acting the lines with a subtlety and intimacy that one can't get in a theatrical performance and is in fact better suited to film. The cinematography is STUNNING. It is so moody and atmospheric. There are great sweeping shots combined with very intimate close-ups. And the editing is so inventive and affecting, especially for something adapted from the theater. The music by Jed Kurtzel is really wonderful. Brooding and dark without trying to spell out the emotions of a scene. BUT one wonders if this was written with sparser, more realistic dialogue if it would have improved the story-telling. Let's be honest with ourselves. No one talks like this and thus it mucks with suspension of disbelief. All in all, this is a masterful effort by the director Justin Kurtzel and everyone involved.",1498867200,,1260,5.091787439613527

The way the movie was made was fine for me, but I know the Shakespeare version by heart. For my students, it was confusing. As well, my students complained about how ""quietly"" the characters spoke.

The only difference in the movie and the film version (and the reason why I gave this 4 stars) is because of the way the witches are portrayed in this movie.

This movie is what I imagine being on Prozac is like -- feeling is drained away and all you are left with is rote motion acted out according to the laws of emotional averages. There was no sense of tragedy with the Macbeths; there was no indication of a rise and fall. The main characters were just as unlikable and emotionally detached at the end of the movie as they were at the beginning.  I didn't care for the edits made to the script; the few interesting ideas (foregrounding the loss of the Macbeths' child, for example) were wasted and ultimately lost in the ensuing jumble of shifted dialogue. The witches were possibly the least interesting manifestations of the characters I've ever seen put to film. Had the director removed them entirely little would have been lost.

I have learned so many things about each play by watching various versions. This particular version was visually stunning and incredibly visceral. I thought that this version seemed to spend more time at the beginning of the play introducing the Weird Sisters and developing Macbeth's obsession with their predictions - which I thought was well done and not the case for many other interpretations. That being said, I just never saw the angst and mental obsessions develop in Macbeth and Lady Macbeth that make this story so disturbing. Fassbender, admittedly a great choice for this role, seemed to be too content (?) or even at ease (?) with the state of events. I think that one of the most interesting parts of Macbeth's character is that he is falling apart at the seams mentally and his kingdom is going with him. I just didn't see that in this interpretation - and it left me with a feeling that something was lacking. I wanted to see more distraught from Lady Macbeth as well - and it obviously was not Coutillard's acting - but it seemed that it had more to do with the way her lines were assigned in this version that left her somewhat distraught - but not enough that she all of a sudden dies. The pain, the mental anguish, the insanity just weren't evoked enough in either character. Hope that helps",1480032000,24,1456,4.625482625482626

I really enjoyed Patrick Stewart's Macbeth much more, but it wasn't just Patrick Stewart's performance that made it a great movie.  It was Kate Fleetwood's Lady Macbeth and other aspects of the production (like how they handled the three witches) that made it a great movie, things I should probably attribute to the director.

I'll admit that there are some hokey elements and that the liberties with the original text are questionable, but i find the cinematography, pacing (the unrelenting dread that creeps and grows), and the music to be a commentary on the play that is lacking in other renditions.

As a high school teacher, I found it useful to juxtapose this version with the adaptation starring Patrick Stewart to talk specifically about production being an act of interpretation.

Just for comparison, I found Pulankski's version (a Playboy Production in fact) to be almost unwatchable and too laughable to show students. Using all three to show the complexity of Lady Macbeth's character is worthwhile.

One thing about this cinematic version of Macbeth: if gives a psychological explanation (an extra-textual loss of one if not not two children) to explain the motivation behind their actions. That displaces the idea of evil that is a traditional theme of study.

Again, more fodder for discussion about the large human issues in the play.

I like all of the actors individually.  It's unfair to make any judgments against them on the basis of this film.

Subtitles are a must if you want to make out any of the dialogue.  That which isn't bellowed is whispered.

The softening of the characters did not create the sympathy it seemed to be reaching for.
If the Macbeth clan was so aggrieved by a family death what then drives the dark ambition that leads to murder?
The 'adaptation' of the subject material is poorly done.  It wanders and leaves too many questions unanswered.

7559863,5,B018YGWQH6,"In Fassbender's Macbeth, the cold, inhospitable landscape of northern Scotland becomes an important character in the play. The addition of a prequel in which the Macbeths are seen burying a young boy gives possible insight into the hardening of Lady Macbeth's  character, and the two Mabeths' determination to see that Banquo's issue will not sit on the throne of Scotland. The slow-motion battle scenes are appropriately ruthless and bloody. The acting is brilliant, with the exception of Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth, who was brought in as a last-minute substitute for two other actresses who had to back out. I have never seen a better Macbeth.",1473465600,,651,5.1415094339622645

7559869,4,B018YGWQH6,"The excellent cinematography and atmospherics take a cue from Throne of Blood, Akira Kurosawa's grim adaptation of Macbeth. There is more than the occasional hint of a version of oriental pessimism in this compellingly bleak picture of feudal Scotland.
The changes to the plot do seem pointless.
Marion Cotillard is among the best Lady Macbeths I've seen, and perfect for this version with her spooky fragility. Michael Fassbender slightly disappoints, though. I admire most of his acting that I've seen, but here he sustains a grim monotony throughout even the most crucial turning-points. His delivery particularly irked me hearing him say the lines ""the multitudinous seas incarnadine, Making the green one red..."" For no fathomable reason Fassbender inserts a caesura: ""Making the green...one red."" Very silly. I can only conjecture Fassbender may be quietly subverting the studio a la Marlon Brando, an obscure middle finger to Amazon Studios and Jeff Bezos",1472774400,,962,5.377483443708609

7559877,2,B018YGWQH6,"I really wanted to like this movie. ""Macbeth"" is my favorite Shakespeare play and Fassbender and Cotillard are two of my favorite actors. Unfortunately, while the scenery was often  spectacular, the words, the best part of any Shakespeare play, were often whispered, mumbled, or rendered incomprehensible in the soft peat of impenetrable Scottish accents. Shakespeare always had comedy even in his darkest plays; this has none. It is bleak from start to finish. I appreciate that the director is trying to reinterpret the play and put his mark on it, but this just sinks into the mud.",1471910400,5,584,5.020618556701031
7559878,4,B018YGWQH6,"It's quiet, ominous, brooding, and slow-paced, but I appreciated that. Fassbender and Cotillard's faces were so expressive, perfectly capturing the MacBeths' descent into madness and despair. The cinematography is spectacular -- every scene executed beautifully. I also loved the film's reimagining and interpretations of certain soliloquies. I am docking a star due to the fact that they skipped some wonderful lines and scenes in this film. The witches' cauldron and ""Stars, hide your fires"" are the two biggest that come to my mind. But overall, I recommend this move. Enjoy!",1471824000,2,578,5.433333333333334

I couldn't understand why they chose to divert from the source material right from the get-go (it was not an improvement), so unfortunately the rest of the experience was essentially ruined for me. However, I think it's a fairly good film, but not as good an adaptation as some others.",1471824000,,376,4.712121212121212
7559880,4,B018YGWQH6,"I had low expectations about this movie but was pleasantly surprised: it was very good (great in fact for the first half and then trailing off a bit in the second half).

Am not sure what a PTSD interpretation implies.  A traditional interpretation of Shakespeare's Macbeth runs along the lines: ""let not the world see my dark desires"" (moral sickness as the root problem).  No matter Justin Kurzel and Michael Fassbender's inspiration for their Macbeth, the film still works along the lines of an ever quickening descent into the abyss (moral to the traditional and my way of viewing it; physical, I assume, for their way of viewing it; but either way the actions of the play are the same).

The film is extremely streamlined.  If one is familiar with the play many of your favorite lines and entire scenes are likely cut.  But such streamlining speeds the blows of terrible deeds and the presence of a soul lost to the dark desires fills the landscape (this film captures the mood of dread presence better than any other---this is Kurzel's great success).

An essential insight which Shakespeare has managed to dramatize is that no sooner has Duncan been murdered than the thought occurs to Macbeth that he has stained his soul and his mind for the crown only so Banquo's heirs will, in the end, hold the crown.  Unless Banquo's heirs are wiped out, Macbeth believes, in the long run, his actions will have been for nothing.

This nothing culminates in the Tomorrow speech which embeds Shakespeare's insight.  A life emptied of all goodness, a life spent in pursuit of money, power, reputation, or pleasure is a ""tale told by an idiot"" and is truly not a life worth living.",1471737600,3,1675,4.744827586206896

7559891,5,B018YGWQH6,"This is a great version of Macbeth, with Michael Fassbender effortlessly inhabiting the title role.  Marion Cotillard virtually disappears into the role of Lady Macbeth, and all the other players are fantastic.  The cinematography is beautiful, with great use of light and color (and the absence of it).  The only thing I didn't like were the bonuses.  The interview with Fassbender is conducted by a very annoying man, and the Making Of video is not essential.  I also took great exception to the director attributing Macbeth's action to what we now call PTSD, which in essence would rob this play of being the tragedy Shakespeare intended it to be.  I say watch the film and ignore the extras, and you will enjoy it greatly.",1470614400,,726,4.814516129032258

7559893,5,B018YGWQH6,"This is -- by far-- the very best film adaptation of any Shakespeare play that I've ever seen. The very very best-- and frankly I'm astounded by the fact that no one talks about this movie. I think it's because of the Shakespeare stigma-- there is this thing that people tell themselves-- that somehow before jump, the play will be ""too hard to understand""-- but really-- all you have to do is hand yourself over to this one. The photography is unbelievably gorgeous-- the whole movie reads like a cinematic painting-- the images are so vivid, so well contrived-- and then the music creates a harrowing heaviness that somehow manages to permeate the film from beginning to end. Michael Fassbender manages to capture Macbeth's psychological undoing so masterfully-- and Marion Cortillard is the quintessential Lady Macbeth.

I really can't say it enough. This movie is a work of cinematic genius. It is heart-breakingly beautiful-- a gorgeous rendering of a thoroughly terrible story.",1470009600,,983,5.067901234567901

I'm going back to my Sir Patrick Stewart version.",1469836800,,327,4.125

7559896,4,B018YGWQH6,"While the acting and production quality are fantastic (Fassbender and Cotillard have received high praise for their performances) and the movie tells the story in accord with the spirit of the text, students, especially college students, will find this a highly edited version. Many speeches are reduced to mere phrases and others cut altogether. Multiple direction choices (setting up the play as an aftermath of the death of the Macbeths' daughter, giving them a son who dies in battle against Macdonwald, having the murder of Duncan occur live on scene rather than reported by Macbeth, there even seems to be a fourth witch) all are significant departures from the strict letter of the play. It's still a wonderful performance, and perhaps more successful than most in rousing the pity and fear that allow for Aristotelian catharsis, but students should be forewarned. It is a version that shows how the plays can come to life visually, but not in strict adherence to what Shakespeare wrote.",1469664000,2,994,5.067073170731708

7559901,3,B018YGWQH6,"Visually excellent with stunning cinematography, but the actual acting leaves something to be desired. The soliloquys feel rushed and recited, and nearly every line is delivered as if it's the most intense thing.

It does, however, follow the play very closely with only a few glaring changes--the omission of the double, double, toil and trouble lines, and the Out Damn Spot scene happens in a shrine with no sleepwalking and no doctor to hear it. The film is otherwise very faithful to the original however.

In sum, it *looks* great and captures Scotland beautifully, is mostly faithful to the play, but is lacking in its actual delivery from the actors.",1469318400,,657,4.963636363636364

7559925,1,B018YGWQH6,"In 11th century Scotland, King Duncan (David Thewlis) has just put down a rebellion with the help of his thane and cousin, Macbeth (Michael Fassbender). Out of gratitude, Duncan promises to bestow great honors and lands and even greater rewards upon Macbeth. But this is not enough. For you see, after the battle was won, Macbeth happened upon 4 witches who prophecized that HE will be king of Scotland. While Macbeth might have been content to let the prophecy come true of its own accord, his wife, Lady Macbeth, (Marion Cotillard)  wants to speed up the process a bit. By murdering King Duncan. What happens after that is pretty predictable, summed up by Shakespeare's quote, ""...blood will have blood.""

Director Justin Kurzel begins the movie with a scene that never happens in the play. It shows Macbeth and his wife burying what appears to be their only child, a young daughter. I didn't really see the point of adding this in. Was it supposed to make us think that it had something to do with the action that comes in the movie? Are the Macbeths in a state of emotional disarray that allows the witches prophecies to work on their weakened minds? Is this the reason that increases Macbeth's jealousy and resentment of the fate that he will have no heirs as king while Banquo will be father of MANY kings? Perhaps.

Something else that kinda threw me off was the witches. In the play they are these evil, hideous creatures that took delight in causing the fall of Macbeth and all the death and destruction it brings. In the movie, Kurzel increases their number by one and depicts them as essentially normal looking humans. They seem to represent the different stages of mortality, being composed of a baby, a young girl a middle aged woman, and an old woman. In contrast to the witches in the play, these witches look sad and almost regretful of what they are doing. In the play, the witches motivations are pretty straightforward. They want to do bad things to Macbeth. Here they just seem like innocent peasants drafted into someone else's nightmare. It just never seemed clear to me who or what the witches were or what they wanted.

To me, there were two things that dragged down this movie. First up, Michael Fassbender's performance. I could swear he swallowed some bars or other depressant before his scenes. I've seen him in a lot of movies and he's always on point, but in this movie it all just seems so dialed in most of the time. His eyes just look dead. Every once in a while, maybe for about 5 minutes in total, Fassbender does do some acting instead of just reciting. This occurs mostly in the parts where Macbeth's sanity is starting to go, such as during the dinner scene where Banquo's ghost shows up. During those brief spurts you get a glimpse of what the movie COULD have been.

Fassbender's performance ties in directly to the second major thing that sank this movie for me. Namely, all the actors are so restrained that they literally WHISPER 95% of their dialogue. I don't know if Kurzel specifically told all his actors to whisper, but he must have, because they ALL do it. The play of Macbeth is not an extended monologue. The actors need to communicate with each other and react. On top of the low voice level, the acting itself is pure deadpan, except for Macduff (Sean Harris). At least he seems to get upset and his voice more occasionally rises to a normal talking level. Think Star Wars prequel Jedi acting and multiply that by 10 to gauge the emotional range of the performers in this movie.

The barely audible bad acting in this movie falls squarely on the shoulders of Justin Kurzel. I understand what he was trying to do here. He was trying to do an art house movie with lots of mood and ominous foreboding but seemed to lack the talent to accomplish it. For example, there's a big fire at the end and he chooses to just wash out the whole picture with orange and red in a move of heavy handed symbolism. He just seems to place things in the movie that make no sense and just expects the audience to say ""oooo, that's cool!"". Unfortunately, Kurzel is teaming up with Fassbender again in the upcoming Assassin's Creed movie, which makes me become very unexcited.

7559935,2,B018YGWQH6,"The best way to describe this version - the third I have seen - is as ""Shakespeare meets Game of Thrones."" Not surprising they took this approach seeing the success of that dark fantasy series. Unfortunately, as with Game of Thrones, what results is something dark, violent, and ultimately less than satisfying.

First, this production needs to be applauded just for staying in an appropriately medieval setting, as opposed to all the anachronistic versions floating around out there that move the action to 20th Century Eastern Europe, the Victorian era, or some other inappropriate time period for the subject matter. What is more, this production should be applauded for the wonderful cinematography by Adam Arkapaw. This is a beautifully shot movie that uses the Scottish Highlands to wonderful effect in creating Macbeth's nightmarish reality. Truly excellent work here.

Sadly, that is about all good I can say about this interpretation. My first gripe is that Shakespeare's play has been so truncated here that it loses much of its emotional impact. Not only have some key scenes been completely removed, but other sections has been so compressed that at times they just don't make much sense. For example, in this version Macbeth's decline from nobility to regicide is so swift as to be bewildering. Again, even though this is the third interpretation of Macbeth that I have seen, I found myself getting confused at times because the story was jumping around so much.

Secondly, the acting is mediocre at best. While Michael Fassbender has shown himself to be a very good actor in other films, here he sleepwalks his way through the story as Macbeth, delivering his lines with all the enthusiasm of someone terribly bored and disinterested in the material he has been given. To call his performance ""one note"" would be, frankly, giving it too much credit. Then there is Marion Cotillard's Lady Macbeth. Unfortunately for the film, Cotillard lacks the sufficient gravitas to be the scheming shrew who was Lady Macbeth. Adding insult to injury, her role has also been so truncated that it might as well not even be there. Instead of being the impetus for Macbeth's fall from grace, she comes across as little more than an indifferent opportunist who is seen to inexplicably swing from craving power at any cost to being bored and then completely disinterested by subsequent events, something that makes her later suicide something of a non sequitur. I suspect this blah interpretation of such an iconic villainess is due to a politically correct impulse to moderate her character. Whatever the reason, this production is severely hampered by thoroughly lackluster and idle performances from key characters.

Thirdly, even the language seems to have suffered in this production. Macbeth, as with just about every other Shakespeare play, is enjoyable not just for the story but for the Bard's god-like use of the English language. Incredibly, not once did any of the Bard's verse ring out in this interpretation. Perhaps it was due to the lifeless acting where golden material was delivered like lead balloons, or maybe the scriptwriters just decided to excise the best of the verse, but whatever the reason, this production of Macbeth seemed to lack all of the expected lyrical magic of a Shakespearean production. Perhaps this is the most damning critique of all.

The last nail in the coffin of this film is the dreadfully slow pacing. I understand that the director was going for a suitably nightmarish approach, but what arrives here is less nightmare and more snooze-fest. Between the droning music and the endless slow motion sequences, I was almost ready to kill Macbeth just to end my suffering. Tone it down, fellas.

Take all that, and add is some needless sexual groping and moaning (no doubt to please the GoT crowd), excessive violence, and a cliched close-up of Macduff vomiting (an odd thing for an experienced soldier to do after seeing some blood), and what you ultimately have in this version is...well, much ado about nothing. Seek out much better versions of this play, such as Roman Polanski's classic 1971 version or even the more recent Patrick Stewart version which is only marred by its 20th Century setting.  Not recommended.",1466985600,11,4256,5.036931818181818

Lady Macbeth did not sleepwalk at all, but, instead, sat on the floor of a chapel with a mysterious baby as she uttered her soliloquy. The battle scenes were well done, yet they weren't enough to make up for the odd deviations from the original play. This is definitely NOT a family friendly version since there was just enough groping and implied sex (motions without the nudity) to be inappropriate for younger viewers. The murder of the king by Macbeth was a very drawn out stabbing over and over and over.and over... I found both it and the sex scenes to be gratuitous, detracting greatly from the movie.

7559946,4,B018YGWQH6,"There have been many renditions of the Macbeth play. By far, this one is one of the most original ones visually.  Director kept the original language and what I found amazing in this version of Marion Cottilard's rendition of Lady Macbeth.  She gives a stunning performance and has not a slighted hint of French accent.  It just goes to say what a marvelous actress she is.

I always like the story of Macbeth.  This play was written by Shakespeare to celebrate coronation of King James I who inherited the throne of his cousin Queen Elizabeth I.  It is a homage to his Scottish ancestry and nod to his rightful claim to the throne.  Macbeth is originally perceived as a righteous man, he defends the uprising against the rightful Scottish king.  But ravages of war leave a mark on Macbeth and once the war is over he and his wife are of perception that their king is not showing them due honor by giving them more of - well anything: power, land, money - you name it.  Ambitious Lady Macbeth coerces her husband to kill the king and assume the throne.  But Macbeth's conscience gets the better of him and before long the sensitive young warrior looses his own self, looses his power to feel any emotion.  He starts killing every baby and child in his kingdom he sees as a threat and even after Lady Macbeth dies, he is unable to show any emotion  for loosing a woman he once loved.

Macbeth is a story of greed, lust for power and treacherous bad side of ambition that has no limits.  Those are the reasons why to this day it remains relevant to our modern world.  Our way of life may have changed form hundreds of years ago, but human characters has not evolved much.  This is a kind of a movie that requires all of your attention.  The ancient English language and metaphors require complete focus.  Bu the movie is a powerful, if not more visually pleasing, from all previously made versions of the film.",1466380800,,1908,4.481159420289855

I was looking forward to seeing it along with some friends and the opening was very promising - after all scenes were set in the Cuillin and those were authentically atmospheric. Unfortunately, Mabeth quickly devolved into a much less interesting psychoanalysis of Macbeth and his Lady requiring leaps of faith, suspension of disbelief, and rewriting the classic Scottish tale in ways that made me think it had been a group effort by college freshmen. The movie explains away ambition, lust for power, self-delusion, and the other accoutrements of the dark side of humanity as cause and effect of good people having bad times. (A lot of people have bad times and they don't commit regicide or urge spouses to murder.) Meandering accents and droning delivery also made it difficult to stay awake mid way through the movie and so unfortunately, I really can't recommend Macbeth for anything other than it's opening and Scottish scenery.

7559988,1,B018YGWQH6,"I bought this based on the generally positive reviews here, and a very favorable review in the Washington Post.  Macbeth is perhaps my favorite piece of literature of any genre.  I have seen the play performed live countless times, and have seen most of the major screen versions, including of course Orson's version, as well as Kurosawa's Throne of Blood.  The setting, scenery and costumes are all excellent--but that is it.  The opening sequence contains snippets in slow motion, and the action of the rest of the play plods along as if it too is in slow motion virtually the entire time.  The witches are unfocussed, both in character and in place, and command no sense of unworldliness or even melancholy for that matter.  There are children scattered throughout the story, all of whom have no place in this story.  None of the actors appear comfortable speaking the original Shakespearean lines, and many don't even appear to comprehend what they are saying from their own lips.  The range of madness and emotions is not borne by the players but only by the surroundings and the music, and as such, only barely.  This version is so bad I really wish I could rewind my brain back to the moment before I saw it, so I wouldn't have such a poor vision of Macbeth mixed in with all the other great versions I have seen--this version contaminates the waters so much, that it leaves a foul stench behind.

Everything in this movie works, from the acting and the simplistic yet stunning costumes, to the haunting music and the cinematography...its just amazing. The only things I really found flawed in this adaptation were the lines and scenes cut from the original play that I felt were important, but the director certainly made took the play and made it his own, and it was very well done. This film is a welcomed change of pace from all the predictable stagnant films that are produced every year.

This version is extraordinary in many ways, good or bad according to one's taste. The text is reduced by about half -- so much so that it's hard to follow the story if you don't know it already. You've never seen witches like this, you've never seen Duncan murdered like this,you've never seen Lady Macbeth's powers of persuasion used like this, you've never seen the woods come to Dunsinane like this. Macbeth himself speaks in whispers, and only seems fully engaged in battles, of which there are many, in bloody slo-mo. The great speeches are there, though, superbly delivered by Fassbender and Cotillard. Such an extreme reconstruction of Macbeth is bound to be controversial -- love it or hate it -- but it's certainly interesting.",1464652800,,838,4.8671328671328675

But here is my great observation: This is not Shakespeare: it's just an adaptation of a major drama. I still wonder what was the purpose of presenting in the big screen such script. I guess this edition could have been possible due the neccesity of reducing the inherent complexities this masterpiece brings, in order to think about the great audiences where the visuals seem to be the vital essence, leaving aside other aesthetic issues.

A real pity!!!",1464652800,,699,4.768595041322314
7559996,2,B018YGWQH6,"I couldn't sit through to the end of the movie.  Notwithstanding beautiful cinematography, and visually gorey, believable choreographed battle sequences, this film is better suited to the audience who has memorized the play.  I did say 'memorized'.  Audio levels in this otherwise beautiful production are an absolute abortion.

I like the story.  I like the author.  I've read Macbeth several times by instruction, and by leisure.  But the other reviewer who thought the actors were whispering wasn't far off.  By way of explaining why this is such a problem, consider the old Globe theater, and actors without microphones.  Now consider the language barrier between Elizabethan English and 21st century American colouquial dialog.  Do you see a pattern emerging?

As educated as William Shakespeare was, it behooves all imitators, thespians, and screenwriter adaptors at large to reckon with the fact that even in Elizibethan England some prose of the Bard was of such vastly superior form and elegance to make his English a foreign language in his own England.  Consequently, some of the best of the best Shakespearean actors/actresses on film are renowned on film for much more than their Sheakespeare.  Names like Ian Mcklellan, Judi Dench, Ian Holme, Hellen Miren, Patrick Stewart et. al.  Not one is such a powerful stage presence by muttering.  Capping off my rant,  I'd recommend Macbeth on film in the following renderings:

It does give the perspective of Macbeth as suffering from PTSD, and Fassbender and Cotillard do a fabulously believable job. They both seem consumed by remorse and are grief-stricken for multiple reasons. However, I can't give it 5 stars because it is not completely true to the text, and I keep getting pulled out of the story because the discrepancies seem jarring to me - maybe I've read Macbeth too many times.. Lady MacDuff is chased down in the forest and then burned alive in front of a crowd, crying lines that should have been spoken by Lennox. The presence of Malcolm immediately after Duncan's death complicates further. I showed parts of it to my students for contrast to the Patrick Stewart version; some preferred it for authenticity of time period, but others felt that the modern interpretation was closer to the original and hence, easier to follow.",1464566400,,934,4.917721518987341

I also admire the explanation of the Macbeths having lost children to explain how Lady Macbeth had ""given suck"" and ""loved the babe that milked [her],"" yet Macbeth is left with no heir in the play.  Nobody should doubt Fassbender or Cotillard's talent, but I wish Macbeth would have been more noble in the beginning so he had further to fall after Duncan's murder.  I wanted to see more strength, fire, and passion in Lady Macbeth, but that is my interpretation of her character.

7560017,3,B018YGWQH6,"Usually, Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are seen as people whose ambition leads to a downward spiral of senseless murders, anxiety,  paranoia, and eventual insanity. But director Justin Kurzel must put his spin on it. Kurzel wants a human perspective on Macbeth and his Lady. Nothing wrong with discovering what makes criminal minds ""tick."" But Kurzel wants us to feel sympathy-- or sympathize?? with the Macbeths. To this end, he presents them as ""products"" of their war environment. Macbeth (Michael Fassbender), you see is suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Hmmm... interesting perspective. So, that explains the cryptic predictions from the Three Witches and several other key plot elements that... what... spring from Macbeth's mind?? PTSD is hardly an excuse for multiple murders and outright tyranny, but Kurzel is determined to use it as such. And, oh, how Kurzel loves to hammer us over the head with his directorial points. Scenes of Macbeth in battle, and a general environment of war and death are evocatively presented. Before the plot really begins, there are dead bodies seemingly everywhere. And there will, of course, be more death to come. But here's another interpretation: it seems to me that the Macbeths are simply sociopaths here from the very beginning. Marion Cotillard's performance as a cold and deeply damaged Lady Macbeth is especially impressive. In an ironic juxtaposition, Lady Macbeth is seen several times in what looks like a small chapel, with a large cross tapestry and several lighted candles all around her. The chapel is where Cotillard's cold Lady plots the murder of King Duncan (""fill me, from the crown to the toe, top full of direst cruelty"") and also where she has her famous insane scene, delivered, I believe, to her dead child. The dramatic irony is indeed delicious.
  The screenplay by Todd Louiso, Jacob Koskoff and Michael Lesslie takes several liberties with Shakespeare's play that I didn't care for. But there are always alterations in film adaptations. ""Macbeth"" as a stage play usually runs about 2 hours and 20 minutes-- one of the shorter and much more accessible Shakespeare plays. But this film version runs one hour and 53 minutes. The result is rather ""choppy Shakespeare"", at best. Fassbender and Cotillard are not helped by the fact that important Shakespearean scenes and speeches are treated too conversationally or as interior monologues. Several big scenes are merely given a ""sing-song"", emotionally flat delivery.
  In the play, Macbeth's murder of King Duncan is done off-stage. Much is left to the imagination, although the plot is propelled by the emotional and psychological repercussions and after-effects. Kurzel leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination here, and he delights in the literal ""overkill."" Macbeth does not kill Duncan here. He massacres him, and, when he is FINALLY done, he lays down next to Duncan's dead body for a few seconds.  The DVD commentary says that Macbeth finds a measure of solace in his murder sprees. Well, he must! Macbeth orders his friend and comrade Banquo killed. Banquo is murdered in full view of his son Fleance, who is depicted as a young child here. Fleance escapes into the woods, and returns in a most intriguing way at the end. The screenplay omits the short scene between Lady Macduff and her son before their murders. Instead, we have Lady Macduff and several young children running in vain through the woods as she screams, ""MURDER! MURDER! MY BABIES! MY BABIES!"". Next, Lady Macduff and her children are burned alive at the stake; in full view of a very aware Macbeth and a weeping, powerless Lady Macbeth (who obviously realizes her husband went beyond madness long ago), and it looks like a few other people as well.  This is NOT in Shakespeare's play. Did I mention a strong sense of ""overkill."" I can't blame Kurzel for this; as I hear that Roman Polanski's ""post Manson murders""
(where his beautiful wife Sharon Tate was killed) version of ""Macbeth"" (which I haven't seen) is basically a cinema blood bath as well. Kurzel's version earns its ""R"" Rating for obvious reasons.
  The final battle between Macbeth and Macduff, set against  apocalyptic, burning fires of red and orange, is well staged. Young child Fleance returns and draws a sword. I'm surprised Kurzel did not end the film with Fleance cutting Macbeth's dead head from his body. It would have been poetic justice, after all, and he doesn't show much restraint elsewhere in the film, ""Macbeth"" is Shakespeare's fascinating and frightening masterpiece. Kurzel's film version is merely interesting and  frightening; without being particularly fascinating.",1463875200,,4655,5.127968337730871
7560018,5,B018YGWQH6,"A very interesting and original interpretation of Macbeth. There are some fascinating performances in this production. In addition to the compelling work of Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, David Hayman and David Thewlis are amazing, and Sean Harris is perhaps the most tragic Macduff I've ever seen. There are some really fine performances here. It's not the entire play. This is an edited version of Macbeth. The choices make sense. Justin Kurzel has created an entirely unique version of Macbeth. It's totally valid and consistent. I highly recommend this. It is a very emotionally real version of the play. You can feel it.",1463702400,,635,5.174757281553398
7560019,2,B018YGWQH6,"After reading so many positive reviews I was eager to see a newer interpretation, hopefully something I could even use in a high school classroom.  This movie fell flat.  Yes, the cinematography is gorgeous and stunning, but that doesn't carry a Shakespearean tragedy- it's got to be the language and dialogue!
In short, dialogue was subordinated in favor of sweeping cinematography.
The dialogue was barely discernible at times, and the characters seem to mumble in monotonous fashion.
I don't advocate overacting or screaming like the town crier, but there was no passion, and without passion, no tragedy.",1463529600,2,607,5.247422680412371
7560020,5,B018YGWQH6,Great movie and arrived very fast,1463270400,,33,4.666666666666667
7560021,5,B018YGWQH6,"It's Macbeth. With Fassbender and Cotillard. How could this not be amazing?

Like most adaptations, there were a couple scenes changed, but the story was remarkably free from meddling. Lots of directors take it upon themselves to edit the original material, in an effort to be ""new"" or ""edgy""--this can be interesting, but honestly a lot of the time I just want to see the story as Shakespeare imagined it, not someone's science-fictionized version, or someone's rom-com version, or someone's updated modern version, etc. The adaptations can get a little annoying. In short, this movie is clearly an attempt to remain true to the original story as imagined, set in medieval Scotland with Shakespeare's envisioning of the tragic ""historical"" king who destroyed himself for power.

There were some alterations, but these tended to follow the intent of the original story. For example, the opening scene has Macbeth and his Lady burying their dead child; while obviously not appearing in the original play, we do know from Lady M's speeches that she once had children but they died, and so seeing this added scene on screen was very stark and brought home the ""realism"" of what happened to this power couple. The movie maintains the traditional Macbeth obsession about children by giving the weird sisters a child as well, which was not a problematic addition, and which opened up some interesting interpretations. The one alteration that I had trouble with was Lady M's ""out, out, d**md spot"" scene, which was much too quiet and sedate for my taste (I always envisioned her as very frantic there, and I regretted the omission a couple of her other great lines as well, such as when she tenderly refers to Duncan as if he was her own father). But that scene still was an interesting interpretation, and a slight reveal at the end of it made me jump with surprise over what the character was actually doing.

Perhaps my favorite part in this is the chemistry between Macbeth and his Lady (literally, in a few rather sexualized scenes). It is clear from the play that despite their horrible actions, they are still very much in love, and their relationship can sometimes be underplayed in other interpretations. But here the film makes it clear that they deeply cared for each other, and the Lady's death scene was incredibly moving. The movie argues convincingly that Macbeth's end came as the result of her death, causing him to lose the will to live, rather than simply because he picked the wrong opponent in Macduff. Macbeth's insanity was portrayed convincingly, bringing him from the good loyal man to the traitorous murderer-king, and Lady Macbeth's death was here simply the ""straw that broke the camel's back."" I would very much like to study this interpretation in a film or Shakespeare class, as it showed a version of the Lady that could help undergraduates understand her complexity.

In short, this was a great interpretation and I have gladly watched it several times using my Prime account.",1463184000,2,3002,4.926877470355731
7560022,2,B018YGWQH6,"Visually, it's an intriguing take on the play. The changes to Shakespeare's work are not an improvement to me though, and perhaps I would enjoy the movie more if I didn't love the play as it is.",1463184000,,194,4.27027027027027
7560023,4,B018YGWQH6,"A beautifully shot and constructed film, though there are moments where things fall flat and its easy to lose interest. What fascinated me most about this adaptation was the subtle exploration of PTSD. Have never seen that in any rendition of Macbeth before, as usually the focus is on how Lady Macbeth manipulates her husband and destroys the lives of so many through her ambition. But here, the focus shifts in the way lines are delivered and scenes are formed. Is this for everyone? Probably not. But there are themes and nuances here that I would have loved to explore if I were still a student.",1463097600,,599,4.660377358490566
7560024,2,B018YGWQH6,"I LOVE and am a huge fan of Michael Fassbender's work, and of course love Marion Cotillard in everything I see her in.  And of course, am a HUGE fan of Shakespeare, particularly Macbeth.  So I was extremely excited about this film.  But upon watching it, the first 5 minutes, I was confused-- even knowing the story and having seen it several times, I was confused!  Again, the acting was amazing (though at times I felt the director purposefully had the actors hold back in a few scenes because the whole movie took a monotonous feel), but the directing was questionable.  There were times the cinematic effects were quite fascinating and haunting, but then they would stop and continue with the confusing direction and hold on the actors' expression.  I really wanted to like this film.  But I'm having a hard time deciding whether to keep it on my shelf forever or just give it away as a White Elephant gift for Christmas.",1462924800,2,925,4.638036809815951
7560025,2,B018YGWQH6,"Well, it was gorgeous - but utterly misguided. The actors did everything they could, but everything but the cinematography was against them from the start. Changes sometimes improve a stage play's transition to the screen ... but most of the changes here either served to dumb down or dilute the language, or rendered much of the plot pointless. Example: Macbeth, or rather Lady Macbeth, makes the decision to kill the King /before/ he designates his heir? Ludicrous.

And why were fifty percent of the lines whispered, and another forty spoken just above a whisper? A line like ""Ring the alarum bell"" or ""Turn, hell hound"" is just kind of silly when it's mumbled...

This is not a version of the play for anyone new to Shakespeare - but it's even more not for fans. Maybe on in the background with the sound muted ... that might work ... What a shame.",1462924800,33,852,4.635761589403973
7560026,2,B018YGWQH6,"I am sure that it is a fine film, the production values are certainly of the highest order.  But, the dialog is just too tedious for me.  I have never ""gotten"" Shakespeare and just do not enjoy that type of theater or acting.

I did not agree with a few artistic decisions. But what a dull world if we all thought the same way.  Fassbender can do intoxicated and crazy like he is actually hallucinating.  The cinematography is outstanding.  There seems to be an overlay of color and haze in the battle scenes in stop and gap slow motion.  Just really visually stunning.  The custom design is so authentic, striking, and hopefully Academy Award winning.  Cotillard is so beautiful and youthful looking.  I originally had a hard time digesting her as Lady Macbeth.  In truth, the time period likely did call for young brides.  Harsh as the battle scenes were and the deplorable acts of tyranny; all and all it is amazingly historically accurate.

I was not familiar with the plot even though this is one of the most famous Shakespearian plays. The language in the movie is old scotish english and on top of that it is very artistically worded so it was difficult for me to understand meny of the details but on the contrary it allows the viewer to really experiance this theatrical play as it was truly imagined by Shakespear. The movie is very dark and gory and it fully submerges you in the time period. It is very psychedelic and originally artistic. The director uses a lot of symbolic objects, colors and visuals to implant original ideas trough out the movie. The only thing that did not sit well with me was the fact that a french actrees with a heavy french accent was casted for the role of the native scotish lady Macbeth. She also could not deliver on the havy task of portraying the powerful charecter of lady Macbeth and therefore she felt like out of place in this magnificently artistic work of art of a movie.

The acting is magnificent; the portrayals give the characters realistic emotion, which can be hard for students to envision while reading the play format. The movie plot follows the script very well, and any additions seem to answer questions that my students asked (what happened to Fleance?!?!), etc. It is not too gory or sexually explicit for classroom viewing, but it successfully captures the dark, moody, gritty atmosphere of Macbeth's Scotland. I recommend this movie for both pleasure viewing and classroom supplementation to the play.",1459900800,7,851,5.0
7560059,3,B018YGWQH6,"First, lets briefly outline the plot of Macbeth. This will provide us with context for this review of Justin Kurzels adaptation of the play.
In Macbeth, Shakespeare illustrates two tendencies that are placed in the nature of man. One of these tendencies lifts man to his higher spheres of functioning. The other tendency stoops him down to a kind of low, bestial life. Mans challenge, therefore, is to recognize and follow his attraction to the first tendency and ignore the other one. The constructive force is symbolically represented by King Edward of England. Shakespeare describes King Edward as a healer who has a miraculous power to cure a disease called the evil. The destructive force is represented by Hecate, the goddess of witches. The plot of the play is driven by these two forces. Macbeth is the focal point of their influences. At the beginning, Hecate is upset with the witches because they invested their charms in Macbeth, i.e., a rather weak aspect of Scotland. From Hecates perspective, Macbeth is not vicious enough; he is not able to serve evil efficiently enough. Macbeth can be easily corrupted. However, he is not truly a villain to the extent that, for example, Aaron was in Titus Andronicus. Macbeths loves for his own ends, not for you may spoil Hecates overall objective. Therefore, Hecate tells the witches that she will arrange for Macbeth to come back to them looking for further prophesy. And when he comes, they must summon visions and spirits whose messages will enhance Macbeths viciousness by filling him with a false sense of security and illusionary powers. Hecate uses the Ghost of Banquo to prompt Macbeths return to the witches (Hecate plays the same trick with Hamlet by bringing to Elsinore the Ghost of his father). During their second encounter with Macbeth, the witches show him a procession of crowned kings. The procession of kings serves as a visual reinforcement of their previous warning that it is not Macbeths but Banquos heirs who will be the future kings.
Lady Macbeth lost her baby child from her previous marriage. Macbeth is her second husband. Macbeth suffers from some infirmity (My Lord is often thus, and hath been from his youth, ... the fit is momentary). Lady Macbeth implies that her husbands infirmity affects his manliness (you would be so much more the man). She persuades him to kill King Duncan. Macbeth murders Duncan and seizes the throne for himself. Lady Macbeth is able to control her husband, but she is no match for Hecate. Hecate is more skillful in turning Macbeth into a true villain. Instead of playing on his weaknesses, Hecate achieves her objective by filling him with a false sense of security, because security is mortals chiefest enemy. Macbeth becomes convinced that is non-stoppable in his tyrannical rule over Scotland. He starts to ignore his wifes counsels and begins to act on his own. When Lady Macbeth realizes that she lost control over her husband, she becomes distraught. She commits suicide. It is then that an intervention of the constructive force is needed to save Scotland from total destruction. The constructive impulse is symbolically delivered by ten thousand English soldiers sent to Scotland by King Edward. Macbeth is killed; Scotland is cured from its evil disease.
The above outline of the play is not so obvious. As stated by Herald Bloom, the meanings of Shakespeares plays are beyond ordinary mans comprehension (humankind never will stop catching up to him). Bloom openly admitted that he himself was incapable of grasping Shakespeares message. But Blooms belief is valid only as long as one approaches the plays with a set of preconceived ideas, favourite views or preferred personal opinions. Justin Kurzels adaptation of the play is an example of such a subjective approach. Driven by his desire to make the play relevant to our time, Mr. Kurzel imagined in Macbeths behaviour the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He rearranged and modified the original plot so it would fit into this arbitrarily chosen context. Such a rearrangement required to remove Hecate and King Edward. In this way, the story looses its inner dimension. Furthermore, Macbeth is presented as the father of Ladys Macbeths lost child. This substantially affects the entire dynamics of these two characters and changes the chemistry of their relationship. Consequently, instead of referring to Duncans blood on her hands, Lady Macbeths pivotal Out, damned spot is addressed to the freckled ghost of her child whom she urges to go to bed. To further support his PTSD theme, Mr. Kurzel brings in and slaughters many boy soldiers in the battle scenes. Then, it is not the Birnam Wood that comes to Dunsinane Castle. Instead, Mr. Kurzel sets the Birnam Wood on fire, so the smoke and ashes blowing towards the castle serve as background for a modern-day battlefield. At the end, he adds a scene where Banquos son steals Macbeths sword and runs away with it. In this way the director implies that the witches prophesy comes true and Banquos heir will form a new line of Scottish kings. Such an interpretation of the procession of crowned kings is exactly what the witches wanted Macbeth to believe in. The procession of kings (this scene has been cut-off from the movie) bears as much truth as the witches other prophesies. It is at this point that Mr. Kurzel fell into the witches trap. Lets remember Banquos warning, the instruments of darkness  win us with honest trifles, to betrays in deepest consequence.
Of course, the director has the right to exercise his imagination and present his vision of the play. But the question is: to what degree may a director deform the original story in order to express his own opinion about some non-related but currently pressing problems? Where is the borderline between honest trifles and deepest consequence? Such a judgment cannot be left only to the professional critics. In the case of Kurzals Macbeth, the critics came to the consensus that it was faithful to the source material. Instead, their criticism was focused on technicalities such as the cast, the actors enunciation, their peculiar accents, volumes and tones of their voices, etc., etc. It is up to each individual person to judge the value of this particular adaptation. But in order to make such a judgment, one would have to consider it within the context of deepest consequence, i.e., the original intention of the play.",1459900800,5,6439,4.995344506517691

7560062,3,B018YGWQH6,"I thought the film got off to a fascinating start with the opening scene helping to explain the mental state of the Macbeths and the chaos that would follow. Unfortunately it went downhill after that in many areas.

Locations were a major problem. Duncans visit to Macbeth was not to a castle but a wooden church and some tents. This smacked of cheap British film and lack of budget. Later when Lady Macduff and her children were captured there was no castle again just them running in a wood: budget constraints again? The only major set was Ely cathedral standing in for indoors scenes. That was fine for the coronation as its nave architecture was correct  Romanesque. Using the cathedral as a substitute for a castle was not as successful; such as the scene when a messenger comes to speak to Macbeth who is with retainers at the East End of the cathedral around the high altar that has much later gothic architecture that is elaborate in a way no castle would ever be: it looked ridiculous to me.

I also had issues with some of the scenes especially Lady Macbeth. Her out out damned spot left me bewildered. Her death was even more bizarre with her lying in bed with another woman while the doctor informed Macbeth that she was dead: no dramatic suicide scene for her. For a film that cut so much text and was not particularly long, it felt quite slow at times. Like other commentators, although I am Scottish I also struggled throughout with the mumbled dialogue necessitating sub-titles. This was a real pity as the two leads were very good.

The film did end very well with a fantastic interpretation of Birnam Wood. Apart from being very imaginative it allowed for some fantastic photography, colour and imagery. Just a pity that more of the film was not of this quality.

This was no successor to Polanskis 1971 masterpiece.",1459728000,3,1835,4.651234567901234

Performances are of course top notch, but you would not expect lesser from this cast.  There are a few liberties taken with the script, but it is largely the classic play.

It's hard enough to follow Shakespeare when it is clearly enunciated so to try and follow the plot when the actors whisper their lines is practically impossible. The film could have been better. I suggest they reissue it with a voice over of more clarity.

I don't like the addition of the fourth witch, and I also do not consider, as most do, this drama to have the power and depth of other Shakespearean dramas.  In fact, Macbeth's motives for his crimes are, in my mind at least, questionable in terms of credibility.  This movie does nothing to ameliorate the feeling that Macbeth goes from true blue to lustful killer with little transition time.

7560083,3,B018YGWQH6,"Adapting a play to film is a challenge. Macbeth may be one of the most difficult! Justin Kurzel has given us some stunningly beautiful scenery. The acting is solid, but there does not seem as much directorial emphasis on developing the characters and the resulting tragedy as there is on making the screen look lush. I love Marion Cotillard but, while there is nothing wrong with her acting in this production, she does not yet have the gravitas of a Lady Macbeth that only years can provide. Michael Fassbender gives us a strong, ambitious warrior Macbeth with a few moments of conscience. Sean Harris deserves a special mention as Macduff, whose loyalty to king and country and love of family reads beautifully here. Having said all that, I thought it was an effort worth watching, but I couldn't give it more than 3 stars because overall it did not touch my emotions.",1459296000,,870,4.730263157894737

Michael Fassbender and Marion Coitlard are amazing as Lord and Lady Macbeth, with special mention to Sean Harris' portrayal of Macduff.

This version is much more violent than other versions I have seen, with an emphasis on its usage through the film.

This is not a Royal Shakespeare Company style film (I'm in no way criticising these films, they are wonderful in their own right!!).

Visually stunning and with an enchanting score, the opening scene was gory, brutal, and grim. All that Macbeth should be. The movie, however, strayed vastly from the book, and in doing so desperately tried to mend the plot holes made from going off book through confusing additions. Famous scenes were mended, characters deleted or shoe-horned in, and all the while the movie felt like it lacked several imperative aspects from the play.
The director utilized whispering to over saturation, and the dialogue between two characters consisted of proximity that would make the close-talker from Seinfeld twinge with discomfort. One would wonder if all the characters were hard of hearing with the amount they speak inches away from each other's faces.
The stand outs of the film is the performances and the cinematography. All performances were fantastic, with the stand outs being from the two lead actors: Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotilliard. Both were fantastic, creating an essence of a couple whose blind ambitions drove them to do horrid things. The two do not disappoint, and deliver great performances in an otherwise subpar movie. The cinematography was also great, encapturing the beautiful scenery yet establishing the dark tone of the film.

7560115,2,B018YGWQH6,"Roman Polanski set a high bar with his version of Macbeth, and this film fails to reach it.  The Shakespearian language in Polanski's version sounded natural, as if the characters really meant what they said.  Here, such critical lines as Lady Macbeth's ""O, never shall sun that morrow see!"" are muttered with the same darkly dramatic tone as all the rest, and Macbeth fails to react.  The disconnect between words and action becomes worse as the director experiments with new ways of staging scenes.  Are we really supposed to believe Macbeth and his lady will discuss his first murder while having sex?  Or that Macbeth will just hang out beside the murdered king until found, after he's gone to so much trouble to frame the grooms?  Then there are the set pieces.  Macbeth had a castle, and the king came to sleep there.  In the Polanski film the castle is real, with chickens in the courtyard, dark corridors and a banquet hall.  In this film, apparently all Macbeth can afford is a military field camp with shed-like buildings.

Well, you get the idea.  I didn't stay for the whole film.  Maybe it gets better later on, but if the murder of Duncan is boring, I don't see how the rest of the story could not be.",1459209600,2,1215,4.574074074074074

7560117,5,B018YGWQH6,"Macbeth (2015) is a fascinating portrayal and adaptation of the classic work. The mise-en-sc&egrave;ne delivers on capturing the descent into madness of the characters not only through the spectacular performances from every member of the cast but through expressionistic components in their environment such as variation of light, atmosphere, and the color that fills them both to help the viewer feel what the piece is trying to make you feel. Macbeth (2015) is an immersive experience that not only exposes the audience to beautiful Scottish landscapes and architecture but also to the culture of the time. A clear care in craft is clearly obvious in the overall production design. It reinforced my love for the actors whose work I had been exposed to before and it got me excited for what this visionary director will have in store for art lovers and cinema goers like myself.",1459209600,,880,5.034246575342466

They did not pull it off so I had to turn the movie off after 15 minutes. One of the few examples where it worked was Baz Luhrmann's famous Romeo+Juliet and I think that was due in large part to his highly visual style and the amazing soundtrack for that film. However, here, set against a gritty, realistic style that is all the rage in cinema and TV these days, it falls flat. It's just too dense for visual consumption without accompanying text. I wish they had made this film with modern English or even some form of Middle English that was easier to understand and that would help tell the story more clearly.",1459209600,,779,4.3061224489795915

7560192,2,B018YGWQH6,"If you are a fan of quiet, moody films, this may be for you. As a piece of Shakespeare it really lacks any action, tension, or horror that has been brought to the stage with this play many times. The use of text is minimal. Words are spoken, shots help establish what's going on, but the action and specificity of the words is mostly missing from this production. I was personally disappointed by the concept for the witches, the first major Lady Macbeth monologue, and the murders themselves. When Banquo was alive I thought the actor did a decent job. As for the two leads, I often felt that Marion Cotillard barely understood the depth of what she was saying. And Michael Fassbender, though not offensive in the role, has a surprisingly unearned turn in the banquet scene that bordered on hamming it up. --(sidenote, could Banquo's ghost have been any more mundane?)-- The underscoring is constant and noticeable, and not in a way I find helpful. This is a play with lots of evil, lots of magic, lots of internal and interpersonal conflict, but I don't find this movie did anything but mute all of those things. I do think that if you like Shakespeare on film and it makes you feel like you understand it better because of the imagery, then you may like this movie. But believe me, this play has a LOT more to offer than what this film brought to the story. Good effort as a film. Unsuccessful as a bit of good Shakespeare.",1458864000,3,1426,4.5096525096525095

Look to the quality of the film, not just what you can comprehend. Film is an art form after all. I feel the same people would have rated the Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford poorly for the same reasons this was.

Typically, the depressing Scottish moors and mountains are what you'd expect in this marvelously produced and directed version of the Shakespeare classic. I was relieved that they didn't try to ""modernize"" this version, as they've done with many other Shakespeare plays. The violence of the Dark Ages is delivered with a punch, and Michael Fassbender shines as the thane who became king by having competition murdered. Marion Cotillard gives us a chilling performance as Lady MacBeth, a Dark Ages control freak. Credit is due to the fine supporting cast. The battle scenes are marvelous.

Lady Macbeth was amazing; her facial expressions conveyed more poignantly what lines and lines of dialogue would render far more clumsily.  I liked too how the director made the motivation for her overweening guilt far more complex than the play seems to suggest.  However, I didn't like the 4 witches and a baby thing -- the ""weird sisters"" are supposed to convey the mystery of the fates, and the fates cannot be more than three (past, present, future, and another future???). I understand that plays and movies are different animals, and I can appreciate a director's artistic choices when adapting a play, and I liked many of this director's interpretations.

And I guess I was never very familiar about the story of Macbeth.  I was never a big reader in HS, let alone a Shakespeare fan, so I went into this blind and I was quite surprised at how boring this story was.  My God, the only action was at the beginning and some of that was slo-mo with assumed violence.  From the trailer it looked like the film was going to be another Braveheart.  Well, anyway, I'm sure acting aficionados will eat up Fastbender's performance and what not, but that's not something that usually catches and keeps my attention.  I haven't even finished the film...got another 20 minutes or so to go.  So I don't know if the ending will redeem itself or I'll chalk this up to a waste of my time.

The set and some action scenes are atmospheric and well done. There ends all the truthful positive comments I can make.

Extensive cuts of Shakespeare's language, at the expense of both beauty and plot, take place throughout. Often, the cuts undermine the relationships between the characters the author so cleverly set down. Unlike the characters in the play, these movie imposters do not develop as we move along.

Macbeth (not ""MacBeth"" with a capital B) is Shakespeare's shortest play -- it needs very little cutting.  Following the play in a plodding manner is not desirable, but changes from the script should have a point.

I hate to think of those who will see this movie thinking it has any resemblance to the play. If you want to see a movie of Macbeth, by all means watch the five star version with Patrick Stewart or the old Polanski version -- you can tell those directors and actors actually love Shakespeare.",1457913600,,1060,4.802197802197802

The scenery, battle scenes, and even the acting is reserved and pays homage to its theatrical roots. The only area this affects is, of course, the dialogue. Film allows the actors to be much more hushed or have more authentic accent. The only drawback is that the poetical structure of Shakespeare is written to be spoken to the back rows of a theater. I had to put the subtitles on to make sure I didn't miss anything. Other than that slight detail, I'm glad they chose to keep the original dialogue (although the full play is not portrayed).

7560312,5,B018YGWQH6,"Because I grew up in another country, I have never read Macbeth or other of Shakespeare's works, yet I understood the story and have come to appreciate Shakespeare's talent through this movie. The story captured what some movies are not able to accomplish--to portray the weaknesses and potential for evil in humans without making it only another element of entertainment or on the other extreme, make it preachy. The acting and directorshop of this movie were amazing and tasteful. There were some instances of gore, especially because of the storyline, but in each scene, I felt it was not the highlight in and of itself. Rather, there was a deeper meaning, capturing the reality of violence that we sometimes take for granted in movies, and how that affects people when thought of in real life. In the end, I felt like I had a fuller experience of the complex nature and tendencies of humans. Some reviewers said that they missed much of Shakespeare's prose that were not included in the movie; however, in my opinion, this can just be seen as another medium where despite the limitation of not being able to include all the words, Shakespeare's brilliance still shines in the unfolding of the story. The cast and crew definitely made that possible.",1457827200,,1252,4.855140186915888

7560316,3,B018YGWQH6,"As someone who has spent the last several years teaching Macbeth in a high school classroom (listening to an audio recording of the play three times a day for a month or so, in our consecutive school years),  I was excited to see this latest adaptation of the play. The trailer looked promising and the casting of Fassbender as Macbeth and Cotillard as Lady Macbeth seemed appropriate and interesting. I would hear a release date and then the movie would never appear; months would go by, a new release date mentioned, but eventually it was never released in a theater in my city. For what seemed like such a promising film, I had  to wonder why it wasn't garnering more attention. After finally seeing the film on DVD, I have to admit that I'm not surprised that this film has received mixed reviews.

First, as I know the play very well, I realize I may be nit-picky about cut lines, rearranged scenes, and some creative license taken by the film's director/producers. However, I imagine this film was somewhat difficult to follow for a viewer not familiar with the play. The film retains Shakespeare's language and many scenes basically consist of an actor reciting the famous lines in a scene of moody atmosphere. Often, Shakespeare's films become easier to follow for inexperienced readers through actors' performances and the movement that takes place on stage. With the exception of the battle scenes, most of the film does not add visuals or action that allow the plot or moral dilemmas of the characters to become clearer for the audience. Further, Shakespeare's play is structured so masterfully as to render major changes to the storyline unnecessary. Certain modifications in the film, though, resulted in a dramatization of Macbeth and his wife's psychological breakdowns that is much inferior to that of the original play. For example, the film is framed by the invented story that Macbeth and Lady Macbeth have lost a young son (the son's funeral opens the film). While I don't want to dismiss this move outright because it's possible this could have added an interesting twist to Macbeth's seemingly unfounded ambition, it feels too reductive. The feelings of loss or of guilt that the characters seem to associate with the death of their child (see also Lady M's famous ""Out damn spot"" scene adaption) maybe too easily explain or contribute to their increasing madness. The play, on the other hand, makes it clear that their mental breakdowns are a direct result of their misguided, selfish, and poorly-thought-out (if thought-out at all) actions within the play. Although the movement from thane to king and from sane to mad is quick in Shakespeare's play, the film speeds it up unnecessarily. The contrast, then, between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's characters from beginning to end, is not achieved in the film. In fact, in the film, Macbeth is already so insane when he enters his coronation feast as to be unaware of how unstable he appears to his fellow nobles. The play better develops Macbeth's psychological degradation over the course of the feast scene.

That said, the film does have some strengths. The spare visuals and haunting score are in keeping with the overall feel of the play. The acting  is strong, for the most part. Marion Cotillard makes the Lady Macbeth character somewhat more sympathetic in the film than she appears in the play,  partly because we see her more, as I assume the director did not want to waste Cotillard in what, over the course of the play, becomes an increasingly minor part. It just feels like the film is characterized most by squandered potential in its attempt to provide a fresh take on classic, revered source material.",1457827200,,3687,4.9006410256410255
7560317,4,B018YGWQH6,"Top-notch acting and stark cinematography set the tone for this dark version of Shakespeare's play.  My key quibble with the film was it was often difficult to hear and understand very low-voiced and sometimes mumbled dialog.  I was raising and lowering the volume constantly to try and catch the lines that I know so well.  With the tight scripting and parse sets, I wonder if those not familiar with Macbeth would have understood what was going on.  Not as good as some film versions of ""the Scottish play"" that I have seen but it ranks up there and is far better than most versions.",1457827200,,585,4.596153846153846

7560331,5,B018YGWQH6,"Australian director Justin Kurzel directs Shakespeares magnificent drama (as adapted for the screen by Jacob Koskoff, Michael Lesslie, and Todd Louiso), moves the action outside of the claustrophobia of a stage castle and into the breathtaking majesty of the land of Scotland and the result is an epic film populated with some of our finest actors of the day who are able to deliver Shakespearean poetry with the finest seasoned Shakespeare actors of the day. The result is a dark look at a story we all know and the changes in scenery create a dramatic turn of stance in the way we interpret Shakespeares brilliant drama.

Brief synopsis: Macbeth, the Thane of Glamis, receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders his king and takes the throne for himself. What this quick dollop of a plot synopsis fails to render is the extraordinary altered viewpoint that Macbeth is not simply a ruthless power hungry man driven by his equally power obsessed wife, but instead is a man whose battle time and the mass killings for which he is responsible have created a PTSD personality change that is gripping and very moving to watch his descent into his fate.

Michael Fassbender continues to grow and impress as one of our finest actors of the time and he delivers the poetry of Shakespeare with eloquent and raw dignity. Likewise, Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth is inordinately impressive  a very fine portrayal by an exceptionally gifted actress. The cast is uniformly fine  Paddy Considine as Banquo, Brian Nickels as the Thane of Cawdor, Malcolm as portrayed by Jack Reynor, David Thwelis as Duncan, Sean Harris as Macduff, et al. The glorious cinematography is by Adam Arkapaw and the eerie musical score is by the directors brother, Jed Kurzel.

The only criticism this viewer has is the need for subtitles in order to hear and understand the perfection of Shakespeares words. This likely is the reason this film did not do well in theaters. It should have been considered in almost every category for Oscars and its omission points out the sad state of all award consideration.  Perhaps Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow... A wholly brilliant film. Grady Harp, March 16",1457654400,,2288,4.884020618556701

Some liberties have been taken with the story such as adding a child to the three witches but this is a film after all and it shows the directors ambition to emphasize the supernatural aspect of the story. Both Fassbender as Macbeth and Cotillard as his crime partner are at their best . Wind and dust become extra protagonists adding certain primitive earthly qualities ( like Kurosawa's Mount Fuji sequences ) and the color ranging from burnt sienna to intense brilliant red magnifies the tragic bloody character which is intrinsic to the Bards play , add a phantasmagoric music score which matches perfectly the drama portrayed and you have a very personal new creation of the oeuvre like Roman Polansky 1971 film and Orson

How exactly did they achieve the scene of ""Birnam-Wood-Comes-to-Dunsinane"" when Malcom's forces set the forest ON FIRE??!!  To soothe my offended self and restore my upset memories methinks I shall go now and rent me the Jon Finch movie.",1457395200,2,1043,5.046783625730995

7560382,5,B018YGWQH6,"Powerful !  Read this in 9th grade and was spellbound then.  Never saw a movie of Macbeth ... this captured the genius of the play in so many ways.  Not easy to understand all the dialogue, but when is Shakespeare's dialogue easy to understand in these times ?  The ""tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow"" soliloquy brought tears to my eyes ... Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
 Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
 To the last syllable of recorded time,
 And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
 The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
 Lifes but a walking shadow, a poor player
 That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
 And then is heard no more: it is a tale
 Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
 Signifying nothing.",1457395200,,749,4.419117647058823
7560383,5,B018YGWQH6,"I found this version of Macbeth thought-provoking, days after seeing it memories of certain scenes would come into my mind, not for their gore which wasn't over-bearing, but for their beauty and simplicity; I wished it wasn't one of Shakespeare's shortest plays.

7560386,5,B018YGWQH6,"Mesmerizing, certainly have never seen a Macbeth like this. The mood and pacing are outstanding.  Fassbender is some one i've been slow to admire, but his performances are just consistently superb. While I never would have imagined him as Macbeth, this version is going to be the one that sticks with me.  Lady Macbeth suddenly becomes easy to empathize with, when viewed from the angle of a bereaved mother dealing with a sword-shocked spouse, Marion Cotillard always luminous, even when beset by personal demons.  One of the most worthwhile Shakespeare adaptations in recent memory.  Will most certainly be watching Justin Kurzel's career from this point on. Also impressed by the weird sisters being portrayed in exquisite eerie-ness, instead of the repulsive hags we've been conditioned to expect, a nice touch which enhanced the overall tone of the piece.",1457308800,,860,5.2101449275362315

The film itself was nicely done. One way to take up space, save money and extend a scene is to do it in slow motion. Hope you like slo-mo because you will get a lot of it with this movie. I've watched a lot of movies with battle scenes, blood and gore...I can't say that I've seen many others in super slo-mo. It was actually a bit annoying.

The actors were superb considering they were quoting Shakespeare. The child actors were phenomenal!

7560496,3,B018YGWQH6,"Macbeth stars Michael Fassbender (Steve Jobs, 12 Years a Slave) as Shakespeares tragic hero  the thane of Cawdor and would-be king. Loyal to King Duncan (David Thewlis), whose enemies are in striking distance of dethroning him, Macbeth has one final chance to turn the tide in favor of his liege. The decisive battle occurs both in real time and in slow motion and it is bloody, brutal, and intense. Macbeth distinguishes himself as a relentless warrior.

After he dispatches the last of his foes, a trio of witches prophesies that Macbeth will be king. Unanswered are the how and why.

Australian director Justin Kurzel opens with Macbeth and Lady Macbeth (Marion Cotillard) looking on sadly as their young child is laid to rest. This scene puts a different slant on Macbeth. He is no longer merely power hungry or easily swayed by his ambitious wife. Now, he is a man crippled by mourning and likely suffering from battle stress. This is not in the original, but provides Macbeth with another reason for the course of action he will pursue.

Both Fassbender and Cotillard are excellent leads. The production itself is troublesome. Sometimes director Kurzel creates elaborate, visually strong sequences such as the opening battle scene. Other times, however, the scenes seen too muted and underplayed. The witches, for example, appear fairly tame, almost as if they were following a manual of polite behavior. This decision deprives what should be a great moment in the film of the proper dramatic emphasis. Lady Macbeth is portrayed more sympathetically than is customary, which humanizes her but dilutes her  thirst for power.

Movie adaptations of Macbeth have been made by Orson Welles, Akira Kurosawa, Roman Polanski, and Trevor Nunn, among others. Kurzels version is about average. Its frustrating that the actors deliver their lines under their breath or even in whispers. With Shakespearian language, we shouldnt have to acclimate our ear to the Bards cadences and struggle to hear whats being said.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a making-of featuette and a Q & A with Michael Fassbender.",1457136000,,2112,5.086705202312139

After a highly stylized battle scene and some hideously sing-song dialog from the witches, the thing bumbles its way through costumes and real authentic Scottish fog to try and create the appropriate feeling. It might have worked too if they hadn't butchered the play and walked all over the dialog while doing so. The ""unsex me here"" speech was so uninspired and mumbled, I just couldn't watch anymore. I wonder if the director meant to box her in to the cliched way she came off as. It's so sad. Fassbender seemed intense and watchable, but I couldn't hear him. And the casting for King Duncan was great, but I could barely hear him either. I would definitely be willing to see this if it was done as a one- or two-man show with a megaphone.

With a Shakespeare film adaptation, the pleasure is often in seeing how a screenwriter and director can change the meaning of a scene simply by changing what the characters are doing at the moment. The dialogue, Shakespeare's own, is unchanged, but because the externals are different, something else entirely comes out. That's the case here at several points - see especially Macbeth's speech to Malcolm, just after Duncan's murder, and the new spin on Lady Macbeth's words ""to bed, to bed.""

Cotillard, as Lady Macbeth, is the standout here, I'd also add, though everyone else is quite good. My one quibble is that it can be difficult to tell a lot of the men apart. This is a gritty, historical Macbeth, and most of the male adults are all beards, blood and mud.

7560577,3,B018YGWQH6,"From a historic standpoint a very interesting rendering, with the backdrop and surroundings probably a great deal closer to what Scotland looked like in Macbeth's time than the fanciful portrayals of the 19th and 20th centuries -- and the characters' perpetually unbathed appearance as well as the heads of traitors and others being tossed about both add some visual impact and credibility).  The characters are all physically attractive, and their portrayals are appealing from a human perspective.  No bad acting or hams eating the stage (see Polanski's Macbeth for comparison).  Some good inventive touches -- the Macbeths' dead child was not in any version I've seen, and provides some background rationale for Lady Macbeth's insanity.  The only reason for a three and not a four-star rating is the difficulty in following the occasionally mumbled lines.  There was some liberty taken with the order of events and scenes, but they actually made the play flow better (""Heresy!"" some will shout); however, when I tried to compensate for the mumbling by following from text, i could not do so because the scenes were not in the original order.

In an attempt to modernize the story the big emphasis is on visual style and while capturing ones attention at first the film soon becomes weary and boring.  Things have come full circle and now Shakespeare is copying Kurosawa.  But while ""Throne of Blood"" can pass for an action film this film falls flat.  This version of Macbeth is like a cheap, frozen TV dinner.  The mush you end up with fails to match the promise of the visually sumptuous photo you saw on the cover.  This film's pacing is like a slow slog through a boggy Scottish marsh despite attempts to spice it up with good ol' sex and violence.  Dialog is sparse but heavy handed and delivered at a snails pace.  Lady Macbeth  gets a short shrift despite her essential role and her part is played as if she's sleepwalking.

7560629,4,B018YGWQH6,"It would be hard to think of an actor better-suited to play Macbeth than Michael Fassbender -- he can look sad-eyed and gentle, but his angular face and wide mouth are equally well-suited to grins of evil or madness.

So I had nothing but eagerness to see ""Macbeth,"" an adaptation of Shakespeare's mighty tragedy about a good man slowly corrupted into murderous evil. Up-and-coming Australian director Justin Kurzel gives the ""Scottish play"" a distinctly Scottish air, with plenty of misty grey highlands and cold candlelit buildings, although the hinted ""explanation"" for the Macbeths' slow descent into madness and murder feels a bit like a cop-out.

Shortly after a victory in battle, Macbeth (Fassbender) and his friend Banquo (Paddy Considine) are traveling home across a heath when they encounter three witches -- who greet them with shocking news. According to them, Macbeth will be the Thane of Cawdor (something he initially doesn't believe) and then the he ""shalt be king hereafter!"" So when MacBeth is unexpectedly made Thane of Cawdor, he naturally begins to think that being king might be next in line.

As these thoughts worm into his head, King Duncan (David Thewlis) has the poor timing to come stay for a visit, and declare his son Malcolm (Jack Reynor) his heir. As he struggles with temptation, Lady MacBeth (Marion Cotillard) goads her husband into murdering the king and framing a couple of innocent servants for the deed. As the witches predicted, MacBeth becomes king of Scotland.

But the witches also prophesied that Banquo would be the father of kings, so MacBeth starts tying off loose ends by hiring assassins to kill Banquo and his young son, as well as a wily thane named MacDuff (Sean Harris) and all of his family. But though MacBeth believes himself to be safe from everyone, his fear begins to grow as madness and guilt torment him and his wife -- and what he thinks could never happen may come to pass.

Kurzel's ""Macbeth"" attempts to give a historical sheen to Shakespeare's very unhistorical tale -- he sets it in a very medieval world of cold wooden houses barely lit by candlelight, shadowed forests, rough-woven cloth, foggy heaths, and grey skies. It's a dark and misty tale, perpetually stuck at twilight and full of shadows that cling to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth like so many demons. For the time period it's set in, it's probably the most realistic depiction of medieval Scotland ever to grace Shakespeare's play.

As a result, it probably won't be for everyone -- the grey murky skies can be rather depressing, and the night scenes can be difficult to see clearly. But it helps highlight the gravity and tragedy of the story. A cloud of dread hangs over almost every scene, and Kurzel often drifts into slow-motion and silence during important scenes (the stabbing, the icily-lit coronation), giving the proceedings a strangely nightmarish quality. Some scenes are more nightmarish for their realism (the murder of Banquo while his sobbing son watches), while others for their surreality (Macbeth seeing the slain walking past him).

Fassbender is absolutely perfect as Macbeth, and it's clear he was throwing every ounce of his considerable talent into the role -- he inspires our sympathy with his grave, tragic mien at the story's beginning, but slowly grows more wild-eyed, frenetic and outright CRAZY as the story rolls on. By the time Macbeth declares,""How full of scorpions is my mind,"" it's pretty clear that madness is eating away at him... which isn't surprising, since he spends most of that scene holding a knife on his wife.

Marion Cotillard isn't quite the powerhouse that Fassbender is here, but she gives a steely, intense performance as Lady Macbeth, implied to be a woman so wracked by grief and dark anger that she is pouring her maternal drive into seeking the throne. When she isn't trying to get her husband to stop acting like a freak, she berates his manhood. And they have a solid backing cast of experienced actors giving grave, strong performances, including Thewlis, Considine, Harris and Reynor.

The biggest problem is perhaps the odd subplot involving the death of the Macbeths' child, which seems to be suggested as the motivation for their actions. It does give new dimensions to Lady Macbeth's musings on womanhood, but it feels like Kurzel is shying away from the central theme of the play -- that any good, noble man could become a corrupt monster if he gives into temptation.

With the exception of that subplot, ""Macbeth"" is a haunting, shadowy adaptation of Shakespeare's great play, and is worth seeing alone for the powerful, rich performance that Fassbender graces us with. A beautiful and rich film, but not always an easy one to watch.",1456617600,,4725,4.954545454545454

7560718,2,B018YGWQH6,"So...sadly, very, very sadly...the film we've been waiting so long to see was a horrible disappointment.

The new film version of Macbeth, with Michael Fassbender in the lead role and Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth, had such hype in our household. And we sought long and hard to find it in the theatres; alas, to no avail...until Amazon Prime put it up just this past week.

THE GOOD: The cinematography was absolutely stunning. I had no idea the British Isles could look like THAT. The epic wide shots of fen, moor, and snow-capped peaks were as impressive as the shots of dune and desert in Laurence of Arabia.

The sets were incredible too. It was definitely more of a small, regional chiefdoom look, rather than a lush kingdom. It was dirty, raw, wet, and rotting: all wood and vegetation and rope and mud. Once Macbeth was crowned king though, we moved to Dunsinane, into an enormous medieval castle. The tonal shift was jarring and it worked.

THE BAD: The acting! Oh, good God, the acting! Everyone--EVERYONE!--had the ""whispering intensity."" No dynamic range. Everyone--women included--had the same gruff, whispering tone. It ended up feeling lifeless and dull. And most sad of all...it was utterly humorless. (There's a great reason to keep the Porter scene that opens Act 2, Scene 3.)

The costumes were monochromatic and boring. Everyone looked the same...so much so that it was hard to tell characters apart.
After the coronation, the movie DID get a little better, in terms of acting. The character of Macduff was a highlight in a sea of grimdark gloomy darkness, but even he succumbed to the ""whispering intensity"" in the end.

Also, the final battle was done in nothing but orange and blacks. There was not enough contrast to see everything that was going on. AND what should've been an epic sword-fight with a great ending turned into an epic sword-fight with a lackluster conclusion.
So disappointed with this production...",1456531200,19,1942,4.92354740061162

This guy's acting makes Christian Bale's Batman seem awesome and original. Cotillard had a much better grasp of her character's dramatic conflict than Fassbender did, but her good performance and the excellent cinematography was inevitably overshadowed by Fassbender's grunt-inspired American Soldier MacBeth .

Seriously 90% of this film is done in a whispery rasp by Fassbender and everyone else.  It's hard enough to follow Shakespeare in a decent tone with strong inflection,  but this was abysmal,  ruined it for me.  I looked forward to this for months but could barely understand a word spoken.  Acting and scenery were fine,  directors script additions were acceptable,  but without a very thorough previous understanding of the play it will make zero sense to anyone,-which i had,  and it still didn't really make much sense.

7560778,3,B018YGWQH6,"The cinematography on this production,and certainly the costumes, were fabulous and the actors were first rate. However, the Scottish play is Shakespeare. And because it is Shakespeare the lines need to be spoken clearly... because it's all about the language, people. This performance brought the viewer the ominous deathly atmosphere, the brooding monotone music, the talented actors, dramatic close-ups, soulful gazing into the camera.... but every time the beautiful words were spoken they were mumbled, whispered, or spoken with such a high Scottish brogue that they were unintelligible.

But the two big problems are a) the hoarse whispers throughout, kind of like Batman reciting all the lines, and b) the brutal chopping up of the text. Try the Polanski version instead.",1455667200,9,328,4.39344262295082
7560780,4,B018YGWQH6,"Michael Fassbender plays the mentally deteriorating Thane of Glamis, who is told by three witches that his destiny lies in becoming the Scottish King, in Shakespeares classic play of corruption, greed and blood letting. Marion Cotillard plays his wife the Lady Macbeth in a role where she puts in a fair amount of passion.

This is directed by the extremely talented  and original  Justin Kurzel  who brought us The Snowtown Murders. The battle scenes are a work of art and the themes of stylish horror (almost) are kept going through out the film. The plays real strengths though are the verse in which it is delivered and so Shakespeare purists will not be pleased with some of the treatment seeing The Bard as sacred. I was only let down by the whispered lines that I had to strain to hear. The acting though was all excellent and almost painful to watch which is the point here.

It is though not easy watching and requires full commitment. This could have been better but it is still an endeavour worth praise and it is worth a viewing if only for the great acting and the stunning cinematography.",1455580800,3,1102,4.630769230769231
7560781,5,B018YGWQH6,"While this adaptation of the play takes some serious liberties, every change has a purpose and actually makes sense. These changes will leave those familiar with the play thinking; it's almost as if you're playing a game of chess with the director as you try to figure out why he has made each change and what each one means for the production as a whole. The questions left unanswered by the play (""I have given suck..."", yet the Macbeths are childless and the question of how Banquo's sons will be kings if the throne has been restored to Duncan's bloodline) are attended to with insight and creativity (and even a bit of sophisticated creepiness at the end). The acting is purposefully human, rendering the unreal real, and the over-acting of Lady Macbeths of the past is a welcome omission. I am pretty sure my boyfriend Will Shakespeare would be pleased that someone finally took the time to read carefully and ponder deeply the complexities of this little play before filming it.",1455494400,,985,4.766081871345029
7560782,3,B018YGWQH6,"An updated telling of 'Shakespeare's' classic-tale 'Macbeth' and almost certainly not one for the purists...
As others have pointed out the film does drift some from the Bard's writings, though most will have been pleased with the
opening sequences.
In the mist of battle 'Macbeth' (Michael Fassbender) encounters three Witches who foretell that he would one day be King.
The ambitious 'Macbeth' some while after returning home to his wife Lady Macbeth (Marion Cotillard) does indeed become
King after murdering King Duncan (David Thewlis)
Racked with guilt of his reign it becomes increasingly marked with bloodshed as he drifts toward madness seeing images of
those he had ordered killed and those that had fallen in battle.
His wife equally to blame as he turns upon those he once called friend a path that would almost certainly lead to his own downfall.
Must admit i did enjoy this more than i expected, the trailer drew me in some while back....
The writings of Shakespeare' of course has many fans and followers World-Wide, though i have to admit i am not one of them in
truth, i remember dreading Literature Lessons during my years at school, i remember having to read passages to the class from
his works, and indeed having to write compositions on what we had learnt from reading his books, i must have taken note as my
marks on the subject were indeed good from memory, though to this day my thoughts on Shakespeare's writings remain the same.
However, this adaptation of Macbeth is in my view highly watchable.....the haunting images, the cinematic presentation, the glorious
rugged scenery, the atmospheric score .....all contributing to the spectacle.
If i had to pick out the one outstanding performance in the film it would be that of 'Marion Cotillard' in the role of Lady Macbeth.
Everybody i'm sure will have different takes on the film after watching.

Lady Macbeth",1454457600,,2013,4.976261127596439
7560783,1,B018YGWQH6,"For a play as well known as Macbeth, its surprising that there haven't been many film adaptations. Theres Roman Polanskis 1971 film, with Jon Finch in the lead role and Francesca Annis as Lady Macbeth. Theres Orson Wells 1948 version, with himself as Macbeth, and Jeanette Nolan as his Lady. And there are several low-budget versions which remain shrouded in the Scottish fog. (Theres also a little-known 2005 TV movie, made for the BBC as part of a series called ShakespeaRe-Told, starring James McAvoy and Keeley Hawes. This adaptation sets the story in a three-star restaurant, and is definitely worth seeing.)

But Macbeth is quite fitting for todays audiences. Taking visual cues from Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings, this new film directed by Justin Kurzel, and starring Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, throws itself whole-heartedly into the land and the atmosphere of Scotland. There are barren heaths, bogs, foggy landscapes, and thick brogues.

Unfortunately, theres not much Shakespeare in this film.

At less than two hours, with a number of battle scenes, and graphic violence, theres not a lot of time for the original text. Id estimate that half the text has been butchered, as violently as Duncan early in the film. As such, its very hard to understand whats happening, even who the characters are, if you're not intimately familiar with the story.

Its easy to summarize Macbeth, and a Monty Python sketch could have done so as follows. Some witches tell Macbeth hell be king, so he, prodded by his wife, kills Duncan (the current king) and takes the throne. But he has regrets; hes obsessed by the prophecies of the witches, which also say that Banquo will be the father of future kings. This also leads Macbeth to have Banquo and his children killed, but he cant face the truth of what he does. In the end, he goes the way of all the heroes of Shakespeares tragedies. He, too, is slain, and Malcolm, Duncans son, takes the throne.

Thats about as much Shakespeare as we get in this film. Visually, the film is stunning, reminding me, at times, of Tarkovskys beautiful landscapes. Using a great deal of natural light, both indoors and out, the film is dark and dismal, with droning chromatic music that makes the viewer uncomfortable. The violence is Sam Peckinpah-like, with blood squirting in slow motion, and the overall feeling of the film is that of darkness, of a no-future society. (Its interesting to note that the clips shown on TV are brightened compared to what I saw in a movie theater, and many of the stills on websites are also brightened.)

The play opens with a scene not that is not in the play, but that is essential to understanding Lady Macbeth. We see her and Macbeth at their childs funeral. This is somehow intended to show that Macbeths rage and desire for power is perhaps based on the fact that he has no children.

But this is more or less forgotten as the movie goes ahead; or, rather, theres no time to take it into account. Focusing so much on the atmosphere takes away from the story. It seems that Kurzel felt that the most important element of this story was the battle that Macbeth won, which, in the play, takes place just before action begins on stage. Fassbender has said that he played the part as a man with PTSD as a result of that battle. As such, Kurzel ignores the real motivations of Macbeth, and especially of Lady Macbeth, whose role in her husbands downfall is one of the key elements of the play. Lady Macbeth becomes just a prop, with little place in the story.

One of the biggest problems in this film is the dialogue. Much of it is overdubbed in post-production, and theres little ambient sound. The characters speak, for the most part, very softly, but their voices are amplified. As such, its very hard to understand what they're saying; even more so with the thick brogues that some of the characters use. I thought at first that this was a directorial choice, but the reason may be one of practicality. In an interview on BBC News yesterday, Michael Fassbender explained how cold and windy it was when they were filming the play in Scotland. If the wind made it impossible to record dialog during filming, this explains why the voices weren't recorded during filming in many of the scenes, but the option of re-recording the dialogue would have allowed for more normal voices. Kurzel chose to have characters croak and whisper, and this takes away much of the plot, as you really don't know what the characters are saying much of the time.

This is a tedious film, with a story thats hard to follow even if you do know the play. It is visually stunning, but it comes off more as an exercise than an attempt to tell Shakespeares story. The director was so obsessed with the way the film looks that he forgot the story. Its Shakespeare for the Game of Thrones age. But Game of Thrones is a lot more interesting.",1454284800,26,4898,4.672853828306264
7560784,5,B018YGWQH6,"MacBeth kills the king, becomes king and can't handle the guilt. Blood imagery, darkness, and a ghost if I recall my High School British Literature class of 1972.

The Shakespearean masterpiece has been made into a modern action film, making me think this was one of the first cabin-in-the -woods slashers. I loved the acting, the cinematography (even when the sun was glaring on the lens) and the scenery. Marion Cotillard ending soliloquy had me lighting Bics and tossing Frisbees. She was that good.  Fassbender did a heck of a job nailing a king crazed with guilt. The three ""witches"" from the play appear to be ""fates"" in the film which worked out nicely. Yes, much has been cut out.

I was glued to the screen as I did not want to miss a word, because at times it was hard to understand what they were saying between accents and hithers. At times I felt I was watching art. I would be surprised if this was not nominated a number of Golden Globes or Oscars.

Guide: No nudity. Clothed above the waist sex scene. IMDB claims there is absolutely no swearing...except for that one ""damn"" word. Now I did hear something that sounded like ""skull f--- me thunder."" I don't think that is what MacBeth said to his wife, but it just sounded that way. Could someone toss me a bone on that one?",1454284800,3,1289,4.495726495726496
7560785,3,B018YGWQH6,"""It is a tale, told by an idiot. Full of sound and fury. Signifying nothing."" Macbeth (Fassbender) is a soldier who has just been told by a trio of witches that one day he will become king. This becomes the only thought in his mind and when he talks with his wife (Cotillard) he fulfills his own prophecy by killing the king. I have to start by admitting I am not a Shakespeare fan at all. I can't really even explain why but there is just something about his stories that I do not connect with. This one is no different. The acting is great and the plot is very interesting and exciting but I really struggled to get into it. Fans of Shakespeare will love this, as for me, like most other things done by him I found it hard to get involved with and my mind really began to wander. Overall, a good movie, just not for me. I give this a B-.",1454198400,,839,4.090909090909091
7560786,5,B018YGWQH6,"Incredible acting, direction, cinematography, and so much more. This is a decidedly more bloody, violent and visceral version of Macbeth than many have ever seen, yet the violence can seem justified and even quite striking when taken in the context of the film's interpretation of this classic play. I will not soon forget the scene missing from virtually every other interpretation of this story: The actual murder of the king.  It is haunting, shocking, and deeply compelling, and thus for the rest of the story you truly believe Macbeth's despair and descent in a way never before captured.
For me, the best scene Shakespeare ever wrote in terms of potential and sheer emotional weight is the banquet scene where Banquo's ghost appears, and here it is truly a scene to cherish and be haunted by.
I would give it six stars if I could. Cinematic genius.",1453420800,2,854,4.8493150684931505
7560787,2,B018YGWQH6,"I was very excited to see this movie when the movie trailers came out; I'm a life long fan of the Bard and the Scottish Play is one of my favorites. Other reviewers note the great acting and cinematography but what they don't mention is all of Shakespeare's words that were eliminated. None of the cauldron speeches, no keeper of Hellgate, etc. The parade of kings is almost non-existent and Banquo's ghost at the table is muddled. I removed the disk from my shopping list.

In short I am quite disappointed with this production.",1451260800,9,529,4.627659574468085
7560788,3,B018YGWQH6,"Justin Kurtzel, the Australian director of Snowtown, tries to predetermine the Macbeths unassuagable grief for a dead child becoming vaulting ambition, with them burying a dead child at the solemn start of the film, without embedding this in the drama. Macbeth goes onto burn later on McDuffs children and wife with his own hands. Fassbender and Cotillard are stars with charisma on screen,there are many close ups of their sexual chemistry. The Scottish landscape is a key player in this moody drama, one of harsh exteriors,foggy,cold,bleak,dank, containing the shimmer of violence. This approach is very much an invention, cutting the text to 25%: a warrior Macbeth with PTSD.

Macbeth and Banquo encounter 3 witches after putting down the uprising against Duncan (Thewlis),who predict that Macbeth will become King. The Macbeths decide to murder Duncan. Cotillards Lady Macbeth is played with reigned-in delicacy, invoking spirits before candle-lit pictures, she seems to be withdrawn., sidelined. The battle scenes are like a slowed-down slaughterhouse ( a nod to Welless Chimes at Midnight?) with hack-and-slash, interspersed with a roaring tumult. The supernatural elements are down-played, so the witches are very real, appearing out of the mist or as quiet observers at a funeral or appearing at moments of crisis; similarly the spectral dagger is held by the dead boy from the battlefield, who is swallowed by the smoke. Banquos ghost is a living presence at the banquet among the guests.

Kurtzel gets the Scottish-accented cast to mutter rather than declaim, he wants the verse to arise out of the context it is in. But what is apparent is that the meaning of the verse is lost in the fog of the film, whose visuals are superb:the camera sways, as if blown by the wind in an unstable world. If you are aware of the Welless version or Polankis, you will feel sorely let down. Usually verse taps into the inner lives of the characters, as it maintains the thrilling momentum, but here you get Fassbender reaching for the gestures of sociopathy, giggling, brooding,grinning. Go with a good memory of the text or you will be confused what they are saying. That could send you to sleep. The give-away is based on Shakespeares Macbeth,gutted. No energy,no flow,charismatic style over substance, where were the words and poetry?",1450396800,4,2332,5.118110236220472
7560789,5,B018YGWQH6,"This is hands down my favorite movie of 2015. I saw it twice on its opening weekend at the local cinema. Everything from the acting to the eerie and haunting soundtrack to the cinematography is amazing. You could literally pause this movie at any point and the screenshot would make for a terrific poster. The soundtrack really adds to the overall atmosphere of the film, which is as bleak and grim as anything I've seen in a long time. The acting is what really solidifies this film, however. Michael Fassbender (Macbeth) and Marion Cottilard (Lady Macbeth) should simply be handed Academy Awards for Best Actor / Actress. It has been a long time since I've seen acting of this caliber on the big screen. Watching Macbeth's deterioration from a once-honorable and respected warrior to a man whose overly ambitious actions drive him beyond guilt into paranoia and madness is astonishing. Equally astonishing is Lady Macbeth's gradual fall from wretched co-conspirator (she feeds the poison into her husband's mind) to witnessing the manifestation of the monster she helped to create and the guilt that follows. Her ""Out Damn Spot"" soliloquy might be my favorite scene of the whole movie. Macbeth and Lady Macbeth have often been portrayed as unforgivable soulless monsters. This interpretation of the film portrays the two main characters not as soulless, but as tortured souls that have transgressed beyond any redemption.

If you aren't familiar with the story, this is the plot of Macbeth in a nutshell: upon achieving a great victory in battle, a warrior is told by three witches that he will become the king of Scotland. Macbeth tells his wife what the witches told him, and she becomes hell bent on seeing the prophecy through. She is determined that the best opportunity for her husband to become king is to kill the king while he sleeps under their roof. From the moment they plot to kill the king, everything- including his sanity- begins to unravel.

While I would give this movie six stars if I could, I do urge that Macbeth is not for everybody. This is not a film intended to win the hearts of mainstream audiences. The first time I saw it, some people got up and walked out. The second time I saw it, someone booed at the end. There was no applause at the end of either viewing. While the music and cinematography are breathtaking, if you don't particularly enjoy Shakespeare because of the difficulty understanding the poetic language, then be forewarned. While there is plenty of violence in this move, there are long scenes of dialogue and quiet self reflection (soliloquies) that can make the film hard to follow and thus boring.

The language is meant to invoke questions about the meaning of evil, predestination and free will while focusing on the isolation and meaninglessness that result from cruelty and selfishness: a true fan of Shakespeare would argue that the language is a type of cinematography (so to speak) all it's own.

If you are not familiar with Macbeth and do not particularly enjoy Shakespeare, I'd think twice before seeing this movie. However, because the movie is so amazingly realized, I suggest picking up a copy of ""No Fear Shakespeare Macbeth"" (it has the original Shakespearean verse on one page and a modern interpretation on the page next to it so you can easily translate the meaning). Once you read through it, then I highly recommend seeing the movie. There's a reason why Macbeth has been re-told for over 400 years after being written: it IS just that good. This is Game of Thrones before there was Game of Thrones.",1450051200,162,3569,4.845901639344262
7560790,4,B018YGWQH6,"""MacBeth"" (2015 release; 113 min.) is the latest big screen adaptation of the William Shakespeare play. As the movie opens, we see a small child's funeral (turns out to be the child of MacBeth). After the opening credits, we are given a very brief synopsis as to the overall situation, with MacBeth being loyal to the King, and it's not long thereafter that MacBeth leads the troops in a decisive battle. Meanwhile, we get to know Lady MacBeth, who has grander plans for her husband. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie version of the famed Shakespeare play is directed by little know Australian director Justin Kurzel (his brother Jed composes an outstanding orchestral score, and I noticed in the movie's end credits that Justin is credited with playing the drums in the score). Kurzel gives us a very stylish and visual interpretation of the play, with stunning photography from start to finish, pure eye-candy, The early battle scene is nothing short of epic, with at times ultra slow-motion photography for further effect. Michael Fassbender, whom we just saw recently as Steve Jobs, now incarnates MacBeth, and he brings a heartfelt performance. Is there anything this guy can't do? His list of recent performances is nothing short of daunting (MacBeth, Steve Jobs, Frank, 12 Years A Slave, Shame, and of course X-Men). He is one of this generation's leading actors, period. The minute Lady MacBeth comes onto the screen, I thought to myself 'this face is familiar'. It wasn't until 10 or 15 minutes later that I suddently realized ""holy cow, it is Marion Cottilard!"". She plays Lady MacBeth without any trace whatsoever of a French accent, in perfect English. It is nothing short of stunning to see her incorporate Lady MacBeth (check out her monologue late into the movie, as she is tortured with guilt and shame, it will leave you in tears). Speaking of language: it took me a good 10-15 minutes to get used to the early 17th century English language of Shakespeare's era, and even then, I will readily admit that quite a few of the lines simply bypassed me. If the DVD version comes with subtitles, you probably will want to take advantage of that. The movie was shot on location in England and Scotland. Have the Scottish highlands looked ever more beautiful? And the use of the spectecular Banburgh Castle will leave you in awe. Bottom line: eve if you are not a fan of Shakespeare as such, you will likely be taken in by this latest adaptation, if nothing else by the photography and the lead performances from Fassbender and Cotillard.

""MacBeth"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early evening screening where I saw this at on Friday evening was attended quite well, frankly to my surprise, as I had figured that demand for this kind of movie would be limited. But I'm glad that I was wrong on that account. If you are in the mood for a highly stylish interpretation of ""MacBeth"" that features stunning performances from the lead actor and actress, you cannot go wrong with this. ""MacBeth"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1449878400,49,3176,4.815018315018315

8743372,1,B018YGWQH6,"Despite beautiful on-site footage in Scotland, this production suffered from unconvincing acting and puzzling alterations to the text.

I find Macbeth to be one of Shakespeare's most accessible tragedies, but this version would be difficult to follow for any newcomer to the show. The actors mutter most of the lines in monotone, without reacting to anything that's happening (for example, Macbeth doesn't register any shock at seeing a hallucination of a bloody dagger just before murdering Duncan). The only character who shows any emotion is Macduff, who at least managed to ""feel it like a man"".

Other disappointments--removing the necessary comic relief of the drunken porter, cutting the humanizing dialogue with Macduff's family before they're murdered, mostly eliminating the supernatural aspect of the witches, no ""double double toil and trouble""--etc.

Another puzzling choice was the attempt to turn some of the soliloquies into dialogue, which really alters Lady Macbeth's relationship with her husband and removes any motivation for her eventual madness.

Given that there are so many film versions of Macbeth available on Amazon, I'd highly recommend starting with one of the other ones that do less violence to the text.",1530403200,6,1236,5.455497382198953
