8590402,5,B00D7IHMQ2,"I love this film. It takes the audience thru three different stories but one ending. The underlying theme is letting go. If we could all let go, anything would be possible.",1422748800,3,172,4.580645161290323
8590403,4,B00D7IHMQ2,"First off, I want to let you know that, when I went to post my review of this French language comedy, the first title that came up was a COMPLETELY different American film with the exact same title! When I saw mention of a ""faith-based"" movie I knew I was in the wrong place. I found it - and posting here - but just want to alert others. (The other film even has the same THREE dots between ""If"" and ""?"".)

Now to the DVD - I see my fellow Amazon reviewer Charles Ashbacher as provided lots of details about the plot and characters of this 2008 French comedy.. I won't repeat those and may even suggest that the less you know the better. What you do need to know going in (or you will be thoroughly confused IMHO) is that Director Lea Fazar is playing with both ""options"" and ""time"".  Every story can have two different outcomes depending on which ""path"" the screenwriter takes. In this short 84-minute film, we see both paths. As events happen we are shown what would happen ""if"" a man got a job to what would happen ""if"" a woman got the position. And so the outcomes are presented first as ""he gets it"", then ""she gets it"", ""then  he gets it"", then ""she gets it"" and so on.

I did enjoy the story and certainly the actors ( Alice Taglioni is simply a ravenous beauty). But I can't honestly say I LOVED it.  One thing that I did LOVE - and deserves special mention - are the subtitles. They are large (in BOLD white typeface) and are ALWAYS fully readable on the screen. So many films have subtitles that blend with the background and are tiny. Kudos to First Run Features for this extra touch!
There are no special features on the DVD (which comes in an eco-friendly cardboard package) - not even a trailer. . There are trailers for other FRF releases.

If you like contemporary French film comedies, I think you'll like this one.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
