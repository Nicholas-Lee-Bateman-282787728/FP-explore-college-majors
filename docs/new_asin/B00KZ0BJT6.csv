8662759,2,B00KZ0BJT6,"My wife (who is Russian) and I bought this for our son who will be brought up bilingual and it reminds her of home.  We assumed it had English subtitles but there is only an English translation of a few of the cartoons on the cover, that is the only English involved.  They also have a very bizarre 40s era stop motion animation video that is not listed and is in such poor quality, even my wife could not understand what the characters were saying.  Either non Russian speaking people slapped this DVD together without knowing much about what they were doing or its just a subpar production, either way the cartoons we actually bought the DVD for were excellent.",1451606400,,663,4.508333333333334
