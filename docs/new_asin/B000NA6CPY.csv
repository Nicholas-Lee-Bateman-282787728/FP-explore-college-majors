2763353,3,B000NA6CPY,"Why am I torn? You'll find out at the end of the review.

Anyway, this PPV came after an exciting and unpredictable Wrestlemania. Backlash is always the fall-out from WM, where rivalries from the show continue on. It's usually a good show, and one of the WWE's better non big four shows of the year.

The 2007 edition of Backlash was an odd one. There were some fantastic matches here, and also some not so good ones.

Here's my rundown:

World Tag Team Championship Match
Matt and Jeff Hardy (c) vs Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch

I think it was always a good idea to begin a PPV with a fast paced tag team match to get the crowd pumped. This is exactly what this match provided - the Hardys were huge fan favourites, and Cade & Murdoch weren't half bad either. I did like this match, but it wasn't outstanding. Everybody worked hard and seemed like they had fun. The end of the match was fantastic, and saw the Hardys retain the titles. (4/5)

Next was a segment backstage where the McMahons talk to Umaga and get him pumped for their match later on. The bit where Vince and Shane talk about who should be the new ECW champion is pretty funny, especially Shane's facial expressions.

Women's Championship Match
Melina (c) vs Mickie James

Like a previous reviewer said, this should have been the match we got at WM23. At the time, Melina and Mickie were two of the WWE's most talented divas and they put on a very good match here. This also got a good amount of time and wasn't over in 3 minutes like other diva matches. The most memorable moment was of course, the moment when both girls went into a split and continued to hit each other. Melina picked up the win, but both girls looked strong. I liked this match a lot. (4/5)

Next is a very funny interview segment with Maria and Edge. Maria was in her goofy interviewer phase, and Edge played along with her silliness great. There was a funny bit where Maria asked Edge how he won his first title, and then Edge asked who asked her to ask him that question. The camera panned over to reveal Mr Kennedy, who was holding his Money In The Bank briefcase. Kennedy pretty much implied he'd cash in the briefcase later on (he didn't).

Next was a look at behind the scenes of The Condemned, Steve Austin's movie. This is pretty much skippable.

United States Championship Match
Chris Benoit (c) vs MVP

Lots of people raved about the Benoit vs MVP feud, but I was never a huge fan. I found the feud a bit dull. Not taking away from Benoit's talent or from MVP's growing ability at the time, of course. This was another average match in their series. It was watchable, but nothing special. (3/5)

Next is easily one of my favourite moments of the whole PPV. John Cena is due to do an interview with Todd Grisham, but is interrupted by Randy Orton. What follows is extremely funny, and great work from both John & Randy. Randy says some questionable stuff, and John pretty much mocks him (with a great impression of Randy's trademark pose). The segment ends with an appearance from Ron Simmons and his famous ""damn!"". Very funny stuff.

3 on 1 Handicap Match for the ECW Championship
Bobby Lashley (c) vs Umaga, Shane McMahon & Vince McMahon

This is the low point of the PPV. We go from a hilarious interview segment to a terrible match. Well, technically, the match itself wasn't actually too bad - Bobby Lashley held his own and both Umaga and Shane showed off their skills, but I can't bring myself to give it even a decent rating due to the ending. Vince should have NEVER won that title, ECW was already in tatters and he ruined it further with his title win. I fully believe that if they absolutely HAD to take the title off Lashley, Umaga or even Shane should have won it, NOT Vince. However good the actual match was, the ending totally ruined it. (0/5)

Another Condemned segment here now, where people talk about what they thought of the movie. Skippable, again.

Then we go to backstage where Vince and Shane are celebrating Vince winning the title. There's an appearance here from the ECW originals - Rob Van Damn, The Sandman, Sabu and Tommy Dreamer (by the way, why weren't they used for the PPV?!), where Vince pretty much mocks them and the original ECW. Terrible.

Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
The Undertaker (c) vs Batista

Things pick back up again with a pretty good WHC title match. Batista and Taker had a great series of matches together, and this is one of them. This match was fast paced and entertaining - it included a table spot, weapon use and a fantastic ending. They replayed the ending about five times, and for good reason. The set pretty much collapsed on top of Taker and Batista! The match ended in a double count out, but I didn't mind cos the ending was good. (4/5)

Fatal 4 Way Match for the WWE Championship
John Cena (c) vs Shawn Michaels vs Edge vs Randy Orton

I seriously loved this match. I've always found Fatal 4 Ways to be entertaining, and this one lives up to that. The match began with a funny bit where John and Shawn had a little discussion and Edge and Randy got confused about why they were talking. From then on, the action was fast and furious. Every man got in good offence, and there were some amazing spots - including a moment where Edge and Randy had a submission hold on Shawn at the same time! The end sequence was hilarious and it needed the many replays! The sequence of events unfolded nicely and the kicker was John landing on top of Randy for the pin! Brilliant! I greatly enjoyed this match and the PPV ended on a high note. (5/5)

The extras are sucky. The first is an interview with Mr Kennedy where he talks about having Money In The Bank and how he's going to hold onto it for a long time (which completely contradicts what he said on the actual show) and the other is a short video of Rob Van Dam talking about Vince winning the ECW title. I totally agree with what he said, as he said Vince ruined ECW's legacy.

So now, we come to why I'm torn. I can't decide how to rate this PPV. It should get four stars as I loved the title matches, the Women's match, the opening tag title match and all three backstage segments. But then it should get three due to the terrible ECW match, a lacklustre United States title match and lack of extras.

In the end, I went for three stars but round it up to 3.5.",1210550400,,6353,4.405636208368915
2763354,4,B000NA6CPY,"Tonight is the aftermatch or aftermath of Wrestlemania 23.

World Tag Team Championship match
The Hardys vs. Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch

The crowd is really into the Hardys in this match. They started the show off really cool. The both of them showed off their moves and double team moves. Cade and Murdoch looked cool the match also. Out of their rivalry I think this is their best match. 8/10

WWE Women Championship match
Melina vs. Mickie James

This match was a little disappointing but it was better than the match at Wrestlemania 23. Melina is a good champion and I'm glad they gave the belt to her. Mickie did her usual things while Melina looked good to. Them doing that splits thing was so good I gave it a liitle more ratings. 6/10

WWE United States Championship match
Chris Benoit vs. MVP

I really liked this match but it wasn't as good as their match at Wrestlemania. MVP dominated most of the match. MVP really showed he is a very talented wrestler. Benoit brought his A game as usual and this didn't bore me. 7.5/10

3 on 1 Handicap match
ECW Championship
Bobby Lashley vs. Umaga, Shane, and Mr. Mcmahon

I wasn't really looking towards this match but it was kind of exciting. Vince stayed out of the ring while Shane and Umaga did all of the work. Bobby fended off the both of them and made this match good enough to watch. I thought Lashley was going to win after he got hit with the belt and got splashed but no. Vince came after the other splah to win the belt. 7/10

Last Man Standing match
World Heavyweight Championship match
Batista vs. The Undertaker

I'm so glad to see The Undertaker champion again. These two guys put on match of the night and entertained everyone that watched this event. It got really exciting when Undertaker went hardcore and leg drop Batista while he was on the announce table. I think they also used a chair and the steel steps. Towards the end Batista spears them both off the stage and gave us a draw, but still a fantastic match. 9.5/10

Fatal Four Way match
WWE Championship match
Edge vs. Randy Orton vs. Shawn Michaels vs. John Cena

This was a wild match. I was rooting for Randy Orton in this match. Everyone brawled with eachother. It real good towards the end when everyone hit there finishing moves. When Shawn hit the superkick I thought he would win but when cena fell on Orton and got the pinfall I was like ""WHAT'. Still a good match. 9/10

This was a good ppv following Wrestlemania 23.",1197849600,,2457,4.469798657718121
2763355,4,B000NA6CPY,"Let's get right to it!

The Hardys Vs. Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch (World Tag Team Championship Match) - This wasn't a great tag team bout but it didn't suck either. Still, it got the crowd into the PPV as the ovation the Hardys received was akin to what rock stars get! Hardys retain the tag gold at this point.

Melina Vs. Mickie James (WWE Women's Title Match) - This wasn't the greatest women's bout BUT this is what we should've got at WrestleMania 23 instead of Ashley Vs. Melina as this match was WAY better in comparison! At least neither had to take their clothes off to get attention! True, the current champ Candice Michelle did BUT at least she worked on being a good performer too.

I digress, back to the match. These two women had a surprisingly physical bout with one funny spot of them trading punches with each other while both were doing a split! Johnny Nitro and Kenny Dysktra (the current real-life boyfriends of the respective ladies in this match) are two lucky men! Ends with Melina doing the old ""Scopion Deathdrop"" on Mickie to retain.

Chris Benoit Vs. MVP (WWE United States Championship) - This one was a tough one to review. The way I got through it is that Chris Benoit was a murderer but he was also one of the best ever in the ring. Recent news of his brain condition has eased my concious somewhat however so I can view this match a lot easier now though still missing the happiness I once had for his matches.

Anyway, back to the match, this match with MVP proves that Chris was not only a great performer but he could make his opponent look great. MVP went toe to toe with his real life trainer (yes, MVP was actually part-trained by Benoit to wrestle in real life). Chris Benoit, like him or not, made MVP look the best he's ever looked both here and at WrestleMania 23 and started him on the run he's on now.

As for this match, Benoit actually gets in both his Crippler Crossface and his Sharpshooter but MVP either countered or got to the ropes. He even shocked the fans in Atlanta (ironically, the place that Benoit would end his life along with his wife and son) when he got Benoit to almost tap to a submission hold! Ends when Benoit caught MVP in a basic cradle to retain the U.S. title.

Bobby Lashley Vs. Mr. McMahon, Shane McMahon & Umaga (ECW Heavyweight Title Match/3 on 1 Handicap) - Easily the weakest match on the card! They were really urinating on the ECW legacy here! At least now, as I write this, they got two real wrestlers in CM Punk and Johnny Nitro going for the title!

Anyway, it ends with Vince McMahon getting the pin after Umaga devestates Lashley with two big splashes from the top rope!

The Undertaker Vs. Batista (World Heavyweight Championship/Last Man Standing) - Despite the draw ending, this match was easily the best on the card! The Undertaker beat the crap out of Batista but ""The Animal"", to his credit, came back to deliver some heavy punishment of his own. Ends when Batista spears UT off the entry stage through some electrical stuff that causes part of the stage to fall! Excellent bout despite the ending.

John Cena Vs. Shawn Michaels Vs. Edge Vs. Randy Orton (Fatal Fourway/WWE Title Match) - This was a wild way to end this card! All four men had their moments in this match. Most fans have decried the ending as dumb BUT I actually found it humorous! When I saw Shawn hit his superkick on Cena, I actually cheered for a moment until I realized that Cena landed on top of Randy Orton (who had been put down by Edge's spear tackle earlier) for an accidental pin! I personally busted out laughing! Not just at the ending but the reaction of the Atlanta crowd! Some were cheering but some weren't and the ones that weren't had some really funny reactions to Cena winning in this way. While not the best ending, definitely one of the funniest endings!

Overall, its worth a buy!",1184371200,,3861,4.4624113475177305

2763357,4,B000NA6CPY,"World Tag Team Champions Hardys vs. Lance Cade & Trevor Murdock - I assume this is WWE's attempt to bring some credibility back to their tag team division because this was one of the best tag team matches of the year right behind the various matches in the Hardys/MNM series.  The match had it all you would expect in a good tag team match: double team moves, suspension for a tag team partner to finally make a tag after getting beat on for minutes, mat wrestling & highspots.  Good & solid match to kick off the show but the one moment to look out for is Trevor Murdock's executing TNA wrestler Petey Williams' ""Canadian Destroyer"".

Womens Champion Melina vs. Mickie James - This was the match we were SHOULD have gotten at WrestleMania.  It went around 9 minutes but both divas here brought their A game here with Melina using her legs various time for innovative wrestling moves such as a full nelson & both girls fighting back & forth while doing the splits.

Normally I don't comment on backstage promos but you gotta check out the one here for the interaction between Edge & ""Mr. Money In The Bank"" Mr. Kennedy teasing about cashing in the title shot.

United States Champion Chris Benoit vs. MVP - I think MVP has a twin brother or something because it's amazing how the guy who was fueding with Kane late last year is this guy putting on these performances.  Their WM match was the ""sleeper"" match of the show where it wasn't heavily hyped but delievered.  That was the same case here as they topped their WM match earlier & the storytelling about MVP avoiding the headbutt & focusing on Benoit's neck was also very impressive.  As for Benoit...he's just Benoit & you can never go wrong there.  Once again, the best pure wrestling match of the night.

ECW Champion Lashley vs. Mr. McMahon, Shane McMahon, Umaga - This match was designed for Lashley to fail & it did.  Lashley tossed around Shane & Umaga for a while until the odds overcame him & Mr. McMahon got the cover for the win without really doing anything in the match.  This went on for over 15 mins. & it was just a waste.

Last Man Standing: World Champion Undertaker vs. Batista - A great match with both men using their power moves against each other & each one also selling their injuries (Batista's leg & Taker's arm).  Eventhough the finish of the match was a draw, don't let that take away from the effort of both men in this match that was an ideal followup to their WM encounter.  Look out for Taker's legdrop onto Batista though the announce table because that looked sick!

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Randy Orton vs. Edge - This four way match wasn't a big cluster like most of these type of matches are and everyone was able to leave still looking somewhat strong.  Each man had a chance to get certain highlight spots in like HBK's moonsault at the beginning of the match and each man attempting their finishers in the end cancelling one or another out of the match with the story of Shawn Michaels once again having the title slip though his fingers.

DVD extras include an interviews with Mr. Kennedy & a promo by RVD about Mr. McMahon becoming ECW Champion.

Overall (with the exception of the ECW Title match), this had an overall better match quality than WrestleMania and each match was given enough time to tell a story & become something special instead of just being rushed though or becoming nothing more than a filler match.  This is a PPV event that I highly recommend.",1182729600,5,3483,4.523125996810207

1. The Hardy Boyz vs. Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch for the World Tag Team Titles- This was the right choice to kick off the show. There was a lot of fast pace action to start off the match. Than Cade and Murdoch slowed it down. Hardys got the win after a couple close near falls match better thought than expected but it was just to predictable on who was going to win. Winners and still World Tag Team Champs The Hardy Boyz. Match Rating 7/10.
2. Melina vs. Mickie James for the wwe womens title- This was one of the btters women's matches in a long time and this is the match that should have been on the wrestlemania card. This was given enough time at 10 minutes long. It was a little slow but it picked when Mickie hit a near fall off the hurricanrana. Melina got the clean pin which is cool cause you don't usually see that for the heels. Winner and still wwe womens champ Melina. Match Rating 6.5/10.
3. Chris Beniot vs. MVP for the wwe U.S. title- This was another very solid wrestling match. I saw there match on smackdown and it was better than there mania match but this one was about the same as mania. MVP worked on the leg of Chris Beniot a lot in this match but Beniot was able to fight back with lots of suplexs. MVP fought out of the crossface and the sharpshooter a few times. Mvp went for the leg of beniot but beniot rolled him up for the win. I think they should try a submission match at judgementday it would be great. Winner and still US Champ Chris Beniot. Match Rating 7.5/10.
4. Bobby Lashley vs. Umaga, Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon in a 1 on three handicap match for the ECW title- This was not a fun match to watch. In fact this was the worst match of the night. Usually in a McMahon match you get quite a few hardcore spots but not in this one. They worked on lashleys arm a lot but Lashley made a comeback but Umaga hit a big splash from the top rope tagged in Vince and he got the pin to become the new ECW champ. There was a nice ending to this match and that was to see a huge surprise as no one saw lashley losing this match. Winner and New ECW Champ Vince McMahon. Match Rating 3/10.
5. Undertaker vs. Batistia in a last man standing match for the WHT- This in my opinion was the match of the night. These two when they first met weren't even supposed to have that good of a match but they did and here they proved they could do it again. This match started off as a decent brawl but than the match broke to the outside and taker hit a sick shot to the head of batistia with steel steps that busted him wide open. There was a nice table spot were taker set batistia on the table and than hit a leg drop through a table. They continued to fight and both men took some sick shots to the head with chairs. Both men hit there finishers and they went on stage and batistia fought off the arms of taker and when he turned around he hit a spear off the stage to the satge below a sick spot. Winner No Contest Double Count Out. Match Rating 9/10.
6. John Cena vs. Shawn Michales vs. Randy Orton vs. Edge in a fatal four way match for the WWE Title- This was a good match but to me this did not live up to other triple threats or fatal four ways. The match started out with just some solid action with every man for himself. The match was just a big brawl and solid wrestling there was one spot were michales got hit with a chair shot to the back by edge. The best part of this match was the final 5 minutes with non stop action and the end came evrypne hit there finisher and micahles hit cena with sweet chin music but cena fell on orton and got the 3 count complete crap a horrible finish for the winner and cena wins again which sucks. Winner and still wwe champ John Cena. Match Rating 8.5/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give Backlash 2007 a grade of 41.5/60 which is a 69 % which means this is a good ppv. I would say it could almost go under awesome in fact I would put it in the awesome column everything except the McMahon match everything was good so I recommend you pick this one up.

WWE Tag Team Championships

The Hardy Boys (champions) vs. Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch:

This was an okay match between the two teams. The crowd was solidly behind the hardy boys and neither brother seemed like they wanted to let the crowd down. Decent action between the two and the Hardy Boys win after a pin on Trevor Murdoch. 7.5/10

Women's Championship

Melina (champion) vs. Mickie James:

This was an okay match. Both women were as beautiful as ever. Some highlights include a lot of hair pulling and a sexy moment as both women did the splits in the ring at the same time and then started punching each other. Melina gets the win after a reverse DDT. 7/10

United States Championship

Chris Benoit (Champion) vs. MVP:

MVP has shown he is good in the ring and on the mike, he just needs the time experience to become a major title contender. MVP tried to target Benoit's neck during the match but Benoit fought back with some hard chops and his intense suplexing all over the place. Benoit gets the win after rolling up MVP out of nowhere. 8/10

Handicap Match

Bobby Lashley (champion) vs. Umaga, Vince and Shane McMahon:

This was a waste of time. Typical McMahon match where he doesnt do anything and has his cronies do all the work for him. After Shane hit Lashley in the head with the ECW belt and two top rope splashes by Umaga, Vince gets the tag and the pin to become the new ECW champion. 5/10

The Undertaker (champion) vs. Batista:

This was the best match on the card. Both men took a lot of punishment. The steel steps were used, and both men hit their finishers on each other but neither stayed down for a 10 count. The Undertaker at one point hit a leg drop on Batista through the announce table in a good moment. The fight goes to the rampway and Batista spears the Undertaker off the stage and neither man could get up after a count of ten. 8.5/10

John Cena (champion) vs. Shawn Michales vs. Randy Orton vs. Edge:

what a surprise, Cena wins again. This match was good, but thats just because HBK, Edge, and Randy Orton did all they could to beat each other up.

In the end Shawn hit his superkick on Cena but Cena fell on Randy Orton who was lying on the mat and got the unintentional pin. 8/10 (crappy ending)

Then Melina beat Mickey James in an ok Women's Title match after a scorpion death drop. Beniot then took on MVP in a match that MVP dominated a lot of. Beniot eventually reversed a leg submission move into a roll-up pin for win. Lashley then took on Vince, Shane and Umaga. Lashley dominated Umaga and Shane a lot while Vince hid in a corner like the rat he is. Shane eventually knocks out Lashley with the ECW title but Lashley kicks out when Vince goes for the pin. Umaga hits 2 splashes off the top rope and Vince gets the pin and is the new ECW champ. Wow no wonder Vince made Heyman leave, he really does know ECW better than Heyman...NOT!.

  Batista then took on Undertaker in a Last Man Standing Match. They beat the crap out of each other and both hit their finishers but no one would get counted to 10. Then Batista speared Undertaker off the entrance ramp and they both get laid out and neither answer the 10 the count.

  Edge vs Orton vs HBK vs Cena: The voting text message thing was pointless before this match and yep everyone knows by now that Cena isn't gonna lose. So yeah everyone voted he'd win and yep of course he did! It sucks that they can only have HBK beat the over-pushed jackass in a non-title match. Yes the match on Raw was great but...because of HBK! So it should've been for the title! HBK is more over than Cena too, he always gets bigger pops and is only booed in Canada. Cena only gets cheered by mostly women and little kids. People who are old enough to see how lame he is just don't like the guy. Anyway HBK gets screwed when he hits Cena with Sweet Chin Music and he lands on Orton for the pin. Then Cena acts like he's a great champ and the best when he wouldn't have won if it wasn't for HBK. Anyway, yes crappy ending to an otherwise solid ppv.

2763365,2,B000NA6CPY,"I disagree with the WWE's decision to make all 16 PPV's ""joint productions"".  I liked it when RAW had 5 PPV's, Smackdown had 5 PPV's, ECW had 2 PPV's and there were 4 Joint PPVS (WM, RR, SS, SS).

1.  You will now see the same guys in the main event EVERY MONTH (sometimes twice a month).  The split brands allowed them to showcase other wrestlers and spread the wealth.  You think that London & Kendrick or Chavo Guerrero will ever be on a PPV card now that they have to compete with all the midcard talent on RAW and ECW?  That was the nice thing about having brand specific PPV's.  That was the whole point of splitting up into ""brands"" in the first place!

2.  Too much ""brand"" jumping.  Remember when it actually meant something when a RAW guy would show up on Smackdown, or vice versa?  Or a guy getting traded from one brand to another?  Now they jump on a weekly basis!  If you have guys doing that every week, what's the point of even having separate brands?

3.  This will de-value the ""major"" PPV's.  One of the reasons the ""big 4"" we great is that they were the only ones that featured guys from all 3 brands.  Now they all will, so what's so special about them anymore?",1176681600,4,1182,4.252252252252252

8176185,4,B000NA6CPY,"The World Tag Team title match between The Hardy Boys(Matt & Jeff) against the team of Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch was not great but pretty good. The Women's title match between Mickie James & Melina was not bad but could have done better. The United States title match between Chris Benoit & MVP was solid. The 3-on-1 handicap match for the ECW title between Bobby Lashey against Team McMahon(Vince McMahon,Shane McMahon & Umaga) was too long for it's own good and bland at best. The Last Man Standing for the Worlds title between The Undertaker & Batista was basically a regular bout until the final spot but still solid. The Fatal 4 way match for the WWE title(Edge vs Randy Orton vs Shawn Michaels vs John Cena) was a tad repetitive but the team-ups and betrayals were very good and clever. Not to mention,everyone in that match had good chemistry with each other. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1360368000,,899,4.521472392638037
8176186,5,B000NA6CPY,"This was a pretty good pay per view. Here is some of my thoughts on the matches.

1. Hardy Boyz (c) vs. Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch for the Tag Team Championship

I think this was an awesome tag team Match and a great way to start off the night. A lot of close pinfalls. There were some points where it looked as Cade and Murdoch were going to win, but in the end the Hardy Boyz pull it out and I was happy with the result. Match rating: 8/10

2. Melina (c) vs. Mickie James for the Womens Championship:

What was funny, cause I was there live for this PPV, the moment the match started it seemed as half the people took a bathroom break or concession stand break. The match itself was not really that bad, I was hoping Mickie James won but It wasn't that bad. Some great technical wrestling and it was alright. Match Rating 4/10

3: Chris Benoit (c) vs. MVP for the United States Title

Despite how Chris Benoit's life wound up he was a great technical wrestler. He was great at what he did. MVP put on a great technical wrestler. This match was a technical wrestling masterpiece. The right person won.  Match rating: 9/10

4. Bobby Lashley (c) vs. Shane McMahon, Vince McMahon and Umaga: Three on one match for the ECW title

This was the worse match of the night. Everything about this match was wrong. Vince McMahon winning the title was an embarrasment to the history of ECW. Making sure he won was an embarrasment to ECW. It woulda come out better for Umaga winning the title. Horrible, Horrible and horrible. Match rating 1/10

5. Undertaker (c) vs. Batista. Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Title

Although the match ended with a draw. This match should have been the main event: It was an awesome Match. Every Match in tis feud had match of the year possibilities, Everything went right, finishers hit, great stuff, The Leg Drop through the table was something. Both getting up at 9, after the finisher was hit on the other. I wish Undertaker was the decisive winner, but wow it was a good decision to draw out the feud. Match Rating: 10/10

6: John Cena (c), Shawn Michaels, Edge and Randy Orton for the WWE Championship

This was the second best match of the night. All four did great. I am not giving it a ten cause the creative writers to me messed up the ending and this match ahould have taken place when the Undertaker vs. Batista spot ...Nice Counters a lot of great false finishes. The dumbest part to me  was when Shawn Michaels hit Sweet Chin Music to see John Cena to fall back on Orton was stupid. Shawn Michaels shoulda have been able to pin Cena at that point for the title. If Cena was gonna win, could have just had Cena hit is finisher and cover for the 123. Shawn hit his kick, don't use that for Cena to cover someone. Before that took place, awesome match, but when that happen it brought it down a bit and with thatbeing said the Match Rating: 9/10",1278460800,,2898,4.37243947858473

8176188,4,B000NA6CPY,"World Tag Team Championship
The Hardys vs. Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch
This match was a GREAT start to the night. I guess WWE was trying to revive their Tag Team division and the Hardys along with Cade and Murdoch certainly did that here in this match. This match had everything what a Tag Team match is suppose to have. Double teaming, moves done behind the referee's back, cheap shots, partner making the tag after being beat down for a long time. The Hardys didn't miss a step (well Jeff did during one point of the match) since reuniting as a team. Make sure to check out Trevor Murdoch trying to pull off TNA's Petey William's ""Canadian Destroyer."" Overall, a great match that did it's job. 4.75/5

Right around here is an entertaining promo involving Edge and the winner of the new ""Mr. Money In The Bank"" Mr. Kennedy teasing Edge about cashing in his Money In The Bank privilege at the end of the night. I recommend checking this promo out and do not skip over it.

Women's Championship
Melina vs. Mickie James
I felt this a darn good Women's Title match. This is the Women's Title match we should've got from Wrestlemania 23. This was the best Women's Title match since Lita and Trish from Unforgiven in 2006. Even though there were some spots that wasn't so smooth, Melina and Mickie pulled off a great Women's Title Match that we should have seen at WM 23. Some unique moves pulled off during the match such as the double split by Mickie and Melina. Definitely one of the better Women's Title Match of the year. 4/5

United States Championship
Chris Benoit vs. MVP
Benoit's and MVP's U.S. Title Match from Wrestlemania 23 was the sleeper match and thats the same deal on this night. Benoit and MVP topped their match from Mania. This time around you see MVP trying to avoid the headbutt and targeting more on Benoit's neck and trying to make Benoit tap out in his home town. Surprisingly, Benoit is able to apply both the Crippler Crossface and Sharpshooter on MVP during the match. This was another good title match with Benoit doing something he hardly ever do to get a win in a match. 4.25/5

3 On 1 Handicap Match for the ECW Championship
Bobby Lashley vs. Mr. McMahon, Shane McMahon, & Umaga
Definitely the weakest match of the night. Lashley toyed with Shane and Umaga early in the match until the numbers over came him. In the end after being beat down by Umaga, it was Mr. McMahon who came in and got the victory over Lashley after doing abosultely nothing throughout the whole the match. This match was obvisously designed for Lashley to lose and he did. 3/5

Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Undertaker vs. Batista
Despite the double count out end, this was the match of the night. And just like what Benoit and MVP did earlier, Batista and Undertaker topped their World Title Match from Wrestlemania 23. You see during the match both men selling their injuries, Batista's hamstring and Undertaker's arm. Undertaker was targeting Batista's injured leg throughout the majority of the match with some brawling occurring. Some spots to look out for are Undertaker's leg drop to Batista through the table, Batista & Undertaker able to stand up after suffering each other's finisher moves, and also Batista stealing an Undertaker move out of the corner. The draw came at the end where Batista countered the Tombstone and speared himself and Undertaker off the stage. Shockingly both men was able to walk away from that crash. Again, Match Of The Night. 5/5

Fatal 4 Way Match for the WWE Championship
Shawn Michaels vs. John Cena vs. Randy Orton vs. Edge
Unlike what you see from previous multi-man matches, this wasn't a big cluster of men in the ring at once. Each individual was able to shine in their own way such as Shawn Michaels hitting a moonsault off the top rope onto Orton, Edge, & Cena, Edge turning on Orton after you thought they were going to team up, and each man countering each other finishers into their own towards the end of the match. Even though the Elimination stipulation wasn't intact, this was a much better Fatal 4 Way Match then what I thought it was going to be. The ending only left Shawn Michaels letting the WWE Championship being slipped out of the fingers which showed after the match by the confrontation between Cena and Michaels. Still a good main event. 4.5/5

The extra's consists of Todd Grisham interviewing Mr. Kennedy on why he didn't cash in the Money In The Bank and Rob Van Dam expressing the way he feels about Mr. McMahon becoming the new ECW Champion.

Backlash was an excellent follow up to Wrestlemania 23. With the exception of the 3 on 1 ECW Title match, this PPV was near perfect. I recommend seeing Backlash. A very strong PPV with only one exception.",1242172800,,4752,4.635391923990499
