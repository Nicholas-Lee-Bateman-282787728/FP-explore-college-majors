3175855,5,B0017VG67M,"Oh my God!!  How exciting for us die-hard fans.  In my opinion, it's all uphill for Season 5-10!!!!!!!!",1210809600,4,103,4.666666666666667
3175856,5,B0017VG67M,"Beverly Hills 90210 - The Fifth Season is probably the last great season of this '90s hit. Shannen Doherty left the show and a new character was introduced, Valerie Malone. The character of Valerie was played by Saved By the Bell's Tiffani Amber Thessian who just happened to be dating Brian Austin Green at the time. Her character is anything but a sweetheart, she's cold, aloof, and deeply troubled. There are some great gems this season, in season six through 10 the show dipped but I stayed a loyal viewer throughout. My favorite character was Kelly Taylor played by Jennie Garth, she always brought warmth and sensitivity to that role, love her! This is a near-perfect season so don't wait reserve your copy today, enjoy!",1210550400,8,726,4.816
3175857,5,B0017VG67M,"This is a fantastic season.  With Brenda gone, having decided to stay in England, we meet Valerie who is a friend of the Walsh's from Buffalo and turns out to be a backstabbing and manipulative girl who is into drugs and alcohol.  Kelly is with Brandon by now, Donna and David have split, Brandon becomes the new student body president of CU, Kelly is almost burned alive at a party, David dates Clare, Dylan goes to rehab, Donna dates Ray, Andrea has an affair and cheats on Jesse, Kelly makes the cover of Seventeen magazine, there is a stupid episode with Dylan going into hypnosis and finding out he was Billy McCoy in the Wild West, and Jim and Cindy put their house on the market to move to Hong Kong.
This is season 5 in a nutshell.  There is so much material in between and the drama of it all is as addictive as always.  I love to hate Valerie, hate seeing Donna and David apart and I cannot wait for this release.  It's excellent and all fans of 90210 should be happy with this season.",1209772800,28,995,4.2994652406417115
3175858,5,B0017VG67M,"For me this is one of the best seasons of the series, Brenda is gone and Valerie has replaced her, Dylan is diving seriously into addiction, Brandon and Kelly begin a relatioship that lasts several seasons to come....

Plenty of drama........",1209600000,10,242,4.902439024390244
3175859,4,B0017VG67M,"Bleach Blondes... Boyish Bachelors... Beaches... Big B00bs... & Brenda, Brenda, Brenda!!! ...it's Beverly Hills!

Growing up I was such a huge fan of ""90210."" This was the only show (besides ""Melrose Place"") that I watched religiously, week in and week out. By Season 5 the show was a huge worldwide hit because fans all over the world tuned in to watch. But, sadly, this was also the season when ""90210"" jumped the shark.

Without Shannen the series did not have it's spark and it's chemistry. Shannen/Brenda was such a powerful enigmatic force that caused such a phenomenon because everyone had such a strong opinion of her. There have even been entire books written about the fascination with her (the ""I Hate Brenda Book"" comes to mind.) Shannen was like the Madonna of ""90210."" So, I suppose it was inevitable that they would all turn on her. Isn't that what always happens to those who are at the top of their game?

After Shannen was fired, the series took on a new ""direction"" with new cast members and less theatrical storylines. Season 5 was the beginning of the end as far as this classic series is concerned. I stopped watching ""90210"" I guess about a year after Shannen left because I could not relate to any of the other characters. None of them had that charisma, beauty, and talent of Brenda. (By Season 6, I was actually routing for that kook Tara, when she took super-priss Kelly Taylor hostage in that nonsensical ""Single White Female"" rip-off.)

Tori Spelling got incredibly annoying during Season 5. It was like the bigger her b00bs got and the more she bleached her hair the stupider she became. She almost reminded me of Chrissy from ""Three's Company,"" although I don't think even Chrissy Snow was that utterly dumb. I also hated all those stupid temper-tantrums she would have because it was so childish; although it was rather dramatic and funny to watch the Beverly Hills Princess as she became unraveled.

These are the Season 5 Cast Members:
*** Shannen-The Star-Doherty ~ Brenda Walsh  (I know by Season 5 Shannen is gone, I just wanted to include this to plss off everyone who hates her. LOL)
*** Jason Priestley ~ Brandon Walsh
*** Luke Perry ~ Dylan McKay
*** Jennie Garth ~ Kelly the ice-princess Taylor
*** Tori Spelling ~ Donna Martin
*** Ian Ziering ~ Steve Sanders
*** Brian Green ~ David Silver
*** Kathleen Robertson ~ Clare Arnold
*** Ann Gillespie ~ Jackie the reformed cokehead Taylor
*** Tiffani Thiessen ~ Valerie Malone
*** James Eckhouse ~ Jim Walsh
*** Carol Potter ~ Cindy Walsh
*** Gabrielle Carteris ~ Andrea Zuckerman-Vasquez
*** Joe E. Tata ~ Nat Bussichio
*** Jamie Walters ~ Ray Pruit
*** Mark D. Espinoza ~ Jesse the token minority Vasquez

Dylan was also very annoying during Season 5. Wasn't he so incredibly hungry for attention? And when all the hairball things he did didn't work he would get so upset. Wasn't it David that once called him a ""sanctimonious pain in the a-s-s...?"" That describes Mr. McKay perfectly because by Season 5 he was a grotesque and shocking picture of his former outrageous self. Even after he ""cleaned up his act"" he was still boring and not much to look at. (The only good thing about Season 6 is that by then the writers couldn't keep coming up with more foolish stories for him so he takes a hike!)

Who did I like from Season 5? Can you say Brenda Walsh... OK, besides her. Let's see... Ummmmm. Oh, I know. Steve Sanders. Steve is so funny because he never changed and never grew up. And wasn't Ian Ziering totally the Ringo of the group? I always felt bad for him because you could just tell that he got their sloppy seconds (and was glad to get it.) But Steve was cool because he didn't put on airs like the others and he didn't try to be anything but what he was. When I see Ian on Dancing With The Stars, I can't get into him because I still see Steve Sanders.

A Clean Slate 9/21/1994
Alex Diaz (F.J. Rio) theatens to expose Brandon if he doesn't back out of the election. Bran wins the election only to find out that his running mate has been run over and killed! Dylan is stunned to learn that his new leap-frog partner is living at the Walsh Home!

Life After Death 9/28/1994
The new CU President helps Steve out of a pickle at the KEG House. Felice sets up Donna with a friend's son. And, surprise, surprise he's white!!

Homecoming 10/12/1994
A head of an oppressive state comes to CU. Brandon is urged to protest his visit. Meanwhile, Ray and Donna work at his family's pumpkin patch.

Who's Zoomin' Who? 10/19/1994
The Peach Pit is closed. Valerie runs her mouth about Dylan's money problems and as usual Jim Walsh can't keep his nose out of Dylan's affairs. I love how Dylan tells him to go scratch.

Things That Go Bang in the Night 10/26/1994
Valerie learns that her mother's been admitted to a hospital because of mental issues!

Intervention 11/2/1994
The entire gang holds an ""intervention"" for down in the dumps Dylan. Mackenzie Phillips (Julie from ""One Day At a Time"") has a bit part as Counselor Ellen Marks. I love when Steve barks to Dylan: you're not worth the bottle you're trying to crawl out of. So funny and true!

The Dreams of Dylan McKay 11/9/1994
An entire ep is devoted to Dylan's dementia. Maybe we'll all get lucky and these DVDs will be the syndicated eps!

Hate Is Just a Four-Letter Word 11/16/1994
Brandon has to decide what to do when a controversial speaker wants to come to CU. When pushy Andrea throws her hat into the fire, the ep really starts to get good! I love it when that totally ghetto girl calls Andrea a b-i-t-ch. And Zuckerman says ""I don't need that"" in her snobbish Beverly Hills tone that she's now famous for.

The Voodoo That You Do So Well (also known as Rock of Ages) 11/23/1994
This is one of the better eps of the Season. Includes live clips at a Rolling Stones Concert (who knew that rich kids from Beverly Hills liked the Stones?)

Hazardous to Your Health 1/18/1995
Dylan goes to Punta Brava to meet ""Jonesy"" (Wings Hauser,) an informent that he hired to catch Suzanne (Kerrie Keane) and Kevin (David Hayward.) Valerie was so pathetic in this ep. When Dylan calls her she goes running like a little lapdog. With perhaps his only clever remark, Jim Walsh says to Cindy ""she has no shame."" I also thought the entire subplot concerning Erica (Noley Thornton) was so pathetic. Even if her mother and step-father were crooks doesn't mean that Dylan had any right to steal her away; can you say ""kidnap?"" And he doesn't even take her in, instead he dumps her off with Iris because as he put it (in the next ep) ""the two hit it off."" ...Oh yea, I bet any woman would jump at the chance to babysit her ex-hubby's child that he had out of wedlock!

Little Monsters 2/1/1995
Kelly becomes more and more involved with Findley's Group. Dylan pays Val $10,000.00 for her effort but she's not happy with that and runs to ""Jonesy"" for some more dough.

Love Hurts 3/1/1995
David's sleaze-ball friend Lenny (Tracy Fraim) is released from questioning. Donna is almost attacked when a kook gets her keys and sneaks into the beach house apartment!

Unreal World 3/15/1995
David and Clare film the gang in an apparent ""Real World"" knock-off.

Double Jeopardy 3/29/1995
Jesse moves out. Meanwhile, David goes with Donna to Portland in the hopes of seeing his estranged mother.

A Song for My Mother 4/5/1995
This is one of my favorite eps of the Season. Ray gets rough with Donna and pushes her around because he's furious that David came along. David finally finds Sheila (Caroline Lagerfelt) who apparently forgot to take her lithium.

Squash It 4/12/1995
Steve and David put together a rhythm and blues night at the After Dark. Meanwhile Ju'wan (don't you just love that name?) (Vicellous Reon Shannon) makes some waves and learns that violence isn't the answer to solve his problems.

Girls on the Side 5/3/1995
The ice-princess is down in the dumps when she's the Seventeen Magazine covergirl.

The Real McCoy 5/10/1995
Another ludicrous ep dedicated to Dylan's narcissism. Under hypnosis, he learns that a lady who looks exactly like Kelly Taylor was his lover during a past life. YAWN...

Hello Life, Goodbye Beverly Hills 5/17/1995
...Ding-dong the witch is gone! The gang hold a going-away party for Andrea at West Beverly. I love when Ray sarcastically says to Donna ""how many times are you going to say goodbye to her."" Kelly and Bran breakup when she can't choose between him and Dylan. Only a girl like Kelly Taylor would let 2 great guys like that slip through her fingers!

P.S. I Love You 5/24/1995
Cindy and Jim take off for Hong Kong. The gang all go to Palm Springs for a KEG event. Brandon tags along because he's still hurt about the breakup. Meanwhile, Ray gets violent (once again) with Donna and pushes her down the stairs at the resort! ...Dylan is threatened by some men who claim that they knew who blew up Jack McKay. This is a 2-hour ep that airs in 2 parts during syndication.

""90210"" Season 5 taught me 1 very important message. I learned that there are 2 types of people in this world. Those who Love Shannen Doherty and those who Loath her. Which type of person are you?",1208995200,31,11145,4.633688483003551
3175860,2,B0017VG67M,"This season is when things start to unravel both for the characters and for the cast/crew. It's due to a combination of actor decisions and apparent writer changes.

Shannen Doherty had been written out of the series, so Tiffany-Amber Thiessen gets brought on as 'friend' Valerie Malone. At the time Thiessen was also dating Brian Austin Green off camera, which I am sure helped her with the casting priority. Not being biological family, she immediately tries to seduce Brandon. Valerie  is a flirt who will attach herself to anybody she meets---from Steve Sanders to Dylan McKay. Brenda's name is haphazardly thrown around this season, like the script writers weren't sure that their little trick was actually going to work for the long haul/ It's not the 1960's (Bewitched switched out two cast members!) and the Walsh family themselves was supposed to be the backbone of this series.

Episodes where Dylan is depressed because he is broke show Perry's chops as an actor. Disappointed though that Erica was suddenly dumped as possible ensemble character.  Dylan went to all that trouble to rescue her--when the FBI contractor just said that they were only going to recover the money. And then he dumps her with HIS biological mother who she does not know at all?? This would be 'slightly' awkward. Iris is a 'free spirit' but even she would find it awkward to raise the half-daughter of her philandering ex-husband. She could have worked through her PTSD from having been taken to a foreign country.  And didn't Erica have a 'connection' with Dylan?? What happened then? An older brother who already did his own share of brooding would have been a perfect support system!!

Another change is that former teen seductress/nympho, Claire Arnold moves into David's old room at the beach hose. She is suddenly a snorer. Kelly had shared a room with her @ a retreat--but was oddly not kept awake there. And being a chancellor's daughter of a State public university is NOT a big deal as anybody who actually attended college knows. We did not care re the faculty/staffs kids. The only perk they actually might have received was reduced tuition, but that was about it.

The runner up for shoddy episode writing would have to be Donna brushing off Ray smashing her pumpkins and STILL deciding to stay with him. This should have raised serious red flags.  And the other people she lived with definitely should have said something. They ignore it and pretend that things are fine.

Not having much to do 'around the house'  anymore, Jim and Cindy Walsh made a pivotal decision at the end of this season. Jim is going to take another big job--this time overseas in Hong Kong. The Walshes were the whole heart and soul of the series, so their very obvious paring down as recurring characters means that you can skip purchasing this season and subsequent others.  For all purposes, the series ends.",1495065600,,2888,4.849593495934959

3175869,5,B0017VG67M,"This was one of my favorite seasons of the college years. I give the writers, producers and the casting people a lot of credit.  I feel like they really upped the ante for the college years, the characters are no longer the same people that they were in high school,  they were not the most popular kids in their freshman year, sophomore year, some of them fell back into some of their high school ways. I believe that the casting people brought in more realistic  guest actor's then in the high school years. The new character's they brought in were great.  Ray was my new favorite male, and still is. I loved Clare and Valerie as well. I did notice that when Dylan came back from his trip to Baja, he seemed to be stalking Kelly. That was very creepy when he was standing on a water tower watching her on her front porch.",1472256000,,823,4.324675324675325

There are songs that are different, and some that are just cut out.  Even scenes are cut out, and some are interrupted in the middle and then the end is just sort of attached, which makes it very confusing if you haven't seen it before.  Now I'm unsure if I ought to bother purchasing anymore seasons because it's such a waste of money. Although I do have the last season, and it seems to be intact- so I probably will take the chance.  I hate it when shows cut things up like this. It's worse than watching it on TV with commercials.",1356912000,,799,4.364864864864865
3175911,3,B0017VG67M,"I'm a big fan of the show, but this is by far the worst seasons with the original cast all still together (well sans Brenda, who apparently has the longest summer drama class...ever). An argument can be made that season 4 was refreshingly underrated, and a contender for the best overall season. So this mixed bag really looks worn down in comparison.

The four things that stand out for me the most from this season:

- The great intro of Valerie Malone. Man did they do a great job getting a Brenda replacement with this girl. The same demographic already knew, and loved her, as ""Saved by the Bell's"" Kelly Kapowski. And they played up that whole goody good image she had on Saved by the Bell only to cleverly smash that image totally in the last glorious pot smoking 30 seconds of the premier episode. That was this season's most defining, and best moment.

- Former frump Andrea Zuckerman goes blonde, loses her Cindy Walsh wardrobe, and reveals a hot girl underneath. I've always liked Andrea, and could see glimpses of a cute girl there, but halfway through season 5 it's like Carteris went to the producers and said ""enough of this crap! If I'm going to be filmed along side all these young girls, you need to give me a leg to stand on!"". It's too bad that they finally let Andrea be youthful and attractive just as she was taking that long ride to Yale, and off our screens.

- Kelly gets burned. Barely. But acts like her entire body was engulfed in an inferno. STFU Kel. I always thought the 90210 producers and writers missed a huge opportunity to push the envelop here by having the hottest girl in the group get her face seriously burned. That, or actually let her explore some same sex feelings with the other girl who was in the fire with her.

- Kelly chooses...Kelly. Shocking.",1344470400,2,1795,4.510769230769231
3175912,5,B0017VG67M,"Being one of the best series of the 90s, the fifth season is no doubt any different than the earlier seasons. They're in college and going through trials and tribulations of adjusting to college life along with their own personal issues. I thoroughly enjoy the reruns and decided it's a must own TV series from my teenage years into college myself. If you've received the first four seasons of the series make sure you continue collecting as the story lines grow deeper between the characters. I recommend the series.

3175913,5,B0017VG67M,Season 5 is my favorite season of Beverly Hills 90210. I wish the DVD quality was better though too grainy.,1336003200,,107,4.4
3175914,2,B0017VG67M,"Almost all of the gang is back, plus a new face or three. There's smarmy politico, Brandon Walsh, one time party girl, turned stick-in-the-mud priss, Kelly Taylor, Mickey Rourke wannabe Dylan McKay, fool's fool Steve Sanders, gawky rapper turned videographer David, boring self righteous Andrea and her even more boring husband and yet even more boring baby, weiner-tease Donna Martin, and of course...Nat, who in all likelyhood, is only a few years older than the rest of the cast.

The newcomers are slutty basket case Valerie, one note (and a false note at that) Ray Pruit, and Claire (she was around the previous season actually, but who's counting?) Much happens this year, Dylan lost all his dough, which causes his posture to sink and his hairline to recede, and he spends most of his time drinking coffee when he's not chasing the dragon or shooting plastic skeletons. Brandon becomes school president after his running mate gets burned alive in a car accident. And like most university class presidents, he must face down anti-semitism, and torturing dictators from other countries. The name of this country is Selenisia, where they tortured school custodians in the name of democracy. Do not cry for them though, I am quite certain Selenisia doesn't exist.

Speaking of getting burned alive...Kelly gets, well, burned alive. Not her face. Her arm and neck mostly. Sadly, the stick that seems to have been placed up her keyster this season does not go up in flames. Oh yeah, she joins a cult too.

Valerie was a good idea to bring on the show, but why Claire? She's as dull as one of Andrea's dishrags. I also forgot to mention, Casper Van Dien shows up and gives a very convincing performance...as a Macy's mannequin. And then there's Ray Pruit (his mom could only afford one T) the musician with the personality of a boom mic. Which brings me to, the boom mic! Every once in a while, it just kind of appears, much like all the parents on this show. Just kind of shows up and then goes away. God bless it.

My favorite episode? The Real World one. It is so astonishingly, brilliantly, flabberghastingly awful, it summizes why I love watching the show in the first place. To feel superior to these actors who are prettier and richer than we can ever hope to be. Hey, I never had to humiliate myself in front of a generation!

I wouldnt buy it new thats for sure..look for a cheap used copy...That way if your disapointed you can tell yourself that you didn't waste a lot of money.",1304035200,,640,5.163461538461538
3175916,4,B0017VG67M,This was another great season for Beverly Hills 90210.  I bought it the day it was released just like I do with them all! After watching the season a couple times it seems like they cut out all the scenes with Ray (Donna's boyfriend) performing?  When I watched the show back in the 90's I remember seeing him perform on the show a lot.  In this season he sings one of his songs for about 10 seconds in the episode when they all go to the Rolling Stones concert.  And if you pay attention you will notice in some of the episodes he is just about to go on stage and then the next scene the concert is over so you never see him performing.  I love watching all of my favorite old shows from the 80's & 90's but I can't stand it when they cut stuff out.  Did anyone else notice that?,1301356800,2,780,4.032467532467533
3175917,1,B0017VG67M,Well i was excited for this to come in but when i got it one of the disc was cracked and i'd like to get it for free i think its fair..,1295049600,,135,3.25
3175918,4,B0017VG67M,"Not as dramatic as the past season, Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five was still addicting to watch as usual. I didn't have a particular favorite of any episode during the season, and I thought that some of them in Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five have become unrealistic in the worst way possible. Now, let's get started with the characters of the cast. Brandon Walsh...ah, yes...the inveterate hypocrite. Of course, I've written before that politics was so him last season, and he showed his true colors as well in season five. Speaking of unrealistic, Brandon Walsh managed to get away with his traffic stop bust in the final episode when he was an underage drinker, in possession of a joint (regardless of the fact he wasn't smoking it), and already had prior (should have) convictions of DUI and reckless driving. There was no wonder why the writers want the audience to believe that Brandon is on his way to sainthood (yeah, right). Then, he cheated on his girlfriend Kelly Taylor by staying over the night with Emily Valentine (Ugh...what's with her hairdo? Bring back the yellow, please.) during the night of the fire at the party house. Finally, in the end, he pressured Kelly to marry him before they are both 21 years old. When Kelly rejected his proposal, Brandon turned down a relationship with Kelly for gosh-knows-what-reasons and ended up necking with the ever bad girl Valerie Malone. Ew...but very realistic for him though. Moving on to Valerie Malone, played by the newcomer Tiffani-Amber Thiessen...now what would Zack Morris think of? It was a shock at first for many viewers accustomed to seeing her as the always nice, beautiful Kelly Kapowski from Saved by the Bell, but she really did an awesome job shedding away the perfect image of herself and becoming the worst enemy possible in Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five. Of course, she was also an enigma...at times, you like her, and then, she does the 180 degree in an instant. I have to say that she is a girl of many talents, meaning that she could have made things easier if she would find a rich guy in Beverly Hills and marry him for the money. As far as to the end of season five, I am very confused about her motives, but does it have anything to do with the suicide of her father? We shall see in next season. By the way, I am very disappointed that she got her name in the opening credits right away when Joe Tata, working on the show for four seasons, was still not in there yet. Elsewhere, Kelly Taylor made her case for being the most likeable character of the show, and she had matured the most. I found her intelligent yet confused about her identity, and her way of dealing with issues around her had made the show highly interesting to watch. She made the right choice by turning down Dylan and Brandon; she deserved better, and neither deserved her. I was pleasantly surprised in one episode when she confessed to Donna that Dylan ""is one of the most self-centered people on the planet Earth and according to him, he's been that way for several lifetimes."" I couldn't agree with her more. That will always stand out of the best lines of the entire show. Dylan McKay...what can I say? He certainly made the show interesting as well...but he had to be the dumbest of all characters with probably an exception of Donna Martin. Sure, he reads literature and quotes lines from poems, but he doesn't come across to me as an intellectual. Far from it. The sanest thing he could have made with his life is to sell the house, move out of Beverly Hills, and live somewhere else in a quiet existence. The only rational reason for his depression and getting into alcohol and drug fueled binge is because he was facing the possibility of having to work for the rest of his life (aw, poor Dylanie, too over-privileged, ain't he?). Speaking of intellectuals, how about Brandon attempting to make into Jeopardy!? *blows raspberries* yeah right...he didn't even know what the Mendoza Line (a very common term) was. That's another case of character manipulation. Poor Donna, she hadn't changed much except for her wardrobe. She is a very nice girl, but in some of the outfits she wore, she dressed practically like a hooker and was one step away from patrolling Sunset Strip and asking Johns to pick her up. Honestly, nobody ever in her right mind would wear such clothes like them for regular outings. Her relationship with Ray Pruit had grown tiresome and didn't result in a breakup after the end of Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five. Jamie Walters' character is a sad case of character manipulation as he was portrayed as an abusive boyfriend and a cheater. For somebody from the wrong side of the tracks, it would be nice to show him as a honest, decent person just for once. He was actually that way from the beginning until things started to go very wrong. Nonetheless, I agreed a lot with what Ray Pruit had been saying all along, and it can be very tedious to date a girl who seemed to be married to her friends. Worse than that, it can be extremely impossible to have a relationship with a girl who vowed celibacy until marriage. That's just not possible in late 20th century while everybody is in prime of their lives. Moreover, it doesn't help matters any if Donna keeps dressing like a hooker. Her mother may have topped Brenda Walsh as the most hated character of the series. The moment that she was bringing up the interracial mix with D'Shawn, my eyes literally rolled. Then, it got worse when she attempted to pay Ray off. It's easy to see how Donna is being controlled by her mother. Steve Sanders, nothing is ever new with him. He is the same old himself. I still like him regardless of the million faults he has accrued over the years. Good going for Jesse to set Steve straight after telling a story of how the system works for some and not for others. Pretty selfish of Steve to think he got robbed of his silly ambitions. Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five is the final one for four characters: Andrea Zuckerman, Jesse Vasquez, and Cindy and Jim Walsh. I never cared for nor liked Andrea, and I found her full of herself. It's like...give her an issue, and she'll go nuts about it. Too much for me. She was also a hypocrite just like his pal Brandon. Her marriage should have died after she cheated on Jesse, and she didn't deserve him. As for Jesse, I liked him a lot, and now, for the unrealistic part thrown in by the writers for the sake of leverage, I was appalled by the character manipulation by making Jesse an equally culpable member for having committed adultery. I will not believe that for a second because hadn't he done it, that makes Andrea to be the bad person, and deservingly so, in the relationship. Thus, the divorce will be a fait accompli. At the rate Jesse was going by with his work, it was very evident that his mind was on building up his family while undertaking a very serious step forward with his career. That always happens, and he is too busy to be doing something so silly as to sleep with somebody else at that critical juncture of his life. Cindy and Jim Walsh, too bad...it's over for them. They were easily my favorite characters of Beverly Hills 90210, and they were excellent in their roles. Just perfect. Too bad they didn't get the chance to punish their children the way they deserved to be. Oh...I haven't mentioned Brenda Walsh. Who cares? Good riddance. David, hm...nothing changes about him. He is boring as usual. Ditto for Clare. I think the only reason why she got on the show is because of her overdone lips. Other than that, she had a horrible snobbish attitude that I found it unpleasant to watch. Speaking of cheating, that aspect was way overplayed throughout the entire season of Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five. That's when the show started to lose a lot of credibility. The probability of seeing so many characters cheating on the significant other was too high for a series that it became too unrealistic. Let's keep track of who was cheating on who: Dylan on Brenda with Kelly, Kelly on Dylan with Brandon, David on Donna with Ariel, Donna on Ray with Griffin and also on Griffin with Ray, Donna on Ray with Brandon (now...what was that??? Ray would have blown three fuses in his mind had he knew about the scene for the Valentine telethon), Brandon on Kelly with Donna, Brandon on Kelly with Emily, Ray on Donna with Valerie, Cindy on Jim with a photographer (can't remember his name), Steve on Celeste with a Date Rape accuser (can't remember her name either), Andrea on Dan Rubin with Jesse, Andrea on Jesse with Peter, Brenda on Dylan with Rick, and Valerie on everybody with everybody else. Ridiculous. Speaking of that, what a waste of time to watch Dylan's dreams. They were useless and didn't amount to anything in the end because we already knew that he always wanted Kelly. Now, for Brandon acting as the president of the student population at California University....I've attended many schools in the past decade, but not one of them that I found the student president an important person. And I knew neither the name of one in any school. Incorrectly in one of the episodes of season five, no student president has a say when it comes to tuition rate in any college; that's up to the board of trustees and/or whoever else with authority. As for the ""brainwashing"" part with Kelly Taylor and New Evolution, I thought what she was doing was fine, but the one she was in that was found to be a fraud shouldn't have deterred her from looking for another program, a safer one. She was still traumatized about what happened to her and Allison in the fire. I noticed how religious season five had gotten, and I was getting nauseous during them. Tone it down, please. One episode that I found the most dramatic of season five was the fire where Kelly and Allison were trapped in the basement. As I know that they got very scared, they should have thought of splashing water into themselves and soaking their clothes from the sink, if the shower wasn't there on the left side of them (I couldn't see it; if there was one, take off the clothes and stay in the shower, running cold water on themselves the entire time until the firemen come). That would have been a huge help for them as far as being inflamed goes. Despite the many negatives of the show, I really found the handling of the many characters in so many parallel ways genius and clever and the storylines to be the best feature. They were so interesting that the series ended up to be addicting to watch. I am glad they had recurring characters, but the show remains too white for me. Speaking of whiteness, I think it was demeaning that the writers still portrayed many characters, especially Jesse, of different races to be flawed in a bad way. There must be plenty of characters, white or not, that are really good people, and I am not seeing it that much in season five. I am starting to notice the fashion on many characters, and I liked them all save a few. Ray's choice of wardrobe is pretty good and interesting to me, not too flashy but simple. Some of the episodes are annoying in the DVD because of the cut out scenes, most notably Jamie Walters' music. It is always so remarkable to me how well every character has recovered from any dramatic episode in their lives and never be in state of depression, further heightening the lack of realism of the show. One more great scene occurs when Brandon and Dylan are invited into a sweat lodge with Native Americans. That ranks among the best scenes. Speaking of musicians, as soon as I saw Jade in one episode, I admit...I've never heard of them before and don't see them as a popular band. All in all, Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five is addicting to watch but is losing steam with unrealistic set ups of subplots.",1292198400,,11788,4.584557081951682

3175928,4,B0017VG67M,"I recently picked up this set of 90210 and enjoyed reliving it for the first time since it went off air back in 2000. I wasn't a die hard fan of the show back in the day but I did watch quite regularly... really I was more into Melrose place, 90210's sister show. Still, I did watch this show regularly...

The early years of the show (seasons 1-4) were huge culture events for young people all over the world in the 90's, they struck a chord because of the willingness to tackle many issues ... drugs, alcohol, etc. Whilst I did watch the show during these seasons , I really enjoyed watching the show more in the later years ... starting with this season, my first to purchase on dvd.

This season saw a shift from being a little on the preachy, educational side in the early years to a more entertaining (for me anyway) melodrama, the focus was less on issues and more on relationships this year... a lot of people didn't like this switching of gears. But I did, and if you liked the more soapy feel of later 90210, then you will enjoy this season for sure..

We knew the characters so well by now having watched them grow in previous seasons and we really cared about them as an audience, they all had that likeability factor that is crucial to any hit show. So, it was nice to see the characters blossom further this year in preparation for the real world after college.

Shaneen Doherty had been fired after year 4, but my they struck gold with the introduction of bad girl Valerie this year, she was edgier and more entertaining to watch than spoilt Brenda ever was. Valerie was developed slowly this season and it was a hoot to watch her pretending to be nicey-nice at first to the walshes and the gang before becoming a bitch that you actually rooted for in ways.. she was the new star of the show.

As for the rest of the gang, donna developed nicely pursuing new relationships with guys like griffin and ray... having moved on from david, david coupled up with Clare Arnold  and the two were a welcome comedic duo, clare has many great lines... steve was steve... moving from one hair brained idea/ scheme to the next, Brandon remained the moral anchor of the show and his relationship with Kelly was only starting out, Dylan went off the rails then back on them and spent the rest of the season pining in the background for Kelly, Andrea and jessy were doomed from the start and drifted apart slowly before bowing out of the show , also cindy and jim depart by season end.

All in all, this season is a good buy, it's light and fluffy in many ways, the odd issue crops up here and there and is played out  through character's dilemmas  but mostly its just nice to relive the stories/lives of old faces that we knew and loved.
(By the way, a lot of people complained that the music has been changed in many episodes, I didn't notice honestly , it definitely didn't effect my enjoyment of the show). Enjoy!",1229212800,,2916,4.39517625231911
3175929,3,B0017VG67M,"Where do I start with the bad? Setting aside the cheap and dismissive packaging for a moment, I begin with the hack-job they did on the show itself. Not only is the soundtrack COMPLETELY different (and it does suck), but any footage of Ray Pruit playing with his band has been cut out. That leaves us with about 2 rousing performances, including Ray singing, ""the Worms Crawl In, the Worms Crawl Out..."" to a bunch of kids at the KEG house Halloween party. Looks like David really had some pull in post production and got Ray completely taken off the PPAD roster for good. Now onto the soundtrack...you know, the music that plays in the background during the show? After watching the same episodes for years, I have come to memorize and appreciate certain scenes for their appropriately chosen musical accompaniments. Well, they're gone now. 2 notable disappointments: Episode 1: Kelly & Donna at the salon before the make up. The song should be The Pretenders, ""It's Just the Night in My Veins."" Now it's something else that wrong & crappy. And the other is the episode where David, Donna & Clare do the video with everyone sleeping around campus. Should be L7's ""Pretend We're Dead"", which actually suits the video, but no...

Why then 3 stars? Because, this is still one of the best seasons out there (second only to season 6.) The fire, the PPAD is born, Kelly joins a cult, Dylan does heroin and almost dies, then goes to Mexico and swindles his millions back from Kevin & Suzanne, in a word- Val, the ""Real Life"" episode, the great bear heist, and finally, the Walshes and Andrea leave (thank God!)

The bottom line? Buy at your own risk. The soul has been sucked from this show but it's still season 5 of 90210 (sort of.)",1225584000,6,1728,4.607142857142857

I loved season 5, but like many others, was very disappointed by Ray's missing scenes and the constant music changes. I understand they do not have the rights to the music for the DVDs because the musicians were only payed for the original airing and syndication. I really wish they could work something out with the artists because this is a huge show, and hearing songs on TV really prompts users to download the songs on ITUNES.

I was also really let down that there was no special features. I think the segment, ""Everything You Need to Know About 90210"" is absolutely hilarious. I was so sad there was not one for season 5. Keeping my fingers crossed the rest of the seasons will at least have that one special feature!

I watched (and taped) every episode for the whole 10 years... but those VHS tapes wear out, so imagine my joy when the DVD set came out... or not...

As I said, I have taped every episode, and I watch it now on Soapnet... and as you know like watching your favorite movie over and over, you can ""talk along with the movie""... well I am that way with this show. I now know (but didn't until after having bought the first 2 seasons) that the box says in fine print on the back of the box that ""MUSIC HAS BEEN CHANGED FOR THIS HOME ENTERTAINMENT VERSION. SOME EPISODES MAY BE EDITED FROM THEIR ORIGINAL NETWORK VERSIONS."", but come on!!! I noticed a wierd edit in another season episode and a spot here and there, not to mention in season one when all the girls have a slumber party and are signing along to ""Mony Mony"" but now the music is different... but The Senior Prom episode was seriously butchered! There were major parts gone... not to mention Cathy Dennis sang 2 songs at the prom and they cut the whole second song out, along with shots of her and most of the actors lines that were said during that song. I am very disappointed in this. The prom episode was a great one, not to mention a pivital part of the season. Part of the greatness of 90210 was the fact that they used new, up to date music for every episode.

Come on FOX... how cheap are you? We are all paying $40 or more for a set that probably costs $5 to make... You couldn't shell out some cash to keep this amazingly cool show intact in it's original condition??? And what are you going to do in future seasons??? There were tons of episodes later on in the Peach Pit After Dark where a famous music group plays there... are those hour long episodes going to be edited down to a half hour show?

So, before you start sending me hate email, let me say this:
My review comes to this = Yes, I love the show and Yes, I have and probably will buy every season on DVD. But Yes, I am disappointed in the editing. So to all of you die hard fans like me... be aware of this before you buy and watch it, so you aren't completly disappointed like I was when I first bought and watched them. Maybe they will get this figured out and stop their ""editing"" or ""ruining"" our favorite show!!!

***Ok, if you read alot of reviews... you may recognize I wrote this above exact review above for season 3. Well, my questions were answered. I am watching season 5 now, and the group Jade made an appearance. Yes, they did show them sing one song, but they cut out all of the other spots in the show where they appeared. Not to mention that the Ray Pruet character sang on the show quite a bit, but so far thru disc 6 I have not heard one note... one episode they cut almost 5 minutes of an episode just to avoid showing him singing. This is getting ridiculous... should we be boycotting?

5th season is great. Finally without Brenda, but with a new character Valerie, oh how much I hate her!!! She is the perfect B***!",1218585600,,411,4.189873417721519

A lot of important things happened however it was filled with a lot of unimportant hours. The whole relationship of Kelly and Dylan was so over hyped. All they did was argue and there were like 1 or 2 times they were actually happy. Im not even sure they went through one episode without fighting.

When Season 5 came along and get Brenda the hell out of there they finally got serious. The stories were so much more adult and the acting was incredible!

Brandon was top notch!
Nobody can top Dylans amazing performance as a herion addict and drunk!
Kelly was even going through a lot and did it well.
Donna was likeable!
CLAIR CLAIR CLAIR! OMG she's a real regular now! The show just got 2wice as good as it woulda been with just Val!

3410353,5,B0017VG67M,"Beverly Hills 90210 - The Fifth Season is probably the last great season of this '90s hit. Shannen Doherty left the show and a new character was introduced, Valerie Malone. The character of Valerie was played by Saved By the Bell's Tiffani Amber Thessian who just happened to be dating Brian Austin Green at the time. Her character is anything but a sweetheart, she's cold, aloof, and deeply troubled. There are some great gems this season, in season six through 10 the show dipped but I stayed a loyal viewer throughout. My favorite character was Kelly Taylor played by Jennie Garth, she always brought warmth and sensitivity to that role, love her! This is a near-perfect season so don't wait reserve your copy today, enjoy!",1210550400,8,726,4.816
3410354,5,B0017VG67M,"This is a fantastic season.  With Brenda gone, having decided to stay in England, we meet Valerie who is a friend of the Walsh's from Buffalo and turns out to be a backstabbing and manipulative girl who is into drugs and alcohol.  Kelly is with Brandon by now, Donna and David have split, Brandon becomes the new student body president of CU, Kelly is almost burned alive at a party, David dates Clare, Dylan goes to rehab, Donna dates Ray, Andrea has an affair and cheats on Jesse, Kelly makes the cover of Seventeen magazine, there is a stupid episode with Dylan going into hypnosis and finding out he was Billy McCoy in the Wild West, and Jim and Cindy put their house on the market to move to Hong Kong.
This is season 5 in a nutshell.  There is so much material in between and the drama of it all is as addictive as always.  I love to hate Valerie, hate seeing Donna and David apart and I cannot wait for this release.  It's excellent and all fans of 90210 should be happy with this season.",1209772800,28,995,4.2994652406417115

3410356,4,B0017VG67M,"Bleach Blondes... Boyish Bachelors... Beaches... Big B00bs... & Brenda, Brenda, Brenda!!! ...it's Beverly Hills!

Growing up I was such a huge fan of ""90210."" This was the only show (besides ""Melrose Place"") that I watched religiously, week in and week out. By Season 5 the show was a huge worldwide hit because fans all over the world tuned in to watch. But, sadly, this was also the season when ""90210"" jumped the shark.

Without Shannen the series did not have it's spark and it's chemistry. Shannen/Brenda was such a powerful enigmatic force that caused such a phenomenon because everyone had such a strong opinion of her. There have even been entire books written about the fascination with her (the ""I Hate Brenda Book"" comes to mind.) Shannen was like the Madonna of ""90210."" So, I suppose it was inevitable that they would all turn on her. Isn't that what always happens to those who are at the top of their game?

After Shannen was fired, the series took on a new ""direction"" with new cast members and less theatrical storylines. Season 5 was the beginning of the end as far as this classic series is concerned. I stopped watching ""90210"" I guess about a year after Shannen left because I could not relate to any of the other characters. None of them had that charisma, beauty, and talent of Brenda. (By Season 6, I was actually routing for that kook Tara, when she took super-priss Kelly Taylor hostage in that nonsensical ""Single White Female"" rip-off.)

Tori Spelling got incredibly annoying during Season 5. It was like the bigger her b00bs got and the more she bleached her hair the stupider she became. She almost reminded me of Chrissy from ""Three's Company,"" although I don't think even Chrissy Snow was that utterly dumb. I also hated all those stupid temper-tantrums she would have because it was so childish; although it was rather dramatic and funny to watch the Beverly Hills Princess as she became unraveled.

These are the Season 5 Cast Members:
*** Shannen-The Star-Doherty ~ Brenda Walsh  (I know by Season 5 Shannen is gone, I just wanted to include this to plss off everyone who hates her. LOL)
*** Jason Priestley ~ Brandon Walsh
*** Luke Perry ~ Dylan McKay
*** Jennie Garth ~ Kelly the ice-princess Taylor
*** Tori Spelling ~ Donna Martin
*** Ian Ziering ~ Steve Sanders
*** Brian Green ~ David Silver
*** Kathleen Robertson ~ Clare Arnold
*** Ann Gillespie ~ Jackie the reformed cokehead Taylor
*** Tiffani Thiessen ~ Valerie Malone
*** James Eckhouse ~ Jim Walsh
*** Carol Potter ~ Cindy Walsh
*** Gabrielle Carteris ~ Andrea Zuckerman-Vasquez
*** Joe E. Tata ~ Nat Bussichio
*** Jamie Walters ~ Ray Pruit
*** Mark D. Espinoza ~ Jesse the token minority Vasquez

Dylan was also very annoying during Season 5. Wasn't he so incredibly hungry for attention? And when all the hairball things he did didn't work he would get so upset. Wasn't it David that once called him a ""sanctimonious pain in the a-s-s...?"" That describes Mr. McKay perfectly because by Season 5 he was a grotesque and shocking picture of his former outrageous self. Even after he ""cleaned up his act"" he was still boring and not much to look at. (The only good thing about Season 6 is that by then the writers couldn't keep coming up with more foolish stories for him so he takes a hike!)

Who did I like from Season 5? Can you say Brenda Walsh... OK, besides her. Let's see... Ummmmm. Oh, I know. Steve Sanders. Steve is so funny because he never changed and never grew up. And wasn't Ian Ziering totally the Ringo of the group? I always felt bad for him because you could just tell that he got their sloppy seconds (and was glad to get it.) But Steve was cool because he didn't put on airs like the others and he didn't try to be anything but what he was. When I see Ian on Dancing With The Stars, I can't get into him because I still see Steve Sanders.

A Clean Slate 9/21/1994
Alex Diaz (F.J. Rio) theatens to expose Brandon if he doesn't back out of the election. Bran wins the election only to find out that his running mate has been run over and killed! Dylan is stunned to learn that his new leap-frog partner is living at the Walsh Home!

Life After Death 9/28/1994
The new CU President helps Steve out of a pickle at the KEG House. Felice sets up Donna with a friend's son. And, surprise, surprise he's white!!

Homecoming 10/12/1994
A head of an oppressive state comes to CU. Brandon is urged to protest his visit. Meanwhile, Ray and Donna work at his family's pumpkin patch.

Who's Zoomin' Who? 10/19/1994
The Peach Pit is closed. Valerie runs her mouth about Dylan's money problems and as usual Jim Walsh can't keep his nose out of Dylan's affairs. I love how Dylan tells him to go scratch.

Things That Go Bang in the Night 10/26/1994
Valerie learns that her mother's been admitted to a hospital because of mental issues!

Intervention 11/2/1994
The entire gang holds an ""intervention"" for down in the dumps Dylan. Mackenzie Phillips (Julie from ""One Day At a Time"") has a bit part as Counselor Ellen Marks. I love when Steve barks to Dylan: you're not worth the bottle you're trying to crawl out of. So funny and true!

The Dreams of Dylan McKay 11/9/1994
An entire ep is devoted to Dylan's dementia. Maybe we'll all get lucky and these DVDs will be the syndicated eps!

Hate Is Just a Four-Letter Word 11/16/1994
Brandon has to decide what to do when a controversial speaker wants to come to CU. When pushy Andrea throws her hat into the fire, the ep really starts to get good! I love it when that totally ghetto girl calls Andrea a b-i-t-ch. And Zuckerman says ""I don't need that"" in her snobbish Beverly Hills tone that she's now famous for.

The Voodoo That You Do So Well (also known as Rock of Ages) 11/23/1994
This is one of the better eps of the Season. Includes live clips at a Rolling Stones Concert (who knew that rich kids from Beverly Hills liked the Stones?)

Up in Flames 11/30/1994
Emily Valentine (Christine Elise McCarthy) comes into town for a brief visit with Bran. Meanwhile Kelly is caught in a fire with another girl!

Hazardous to Your Health 1/18/1995
Dylan goes to Punta Brava to meet ""Jonesy"" (Wings Hauser,) an informent that he hired to catch Suzanne (Kerrie Keane) and Kevin (David Hayward.) Valerie was so pathetic in this ep. When Dylan calls her she goes running like a little lapdog. With perhaps his only clever remark, Jim Walsh says to Cindy ""she has no shame."" I also thought the entire subplot concerning Erica (Noley Thornton) was so pathetic. Even if her mother and step-father were crooks doesn't mean that Dylan had any right to steal her away; can you say ""kidnap?"" And he doesn't even take her in, instead he dumps her off with Iris because as he put it (in the next ep) ""the two hit it off."" ...Oh yea, I bet any woman would jump at the chance to babysit her ex-hubby's child that he had out of wedlock!

Little Monsters 2/1/1995
Kelly becomes more and more involved with Findley's Group. Dylan pays Val $10,000.00 for her effort but she's not happy with that and runs to ""Jonesy"" for some more dough.

Love Hurts 3/1/1995
David's sleaze-ball friend Lenny (Tracy Fraim) is released from questioning. Donna is almost attacked when a kook gets her keys and sneaks into the beach house apartment!

Unreal World 3/15/1995
David and Clare film the gang in an apparent ""Real World"" knock-off.

Double Jeopardy 3/29/1995
Jesse moves out. Meanwhile, David goes with Donna to Portland in the hopes of seeing his estranged mother.

A Song for My Mother 4/5/1995
This is one of my favorite eps of the Season. Ray gets rough with Donna and pushes her around because he's furious that David came along. David finally finds Sheila (Caroline Lagerfelt) who apparently forgot to take her lithium.

Squash It 4/12/1995
Steve and David put together a rhythm and blues night at the After Dark. Meanwhile Ju'wan (don't you just love that name?) (Vicellous Reon Shannon) makes some waves and learns that violence isn't the answer to solve his problems.

Girls on the Side 5/3/1995
The ice-princess is down in the dumps when she's the Seventeen Magazine covergirl.

The Real McCoy 5/10/1995
Another ludicrous ep dedicated to Dylan's narcissism. Under hypnosis, he learns that a lady who looks exactly like Kelly Taylor was his lover during a past life. YAWN...

Hello Life, Goodbye Beverly Hills 5/17/1995
...Ding-dong the witch is gone! The gang hold a going-away party for Andrea at West Beverly. I love when Ray sarcastically says to Donna ""how many times are you going to say goodbye to her."" Kelly and Bran breakup when she can't choose between him and Dylan. Only a girl like Kelly Taylor would let 2 great guys like that slip through her fingers!

P.S. I Love You 5/24/1995
Cindy and Jim take off for Hong Kong. The gang all go to Palm Springs for a KEG event. Brandon tags along because he's still hurt about the breakup. Meanwhile, Ray gets violent (once again) with Donna and pushes her down the stairs at the resort! ...Dylan is threatened by some men who claim that they knew who blew up Jack McKay. This is a 2-hour ep that airs in 2 parts during syndication.

""90210"" Season 5 taught me 1 very important message. I learned that there are 2 types of people in this world. Those who Love Shannen Doherty and those who Loath her. Which type of person are you?",1208995200,31,11145,4.633688483003551
3410357,2,B0017VG67M,"This season is when things start to unravel both for the characters and for the cast/crew. It's due to a combination of actor decisions and apparent writer changes.

Shannen Doherty had been written out of the series, so Tiffany-Amber Thiessen gets brought on as 'friend' Valerie Malone. At the time Thiessen was also dating Brian Austin Green off camera, which I am sure helped her with the casting priority. Not being biological family, she immediately tries to seduce Brandon. Valerie  is a flirt who will attach herself to anybody she meets---from Steve Sanders to Dylan McKay. Brenda's name is haphazardly thrown around this season, like the script writers weren't sure that their little trick was actually going to work for the long haul/ It's not the 1960's (Bewitched switched out two cast members!) and the Walsh family themselves was supposed to be the backbone of this series.

Episodes where Dylan is depressed because he is broke show Perry's chops as an actor. Disappointed though that Erica was suddenly dumped as possible ensemble character.  Dylan went to all that trouble to rescue her--when the FBI contractor just said that they were only going to recover the money. And then he dumps her with HIS biological mother who she does not know at all?? This would be 'slightly' awkward. Iris is a 'free spirit' but even she would find it awkward to raise the half-daughter of her philandering ex-husband. She could have worked through her PTSD from having been taken to a foreign country.  And didn't Erica have a 'connection' with Dylan?? What happened then? An older brother who already did his own share of brooding would have been a perfect support system!!

Another change is that former teen seductress/nympho, Claire Arnold moves into David's old room at the beach hose. She is suddenly a snorer. Kelly had shared a room with her @ a retreat--but was oddly not kept awake there. And being a chancellor's daughter of a State public university is NOT a big deal as anybody who actually attended college knows. We did not care re the faculty/staffs kids. The only perk they actually might have received was reduced tuition, but that was about it.

The runner up for shoddy episode writing would have to be Donna brushing off Ray smashing her pumpkins and STILL deciding to stay with him. This should have raised serious red flags.  And the other people she lived with definitely should have said something. They ignore it and pretend that things are fine.

Not having much to do 'around the house'  anymore, Jim and Cindy Walsh made a pivotal decision at the end of this season. Jim is going to take another big job--this time overseas in Hong Kong. The Walshes were the whole heart and soul of the series, so their very obvious paring down as recurring characters means that you can skip purchasing this season and subsequent others.  For all purposes, the series ends.",1495065600,,2888,4.849593495934959

I feel like they really upped the ante for the college years, the characters are no longer the same people that they were in high school,  they were not the most popular kids in their freshman year, sophomore year, some of them fell back into some of their high school ways. I believe that the casting people brought in more realistic  guest actor's then in the high school years. The new character's they brought in were great.  Ray was my new favorite male, and still is. I loved Clare and Valerie as well. I did notice that when Dylan came back from his trip to Baja, he seemed to be stalking Kelly.

I noticed that some of the songs were different in earlier seasons, and although a scene or two was ruined because of it, it wasn't anything too terrible.  But this season is another story.  There are songs that are different, and some that are just cut out.  Even scenes are cut out, and some are interrupted in the middle and then the end is just sort of attached, which makes it very confusing if you haven't seen it before.  Now I'm unsure if I ought to bother purchasing anymore seasons because it's such a waste of money. Although I do have the last season, and it seems to be intact- so I probably will take the chance.  I hate it when shows cut things up like this. It's worse than watching it on TV with commercials.",1356912000,,799,4.364864864864865
3410408,3,B0017VG67M,"I'm a big fan of the show, but this is by far the worst seasons with the original cast all still together (well sans Brenda, who apparently has the longest summer drama class...ever). An argument can be made that season 4 was refreshingly underrated, and a contender for the best overall season. So this mixed bag really looks worn down in comparison.

The four things that stand out for me the most from this season:

- The great intro of Valerie Malone. Man did they do a great job getting a Brenda replacement with this girl. The same demographic already knew, and loved her, as ""Saved by the Bell's"" Kelly Kapowski. And they played up that whole goody good image she had on Saved by the Bell only to cleverly smash that image totally in the last glorious pot smoking 30 seconds of the premier episode. That was this season's most defining, and best moment.

- Former frump Andrea Zuckerman goes blonde, loses her Cindy Walsh wardrobe, and reveals a hot girl underneath. I've always liked Andrea, and could see glimpses of a cute girl there, but halfway through season 5 it's like Carteris went to the producers and said ""enough of this crap! If I'm going to be filmed along side all these young girls, you need to give me a leg to stand on!"". It's too bad that they finally let Andrea be youthful and attractive just as she was taking that long ride to Yale, and off our screens.

- Kelly gets burned. Barely. But acts like her entire body was engulfed in an inferno. STFU Kel. I always thought the 90210 producers and writers missed a huge opportunity to push the envelop here by having the hottest girl in the group get her face seriously burned. That, or actually let her explore some same sex feelings with the other girl who was in the fire with her.

- Kelly chooses...Kelly. Shocking.",1344470400,2,1795,4.510769230769231
3410409,5,B0017VG67M,"Being one of the best series of the 90s, the fifth season is no doubt any different than the earlier seasons. They're in college and going through trials and tribulations of adjusting to college life along with their own personal issues. I thoroughly enjoy the reruns and decided it's a must own TV series from my teenage years into college myself. If you've received the first four seasons of the series make sure you continue collecting as the story lines grow deeper between the characters. I recommend the series.

Thanks.",1336176000,4,526,4.844444444444444
3410410,5,B0017VG67M,Season 5 is my favorite season of Beverly Hills 90210. I wish the DVD quality was better though too grainy.,1336003200,,107,4.4
3410411,2,B0017VG67M,"Almost all of the gang is back, plus a new face or three. There's smarmy politico, Brandon Walsh, one time party girl, turned stick-in-the-mud priss, Kelly Taylor, Mickey Rourke wannabe Dylan McKay, fool's fool Steve Sanders, gawky rapper turned videographer David, boring self righteous Andrea and her even more boring husband and yet even more boring baby, weiner-tease Donna Martin, and of course...Nat, who in all likelyhood, is only a few years older than the rest of the cast.

The newcomers are slutty basket case Valerie, one note (and a false note at that) Ray Pruit, and Claire (she was around the previous season actually, but who's counting?) Much happens this year, Dylan lost all his dough, which causes his posture to sink and his hairline to recede, and he spends most of his time drinking coffee when he's not chasing the dragon or shooting plastic skeletons. Brandon becomes school president after his running mate gets burned alive in a car accident. And like most university class presidents, he must face down anti-semitism, and torturing dictators from other countries. The name of this country is Selenisia, where they tortured school custodians in the name of democracy. Do not cry for them though, I am quite certain Selenisia doesn't exist.

Speaking of getting burned alive...Kelly gets, well, burned alive. Not her face. Her arm and neck mostly. Sadly, the stick that seems to have been placed up her keyster this season does not go up in flames. Oh yeah, she joins a cult too.

Valerie was a good idea to bring on the show, but why Claire? She's as dull as one of Andrea's dishrags. I also forgot to mention, Casper Van Dien shows up and gives a very convincing performance...as a Macy's mannequin. And then there's Ray Pruit (his mom could only afford one T) the musician with the personality of a boom mic. Which brings me to, the boom mic! Every once in a while, it just kind of appears, much like all the parents on this show. Just kind of shows up and then goes away. God bless it.

My favorite episode? The Real World one. It is so astonishingly, brilliantly, flabberghastingly awful, it summizes why I love watching the show in the first place. To feel superior to these actors who are prettier and richer than we can ever hope to be. Hey, I never had to humiliate myself in front of a generation!

I wouldnt buy it new thats for sure..look for a cheap used copy...That way if your disapointed you can tell yourself that you didn't waste a lot of money.",1304035200,,640,5.163461538461538
3410413,4,B0017VG67M,This was another great season for Beverly Hills 90210.  I bought it the day it was released just like I do with them all! After watching the season a couple times it seems like they cut out all the scenes with Ray (Donna's boyfriend) performing?  When I watched the show back in the 90's I remember seeing him perform on the show a lot.  In this season he sings one of his songs for about 10 seconds in the episode when they all go to the Rolling Stones concert.  And if you pay attention you will notice in some of the episodes he is just about to go on stage and then the next scene the concert is over so you never see him performing.  I love watching all of my favorite old shows from the 80's & 90's but I can't stand it when they cut stuff out.  Did anyone else notice that?,1301356800,2,780,4.032467532467533
3410414,1,B0017VG67M,Well i was excited for this to come in but when i got it one of the disc was cracked and i'd like to get it for free i think its fair..,1295049600,,135,3.25
3410415,4,B0017VG67M,"Not as dramatic as the past season, Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five was still addicting to watch as usual. I didn't have a particular favorite of any episode during the season, and I thought that some of them in Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five have become unrealistic in the worst way possible. Now, let's get started with the characters of the cast. Brandon Walsh...ah, yes...the inveterate hypocrite. Of course, I've written before that politics was so him last season, and he showed his true colors as well in season five. Speaking of unrealistic, Brandon Walsh managed to get away with his traffic stop bust in the final episode when he was an underage drinker, in possession of a joint (regardless of the fact he wasn't smoking it), and already had prior (should have) convictions of DUI and reckless driving. There was no wonder why the writers want the audience to believe that Brandon is on his way to sainthood (yeah, right). Then, he cheated on his girlfriend Kelly Taylor by staying over the night with Emily Valentine (Ugh...what's with her hairdo? Bring back the yellow, please.) during the night of the fire at the party house. Finally, in the end, he pressured Kelly to marry him before they are both 21 years old. When Kelly rejected his proposal, Brandon turned down a relationship with Kelly for gosh-knows-what-reasons and ended up necking with the ever bad girl Valerie Malone. Ew...but very realistic for him though. Moving on to Valerie Malone, played by the newcomer Tiffani-Amber Thiessen...now what would Zack Morris think of? It was a shock at first for many viewers accustomed to seeing her as the always nice, beautiful Kelly Kapowski from Saved by the Bell, but she really did an awesome job shedding away the perfect image of herself and becoming the worst enemy possible in Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five. Of course, she was also an enigma...at times, you like her, and then, she does the 180 degree in an instant. I have to say that she is a girl of many talents, meaning that she could have made things easier if she would find a rich guy in Beverly Hills and marry him for the money. As far as to the end of season five, I am very confused about her motives, but does it have anything to do with the suicide of her father? We shall see in next season. By the way, I am very disappointed that she got her name in the opening credits right away when Joe Tata, working on the show for four seasons, was still not in there yet. Elsewhere, Kelly Taylor made her case for being the most likeable character of the show, and she had matured the most. I found her intelligent yet confused about her identity, and her way of dealing with issues around her had made the show highly interesting to watch. She made the right choice by turning down Dylan and Brandon; she deserved better, and neither deserved her. I was pleasantly surprised in one episode when she confessed to Donna that Dylan ""is one of the most self-centered people on the planet Earth and according to him, he's been that way for several lifetimes."" I couldn't agree with her more. That will always stand out of the best lines of the entire show. Dylan McKay...what can I say? He certainly made the show interesting as well...but he had to be the dumbest of all characters with probably an exception of Donna Martin. Sure, he reads literature and quotes lines from poems, but he doesn't come across to me as an intellectual. Far from it. The sanest thing he could have made with his life is to sell the house, move out of Beverly Hills, and live somewhere else in a quiet existence. The only rational reason for his depression and getting into alcohol and drug fueled binge is because he was facing the possibility of having to work for the rest of his life (aw, poor Dylanie, too over-privileged, ain't he?). Speaking of intellectuals, how about Brandon attempting to make into Jeopardy!? *blows raspberries* yeah right...he didn't even know what the Mendoza Line (a very common term) was. That's another case of character manipulation. Poor Donna, she hadn't changed much except for her wardrobe. She is a very nice girl, but in some of the outfits she wore, she dressed practically like a hooker and was one step away from patrolling Sunset Strip and asking Johns to pick her up. Honestly, nobody ever in her right mind would wear such clothes like them for regular outings. Her relationship with Ray Pruit had grown tiresome and didn't result in a breakup after the end of Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five. Jamie Walters' character is a sad case of character manipulation as he was portrayed as an abusive boyfriend and a cheater. For somebody from the wrong side of the tracks, it would be nice to show him as a honest, decent person just for once. He was actually that way from the beginning until things started to go very wrong. Nonetheless, I agreed a lot with what Ray Pruit had been saying all along, and it can be very tedious to date a girl who seemed to be married to her friends. Worse than that, it can be extremely impossible to have a relationship with a girl who vowed celibacy until marriage. That's just not possible in late 20th century while everybody is in prime of their lives. Moreover, it doesn't help matters any if Donna keeps dressing like a hooker. Her mother may have topped Brenda Walsh as the most hated character of the series. The moment that she was bringing up the interracial mix with D'Shawn, my eyes literally rolled. Then, it got worse when she attempted to pay Ray off. It's easy to see how Donna is being controlled by her mother. Steve Sanders, nothing is ever new with him. He is the same old himself. I still like him regardless of the million faults he has accrued over the years. Good going for Jesse to set Steve straight after telling a story of how the system works for some and not for others. Pretty selfish of Steve to think he got robbed of his silly ambitions. Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five is the final one for four characters: Andrea Zuckerman, Jesse Vasquez, and Cindy and Jim Walsh. I never cared for nor liked Andrea, and I found her full of herself. It's like...give her an issue, and she'll go nuts about it. Too much for me. She was also a hypocrite just like his pal Brandon. Her marriage should have died after she cheated on Jesse, and she didn't deserve him. As for Jesse, I liked him a lot, and now, for the unrealistic part thrown in by the writers for the sake of leverage, I was appalled by the character manipulation by making Jesse an equally culpable member for having committed adultery. I will not believe that for a second because hadn't he done it, that makes Andrea to be the bad person, and deservingly so, in the relationship. Thus, the divorce will be a fait accompli. At the rate Jesse was going by with his work, it was very evident that his mind was on building up his family while undertaking a very serious step forward with his career. That always happens, and he is too busy to be doing something so silly as to sleep with somebody else at that critical juncture of his life. Cindy and Jim Walsh, too bad...it's over for them. They were easily my favorite characters of Beverly Hills 90210, and they were excellent in their roles. Just perfect. Too bad they didn't get the chance to punish their children the way they deserved to be. Oh...I haven't mentioned Brenda Walsh. Who cares? Good riddance. David, hm...nothing changes about him. He is boring as usual. Ditto for Clare. I think the only reason why she got on the show is because of her overdone lips. Other than that, she had a horrible snobbish attitude that I found it unpleasant to watch. Speaking of cheating, that aspect was way overplayed throughout the entire season of Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five. That's when the show started to lose a lot of credibility. The probability of seeing so many characters cheating on the significant other was too high for a series that it became too unrealistic. Let's keep track of who was cheating on who: Dylan on Brenda with Kelly, Kelly on Dylan with Brandon, David on Donna with Ariel, Donna on Ray with Griffin and also on Griffin with Ray, Donna on Ray with Brandon (now...what was that??? Ray would have blown three fuses in his mind had he knew about the scene for the Valentine telethon), Brandon on Kelly with Donna, Brandon on Kelly with Emily, Ray on Donna with Valerie, Cindy on Jim with a photographer (can't remember his name), Steve on Celeste with a Date Rape accuser (can't remember her name either), Andrea on Dan Rubin with Jesse, Andrea on Jesse with Peter, Brenda on Dylan with Rick, and Valerie on everybody with everybody else. Ridiculous. Speaking of that, what a waste of time to watch Dylan's dreams. They were useless and didn't amount to anything in the end because we already knew that he always wanted Kelly. Now, for Brandon acting as the president of the student population at California University....I've attended many schools in the past decade, but not one of them that I found the student president an important person. And I knew neither the name of one in any school. Incorrectly in one of the episodes of season five, no student president has a say when it comes to tuition rate in any college; that's up to the board of trustees and/or whoever else with authority. As for the ""brainwashing"" part with Kelly Taylor and New Evolution, I thought what she was doing was fine, but the one she was in that was found to be a fraud shouldn't have deterred her from looking for another program, a safer one. She was still traumatized about what happened to her and Allison in the fire. I noticed how religious season five had gotten, and I was getting nauseous during them. Tone it down, please. One episode that I found the most dramatic of season five was the fire where Kelly and Allison were trapped in the basement. As I know that they got very scared, they should have thought of splashing water into themselves and soaking their clothes from the sink, if the shower wasn't there on the left side of them (I couldn't see it; if there was one, take off the clothes and stay in the shower, running cold water on themselves the entire time until the firemen come). That would have been a huge help for them as far as being inflamed goes. Despite the many negatives of the show, I really found the handling of the many characters in so many parallel ways genius and clever and the storylines to be the best feature. They were so interesting that the series ended up to be addicting to watch. I am glad they had recurring characters, but the show remains too white for me. Speaking of whiteness, I think it was demeaning that the writers still portrayed many characters, especially Jesse, of different races to be flawed in a bad way. There must be plenty of characters, white or not, that are really good people, and I am not seeing it that much in season five. I am starting to notice the fashion on many characters, and I liked them all save a few. Ray's choice of wardrobe is pretty good and interesting to me, not too flashy but simple. Some of the episodes are annoying in the DVD because of the cut out scenes, most notably Jamie Walters' music. It is always so remarkable to me how well every character has recovered from any dramatic episode in their lives and never be in state of depression, further heightening the lack of realism of the show. One more great scene occurs when Brandon and Dylan are invited into a sweat lodge with Native Americans. That ranks among the best scenes. Speaking of musicians, as soon as I saw Jade in one episode, I admit...I've never heard of them before and don't see them as a popular band. All in all, Beverly Hills 90210: Season Five is addicting to watch but is losing steam with unrealistic set ups of subplots.",1292198400,,11788,4.584557081951682

3410425,4,B0017VG67M,"I recently picked up this set of 90210 and enjoyed reliving it for the first time since it went off air back in 2000. I wasn't a die hard fan of the show back in the day but I did watch quite regularly... really I was more into Melrose place, 90210's sister show. Still, I did watch this show regularly...

The early years of the show (seasons 1-4) were huge culture events for young people all over the world in the 90's, they struck a chord because of the willingness to tackle many issues ... drugs, alcohol, etc. Whilst I did watch the show during these seasons , I really enjoyed watching the show more in the later years ... starting with this season, my first to purchase on dvd.

This season saw a shift from being a little on the preachy, educational side in the early years to a more entertaining (for me anyway) melodrama, the focus was less on issues and more on relationships this year... a lot of people didn't like this switching of gears. But I did, and if you liked the more soapy feel of later 90210, then you will enjoy this season for sure..

We knew the characters so well by now having watched them grow in previous seasons and we really cared about them as an audience, they all had that likeability factor that is crucial to any hit show. So, it was nice to see the characters blossom further this year in preparation for the real world after college.

Shaneen Doherty had been fired after year 4, but my they struck gold with the introduction of bad girl Valerie this year, she was edgier and more entertaining to watch than spoilt Brenda ever was. Valerie was developed slowly this season and it was a hoot to watch her pretending to be nicey-nice at first to the walshes and the gang before becoming a bitch that you actually rooted for in ways.. she was the new star of the show.

As for the rest of the gang, donna developed nicely pursuing new relationships with guys like griffin and ray... having moved on from david, david coupled up with Clare Arnold  and the two were a welcome comedic duo, clare has many great lines... steve was steve... moving from one hair brained idea/ scheme to the next, Brandon remained the moral anchor of the show and his relationship with Kelly was only starting out, Dylan went off the rails then back on them and spent the rest of the season pining in the background for Kelly, Andrea and jessy were doomed from the start and drifted apart slowly before bowing out of the show , also cindy and jim depart by season end.

All in all, this season is a good buy, it's light and fluffy in many ways, the odd issue crops up here and there and is played out  through character's dilemmas  but mostly its just nice to relive the stories/lives of old faces that we knew and loved.
(By the way, a lot of people complained that the music has been changed in many episodes, I didn't notice honestly , it definitely didn't effect my enjoyment of the show). Enjoy!",1229212800,,2916,4.39517625231911
3410426,3,B0017VG67M,"Where do I start with the bad? Setting aside the cheap and dismissive packaging for a moment, I begin with the hack-job they did on the show itself. Not only is the soundtrack COMPLETELY different (and it does suck), but any footage of Ray Pruit playing with his band has been cut out. That leaves us with about 2 rousing performances, including Ray singing, ""the Worms Crawl In, the Worms Crawl Out..."" to a bunch of kids at the KEG house Halloween party. Looks like David really had some pull in post production and got Ray completely taken off the PPAD roster for good. Now onto the soundtrack...you know, the music that plays in the background during the show? After watching the same episodes for years, I have come to memorize and appreciate certain scenes for their appropriately chosen musical accompaniments. Well, they're gone now. 2 notable disappointments: Episode 1: Kelly & Donna at the salon before the make up. The song should be The Pretenders, ""It's Just the Night in My Veins."" Now it's something else that wrong & crappy. And the other is the episode where David, Donna & Clare do the video with everyone sleeping around campus. Should be L7's ""Pretend We're Dead"", which actually suits the video, but no...

Why then 3 stars? Because, this is still one of the best seasons out there (second only to season 6.) The fire, the PPAD is born, Kelly joins a cult, Dylan does heroin and almost dies, then goes to Mexico and swindles his millions back from Kevin & Suzanne, in a word- Val, the ""Real Life"" episode, the great bear heist, and finally, the Walshes and Andrea leave (thank God!)

The bottom line? Buy at your own risk. The soul has been sucked from this show but it's still season 5 of 90210 (sort of.)",1225584000,6,1728,4.607142857142857

I loved season 5, but like many others, was very disappointed by Ray's missing scenes and the constant music changes. I understand they do not have the rights to the music for the DVDs because the musicians were only payed for the original airing and syndication. I really wish they could work something out with the artists because this is a huge show, and hearing songs on TV really prompts users to download the songs on ITUNES.

I was also really let down that there was no special features. I think the segment, ""Everything You Need to Know About 90210"" is absolutely hilarious. I was so sad there was not one for season 5. Keeping my fingers crossed the rest of the seasons will at least have that one special feature!

I'm definitely looking forward to season 6, even though Luke Perry makes his exit..",1222128000,2,953,4.378531073446328
3410428,5,B0017VG67M,"I was in my late teens when this show was on and loved it so naturally when it finally became available on DVD, I am buying each season as it comes out. I loved the series. The new 90210 on TV now cannot hold a candle to the old 90210.",1221868800,,235,3.72
3410429,3,B0017VG67M,"Ok, I don't want to be negative about this show...or a traitor to my generation... I love Bev Hills 90210! I was a sophmore in high school when they were, at the shows start, and we were the same age and we grew up together. I watched (and taped) every episode for the whole 10 years... but those VHS tapes wear out, so imagine my joy when the DVD set came out... or not...

As I said, I have taped every episode, and I watch it now on Soapnet... and as you know like watching your favorite movie over and over, you can ""talk along with the movie""... well I am that way with this show. I now know (but didn't until after having bought the first 2 seasons) that the box says in fine print on the back of the box that ""MUSIC HAS BEEN CHANGED FOR THIS HOME ENTERTAINMENT VERSION. SOME EPISODES MAY BE EDITED FROM THEIR ORIGINAL NETWORK VERSIONS."", but come on!!! I noticed a wierd edit in another season episode and a spot here and there, not to mention in season one when all the girls have a slumber party and are signing along to ""Mony Mony"" but now the music is different... but The Senior Prom episode was seriously butchered! There were major parts gone... not to mention Cathy Dennis sang 2 songs at the prom and they cut the whole second song out, along with shots of her and most of the actors lines that were said during that song. I am very disappointed in this. The prom episode was a great one, not to mention a pivital part of the season. Part of the greatness of 90210 was the fact that they used new, up to date music for every episode.

Come on FOX... how cheap are you? We are all paying $40 or more for a set that probably costs $5 to make... You couldn't shell out some cash to keep this amazingly cool show intact in it's original condition??? And what are you going to do in future seasons??? There were tons of episodes later on in the Peach Pit After Dark where a famous music group plays there... are those hour long episodes going to be edited down to a half hour show?

So, before you start sending me hate email, let me say this:
My review comes to this = Yes, I love the show and Yes, I have and probably will buy every season on DVD. But Yes, I am disappointed in the editing. So to all of you die hard fans like me... be aware of this before you buy and watch it, so you aren't completly disappointed like I was when I first bought and watched them. Maybe they will get this figured out and stop their ""editing"" or ""ruining"" our favorite show!!!

***Ok, if you read alot of reviews... you may recognize I wrote this above exact review above for season 3. Well, my questions were answered. I am watching season 5 now, and the group Jade made an appearance. Yes, they did show them sing one song, but they cut out all of the other spots in the show where they appeared. Not to mention that the Ray Pruet character sang on the show quite a bit, but so far thru disc 6 I have not heard one note... one episode they cut almost 5 minutes of an episode just to avoid showing him singing. This is getting ridiculous... should we be boycotting? Maybe we all should just stop buying these DVD's and watch the reruns on soapnet until they quit messing up our show and put the full versions out for all of us hard core fans! Anybody with me on this?***",1219795200,20,3268,4.1907790143084265

But for the 5th season DVD pack there are no extras!!!! That is the only reason I am giving 4 stars out of 5. I really miss the funny season recap.

5th season is great. Finally without Brenda, but with a new character Valerie, oh how much I hate her!!! She is the perfect B***!",1218585600,,411,4.189873417721519

I think CBS/Paramount is doing a great job releasing the show on DVD, dispite the music changes.  I hope Season 6 gets released soon, maybe for the Holidays of 2008.

3410436,5,B0017VG67M,"Brenda Shmenda... she was irrelevent in Season 4. A total bore... to be honest with you Season 3 and 4 weren't very amazing. They were really slipping. A lot of important things happened however it was filled with a lot of unimportant hours. The whole relationship of Kelly and Dylan was so over hyped. All they did was argue and there were like 1 or 2 times they were actually happy. Im not even sure they went through one episode without fighting.

When Season 5 came along and get Brenda the hell out of there they finally got serious. The stories were so much more adult and the acting was incredible!

Brandon was top notch!
Nobody can top Dylans amazing performance as a herion addict and drunk!
Kelly was even going through a lot and did it well.
Donna was likeable!
CLAIR CLAIR CLAIR! OMG she's a real regular now! The show just got 2wice as good as it woulda been with just Val!
Andrea... boring
Jessie boring... thank God they left this season...
David was really cool in this Season!

Just great stuff! If you're gonna get any season get this one!",1215648000,5,1058,4.471502590673575
