6751830,5,B00OIKJK4U,"Some interesting facts from Ty Hardin's Bio

Date of Birth 1 January 1930, New York City, New York, USA
Birth Name Jr. Orison Whipple Hungerford

After his acting career faded away, Ty Hardin became a self-proclaimed ""freedom fighter"" in the 1970s, and led a radical right-wing group called The Arizona Patriots, an anti-Semitic/anti-immigrant/anti-black group with a penchant for stockpiling weapons and baiting public officials.

In 1986, following a two-year FBI undercover investigation, agents from the FBI and ATF raided an Arizona Patriot camp and confiscated a hoard of illegal weapons and publications from Aryan Nation groups and affiliates. Hardin left Arizona, and the group soon ceased to function.

8683767,5,B00OIKJK4U,"The second season of the classic television western starring the incomparable Ty Hardin as the itinerant avenger, ""Texas Twister"" Bronco Lane. This Warner series chronicles the adventures of a good- natured drifter who's slow to anger, but who always stands his ground when he's pushed too far. The show is an anthology, with different guest stars every week, and usually begins with Broncos arriving in a new location, only to fall into some situation which requires his able assistance to sort out. For those who are accustomed to today's more cynical heroes, Broncos  will be a true revelation! He's cheerful, optimistic, unfailingly polite, and always looking for the good in people, without ever being a pushover or a chump.  If you remember, or grew up with this show, you owe it to yourself to become reacquainted with it; you won't be disappointed! If not, do yourself a favor and get a look at what a real hero looks like. You'll be ""much obliged""!",1484179200,2,957,4.865030674846626
