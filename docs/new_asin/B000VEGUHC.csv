2940210,5,B000VEGUHC,Loved it. Worth watching.,1411516800,,25,5.5
2940211,5,B000VEGUHC,"very revealing documentary about the capture of cetaceans. very disgusted to see and hear about wild animals being separated from their families and natural habitat, and placed in prisons so greedy corporations like Seaworld can make a buck. these people are no different from slave traders and human traffickers. they have no decency!",1410566400,3,335,5.339622641509434
2940212,5,B000VEGUHC,"The lethal stats says it all. Multiple trainer deaths from disgruntled, maladjusted intelligent ""prisoners"".  The orcas have only around 40% lifespan in captivity. The incredible levels of skullduggery  and deceit perpetrated by such firms as Sea World are disgusting. A real paradigm change is needed to allow only creatures in need of rehab, than back to the wild as is suggested.",1410393600,4,382,5.245901639344262
2940213,5,B000VEGUHC,"This is a powerful follow up on ""The Cove"" It reveals the controversial captive whale business. Starring Mike Farrell and Keiko the Whale. Note: Orcas are really the largest of the dolphin family. I highly recommend this. Also there is another title I highly recommend.
""Keiko The Untold Story of the Star of Free Willy"" and ""Lolita: Slave to Entertainment"" Orca Sea life belong in their natural home where God created them to be. Not in a concrete tank for Man's entertainment. I also highly recommend ""Blackfish""",1403913600,9,514,4.919540229885057
2940214,3,B000VEGUHC,"I am the producer of A Fall From Freedom. This film is an historical perspective of the captive industry. OF COURSE much of the footage will be dated. I don't think they had HD in the 70s or 80s, even the 90s, do you? If you want a refund, email me at the address on the DVD and I will be more than happy to refund your money.",1399507200,8,326,3.8088235294117645
2940215,2,B000VEGUHC,"This movie was done very poorly,the picture quality was horrible,for the price it wasn't worth it a real waste of money. Yes the plight of these animals is down right criminal,and something more should be done about it,  it's all greed. But as far as what i thought about the of the movie i fast forwarded most of it because it was done so poorly. Most of these films are of poor quality,except HD.",1389484800,2,398,4.378378378378378
2940216,5,B000VEGUHC,"I've recently become interested in the plight of captive marine mammals around the world. I'm watching and reading everything I can find to educate myself. I hate to be a proponent of something without having all the information available, and I'm slowly, methodically getting there. All cetaceans are sentient beings, and Killer Whales are perhaps more so than human beings. As a non-scientific individual, the biggest difference I can make is sharing what I'm learning with anyone who'll listen and asking them to spend their entertainment dollars anywhere BUT with businesses who make money off captive marine mammals. This movie added to my knowledge, and anyone who feels a responsibility to the other lifeforms we share this planet with needs to watch it. I'm daily horrified by what man feels he has the right to do to other men, animals, and the planet he inhabits.",1389484800,19,873,5.027586206896552
2940217,5,B000VEGUHC,"When I watched The Cove documentary, the disturbing part was how could a group of people in this case Japanese, slaughter few hundred dolphins at a time and no one in their country would be outraged by their actions... The Cove documentary discusses Sea World but to understand the impact of the Sea World, an American business on dolphins, killer whales, etc. as well as the Japanese, you need to watch this documentary called ""A Fall From Freedom"". The same way that many humans and businesses are nothing but disgrace, the fact is that there are businesses, like Monterey Aquarium which happens to be the most visited aquarium with no whales or dolphins that are a good asset and help to both marine and human life by protecting nature and educating the society in the most compassionate and caring way possible. Now the Japanese Navy accompanies the whale killing vessels in Antarctica so Japan can kill thousands of whales in the name of research without fear of being stopped by the environmentalists. Bravo.",1330128000,7,1014,4.867052023121388
2940218,5,B000VEGUHC,"""A Fall from Freedom"" is one of those masterful DVDs that kind of hides in the background of small-market productions.  It contains knowledge that will haunt you, which MUST be seen.

50 minutes of detail regarding the dolphin captivity industry, including graphic detail of Japan's dolphin hunt and capture operations, SeaWorld's deception and miseducation, and interviews with a number of key people in the world of dolphins on both the good and bad sides of the spectrum; Ric O'Barry (good) and Jay Sweeney (bad).

You'll see videos of bloody dolphin captures, dismal holding tanks, sugar-coated aquarium shows, and, most importantly, the reality of what happens to dolphins sought for confinement.

Very well put-together, like I said - graphic details, not easy to watch at times.  A must-see.",1194912000,14,798,5.251968503937008
8218461,4,B000VEGUHC,Very interesting. Sad. But good.,1484611200,,32,5.6
8218462,5,B000VEGUHC,"As a child and now as adult I love Sea World but I know and agree that the message in this documentary is true. I really thought this documentary was more informative than the cove or blackfish. Thank you for making the film, I learned a lot more from this film than I knew before. I do hope that Sea World in the future can be a rehabilitation place for injured animals.",1477612800,,371,4.166666666666667
8218463,1,B000VEGUHC,Awful and boring,1459209600,,16,4.666666666666667
8218464,5,B000VEGUHC,What an incredible documentary. I highly recommend this for anyone who is interested in learning more about what really happens to animals in our sea.,1458259200,,150,5.04
8218465,5,B000VEGUHC,"Very informative DVD, gives many examples of why captivity is wrong for these animals. Heartbreaking.",1457049600,,101,5.8
8218466,5,B000VEGUHC,yes it  good,1454284800,,12,3.0
