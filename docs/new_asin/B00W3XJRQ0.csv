8712054,5,B00W3XJRQ0,"Awesome presentation!! Dave has taken all the great ""learnings"" from great inspirational speakers and blended them into his coaching expertise to make a presentation that is very informative, yet easy to watch. I have spent time face to face with Zig Ziglar, Stephen Covey, and Dennis Waitley and find Dave to be every bit as informative. He delivers a great message with facts that make it very believable and gives the viewer the tools to become better at whatever they do in life.",1430697600,,483,4.831325301204819
