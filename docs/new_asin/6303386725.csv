642832,4,6303386725,As a fan of Criterion style films I liked it.  The print was not that good even though I watched the HD version.,1419897600,,112,3.869565217391304
642833,5,6303386725,"Vengeance is Mine is the kind of film Martin Scorsese would make if he were born and raised in Japan - it depicts the life of a brutal, remorseless, serial killer. Heck, the serial killer is even raised Roman Catholic, in a country with few Christians - and therefore has that built-in catholic guilt-redemption thing going for it.  The fact that the film is based on actual events makes it even more brutal.

However, even though there are a few scenes of extreme violence, most of the film is that of a more thoughtful look at the killer's childhood and young adulthood, full of unhappiness and strife.  Much of the film concerns the police hunt for the killer during a span of about three months when he was on the lam from authorities.  Well-filmed, well-acted.  Not your average Hollywood-style crime movie, this one is made with real feeling and quality.",1287532800,3,860,4.706666666666667
642834,5,6303386725,"On January 4, 1964, a convoy of patrol cars traverse a provincial countryside to escort captured criminal Iwao Enokizu (Ken Ogata) to the local police precinct for interrogation. Callous and unremorseful, Enokizu laments his inevitable fate as unfair, citing that his arresting officers will outlive him and continue the pursuit of hedonistic pleasure now denied him. The indignant and self-absorbed Enokizu refuses to answer questions that will aid the police trace his fugitive steps from the first inexplicable murders a few months earlier, on October 18, when Enokizu decided to murder his coworkers, an affable deliveryman named Tanejiro Shibata, and the quiet, unassuming driver, Daihachi Baba. Despite his unwillingness to cooperate, the police investigation has uncovered an accurate, albeit unsettling, account of Enokizu's destructive path. His mistress provides a glimpse into his insatiable sexual appetite and emotional cruelty. His father, Shizuo Enokizu (Rentaro Mikuni), recounts a difficult episode in the summer of 1938 when a Japanese officer humiliated Shizuo, and his seeming cowardice causes a lifelong animosity and estrangement with the young and impressionable Iwao. Enokizu's neglected wife Kazuko (Mitsuko Baisho) has left him, but agrees to return at his father's request, only to be accused of having an affair with Shizuo. Driven away by his family and determined to evade the authorities, Enokizu moves into the Asano Inn, a secluded retreat near a cemetery that is managed by a trusting, repressed innkeeper named Haru (Mayumi Ogawa) and her interfering, eccentric mother, Hisano (Nijiko Kiyokawa) who reputedly spies on all the guests. Posing as a benevolent university professor, Enokizu continues his destructive double life of theft, swindles, and senseless murders.

Based on the true story of convicted murderer, Iwao Enokizu, Shohei Imamura creates a harrowing, bizarre, and fascinating chronicle of aberrant, self-destructive behavior in Vengeance is Mine. Combining the naturalistic, frenetic elements of documentary filmmaking with the stylization of elliptical narrative, Imamura creates a chaotic and fragmented portrait of a serial killer: the disorganized and awkward execution of the murders; the achronologic temporal leaps in the narrative structure; the rapid, cinma vrit styled camerawork as Enokizu checks into the Asano Inn. In essence, the disjointed appearance of the film reflects the underlying dark soul of the inscrutable and amoral Enoziku. In a puzzling, surreal final scene, Shizuo and Kazuko travel to the top of a mountain in an attempt to bring closure to Enoziku's misguided life only to find their actions thwarted by an irrepressible, divine force - a cruel final reminder of the inescapability of justice and retribution.",1271808000,,2790,5.658711217183771
642835,5,6303386725,"Shohei Imamura's reputation is growing in my mind the more films I see by him. I recently saw the impressive 1979 film Vengeance Is Mine (a film that is included in Roger Ebert's Great Films). It has an impressive performance by the lead actor Ken Ogata (who would go on tot star in several other later Imamura productions) as Iwao Enokizu a thief, con man, lady-killer, and murderer who went on a 78-day killing spree throughout Japan. The events are based on a true story. This film contains many of the themes that have come to be associated with Imamura-lower class criminals, prostitutes, incest, and tortured criminals. Enokizu is unrepentant killer who felt no remorse for his crimes, but is essentially a coward who killed weak people rather than those who he hated like his father and his mistresses sadistic lover. Thus, Enokizu doesn't get his vengeance, but the title refers to a quote from the bible that suggests that it is god that gets vengeance in the end. Enokizu has been brought up as a catholic, but it has never stopped him from committing transgressions. Instead it is his father who holds out against taking Enokizu's discarded wife as a mistress until his wife dies. He holds himself responsible for Enokizu's transgressions. At the end there is an odd Imamura touch to the film where the killer's father and ex-wife travel to a mountain to throw his bones from the cremation from the peak only to have them suspended in air as if the earth is rejecting his evil remains.",1268092800,,1496,4.735632183908046
642836,5,6303386725,"Shohei Imamura's Vengeance is Mine is savage, coldblooded, intense, and one of the best foreign films ive seen in a while. It tells the true story of Iwao Enokizu, played by Ken Ogata. The film begins with his capture by the police and then traces the events of his life. Enokizu, you see, is a vicious serial killer and thief. The Devil incarnate. The film deals with complex issues concerning the nature of fate, evil, psychosis and immorality. As you watch this film you're torn between feeling absolute repulsion toward Enokizu and yet some kind of sympathy, and that was what i liked about the nature of this film. No easy answers at all. Great film, but be prepared.",1233100800,3,672,4.65546218487395
642837,5,6303386725,"We like killers.  Not your run-of-the-mill murderer thugs or violence-prone thieves who kill for profit, but the inverted psyche of serial killers is a fascinating subject.  They hold the fascination of a predator species, like the great white shark or the alligator, dangerous and somehow cool.  We don't want to meet them, and hope to god that they never walk though our door, but from the safety of a screen it is a thrill to flirt with their danger and ride along with them for a little while down a truly dark path.  Especially in the hands of a master director like Shohei Imamura.

""Vengeance is Mine"" (""Fukushu suruwa wareniari"") is Imamura's take on Japanese serial killer and fraudster Akira Nishiguchi who went on a 78-day killing spree in 1964, claiming the lives of five people before being captured.  Re-named to Iwao Enokizu in the film, he is a cold and reptilian character, able to lie and murder without any apparent shadow of a conscious, only taking the actions that advance his needs at any given moment.  A rare Catholic in Japan, Iwao is an outsider, but not a loner, and he keeps companions for as long as he needs them.

Considering the source material, Imamura maintains an almost documentary-like feel throughout the film, as emotionless and reptilian as the killer himself.  This is not the ""serial killer as hero"" motif of ""Natural Born Killers"", or even an attempt to explain and empathize as in ""Monster"".  The camera takes no opinions, offers no point of view other than ""These things happen"", ""This is life, and these things happen"".  The beast that is Iwao seems to take neither pleasure nor pain, just sensation, from his activities.  He plays his game without passion, and that makes it all the more chilling.

The Criterion Collection DVD maintains the usual high standards expected, with two interviews with Imamura, and an essay by critic Michael Atkinson.  The picture and sound are all of the best quality, and the film is pure 5-star Imamura.",1196726400,8,1984,4.831360946745562
642838,4,6303386725,"A film which holds your attention for all of its 140minutes, Vengeance is Mine prompts the audience to consider the question of art and reality.  Art, given that cinema is accepted as a significant art form, cannot replicate reality in any way, though it can create a semblance of reality.  Visually, Andy Warhol tried to replicate time in cinema in his film of the Empire State building.  In his way, Director Imamura tries to replicate the reality of human feelings in a range of ordinary Japanese which is to say, the characters are not depicted in any sentimental or romantic way, but revealed, as one of the characters says ""as animals"", as ""human animals"" driven by their appetites, by greed, by envy. Sex and death feature prominently as subjects throughout the film and Imamura draws the connection between erotic feelings and death quite remarkably well. It is a cinema of the power and beauty of the themes of sex and death, and whilst there are the signs of civilization, in particular the influence of Christianity, the raw depiction of human appetites dominates the film with considerable visual power.  The characters seem to give into their feelings and needs even when faced with the horror of a multiple murderer - Iwao's lover just wants to serve him and service him, whilst the police are drawn to his wit and charm - characters divorced of any moral compass.  A brilliant work.",1193011200,3,1397,4.828451882845188
642839,5,6303386725,"Again, Shohei Imamura's total control of his craft shows itself in his brutal masterpiece Vengeance Is Mine. This true story follows Iwao Enokizu (Ken Ogata), a con artist, thief and killer. The film starts with Enokizu's capture and uses unusual, but brilliantly effective editing and pacing to unravel the story of his life. We see Enokizu as a troubled boy in a strict Catholic home and turn into a scam artist and womanizer. As an adult Enokizu's resentment towards his religous father is compounded by rumors of an affair with the father and Enokizu's wife. As his hatered grows stronger and his crimes become more serious, we see first hand Enokizu's downward spiral into murder and the devastating consequences for those around him.

The disturbing nature of this film doesn't lie in it's gore factor (there are very few actual murder scenes), but rather with the non-judgemental view taken of the killer. Imamura neither glorifies nor condems Enokizu. He simply lets the character exist, and lets his inherent nihilism reveal itself. This nihilism is something that both Enokizu and the audience must grapple with throughout the film. Ultimately, Enokizu can only kill innocent people, being too much of a coward to face those he truly hates. This is fully realized in two emotionally gutwrenching scenes at the end of the film; one with Enokizu's lover and another with his father.

The family drama, the cat-and-mouse game between Enokizu and the cops,  and some interesting third-act revalations make this two hour plus film quite an undertaking. Don't watch it while making dinner. But with the great acting (Ken Ogata especially), outstanding editing, interesting shooting locations and masterful direction, Imamura takes this messy story and turns it into an artistic, esoteric thriller. A sort of japanese Taxi Driver. The ending is pure Imamura; a poetic farewell to Enokizu that is both eerily enigmatic and profoundly meaningful.",1180224000,28,1947,5.194267515923567
642840,4,6303386725,"In the beginning of Vengeance, there is a key scene of the film's main character. He is unrinating, in order to wash his hands off the blood of his victim. He then notices he's under a tree, wipes his hands with his jacket and picks an apple. He takes a bite and spits.
However, the point -we understand as the story unfolds engrossingly to contain many other characters in similarly true moments- is in fact to lay bare the human soul.
Immamura achieves very successfuly this main objective, through his immense storytelling powers: the over the top performances he pulls from his superb cast and his brilliant melding of the many subplots.(The editing here, in my opinion, is one the best works ever done in a movie.)
In a little over two hours, Vengeance speaks volumes about the many complexities of the human soul and offers many opportunities to confront its dark side. Thus, it is not an easy movie to watch. Yet it offers many insights to the Japanese culture, and is a great point to start knowing the Japanese cinema as well. Highly recommended.",1014336000,12,1055,4.67741935483871
7846458,5,6303386725,"This 1979 film details the violent career of Akira Nishiguchi, who committed a series of murders in Japan in late 1963 and early 1964. Ken Ogata is passive or filled with rage. In both cases, he is very compelling.

Roger Ebert has a great description of Ogata in this film -- ""Sometimes he can be persuasive and even charming, but only to gain his goals of theft or murder. His face is a mask concealing --what? Perhaps concealing nothing.""

And even more fundamental, vengeance for what?

As played and as directed in this fine movie, Akira Nishiguchi seemed to have motive other than pure evil.

(Unless I missed some subtle cultural clues that would have explained what Akira Nishiguchi was getting revenge for.)

7846460,5,6303386725,Vengeance Is Mine is the true story of a serial killer in Japan and is outstanding on many levels. The performance of the lead is inspired! The choices the actor makes to showcase every single part of the characters warped personality are done with complexity. And then the intimacy in which the film is filmed is disturbing and real. We get that this man is a complete person and we get he is very disturbed and we are with him the whole time; not on his side but in his mind without totally freaking out!

Rating = ***
Director:  Shouhei Imamura
Producers:  Kazuo Inoue et al.
DVD
1979

Film = barely three (3) stars.  Studio Director  Shouhei Imamura delivers a gruesome tale about the product of a dysfunctional family who ends up as a remorseless killer (as well as an accomplished minor con artist).  This Shochiku programmer is apparently based on a documentary-style book which, in turn, is based on actual events.  The photoplay tries to embrace and regurgitate both data sources which results in a schizophrenic movie that suffers from excessive ""ancestor worship.""  Initially, the Director tries combining flashbacks with documentary-style filming (which never play well together), but quickly abandons this approach (much to the viewer's relief who would otherwise need a spreadsheet to keep track of things!).  Early murder scenes are unintentionally hilarious, as characters just plain refuse to die despite receiving multiple fatal wounds.  In between later murders, the killer freely roams city streets undisguised (except for sunglasses) when wanted posters are literally plastered everywhere!  (A death wish; a plea for help; or just a dumb screen script?)  Actors and actresses lack on-screen chemistry.  Rather than forming an ensemble, each seems to be waiting to deliver lines instead of listening and reacting to the dialog of others.  The lead actor does not seem to be in his element when playing a murderer, but, instead, when playing a chameleon-like swindler who can change modes of deception on the fly!  Nude scenes and gratuitous simulated sex are inserted here and there to spice things up (and boost juvenile audience appeal).  Cinematography (semi wide screen, color) is good except for the closing scenes (see below).  Restoration is very good.  Subtitles for opening credits are near-white letters on top of white Japanese characters making them challenging/impossible to read.  Dialog subtitles are sometimes too long given their screen flash rates.  Yup, the English title (widely used) for this movie does not fit, but it is catchy.  The ending is just plain weird (and seems to be tacked on as well as poorly executed and photographed).  But, then again, there could be a message hidden in there--somewhere!  Not recommended (unless you first park your brain beside your disc player). WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1451692800,,2428,5.326315789473684

7846465,5,6303386725,"in showing the japanese people as they are, Immamura develops a dualism between modern japanese naturalism and the dominating influences of the western and eastern cultures in many of his films. while other traditional japanese film-makers glorified the family order, self-sacrifice and loyalty, immamura scorns this idea as pretentious and an unnatural ideology fed by western christian cultures and eastern confucianism. the people in immamura's films don't behave like the 'official' japanese because none of the rules of order and decorum codified by the traditional version apply. immamura's characters have not the slightest conception of fidelity nor loyalty; they are as completely natural and are to that extent uncivilized, if civilization means the repression of the natural. all of immamura's characters remain a mystery as no explanations nor background information in relation with traditional parameters of psycho-analysis apply. an affectless tone is resonant throughout the whole narrative of his films. with a documentist knack for specificity of detail his environments gives rise to the emphasis of the dramatization of the decor. scenes which are richly filled with the telling fragments of the state of that culture which is japan. this allows an approach to viewing the screen of the environment that make up his character's otherwise flat history and perspective.

immamura himself does not seem to belong to the 'official' Japan, a country of tea ceremonies, subservient women, precisely graded degrees of social hierarchy and such virtues as fidelity, loyalty and devotion. rather, he seems to belong to the 'other' Japan, one which he depicts in all of his films and which to him is the real one. immamura is also not shy of presenting to us a visual imagery filled with symbolic expression of fantasy desires and fears. as in dreams, water threatens and beckons; the sea and flowing river invites suicide and death; the steaming hot spring encourages lust. immamura displaces his characters from the documentary narrative of the film to a space of bizarre interactions and symbolic representation. a scene depicting the projection of the fear of death can be seen when the killer and the old convict woman sees a dead eel floating on a flowing river as it has probably escaped from the nearby eel farm. the single eel can be seen as the inevitable outcome of breaking away from the safety of the environment where it was kept. but the remaining eels in the farm ponds are also destined to be eaten by the system which feeds and protects it, just as the killer is trapped in his society and is destined to be hanged by the system. the most fascinating fantasy aspect of his films is the relation between the central character and society itself.  the amoral hero becomes immortal in the end; japan is in such a state, brought on by a sense of lost identity from the intrusion of western technology and eastern principles, that the killers bones refuse burial in it. i referred to the killer as a hero because he is the one character who seems to break from the system which has trapped his fellow natives for centuries. but he embodies a tragic hero, as with the eel, he alone escapes and he alone dies.",1429056000,,3230,5.013035381750465
