1921818,1,B0000DBJCO,Sorry I paid for it,1405641600,,19,3.0
1921819,5,B0000DBJCO,"Its relaxing and really gives a good stretch. It's a bit more challenging than I expected, but that's a good thing. :) I have MS and sometimes my balance doesn't allow me to do it all as well as I'd like, but the stretch makes it easier for the next time (and is great for MS).",1372377600,3,277,3.9642857142857144
1921820,3,B0000DBJCO,I am familiar with stretches but this one goes to fast and you really don't get that long and relaxing stretch.,1360886400,2,111,4.333333333333333
1921821,1,B0000DBJCO,"I really just wanted to stretch and do some extensions.  If I would have known that I'd be standing on one foot and trying to balance while stretching, I wouldn't have brought this DVD.",1343347200,,185,4.4411764705882355
1921822,3,B0000DBJCO,Definitely not a beginner workout.  Found it difficult to do alot of the exercises.  Not for someone with minimal flexibility.,1332633600,5,126,5.25
1921823,1,B0000DBJCO,"While I have no complaints with the content basics, I've had lots of problems with this disk.  Sometimes it loads, but often it doesn't.  Won't accept chapter advances and sometimes jams on the preview section rather than the actual exercise chapter.  Won't load at all on my DVD player but can get it to work on my laptop -- not convenient.",1199232000,2,341,4.557377049180328
1921824,5,B0000DBJCO,"Overweight, stiff, and turning 40... that is where I was last summer.  I began walking with my neighbor, watching what I ate, and losing weight.  By spring, and post gall bladder surgery, I was ready to step things up a bit and get back some range of motion, strength, and tone.  I bought this DVD because it was inexpensive and looked straight-forward, not too long either.  It was PERFECT for me to begin stretching my long unused muscles.  I enjoy it and use it often.  Although she has no ""personality"" in this video, her voice-over was very good.  Madeleine Lewis gives very clear instructions, cues on breathing, everything you need to do it right.  I do not care for hyper, plastic, bubbling, in-your-face types, she is the opposite so she is a-okay for us ""old"" and out-of-shape folks.  I know I will eventually graduate from this short stretching routine, but if you are looking for something inexpensive, a routine you can ease into, one that you won't end up getting discouraged with or tired of, this is a great start to a new healthy you.",1148860800,51,1051,4.6378378378378375
1921825,1,B0000DBJCO,A real waste of money.  The video has no sound & no instruction.  All you get to watch is a woman rushing through a very poor routine.,1143504000,13,134,3.925925925925926
8000354,1,B0000DBJCO,"I bought this from Edward R. Hamilton Booksellers a month or so ago and just popped it in.  All it is is a woman doing the same few stretches over and over again with no instruction or tips or explanation.  It's like 1 minute of stretches played over and over again in a loop.  I don't see the point of making it 20 minutes long, except to lure in buyers.  I can't imagine anybody improving their flexibility with these.  There's no way of leveraging yourself to hold the stretch and improve.  This is really kind of pointless.  It seems like most stretching instruction is much too hard or much too easy.  This was much too easy.",1505606400,,630,4.370689655172414
8000355,5,B0000DBJCO,Love it.,1497052800,,8,3.5
8000356,2,B0000DBJCO,"Goes way too fast, especially at the beginning. The narrator is not in sync with the woman doing the moves, as extend left arm, but the woman you are following is extending the right, I noticed that at least three times. Does not hold stretches. Do NOT recommend.",1488326400,,263,4.5
8000357,5,B0000DBJCO,Great 20 min stretch! I wanted a video that gave me a good overall stretch on days when I don't have 30-45 min.  This is perfect.,1472860800,,129,3.9615384615384617
8000358,5,B0000DBJCO,Very easy to follow.,1471651200,,20,4.25
8000359,1,B0000DBJCO,"The title is deceptive. This is not a video devoted to stretching. It's also a strength-building video. There's no extended holding in movements, you move quickly from one to another. I was looking for a video that focused on flexibility for those days when I needed stretching for tight or sore muscles. Huge disappointment. I didn't even finish going through it once. I ditched it and then found a great stretch video on YouTube.",1458518400,2,431,4.837837837837838
8000360,3,B0000DBJCO,the seller delivered the video on time. i was excited because i ordered this video from the seniors exercises. I think i lost my money because seniors cannot get on the floor and do these stretches. I am 63 years old a young senior and i could not do these floor stretches. there were no modifications either.,1454889600,,309,4.43859649122807
8000361,1,B0000DBJCO,Didn't use it much at all ended up throwing it away after a few months,1452211200,,70,3.7333333333333334
8000362,4,B0000DBJCO,"This daily stretch is just what I need, too old for anything too rigorous, but in need of more flexibility.  I love Madeleine's soothing, encouraging voice and I always want to respond when she says, ""Try to keep this posture all day and have a great day.""  I do have a great day with a great start.",1447027200,3,299,4.228070175438597
8000363,5,B0000DBJCO,Fantastic,1405641600,,9,9.0
