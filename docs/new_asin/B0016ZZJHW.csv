8264250,3,B0016ZZJHW,It goes over mostly all the topics for keeping a reef aquarium but rather briefly. It does show every step of plumbing and setting up the aquarium but this takes up most of the first dvd. The second dvd has lots of good fish and coral profiles. I give it 4 stars. I liked it but I definitely don't think it was worth 60 bucks. Instead Id reccomend you get a good book.,1296000000,3,368,4.054794520547945
