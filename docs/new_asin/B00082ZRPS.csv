8055423,4,B00082ZRPS,"Dick Jones as ""Buffalo Bill Jr."" delivers his fights and stunts with gusto with help from his sister Calamity. Don't expect Gunsmoke-like plots, though. This is a TV western for KIDS of all ages. The DVD features the first episode ever and the four episodes in volume 1 have a good video transfer in my opinion.",1125100800,10,311,4.571428571428571
