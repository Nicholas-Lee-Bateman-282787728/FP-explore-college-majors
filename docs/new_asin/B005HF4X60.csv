This is now gathering dust in the NO pile.  It looks like a good workout for the uberfit though.",1412553600,,263,3.9245283018867925

8472910,5,B005HF4X60,"This is the MOST AMAZING VIDEO EVER!!!!  Even after reading all the other glowing recommendations on Amazon, I was unprepared for being so impressed with these DVDs.  I hartily recommend them to any one who has back problems, shoulder and neck tension, tightness in the muscles in general..even helps release headaches.  Anyone who travels for their work..... this is an amazing tool to help with the back and neck pain that I find is the result of airtravel.  Thank you Thank you Thank Michaela Sirbu where ever you are.",1341187200,2,521,4.820224719101123
8472911,5,B005HF4X60,"No matter what level of Pilates you are at Michaela is thorough, clear, precise, and informative on how to do Pilates.  Her years of expertise show she knows what she is talking about.  Not just how to do Pilates positions but what the positions do for you.  Michaela explains how to do them correctly so as not to hurt yourself.  I've learned so much more from her on how to do Pilates correctly.  Others DVD's have never given me as much instruction and caring.  It is like she is right there guiding me through each position.  Her passion for Pilates and helping you achieve a more fit body shows through her work and how she instructs you through the workout.  If you work out at home these DVD's on Pilates by Michaela are the best investment you can do for yourself.",1328659200,3,772,4.425531914893617
8472912,5,B005HF4X60,"A few months of playing with my foam roller guided by Michaela's ""Foam Roller Workout & Massage"" (the perfect, basic, ""how to"" DVD to start with), I've decided that I'm ready for more.  The Foam Roller Intermediate & Advanced levels, 2 videos on Disc 2 of 2 - have proven to be more excellent choices.  Michaela's thorough explanation of the various movements and her compassionate teaching style (in her lovely, soothing tone of voice), hold great appeal to me.  I feel that although I'm working with a video I'm not going to hurt myself because she reminds me ""do"" and ""don'ts"". I also feel much progress in terms of ease of movement and greater strength.  I'm glad to have bought both INT & ADV levels because I can vary my mat workouts more. There are actually some ADV moves I can and some INT moves that I can't do - yet! - though I'm confident that I will get there. Thank you, Michaela, for your great foam roller DVDs!",1325376000,5,927,4.4674556213017755
8472913,5,B005HF4X60,"Praises for all 3 of Michaela's Foam Roller DVDs! I am extremely pleased with these changes in my body since I've started playing with the foam roller:  1) I truly see less cellulite and have almost no pain left when I roll my outer thighs  2) my back and hamstrings feel looser than ever, and I sit taller  3) I have far more strength and muscle tone in my arms and shoulders  4) I've been paying more attention to core muscles as I do everyday activities after realizing that I've never used my core muscles enough before 5) even when I do weight training, walk or do housework, I remember the tips on shoulders and core that I learned from Michaela.  Activities driven by core muscles rather then extremities feel a great deal different. Thanks ever so much for teaching me this!",1323907200,6,782,4.47887323943662
8472914,5,B005HF4X60,"I really like these 3 Foam Roller videos and they are worth every penny!
Having heard of the many benefits of using a Foam Roller, I bought one, and Michaela's 3 instruction videos: The Foam Roller Workout & Massage, which is a Beginner level (note it is the same as Disc 1 of 2 here at Amazon), plus the Intermediate and Advanced - Disc 2 of 2.  The Beginner workout is basic and thorough instruction, the moves and positioning explained in detail so that everyone can get acquainted with the roller, regardless of their fitness level.  Great cues provided throughout on how to engage your muscles properly and to position so that you get stronger without hurting yourself in the process.  I wanted to know just how far you can go with a Foam Roller, reason I bought the INT and ADV, so I found out!  I'm thrilled to know that I will likely never run out of moves or ever get bored of training on my mat at home. For now, I look forward to getting stronger and more fit every day with the basics so that I can try the challenging Intermediate & Advanced soon.",1322956800,4,1060,4.365482233502538
