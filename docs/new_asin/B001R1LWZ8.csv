8337147,4,B001R1LWZ8,"Numerous collections of out-of-copyright cartoons are available, most of them retreads of the same 'toons, usually in less than pristine condition, unrestored or remastered, with washed-out colors and faded sound. However, they still provide a chance to see a lot of 'toons one otherwise could not, and at a bargain price.

This six DVD set from Mill Creek falls into that lot, but it includes some unusual 'toons which are themselves out in DVD sets, most of which cost more than this entire package. The set consists of two DVD cases, one blue and one green, each with three single-sided discs individually packaged in paper sleeves, in a slipcase. This proves a surprisingly safe and effective way to store and ship the discs, unlike some other budget DVD packaging schemes.

The big draw on the Green set is Colonel Bleep, a 1957 cliff-hanger style SF cartoon with designs so modern it could be on Cartoon Network. You get 25 episodes, more than were ever released on VHS. Also in the Green case are 16 Hoppity Hooper cartoons, with 24 more in the Blue case. This popular SatAm show about an intrepid frog and his bear buddy came from Jay Ward (Rocky and Bullwinkle) and aired from 1964-'67. Another keeper is ""Clutch Cargo"", a 1959 serial using an odd technique called ""Sunchro-vox"", which superimposed human lips on the characters. The Green case has 35 episodes, with 15 more on the blue one. The Blue case also includes one story arc (five episodes) of ""Space Angel"", the sci-fi follow up to Clutch Cargo.

From the same producer came ""The New Three Stooges"", often just called ""The Three Stooges"" in 1965. For some reason the show fell out of copyright and some of the 156 episodes appear on numerous cartoon collections, usually with live-action wrap arounds featuring the slapstick trio. The Green case includes 19 episodes, without the live-action bumpers (forty live-action bumpers were originally repeated for the cartoon episodes). Of at least historical interest are eight episodes of the 1961 black and white cartoon, ""Calvin and the Colonel"", the misadventures of a smooth, Southern fox and a gentlemanly bear loosely adapted from the ""Amos and Andy"" radio show. Long before ""The Simpsons"", it was a prime-time comedy for adults on ABC, which then moved to a SatAm slot.

Some very early cartoons are included, in unrestored, poor condition, which are mostly black and white animated line drawings, but which show the fascinating history of early theatrical animation. These include Terrytoons: ten ""Aesop's Fables"" from the late '20s, and twelve starring Farmer Al Falfa from the '30s, six Walt Disney ""Alice"" cartoons, and twelve with Felix the cat. Also included are two rare, color industrial films from the late '50s, with stunning, modernistic designs from Sutherland Productions, ""Destination Earth"", a booster for Free Enterprise, and ""Going Places"", hyping petroleum products.

This is a great collection for Baby Boomers, cartoon fans, or anyone who wants to see lots of little-shown cartoons without a big investment. The back covers of the cases list the titles of each cartoon, but the online menus list them by studio or series title, as I have below, with the number of episodes:
