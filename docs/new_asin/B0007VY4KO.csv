actors experience...but was a lot of fun to see Drag Racers make their acting debut.  The location was beautiful and the

storyline had a lot of meaning .  No academy awards here but as I said, A lot of fun.  Looking forward to the next one.  Oh yes,..... THE KIDS LOVE IT!",1117756800,,338,4.03030303030303
