6256149,5,B00IBIIR2G,"Angry Birds and those mischievous Piggies from the uber-popular apps and video games now have their own cartoon, ANGRY BIRDS TOONS! The second batch of cartoons from the first series are now available on ANGRY BIRDS TOONS!, SEASON 1, VOL. 2. There are 26 cartoons total on this volume. The overall humor and style of animation reminds me of the classic Warner Brother Looney Toons. However, these cartoons are really short. They are only about 3 minutes long each. Heres a list of each of the episodes on the disc:

1. Green Pig Soup  some Pigs attempt to capture the Angry.
2. Catch of the Day  there are at least two references in this cartoon to the movie JAWS.
3. Nighty Night Terence  Terence guards the eggs during the night.
4. Piggy Wig
5. Pig Plot Potion  Chef Pig concocts a potion that turns other animals into Pigs. He uses it to
turn Red into a Pig and then the two of them steal the eggs.
6. Tooth Royal  King Pig has a rotting tooth that just won't come out.
7. Night of the Living Pork  this is a Halloween episode. King Pig is enjoying his candy at his
castle when it is overrun by zombie pigs. Bubbles (the Orange Bird) shows up to trick or treat and sets out to get rid of the zombie pigs.
8.  King of the Castle  King Pig and Chef Pig have a sandcastle building competition at the
beach.
9. Love Is in the Air  King Pig gets hit in the head with a cabbage and falls in love with it.
Watch and listen for a very quick allusion to the movie THE PRINCESS BRIDE.
10. Fired Up
11. Clash of Corns  Bomb wants to eat Matilda's corn plant, but she won't have it.
12. A Pig's Best Friend
13. Slumber Hill
14. Jingle Yells  a Christmas episode.
15. El Porkador!  the Pigs send a massive singing Pig to help capture the eggs and the birds are
completely defenseless until Terence arrives.
16. Hiccups
17. The Butterfly Effect
18. Hambo  a new pig becomes a super soldier and is sent to steal the eggs on a solo mission.
Watch for all the Rambo references.
19. Bird Flu
20. Piggies from the Deep  a couple of Pigs play a prank on Foreman Pig. Lot of references to
the movie JAWS.
21. Oh Gnome!
22. Shrub It In
23. The Truce
24. Operation Opera
25. Chucked Out  after starting an accident that almost crushed the eggs, Chuck goes it alone.
26. Bomb's Away

There are a few extras on the DVD, including some behind the scenes look at Rovio (that place looks almost as fun to work at as Google). Also, theres a snippet cartoon called ""Easter Egg Hunt."" In addition there are some ""Meet the Characters"" segments featuring Bomb, Terence, Chef Pig, and Corporal Pig.

Overall, ANGRY BIRDS TOONS, SEASON 1, VOLUME 2 is a pretty humorous DVD. Fans of Angry Birds will probably enjoy it, but its just a good cartoon series overall, so that a fan of classic cartoons who has never seen, played, or heard of Angry Birds will it.",1399766400,3,2825,4.318181818181818

47. Oh Gnome! Matilda receives a gnome as a gift from Chuck, but it is too scary and annoying for her. She does whatever it takes to get rid of it without hurting Chuck's feelings.

48. Shrub It In. The Blues asked Bomb to make big explosions, but they went out of hand and they accidently wrecked Matilda's rose shrub.

49. The Truce. Chef Pig wants to make a truce with the Flock and had a picnic with them. Oh really, is it?

50. Operation Opera. Matilda meets a handsome male White Bird and falls in love with him. She does not know that it is the Pigs in disguise.
