7800746,5,1633159221,"Throughout the history of God's dealings with man, symbols have been used to convey and reinforce thoughts and principles central to our relationship with Deity.  Today, however, symbols that once conveyed sacred meaning have been co-opted and even claimed to be of a demonic origin. Have sacred symbols become so obscured and unfamiliar to us today that we wrongly ascribe the intent and the meaning? Statesmen & Symbols - Prelude to the Restoration, has tackled that question with amazing acuity. What about symbols that are common to Mormonism and Masonry? Did our nation's founders ascribe to witchcraft or the occult as evidenced by the symbols found embedded in the early architecture and even woven into the streets of our nation's capital?  Did the ancient inhabitants of this land upon which our nation now exists have and use similar symbols in their day? The producers of Statesmen & Symbols - Prelude to the Restoration have answered all of that and more. The Joseph Smith Foundation has once again, in the classic style of their previous videos, revealed plain and simple truths for all to consider.",1451001600,5,1112,5.038043478260869
