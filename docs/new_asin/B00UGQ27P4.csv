First, let me explain that the British culture plays a vast part in this story line and unless you have lived in it, you will have a very difficult time with the very deep message that it portrays.  All the side glances and insinuations play a very large part toward the final climatic end!!  I can say no more as the relationship of these two men point to the bare fragility of the culture they live in!  NJMJr!!",1509321600,,467,4.2727272727272725
