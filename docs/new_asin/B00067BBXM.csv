2173500,3,B00067BBXM,"Overall the documentary is ok, but I disliked two things very much in this film:
1-Some short scenes repeat at least 3 times one after other which was extremely annoying. I would say there were at least 40 scenes that were repeated each 3 times.
2- The contents or scenes are no coherent and consistent. For example it sometimes shows Shah in Pasargad right after a scene from Googoosh singing about irrelevant song. As a viewer I came across such scenes that I could not understand what we're the relations between the scenes.

I think the film is informative, but has low build and becomes tedious due to the reasons I explained above",1381708800,,636,4.628318584070796

2173502,4,B00067BBXM,"Googoosh, a film written and directed by Farhad Zamani, is an ambitious portrayal of Iran's equivalent to a pop star who is as well known in that culture as Madonna or Elvis is in the United States.  The interviews with family and friends, as well as her family's personal home movies and her professional films from the 1960s and 70s in both English and Farsi, chronicles the life of a fascinating woman far ahead of her time.  Googoosh did not flee to America and Europe, as so many Persian-American artists and intellectuals chose to do, and her singing and acting career were silenced by the political regime that took over after the Revolution in 1979.  (It was only recently, in 2010, when she was once again allowed to perform.)  The repetitive film clips in an avant-garde filmmaking style seem to imitate the non-linear progression of time and looping of memories in the experimental tradition of Maya Deren and Alain Resnais.  To the average viewer this may be somewhat distracting, but I believe this film is still well worth the time and money.

Much like Elvis Presley was drafted, Googoosh was banned by
the fundamentalists when they came to power.
It appear women 's rights took a big hit in both Iran and Afghanistan.

The film lacks a central narrative voice and uses badly edited video clips to make weak points. The film seems to have the quality of a beginner high-school film class student. Please do not buy this film, you would learn more about the life of Googoosh from Wikipedia.

There are a few positive film reviews listed here. The authors most definitely were friends or family of the film-maker not honest enough to say how bad the film is. wow, truly bad film.

2173519,5,B00067BBXM,"With Iran once again so frequently in the headlines, Farhad Zamani's documentary, made in 2000, is most relevant at this particular moment. He provides us a wonderful opportunity to begin to grasp the complexity of Persian history and identity through an in-depth analysis of the work and times of the most popular cultural icon of pre-revolutionary Iran, a rare creature -- who transformed herself in more ways than Madonna ever dreamed of -- by the name of Googoosh. As such, it is an interesting example of the little practiced art of attempting to convey heaven through a grain of sand; in other words, if you like to learn a semester's worth of political history and religion while being entertained, here's your chance. Interviews with various artists and intellectuals are interspersed with vintage footings of Googoosh's musical and film performances, which are used to underscore the various themes under discussion; her words and lyrics are made to literally speak for larger political and cultural events. Although a bit too stylistically ambitious, this is a documentary that deserves a lot of credit for giving a fair and insightful account of a modern tragedy - a nation/woman poised at a breathtaking height and sophistication that was suddenly silenced in the name of God. -Tamara Parvizi",1188864000,,1304,5.15566037735849
2173520,1,B00067BBXM,"This is not a bad film. That would be too easy. It is the worst film ever made in the history of filmmaking. It's an insult to all documentarians. It's an insult to any art film ever made. The group I watched the film with laughed at the director and his incompetence almost continously. Fortunately, there were no eggs or tomatoes around or they would have been thrown at my TV! It's difficult to make a bad film about a powerful subject like Googoosh. Her story has been woven into the lives of many many Iranians. Kudos to Googoosh for staying away from this amateur filmmaker. Her son should have done the same. The film is ultimately a huge embaressment on so many levels that it does not fit this short review. Buy any of Googoosh's CDs and you'll learn more about her life than watching almost 3 hours of this pretentious, highly annoying drivel.",1188432000,,853,4.509677419354839
2173521,5,B00067BBXM,"Zamani's film tells the fascinating story of Googoosh, an Iranian legend who, like Marilyn Monroe, has constantly sought the luxury of a private identity.  Primed from an early age for the stage and screen, she was later silenced, and in her silence became ""the voice of a nation.""  Googoosh was born in 1951 into a very different Iran than the one we know today.  The highly visible singer and actor had a powerful image that was venerated by government officials.  They found her chic, fun, and charismatic and courted her a representative of their own interests.

But with the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran began a social, political, and cultural transformation, shifting back to a prohibitve fundamentalist government.  Women singers were labled ""temptresses"" and forbidden to perform publicly or to release recordings.

For Googoosh, whose identity was inseperable from performance, this fate equaled death.  Instead of leaving her country, as other entertainers did, she retreated from public life for 20 years, becoming a symbol of censorship and oppression and fueling the frenzy of her fans.

Zamani gradually paints an impressionistic and honoring portrait of Googoosh, using footage from her starlet years and interview material from those who know her.",1152662400,,1264,5.343434343434343
2173522,1,B00067BBXM,"I adore Googoosh and her music.  And this has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen.  Let there be no doubt that the subject is fasicinating.  The film follows Googoosh's life and career as well as tackling the role of women in Iran (before and after the revolution).  Too bad the director, Zamani, is a complete amateur.  This film features a bunch of interview clips that need to be heavily edited to be interesting and it keeps repeating the same archival footage over and over again.

The repeated footage, along with the use of the triple-take trick are meant to emphasize the director's point.  But the only thing they proved to me was that this filmmaker doesn't know what he's doing.  There are so many flaws and cheap cinematic techniques used here that I wouldn't even know where to begin to describe them.

This film is an insult to Googoosh and to filmmaking.",1152576000,,879,4.547770700636943
2173523,1,B00067BBXM,"Dear Mr Zamani

Recently I ordered a copy of this DVD: googoosh the daughter of iran, through amazon.com. I live in Sydney/Australia and we were looking forward to watch this movie. Finally, it arrived and with much eagerness we played it.

I'm certainly not a professional movie maker, but I'm certain that I could have done a better job than what you did with this movie. I seriously don't believe that you should have been given so much credit.

I will send this movie back to you and I demand a full refund. Unfortunately I cannot be compensated for the three hours I spent watching this drible.

The movie is of poor quality, scenes repeating themselves at least three times! Obviously there was something wrong with this copy due to the fact that the scenes kept repeating themselves because of your editing incompetance. The movie lacks any coherant flow from one scene to the other. It would have been nice if you could allow a video clip to run for more than 1 min and let us enjoy one song being sung.

I would appreciate a reply and I will follow this up

2173524,5,B00067BBXM,"This TOUR-DE-FORCE documentary about pop-singer Googoosh miraculously and ingeniously takes on Iranian history, religion, gender politics, and mass culture.

For American audiences, this ambitious film serves as a corrective to the hateful and ignorant (or cynical) demonization of Iran for the past 27 years in the US, and provides long-overdue lessons about US imperialism and the 1953 CIA-coup d'etat in Iran.

For Iranian audiences (as a fellow Iranian-American) I offer some advice: ""JAM-ESH-CON!"" This documentary is an intelligent creative ART FILM---not a Hollywood sentimental bio-pic or a VH1 ""Behind the Music"" (or God-forbid, a Los Angeles ex-pat satellite TV long-form music-video).  If you have never seen the films of Antonioni, Cocteau, or Godard, then have some humility regarding what you do NOT immediately understand, and be open to unforseen sublime possibilities...and you will be rewarded!

While lovingly and sympathetically showing Googoosh's life and talent, the film also metaphorizes her to show the misogynist continuum of the monarchy through the theocracy, with women serving as the field upon which (Western or native) patriarchy stakes its claim.  This politically savvy film is a breath of fresh air: it refuses simple-minded nostalgia and is critical of both the Pahlavi-monarchy as well as the Khomeini-theocracy; it's critical of both US imperialism as well as Iranian religious fundamentalism--indeed, this film shows how the former incarnated the latter (how the US overthrow of Mossadeq planted the seeds for the Islamic Republic).

Using a highly-creative and difficult FORM (with inventive editing and repitition of sound and images) as well as a rich analytical and intellectual CONTENT, this film is a unique cinematic experience which will deepen your understanding and compassion for Googoosh, her nation, and beyond.",1142726400,,1863,5.659498207885305
2173525,5,B00067BBXM,"Here is a review I saw in the Asian Reporter.  Pretty impressive!

By Polo / Asian Reporter July 2005

I could humbly decline to speak. I should find me a savvy Tehrani to help out - I would probably save myself from sounding dumb. Because this is hard. This is not just a gripping biography about Googoosh, a stage and screen icon doubtless as compelling to modern Iranians as Marilyn Monroe remains for us. This film also chronicles Iran's dizzying drive toward modernity, then the country's tortured tumble into an anachronistic theocracy. Farhad Zamani does all that.

""Googoosh: Iran's Daughter"" is a difficult documentary. It takes work. In fact, it takes two hours and 38 minutes. Mr. Zamani's research is impressive. He says he sat through over 30 Googoosh movies, from her early days as a child actor to the heady days just before Shah Reza Pahlavi's fall. He personally interviewed 20 musicians and lyricists, professors and clerics, family and friends.

What emerges is a fascinating portrayal of a woman embodying something more than that uneasy mlange of star power and vulnerability that Western voyeurs witnessed in the arc of Marilyn and Elvis, Marvin or Janis. Googoosh is a proper noun, a verb, and an adjective.

Googoosh, as person and phenom, meant as much to popular Persian culture as the Beatles meant to our generation. She set the standard, not by clever design in the way Madonna smartly packaged her own pop authority, but by the artist's immediate resonance with the aspirations of a rapidly evolving urban Persian society.

She broke so many rules. Maybe most of them. Whether it was Googoosh or her handlers, whether it was she or her act, is hard to say. Orthodox Shi'ia authorities made no distinctions. She was silenced. She makes no appearance in her film. The director, Mr. Zamani, makes it clear who was punished for Googoosh's public persona, for the pop culture that swelled around her act.

According to Mr. Zamani, the true beauty of the woman - whether we're talking about the public icon or cynically used public performer - is that she stayed. She could have run. She could've exiled the way many educated and most urbane Iranians did. She would've sung in front of steadily diminishing houses of homesick migrs in Houston or L.A. But she stayed. And thus silenced for 21 years, she remains Iran's Daughter.",1133827200,,2351,4.889447236180905
2173526,5,B00067BBXM,"This is taken from the UK based magazine Songlines, written by Nigel Williamson:

Googoosh was Iran's best-loved pop diva -- until, that is, she was silenced by the 1979 revolution, which banned women from performing for audiences that included men on the grounds that ""looking is fornication of the eye,"" and which applied a similarly unreasonable principle to female voices on disc and radio.

This unconventional documentary of the singer's life could easily have been hamstrung by the fact that while the film was being made, Googoosh was forbidden to talk to its director, American-Iranian Farhad Zamani.  Yet somehow he brilliantly turns her enforced silence to advantage, compellingly creating what he describes as the ""presence of an absence"" through images, silences, archive footage, subtitles over blacked-out screen, and interviews with friends, family, and fans.

These techniques serve to emphasise the tragedy of such a potent voice being stilled at the height of her powers, aged only 29.  And they mean that, in this DVD, Googoosh's dramatic life is not so much set against the socio-political context of Iranian culture and history but becomes a metaphor for it.

As a singer she had a strong pop sensibility and there's even a clip of her singing an English-language version of Carole King's ""It's Too Late"" that could have come from the Val Doonican Show.  Yet her story deserves to be told, and it also has something of a happy ending.  Shortly after this documentary was made, in 2000, she was allowed to leave Iran and tour the US, where she played her first concerts in 21 years to ecstatic audiences of Iranian exiles.

2173537,1,B00067BBXM,"I am very interested in the subject since I like Googoosh and was brought up by her songs and legacy but such a huge disappointment!! I am deeply disappointed about the poor quality of editing and production.  Such a shame that a great story like this is produced so unprofessionally and clumsily.  I couldn't believe such a poor quality of editing and production has passed all the filters and got permission to sell in the public.  Out of 150min of the documentary about 100min are just repeats! How could that be? What was the editor thinking?  The editing was absolutely awful and unprofessional.  The same old clips were played over and over to a point that I seriously thought my DVD player is skipping.  There was no order of events and scenes were irrelevant and out of order as if the editor was trying to make a Quentin Tarantino impression.

If we give the content to a professional editor and producer they probably can make a good 45min documentary out of the whole 150min repeated content so if you are familiar with home video editing it worth buying the DVD and editing it yourself!",1119398400,,1098,4.628865979381444

This oppression have been there for centuries and climaxed after the 1979 revolution. Good news is that Iranian women have not died and one day will re-emerge gloriously, like what Googoosh did in the year 2000 and during her overwhelming world tour.

8039741,1,B00067BBXM,"My wife and I were excited to see a film about Googoosh and by twenty minutes in we realized that the incredibly poor film making and story line destroyed the story.

The film can be basically summed up into three parts (of which get spliced together in a really odd way).

1:There's a lot of interviews with academics, peers of Googoosh and her friends.  Many of the interviews discuss Googoosh's background, how she survived the revolution and discussions that covers the political backdrop of Iran from Reza Shah into the revolution.  Many of these were interesting and things could be learned from them.

2: A series of clippings from films Googoosh starred in and some black screen cutins with Googoosh songs playing.

3:A series of clips from the Iranian revolution.

The interviews are constantly interrupted by poorly edited film clips that rarely fit the preceding or succeeding interviews. Indeed, the interviews are where the fun stops.

For whatever reason, many (probably half) of the clips repeat three times: likely its to create dramatic effect but they badly backfire and only cause the viewer pain and a desire for a root canal (which is at least productive).  Worse, many of the clips are used over and over again.  Including one of schoolchildren applauding over and over again.  (Why God why?). Cutting all of the clips out probably would shave 30 minutes of time.

Even the interviews are not well threaded to create a decent storyline.
