8005769,5,B00012FXJK,I work at an elementary school..I showed this video in the cafeteria at lunch time - 1st - 5th grade the students loved it,1442707200,,122,4.125
8005770,1,B00012FXJK,"I don't normally bother writing reviews but feel I had to with this one.
I was shocked. Not only was it poorly produced but it was very short.
All my little boy learnt from this was how to pick your nose and wipe it on the table, how to blow bubbles through a straw, and how to say 'shut up'.
Why on earth would the producers not highlight the 'correct' behaviours instead of focusing on wrong behaviours? I know it was meant to be a humourous way of highlighting what not to do, however when kids see behaviours (wrong or not) they copy them anyway!!
Definitely only for much older kids, maybe 8-10yrs, but I wouldnt recommend it at all to be honest, not much to learn from it.",1358121600,5,678,4.263565891472868
8005771,1,B00012FXJK,"this video is not interesting enough to children, its like a game show and I wish it was more like episodes or a little story, my 5 year old only watched it once.",1319241600,,162,3.9393939393939394
8005772,5,B00012FXJK,"This is a fantastic DVD which is fun and informative for children. It is an upbeat gameshow format and the ""game show host"" is outstanding.  My granddaughter is 4 and will watch it any time she has a chance.  I loaned it to a friend who teaches teenaged autistic children and it got high marks from my friend, other teachers and the children.  I highly recommend this for ages 3-12.

8005773,3,B00012FXJK,"Although the content is good, it is a very short video which is broken up into even shorter clips.  The children were interested in it, but it doesn't cover much, and I would like to have seen more content without having to switch to different segments.",1270425600,,253,4.5
8005774,4,B00012FXJK,This is a great video. I created a powerpoint presentation to introduce this subject matter to our Children's church. The video works perfectly with my powerpoint presentation. I would definitely recommend it coupled with another presentation. Our children loved playing the game.,1264809600,,280,5.690476190476191
8005775,5,B00012FXJK,I am a school counselor and show this to all my Kindergarten-2nd Grade classes.  It is great!!!  It is a good review of good manners and the kids LOVE that it is a game show.  Keeps all the kids attention. I highly recommend for home or school.  It came in a soft cover though.  A hard case would have been nice (but for the small price I can't really complain about that).,1258070400,2,373,4.125
8005776,5,B00012FXJK,"I haven't even seen this dvd, but it has my full endorsement. Every since my son and his Grandmommy sat down together to watch it, my son's been talking about good manners! I'm thrilled. Buying the dvd was a good purchase.",1256601600,,222,4.439024390243903
8005777,4,B00012FXJK,I'm a school psychologist and I purchased it to use with several classes at my school.  The feedback from the kids and teachers has been positive.  One mother even told me that her son had gone over proper dinner table manners with her when they'd been at a restaurant.,1193443200,4,269,4.469387755102041
8005778,5,B00012FXJK,"Both of my kids, age 6 and age 3, have really enjoyed watching this DVD!!  They have wanted to watch it over and over and have really learned some good manners along the way.  My older child is constantly quizzing us about various manners, just like she's seen on the video.  Highly recommend this DVD!",1168473600,10,302,4.454545454545454
