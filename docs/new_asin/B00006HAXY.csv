1756549,4,B00006HAXY,"STORY - Based on a true story, the movie begins with Charlie Burden, Jr. walking toward the courthouse remembering the summer of 1955 in Western Missouri when he was growing up on his father's farm. His mother had died and he lived with his father and Drum, the dog raised and trained by his mother for him. They were inseparable. As the story evolves around the adventures of Charlie and Drum, there are some sheep killings in the area. Charlie's uncle, who is still bitter at the loss of his sister, Charlie's mother, blames Drum for the killings and tries to take care of Drum his way. This results in the 'arrest' of Drum, who is put in jail pending trial to determine if he should be put away. The trial is complicated by the fact that Charlie hasn't always told the truth about Drum's activities and he can't prove that Drum was, in fact, with him when the sheep were killed. Apparently, the actual story took place in 1872 but was changed to 1955 for the movie. There were several classic lines in the movie. Charlie's dad tells him after he breaks the nose of the town bully, ""Now making him your friend, that will be the hard part"". The passionate final argument before the jury by George Graham Vest, who was the family's attorney and who went on to become a U.S. Senator, coined the phrase, ""A dog is a man's best friend"". And after hearing the final argument, the attorney for the plaintiff turns to his client and says ""We'll be lucky if we're not lynched"". Enjoy.

1756550,5,B00006HAXY,We loved this movie my whole family ( Children from 3 to 22)watched this movie we are fans of Ron Perlman and this was a good movie for the whole family. If you are a fan of The Beauty and the Beast tv series you'll like the role of Ron has in this movie he plays a gentle father. This movie is based on a true story set in the 1950's. This movie is a Feature Family Film.,1175558400,3,372,3.782051282051282
1756551,3,B00006HAXY,"This is a family movie set in 1950's rural America about a boy whose Uncle presses sheep killing charges against his dog Drum, starting not only a family legal feud but community discord as their town begins to take sides.

This is formula film that attempts to be very touching and sweet. It's biggest weakness is that the only people who could really act were Scott Bakula, Ron Perlman and the dog. (John Shuck and Kathy Garver, ""Sissy"" from the original ""Family Affair,"" as the Uncle and his wife, were okay.) The children were not that good (basically they looked like they were acting) and that's a problem when the film really revolves around them (Aaron Fors, who plays the bully Donny makes me think of what the actor Russell Crowe must have looked liked as a child, only with no talent and a lot of ham).

Favorite line (spoken by the Prosecutor after Scott Bakula's Defense closing trial speech): ""We'll be lucky if they don't lynch us.""

Favorite line spoken by Ron Perlman (after his son punches the bully): ""Now making him your friend, that will be the hard part.""",1104019200,11,1077,4.628272251308901
1756552,5,B00006HAXY,"Gather your family around the upcoming holidays and let them watch THE TRIAL OF OLD DRUM.  Coyingly sweet and unabashedly sentimental, this delightful family movie will surely enliven the hearts of all.

Bobby Edner stars as little Charlie Burden, a young boy who loves his Old Drum like the best of friends.  Ron Perlman plays his stalwart dad, and Alexis O'Keefe is charming as Perlman's love interest.  (The little boy's mom passed away earlier, and told Old Drum to look after Charlie).  Seems like a wild dog is killing some of the rancher's sheep and Perlman's nasty brother-in-law (John Schuck) is determined to prove it was Old Drum that did it.  This all leads to an effort to destroy the beloved dog.  In steps Scott Bakula in a charming performance as a big city lawyer who represents Old Drum in the trial.

It's all predictable, but so nicely done, it's a real charmer.  It's refreshing to see young kids respect their elders; no foul language; no violence; no sex.  How can it be good?  Well, it's a nice film that makes you feel wonderful.  Enjoy it with those you love, and Ajax who plays Old Drum is perfect!!!!",1096416000,16,1128,4.641414141414141
1756553,4,B00006HAXY,"The story takes place in the '50's and is based on a true story.

1756599,5,B00006HAXY,"This dog proves over and over in this movie that a dog can be the very best friend a boy could have and a boy could be the very best friend a dog could have.  Old Drum is accused of killing sheep belonging to his neighbor who happens to be his father's former brother-in-law.  He has a very deep dislike for him as he blames the boy's father of causing the death of his sister.  The dog is accused, arrested and put in jail until his trial.  Of course in the end he is proven innocent but the story has a lot of interesting events and would well be worth watching.  I loved it partly because I love dogs but also  because I like a well told story and  equally well made movie.",1403395200,,676,4.037593984962406
