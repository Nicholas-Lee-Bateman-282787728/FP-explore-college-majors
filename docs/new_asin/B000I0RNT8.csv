2650906,5,B000I0RNT8,I enjoy working out with Gilad.  I used to work out with him when he was on TV and I felt great.  He is easy to follow and understand.  I like that his workouts are not boring.,1426723200,,176,3.7027027027027026

2650910,5,B000I0RNT8,"This is my first dvd from Gilad after a very long time! and I simply love this workout! Great explanations on proper form. Gilad is very encouraging. Slow pace that allows me to perform the moves properly.
I don't want to criticize other instructors but this is my honest opinion based on my personal experience. I certainly hope my telling the following will help others: After working out with Jillian Michaels for some time now, I found that certain exercises that Gilad included in this program for the glutes were working muscles I didn't know were there and were most likely left unworked. Gilad's exercises in this program are a bit different from what I've found in recent DVDs from JM, the Firm and other (younger, ""modern""-style) instructors, but different in a very good way. I feel quite well after finishing the program without that exhaustion after an hour with JM. After doing this program (which is helping define my abs little by little) I have understood why Gilad's methods are superior (or at least better for me). Unfortunately I have found out quite late that laying down on the floor without lowering the heart rate after intense cardio moves is quite dangerous for the heart and from what I've seen in Gilad's workouts so far his style of training seems heart-friendly :). I wish I could turn back the clock and buy just one of JM's dvds and most of Gilad's workouts.
what i really love about this program is that it works the back muscles as well and not just your abs. there is a very good balance between back and front. this is extremely important! I can feel my abs stronger the second day and it seems that every time I do this workout I perform better (i.e. lift higher, maitain position for longer than before etc.) and this is encouraging in itself. It took me way longer to improve my form using other, more ""modern"" style workouts...
So I guess I'm back to the dinosaur age as JM called it. I'd rather be a healthy dinosaur than a sick GMO that only looks good! Good bye Jillian and welcome back Gilad! I hope you will expand your collection of dvds!",1404777600,7,2085,4.577540106951871
2650911,5,B000I0RNT8,"I have watched Gilad on TV for a while and enjoy his workouts.  The video is even more intense for getting in shape.  It is a slow process if you are way out of shape but after just a few workouts, I can already see huge differences in what I am able to do.  The only downside is the hilariously hideous outfits from the 90s.",1393804800,,325,3.9692307692307693
2650912,5,B000I0RNT8,"Really hits the abs in a different way, which is my philosophy in working out, to work the muscles in as many different ways as possible. I think that gives you the most well rounded body as well as keeping it interesting.",1393459200,,222,4.309523809523809

2650915,5,B000I0RNT8,"Gilad has to be one of the most motivating, fun, and authoritative instructors to work out with!  This DVD for the 'core' contains many effective excersizes that I hadn't seen before.  After only a few sessions my stomach, buttocks, and back were feeling stronger and less saggy.  It's also a fairly long DVD, so you have plenty of movements to choose from if there's not enough time to do the full workout.  The four other people excersizing with Gilad are also quite good.  They are pleasant, enthusiastic, fit looking, and perform the movements well.  Of course the Hawaiian background is typically Gilad, its beautiful and uplifting!  This is the best DVD for improving 'core' strength.",1367107200,,690,4.947826086956522

2650918,3,B000I0RNT8,"I have been doing P90X for a few months now and was in the market for a new workout when my friend told me about Gilad and his videos. So I bought a few to try it out. Lets just say I am fully satisfied with this workout. Occasionally I got frustrated because one of the things Gilad doesn't do is show you how to do some of the moves. But other then that, this is a great workout especially with Haiwaii in the background :) Enjoy",1306022400,,431,3.9655172413793105
2650919,5,B000I0RNT8,"My husband and I have been using the ""Gilad Core and More"" Exercise video for several weeks now. The DVD is great!

There is a wonderful 11-minute warm-up exercise segment that stretches your muscles to prepare for the core exercises.  I especially feel good about the core exercises that target my tummy to ""flatten it"" , and help strength my back and leg muscles.

I feel so much better every day I complete the exercises that Gilad has on this DVD. I am strengthening my tummy muscles and gradually flattening my tummy area.  Yeah!

This is the best exercise DVD I have ever purchased.  I am thinking about buying this DVD for some of my friends who want to lose weight and strengthen their core muscles.

I would highly recommend this DVD to any one who is serious about reducing their extra ""bulge"" in the tummy area.",1305244800,,822,4.551020408163265
2650920,5,B000I0RNT8,"I own 7 different DVDs of Gilad (Bodies in motion, total body sculpt, ultimate series). Working out with him for about 3 years. This is my favourite DVD out of all. I am not fan of aerobic parts and not interested in very intensive arm and leg muscules training. This DVD has a lot of abs!! and its great for me. After 1 year of  working out with this DVD i added weights to most of excercises and it works perfect to me. Not too hard and same time not too easy. I would suggest start with this DVD to any beginner who's not interested in aerobics :)",1299024000,,550,4.092592592592593

2650922,4,B000I0RNT8,"Its not the toughest workout video in that it focuses in on one part of the abs or other muscles, and it really won't make any particular muscles very sore.  Instead, this video is a good core video because it works all parts of your abs, lower back, gluts, and some of your upper legs.  I do this video 1-2 times per week, and it has gradually made me core more shapely in the core area, which is great for the beach.  I'm sure it would work faster if I did it more often, but I use this video as an ""easy"" day from harder workouts.",1277424000,2,533,4.009433962264151
2650923,2,B000I0RNT8,I didn't like it. I find the DVD boring. Sorry but I don't like it!! But I gave it to my husband and he like the DVD and he's been using ever since it was delivered and he said it target his abs and he has a better abs but not for me.,1266710400,,234,3.4339622641509435
2650924,3,B000I0RNT8,"This DVD is a good mix of traditional ab exercises and Pilates moves. Although I enjoy this work out and I think it works the entire core, I didn't find it to be too challenging. This would be good for a beginner or a low intermediate exerciser.

Workout: There is a long warm up (11 minutes) which includes squats, twists, shot puts, hammer throws, etc. which is a typical warm up for Gilad. The main work out is done all on the floor and it includes standard ab exercises such as variations on crunches with twists, scissors as well as Pilates exercises such as single leg stretch, roll ups, supermans, side leg lifts, planks, saw, etc.. There are a few stretching breaks in the 46 minute workout.

Setting: The DVD is set on a beautiful beach in Hawaii with the ocean in view.

Music: Typical of Gilad's shows, the music is instrumental and is just background music.

Crew: There are 4 people(3 women and Arthur) working out with Gilad who are always demonstrating perfect form.

Equipment Needed: 1 light dumbbell

Instructor: Gilad is pleasant and encouraging without being annoying. He cues well and explains proper form in an easy to understand way.

My only complaint with this work out is that I did not have to struggle to finish the work out the first time.",1266537600,,1268,4.608888888888889
2650925,4,B000I0RNT8,For those just entering into a regular workout regimen this DVD is a great way to begin.,1258416000,,88,4.235294117647059
2650926,3,B000I0RNT8,I love it but I find because my back is weak it bothered my neck.  Will continue this workout when I have more strengh in my neck and back.,1253404800,,139,3.793103448275862
2650927,3,B000I0RNT8,"The workout was challenging, but lacked intensity. It seemed slow-paced and built up too much. I prefer my workouts to be fast-paced. On his show, Gilad usually has a very short warm up followed by jumping right in with weights and strength training, then you do some short but intense cardio, and then you go right back to sculpting. In UBS, Gilad's warm-up feels drawn out. I found myself looking at the clock and thinking, wow I'm not even working out yet. The workout itself is challenging (probably more-so for beginners), but not very much so (less for advanced people). I can cut Gilad a bit of slack since the balance here is tough--if it's too hard beginners will be turned off; if it's not hard enough, then advanced viewers will feel let down. But this is supposed to be ""ULTIMATE"" body sculpt. I feel that the completely free series that still airs on FitTV is more of a challenge. And TBS is only 45 min long after you cut out commercials!

My abs definitely felt it after this workout, so this might be a good choice for someone who really wants to focus on defining their core or building core strength. But I didn't even break a sweat. Aside from a few leg moves, there isn't much ""more"". There's NO CARDIO at ALL, which it me is almost unforgivable. I can't call it a workout if I'm not dripping wet and exhausted at the end. And targeting your core will not give you a flat stomach if you don't burn that fat in the first place and I don't think I burned many calories or got my heart rate up during this workout.

I was also sad to see Gilad's entertaining personality so constrained. He was pure business. There was no interaction or banter with his crew and this is one of my favorite parts of his shows--my girlfriend and I have actually laughed out loud at some of Gilad's antics. But there is no such fun on this disc. You get great pointers on form, but no sense of personality. The others working out with Gilad might as well be anyone. Whereas on his show I've come to really enjoy Arthur and Kelly and Steve and the others that accompany Gilad and serve both as examples to follow and objects of empathy and comedic releif. The lack of this dynamic is a real loss for the replay value.

On the bright side, there were some new moves not used in his TBS show that I enjoyed. I just wish the pace was faster that there was less filler and that he could have thrown in some cardio or interval work. I don't see myself using this DVD. Why spend an hour on just my core when I can do my whole body in less time and also get cardio? Why spend my money on this DVD when I can get better from Gilad for free?

I was quite let down by this DVD and I'm going to make sure to rent the others before I even THINK about buying them. If the other discs to this series are like this one, I may just pass and go back to Gilad's older stuff and maybe try to find some new instructors.

Some people might enjoy this, but this just isn't what I look for in a workout program, nor is it Gilad's best. I'd recommend setting your DVR on FitTV and recording the free Total Body Sculpt series instead. Or, if you're already a Gilad fan, check out some of his other series and DVDs, such as Elite Forces.",1240358400,3,3207,4.250819672131148

2650930,5,B000I0RNT8,"This is a great workout for the entire core (stomach and back) and may seem deceptively easy. You may think it's less of a workout because you aren't as winded as you may be with his other workouts, but you will feel it days later. The more you work out with this one, the more you become aware of the targeted muscles you are working, and the stronger those muscles become, which really helps with posture. I've been using this workout now for five months, once a week (in tandem with his other workouts) and have seen a huge improvement in the definition and tone of my core areas. Great for beginners as well as advanced viewers.",1237507200,8,632,4.410256410256411
2650931,5,B000I0RNT8,"I LOVE this video.  Ab workouts are my favorite and it's tough to find one challenging enough to want to continue doing over and over again.  It's a solid hour and there are some pretty tough moves and some not so tough.  It has given me more strength than any other ab workout video I've done.  I will definitely keep using this in my weekly routine.  Gilad has crazy ABS of STEEL!  You probably won't sweat so much if you are intermediate or advanced, but I don't think it's meant for that.  There are a lot of pilates movements incorporated here along with standard core work and crunches.  My husband is just beginning to learn exercises and even he likes this video and has noticed a difference in his ability in just 3 weeks.  Good video for beginner to advanced (but advanced may find this a little on the easier side).",1232755200,,826,4.417218543046357

2650933,5,B000I0RNT8,"This is part of a 3 dvd set.  This one works the core of course.  Lots of ab work along with some back and butt work.  I'm an odd one that actually enjoys core work and have several core dvd workouts; I enjoy this one.  It's not a difficult, but there are sections that can be challenging. Rotate this with other workouts so your muscles don't get used to it, keep it a challenge.  Yes it can become to easy if you do it to often.

Don't plan on getting your heart rate up with this workout, that's not what it's for, so go walking/running or do something cardio when you use this one.",1227484800,6,585,4.087719298245614
2650934,5,B000I0RNT8,"I have several Gilad workouts and I really love this one.  All of the exercises work your core, but also all other body parts and it is not boring and he doesn't spend too much time on any one exercise which I hate.  This is my favorite workout by Gilad.  I love the beach setting and he is not annoying at all.  Check our Cathe for step (she is excellent) and The Firm for overall cardio workouts and a change.",1221091200,3,411,4.1

I hate doing ab work, but this workout is challenging, and fun. Gilad always finds new ways to keep me working out. I look forward to his dvd's.

2650940,4,B000I0RNT8,"I love Gilad. The exercises are effective. However, I thought 1/2 an hour would have been adequate. One hour was too long. I was disappointed with the music, boring and unmotivating.",1174435200,2,182,4.903225806451613
2650941,3,B000I0RNT8,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this video, but I really struggle with this being rated and ""advanced"" or ""ultimate"" ab workout. I also really enjoyed Gilad as an instructor, but it just wasn't that difficult.

Now for the details and a little commentary

1. the tape runs about 57 minutes: 10 minute warm up, 41 minutes of exercise and a 6 minute cool down.

2. The moves are not complicated at all. if you have done any basic calisthenics, yoga and pilates, you already know all of the moves. it is mostly variations on crunches, rollups, leg lifts, superman poses  for the back, and lateral leg lifts for the obliques. there are several well placed stretch breaks during the core part of the video.

3. Gilad is a terrific instructor. This is my first video of his, though I have seen him on TV. He is engaging, knowledgeable and encouraging and he works well with his workout partners in the video (3 girls and a guy).

4. the sequencing of the moves is very good, and he explains them well

5. the cool down is well done, and finishes with a relaxing breathing session.

6. the background is a nice Hawaiian beach, and the music is techno. It works well with the exercises

7. you will need a small weight/ dumbell to do some of the exercises. even a 3-5 pound one is fine for a man or woman.

My only real complaint is that in my view this is not an advanced workout, more like an intermediate one. I am reasonably fit, but my abs are by far my weakest area (no six pack here!), and I can blow right through this video very comfortably, with the exception of some of the oblique stuff.  I am more challenged doing 2 sets of 50 crunches and 20 leg lifts/ ""bicycles"" than I am executing all of this video.

So enjoy the video, but I would not expect this workout to give you abs like Gilad's. It's just not tough enough. if this were rated an intermediate, i'd give it a 4 or maybe a 5 star rating, but I think it's misrepresented as an advanced video.",1172793600,63,1954,4.294277929155314
