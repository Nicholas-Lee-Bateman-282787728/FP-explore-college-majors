8374361,4,B002MZZU2Y,"""The Naked Flame"" A.K.A. ""Deadline for Murder"" was made in 1963, released in 1970, filmed in Alberta Canada at the Banff National Park.  This 90 minute drama presentation was Kasey Rogers' last acting role, as the forbidden love interest, Elena.  She lived a full life after that, and died at 80 years of age - she starred in many TV series, and films, this was her last acting performance.  Kasey Rogers was better known for her roles in ""Peyton Place,"" ""Bewitched,"" and the 1951 film ""Strangers on a Train.""  The story is about ethnicity pride among the Doukhobors (Russian Orthodox sect of isolationists), a group of people who resisted the idea of a Canadian man marrying a woman from their village.  The film has rape, murder, arson, bigotry, and basically a town bully who is easy to hate.  The unusual style of protest by the women folk of the village is what drew the crowds to the theater, and is what the title, ""The Naked Flame,"" was coined after.  The portrayal of rape in this film is milquetoast by today's film industry standard, as is the violence or the gore.  Predominantly it has to do with legal systems and justice, and how sometimes things are not always as they seem.  This is a Z-movie without the women sharing their jiggly sweater puppies with the viewing audience, and not very much scenery or architecture can be commented upon any more than the acting abilities of anybody in the film.  Laughable attempt to make a serious movie on a ridiculously low budget, yet no doubt a big hit for the gratuitous exploitation of a few incredibly attractive women.  Don't confuse this with the black-and-white film also called ""Deadline for Murder"" that was released in 1946 - that version is a different story, and cast.  This version being reviewed is one of those films few admit to viewing, owning, or glad they bought it so they can watch it again.",1318809600,6,1869,4.681957186544342
