8036199,4,B0004Z35NK,"This is nice DVD on the history of Judo. It is though, more related to the spread of Judo in Europe than world wide, but it's interesting and worth watching.",1466640000,,157,4.266666666666667
8036200,5,B0004Z35NK,Excellent documentary for judokas interested in historical videos.,1444262400,,66,7.375
8036201,3,B0004Z35NK,"Interesting history of sport/competition judo but the video never touched on Master Kano's self defense or jujitsu applications. the video only shows how judo became a world wide recognized sport, however the video almost  makes it seem as if  Master Kaano eliminated all aspects of self defense and Jujitsu(which is not true) and barely speaks of his principal of Maximum Efficiency with Minimum Effort"" and ""Mutual Welfare and Benefit."" I was hoping this video would explain Master Kano's organizing of Jujitsu techniques and the history behind changing from Jujitsu (Gentle art) Judo(Gentle way). This video was very broad and interesting for those in the sport however I Highly recommend Master Kano's books over this video.  Jigoro Kano did not eliminate the dangerous defense base aspects of Jujitsu to create Judo, he was eliminating wasted effort. Some schools still refer to Jujitsu techniques as advanced Judo Techniques.

(Master Kano's Books are: Kodokan Judo, Mind over Muscle,Judo (Jujutsu))",1355788800,2,1005,5.423076923076923
8036202,5,B0004Z35NK,"My Sensei had been showing this ancient VHS tape of The HIstory of Judo.  Because the tape was showing significant signs of wear, I bought this for him to show at our dojo.  He always showed the tape to the new people during the first class just to give a brief history and for them to understand what they were getting into.  Sensei was so excited the first time he showed this new DVD to the class.  It provided the details that any Judoka would want to know yet it gave some basic perspectives for the new students joining the class.  It is a fantastic DVD for anyone interested in Judo to watch.  There are some parts that a beginner may need some explanation for but overall it is entertaining for all.",1303516800,,707,4.318181818181818
8036203,5,B0004Z35NK,A great documentary on the history of Judo in Europe.  It shows the founder Jigoro Kano Sensei performing on video which is great to see.  It also shows outstanding Judo competitors.  If you enjoy the art of Judo you will enjoy this DVD.,1302739200,,237,4.465116279069767
8036204,5,B0004Z35NK,Good primer on judo history up to ca. 1997.  Some good competition & demo clips.,1245974400,2,80,4.333333333333333
8036205,5,B0004Z35NK,This is a very interesting documentary about the history of this Japanese discipline. It shows some people who has practiced JUDO as the French man of science Frdric JOLIOT-CURIE.,1220659200,,179,5.206896551724138
8036206,5,B0004Z35NK,"The previous reviewer was probably right - for a person who is not a judoka and has no clue about the sport, this DVD won't make much sense.  But for a big fan of judo, it is great!!!  You'll love it!",1191888000,5,200,3.8536585365853657
8036207,3,B0004Z35NK,"English language version of French TV show on the history of judo.  Strong points are interesting historical video of Kano, Mifune, and the evolving international nature of judo.  Historically interesting shots of major internatational judoka in comptetition. Weak on origins of judo.
Overall interesting and fun to watch but leaves you wishing for a more comprehensive ""history"".",1056240000,4,380,5.649122807017544
