2072985,4,B0002A0JMM,I have the current copy of this collector's item on sale. It is a newer release and the copy is  bright and as clear  as it can be for the era when it was released. I have found this version of the classic novel to be a better story than the two or three versions that followed it.,1162944000,5,281,3.8275862068965516
2072986,1,B0002A0JMM,"I have searched for this version of Swiss Family Robinson for years and years.  I finally found it.  I remember this version after seeing it as a child.  It contains good story scenes that are not included in the Disney versions.  Also, Disney has added scenes and characters that were not in the original version.

However, I am so disappointed in the quality of the copy that I received.  Most of the movie was so dark I could not see the characters.  I would have returned it immediately but I was afraid I would not be able to find it again and sincerely want it in my video library.  I realize that this is a very old film and clearer copies my not be attainable.",1116288000,8,668,4.288
8024909,5,B0002A0JMM,I wish that someone would put this in a regular DVD format and not blue ray unless they are a package deal. This in my opinion is is by far the best of all the  Swiss Faily Robinson Family films ever made. I'd give it a 10******* rating anytime. E. Renna,1498262400,,254,3.980392156862745

8024911,2,B0002A0JMM,"like other reviewers this was one of my favorite movies as a kid and have longed for a dvd release..  I have read the book at least a dozen times over my lifetime, and having read it just this year, Seeing the old movie was not as complete as the adventures the book portrays.  What impresses a 10 year old when I first saw it, is not as critical as seeing it now in my old age.  The 2 stars is because of the picture quality not the content of the movie.  I don't know who owns the original film of this movie or even if  existsso who knows if it will ever be restored.  All the reviewers are correct about the darkness and lack of greyscale, but for those of us who are fans of the movie what we got is perhaps better than nothing at all.  If you really want to enjoy this true story read the book... Unfortunately the dvd is out of print and if you can find a copy of it it is way overpriced..",1417219200,,896,3.9444444444444446
8024912,4,B0002A0JMM,"Truer adaptation of Johann Wyss book and much darker than the later Disney version. Tale of a shipwreck, the Swiss family Robinson must struggle to forge a new life on their deserted island away from civilisation. The special effects are very impressive for this 1940 forgotten gem! Orson Welles is uncredited in opening narration.",1411257600,,331,5.148148148148148
8024913,1,B0002A0JMM,"Product is not  as advertised, quality is very poor and difficult to watch as it is jumpy and it appears to have missing parts. It should be advertised as a used home made copy and not lead one to believe it will come in a professionally designed holder as pictured in the ad. Also for this poor example it is very overpriced. Will not be purchasing any other items from Mother Goose and will more cautious about Amazon .com.",1389398400,,425,4.379746835443038
8024914,3,B0002A0JMM,"The 1940's version is more engrossing emotionally and
far more realistic in many of it's scenes.  The acting is
more gripping and draws you in.

If you have ever been in a tsunami, then you know what
I mean.

Having said the above, I find that this version is a very
poor copy with many dark scenes and does not appear
to have had any post cleaning up.  You may never find
a better version.

The reason that you probably won't find any better, is
(according to the Internet, Disney purchased all of the
rights and copies) I have found none in the public domain
that are better.  I remember this version from when I was
very young and have looked for it for several decades.

Some on the Internet say that Disney didn't want any
comparisons with their 1960's remake.

I sure would like to find a better version !",1362960000,,811,4.324503311258278
8024915,4,B0002A0JMM,"I first saw this movie in the 1950's on our first television set. The local Cleveland channel would show a particular movie three times in a row every Saturday. My sisters and I were so fascinated by this movie that we watched it through all three times. There is a scene in the film where a BIG spider crawls from a huge web and down the neck of a boy. Although the special effects and story are definitely old-time, the suspense and message are timeless. Watch this with your family with a bag of popcorn in a darkened room. (Just be aware the big spider is creapy.)",1323561600,2,568,4.317757009345795
8024916,4,B0002A0JMM,"The seller got the video to me FAST, which I appreciate. But the print quality is awful! You can hardly se some of the images as its either super dark or all white some of the time. From what I CAN see, however, it looks to be a spectacular movie and the three boys playing the brothers- ESPECIALLY my favorite, Freddie Bartholomew- are terrific! I only wish we had  better print",1313452800,,379,4.338028169014085
8024917,5,B0002A0JMM,"This 1940 black-and-white film version is much more faithful to the original Johann Wyss novel, and is not the laugh- and cheese-fest that the 1960 Disney color version is. It's an intriguing story all its own.

The print has not been remastered, so it's dark in several places, and therefore best viewed in a completely dark room. Still, it's not as bad as some have intimated, and is about a 7 out of 10 in print quality. Well worth watching, especially for nostalgists and purists and especially if you are fan of any of the actors. Thomas Mitchell (Scarlett's father in the previous year's Gone With the Wind) gives an excellent performance as the doting and concerned father who wishes only that his sons grow up with wisdom and depth and maturity.

Freddie Bartholomew is delightful as the foppish son who out-Pimpernels Pimpernel (that's a Leslie Howard reference if you haven't seen that movie). Long-lashed and doe-eyed young Terry Kilburn overacts in a couple bits but is largely quite rewarding as the young son who loves reading and writing. Edna Best is sometimes a bit annoying as the mother, but that's what her role demands, and she is often lovely and charming as well.  Tim Holt is fine as the eldest of the four sons, which include a baby who doesn't talk.

All in all, definitely worth it if you are inclined. I've seen it on eBay and other venues if it's out of stock here -- for instance you can Google the title in quotes plus Retro Flix in quotes.",1307491200,10,1471,4.624521072796935
8024918,1,B0002A0JMM,"This movie is one of my all time favorites, but upon viewing my new purchase of Swiss Family Robinson with Thomas Mitchell on both a standard DVD player and a BlueRay HD player, found the video quality abhorrent.  As a black and white film on digital video, the blacks and whites were strong, but the gray-scale was missing which delineates the image features between black and white.  In other words there were no grays in the black and white color which helps define all of the mid tones.  The faces of the actors were washed out and the overall movie frame was outlined in black to gray smudges.  If the film has deteriorated beyond saving then I guess my copy is to be expected and you can follow the story line as is, but a visually painful experience.

In the event there is a digitally remastered copy of this movie for sale in the future, please notify me.",1291420800,12,864,4.443037974683544
