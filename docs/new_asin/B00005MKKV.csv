1626721,5,B00005MKKV,"Emma Thompson is incredible, in a riveting performance about a woman professor who prides herself on her perseverance and steadfastness, dealing with not only a serious case of cancer but the de-personalization associated with its treatment.
This movie is not for those who want light entertainment. It is a serious movie that may lead you to think more closely on how you live your life and how much consideration you have for others in it.
Emma Thompson plays Dr. Vivian Bearing a staunch English professor specializing in a 17th century poet, Donne, most well known for his poems on death and the afterlife, or lack thereof.
Ironically, Dr. Bearing though literate to the greatest degree on this most difficult of authors, has never really absorbed in a human sense the material she has spent her life researching. It was all abstract. In this sense she has been very ""abstract"" in dealing with the people around her as well.
Initially in dealing with the disease, Dr. Bearing has attempted to maintain this abstract distance with her own disease, refusing to yield to the potential reality of its outcome. Through discussions with a former student who is now one of the doctors treating her, she comes to judge her own actions by observing those around her.
Not wanting to give the movie away, I can only say, it is a hard movie not to cry throughout. Anyone who has seen a family member go through cancer treatment will recognize some of the buzzwords and much of the inadvertant rudeness of the medical staff. This is not meant as a complaint. I can see how this happens. The staff may have to; as a matter of self-preservation, keep a distance to continue to do this work day-to-day. For the patient though, this is as personal as it gets.
In one scene, Emma Thompson as Dr. Bearing has a discussion with her former student where he refers to patients as a means to an end for his research, not considering he is also refering to the very patient he is now treating. Her character is content to keep this abstraction, but you as the viewer are well aware of the biting coldness of this discussion. Magnificent writing, heartless reality. Numbing emotionally.
Great movie, it is emotionally wrenching to watch however.",1007337600,25,2224,4.7642487046632125

1626724,5,B00005MKKV,"Visually, ""Wit"" is a stunner.  Shot in high contrast (by ace cinematographer Seams McGarvey), every detail in the camera's frame is perfectly presented, and nothing is hidden from the viewer.  Every fold and wrinkle and twinkle in Emma Thompson's face is laid bare for all to see.  The halls of the hospital are spic-and-span clean, sleek and sterile to the point of being heavenly.  But they have nothing to do with heaven, really.  In fact, the setting is more like a ghostly purgatory, where one woman is caught between life and death.
That one woman is Dr. Vivian Bearing, a professor of literature specializing in the enigmatic poems of John Donne, and recently diagnosed cancer patient.  In her civilian life she was a contentious, stubborn, and demanding teacher.  As a patient she's reflective, intelligent, emotionally repressed, and, of course, witty.  I can't imagine another actress pulling off all of these qualities more readily than Emma Thompson.  Her English properness combined with her easy drollness fit perfectly into the role.  She is able to play the role's 'wit' without batting an eye.  What I didn't expect from her was an intense emotionality.  Thompson can, at times, be too cold and too calculating in her acting.  But in my favourite of her roles (""The Tall Guy"", ""In The Name of the Father"", ""The Remains of the Day"") her passion valiantly fights through the cold veneer.  Such is the case here.  Thompson's Dr. Bearing begins the film as a cynical scholar, but she slowly sheds that persona, eventually exposing her emotions like a gaping wound.  And it's not just a persona change that she undergoes; she is ravaged physically as well.  In the beginning, Thompson sports an elegant head of black hair, speckled with distinguished grey.  Her eyes are alive with fire and her face is rubbery and expressive like only Emma can be.  But as her chemotherapy progresses, she loses that head of hair, her eyebrows and eyelashes.  And she becomes gaunt and sickly.  The film has done the impossible: it has sapped Emma Thompson of all her strength and vitality, and boy is that a heartbreaking effect.
The rest of the cast is distinguished, but pales in comparison next to Thompson's perfect performance.  They're all insignificant satellites revolving around her Jupiter.  Christopher Lloyd as her doctor, Jonathan M. Woodward as his ambitious student (and, in a malicious twist, a former student of Dr. Bearing's; this fact becomes quite embarrassing for her during a routine pelvic exam, that has both the patient and the young doctor cringing in discomfort), and Audra McDonald as a dim but well-meaning and overly protective nurse, all do fine, understated work.  They are the recipients of Dr. Bearing's pointed barbs, for she feels used and abused as they treat her more as an object to be studied rather than a person to be cured.  The power of 'Wit', however, the thing that elevates it above other patient-vs.-ambitious-doctor films, is that in a way this is turnabout as fair play.  For the most part we sympathize with Vivian; how can these educated doctors have such poor bedside manner?  But in a quick flashback, we see Dr. Bearing, the professor, with little sympathy for a student asking for an extension.  She is cold-hearted in her pursuit of creating perfect scholars, just as her doctors are cold-hearted in using her as a research tool.  She used to be the one ruthlessly deconstructing the text; now, she is the text.  She used to be the one discussing death in very theoretical terms; now death is staring her in the face, and her scholarly instincts are of no help to her.  It's a fascinating dramatic predicament.
Director Mike Nichols (who, with Thompson, co-adapted Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize winning stage play) composes his film of a series of long, static shots.  He gets a lot of mileage out of allowing the camera to focus on Thompson's face, until the audience can't take the sight of this formerly beautiful now hideously ravaged woman staring back at them.  It can get uncomfortable at times, but that's what makes the film terribly moving.  And his use of flashbacks, going back and forth through time several times in the same scene, is used judiciously and effectively.  One of the film's most touching moment has Dr. Bearing recalling the moment when she fell in love with words, reading Beatrix Potter books in her father's study (while being coaxed gently on by her father, played by playwright Harold Pinter).  Bearing at age six is suddenly replaced by Thompson's Bearing, acting like six, but dressed in her hospital garb and bald head.  Nichols never lets these moments become maudlin, and thus they are surprisingly effective.
Oh good lord, this is a touching movie.  It spares you nothing, and if you're up for the challenge, you'll be thankful for its trust.",1004918400,17,4837,4.925925925925926

1626726,4,B00005MKKV,"The director and cast have done a fine job in putting this multi-layered screenplay together as a film. If you're not familiar with the play, or the story, you may have to watch it again to catch some of the nuances. That may be difficult, because the subject matter is so gut-wrenching at the emotional level.  See the other reviews below for more details.  Personally, I think Margaret Edson did a wonderful job balancing the pain and suffering with genuine humor and warmth, although the humor comes across better on stage.
I first saw ""Wit"" in its original performance at South Coast Repertory Theater in Costa Mesa, California, and thought it was the finest play I had ever seen. Since then, we've seen it twice more on the stage, most recently at the Barter Theater in Abingdon, Virginia. In every instance, the actress playing Vivian Bearing did a superb job, and the audience gets the full impact when in a small, intimate theater, seating only 150 or so people. There's a visceral connection as you watch Professor Bearing metamorphose before your eyes from a confident woman, certain of herself and her place in the world, needing no one, through the terrible effects of chemotherapy and its humbling of your soul, to a place of final acceptance and transcendence.
And some of that doesn't make it into this film adaption, perhaps because it's harder for the actress to connect with the audience in the film medium than it is in person. At the end of the play, on stage the actress slowly moves away from the Code Blue team, in effect watching her body die, but moving toward an ever-brightening light as she moves from this existence. That's a powerful image.  It's also not in the film.
The performances on this DVD were excellent, though, as are the quality of the picture and sound on DVD. One disappointment, though - Emma Thompson did such a superb job in her commentary on the DVD for ""Sense and Sensibility"" that I wish they had added a commentary track with her and Mike Nichols as a special feature for this DVD. While this was a very good movie, the DVD falls a little short of the kind of special features that we have come to expect now of high quality DVDs, and this, plus my view that it's not as good as the stage play version, caused me to rate it as 4 stars.",1000857600,14,2286,4.570731707317073
1626727,4,B00005MKKV,"**SPOILER ALERT ** -- I touch on the ending of this movie in my review.

Two wonderful works are highlighted in ""Wit"" -- one of John Donne's Holy Sonnets (""Death be not proud"") and ""The Runaway Bunny"" by Margaret Wise Brown. ""Wit""'s author, Margaret Edson, pulls these two seemingly distant texts into her script and uses them in the most amazing (witty?) way.

Donne's metaphysical sonnets are notoriously difficult and are often approached as beautifully wrought puzzles -- puzzles that are so intellectually daunting the emotion that underlies them is sometimes missed. ""The Runaway Bunny,"" on the other hand, is probably seen by many readers as a very simple tale full of feeling but not particularly challenging. Yet Edson shows us how deep and multilayered a children's tale can be while also demonstrating the basic human feeling underneath the most cerebral of poems. The simple becomes complex; the complex, simple.

We get the most out of literature when we approach it with our full humanity engaged, ignoring neither our thoughts nor our feelings. ""Wit"" tells us that we get the most out of life when we approach it in the same way.

Emma Thompson's cancer-stricken English professor, Vivian Bearing, ultimately triumphs over death by surrendering to it -- and it is this Donne-ish paradox that ""Wit"" illustrates so well. In the end, ""Wit"" wisely questions the notions 1) that intellect and emotion are two separate faculties and 2) that simplicity and complexity are necessarily opposites. (One hallmark of Donne's ""wit"" -- a term Donne's contemporaries would've understood as creative invention -- was its examination of semantic antonyms.) ""Wit"" also reminds us that the infinite can be both large and small.

John Donne knew this stuff, and apparently so did Margaret Wise Brown. And, luckily for us, so does ""Wit""'s author, Margaret Edson. By the way, if you've never read the above-mentioned Donne poem, here it is:

Holy Sonnet (""Death be not proud"") by John Donne
Death be not proud, though some have called thee / Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not soe, / For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow, / Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill mee; / From rest and sleepe, which but thy pictures bee, / Much pleasure, then from thee, much more must flow, / And soonest our best men with thee doe goe, / Rest of their bones, and soules deliverie. / Thou'art slave to Fate, chance, kings, and desperate men, / And dost with poyson, warre, and sicknesse dwell, / And poppie,' or charmes can make us sleepe as well, / And better then they stroake; why swell'st thou then? / One short sleepe past, wee wake eternally, / And death shall be no more, Death thou shalt die.",998697600,46,2703,4.8652173913043475
1626728,5,B00005MKKV,"If you were fortunate enough to see Wit on HBO, then you probably agree that it made you a better person. Wit takes you through the horrible journey of cancer, down to its rawness, to its darkest moments. Incredibly, though you would think so, this movie was not depressing...it was uplifting. The intelligence and inspiring idea's behind Vivian Bearing (Emma Thompson) is that you can find irony and humility within the written word. She is a literary professor that takes her studies very seriously, believing her lessons will one day help her student's find understanding in life. All too soon she realizes that she will need it more than she could have ever fathomed. Christopher Lloyd does terrifically as her personal physician, and shows a new side to his tallent. Personally, I more enjoyed the scenes when she sits and talks to us as if we were there with her, experiencing the pain, knowing what she knows and feeling what she feels. As if we are Vivian's only friends. Rarely...and I rarely distribute the word rarely...a movie like Wit comes along, and deals with a subject that is all too common, and yet sheds a brighter light, for us to see and learn something new. Emma Thompsons performance is one of the greatest one-woman shows in the history of film. Though her surrounding characters were greatly supportive, she carried the film, there's no doubting it. As Vivian Bearing, she is unshakable as a heart-set woman determined to succeed. By using her wit, those things we find so horrible, will suddenly make sense.",995155200,9,1534,4.858778625954199

Professor Bearing has done that worst thing of all; she has walked through an unlived life.  Worse, she's reminded of it because she suddenly is stricken with aggressive cancer which forces her into taking chemotherapy, though the viewer's intuition after the film is that she probably wouldn't have done that again.

Her life has been spent as a stuck up academe who failed students unnecessarily, or was cruel to them in terms of hours of research or studying even after their relatives had died.  Even her academic mentor just comes to see her by accident; she was ""in town"".  She has mastered the metaphysical poets; Donne, Milton, all of them.  When her teacher cradles her and asks her if she wants to hear any of their poetry, she utters a very decisive ""No"".  Her doctor, Jason, a former student and a sort of aspie guy obsessed with cancer and the various fascinating machinations it offers is a lot like his teacher.  He can't really express emotion outside theory.  Though she asked for a DNR, he tries to save her life partly out of alarm but also ""because she's research!"".

This movie is a tragedy in quite a many ways. The sad thing is she was actually a kind lady who had a facade no one ever cracked.

1626810,5,B00005MKKV,"1. I enjoyed this fine piece of drama, which--among other things--raised the question of whether academic excellence need necessarily (or ideally) feature an excessive degree of acerbity and even animosity on the part of the instructor. I will share with you that I had a graphics arts instructor a few years ago, who was not only exceedingly demanding, but stunk of incivility, and had not a whit of integrity. When I conferred with the department chairperson about this churlish character, I was told that, ""Yes, but the fellow who'd preceded him was even worse."" (apparently an academic nit-whit!!). Now, I'm NOT advocating the lowering of every university class to an elementary level (a namby-pamby, unrealistic approach). Certainly some courses are, by definition, pretty damn challenging. In my case, college level chemistry-and neurology--courses come to mind. Yet, in my view, learning should not--by defnintion-- be an unpleasant, ""hitting one's head against the wall"" level of frustration (or even personally denigrating), experience. And, if a student is not ""getting it,"" this may sometimes reflect the teacher's inadequacy (or even incompetence).

Our story here very accurately reflected the reality of a cancer patient's experience while on chemotherapy in a modern cancer facility, and we come to see a VENEER of respect and humanity on the part of this professor-patient's doctors. Yet, aside from the primary care nurse, and--much later--her university mentor (perhaps an apparition), there is extremely little compassion and respect for her as an actual and distinct individual. Not only that, but we eventually come to see--full realization--that her doctors were MUCH more concerned with her as research material--essentially a lab animal--than with her health and the possibility of recovery. One might say that it was particularly telling when her young attending physician noticed her apparent death. Disregarding her request for DNR (""Do not resuscitate!), he immediately began performing CPR procedures, and called the ""crash team"" to assist him in resuscitating his patient...and they still persisted, even though her nurse yelled for them to stop..about a half-dozen times. Thus, even in death, these people refused to honor her wishes and dignity...and recognize her humanity.

2. If I may, I will now add something as a medical professional. As it happens, current cancer medicine is 180 degrees wrong. It is based on fatally flawed theory, and the corresponding forms of treatment--surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy--based on the flawed theory, minimally are worthless, and maximally place the patient in serious jeopardy. They typically represent terrible disfiguration, and hellacious side-effects, such as hair-loss, nausea and vomiting (associated with destruction of the G.I. tract epithelium, with deterioration of food assimilation function in the gut), and ""trashing"" of the immune system (even liver and kidney failure) (which is why, even if a tumor is removed, very frequently there is subsequent metastasis throughout the body.

3. ""But we have no other options?!!"" you might say. Not so. ""Cancer is the tumor!!""...nope, flawed theory. The tumor is symptomatic of a severe metabolic derangement. An intelligent physician would want to treat the CAUSE, not the signs and symptoms, but this kind of these kinds of doctors are few, and far between. Please consult an Alternative Cancer resource  such as the Cancer Control Society in Los Angeles. Possibly also do some homework, and invesigate the work of Dr. Otto Warburg. His work--nearly a century ago--was the seminal work, an incredible breakthrough--in coming to understand the nature and development of cancer....the ACTUAL etiology of the disease. Your typical oncologist hasn't a clue. He or she is there for the research...or just for the money...I promise you. Some are even your current ""reincarnation"" of Dr. Mengele. Can you recall what our protagonist's doctor said, toward the very end? He said,"" I never thought she'd be able to handle the full dose!"" The attending physician was, on the surface, intelligent and amicable, but routinely created havoc and incredible levels of pain and misery among his patients, dispensing of mayhem and agony, all in the name of ""research."" In a word, a monster.

4. Of course, the ""subplot,"" so to speak, was the professor's learning that she had been--in a minor key--the same kind of difficult and coldly distant professional with her students, as was her oncologist. Learning that teaching is much more than intense and complex academic cerebral gymnastics (and meeting a term paper deadline, and and--without exception--reaping an ""A""). There is human compassion and a genuine intent to assist or uplift one's charges. There is also, among premiere teachers, attention placed on flexibility and creativity, in an effort to effectively communicate, not block or obscure...or even to impress with one's experience and scholarship. There was much pathos in the fact that it required such a dreadful experience to provide this lesson for her.",1448755200,,5090,5.446134347275032

The research hospital's staff are portrayed as uncaring, lacking empathy, and often manners. Having watched my parents die in teaching hospitals, I thought it was pretty realistic. The doctors, interns and residents seemed to see my parents more as practice dummies than people. They ordered many unnecessary tests and treatments.

Vivian had a wonderful nurse, though. And most of the nurses who cared for my parents were wonderful as well. The doctors spoke as if they didn't think anyone could or should die under their care.

A bravura performance by a great actor. At times painful to watch, but in the end, she develops her humanity to a level well beyond that of her doctors, and seems to find intternal peace after a long, painful journey that procedes, and may have contributed, to her illness.",1436140800,,579,5.020833333333333

1626855,5,B00005MKKV,"I stumbled upon this movie by accident while flipping through channels one lazy day.  This isn't the sort of movie I typically watch, as I'm not just real drawn to dramas or anything overly heavy and depressing. I usually gravitate to the TV when I need something light-hearted, some mental down time or am in the mood for a weekend horror marathon.

Something of Emma's face, when my eyes landed on it, arrested my attention. I was captivated by her portrayal of a woman diagnosed with and dying from ovarian cancer. The plot has been summarized before, so I'll just tell you how it made me FEEL.

I felt I had a better understanding of the fear someone in her situation feels. I felt overwhelming empathy for what it is to look back on your life with regret in your final days, when nothing can be done to go back in time and live your life differently. I felt the merciless cold of what it would be to die without family or friends at your side. I felt the uselessness of her wit to spare her from her suffering and death, or to become the arms she desperately needed wrapped around her during her last months of life.

Emma is spectacular in her role as the unfeeling, off-putting, robotic, intellectual elitist who comes too late to know what it is to really feel the absence of humanity and love in her life. The cancer that is robbing her of her life is a terrible sight made worse by the inhumanity of the healthcare system. For me what was worse than her physical pain from her cancer was watching someone die completely and utterly alone.

Before you watch Wit, think of something fun you'll do afterwards. You'll need it.

Trust me.",1435017600,6,1643,4.46

She does quite a bit more than that in this shattering performance, as an antisocial professor undergoing experimental treatment for cancer.  As a social commentary on the pioneering efforts in the medical profession in the early battles against cancer, it is an indictment of the doctors who apparently had zero consideration for their patients as actual people. As the character study of a woman who has lived as though she needs no one (and she teaches 17th c. literature, including John Donne, for God's sake!), it is heartwrenching, beautiful, rewarding.

After she is diagnosed, she listens attentively and carefully to the doctor's explanation. She is logical and smart and understands the implications. As the movie moves on, we see her in situations dealing with the staff and with her own past. Conversations are on-going whether with others or mostly in dialogue form as she talks her way through her torture.

None of the hospital employees or physicians mean to be callous, in fact they try to be caring and professional. Unfortunately it comes across cruel and as though she ceased to be human and just a number to be called on when her turn came for treatment.

It is a profound story of the slow yet fast ravages of cancer on a healthy body. Emma Thompson is for lack of a better word Brilliant.

She treated her students as if they were animals, and she was the trainer. However, after being diagnosed with a terminally ill cancer, she reevaluate how she treated people because on her last days, she had no one to even wash her ass for her. This movie is great for some people who treat other people like crap. It will give them a wake up call. Also, I see many people assume this movie is also about the medical profession and a clear demonstration on how not to treat a patient, however, I feel as if the plot was intended to treat this woman as horrible as she treated her students.

Her performance is an honest, realistic and brilliant tribute to those suffering from such a tragic disease. A great but rather depressing story. This performance is the sort that certainly must be both challenging and horribly painful to experience. It's not a very gratifying subject to begin with, but this character is played so honestly and beautifully by Emma that one can't help but admire her courage for her willingness to take on such a difficult role. I have admired her as an actress ever since seeing her as a determined attorney in 'In the name of the father', but never before has she laid her soul so bare as she does here. She seems to accept the reality of her illness rather well compared to how some would react. And she constantly tried to find something positive or even humorous in even the most degrading moments. Her outlook is realistic and at the same time she remains optimistic to some degree. But as time passes her feelings of isolation, worry and fear become impossible to contain, as does her pain. This is a painful thing to experience as an audience member, and Emma Thompson delivers an unforgettable performance I will not soon forget.",1367971200,,1404,4.73469387755102

It is moving and communicates powerfully precisely because it doesn't manipulate our emotions or make any judgments about Dr. Bearing or those caring for her..it gives each person spiritual and intellectual room to open to what is possible to see and understand. As a survivor of advanced cancer and a ravagingly aggressive cure I can attest to the stark reality of what is portrayed in this film.  I strongly encourage anyone with a friend or relative with a poor cancer prognosis and all care givers of the terminally ill to see this film..perhaps over and over. It will give you a big head start on being a mindfully present companion to your loved one through their journey.

1627048,4,B00005MKKV,"The Fry and Laurie special that was broadcast last year reminded me that Hugh Laurie's oldest son Charlie had a debut of sorts in an ABOFAL skit, at the ripe old age of 5 or 6 months (I am estimating).

It also reminded me that his youngest child, Rebecca Laurie, also found her way before the camera, playing the younger version of the character played by Emma Thompson in the 2001 HBO movie Wit.  I recently got to see it, and was amazed at the sheer quality of the performance by everyone involved.

The movie is about a college professor who was forced to reassess her life when she was diagnosed with cancer.  Most of the speaking was engagingly done by Emma, mostly breaking and occasionally demolishing the ""fourth wall"" (addressing the audience, and even doing a little storyline adjusting - Emma is actually a co-director of the movie) as she narrated Vivian Bearing's story.

Rebecca's scene was a flashback, when the 5 year old Vivian, with the gentle and skillful help of her professor father, came to love words as she learned how to pronounce, define, and put into conversation a word from a children's book.

The movie won an Emmy award and a Humanitas Prize, and the play from which it was adapted won a Pulitzer Prize.  It is rated PG-13, probably because of a few revealing seconds toward the end of the movie.

I rarely watch HBO movies, mostly because I don't see the need to carry the extra expense. But although I got it mainly because this young girl who has many of her father's best features is in it, now I am really glad I saw this movie for its own sake.",1295827200,,1582,4.487804878048781

1627101,5,B00005MKKV,"I was attending an oncology nursing convention the first time I saw this film shortly after its release.  My  best memory of it was that it was the most searingly honest portrayal of a person with cancer that I has ever witnessed outside of hospital.  It was also the most powerfully honest portrayal of a nurse that I had seen in any media.  My recent second viewing only confirmed those impressions.

Wit is based on a play by Margaret Edson who at one time in her life worked as a unit clerk on an oncology ward.  This teleplay was written by Mike Nichols and Emma Thompson, both Academy Award winners.  Ms. Thompson inhabits the role of Vivian Bearing, a British professor of English, specializing in the poetry of John Donne.  Bearing is a brilliant scholar, aloof, and demanding as much of her students as she does of herself.  She is both feared and revered on campus.  Then she gets diagnosed with Stage IV advanced ovarian cancer and is enrolled in a very difficult eight month course of an experimental chemotherapy regimen.  She has never married, has never had children, and has won more rivals than friends in her academic career.

Nearly the whole action of the film takes place in hospital.  In transposing the piece from theater to film, the director retains the device of the character speaking directly to the audience in extended monologues.  Though not a properly cinematic device, it works perhaps even better here than on the stage because of the camera's ability to frame Thompson's face in close-ups that convincingly capture her deteriorating appearance and her growing desperation.

""Wit"" can be defined as a form of intellectual humor.  The monologues demand careful listening, part of their power stemming from erudite puns and other language tricks and paradoxes.  Wit is also the basis of style in metaphysical poetry such as Donne's, a contemporary of Shakespeare.  This ""wit' along with Donne's obsession with the intersections of love, death, and religion become central to Bearing's metamorphosis.  Over the course of treatment her health declines.  The tumor shrinks but metastasizes.  She comes to realize that she has devalued love and affection in favor of reason and intellect.

Her doctors are researchers rather than clinicians.  They are drawn to the science rather than the art of healing.  There are certainly oncologists with more empathy and better bedside manner than seen here.  But the portraits are not exaggerated.  Their determined, exacting approach to science mirrors Prof Bearing's approach to literature.  Of all the hospital staff, it is only her nurse, Susie Monahan, who recognizes and respects the humanity of this dying woman's situation.  Actress Audra McDonald (who would be later cast as a physician inTV's Gray's Anatomy) manages to play Susie as an authentic human being without falling to sentimentality or stereotype.

This is possibly Emma Thompson's best screen performance.  She is totally convincing as a cancer patient, whether she is enduring intractible nausea and vomiting or hoarsely whispering poetry through a great veil of pain.  Having spent two decades working in hospital, I can say that the entire production is very realistic and true.  Medical procedures, staff interactions, power differentials in the hospital hierarchy, nurses working to advocate for patients are reflected rather than highlighted as the drama proceeds.  The ""Grand Rounds"" scene would be funny if it weren't so sad.  ""That was very educational"" Bearing says, ""I am learning to suffer.""

""Wit"" remains one of the very best examples of this genre.  It is brilliantly informative at both an intellectual and emotional level.  I would recommend it to anyone, but especially to anyone close to someone dealing with cancer.  For persons with cancer, watching this film can be an enlightening though painful journey of self-exploration.",1252454400,6,3886,5.1584

1627121,5,B00005MKKV,"I had put off watching ""Wit"" as I wasn't sure how I could get through a movie devoted entirely to one person suffering through cancer until her ultimate demise. Well, I finally watched it and I must say - it's hard to sit through this emotionally-searing movie, yet it does get many points across.

The multi-talented Emma Thompson [who also co-wrote the screenplay] plays English Literature Professor Vivian who is diagnosed with stage 4 Ovarian cancer and is persuaded by her doctor [Christopher Lloyd] to undertake an experimental therapy with maximum dosage drugs. The viewer is then taken along on Vivian's journey through the world of cancer treatment - when we next see her [after her diagnosis], Vivian is bald and so we understand she has already undergone chemotherapy - she then takes us via flashbacks to her initial treatment, tests and so on before proceeding to the present.

The dialogue, especially when Vivian is talking to us is filled with wit [just as the title implies] as she helps us understand her pain, frustrations and fear - but it is also a searing indictment of the clinical and callous manner in which many members of the medical establishment treat patients - the lab technician who leaves Vivian waiting in an uncomfortable chair as he goes out on his break, the former student turned doctor who leaves Vivian strapped on a gynaecological examination table as he looks around for a female assistant, the indifferent and impersonal doctor etc - these people are so devoid of human warmth and treat their patient as though they were just a specimen and not a person. My own experiences with some members of the medical establishment bears this out, though I have come across some pleasant nurses and the nurse who forms a bond with Vivian here, Susie [Audra McDonald] embodies those that truly do nurse the body and soul of their patients.

""Wit"" is an absolute tearjerker and many parts had me cringing, yet it is compelling, insightful and poignant. There are two memorable scenes in this movie that have stayed with me - one in which Nurse Susie brings Vivian popsicles and sits down to share it with her whilst speaking about an important subject, and the most poignant is when Vivian's former professor comes to visit and climbs into bed [Vivian is on her deathbed] with Vivian and just holds her whilst reading ""The Runaway Bunny"" by Margaret Wise Brown.

But much as I love the passionate and vital poetry of John Donne, I found the endless quoting of his work all through this passionless movie intrusive and didactic. Too many points were too self-consciously made, although the routine inhumanity of hospitals was well evoked and many of the minor actors were terrific. Particularly impressive (along with Eileen Atkins) was the doctor in the opening scene who gives the stiffly academic Dr. Bearing the bad news. This actor was Christopher Lloyd, I think. An actress with the luminosity of Liv Ullman would have been amazing as Dr. Bearing, and so,in fact, would Eileen Atkins at a younger age, but Emma Thompson gives a surprisingly shallow one-note performance. Her body language is excellent (getting on and off stretchers, throwing up) but the more essential aspects of her performance are memorable above all for their lack of emotional intensity.",1230854400,,1110,4.973118279569892

The idea is brilliant, the script, written by Thompson and Mike Nichols is brilliant, the acting and directing are all brilliant.

I can't imagine another actress doing what Thompson does here!! The supporting cast is excellent. Eileen Atkins, as Thompson's teacher, will bring tears to the hardest heart in what has to be one of the most moving scenes in all of film-dom.  I wished the movie had ended there, but it didn't and we had to see the final installment of the dehumanizing treatment by the clueless hospital staff.  Unfortunately this is a reality in our world.

The spareness, the pace - both of which some other reviewers have commented on - seem to reflect, paradoxically, the experience of what is being faced - and as the character, Professor Bearing, comes to say: simplicity. Yet the story and the experience are anything but 'simplicity'. Profound, deeply thought provoking, comforting, rich, eloquent - and yet there are no words, as she also says at one point, even though words have meant so much to her. The comma in John Donne's poem - I think the lines that reflect on that are some of the most - affecting I've ever heard. One of the most moving scenes ever viewed in a film is the one where Professor Bearing's nurse played so wonderfully by Audra MacDonald rubs lotion on Professor Bearing's hands; so moving I wasn't sure I could bear it. This film is just extraordinary in every way and I wish I knew that Ms. Thompson, Mr. Nichols, Ms. McDonald, Ms. Edson, et al. could know how much it meant to my husband and me to watch it.

That said, this movie simply lacked something.  There were poignant moments and rich depth of emotion and acting.  And, yes, Emma Thompson was superb at moments throughout the movie.  But I find myself in the unenviable position of criticizing someone's account of devastating disease.  Yet if I'm going to be honest, criticize I must.

I think what the movie lacked was pace (OK, let's leave any jokes about slow as death behind us right here!).  It was slow - too slow - to the point where I found myself uncertain whether I identified with Thompson's character's pain or simply the movie's painfully slow march toward debilitation and death.  And there you find yourself caught between wishing things would move faster and realizing that faster meant the demise of the character depicted before you.

I know it's difficult to convert a stage play to the big screen (probably why they released this as an HBO flick - to avoid the big screen) and the result often falls into one of three categories - slow, slower, or slowest...  Mike, you didn't break free from this difficulty.

There, I've done it.  Call me a heartless cad.  Tell me my taste wouldn't fill a thimble.  I wanted to like this movie - I really did.  Sorry, Emma, I tried - mostly for you!  But at the end of the day, this just didn't cut it for me.",1221696000,2,1444,4.57421875

1627287,5,B00005MKKV,"all we ever really needed to learn was written in the children's books we read when we were young.

soporific

making you sleepy. as in, this movie is not soporific but rather is stimulating and tearful.

The movie is bracketed chronologically by two events.

The first, is when she decides to love words, to revel in them, to be constantly surprised by them.

As a young girl reading a child's book about rabbits, her father teaches her the word-soporific.

And the touching moment, shortly before her death, where her literature PhD mentor reads another children's book about rabbits. (i was disappointed when she didn't leave the book on the table as she left) The old prof knew the meaning of the words, for she offers to recite Donne but wisely ends up reading about rabbits, running from God, and transmogrification.

The movie has many levels to instruct us. but i'm interested in the one about words, their meanings and how we share those meanings with those around us.

For she learns, well, the lessons of literature. she knows all the right words about the metaphysical poetry of John Donne ( i spent more time online reading Donne, then the length of the movie, having stopped it everytime she quotes him and reading the whole work) but she really doesn't know the meaning until she dies by inches as an experimental research patient for a chemotherapy for metastised ovarian cancer.

She knew the word-soporific from childhood, but it took the humiliating experience in the hospital to teach her what restful, dreamless, needful sleep was.

she knew what it meant to be a difficult and demanding professor, but her course was described as less poetical than biochemistry as the young really bright doctor inserts a cathater. She learns, a teaches us, in part, the difference between knowing the meaning of a word and experiencing the word in your soul.

Ever the teacher and prof to the end, her monologues directed to the watcher, share what she is learning as she is dying. Sharing her humiliation, her powerlessness, her vulnerability, by stages, the move slowly pulls you into her dying and involves you as her life never involved anyone. For she lived and died, really alone, only the one visit from her mentor in more than 8 months. But she recited her poetry, she quotes Donne through the pain and the haze of the medication, and she really learns the meaning of his words about death and dying and commas.

Commas, pause, just a small breath. Just a short life. It starts with a flashback scene with her mentor and her as a young bright (lots of bright alienated people, actually everyone but the nurse is, bright and not very human, not very caring, not sympathetic to the travails around them, many of which they cause) and a discussion of a comma. The point is that words and punctuation matter, but what matters more is the meaning, the significance, how things really fits together after all the mediocre is burned away.  And that is the great strength of this movie, the details (i left all the lights on) that we use to fill our lives to overflowing, to soporific ourselves from others and from our own souls, is stripped away, like her hair, her dignity in a rough pelvic exam, and in death as her breasts are exposed and people fight over the meaning of DNR(not even a word but merely an acronym, a collection of letters, not even dignified with a vowel so that people pronounce it rather than just list the letters).

Emma T. is simply wonderful, she captures the part, and drives the pathos home with just a single tear, or an infectious laugh, or a feeble tug to cover herself. the power and intensity of the movie owes much to her abilities, as much as the movie pulls you into her world and her last days of thought, it also ought to ask questions not only about the matter and indignity of her death, but more about how such a bright, hard working women missed so much of the meaning of Donne.

Mechanism, clockwork instruments, literature as analysis of technic or words as sounds. What is missing is the deeper, more human, more soulish, more spirit level. Her mentor got it, maybe it can just come with age. Which reminds me that we really live our lives backwards. We ought to start out old and infirmed and dependent and get younger and more vigorous with time. Youth is wasted on the young, they don't get it, and when some of them do, it is often too late to do anything about the direction of your life. But like WIT said, he was so young, so immature, it was no wonder that he didn't understand. But those few geniuses, those who tower above our common lot, like Donne, ought to have such a place of honor in our society that young people do hear what they had to say. But as a prof, Emma T's character, despite the intensity and accuracy of her classes, did not challenge the spiritual condition of her students, any more than Donne challenged her own spiritual journey. Like the doctors who ""treated"" her, she was a technican, only with words rather than with drugs or a scapel, but the effect is the same, both on the doer and the one done to--impersonalization, technic raised high above goals, lostness and concentration on the little things, inhumanity and neglect of the spiritual dimension. In this way, she was just like them, just in a different field. she treated her student's pretty much like the doctors treated her, one more step to the next paper, another paycheck, another acronymn after your name. This is the real shame of the movie, a culture of instrumentality, of means, subplants and substitutes it's own goals for human goals of development and beings and understanding. Not just in the hospital, but in the university and by extension everywhere.

I like to think that this is the big picture of the movie, something we all ought to get, and sooner than our last days.

Perhaps reading more John Donne will help, as long as we don't concentrate on the sounds of words, but on the meaning and what he really wanted us to hear and take to heart.

This is film is SO close and SO intimate, that it's images and characters still haunt me to this day.(I tend to be rather hypochondriacal, so if disease and it's ravages are not your bag,then you best beware!)Yes, this play does take one through the painful and excrutiating moment-by-moment struggle with terminal cancer,both from the patients' internal/external mental and physical suffering ,as well as from the lens of the all-too-often coldly clinical and microscopically-observable medical community.

What one DOES glean from this amazing film adaptation of Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize winning play is the irony in which we approach subject matter, whatever it might be, then how we reassess the same material under different circumstances. Emma Thompson's amazing Locke-loving English professor Vivian Bearing does just that-and at what a price!

It was neat to see Audra Mc Donald in a film, as since the time WIT was produced for HBO, she has gone on to garner four TONY AWARDS for her work on stage. IT TRULY DOES NOT GET BETTER THAN THIS!

As a recommendation,try watching the earlier THE DOCTOR with William Hurt and compare the theme to WIT.Both films get you thinking about how we respond to people at any given moment. Usually we can only really empathize/sympathize with someone else's dilemma until we are faced with the same or similar dilemma ourselves.

every aspect of this movie is to be savored.

allow yourself to feel it...Yes it's intense, but also humerous

Ovarian cancer. It was a shock for her, the doctor is talking to her and she can barely react. All through the movie, she looks at the camera from time to time and tell us all what she is thinking and suffering. There is a ""brilliant"" young doctor (yes, one of those, with a big ego, the big shot of the class) who was her student in one of her literature classes. It made me very angry, his attitude, because he was treating her in a very cold and selfish way, only thinking in the results of the research. I want to say that most of the doctors and scientists are not that way. But once in a while you can find one of these.... weird specimen. The nurse was nice and treated her in a better way. This kind of movie makes us think about the fact that we are all just humans, not matter the title or knowledge you can have. And we are here to help each other, no taking advantadge of each other.

1627386,4,B00005MKKV,"Nobody wants to die of cancer and if for some unknown reason there is anybody out there who is not sure about how they feel about such a fate ""Wit"" will take care of that.  This 2001 HBO film begins with Vivian Bearing (Emma Thompson) being informed that she has cancer.  Specifically she has stage 4 ovarian cancer and since there is no stage 5, things are pretty ominous from the start.  Because of the death of Peter Jennings this week more Americans than before are now acutely aware that stage 4 cancer is tantamount to a death sentence.  But it has to be clear going into ""Wit"" that the main character is going to die and that chances are that she is going to die horribly.  Perhaps because she is an academic, specifically a well respected professor of 17th century poetry, Bearing agrees to be a guinea pig for Dr. Kelekian (Christopher Lloyd), a cancer researcher who is clearly more interested in generating data from persuading his patient to undergo chemotherapy treatment in which she gets the whole dosage each and every time than he is in what it will do to prolong her life.  Or maybe she just goes along with him because he is the doctor, the same way she expected her students to follow her lead.

Thompson and director Mike Nichols did the teleplay, adapting Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize winning play and what works and what does not has much to do with the fact that this was originally a stage drama.  That means that Thompson's character get to show her wit by making asides not only before and after but sometimes during the visits from the researchers (it seems wrong to call them doctors) who come by to check the raw data she is providing them.  To be fair, it is a teaching hospital, and Bearing could have gone to a hospice and received more compassionate care, so I do not want to make much of the way the film portrays doctors in general and young intern Jason Posner (Jonathan M. Woodward), who refuses to see his patient as a human being even if he once took a class from her (for the challenge of taking the three toughest classes on campus and not because he has any interest in the subject matter to which she has devoted her academic life).  The idea that doctors are idiots and nurses are compassionate but powerless is a commonplace that has been beaten to death in such films, but close behind is the brilliant and articulate person brought down by disease.

Perhaps there is another reason that the lead character is a professor of literature who has neither friends nor family, but just memories and perhaps a nurse or colleague who might care as she lives out the remainder of her life.  ""Wit"" is all about Bearing's battle with cancer because there is nothing else for it to be about.  She can no longer teach and her comfort comes more from her memories of her father (Harold Pinter) and her mentor (Eileen Atkins) than is does from the drugs or soothing care of her nurse (Audra McDonald).  Besides, the witty observations and lovely recitations of poetry that define the first half of this movie are swept away by the physical deterioration and intense pain that Bearing endures, for lack of a better word, in the second half.  None of the laughs from early in the film take away from the harrowing nature of the rest of the film where the intimacy of the camera allows Thompson to be more affective than any stage performance (and which made me glad that the genetic odds say that I will more likely succumb to a heart attack than have to face cancer).  The point that science will not allow Bearing to go gently into that good night is not lost on us, but we do have to decide for ourselves what final lesson Professor Bearing has taught her former student, Jason.",1123545600,8,3715,4.522388059701493

Also, her wry observation that she expects to be asked the standard hospital question: ""How are you feeling?"" after she's dead is actually quite funny.

That said, this is a hard film to watch, particularly if you've ever had a loved one who went through anything similar. It is heart-breaking, but well worth the tears.",1122940800,9,613,4.675925925925926

Not because of the woman's illness, but just the fact that this is one of those films where the once mighty witful person now is subject to those she shot down with her wit at one time. While the use of her character as the main person, and also the second, or third person was rather good, but not enough to get more than one star. The last time I was this bored watching somthing was back in 5th grade when I had to watch a one man show performance on the life of Abraham Lincoln on Public Television. This was a homework assignment, so there was no way of getting out of this, but unlike the Lincoln show this I choose to get out, and declare it terrible.

1627390,2,B00005MKKV,"I see so many glowing reviews of this movie. It makes me wonder if I watched the same film. Now admittedly, I did go in to watching this movie with very high hopes. My friends had raved about it and I - being a huge cinephile with a preference for dark subject material - was really looking forward to it.

And I will say this: that if you can manage to get through the first 45 minutes, you'll find this to be an endearing little film. But you have to get through that first 45 minutes - a task that I found, well, soporific.

The film is deluged with self-importance. It seems to scream ""Look at me! I'm an important film!"" I felt like the movie was trying to force-feed me its supposed profundity.  ""Look there, it's Emma Thompson and she's quoting John Donne and she's in a hospital gown! Oh look, now she's noting the dry irony of some procedure [you may fill in the blank]! Wow!""

It's sad to say, I only really started liking the movie when the good professor starting ""barfing her brains out"". From that point  on it begins to be watchable, but not before. I think I know why.

We're given a character who isolates herself from everyone. Even the audience. I, as a viewer, couldn't care less about this character. And unfortunately, we aren't given a reason to. So she's smart and clever and has a way with words. And she's also a mean-spirited b*tch. At what point does the compassion come in? I really wish the film had established something in the beginning that demonstrated some kind of vulnerability. Despite a small scene involving her as a graduate student, learning the hard lessons of how to really be an academic, we never really get underneath this character's fingernails. She may be witty, but she is not profound. The shallowness seeps through the screen and seriously injures the film.

But having said that, it does transform into a lovely little film. Especially poignant is the scene at the end, where her old professor recites to her, not John Donne but ""The Runaway Bunny"",  a children's book.

Perhaps, then, the film plays more on the theme of salvation and change than anything. In some way this movie reminded me of Martin Scorcese's masterpiece, ""Raging Bull"", in which an unlikeable and shallow character slowly sees his life unravel, until he is able to see himself clearly. The difference is that Jake La Motta's insecurities and vulnerabilities are bubbling just beneath the surface, whereas Dr. Bearing is just kind of a pretentious snob, and we don't know why.",1114387200,17,2500,4.638009049773756

In ""Wit,"" Emma Thomson is at the absolute height of her art--Playing the scholary, intellectual professor to perfection, she recites Donne like a second language and expects others to also.

When Thomson is diagnosed with ovarian cancer, not even her poetry can save her or her intellect or the hard shell she wears like a sort of armor--

She begins to shed every layer and bare her soul like the child she once was. Instead of desiring Donne, she desires child-hood books--such a""Runaway Bunny.""

But No scene will move one more than when (Vivian's) mean, old professor comes to visit her in the hospital-- She hears Vivian crying and takes off her shoes and crawls into bed with her, holding her.  ""Shall I recite some Donne for you, Vivian?""  Vivian shakes her head and the professor reads to her from a book she had bought for her grand-child ""Runaway Bunny.""

Sometimes the people we least expect can be our brightest angels!

The viewer will feel their souls rise up and meet redemption in mid-air--they will experience the core of the earth tremble beneath their feet-- if they do not--

they do not live.

1627438,5,B00005MKKV,"Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not so,
Doctor Vivian Bearing, a tough, intellectual professor specializing in 17th century literature, takes on the challenge to undergo eight months of experimental chemotherapy and a combination of drugs to battle advanced metastatic ovarian cancer, in which she is in Stage 4, a cancer for which there is no Stage 5.  She will also be studied by medical students, her illness being a significant contribution to knowledge.  To be something studied, as opposed to a human being, yes, there's the rub, to quote the Bard.  But she is a tough woman, never one to shirk a challenge.
For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow,
Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill me.
Most of the story has Bearing's soliloquys, spoken to the viewer from her hospital bed, bald-headed and wearing a hospital gown, describing what she's thinking and feeling, and she does so with wit. One learns of her fascination with words, her past history as a student and academic, how she has preferred research to humanity, and her tough style of teaching, which she got from her mentor, Professor E.M. Rumford. There's a fascinating discussion between Bearing and Rumford, where the original punctuation at the end of Donne's ""Death Be Not Proud"" included a comma in the line, ""death, thou shalt die.""  In other words, a comma separates life from life everlasting.  Yet when Rumford tells her to go hang out with her students instead of going to the library Bearing goes to the library.  Later, when a young doctor, Jason, tells her how he's fascinated by cancer due to its smartness, calling it ""immortality in culture,"" it's ironic that she wishes he would be more interested in humanity rather than research.
From rest and sleepe, which but thy pictures bee,
Much pleasure, then from thee, much more must flow,
As for flashbacks, there are times when we cut to a scene when she's a five year old reading a Beatrix Potter book, that she alternates between her five-year old self and as she is now, bald and in the hospital gown, symbolizing how fragile she seems despite bearing up.
And soonest our best men with thee doe goe,
Rest of their bones, and soules deliverie.
She presents her illness in a paradox in the manner of Donne himself, when she says that with her immune system down, everything is a hazard, especially the health care professionals.  She isn't in the isolation ward because she has a grapefruit-sized tumor, but because her treatment imperils her health.  But she revels in the paradox, seeing it as an intellectual game.  But when the cancer spreads elsewhere, she begins to get frightened, realizing her intellectual abilities isn't going to help her, but that she seeks simplicity and kindness, and that makes her regret she had been sympathetic to some of her own students.  Fortunately, she finds that in Susie, the nurse, with whom she has a rapport with.
Thou art slave to Fate, Chance, kings, and desperate men,
And dost with poyson, warre, and sicknesse dwell,
Juxtaposing this movie with my mother's recent battle with cancer did ring some emotional chords due to similarities.  My mother wasn't as open as Dr. Bearing in her feelings when undergoing CT Scans, ultrasounds, colonoscopies, or the IPT chemotherapy.  But she too looked for kindness and simplicity, and when a certain hospital worker wheeled her chair to a spot of sunshine on a cold day after a CT scan, my mother realized that maybe she was wrong in being too tough, and that she had hurt some people in her past.
And poppie, or charmes can make us sleepe as well,
And better then thy stroake; why swell'st thou then;
This is by far Emma Thompson's best role ever, but Audra McDonald as Susie lends strong support as the very human and compassionate nurse, who sees Bearing as a human being, not a subject for study.  Those who have just lost a dear one to cancer may find this painful going, others will find this a study of reflection one experiences when near the portals of mortality.

Suddenly, her dreary, drab life is turned on it's end when she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She handles it well, using the apt title of the film to handle her hardships. As you watch her wither, losing hair, weight but never her humor, she takes you along her life through flashbacks, even disturbing the viewer by putting her weak, cancer-ridden body in the place of her youth between scenes.
The film is shot like a documentary, with many scenes of oddly humorous dialogue, and Thompson talking to the camera as well. She is portrayed as an intelligent woman, well versed in literature and liable to quote random bits of poetry throughout her speeches.

1627478,5,B00005MKKV,"I found out that this movie was on DVD when I saw it in the cheap bin at Wal-Mart, but I would have paid significant amounts of money to own this movie. This movie only comes out when I particularly want to cry a lot.  If you are already familiar with the movie, and want to read my opions of the DVD as a whole, you can skip to the end of the review, otherwise, read on.
To start, you should definitely see the stage production, which is profoundly powerful.  However, Emma Thompson gives us a better performance than probably anyone we could hope to see as Vivian.  I went through a brief period several years ago wherein I looked for all of the major-name sad movies, because I wanted some really good catharsis (this resulted in a purchase of Beaches [which I don't enjoy] Steel Magnolias [which I do enjoy, but still no tears] and sundry other movies).  Most of the time, the heartwrenching effects of a movie wear off after the first viewing, but even after multiple viewings, I end up bawling like nobody's business.
Edson's play is definitely something to read, and this is a fantastically faithful screenplay.  The makers of this film knew what they were doing.  In addition to Emma, Audra McDonald turns in a fantastic performance.  She doesn't need to sing to keep you watching.  However, despite a top notch supporting cast, Ms. Thompson truly is what helps this film soar.
Take note that this movie has a solid 5 stars.  This movie embodies the disturbing scene toward the end when the resident, Jason Posner, discusses cancer as an ""awesome"" force.  If you don't want to admit it, this movie proves that cancer truly is awesome, even if its only in a technical sense, and not at all in a colloquial sense.  The journey of this independent woman from hard-willed educator to a woman who is dependent  on everyone is awful to watch.  Its captivating at the same time.  No scene is as painful and beautiful to watch as when Vivian's elderly Professor (E.M. Ashford) cradles next to her to read The Runaway Bunny.  In fact, I am completely overcome just thinking about the scene.
I can't avoid it, anytime I talk about a DVD, I have to talk about the DVD itself.  I have grown so accustomed to extra features, that I look at every DVD with regards to features.  This one has none whatsoever, except for really good Actor bios.  In fact, this DVD has some of the best actor bios that I have seen on a DVD.  But that's all it has, there are no special features.  Of course, it doesn't require special features.  This movie stands alone and is worth any price you can pay for it, special features or not.",1065398400,5,2611,4.501061571125265

1627480,5,B00005MKKV,"I'll not go on and on about the obvious merits of this film, the performances, the script, the realism, the reality, and the horrors every woman fears at the very words 'ovarian cancer'. Emma Thompson gives us a flawless performance, so many of us had a teacher or professor just like her, and never loses her dignity (perhaps that's the tragedy, right there) while she suffers the endless indignities of her experimental cancer treatment. The Professor is witty, gratifyingly so, and bereft, embarrassingly so, of any personal life to prop her up during the last scenes of her life.
Enter Eileen Atkins' character. The Professor's former mentor, a woman so terrifyingly brilliant and yet so completely rooted to the ground, who feels the need earlier in their years together to advise the young Professor to go out and have some fun. We suspect that the Professor does not heed this very good advice.
For me, Eileen Atkins performance stole the entire show. Emma Thompson was flawless, but shackled by her character's sang-froid, where Eileen Atkins was gifted with the best of both worlds--the academic and the family.
Beware, this is a very difficult film to digest. I came away knowing for sure that if I ever was diagnosed with terminal cancer that it would be best to bail as soon as possible and with as much pain-killing medication that heaven allows.",1055894400,3,1359,4.887445887445887

Emma plays a university professor, who is suddenly striken with a destructive type of cancer.
What follows is an amazing experience.  We see a woman torn down. We see a woman ripped from her world and placed into a life of pain, and likely death.  We see that she can be self assured, competent, and sometimes rude.
We also see that she can cry.  This is a perfect adaptation of the human experience.  We see that life is filled with pleasures and pains, and that we need to cherish every moment.
This film leaves the viewer with a sense of emptiness, a sense of pain and sadness.  But we also walk away with a little more understanding.  We walk away with a new perspective.  That, I think, should be the goal of all film.",1054339200,3,861,4.3375

I was especially touched by Audra McDonald who is well known for singing beautifully on the Broadway stage. I was pleasantly surprised to watch her reach deep within as Nurse Susie to bring some truly poignant moments to life.  Despite the fact that this film was,literally, stunning at times as well as sad, I can honestly say that I will watch it again.

As a consummate professional Vivienne is harsh and abrasive, demanding perfect understanding in her classes. No leeway.  The story unfolds as Vivienne is diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer and follows the merciless downward spiral to her death. When considering the subject matter, it is surprising that Emma Thompson's running narrative through the film is humorous and eloquent. Yet at times heart wrenching. I challenge you to remain composed in the final scenes as vivienne regresses back to childhood.  I would not dream of ruining the actual content of the film for you, only to say that you will not watch a more poignant, painstakingly simple, brutal film this year. Or any year for that fact.

1627516,5,B00005MKKV,"I just tried to write a review of this just re-watched film, from the Pulitzer Prize winning play,  and I got all tangled up. So, I'm not going to go into ""the story."" Just watch this brilliant, moving film about the regimented, respected but feared English professor, whose world is taken from her, when she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Narrated throughout by her character, the brilliant Emma Thompson takes us through her progressive deterioration and loss of control amidst the sometimes indifference of the medical profession. Audra McDonald is wonderful also as the nurse, Susie, who, though a total professional, is not only the voice of compassion, but the keeper of Thompsons ""Professor Barrie's"" dignity, when she can no longer defend it for herself. She is a perfect contrast to the often all to real portrayal of the fresh-faced new doctor, played by Jonathan Woodward, who effectively conveys the preoccupation with stats, data, etc...in his eagerness to ""analyze"", forgetting there's a human being in that bed to which the stat chart is attached. The scene near the end, where Thompson/Barrie is visited by her grand-motherly former professor, who proceeds to cradle her in her hospital bed and tenderly read a childrens story to her, and bids her good bye, is one of the most moving scenes I've ever experienced. It is not an easy film to watch. Having just lost my life-long friend, who died at 47, in hospice, it was especially poignant. But, if you watch one film, watch ""Wit."" It is beyond being labeled as mere entertainment, and, though the subject matter is in itself depressing, the film is not. It is one of those increasingly very, very rare films that will greatly move you. And, though you pretty much know from the first words spoken in the film where it is headed, it is ultimatley life affirming, and very touching in its conveyance of the dignity of the human spirit.

1627517,5,B00005MKKV,"Before this movie, I never ""got"" poetry.  I like simple, face-value things.  I like movies like Rush Hour 2, The Terminator and Rambo but also enjoy Sense and Sensibility too.  However, I was furious for the first 5 mins of this movie.  I thought I was watching a preachy movie about the degrading trials and humiliations a person trying to treat ovarian cancer has to go through.  But I could not have been more wrong.

That was just the first layer and like an onion, this movie has many layers.  It is as deep and as shallow as the viewer wants it to be.  Vivian's (Emma Thompson) voice-over gave me goose bumps.  One of my favorite lines is ""It has always been my custom to treat words with respect"".  And she accomplishes that in this movie.  No wonder this play won a Pulitzer prize.

Even when Vivian's old professor reads THE RUNAWAY BUNNY to Vivian, there was something to learn there.  She calls the book, ""A little allegory of the soul.""  My God, what a way she has with words.  And this movie is full of those profound little sayings all through out.

But Emma's full recital of one of John Donne's Holy Sonnets at the end really got to me.  I had to rewind towards the beginning of the movie to when Vivian first met her Professor who explained ""the Sonnet begins with the valient struggle with death.  Calling on all the forces of intellect and drama to vanquish the enemy.  But it is ultimately about overcoming the seemingly insuperable barrier separating life, death and eternal life.""  I could say the same about the meaning of this movie.

Another layer to this movie is about the lesson taught to an unfeeling but the-best-in-her-field professor who showed no mercy to her students and then finds herself at the mercy of the hospital staff who only sees her as another nameless patient to be prodded and poked and to be asked as an afterthought by the cold but highly intellectual Doctor how the patient is feeling when the patient is sitting there vomiting.  It starts dawning on Vivian that just being a scholar does not a good Doctor (or a good Professor) make.

When she finally admits that being extremely smart was not enough and that now she saw the value of kindness, I saw (me, the one who doesn't ""get"" deep stuff) how it all tied in with the sonnet because not even intellect can keep the person out of deaths grasp.  Is that deep or what.

To me, this movie was like those ""for Dummies"" books.  Poetry appreciation for Dummies 101.  But it also reminds us all that a little kindness goes a long way and being intellectually vain is vanity all the same.  Isn't Vanity one of the 7 DEADly sins?",1036800000,5,2624,4.490486257928119
1627518,5,B00005MKKV,"This film is simple yet amazing. With a minimal cast and plot--Emma Thompson, the darling of the Merchant & Ivory circle, plays a compassionless English professor (at Penn, I believe) dying of cancer in a hospital--it manages to accomplish so much in terms of raising questions not only about death but of life itself. I don't want to write too much about the movie's details, but I'll just say that the acting is superb and the characters reveal so much with so little--not surprising since the screenplay is based on a stage drama. There are very few films out there like ""Wit,"" and I highly recommend this hidden treasure to any viewer (except the extremely sensitive, I suppose). It is certainly a must-see for academics.",1032480000,,725,4.808

1627520,5,B00005MKKV,"John Donne's poem, ""No Man is an Island"" ends with the words, ""Ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.""  The words seemed romantic when I was a teenager. After all, Hemingway derived the title of one of his books about WWI from them and Hollywood made a glam film about his book.
These days I am approaching the twilight years at breakneck speed and death doesn't seem romantic. So why on earth would I want to be reminded of my own mortality or the mortality of those I love by a film about a woman dying of cancer? The answers for me are these: 1) Emma Thompson. I've seen every film she's made, even the mediocre ones, and I refuse to miss a single one of her films (CARRINGTON sure wasn't very cheerful);  2) Thompson plays a professor of English who's specialty is the metaphysical poetry of John Donne. I had to see how one could develop a film about this topic;  3) I wanted to see the film version of WIT because I could not get to New York City to see Judith Light play Vivian Bearing in the Pulitzer prize winning play;  4) The stellar supporting cast assembled for the film including the fabulous Eileen Atkins and Audra McDonald; 5) Ms. Thompson's co-writing the screen play (she won the Oscar for her screen play of the book ""Sense and Sensibility"").
WIT is a profound film. I am still trying to make all the connections, however, the overwhelming sadness of Donne's poem strikes home -- ""Ask not for whom the bell tolls...""",1028332800,2,1449,4.415730337078652
1627521,5,B00005MKKV,"First of all, be advised, this is a tough film to watch; but also know that if you choose to do so, you will be rewarded with an experience that is invaluable and unforgettable, and in ways that transcend mere cinematic satisfaction.  There is no mystery here, no secrets nor allegories.  Indeed, the subject matter is made succinctly evident in the first words you hear, spoken by Dr. Kelekian (Christopher Lloyd) to Vivian Bearing (Emma Thompson):  ""You have cancer.""  And so begins ""Wit,"" directed by Mike Nichols, a film that will claim you emotionally and take you to a place of eternal night-- a region, in fact, wherein even the most intrepid of body and spirit fear to tread.  It puts you in a dark room with that thing in the closet and keeps you there; and there is no way out.  And once inside, it forces you to face your worst fears, albeit vicariously, in a way that invites some serious reflection upon mortality and the profundity of life.
Vivian Bearing is a professor of English Literature, specializing in the work of Seventeenth Century poet John Donne.  Hers is a scholarly life, and she is secure with her place in it; not yet fifty, she has achieved a level of comfort with herself, as well as her work, especially in the class she teaches on Donne.  With her students she is a demanding taskmaster and does not suffer fools, nor students who opt for more immediate pleasures over Donne, refusing to accept youthful zeal as an excuse for academic impropriety.  In her classroom, she insists that those in attendance rise to her level; she does not stoop to conquer.
Then, with the words of Dr. Kelekian, her world abruptly changes.  At first, wrapped in intellectual armor, she finds at least some comfort and respite in her beloved Donne, but she soon finds that the pursuits of the mind, even leavened with a healthy ego, attain a diminished capacity within the environs of a ravaging disease.  The eternity of the hospital affords her much time for reflection, and as her illness progresses she undergoes a change in perspectives; taking stock, she considers such things as the aloof manner she affected that served no purpose other than to distance her from her students.  And she thinks about it now, not with regret, but differently; her intellectual acumen no longer separates her from her students, nor affords her a lofty perch from which she may sit in judgment.  She understands, at last, that she is not so different from them after all.  For as she discovers to her considerable dismay-- pain is the great equalizer.
Written by Nichols and Thompson, the screenplay is based on the play by Margaret Edson.  The story unfolds like a living diary, as Vivian addresses the viewer directly, with a descriptive narrative that leaves little to the imagination.  Graphically real and unrelenting, it is a riveting chronicle that will hold you in thrall from beginning to end and beyond-- because this experience does not end when the screen goes dark; it's something that is going to be with you for a long time afterwards, so be prepared.  And the reason this will linger in your memory is that it's a contemplation of a reality that is horrendous beyond imagination.  This is that thing that always happens to someone else, but never to ""me,"" and to be put in the room with someone to whom the unthinkable has happened-- to be up close and personal with it-- is emotionally devastating.  This is a true horror story beyond anything Stephen King could write, because this is ""real.""  What happens to Vivian Bearing is something that happens to people all the time, and there has never been a film before or since that will put you more in touch with what it feels like, from the incredulity born at the moment of diagnosis to the acceptance of the reality of it.  And it has nothing to do with courage; it is not about that at all.  It's about knowing that you are going to have to do this thing that you least in the whole world want to do-- and that you have no choice in the matter.
This film is a veritable showcase for the incredible talent of Emma Thompson, who gives a performance that is so remarkable there are not enough superlatives to do it justice.  Ineligible for Oscar consideration as this film was made for television (HBO), her performance nevertheless is as Oscar worthy as they come (even more impressive than her Oscar winning performance as Margaret in ""Howard's End,"" which was nothing less than a study in perfection).  As Vivian Bearing, Thompson is absolutely mesmerizing-- you simply cannot take your eyes off of her for even a moment.  There are times when you want to look away, to avert your eyes because it's just too painful to watch, but you can't.  Once you begin this journey you are bound to her for better or worse.  You suffer with her through the physical pain, as well as through the base indignities to which she is subjected as a matter of course by the doctors and care givers who simply do not respond to the humanity of the person in their care; a sad commentary, to be sure, but so true.
What really marks Thompson's performance as so extraordinary, however, is the fact that as you watch the drama unfold, you forget this is an actor playing a role; rather, this is a very real person you are watching-- a person named Vivian Bearing who is dying of cancer.
The supporting cast includes Eileen Atkins (E.M. Ashford), Audra McDonald (Susie), Jonathan M. Woodward (Jason) and Harold Pinter (Vivian's Father).  An emotionally absorbing drama that redefines empathy and compassion, ""Wit"" will make you feel alive like never before, and thankful for each and every day that you wake up healthy.

One minute you will be laughing, the next sobbing. This is a powerful, poignant film about the ravages of cancer and the nature of life and death. Mike Nichols received well deserved Emmy and Golden Globes for his direction.
Emma Thompson gives what may be the performance of her career as Dr. Vivian Bearing, a strict and brilliant professor of John Donne's metaphysical poetry who is dying from ovarian cancer. She flawlessly and wrenchingly depicts the slow decline of a briliant woman. Vivian is receiving experimental treatment, and is often treated as nothing more than a speciman by her doctors. As she is hospitalized, she observes and analyzes her condition and the effect it is having on her life. Vivian's remarks are often funny, but as the cancer spreads through her body, she realizes that she has to reasses her life. In a heartrending scene, Vivian breaks down and says, ""I used to feel safe."" She was always a woman in control, and now that control is being savagely ripped from her by an invisible enemy. Eventually Vivian decides that when her heart stops, she does not wish to be revived: ""Why make things more complicated?""
As the illness reaches its last stages, we see Vivian moaning and shaking with excrutiating pain. It is nearly unbearable to watch, but we must. The final scene, where Vivian is held like a child and read a children's story by her elderly teacher, is the most heartbreaking image ever put on film. ""I feel so bad,"" Vivian manages to say, and that is all she can say.
""Wit"" is a intensely moving and painful film to watch. It shows death by cancer in minute detail, never letting the viewer off easy. And that is how it should be. ""Wit"" is an educational experience as well as a cinematoc one, and you will leave the film understanding better the hell that cancer patients go through. It will leave you sad and haunted, but also comforted.

1627556,5,B00005MKKV,"Wit offers a sharply observed portrait of a professor of 17th Century poetry who is diagnosed with 4th stage ovarian cancer. There is no 5th stage, as she wryly observes. Dr. Vivian Bearing (brilliantly played by Emma Thompson) has spent her life studying the poetry of John Donne, to great scholarly acclaim. Yet in the final chapter of her life, she finds that she has never really engaged the poetry that has been her life's work. Until now, that is.
One would think that such a subject matter would be utterly depressing. Yet, it is oddly full of hope. And that is the genius of the film.
Donne's poetry is overtly referred to throughout the film. Yet in the scenes in which Bearing recalls her lectures on the subject, one learns little about the poetry. Donne's attempt to grapple with death is discussed in a superficial way by the characters. But the film's deeper meaning comes directly from Donne's writing.
Dr. Bearing has lived her life as woman who uses her intellectual prowess to avoid meaningful connections with people. As a result, she undergoes her long and painful illness with no companionship. Donne's famous line that ""no man is an island"" comes immediately to mind. When one turns to the meditation which is its source, one finds the following:
""When one Man dies, one Chapter is not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language; and every Chapter must be so translated; God employs several translators; some pieces are translated by age, some by sickness, some by war, some by justice, but God's hand is in every translation; and his hand shall bind up all our scattered leaves again, for that Library where every book shall lie open to one another.""
Wit is about Bearing's ""translation."" She has worn the mask of intellectual self-sufficiency for her whole life. In her illness, every shred of her self-dignity is stripped away. She loses her hair; she is treated as an object by the medical system; she suffers pain; and finally she confronts her death. The beauty of the film is that by the end, she has lost everything that she thought mattered to her - only to find that it doesn't matter at all. In losing her self-dignity, she has found the genuine dignity that belongs to us all by virtue of our humanity. Her death is not empty suffering, but rather a fitting conclusion to her life - as she finally absorbs the meaning of the poetry that has been her life's work.
We come to care deeply for a woman who is not very likeable. In doing so, we come to see the connection that we all share as human beings.

Her wit and dry humor is tempered with the brutal portrayals of a cancer patient's reality.  I cried throughout the latter half of this film because I lost my own mother to cancer just 5 months ago.

1627561,5,B00005MKKV,"This brilliant adaptation of Margaret Edison's Pulitzer Prize winning play is simply superb. Beautifully directed by Mike Nichols, it is peppered with superlative performances by its cast. It is almost hard to believe that this profoundly moving and poignant film was released for HBO, rather than as a major box office, big screen release.

Tautly written, this remarkable film focuses on an intense and brilliant professor of English, forty-eight year old Vivian Bearing (Emma Thompson), whose academic focus has been metaphysical poetry. She has just been diagnosed by a noted oncologist, Dr. Kelikian (Christopher Lloyd), as having stage four ovarian cancer. She agrees to undergo an eight month long clinical trial to fight this illness, which at the juncture of its discovery is, invariably, terminal. This course of experimental treatment is Professor Bearing's only hope, as she realizes that there is no stage five.

As she undergoes agonizing medical procedures which, it is hoped, may save her life, Professor Bearing muses on a number of life issues in the form of droll monologues. It is these reflections on her life and her illness that drive home to the viewer her humanity, as she struggles to reconcile the abstract with reality. An aloof, spare woman, with a penchant for being a demanding and exacting teacher, Professor Bearing is now  trying to hang on to her humanity and dignity, as she is reduced to being a mere lump of flesh.

Made to suffer the indignities imposed by an experimental medical treatment that is brutally aggressive and by the ravages of an illness that is relentless, Professor Bearing keeps a stiff upper lip throughout, never letting down her guard, until the end draws near. During her medical odyssey, she is buoyed by the ministrations of her compassionate, primary care nurse, Susie (Audra McDonald), who seems to be the only member of the medical staff interested in her as a person, rather than as just another cog in the world of medical research. Susie is a perfect foil to the ambitious medical treatment fostered by a callow, though brilliant, young doctor, Jason Posner (Jonathan M. Woodward).

The most singular scene in this film, however, occurs near its end. It is the scene in which Professor Bearing's mentor, Professor E.M. Ashford (Eileen Atkins), visits her one time protege at the hospital. Heartrending, poignant, and infinitely beautiful, it is a scene so richly drawn that it that will haunt the viewer long after the film is over.

Ms. Thompson gives a consummate, beautifully nuanced performance, as does Eileen Atkins. Audra McDonald gives a tender performance, and Christopher Lloyd and Jonathan M. Woodward are, likewise, excellent in their respective roles. Harold Pinter does a wonderful, though brief, turn as Professor Bearing's father. All in all, this is a deftly directed, outstanding film with award caliber performances by the entire cast. Bravo!",1018742400,192,2929,5.168776371308017
1627562,5,B00005MKKV,"WIT is an uncompromising look at death by cancer - and the therapy designed to cure it.
Emma Thompson is Vivian Bearing, a Doctor of Philosophy and an aloof professor of 17th century English poetry. Her special interest is the metaphysical verse of John Donne, to which she's dedicated her scholastic life at the expense of human relationships. Now, at 48, she's diagnosed with stage-four metastatic ovarian carcinoma. There is no stage five. Her oncologist, Dr. Kelekian (Christopher Lloyd), recommends an aggressive, 8-month regimen of treatment with an experimental drug - at full dose. Because of the expected onerous side effects, he challenges Vivian to show fortitude and perseverance, and, never a slacker, she promises a stiff upper lip.
Much of the film is comprised of a series of monologs by Bearing as she addresses the camera, and the audience, with reflections generated by her dry WIT about the chemotherapy's appalling toll on her person and the process by which it is being exacted. At one point, after Kelekian and a train of acolytes visit Vivian in her hospital room, a medical teaching ritual known as Grand Rounds, she wryly observes that the exercise was:
""... full of subservience, hierarchies, gratuitous displays, sublimated rivalries. I feel completely at home. It is just like a graduate seminar.""
WIT is a pointed indictment of the generalized insensitivity of medical caregivers to the terminally-ill patient, who comes to represent little more than a specimen cup, a form covered with scribbled observations, or, at best, a career-enhancing article in a medical journal. Jason (Jonathan Woodward) plays the shallow, research-minded physician completing a clinical fellowship under Kelekian's direction. Bearing asks what his reaction is to patients who express apprehension or fright. His clueless response: ""Of whom?""
As the course of Vivian's treatment - or is it torture? - draws to its conclusion, her only source of human warmth and sympathy becomes her primary care nurse, Susie (Audra McDonald), and her only pleasure the eating of a popsicle, the lone ""food"" tolerated by a GI tract ravaged by the anti-cancer drug.
One of the most heart-wrenchingly poignant scenes ever put on celluloid has to be one near the conclusion when Vivian is visited by her aged mentor E.M. Ashford (Eileen Atkins). I'm not ashamed to say that my eyes teared.
WIT isn't an easy film to watch. I suspect any person undergoing cancer therapy can relate to it, and should therefore be seen by anyone providing oncology care. Viewing WIT should be absolutely mandatory in every medical and nursing school in the country.
This performance by Emma Thompson is an Oscar-caliber tour de force. It's a sad commentary on the film industry and the audiences it feeds that WIT's producers had to release it as an HBO movie rather than one for the Big Screen because it would have otherwise been steamrollered at the box office by the mindless thrillers that appeal to the masses.",1018137600,11,2985,5.106339468302658
1627563,5,B00005MKKV,"Had Emma Thompson been eligable for an Academy Award this year for Wit, the category for best actress would have been no contest.

I wanted something warm and comforting.  The latter came ""between the lines"" as it were.  The theological underpinnings, intertwined with the hard, uncompromising, left brained approach to the human spirit from both the doctors and the poetry professor were brilliantly, and elegantly acted and directed.  If you're up for a gruelling but thoroughly engrossing film this is it.",1016841600,2,554,5.122222222222222

1627597,5,B00005MKKV,"The story of a cancer patient has been adequately explained in other reviews. Suffice it to say that most reviewers have described the film's depiction of the agonies of those who become ""instruments"" of medical personnel but also not to be dismissed is the tenderness shown of those like the nurse who cared for Vivian.
Out of all the reviews I read, I was very surprised that no one
noticed the film's ""frame"": the John Donne poem, ""Death be not
proud""  The clear reference by Vivian's professor to the poem's
reference to life, death and eternal life.  And the way the
actress spoke in this scene was unforgettable: ""This is how it
reads: 'And death shall be no more. Comma. Death, thou shalt
die.' Nothing but a breath--a comma--separates life from life
everlasting.  Death is not something to act out on a stage with
exclamation marks.  It is a comma, a pause.""
Also, a technique employed by the director (perhaps to make a point?)was the presence (in the same scene) of the ""crucifix"" painting on the wall behind the actress and again at the end of the film, the same painting on a postcard.  I think the connection was obvious, even if not intended.
Intended or not, the film was a beautiful work of art in itself.  Congratulations to Nichols and Thompson and all who worked on this masterpiece!  It will be enjoyed for many years to come!",1012521600,7,1346,4.630252100840337
1627598,4,B00005MKKV,"Having just wiped the last tears from my eyes, i thought it necessary to recommend highly a film that has left me too thoughtful to continue with daily life for at least the next fifteen minutes.  ""Wit"" is a film that combines character development with strong narrative that plunges its audience into their own souls (while providing a wonderful approach to philosophical paradox).
Emma Thompson is phenomenal (true to most of her performances, and indeed proves again her written talent as well as acting talent), and Christopher Lloyd works, though he plays a small but crucial role.
The film does continue past points where i would have liked it to end, but the scenes were good all the same.
Not advised for a night that demands a light comedy, but for satisfying the need for a quality film with superb acting, including a dose of humanity with intelligence, i wholeheartedly recommend ""Wit"".",1011916800,2,898,4.907894736842105

1627600,4,B00005MKKV,"This is not easy viewing. This is not a light subject matter either. This film hits so hard and will be remembered long after it's over for one simple reason. It's so real. This is real life. If the subject matter is tough for you to get into, then check it out just for Emma Thompson's performance. Amazing. Emma stars as Vivian Bearing, an English teacher who is diagnosed with cancer. The film then follows her through her life and her ordeal with the deadly disease. It's all her. The whole film focuses on her and her point of view, and doesn't go for the medical view of it. It's about human compassion. It's about facing one's mortality. The movie is so shockingly real, with no cotton candy covering at all. Emma Thompson's performance is nothing short of astonishing. You feel for her. You pray for her. You feel as if you know her. I certainly did. This film brought back some very personal memories of my own. My aunt died from cancer a number of years ago. She moved in with us and we took care of her. I watched as she faded away. Rather quickly at that as well. The images and different stages of it that I saw were really tough on an 11 year old. Images I will never forget as long as I live. She was misdiagnosed at the beginning, and when it was corrected, it was too late. She would still be here with us today if it had been diagnosed correctly. This film was a definite hearttugger for me. Have some hankies handy. Director Mike Nichols is a genius. Both him and Emma deserve Emmy's. Wit is a groundbreaking film.

  The direction is superb as well.
  What is deficient is the lack of special features on the DVD. This is inexcusable, especially the lack of any commentary from Ms. Thompson who co-wrote the screenplay along with Mike Nichols.  Surely, interviews with one or both would not be prohibitively expensive.  Shame on HBO.

I've been a RN for 32 years and I've never seen medical personnel behave like this (not in the US anyway....England is a different story, but I digress.).  I have the tendency to pick apart medical films so here are my major complaints:  Susie (the nurse) seemed to work 24 hours a day and in every unit in the hospital.  When a patient is DNR and the primary nurse is standing there screaming that she's No Code, nobody ignores that.  Susie put in a urinary catheter then lotioned the patient's hands and left the room without washing her own hands (gross!).  Other than these and a few other minor points, the film (and particularly Emma Thompson) is brilliant.  I just wish they would dial down the literary license with depictions of medical situations.",1499040000,,833,4.664383561643835
