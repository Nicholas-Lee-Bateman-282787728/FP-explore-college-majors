5186724,5,B008WAM2SI,"The Audio and video is great on this DVD set, comes with mini movies and press conferences after the game. You get to chose from local broadcast or the ABC broadcast. Had alot more of the championship celebration them I thought it would, with the trophy presentation and all that. This Finals Series proves who really is the best player in the NBA and it will be interesting.to see if the team with the most pressure to ever win the Finals can do it again, with just as much pressure to repeat. Great teams 3peat, so will see what the future holds. I recommend this to all basketball fans that love the game.",1351987200,2,608,4.389380530973451

8531429,5,B008WAM2SI,"last year's Chip was  great and so much emotion.  finishing up the boston celtics was magical and then  on to beating  Oklahoma.  the Big  three were  Huge  Lebron James  had a triple double,  DWYANE  Wade  had a  great game as did  Chris Bosj. Mike Miller  was  shooting 3's like  nobody's business in the finale, sound familiar??

that one was funny, however the next dvd takes it up a whole new direction.",1371945600,,408,4.507042253521127
8531430,2,B008WAM2SI,"The first time I bought this item, I returned it due to scratches on the DVD. This DVD is of very poor quality - doesn't even come close to the set that was done for the 2006 NBA Championship that the Miami Heat won. No inserts, nothing that adds to the experience of re-living the championship. I wish the NBA would have been the one making this set and not Bombo Entertaintment - or that it would be in Blue Ray... Some camera shots are very hard on the eyes from the distortions. Poor quality. I personally recommend the other DVD of the Championship and not this Final set.",1357689600,6,577,4.302752293577981
