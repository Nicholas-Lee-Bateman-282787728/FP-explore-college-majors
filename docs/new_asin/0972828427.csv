I'm an intermediate dancer (dancing for 2.5 years) and I was looking for more choreographies to put in my repetoire. These combos are upbeat and unique and full of sass. Jillina goes through the combinations and link them together, running through what we know so far, and then moving on. It's a wonderful way to make sure you're getting it and get it all in your memory. Recommended!",1361577600,,453,4.675
7794523,4,0972828427,I really like this DVD.  Jullina is very good at breaking it down and drilling the routines and combos.  This is a fun choreographed DVD the only thing is that you need a large space to do some of the routines (for spins and traveling moves).  But worth buying to get great ideas for building your own routines and learning new moves.  Highly recommend.,1204070400,,353,4.46875

I would say this is for intermediate to advance dancers.  Very good DVD, worth your money and time!!!",1188259200,2,264,4.4375
