8013217,3,B0001JUGKE,This is what you would guess WWII propaganda/training films would be like. It is interesting to relive those days. Things have changed and I did enjoy watching this movie.,1476316800,,171,4.931034482758621
8013218,5,B0001JUGKE,"This rare tape contains two World War II U.S. Army training films. Unfortunately they are not available on DVD.

The first, ""For God & Country,"" at 43 minutes, stars Ronald Reagan (The Hasty Heart), Hugh Marlowe (The Day The Earth Stood Still), and Richard Carlson (It Came From Outer Space) as Chaplains, and follows their service from training through combat in New Guinea. It's narrated by Walter Huston (Of Human Hearts).

The second film, ""Jap Zero,"" 19 minutes, gives a detailed lesson on identifying a Zero, with many pictures, silhouettes, animations, etc., and compares it to a P40.  This is followed by a dramatic reenactment starring Ronald Reagan (Kings Row) as a pilot who seems to have made a near-fatal error.  Only films from his plane with tell what really happened.

These are highy interesting to WWII history buffs, film buffs, or Reagan fans.",1183507200,2,863,4.965277777777778
