8347605,5,B001X9Q8NA,I want to write a review of this fantastic film. I was able to find the reconstruction project version by Franco Cleef through the internet. This is a fantastic film. It has all the classic Spaghetti Western elements here. It's too bad it's not available to purchase at retailers. This version is not copletely dubbed. A lot of it is still in the original Italian language but it's dubbed. The quality id superb. This film was produced by Alberto Grimaldi and the music is by non other than Ennio Morricone. I just have to wonder why it's not out there easier to get.,1255478400,4,567,4.514563106796117
