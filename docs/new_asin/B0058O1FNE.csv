8461978,3,B0058O1FNE,"Technically this DVD looks good (the print of ""Love Me Deadly"" is better that ""Campus Corpse"" but both looked good on my big screen with my upconverting blu ray player.) You get an intro from Maria (not really funny and it won't make you forget Elvira any time soon.) and trailers. Maria's music video is kind of painful to sit through.

I'll start with the 2nd movie. ""The Hazing"" (titled Campus Corpse on the packaging) is about a hazing gone wrong and the frat trying to cover up the death. I remember seeing this on TV decades ago. You'll keep the fast forward button warm and the ending isn't much of a surprise. Comes across more like a made for TV movie. 2 stars at best.

The main feature is, ""Love Me Deadly."" Lindsay (Mary Wilcox) scans the obituary page for younger male deaths, goes to funerals and when the crowd leaves, she sneaks up to the coffin for a little make out session with the deceased. A mortician begins to notice her and wants her to join his freaky group (looking like satanists) of dead loving enthusiasts. Through the movie men try to get close to her (those who don't succeed have to feel good about losing out to dead guys) and fail and we find out why Lindsay loves the dead.

Along the way there's blood, violence, nudity, cool 70s scenes of southern California and a sick sense of dread every time the star goes looking for love in funeral homes. Fans that need to have constant violence probably won't like this but give it a chance and you might be surprised.",1479427200,,1496,4.452554744525547
