8198896,5,B000R54U3G,"After saving the world from Nagi's insane destruction plot, the Windbloom kingdom and Garderobe Academy are back to normal. A disaster strikes, and Mai & Mashiro are transported to an island with no way off. The rest of the Otome are trying to find them. Arika cannot use her powers since Mashiro is gone. There is also a terrorist group that is trying to free Nagi and resurrect an ancient Otome. There is plenty of action and drama to see in this OVA. The good thing about this is that since it's a short OVA, the production quality is much higher than the series. But My Otome is still not as good as My Hime.",1356393600,,612,4.3304347826086955
