I had only heard of Michael Card before but this is the first time I have listened to his teachings. He is EXCELLENT & very worthy of your attention. Just reading the bible has never been enough for me. I have deep desire to taste & live it. Michael Card helps me get to this higher level to understand  the how? the why? the when? & other questions the WORD makes me think about. This DVD is WORTHY of seeing & hearing.",1392681600,,577,3.889830508474576
