7925169,5,B00004WG2Z,"Three episodes of the comedy/sci-fi series.  The first, 'Cassandra', was when series 8 really came of age, and proved the show was back to its glory days.  Lister and company find the titular computer, who can predict the future.  This leads to hilarious comedy, drama and even food for thought.  In 'Krytie TV', Kryten, having been classified as a woman for not being endowed with, erm, certain male characteristics, is now joining in girls' skipping teams and painting his foot red with nail varnish.  When they find out he uses the female showers, the male prisoners sabotage him and force him to film them.  In 'Pete', the discovery of a virus which can eat potato skins leads to disaster, and a time-wand regresses a short-sighted inmate's pet sparrow into a Tyrannosaurus Rex.  A must-buy if you're a fan.",1104537600,,811,4.833333333333333

The only other review I saw on the US site, was written up by someone who had no idea what they were talking about. Otherwise, it is great! If you are a Dwarfer, then don't hesitate to buy this one!",973382400,9,321,3.953846153846154
