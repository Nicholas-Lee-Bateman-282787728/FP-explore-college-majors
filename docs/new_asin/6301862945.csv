7922976,4,6301862945,"As is true of ""Black Arrow"" films and TV series, so with this animated version of the Stevenson classic: they do not faithfully portray the plot of the novel. This rendition is better than most, though: enough remains of the adventure of the original for ""The Black Arrow"" aficionado like me to enjoy. Will Lawless's cooking is a subject of humor in this show, although not in the book. The popularization of reality cooking contests in prime time TV heighten the ""high five"" one would give to Lawless for improving his cuisine. Kids will like this rendition of the Stevenson masterpiece.",1411776000,,588,4.8316831683168315
