During her nap, she encounters one baby animal after another wandering far from the safety of their families. Cora is troubled by this and decides to help each of the lost babies find their way home. As dreams sometimes go, Cora has no luck finding the mothers of these little ones, and when seeking help, realizes her own mother is missing. These surprising problems are soon resolved with the help of a kindly, but enchanted neighbor lady. When Cora awakes from her troubling dream she is grateful to be surrounded by her brother and sister at a perfectly lovely tea party prepared by her very own loving mother.""

8248905,4,B001332LZ0,"Little Sister is timeless, and incredibly sweet...a throwback to the old days. If you are looking for a little treat to enjoy with the children (ages 3 to 7 or even older), especially kids who appreciate the simplicity of farm life, this is it.

The film is relatively short, it's tender in message, and the voice of the mother is so kind, gentle. If you long for the simple messages of years gone by, and the precious innocence of little children and baby animals, you and your family will find it in Little Sister.",1211155200,4,516,4.48936170212766
