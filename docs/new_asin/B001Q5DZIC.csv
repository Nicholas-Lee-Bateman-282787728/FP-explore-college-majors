8335023,1,B001Q5DZIC,Waste of money!  A much better book on the topic is available on Amazon.com is Ken Keuffel's book = Winning Single Wing Football: A Simplified Guide for the Football Coach by Ken Keuffel (Apr 2004),1403913600,,197,4.628571428571429
8335024,5,B001Q5DZIC,"As a new coach going against the establishment (""this is the way weve done it for years""), I really needed some ammo to install the single wing offense. This DVD delivers. Dave Cisar explains things in simple language and doesn't talk above his audience. I learned quite a bit from this DVD and was excited about this offense. I also purchased his book (CD) a step by step guide to installing the single wing offense. We will be the only team in our league running this offense and I couldn't be happier. Scores in our league have been around 12-6 at best. I can't wait to blow these teams out of the water!",1306454400,,607,4.380530973451328
