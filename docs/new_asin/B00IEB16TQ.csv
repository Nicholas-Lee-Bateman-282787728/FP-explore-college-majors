I usually do 2 workouts a day and sometimes burn a1000 calories.",1409356800,2,302,4.189655172413793

6261003,4,B00IEB16TQ,"let me preface my comment by saying that i love zuzka and have been following her since her bodyrock days. i've purchased one of her other dvds and even had a zgym subscription at one point. to put it mildly, i LOVE zuzka's workouts and her philosophy for fitness. that is why i was so eager when this dvd series came out. i'd been wanting to train with kettlebells for quite sometime and saw this series as the perfect opportunity to finally get started.

i am now at the final workout in the series, and i must saw i've enjoyed getting stronger and feeling leaner, but i absolutely hate how zuzka does not review the moves in a workout before starting the timer. she has done that in the past (review the moves and explain the form for 1-3 minutes before the actual workout). while this may be more time consuming, for moves that are as technical as kettlebell moves, i think it would be great to know what moves we'll will be performing in each workout so we can anticipate the changes and prepare ourselves.

although zuzka goes through all of the motions on the first dvd, it's impossible to reminder techniques for 40+ moves and inconvenient to have to switch between multiple dvds in order to review the moves for each workout. as i said earlier, this was the major thing that annoyed me about the series and even prompted me to write this review. once i become more familiar with kettlebell training and the moves in the series, then my annoyance may lessen. but until then i'll probably get a little frustrated from time to time.

you just have to know what you're getting into and be willing to find ways to make it work for you. i personally pause the dvd at times because i can't move as quickly as zuzka and don't want to compromise my form. overall it's a great dvd and is good for beginners. even with the formatting issues, i would still recommend it to beginners familiar with zuzka's workouts.",1399507200,9,1911,4.485632183908046
6261004,5,B00IEB16TQ,I love this DVD set. Very challenging for an awesome price. You make it as hard as you would like just use a heavier bell. I am sore within hours of doing this. Good quick workouts that I feel are effective and you aren't spending the whole day working out very very good for a busy mom such as myself. I truly love all of her workouts but this is my favorite for sure.,1397174400,6,369,4.0
6261005,5,B00IEB16TQ,"Like all of Zuzana's workouts, this series is well done. Even though it is geared for beginners, it is pretty easy to up the intensity by increasing the poundage of your kettlebell.

I admit, I usually just preview the workouts prior to my workouts, type the workout out, print it, and do the workouts on my own and at my own pace.",1395878400,6,331,4.338709677419355
6261006,4,B00IEB16TQ,"I want to preface this review by saying that I am by no means a KB expert.  It's partially why I purchased this DVD (the other reasons are because I love Zuzka's site and workouts and I own and love all of her other DVDs).  Therefore when I say that this introduction to KBs and Zuzka's instructions are excellent I won't dispute if an RKC KB expert disputes anything I have to say.

PROS:

DVD 1 includes the history of the KB, which I found interesting

DVD 1 also includes a breakdown of every move without specific instructions, technique & form tips. I greatly appreciated the breakdown of the snatch, the Turkish getup, the clean, and everything else as I've learned on my own through other people and YouTube videos how to use the KB.

The workouts aren't long - 2 rounds each with the exception of one workout that contained a lot of exercises and that was 1 round.  She doesn't rush through anything nor is there a timer display, which I think is because it's more important to focus on technique than it is to finish the workout in a specific amount of time.

The workouts follow Z's usually style in that they're about 15 mins long.

CONS:

If you're in good shape and have been doing Zuzka's workouts for a while then I don't think these workouts are going to be especially challenging.  However, it is a beginning KB DVD.  For my benefit I generally do an extra round making it 3-4, which usually helps.  At this point I can't increase weight because then I sacrifice form.

Lack of a timer.  Even though I understand why it may not be included (taking your time and focusing on technique) I still wish it was included.

Lower-body heavy, upper body not so much. Many people may disagree with me, but I feel like most of the workouts are focused primarily on lower body.  Some do included pushups. reverse lunges w/tricep dips and rows, but for the most part I feel that KB swings target my glutes and hamstrings even though I know they include your arms.  I do appreciate the overhead presses and ab work, but, as I find with most of Zuzka's recent workouts, they appear to focus mostly on lower body.

Overall I'm glad I purchased these DVDs because I think Zuzka knows what she's talking about when it comes to kettlebells and it saves me from running out and having to spend an arm and a leg on training.  I do hope that one day I can take some KB classes taught by reputable instructors who can correct my form.",1393459200,24,2429,4.427927927927928

fantastic workout",1419120000,,193,4.647058823529412
8641542,5,B00IEB16TQ,"I recently discovered Zuzka on youtube over the summer and fell in love with her workouts. I bought this off her website and it came in the mail very quickly. She walks you through each exercise and she does it with you (which is something I really like). I'll be honest, these aren't as tough as her other workouts, but it is for beginners or if you are new to kettlebells. After doing each of these workouts, and learning the moves, I hope she comes out with a harder kettlebell series. If you're looking to get into using kettlebells, I definitely suggest this. I started with a 15lb kettlebell, and now I'm using a 26lb one.",1412121600,3,628,4.422413793103448
