8332285,3,B001P72A00,"Stop.  Don't buy this.  Instead, buy Scholastic's DVD titled 20 Fairy Tales - Scholastic Storybook Treasures.  Scholastic packages their picture book based videos on various DVD packages.  If you buy the 20 Fairy Tale DVD instead of this one, you will get all of the exact same videos that are on this DVD, with the exception of Space Case.  AND, the price is one third of this DVD, and you'll get an additional 15 stories.  If you really want Space Case, buy the 20 Halloween DVD, which includes Space Case, plus 19 other stories.  And, that one is dirt cheap, as well.  So, you could buy both of those other DVDs, and still spend way less for those two than you would pay for this one.  It's a no brainer!

Also note, James Marshall is a real hoot and a half, but my experience as a children's librarian for 26 years, is that sometimes his versions aren't what little girls who want a glamorous, princess-like Cinderella are craving.  James Marshall is more comedic--kind of like fractured fairy talks.  He's great fun, and I'm not saying his stories aren't good.  They are just different, and you should know before you buy, that these are silly versions.  In any case, this DVD contains...
Red Riding Hood
Cinderella
Goldilocks & the 3 Bears
The 3 Little Pigs
Hansel & Gretal
Space Case - In case you don't know this book, it's about a space alien who gets the wrong idea of Earthlings when he happens to land here on Trick or Treat night.",1467763200,2,1443,4.5
8332286,4,B001P72A00,This will work quite well in my various aged classrooms. I enjoy having the books on a DVD to review as well.  Thank you.,1403395200,,121,4.041666666666667
8332287,5,B001P72A00,"James Marshall is one of my favorite authors.  The video uses the illustrations from stories all children show know.  I shared it with my grandchildren one weekend and they asked to see it again the following weekend. If you love the genius of Marshall, you'll be enchanted by this video.",1397174400,,288,4.74
8332288,5,B001P72A00,"Never met a kid that didn't enjoy the stories on this DVD. I have dozens of Scholastic DVDs and some of them have one or maybe two of his stories in them, but with this DVD you get all of them. Humorous, yet for the most part, not veering too far from the fairy tales that we are all familiar with. It's also fun to watch after reading a more serious version or two of a fairy tale.",1376179200,,382,3.91025641025641
