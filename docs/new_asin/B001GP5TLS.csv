3617191,3,B001GP5TLS,"Like many of the workout DVDs produced by male celebrity trainers this one seems like Bob is mostly winging it. There are several places where he doesn't count reps or forgets a set on the opposite side, so you end up having to pause the workout if you want to keep things equal for your right and left muscle groups. As a woman I find this workout too focused on upper body and neglecting of significant work for leg/glutes and core. There are also no instructions when beginning each set for how heavy of a weight to grab or how many reps to expect, so since I don't do this workout often, I find myself wishing I had used a heavier weight for some sets and needing to switch to a lighter weight for others. So, in summary, this can be a fairly challenging weights workout even for someone who is in pretty good shape, but the sloppy production and lack of important instructions is annoying if you are used to more professionally done videos.",1483660800,,945,4.405714285714286
3617192,1,B001GP5TLS,Buy this and be the biggest loser - of your money.  This was about as useless as a one arm man in a patty cake contest.,1482364800,,119,3.576923076923077
3617193,5,B001GP5TLS,Enjoying it.,1482364800,,12,5.5
3617194,5,B001GP5TLS,"I thought this was a really great workout.
What I like:
3 different levels
Modifications for difficult moves pointed out clearly
Explains how to vary your dumbbell weight
Music was good, high energy
No crazy moves that you can't figure out

What I didn't like:
Has an option were you can do just the beginning, half the workout, or the entire workout. Given that the entire workout is only about 50 min. I would never do anything but the entire workout.

But overall a great workout. I would recommend this to anyone on any level.",1479513600,,530,4.568421052631579
3617195,5,B001GP5TLS,"As I said before in other reviews, people tend to believe the at-home workouts are easy. They're not! If you are following the trainer's instructions you will be dripping in sweat by the end of the workouts and I'll warn you, the second level is MUCH harder than just doing level one!",1479081600,,284,4.480769230769231

3617212,5,B001GP5TLS,"I had this DVD before but it got too scratched up to continue playing & skipping so I got a new one.

I am an intermediate exerciser.  I spin for 30 mins few times a week & cross train w/ Stephanie Oram DVD.
This DVD is great because I am doing upper & lower body at the same time in 20 mins & you can feel your glutes & thigh muscles burning.  I am a female late 30s.  I use 10 lb weights for this workout.  I will follow my old protocol & do Boot Camp I for 2 weeks before I move on to Boot Camp II.
This DVD has a 5 min warm up,  boot camp I, boot camp 2, boot camp 3, & a 5 minute cool down so this workout can be used for a while before you get bored.",1472601600,,656,3.5208333333333335
3617213,4,B001GP5TLS,I liked this workout. It was challenging enough and offered some diversity in movement. Some of the moves seem to be signature BL moves because they are repeated on almost all there DVDs. But I felt like I got a good workout. Beware: Bob can be a little obnoxious and annoying. He talks a lot and tries to make jokes but there is an option to shut him up and just see the workout.,1471824000,,380,4.148648648648648

3617216,3,B001GP5TLS,Decent video but I felt it wasn't as difficult as I would like. Yes you can add on levels but I don't have time to continue through 2-3 levels a day.,1468886400,,149,3.838709677419355
3617217,5,B001GP5TLS,"This is a great DVD either as a stand-alone, or incorporate some of the workouts with your other cardio or weight training for an even bigger calorie burn!  I especially like the 20-minute workout with Bob and the BL contestants.  It definitely gets you sweating!!  They hit all parts of the body on this DVD.  If you are a beginner doing this workout and some of the moves are too difficult, do a modifier to simplify the exercise while still keeping your heart rate up (for example, they do regular push-ups but I will modify it and do them with my knees on the floor as I cannot do regular push-ups yet).  I do this workout a couple times a week, alternating it with other DVD's that I have.  Love this one!",1467676800,,710,4.340909090909091

3617399,5,B001GP5TLS,"Although this video already has great reviews, I wanted to add to it for those who cant decide if they should buy this video. BUY IT! In the first 6 weeks of use, I lost 16lbs! 3 months later, I have lost 23lbs and counting! Im also getting muscle definition/ toned!  I've tried every quick-fix diet out there, with no avail... It wasn't until I started eating a healthy, balanced diet & included consistent exercise with this video,  that I finally started shedding pounds!  The best part of this video is that there are various people on the video with different fitness levels and I just chose the one that I could keep up with.  Bob is very encouraging and reinforces the fact that you can do what you're comfortable with. I started off overweight, out of breath and could barely do half of the moves. Week by week I pushed myself, and now I feel great! For those of you who are already fit, this video is also good for you. My boyfriend who goes to the gym daily and is in great shape, had a challenge keeping up with the advanced people on the video ;-)",1444003200,,1059,4.333333333333333

I have not purchased any Bob Harper DVDs since this one. I never really watched the Biggest Loser so I didn't buy it as a ""fan"".

3617502,5,B001GP5TLS,"Three segments and warmup and cool down segments. Need weights, floor or mat soft enough to do push-ups if on your knees, optional medicine ball and exercise strip. Need enough room for front and rear and side lunges, though only the front and rear lunges are combined so I turn to the side to have enough room.  I'd say it's a good challenge for intermediate ability, not as quite as difficult as Jillian Michaels (which can be a good thing) but definitely not easy, though there is someone who does modifications on the exercises. I've only made it through the first two segments because the first section is 20 min then the second is 15 and the third is 10 min. You're supposed to progressively add on the segments to the first.  I typically don't have more than 30-45 minutes, but I feel energized and like I've had a goo workout with just the first two segments. I like the fact that the people exercising in the video are some of ""The Biggest Loser"" winners because it's real people who have worked hard to get where they are and therefore if they can push through the challenging exercises then so can I.

At one point I was like forget this I'm going to quit and just then, no lie, Bob said I know you don't want to quit. It's a keeper!",1406678400,,269,3.6551724137931036
3617732,4,B001GP5TLS,"I like this. It's good. It helps. It's friendly because the people in the workout video are everyday people, so it's easier to relate to. For me personally, I haven't been able to complete the workout yet, but hopefully I will.",1406678400,,227,4.560975609756097

This is a pretty good workout for me, I am not in great shape and I am not terribly out of shape.  If you can walk you can do this video.  There are 3 different degrees of difficulty, I am on 1 of 3.  They have alternatives if you want to just do low impact which I like.",1397692800,,375,3.524390243902439

3617773,5,B001GP5TLS,"After having my second child, I had gained 25 lbs :( My sister had lost a lot of weight with the help of this DVD and walking. So I decided to give it a try. I haven't worked out in years so I wanted to see how long I can keep up with this (I'm not big on working out). I started out slow but was able to do 3 days a week along with eating healthier. Within a month, I lost 13 lbs. I LOVE how you can pick how long you want to workout. And there's modifications, which I needed for the first 2 weeks. I would recommend this to anyone who has not worked out in years and start at your OWN pace.",1396569600,,593,3.7142857142857144

3617813,5,B001GP5TLS,i do this at least once a week. i recently had knee surgery so i was looking for something low impact but i would still sweat. it is great. i would recommend.,1394064000,,158,3.96875

3617815,4,B001GP5TLS,"I have a bad knee and with a few modifications this workout has been very good. I have lost 10 lbs in 4 weeks and I still have two weeks to go. It is tough for a 44 year old office worker like me to do the entire thing without resting a few heartbeats...
The only thing about the DVD that I would change, would be less repetition of ""I love it when they're breathing hard, it makes me so happy"", and a couple other corny jokes/banter. I believe only positive things should be said, and I'm not sure if I even like the counting down of reps. Just tell me how to do the exercise and what to do. I'll take care of the rest. Concentrating on form is easier and more productive than concentrating on how many reps are left. Overall though, this is an awesome full body workout that will have you improving your endurance, strength, and looks. Bob is a great instructor and for the price, you won't beat this video.",1393459200,,909,4.2
3617816,5,B001GP5TLS,Love this workout!  It was different and worked every muscle.  Felt like I was being challenged the whole time!  Bob Harper always gives a great workout.,1392768000,,153,4.8076923076923075

3617818,5,B001GP5TLS,level one is a generally good work out but level two will really work you hard. by the time you get to level three (which is easier by comparison) you've gone through a great workout. you will need dumb bells for the program.,1392163200,,225,4.255813953488372
3617819,5,B001GP5TLS,Love this workout! I wanted to mix up my routine so it wasn't so boring.  I've heard good things about this dvd and I really like how it has the different levels and I for sure feel the burn.  All you need is a couple or 5 or 10lb weights.,1392076800,,239,3.76
3617820,5,B001GP5TLS,I think this dvd is definately one of their better ones but it is super hard....definately worth the money though,1391990400,,113,4.7
3617851,5,B001GP5TLS,This video is great for at home workouts. I definitely get my sweat on when working out to this video!,1391558400,,102,4.15
3617852,3,B001GP5TLS,"I used to do a boot camp workout at the gym and it was intervals of strength and cardio with rest periods in between to make the heart rate go up and down.  This is mostly strength, a little cardio and no resting.  It's not bad, and I do work up a sweat, but I have to say I like Jillian's videos much better with her 3-2-1 interveral system and/or my old gym's boot camp program.",1391472000,,380,3.986842105263158
3617853,5,B001GP5TLS,"This workout is awesome.  I was kinda skeptical because I figured it would be just some generic workout, but boy was I wrong.  This thing works out every part of your body in a way that does not put too much stress on your body.  I have had 4 back surgeries over the past 4 years and needed to lose weight to take some pressure off my back.  I was worried about doing workouts like this that I would hurt myself, but it has been the exact opposite.  The more I used the workout the better I felt. This was definitely money well spent.",1390176000,,534,4.096153846153846
3617854,3,B001GP5TLS,"To clarify, I do not have weight problems and am currently not in a stage of trying to lose weight. I regularly exercise, often using Jillian Michael's workout videos.

With that being said, I find this video to just be okay. It only is difficult at some points, such as the extended cardio sections, but for the most part I feel that it is too easy for a seasoned exerciser. I think it is likely a great video to start weight loss and the moves are certainly able to be done by most individuals. I also really appreciate that ""real people"" are used in the video. However, I never feel tired after doing this video or feel any muscle ache the next day.

I typically only use this video when I am not feeling up to doing a strenuous workout, but will still like to get extra movement into my day.",1389657600,,795,4.258278145695364
3617855,5,B001GP5TLS,I have used the Cardio Max and Power sculpt DVD's this is the hardest so far.  Great work out.  Get ready to sweat.,1388707200,,115,3.9565217391304346
3617856,2,B001GP5TLS,If you like a trainer who mugs for the camera this is your dvd.  Otherwise it's pretty standard fare.  Same old workout as all the other fatloss workouts,1388620800,,153,4.428571428571429
3617857,5,B001GP5TLS,I really enjoy this video. I like how you can pick your workout of follow theirs. The music can be turned down or up. Very easy to follow and there are different people to follow for different abilities!,1388534400,,203,4.368421052631579

3617859,5,B001GP5TLS,"This work out makes me sweat harder than pretty much anything else I've ever tried. I like that the moves are simple so I spend the time doing them instead of trying to figure out how to do them. I'm dreadfully uncoordinated and pretty out of shape and can still pull off the steps, even I can't finish all the reps every time.

It has a progressive build up of routines so I can make it harder as I need it to be and continue to challenge myself.

Highly recommend it for an efficient effective exercise video.",1386633600,,511,4.257731958762887
3617860,5,B001GP5TLS,I have several of these workout videos. I really like them because they are doable. You get aa good workout but it isn't super long. I highly recommend these videos to anyone wanting to get and stay in shape.,1386547200,,208,4.358974358974359
3617861,5,B001GP5TLS,"This is well worth the money.  You will definitely work up a sweat.  There are different levels so you don't have to feel as though you're killing yourself right out of the gate.  Take it easy & work your way up.  If you own any of the other Biggest Loser dvds you shouldn't  have too many problems w/this one.  ""As you were!""",1386460800,,326,4.17741935483871

3617863,5,B001GP5TLS,A great workout video that focuses on different parts of the body that I didn't know muscles even existed. I would definitely recommend this one to others.,1386288000,,155,4.777777777777778

3617870,5,B001GP5TLS,"I do like working out with Bob the best right now-I kind of hope they have one with Dolvett. Nice kick start to a day. I use to do this on Wednesdays, but I have no clue on the day-I'm just going to add it to one day a week. I have thought about using only it for six weeks, but I might get bored. I have led a somewhat boring life this last year, so felt it was time to spice it up with Biggest Loser helping fight through my health issues. With the permission of my doctor.",1384732800,,475,3.808080808080808
3617890,5,B001GP5TLS,Good workout for entire body. Bob keeps you motivated.  Works well with his weigt loss yoga cd. I would recommend for beginners or those looking for variety of workouts.,1384646400,,169,4.827586206896552

3617892,4,B001GP5TLS,A good overall workout.  Get ready to sweat.  Modifications shown which help.  It is a challenge-- not really suited for seniors.,1383350400,,129,5.0476190476190474

3617894,5,B001GP5TLS,"I've been using a variety of the Biggest Loser DVD's and while most of them are very good, this one is a step above the rest. It is a constant workout with very few breaks and I happen to prefer Bob's style over some of the other trainers. It has a big focus on legs for the first couple of weeks with lots of squats and lunges, but is does a good job of also including some basic strength training for arms and shoulders. It will definitely give you a good workout and I highly recommend this, especially when you can get it for about $5 here on Amazon.",1381449600,,554,4.091743119266055
3617895,5,B001GP5TLS,REALLY works if you stick with it! I can't believe how good I started feeling after just a week! Within the first month I lost 20 lbs! It's hard and it'll kick your butt in the beginning but it's way worth it in the end!,1380499200,,220,3.911111111111111
3617896,4,B001GP5TLS,I bought this to add some variety to my work out - I am pleased and would recommend. Since I do not do this everyday it is taking me longer to move up levels but that is okay.,1379376000,,175,3.6315789473684212
3617897,4,B001GP5TLS,"This workout video really works!  I have used it for 3 weeks now and can tell a big difference in inches if nothing else.  You really feel the burn when working out.  Plus, if you are like me, a little on the thick side it really helps knowing that the participants that are in the video aren't all skinny!",1379289600,,306,4.1525423728813555

3617912,4,B001GP5TLS,"I like all the options of how you can play it. However, I only do it all workouts three times a week. So, I don't know if the fitness plan works. It's challenging for a few workouts then I got board with it. I started using heavier weights and moving faster and that helped a lot. But the main thing that makes this a amateur made workout video is the count is off for just about all the sets and the contestants have bad form. At first I didn't know if he was counting reps or going by time.",1377129600,,492,3.9797979797979797
3617913,5,B001GP5TLS,"Another great workout from Bob Harper. I really like the 3 different levels -- it allows me to create my own combos, or do the entire DVD as an 55 minute workout (including warm-up and cool-down).",1376524800,,196,4.472222222222222
3617914,5,B001GP5TLS,"The good: for beginners the workout is 30 min. long and you can add more as the weeks go by. Bob works out your whole body and I just feel great afterwards. The people working out with him are regular people from the Biggest Loser show, so some of them are still a bit chunky and do different levels of working out. I like that, you don't see girls and guys that have never been fat in their lives like in other dvds.

The bad: Its a bit boring and the music kind of sucks, but I don't mind this since I've lost 3 Lbs in the first 5 days combining this simple workout with their recipes.",1376265600,,587,4.017094017094017

3617916,4,B001GP5TLS,"I bought this because I can't afford a monthly gym membership but am terrible at motivating myself during workouts. This is a great workout video for people who need someone to motivate them. Bob's energy and attitude definitely will inspire you to follow through the whole workout and work hard. He makes you feel like you are really doing great and helps you feel happy with your decision to work out. After reading another review that mentioned that Heba, who does the modified moves, had bad form, I was able to notice that too. She also doesn't seem to be into it and you can tell that her fitness level is lower. I do like that they include her because it shows that whatever your fitness level, you can be active & strive to be healthy. I would definitely recommend if you're in need of a home workout! It was a harder workout than I thought it would be, though, so it's not a walk in the park.

Note: I didn't realize when purchasing that having hand weights and/or a medicine ball would be needed in the levels 2 & 3. I would like to obtain one and advance int he levels but I don't mind sticking to level 1 for now. Still a good workout!",1375056000,,1147,4.310185185185185
3617917,2,B001GP5TLS,"I really wanted to like this DVD. I have friends who recommended ""Biggest Loser"" workouts and this one sounded perfect-lots of different options at different levels and you can customize your workout. As far as different options and levels, the DVD followed through. While doing the workout, it did make me sweat, which is the whole reason to exercise. However, from the first minute of the warm-up until the last minute of the stretch, I was just waiting for it to be over. I found the workout to be effective, but boring. The music was sporadic and strange, Bob's counts and instructions didn't follow any kind of rhythm and I found the movements to be pretty repetitive.
If Bob was coming to my house to work me out this way, it would probably be fine-it got my heart rate up and got me sweating. But the biggest challenge I find with at home workout DVDs is getting myself to put them in and get started. A boring, uninspiring DVD is not going to work because I am not going to do it.",1374969600,,988,4.434065934065934

3617919,5,B001GP5TLS,"Bought the digital and had it streaming to my PS3 in about 2 minutes.  I'm not a beginner, but I'm not an expert either.  I was SWEATING and working VERY hard.  I would think a beginner can just take it easy and do what you can do.  It's a perfect mix of cardio and weights.  Bob is a great instructor too.  Really feel proud of myself when I can make it through this workout.  :)",1374105600,,380,3.986666666666667

I just bought this video to vary my workout routine, and it is a great workout.  I make it harder by using heavier weights, but I imagine this video is also suited for beginners by using little or no weight.  Bob is a very good motivator and is not condescending.  I don't think I will do it every night for six weeks (or whatever he recommends), but it will be a part of my rotation.  My only complaint is that the workout is light on the abs, so I will supplement with another video or my own ab workout.",1374019200,,620,4.008130081300813

3617945,5,B001GP5TLS,"I started my weight loss routine 4 months ago. I've lost nearly 60 lbs now and this DVD has helped immensely. I use kettlebells as a side exercise, but this DVD honestly has everything you need in it. It was hard, let me get that out first. When someone is overweight and hasn't exercised, if at all, in forever, it's a shock. Yes, you're going to be sore, yes, you will feel like giving up. Most hosts of these type of DVD's annoy me. Bob Harper doesn't. He is straight forward and it helps to see people who have struggled with their weight and to see them now. If you find this DVD too difficult, work your way up. During the exercises you cannot do, keep moving, whatever moving means to you (dancing like an idiot, marching...), it's better than stopping. You will need dumbells, milk jugs, anything of weight that you can find around the house, if you don't have dumbells readily available. I used 3-5 lb dumbells to start. The Format is great and it has a user friendly menu. 5 minute warm-up, a 20 minute Level One, a 15 minute Level Two, a 10 minute Level Three, and a 5 minute cool down. You're meant to do Level One for 2 weeks, then add Level Two, and then add Level Three 2 weeks after that. If you're new to  exercisering, it would probably be better staying on each level for 4 weeks before increasing. Push yourself, but not to the point of injury. We all know when we've had enough. I go just above that, then stop.",1372982400,,1432,4.303703703703704

3617964,4,B001GP5TLS,"I started working out again 9 months after my third child.  I'm 40, and about 40 lbs overweight.  This is the heaviest I've been in a long time, I'm uncomfortable, tired, and feeling older than I think I should feel.  That said, I have other exercise dvds that I use and like, but borrowed this from the library just to try something new.  It is a phenomenal workout and for me worth buying.  I've watched ""The Biggest Loser"" and I'm familiar with Bob as ""the trainer"", though I never disliked him I never saw him as a personal trainer, until this.  He is excellent!  I realize that all video trainers have an obvious background but none have impressed me as much as he has, even Jillian.  The routine is Grade A for me.  The cardio leaves me gasping, and I love doing the weights.  There are exercises I've never done before, and better than anything else I feel energized when I finish working out and can't wait to do it again.  I can say I don't feel that way about all of the other dvds I have.  As I've said, this is a definite purchase for me, and I will be testing many more of his dvds in the near future.  My only gripe, as other reviewers have remarked, are the modified workouts.  That is, not the modified workouts, but the person herself.  She didn't modify, it seemed to me she was just moving in place because standing still was just not going to cut it.  15 minutes into the workout it seemed she did the bare minimum, including the jumping jacks.  As Jillian said in ""30 Day Shred""...'There is no modification for jumping jacks, I've seen 300 lbs. people do this,...you just have to push yourself.""  Her form is sloppy and depressing to watch, and should not have been in the workout video. Just my opinion.",1368835200,,1725,4.38801261829653

I LOVE the fact that I can get a good workout without looking at half-naked people!  (I always hate that in most work out videos- everyone is very skinny and half naked!)  This video doesn't have exciting dance moves or routines, but has a simple music background, with Bob encouraging you to do even better, and it gets the heart pounding and the muscles sore!  I worked out with my husband once, hoping that it would be ""hard"" enough for him, since he is good shape and usually uses a stationary bike for an hour a day.  Let's just say it was hard enough for him!  He now is using it a few times a week himself to strengthen those ""other"" muscles he hadn't been using much!

I find it challenging and I'm still only on level 1 (just started working out again 3 weeks ago after years of being rather sedentary).  I started looking for more dvds to add to my collection because I figured it would keep me from getting bored.  The Biggest Loser dvd looked good, so I thought I'd give it a try.  OMG. I was so surprised at how quickly and how much I was sweating! The sweat was pouring off my face when I was doing push-ups. The funny thing is it was really challenging for me, but for some reason I found the 20 minute BL workout easier to get through than with the 20min Shred dvd (the workouts are broken down into 20min, 15min,  10min sections with 5 mins for warm up & 5 for cool down, you can chose what you do via a menu). By the time I was done my shirt was soaked! That hasn't happened with the Shred video yet.

Now don't get me wrong, this is no ""Insanity"" workout.  If you're super fit I'm not sure how challenging you would find this dvd. I guess you could just increase the amount of weight you are using.  If you ARE at ""Insanity"" level fitness I suppose you could use this as a light day workout when you are don't want to go crazy, but still want to exercise.

3618050,2,B001GP5TLS,"In a word, this workout makes me feel uncomfortable. There are several things that bother me about it. If you're anything like me, you might feel the same way about these things. Let me list them.

1. BOB DOESN'T KEEP GOOD TRACK OF REPS OR SETS: I like my workouts to feel balanced, but Bob's total lack of counting leaves me feeling uneasy. In some places he clearly does more reps on one side than the other. For the sideways lunge, he makes you do two sets on one side and only one set on the other side. Most of the time he neither counts the reps nor keeps track of time. It just makes everything feel off.

2. NO MOTIVATION: Perhaps it's just my video, but the music on this CD hardly comes through. It's just so quiet. There's nothing to pump you up. Bob also has zero motivation factor, in my humble opinion. He lacks enthusiasm, doesn't do half the exercises with you, and has poor interaction with the participating Biggest Loser contestants.  Honestly, I find him annoying, particularly when he neglects to count the reps or time while making some sort of stupid comment to a contestant.

3. MANY WORKOUTS NOT MEANT FOR BEGINNERS: There are some workouts which have even the Biggest Loser winners nearly giving up. It doesn't help that Bob is standing there not doing the workout. I just want to say, ""Please Bob, don't tell me to hold these weights out in front of me when your hands are empty and even your best contestants are trying to sneak in a break. I'm not in shape. OK! Oh, and please learn how to count, because I'm pretty sure we were only supposed to do that for a half minute, and we went way over.""

4. Did I mention Bob can't count?

There are some positives. I list them here only to be balanced.

1. FULL BODY: Bob alternates between your upper and lower body constantly. The constant switching means that no one muscle group gets too tired while your body as a whole gets a good workout.

2. GOOD WARM UP AND COOL DOWN: I will sometimes just do the warm up and cool down by themselves, and together they provide a nice 10 minute workout on a day I might not have worked out at all.

The plan on the DVD has you doing the first workout for 2 weeks then adding the second workout for 2 weeks followed by  adding the 3rd workout for an additional 2 weeks.  Doing your workout 4-5 times a week.  The first workout is mostly toning, the second workout adds some cardio intervals to the toning and the third workout is mostly toning again.  The workouts include lots of squats/lunges and use of dumbbells.  The video isn't overly polished.  It is more like a video of a trainer working with his clients than your typical workout video.  There is one participant that does all the moves correctly, she is in the front for all of the workouts.  The rest are just average joes.

It will definitely make you sweat and thats what Bob likes to see.  When I started using this video almost a month ago I couldn't even do a normal jumping jack. Since then I have gotten so much stronger and the results are visible. I've lost pounds and inches and now I can do all of the jumping jacks that Bob wants you to do in the video. It makes you feel amazing! I love the challenges and it has truly motivated me to do more. I'm slowly working my way out of the modified moves into the more challenging ones. Its a great video and Bob is a great trainer....he gives you cues when to change moves and keeps you pushing yourself through the pain because you can do this. Looking forward to trying his Ripped Core workout....I know he is going to challenge me and make me sweat regardless!,1334707200,,924,4.209039548022599
3618092,5,B001GP5TLS,I had enjoyed this DVD so much. It was a medium intense bootcamp. Just when you think it's over it's not. The thing about Bob is that he keeps you repeating the same exercise until you can feel the burn. And he enjoys when you feel it. I guess that's apart of working out. If you want results get this bootcamp DVD using weights. It was worth it.yay,1333324800,,349,4.147058823529412
3618093,5,B001GP5TLS,"I'm in my late 50's and needed something easy to use for a workout in my own home. I tried Fitness places but most of the battle was just getting out of the house and go. Plus in the winter time and snow on the ground, made the prospect of going even less. So I searched through the various workout DVDs when I came across this series. I have seen a little bit of the show Biggest Loser but not enough to know who was on it or how it was all really done. But what I had seen I liked in the concept...taking average people like myself and helping them with ways of getting in better health, besides losing weight, that was easy to follow. They don't take people who are already in shape to get them in better shape. Another factor was the cost. I could purchase the three Biggest Loser DVD series workouts for the cost of one of the more notable workout DVDs. So it was a small financial risk to try these DVDs.

I was very surprised how good all of the DVDs were. Each is a little different in the different types of exercises, but all are broken down into three levels of workout, plus a warm-up and a cool-down session. My preference was the Boot Camp DVD so far for getting started. I needed to get muscles going that I have not used in some time and the workout on the Boot Camp DVD fit me best.

The DVD is setup so you pick with workout or workouts and then it will run automatically to each session you selected without having to touch the remote control of the DVD player again. How awesome is that. If you are pressed for time you can select your workout by how much time you have.

Level 3 a 10 minute workout
Level 2 a 15 minute workout
Level 1 a 20 minute workout
Warm-Up a 5 minute workout
Cool-Down a 5 minute workout

I select the Warm-Up, Level 3, and Cool-Down in the menu and then all three run automatically and it gives me a 20 minute workout. As you move up in Levels the time lengthens but also the intensity of the workout. The plan is that in six weeks you'll work your way up to Warm-Up, Level 1, and Cool-Down for a 30 minute workout. But since you set the workout yourself you decide at what pace you will increase your workout if at all. You may be fine with a 20 minute workout. The only optional equipment, and I do mean optional, used was one set of ether 5 or 10 pound weights, a stretch/body band, and a soccer size ball. However Bob shows you ways how to do the exercises without this equipment.

Even with 20 minutes I'm sweating pretty good by the end of it and pretty sore for the first few days. Bob Harper has away of putting you through a workout without seeming like it's over whelming. The people working out on the DVD with Bob are average guys and girls. If I can do this anyone can if they so choose.

If you want a user friendly, average person great workout, for a great price, this is the DVD set you are looking for - The Biggest Loser.",1331596800,,2885,4.142857142857143

This DVD allows you to customize your workout, you can do a 5min warm up, workout 1 (20min), 5 min cool down, which is what I done today, you can move up as you wish. Bob recommends that you do this circuit for 1 week and then add more as you go. I also take these DVDs to the gym and use them with my friends and we just love them.

The trainer is ANNOYING!!!!! Wow, I couldn't get past that enough to even concentrate.  This guy is leading a boot camp dvd? What a joke! Also, it's NOT boot camp at all. It's pretty basic moves that most people already know. Really dissapointing item.  I used it one time and got rid of it.

I'm still on Level 1 because I just started a little over a week ago, but I don't dread sliding this into my DVD player in the morning before going to work and actually am looking forward to progressing to Level 2 in another week. It's recommended that you stay with the first level for two weeks before moving on to the next level.

This is a fast-paced workout beginning with a 5 minute warm-up to get your heart pumping and your muscles warm. After warming up, level 1 (20 minutes) ups the cardio-fat burning a notch with some of the exercises requiring working out with weights (don't worry, start out with 2.5 pound dumbells or 5 or 10 pound weights, whichever feels comfortable while still being a little challenging). You'll exercise along with people of varying sizes and abilities, so you won't be intimidated by svelte gals and muscular guys...they're normal looking people here. Besides, you'll be exercising at home. Who's gonna see?

In all, there are 5 parts to the Boot Camp Workout: 1. WARM-UP (5 minutes), 2. LEVEL 1 (20 minutes), 3. LEVEL 2 (15 minutes), 4. LEVEL 3 (10 minutes), and 5. COOL-DOWN (5 minutes). It will probably take you 8 weeks to reach the COOL-DOWN segment. Hey! What would you be doing for 8 weeks when not working out? You certainly wouldn't be burning calories and feeling great.

I alternate between this and the Biggest Loser Weight Loss Yoga DVD about 3-4 times per week. The Weeks 1-2 workout is great, and I've just added on the Weeks 3-4, which is definitely a step up in the difficulty scale. As for the low impact part, there are a lot more squats and lunges than I care for, but if anything hurts my knee I just do a modification.  To the reviewer that stated he/she didn't even break a sweat, they clearly weren't putting all their energy into it.

I find Bob rather sloppy with his counting and left/right progressions. You will find in his newer Biggest Loser videos someone counting for him, and in his own Kettlebell workout admit he can't count.  He needs a little more focus and his producers, directors, and stage managers need to help him a little.

It is refreshing to see different level of abilities and genders on the screen doing the workout with you. Another great positive is that Bob encourages you to work at your pace and ability.

The workout reminded me of Bob's Inside Out strength dvd in terms of some of the moves, yet it's less hardcore and more doable, while delivering just as good of a workout.  You know you're getting a good workout once sweat is dripping into your eyes and mouth!

There's a lot of combo moves in this workout using squats/lunges with weights.  I found that they really challenged my balance...and of course, if it's Bob, there's going to be tons of push ups and planks.  I personally think Bob does such a great job with core work.

I actually like this workout more than Jillian's No More Trouble Zones.  In Boot Camp, you are using weights pretty much the whole time, going strong until the very end.  I also enjoy listening to Bob talk.  I find him to be really encouraging, and he really pushes you to last through each countdown.

I've seen exceptional growth in my own fitness now that I'm done with the first level, I can't wait to add on level two, even though it looks even harder. This is the first time I've stuck with any fitness routine for more than a week and a half, and I love this DVD! Bob, as always, is great at pushing you to work your hardest. I will say that some of the contestants do exhibit poor form, but as others have noted, Bob makes up for that with ample explanation. By the time you know the routine, you can simply direct your efforts at making sure your form is on point without worrying too much about the contestants. I'm determined to finish this six week program and, in all, I think this is one of the best workout DVD's I've ever done.",1280102400,,991,4.139896373056994

3618155,4,B001GP5TLS,"Let me preface this by saying that I started using this DVD five days ago at 45 years of age, 5'8"", and 238 lbs.  I haven't worked out regularly in about five years, though I do walk my dog around the block (1-2 miles) regularly.

I haven't every seen the The Biggest Loser TV show, because I just don't like reality shows.  This DVD, however, came highly recommended, and I'd read the glowing and inspiring reviews here on Amazon.

There are three levels, a warm-up and cool-down set, and some tips on using exercise equipment (dumbbells, exercise ball, etc.).  You are intended to do the warm-up, then Level One for the first two weeks, and finish with the cool-down.  After five days of doing Level One, I can honestly say this is probably the best workout video I've ever seen.  Bob, the trainer, is highly motivating, funny, and charismatic, and I think he is the key ingredient here.  The Biggest Loser contestants vary nicely in height, girth, and stamina, so you are likely to find one or two that match the level you are at.

Heba is struggling along in the back, and I'm right there with her, bless her heart.  I can't do the jumping jacks because I have a strained Achilles tendon, so I'm walking in place as she does when everyone else is doing the higher impact moves.  It's not a long routine, but my shirt is soaked up front when it's all said and done, and I've dropped about four pounds in five days.  Yes, I'm not exaggerating, four pounds in five days.  I have modified my diet in that time, usually having a 6"" light subway sandwich or mixed fruit for lunch, and drinking lots of water all day and prior to each meal.

So if you are older or out of shape, or both for that matter, I think this video will motivate you to get started and to stick with it.

I'm looking forward to seeing the results after two months of this.  I haven't gotten tired of it yet.  Maybe that's just because I've gotten tired of feeling like crap all the time from being so overweight and out of shape.  I just had a physical this week, so I plan on having my cholesterol rechecked two months from now to see how much it's dropped, and I'll post it here.",1277942400,,2152,4.350877192982456

I am a busy homeschooling mom with 9 children, but after loosing 30 lbs last year I decided I really wanted to 'tighten' :-) So I picked this up at a local store, after being inspired by the Biggest Loser show, which I have not watched before this season. All I can say is WOW I must be SO out of shape even with all the little people I carry around because after one attempt at doing  HALF of the first part of the beginner segment, I hurt so bad I could hardly climb my stairs to go to bed. I hurt terribly for 3 days. 2 weeks later I decided to try again, this time doing half of the reps, but doing each exercise and walking in place while I waited  for the next exercise. I have found I am not nearly as sore, but really break a sweat, I am working on building up to full beginner status.

Levels 1 and 2 incorporate bursts of cardio to elevate your heart rate and burn more calories. In level 3 a resistance band is used, although you can use weights too. The cooldown incorporates yoga moves that make you feel great after a workout. What I love about this DVD is that you can select what workouts you want to do and the order of those workouts. Personally, I love to do level 2, then 1 then 3.
I should say that the former contestants in this DVD are sometimes a little off in terms of their form or what they're supposed to be doing and that could be a little distracting.

I don't know what Bob did before Biggest Loser, but it was not work out videos.  He has great moves and I don't pay attention to the slackers in the background, for me it is about the workout that I do. Bob is personable and he mixes it up so that you can get your cardio and strength training all in one. I believe that most workout dvd's can be modified by the viewer to up the intensity or lower as needed, those who say this is not tough enough you just need to pick up heavier weights or jump a little higher or faster and the same goes for those who say it is toooo much.

3618256,4,B001GP5TLS,"Let me preface this review by saying I am not an exercise lover. I have never been one of those people that enjoys working out. Yes, I do exercise, because I know it is important for my health, and it is aiding me in my weight loss journey. That being said, I was shocked when I started doing this DVD workout...because I found myself enjoying it! From the start of this workout, Bob motivates you and just when you feel like you might throw in the towel, he somehow convinces you to keep going. I was exhilarated after completing just one week of this Biggest Loser bootcamp and I was inspired to keep it up for the the full 6-week workout program.

This workout DVD has three levels and the idea is to spend two weeks working out at each level: Level One is 30 minutes in total, including the 5-minute warm up and cool down segments. Level Two tacks on an additional fifteen minutes to Level One, and Level Three adds 10 minutes to your workout. When you reach the 5th and 6th weeks of the program, your workouts will last 55 minutes. The workouts combine high-intensity weight lifting and muscle toning intervals with brief cardio intervals. Bob provides an intense workout for sure! When I started the bootcamp, my heartrate started to climb within the first three minutes of the warm-up period! And I am always bathed in sweat and breathing heavy by the end of any level of the workout. Also, the strength training exercises really help you build muscle and tone--I was sore and achy from the workouts for the entirety first week (of course, I had not been doing any strength training, so if you are already very fit, you might not feel the burn as much).

What I really like about this workout DVD is that you can tailor it to your own fitness level. You can use whatever weight of dumbbells you feel most comfortable or most challenged by; also, there is always at least one contestant who modifies the moves so that beginning exercisers will be able to complete the workout without exhausting themselves. For instance, in one cardio segment, when the contestants are doing jumping jacks, one contestant (Heba from Season 6) is marching in place. This is helpful if you are new to an exercise regimen.

Fans of the show (like me!) will like working out with Bob, who pushes you but provides support at the same time. It is also fun to see the contestants from past seasons; even the most fit of them work up quite a sweat! But if you don't watch the show, you'll still be getting in a great workout.

I would definitely recommend this workout to anyone looking to increase the intensity of their exercise routine and add elements of strength training and muscle toning exercises. I don't think I would recommend this workout for brand new exercisers, as it really is quite a workout. But for anyone who does the least bit of exercise (I was only engaging in a walking routine for a few weeks before starting this bootcamp DVD), it will definitely give a boost to your exercise regimen.

Final Word: And yes, I have lost weight during the course of the 6-week bootcamp; but I am also a Weight Watchers member. So while I can't say for sure that the Biggest Loser Bootcamp will definitely make you lose weight, I think if you are also engaging in healthy eating habits and watching portion sizes, then this DVD can aid you in your weight loss journey!",1256774400,,3356,4.540495867768595

3618260,4,B001GP5TLS,"I've tested out virtually every Biggest Loser dvd out there now (plus one of Jillian Michaels) and I love them all for different reasons. The 2nd and 3rd series of the dvds feature two programs with complementary exercises. In this case, Boot Camp serves as a good muscle-toning workout with a bit of cardio mixed in, as a complement to Weight Loss Yoga for a flexibility / abs workout.

The actual Boot Camp workout is pretty satisfying as you feel yourself get strong with every week - and the interval levels feel like they come at exactly the right time. As you move up from level 1 to level 2 you'll feel like you're totally on top of the strength chain, only to be decimated by the intensity of level 2. Same goes for the upgrade to level 3, although it's actually the easiest / most relaxed of the 3 levels.

The workout mixes tons of lunges (front, side, back, and held) and squats (including curtsy, pile, and regular) with various upper body and ab workouts. I'd say Boot Camp offers the most diverse range of activities for a real grab bag ranging from jumping jack plank to punches to push-ups.

My main issues with the later series of the Biggest Loser dvds is the time commitment involved. I'm a relatively fit person already, so the desire to spend 55 minutes per session (once you get up to level 3) isn't really there for me, especially since level 2 is incredibly draining. Also the personality of the contestants in the background is somewhat diminished as Bob reigns them in to focus on fitness first and foremost, and loses some of his spirit along the way.

Still, I generally like this dvd and think after you push yourself through the initial 6-week period, you should feel comfortable with combining various levels on this dvd, or with other dvds for a more well-rounded, less time-consuming workout.",1253145600,,1825,4.6234567901234565

Another thing I love is that you can customize your workout, say you like section 2 and 3, you can do a warm up then just sections 2 and 3 skipping 1, or say you want to do 1 and 3 you can do that too, or if you just want a quick workout with section 3 you can do that too.  Is great if you get bored easily, and its also great to shock your muscles a little once they've gotten used to the workout you've been doing, just switch up the order or exchange one for the other and its like a whole new dvd!

3618278,4,B001GP5TLS,"I'm a physical therapist, so I am extremely critical of exercise videos, and poor form/instruction makes me crazy.  I've also never seen the show Biggest Loser, so I didn't know any of the participants here and I didn't really know what to expect.  But I do like working out at home sometimes and this video got great reviews, so I gave it a try.  I echo the great reviews: This is an excellent workout, both challenging and well put-together, and the instruction is top-notch.

The Cast:  This workout is led by Bob, who I take to be a trainer from the show.  Bob manages what very few do: he is likable without being syrupy, and motivating without being obnoxious.  His form is perfection that makes my PT heart sing, and his instruction and cueing are perfect as far as safe and effective form. He makes me want to watch the show.  Working out with Bob is Ali, who I think is the season 5 winner and who has form as close to perfect as a non-professional gets.  When Bob's talking, watch Ali for form.  There are also Bill (S4 winner?) and Bernie (at home winner - whatever that is) - they both have good form and Bernie is charming.  Michelle is in 2 of the 3 segments - she has very good form herself, second only to Ali.  The last 2, who thankfully are not in every segment, are Vicky and Heba.  Heba is often the demonstrator of the modified form of an exercise and I think this is a HUGE mistake.  (It's why I give 4 stars instead of 5.)  Her form is dreadful, in almost every exercise and position.  Please don't watch her!  Having modifications is crucial, but they should NOT be given to the least fit person to demonstrate - they should be given to a very fit person who can demonstrate safe and perfect form to the beginners who are likely following the modifications.  Bad call on that casting.

The Format:  A very nice and easily customizable menu.  There is a 5 minute warm-up, a 20 minute Level One, a 15 minute Level Two, a 10 minute Level Three, and a 5 minute cool down.  You are meant to do Level One for 2 weeks, then add Level Two, and then add Level Three 2 weeks after that.  It's  nice plan though a beginning exerciser would probably be best served staying on each level for 4 weeks before increasing.  Of course you can do whatever you feel like doing / have time to do each day.  My pre-teen son, who wants to start using weights, does just the Level Three - a few times a week.  (He has no need for anything else as he is an active athlete.)

The Exercises & Equipment:  Level One is no walk in the park - and it may be out of reach for the very unfit. It's a challenging mix of low impact cardio (one high impact spot - modification for low impact given) and work with hand weights.  I would advise someone new to exercise to do this level for at least 2-3 weeks without any weights, before attempting to add weights.  Level Two is very hard - it uses hand weights (and a medicine ball though this is optional) with a mix of squats, lunges, pushups, tough ab work, and exhausting plyometrics.  It's a GREAT workout!  Modifications are always given but still I would call this workout intermediate - advanced.  Level Three is pure muscle work using hand weights or a resistance band.  It's well put together, hitting every major upper body muscle group.  In my opinion, though this is not stated anywhere, Level Three is the only place where it would be appropriate to use a heavy hand weight, as you are doing specific and slow sets on each muscle group.  The first 2 levels move along pretty fast, and there is some repetitive work, so my professional advice (to women) would be that nothing heavier than 5lb dumbbells (most people should keep it at 3 lbs, beginners could use 1 or 2 lb weights) should be used, or you could potentially aggravate your shoulders and/or develop a tendonitis.

Bottom Line:  Excellent workout, both in terms of effectiveness and of structure, with great cuing and a likable coach.  Downgraded from 5 to 4 stars because of the poor form shown in the modifications.",1246838400,,4027,4.41112618724559

I am a retired senior citizen, and exercise daily, and found I could keep up, but I did find this video a true workout. I liked the fact you could program how much you wanted to do by choosing 1 to 3 workouts, and then adding the warm-up and cool-down. The instruction by Bob is very clear, but the cueing is awful. (I would have given this 5 stars were it not for the bad cueing, and giving it 4 stars was a stretch, too, but the workout itself is soooo good.) You may be keeping up with the group exactly, but when the camera goes from Bob showing something back to the group, you will be off (or, rather, they are off). This is constant and very annoying throughout the entire video. But the workout itself gets a #10.

Ultimately, it's up the participant to use a challenging amount of weight(s) and really emphasize and exaggerate every move he has you do, but if you do so, you will not be disappointed in the workout that it provides.  Everybody has his/her weakest spots but for me, there is no more challenging exercise in the 20 minutes than the walking pushups and pushup plank position.  Your shoulders will be trembling by the time you stand up.  Bob is a great instructor.  Best of all, it's 20 minutes in your living room and you're good to go.",1244160000,,693,4.548387096774194
3618318,3,B001GP5TLS,"This is a pretty good workout.  I like how Bob incorporates multiple exercises in the moves.  So you work the arms and legs together, etc.  It stops you from focusing on the pain in one area and keeps you moving.  I do work up a good sweat.  Compared to other DVD's I've done (from Beachbody) this is less boring.  Standing these just doing arm curls can get really tedious and I don't need a DVD to do that, so this is good. The combination of activities and the fact Bob keeps you moving is much better.

Where is what could be better:
First, I don't like the amount of leg lunges that are involved.  I don't mind them, but don't have to room to jump sideways, lunge 2 steps forward and backward.  The producers of the DVD should have remembered that people do these are HOME, not a studio somewhere.  So my range of motion is limited compared to the DVD, unless I throw out my coffee table.

Second, other workout DVDs I've done include a timer on the screen so that you can see how much longer you have, or until you change to the next move.  This is a good motivator, but also helpful when you trying to squeeze a workout into a busy schedule.  Maybe this won't bother me after I've do the DVD a hundred times, but it is a nice feature when you simply trying to get through the workout and keep your heart hate up.

Overall, I like the DVD and will probably try others from the biggest loser once I get bored of this one.  I could be better, but ultimately I sweat and build muscle.  If you like the show, I'd recommend this.  Bob is veyr good.",1244073600,,1549,4.196610169491525

3618321,5,B001GP5TLS,"I was a person who was really wanting to do a bootcamp program, but after pricing the programs out there,  realized it was just way too pricey. I decided to look for a program I could do I home that would motivate me and give me those results for a fraction of the cost. This DVD is perfect for that!
I have been doing this workout just over two weeks, just adding on level 2. I have to say this is a great workout, but tough. Be prepared to sweat!
It very similar to the other BL workouts, where it switches from cardio to weights to abs.
It also has a maximum results program, where you start with level one and every two weeks, you add on a level.
I feel the transiton of the add on is perfect, as the second week ended I was ready for the challenge to add on level 2 and I did.
Level 2 is definately a challenge, I couldn't wait for it to be over, but I knew I was getting a great workout so I stuck it out.
My only negative thing I have to say about the BL dvds is you don't know what equipment you'll need until you watch the workout. I have a ton of workout gear so it didn't affect me, but for a novice I would think it would be nice to prepare ahead of time for the workouts.
I saw on other reviews people didn't like the background or music, but I think people are being a bit too nit-picky. The background is just fine, and the music is from show, and oddly motivating, but that's just me.
Another thing thats nice is does has bursts of cardio to keep your heart rate up, so I think if you just use this alone you could get ideal results.
That said, I don't think you would overdo it to add on some other form of cardio either. I think doing that will help to ensure the results too. That's what I am doing, but only because I want to do a 10k. Also, my 20 year reunion is coming up too and want to look good in my dress! LOL.

I did sweat, and my heart rate was raised, but not as intense as I had hoped.  It didn't keep your heart rate going the whole time, and even the portions that were intended to get it up there were not doing the trick.  I am not a beginner exerciser, and don't have any more weight to lose, I have already lost 100 lbs.  But am still working on toning etc.  I like Bob, and Love Jillian, so I thought this Dvd would be great.  I will still use it in my rotation of exercises, however it just wasn't quite as difficult as I had hoped!

It does give several different levels of intensity, as well as lets you choose whether you would like a warm up, a 20 min workout, a 15 minute workout, and a 10 minute workout as well as a cool down (it might be two 10 min. workouts not a 15 min one) So if it is a hectic day and you don't have as much time or energy as you would like you can choose what you want, which is nice.",1241481600,,1049,3.938388625592417

However, when I went on to the last 2 levels, that's when I started to feel like I was actually working out a little.  I got through all 3 levels the first time I did it, and liked the challenge of the last two levels. . . but. . . I didn't feel like I was sufficiently challenged all the way through.  I know it's supposed to be a leveled workout where you add difficulty after a few weeks of staying on a level, so maybe this workout wasn't appropriate for my fitness level.  However, after having done the Biggest Loser volume 1 workout, the Cardio Max, and the Power Sculpt, I felt this was a huge let down.  I will most likely do this workout again when I want a lighter workout on a ""rest"" day, but it won't be the workout I pick when I want my butt kicked and sweat pouring off me by the end.

I've had many home workouts in the past, but this one is a keeper.

Things I Like:
1.  DVD is broken up into 3 levels of workouts like most of the Biggest Loser DVDs along with a warmup and a cooldown.
2.  Bob provides encouragement along the way and you can see how hard most of the contestants are working and you feel like if they can do it, you can too.
3.  The length of each segment is perfect.  To be able to get a complete workout in 30-50 minutes is ideal, even for someone who is busy like me.
4.  You really do feel like you hit every body part.  I was really sore when I first started.
5.  There are modified version of most of the exercises which you can start with if you don't feel comfortable at first.

I question the casting of Heba and Vicki (gag me) on the Boot Camp work-out.. did you read any of the blogs???  I couldn't find a single positive comment about Vicki.  I just wanted to scream every time I looked at that whiny, conniving, troublemaking, angry, unhappy woman; in fact, I quit watching TBL for the remainder of that season and per the blogs so did many people.  And neither of them puts forth a bit of effort in this work-out DVD just like during the season they were a contestant.  Why use them when you had so many contestants that were there for all the right reasons?? For instance, Kae had a great attitude and did the work.. And in the earlier TBL DVDs you used Julie, Hollie and Isabeau and they were so negative and whined the entire season.

3618399,5,B001GP5TLS,"I have been using The Biggest Loser CardioMax workout for quite some time.  I usually do the Level 1 workout twice through--that's 40 min.  I really like Bob's workout but didn't care too much for the other two.

I did have to work up to this, when I first started I couldn't even come close to finishing it one time through much less two, but alas I kept at it and worked my way up to two times through.

I did this Boot Camp workout yesterday for the first time and it's GREAT.  I don't plan on replacing my CardioMax but plan on alternating.  This workout is VERY challenging without being complicated.  The moves require strength but you don't have to concentrate to figure out how to do them properly.  The Boot Camp does LOTS more arm work than the Cardio Max does but that's not a bad thing at all.  My upperbody strength is nowhere near even with my lower body.  The Bootcamp doesn't lack for lower body work at all it's just that it combines it with a lot more arm and core workout than the Cardio Max.

I read that some people didn't care for the music.  I don't either on this one or the CardioMax one.  So I started just using my ipod when I do the workout.  Since this is not a 'dance' workout it works great.  I can listen to my own music that I enjoy but still do this workout.

I also saw people complainign about the ""dark"" background.  Honestly, I wouldn't have even noticed had it not been for the reviews and it doesn't bother me at all.

This is an EXCELLENT workout and I recommend it for EVERYONE...even if you can only do a few minutes at first, you will be able to work up to the whole thing if you keep at it.

All the reviews that have complaints with them really seem like they are just looking for an excuse not to work out.  They are looking at the superficial things rather than the workout itself.

BUY THIS DVD!!!!  You won't regret it...if you're looking to work out and not looking for eye candy.",1232928000,,1931,4.232876712328767
3618400,5,B001GP5TLS,"My fiance and I are getting married in 9 months, and really wanted to jump start our fitness (and weight loss) before the big day.  We bought this DVD, and absolutely love it!  I go to the gym regularly and thought I was getting a good workout.  The first couple of days after doing this video, my arms and legs were incredibly stiff and sore.  That told me that this video was working muscles that weren't getting worked on in the gym.

Bob is extremely motivating and positive.  You will find yourself talking back to (and sometimes yelling) at the TV, but it's such an intense workout, and you feel great afterwards. And it's nice to see all of the contestants there in the background.

I would highly recommend this video to anyone looking for a really intense workout that can be done at home.  We also got Jillian's 30-day Shred, so I'm sure I'll be writing a review for that soon!",1232582400,,887,4.432098765432099
3618401,5,B001GP5TLS,"I am only a few pounds overweight with a pretty small frame, but I am by NO means physically fit!  A lot of other DVDs (many of Jillian Michaels' programs) are too difficult for me and I end up losing interest so quickly, or simply giving up.  Not to mention, I do not do well with shouty aerobics teachers. This is the first time I have ever bought a workout DVD and continued with it for more than 5 days in row...that is saying A LOT for me.  Bob is way less annoying than Jillian and having the Biggest Loser contestants running the show makes you feel like a normal human being if you are struggling.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who struggles with motivation--it is fun, feasible, and allows you several different levels of intensity as you grow.  This is one I can stick to!",1232496000,,793,4.331081081081081
3618402,4,B001GP5TLS,"I have two other Biggest Loser workout DvD and by far Boot Camp is the most intense.  Bob doesn't go easy especially on the level 2 workout.  It's extremely exhausting, but if you stick with it you definetly will see results!",1232409600,,225,4.463414634146342

3618404,1,B001GP5TLS,I didn't care to much for this DVD. I like the cardio and the strength ones better. I felt like I wasn't benefiting anything and I was hoping to break a sweat...not even close. I ended up buying Jilian Michaels 30 day shred. I love it!,1232236800,,235,4.130434782608695
3618405,5,B001GP5TLS,"I was not sure if I wanted to buy this workout after reading some of the reviews so I found this DVD at my local library. I tried it and loved it. This workout is a great strength training workout that will challenge every muscle you have. I thought I would be distracted by Heba and Vicki but I was so focused on trying to get through the workout myself that I barely even noticed they were there. I have done Bootcamp 1 and 2 so far and can't wait to work my way up to the last level.

For those of you who are not sure if you really want to buy this DVD, I would recommend checking your local libraries and check it out for a couple of weeks.",1232150400,,645,3.9236641221374047

My workout partner brought this DVD over last week and it kicked out butts and that was just on the 20 minute workout!!!  The next day we tried the 15 minute workout, and lets just say it was a lot harder than the 20.

I have the Biggest Loser Powersculpt, Cardio Max, and Weight-Loss Yoga DVDs, and have always found them to be effective workouts. What I really like about this DVD is that you use weights & cardio during the same workout, and it doesn't matter what level you are performing. Bob puts you through a workout that uses weights during intensive lower body moves such as lunges and squats. There are also bursts of cardio which really get your heart pumping. A great DVD for your colletion.",1231891200,,617,4.517857142857143
3618409,5,B001GP5TLS,I wasn't sure what to expect from this video after reading the reviews.  I enjoy this video quite a bit.  It is a little different from the other Biggest Loser videos.  Change-up is an important part of maintaining weight loss so that the body does not become efficient at one workout.  I feel the Biggest Loser workouts have been able to do that with each new video.  I am very pleased with the video.,1231718400,,402,4.378378378378378
3618410,4,B001GP5TLS,"This is a great workout that can grow with you as your strength and stamina develop. This workout is probably too intense for the true beginner, but would provide an excellent workout for the advanced beginner to intermediate exerciser. There are 3 separate workouts (called Levels) that progress in difficulty. Level 1 lasts 20 minutes and consists of an interval workout that mixes cardio with strength moves that work the upper and lower body simultaneously. Level 2 is 15 minutes and has more challenging moves such as squat thrusts, jumping pushups, tricep dips with a leg lifts and one-arm pushups. This section has some high impact moves, so be prepared to jump. Fortunately, Heba and Vicky show low impact versions, so you don't ever have to jump if you don't want to. Finally, Level 3 is 10 minutes and focuses on strength moves to really exhaust the muscles and add definition. A warm-up and cool-down are included. The stretching section is excellent. Bob doesn't really do the moves, but he coaches and helps the contestants maintain proper form.

You can customize your workout by selecting which levels you want to do and the order you want to do them at the beginning of you workout. You can do each level once, more than once or not at all. Or you can choose the Maximum Results program which has preset selections based on how many weeks you've been doing the program.

Equipment Needed: Hand Weights, Resistance Band, Medicine Ball (however the band and ball are optional and the moves are also shown without them)

Things That Could Be Improved: My only complaint is that sometimes the contestants performing the workout don't always demonstrate the best form, and will sometimes randomly do their own thing. Your best bet is to follow Allie if you want to do the move correctly. Heba shows modifications to make the workout easier if you are just starting out. The moves are simple and easy to follow, so you can do this workout even if you aren't super coordinated.

Overall: This is a great workout that will really improve your fitness level and help to build strength and agility. It uses proven techniques such as interval training and plyometrics, and Bob is a motivating instructor. This is how they really workout on the ranch.  Enjoy and hope you get great results!",1231545600,,2294,4.812182741116751
3618411,3,B001GP5TLS,This wasn't the best dvd put out there by Bob. I've tried all the Biggest Loser dvds and this is my least favorite. I don't like the dark scenery and I don't think it pushed me hard enough. Bob is actually annoying this time around and so is that cheesy grin on Ally's face. Im tired of staring at her already but he keeps drawing attention to her...UGH! Its still a decent workout but its almost like he is running out of ideas. Dont spend over 10 bucks for this. The other Biggest Loser dvds are a lot more challenging and worthwhile!,1231372800,,536,4.264705882352941
3618412,4,B001GP5TLS,"I don't think any exercise video is perfect (thus 4 stars not 5) - but we all like variety and choices. I like Bob's style in teaching and talking on this video. Helpful and full of reminders. I LOVE how you can pick any/all of warmup, level1, level2, level3, cooldown and make your own session. PLUS I LOVE how you can just run the sessions MUSIC ONLY. This is great once you learn the moves and just want to focus on doing. I hate the ""chatter"" on many of these videos. I agree with others that some of the folks working out look bored but they are all different levels and just nice to have the variety for watching. The music is good for me. Good beat and while not ""songs"" but more ""movie soundtrack"" sounding, I find it great for the moves and motivation.",1231286400,,761,4.255172413793104
3618413,5,B001GP5TLS,"Ok, I have to admit that this dvd doesn't have excellent lighting or motivating music. But , if you're a fan of Bob's you won't be let down!! I agree with a couple of the other reviewers which make the point that this is about losing weight and taking care of your health!  You don't buy this dvd to be entertained or to see how cute the contestants get with thier trainer.  I do agree that both Heba and Vicky should've been excluded from this dvd because they just don't try hard enough and you just have to ignore them just as you ignored their childish outbursts on The Biggest Loser!!! This dvd is about you and Bob and this workout makes you sweat and feel it the next day! I got this dvd as a gift and was so happy when I tried it out! I rotate this one with Cardio Max and Power Sculpt. It's a total of 55 minutes long.  I do the whole dvd but you can do the different levels on it if you're just starting out.  And for those complaining of too many lunges and moves that hurt your knees, stop whinning and reduce the weights you use. Don't use 10 lb. weights with the lunges, use 5 lbs. instead and your knees will be fine.",1230681600,,1132,4.085585585585585
3618434,4,B001GP5TLS,I just tried this dvd today for the first time and OMG I was about to die.  I consider myself in moderately good shape but today I felt like I was out of shape doing this workout.  I had to pause the tape a few times to catch my breath!  I do agree with some of the other reviews in that Heba looks like she is being forced to be there and she only gives half effort and Allie does look like a show off.  Although I do give her props for being able to finish the reps when I couldn't.  I rated this one 4 stars because it is challenging but I thought it could've been a little better.  I get just as good of a workout with Jillian's 30 day shred and I can actually finish the first and second steps of hers.,1230422400,,707,3.8413793103448275
3618435,5,B001GP5TLS,"I not only own the other Biggest Loser dvds, but do my daily workout from a selection of about 100 dvds. Still, this was a ""must have"" to add to my collection...as that was my first thought after doing it.

I've always found Bob to be one of the best motivators. He doesn't just do a move that you follow and move on, he shows you as a coach how to do it correctly so that you gain maximum benefit from it.
This dvd is both cardio and sculpting and this creates maximum fat burning...you'll burn lots of calories during the cardio portions, then the sculpting will help you increase muscle mass which, thereby, increases your metabolism and burns even more calories even while you are at rest.

Even if you own the other Biggest Loser workouts, this one adds new moves, new people, more variety and great results.

I typically rotate all my workouts so that I have constant variety from my collection but I found myself continually going back to this dvd time and again and back to back.

Therefor, it needed to recieve some accolades via Amazon...Bob succeeded once again with a ""must have"" workout that all can do!

And, on that note, it should be noted whether you workout daily like myself or you are just beginning, he has moves for either class of fitness persona. You can follow along with the easy program, or go full steam once you improve...either way, the moves are easy to follow and produce rapid results.",1230422400,,1418,4.5234375
3618436,3,B001GP5TLS,"I have Jillian Michaels 30 Day shred and Cardio Max and I enjoy them both.  However after using them for 3 months I was getting bored.  I saw this DVD in the store and picked it up for 10.00 I did the warm up and levels 1 and 2 and I did work up a great sweat, but there is a lot knee bends, lunges, etc....and I have bad knees so I just have to modify those a bit, but it's annoying as I want to be able to do it all.  Also....Allie is a total pet and watching her gets on my nerves, but I just try to ignore her....although Bob always points her out ....urgh!  It's still an okay DVD for your money....just watch the knees.",1230336000,,625,3.859375
3618437,4,B001GP5TLS,"Okay, first of all this DVD is a fully functioning workout for all levels.  There are three levels--Level 1/20 minutes, Level 2/15 minutes, Level 3/10 minutes--with Bob teaching all levels. When I workout with levels 1 & 2 I use ankle weights and heavier dumbells/Level 3 uses bands or dumbells. I generally like the effectiveness of this series because I do sweat  and see results, but this one left me with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.
It is customizable as stated on the box, but you can only pick 5 workouts total.  So you can workout for a full 60 minutes, but you'll need to warm-up and cool-down on your own (which is what I do) or do the Level 1 3 times in a row.
Although Bob gives great instructions for the workouts (basic lunges, rows, wide steps, kicks, punches, etc.) he ignores the beat of the music and that is hard for someone who likes to use the music to stay motivated and a workout on the beat.
Also, it seems a bit down really.  I received mine the day of the BL winner annoucement and I thought the participants on the DVD already knew they hadn't won.  Poor Heba looked like she had lost her best friend.  During some sections Bob's comments seemed almost sarcastic and not humorous.  He used to say ""snappy"" things with a smile and they were funny, now they seemed fake.
I did like the workout, which is why I bought the DVD, and I'll ignore the parts I don't like, but this will be at the back of my rotation for morning exercise.  1/2 star of for music and inspiration and 1/2 star off for DVD participants and lack of total customization.",1229817600,,1571,4.319727891156463

The music is disappointing and does not make anyone want to get up and move.  It's nice to see familiar faces from season six, but they barely say anything, I would like more interaction.  Heba looks miserable to be there and Allie is like Bob's class pet.  I much prefer Jillian's 30 Day Shred.  It's a much more professional quality.",1229558400,,478,4.375

I noticed my stomach start to shrink (which is huge after a c-section!). When I sweat I know its working.

I haven't made it past the first level, it's intense, with very few pauses for you to catch your breath. As a beginner when it comes to exercising, I find the cool down almost as hard as the workout. It's definitely something I'll be building up to. My one major criticism is that the instructions aren't as good as the yoga DVD. I was expecting more direction, as in, what muscles are supposed to be ""feeling the burn"" so to speak--more on what the form was supposed to feel and look like. It's a faster pace, and the moves aren't held as long as they are in yoga, so I suppose that's the reason for less directions. I'll stick with it, but it's not as good as the other one.",1501372800,,803,4.153846153846154
