6958366,5,B00S433TKS,"I watched this film on a festival in Andorra and it was a great discovery. The acting is superb and the script is wonderfully written, I don't like to talk about the plot because it's always better to discover by yourself. If you love ""cinema noir"" it won't disappoint you. It was an awesome experience and when you finish the film you'll be in your seat thinking how great everything in it is. A really great film!",1428278400,2,415,4.402597402597403
6958367,5,B00S433TKS,"I nearly didn't watch this film as I knew nothing about it but went with a friend - glad I did because it was great. It's the kind of film that grips you from the start - the idea isn't to know who did what but HOW and WHY - part of the reason I love Columbo so much too. The film has a real 'classic' feel and a lovely British style mixed with the clear Hitchcock influences (which it doesn't hide and only adds to the fun of the film)

It's so good to know that people are still making films like this and we don't all have to watch The Fast and The Furious 7 type clones etc. You'll want to watch it again and again (although I haven't had the chance to yet!) knowing what's going to happen as it's a joy to see everything unfold.",1427932800,6,733,3.9194630872483223

6958369,4,B00S433TKS,"This is a first of many things. This is my first review for a film festival film, at its first screening at the first Aberdeen Film Festival. However, for all these firsts, this movie is not new.

By which I mean this is a very traditional thriller story surrounding a civilised game night which becomes a little less civilised as certain things begin to be revealed.

A true testament to good old fashioned filmmaking. This is a film which works its way out like a play. The acting is theatrical and purposely OTT and the use of more than one camera simultaneously allowed intercutting on some of the soliloquys work seamlessly.
The film looks terrific. Every shot feels as if it has a purpose within the story.

It will soon become a clich amongst critics, to call this film Hitchcockian, a phrase used so often these days that sometimes loses its meaning in my opinion.

There are two things which reminded me of the great master of suspense. The first is the opening title sequence, designed by the Director (though he gave credit to someone else out of humility), which uses animation to form a Cluedo board game, nodding to Psycho.

The second is the music, which is real, visceral and as violent as any of Film Noirs villains.

This film is not a classic as there is nothing groundbreaking in it, really. But it deserves recognition as a proper harking back to the good ol days.

Recommended Scenario: When you want to see what Dial M For Murder would look like in 2014s London.",1427155200,8,1485,4.581132075471698

6958371,5,B00S433TKS,"Great film, full of plot twists, and SUPER stylish!!! It has a real aesthetic to it.

I really enjoyed the Hitchcock-ian elegance to the film (including the Herrmann-esque score!)

Jack, portrayed cunningly by Andrew Fitch, is definitely not the type of person I'd have over for drinks lol!",1426896000,2,290,5.020833333333333
6958372,5,B00S433TKS,Great Hitchcockian murder mystery. Reminds me of many a rowdy night round the fireplace playing cluedo with my college pals! I particularly enjoy the Major. His monologue is a true highlight of the piece. Fitch brings great depth to the character of Jack and both Frank and Vera are played excellently. Fab cliffhanger and an all round romping good flick.,1426464000,2,355,4.933333333333334

6958374,4,B00S433TKS,"I saw this at a festival screening last year, and it's a really fun little film.

It's the kind of movie that works best when seen without really knowing anything about it, as the story unfolds with lots of twists and turns. But if you enjoy Hitchcock's more low-key one location films, such as Rope, Dial M for Murder, or even Lifeboat (to a lesser extent), this is definitely one worth checking out.",1426291200,5,401,4.493150684931507

6958377,2,B00S433TKS,"This film has that kind of stilted, oddly emphatic, overly dramatic feel that makes you think it was originally written as a play.  The dialog, and acting are all a little over the top, as if designed to fill a theater, but which comes across as too heavy and fake when exposed to the intimacy of the camera.

The basic plot involves the primary character (Jack I think his name was) inviting 4 friends over for a social evening, apparently to play the board game Clue.  He has other, more nefarious plans in mind, however.  I won't say more for fear of spoilers, but what I just said actually sounds more interesting than the film proved to be.  My main complaint is that there seemed to be no substantial motive for Jack's actions.  Competition with the Major?  Trying to show him up?  Whatever it was, it was incredibly weak, muddy, and unsatisfying.  I only watched it to the end in case there was some really clever pay-off finale, but there wasn't, so it made the entire thing virtually a waste of time.

The story seemed to depend on everybody ramping up to full extremis mode as quickly as possible to satisfy the plot, which stretched credibility too far for comfort or a sense of reality. Cannot recommend.",1523923200,7,1216,4.56221198156682

Thrillers that take place in one room with a group of people
Candlestick thinks it's way more clever than it is. The story is attractive on paper but isn't a classic unfortunately.
Other than the final twist, it's easy to see where the story's going after you learn the basic premise within the first 15 minutes or so.
I'm not sure why they needed to explain every action taken by the villain but I felt like I was the one beaten over the head with a Candlestick with the constant explanations.",1478304000,,609,4.304347826086956

There's some distractingly stagy acting going on here; I was really hoping that the first scene would turn out to be a play within the movie that the main characters were watching or performing in, but nope, I guess that's how the director wanted to do it, presumably in emulation of Hitchcock (the movie even has Saul Bass-style opening credits and a Bernard Herrmann-style score). Thing is though, Hitchcock had Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint and Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly to bring the sparkling if artificial dialogue to life, this just seemed forced. And, he was Hitchcock, so he had that going for him. And, minor quibble, but it really annoyed me when, at the beginning, the main character is supposed to be smoking a cigarette from a pack, then he's clearly shown smoking an e-cig; there's just something cheap about it, one of those minor details which, like the stilted acting, ruins the illusion a good drama should create.",1466035200,,1028,4.813559322033898

What botherd me the most is that I read comments comparing this to Hitchcock...and stating that the score ""holds a candle"" to Bernard Hermann's music is laughable. As a film composer myself, I appreciated the referencing of a hitchcock film in the opening graphics..but this is not original...when copying someone elses music or ideas.

6958448,5,B00S433TKS,"I was fortunate enough to attend the very first theatrical screening of Candlestick in the U.K. and it was pure magic. The film is well written, beautifully shot, with splendid performances all-round and great soundtrack  couldn't ask for more. All in all a thoroughly enjoyably film and well worth a look.",1451692800,,306,5.0
6958449,4,B00S433TKS,"Candlestick by it's name alone, instantly brings to mind the game of Clue along with an old-fashioned British murder mystery and the ultimate question of ""whodunnit?"" Although, in this film it's more about the unfolding twists and turns than a simple classic whodunnit.

No drafty old mansions for this movie, filmed on a one set location in the style that brings to mind some of Hitchcock's oldies but goodies -- this is a contemporary murder mystery beautifully filmed in a contemporary setting.

The cast is excellent, performing in the theatrical British style required -- while the film score is outstanding!!!  Writer/ Director Christopher Presswell and Co-  Writer Andres Forgacs have created an extremely impressive film on an Indie budget!!! Kudos indeed!!!",1446768000,,766,5.305785123966942
6958450,5,B00S433TKS,"Fantastic watch! My boyfriend went to the premiere and loved it so much he forced me to watch it and I'm so glad I did. Acting is superb, the storyline is brilliant and the music is utterly stunning. Very Hitchcock-esque from the beginning so if you're in to the murder mystery genre this is a ""Must-See"" film. Massive hats off to the Director, the quality of the shots were fantastic, some truly stunning scenes of London. Cant wait to see the next film of Mr Presswell's!",1441670400,2,473,4.511627906976744
6958451,5,B00S433TKS,"Candlestick, written and directed by Christopher Presswell and co-written by Andrs Forgcs, is, at first glance, a good old-fashioned British murder mystery, a classic game of cat and mouse. But as the plot unfolds it becomes so much more - an engaging contemporary thriller - a murder mystery within a murder mystery!

The plot is complex and yet the audience are never lost - we quickly deduce the motivations of Jack, one of five leading characters in the film, and learn to view the film's characters as pawns in his disturbing game. The acting throughout has a theatrical and stylised feel to it which, coupled with the sharp wit of the script and old-fashioned score written by Jonathon Armandary and performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, credits the film its dynamic pace. Christopher Presswell, in his use of one location, has proven that producing a brilliant film with a bold statement is not about its budget, but about its actors, its script and the talent employed.

A dynamic and engaging modern thriller with a magnificent plot-twist.",1437436800,4,1066,4.98314606741573

8697231,2,B00S433TKS,"This was like going to my son's high school and watching non-professionals act in a play.  The acting was sophomoric.  Very predictable.  Vera has the most fake, irritating laugh.  Frank looked like he was watching for cues and made some ridiculous over-gesturing as one would have to do for a stage play.  The best part is probably the last 2 minutes.",1533340800,,352,4.704918032786885

8697236,1,B00S433TKS,"This attempt at a film taught me two very valuable lessons.
1.) All British actors aren't as wonderful as Olivier, Dench or Smith.  Some (most of which appear in this film) stink on ice.
2.) Some film makers blatenly rip off Hitchcock openings with dreadful results and zero shame.

8697238,1,B00S433TKS,The actors must be stage actors who are failing at making to transition to the camera and screen.  They project their voices wayyyyyy too much.
