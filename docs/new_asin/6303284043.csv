629599,5,6303284043,"This workout is one tough tape! It is not for the beginning exerciser, although beginners could use it without weights and work their way up. I have had this tape for over 3 years, and it still makes me sore the day after I do it. The workout consists of some very tough lower body exercises (leg presses on tall box, lunges, squats, hover squats, dips, and more) that are sure to take the wiggle out of your thighs and make you sweat buckets at the same time. For this workout you will need a square-shaped 12, 14 or 17-inch step box, as this is required for completing the tall box leg presses, which comprise a large amount of the tape, and which really really work the glutes and hips effectively)....In my opinion (and in the opinoin of several others I have chatted with regarding Standing Legs) this is the toughest tape the Firm has ever created. Use it, and as the Firm states...you will see results within 10 workouts, guaranteed.",997747200,19,940,4.502923976608187

The video uses a tall box, free weights, and leg weights.  This video takes segments (the best if you ask me) from the other Firm Videos and rolls it into one. This video is challenging, but what a sweat!  You get a 5 minute warm-up, a cool down, and a stretching section as well. I highly recommend this video!",984700800,14,449,4.137931034482759

You not only need hand weights and the tall box(also  called a fanny lifter), but you will also need a mop and bucket to mop up  the sweat.  Take it easy when you first try this workout.  You may want to  do only one segment at first and eventually add segments until you are able  to do the whole tape.  Don't be discouraged!

629696,4,6303284043,"PROs

- Good workout for stronger legs.

CONs

- Too many squats and lunges so there's too much focus on the quads. I know squats and lunges are compound exercises and the leg muscles are being exercised, but the quads work extra hard here and there's such a thing as over-exercising.

- I think this would be more effective if combined with the lower body workout in Susan Harris's first video. That way, you'd be exercising the whole lower body, instead of really exhausting your quads.",1141689600,3,488,4.6395348837209305
629697,4,6303284043,"Need a lower body challenge?  This workout is for you.  It is a compilation ""parts"" video taken from the Firm Classics Volume 1-6.  It is all standing lower body work and will put you to the test.  You will need a tall box or stool and assorted dumbells.

All the tried and true lower body exercises are on this video, and plenty of them.  There are multiple sets of lunges, dips, squats, 6 sets of leg presses, rear leg extensions, leg abductions, and when you think you have had enough, there are a few sets of brutal hover squats at the end.  There is also some calf work, and a good amount of the exercises are compound movements, where you are working upper and lower body at the same time.  Such as lunges with deltoid raises and bicep curls, squats with overhead presses, etc.

The leg workout itself is 35 minutes, plus an 11 minute warm up and cool down.  Be sure to have your water handy, you are going to need it for this one.",1128211200,4,937,4.2727272727272725
629698,4,6303284043,"If I do this tape without any weights, i can get thru the entire tape, feel sore for the next day and see results.  If i use the weights i can only do 1/2 the tape, feel sore the next day and see results.  I try to switch it up, one week use weights, the next week no weights.  My legs are pretty thin and show muscle quickly which is fortunate for me.

This workout is relentless.  Squats, lunges, step ups, oh theres just SOOO many of them.  But the tape goes by quick.  Changing of instructors keeps you from getting bored. My only problem with this tape is NO inner thigh work. So i modify and do plie squats instead of squats on some of the circuits.

Try this tape.  it says results in 10 workouts.  say results in as little as 2 or 3 if combined with a good diet.",1114387200,6,770,4.006578947368421

The workout incorporates sections from different FIRM workouts that focus on the lower body.

Equipment needed:  High Step (12-14 inches) Heavy weights, Light Weights, Ankle Weights, barbell (I just use heavy weights b/c I don't have a barbell - the barbell is only used in a short section while doing squats).

The entire workout lasts for about 45 minutes.  There is  no abdominal section or floor work -- If you do not have any other workout tapes and are just starting your collection, you will need something with more cardio and with ab work.  This video is intended to sculpt the legs and [...].

It makes you very sore but in a GOOD way.  There isn't too much inner thigh work so i usually do my own to supplement this workout.  Lots of lunges, squats, and tall box work.

629722,3,6303284043,"A couple of months ago I purchased my first Firm videos - a set of 3 tapes (Cardio Sculpt, Body Sculpt & Ab Sculpt).  Having been very impressed with these three, I decided to purchase more Firm videos to add to my library in order to vary my routine even more.  Seeing that this video received such rave reviews, I decided to buy it.  I'm not crazy about the format of the video. It seems rather disjointed and the exercises don't have the same smooth transition from one to the next, as they do in the Cardio/Body/Ab Scuplt videos.  Given that the video is called ""Standing Legs,"" I was hoping that legs would be THE focus, but there are certain exercises that incorporate upper body movements, as well as the legs.  Personally, I prefer to work one area of the body at a time.  There are particular exercises where the repetions are done so quickly (due to the upper body movements thrown in) that it's difficult to maintain proper form. I would prefer to focus on proper execution of leg work, rather than cram upper body work into the sets.
I did find the leg press and squat routines to be beneficial, which is why I gave this video 3 stars.  But there are several portions of the video that could be improved, as noted above.",1047427200,7,1232,4.424778761061947

I like the idea of doing lunges and squats to strengthen (and shape) the lower body rather than the typical ""gym"" weight machines.  This video gives you a big workout!!!  What I like most of all is that it starts slow so your knees get a chance to warm up then progressively gets more intense.",1044316800,2,502,4.434782608695652

But what you get is a fantastic toning workout.  I used this video a lot before I recently began marathon training, and I am so glad I got my legs in better shape before I started running!  It's also helped me in all my other fitness endeavors, like yoga and tae bo.

I am in reasonably good shape; have been working out religiously for over a year and can run a good 8 minute mile, but I can't get through this one without having every muscle in my legs begging for mercy.  Usually, I am feeling it the next day.  Most video workouts are not able to work my muscles to failure without my adding extra weight or extra reps.  I can do this one without weight and reach that point.  A warning, start slow at first, especially if you're not a regular exerciser.  Used once a week or so in addition to a good cardio program and other workouts; I also recommend Super Sculpting by the Firm and the Gilad Quick Fit series, you will see the difference!",1029456000,12,736,4.297101449275362

After maybe five times doing the 42 minute workout, I could tell my buns and upper thighs were getting tight and the front of my legs were getting defined.  Say goodbye cellulite.  The video is different than any other lower body workout I have ever done.  The only equiptment you need is a ""step up box"" (i just got a step stool for $6 at the grocery store) and a light and heavy set of weights.  I suggest 3 and 5 lbs. to start.  There is some upper body mixed in with the lower body work, so if you are like me and your number one concern is your butt and thighs, this workout has the bonus of the upper mixed in.  Don't worry, you never stop moving your legs/butt.  No wastes of time in this video!1!",1027209600,28,849,4.066265060240964

A word of caution to any beginners or even seasoned exercisers who are not use to The Firm style, start off slow. This tape is not enjoyable at all, it is about pain, pain, and more pain. If you can survive the last segment of the hover squats god bless you. I believe this tape will get just about most legs into great shape. I rotate this tape on a weekly basis with another leg tape and rollerskating to break up the routine. Very nice results.
Also, if you want good music, this workout is not for you. This is the classic Firm tapes from mid-1980's until 1992. The music is cheesy, but video quality and scenery great. Exceptional workout!",1026777600,4,893,4.321428571428571

The last part of this tape is super, duper, tough.
Try lighter weights at first, and as you get stronger add on more weight.  IF you really want to get in shape fast, don't be afraid of the ""TALL BOX"".  A Short box doesn't make it challenging.  It's a great workout which also includes some upper body workout.  I consider this a good total body workout, burns lots of fat.

Begins with warmup from firm vol 2, stretch from vol 6, (about 7 mins) then onto the workout itself for 35 minutes. Be prepare for the hover squats from vol 6 :D it is a killer...
the only problem in this workout is you don't get enough inner thigh work and you have to keep putting on and off the ankle weight! there is a little bit upper body work using dumbells in this tape but sometimes I just eliminate the dumbells and concentrate on the lower body work.

It WILL firm your butt and hips and make everyday movements much more effortless. The only qualm about these Firm tapes is that what they tell you to do (""Place your LEFT leg on the box...."") is often opposite of what they really are doing on the tape, so you have to pay attention and either do what they SAY or do what they DO.
