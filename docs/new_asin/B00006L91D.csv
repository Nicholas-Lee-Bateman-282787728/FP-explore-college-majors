7970978,4,B00006L91D,"This movie has to be one of the whackiest movies on the list with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  If you like to go to the dentist, and who doesn't, I recommend you make an appointment to see this movie.  The funny man Steve Martin has a few hilarious parts where in one he runs around with a giant molar.  Well, don't want to give away the plot because it sneaks up on you without notice and before you know it your teeth are pulled without a little bit of Novocaine.",1195257600,,469,4.076086956521739
