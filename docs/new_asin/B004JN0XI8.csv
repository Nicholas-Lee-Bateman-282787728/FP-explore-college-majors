The Refugee Resource Center's goal is to compile a list of refugee related media (books, music, film, etc...) and present it to the world as a curriculum to aid in training those that are interested in working with refugees.

This particular documentary already has some reviews on Amazon, but in reading them, we feel some things in those reviews ought to be addressed.

Regarding the misrepresentation of Buffalo, New York:  All documentaries that we've seen of refugee life here in the United States feature neighborhoods like this one.  Of course Buffalo, New York is not completely this way.  Of course there are beautiful areas in Buffalo... but the neighborhood we see portrayed in this film transcends Buffalo.  If you go to any major city that has a large refugee community, with few exceptions, they're going to be in neighborhoods that look like the ones in this film.

Regarding the coaching of the folks on film: When you speak with people for whom English is not their primary language, their ideas and speech can jump around and be difficult to follow.  Had the film maker not kept them on subject, i'm sure this documentary would be extremely hard to follow.

Regarding Smiler Greely coaxing people saying ""come on, you can tell me."":  For us to explain the Karen people would take thousands of pages here, so here's the quick version:  The Karen people have been persecuted for approximately 64 years by the Burmese government.  After 64 years of absolutely injustice, they have developed a new attitude towards life.  ""if something good happens, wonderful.  if something bad happens, keep your mouth shut and try to survive it.""  In this documentary, when Smiler is talking with newly arrived refugees, he's telling them ""come on, you can tell me"" because they don't know that in America, they can complain about leaky ceilings, no electricity, unfair landlords, etc...

Regarding the coincidental placement of a knife:  We as Americans view the presence of a knife as a violent thing, and too often, that's true.  If you look at this from the refugee's eyes though, it's much less of a big deal.  Nearly every time we go to a refugee's home, they're cooking something.  Try to get out of a refugee's home without being fed... we dare you!  Sometimes they cook on their oven, and sometimes they cook behind or on the side of their apartment/house.  If you go to a refugee neighborhood during the summer, you're going to see groups of refugees, sitting around small Coleman grills, cooking ribs, chicken, etc...  Refugees are given what they're given when they arrive.  They don't have 12 matching place sets and all of the standard utensils of the kitchen.  If we had to guess why that knife was there in the alley, it's that someone cooked there recently, and instead of tongs, they used a knife to stab and flip the cooking food.  When they went in that night with their plates of food, the grill, their chairs, etc... the knife was left.

In summation: We found this film to be wonderful, touching and informative.  We'd love to say that the things in this film are not real, that life isn't that difficult for refugees, but unfortunately it's 100% accurate.  The one fault we found with the film was that it didn't really give a ""where do we go from here"" summation, however if you go to the film's website, you can find that there (which in a way is pretty smart because ""where we go from here"" today may be completely different than ""where we go from here"" in 10 years.)

Nickel City Smiler is definitely worth your time, especially if you want to focus on Karen refugees.",1374969600,3,3679,4.728414442700157
8737633,1,B004JN0XI8,"Not sure what i expected, but this film smacks of exploitation and hidden agenda. Buffalo is certainly not as bad as this film makes it out to be. there were scenes where the children were obviously coached to say things and where the ""star"" was appeared to laud his role as community leader, by egging on other people in the film: ""come on you can tell me""...at several points people in the streets were asking about the purpose of the film, and didn't receive a straight answer, perhaps b/c they too would be shown later in the film in an unflattering light. and a true doc would show 2 sides to every story..not this one. definitely an agenda here. and come on are we really supposed to beleive all these things happened (crime, brick through window..kids just happen to find a knife) when filming is happening!!!  and what an odd relationship between ""star"" and his boss? Don't wast your money! there are other ""real"" docs or videos clips about refugees and buffalo - find them on youtube",1307836800,,992,4.604519774011299
8737634,2,B004JN0XI8,"The films leaves me wondering who I am supposed to be upset with.  I am not really sure what the point of the film was.  There were moments that made me smile and others where I wondered how balanced the makers were being.  I've been to Buffalo, having gone to school there,  and I know there is a lot more to the city then what the film shows. The film seems to look for the worst of the city and depicts it as only that.  I also don't appreciate places were it seems the film makers are egging on the children to say things.
As for the refugee story, I found the main characters dedication to helping his people charming.  I think the message of carrying on to make it better for the next generation is the message of all immigrants that have come to this country.
Overall, I probably would not have bought the film had I seen it first.",1302998400,,838,4.173913043478261
