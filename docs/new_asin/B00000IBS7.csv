1221437,4,B00000IBS7,"Winner of the 1965 Oscar for Best Actress, the beautiful and pouty lipped Julie Christie gives a glowing performance as an amoral cover girl, Diana Scott, in the swinging '60s in London.

Diana, who is married, is having an affair with a married television correspondent, Robert Gold, played to perfection by the sexy and world weary, Dirk Bogarde. Eventually, they leave their respective mates and set up house together in swinging London. All is not hunky dory for long, as Julie goes on to have an affair with her agent, Miles, divinely played by Laurence Harvey. When Robert discovers her lies and infidelity, he leaves her.

Diana goes on to party hearty, and she ultimately meets a wealthy and widowed, Italian prince while on location in Italy shooting a commercial. After a perfunctory meeting, she meets up with him again, and he proposes. She thinks about his proposal, and ultimately consents to becoming Princess Diana.

Only after marrying him, a virtual stranger to her, does she realize how lonely she is. She finds herself being left in their palazzo with his seven children, while the prince is away, ostensibly visiting his mother without her. She realizes that she is living in a gilded cage, no more than a trophy wife.

She impulsively contacts Robert and flies to England to meet with him. After they make love, she realizes how much she loved him, and declares her feelings for him, only to be rebuffed. He then sends her packing, back to her empty life in Italy. Yet, he does so at great emotional cost to himself, as well.

This film is very representative of the swinging sixties and conveys a real sense of the joie de vivre of the period. It deals with subjects that were formerly taboo. There are subtle and sly references to homosexuality. Abortion and a woman's sexuality are issues in the film and dealt with in a way with which these issues were not ordinarily dealt. While it may seem tame by today's standards, this was very cutting edge in its time, and reflective of some of the changes which society, as a whole, was undergoing. This movie is definitely an oldie but a goodie.",1023494400,42,2114,4.733695652173913
1221438,4,B00000IBS7,what a great film. julie christie gives a sexy swinging sixties performance worthy of her oscar. the scenes in capri are a must for anyone interested in 'la dolce vita' of the 1960's.....,1005436800,,187,4.696969696969697
1221439,5,B00000IBS7,"Darling is like nothing you would see today, this is largely due to its maturity. It is a 'grown-up' film made by adults, about adults for an adult audience.
It is the tale of a very good looking young woman who rides with the wave that her good looks take her on.
Diana Scott (Christie) starts out a care-free young thing, swinging along the streets of mid-sixties London when she is stopped by a reporter and asked if she'd like to make a comment about 'today's youth' for a magazine TV programme. She is so flattered that she falls for the reporter who swiftly leaves his wife for her.
But after a while Julie gets bored and wants to expeience more of what this brave new sixties world has to offer & we the audience travel along with her for the journey...from model to film star to finally capturing the eye of an Italian prince who marries her. She becomes Princess Diana trapped in a palace with only her misery for company.
Julie Christie's character is supposed to be an immoral girl but you can't help but like her. Watching this film is like going on a journey through someone else's life to such a degree that you will forget your own after a while as you follow her around from Paris to Italy,through her various flings,friendships & encounters. No special effects here,Darling is about people. People living in the 'contemporary' world.
The film has dated 'terribly'...that's part of its fascination. It's a mid-sixties time capsule. If you are a fan of or are at all interested in 'sixties London buy this with confidence. It is a privilege to be  be able to recommend it to you.
Darling is a witty film. Intelligently made. Superbly shot & edited. I would recommend it to anyone who is studying film, so fluently & deftly is this masterpiece put together.
Filmed in Black & White...not only does Julie Christie look stunning but she rises to every note. She well deserved her Oscar for best actress in 1966.
This is a movie that would interest & entertain even the people who usually would not be drawn to  this kind of a theme.
Highly recommended!",1002844800,6,2064,4.575675675675676

This film is a prime example of how a movie can reflects its time, even if by today's standard we have becomed so accustumed to cynicism in movies that it seems it doesn't reach us anymore. In 1965 ,this tone was something new. JULIE then starred in other movies like DOCTOR ZHIVAGO,FAHRENHEIT 451,FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD AND PETULIA ,easily one of the strangest movie of the sixties.

All about a princess named Diana, in search of herself in ""Swinging London"". Ms. Christie never makes a false move (rumored to be based on Grace Kelly & offered to Shirley Maclaine) and she is the beautiful orbit that this film revolves around.

Her lifestyle results in an abortion, lost hopes, and finally, disillusionment,  as she finally reaches her long desired zenith in society. Once she does  she clearly sees how empty her life really is. Christie won the Oscar for  Best Actress for this film (1965) and it also won Oscars for Best  Screenplay and Best Costume Design, for the dresses and mini-skirts she  wears in the film set off a fashion trend for the late 60's. It was also a  Best Picture nominee. Not rated at the time, but would come under a PG-13  rating by today's standards.

1221447,5,B00000IBS7,"This marvelous movie reflects as just a few the social ambiance of U.K. Those were times of disturbing times, of political uncertainess and convulse social adjustments.

Julie Christie plays Scott a model who just has a goal: to achieve the pinnacle of the social corpus, climbing bed by bed. Inspired by Fellini's La Dolce Vita, Bunuel's The Exterminator Angel and Godard's aesthetics, Christie breaks the rules, but the social enviroment is ruled by the laws of non conventional social procedures.

The film runs along several layers. And so Christie develops around each one of his lovers a different protrait. She looks ravishing and stunning thoughout the film.

A legendary movie, icon of the sixties. Watch it without hesitation. You'll be rewarded!!!",1452038400,,758,5.24793388429752

1221451,5,B00000IBS7,"Some five decades ago, as a teen, I was disappointed the charming Julie Andrews lost out for her 2nd straight Oscar to another Julie I had never heard of - in a movie I knew nothing about.  Having finally just watched DARLING, now I get it - both her acting skills and the movie itself.

It is set a bit before the true swinging 60s, but this detracts little.  Christie is in virtually every scene and dazzles the viewer.  We see her evolve and become vastly more complex than the young woman early in the film sleeping her way up society.  Men's lust for her comes so easily that she is unable to distinguish her emotions, until too late.

The men are excellent, especially Dirk Bogarde as Robert.  He is alternatively drawn and repulsed by Diana.  The more wily Miles, also superbly played by suave Lawrence Harvey, has less attachment to Diana, but his entry into her life changes all for her. The actual husband, late in the film, a minor Italian Prince, makes Diana feel how empty her life has been,  An excellent vintage movie-tone type news reel adds a special touch.  London is of course the main setting, but Paris and the Amalfi Coast add delightful backdrops.

Christie is far better in DARLING than in her better known Dr. Zhivago, also from 1965.

I am always enamoured by well made black and white films.  That adds much to draw in the viewer.  It barely makes the 5 stars I have chosen, but well worth a viewing or two, now 50 years after it came out.",1442188800,,1466,4.441947565543071

1221454,5,B00000IBS7,"Julie Christie is perfection as the self-absorbed model working her way to the top in this hip 60's film shot in London, England.
Her main love interest is a journalist, Robert Gold (Dirk Bogarde) deeply committed to his work and also a devoted husband and father. Their relationship begins when he happens to see her interviewed in one of those man on the street spots where they ask passers by their opinions on current events. Julie's character is Diana Scott, and from the moment she meets Robert, she is out to land him no matter what the cost.
He ends up smitten with her, and finally moves in with her only to be two-timed by this conniving opportunist. I mean, this gal can lie!  From there Diana meets Miles (played by Lawrence Harvey) whose money and position helps her network to a film producer that stars her in his horror flick (her character dies in the first 60 seconds!).  As all bad girls must have their ""comeuppance"", Diana does reach the pinnacle, but falls from grace in her mini-skirt and Go-go boots in the end.  Don't miss this one.

1221456,5,B00000IBS7,"DARLING is a witty and insightful 1965 movie set in the ""Swinging London"" of the era, also France and Italy, directed by John Schlesinger.  A pre-DOCTOR ZHIVAGO Julie Christie won a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar as the central character, a pretty but somewhat unscrupulous girl on a massive social climb, whose men (including Dirk Bogarde and Lawrence Harvey) don't realize the harm she has done them until it's too late, and who barely realizes what she's done to herself through the haze of journalistic cliches with which she speaks.  Schlesinger's use of the ""unreliable narrator"" contrasting Darling's voiced-over memoirs while portraying the reality, is brilliant, as is the ""mod"" characterization of London and its denizens.  Witty, on occasion excoriating, but well worth it even though it's a bit long at over two hours.  This is the kind of period piece that lends insight to the era without becoming truly dated.  The movie also snagged Oscars for best original screenplay and best costume design.  I'm sorry the DVD seems to have escalated in price lately, but whether you buy, steal or rent, DARLING is a great Sixties movie.  In black-and-white widescreen.",1431388800,,1173,5.1421052631578945

1221486,3,B00000IBS7,"'Darling' is a tightly told tale of a girl who, by dint of her looks, charm, and sexual affairs, climbs her way up the social ladder in the world of fashion, advertising and film, only to find herself trapped like a bird in a gilded cage. She also finds she cannot escape a sense of inner sadness, shown by her musing: ""You'd think it would be so easy to be happy, wouldn't you?""

I found the narrative flowed well, and yet the message of the film in unclear. It clearly shows one path on how NOT to attain happiness, but one wonders what other path the main character should have taken. Should she have stayed with her original husband, with whom she felt no excitement, or is Darling just a symptom of the time: with such a rapidly changing cultural landscape, people like Darling are at a loss as to how to find meaning. These are questions left open by the movie.

Still, it is worth seeing, and is indeed a fascinating artifact from 1960s London, just on the cusp of radical social change.",1373760000,3,994,4.396739130434782

1221489,3,B00000IBS7,"Darling, 1965 film

The story begins with the life of a young girl. At 20 Diana Scott is interviewed by a reporter and discovered. They look at abandoned houses near the water, then talk. Her husband studies Italian. A reporter interviews an old author, then becomes friendly with Diana. ""Have you done this before?"" Later this reporter interviews people for their opinions about current life. There is a meeting to raise money for a charity. There is gambling in this big mansion. Diana wins a pile of money at roulette. [Was there a brake?] Will Diana be selected as an actress in a murder mystery? Her boyfriend Miles gets a surprise. Diana visits a doctor. ""How'd you feel?"" ""Poor little thing."" We see a little boy play with a toy pistol. There is a dinner party. Diana is good with children. A married couple talk in bed. Diana returns to London. She attends an audition, then leaves to meet her boyfriend.

Diana's car is towed for overtime parking. They visit Paris and meet sophisticated friends (trs riche). [Does wealth cause corruption?] We see the circles where Diana circulates. They smoke, laugh, and undress. Their conversation reveals their characters. There is personal conflict between Diana and Miles. [No surprise?] Diana, wearing a towel, poses for photographs. Will she be discovered as a model? Who is ""The Happiness Girl""? She goes shopping and takes a discount. A letter brings news from her husband. Diana does the usual ""beauty queen"" work pushing products like chocolate. She meets a descendant of a Pope, and makes new friends. She goes to a church. [Note the benches.] Her boyfriend goes out at night (to reveal his character). A boat docks on the river, an aristocrat desires her. Diana also goes out at night. She makes a decision.

Diana is now back in London. There is another party in an apartment. Couples pair off. Things don't go well. Miles disappoints her, but stays. ""Its late."" ""Life is full of `if only'."" She attends a funeral. She talks to a newspaper reporter (and shows her skill in conversation). She finds religion and a new husband. A new princess. Charity work to help the less fortunate. [Irony?] ""Are you all right, my Darling?"" [Is her new life more empty now?] She drives alone, her husband is unavailable at night. Her loneliness affects her. She returns to Britain and meets Robert. Is it too late? ""This is just for old times sake."" Who is using who? Robert drives Diana to the airport. Is she as happy as anyone can be?

This movie was different from the others of that era. It revealed the emptiness (and phoniness) of people who worked in the advertising racket. Advertising is used to deceive the unwary public and create ""peer pressure"" from the messages it delivers. Avoiding advertising is always good, but ""product placement"" also carries a message. [Some of Erle Stanley Gardner's novels warned against the beauty contest racket of that era where young girls would be lured into advertising.]",1331596800,3,2960,4.8438735177865615

1221504,5,B00000IBS7,"The swinging 60's gets a moral awakening in John Schlesinger's 1965 gem `Darling'.  With rich character development and a stunningly provocative demeanor, `Darling' barrels through to the very end with such charisma (of the shockingly endearing kind) that one cannot help but become completely engulfed in its prose.

Julie Christie (in her Oscar winning role) plays young and determined model Diana Scott who falls in and out of one failed relationship after another in her struggle to `make it'.  She leaves her young and immature husband for an older gentleman, Robert (who happens to be married himself), but life lessons leave her feeling overwhelmed to the point where she falls into an affair with a suave film director named Miles.  When that relationship seems trying she swears off men and holes up with her friend Malcolm (who happens to prefer the company of men himself) where she meets the wealthy Italian Prince Cesare della Romita and contemplates becoming a Princess.

The film reminded me somewhat of Fellini's masterpiece `La Dolce Vita', especially the French party scene, which seemed an obvious influence, but this film is far from a copy cat.  It delves into similar themes (such as the demoralization of high society) but it does so with a unique vision all its own.

They are definite companion pieces, and I recommend watching them both as a pair.

What I admire so much about `Darling' is that it is truly a fearless film.  While still tame according to today's standards (if you can call them that) it is really intriguing to see all that they present in this film without any hesitation.  The performances are truly lived in and completely felt by the audience, and the script is stunningly deep despite never truly going anywhere out of the norm.  What I mean by that is that there isn't a whole lot that happens in `Darling' outside of Diana's relationships, but the way in which each relationship is explored and developed takes us to a place deep within Diana herself.  The film also beautifully contrasts Diana's outward and inward personas, giving us a woman who is perceived by many to be happy (one of her campaigns is the `happy girl') but who is traumatically unhappy with her lot in life.

This all comes to a head at the films rapturous conclusion when Diana (literally) strips herself of everything and shatters before us.  Everything she has worked so hard to secure has proven itself to be the (figurative) death of her.

So, let's talk about the acting (always a favorite subject of mine).  There have been many words spoken about Christie winning the Oscar over Julie Andrews (I even read an absurd comment on IMDB by someone who hasn't even SEEN this movie yet claims that the Academy must be blind because there is no way that Christie could possibly be better than Andrews).  I'll say this; neither actress should have won that year since the best performance by an actress in a leading role was Anna Karina, who was flawlessly engaging in `Pierrot le Fou'.  That said, both Andrews and Christie were wonderful, but I wholly back up Christie's win.  She tapped into something so sincere and so raw.  The way that Christie balances her characters emotional conflicts is just flawlessly done.  That final scene with Bogarde is just mesmerizing painful.  Much has been said about Bogarde and Harvey.  I don't know what else to say.  They were both phenomenal, and Bogarde may even win my personal Best Actor award that year (that stunning sidewalk confrontation with Christie alone is worthy of an award), but I feel compelled to ignore them altogether and focus on someone who doesn't get mentioned too often.

Roland Curram.

Roland plays Malcolm, Diana's flirtatiously dominate friend.  He has but a few scenes, but they are ridiculously layered and very memorable.  Every facial expression he throws her way allows us to scrutinize her as honestly as a friend without judging her, as he so obviously does not.  He threw himself into the role with an effortless charisma that drew me to him.

In the end, I just have to say that `Darling' is a sublime film.  It is ultimately a stirring and somewhat depressing look at the emptiness of aspirations, but it is remarkably handled on all fronts, and its blatant honesty and fearless embracing of the culturally taboo make this film an absolute treasure.",1265673600,9,4349,4.860244233378562
1221505,4,B00000IBS7,"Diana Scott (Julie Christie) has just made the cover of ""Ideal Woman"" magazine.  In a flashback, she recalls her rise to fame and fortune, beginning as a 20-year old would-be model in swinging-sixties London.  She was beautiful, hip, and full of life, gliding easily through love affairs and joining the ranks of the upper class.

Christie was so young and beautiful in this movie!  Even with the black and white photography, she's luminous, dynamic, and, yes, darling.  In her Oscar-winning role, she climbs the social ladder using Dirk Bogarde and Lawrence Harvey as two of her stepping stones; they're both excellent.

The movie is such a product of it's time (1965) and puts so much emphasis on her trendy wardrobe that it seemed a bit dated to me.  Also, there were a few scenes when I thought she hammed it up too much, but still I enjoyed her and the movie and recommend it.",1261785600,,881,4.681818181818182
1221506,5,B00000IBS7,"When I was a teenager in New York, I happened to flip the channel and came upon this movie, which I observed for no more than ten minutes. It left an indelible impression on me, but not because of the witty dialogue or well-crafted cinematography. It was Julie Christie who drew me in, and many years later on my first viewing of the complete film, it is Christie who continues to beckon me, but not just with her beauty.

Handing an up-and-coming star so much screen time (or shall we call it ""face time"") as director Schlesinger did in ""Darling"" can be a risky proposition, but it pays off handsomely here. Christie truly deserved her Oscar for this emotionally wide-ranging, nicely nuanced performance of a narcissistic social climber in the ""Swinging Sixties."" She's adroitly paired with Dirk Bogarde to create an ""owl and pussycat"" story line, and Laurence Harvey is brought in as a manipulative, sexually ambiguous poseur who shows ""Diana"" the darker side of success. (Harvey's selection was somewhat ironic given his own ""climb the ladder"" character in ""Room at the Top."")

""Darling"" offers a true-to-life window into the growing glitterati subculture that was starting to flower after the Fifties. Most of the main characters make their living through the creation of images (a model, television personality, photographer, advertising man and revered writer), and Diana learns how to use her assets in this milieu most effectively. For all her conquests, all her connections, and all her globetrotting, the broadest, most genuine smiles come across her face when she is ""in the moment"" with her gay photographer friend or children - individuals who do not threaten to shatter her glass-like personality. Unfortunately, that apparent happiness is not to be sustained by the time the film ends.

Visually, ""Darling"" is a delight. The opening sequence, in which a poster on world hunger is papered over with a close-up of model Diana, effectively sets the stage for a steady string of sardonic observations by screenwriter Rafael, especially in the charity dinner and art gallery sequences. The episode in the Parisian salon comes off as a psychologically troubling mixture of Fellini freaks and the beach scene in ""Suddenly Last Summer"", and the cottage and verandah scene on the Italian Riviera is simply stunning. Director Schlesinger could easily have opted for color, but wisely chose black-and-white as befit the plot line and moral ambiguity of many of his characters.

About the only criticism one might make of this film is the too-obvious post-colonial moralizing about ""haves"" and ""have nots."" Other than that, ""Darling"" is much more than eye candy - a well acted, witty, and sometimes troubling look at a coterie of ""haves"" who grasp the railing on the merry-go-round hard, many times at personal cost.",1252108800,7,2819,5.095238095238095
1221507,5,B00000IBS7,"I've learned that same old lesson again:  Never assume.  I've always avoided this movie because I thought it was going to be a lot of 60's bands and old music and a lot of girls in mini skirts and straw-like bangs, looking like a documentary on the first wives of the Beatles.

Instead, it was interesting, thoughtful, contemplative - and gorgeously scored.

I particularly liked the way the filmmakers didn't spell out everything.  The movie rockets from a very brief scene from the Christie character's childhood, straight to her adulthood.  I liked how the filmmakers respected the audience's intelligence and time by alowing it to figure out how a woman like that gets to be a woman like that.  It makes for a more interactive theatrical experience.

Bogarde and Harvey bring that same inscrutible sexuality that they brought to other roles.  We know they want Christie only by the way she reacts to them, not by the way they behave.  Their pursuit of her isn't a chase - it's a stroll.

Christie's portrayal of a scrambling young woman doing the most with what little she has, embodies, I think, many young women - and this is what ultimately makes the movie heartbreaking.  I would compare her plight to that of a child who is very tall for his age.  People expect him to have the intelligence, vocabulary and maturity of an older child, and feel mystified and betrayed when the child fails to meet their expectations.",1235347200,7,1424,4.739837398373984

1221521,4,B00000IBS7,"""Darling"", the brittle mid-1960s cult classic, was written by Frederick Raphael (he won an Oscar for the script) and directed by John Schlesinger. Like a handful of other interesting black and white films from this era written by authors like Raphael and Alan Sillitoe, ""Darling"" has dated somewhat, although not in a way that devalues its superb qualities.  Think, for example, of ""Morgan!"", ""Georgy Girl"", and ""The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner"".  Although these are all very different films, each reflects something of Britain's mood during the early to mid-1960s as Britain questioned, particularly through the medium of theatre and film, issues of class loyalty, tradition, and values in a period of shifting social mores.

The film is most noteworthy for the excellence of the script and the performances of its two leads, Julie Christie and Dirk Bogarde.  Although Christie won a Best Actress Oscar for her role, in this reviewer's opinion, Dirk Bogarde's performance is even more memorable.  This is not to belittle Christie's fine work; however, Christie was the startling newcomer and naturally attracted more attention than the established Bogarde, whose work here is so good as to be ""invisible"".  It is easy to forget what a very, very, very fine actor Bogarde was until you revisit a film like this.  It is a long way from Sidney Carton in ""A Tale of Two Cities"" to Robert Gold in ""Darling"".

Christie plays Diana Scott, a beautiful but curiously blank woman who uses her looks to attach a series of increasingly prominent and wealthy men, in hopes that each successive relationship will finally help her achieve the solid identity she craves.  Christie portrays Diana as an empty canvas upon which she invites her lovers to paint, as she adapts herself, chameleon-like, to each one's values and tastes.  But Diana selects her lovers on the basis of their worldly assets, which cannot help her clarify her own identity, any more than those assets wholly define the identities of the men who hold them.  Diana never comes to understand this, and steps Gatsby-like over one man after another, evading responsibility for the emotional chaos she creates, yet never quite finding the one relationship that will make her feel real and complete.  In fact, Diana Scott rather reminds one of a later charismatic, British, blonde Diana, who also tried to anchor a narcissistic, internal vagueness through external relationships - with equally little success.

Bogarde plays Robert Gold, a TV journalist who meets the pretty housewife accidentally and gives her a start in modeling - he falls hopelessly in love with her and leaves his wife and children for her.  But, as Diana's career takes off, she begins to drift toward men who she believes have more to offer her than Robert does.  Robert soon grasps the empty narcissism that produces Diana's vague amorality, but cannot shake free of his feeling for her, with tragic consequences for himself.  Ironically, Robert is the one man in Diana's life who loves her for ""herself"" - the very ""self"" she is seeking in other places.  As Diana joins the restless 1960s jet-set, the film highlights the equally narcissistic, quickly jaded characters and tastes of its members.

Christie's look is also redolent of the era: the heavy eye-makeup, thick hair, jaunty mini-skirts, and Couregges boots, all have the peculiar effect of deadening, rather than enhancing her beauty, so perfectly iconic of the 1960s.

The black and white photography is by Ken Higgins, and the supporting cast includes the always fascinating Laurence Harvey as the cold, calculating Miles Brand, another of Diana's lovers.

This is an expertly crafted film, from script to direction to performances.  To say that it is ""dated"" is to use the term to express only its cultural specificity.  The anguish of its characters and the quality of its script ensure that its specificity does not dilute its broader relevance.

""Darling"" is a fine classic of the 1960s, containing marvellous performances by now-legendary actors - it is a film truly made for adults.",1209945600,14,4087,5.085329341317365

1221524,1,B00000IBS7,"This line, spoken by Julie Christie to Dirk Bogarde in ""Darling"" just about sums up my feelings towards this movie. Although I am halfway done with this movie I think this is one of the most boring films I have ever seen and I am stopping this movie when it gets to the scene where Christie looks at herself in the mirror as she removes her clothing. I am done with this movie (believe it or not) and it only got worse: Christie's character Diana Scott marries an Italian man who hello, is old enough to be father! And oh yes, he's an aging prince (in what had to be a ripoff of what happened to Grace Kelly and what would happen to Jacqueline Kennedy and the announcer in the newsreel that calls her ""Princess Diana"" almost made me laugh). That nearly made me grab a gun and shoot my TV (a la Elvis Presley) considering that this is the same setup that occurs in ""Georgy Girl"" and that is spoiled British girl living in Swinging England marries older man (Three words: Anna Nicole Smith). Also, I would like to know what are these reviewers smoking in saying that Christie deserved the Oscar for Best Actress? She didn't at all because it should (and I mean SHOULD) of gone to Julie Andrews for ""The Sound of Music"" (my pick for the best movie of the 1960's) because not only did she overtake her performance of ""Mary Poppins,"" for which she won the Oscar, she pulverized every performance by a female that year including Christie. And there's a problem with the Academy: They can't seem to pull the trigger in giving back-to-back Oscars to the same person.
 I'm not alone in this arugment: In Danny Perry's book ""Alternate Oscars"" he picks Andrews for Best Actress of 1965 and states that the reason why the AMPAS gave the Oscar to Christie was not because it was 'The British Invasion,' but they saw it as a way to give an Oscar to Christie's other film ""Doctor Zhivago"" which was T.S.O.M.'s rival and added to the fact that ""Zhivago"" had no acting nominations. There's another Oscar problem: They don't know when to be hip.
 Also, does it seem like Dirk Bogarde and Lawrence Harvey were the two worst actors in film history? Because it seems to me that every movie that I have seen with them are bad; weather it was this movie, or ""The Manchurian Candidate"" with Harvey, or ""Modesty Blaise"" with Bogarde.
 In conclusion, I think some moviegoers should change their mind about buying this movie because this has to be the worst performance ever to win an Oscar. Or as what Bogarde said to Christie: (a fitting way to close this review since that I end where it begins) ""I don't take taxis that are filled with whores!""",1161734400,10,2621,4.490566037735849

1221529,5,B00000IBS7,"Most of the other reviews printed here I am in agreement with.  There is little I need to add except that I saw the film for the first time in the eighties when it came out on tape.  I just rewatched it and still find my gut reaction to be the same and then some.  Schlesinger's work, the three leads and the marvelous script make for an engrossing, sobering and disturbing treatise on how so many people lack values and seek ""happiness"" in all of the wrong places -- especially in the wrong people.  After the twenty-odd years of first viewing this film, I realized tonight how strong Julie Christie's performance is in this film.  There is not one hole in this bravura performance.  It's odd to make this statement, especially since she's playing such a shallow role.  It's not an easy nor a desirable part to play, but she carries it off as if she herself were the character.  Selfishness is at the core of the character as well as immaturity, and she stoops and conquers.

Laurence Harvey has never played the rogue better and Dirk Bogarde is perfect as the jilted lover who indeed possesses a heart, but nevertheless gives in (but not completely) to Ms. Christie's empty needs.  He, indeed, sees through her throughout most of the film but cannot help being swayed by her charms.

Emptiness served up brilliantly.  And we must respect the talents involved for providing us with a lesson -- as well as thank them (on two levels at least: talent coupled with making us examine what should really be of value to us).",1121385600,7,1518,4.560885608856089

1221547,5,B00000IBS7,"This is a truly modern story of the kind of alienation and corruption that eats at the heart of modern life and relationships.  Darling is vastly intelligent, and vastly disturbing as well, in its portrayal of rudderless and unprincipled lives in search of something to cling to (mainly fidelity and love), even though the characters who seek such life preservers are almost pathologically incapable of giving the same security to anyone else.

Darling is a movie that begs to be watched again and again, with nuanced performances from all of its stars, and Julie Christie in a deservedly Oscar-winning performance as a shallow, well-meaning husk of a woman for whom looks have opened the door and who plays life like a narcissistic game.  We've met her type before -- the kind as to whom you might mistake the looks, the desperate hugs, the spirited lovemaking, and the promises as reflective of human depth when, in fact, they are mere shadows and masks concealing a vain emptiness.

The men she entangles seemingly should know better, but we find that they, too, are bereft of heart and of character, and largely self-deluded or self-absorbed.  Darling is also populated by those who revel in meaningless gamesmanship and cynical manipulation.

Darling isn't all gloom, for in its performances you get a glimmer of how life might better be lived ... and you might appreciate more what you have or should start seeking right away.",1114387200,7,1432,4.945833333333334

In ""Dr. Zhivago"", I never understood why Yuri left Tonya for her Lara.  In this film, however, she seems perfectly cast as the social climbing model who will do anything and use anyone to get to the next level.  She even engenders some sympathy for her character when she attains her ""dream"" and it's not all that it's cracked up to be.  The reason she probably won the Oscar for this performance is that she made an essentially unsympathetic character somewhat bearable.  Not to be overlooked is Dirk Bogarde's sympathetic portrayal as the writer who Christie's Diana uses on her way to the top but who inevitably gets the last laugh on her.

1221549,5,B00000IBS7,"""Darling"" is a searing look into the shallow life of a London girl during the mid-60's. It stars Julie Christie in the title role of Diana Scott and takes us through a few years of her life from mod-model to wife of an Italian prince. Dianna's messy life and total disregard for others is brilliantly shown through the convention of her telling ""My Story"" to a magazine while contrasting her tale with the actual facts of her life.
  Co-stars Dirk Bogarde, Laurence Harvey each serves the story in their unique and gifted ways. Bogarde as Robert Gold is Diana's one brush with real emotion and possible salvation is at the top of his form giving yet another fine performance in support of Miss Christie. Laurence Harvey is cold and calculating as the bored playboy Miles Brand. He has never been better or has his angular face been shown to be more sardonic and deceitful than here in this film.
  The direction by John Schlesinger is razor sharp and never misses the truth behind each scene. Cinematographer Kenneth Higgins captures the feel of mid-60's London, Pairs and Italy in crisp and clean shots. His close-ups are nearly surgical in what they render visible to the eye.
  John Dankworth executed the composition of one of the most haunting themes from the sixties, which plays over the brilliant opening credits. His score is perfect and underscores Diana's story so well.
  Finally there is Julie Christie in her Oscar winning performance.  What a revelation this film and Miss Christie were at the time. Movies were changing so rapidly from what they had been all along to a more adult and honest look at life. The cracks began to appear after WW II. They widened in the 1950's but by the time ""Darling' came along the movie industry had changed, imploded then exploded into a new and freer form of expression. Riding this wave to triumph in 1965 was the nearly unknown Miss Christie. Her Diana is unapologetic, raw and wonderful.  She never holds back in showing us the ugly side of this beautiful vacuous woman and by the last scene she commands the screen with the authority of a truly perfect performance.",1088380800,9,2120,4.736413043478261

This requires him (as he explains it) to use his hyper erection mode. This allows him to move at hyper-speed (about as far from reality as you can get). Fortunately for him, he's just married his lovely and well endowed assistant who's more that happy to give him a hand. She does more than provide lip service to the project and does so with a subservient demeanor that will be offensive to any woman who's not into that themselves and attractive to males who's fantasies run that direction.

The DVD keeps almost everything in tact except a shot of a man rushing into a room to 'perform' with his cigarette smoking female partner.  What you're left watching is a close-up of Julie Christie's shocked face as she stares at a woman smoking.  The impact of the scene is gone.

Julie Christe won an Oscar for her portrayal of Diana Scott, and manages to make this ""trivial and shallow"" woman interesting.
Frederick Raphael, who also won an Oscar for his work, wrote a story and script that is the basis of what makes this a riveting film to watch. Every scene makes sense, and every phrase has a purpose; there is not a single word that does not belong, or is unnecessary.
It is wonderfully photographed in a very crisp black and white by Ken Higgins, and has an unobtrusive but lovely score by John Dankworth.
Director John Schlesinger brings out the best in even the bit players, and most of all, from Dirk Bogarde, who gives a heartbreaking, brilliant performance as one of Diana's stepping stones. Laurence Harvey plays a vain and vile character with the snakelike coldness he is so good at, and of course, Christie is in her prime, and her beauty and talent shine bright.
Though the atmoshpere of the film is caught in the '60s, the story and characters are timeless; this film deserves to be viewed, for its tremendous performances, and as a portrait of how times change, but much of humanity stays the same, and selfish desires, even when satisfied, are but clanging brass.",1063843200,60,1352,4.708860759493671
1221553,5,B00000IBS7,"Her name isn't Darling, but that's what they call her. She doesn't mind, just as long as they call her--men, that is--for dates, jobs, whatever. John Schlesinger's second film with Julie Christie (after her cameo as Tom Courtenay's dream girl in ""Billy Liar"") put them both on the map--and won Christie the Oscar as social-climbing model/actress Diana Scott. It's a stylish, yet poignant tale (also deservedly garnering the gold for costume design); of its time, yet timeless--and the parallels between Diana and real-life royals Princesses Grace and that other Diana only add to the poignancy.

Christie's beauty and brilliance aside, the contributions of Dirk Bogarde (""The Servant"") and Laurence Harvey (""The Manchurian Candidate"")--two other leading lights of swinging sixties British cinema--shouldn't be overlooked. Harvey has rarely been more cool and callous, Bogarde rarely more vulnerable and human. Diana uses one man and is used by the other, only to give up her playgirl lifestyle for something brighter, shinier--and emptier. ""Darling"" represents the peak of the Schlesinger-Christie pairings and is one of the finest films of the 1960s. Or any decade.",1024704000,34,1166,5.477777777777778
1221554,5,B00000IBS7,"Darling is one of the best films of the 1960's, with its sharp direction, even sharper script, atmospheric black and white photography, and three outstanding star performances. The style of the film may seem somewhat dated, but its substance still packs a considerable punch.
The film involves its audience with genuine appeal to our emotions and intellect, rather than in the manipulative manner of many more modern movies. Darling makes us think and challenges us to feel. Although very much a reflection of its time, Darling still has very much to say to us today. It is sad, therefore, that some of those involved in its making tend to distance themselves from it now. Maybe their subsequent careers have made them resemble the film's targets more than its protagonists. If nothing else, Darling is populated by real people - some of whom are sometimes uncomfortably realistic.
It is perhaps difficult to realise now how shocking a character Julie Christie was portraying at the time - in those uptight days when free love and liberated women were only just beginning to surface into public awareness. The audience was asked to feel sympathy for this middle class girl who bed-hopped her way from model to princess with barely a hint of conscience. Perhaps she was intended to be another British anti-hero - a female cousin of Jimmy Porter, Joe Lampton or Arthur Seaton. Or maybe she was the prophetic face of the future - the sixties symbol that everything was changing. Whatever the intention, the character of Diana Scott made a definite impact, both on the men in her life and on the audiences who watched her with a mixture of fascination, disbelief, and quite possibly a touch of envy.
The film's solid foundation - some might say its heart and soul - lies in the wordly wise and wickedly witty script by Frederic Raphael. His characters are equally blessed with sarcasm and faults - they all have a knack for delivering wonderful one-liners in moments of crisis. Example - When Dirk Bogarde parts for the last time from Christie, he tells her that he intends to write a book about his life. Christie says that she played the biggest part in his life. Bogarde raises an eyebrow and replies quietly: ""Certainly the most melodramatic"".
It is precisely this contrast between Christie's emotional rollercoaster and Bogarde's coolly calculated underplaying that provides most of the film's best moments. Although Laurence Harvey also makes a significant contribution. I have always felt that Harvey was a seriously under-rated actor and here he proves just how effective he could be. Christies may have been the romantic face of a changing Britain, but Harvey was the realistic symbol of how things really worked - of the British obsession with class, appearance, self-interest and hyprocrisy that still exists today. It says much for Dirk Bogarde that he gives the best performance while playing the least believable character. Stranger still, that Gregory Peck was once considered for the role.
If I have gone on about the stars more than the direction or music or anything like that, it is because this is essentially a film about people. The plot is not so much about what happens to them but how these events affect and change them. The camerawork is occasionally flashy but never intrusive. Sometimes the film looks almost like a documentary, an illusion helped by a first-rate supporting cast. But, more than anything else, this is Julie Christie's film - she is as faultless as she is natural. She won an Oscar for playing Diane Scott.

I thought she was just great in Zhivago, but after seeing Darling, I thought the Academy made the correct choice in awarding the Oscar for her Diana Scott. She was the whole show, in my opinion. She had a series of unsuccessful relationships and ended up the wife of an Italian nobleman, and was just as miserable. Love and happiness seemed to elude her throughout the film. I thought the emotional heart of the film came from Dirk Bogarde, clearly he was the most sympathetic performer.  Darling was a key film of the swinging 60s, no doubt because of Miss Christie. I have seen the film quite a few times and it continues to entertain.",1509408000,,800,4.555555555555555

When I saw Darling for the first time and it got to the scene where Diana Scott and her photographer friend Malcolm are sharing the Italian waiter for a motorcycle ride in the evening to give him a taste of both worlds I thought of the part in John Bunyans Pilgrims Progress where Christian and Faithful were traveling through Vanity Fair--a city which promised endless pleasure and excitement but often lead to death and despair--and a merchant offers to buy their costly garments. The two pilgrims politely refused saying They are not for sale. to which the merchant replied. Stuff and nonsense! EVERYTHING is for SALE at Vanity Fair!

Back in the 1960s America and England had their Vanity Fair as well--often referred to as the Baby Boomers, Woodstock Festival or Sexual Revolution. Several members of the younger generation began to thumb their noses at traditional values. Dirty, torn or psychedelic clothes and wacky hairstyles were designed to attract attention and drugs and sexual intercourse with total strangers were considered acceptable customs because one of this cultures main slogans were The heart wants what it wants.

Diana Scott is a naive young woman who gets caught up in this culture (hence the aforementioned scene with the waiter as well as the French party) only to find out too late that all this free love and free spiritedness isn't all its cracked up to be and consequences do exist.
She also represents the average middle class person who is dissatisfied with their lot in life and expresses the desire to rise above their meager roots and become 'somebody' because they have bought into the lie that there is everlasting fulfillment in the higher class. Unfortunately, in the process of climbing the social ladder, she associates with men of low degree who brainwash her into being as morally bankrupt as they are.

Her first husband (I don't think his name was ever mentioned) is a poor college student who can only afford a three room apartment. She would much rather live in a five star hotel so she applies for a job as a news reporter and becomes the television broadcasters (Robert) mistress.

For a while, all goes well and then she is unhappy again. She is a reporter but she must be an actress as well. So she takes acting classes and enters a business transaction with a director (Miles) who provides her a series of roles. She becomes pregnant and at first is overjoyed at the prospect of motherhood. But then she realizes this will put a temporary delay on her career so she has an abortion.

Once again, all goes well for Diana but still this is not enough. Now she wishes to be a princess. So she takes a vacation to Italy and marries a prince. (Cesare)

Now she is all over the headlines in Europe and there is nothing greater she can become. But then she takes a look at all the lives she's touched--the three men she ditched one after another and the unborn child she sacrificed for her acting career--and realizes it wasn't worth it. The scene where she has a nervous breakdown, tears up her room, tears off her clothes and flings herself on her bed in tears says it all--she will never forgive herself for how she made it to the top.

We may not see Diana dying of AIDS, drugs or alcohol but we do see the psychological and spiritual consequences of her actions. Look at how she slowly looses her ability to truly love and build meaningful relationships with her fellow men because when she sees Robert all she notices is the attractiveness of the outer shell and the key to becoming a rich mans kept woman. Later on she is complaining about how dull and insipid the thrill of the moment is. I never want to have anything to do with sex again. and when she meets Miles and Prince Cesare now even the outer shell no longer maters--its all about the big movie roles and the great stone mansion. This is especially well emphasized in the scene when Diana and Miles prepare themselves for the business transaction. The way they unfold the blankets and take their clothes off is so slow, mechanical and almost robotic which emphasizes how there is no real love going on between them.

The ending scene is quite effective in stressing the message of the film--how immoral and worthless the lives of the ""American Idol"" people often are and how their glamour serves as a poor substitute for the things in life that really matter.

The billboard publicizing Diana's memoirs reads ""My Life: Diana Scott"" on the top and ""The Ideal Woman"" on the bottom. A poignant bit of irony because we know from what we have seen, Diana is far from ideal.

Then the final shot zooms in on a beggar woman singing opera in the streets. She is shabbily dressed and has next to nothing, yet she is singing her heart out because of the joy bubbling over in her soul that she just has to share with the rest of the world--in contrast to Diana who has everything but is completely miserable.

One of the main reasons I saw this film was because I knew from research Julie Christie won the 1965 Academy Award for Best Actress and when I looked at the ballot I said ""Darn! If she beat out Julie Andrews as Maria in the Sound of Music and Elizabeth Hartman as the blind girl in A Patch of Blue she better BRING DOWN THE HOUSE!""

I would still have voted for Julie Andrews because she has a more challenging role--to act while singing and portray a character of sheer goodness without coming across as cloying or saccharine--and she turns it in rich with layers of details and dimensions--not only Maria's love for music and the children but also her fears, insecurities and outspokenness and how she grows from a ditsy, awkward, irresponsible postulant to a mature and confident governess and later on devoted wife and mother. And her relationship with the captain is very beautifully treated as well in that even though you know they're eventually going to fall in love it develops so slowly and gradually that it feels real. I really liked the fact the while he is struggling with an attraction to her at times--like the scenes where he sings Edelweiss and dances with her at the ball--his love for her seemed to stem more from her character than her face. (In contrast to the banality of the relationships of Diana and her men in Darling.)

That being said, I still wholeheartedly endorse Julie Christie's win because she infuses a gritty sense of realism in the way she portrays a wide variety of emotions and manages to convey that there is more than just plain sleaziness going on beneath the surface of Diana's character--her insecurity in being a 'nobody,' the desire to better her livelihood, to find the right man to build a meaningful relationship with, etc.) And in the end, she's punished--she will have to remember for the rest of her life how she compromised her moral fiber little by little to attain her goals.

Diana may not be particularly likable but she is incredibly poignant. Try to imagine a nation full of people where:

1. 50% of marriages end up in divorce because they either give the gift of their love to unworthy men and women or hope that maybe--JUST MAYBE--in the wide scope of the world with all it's billions and billions of people--Mr. or Mrs. Right is out there somewhere--and not always in a romantic sense but perhaps platonic as well--simply the desire for warmth and friendship--such as Diana's relationship with Malcolm, the photographer, who unfortunately introduces her to more kinds of sin just as her two lovers did.

2. Middle class members who tend to use their credit cards to live a little bit above their means so they can surround themselves with beautiful and costly objects to assure themselves that they are 'somebody' and put on a show of greater wealth than they actually have to impress their friends.

3. Parents hoping and praying their daughter will marry a man better off than they are so she will have a better livelihood than they did--hence the bedroom scene where Diana's parents are discussing her future.

Then you might be surprised at how many people conduct themselves more or less the way Diana does. Maybe they aren't always as downright godless as she is but still have her mindset to a certain extent.

So to put it in a nutshell, when you see the ""Ideal woman"" sign and feel like laughing, something should check you inside and make you question if you are truly above becoming just like her.

7910334,5,B00000IBS7,"After his major success with A Kind of Loving and Billy Liar British New Wave director John Schlesinger triumphed again with Darling, one of the most trend setting films of the mid-sixties. It starred Julie Christie, whose role in the second half of Billy Liar almost stole the film and certainly made her someone to watch. With a very strong supporting cast she is completely believable as Diana, a popular model who is seduced by dreams of glamour and will do whatever it takes to make it to the good life. Though the character is self-centered and seemingly amoral, such is Julie Christie's charisma that one can't help feeling for her and hoping she'll find her way out of her unfulfilling life.

The film is many things. it's a revelation of a new kind of media celebrity lifestyle taking place in the sixties as well as a satirical take on the Sixties itself with it's live for today attitudes and hedonistic pleasure seeking. It's a picture of a world where the main power women had was to be beautiful and the way to anything involved attracting powerful men. It's a snapshot of the Swinging Sixties though not exactly of Swinging London as some seem to think. Swinging London was not something that you could visit as one could the Haight Ashbury a couple years later. It was more of a set of people who formed a new hip elite and who went to certain clubs and parties. Though Diana's role as a top model would certainly have gotten her admittance to these circles, in London she has become attached to Robert Gold (Dirk Bogarde), a television journalist whose circle is that of news professionals and celebrated authors. With Miles Brand (Lawrence Harvey) she travels to Paris where the crowd seems to be one of the decadent rich. With Prince Cesare della Romita she finally attains social status but loses everything else as an aristocrat's trophy wife.

Everything is spot on in this film and Schlesinger's scene setting is as imaginative as ever. Most memorable to me is the interlude of the trip to Capri she makes with her gay photographer friend Malcolm, where the atmosphere becomes truly lyrical and it seems that perhaps she will see things more clearly and try to set a new course. Even in black and white Capri looks truly radiant. She does not, of course, and seals her future. One still can't help but feel for her, as her fame after being picked out for a man in the street interview is suddenly thrust upon her and soon sweeps her away; hers is not a coldly calculated course like Lawrence Harvey's Joe Lampton in Room At the Top. At the very end perhaps she can't find love but is left with a life of many possibilities due to her wealth and social status from charity work to social entertaining or travel and of course, taking an active role in raising the children. I know most see her trapped in an empty life in the end (many people feeling rightfully), but I'd like to feel there is some hope there. I think, however, it's just that I like Julie Christie.",1475020800,4,2987,4.591760299625468
