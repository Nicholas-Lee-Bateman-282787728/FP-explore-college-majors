4396485,4,B004KDO2ZW,"This well recorded concert originates from the Suntory Hall, Tokyo in 2000. The concert has clearly been designed to satisfy the musical tastes of a wide range of concert goers with a program that centres around the well-known works of Weber and Dvorak plus an excursion into the less well-known territory of a Shostakovich concerto of significance.

The quality of the actual recording is particularly good for its period and is reminiscent of the advanced recording quality of Abbado's earlier concert from the same venue which included one of the best Tchaikovsky 5's available and in widescreen plus DTS 5.1 genuine surround sound. In this case the imaging is crisp and of good colour rendition. The superiority of the imaging is quite obvious on long shots from the rear of the hall where the image does not break up as it so often does on other recordings of that vintage. The camera work offers instrumental detail without straying into the invasive. The sound is good, presented in DTS 5.1, DD 5.1 and stereo, but benefits from an increase of playback level of about 3 decibels. This is largely because some of the soft answering phrases that Jansons coaxes from the orchestra, particularly in the Dvorak, are too quiet to be heard comfortably. At the other end of the scale, climaxes don't really open out enough either and need the extra volume for the liveliness of the performances to make its proper effect.

The concert opens with a deliciously performed opening horn solo, played without conductor input, that leads into the opening slow section which shows the orchestra's woodwind dialogue off to good advantage. This ability of the woodwind to 'talk' to each other is also very well illustrated in the Dvorak slow movement. The remainder of the piece is played in a markedly lively way with crisp rhythms pointed up very well and prepares the way for the Shostakovich concerto.

The Shostakovich 1st Violin concerto is constructed in four movements with the last two being connected by a lengthy cadenza. The dedicatee, David Oistrakh, took a markedly different approach to this work from Hilary Hahn in his 1972 recording with Maxim Shostakovich conducting. Oistrakh had a much richer and darker tone quality to his playing whereas Hilary Hahn has a very clean and pure sound. Oistrakh therefore brought a certain heaviness to his playing whereas Hilary Hahn produces more of a quick-silver sound and phrasing. Oistrakh emphasised this with generally slower speeds whereas Hilary Hahn keeps things very much on the move. The scherzo movement in her case is sharply defined but lightweight whereas Oistrakh makes this movement one of biting sarcasm. Throughout the concerto Miss Hahn remains totally focussed on her performance and comes over as a quite a cool customer and that is also a valid description of her interpretation which does not really attempt to dig deep into the Russian soul or into any political underlying messages as Oistrakh seems to portray. Any suggestion of 'angst' is not part of Hilary Hahn's view. Her encore performance of a presto movement by Bach is a considerable feat of digital wizardry.

The Dvorak 8th is given a performance that keeps a strong forward momentum. The only times that this is not maintained is at the climactic moment of the first movement and the conclusion of the opening quick section of the last movement where Jansons holds back the tempo to underline the importance of the moment. This is quite a common feature of performances, in danger of becoming traditional, and applies to Czech performances too. These speed changes are not in the score and destroy the actual excitement of those moments of accumulative excitement or drama. Conductors who do not slow down always benefit by staying with Dvorak's written intentions at these moments. One other point to mention, is the backward balance of the horns which means that the loud trills in the final movement of the Symphony are inaudible and the important horn solo at the conclusion of the concerto does not rise over the orchestra as much it should do to balance the soloist more equally.

The encore, the Op 72 no. 7 Slavonic Dance goes very well with vigour and enthusiasm and, not surprisingly, brings the whole concert to a rousing conclusion which is enthusiastically applauded by the packed audience.

Despite my reservations about a couple of tempo changes in the Dvorak and some backward horn balances, this remains a very good concert and one that is very effectively recorded provided that playback volume is increased to add bite. Hilary Hahn provides an interesting alternative view of the concerto.

I would suggest that, if the program appeals, then this disc offers an enjoyable concert of major works and all performed to the high standards that one would expect of the orchestra, conductor and soloist. As such I would also suggest that the disc would make an attractive proposition as a good value potential purchase.",1373414400,6,4965,4.989130434782608
4396486,5,B004KDO2ZW,"The last time I checked, Japan was not in Europe. Maybe after the next tsunami it will be.
This concert features a talented Hilary Hahn, a young violinist playing the Violin Concerto No. 1 by Shostakovich, which has just the right amount of dissonance, followed by a Bach sonata for solo violin, which has none.
Mauriss Jansons leads the orchestra in Dvorak's 8th Symphony. In America we mostly know the 9th Symphony, which was written in Iowa, but the 8th is very nice, as is the Slovonic Dance No. 7 (short but sweet).
If you're like me, these works are new to you. This is probably true of the folks at Suntory Hall. Watch this DVD and amaze your friends who have only seen Beethoven's 9th Symphony.",1353542400,,702,4.535433070866142
4396487,5,B004KDO2ZW,"Other reviewers have focused on the 9th Symphony. My reason for buying this was the violin concerto from Shostakovich which has some symphonic characteristics. It is a piece that requires insight and patience to appreciate. The Berliner's under Mariss Jansons' capable baton provide a rock solid musical foundation for Miss Hahn to do her magic with the violin. And magic she does! A brilliant performance, flawlessly played, that brings out both the beauty and emotion (maybe more subtle than other violin players would) of the music. Oh, and Hilary, just one more thing: love your dress!",1344556800,3,589,5.145833333333333
4396488,4,B004KDO2ZW,"I first encountered the Dvorak 8th. in 1962, with Istvan Kertesz and the LSO, and have heard many other versions since. None is finer than the Ivan Fischer/Budapest Phil of a few years back. It's bouncy, vibrant, dance-like and the third movement is a total revelation with all the glissandos and portamento used to accentuate the thrust.

However, this is all about dvd, not cd, so choices are very slim - this one and one on a Dvorak set from the early 90's. My friend ""GPK"" tells me the latter 8th. is nothing special.

Jansons is always a reliable conductor, but he has his work cut out here with the 2000 vintage BPO trying to make them sound Slavic. This is after all Dvorak's most ""Czech"" symphony. The BPO try mightily, and they sound like a good German orchestra attempting to penetrae music that's not in their blood. It's not half bad, but it's smoother rather than idiomatic. Very pleasant listening, but it won't knock your socks off as the Fischer cd will.

I'm not that familiar with the Shostakovich Violin Concerto #1, so I listened to it twice before writing this review. It's a sardonic and chilly piece, not for everyday consumption, but sometimes I'm in just that kind of mood where watching and listening to this will be just the ticket. Hilary Hahn is marvellous playing it - done when she was about 20 years old. It's worth getting to know.

Weber is not a favorite of mine, but the Oberon overture is played to the hilt, as is the Dvorak Slavonic Dance #7.

I wonder why this concert took ten years to release on disc? Perhaps EuroArts doesn't have much new stuff, so it's digging into its vaults just to put something out. It's getting harder to separate the wheat from the chaff with a lot of these ""new"" releases. It's nice to see other labels like C-Major giving EuroArts a run for its money.

The video is good, but not great. Highlighting individuals and groups has come a long way in the last ten years. Sound is also good but the dts sounds like it's been cobbled together from an original stereo source - not up to EuroArts' contemporary standards at all.

So, worth having, but not indispensible.",1303171200,8,2131,4.56282722513089
4396489,5,B004KDO2ZW,"This live recording dates from 2000 and was made in the Tokyo Suntory Hall in excellent video and uncompressed (Stereo) sound. If you like the program, it is a clear winner. My minor, subjective quibbles concern the selection of works. The lightweight Oberon overture is not particularly memorable. Neither is the Shostakovich First Violin Concerto, which, with the exception of the third movement, betrays a certain lack of musical substance. As a friend of mine would say: I can take it or leave it. Regardless, Hilary Hahn plays it brilliantly, passionately and with great panache and makes me want to hear it again. Her virtuosity is utterly phenomenal. For me, however, the real treasure here is the Dvorak Eight: a glowing, idiomatic, strikingly dramatic and thoroughly musical performance reminiscent of the best efforts of the great Czech maestros and orchestras. It is liltingly beautiful and certainly outshines by far Petr Altrichters reading in the otherwise remarkable Arthaus Antonin Dvorak Cycle (see my review). The great Mariss Jansons transports the often brittle, self-conscious and highly drilled Berliners into a different sphere of smiling music making: no small feat indeed. You will not be disappointed: this is perhaps the best recent Dvorak Eight available in any medium.",1301875200,11,1297,5.331707317073171

8432755,5,B004KDO2ZW,"Japanese lovers of Western musical compositions are especially appreciative when such performances are offered in Japan. The beautiful and acoustically superior Suntory Hall in Tokyo, opened on October 12, 1986, was constructed specifically for the presentation of Western music. It was designed in the Vineyard Style, in which the audience surrounds the concert floor in the main hall. Herbert von Karajan was involved in this design and later stated that the Hall was ""a jewel box of sound"". The Berliner Philharmoniker has been journeying to Japan with some regularity for many years to satisfy this taste of the Japanese audiences. This particular performance from November 26, 2000, was received with great enthusiasm by a packed-out audience. Latvian conductor Mariss Jansons and the Berliner Philharmoniker began their relationship in 1976. Jansons has a devout commitment to performing Russian music from the Soviet era with some emphasis on the music of Dimitry Shostakovich. United States born violinist Hilary Hahn executes the Shastakovich First Violin Concerto from 1955 ""with eloquence and vehemence"". Her Bach encore is ""...emotive, intense and pure..."". Carl Maria von Weber's last opera, Oberon, has an overture with ""illustrious melodies and vibrant rhythms"". Here it is performed magnificently. The Dvorak Symphony No. 8 was performed first in Prague in February 1890. It is scored for a large orchestra including piccolo, cor anglais, horns, trumpets, trombones, tuba and timpani. It is ""...imbued..."" with the spirit of Bohemia. Dvorak's second series of Slavonic Dances were written in the Summer of 1886 and orchestrated during that Winter. All of the pieces performed here are examples of some of the best of Western music and the Japanese audience apparently agrees!",1430524800,3,1791,5.492753623188406
