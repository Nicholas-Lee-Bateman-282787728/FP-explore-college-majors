5995375,4,B00FKPJ3VM,Once upon a time there was a man who was bored one night and decided to spend a few pennies on a movie from Amazon.  He did and thought the movie he watched was pretty good.  Weird but good and a great perspective on the lives of gay relationships.  Pretty cool.,1381708800,,262,4.098039215686274
5995376,4,B00FKPJ3VM,"Bought this movie based on the trailer and was glad I did: good acting/casting/writing--lots of good NY actors!  Movie about a upper class lesbian housewife that experiments with the ""oldest profession"" to satisfy her relationships' ""lesbian bed death.""  But the film is so much more than that with subtext...  The films' star has some good acting chops and a great body to watch throughout the film, among the other hot women.  There is also another emotional journey that takes place for the main character, Abby, the lesbian housewife, that is interesting to witness.  Spoiler alert! Once specific moment in the film (you'll see in the trailer) when Abby takes on a neighborhood housewife (Sam) as a client was interesting, since a bit of hypocrisy arises when Abby calls out Sam for ""experimenting sexually"" outside of her current happy heterosexual relationship.  Abby has no room to criticize another for being unfaithful in light of her insatiable sexual appetite that motivates her ""call girl"" status.  The end of the film is another interesting take on relationships--turning a blind eye--that one you can judge for yourself if you care to.  Overall I found the film exciting and intriguing and I plan on watching it a few times.  Well made in terms of an ""indie lesbian film.""",1381708800,,1286,5.0
5995377,4,B00FKPJ3VM,"I really enjoyed this film, especially the surprise ending that indicates how much we are willing to endure and sacrifice to maintain the status quo. The acting is fantastic and the storyline very believable. The sex scenes are very realistic. Highly recommend it!",1381536000,,264,5.162790697674419
5995378,2,B00FKPJ3VM,"I really enjoyed the acting of the lead actress in this film (Robin Weigert) who plays Abby/Eleanor, the bored middle aged housewife, but was ultimately quite disappointed by the ending of this film.

This film is about Abby, a middle aged lesbian housewife with two kids, who is married to a woman who is for some reason, emotionally unavailable to her and hardly pays attention to Abby.  In the guise of 'Eleanor', Abby, the bored lesbian housewife starts turning tricks with women to get some sex and attention. The sex was interesting (not salacious), and a few scenes with `Eleanor's' tricks were emotionally painful to watch because they they were so sad and intense. I also thought throughout this movie that Abby was coming to her senses regarding her unfulfilling relationship with her distant wife as she seemed to wake up from her emotional malaise. However, at the end of this movie, I was totally thrown by the nonsensical ending. I am giving this film 4 stars for Robin Weigert's terrific acting, but 1 star for the miserable and nihilistic ending, ergo my 2 star rating.

By the way, I 'purchased' this movie and do not plan on watching it ever again.  If you are curious about this film after my review, I only recommend that you rent it.",1381449600,61,1254,4.712328767123288
5995379,3,B00FKPJ3VM,I LIKED IT BECAUSE THE ACTING WAS NOT FAKE LIKE IN OTHER LESBIAN MOVIES.  IT WAS REALISTIC BUT VERY SLOW PACED.,1381449600,,111,4.285714285714286
5995380,5,B00FKPJ3VM,"I had pretty much given up hope on much of the state of lesbian cinema.  Although this is not exactly a lesbian flick per se, for tho this has gay content, it's a uniquely human story, applicable to all orientations.  And the profundity, beauty, complexity, intelligence and depth of this movie is MINDBLOWING.  I'm a bit sorry I only downloaded to rent and not to buy, as it is worth many, many, many rewatching.  Highly recommend.",1381363200,35,432,4.644736842105263
5995381,4,B00FKPJ3VM,I've heard a lot about this.  Read the Salon review.  It didn't disappoint.  I had to walk around the block a few times after it was over thinking about things...  It's weird for a movie to have that effect on you but this one did.,1381190400,,231,4.066666666666666

5995383,4,B00FKPJ3VM,"I found this to be a lovely film with quality acting and directing.  It moves at a  pretty slow pace, but the dialogue is believable and the content is fresh.  I often judge the quality of a film by whether I am thinking about it the next day.  The main protagonist and her struggles kept coming back to me, in fact, I may watch the film again because there are several layers to work through; the perspective of the bored housewife, the workaholic partner, the culture they are living in.  It's a thoughtful film, with some rough around the edges camera work, but the film was worth my time and money!",1380931200,78,602,4.387387387387387
5995384,4,B00FKPJ3VM,"This is an edited update of my review below. (2nd review)For reasons unknown I've come back and watched this film again and again and again. Five times since my first review. I'm liking this film more and more. Perhaps I'm seeing myself in here, in Sam's role. (Maggie) Maybe my life has gotten this boring as well, and I need something new. I agree with everything I wrote before but now I really like the film. The situations are realistic in that they are a view of Robin's character's boring, going nowhere life. Therefore, the film can seem boring. Her everyday life is on a timetable of boring....exercise class now, spin class, yoga class, work from home, gather up the kids, boring stupid little parties with the same friends....
  Abby / Eleanor decides to become an escort and meets the same type of women but all are looking for some sex, some excitement, some ANYTHING other than what they have been doing. But when 'Eleanor' get a new client, Sam Bennet, a casual acquaintance who she already thinks is cute, and straight, things change. Sam is also bored, and bi, and lonely. They hit it off and find they have much in common as lovers and the rich-wives-of-hard-working-spouses.
  I keep thinking about this film, and the filming, and the acting. I finally get the film and I like it. It is not for everyone but try it once or twice. Nyms

(1st review) I really looked forward to getting this because I really like Maggie Siffs. First of all, after the opening credits, the movie fizzles, sputters a bit, and dies. The R rating should have been PG. I wasn't looking for porn but this is quite mellow. If anyone is looking for full frontal nudity of Maggie or Robin, it ain't gonna to be here. What WAS good was the filming is exquisite. Soft, almost old fashioned colour. Staging is great. There are some truly funny scenes in here. Everything in the film is most likely more true to life than most stories where everything goes along perfectly. I wish I could live in the area of NYC that they do...the old lofts and buildings are as I remember them from years ago. I may watch this film once more, since I bought it used for $9.95. I may like it more, or perhaps I'll just use it as a coaster. I don't think Maggie had a full screen time of more than twelve minutes or so. So, if you really like Maggie Sifts and her acting, you will like Sons of Anarchy because of seven seasons of her in a number of emotional scenes. And ...I'm jealous of her lovely dark natural lashes when she closes her eyes.... I'm very light blonde and even mascara doesn't help... Nyms",1489104000,3,2578,4.476595744680851

5995401,3,B00FKPJ3VM,"I was pulled in until the end. I thought this was a very adept profile of American life. I appreciated the characters' expressions and am disappointed in the people complaining about unsophisticated dialogue and lack of character development. It gave the movie room to think and breathe. It wasn't designed to be ""West Wing""-style machine-gun conversation, and I liked it for that. Speaking of American life, I thought the entire premise of the movie was ""the illusion of choice"" (yeh, it was there, hidden). This is a pretty superficial existence. The poignant sequence of perfect, high-end artwork and furnishings on the walls while she's crying was the crux. We're in a damn cage socially, politically, economically, culturally...and if you're not careful, maritally. The sex was just sex; she wasn't looking for love. She was looking for freedom. Yes, the main character did a poor job of communicating needs to her spouse. And she was deceitful. That she tried to relieve her frustrations in other parts of her life with creative sex is an allure many hard-working but bored people experiment with. It's better to pair up with someone who is compatible that way, or not pair up at all. The worst, however, was the ending -- completely unacceptable and uninspiring. ""Stay on your hamster wheel and shorten your focus to the little things"" seemed to be the message. Maybe that's the disappointment we were meant to feel. But I think it could have been expressed some much more artfully like the rest of the film managed.",1483488000,5,1523,4.953125

5995411,5,B00FKPJ3VM,"The overall culmination of the story might not be what you anticipate or expect (which seems to be a common complaint amongst reviewers), but Robin Weigert's performance makes up for it all.  She is an expert actor.  I have watched this film several times and I am captivated by the performances, the story, and yes, the ending.  It takes a little bit of critical thought and attention to subtlety to truly appreciate and understand it, but the ending isn't what really makes the film anyway.  The acting in itself is worth it enough to watch, and as a lesbian, I appreciate this film as a great addition to the catalogue of queer female representation.",1480118400,,653,4.701754385964913

5995418,4,B00FKPJ3VM,"Sometime in another life I put Concussion on my watchlist and forgot about it. Several days ago, as I was updating my list I decided to watch this movie for no reason other than to get it off my list. Wow, What a pleasant treat. The trailer narrative does a good job of describing the movie, so the content was no surprise. What was, though, was the fine screenplay, fine directing, and Robin Weigert's super job of bringing the character of Abby to life. She completely destroyed the most common stereotypes of lesbians, and revealed a vulnerable 42 year old woman going through a midlife crisis. There are several sex scenes, but they are far from being ""sexy"". Instead, they are for the purpose of showing Abby's internal struggle as she goes about finding her real self. This movie does take some patience for the story to develop, but it is never boring. It certainly changed my way of looking at a lesbian relationship.",1477612800,,925,4.646341463414634

BUT, if you're looking for a refreshingly honest, painful, and real look at the complications of love, loneliness, and the need to escape, you may like this one. I for one cannot stop thinking about Abby. Everything in this movie rang true to me, from the superb acting to the relationship dynamics between her and her wife. This movie broke my heart and cut straight to the bone.

The film may be slow moving, but I never found it to be laboriously so, and the pace is needed to show the monotony of Abby's life, the hopelessness and emptiness of the everyday moments: folding the laundry, vacuuming the floors. The awkwardness of the first encounters between Abby and her clients portrays the humanity and uncertainty--as well as yes, the pent-up passion--of the character. And the ambiguous ending I think, is because (at least in my experience) life is quite rarely clear and uncomplicated, particularly when it comes to relationships.

At any rate, there is a lot to wrestle with in this film, and it will occupy my thoughts for a while, and that's just what a good film should do.",1465516800,2,1239,4.7050691244239635

For instance, the disconnection that can happen between partners when work and home responsibilities take first place and how different people cope with that. Once they had a crisis they took a serious look at their relationship and went from there. Second, the man is usually the cheater in relationships but these are two women so that factor is different.

5995804,3,B00FKPJ3VM,"Tough to review this film. It is a love story at the bottom of it and definitely a ""chick flick"" in more ways than one. At a human level it portrays the complexities of our emotions and desires. A woman in what appears to be a loving relationship with another woman is offered an opportunity to become a prostitute to other women. There is a hint of her becoming simply morally corrupted, but there is enough thoughtfulness to not allow her to completely degenerate as a person. The story moves slowly never devolving into actual pornography but does include some rather graphic intimate scenes. It all turns out fine at the end as true love triumphs, in a mature and caring way. It may well serve as a guide to real adult emotions that can too easily become negative and ugly.",1461715200,6,777,4.5177304964539005

She becomes a short time hooker for other Lesbians then goes back to her real life, no one gets hurt, except emotionally. No one dies, there's no violence in the whole movie at all, no drama either and a rather dull movie.  If you'll thinking there's some good lesbian action in it then rent some time on a PPV all girl channel rather than waste your time watching this flick because there's only really skinny women or a really FAT girl in it.

Instead the lead female couple here are both seemingly well seasoned & fully out lesbians who have been married for a long time and seem to have a solid family unit including two kids. The main focus is on the lead character whose wife is overly immersed in work, seems too tired and/or uninterested in sex while the other is a bored housewife who seems to have reached her sexual pique. We watch her find an unconventional way to quench her sexual appetite while also finding a creative outlet through a home renovation. A negative would be that the couple seemed to never fully address or discuss the core issue of their disfunction other than unspoken words of understanding which may work for those couples who know each other's hearts & souls well enough and can move pass such infidelity skipping the angst arguments and tears.

pretty lame.  Even the sex scenes were empty.  The ending just underlined how unfulfilled these peoples' lives are: workouts, shopping, remodeling homes - that's it.  I do not recommend seeing this film and am amazed at some of the enthusiastic reviews!",1457827200,2,549,5.044444444444444

5996149,5,B00FKPJ3VM,"Wow...a very good look at one (lesbian) woman's exploration of sexuality.  The blurbs suggest that the protagonist's concussion, which we never see given the immediate aftermath--her being rushed to the hospital by her partner and their two children--is the 'cause' of the desires that lead her to become a high-priced lesbian call girl, but I disagree after only this initial viewing.  The movie is done in what I would call 'snippet fashion' -- we drop in on this scene snippet for the span of six seconds and are then whisked off to another snippet of maybe 17 seconds duration, then to a 3-second snip, and so on down the line.  Kudos to writer/director Stacie Passon (and yes, I'll look for more of her films) for making this all work, beautifully, and leaving few questions unanswered in the end despite what might at first appear to be a rather 'disjointed' film.  But back to my point.  Despite the movie's title and the blurb I came away with a very strong sense that what set up Abby (Robin Weigert) to begin this exploration was presented in the snippet where she snuggles against her sleeping partner, Kate (Julie Fain Lawrence), in a clearly horny state.  Kate moans with obvious disdain at being wakened but turns to her and moves a hand down between Abby's legs, begins stroking  her...and then goes back to sleep, her hand just lying there, slack.  Abby's frustration is written clearly on her face.  There's another brief scene late in the movie which I feel supports my contention but I won't spoil it for you.",1428019200,,1528,4.735849056603773

If you don't enjoy watching a film that spawns countless conversations with friends and loved ones, for months to come, don't watch this one.  It will stimulate discussion and contemplation of so many issues committed couples of all sexual identity experience, if they have continued to persevere through the first couple of rough cycles most go through.  The brilliant casting of this film accentuates the remaining veil of discretion that gay women either choose, or revolt against, for individual reasons, as they strive to simply live their lives, and provide for their families, if they have chosen to have children.  All true love stories may be simple, but they will never be easy to see through to completion.  Acceptance is more difficult than..... Even the waiting.  Patience and kindness are traits that must be practiced and performed, alone.  If you love the indie spirit of film, do not cheat yourself out of this jewel.

5996165,2,B00FKPJ3VM,"It seems to have been the goal of the writers to make an art film, which sometimes consists of ""meaningful facial shots but lacking dialogue. The dialogue in this film was not only sparse, but also very uncompelling (poor writing).  The main drawback, to me, is that the film features very little realistic affection between the characters.  The film has no ""heart."" It does not lead the viewer to invest in the characters. As another reviewer noted, there is virtually no character development. If I do not get to know this character, Abby, and she is as remote as a zombie, why do I care about her? I don't.

I like the premise of the film: an affluent married woman tries something very risky and out of her comfort zone, becoming a female call girl catering to female clients.  But the fascinating plot developments which this scenario could potentially generate never come to fruition.

In Abbys relationships with her clients, the audience is given hints that one client or another is helping Abby to gain some sort of self-insight, but this is given tepid effort by the writers. It is never really believable. The level of communication between the characters is reminiscent of Aspergers (no offense to anyone). I liked the tad bit of tenderness in Abbys relationship with the heavy girl ... probably the only thing I liked about the film.

I dislike how the children are in the background as seeming ""plot decorations.""  Abby seems to have no real relationship with them. Both parents are so unengaged with the children that frankly I thought, I don't give a *&^% about your narcissistic journeys. Be with your kids or give them up.  Or take them out of the film because they have no meaning here.

Very refreshing! ***spoiler alert - sort of**** The two scenes that stood out for me in an intriguing way were when Abby 1st sees the young Asian girl in the restaurant that she had been set up with. She is shocked, that the woman looks so young...even though that is what she had agreed upon. Later on, in the movie, we see Abby and the same Asian woman making love.

5996187,4,B00FKPJ3VM,"I rented this movie after reading several of the reviews and after watching the trailer a few times.  I was hesitant because I wasn't sure if I was ready to watch this after watching Blue is the Warmest Color.  I had a free night to myself, so I gave it a shot, and wasn't disappointed.  Compared to Blue is the Warmest Color, Concussion would have to be the polar opposite.  Where Blue is all about passion, self-discovery and first love, Concussion is about lack of love, familiarity breeding contempt and self doubt.  Abby, the main character, is in a loveless relationship and has stopped working in order to be the stay at home mom.  In fact, she has denied herself a lot of things in order to appease her partner.  Deciding that she wants an extra-martial fling sets this movie into motion, and Abby sets out to find what she isn't getting at home.
Someone wrote that Abby was awkward and stiff with her partners in the beginning, making those love scenes not so exciting.  While the character was stiff at first, you have to take a second and think why.  She is a 42 year old woman who has been with the same person for years, and this partner has denied her any type of pleasure for who knows how long.  Lots of thoughts would be swirling through one's mind, and I am sure that it would be difficult to bear yourself both mentally and physically to a stranger.  Abby eventually lets herself go and gets hooked on meeting the new ""referrals"", not only discovering the different types of people and their sad stories, but also discovering herself at the same time.
The parts of the movie that made me think was why does Abby decide to stay with her partner if she is so unhappy.  She even confronts her and says that ""I am yours, no one else can have me, but you don't want me.""  Her partner admits that she doesn't want anybody, and Abby still stays.  Is it the money or the fact that they have 2 children; does she feel too old to start over? She is obviously good at what she does when she remodels places to flip them, so why doesn't she continue making her own money? The ending leaves it up to the viewer to decide, and it leaves you to keep thinking about what she will do.  This is not your typical movie with the happy ending, rather one that makes you work for a solution and ask yourself a lot of unanswered questions.",1399766400,11,2335,4.36027713625866

One thing I like about this film is that these are ordinary (looking and otherwise) people leading ordinary and routine lives, like the rest of us in non-cinematic life. Granted, most of us are not prostitutes.
One scene begins by showing Abby signing papers. My first thought was that she is signing divorce papers. She wasn't. That will be the subject of a future film, i.e., married gay people legally dissolving their union.
I puzzled over the name of the movie. I kept asking myself why Concussion? OK, this was the ""crowning"" event that convinced Abby she had to change her life, but that was all it was.

The main character, a partner in a lesbian marriage, is struck on the head by an errant toss at her son's baseball game.  The resultant concussion somehow clarifies her insight, and she comes to admit how barren of passion her relationship is.  Thus, she decides to seek employment as a lesbian escort, and thus embarks on a journey of self discovery.  Oh, there are some steamy moments, but there is a story here, with reasonably actualized characters who hurt, who experience both disappointment and revelation, and who ultimately achieve resolution.

5996202,3,B00FKPJ3VM,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 Robin Weigert stars as Abby, a bored suburban lesbian housewife who seeks to turn her sexual fantasies into reality. When she's hit in the head by accident by her son wielding a baseball bat, this appears to be the catalyst that propels her into a new life of sensuous abandon.

The concussion itself may be the catalyst but the real reason why Abby seeks to make changes in her life is because of the lack of passion in her relationship with her wife, Kate, an attorney who no longer seems to be interested in sex.

Abby tries two separate forays with prostitutes--the first a disaster, as the woman makes her feel dirty when they have sex. The second is the opposite: Gretchen, a young, sexy woman who's putting herself through school by servicing clients. Abby meets the latter through Jake, a young contractor who she's conscripted to work on her new avocation--renovating fixer-uppers in Manhattan for profit. Things go so well with Gretchen that Abby decides to turn tricks herself for $800 a pop, with the help of Jake, who finds various clients for her.

It does take a while before we break into Act Two when Abby sets off on her own, and often it's difficult to figure out who's who and what the characters are saying. This may due in part to director Stacie Passon's cinema verit style.

Once the protagonist begins meeting the clients, I would say what happens is mildly interesting. Abby has three main clients: an obese student who's never had sex before; a well-off middle-aged woman who at first leaves without engaging and a third woman, Sam (Maggie Siff), a bisexual woman who lives in Abby's neighborhood. The sex scenes are chaste in comparison to other 'art' films such as 'Blue is the Warmest Color' and here and there, Ms. Passon does a decent enough job of fleshing most of the characters out.

The scenes involving the couples' children were obviously inserted to show that Abby's forays into self-gratification were not her sole preoccupation. In fact, she comes across as an involved Mom, along with her significant other, despite their inescapable estrangement.

Passon's strategy perhaps is to illustrate her own fantasy life which is comprised of an active sex drive as well as a need to play therapist (Abby never sends away the inexperienced women who are in need of comforting).

Some may be put off by Abby's detachment but personally that didn't bother me at all. Overall, this is a professional made film with actors that deliver an air of assured verisimilitude. The slow pacing may be off-putting and the denouement is indecisive, but for those with the taste for it, you should find the film engaging. 'Concussion' indeed is a bit off-beat, but registers well in the pantheon of current art house indies.",1392681600,13,2786,4.811715481171548

I was pleasantly surprised to find it witty and poignant, as well as totally hot. I enjoyed this also because it's not the typical girl-meets-girl-and-falls-in-love story. It shows that lesbians can also fall into monotonous marriages and feel suffocated by suburban life and routines. I wish that there had been more background and character development before the ""concussion"", but you pick up enough along the way to get the context of Abby's life. The ending is slightly vague, but I found it refreshingly authentic in comparison to the tidy happy endings that I often see (or, as I said, the s***-storm disasters that conclude most lezzie movies). Absolutely worth a watch. I bought it so I could watch it again, and caught a few subtleties I'd missed the first time around. Love it!",1390953600,,989,5.111111111111111

5996215,4,B00FKPJ3VM,"In CONCUSSION, Robin Weigert plays an upper middle class suburban housewife with two kids who becomes bored with her monotonous life and, following an accidental blow to her head with a baseball, begins a secret existence as a prostitute.

In other movies with a similar plotline, the wife might not go as far as becoming a hooker, but she would instead become involved in an illicit affair.  However, what makes this film from writer-director Stacie Passon rather unique is that Weigert is married to another woman and all of her paid liaisons are with women of various ages.

CONCUSSION, frankly, is rather slow going, but its Weigerts multi-dimensional performance that makes this film worth watching.  She is a fascinating actress; certainly the equal of any other actress working in films todayand that includes the magnificent Meryl Streep.  Hopefully, she will get a vehicle one of these days that will allow her to breakout of episodic television and low budget features and prove that to the world.

Maggie Siff, Johnathan Tchaikovsky and Janel Moloney co-star in the film, which has been released onto DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment.

This movie is more psychological, which is more my type anyway.  Robin Weigert's character struggles with boredom and repetition her suburban life, and as she sells sex and tries to find ways out, this movie really questions how we build meaning.  What makes us feel?

It also is less about lesbians and more about human sexuality.  There's questions asked, ""what's it like for the first time in a long time?"", ""what makes us feel dirty?"", ""does age matter with desire?""  It's an excellent film.",1390176000,2,731,4.708661417322834

The story itself is disturbing but poignant.  More impressively, even though this centers on a lesbian married couple, the story itself is relevant to all married couples, not just lesbians.

The sex scenes aren't bad, but once again more disturbing than titillating.  Be aware that this is not a love story.  This is a human story, a ""life is sometimes difficult, naked, and ugly"" story.",1389744000,,555,4.913978494623656

First off the acting stinks across the board,there was a chance to fully flesh out these characters but I don't know if it was the script or the inexperience of the director that got in the way, and the cardinal sin this movie commits is that its simply not erotic, NOTHING ABOUT IT IS. No progression to the narrative whats so ever, its quite simply prententious crap indie filmmaking 101. Please do a netflix binge watch than waste your time on this garbage.

With the over exposure of everything under the sun thanks to Netflix, cable and Amazon Prime I have had a large variety of films in my scale of awful to excellent. The film centers on a woman in an unfulfilled marriage in the current stage of her life who ends up venturing outside the confines of her orderly world seeking passion that is currently lacking. I thought it was really interesting that her marriage was to another woman torching the old clich of bored housewife neglected by her husband. It illustrated that relationships are relationships with all the same potential pitfalls regardless of gender. I also liked how the movie portrayed the variety of clients and interaction with Abby. Definitely not a trail of clich characters. Just a great little movie for people interested in a study of relationships among friends, acquaintances, and lovers.",1388707200,2,1010,5.017857142857143

But apart from the above mentioned - the acting was damned good on Robin Weigert's part, and she alone kept it interesting for me. If it's a lesbian film ???? Have no idea. There were lesbians in it, but I found it to be overall a society tale of a certain class of Americans, and Jeezz what empty lives they are leading sitting there on there little bikes in the gym, sipping cocktails and joining all kinds of charities. As a European - I do not get this thing the US have about sexuallity. Eighter it has to be totally tabu - or down and dirty - I just don't get it. So - I made up my own ending to spice it up a bit.

5996240,3,B00FKPJ3VM,"... but it's not likely I'll watch it again.

The story opens with two lesbian moms rushing to the hospital as one's been hit in the head and is a bloody mess.  Somehow this injury is connected to Abby deciding she can't take a soccer mom existence and Lesbian Bed Death a moment longer.  Her girlfriend Kate is frigid.  She's fed up with the two young kids and is getting pretty snappy with them.  She seems to enjoy fixing up houses, but she just isn't fulfilled.  The root of her emptiness (as far as she's willing to consider) appears to be that she seriously needs to get laid.  For some reason she turns to prostitutes to solve the problem.  In doing so, she is recruited into the game herself and becomes a hooker.  Okay, okay.... high class call girl at $800 a pop.

Despite this premise don't expect 97 minutes of hot lesbian erotica... even if there are some graphic scenes.  This was a little cold and depressing.  Abby's desperation and inexplicable submission to her icy wife discouraged me from liking her.  I get that married people bind themselves with shared assets, pets, friends, and time etc etc... and often stay together for the wrong reasons.  I just have a hard time identifying with that kind of complacency.  I'd of liked more clarity on why Abby sticks around.  Moreover, I didn't find Abby attractive at all.  Physically or mentally.  So all I really saw was a cheating little weasel.  Worse, I never recovered from the first skank she beds- ACK.  That alone will make your libido shrivel if you're expecting hot fantasy.  Then enters her clientele... some very real and sad people.

A better story woulda had that pretty blonde pimp getting naked at some point with her call girls... and Kate's iciness resolved when she discovers some hot BDSM is what gets her off.  Lost opportunity...

Despite the lack of appeal for me... I found it an interesting look at Lesbian Bed Death and it's worth a watch if these themes don't make you freak. The acting wasn't even too bad.  And it didn't come off as a film school project.  Or a work of Nicole Conn.  It was pretty decently made for the genre as a matter of fact.  Nothing like the quality of, say, Imagine Me and You.  But watchable.  Better than the trailer suggested.  I just didn't find real character growth in the end and it just left me cold.  Abby never seemed to address the void other than inserting skanky sex with other bored or depressing women.  If that's the final sentiment on lesbians and long term relationships... sad, sad.  Since the DVD doesn't come with 3 cats and a vibrator (these leads sure ain't gonna keep ya warm!), I suggest renting.  I prefer more fantasy and happily ever afters myself.",1383264000,14,2694,4.588235294117647
5996241,5,B00FKPJ3VM,"Hey ""the girl"" can I get an appointment with Eleanor?

Lesbian movies don't have to be terrible! I see that now and it makes me so happy. Although this doesn't exactly have to be a lesbian story. It just happens to be a story that happens to a lesbian (with plenty of lesbian sex). The ""house wife"" could have easily been straight, but I think the clients probably...nope, this only works with female clients. I'm sure of that.  so some lesbianism required.

I love the ending! I can see how you might be disappointed if you were hoping for some sappy romantic ""off into the sunset"" deal, but I find myself hoping for the best for all the characters. I hope she keeps Sam or keeps her wife (but only with a new found appreciation for her! because you don't let that woman just sleep next to you every night and not...)  or both.

While watching I found myself laughing at times and at other times I felt so sorry for Abby. Robin Weigert (Abby) and Maggie Siff (Sam) are great in their roles and their 2nd love scene is outstanding. To me it seems to show a progression of their relationship from call girl and client to lovers.
My only disappointment was the ending, which is left to interpretation. You can easily choose the ending of your choice, however I would have preferred knowing that Abby found happiness and sexual fulfillment either with her spouse or with Sam. Surprisingly I was left hoping that Abby and Sam continue their love affair or even divorce their spouses and be together (I know).",1382572800,47,864,4.65359477124183

The writer/director based it loosely on her own life experience.  Robin Weigert and Maggie SIff were brilliant. The sex scenes were very realistic and tastefully done. The awkwardness, discomfort, desire,desperation,and starvation for human contact was visceral,disarming, and sometimes difficult to watch. The most moving,intimate, and physically- affecting encounter between Sam and Abby, shows very little other than their faces. Absolute brilliance by both actresses and the director to pull that off.
