5367467,4,B009SRWNV0,"A thinking person's movie. Requires attention and a sense of humor. Slow paced which helps make the funny bits jump out. Seemingly fraught with childlike depression, with the fear of stepping outside, the actress is great in bringing you into her endless abyss of a roomful of garbage and the men that interrupt her daily routine of sleep and TV and her pet goldfish.
With that in mind let the movie take you with it through her journey. For me, it was worth watching.",1454284800,7,468,4.583333333333333

5367469,3,B009SRWNV0,"Interesting but slow. A few good nude scenes, maybe 2. Takes some time to get into this but if you don't fall asleep, it does get better and has an interesting ending.",1412121600,6,167,4.25
5367470,1,B009SRWNV0,"The movie takes place in one room, and is not interesting. Would not recommend",1459209600,,78,4.642857142857143

5367476,3,B009SRWNV0,"I don't really know what to say about this movie, I almost stopped watching several times, but I am glad I made it to the end. Which is not a really happy ending (I think). This girl has some real issues to deal with, but refuses to see the world in which she is surrounded by. I watched with closed captions, so maybe somethings were lost in the translation. I dunno know. She had a couple of ""friends"" sorta, both seemed to use her for sex and not much else, and she seemed OK with that. Maybe that is the way it is. It is interesting in a different kind of way, probably worth watching, but be patient. You have to go the the end.",1456704000,4,633,4.072

5367483,4,B009SRWNV0,"Self-loathing hikikomori finds a novel Japanese stereotype way out in the end, with plot twists and surprises on the way there.  If you are inclined to despise yourself from time to time, watching the what-a-waste ghost get this nifty young woman could mitigate your self-hatred.",1455840000,3,279,5.2

8544152,4,B009SRWNV0,"Mostly, it had me feeling for the girl. She's beautiful. Resigned to what life was offering her. But not losing her self respect. Just very cynical. And living on the fringe of existence. I believe they walked down from that rooftop...together.",1521331200,,244,4.975609756097561
8544153,5,B009SRWNV0,Great movie.,1509926400,,12,5.5
8544154,4,B009SRWNV0,"If you're interested because you saw the word erotic and your dick took over, stop now and turn around. In fact, if you're into the superiority of Western Civilization at all don't bother. This is an interesting film that those who have flirted with the idea of becoming a shut-in will appreciate.",1503619200,2,297,4.730769230769231
8544155,4,B009SRWNV0,"A very Japanese movie. I can see how this might be puzzling for Americans. A very good movie for me, however.  I loved the social worker. Persistently, he pushes his point and then apologizes, pushes then apologizes. It is a very Japanese behavior. It is a sincere wish not to offend or harm and is honest and refreshing to the shut-in, compared to the young men that are his competition.",1503360000,,388,4.542857142857143
8544156,3,B009SRWNV0,"I agree with another poster.  Definitely a thinking person's movie.  Still, it had an interesting premise and ended well.",1499040000,,121,5.315789473684211
8544157,2,B009SRWNV0,"Erotically charged????  What part of this slow, boring, nothing-but-a-slob-of-a-woman-lying-in-bed-all-day, waste of time was erotically charged?

How anyone can give this film 3 or more stars, yet alone find it interesting, is beyond me.  There are some real HARD CORE film buffs out here, I rekon. :p",1496275200,,302,5.521739130434782
8544158,1,B009SRWNV0,Kind of slow and hard to follow,1466553600,,31,3.5714285714285716

8544160,5,B009SRWNV0,"I really liked this! It's mainly shot with one camera in one room. The story of a depressed,hopeless girl who only wants to sleep all the time gave me the feels.",1461283200,,161,4.225806451612903
8544161,5,B009SRWNV0,"Movie doesn't make a lot of sense, but I like it because it is strange. The girl character is hot. I kept watching it to see what would happen to her.",1459209600,,150,3.870967741935484
