1658602,5,B00005RT33,"The Happy Goodmans are a name synonymous with Gospel Music.  Very few groups of singers can electrify an audience just by walking to the stage, but the Goodmans have that ability.  They will be retiring from touring (Vestal will still sing solo) but this is both nostalgic and new at the same time.  You will feel like you are in your living room with friends as you listen to this. Get this video!",1005091200,11,398,4.424657534246576

1658609,5,B00005RT33,"These truly are Super Heroes of Southern Gospel. You can feel the love of God coming through them and reaching out to you. I love these people, they were truly sent on their path by the Lord!",1361923200,,191,4.1891891891891895
1658610,5,B00005RT33,"The Last Stand is, as I understand it, the Goodman's last concert.  Yep, they're old. But, they still can ""bring it.""  This is how Southern Gospel should be sung. . .great songs, wonderful harmony, singing from the heart. . . .which is the kind of music and singing we should be seeing and hearing in our Churches!  The real beauty of the Goodmans is that they brought a little bit of heaven to us, and showed us a little bit of what heaven will be like.  My life has been enriched by their love for the LORD and their down-home singing.  If you like good Southern Gospel, get this DVD and play it loud and play it often.  And if you do, you will get blest!

And ""push"" your Church to have Southern Gospel sung.  It's great music AND it is another way to preach the Gospel to your people during the services.

God bless you!

1658612,5,B00005RT33,"From the opening notes struck by Howard Goodman and then the full vocals of Vestal you know you are watching the best that Southern Gospel has to offer.  While some singers mellow with age the Happy Goodmans add depth and character to their performances.  Having seen a ""Homecoming Friends"" concert and the standing ovations they received it is obvious why this more personal setting for a show produces such a fine video.  My video arrived the day Howard Goodman completed his journey.  Even so, the music lifted my soul, that was their purpose.",1039478400,7,546,4.838709677419355
