8411492,3,B00400AQG4,"Sam Ramirez (Richard Collier) is a middle aged balding detective who can easily overpower men who are younger, larger, and armed. His wife (Kimberley Curran) is dying and has a last wish of drinking hot chocolate by the lake...it is winter, in most scenes. Sam is on a stakeout that goes bad. His partner gets killed, and Sam kills the brother of a crime boss. Sam takes a suitcase full of money too. There is a price on his head as he attempts to take his wife to the lake.

The cinematography looked like a 1980's direct to VHS film. The scenes changed from snow everywhere on the ground to no snow and bird's chirping. If you think the gun fire looked faked wait until to get the Nintendo style driving graphics. It was just so funny. The chase scene was incredibly faked. The film was so bad, I liked it.

8411494,1,B00400AQG4,"Dear sweet merciful Christ this film makes me want to consider suicide. It's absolutely horrible, but you will get a few laughs out of the awful production values and cringy dialogue.",1452038400,,183,4.935483870967742
8411495,3,B00400AQG4,"With no big star names on the box, I went into this movie with no expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed this film - don't get me wrong - production values are low, but this is no better or worse than the latest Steven Seagal movies - and they have huge sums of money. This is one of those movies that you'll either LOVE IT! or HATE IT!
