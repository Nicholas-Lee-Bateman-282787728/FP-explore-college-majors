313581,1,6301094999,"I was extremely upset with this DVD. I plan to write to Sony & the producers of this show. I find it unnecessary for the writers to use the word ""jerk"" to describe unruly kids in school. That's all I need my 3 year old to start calling people. What is this world coming to that these writers feel the need to put such foul language in a children's movie. My children will never watch this movie again. I wouldn't recommend this unless you don't mind your kids using the word ""jerk"" It was used more than once.",1003622400,6,509,4.204081632653061
313582,5,6301094999,"""Serpent and the Rainbow"" is a classic horror voodoo flick with a good dose of intrigue and mystery to keep the viewer guessing. Perhaps the highlight is Zakes Mokae brillant performance as the evil voodoo high priest Dr. Peytraud. He steals each and every scene that he's in. Bill Pullman is passable as the naive doctor searching Haiti for a magic drug that turns humans into zombies. With any Wes Craven film, there are plenty of spooky ""dream"" sequences were the lines between reality and the sub-conscious become blurred. This film should not serve as an introduction to the practices of voodoo, possession or zombies but just as a fun, scary film that should remind many of the B-movies of the 50's.",1000080000,4,705,4.786885245901639
313583,4,6301094999,"The person being refered to is Harvard Anthropologist Dr Dennis Alan (Bill Pullman) who is sent to Haiti by a pharmaceutical company to find and bring back to the US, a sample of the natural drug that is used in Voodoo to create Zombies. The company believes that such a drug could form the basis for a revolutionary new anaesthetic.
So far so good, but the book, of the same name, is better. The book is based on a true adventure by Wade Davis. Davis did find the natural poison, but unlike the movie it was not blown in his face, inducing paralysis, nor was he buried alive. But I'm running ahead of the story and the movie is quite good at what it is - a suspenseful, psychological, horror thriller.
Alan with the assistance of Marielle (Cathy Tyson) and a Voodoo priest Lucien Celine (Paul Winfield) starts his investigation. A lot happens quickly and most of it bad. Celine is a serious character and is there to highlight the importance of Voodoo as a religion and significant cultural facet of Haitian life. Dargent Peytraud (Zekes Mokae) on the other hand, as the evil Houngan priest and head of the 'Ton-Ton Macoutes' (secret police), is there for the horror effect. A role which he accomplishes with aplomb. There is a scene where Peytraud contorts his face into a sinister, smiling, frightfully evil countenance - an effect much more subtley scary and effective than any Wes Craven achieved later with spooks such as Freddy Kreuger and the ghoul in 'Scream'.
'Serpent & Rainbow' employs a variety of techniques for it's horror scenes. Alan had always been interested in hallucinatory drugs and from his earlier visits with South American shamans and now with his exposure in Haiti, he starts having visions - mystical at first then horrific. You would not want repeated visits from his dream Zombie! The visions show the psychological danger that he was in, but there were physical dangers as well. Paralyzed from the Zombie drug, Alan along with a large spider were placed in a coffin and buried alive. If the experience of a spider on your eyeball, with you immobilized and unable to get out of your cramped, earth-covered tomb does not send you insane, it will at the very least cure you of arachnaphobia and claustrophobia!
This is where the movie excells - plumbing the depths of some of our deeply held psychological fears. The fear is palpable and the increasing helplessness and desperation of Alan's situation is well acted out by Pullman. The ending which takes the form of a confrontation between Alan and Peytraud set against the overthrow of 'Baby Doc' Duvallier is rather weak and is the only blemish.",982800000,2,2626,4.760964912280702
313584,5,6301094999,This is a great DVD. The kids love the language learning (believe it or not) and we have been making a game out of learning Spanish around the  dinner table all started from watching this DVD...Keep it coming..,965779200,,210,4.526315789473684

313586,4,6301094999,"An interesting, yet far-fetched tale of black magic and political upheaval during the final days of the regime of Haiti's dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier is entertaining fare for any horror fan. An anthropologist  (Pullman) is sent to Haiti to investigate the mystery of that country's  zombies. There he gets himself involved in the chaos that erupts in the  world's oldest black republic in addition to discovering a world of black  magic that brings him more trouble than he expects.
Directed by  horror-king Wes Craven (""Scream""; ""Nightmare on Elm  Street""), the ""Serpent and The Rainbow,"" is partially based  on the novel by the same title by anthropologist Wade Davis. Unlike his  book, the film moves away from the books central theme and into a horror  movie only Hollywood could create. Although, a reviewer from the  neighboring Dominican Republic says that he totally agrees with the voodoo  theme of the film, he probably has read or done his research in  understanding the complexity of Haitian spiritualism.  Due to both  countries ongoing strife with one another, I would ignore such comments if  I were a newcomer to the topic, and read the book before watching this  film.
Having very scary scenes, including a live burial, and a final  battle with a the head voodoo master was great, but the film lacks the  authencity of a true story converted into a horror film (e.g.  ""Amityville Horror""). Regardless, this is a good film if you want  to take a glimpse of poverty-stricken Haiti and the severity of race and  politics on the western end of Hispaniola.",964915200,7,1570,4.961538461538462

313882,4,6301094999,"Watched this mostly to fill in a gap in my horror-film knowledge base, and didn't expect much. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is not to be confused with a factual primer on Haiti and its religion, but the story draws you in. Bill Pullman does particularly well with a role that could too easily have turned into either a) clueless arrogant American embarrasses himself a lot in a Third World culture, or b) noble intellectual American straightens out those superstitious natives in a Third World culture.

The special effects are a little distracting. They're very much in line with what you see in Craven's other films from this era, like ""Nightmare on Elm Street."" They're necessary in that they make this a horror film instead of just a tense drama. But sometimes the effects are too literal, too real-looking, to be taken seriously. I really would have liked to see Wes Craven do what Peter Jackson did in ""Heavenly Creatures"" and create vividly hallucinatory fantasia scenes.

Sidenote: The book ""Serpent and the Rainbow"" by Wade Davis, a Harvard ethnobotanist, is nothing like the movie but perhaps even more interesting. Not dry, really well written and interesting.",1470873600,,1181,4.98984771573604

313946,4,6301094999,"An underrated gem from Wes Craven's filmography, ""The Serpent and the Rainbow"" was based on a non-fiction book ethnobotanist Dennis Allen (Bill Pullman) goes to Haiti to research and find a drug that creates the effect that someone is dead even to well trained doctors. When the person recovers, they believe that they are zombies and back from the dead. Allen wants to study the drug for its possible medicinal effect. Allen faces resistance and Captain Peytraud (Zakes Mokae in a compelling and sinister performance) a member of the dreaded Tonton Macoute uses every bit of superstition to try and scare away Allen.

One of Craven's best made films, ""The Serpent and the Rainbow"" followed in the wake of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and didn't do quite as well at the box office due to the expectations set up by that film. Audiences came to see another ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" but what they got was a horror movie that was shot through with the political realities that Haiti faced during the revolution to free themselves from dictator ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier. There's a strong atmosphere of dread that hangs over the film like a massive cloud adding to the tension of Craven's film. For its time (and this point in Craven's career) ""The Serpent and the Rainbow"" was a daring move on the director's part.

The high def transfer looks nice and is fairly true (as I recall) to the theatrical exhibition of the film. The presentation is most probably the result of the cinematography choices of director Craven  The presentation is relatively clean and the interpositive used for this transfer looks quite nice.

The audio is very active and will pull you right in to what you see on screen. The DTS-HD Master Audio stereo soundtrack sounds excellent.

Shout Factory (under its Scream imprint) has done a very nice job of providing us with a deluxe edition for this classic film. Star Bill Pullman provides us with an entertaining and witty commentary track hosted by Rob Galluzzo. We also get an excellent 24 original featurette on the making of the film. Finally we get a stills gallery as well as a pair of trailers (theatrical and TV) for the film. While I would have liked to see this expanded to include a documentary on the history of voodoo and zombies (not the kind from ""The Walking Dead"" but the type from films like ""White Zombie"") as well as a featurette on the author of the non-fiction book the film was based on, what we do get is excellent.

This is a very good presentation from Shout Factory of an overlooked classic from Craven.

6.5/10

Never a dull moment, nice cinematography, with some very effectively shot scenes. Zakes Mokae crawls under your skin as a convincing statist voodoo villain. Although Bill Pulman shows more range than in any other roll I've seen him depict, his lead characterization is still much too smugly skating on the surface. I think a deep crevice of emotion was required, and Pulman a poor casting choice. While all the characters were rather shallow and failing to inspire much empathy,  the story narrative was fairly fascinating and aggressively nimble.

The crucial failure of the film was the cartoonish scattershot ending, out of step with the film's prior serious, realistic tone and cinematic visual effects. Was like Elm St' Dream Warriors breakdanced into The Exorcist. A more visceral and emotionally accessible lead, plus a more realistic stark ending would have solidified an otherwise solid effort.",1457827200,2,946,5.293333333333333

SF released Serpent & the rainbow as Collectors edition blu-ray
in my opinion it's definitely not a collectors blu-ray, no way
i have lots of collectors edition blu-ray's from scream factory
and the ones i have are loaded with new extras, lots of new interviews, behind the scenes footage etc
lots of stuff that are worth watching
this blu-ray definitetly is not mainly cause of the lack of extras, lack of cast & crew interviewed to be exact
all you get is a new retrospective featurette which is Great, i was expecting a new making of featurette of course
but there is only a few interviews in this featurette which i was pissed of about i was expecting more interviews that's why!
well on the back cover art it says news interviews with D.O.P John Lindley, Author Wade Davis, Actor Bill Pullman
 and special effects artists for the film Lance & David anderson and that's all you get in this 22mins featurette
well the above names are Definitely on camera interviews, except for Bill Pullman
the new Bill Pullman interview is bulls*** there is none
there is no visual on camera interview with Bill Pullman which is the Highlight of the film
man was i pissed off, there's also no new interviews with Producers David Ladd or Doug Claybourne
or actors Paul winfield or Cathy Tyson, ridiculous i feel betrayed as a fan of the film for sure
however Bill Pullman does do a audio commentary for the film which is very informative & worth listening to
so i guess that's something', a on camera interview would've better for sure
SF lied about that on their back cover pathetic
SF did do one thing right with this film give a new HD transfer in 1:85:1 ratio & new Master audio stereo mix
which does look excellent very nice sharp & clear picture, better than the old dvd version
the sound mix has been boosted up to 2.0 Stereo mix, the dvd only had Mono
there's also the usual Theatrical trailer, Photo stills Gallery but that's it
so what's missing from this collectors edition, well no behind the scenes footage,
no on set interviews from the cast or crew from 1987 when the film was made
no tribute featurette to Wes craven which is insulting
i Definitely expected more from scream factory to make an actual collectors edition of this film
not a standard blu-ray reissue, man do i feel disrespected
2-3 stars for this based on new HD transfer & new sound mix,
not enough cast & crew interviews about the film, no tribute to wes craven, no behind the scenes footage
that is why i gave it low star rating, there should've been more cast & crew interviews for a collectors release, what bulls***!

314240,5,6301094999,"The Serpent and the Rainbow
 In Voodoo the Rainbow represents Heaven, the Serpent represents the Earth.  We exist in the in between.  If we live in Haiti, we are in Hell.  Someone once asked Yogi Berra, also a movie critic, if scary movies scared him.  He replied Only the scary ones.  Serpent and the Rainbow certainly qualifies.  It scared the pants off me.
 Bill Pullman, young in this 1988 film, finds himself over his head in Haiti looking for the powder that turns men into Zombies.  His pharmaceutical company employer thinks the powder has potential as a legitimate anesthetic. The movie closely follows the true tale related in the book of the same name.
 The setting is scary all by itself.  Pullman has been sent to Haiti just in time to be swept up in the turmoil at the end of Baby Doc Duvaliers reign of terror.  Veteran South African actor Zakes Mokae plays the head of the dreaded Ton Ton Macau, the secret police.  The Ton Ton used Voodoo to terrorize the population into passivity.  Pullman,  aided by a lovely doctor (Cathy Tyson) and a revolutionary night club owner (Paul Winfield) gets badly mixed up with the secret police.  What happens to him while in the sadistic hands of the very sinister and truly frightening Mokae gave me my moneys worth of fright.  Burrrrr.
 Four big bleeding brains for this R rated true Zombie tale. The excellent cast and fine acting brings this one into the realm of real movies, not the usual low budget dreck that we too often fine.  It still wigs me out to think that people are even today enslaved as Zombies by Voodoo practitioners.
 This may well be the most artistically successful of all of Wes Cravens many films.  He manages to invoke an atmosphere of terror without delving into the outer reaches of slime and gore.  This very effective film runs only one hour and 38 minutes.",1429315200,,1840,4.614197530864198

314243,2,6301094999,"In 1988s The Serpent and the Rainbow Bill Pullman plays an anthropologist who goes to Haiti to investigate a rumored drug that can make people seem dead, but they're really not. In other words, the plot addresses the reality behind the zombie myth. The storys supposedly based (loosely) on factual material contained in Wade Davis book.

Davis reportedly wanted noted director Peter Weir to direct the film, but he got stuck with horror maestro Wes Craven. Wes is great for cartoony horror flicks, like ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and the ""Scream"" series, but he was apparently out of his league here. I hate giving bad reviews to movies because I realize no one intends to make a bad film. Making decent movies is expensive and takes a lot of work by scores of talented people. ""The Serpent and the Rainbow"" had the funds, talent, locations and music to make a quality film, but it horribly fails.

Over the years it's taken me four attempts just to get past the 20-40 minute mark. I finally forced myself to watch the entire film last night and it was a chore. It starts out intriguing, but immediately fails to engross. The story's fine, but the way it's told is bad, which includes the puzzling editing. It's incoherent and you soon find yourself bored watching interesting images and cool percussion-oriented music, but characters and a tale you don't care about, mainly because you were never allowed to comprehend it.

There's a shallow love story with the requisite beautiful native (Cathy Tyson) and the second act gets a little better with Brent Jennings as Mozart, but the third act spirals into to ultra-horror cheese. Some scenes are so ridiculously bad they're laugh-out-loud funny. For instance, a classy white woman suddenly jumps on the dinner table radically attacking the anthropologist; a torture-chair moves across the room by itself on a couple occasions; someone's head falls off; a scorpion walks out of someone's mouth; something alien and diabolic comes out of someone else's mouth (or head); etc. On top of this, there are so many dream/hallucination sequences that they become tedious. These scenes were obviously included to up the ante with horror props and  hopefully  jolt the audience, but they utterly fail because, after a while, you suspect that what's going on isn't really happening and it's hard to be scared by illusions. Most of the time, they just make you laugh, like the (supposedly) creepy hand coming out of the soup (rolling my eyes). Don't get me wrong, scenes like these CAN work in horror films, but they have to be done right and in the right context, which isn't the case here, unfortunately.

The only reason I'm not giving it an ""F"" is because of the positives noted above.

The film runs 98 minutes and was shot in Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Boston.

This probably isn't the movie to watch with someone who is sensitive to violence/torture/murder/horror, or someone with heart problems, but for those who don't mind a rollercoaster ride of the whole spectrum of ups and downs, this one's a thriller.  I should add that the darker content of this movie is not done in the modern style where it's meant to titilate or excite today's sadistic moviergoers, but more closely resembles genuine horror and suspense.

The supernatural themes of the movie are intriguing, and the beautifully crafted cinematics and environments can really suck the viewer into the story.

He eventually befriends and becomes close with a beautiful Haitian doctor by the name of Marielle who enlists him in his investigation for the drug.

Alan's investigation eventually raises the eyebrow Captain Dargent Peytraud, the powerful and ruthless leader of the Tonton Macoute who doesn't want Alan investigating and has Alan arrested and warns him to leave the country. Alan refuses and later confronts local witch doctor, Mozart who claims to be able to make the drug. Alan causes a scene however after he punks out Mozart for selling him a fake instead of the real drug. As a result, Alan attracts even more attention to himself and finds himself thrown into a deadly war against the evil voodoo master, Peytraud who wants to use his voodoo rituals to put Alan 6 feet under and own his soul, forever

Overall: The Serpent and the Rainbow is one of the creepiest horror films I've ever seen. Not scary but very creepy. I had no idea this movie ever even existed until someone recently mentioned it and it turned out to be a great movie. In a way this movie stands out on its own because it explores the real life world of religion, voodoo, spirits, supernatural, etc, etc. Depending upon your beliefs in the supernatural and religion, you may actually find this film to very interesting. Very original plot for its time! Another thing I love is that not very many computer effects are used for this. I notice that a lot of 80s films, especially 80s horror films, used computer graphics for effects as computers were becoming a big thing in the mid-late 80s. But in this movie, they use makeup, dirt, and such other things to make their extraordinary effects.

It is about a man named Dennis Alan who is doing research in Haiti. He learns about a powder called the ''zombie powder''. It is called that because of the zombie-like effect it has on the body when it is blown in a person's face. Throughout the movie, he is being tormented by a Haitian man named Peytraud. Peytraud uses Voodoo magic to give Dennis terrifying nightmares, because he wants Dennis to leave the country. He even warns Dennis in person at one point to leave the country and stop butting in to their business. Dennis ends up falling in love with a woman in that country named Marielle. At one point, Dennis steals the powder, and goes back to America. During dinner with his employer, Peytraud uses Voodoo magic to possess the wife of Dennis's employer. She grabs a knife and tries to kill him, saying to him in Peytraud's voice ''You're going to die''. She then slashes him in the face. Dennis is freaked out and flies back to Haiti to try to stop Peytraud.

For a programmer (B or second level, budget conscious, film) it comes off as one worth watching (if your are not expecting 70 million  dollar pyrotechnics). The acting is acceptable, the Magic spells pretty much what we were accustomed to in the ""olden"" days, and the story a bit naive but bearable. (While I am not a Harvard graduate, I tend to the notion that their Anthropology doctorates are required to have just a bit more common sense and savvy about the realities of politics than is possessed by  the Pullman character.) Naturally, any viewer of a voodoo picture has, by assumption, bought in to the notion that there are walking dead and that a steel spike driven through the scrotum in a torture chamber is something you will get over in a day or so, and the repetition of which doesn't make you think twice about your future.

Here's the scoop. Bill Pullman plays a professor in Pharmacology who is sent to Haiti to grab a local drug that might help eliminate operating room deaths that are due to bad reactions to anesthesia. Haiti is in the throes of revolution and the bad guys are using the drug to kill people.....sort of. It makes the victim appear dead but said victim is revived some 12 hours later to do the bidding of the bad guys. Pullman has a heck of a time accessing the narcotic and an even worse time getting out of Haiti in one piece.

As others have mentioned, this has little to do with the book from which it was derived but it's still a good ride. There's a bit of ""Altered States"" and ""Carlos Castenada"" in here as a backdrop. And using the impending revolution as an underpinning was a good move. It adds a sense of malevolence and unrest throughout. There are a couple of cheap thrills but very few. This is just a smarter, creepier movie relying a lot on nuance.

This is one of Pullman's earliest movies but you see some of the earmarks that would be present throughout his career. Zakes Mokae, Brent Jennings and Paul Winfield all do decent jobs. Michael Gough and Paul Guilfoyle are decent enough though their parts are small. This is shot well, directed and cut well. The music is decent as are the effects. The climax had a climax that I could have done without but by then the movie was over so I have to let it pass.

314582,4,6301094999,"The word zombies conjures up the flesh-eating variety popularized by George Romero's horror films and the legion of films from others soon after. Prior to 1968's Night of the Living Dead the word zombies was synonymous more with the gothic-like horror films which took the Haitian voodoo folklore about the recently dead being brought back to life by voodoo priests to act as mindless slaves. It's this version of the word zombie which Wes Craven decided to explore with his 1988 film adaptation of the Wade Davis non-fiction book The Serpent and The Rainbow. Wes Craven's film fictionalizes the ideas and treatises put forward in Davis' book and creates a film which tries to put to light the true horror which lay behind the voodoo folklore regarding zombies.

The film introduces us to the ethnobotanist character of Dennis Alan (played by Bill Pullman) who's approached by a major pharma-corporation about researching the scientific origins and cause of the voodoo ""zombie"". He heads off to Haiti at a time when it's going through a political upheaval that would lead to the subsequent revolution that topples the dictatorship of that country's leader, Francois ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier. During his time in Haiti he investigates story of a patient named Christophe who was reported dead 8 years past but seen recently walking about in a dazed manner. It's while trying to get a handle on how Christophe was declared dead by authorities but then ""resurrected"" years later which brings Alan in contact with the local witch doctors who question Alan's motives but also ridicule him for his narrow viewpoint regarding things which science cannot answer. But through persistence he finally gets one local to assist him in procuring the so-called ""zombie powder"" used to bring the dead back to life.

The Serpent and The Rainbow shows the real horror about zombification when Alan's investigations and persistence to acquire the ""zombie powder"" brings the attention of the country's secret police (the Tonton Macoutes) and one of it's leaders and reported voodoo priest in Captain Dargent Peytraud (played by Zakes Mokae in a chilling performance) who warns him repeatedly not to continue. Repeated verbal warning and threats soon become more direct and physical as Alan finds out first-hand why no one in the country dares to speak of ""zombies"" to an outsider and why Captain Peytraud and his Tonton Macoutes were feared as if they were agents of the evil spirits of their voodoo faith.

Craven does a very good job in taking Wade Davis' non-fiction book and creating a thrilling and suspenseful piece of horror which suggests that the lead character of Dennis Alan has stepped into a world that was steeped not just in the realm of science but also in the supernatural. The film includes some great scenes which shows Alan experiencing some very horrific nightmares which seems indistinguishable from his waking moments and vice versa. Unlike Craven's previous work in horror which were imbued with some dark humor but always brutal in it's depiction of everyday horror, this film rarely goes the gory route though the scenes of torture should make even the most hardened and jaded horror aficionado to squirm in their seat.

The true horror revealed by Craven's film is the very human figure of Captain Peytraud and his Tonton Macoutes who use the local populace's fear of ""zombification"" and how Peytraud has taken advantage of these people's voodoo beliefs to control the public and keep themselves in power. It's horror that many recognize and understand yet heightened even more with the addition of a local religious practice that's relatively unknown and misunderstood by outsiders (especially by those in the West). The film never truly answers the question raised in the beginning of the film of whether the practice of ""zombification"" is wholly scientific and pharmacological in origins and cause or does religion and the supernatural has a hand in making the process occur. Even after the climactic encounter between Alan and Captain Peytraud in the end of the film only brings more questions which Craven seems to relish in not letting his film answer on either side of the discussion.

The Serpent and The Rainbow is one of those films during the 1980's which never really got a fair shake from critics and the audience but has since gained quite a following in the years since it's release. It's actually one of Craven's more subtle works during that period of time where violence in the film was the exception instead of the rule as in his past films. It's a film which continues to gain fans as more and more younger film fans discover the film. Sometimes the word zombies doesn't conjure up the typical flesh-eating variety but instead one even more horrific since it's one based on real-life. Sometimes reality can be scarier than what we can conjure up in our minds. The Serpent and The Rainbow is one film which does a great job in supporting that.",1318464000,,4963,4.974698795180723

314586,4,6301094999,"Wes Craven hit his mark with this movie. He invokes the ""based upon truthful facts"" motif and adds in conventional supernatural scares and effects. He made a totally original, fast moving movie, and emotionally movie picture (where you empathize with the main character).

The movie is a serious attempt at examining Haitian Voodoo and the use of toxins to make somebody think their dead and transform them into submissive zombies. An Ivy League professor attempts to scholarly investigate this ages- old practice (he thinks it should be legitimately used im a medical manner) and must go ""undergound"" and deal with scary and lurking characters to get access to the information and ingredients. All of this during the overthrough of Haiti's ""Baby Doc"" dictatorship so the political climate is just as threatening as the Voodoo element.

This is 1980's movie has some truly scary parts in it. The horror involves more the reality of being drugged, left for dead and actually knowing about it, as opposed to conventional scares with gore or lurking killers. Bill Pullman is terrific as the Harvard professor who goes ""too far"".

Because this movie came out close to the time of Wes Craven's ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", he utilizes the ""is this reality or not""  scenes which are decently effecttive in this movie.

The movie is an excellent horror film and stands up well out of the horror genre as well since the subject matter and way it's presented is very captivating.

The only problem with the film is in it's ending. The movie goes from being a fascinating, somewhat rooted in fact premise, to all of a sudden ""everything but the kitchen sink"" is thrown in to just create a stereotypcial, Hollywood melodramatic ending. The ending is quite disappointing simply because the rest of the movie is so [seemingly] credible. It's as though the makers had a great idea for a premise for a movie yet, they did not know whert to take that premise and affix a climax to it. Because of the time that it came out, there's also a bit of 80's hokiness as well.

Nonetheless, the flawed ending does not totally take away from holistically looking at this movie and concluding that it is far above most of the other films in the genre. After the first ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", this is by far Craven's best work.",1295395200,,2300,4.778337531486146

314660,2,6301094999,"What a disappointment. If you think Serpent and the Rainbow is to Haitian Voodoo what the Wicker Man was to modern Wicca, then boy are you in for a big letdown.

In the book, Wade Davis described how he got much more than he bargained for when he decided to go to Haiti in search of the formula for a mysterious powder which turns people into zombies. Davis got his formula, but he also documented the way in which the zombie phenomenon is only a part of a much wider theological perspective within the Voodoo religion. As such, he unraveled the mystery in terms which can make sense to most Americans.

The film delivers none of this. It is more concerned with special effects than being faithful to the book, and it puts the main character in the awkward position of getting stuck in a Third World country during a time of political upheaval. By the way, the villain is portrayed as a warlord who also happens to be a Voodoo priest.

314662,5,6301094999,"The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988) is a sci-fi, mystical, pagan movie
based on the culture of Haiti done in an outstanding manner, more so
for a movie completed with the technology of that time.

In the European and American nations, little is known about Haiti
than its economical history, such as the triangular trade and its
Carribean Island location.

This story will change all that. Those involved in this project are
incredibly talented: script, editing, special effects, costumes,
coordination of the extras, etc.

The quality of the DVD transfer is glossy and crystal clear,  and the
audio is done to perfection as well, music, chanting, singing, songs,
etc. The picture is wide-screen, as well.

The actors often are too easily underestimated, for some reason or
other but here, they really pull through, taking the picture up
another notch. Bill Pullman as Dennis -  just another ""American""
tourist, wearing a T-Shirt, jeans -  only this time, mandated by his
employer, a pharma company, to retrieve samples of a narcotic rumored
to be used in Haiti by the Tonton Macoutes chief of police. It is
also associated with Voodoo mystical rituals  and with torture
techniques, mind control experiments, and more to repress political
dissidents, persona non grata, enemies and the unwelcome. Pullman has
to separate the fact from fiction.

Zakes Mokae masterfully plays Peytraud, the Macoutes police boss,
leading a double life as the underground voodoo shaman or godfather,
on the negative side.

Paul Winfield is Lucien, on the positive side, whno uses his
influence, knowledge, and training for the good and healing of the
same population.

The symbology is explained somewhat, with python snakes, rainbow,
tarantulas, funerals, the use of insect blood, skeletons, and others.

The filming sets are tightly focused on the story, strictly
controlling the street, hotel, and the landscape scenes, to only
further the film and its story, vs. any potential distraction.

Remarkable events happen to Pullman on the island, as his jaded,
atheistic, dismissive and Wall St Journal view of what his trip will
be about, is turned on its head, as he becomes the object of
strong-arm tactics by Moake for not heeding warnings, related to
straying from his tourist visa. Not even after submitting to torture
interrogation at one point, and getting involved with dissidents who
were administered the narcotic Tetrodotoxin, and the TonTon's mind
control (such as being buried alive) does  the American stop.  He
further gets romantically involved with his business contact on the
island, (Cathy Tyson.)

Some of the sets would naturally trigger a panic from city slickers,
if visiting the  Rain Forests of the Amazon or the jungles of Haiti,
if falling down a 30 foot deep pit, or if confronted by a tiger. This
is double so, when facing voodoo as a belief system, not knowing its
rules, much less its intricacies and those believing it.

As stated, Mokae's character is deeply involved with the occult, and
psychologically manipulates victims, implanting hallucinations,
flashbacks, over 12 hour drug trips, imprinting massive fear in the
victims. They are convinced that taking them out would be an
inconsequential matter, as suggested by the piles of skulls in a
dungeon, located under the interrogation room.

The compound's preparation is apparently owed to the voodoo shamen,
over many generations, requiring the Bufo Marinus sea toad fish, sea
worm, puffer fish, skeleton bones, fire, various rituals, and is
explained and played well by Brent Jennings's ""Bokor"" character.

Some parts seem accessory to the storyline, such as the lighting of
500 candles in the middle of a tall and dense jungle, the
sleep-walking skeleton,the swimming and diving at a waterfall, name
dropping Lucrezia Borgia, etc.

The staging of a murder, to incriminate Pullman's character to gain
leverage is not unheard of, in cult of personality regimes.

Some of the special effects are extraordinarily well done, such as
when adversaries are thrown against the wall, the masterful filming
in very little light, with total clarity, the high-end picture
quality, etc.

In sum, this movie is definately something for sci-fi fans, and for
everyone.",1264896000,,4220,5.210059171597633

This film has very good acting, incredible atmosphere (it's shot on location in Haiti), and incredible tension.  Craven doesn't go for cheap laughs here.  He takes his subject very seriously, and doesn't make light of it.  There's no self consciousness or the self referentialness of his latter Scream movies.  Craven has said that strange phenomena happened during the shooting of this film to those in the crew who mocked the idea of the native religion, but Craven respected it deeply and nothing unique happened to him.  I've always had mixed feelings about Craven, liking this film, liking some others (Last House on the Left, the original The Hills Have Eyes), and hating others (I was never a fan of the Nightmare on Elm Street, and I hate self referential films like Scream in general, but Craven didn't write the script).

Loosely based on a true story and a book by Wade Davis, this is a very fascinating and strange film from Wes Craven that is one of his most underrated movies yet. He makes a non-traditional zombie movie in the ""E.C. Comics"" mode and explores the secrets of vooodoo with the myth behind bringing the dead back to life. It also has the tradition of a classic Hammer film including masterpieces like ""White Zombie"" to it, Bill Pullman was ahead of his time making a good performance as the anthropologist. The movie has some intense and memorable moments such as the ""I want to hear you scream"" sequence which will make male viewers cringe, the make-up effects are alright and the storyline is quite solid.

Once he returns to the States he is hired by a desperate drug company to return to Haiti and find a plant that is supposed to bring the dead back to life.

The main problem I have with this film is the direction by Wes Craven. He hasn't quite grasped the fact that sometimes the scariest moments don't come from special effects. This movie should work, and it should work very well. It doesn't. Even though Craven was given a better than average screenplay to work from, from an even better novel, he messes up every chance he has to truly bring this film to the next level.

While better than your average horror film it could have been great. A classic even. Bill Pullman gives us a great performance as he usually does.

Nothing wrong with that, of course, it's just that the book and film share a title and not much else.  That said, the movie has more going for it than against it, and I would recommend it (but not for the kiddies).  The greatest strength of the movie is the performance by Zakes Mokae as the sadistic chief of Haiti's not-so-secret police. It would take someone more eloquent than I to describe it. Just believe me when I tell you that you won't forget it anytime soon after. It's not often that I find myself grinding my teeth during a movie that I know is fiction, but this performance did just that. I understand Mr. Mokae lives in Nevada now. In the unlikely event that he should read this review, I wish to thank him for a splendid, if disturbing, performance. The cinematography is really quite good with some truly creepy scenes rendered, and the plot and dialog are fine.  There are two factors that work against the film.  The first is Bill Pullman, playing the Harvard researcher. I don't intend any offense towards Mr. Pullman nor his fans. However, he just doesn't seem right for so many of the parts in which he is cast, such as the President in Independence Day, and here. His overall demeanor just doesn't convey ""Ph. D. field researcher"". The other significant fault is the descent of the storyline into near ridiculous fantasy in the closing scenes.  It's quite similar to The Abyss in this regard. Some reviewers seem to have issues with Eurocentrism and racial implications within the film.  I personally didn't consider anything I saw out of order, but this is a very subjective area in my estimation, and others could very well see things differently.

The acting is altogether first-rate.  Not a weak performance in the lot (though Bill Pullman is not the best of the group).
It's visually fascinating, engrossing, and just enough grounded in reality ... until an ending that is both rushed and almost comical.  I don't to ruin it, and you really should watch it--if for no other reason than to speculate about how you might have ended the movie.",1082592000,4,849,5.071942446043166
314788,4,6301094999,"Though not nearly as famous as ""Scream"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", this is possibly Craven's best film. It isn't a terrifying movie but is a spooky film with a smart, well written story. This is one of Bill Pullman's earliest roles (first time I'd seen him) and he does a great job as a scientist sent to Haiti by a pharmaceutical firm to research the medicinal potential of a mysterious powder known to plunge people into a temporary deathlike state. The story effectively touches many different topics (life under the Duvalier regime, profiteering drug companies, religion, the supernatural...) without overdoing any of them. This is a diamond in the rough. You'll get more enjoyment out of it than you expect. Always a nice situation.",1080777600,5,740,4.928
314789,4,6301094999,"Making an attempt to legitimize a horror film, Wes Craven adapted the best selling true life account by Wade Davis into this creepy horror romp.  When a Harvard researcher (Bill Pullman) travels to Haiti to find a mysterious voodoo powder which can put anyone whom it is given to in a state of perpetual death, he gets way, way in over his head as he tries to uncover the mysteries behind the black magic.  Craven manages to play with the viewer's psychological fears (including arachnophobia and claustrophobia as Pullman is buried alive with a huge tarantula crawling all over him) while inducing a few visceral thrills as well, but The Serpent & The Rainbow is definitely one of Craven's best films thanks to the realistic touch given to the film and Pullman's superb performance.  Just like Universal's recent horror DVD re-releases, The Serpent & The Rainbow is devoid of any extras whatsoever, not even a trailer.",1075248000,2,919,4.878205128205129
314790,3,6301094999,"Based on a true story, Dennis Allan (Bill Pullman) is a scientist who visits Haiti because of a rumour of a drug which renders the recepient completely paralyzed but conscious. The drug's effects often fool doctors, who declare the victims dead. He believes this to be the origin of the zombie legend.  Allan embarks on a surprising and often surreal investigation of the turbulent social chaos that is Haiti during the revolution which ousted hated dictator Papa Doc.  Allan must decide what is science, what is superstition and what is the unknown in a anarchistic society where police corruption and witch-doctors are commonplace.",1069113600,2,633,5.135922330097087
314791,4,6301094999,"""The Serpent and the Rainbow"" is one of the many horror titles that Universal has re-released on DVD recently.  All of these films (Demon Knight, Prince of Darkness, etc.) have a large underground following, yet none were box office successes.  This unfortunately means that there are no glorious extras on any of these DVDs. I guess we're just lucky to be able to buy them at all, after the DVDs have been out of print for quite a few years.
Briefly, the story is about an anthropologist, Dennis Alan, who is sent to Haiti by a pharmaceutical company to bring back a ""Zombie drug"" which may have applications in the medical field.  In order to get the drug, Dr. Alan has to immerse himself in the political and cultural world of Haiti and voodoo.  When I was younger, ""Serpent"" was one of the most frightening horror movies available.  This was mostly due to the feeling of reality in the film; also, being set (and I believe filmed) in Haiti added to the feelings of unrest the viewer feels throughout.  The protagonist approaches the events he experiences from a mind of science, so when unbelievable things happen to him, it all seems more real.
Watching the film now, about +15 years after it's release, it's not quite as good as I remember.  The editing is terrible.  Every scene feels like you walked in half way through a really interesting conversation.  The viewer can easily understand what is going on, but the sometimes rapid scene and plot changes are a little unstable and feel a little disjointed.  Still, once the film got going, into the meat, it was as good as I remembered.  The ""Chair"", The ""Snake Bride"", ""I want to hear you scream"", etc. *shiver*  All those scenes were still making me squirm and jump.
The Transfer: Audio:  It's in ""dolby stereo"", so make sure NOT to watch it in 5.1, because you won't hear the dialogue if you do.  I use my DVD player as a CD player, so I switched over to the ""Stereo/CD"" selection on my receiver and the movie sounded beautifully.  It wasn't filmed in 5.1, so this didn't bother me.  Video:  The video transfer is terrible.  I got used to it after about 5 minutes, but it basically looks slightly better than watching a video tape.  Even though it's a little dating feeling, for the price, I feel it is still worth buying this movie if you loved it in the past; or at least worth renting it if you've never seen it.",1068163200,4,2375,4.519906323185012
314792,4,6301094999,"Before venerable horror maven Wes Craven directed the highly acclaimed SCREAM trilogy, many serious and critical fans of horror cinema considered THE SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW to be his masterpiece.  Not only is the direction tight and top-notch, but the acting is superb--Bill Pullman and Cathy Tyson are quite convincing as the endagered principals, with excellent character actors like Paul Winfield, Zakes Mokae, and Paul Guilfoyle fleshing out a wonderful supporting cast--and the story is sufficiently tense and creepy.  It is one of the few horror films to deal with voodoo practices in a serious and non-condescending manner, often compared by film critics and historians to Jacques Tourneur's classic voodoo flick I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE (1943).
Much ado has been made concerning the uneveness of this effort from Craven, particularly how the film supposedly jumps back and forth between horror and straight drama.  However, these inaccurate interpretations likely stem from a misunderstanding of Craven's use of his source material, anthropologist E. wade Davis' non-fictional book THE SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW.  It is true that Craven and his scriptwriters were INSPIRED by the book--which is a TRUE account of Davis' infiltration of Haiti's voodoo culture in search of a plant-based sedative reputedly used to create ""zombies""--but the plot of the film is NOT, as many believe, a visual retelling of the book.  This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the main character, ethnobotanist Dennis Alan (excellently played by Bill Pullman), is not named after the author of the aforementioned book.  Add to this the film's numerous supernatural and magical plot elements and it should be easy to comprehend that this is indeed a FICTIONAL horror film.
That said, it could be cogently argued that with THE SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW, Craven was attempting to recreate the realistic and austere timbre of his earlier horror films like THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and THE HILLS HAVE EYES.  As Craven himself has stated in many interviews, he and his crew did indeed face many real dangers when filming THE SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW in Haiti and the Dominican Republic--there was political unrest in Haiti at the time, and voodoo practioners were often vehemently private or secretive--and this risky on-location shooting most certainly helped to create an eerie atomosphere and added an amazing sense of reality and credibility to the film's preternatural voodoo sequences.  Of course, such realism makes it easier for the viewer to suspend disbelief, and this, combined with the non-fictional ""source"" material, could explain why some viewers find it hard determine if the movie is a docu-drama or a horror flick.  But for the true horror aficionado, and especially for long-time fans of Wes Craven, it is this gritty slice-of-life approach that has propelled the director to the top of the genre.
THE SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW is a great horror film, both believable and downright scary in its semi-authentic depiction of voodoo practices and rituals in the West Indies.  Though it is often wrongly neglected or disparaged by casual audiences, a viewing will earn the film a revered spot in the collection of any serious fan of cinematic horror.  And it's a must-own for Wes Craven fans.",1067299200,52,3283,5.175471698113207
