8750165,4,B01BHCPQT4,"In their last season,  our four leading ladies are doing plenty of exploring and making commitments to the next stages of their lives.  Jo and Blair both make early career starts at a local community shelter (Blair as owner, and Jo as a social worker), which ties into many of this season's anecdotes, including new serious love involvements for both girls.  Much of the season focuses on all four ladies' committed romantic relationships.  We finally meet Natalie's truck driver, Snake, who is quite the opposite of Tootie's longtime beau, Jeff, which creates some tension between the girls.  The next stage in these relationships is different for each woman, as they learn that not all successful relationships go down the same path.

The house is stretched to its limits when Pippa, an Eastland foreign exchange student moves in.  The added character does connect the show back to its Eastland roots, and we actually see Pippa don the coveted Eastland uniform that has been out of the show's wardrobe for several seasons.  Also Pippa creates a sister-like relationship with Andy, as they share camaraderie as the young teenagers in the house.  Her role is small, and quite honestly, stretches the show's writing thin, as well.

The store is only seen in one episode, midway through the season when it is implied that the store will close for good.  Otherwise, the store is completely forgotten and abandoned this season.  Though two new parts of the set are added-- one being the house kitchen (which must have been remodeled after Edna's Edibles burnt down), and the other being Natalie and Tootie's room in the attic (which was ""created"" last season, but never revealed).

Among the heavy issues this season are sex, marriage, suicidal coworkers, lost baby sisters, Blair's car accident, and Natalie moving to Soho.  While I believe it was smart for the writers to make the end of the series focus on Eastland's next era of students and thus creating a circle story of the series, it is a bit disappointing not to see more of our main characters in the last two-part episode. It seems like there was an episode never written with the girls all saying their final goodbyes to each other and the house.  In a way, we are already left missing our leading ladies with the final episode's main focus on current Eastland students, with only the final scene bringing us back to the house and most of our main cast.",1530230400,,2412,4.820388349514563

8750167,4,B01BHCPQT4,"Finally my collection of The Facts of Life is complete after many years of waiting.  Unfortunately I only gave 4 stars because there's no more seasons,  it was missing The Facts of Life Down Under movie,  in order to get that movie special u have to buy the complete series which is a little costly.  Also this season is just not as great as the other seasons but still a great show",1522972800,,382,4.263888888888889
8750168,5,B01BHCPQT4,This was a great dvd. I grew up watching this show and was very impressed by the girls and Mrs. Garrett's life lessons. The last season was not the best but it was not bad either. I did miss Mrs. Garrett not coming back for Jo's wedding or to see Blair buy the Eastland School. I loved the series and would highly recommend it.,1519689600,,327,4.125
8750169,4,B01BHCPQT4,"In this 1987-88 Season; Blair Warner (Lisa Whelchel), Natalie Green(Mindy Cohn), Tootie Ramsey (Kim Fields) and Jo Polniaczek (Nancy McKeon) launch into adulthood in it's 9th and Final Season of its 9-year run on NBC.
The girls from Eastland are no longer girls, facing the challenges of young adulthood (including marriage, work, and their very different future goals) the 4 ladies seem destined to go their separate ways and leave their longtime home in Peekskill, but when Eastland School For Girls is threatened with closure, Blair takes steps to save the place where their unshakeable friendship all started.
Meanwhile, you can add to your collection of one of the 1980s memorable and longest-running sitcoms with The Facts Of Life's 9th Season.

This 1987-1988 Season takes me back to memory lane to when I was a Freshmen in high school and watched FACTS OF LIFE, followed by GOLDEN GIRLS, every Saturday night on NBC, and when NBC's motto was "" Come On Home to NBC.",1516838400,,972,4.926829268292683
8750170,3,B01BHCPQT4,"Well, it had to come to an end eventually. And compared to those series which were either abrupthly cancelled, or could not transition smoothly into adulthood, this NBC series did remarkably well. It was SO much more successful than the show it spun-off of (Different Strokes).

But they never DID adequately develop Pippa McKenna who joins for this last season as a 'main character' from Eastland's sister school  Colunga Academy.. She just kinda tags along and pitches in her own comments randomly. I felt bad for her because we knew she never was convincingly a main character. The network could have just done without her. Would have been better for the episodes they did have anyways.

For instance,  Natalie looses virginity to her boyfriend Snake (The First Time) . Originally the studio wanted Blair to be the one to 'go all the way'. But Lisa Whelchel's VERY strong religious convictions (why she is absent?) promptly required an episode rewrite.

Actually in retrospect, this event looks kinda quaint. Natalie is supposed to either be in college or graduating too. Yes this is the era when AIDS/HIV is rampant. but it just seems unusually late for Americans to be engaging in initial sexual activity. It would have been more convincing a ' big decision' during the high school seasons. .

The next ""big"" event is Blair buying Eastland and temporarily attempting to be headmaster (The beginning of the end, The beginning of the beginning).  Because an all girls school is not financially viable anymore, the facility must now become co-educational in order to remain open.  It is bittersweet because the girls realize that this is the only viable option left.

Look for a VERY young Mayim Bialik. and Seth Green in this two part episode. Both of them are enrolling students in the next generation of Eastland.

Of course the series could not go on forever and had to end sometime, but part of me really had wanted to see how Eastland would have fared co-educational. This was echoing the changes which were then happening off-screen both in response to economics and Title IX.

 Me thinks the network gave up too quickly on the concept of a second generation spin off.  Our loss!!",1514678400,,2189,4.867924528301887
8750171,5,B01BHCPQT4,In the final season of the facts of life Jo gets A new job at the community center and the finds out that it is broke and then Blair takes over!  Slowly the most everybody moves out!  Blair buys the Eastland  academy and takes on the headmaster job!  Eastland is the school that all the girls met and graduated from!,1512000000,,316,4.216666666666667
