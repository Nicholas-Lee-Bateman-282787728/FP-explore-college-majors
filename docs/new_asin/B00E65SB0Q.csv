5891900,5,B00E65SB0Q,"the message is profound.  Very well written. So much irony yet so controversial.  This movie justifies the expression that it is just plain easier to simply LOVE rather than hate.  I am a black, bisexual man, so I am very well aquainted with being judged.  Even some gays don't like my ""none sexual preference"".  And the world wonders why the down low man is down low.  This movie pulls all of your emotions together to make you think with common sense.  Had I followed my first judgement I would not have watched this movie.  Luckily I left my prejudices aside and was amazingly surprised to enjoy a good movie.",1384819200,5,612,4.5504587155963305

 the way it expose you to the emotions lock-up in the N- word. It will open your eyes to the pain people permit them-selves to hold on to and why some refuse to hold on to the pain
I am a 53 y/o black man and I am not really into rap but what is laid out before you emotionally in this movie You don't want to miss! As you will see the N-word touches all of US From White ----to ------Black and everyone in-between",1382400000,8,436,3.898876404494382
5891902,5,B00E65SB0Q,"Ricky Beadle-Blair is always a breath of fresh air to gay cinema; he always deals with real issues and does not shy away from painful truths and can have a humorous side too as in `Kick Off'. He wrote and directed this adaptation of the stage play which was based on his book of the same name. It is about free style rapper JJ who is fresh from Bristol in the West Country and is taking the London scene by storm, only problem is he is gay and has brought his boyfriend Orlando to his latest competition. The opposition are none too pleased and in a fit of homophobic nastiness they make a sustained and ferocious attack on Orlando.

We also have the story of posh barrister Daniel played by Michael Lindall (`Kick Off' and `Hammer of the Gods') who gets to defend the thugs in court, he too is gay and has been at the receiving end of gay hate. The four attackers receive small sentences and so Daniel starts to think what actually made them do it? He starts with a simple question and that is `was it the music?' What follows makes all concerned look at themselves in the cold light of day and it is not always a pretty sight.

This is a hard watch in places as it upsets a lot of sensibilities, there is a lot of racist and homophobic language, but it is all totally in context. Team Angelica have made another original, challenging and eminently watchable film. It runs for 110 minutes and none of the scene time is wasted. This will not be to everyone's tastes and for those that are interested this is a gay themed film and not an excuse for soft porn so there are no bedroom action fests going to be happening here. A great addition to the pantheon of gay cinema - highly recommended.",1381622400,17,1691,4.314465408805032

5891906,3,B00E65SB0Q,"Nice intentions/message/plot, but poor raps and some unrealistic situations.  Good acting, but bad violence and some parts did not seem possible in reality.  The movie does make the viewer question why we hate each other and why must there be unnecessary violence even though anger builds within us, and why we don't understand the suffering of others even though we have suffered ourselves.  For example, why some blacks hate gays when blacks know what it means to be discriminated against in the past?  Why religious people have to hate those who don't agree with their religious values when their own religion has been persecuted by others in the past?  These are some of the basic themes of this movie, but it would have been good if they could have told the story in a better way.",1483833600,,785,4.742647058823529

While it starts out well meaning, BASHMENT loses its way and becomes a muddled mess.

5891913,4,B00E65SB0Q,"The starting point of Bashment proposes an intriguing question: Can music be an instrument of Hate? At a first look, yes. The rap battles of MC JJ (QQQQQ) seems to lead to the aggression of his beloved Orlando/Ollie (Joel Dommett). But, as the film evolves, we see different questions been aroused. Music is also an instrument of liberation of our instincts, however closeted they are. Its difficult to attribute to music the sources of violence, they are presented inside us, and music can even be a ways of sublimate these feelings. Of course, for some it will be interpreted literally. But does this allow to censorship of this glorious way of liberate our most hidden instincts.
From this point of view, the film has a lot to say. The first part leads us to think music should be censured, in profit of the whole and as a meaning for being politically correct. But as the film evolves, we see a more complex the question. Even those who should fight some kind of music tend to be lenient to its calming and directional effects, and, by the end of the film, the feeling towards music, however blatantly aggressive it may seem to be, are changed. We can understand the calming and congregational function of music.
Alas, Im a supporter of some directional music, at least in what concern lyrics. Apology to crime must be investigated.",1480723200,,1336,4.713675213675214

I've never understood rap, except loving the beat.  But this movie gets down under the surface and exposes the way each human has to deal with our tendency to look down on someone for being different.  And in the even deeper chasm that our society is now facing... the dropping into violence against another just because we can't differentiate between what is right and what we've been taught.  There is a difference.  I want everyone to see this movie.  I'd like it to be shown to high school kids in every city and town in the country.  Hate isn't something that's harmless.  It kills us from within.

Controversial ones, we never say out loud: Race, Sexual Orientation, Sexual-Violence, Social Identity, Raw Hatred & Male Rage. (Sound like movie magic, right?)

The last 30mins are storytelling genius.  So many torn & jagged edges from this visual social explosion, of vulgar & dissimilar people. For the strong of heart, the first 1hr will make you turn away, but that's ok; It will seem impossible anything GOOD will come of this film.

But the reality is that it is dangerous for folks who are not the perceived norm. So black, brown, gay, artistic, transgender, or lesbian, we are all targets.

8601742,5,B00E65SB0Q,"I liked this movie. I watched it one night and found myself thinking about it a day later, which is generally a good sign. It's true--as other reviewers have mentioned--that there are some scenes that are absolutely unrealistic. However, unlike other reviews, I didn't find it hard to follow along with the dialog despite the dialects used. Once you become familiar with a few phrases (please excuse spelling): likkle, bruhva, etc., it's pretty easy to follow along.

I believe that this movie was a courageous undertaking. It's one thing to tackle an issue long after the matter has been settled and a large portion of the population has landed on one side or another. It's a different thing to portray, dissect, and validate the varied and conflicting lived experiences of people in the now, faults and all.

This movie stuck with me because of the way its complex without being complicated. The characters aren't all good or all bad, wrong actions are justified from the viewpoint of the perpetrator, although there was a main character, the film wasn't ""his"" story. And as a member of the audience, it is refreshing to see characters who can't fully explain their actions, can't justify their beliefs, don't really understand themselves. Like real people.

Honestly, I think I will watch this again because at its core this movie raises some provocative questions about the human condition and it underscores the conversations we will all need to have with ourselves, within our social ""groups"", and with those who are different from us (age, race, religion, creed, color, language, etc.)",1497139200,,1592,5.0227272727272725

The only reason I can think that this movie isn't rated 5 stars is that it is unbelievably intense and forces you to challenge every social construct we have with regard to race, gender, sexual orientation, and sex.  (I'm probably leaving some out.)  This is a startlingly honest examination of the intersectionality of the human existence.  It explores who we are not just men, or just black/white, or just gay/straight., etc.  It looks at how each person being a multitude of these things brings to bear the social constructs of each of these.",1494633600,,662,4.663793103448276

If you can get past the EXTREMELY STRONG accents (my advice-put on the closed captioning) Bashment is one of the best LGBTQ movies I've ever seen. And also one of the saddest. I experienced every emotion possible throughout this movie. The most frequent being shock. There is an EXTREMELY VIOLENT scene that I suggest closing your eyes for as it was, to me, over the top. And the utter unfeeling nature of some of the characters is, in itself, most shocking.
I highly recommend this movie but with a warning. Keep a box of tissues handy and be ready to pick your jaw up off of the floor (several times).",1494460800,,655,4.6068376068376065

He demonstrated that a gay couple can love no matter what happens in the relationship .,1489449600,2,384,4.347222222222222
