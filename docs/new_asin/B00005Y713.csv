7956589,5,B00005Y713,"This is an unbelievable anim series!  I am so hooked on Ranma 1/2 now!  This was my first DVD actutally seeing Ranma; never seeing and episode of the series in my whole life.  But even if you want to see Ranma, THIS is the DVD to get because it's humorous(with mostly sexual humor), there's some partial nudity, but hey the 3 eps on this DVD is well worth it!! Here are the ep titles:
-Gosunkugi and the Magic Paper Dolls-
-Akane's Unfathomable Heart-
-Master and Student...Forever?!-(Caution: This is the episode with  girls in the locker room in their lingerie and there's a scene with only them trying to cover themselves up with towels; but all that's meant to be kept private is covered up, so don't let it faze you.)
I recommend this series for kids 13 and up!",1019606400,5,766,4.489208633093525
