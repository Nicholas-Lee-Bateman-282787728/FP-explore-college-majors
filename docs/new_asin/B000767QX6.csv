2200886,3,B000767QX6,"Okay, the movie wasn't that great.  I admit that.  I admit that there's no Tanner family, no cats and no reason that die-hard fans of ALF wouldn't like this movie.  ALF was on when I was 4 or 5.  I barely remember anything from ALF until I bought the first season on DVD.  And I was a die-hard ALF fan.  I even had a talking ALF doll.  I even dressed like ALF one Halloween when I was about the right size to BE ALF.

  ALF is in trouble.  No surprise there, since he was always in trouble in the show.  But now, he's in deep trouble as we see the lovable alien is at an Airforce Base.  One general wants to kill ALF for what he did to his mother.  It's not the best movie, but at least it tried to be funny.",1119225600,28,708,3.86013986013986

2200908,4,B000767QX6,"My granddaughter and I are big Alf fans. I was always disappointed how the series ended. When we found out that there was a movie to pick up where the series ended and bring it to a real ending, we had to have it. We were not disappointed in this ending, and we enjoyed the movie very much.

It's not ""Citizen Kane"", but it was fun.",1375401600,2,332,4.03030303030303

2200910,5,B000767QX6,"Very good TV film here. Sort of quirky, but definitely a good time. All 80's nostalgia is gone, it's like ALF in an entirely different universe, but that's sort of cool.",1355011200,2,169,4.483870967741935
2200911,2,B000767QX6,"There are plenty of versions of the story behind the ending of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alf/dp/B000ORDM7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alf</a>&nbsp;series and this 1996 TV movie. Some claim that the show's cliffhanger finale was a final bid for the series to remain on the air; some claim that the film is an extended rendition of a single final episode planned all along; and yet more people claim the movie is the result of an uphill battle by creators Paul Fusco and Tom Patchett after being shafted out of plans to conclude the series more satisfactorily. In the end, the only fact is that the film was released almost six years after the TV show concluded, to tremendous fan expectations, but didn't turn out all that great. I'm not the biggest Alf fan in the world, but even I have to admit that a lot was lost during the transition from serial to feature.

The story: Held by the Alien Task Force for six years following his capture, Alf's death is plotted by an obsessed colonel (Martin Sheen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse-Now/dp/B0045INOCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse Now</a>) but thwarted by two military scientists (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/William-O-Leary/dp/B000067J1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">William O'Leary</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jensen-Daggett/dp/B000069I0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jensen Daggett</a>) who smuggle him out of the facility to bring him to safety.

The biggest disappointment of the film? - no Tanner family. Anyone who's researched the show will know about the mixed feelings with which the human cast regarded their stay, but while their absence isn't surprising on a deductive level, the film suffers from it nevertheless. Max Wright, Anne Shedeen, Andrea Elson, and Benji Gregory were as much of a part of the Alf franchise as the alien himself, yet they're afforded only a minute's exposition before being forgotten completely. Alf doesn't even mention them, which is particularly disappointing considering the bond the characters formed over four years. I don't want to sound too sappy, but it eats at me that Alf was apparently able to get over the people he once referred to as ""my Tanners."" The characters replacing them aren't awful but are nevertheless pretty unmemorable: William O'Leary and Jensen Daggett are neutrally likeable, but not only don't they sell their reactions to Alf's shenanigans nearly as well as Wright or Shedeen did, it's never quite clear why they're helping Alf. The Tanners struggled through their frustrating tenure via a mixture of family support and underlying affection cultivated over a matter of years, but O'Leary and Daggett apparently just have an inherent goodness of heart and know-how to endure Alf in situations wherein he's previously sent other outsiders screaming from the room. I don't buy it.

Where the writing is concerned, the show retains creators Fusco's and Patchett's trademark humor: one-liners and pop culture references abound, branching out to Alf's first gay joke and some death-related humor. Alf's cat obsession is revived for the sake of a couple jokes. The main agenda of the film seems to be giving Alf a chance to interact openly with a greater number of people and injecting a defined antagonist into the picture - something the series didn't have (or particularly need). The novelty of seeing Alf barb with humans outside of the Tanner household is short-lived, as most folks (with the ironic exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ray-Walston/dp/B0002T7YYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ray Walston</a>) seem to get over his being an alien pretty quickly. Sheen gives a fun, hammy performance but his character just isn't worth the movie; if Alf needed a nemesis, it should be someone more interesting than this goof. Where technical aspects are concerned, the film doesn't try anything new: having a bigger budget than a weekly TV show seems like a good opportunity for Alf to do something physically out of the ordinary, but the most you get is him spun around in a chair. You'd think that director Dick Lowry (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Attila/dp/B00007AJF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Attila</a>) would've tried for something bigger than that.

When judged on its own terms, ""Project Alf"" doesn't really do anything wrong but it doesn't get too many things right. I consider it a way-too-late attempt to salvage a poorly-executed finale. Paul Fusco probably did all he could, but being away from his core franchise for so long likely took its toll on his creativity. I'm not sure whether to recommend this for even die-hard fans, so watch at your own risk.",1330646400,22,4888,5.841736694677871
2200912,3,B000767QX6,"After the series was unexpectedly ended with a huge cliffhanger at the end of season 4 where ALF is discovered, you never know what happened to him. I was born in '86 and grew up with ALF, so I always wanted to know what happened to him! When I leaned of this DVD, I knew I HAD to have it!

The story of the movie was lacking, as was the acting and the production, but the ALF comedy was classic!!! Same ole, same ole alfer! :) I was very pleased to know the ALF comedy was still there, being that this was released in 2005 about a show from the 80's.

I was disappointed the Tanner family wasn't a part of this movie, but it was nice to finally have closure and find out what happened with ALF. :) I'd recommend it for any fan of the original series.",1269820800,8,751,4.033557046979865
2200913,5,B000767QX6,The regular t.v. series never properly completed this excellent series. It ended with ALF trying to leave for his home planet and the U.S. government trying to capture him. This movie did a very good job of completing the t.v. series. It was hilarious and had some excellent actors in it. It did not have any of the actors from the t.v. show but they did a good job with hiring Martin Sheen. It brought back to the good old days of the 1980's.

2200915,1,B000767QX6,"I introduced Alf to my children via Hulu, and they have slowly enjoyed watching most of the episodes. Looking for an end to Alf, they watched Project Alf. Big mistake. It ended up being something that upset everyone. (Spoiler Alert from  here on) Alf never gets back to the Tanners and seems to have just 'forgotten' about them as they have supposedly forgotten about him and moved to Iceland ?!?!? Give me a break. Like he would forget about the Tanners after all those years, and like they would move to Iceland. Because he never got back to the Tanners, nor even to his fellow Aliens, it was pretty upsetting to my children, some of whom were in tears over it. Anyway, there was no happy close for Alf lovers. I would rather that the show ""Project Alf"" was never shown in our home.",1242259200,170,784,4.444444444444445

2200937,1,B000767QX6,My children loved watching Alf and we enjoyed the humor in the series very much.  This movie did have some humorous moments but also some inappropriate humor for children.

2200944,3,B000767QX6,"Plot, such as it is:  Alf is being held in some kind of ""alien  detention center,"" led, evidentally, by the totally unnecessary Martin Sheen.  And a couple of underlings kidnap Alf to freedom.  That's it.  One wishes desperately for Willie and the rest of the Tanners, but we're told, ""they're in a gov't protection/relocation thing in Iceland, because they like the school system there.""  There is a good scene where Alf winds up in some ""G"" rated...""dance-pole"" bar, and asks the waiteress for some sort of (running joke) ""cat"" dish.  That's it.  Still, when shows with bald twits hosting ""Deal Or No Deal"" or Paula ""Oh I'm so giggly"" Abdul's version of Star Search are the norm - ANYTHING ""Alf"" is a blessed relief.  ""Alf"" was the only justification for even owning a television in the eighties, so go on, DO complete your collection like I did.",1170115200,9,848,4.714285714285714

8044850,2,B000767QX6,"....this movie is not a satisfying conclusion to the ALF story. The whole point of the show was his interaction with the Tanners, and whether or not he would rejoin his friends in space if the chance came up again. Indeed, the chemistry between the Furry One and the talented Max Wright made the show---the writers knew that, and they're really one of television's great, undersung comedy teams. ""Project ALF"" loses all that, and this just becomes a pale conclusion to what had been a lighthearted and warm family series. The only reason it gets more than one star from us is that, at least, some kind of effort was made for the loyal fans who made the series such a hit for all those years.",1463961600,2,691,4.492063492063492
8044851,4,B000767QX6,"I used to watch Alf when I was a kid in the 80's, I even had an Alf teddy bear sort of thing toy. But I haven't seen it again since it went off air, so when I discovered there was a movie made a number of years later I thought I'd give it a go. I knew going in that the fact I'd never heard of it when it came out probably meant it wasn't going to be great, but I thought I'd revisit the annoying cat eating alien one more time, especially since he's now captured and the military's problem. I don't really have a problem with the Tanner family or their neighbours not being in this, you've got to remember the kids would no longer have been kids by the time this was made, they couldn't have directly continued it from the events of the last episode, they would have at least had to have left the kids out of the movie if they did that or used different actors, using different actors would have angered as many people. Sure perhaps they should have had a cameo of the older family in Iceland or whatever, maybe having an irritating house guest and maybe Willie sighing and saying, well at least he's not as irritating as Alf was or something. Perhaps the parent actors were still trying to fight being typecast when this was made, perhaps they simply didn't want to be a part of the movie, who knows, the movie's plot still makes sense without them being in it. The movie is set six or seven years or something after Alf was captured, I mean do you still think about your roommates from back that long ago every day of your life, no you've moved on to those people currently in your life, as has Gordon Shumway.

So what the scenario is now, is that Martin Sheen's character wants Alf to be terminated. He's stolen footage from the government testing that paints Alf in a good light leaving just Alf at his annoying best behind for a committee in desks on a runway to view. Alf's younger military handlers are passionately opposed to Alf's death and presenting the case to keep him alive. Not confident that things are going his way, Sheen's character orders a new test for Alf the following morning, where he will be injected with something lethal. However this is discovered by the young handlers so they decide to smuggle Alf off the base. Of course Alf isn't the brightest creature in the universe, has grown accustomed to all the free food and pampering at the base and plans to escape his kidnappers as soon as possible and return to what we viewers know will be his death if he is successful.

It's a watchable movie for those who used to be a fan of the TV show. It doesn't have the biggest casting budget in the world, the female younger military woman played by Jensen Daggett was best known for a minor role on Home Improvement and hasn't really been in much else since. That same show, the younger male officer William O'Leary was on where he played a bit more main character in Marty. Project Alf is a sort of spot the TV show actor film so has that adding to the fun. My favourite was seeing Ray Walston (the judge in Picket Fences) as the motel owner who is freaked out by Alf and lets him borrow his things. Miguel Ferrer who played the scientist who created Robocop in the original movie is also instantly recognisable.

The film has some humour in it, like the TV show there's a bit of adult humour thrown in that would maybe go over the heads of some kids, such as Alf's jumping on a bed annoys a trucker to bash on the hotel room door but upon seeing how hot Dagget's character is and assuming they are on a honeymoon just asks them to keep their bedroom dance a bit quieter. Alf also goes into a strip club mistaking it for a cat dish restaurant but it's a PG one. There's also a line in the film that goes something like you don't want to become another Bill Cosby do you that obviously means something far different than how it comes across to a modern audience today.

The DVD cover has a quote ""at least a chuckle a minute and a giggle a second"". The film isn't anywhere near that level of humour. The story line isn't the greatest and does rely on characters being less than average intelligence at times for the plot to work but overall Project Alf is a lot of fun and sort of gives a glimpse to what season 5 would have been like if the show wasn't cancelled. If you have never watched the TV show you wouldn't rate it as high but if you have it's nice to visit an old alien friend one last time.",1446076800,,4426,4.271752085816448
