5564564,5,B00B9LNPA6,Very interesting story. There is little sound information on the subject and it was delivered honestly without the usual stigma acompanied by the diagnosis. Good for both the newly diagnosed and family members living with bipolar loved ones. Well done,1389657600,,251,5.3
5564565,5,B00B9LNPA6,"This is probably the best Bipolar documentary I've ever seen. It's touching, relate-able, informative, realistic and something unique...it is positive. I liked the diversity here in that they showed how a variety of people chose to handle their disorders...treat, not treat, medicate, holistic approach. It also focuses a good deal on those who live with people who are bipolar and how it affects them.
But my favorite part has be be how it makes you aware of what I call The Bipolar Gift. The artist and creative force within. Almost everyone who has BP has this gift and it's often overlooked in lieu of ""woe is me"" tales instead of celebrated as it should be.  Card carrying members of Club Van Gogh have plenty to deal with every single day and enough stigmas to battle.
Showing the beauty & talent that come along with their disorder is something few have ever through to do.",1388793600,,880,4.714285714285714
5564566,5,B00B9LNPA6,"I recommend it for anyone diagnosed with BiPolar disorder or interested in learning about the condition.  Also Ms. Terri Cheny's book Manic is a really interesting and to some degree inspiring book for people with the disorder.

5564567,4,B00B9LNPA6,As and artist and person that's open about this terrible disorder(that I used to believe wasn't real)...I found myself able to identify with most of the people in this documentary on some level or another because of our shared commonality. I found some strange comfort in knowing I'm not alone and to to accept this awful disease as a reality. That we all must fight the good fight and overcome this strange and powerful huge-monster all full of hot air. That seems so prevalent and universally weaved throughout humanities creative and destructive history!..,1386806400,,559,5.021505376344086

5564569,4,B00B9LNPA6,"This documentary is very informative, seen through the eyes of people who suffer from these illnesses. my own belief is that it is one thing to see the behavior these illnesses bring about in others, but to suffer through it yourself is a whole different scenario. In the country will still have a very long way to go for treating and understanding how it devastates life's of the sufferer and their friends and families. The story does bring you to see how different friends and families cope with the effects of their loved ones highs and lows, trying to live their lives coping with their mental health issues.  I would recommend watching it even if you do not personally know a person who struggles with these issues.",1385337600,4,721,4.677165354330708

5564572,5,B00B9LNPA6,"This is a really powerful film showing what it is really like to live with Bipolar disorder.  The filmmakers followed people with real day-to-day challenges and don't shy away from showing the highs and the very lows that accompany this disease. I rooted for a few of the subjects throughout the film and learned a lot about what ""normal"" means.

Overall, a really enjoyable, enlightening film.",1370908800,,394,4.954545454545454
5564573,2,B00B9LNPA6,"I did enjoy watching this documentary, however I was disappointed by the lack of socioeconomic diversity among the main characters interviewed. While Cheri (the makeup artist) struggles with insurance coverage, it is only a minor glimpse into the complexity and disparity of treatment for bipolar people who have no job, no supportive family or friends and are double stigmatized for being mentally ill and poor.  I understand that perhaps when choosing whom they should focus on for this project they wanted to show individuals who were talented enough to make a living and express their pain and joy with some leeway of at least stable financial situations or family with the means to provide for them. Why did they only pose a few questions to the tow truck driver? To understand the gradients of bipolar disorder it is necessary to hear the stories of the homeless, abused and forgotten people who also have the misfortune of this chronic and serious illness.",1368662400,18,963,4.9813664596273295

5564605,3,B00B9LNPA6,"Total proof that a person's subjective experience is far more important than reality.  All of these people are successful and talented---and appear to be miserable living with bpd.  I am glad those profiled have/had jobs.  I think it's important for those who suffer with mental illness to see others getting by.  I think to profile those who can't make it would not be very inspiring.  As a teacher, however, I am giving this doc three stars because I found it rather frustrating that people who knew they were being filmed couldn't find words (other than popular profanities) to use when expressing their views/feelings.  Listening to 20-somethings drop the f-bomb (in multiple tenses) gets old.  Not all profiled did, but it was difficult to get through with a class of 17-18 year olds.  Most of my students handled it well, but the profanities took attention away from the relevant feelings expressed.  Call me old-fashioned? Maybe.",1431648000,10,936,5.025974025974026
5564606,5,B00B9LNPA6,"Very enlightening. Well presented interviews to illustrate how several people experience and cope with bipolar disorder.
In my opinion videos like this should be required viewing in health classes in high school, as mental health is as important as physical health, and it is so misunderstood and poorly dealt with. If there was increased awareness and understanding starting in school, perhaps more of those suffering would get help and support earlier.",1425859200,3,454,5.408450704225352

5564615,5,B00B9LNPA6,"This documentary was produced by 2 people, including one I knew personally when I worked at the film school at USC in the 1980's, Doug Blush.  The 2014 Oscars were yesterday and he just picked up an award for another documentary: 20 Feet.  Of Two Minds is very informative and moving.

I have a roommate who is bipolar.  Compared to the people whose lives we experience a part of in the doc, my roommate is off the scale in terms of the intensity of dose of bipolar disorder he was handed, and the intensity of difficulty those of us who live with him have to handle.  He refuses to watch the program, as he, as he put it, isn't one of those ""crazy"" people!  In proposing it, I never told him I thought he was bipolar (his wife told me he'd been diagnosed, in confidence), only that it was a good documentary someone I knew personally had produced.  But he knows what he's been diagnosed with, so probably recognized the connection.

In any case, I appreciated it, learned from it, and recommend it.",1393804800,,999,4.420765027322404

5564623,5,B00B9LNPA6,"I am always grateful to see another documentary made about mental illness, especially one about Bipolar Disorder.  This one does not disappoint as a whole. Most all that is shown and taught about mental illness is very informative for everyone, as for myself, a push towards more knowledge for the public is always supportively helpful. I find this documentary to be very enlightening for us all. Written and directed by Lisa Klein and Doug Blush, it puts forth the topic of the specific chronic illness in the form of three main subjects who are suffering it themselves.  Interspersed with the main characters are the family and friends of these wonderfully creative (a hallmark of the illness) people who flesh out each story and give it a fuller life.  Cheri Keating, Carlton Davis and Liz Spikol are the main focus along with their partners and livelihoods.  Each one of these three is able to work (many sufferers are disabled from its effects), bring home a paycheck, support themselves financially and live separately from any other unless they choose not to.  I found their stories very different as in their separate personalities and the different types of Bipolar - mainly type 1 and 2, and also very much the same with the likenesses of Bipolar Illness which are shown.  All very similar and extremely different in the same breath.

These three are equally able to explain the pain of depression and then the euphoric or agitated (dysphoric) moods of Bipolar Illness quite well and diversely. In one succinct sentence, Cheri is able to let you know just how vibrant and alive colors are while in a manic state and how she went about slitting her wrists at the age of fourteen while depressed.  This may seem quite shocking, and it should, although this is what it is to live with an illness such as Bipolar Disorder.  Just as the sufferers feel they cannot make up their minds at times, neither can their disorder which can be in full control of the emotions and the mood based brain.  A biological illness in origin, which mainly manifests its symptoms behaviorally and psychologically, it can make sufferers appear to have no clarity, lucidity, or specific decision making ability.  During times of the illness becoming episodic, the former things are all too real and affect everything the person attempts to do.  It is not unusual to observe a person easily feeling very happy, then quickly shift to thinking about dying to the point of obsessing on it, even contemplating suicide or having 'suicidal ideation'.

The story of Liz Spikol is interesting as she has a quite lucrative career because of having the illness. She is able to write and blog about her personal issues and BP issues in general, ""The Trouble with Spikol"".  I found her quite intuitive with her knowledge of the illness and easily relatable.  Her Bipolar Illness came out in quite a common way which is after a traumatic incident.  Although Liz was 'predisposed' to the illness, it may have waited a while to rear its ugly head except for a brutal rape at age 17 of which she states; ""After the rape I went crazy. After I went crazy - I remained crazy"".  A major stress (such as something so profoundly overwhelming as rape) will bring this out, or full-blown, as Liz says she ""remained"" crazy.

Carlton Davis and his wife Ginger have been battling his illness for decades before he was even diagnosed.  His personal direction is a little different, although there is really no norm for Bipolar Illness.  Oftentimes an alter ego is generated with this illness mostly at a younger age.  The story of Carlton's 'Carlotta' seemed to me as though he created her to basically kill himself by generating a dangerously reckless persona who would do what he necessarily would not.  He claims that once diagnosed with BP1 and starting to take his medications, Carlotta, along with his drug abuse, just went away that quickly.  His compassionate, understanding, and loving wife Ginger stayed by his side for over 30 years and saw him through it all.

What would have really rounded out this documentary for me would have been the inclusion of all socioeconomic classes.  I kept wondering; Where is the homeless population? Where are those who blatantly refuse any sort of help or are in denial? Where are the people who cannot access health care therefore having none to aid in this horrible illness? (Cheri does touch on this).  Where are all of the ill people without a support system - family, friends, therapists, and psychiatrists?  I felt the documentary could have been a better representation of Bipolar Illness if these people were shown because they shed a huge light on the mentally ill right here in this country.  Aside from these questions remaining unanswered, I really enjoyed viewing the lives of these very real and honest people.  Their struggles, gains, downtimes and times of remission were very well documented and heartfelt. I, although, wanted to see more of how many would view one with Bipolar Illness and how it can and will affect one's life to the detriment; jobs lost, friendships strained beyond repair, and also family members that have just given up. These situations are very real also, and many have gone through these very painful scenarios which have led to isolating themselves among other behaviors.

*This documentary is a beautiful testament to honor the lives of two lovely young women. Starting with Tina to whom this documentary is dedicated, and including the youthful and very missed Miya, who are no longer with their grieving families, or our society due to their suicides. This is also very real to the sufferers and families of Bipolar Illness.  With much sincere hope, stories such as this will give a giant push towards the advocacy of erasing the stigma of having a mental illness.",1389657600,11,5811,4.863083164300203

Her entire writing career is a ""woe-is-me"" conceit. It's her entire brand. Her columns and childish YouTube videos were self-aggrandizing.
