8632648,5,B00HGFWJ60,"I bought it because I love the two male leads, Lee Min Ki and Lee Sun Kyun, but was surprised that it was a really good movie.  It's about several couples that travel to the island of Moracay for different reasons.

The 4 main characters are singles and there is also a married couple that is prominently featured.  The different storylines are simple which is nice because this is just a movie so there wouldn't be time for something complicated.  There is a nice bit of suspense at the end of the movie which makes you want to watch it all the way to the end to see what happens.  Also, the location where the film was shot is absolutely beautiful.  It makes you want to travel there.

If you love Lee Min Ki, then I suggest the excellent movie Spellbound and the series I Really Really Like You.  Spellbound is one of my favorite movies (and not just because of him).  If you love Lee Sun Kyun, then I suggest the excellent series Coffee Prince and Pasta.  I actually learned some cooking skills from Pasta!",1407283200,,1010,4.381720430107527
