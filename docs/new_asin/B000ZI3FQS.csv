8235493,5,B000ZI3FQS,"Are you confused about all of the information available on candle making? Do you want a good overview on getting started? Do you have some experience but want some really good tips? If any of these are true, then you will enjoy this video!

Marie Kauffman starts with the basics, safety and materials. She discusses the advantages and disadvantages of differing techniques and materials, and by watching the video, you actually get to see what she is talking about as she demonstrates each. In fact, after watching the video, I feel much more prepared to go forward with candle making as a hobby, and understand what it will take. Mostly I was surprised to realize how many of the items I would need could be found in my own kitchen, a double boiler, a candy thermometer, a paring knife, even a pair of knee high socks for buffing out the candles.

I must admit that I have never worked with wax and am a true novice, so I not only watched the video, but I am grateful that it is broken into sections so that I can return to the aspects that were more difficult to sort out, particularly in determining which wick to use with which type of wax.

Her 40 years of experience show, and she freely discusses why certain things work better than others, mentioning her own past failures. The video is 90 minutes, and contains an overwhelming amount of information. I suggest you watch it all the way through, then go back to the different sections.

She also has another video on doing gel candles&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Making-Gel-Candles/dp/B0011AU7JW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Making Gel Candles</a>, for those interested in this particular aspect of candle making.

I am grateful to have received a complimentary copy of this video from Gatehouse Candles to review. As a pastor, I am always looking for new ideas to help raise funds for our churches, and I will talk to some of the women I'm the church about considering creating and selling candles. If we decide to consider it, I will be making this a ""must watch"" for anyone participating.

I do recommend this video highly for anyone considering making candles, particularly as a group project, Girl Scouts, Clubs, or just a group of friends.",1339200000,3,2247,4.931216931216931

8235496,5,B000ZI3FQS,This is an exceptional dvd for anyone who is interested who is planning on getting started in the Candlemaking business ; I would definitely recommend this dvd to anyone who is interested in making candles. The instructor is very thorough and very clear with instructions and directions.,1247356800,3,287,5.127659574468085

8235498,5,B000ZI3FQS,"I received this video as a gift last year and was impressed with the amount of information and the clear instructions provided. I guess this to be expected as the presenter has 40 years experience and is a teacher at one of the larger candle supply companies. I have seen quite a few ""how to"" videos from other companies and most are just awful (one of them didn't even show candles being poured) or were just trying trying to sell you their kits (or both). This video covered a lot of different waxes, wicks, molds, etc and showed the actual process from start to finish. Here are the Pros and Cons:

Pros:
* A lot of information presented in a clear and understandable format
* Covers Soy, Gel, Paraffin, and Blended waxes
* Covered Container, Votive, and Pillar candles
* Provided a lot of tips and tricks that will save time and money

Cons:
* The beginning was a little dry with a lot of information

There are actually quite a few different videos (Projects, Gel, Wedding Candles, etc) produced by this company that I did not see for sale here and I hope they are added soon. They are all very good (I have most of them) and have even given a few of these as gifts to friends who wanted to learn candle making.",1195603200,7,1216,4.371681415929204
