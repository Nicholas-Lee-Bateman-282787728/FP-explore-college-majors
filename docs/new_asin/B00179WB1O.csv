8265461,3,B00179WB1O,"At first I thought there was some weird problem with continuity, but the reveal is at the end of the movie, that's when it makes sense There is plenty of action, a bit of romance. Unfortunately there are 3 rape scenes and they are important plot points. Also English dialogue only and it is a bit better than most, but still they say some rather odd things. It's OK for fans but anyone else is unlikey to enjoy this.",1505779200,,416,4.2784810126582276

8265468,2,B00179WB1O,"This has to be the most bizarre kung fu movie I've ever seen.  Can't say too much without giving away the rather crazy story except to say that John Chang (""Snake In the Monkey's Shadow"") arrives in a small town and somehow gets on the wrong side of the local baddie (Dean Shek, from ""Snake In the Eagle's Shadow""), while the heavy's minions are mysteriously and violently killed by an unknown force.  For part of the movie, you feel like you're a standard, low-grade, late 70s kung fu movie (which you are), and then it gets crazy.  Really really crazy -- like now you're in a b-monster movie.  At the end, you're astounded by the ridiculousness of the entire story... but strangely amused, too.

Putting aside the movie itself and dealing with the DVD, this particular version has a rather poor transfer.  Full-screen and occasionally the people talking on screen are cut out of the picture.  In some spots, dialogue is missing, and there tends to be a lot of hiss throughout the movie.  Dubbing is atrocious with no subtitles, and no original language.  Hard to take the movie seriously when some characters sound like Saturday morning cartoon characters.

I did enjoy the movie but for all the wrong reasons.  Can't give it a high mark, though if you love the genre and love cheese, you should definitely check this one out.  Think ""Wu Tang Clan vs Predator"" ....",1301616000,5,1367,4.673640167364017
