5226,5,0767000021,"I really appreciate this video and I highly recommend it. As usual, A&E did an excellent job. I first saw it with a group of young people, ages between 13 and 15. After watching it we went through a little  discussion where everyone expressed their own opinion. There were a lot of  questions and we had a very exciting meeting, where everyone was trying to  clear up some conceits about this great figure of mankind's History.
  Everyone should be interested in learning more about the life of this  extraordinary man whose teachings have influenced humanity for more than  two thousand years. For many centuries his life and teachings was framed by  the biggest riligious groups, specially the Roman Church. Thus, whatever  they used to say about him, this was what one could be able to learn,  whether it was right or wrong. For long time his life and teachings was  subject to a big monopoly carried out by those who thought they could own  the truth. Im 1863 the renowned rationalist and scholar of religion Ernest  Renan in his classic biography of Jesus ""THE LIFE OF JESUS"", the  first one to be written, warned us:
  ""Constantine made of the most  free and spontaneous religious movement an official worship, subject to the  State, and persecutor in its turn.""
  Fortunately, this reality  started changing in the middle of the eighteen century. Since then a lot of  writings and researches have been undertaken in order to bring more light  over this great personage of the History and the influences caused on  humanity by his moral teachings. Thanks to these scholarly and scientific  investigation we have today a much more accurate knowledge on Jesus' life  and teachings. Everyone knows by now that even the Gospels, which are yet  considered the most reliable source on the matter, suffered adultaration in  order to fit the interests of the religious group in charge to  proselytize.
  Besides all the sources available today on the subject,  one must take in account the apocripha Gospels, specially St. Thomas  Gospel. It does not matter if the Roman Church considers it as a reliable  source or not, because only God knows the reason why they keep insisting in  this position.
  Among the arguments stretched out by the 11 scholars  who took part in this video recording, one particularly touched me. I am  talking about John Dominic Crossan and his statements:
  ""The  vision of God which Jesus has is one of what can be best described of  radically egalitarianism - a refusal to draw discriminations and hierachies  and lines of demarcation - separating this from that one, lower from  higher, pure from impure, male from female, slave from free, pagan from  jews. It's a refusal to accept the basic distinctions which most people in  his society accepted.""
  ""Jesus incarnates a dream, a profound  and ancient dream, deeply embedded in human spirit for a world of radical  justice, radical equality, for a world not of a domination, but  empowerment. And above all, for the announcement that that it is what God,  that is what the holly and the sacred is concerned about, not about  domination but empowerment, about a world of justice. That is the permanent  abiding legacy of Jesus and as long as that dream is alive, Jesus is  alive.""
  Another point of the video that also called my attention  was the narrator's (Jack Perkings), who also did a wonderful job, closing  words:
  ""It is one of History's greatest ironies. The mighty Roman  Empire which crucified Him, would one day come to worship the young stone  cutter of the Galilee. Certainly on that day, long ago when Jesus died, no  one could've foreseen that. As the centuries passed millions of people  around the world would come to emprace his spiritual vision.""
  This is a very good source of information on Jesus' life. It is definitely  worth buying.",957484800,33,3840,4.857142857142857

7788698,1,0767000021,"I borrowed this from the library, and feel it is hostile to the Word of God, and teaches heresies about Jesus. Either the Bible is all true, inspired of God, and God cannot lie - or God DID lie, and the book is a collection of myths and legends, sprinkled with some interesting history and commentaries by men. In that case, we may as well study the Odyssey or Dune. However, if you WANT to know and grasp the dangerous subversion being promoted in Catholic colleges (I attend one, and this is being pushed as ""rational"" thinking), seminaries, and other places, you should listen to this. It is articulate, and nicely filmed. Frankly, it made me ill, and I could not finish it. Of course, the anti-fundamentalists will praise this work...as would the Pharisees.",1074556800,8,761,4.686567164179104
