2542234,5,B000EWD7TU,"This video is awesome!  I am an avid runner and needed some motivation to do abs and toning, especially after giving birth almost a year ago.  This video gives you an all-over workout in as little as 18 minutes.  If you think that you are in the best shape or just starting, try this workout.  You will be surprised at how great you feel afterwards.  I am anxiously awaiting Brinn's new video working mainly the core that's due out this month.",1178928000,7,443,4.419753086419753
2542235,5,B000EWD7TU,"I can't say enough good about this workout video. Just to give you an idea of the success I've had- when I got married, I weighed around 115. After having my first baby, I couldn't get below 128... I heard about this dvd after my second baby came and after 6 months was down to 106 lbs! (which is a very healthy weight for my 5'2"" height). I haven't been in this great of shape since my freshman year of high school!!!! This video is fabulous! There is a lot of diversity since there are so many different combinations you can do (which has been the key for me to losing weight). I have exercised regularly for about 10 years now and I have never been in this great of shape. I never thought I'd be in a size 1-2 jeans again! I couldn't recommend this video more! I'm the biggest fan out there! It has a combination of core workouts, toning, and cardio- all of which are crucial to weight loss! You will not be disappointed in this video! For $20, you can't go wrong!!!",1178582400,80,969,4.21505376344086
2542236,5,B000EWD7TU,"This a a great work-out.  It's short in duration but gets the blood pumping and the sweat dripping.  I've always been active and this one really works my muscles!  Very convenient for a mother of two who finds it difficult to make time to work-out.  The best part is that you can customize your work-out - shorter if you wish, or longer if you have the time.",1175817600,4,358,4.298507462686567
2542237,5,B000EWD7TU,"With so many postnatal DVDs on the market, it was hard to know which one to select.  I chose this one because it offered so much variety ... so many ways to mix and match so as not to get bored with a routine.  There are hours worth of routines, so you can change it up quite easily.  And if you prefer a set routine, she also offers four of those, of varying lengths.

Let me tell you, this is one really great workout!  I do the 28-minute routines while my kids are napping and I feel as exhausted afterward as with my 1-hour StrollerFit class on the weekends.  Thank goodness she has Amy on there to provide the example for beginners like myself.  I'm huffing and puffing even to the beginner workout!  (Note to beginners:  Keep a towel and glass of water handy ... you'll need both!)  What I really like about this DVD is that you don't have to be particularly coordinated.  I tend to be ""aerobics-routine-challenged,"" but even I can catch on to the routine.  However, I think postnatal moms who are already in great shape and who are very coordinated would still get a good workout, because there are advanced and intermediate models to follow on the DVD.

I also like the fact that she doesn't talk down to you as new moms.  The routine isn't ""dummied down"" in any way to make it easy on you.  If you are serious about getting the weight off and regaining a normal shape, this is a serious workout.  She still reminds you to follow the beginner model if you need to, but doesn't make this workout any easier than a normal exercise DVD.

Highly recommend this one!",1159401600,103,1569,4.373702422145329
2542238,5,B000EWD7TU,"I have worked out with Lindsay in her AM bootcamps for three years and love it!!  When Lindsay told me about this DVD I thought I have to try it and you know what it is AWESOME.  Lindsay's Moms into Fitness Exercise Series is the only series that will guide you through each trimester of your pregnancy and post natal.  The DVDS are challenging for beginners and advanced woman.  Lindsay is very knowledgeable about the working out aspect of pregnancy as well as the nutritional aspect.  During the programs Lindsay always makes modifications for the exercises (i.e. something hurts or is too difficult.) Lindsay highlights in her videos the importance of exercise and nutrition before, during and after pregnancy which is key to a healthy pregnancy.  I would reccomend this DVD set to anyone pregnant or not.  My youngest child is one year old and I find it very motivating and difficult!!  Two thumbs up.",1144627200,4,906,4.8
2542239,5,B000EWD7TU,"Great workout for any level, can be programmed to my needs and skill level.  I would recommend for any mother or woman with a fitness lifestyle.",1144368000,4,144,4.538461538461538

2542243,5,B000EWD7TU,"I have only done this DVD for one week. So my opinion is that of a beginner in the game of working out every day.
Background: My last pregnancy I was pregnant with twins. The last five weeks of pregnancy I was on bed-rest. My muscles atrophied horribly during this time. After my twins were born, I struggled to regain normal strength in my body. My twins are now 10 months old, and I am just now feeling like I have enough strength regained that I can start a workout routine.

That being said, OMG this DVD is seriously amazing. I am doing the 12-week program, so I have only done the Week 1 workout. I was scared when I started that the workout was going to be so hard, that I would have to give up mid-workout (I have done that with Jillian Michaels DVDs in the past). Usually if I have to give up mid-workout, I am too discouraged to keep using the DVD, and my working out plan comes to a complete halt. IF ANYONE FEELS THE SAME WAY I DID, DO NOT WORRY!!!!! This workout is totally do-able. I do the ""beginners"" style workout, by watching the designated person who does the modified beginners style, and it really helps. I have never once had to give up. The workouts are so good that I am reeeeaaaaally sore the next day. I know it's working!

Also, a little bit on her teaching style: I have taken a lot of fitness classes in my day. I have also tried a lot of fitness DVDs. I must say, Lindsay Brin's style of teaching is so nice. She isn't harsh or anything. She just seems very nice, understanding, and happy. It makes the workout so much more enjoyable!

I can't say anything about weight lost or inches lost, because I haven't been keeping track yet. But I am doing this DVD in conjunction with the new South Beach Diet book ( I have lost 10 lbs just dieting alone). Lindsey also encourages you to only do the workout ""every other day"" so on my off-days, I use the app Couch to 5k and walk/jog on a treadmill for 30 minutes. These three things are REALLY working for me. So to anyone who is starting a new healthy lifestyle, I recommend them. Good luck!",1454112000,3,2065,4.249363867684479
2542244,5,B000EWD7TU,Fun DVD for my wife and 2 year old to do together while baby brother watches. She enjoys the short clips so she can do them in between doing other things.,1453248000,,154,4.0
2542245,5,B000EWD7TU,"Was brand new when I got it fairly easy to follow along with, a lot of exercise with the legs bending down was tough on the knees.

I am able to incorporate this workout into my BUSY life because the ""12 week program"" intervals are only about 18 minutes. I mean, who doesn't have 18 minutes to spare?
I did fall off on my workout regimen, but have been committed to a healthy lifestyle since beginning this video.
As of last week, my husband and I started working out together, and I have started doing this video again.",1451952000,,490,4.279569892473118
2542248,4,B000EWD7TU,I like the variety of exercises and the instructor is quite peppy. I wish you could build a workout instead of having to individually select each workout as you go. Also I'm not a big fan of the military music. I generally like Jillian Michaels and Cathe and Jari Love for home workouts. This one was ok but I'm not sure how long I'll do it mainly because of the music and the choppiness of having to start each workout segment individually.,1444867200,,441,4.390243902439025

2542255,5,B000EWD7TU,"I just finished up the 12 week program on this DVD and I have to say that I really loved this workout video! Knowing that I was only going to be working out for 18 minutes at a time for the first four weeks really helped me to get started. After five weeks the length of the workouts increased to about 28 minutes, then all the way up to about 45 minutes in weeks 11/12. I didn't really lose any weight up until the last couple weeks, then I have lost about 5 pounds and noticed a difference in how my pants are fitting. I didn't really change my nutrition much except for trying to reduce my carb/sugar intake and reduce my portions a bit. While I didn't lose weight in the beginning I did notice changes in my body and that I was getting stronger. I started out with 3 and 5 pound weights and at some point was able to switch to 5s and 8s. I generally did the workouts 3x/week - a few weeks I only got in the workouts two times.

I saw some reviews commenting on the camo and music - I didn't care for the music but honestly the workouts were good so it ultimately didn't matter to me.

I am really looking forward to starting Pretty Fierce: Weight Loss this week since I now have a few months of consistent exercise.",1429401600,7,1219,4.117647058823529
2542256,5,B000EWD7TU,"When I bought this dvd I bought it in a set with 3 other dvds that where for pregnancy. Of course I ended up never doing a single pregnancy work out or watching any of those.

Really wanting to get into shape after having my son I decided I would get those dvds back out an try the postnatal one. I am so glad that I paid the $2.00 to buy this!

This dvd gives me a full body workout and everytime I work up enough of a sweat to feel like I really accomplished something.
This is the dvd for you if you are a mom who is a beginner at exercise and work out videos. I always hated workout videos and felt they went to fast and didn't really explain anything. Not Lindsay Brin! She explains everything to you and constantly reminds you to suck in your stomach to work on your core. Which is something I always forget.

If in the past you have done things like Insanity or p90x then this dvd is not meant for you.

Currently I on week 4 of her program and combined with a healthy diet I have lost two pounds every week while doing this. I love this so much that I have went ahead and bought bootcamp 2 for when I've completed the 12 weeks.",1428364800,,1135,4.008849557522124

2542260,5,B000EWD7TU,Great post-baby work out!  This video really makes you engage deep inner ab muscles you didn't even know you had.  I also like that it's not too intimidating of a work out for mom's.  The 30 minute work out is great because it's something that can be done while the kids nap :),1409270400,,277,4.188679245283019
2542261,5,B000EWD7TU,"Great workouts.  A lot harder than I thought they were going to be.  Wish they had better music, but you go so fast & change things up so you don't notice too much.

I love the funny things Lindsay says just for new moms. Most importantly it has helped make life so much easier- i am no longer in a full drip sweat changing crib sheets or bending over the bath tub.

2542264,5,B000EWD7TU,"I just finished using this DVD and am on to Lindsay Brin's Pretty Fierce Weight Loss DVD set now.  I thought this DVD was challenging but so do-able!  It's geared towards mom taking into account all the annoying things after pregnancy like exercise with bladder control.  Lindsay is motivational and explains how to do each exercise.  I really enjoyed her!  If you're looking for a program that is gradual but begins to reshape your body back to before you had the baby, you should give it a try!  I definitely saw results and didn't want to stop at 12 weeks. I'm still going and feel like it's because of the habits this DVD set up for me.",1397260800,2,640,4.427350427350428
2542265,4,B000EWD7TU,"Usually I go to the gym, but when I can't it is so AWESOME to have a video that I can do.  I had my 3rd baby 4 months ago and even with going to the gym 3 times a week, and running 2 days a week for the last month when I do this video I'm sore.  I did 2 sessions of abs and 3 of the interval exercises on Monday and come Thursday I'm still sore.  It is a little cheesy at times, but most work-out videos are.  I also like that it give bladder control options. I also LOVE that it has so many different exercises so with one DVD I feel like I have endless exercise options.

2542267,4,B000EWD7TU,"This is a really good video for getting back into shape after pregnancy. I love that it has modifications for every fitness level. I know it is a boot camp style workout with focus on cardio and toning, but I wish it included a yoga segment as well.",1390348800,,249,4.208333333333333
2542268,1,B000EWD7TU,Even the modified exercises are not a beginner level.  And the whole camoflouge things (the outfits and set) are just not appealing.,1390176000,,132,5.0
2542269,5,B000EWD7TU,"I would highly recommend this video.  The DVD includes a 12 week program to follow, or you can mix and match the 10 minute strength and cardio intervals and the 3 minute core intervals. There are a lot to choose from, and the routines are simple, but effective.  I followed the 12 week program (and watched what I ate) and lost the baby weight.  I gained a lot of strength and toned up pretty well.

The video is hokey with the ladies in ""bootcamp"" outfits on a set, but the moves are classic, and that's what I was looking for: squats, lunges, push ups, plyometrics, kickboxing, light weights, Pilates, etc.",1387929600,3,608,4.5
2542270,3,B000EWD7TU,I was okay with this video set. It's very hard to stick with the program exactly like you are supposed too.  It also did not help me lose ANY weight.

2542272,5,B000EWD7TU,Omg. I believe this will do it for me if I could do it for more than one day at a time. I can handle it. It's just the sweat. I am drenched after 15 minutes and I can get to a shower to clean up. I have three babies 4 and under.,1381276800,,228,3.3207547169811322
2542283,5,B000EWD7TU,I really like this video.  How you can do a 12 week program or create your own workout to fit your schedule that day.  She isn't annoying to listen too either like a lot of other videos,1378944000,,185,3.972972972972973
2542284,3,B000EWD7TU,"I've been doing one of Lindsay's Youtube workouts for a few weeks. I decided to buy the DVD.

As for this video, the background is distracting. Yes, the workouts are solid but the presentation makes it hard to complete because it is irritating. The music is worse than the background. The music is annoying and I just wanted to throw something at the TV. There is a solution to that, and it's called hit the mute button.

I have no complaints about this workout!",1367280000,,177,4.085714285714285
2542289,4,B000EWD7TU,"I just finished week 3 of this DVD, and I like it more all the time. Not because it's anything flabbergasting or new and dynamic, just because I am getting results. My background - I have always enjoyed exercising, and started running in half marathons a few years ago. When I stopped running (due to work schedules) I gained 30 lbs, then got pregnant and gained about 45 more. Starting this DVD, I had 16 lbs to go before reaching my pre-pregnancy weight, and I lost 5 in the first 2 weeks. So, yeah, I am going to stick with this and hope it gives me a head start on the other 30 I have to lose.

I enjoy doing 10 Minute Solution DVDs, and this DVD is very similar to them in the set up. 10 Min Solutions have five 10 min segments to choose from or to mix and match. Many of them are upper body, lower body, abs, cardio, etc. Post Natal Boot Camp has a warm up, six 3 min Ab workouts to choose from, 10 different 10 min segments, and a cool down. The Abs sections are Pilates 1 & 2, Floor Work 1 & 2 (these 4 are used in the 12 week program), Stability Ball, and Baby Exercises. The 10 min intervals include Toning Intervals, Just Toning, Kardio Kickboxing, Body Resistance Training, Cardio Pump, Fat Blaster, Plyometrics, Body Resistance Training #2, Just Cardio, and Kickboxing & Toning. You will need the standard 3, 5, and 8 lbs weights for some of these intervals.

The 12 week program is set up for you to have a different workout each week to do 3x a week. The first month of the 12 wk program, you do a warm up, core exercise, interval, and cood down, which is just under 20 minutes. The next month, you add an interval (under 30 min). By the week 9 & 10, you add another core workout (32 min), and weeks 11 & 12 you add another interval (42 min). I find myself both anticipating and dreading adding more intervals and core, because just 20 min of this makes me break a sweat and my core is sore the next day! While I am only on week 3, I have previewed the several weeks' intervals. If you don't get results doing this DVD, you're not doing it right! There is also a Quick Start Menu with 4 workouts to choose from of varying lengths. This might be good if you've completed the 12 week program and are using this in rotation with other workouts.

A few issues about this DVD. They are in camo, there is a boot camp-style backdrop, and there is boot camp-style music like you would hear in a movie when they are waking up troops in the morning (that's what it reminds me of). If this is going to bother you, don't buy this DVD. Honestly, when I do a DVD with ""boot camp"" in the title, I'm disappointed if I don't see some camo. I don't necessarily want to hear, ""Alright, troops"" or anything (not that I've heard that on this DVD so far), but I do expect to see some boot camp theme. I think I would be disappointed if they were wearing dance attire and listening to Lady Gaga or something. Also, these DVD's are not filmed in a gym or on a stage, but for about 2 hours worth of exercises and all the mix and match options, it's worth $15. If you want something more fancy like Beach Body, it's going to cost ya.

This DVD is not a routine-style DVD, where you learn moves and add on, then take it from the top. I love doing these kinds of workouts because having to learn the routine is part of the fun for me - it adds another level of difficulty, even if it is mental. This DVD focuses more on doing one exercise for 1 minute. So squat jumps for a min, pushups for a min, and so on. I think it's more similar to Biggest Loser workouts, but I haven't done any of those. I didn't enjoy this 1 minute set up at first because I find it boring, but these exercises are hard enough that I started getting results early on, and therefore was more motivated to continue. I would like to try Lindsay Brin's ""Pretty Fierce"" when I finish Boot Camp (and after I do something like Turbo Jam so I can get routines in, lol).

*UPDATE*
I am wrapping up Week #12 this week and I am down 12 lbs, and at Week #11 I was able to get into my old pants again! Just 4 lbs more to go to reach my pre-pregnancy weight. I have already bought Lindsay Brin's Pretty Fierce: Weight Loss and Pretty Fierce: Lean Out. I would love to do Boot Camp 2 at some point as well. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking to lose weight and tone up. I just can't say enough good things.",1366243200,10,4370,4.148584905660377

2542291,5,B000EWD7TU,"I bought this DVD and another one (Tracy Anderson) geared for postpartum exercise.  The other was a bit intimidating, and I had a hard time wanting to exercise.  This, on the other hand, is great!  I'm still in the middle of the 12 week plan, but I definitely see and feel results, esp. in abs since I am recovering from a c-section.  The workouts make you sweat and feel good afterward.  I would highly recommend the workout DVD.",1364515200,4,430,4.461538461538462
2542292,5,B000EWD7TU,"After reading several reviews about post-natal DVDs, I bought this one after I had my first child. After following the instructions and working out three days a week, I lost all my baby weight in five months. And I felt great. The stretching exercises really help rejuvenate your back, especially after having my first child when everything seems to hurt. Stretching is really important. The length of each workout makes it easy to incorporate into my day: I would put my baby in a swing or bouncy chair so he could watch me. Often, he would laugh and smile watching me move around.

After the birth of my second child, I'm back to using this DVD after getting the OK from my mid-wife to return to working out. My little one is almost three months old, and I've already lost a good amount of weight. My goal is to lose the remainder of my baby weight by this summer and before we have another baby. Based on my results the first time, I know I can achieve my goals.

Thank you, Lindsay, for helping this Mom get back into a regular workout routine and making it easy for me to fit it into my day.",1362528000,4,1096,4.341463414634147

2542304,5,B000EWD7TU,I purchased this tape not really expecting alot out of it. Actually I was looking for a reason not to exercise. I put on the dvd and I was drawn in. The workouts really work the problem areas that new moms have. I feel really optimistic about my post body.

Trust me, I gained 75 pounds with my pregnancy. I did not lose a pound until 4 months PP and was so bulky and flabby everywhere. Once I started doing Lindsay Brin's bootcamp DVD, the weight really started to come off and my body is getting back into shape. I am 7 weeks into this program and I have only 10 pounds to reach my pre-baby weight. I feel more confident about my body and can finally fit into my old jeans. I love the variety in her workouts and it is absolutely effective. She is not lying when she says ""Get your body back"".",1360281600,2,691,4.125925925925926

2542307,4,B000EWD7TU,I bought this at about 7 weeks pp. I love it. Three levels to each exercise makes it easy to mix and match what you can and cannot do at that point in time. The workouts are short but intense. Great for those either just starting a workout after baby or those who worked out before and need to reshape. Definitely recommend. It is a little confusing to navigate at first but otherwise great.,1354838400,,391,4.297297297297297

She also seems to understand what it's like to be a mom, the program is designed with the needs of a new mama in mind. There are lots of reminders not to overdo it. Contrary to the military theme, she's less like a drill sergeant than any other fitness instructor I've seen. I can do my workout while the kids are napping, and get nice and tired and work up a sweat in very little time. I love it!",1353715200,,521,4.22

I started with Boot Camp 2, because her website recommended it for addressing diastesis recti (ab separation), and I'm glad because this first Boot Camp video is way too early using crunches and could make diastesis recti worse (according to what I've learned from Brin's website, blog and other pre/postnatal workout videos)!  It's actually kind of a shock if you go from Boot Camp 2 to this one, because it's way harder, missing the real beginner modifications of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lindsay-Brin-s-Boot-Camp-2-DVD-with-Moms-Into-Fitness/dp/B000VUQ4G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lindsay Brin's Boot Camp 2 DVD with Moms Into Fitness</a>&nbsp;and her other more recent videos, and the production quality is WAY lower on this video.  Other revewers were totally right that the effects are pretty cheesy and it takes way to long to move to the next segment while you're stuck watching the cheesy graphic/intro AGAIN.  I'll keep it to use to supplement Boot Camp 2 when I need variety, since it has more cardio segments and includes some kickboxing moves, which I like.

I got this one as part of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lindsay-Brin-s-Complete-Pregnancy-4-DVD-Workout-Set-Cardio-Toning-PLUS-Yoga/dp/B000YA4F2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lindsay Brin's Complete Pregnancy 4-DVD Workout Set: Cardio, Toning PLUS Yoga</a>&nbsp;(which is amazing, by the way, I had so much less aches and pains this pregnancy because of the target trimester-specific toning exercises).  In comparison&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lindsay-Brin-s-Postnatal-Boot-Camp-with-Moms-Into-Fitness/dp/B000EWD7TU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lindsay Brin's Postnatal Boot Camp with Moms Into Fitness</a>, Brin's first prenatal Boot Camp attempt, just doesn't cut it.  Reviewers are right that Brin doesn't keep up with the beat, and I found that the woman I'm supposed to watch ""if you've just had a baby"" seems pretty clueless (always waiting a few steps to watch Brin before she starts and then she seems to forget to modify most of the time).  Overall, it's way too hard for someone that's just getting back into exercise after 6 weeks off after having a baby.

If you look at the timeline of when the DVDs were filmed, you can see Brin has come a long way from Boot Camp, then a few other workout DVDs, then the pregnancy set, then Boot Camp 2, and she's coming out with a couple new videos soon. And she's had 3 kids and ""got her body back"" after all 3 (she documents all 3 journeys on her blog [...], with pictures!).  So I'd stick with her more recent stuff and learn the correct principles from those videos before trying this Postnatal Boot Camp DVD.  I really don't know why it's still lumped into the pregnancy set when Boot Camp 2 is sooooooo much better.

Now even after several years and a dozen videos, Brin still gets off-beat sometimes, which irritates the musician side of me a bit, but it's easy to overlook since her recent videos are filled with a lot of really useful information and tips that ring true for me in my 4th month postpartum with my 2nd baby.",1351900800,44,3490,6.014112903225806

I have a now 1 year old, and have been going to the gym since he was 8 weeks old, but haven't found a workout that gets my heart pumping so hard, and is short enough for me to be able to do while my son naps.

I have just finished my first workout, and I couldn't be happier! This is a VERY user-friendly workout DVD. It is short but intense, has a high number of workout options, and Lindsay doesn't have that annoying ""I'm super fit unlike you"" attitude that so often comes with workout DVDs. The DVD includes build-your-own workout sessions, a 12-week pre-designed regimen, as well as individual workouts that you can mix and match. Plus, for every workout, there are three demonstrators; one for beginners, one for intermediates, and one for advanced users.

You can choose the length of your workout, and they are short and to the point, which is helpful for moms trying to squeeze in some exercise time while the baby is napping.

I was not a fan of but I did not judge by the cover and got it! Best thing I ever did! Its hard but I'm back to my pre-pregnancy shape and this has inspired my hubby to work out!! Ladies we all know how difficult that is!
My hips were a lot wider than my pre pregnancy hips so I got the shrink X and started using it at aroung 6 weeks. It helped a little but only until 8 weeks after delivery! After that I was still wide! I hated it but I figured I just have to live with it! To my surprise two weeks after working out with Bootcamp I was back! She is right its a total body workout!

I would agree that the DVD is not the best in terms of navigation and I think that she should number the intervals on that menu page since they are referred to by numbers on the Quick Programs, but it's a great workout.  I had my baby 4 1/2 months ago and the length of my baby's naps is still not entirely predictable, but I can usually manage one of the 28 minute workouts and for a workout of that amount of time, it really kicks your butt!  No DVD video is perfect as Brin's narrative is a little repetitive from interval to interval, but the intervals are really compact and do hit all the major muscle groups, which is what is important. Highly recommend!",1312243200,2,686,4.269230769230769
2542328,5,B000EWD7TU,"I am on week 4 of this DVD and am loving the results.  A friend actually noticed the muscle tone in my arms just yesterday!  Carrying my baby around has gotten so much easier since I started doing these workouts, even though he's gets heavier.  The first couple of weeks I stuck to the 12 week program, but as my strength and energy have increased, I've wanted to do more, so last week and this week I've actually been adding into the 12 week program previous weeks' intervals are core because they are fun and challenging.  The cardio kickboxing interval is awesome and I keep going back to it.  I've really been enjoying the workouts, and many of the exercises are things I have done in the past when I worked with a trainer which is awesome.  I honestly think that the results I'm getting are on par with working out with a trainer, minus the pressure to work out until you're so sore you can't move for three days and the intermittent injuries.

If I had two complaints, it would be (1) the set and music is SUPER cheesy (but you get great results so not a make or break issue), and (2) the core sections could be harder.  I'm guessing they're not because they're designed for postpartum strength rebuilding, but I find them generally too easy and I just pause and add in additional reps or additional exercises until I'm pooped.

There's enough variation on the DVD that I think I'll probably continue doing it even after the 12 weeks are up.  I can't find the time to go to the gym hardly ever anymore, but I can always find the time to squeeze in at least one ten minute interval and one 3 minute core.

I went back to all the above listed workouts and hadn't had a problem but I thought I could use something specific to target the new mom problem areas. My jiggling belly and new breast feeding areas hated all the jumping around. (Maybe TMI, but just saying) You can get aerobic activity without jumping jacks etc. I also think the video is difficult and requires a super in shape person to keep up. Not to mention the bad music, cheesy back drop and I found all the different options difficult to navigate and keep me moving. I am back to my usual workouts and I am back to my pre-baby weight without this video by 4 months.

2542332,5,B000EWD7TU,"I had 30 lbs to lose after having my first baby. I started the Boot Camp workout 9 months after I had the baby. It is an awesome workout for anyone who hates to workout - quick & to the point - no hour long workout programs! I followed her 12 week program - did the workout 3 days a week. Please note that I also did cardio the other 3 days a week & had one day off, plus was counting my calories every day. Overall, I lost about 20 lbs by the end of the 12 weeks.

Also note that the 12 week program starts out @ about 20 minutes the first few weeks, then increases to 30 minutes & 45 minutes toward the middle & end, so be sure to plan your time to increase for this workout. The great thing is that there are beginner, intermediate & advanced people in each workout, so you can keep using the same program over & over as you get in better shape.

Overall - an excellent workout that I would recommend to anyone! The workouts are quick & to the point - stick it out the first 3 weeks & you'll get used to the fast-pace & won't be huffy & puffing anymore! You work every muscle in your body & start to notice yourself toning up after the first month. Also be aware that if you have bad knees, she does a lot of lunges, squats, jumping jacks & other bouncing moves that may irritate your knees.

About 3 weeks post c-section I began slowly working out again. I did the modified moves for a couple of weeks, then progressed to the advanced moves. I was completely back to postpartum shape 3 months after.
The best thing about these videos is that they are quick, challenging, to the point! Very effective. I love having the option of doing 10 mins, 20 mins, or dare I have 30 WHOLE minutes to myself to workout! haha.
HIGHLY recommend this video (and her whole series).
One word of caution- if you have diastasis (separation of the rectus abdominus) you may wanna skip the ab workouts until it is healed.",1301961600,6,732,4.553030303030303

I know Lindsay is one of the FEW trainers who addresses this issue. I look about 4 months pregnant despite being about 108 lbs and 5'3"".

Anyway, this workout is hard but completely and totally doable. She makes it EASY. If you actually do it 3x a week like she recommends (I don't---I'm lazy), you will see results fast. Even with the occasional workout, you can tell this works.

There are beginner, intermediate and advanced variations for where ever one might feel comfortable. I lost two pounds the first week! It's a good variety to mix and match or a structured 12 week plan. She also offers a lot of helpful info in her commentary and on her website.

Unfortunately, I only had the time to do the video 5 or 6 times between being released to workout at 6 weeks and now.  It was either eating lunch, taking a shower or working out.

I found that Boot Camp 2 addresses all of these issues, and luckily, I bought it first, or I wouldn't have bothered buying any of Lindsay's other dvds.

I have weigh 5 pounds less than I did when I got pregnant. (I only gained about 25). I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this. I do to all my friends that are new moms.

The video is sort of cheesy but Lindsay is so sweet I look forward to working out with her every other day.

If I only have time for a 20 minute workout, I can still get in some toning and great cardio!  I would definitely recommend this video to any mom who wants to get back in shape while still having time to capture all those precious moments at home with your baby!",1273276800,4,791,3.9125

I strained my back from this video and was incredibly sore.  I blame myself for thinking I was even close to the shape I was in prepregnancy and starting with the more challenging workouts rather than the modified options provided.  I'm a runner and now at 5 months postpartum, I try to do the 38 min. workout only once a week.  It's great for toning your entire body, just be careful about doing too much to soon and begin with the easier versions.",1273276800,6,579,4.333333333333333

2542363,4,B000EWD7TU,"this is a great way to stay in shape for those stay-at-home moms that have a hard time getting to the gym.  i really enjoyed working out before and during the pregnancy and really wanted to get back into shape, but couldn't get to the gym after the baby came because of lack of child care.  i ordered this DVD and was pleasantly surprised.  i've never used an exercise dvd before and was concerned that it might be too simplistic and repetitive for someone like myself, but i got my butt whooped.  i love the challenge.  I have been using it for almost 3 months and muscles still get sore from the workouts.  The only reason that i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes the instructor gets off beat and it can get confusing and somewhat annoying.  Also the camera starts to focus on just one person in the video and if it isn't on the person that you are following then it may confuse you.",1271721600,,901,4.264705882352941
2542364,5,B000EWD7TU,"This was the first exercise DVD I purchased after I had my son in 2007.  I just needed to lose those last 10 lbs and I wanted a Boot Camp type DVD. This DVD is what got me 5 lbs under my pre-pregnancy weight.  I really enjoyed being able to customize my workout every day based on all the different workouts (ten different 10 min cardio intervals to choose from), and the fact that I changed it up every day really helped me stay focused and motivated.  I never got bored because I never did the same thing every day. The core exercises were quick and painless, and the cardio really got me sweating.  I love how Lindsay is so approachable and encouraging -- by far, the most inspirational person I ever followed on a DVD.  She's upbeat and realistic, and always tries to keep you entertained.  I also love how there are 3 ppl to follow -- beginner, intermediate, and advanced, so you can choose your own level.  Another thing that helps me is that when she tells you to use your right foot, she is using her left, so her mirroring me really helps me to follow her, because sometimes you get confused if it seems backwards to you, but in this DVD, Lindsay makes it so easy to follow.  It's quick and to the point, and really makes you feel good about yourself!  Since this DVD, I have purchased 3 other DVDs of Lindsay, and I love them all, but this Boot Camp somehow holds a special place in my heart, because it was the first one that got me back into exercising, got my muscles toned, and helped me achieve the weight loss I had been striving for for months, so while they're all my favorites, Postnatal Boot Camp isn't just an exercise DVD for me, it reminds me of a time in my life where hard work, dedication, and perseverence really made me feel good about myself as a person (I know that sounds corny, but it's true!).

The level of intensity of perfect! It is challenging without being impossible. I am still following the intermediate level, and I like how there is the advanced level that I can still use as I get more fit.  I also like the option to do a short core workout at one time, and do the cardio later. As a mom of a toddler, I don't always have a large chunk of time to complete a whole workout in one stretch, and this DVD allows me to get my exercise in in short spurts if needed.

2. Its a really hard workout, but very doable
3. Great results! I'm feeling my ab muscles, didn't think they were really in there!
4. Lindsay is encouraging, not annoyingly cheerful

2542371,5,B000EWD7TU,"I credit Postnatal Bootcamp with getting my pre-pregnancy body back! Lindsay advertises that these workouts are ""quick and to the point"" and they truly are. The 12 week program is a miracle for new moms, all you have to do is click on the pre-made workouts and follow them. No thinking required - just willpower and dedication to your body! I was able to complete the 12 week program all while my baby napped. The best part of these workouts is that they target the areas & muscles that new moms need to work on. Without this, I would've never regained my pelvic floor or core. Lindsay is also very motivational throughout this video. She not only encourages you, but also offers great nutritional and exercise advice for new moms.

I loved this video so much that I recommended it to 5 girlfriends who had babies around the same time I did. They all enjoyed it as much as I did!

I've always been active, but with a new baby at home, getting to the gym and keeping up the workout schedule I had before baby is just not possible currently. I started Lindsay's first boot camp dvd 4 weeks ago, have been doing the 12 week program and have already lost 6 pounds. The moms into fitness website has also been a great source of encouragement while getting back into shape after baby. Lindsay is straightfoward and encouraging during the video and I've loved it. I wish I'd had her pre-natal series and will definitely be getting that when it's time for baby #2. Don't hesitate on this one.

When I purchased this DVD from Amy who is featured in the DVD, she told me that it is really not a ""post natal"" bootcamp, but a great workout for anyone. I'd have to agree that it is very challenging. My favorite way to workout with this DVD is to do all ten interval segments in a row.  That is how they were filmed and it is a great workout.  I also like that if you don't have a lot of time, you can do just one or two segments and still hit every muscle group.

The workouts are concise, but really effective and Lindsay is encouraging and makes you actually look foward to doing the DVD everyday.  I used the DVD after my daugher was born and got down to my pre-pregnancy weight within 5 months.  A few months later I was looking to tone up my muscles and started the DVD again and am now and down 15 pounds from my prepregnancy weight and have defenition in my arms and abs.

This DVD is my favorite of all the post-partum workouts I've tried (6) because you can start out slowly, work at your own pace, and add a few more minutes in when you have time, without having to do an entire 40 minute session every other day.  And it's actually made for real women who have given birth and stretched all those inner muscles.  After 2 months, my husband (who has been doing P90X) couldn't keep up with the last three pre-made workouts on this DVD - but I could!.",1269993600,,534,4.267326732673268
2542379,5,B000EWD7TU,I absolutely love this DVD. I teach aerobics to moms in my area and I got all my ideas from this video. I love the 12 week program. Weeks 1-4 you are doing one 10 minute intense cardio workout with a warm up and cool down and by week 12 you are doing three 10 minute intervals. Lindsay really teaches your body how to get into shape quickly and how to activate your core. Now that I have done the 12 week program I can switch it up and pick any of the 12 intervals to get a good variation in my workout.,1269993600,,503,3.8932038834951457

That's what I do; you pick the week, and the workout is all set up with a warm-up, core workout(s), interval(s), and cool-down.  Weeks 1-4 are about 20 minutes, 5-8 workouts are about 30 minutes, and 9-12 are 40 minutes.  Aside from the occasional cheesiness, I feel motivated to keep working out.

Many of the exercise DVDs I've tried in the past haven't offered enough intensity to challenge my fitness level.  I was skeptical when I started to look into postnatal DVDs, but had read all of the positive feedback and decided to try this video.  I've now been using it for 2 weeks and love it!  The 12-week program provides a template to follow while the ""create your own workout"" option allows you to customize your workouts.  The video also shows three levels of intensity for each exercise to further individualize each workout. Staying consistent with the ""bootcamp"" theme, the music is fairly primitive, but if this a concern you can remedy that problem by playing your own music while you workout.  If you want a thorough workout that will help get you back into shape and be usable for longer than 4-5 weeks, then this is a great choice.  I'm a healthcare provider whose job it is to help rehabilitate people and get them in better shape.

I guess I should have known that from the cover, but I didn't think they would take it so far (barbed wire, fake rocks, sand bags, army fatigue capris, geez!).  I did give the workouts a try, though, and found the cardio portions to be too aerobics-class styled for my liking, and I started to get annoyed at Brin's overly chipper voice and fake smile.  The abdominal portions contained a number of exercises that I know to be bad for postpartum women, especially those with diastasis recti.  I did like some of the strength-training moves, I will say.  Overall, though, a huge disappointment, and after trying it twice I gave up on it.  I had much more success with Jillian Michael's dvds (esp. 30 Day Shred), and with a little modifications of her ab exercises, I lost all my baby weight and am stronger and fitter looking than I was before my two kids.  Sorry, Lindsey, this just wasn't for me.",1264118400,28,1054,4.598930481283422
2542400,4,B000EWD7TU,"I really like this DVD. It makes it SO easy to fit in exercise every other day.  The 12 week program starts at a very appropriate level for new moms and slowly builds.  I find this so much better than a DVD that is intimidatingly hard or long at first, or too easy.  I know I will stick to the 12 week program because I look forward to doing it! It's so short that it doesn't matter that baby is not ""included."" You can easily squeeze it in during a nap or even just have him watch.
I have one disclaimer: I would not recommend this DVD to beginning exercisers or brand new mothers (I started this DVD about 10 weeks after birth).  It does not include enough information about alignment or safe technique.  But if you are experienced and already know a thing or two- go for it!",1264118400,4,777,4.1879194630872485

But I started the 12 week program and didn't feel overwhelmed at all. She is very uplifting and encouraging and I appreciate that about this video.

If I did one ten-minute interval and the baby started crying, at least I'd gotten a quick little workout in! On other videos, ten minutes just got me through the warmup and one exercise. These workouts are quick and effective -- it'll get your heart rate up and work every muscle in your body. Only downsides: The instructor doesn't always stay on beat, which makes me a little nuts, and she occasionally does more reps on one side than the other. (I find that I just count out the first side and then make sure the other side matches, and if she does too many on the second side, I just move into a whole-body exercise, like squats.)

  the background is a little hokey and everyon'e dressed out in camo because it's boot camp, but if you can get past that, you're fine.  I love that she has three people to watch -one for beginners, one for intermediates, and one for advanced, and that they all work out together so if you're intermediate on most of the exercises and you find you're beginner on one, you're not stuck doing all beginners.
  i love the variety of the work outs, the 12 week plan and the fact that you can mix and match so much of it.  it's really user friendly.
  she's very positive, encouraging and non annoying.  she's not overbearing or an angry motivator.  I would definitely look into getting her other products.
  great work out, you'll feel it....",1245715200,3,945,4.5476190476190474
2542412,4,B000EWD7TU,"Great work out. Was in good shape before pregnancy (long distance runner), this video is a great way to get back into shape. You can make it as hard or as easy as you like. Have the opportunity to change up each work out, add on to it, or make it as short as you like. The background is a little cheesy but its all about the workout right? The cool down is very short, I add extra to it on my own.",1242259200,4,397,3.7951807228915664
2542413,5,B000EWD7TU,"I have been doing P90X for 5 weeks now, which I love. I went back to this video which I had purchased a couple of years ago and definitely saw that this was not on the same level as P90X. Lindsey is definitely cute as a button and has the perfect thin tone body. But the video is amateurish. She says go to the right, but she and her workout buddies are going left and vice versa.  She works out the right side of the body and then doesn't do the left side?  This is evident in Week 1 interval training. The moves don't flow from one to the next.

I definitely sweated after the Week 1 training video but definitely felt that it was lacking. She doesn't address proper form. There are two other girls in the video that demonstrate beginner level and the other intermediate level. After doing 5 weeks of p90X, I was able to go right to the ""advanced level"" that Lindsey demonstrates.

The layout of the video is very confusing.  You can customize your workout by picking different options. I like P90x better because you put the disk in,work it to the end and the next day, you put a different video in.  Nothing to figure out. Also the stretch disk in p90X is definitely worth it.

There is also no nutrition guide like P90X. I'm going back to P90X.

2542414,5,B000EWD7TU,"I wanted a workout DVD that lasted more than 30 mins and a workout where if I did it more than 4 days in a row, I would not get irritated coz I would know exactly what comes next. Before pregnancy I was pretty active, 3-4 days of gym, running (participating in 10K races), skiing. So I was very eager to get back. I did not want to go back to the gym because of time constraints. That being said, I am happy I chose this DVD. I am able to pick and choose from a variety of core and interval sessions. Its just been a week, so no results yet. Also, since there are beginner, intermediete and advanced levels, I am sure this does not need to be restricted to post natal. It can be used aany time since its pretty challenging.",1239148800,,723,4.062937062937063

This is a strictly to the point fat burning workout for new mom's with little to no time, which as a mom of 3, was exactly what I needed.",1237420800,2,446,3.966666666666667

2542417,5,B000EWD7TU,"I absolutely LOVE this postnatal DVD.  I'm about 7 mo's postnatal from my first child.  Before starting this DVD about 3 weeks ago, I hadn't exercised much at all for the past year and a half other than some mild, occasional yoga and a lot of brisk walking due to back problems and fear of hurting myself again.  But doing this DVD makes me feel athletic and in shape again!  I played soccer in college, so I'm comfortable with getting a good hearty workout, but I was seriously afraid that Lindsay would be harsh and too tough on me.  But, Lindsay is super upbeat and has a very friendly demeaner.  Her exercises really do tackle all the muscles plus leave me feeling tired and breathing better than I have in over a year.  It's the perfect workout to do while my baby takes a nap!

And I also LOVE the pre-made exercise routines for each week.  It makes the decision process of figuring out this DVD very simple.",1235520000,2,914,4.392857142857143
2542418,5,B000EWD7TU,"I recently started using this DVD, and I could not be more pleased with it.  We decided to cancel our gym membership because we just didn't have time to get there, and I have been looking for a good workout as a replacement.  This dvd is exactly what I was looking for.

Interval training is such a great way to get the body back into shape and it keeps my workouts from getting boring.  I hate doing ab work, but the ab work is easy and does not take long to do, therefore it is easy for me to do the ab workouts (I don't know that I will get a 6-pack from the short duration, but I've never had one before, so I'm not really aspiring for that!).

For new moms who think it's going to be an easy workout to transition into the world of excercise, there is the ""easy workout"" to follow... but in my opinion, the biggest reason it's called 'postnatal' is the flexibility this video allows for a busy mom.  These workouts kick my butt and I highly recommend to anyone looking for a great workout.",1235088000,2,994,4.178010471204188

I ws a very active person until I got pregnant. I danced and worked an active job, but when I got pregnant my baby was large, over 8 lbs and I gained 35 extra lbs on top of 40 lbs baby weight, and I really didn't want to excerise at all during the pregnancy. After wards though,I needed to fix myself up and this video made me feel better from day One!! Easy, short, and even if your baby wants to spaz beause he wants your attention, rest assured if you have a fussy baby they have 10 minute workots that are well worth it.

This program has been awesome because Lindsay really works you but does it within a window of time that a new mom can manage (with some commitment). I waited the recommended six weeks before starting this DVD, and then started it at an intensity that was comfortable given my fitness level. Six weeks later, I was just short of my pre-pregnancy weight and my abs look just about the way they did before. My pregnancy weight gain was on the low end of the recommended range, but I didn't have any expectations to tone up as quickly as I have.

I need something a little more intense to prepare for my job again like jogging, balance ball workouts, and weights. It's a great idea though!",1222646400,4,435,4.723684210526316

The best thing about this video is there are tons of different options for working out so you don't get bored. I recommend doing this video every other day to strengthen and tone, and doing cardio on off days. Good luck to all the new mommies out there!!!!",1221696000,2,557,4.214953271028038
2542426,5,B000EWD7TU,"This is a really great workout video. I started using it when my baby was almost 4 months, about a month ago. I noticed a difference in my muscle tone right away, and I am steadily losing weight & inches. I do the 12 week program, and I almost always add on one or two extra segments. I love how the video is broken up into 10 minute segments, I do not get bored with the workout, and the time goes by quickly. The instructor, Lindsey Brin, is cheerful and encouraging without being annoying. My problem with many videos is that the modifications seem just like the advanced version, but in this video that is not the case. I've already moved up to intermediate or advanced after starting everything at beginner. I would not recommend this video to someone who had a baby in the past month or two, and didn't stay in shape during pregnancy, because it is tough, but after that I do think it is the best or one of the best videos out there.

I enjoy it very much because the exercise is different every week so it's not boring at all. I started 2 1/2 months after delivery and I had trouble to breathe in the 2nd week of workout but I wasn't used to any kind of cardio before so I think that was one of the reasons as well.
It has only been 3 weeks since I began and I can't quite see the results yet but I do feel great every time I finish (each session is about 18 minutes long - just enough for the beginning)therefore I would recommend this DVD to anyone.

The only problem is that the instructor loses count on several occasions... in most exercises, there is little to no difference between beginner, intermediate, and advanced exercises (but sometimes it seems like there was supposed to be... like the other instructors are having ""oops"" moments as well)... and the instructor changes tempo on accident as well.

Nonetheless, you get off tempo with the instructor and then you get back on tempo with her.  When she loses count, you tend to do a few more reps... which doesn't hurt anything.

You can also create your own workout using the 3 min core and floor exercises combined with about 10+ 10 min HIIT (from cardio kickboxing, just cardio to toning).  I love that her exercises focus not just on cardio but also strength training. The workouts are fast-paced and can be challenging but she shows you the beginning, intermediate and advanced levels so you can select the best for you.

8114994,5,B000EWD7TU,"I looked at many reviews of postnatal DVDs before buying this one. I liked that the workouts are short (they start around 20 minutes) and that they incorporated core work and cardio. After doing this video fairly consistently for about 10 weeks, I can definitely tell gained muscle tone and strength. The workouts were honestly pretty hard at first, and I'm still working up to being able to do more than one interval at a time. I like that every exercise works several muscle groups, and I feel like I'm toning and doing cardio at the same time. You get a lot of bang for the buck with these particular exercises. A lot are the ones listed in the scientific 7-minute workout that was in the New York Times as being the most efficient and effective use of time. There are a lot of types of squats, modified push-ups, dips, burpees, etc. There are modifications for people who want to ease into it more, too. I like the way the exercise routine can also be customized. Lindsay Brin is also a natural motivator and good at explaining things. She's not intimidating and isn't one of those really annoying fitness instructors who yells. Instead, she has a nice mom personality. :)

There are a few very minor cons. This video is clearly visually outdated at this point, and the camo look is silly. I find it funny there's a military cot there -- surely no one will get injured during the video! And once in a while the boom is visible from the top of the screen. Some of the language used is repetitive (I will never forget to pull my belly button in!).

I can't really gauge how much I've lost. I'm 5 1/2 months postpartum and am within 3 pounds of my pre-pregnancy weight, but this was my first baby, so I have no idea how much of that is attributable to this video. I can definitely tell increased strength and muscle.
