2163272,4,B00062IZT0,"I have to say, i love Dn angel. The story line is just so unique in every way, the US casting is pretty good, and the characters are pretty cool (except Risa, she just bugs the heck out of me) The openig theme is just awesome! ^_^

However, my problem is this: The anime dosn't really quite follow the story in the manga. FYI: Dark dose not liek Risa in the manga, he likes Rikku(WAtch, and you'll understand)And they added their own oringal episodes. (Which is not alll that bad, but still)

The commentary is really fun too. They should do that more with anime DVDS.

  HOPE THIS HELPED!  ^_^",1108771200,2,594,4.3545454545454545
2163273,5,B00062IZT0,"I read the mangas (japanese comic books) for this series first, and that completely got me hooked on these wonderful, and utterly handsome characters.  The American voice actors are perfect, and I especially love the commentary with the voices of Dasukie and Dark, though it's only for the first episode.  The opening music just grips you, and one of the extras is with the young man who wrote the song.  The show itself is funny, rather sujective, which is cute as well, and you just feel the characters, and wish they were real somewhere.

I'd recommend this series to anyone, but still read the mangas!",1106697600,,605,4.733333333333333
2163274,4,B00062IZT0,"I have seen the entire series, and I can whole heartedly say that D.N.A Angel is a really good series, and worth watching all the way through.  The beginning starts off really well- the first episode is silly, and you get a nice introduction to what the rest of the show will be like.  The story is just amazing, and out of fear of spoiling anything, I will only speak vaguely.  The characters are great.  You have the main character Daisuke, and when he turns of age he begins to be posessed by a thief alter-ego named ""Dark"".  The story has many different story lines to follow.  There is the drama between Dark, and his rival, Daisuke and an eerie classmate who looks like he either wants to kiss Daisuke or kill him, Daisuke and his all time crush, Daisuke's crush and alter ego Dark, and The crush's twin sister.  It may seem like a lot, but it is fun, and because there is so much, there's a lot to make anybody happy.  It is also being released alongside the manga, so if you develope an interest and what to expand on the story, reading the manga is the perfect way.  Everything about this show is really good. The story, art, music, character developement.  There's a lot of stuff coming out right now, and this is definetly one of the better ones.",1104969600,,1257,4.379310344827586
2163275,4,B00062IZT0,"I have heard so much about this series from different magazines and thought I just had to try it out.
Overall Feel: It seems to be set in Italy or Rome, so it gives a historic feel to it. The characters are drawn wonderfully. Also, computer graphics? This is one of the few series that the computer graphics look GOOD with the characters. Both the characters and the computer graphics look really well together, and one doesn't over shadow the other. A prefect match made in heaven.
Characters: The character Daisuke is a very believable character. He deals with the problems of every teenage boy. You even start to feel really sorry for him when things don't go his way with the girl he has a crush on. He is also a totally spaced out. He is always falling all over the place. Most of the time that I spent laughing in the movie was at Daisuke. Dark is the kind of character that you either like in the beginning or grow to like later. I think hes great, although, he can be kind of full of himself. Which by the way, is funny to watch. Riku is a great character, I really like her. However her twin sister Risa...now she needs a good kick. If you watch the movie, you will know where I am coming from.
Storyline: The storyline is alright. In the beginning you are like "" What the heck is going on?"" But, I think that is the whole point. It is to leave you wanting more. The whole thing really starts to pick up around the last epsiode (so you have to buy the next volume to see what happens ^_^')
Anyways, enough of my talking. Buy the DVD, I think that you will like it. Its a great edition to any anime fan's collection!",1104278400,4,1624,4.241935483870968
2163276,4,B00062IZT0,"This new entry in the youth oriented segment of the anime market tells the story of Daisuke Niwa, a young, somewhat clutzy boy, who happens to be in love. One his 14th birthday Daisuke sets out, determined to finally announce his affection to Risa Harada and ask her for a date. But fate intervenes in the form of Daisuke's mother, Emiko, and his grandfather Daiki. Not in the way families usually discourage dating, though, Instead, Emiko and Daiki plan to ressurect the legendary thief Dark Mousey who will share Daisuke's body.

This isn't really ill intentioned, but having Dark, who is cool wherever Daisuke is not, as an alter-ego comes with a whole set of problems. Not the least of these is that every time he gets emotional about Risa, Daisuke changes into Dark. To make matters worse, Risa thinks of Daisuke as a good friend, but she is attracted to Dark. And then there is Satoshi Hiwari - Supposedly Daisuke's friend, Satoshi is really a police agent intent on bringing Dark to Justice. Things get even more complicated when Krad (Dark's real antagonist) makes his appearance.

While this is played lightly (especially by the US actors) thise complicated plot mechanism is the means whereby Daisuke comes of age. Rather than flee from Dark's influence, the young boy embraces his 'Dark side,' and the ensuing drame enables him to come to an richer understanding of himself.

This only real hitch is, as other reviewers have noted the dubbing is sophomoric, with the Japanese taking the story much more seriously. This is another time when I recommend turning on the subtitles and taking your emotional cues from the Japanese acting. But from a story and artistic viewpoint, D.N.Angel is worth watching.",1103155200,9,1714,4.903448275862069

2163278,4,B00062IZT0,"I love D.N.Angel and truly wish that I could give this five stars. However, must of the voices do not fit the character they are given to. I have been quite acquanited with this anime for about 3 months, I broke down and bought it in Japanese, and the voices are excellent for their character. Dark's is deep, and cocky, totally in sink with his attitude. In the english, dare I say that he sounds like a girl? Dark still has the same sass in his voice, but it is just too high, not nearly low enough for an 18 year old. Out of the two alter egos, Krad's voice is the best, although he has a bit of a British accent. Not much, but you can tell in one part when he says to Dark, ""Have you gone mad?!""

  In the first episode, it shows Dark sealing Krad away. It fades out, to show Daisuke's mother and Grandfather doing a ceremony to him. Disgruntled, he runs to school with barely enough time to grab a piece of toast. His mother, Emiko, yells at him not to go on a date tonight, even if the love letter works. She also says that he needs to be home no later that 27 seconds after 4:52. (<- Quite a mouthful in Japanese) Daisuke boards his ride, all prepared as to what he is going to do. Have Risa board, protect her from the others, look into her eyes where they will enter into a world all of their own, and give her the letter, saying, ""Will you read it later?"" However everything just goes south from there on. Due to Construction, the ride does not stop where Risa usually boards, so she gets on elsewhere. After, she makes the comment that they are very good friends. Heartbroken, Daisuke sulks through the rest of the day, even taking Takeshi's (<- Who's voice is also to high!)duty of cleaning the art room. However, He grabs the wrong card and has to break into the room. Hiwatari, the only other one who is cleaning the room, catches him, but makes no comment about. Daisuke makes it home, and then has to pass a ridiculous trap that his mother has set in the hallway. He enters his bedroom and sees a painting of Risa that he drew. Something inside him triggers and he starts to transform. Panicking he runs downstairs to his mother. Basicly whenever he experiences feelings of love he will transform into Dark. He doesn't want to steal a statue, however the warning notice has already been posted, so he is forced to go. Risa is watching on TV as Kaitou Dark appears for the first time in 40 years. ""Dark"" successfully breaks in and unlocks the code on the statue. However Hiwatari enters the room, and succesfully traps ""Dark"" to the floor. Dark gains control of Daisuke's body and breaks free from Hiwatari, taking the statue as well. On the way back to the Niwa Household, he catches sight of Risa and starts to transform back. Riku steps out onto the balcony, which Dark lands on, trying to hold back the transformation. She screams and Dark covers her mouth with his hand saying that he is no suspicious. Riku breaks and starts crying for help, so Dark leans over and kisses her. End of episode one.

  Episode 2 explains a bit more about the Transformation process as Risa announces her new love Dark, who appears to feel something for her as he asks her out on a date. Lucky for Daisuke, he starts to transform before anything major happens to change their relationship.

  In 3, a sort of filler with an Unicorn from a painting stealing young children from locked rooms, that happens to take Risa and Riku. Daisuke to the rescue! However, when things turn magical, he is forced to let out Dark out. Dark almost kisses Risa, but Daisuke prevents him from doing so.

  Episode 4, enter the bishounen Krad! The episode starts off rather funny with Daisuke dreaming that Risa has made a delicious bento just for him. Feeling very courageous, he hugs Risa and nuzzles her, saying that he will never let her go. Risa chuckles and says that she is happy to hear it. Suddenly, the voice changes to Hiwatari's who says that he won't let go either, for he has taken Risa's spot. Breathing heavily, Daisuke wakes from the nightmare to promptly be teased by Dark that he is gay. (Love Hiwatari, gay, same thing) School progressess, Daisuke does get a bento from Risa, that I think was concocted from poison, pobre Daisuke! Crashing into Hiwatari, he apologizes for it by taking half of the items he was carrying to the storage room, which only happens to be 20 degrees below C. Krad breaks free from Hiwatari's control (Eeeeeee!) and promptly attacks Daisuke, who transforms just in time. Dark makes a mean comment about being lucky that the kid falls in love quickly. The episode ends with Hiwatari saying that he will go away for a while.",1100044800,11,4649,4.456470588235294
2163279,5,B00062IZT0,DN Angel is one of my favorite anime.  I watched the original Japanese dvd's and was very impressed by both the animations and the CG effects.  KRAD is my absolute favorite villian of any anime.,1098489600,,194,4.514285714285714

Daisuke Niwa appears to be a typical 14 year old boy, until he learns of his families heritage that turn into the Phantom Thief Dark, and rob museums in attempts to seal away mystical energies the artists place on them.

DNAngel is a romantic comedy. Enjoyable for all ages, even though it is suggested 13+",1096588800,4,474,4.375
2163281,5,B00062IZT0,"Okay, the dvds aren't like the books, but that's okay. The story's still really good, and the theme is very energetic. Plus, there are subtitles.

So, what is DNAngel? Basically, it's about a 14-year old boy, Daisuke Niwa, who inherits the ""Love Gene"", which basically means everytime he thinks about his love, Risa, he turns into his ""other self"", Dark Mousy. What's special about Dark is 1. He's an art theif and 2. The only way for Daisuke to get rid of him is to have his love, Risa, be in love with him too.

There are other characters important to the story, like Daisuke's Mom, and his grandpa. There's also Risa's twin, Riku, his best friend Takeshi Saehara, and of course, Satoshi Hiwatari, a boy with many secrets surrounding him...

The voice overs were excellent, and if you enjoyed the books, you'll love the DVD, it just takes a while to get used to the fact that Krad is introduced before Dad is. Oops...",1130025600,10,919,4.557575757575758

2163284,4,B00062IZT0,"DNAngel: Dawn of Dark: Vol. 1 is the first DVD in the anime series.  It contains four episodes, which are called ""stages"" in this anime.  The stages are titled: ""Dark Revived,"" ""Rekindled Feelings,"" ""Whisper of the Unicorn,"" and ""Between the Light and the Darkness."" All episodes in this volume flow more or less as one long movie, so there is no need to explain them separately.  DNAngel is the story of young, short, shy, Daisuke Niwa.  Daisuke is in love with cute Risa, who has no idea he has a crush on her.  On his 14th birthday, Daisuke learns his family's secret: that he is the bearer of the identity of tall, dashing, winged Phantom Thief Dark.

The setting for DNAngel is a seaside villa in Europe.  The town police have received a warning letter that Dark is about to make his first appearance in forty years.  Dark steals the hearts of young ladies in addition to artifacts.  One big problem is that Dark has also stolen the heart of Risa!  On his way back from a mission (given to him by his mother and grandfather), he accidentally runs into the twin of Risa, with unforseen consequences for all.

Daisuke has someone dogging him at school - Satoshi Hiwatari. Could it be Satoshi knows Daisuke's secret?  And why does Satoshi seem so malicious?  There is another boy in class, an amateur detective very interested in catching Dark, but Satoshi seems to have a much more personal interest.

The extras in this volume are fantastic.  The opening song is so beautiful.  The man who sings it sings like an angel, and one of the extras shows this seventeen-year old prodigy recording the song.",1121385600,10,1603,4.631205673758865

THEY HAVE D.N. ANGEL!!!!!"" Well, I bought the first three (that's all they had) took them home, and loved them so much I even got my mom hooked!

Of course, there are things they could have done better (like follow the manga a little more) but if you really want to enjoy something you have to get over it's flaws. I mean, nothing's perfect! If you've read the manga you'll know the plot line doesn't go anywhere fast, so why should the anime? Isn't it better to be left guessing and obessing over possibilities until you finally get to see it? That's what I like but I can't speak for anyone else.

Anyway, just get the first DVD and see if you like it and when you do then get the rest of the series!",1116547200,,875,4.141176470588236
2163287,5,B00062IZT0,"I have been on the anime hunt for about 4 years now collecting the best that japan has to offer. D.N.Angel was in fact one of my favorites. It starts off with a boy named Daisuke Niwa and how he is introduced into the story. The beginning may throw people off because no one knows exactly whats happening, but as you watch later on you will understand. Niwa happens to fall in love with the younger of the two Harada's. Since Risa doesn't return his love Niwa now becomes Dark because thats part of his D.N.A. Her sister Riku isn't a bad character as well because she just happens to like Niwa and I won't say anymore otherwise I'll end up spoiling the whole dvd. So in my opinion I would definitely recommend this dvd to anyone who enjoys a relationship that is one sided even then I still hope for the best for Daisuke.",1115251200,3,821,4.303225806451613
2163288,2,B00062IZT0,"I found the show to be average. It is far far away from one star, but I thought the presentation of the plot in the beginning could have been a lot better. The animation is pretty good and I had no problems with the english dubbing. I was very surprised at the Mediterranean setting; I found it a nice contrast. The music could be a little better, though.

One main problem I had was not enought information was given about Niwa's transformation to Dark and why he has to steal these items his mother tells him to in the beginning. It is a little abrupt for my taste. The later episodes do a much better job of foreshadoing why Niwa has to steal these mystical items and goes more in depth with Dark.

I'm probably being a little bit unfair with my rating since my other problem I have with the show is it seems a too childish for my taste. The unicorns, a cute bunny-like creature turns into Dark's wings, and the shojo romance didn't sit too well for me. I prefer something much more dark and mature.

If you like light anime that doesn't make you depressed, then you should like DNAngel. If you're someone who wants the facts nice and smooth, then the first episode will make you cringe but you'll enjoy the later episodes. But if you're like me, someone who wants something very mature, then you should run away from that DNAngel DVD you see in the store.",1110931200,4,1359,4.363636363636363

8037651,3,B00062IZT0,"Daisuke is a middle school boy that has been trained by his mother and grandfather. His training is preparing him for the life of a thief. He has inherited the genes of the master thief, Phantom Dark. He can change into his alter ego at will when he needs the extra power and skill. He's not that thrilled about a high profile life of crime. Daisuke would rather focus on his crush toward classmate Risa. His arch rival in love is his alter ego. You see, Risa is infatuated with Phantom Dark. She cares very much for Daisuke, but she thinks of him as a best friend type of guy. Now the solution to this problem seems obvious to me. He should reveal to Risa that he is both Daisuke and Phantom Dark. But if he did that, we wouldn't have much of an anime series would we.

This series has a very charming atmosphere. It's set in a Mediterranean style town. The music is fitting, but could be a little better. I like the animation and the voice acting quite a lot. Luci Christian, Hilary Haag, and Vic Mignogna play major roles in this series. Like many anime that I've ended up loving, this series starts off a bit slow. I can see a lot of potential in D.N. Angel, but it's too soon to tell how good this one is gonna be. I'll keep watching and write a review of all the rest of this series as I see it. So far I'm enjoying.",1356134400,,1322,4.1640625
8037652,4,B00062IZT0,"All teenagers go through a lot of difficult changes... but Daisuke Niwa's are a little different.

And a family legacy becomes quite a burden in ""D.N. Angel - The Dawn of Dark,"" which brings together the first four episodes of this atmospheric anime series. It's a lushly-animated story full of black feathers, shining buildings and shadowy museums -- and while the titular character is not terribly likable at first, the mixture of shy first romance, fantasy and action is quite good.

For every male of the Niwa family, the fourteenth birthday brings a curse -- their body will turn into Dark Mousy, the phantom thief, every time their feelings of romantic love are stirred.

So as you can guess, Daisuke's birthday is an unmitigated disaster -- not only has pretty, shallow Risa rejected him, but he suddenly morphs into Dark. His eccentric grandfather and mother send him off to steal a priceless sculpture from a local museum, where he's almost captured by his icy classmate Satoshi Hiwatari -- until Dark's flirty, devilish personality takes over. Even worse, Risa falls in love with Dark, and Dark smooches her identical twin sister Rika.

And Daisuke's problems aren't over, since his family expects him to keep stealing artwork -- a golden bird plaque that is flying free at night, and a magical painting that is luring children into itself. But the biggest danger comes from Hiwatari, whose entire life revolves around capturing Dark -- and who hides a terrible secret of his own that could spell doom for both Daisuke and Dark.

For the record, ""DNAngel"" is a really visually stunning series -- it all takes place in a sunny seaside village, and is filled with tornadoes of feathers, shimmering gilded clock faces, broken statues, tarot cards, winged men in flowing coats, delicate sculptures, and luminous light-filled windows. Since the series is all about a ""phantom thief,"" it adds a magical air to the entire story without being too heavy-handed about it.

The writing is fairly solid, with lots of hair-raising, clever stunts to capture various artworks, shy teenage romance, and very muted humor. The third episode is rather slow and sugary (a UNICORN?), but the rest of the stories are beautiful and bizarre stories -- and there are hints of something weirder going on, and an old enemy of Dark's that is making things even more complex. In fact the fourth episode, in which Hiwatari's secrets are revealed during a stint in a walk-in freezer, is pure brilliance from start to finish.

Daisuke and Dark make good protagonists, since they're two sides of the same coin -- one is a nice naive kid with a knack for avoiding deathtraps, and the other is an elusive, devil-may-care flirt. Dark isn't terribly sympathetic just yet, but there are hints that he's more than he appears. As for Hiwatari, he's also something of a dark horse -- he's on the hunt for Dark, but seems to be befriending Daisuke. Awkward.

""DNAngel - The Dawn of Dark"" is a solid introduction to this lush anime, even if the third episode drags badly. Still, it's a lovely start with some intriguing questions raised.",1264464000,,3104,4.887832699619772
8037653,4,B00062IZT0,"""COOL!""  That was the first impression when looking at the character designs on the DVD cover of the first volume of ""D.N.Angel"".

  I decided to check out ""D.N.Angel"" and usually when there are cool character designs, I have high expectations for the anime series and anime fans, I'm proud to say that ""D.N.Angel"" does not disappoint.  It's definitely a series worth checking out!

  The storyline is about a teenager named Daisuke Niwa.  He has been receiving stealth training by his mother and his grandfather his whole life and really is not sure why he is doing it.

  Daisuke has a big crush for a girl named Risa and to kick off his 14th birthday, he's prepared to let her know that he likes her.

 Unfortunately,  that was until she tells him that she thinks of him only as a good friend.

  Daisuke is not exactly having a great birthday but unbeknownst to him, there is a surprise waiting for the new 14-year-old.

  All that training he learned was because he is the next person in the family line (in 40 years) to be the host of the legendary phantom thief known as Dark.

  It's all within his DNA and whenever he feels a desire for Risa (even through a photo), Daisuke will transform into Dark.  And his family immediately has him on missions to steal an artifact.

  Of course, Daisuke wants only to be a normal teen and the last thing he wants is to become the phantom thief, Dark.

  One reason is because when he turns into Dark, Dark becomes somewhat of a playboy who has his eyes set on Risa and poor Daisuke has no recollection of it even happening.  And to make things worse, Risa has falled in love with Dark.

  This sets up the storyline for ""D.N.Angel"" with a complicated love triangle, interesting characters and reminiscent to of one of my favorite mid-90's TV anime series, ""DNA^2"".

  The next two episodes feature Daisuke/Dark on missions to steal more artifacts but also the love triangle between Daisuke, Dark and Risa.

  But things get a bit more complicated in the first episode when Dark ends up kissing Risa's older twin sister, Riku.  But when Riku opens her eyes to see who kissed her, Dark has already transformed back to Daisuke.

  The fourth episode introduces us to Dark's doppelganer, Krad (who looks like a blonde version of Dark, with white clothing and white wings) and despite the color of their wings, Dark calls Krad a devil with the face of an angel.  And we get to see the two go face off against each other!

  The first volume of D.N.Angel is very exciting because the quality of animation is superb and to think that this is a TV series, the animation looks awesome and you will be impressed when you watch it on your television.  Very well done!

  The voice acting in Japanese and also the English dub are also very well done.

  And to top things off are the special features available on this first volume.

  Included on the special features are the clean opening and closing themes, voice actor commentary by two of the English dub voice actors who play Dark and Daisuke, the Japanese promo, Japanese TV spots and also the creation of the opening theme which was cool to watch.

  As we approach the end of 2004,  I was very pleased with the quality of D.N.Angel.

  The animation, the well-written storyline and the good voice acting thus far surpassed my expectations that I had for this series.

  I can't say how much I really dig the character designs and as mentioned, the animation, music, and storyline.  It all meshes very well together and the result makes me craving for more.  It's that good!

  ""D.N.Angel"" is one of the few anime TV series released on DVD in 2004 that has hooked me and caught my attention from the get go.  I highly recommend checking this anime series out!  It's all good!",1218585600,,3768,4.553383458646617

8037656,1,B00062IZT0,I found DNAngel  to be nauseating shoujo rubbish. I find Dark to be an obnoxious character. He's a pretty boy but I find him repugnant. This is only fangirl material not something  animation fans would enjoy. I love shoujo but I recommend Snow Fairy Sugar over this rubbish. This show is rather cheesy and the romance is quite corny and sickening. It's about this loser named Daisuke who turns into Dark due to his feelings for some silly girl named Risa Harada who doesn't return his feelings. This girly is giggly silly over that heartbreaker Dark. Riku who in my opinion is the better of the Harada sisters. She is a grating character too but tolerable compared to her uber annoying sister Risa. In fact I wish Daisuke and Dark ended up  dead and Risa with them. This show is repetitive and cornier than Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura combined. In short this show is a major stinker!,1133654400,3,889,4.613924050632911
