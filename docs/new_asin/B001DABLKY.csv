8292428,5,B001DABLKY,"""Chef Paul Prudhomme, America's own master of Cajun cooking, takes you to Cajun country, to New Orleans' French Quarter and into his kitchen. In a simple yet masterful demonstration, he shows you how to prepare a complete Cajun meal including Blackened Redfish (his own creation), Bread Pudding, Mama's Yeast Bread, Cajun Popcorn, and even his own twist on the pre-dinner cocktail, the Cajun Martini. You'll visit K-Paul's, a plain, 15-table restaurant that's become a Mecca for food enthusiasts from around the globe. You'll hear the good-time Cajun music, see the smiles and understand immediately why Chef Paul's assistant said this about Cajun cooking: ""When it's in my belly, I wanna fly! When it leaves my belly, I wanna die!"" Along the way you'll learn where Cajun cooking originated, how it's evolved and why it's America's most popular Regional cuisine. Even more, you'll sense the pure joy of good eating.""",1260662400,,916,5.154362416107382
8292429,1,B001DABLKY,"Excuse me.  Is this the 21st century or not?  Who the hell uses VHS?  I realize that the Louisiana bayou is a backwater, but given that Chef Prudhomme's recent book release is targeted toward a more forward leaning audience (i.e. healthier recipes) one would think that someone in his camp might actually be savvy enough regarding modern life and technology to realize that nobody is going to buy those pathetic VHS tapes.  It is pretty easy in this day and age to convert them to DVD and subsequently sell a lot of them.  The producers, be they Prudhomme or whomever, need to get with the picture.",1255392000,,598,4.60377358490566
