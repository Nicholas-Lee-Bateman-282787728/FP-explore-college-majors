8221809,1,B000W93YHA,"I would take issue with all the abuse heaped on this film, if it wasn't so accurate. To call this movie terrible is to miss out on an opportunity to use the term abysmal.
It started out with a torturous montage of clips and Mickey Rooney's  face wearing a look of confused agony.
He wasn't the only one.
This scene may cause epileptic seizures in even non epileptics. I didn't realize it, but this was the high point in the movie. It goes down from there
I got this movie in a collection for my wife, who will never let me forget it.
Mickey Rooney has a young woman as hostage tied to a chair as  he has visions of an old couple dancing naked.
To be honest, we only lasted less than an hour. I couldn't take much of this film. But if you want to see it a viewing may be arranged at Guantanamo bay.",1439942400,,797,4.070063694267516
8221810,5,B000W93YHA,"""Love"" is absolutely the wrong word for how this movie made me feel.  Absolutely horrified, stunned, triggered?  I have never seen a film remotely like this, although it would be something the idiot child of David Lynch and Edward D. Wood, Jr. might make.  Riveting, deranged, mad.  My first thought upon seeing Mickey Rooney, who delivers the opening monologue (just over 11 minutes) was that he had aged well up to this point, then, this is either the most vulnerable he's ever made himself for a movie character or he was desperate for the money.  Luana Anders appears, and it's as if I had dropped acid.  She made me feel the dark, squirmy things that H.P. Lovecraft could only imagine - skin crawling, mesmerizing, contained insanity.  Impossible performances, and yet here they are.  Very disturbing film, why it's not worshipped by lovers of experimental film I don't know.  Rooney is just going into places that would cripple most actors, as is Anders.  Try this, hang in there until Anders is summoned forth, and prepare to get your weird on.  Good transfer, good sound quality.  ""There's a jungle in the garden tonight...even the Moon seems strange and dangerous.""  Cyrano de Bergerac will have a whole new meaning to you.  Seeing Mickey Rooney in full-out makeup - red lipstick, blue eye shadow, rouged cheeks - goes waaaaay past Baby Jane land.",1418860800,,1356,4.864628820960698
8221811,3,B000W93YHA,"This obscure oddity from the early 1970s features Mickey Rooney as a schizophrenic (having apparently lost his sanity years ago), forcing captive Luana Anders to act in a bizarre version of Cyrano De Bergerac with a film crew consisting of ghosts and cobwebbed mannequins.  Its a claustrophobic affair, the entirety of the film taking place in what looks to be a prop warehouse and Rooney on screen the whole time.  We never find out much about B.J. Lang's (Rooney's) character except that he may or may have not been a make up man for Marilyn Monroe.  Anders, as Carlotta, could be an actress or a homeless drifter (as is a drunk who interrupts a chase scene later).  Punctuating the static theatrical dialog scenes are occasional fish-eyed hallucinations (presumably B.J.'s) of orgiastic costume parties or a string quartet playing in a meat locker (this one Carlotta sees after witnessing a murder).  This is the one and only feature directed by Yabo Yablonsky from a play he wrote.  Truly strange and Rooney does go all the way but it takes patience to sit through.  The DVD is dark but watchable.  The audio is very low (with Rooney nearly whispering many of his lines).  Soundtrack is by jazz electronic pioneer Gil Mell.",1409702400,,1227,4.832535885167464
8221812,5,B000W93YHA,"In a tour de force performance, Mickey Rooney is B.J. Lang, a former Hollywood make-up artist.
He now lives in a decrepit warehouse full of old costumes and props, where he imagines himself to be a megalomaniacal movie director. He has a leading lady for his make believe productions, a woman he kidnapped, tied to a chair, and feeds baby food.
Directed by Yabo Yablonsky, the film often achieves a spooky dream-like quality.
This isn't Andy Hardy: you've never seen Mickey Rooney like this!
Fans of off beat horror and suspense should check this out.",1399766400,,551,4.810526315789474
8221813,5,B000W93YHA,"For fans of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Tourist Trap, and Blue Velvet. This movie is meant for an open mind, especially of the horror persuasion. If you would like to see Mickey Rooney play a role so benign and ""manipulative""
 (aside from his oh so famous Garden State Life commercials) that would make your grandma cry, look no further.",1392854400,,347,4.783333333333333
8221814,5,B000W93YHA,"It's pretty obvious why Mickey Rooney never wanted this movie released. The great Hollywood actor allows his darker side to come to the fore in this dramatic suspense-filled romp. Watch as he rants, raves and ridicules those around him. He is surely one of the greatest talents to ever come out of the Hollywood movie machine. This movie demonstrates the weirder roles that he was prepared to undertake. You probably need to be mindful that he wasn't at his peak when he strutted out in this piece of celluloid. Another of those ""It's so bad it's good"" movies.",1361232000,,560,4.724489795918367
8221815,3,B000W93YHA,"Let's put THE MANIPULTOR (1971) in proper perspective. It's neither a five star or a 1 star film, but somewhere in-between, based solely on modern standards.

This one's an anachronism: a three-actor leftover of the 60s art craze that, when not being totally repulsive succeeds admirably in illustrating manic psychosis and its accompanying hallucinations. The actress bound to a wheelchair by strips of torn bedsheet and starved to the point of collapse runs through an emotional gamut as she struggles vainly against her restraints. By turn she's plaintive, flattering, cooperative, sullen, numb, outraged, and frightened to death.

Mr. Lang (Mickey Rooney) maintains a tenuous grip on sanity's edges but at times he simply lets go. At these moments his racing mind populates an empty, decrepit movie studio with demonic revelers engaging in a bacchanal of the damned. Whether these nightmarish crowds are self-indulgent or involuntary is never made clear, but in the quiet interludes, Lang ""directs"" his own distorted version of the 1950 Jos Ferrer swashbuckler&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CYRANO-DE-BERGERAC/dp/B0000D1FFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CYRANO DE BERGERAC</a>, with captive Carlotta (Luana Anders) as his own private Roxanne and gentle, stumbling wino 'old Charlie' (Keenan Wynn) surrogate for the poem-wielding swordsman's dozens of victims.

Anyone familiar with Cyrano's story knows its conclusion, thus Lang's demise is a fait accompli. What isn't expected however is that with his death and her own liberation, Carlotta doesn't flee her studio prison but instead acknowledges the plaudits of Lang's imaginary crowd. She is herself in the end either also quite mad or has inherited the demon that dwelt within Lang until that final breath.

Granted, Mickey Rooney's performance is a tour-de-'farce,' but make no mistake: you have never experienced its like before and will never again. THE MANIPULATOR is not for anyone seeking black and white logic. Nor will fans of blood buckets cinema be satisfied, and if you're looking for a pleasant diversion it's also not to be found here, yet thanks to the immensely talented ""Mick,"" what we have ultimately is a graphic depiction of the mania that can be caused by simply being alive.

8221816,5,B000W93YHA,"This movie KICKS ASS! I have a fairly large horror movie collection and I have to say, this is TWISTED! Pretty low budget I presume...tiny cast as well. I have to say I think they did a lot with it. It's featured in one of those mill creek 50 packs. The drive-in movie classics, to be exact. I thought this was one of the BETTER ones in there, and way way scarier than any of the nonsense coming out today.",1254182400,,406,4.0875
8221817,1,B000W93YHA,"This is the worst film of Mickey Rooney's career; it is certainly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This film is relentless and nearly unbearable. Rooney plays a washed-up Hollywood makeup artist (Mr. Lang), who kidnaps the starlet Luana Anders (Carlotta) and endlessly makes her rehearse her role (Roxanne) in Cyrano de Bergerac. For clarity Rooney wears a ludicrous nasal appliance, just to be sure we understand what's going on.

Rooney has numerous rantings, normally at the top of his lungs (""I don't know what love is, and I haven't had time to find out!""; ""Green is the strongest of all colors!""; and ""Fear is the universal disease!"", for just a random sampling) and performs many embarrassing song and dance numbers, many in fast motion (think Charlie Chaplin on acid); there are also many surrealistic flashbacks that make absolutely zero sense. Unfortunately, to accentuate your agony, the director thought it would be an excellent idea to add overpowering electronic synthesizer music in no recognizable time signature: think of John Cage's experimental HPSCHD for computer, harpsichord, and synthesizer only less melodious. This all combines tortuously with endless scenes of Anders screaming and failing to get away from Rooney: she gets outside once; how could she not get away from Mickey Rooney, a man not known for his athletic prowess?

Eventually when the movie seems to have nowhere to go, Keenan Wynn makes a surprise and confusing guest appearance as the only likable character in the film, Old Charlie. Old Charlie basically serves as the nicer, less-crazy old coot, who is perceived as a threat by Rooney, and therefore Rooney, in character as Cyrano, stabs him with his fencing foil. This leads to a chase scene through a meat packing plant (really) and into a montage of a very formal party in said slaughterhouse. Clearly the director, Yabo Yablonsky, wanted us to believe this is a high art piece, but nothing could be farther from the truth.

After all the screaming, the pointless surrealism, the chasing, the drama, the dancing with a broom, the most uncomfortable kiss in screen history, and having seen Mickey Rooney in lipstick, blush, and blue eye shadow, all I can say is that this was one of the most vile and unpleasant viewing experiences of my life, and I wouldn't recommend ""The Manipulator"" to my worst enemy.

The only manipulation here is in getting someone to watch it: don't let it be you.",1221177600,2,2443,4.965770171149145
8221818,1,B000W93YHA,"Mickey Rooney is a great actor, but this movie sucks, because it's boring, depressing, and has a silly plot about some crazy guy forcing a woman to act in a fake movie with fake actors and fake crew! IT'S CRAZY!!!",1214179200,,213,4.35
