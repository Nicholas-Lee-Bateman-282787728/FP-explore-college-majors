8603160,2,B00EACHG88,"Several qualities of this DVD disappointed me:
1.  No subtitles.  My hearing is adequate for most purposes but I have trouble with the British accents.  I know this to be true of many people.  Most of the performers are easily understood, but John Hurt has a hoarse, soft voice that is not.
2.  I have been unable to discern the order of the list of compositions that are performed which is given in the liner notes.
3.  Continuity of the whole work is lacking.  In short, I found the work to be a muddle.

I learned little of Britten.  Alex Lawther who portrays Britten resembles my image of Britten in his youth, but I found his Britten to be unbelievably naive.  Britten deserves better than this turgid work.",1390435200,6,712,4.4921875
