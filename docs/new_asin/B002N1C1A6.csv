8374525,5,B002N1C1A6,"This is an amazing DVD.  It was recorded in 1948 as a working film, yet somehow it got preserved.  It is like squinting through a time machine.  The dancers are not in costume.  The music was synchronized with the original silent film at a later date.  The film is grainy, the dancer's features are indistinct.  Yet here is a major Massine choreographed work performed by one of the great dance companies of the world.  Erik Bruhn became one of the great heroic dancers of his era.  I saw him live in the 1960s, he was amazing.  This might be one of the few DVD records of his work.  For all its flaws I found it fascinating to watch and artistically satisfying.  We are lucky to have it.  If your primary interest is Berlioz's Symphony Fantastique this is not the DVD you should buy.  Consider, instead, the San Francisco Symphony Series, Keeping Score.  There is an episode in regular and Blu ray DVD devoted to the Berloz work.  It provides both background and a performance of the piece beautifully conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas who also narrates the DVD.",1321142400,2,1064,4.585106382978723
8374526,1,B002N1C1A6,"The stamp will make a work of archeology. Unearth rarities from opera and ballet and inaccessible places on the market. But not everything that is old is synonymous with quality.

  Symphonie Fantastique is one of the most important and revolutionary works of Hector Berlioz. Producers forget to quote on the cover name of the composer. The name of the choreographer Leonide Massine and the Royal Danish Ballet are in there and seem to be more important.

  The music is presented in piano reduction. The original recording of 1948 has no sound, tried to synchronize the music of piano and dance. The result is strange, you lose all the melodic richness of Symphonie Fantastique.

  The choreography is odd and nothing like the work of Berlioz. Music and dance one side to another. Often uncoordinated, dancers seem to School samba. Os costumes are test pieces of everyday life, are funny and clash of all.

  Symphonie Fantastique reports an artist who tries to commit suicide with opium. Frustrated by unrequited love. But the dose is not enough to kill him, and he's going to delirium. Hallucinations, feelings and memories are translated into real music with a recurring theme. The choreography does not show the psychological complexity of the work. The piano reduction weakens the plot and the costumes are amateurs.

  People, Shelves in them. This deserves to be burned with the worst quality opium.

O selo VAI faz um trabalho de arqueologia. Desenterra raridades da pera e do bal inacessveis e os coloca no mercado. Mas nem tudo que  antigo  sinnimo de qualidade.

  Symphonie Fantastique  uma das mais importantes e revolucionrias obras de Hector Berlioz. Os produtores se esquecem de citar na capa o nome do compositor. O nome do coreografo Lonide Massine e do Royal Danish Ballet esto na l e parecem ser mais importantes.

  A msica  apresentada em reduo para piano. A gravao original de 1948 est sem som , tentaram sincronizar a msica do piano com a dana. O resultado  estranho, perde-se toda a riqueza meldica da Symphonie Fantastique.

  A coreografia   esquisita e no lembra em nada o trabalho de Berlioz. Msica de um lado e dana para o outro.  Muitas vezes descordenados, parecem passistas de escola de samba. Os figurinos so peas de ensaio do dia a dia, ficam engraados e destoam de tudo.

  Symphonie Fantastique relata um artista que tenta se suicidar com pio. Frustrado pelo amor no correspondido. Mas a dose no  o suficiente para mat-lo, e ele vai ao delrio. Alucinaes , sensaes e lembranas reais so transpostas para a msica com um tema recorrente. A coreografia no mostra a complexidade psicolgica da obra. A reduo para piano enfraquece o enredo e os figurinos so amadores.

  Amigos, Prateleira Neles. Esse merece ser queimado com pio da pior qualidade.

8374527,5,B002N1C1A6,"Briefly, it is a miracle that we can view one of Massine's ballets! If you ""know"" ballet and the Royal Danish stars, you will love this DVD. Where else can one view the famous stars of the Royal Danish in their youth dancing major roles: Fredbjorn Bjornson, Henning Kronstam, Toni Lander, Kirsten Ralov, Frank Schaufuss, Stanley Williams, Mona Vangsaae (the only film I know of this prima ballerina is of her in the mime role of the Mother in Napoli), Niels Bjorn Larsen. Of course, one also gets the young Erik Bruhn in minor roles of a shepherd and Third Monster before he progressed to be one of the steady stars at ABT in the '60's. The print is very clear, and the surtitles are useful--identifying the lead dancers, the roles they were portraying, and where they are on the stage. Obviously the film was not made as a finished product and was intended as an educational tool to help someone re-create the ballet. I did find the dancing expressive in an older style (the Fokine story-ballet tradition)(why would I want to see close-ups of a dancer's or an opera singer's face?!)in the very very complicated and technically demanding choreography. This is a must-have for ballet aficionados! The synchronization of the film with the piano accompaniment is perfect. (If you think playing Liszt's piano transcription is easy....Bravissimoo, pianist William Hicks!)",1263340800,2,1366,4.943478260869565

In 1948 choreographer Leonide Massine opted to notate his staging of this Berlioz symphony by photographing the full stage width during a run-through. Dancers are in leotards and the five different backdrops are available. No soundtrack was made of the rehearsal piano (the Liszt transcription has now been added). The five scenes follow the composer's scenario: A love-sick musician takes opium to die but instead hallucinates, repeatedly but momentarily seeing his beloved, till he dreams he kills her, is executed, and is enveloped by sorcerers and monsters. The dancers' faces are unrecognizable, some of their balletic work ambiguous. Superimposed titles have been added to guide the viewer. You can select Angle 1 for full stage or Angle 2 for half stage (very grainy).

On the case front the production photo of the two leads affirms that the Massine production was costume heavy. The documented choreography affirms that it was pantomimic and lacked vigor, with no one permitted to dance more than a few phrases before being whisked off. The stage is often overcrowded.

Oh, there are so many wonderful dance DVDs available now! Spend your money on these.",1256169600,6,1169,5.1798941798941796
