I was a bit skeptical on buying these films because they're MOD, but I was quite surprised at how well these DVDs were put together. I just finished watching Part 2 and I'm not disapointed. The video quality is decent for the most part, with a bit of glitches every now and then, I'm satisfied with the results. The audio was decent, too. It was just extremely quiet and I had to turn my TV up to 40 as opposed to my usual 18. The special features aren't phenomenal, stuff I've seen already when I got the flick on iTunes, but they're entertaining for those who haven't seen 'em. I just wish they had added the behind-the-scenes that MTV had. I would definitely get this  DVD (if you don't mind paying 15 bucks for a burnt copy).",1344988800,,780,4.27027027027027

4284919,5,B0047DWJ3C,this movie is completely different from the 1st one and is alot better great acting and really scary. its a must see.,1303171200,,117,4.363636363636363
4284920,5,B0047DWJ3C,"This movie is really good I don't even see why everyone's complaining about the dvd not having enough features. To start off this is the perfect horror movie for everyone. It's Bloody, Funny, Smart, and very entertaining. It's WAY better than the first and really sets a new standard of teen horror movies. This DVD comes with pretty good cover art and an interesting bonus feature on cast confesions and thoughts about characters, plot, and the movie. So please don't listen to the bad reviews, this is an awesome, exiting film that has a little something for everyone!!! To wrap it up I hope everyone enjoys this movie and trust me it is not even a bad movie its really GREAT!!!

I Give It a 5/5.",1293235200,,698,4.5396825396825395
4284921,5,B0047DWJ3C,"If you're going to write a review on here, do it according to how good or bad the movie was and not on how you received the packaging in the mail. Duh? Everyone who does the latter is retarded and slowly dumbing down society. With all that said, I would like to take the time to say this movie, like any movie, had it's flaws, but it turned out really good because it was immensely entertaining and an added bonus was that Kristen Prout starred in it! So in my opinion if you think otherwise, then you can go boil your bottoms you sons of a silly person. I blow my nose at you, you so-called movie raters, you and all your silly exaggerations. Thppppt!",1293235200,,652,4.224
4284922,1,B0047DWJ3C,"Well, considering the first My Super Psycho Sweet Sixteen movie on MTV was successful enough to spawn a sequel, you would think they could put the money into releasing an OFFICIAL DVD of each of them. Instead, we are expected to shell out hard earned money in the middle of a recession for something we essentially could have made ourselves if we had just recorded this film onto DVD-R while watching it on television...",1288915200,,420,4.6891891891891895
8418052,4,B0047DWJ3C,"I've seen the first one and really did like it, now having seen the second one I did like it too. I'm not going to make the claim that this will win Golden Globes or Oscars or any Independent spirit awards but it is a fun watch. The second is more gritty and violent and much more malevolent. Skye and her new found sister really have some serious daddy issues, namely he likes to kill people. I did like it and as a matter of fact I just ordered the third one.",1428019200,,461,4.021739130434782

8418060,4,B0047DWJ3C,The movie begins where the first one left off and it's completely different from the first and it has crazy violent deaths. It's fun to watch and if you're like me you'll be hooked on the franchise. The quality of the DVD is really good and so is the audio. If it was in theaters it would get an R rating. Good buy for horror fans and it's a great slasher flick!,1390176000,,362,4.041666666666667
8418061,5,B0047DWJ3C,I watched this on MTV when it came out and loved it instantly. I have all three movies and recommend it to any horror film lover.,1388448000,,129,4.0
