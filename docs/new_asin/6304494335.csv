888738,5,6304494335,'Jeremy' is the best of the teenage films about love that I have ever seen and I intend to let my daughter see it when she reaches age 11.  It is a story about real love and honesty.  This film may be dated but the points come accross as wholesome love. Robby and Glynnis come accross real and untouched--touched only by their love for one another.  I wish I could turn back the hands of time and teenagers were still like this.  I had been looking for this movie since 1973 to purchase.  I loved it and will always be my favorite movie along with Forrest Gump.  Can I also mention that the soundtrack is beautiful too.,1084060800,14,619,4.247863247863248
888739,5,6304494335,"Well, I am 18 years old, and I was named after this awesome movie. It's such a simple, wonderful story. I actually have an original poster from the movie. On it is the wonderful quote: ""A film that has nothing going for it but the people who love it,"" and that's exactly what it is. Those who don't enjoy Jeremy simply can't get past the fact that is very dated. If you are a Robby Benson fan, watch American Dreams on Sundays (though he doesn't play a very nice character). If you're a fan of both Robby and Glynnis O'Connor, there is a 1977 version of Thornton Wilder's Our Town where they play the leads (Emily and George). I highly recommend this. Though this version of Our Town is very hard to come by, it can be bought on Amazon at the rental market price ($75). Otherwise, some public libraries and universities sometimes will have a copy.",1073088000,9,847,4.401273885350318
888740,5,6304494335,"In the 1970's,the movie industry had some films that showed how
the establishment was abusing and misusing our funds,the military and our feelings for each other.
 There were few films that showed a positive side to a relationship.
 But in 1973,one film ""Jeremy""showed everyone that a story about
human relationships could work with an audience.
 Stage and tv vetrain:Robby Benson gave one of his most poigent and real performances as the high school nerd. Who falls in love
with a beautiful young woman(Played here with genuine sensitivty ,charm and beauty by Glyniss O'Connor).Who finds a kinderd soul mate in the serious but kindly:""Jeremy Jones"".
  ""Susan Rollins""(Ms. O'Connor)is the daughter of a struggling unemlpoyed widower. Whose difficulties in finding work..make it
hard for the young girl to deal with her father's problems.
  When she meets:""Jeremy"",she finds someone that she tell her
troubles to and spend time with.
  The pair develop a relationship but it ends..when Ms. O'Connor's on screen father is forced to take a job with a
company out of town and father and daughter must move to another city.
  This creates a heartfelt but bittersweet ending for the couple. Who must accept the parting and move on with their lives.
  While the script is not top notch,the acting is good.
 Benson and O'Connor are the perfect teen actors to play the
parts of the gentle yet troubled lovers and their chemestry on
screen is special.
  Very few actors even today have the ability to play gentle
but sad characters.
  I first saw this film..when I was the movie critic for my
High School newspaper back in 1973. And I enjoy seing it today as I did
when I first met:""Jeremy""and ""Sue""thiry years ago.
  If you want a quality teen romantic drama that shows true
love and feelings. Without the use of foul lanuage and violence?
  This is a video worth having!
  (There is one sex scene in the film. Where Ms. O'Connor and
  Mr. Benson are having sex in Mr. Benson's bedroom. While the
  scene is done in good taste. It is not a scene to be viewed
  by very young children or by those of very strict and con-
  trolling moral vaules.)
  This scene predates the love making scenes that Ms. Shields
and Mr. Atkins did in""The Blue Lagoon!"" by a decade..but I'd rather watch Mr. Benson
and Ms. O'Connor making out..than seeing Ms. Shields and Mr. Atkins
making out!",1067212800,16,2363,4.796019900497512
888741,5,6304494335,"An absolutely wonderful film, I had the pleasure of watching this on tv a few days ago.
If you haven't seen it, its worth buying if you enjoy movies that touch you emotionally.
I wish the ending could have been different and that they could have lived happily ever after but watching the film I kinda knew it would happen.
However I can see why this film touched so many peoples hearts. Now I want to see more of Robby Benson and Glynnis O'connor together, the fact that they had a real relationship together  certainly shows with their on screen chemisty.
Glynnis O'Connor is sweet and beautiful in her role as sarah and is the absolute dream girl I wish I could have had as my first and last love.
My recommendation is to buy this film, its simple but its head and shoulders above near any other romance film

888844,4,6304494335,"Released in 1973, Jeremy stars Robby Benson as a 16 year-old cellist in the Big Apple who falls for a new girl in school (Glynnis O'Connor). Love blossoms as they develop a relationship. Len Bari plays the boys best friend and Leonardo Cimino his cello teacher while Ned Wilson plays the girls likable father.

This has the same tone as 1970s Love Story, except that it deals with young high school students rather than college-age (interestingly, Benson and OConnor were the same age as their characters during filming, 16 and 17 respectively). I like it better than that more popular flick mainly because the girl is more palatable than Ali MacGraw, to say the least; not to mention the storys less downbeat. This is just a quiet, sweet and beautiful love story of city teenagers that smacks of real life. For instance, if you're a guy did you ever call a girl you were interested in and have a literal list of topics to discuss because you lacked the mojo to wing it? I did; several times.

This was only Bensons second film and he had what it takes to carry it, along with the winsome OConnor. Being only 16, he looks way geekier than later films. Speaking of which, Jeremy is sort of the precursor to 1976s Ode to Billy Joe since both flicks star Benson and OConnor as teen lovers, although they're a year or two younger in Jeremy, not to mention in the big city rather than rural Mississippi. While Jeremy is good for what it is its unable to breach the threshold of greatness like Ode.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot entirely in New York City.

888847,4,6304494335,"Here's a lovely little film, so achingly sincere that it overcomes its limitations & offers a familiar story of first love that any of us will recognize. The more cynical will cringe, no doubt; but it really does capture that sense of innocent, overwhelming wonder & confusion that first love brings, as if the world is splitting open into fireworks. Robby Benson & Glynis O'Connor are very affecting as the leads, showing both the tentative vulnerability & the intensity as each one slowly realizes that the other shares the same feelings. For some, this will move a little too much into twee territory -- and the film doesn't always escape that. But on the whole, it's an honest portrayal of that awkward, unforgettable moment in youth when the universe suddenly becomes much larger because of another person -- and that other person becomes your universe. And yes, of course this review is more than a bit purple & starry-eyed -- but that's exactly the sometimes embarrassing quality this film conveys so well.

Agreed, the actual image quality leaves much to be desired at times. But even here, the bareness of the 16 mm film stock actually makes the two young lovers even more vulnerable, which is appropriate. It'll never be regarded as a great film, but it's certainly worthwhile -- if you can bear to be painfully reminded of what your own first love was like, of course -- recommended!",1423785600,,1394,4.808333333333334

888955,5,6304494335,"Before the movie FAME made famous the New York High School Of Performing Arts, there was this wonderful story of teenage love, set at its sister school, the New York High School of Music & Art. Shot in 16mm, this 1973 film, directed by Arthur Barron, was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and went on to win the Best First Film Award at the Cannes film Festival. What makes this ""little"" film so wonderful is that, although a well-planned and scripted drama, the filmmaking and performances of its cast make the experience feel so real - almost like a documentary.

888956,5,6304494335,"I saw this movie when it came out in the 1970's, then once in the 80's late one night on TV.
I still like it, although it seems a bit quaint & clunky. Not sure if kids really jumped into sexual relationships so fast in the 70's, maybe the time span they knew each other for before their first encounter was longer than it seemed in the movie. Times were different then I guess. I remember waiting at least a month!

The actors are very young looking and Jeremy is very awkward & dorky, but has a great body & is a true nerd. He's gorgeous, its the sort of role Robert Pattinson would have played if the movie had been made in the past five years (he is all grown up now!)

The ballet scenes where Sue is practicing are a bit strange, she has her hair all over the place & she is obviously not a dancer.  I liked the extended basket ball scene in the boys gym, and the scenes with Jeremy playing the cello.

The movie is visually beautiful, the music is lovely, and it captures the awkwardness & embarrassment of first love really well.

A great nostalgia trip that captures first love in the mid 70's.",1360368000,3,1101,4.199052132701421
888957,5,6304494335,"This is defiantly one of my all-time favorite love stories, aside from Ode To Billie Joe which also features Robby Benson and Glynnis O'Connor. This is the story of two shy young teenagers who meet and fall in love for the first time, and are torn apart by forces beyond themselves. I saw this movie for the first time about 15 plus years ago, I've loved it ever sense.

888958,4,6304494335,"My rating is generous and subjective. I can't really argue that this is a ""good"" movie.
A lot of it feels awkward and even amateurish.

--mild spoilers ahead--

But this look at teen-age first love speaks to me very personally (shy west side NYC
kid falls for beautiful, popular girl only to lose her to outside forces).

This was both my teen-age fantasy of what first romance and sex should be, and a
reflection of much of my own real life experience.

So even such cringe worthy elements as Robby Benson and Glynnis O'Connor singing
not-very-good pop odes to love on the soundtrack can't keep this from making me
remember and cry.

Interestingly, talking to others of my generation (I'm 50) I was fascinated
to find I was far from alone in having this heart/head split in reaction to the film.
So obviously there's something in there real and true enough in it that it overcomes
the undeniably mawkish elements.

But for a really great look at teen first love, I recommend Roy Andersson's wonderful
""A Swedish Love Story"" - hard to find, but worth it.",1319846400,3,1054,4.639784946236559
888959,5,6304494335,"I first saw this when it came out back in 1973 and was glad to be able to find it again.  In 1973 I was 11 and was an extremely shy pre-adolescent who was scared to death of approaching the opposite sex (fear of rejection, looking foolish, etc.).  The actors are very authentic in their portrayal of the awkwardness and power of those feelings being felt for the first time.  This movie really hit home.  The sad movie's ending ripped my heart out and threw me into a two month depression.  I think that speaks to the quality of the acting and storytelling.",1312588800,3,557,4.368932038834951
888960,5,6304494335,"I saw it when I was at the age of 14! After all these years, I still thrill of watching it with sad emotion at the end of departure in the airport. Jeremy is my all time favorite and it's about first dating, first love for teenager - Robby Benson, one of the talented artists who's not only an actor but also a fine singer (theme song - Blue Balloon / Hourglass Song). Thanked Joseph Brooks (composer of You Light Up My Life) for bringing us such timeless great song - I always wondering why it did not even win the Academy nomination in 1973 although the winner went to Marvin Hamlisch's The Way We Were. The inner feelings of sad and happiness for both Glynnis O'Connor (sung the title song Jeremy, music by Lee Holdridge) and Robby Benson were exhibiting their talent incredibly. Both of them are remarkable and film itself colored romance with humanity in 70's. A typical love story but genuine to everyone who comes across first love during teenage periods! Many of our local (Hong Kong) film makers were sampled the script (ie: a morning kiss what's beautiful, you are beautiful, etc...) in their films or television series. If you love movie collaborates well with good music (theme song plus orchestral score), Jeremy won't disappoint you because it's share and under the fine baton of talented composer & conductor Lee Holdridge (music director for most of John Denver & Neil Diamond's concerts and he's the arranger & conductor of film Jonathan Livingston Seagull - 1973). If you haven't been baptized movies via 70s, you might not be well realize or adapt what's a true and first love in young days! Don't miss it!

P.S. : I personally choice 3 most favorite films about ""love"" in different stage mingle with excellent soundtrack - Melody (Bee Gees); Jeremy and Interlude (Georges Delerue). It's very pity that both soundtrack is still not available in the market after decades and also sad to know composer Joseph Brooks found dead in his NY apartment on Sunday May 22, 2011!!

This preening New York self-love, this compound of populism and culture-vulturism--this ingratiating depiction of the ideal Manhattan adolescent--is more irritating now than when I was Jeremy's age:  too often, it strikes me as tony, cute and smug.

889028,3,6304494335,"This was not one of the more best made films Benson did, but given his age, it was a good starter for him when you look at his career.  I was as awkward as Jeremy at the age Benson played the role and was more Jeremy when going through my early teens; which is why I loved the movie.  I knew allot of ""nerdy"" wiz kid (brainy) guys and gals who were no different, which is what makes the film worth having in my library.  One of the hardest things for a soul, in my view, who is born into this state; is to work out his or her heart issues with most things intellectually coming easy as they grow and learn, but the matters of the heart coming not so easily.

Benson's approach to the subject as a flegling actor is brilliantly played in my view and experience with this mind set. In fact, I think you see more of him, as he really was as a young man in this role; given his own sweet, sensitive nature, which was no acting job as you watched him in all his films. Naturally, if you come from a different background growing up, you can't appreciate his characterization; but I can!  The cinematography of this film is not the best by today's standards, but its a lovely story and a treasure to have of Benson's early works that lead him to stardom during the 1970's, which was my time to be a teenager.

Thanks for making this available on Amazon.

The DVD case and slip cover came in great condition. Delivery was excellent. No complaints.  Wonderful to have it in my library!

889029,4,6304494335,"I love the 70's for the incredible revolution in film realism.  After a million Doris Day and Debbie Reynolds, 50's gee wiz, let's start a family boosterism, even the teen romance film took a turn to realism.  I must admit that Robby Benson, from distant memory, brings to mind a monkish hairdo and a toothy grin, and the awkwardness of adolescence.  In 1973's Jeremy, I was not disappointed, but actually delighted that the film essentially plays it straight with a couple of star-crossed teen lovebirds.  Contrast Jeremy's sweet, first romance with teen films that came a decade later starting with Fast Times at Ridgeway High or Dazed and Confused.  Can you see the sincerity of Jeremy's romance decline into teen cynicism?  Then in the 90's you get films like She's All That where the main concern is bedding a virgin for a bet. No, I will take Jeremy any time.

Benson is derided as gawky, Jewish kitsch.  I must say he did a fine job in this film.  I believe in his first phone call to lovely Glynnis O'Conner and his heroic efforts to be with her always.  She's a little older, more mature.  She appreciates Benson's cello and the romance is on.  Most of the film leads up to the romance, showing a New York, middle class, uptown life style of the 70's. No sooner than the bra strap pops does Glynnis' old man take her away.  Then you get the farewell airport scene. A tear comes to the eye.  It was kind of realistic and eternal.",1163462400,12,1437,4.51937984496124

What's good: the story, the music, Glynnis O'Connor.

What's bad: the fact that so many scenes have nothing to do with the story.  They are just there to provide local color.  They slow the movie down and reduce its power.  Make your own edited version by copying the relevant scenes onto a videotape.

What else is bad.  Robbie Benson.  He has his fans, but only his fans will like him in this.  And the ultra-closeups are repellant.

Still, this is not a film to be missed.",1162080000,5,662,4.284552845528455

I met a boy in 2003 in a wintercircus as we both work as circus artists..When the circus ended I had to go home by aeroplane...
And then a few moths later I saw Jeremy...Luckyly I was home alone, and luckily I recorded it on tape... I saw my wery own story come to life... Ever since when I miss him, I watch this movie, and as soon as I grow up enouh to own a bankcard I buy this movie on DVD so I'm sure I will always have it...

889032,2,6304494335,"A very slow moving romance between an extremely shy teenage boy (the kind who normally doesn't get the girl) and a quiet but unnaturally mature for her years teenage girl. Some people will be turned off by the slowness of it, but that's the point. It could have been a four star movie.

But then we have strange sub-plots that have nothing to do with the main story, like the idea that the boy can predict the winners of horse races with uncanny accuracy. This is impossible, but if someone could do that, then only a moron wouldn't take advantage of the skill to make money yet the kid doesn't believe in placing any bets. So down to three stars because of dumb stuff like that.

And then we look at the quality of the DVD. Grainy and blurry. This is the ugliest looking DVD I've ever seen. The original movie was filmed on 16mm, so maybe it looked that bad in the theaters. But still... it looks awful.

Other reviews have commented on the music. I liked the folk 70s song... but then the same song was repeated over and over again.",1136592000,4,1034,4.347150259067358
889033,5,6304494335,"I watched this movie as a kid when it came out and I've probably seen it about a dozen times. But it still manages to hit me in the heart.

Great acting and great camera work (using mostly available light) make you enter the hearts of the characters. ""A film with nothing going for it but the people who love it"" says the original trailer from 1973 - and that's true. It's a very simple film but in its simplicity so tender and close that you will never forget the story. It's all about love. It doesn't matter that the material is grainy and some scenes slightly out of focus. It makes you be there with the characters and invites you to take part in their story. No wonder it was the public's choice at the Cannes Film Festival of that year. A keeper!",1108252800,24,753,4.229166666666667
889034,4,6304494335,"This is a very interesting story about teen relationships and how when everything seem to be working out (something that is hard to come by today) circumstances outside of their control steps in to end it.

If you're a Glynnis O'Connor fan, as I am, then this movie is must have.  It was her first ever staring movie role.  She later teamed up with Robby Benson again for the movie Ode' To Billy Joe and the television play Our Town by Thorton Wilder (the 1977 version).

Gatekeeper reviews movies only for adult themes, sex, nudity and violence.  This movie contains brief nudity (Glynnis is seen topless when taking off her bra and nipple shows through her long hair for a split second).  Despite this one scene, this movie is suitable for the whole family to watch.  Although it is dated, how it depicts relationships, affection, parental respect and commitments are relevant even today.",1090886400,11,890,4.777777777777778

7872832,5,6304494335,"""Jeremy"" is the most honest and realistic portrayal of a classic teen love story that I've seen so far.

Being a 90s kid, I grew up with watching A LOT of ""teen"" romances where characters were played by models in their early to mid 20s. Not once was anyone ever bare faced without a good layer of makeup and airbrushing. THANKFULLY this is not the case here.

Both characters are portrayed by teens themselves, both of which are attractive in their own right, but not drop dead gorgeous. Both actors were also relatively inexperienced at the time, and in certain scenes- it shows. Truthfully though, it really doesn't harm the movie in any major way, it just adds realism to their characters.

I enjoyed seeing how much I truly gravitated toward these two teens- neither one fell into any typical cliches- Jeremy may like classical stories, playing his cello, and remaining rather introverted (and a bit socially inept)- but that doesn't stop him from playing basketball for fun, hanging out with his best friend, or enjoying horse races. He felt like a real person.  Susan feels just as honest- she's pretty, well-read, and mature for her age; Yet, due to the fact that she had to raise herself, is without much of an identity or ability to connect with others.

So when these two characters do get together- it makes logical sense. It doesn't come off as some dork who gets the hot girl just because he's nice. Which was pretty much the status-quo in 80s, 90s... and even in today's movies. These two have great chemistry, and their short lived passion feels very genuine.

As for the quality of the film itself, the image is pretty grainy at times- this was a low budget film after all. The editing could have used a bit more polishing too, the quick cuts throw off the pacing near the end of the film.

The only critique I have is just the pacing of the film in general- it's snail slow in the beginning, and rather choppy throughout the rest of it.

Even so, these characters and the story of first love should be treasured as the true gem that it is.",1481500800,2,2056,4.5528455284552845
7872833,5,6304494335,"I watched this as a teenager and wanted to see it again.  It's still a great movie about two kids who are talented in their own areas, but not standouts socially who meet and fall in love.  It's a movie about young love and having to let go when you don't want to, and first heart break.  The young actors were excellent.  I haven't seen Robby Benson in a long time, but the girl is on one of the crime dramas (Law and Order, I think) and plays a lawyer in a recurring role.  Today's teens may have trouble relating, since everything is so different, but it probably won't bore them to death, lol.",1478476800,,597,4.201754385964913
