Ive seen Backyardignas afew times. i like the music and the dancing and animation are pretty cool, but what are they supose to be anyway?  i mean I know one's a hippo and ones moose and one's a bird but what the smell is that pink thing?  I've never seen a animal what looks like that before.  man its wierd.  OKay so like you can tell the pink things supose to be a black person and that dingo or whatever's supose to be a white guy and ther's this one named Pablo whos likee suppose to be a mexican or something, but what about Chinese people i mean come on.  Really.  What about chinese people??  Its like this one time when I was in this chinese restraunt you know but only Mexican people worked there, so i said ""Yo!  Where's all the Chinese dudes?"" and everybody laughed and people said i was stupid.  turns out el chico is really a spanish name--no fooling!
Anyway Backyardigans is realy cool and you shuld check it out",1146787200,,990,4.274193548387097
2455808,5,B000CCD02Q,"There are twenty episodes in all for this series, and this is the fourth DVD, each with four episodes.  The fifth is due out in May, and you'd better believe I've already pre-ordered it.

The ones before this are &#8220;It's Great to Be a Ghost&#8221; (2005), &#8220;The Snow Fort&#8221; (2005), and &#8220;Polka Palace Party&#8221; (2006).

This DVD has the following episodes:

Cave Party: Set to a calypso beat, albeit a somewhat dated version of the genre.  The friends go back in time to the Ice Age to howl at the moon, and invent some pretty useful things along the way.

Race Around the World: Not sure of the music genre here, but the friends take part in a tough race involving running through the jungle, snowboarding, kayaking across the ocean and hiking across the desert.

Eureka: A couple of crusty old prospectors and a couple of brilliant scientists join forces to find gold and dinosaur bones in them thar hills

Castaways: To a Bossa Nova beat, three castaways get a little help from a mysterious benefactor to survive on a deserted island.

Another excellent source of entertainment for kids and the adults who love them.

2455809,5,B000CCD02Q,"We're big backyardigans fans at our house. Our 1.5-year-old son is mesmerized by the show, the characters are cute and very watchable, and the music is suprisingly entertaining and listenable even after many, many viewings.

The bonus episodes on this disc are ""Eureka"" and ""Castaways,"" both of which feature some of the best music in the entire series. The featured episodes ""Cave Party"" and ""Race Around the World"" episodes are also pretty good, making this the best of the Backyardigans releases so far. This is the one I would recommend to anyone who wants to sample the series -- just put on ""Eureka,"" and try to stop yourself from singing along!

Happily, the next DVD will feature ""Surf's Up,"" which ranks up there with ""Eureka"" and ""Castaways"" in our book.

A big thanks to Nick Jr. and Paramount for releasing this great series on DVD so quickly.",1142553600,12,855,4.802721088435374

Great for girls and boys as early as toddlers.  As far as how old kids would still enjoy it, well, our near 11 year old still sings the songs and watches it when we have it on for the younger kids.  Great price, too!  I believe the episodes on the DVD are from the first season.  This DVD has a lot of our favorites, Cave Party, Eureka! (diggin' for gold!), Race Around the World, and Castaways.  Race Around the World is probably by far our favorite.  The lyrics alone are hysterical!",1395446400,,620,4.37719298245614

I was sad when they took it off, but very excited when I realized it was on Amazon Prime and that I could be the DVD's for my daughter. Would recommend it for anyone with small children because it encourages children to use their imagination. Plus the characters and music are very diverse.  I also love that they use animals as characters!",1380672000,,416,4.333333333333333

2455872,5,B000CCD02Q,"Based on my age, I should be absolutely ashamed that I love this series, because I'm oldish. I love the songs, singing and the photorealistic dance movements. And this is one of my favorite Backyardigans DVDs. I love all the eps on this dvd, but the title of my review is a quote from Pablo that comes from the episode ""Eureka!"", which is exactly how I feel about this series. When my niece gets older, maybe she'll be interested in this series (she is 7 months and not interested in much anything except sticking things in her mouth). She'll have plenty of DVDs to choose from, though. Like another reviewer says, this series is like a bunch of mini Broadway performances. And the stories are super creative and refreshing. The characters speak great English and use words/ideas much bigger than that of their target audience (parent service). Like ""Cave Party,"" a great storyline and theme, but not sure how many 2-3 year olds understand inventing the way it is presented by the show. But I'm sure it's mind-expanding for kids older than 3, and the theme was presented very well.

The first episode I happened to see on tv when flipping through was ""Who Goes There?""  The title song on that episode was wonderful and the flamenco music (I actually recognized that theme) was spot-on, while I wish I could imitate Tyrone's dance moves!

What got me was the great songs and amazing dance moves, which amazed me because I normally cannot stand kid musicals and songs (like most anything on Nick Jr.) But the amount of attention this show puts into introducing different genres of music (many that I was not familiar with) had made me want to discover each genre of music over the course of the many episodes now available (only discovered this year for me). You can tell the singers (of different ethnicities) are actually kids with great vocal range, and the characters' speaking voice actors are kids as well, making everything sound very authentic. I only wish I could dance like these characters, which are actually animated based on actual live dancers for each skit, which are why the dance moves actually look so real. This is one of those shows that I think is so ingenious that I imagine how interesting life would have been if I had watched this when I was the target audience's age.",1377993600,,2292,4.682382133995037

The characters speak clearly, using proper english.  I think that sets a good example.  The singing and dancing are high quality.

2455912,5,B000CCD02Q,"As usual, another excellent Backyardigans DVD. As a rule, I find shows aimed for toddlers are unbearable. But this tends to be something I can watch with my daughter and enjoy.

The main episode, ""Cave Party"" features a Calypso theme. The other shows and themes are:

""Race Around The World"", which features a Zydeco theme.
""Eureka!"" features a Township jive theme.
""Castaways"" features a Bossa Nova/Brazilian samba theme.

The CGI animation looks great. The characters are sweet, and they have the cutest little singing voices. I love the way they dance. All around, it's a great show. I have no problem letting my daughter watch it, and she remains captivated throughout each show.

I tend to dislike children's programming that is really aimed for the older set, meaning any show that is overly sarcastic or ""snarky."" I mean, call it what it is - because I enjoy the heck out of stuff like that, but I don't think it's entirely appropriate for small children. I'm really glad we have shows like The Backyardigans to turn to.",1185494400,3,1027,4.818181818181818

For good or bad, the stories have entered into my child's playlife and imagination, as she plays out the adventures in racing day, or proclaims ""I'm Tarzan!""

2455945,5,B000CCD02Q,"My 14 month-old baby boy & I are huge fans of these characters. I recommend any of the 4 Backyardigans DVDs on the market so far. My son loves the castaways' episode in this particular DVD. It calmed him down. I mainly prefer the cave party. It's so ingenious how the writer tied great inventions with the story... The music, dances, images are fantastic.

For those who are so confuse about what kind of animals are the characters or why they have been stereotyped with foreign names. Let me suggest you to look at the special features in ""It's great to be a ghost"" DVD & to read about the writer @ Nickjr.com. Thus, you would learn that:

""Uniqua"" is an undefined species (She looks like an ant to me, but she isn't according to her creator). She is a female because of her pink color & her name means unique (only one of its kind)

""Pablo"" is a penguin. Penguins are distinctive animal of the Antarctica (South Pole). The closest countries to this continent are Argentine & Chile (Spanish speaker countries in South America. As a matter of fact, both countries claim sovereign over the Antarctic territory). It's for this reason his name is in Spanish.

""Tasha"" is a hippo. Hippopotamus are original from Africa. So, her name has African flavor. She tends to be a very ""bossy"" character because hippos are very territorial.

""Tyrone"" is a moose. His name means ""Young Soldier"". That is what his character is about. He always follows the group & is a very full of life team player - like a young soldier.

""Austin"" is a kangaroo (My husband insists Austin is a wallaby - a small kangaroo specie). Kangaroo is an Australian animal, & Austin is a common name over there

I also read that the author selected these species, because there were so littler children stories with this kind of animals @ the time she created the Backyardigans",1147478400,9,1836,4.5963302752293576
2455946,5,B000CCD02Q,"The Backyardigans are a great joy in our household with a not-quite 3-year-old and a 15-month-old.  Our older child also has a speech delay, and both children are benefitting greatly from the language in this series.  Cave Party seems to be particularly good, since the kids help to identify ""new"" things.  Unlike other reviewers, I think that the choice of animals and names is perfect.  My older child understand perfectly that Tyrone is a moose, Pablo is a penguin (and there are South American penguins, hence the South American name), Tasha is a hippo, Austin is a kangaroo (Austin, Australia - the tail is a dead give away to a 3-year-old), and Uniqua is a lizard.  All of the names are also easily pronounced by a small child, which is great.  Both of my children love Eureka, too, so we were happy that it was included as a bonus; both kids pretend to look for bones or gold in our yard just like the Backyardigans.  Well done once again!",1147046400,4,946,4.562130177514793
