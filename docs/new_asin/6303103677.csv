560246,5,6303103677,"A story of courage and adventure all set in the Southern Africa bush... Jock has become a folk-hero in South Africa... watch this and you'll now why! Based on the novel by Fitzpatrick, it is one of those rare flics where  the film is as good as the book. A cultural tear-jerker of an adventure,  with a superb soundtrack to match - curtousy of Johnny Clegg and Savuka  (formally Jaluku). This film puts a whole mew meaning to the phrase ""  a dog is a mans best friend"".... nead I say more! If you like dogs,  adventure and a touch of African history then this is the film for you...  GET IT!",953337600,22,591,4.232142857142857
560247,5,6303103677,"A wonderful ""family"" movie, of which there are all too few these days.  Music track by South African Johnny Clegg is outstanding.  Yes, it's a tear jerker, in a league with 'Sounder.'  Like 'Sounder,' this film will  teach children and adults alike a lot about a time and culture of which  Americans are barely aware.  My daughter, who is now 18, loves this movie  as much today as when she was a child.",943315200,13,403,4.438356164383562
7837539,5,6303103677,"Excellent story about the love of a man and his canine companion until the animals passing. It showed how dogs have given us their absolute all. We are the center of their universe and that we as humans are the focus of their love, faith and trust. It is without a doubt the best deal man has ever made. Would love to have another copy.",1403568000,,336,4.184615384615385
7837540,3,6303103677,"This was a tough one to track down, bought as a gift for someone who was moving away.  They always raved about the movie , so it was purchased as a going away gift.  Although I have never viewed it, they still have it in their colection",1398988800,,236,4.0
7837541,5,6303103677,good movie  lots of funny stuff to go with the sad parts it's based on a real story so watch it,1380672000,,95,3.5238095238095237
7837542,5,6303103677,It's the South African version of Huck Fin/Tom Sawyer.  Great story and the best treatment by far. A great view of the opening up of Africa 150 years ago,1355529600,,153,4.275862068965517
7837543,5,6303103677,"I am originally from Zambia and then moved to South Africa when I was about 16 when I first saw this movie and Loved the story.  In South Africa I bought the video and showed my kids as they grew. I loved JOCK in this movie so much that my husband and I went and bought ourselves a Staffordshire Terrier and he was the best dog I ever had.  Very loyal, loving and enegetic,  his name was Max and he made a wonderful pet and he loved our children, he was very obedient.
I now live in USA and was looking for a Birthday Present for my husband and remembered how much he enjoyed this movie and bought it for him.  It made him very happy and it has brought back many fond memories, and yes I still cry when I watch this movie.",1265241600,2,722,3.9930555555555554
7837544,4,6303103677,"A great old story, with beautiful African scenery and although this is an old film, it is still credible by today's filming standards. My only complaint is that there is no additional info inside the box regarding the year the film was made,locations, actors, background to the story etc etc. It is a very basic copy of the original video version with no extras.",1264464000,,362,4.671875
7837545,5,6303103677,"I have watched both makes of the movie, although I have to say the original Jock of the Bushveld is preferred to by many people out there. Whether you watch the second make or the book,you will always have a tear in your eye.
The movie shows courage and determination in South Africa and I hope this movie shows people what a great country it is.
If anyone knows of where the original can be bought then please let me know.",1083283200,8,423,4.234567901234568
7837546,5,6303103677,I guess I saw the original version too.  Jock was accidentally shot at the end.  Hard to watch.  Kinda like Old Yeller.,1028851200,5,119,4.318181818181818
