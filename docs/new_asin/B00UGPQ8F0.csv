8705819,3,B00UGPQ8F0,"Perky optimist, Patricia, aggressively pursues Alfred, who is a noncommittal, unemotional nihilist. This is an anti-violence/anti-murder film, but it goes about its message in a twisted, bizarre way. Supposedly a black comedy with a message, this film is too hokey and too dated to provide more than a few chuckles. Too much of the film is simply annoying. Its OK to skip this one.",1476316800,,381,4.96875
