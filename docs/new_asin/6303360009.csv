629677,5,6303360009,"If not poignant, an endearing film nonetheless. The acting is typical of 1940s films, which is not meant to be demeaning at all. Just that today's viewers may find the longer shots and longer dialog a little strange. Ginger Rogers, as usual, makes a strong appearance as a somewhat confused target of two completely different men. The plot has a moral tone and is relatively simple despite seventy-five years since made. Even believable once you realize that at one time Philadelphia was considered a real snobby town. This movie should appeal to those that like chic flicks with a happy ending, sans the emphasis on the graphic and often crude nature of today's contemporary films.",1436140800,3,682,4.939130434782609

629792,3,6303360009,"Christopher Morley's 1939 novel was hot stuff, a best seller about a working girl who has an affair with a society gent, gets pregnant, and has an abortion.  Censorship prevented a direct screen adaptation, and when the movie arrived it found Kitty (Ginger Rogers) forced to choose between illicit passion with a magazine publisher (Dennis Morgan) and respectable love with a doctor (James Craig.)  At the time, the film was considered adult; today, it reads as fat-free cheese.

Ginger Rogers was one of the hardest working actresses of the 1930s, and she occasionally scored in such films as STAGE DOOR, but she was generally thought of as a musical comedy actress who had the good fortune to team up with Fred Astaire.  In the 1940s she began to step away from that screen persona through a series of dramas, with the title role in KITTY FOYLE among her first efforts.  It was very different from her earlier performances, and it was solid enough to beat out Bette Davis, Joan Fontaine, Katherine Hepburn, and Martha Scott for the Oscar.  But Rogers is really the only thing the film has going for it.  Although the supporting cast is quite good, Morgan and Craig are pretty ho-hum and surprisingly interchangeable.  The narrative devices (Kitty arguing with herself in the mirror; the use of a snowglobe to seque from episode to episode; etc.) were greatly admired at the time, but today they seem clunky, and the script seems unduly high-flown.  Everything gets the Hollywood Glamour Treatment, whether it is appropriate or not.

Whatever its merits from a modern standpoint, KITTY FOYLE has proven influential in a number of unexpected ways.  The snowglobe device  would return in CITIZEN KANE, and a dress designed for Rogers to wear in the film proved unexpectedly popular and durable and to this day is known as ""a Kitty Foyle dress"" in the fashion trade.  The DVD presents the film in good condition, and it offers a few bonuses that include two radio adaptations of the film.  KITTY FOYLE is very much a film of its time that could not transcend the limitations of its time, and so it is probably best left to admirers of 1940s melodrama and fans of Ginger Rogers.  Recommended to them.

SYNOPSIS--
Kitty (Rogers) is a working class girl with two suitors: one a Philadelphia blueblood, the other a struggling young physician. Her story is an emotional roller coaster that hits every soap opera button-- romance, marriage, divorce, pregnancy, a stillbirth, and finally a decision to be made: become mistress to a man with a wife and child when he moves alone to Brazil, or accept the marriage proposal of the second, whom Kitty cares for but not with the intense love that she feels for the first.

Ginger Rogers handles a challenging role well. Her performance here is to this reviewer's mind not Oscar-worthy. Perhaps the award was recognition for her 1930s body of work.

629882,1,6303360009,"I've heard about this clunker for years, have known about Ginger's Oscar-worthy performance as the title character and expected something pretty decent in the way of film making.  One of the one star reviews captures perfectly my feelings, i.e. when is this thing ever going to end?  I cannot believe how boring and meaningless a movie this is.  It makes me wonder if the book from which it was adapted was just as dull or if they managed, somehow, to excise all the interesting parts when they wrote the script.

No one, and I mean NO ONE of the characters has any depth whatsoever.  Kitty and what's his name...Wyn...fall madly in eternal love because they each find the other physically attractive.  Is that shallow or what?  The doctor dude falls for her because she's not a gold-digger.  Wow.  That's really delving into the character of someone you want to marry.  And he's hardly even in the picture, so to speak, and apparently sees Kitty all of 2-3 times before he sees her clutching some newborn and decides to pop the old question.  Drivel, I say.

The weirdest, scariest part is that Kitty knows quite well Wyn has a 5 y.o. child as well as a wife whom he has no problem at all dumping to go live in South America and things it would be swell if Kitty were to tag along.  He doesn't care about his wife, child or Kitty's potential life as an unmarried slut.  He completely lacks character.  She, in turn, actually considers taking him up on his appalling proposal.  In fact, the entire movie is really all about her better nature trying to slap some sense into her.  I don't know, I just can't do justice in descibing the stupidity of this entirely ridiculous flick.

In reality, people---women and men---make bad decisions all the time, every day.  And many movies have been made about human frailty and the consequences of falling in love with trashy people.  But generally those movies are a lot more entertaining than is ""Kitty Foyle"".

I guess G.R. is okay and actually more or less transcends the lousy material she's given to work with.  Dennis what's-his'name?  He's so lame and corny it's really hard to imagine falling in love with him.  This guy's always shallow and ininteresting in whatever movie he's in. Ginger's performance still no reason to waste you time watching this piece of crap.",1265932800,2,2314,4.670792079207921
629883,2,6303360009,"One puzzles over the celebrity attached to this film. What has it, after all, to offer? Whatever the novel's merits, the screen play is a tired collection of pulpy womens' magazine clichs, already quite played out by 1940.

For Ginger Rogers, her lead as ""Kitty"" is anything but new turf, (and hardly Oscar worthy) and is in fact, both in dialog and situations a retread of many of her thirties roles. In listening to Kitty, one hears echos of Rogers in the 30s in all those working class melodramas--as hat check girl, manicurist, chorine, carnival vendor etc, --the girl whose hard boiled bon mots conceal an inner decency.

Then there are the other hackneyed ingredients. We have, for example, a tired romantic triangle in which the star has her choice of two stalwart, handsome leading men, Gladys Cooper in the mink collar on the camel back sofa (again), Kitty's father, a Faith and Begora tippling Irishman, (a la Charles Winninger the other flustered shamrock pater in all those Judy Garland vehicles), wisecracking plain Jane roommates who eat sandwiches as they let down Murphy Beds, and a really embarrassingly bad scene in which Kitty ""tells off"" her high born in laws, that seems drawn of equal parts Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford, and Joan Blondell.

After hearing her ""corn beef and cabbage are better than Beef Wellington!"" style denunciation, you'll be on the side of the aristocrats.

It doesn't help that a puffy faced Rogers (then only 30) photographs much older, perhaps owing to an unflattering selection of brunette coiffures. Indeed, she looks MUCH better 10 years later, as witness the ""Manhatten Downbeat"" section of ""Barkleys of Broadway"" or ""Storm Warning"" (1951).

At least this film's sets were able to be re-purposed to much greater advantage, particularly by Val Lewton in his ""Seventh Victim,"" (the speakeasy in ""Kitty Foyle"" receives better exposure as Natalie Cortez' Greenwich Village living room). Just for fun try to see how many other sets and props from ""KF"" end up in the ""Seventh Victim.""

But for all that, even some of ""Kitty's"" own sets are leftovers, notably one first seen in the Lucile Ball vehicle, ""Beauty for the Asking.""

Strictly for fans of left-over stew or films with unjustifiably high reputations.

(back in those days of pre-Marlon Brando, all stars had that ""star"" look to them whether they were playing a poor beggar or a rich heiress)

I was caught up in the movie just like that.  Only after the movie ended did I find out that the main character Kitty was Ginger Rogers and she'd won an Oscar for her role in this movie with the same name:  Kitty Foyle.  It made sense to me why she won the Oscar that year.  Ginger was Kitty.

I had no idea she had made any dramas.  I only knew about her dancing with Fred Astaire.  I was told I was watching a Ginger Rogers marathon and did not move until I watched another of her movies, ""It Had to be You.""

629923,5,6303360009,"Ginger Rogers stepped off the dance floor and into dramatic movies in the 1940's.  This classic love story, subtitled ""The Natural History of a Woman,"" is a great introduction to her work for those not familiar with it.

She plays the part of Kitty Foyle, a working class girl with lots of moxie and a desire to have all the finer things in life that only a rich husband could provide.  The movie begins at the end when she has until midnight to choose between two lovers:  her former boss, the handsome and wealthy Wynn Strafford (Dennis Morgan) of Philadelphia's Main Line Society who can offer her an unmarried arrangement or the poor yet dedicated doctor (James Craig) who has courted her and wants to marry her.  The story unfolds in flashbacks as Kitty gazes into a snow globe and remembers all the heartache and complex situations that have brought her to this night.

Notable for its depiction of a working class girl and her shattered dreams, this earned Ginger Rogers the Academy Award for Best Actress.  Included in the special features on the DVD are two appropriate cartoons:  a Tom and Jerry episode entitled ""Kitty Foiled"" and a classic spoof of the movie entitled ""Bad Luck Blackie.""",1196035200,5,1199,4.730769230769231

Lo and behold, she can do more than just sing, dance, and act like a tough-street-smart gal.... she can convincingly portray an entire range of human emotions known to man. and do it well.

I am not biased when I say that Ginger Rogers' performance in this film is flawless. The story is now a bit old-fashioned for the modern-day-audience but in her quiet and loud ""Judas Priest"" moments are filled with motivation and meaning. There were moments where she could bring me to absolute tears. and during the entire duration of the film, I was constantly empathizing with Kitty.

The only problem I had was maybe seeing her playing Kitty as a 15 year old. In all honesty, it was not believable that a woman with such mature looks could be an early teen.

But no matter no matter... Ginger was out to prove something when she took on this role and by Judas Priest, she truly did. On an important sidenote, Dennis Morgan is absolutely beautiful as the idealistic and romantic Wynn.

After initially rejecting the role as too sentimental, Ginger Rogers found the title character of Kitty Foyle to be an Oscar winner and a career breakthrough. Released in 1940, only a year after her nine-picture partnership with Fred Astaire ended, Kitty Foyle helped establish Rogers as a nonmusical box-office star. The film portrays a white-collar working girl who receives a warm and welcome marriage proposal from Mark (James Craig), a kindly but humble doctor. As soon as she accepts, however, she receives a different proposition, this one from her former love, wealthy socialite Wyn (Dennis Morgan), who plans to flee his life and his wife and asks Kitty to join him and live in unwedded bliss in South America. Kitty then recounts her life in flashback to help her choose which man to love. Rogers gives an appealing performance as the feisty yet vulnerable Kitty, who makes up in moxie what she lacks in social status. Did she really deserve the Best Actress Oscar over Bette Davis in The Letter, Joan Fontaine in Rebecca, Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story, and Martha Scott in Our Town? Well, evidently Rogers had real-life moxie too. --David Horiuchi

Product Description

Known for light comedies and her partnership with Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers stepped off the dance floor and into 1940's Oscar spotlight with her Best Actress turn as Kitty, an indomitable working-class girl who endures the rejection of Philadelphia society, makes her own way as a single woman and ultimately chooses between an unmarried arrangement with Main Line scion Wynnewood Strafford VI (Dennis Morgan) or marriage to a struggling physician (James Craig). Rogers' deserved Academy Award confirmed she was more than a dance star - a fact humorously underscored when she returned to the studio and was greeted by staffers and actors in top hats and tails. Jane Wyman won the Best Actress Academy Award for her sensitive portrayal of Belinda, capturing the girl's affecting isolation, awakening desire to learn and ultimate triumph. Directed by Jean Negulesco and co-starring Lew Ayres, Charles Bickford and Agnes Moorehead (all four Oscar nominees* for their fine work), Johnny Belinda (nominated for a total 11 Oscars including Best Picture) blends atmosphere, nuance and high drama into a heartbreaking classic",1140220800,6,2361,5.254641909814324
630016,2,6303360009,"I had heard all the hype about this film and Ginger's Oscar, but after several viewings, I still find the film rather flat as an experience, and Ginger's Oscar is still a mystery.  I guess it proves the adage about winning one ""For women, play plain or ugly (remember Charlize Theron) or play against type""",1132444800,5,306,4.5636363636363635
630017,5,6303360009,"Ginger Rogers was very popular, both within the Hollywood community, and with the moviegoing public. With two strong performances in 1940, she took home the Oscar despite strong competition. Rogers perfectly captured the dilema of every American girl who worked for a living. Her portrayel of a young woman having to decide between a young woman's daydream of what love would be like and the real thing is flawless. Sam Wood directed this very entertaining film based on Christopher Morley's popular book.

Ginger is Kitty Foyle, a career girl from Philadelphia who falls for her boss, Wyn Strafford (Dennis Morgan), in what she thinks is everything she's dreamed about all her life. Wood used a snowglobe as a transitional device to Kitty's flashbacks of their romance, just as George Stevens had used a phonograph in Penny Serenade the previous year. Kitty and Wyn are no longer together, their brief marriage ending in divorce when it finally becomes clear to Kitty that her Irish American moxie can not overcome Wyn's old-money family in their Darby Mill--Griscom Street romance.

Kitty has moved on and has a chance for something real with a young but poor doctor portrayed by James Craig. But it is a down to earth and more practical love, and when Wyn suddenly appears to take her away once more, but not as his wife, she must decide which path to choose. As she packs to run away with Wyn, she argues with her conscience and remembers.

Ernest Cossart is very good as Kitty's pop, trying to steer her in the right direction. He may have been born four drinks below par, as Kitty affectionately teases him, but he is wise enough to see Wyn's weak character, which will never allow him to break from his society family and make a real life with his daughter. Kitty will face two tragedies simultaneously in this warm and sentimental story of an American working girl trying to have it all.

Rogers did deserve the Oscar because she is everything in this film. She may have been the only actress around who could have so readily been accepted to represent an entire generation of young women during the 1940's. They viewed her as one of their own, even though the glamour of Hollywood was part of her story as well. She was the American girl made good, and her performance here is flawless.

A fine ending showed not only Kitty's Irish American moxie, but her growth and maturity as well. This is a fine film with a terrific performance from Ginger Rogers that is very much a product of the era it was made. A fine score from Roy Webb adds to this gentle story of letting the dream of love go in favor of the real thing. A must own for Ginger's fans and a good one for film buffs to add to their collection.",1131494400,46,2712,4.606625258799172
630018,5,6303360009,"Ginger won the Oscar for playing this part despite some stiff competition.  She's decidedly out of character as a white-collar girl with an old school attitude.  I love when she grumbles, ""People always make a big deal about the Old West and the brave women of the covered wagons.  They don't seem to care as much about their modern-day equivalents, the secretaries--the women of the covered typewriters.""  With her quivering lower lip and her turned-up chin, she makes us care for Kitty Foyle, a girl from the poor side of the tracks who makes good with the rich playboy Wynnewood Strafford the III, or for short, ""Win,"" played skillfully by the wonderful Dennis Morgan, possibly Hollywood's most under-rated star player of the 1940s.  Morgan could sing too but he was best playing men whose love for their leading lady was always tested by some kind of addiction or other handicap, some sort of weakness.  Here his Achilles heel is his family and their swanky social position.

Gladys Cooper would have a fit if she found out that Dennis was dating Ginger Rogers, and in the book of course, Kitty and Win don't get married but carry on a ""back street"" sex affair anyhow.  Moviegoers even in 1940s were agile enough to read between the lines and to guess that the baby Ginger loses in the movie was a real ""love child.""  You'd have to have a heart of stone not to feel strangle prickles behind your eyes, like tears, when Ginger realizes that she has lost the baby.  Luckily Dr. Mark is there to pick up the pieces--James Craig, another very good actor, playing a young intern who loves Kitty even despite the fact that her father's a boozehound and she will never enter the Social Register or Main Line Philly society.  I wonder if Grace Kelly ever saw KITTY FOYLE and based some of her choices in men on Kitty's Philadelphia binary.  Between this film and BACHELOR MOTHER you would think Ginger Rogers a very maternal figure, but anyone who met her in real life knew that there was no room for children in her heart; in some ways she was a very lonely lady despite her many accomplishments and all the famous men she attracted to her side (think ""Lady in the Dark,"" probably the part she played that was the most like the real life Ginger Rogers."")

The subtitle of this movie was ""The Natural History of a Woman"" and was supposed to provide a quasi-scientific, or sociological, study of class.  Far from it, but it's a treat anyhow.",1113436800,7,2436,4.608796296296297
630019,3,6303360009,"Many old films & the movie stars in them look old & don't stand up well. But Ginger Rodgers does. She won an Oscar as Kitty Foyle 1940 & that was an excellent choice. With her in it the movie has aged very well.

  Basically she is having a conversation with herself on a very fatefull night. She has to choose between a rich, married man she loves & a poor, but good man, a doctor for the underclass (but with a great sense of humor). He also loves her & who wouldn't. She likes him a lot. The movie is a flashback on her relationship with these two men. What will she do? She has until midnight to decide.",1093305600,14,607,4.041666666666667
630020,5,6303360009,"Any best actress oscar winner of 1940 would have been controversial. I think Ginger deserved it as well as any of the others. She is wonderful in this drama, and she portrays KItty with a certain realness. watch her facial expressions. I believe that Ginger had the most expressive and beautiful eyes in hollywood history. after losing her baby in childbirth, kitty's look on her face whenever she sees a child afterwards is devestating. the whole cast is fine, and you could cut Gin and Dennis Morgan's chemistry with a knife. Ginger had a strange power to bring out so much chemistry from all her leading men. In the early scenes, she is adorable as little kitty. I don't believe that this is a soap opera, because the situations are NOT ridiculous and the characters are very real, but nevertheless it is a heavier type of drama, so don't expect a SWING TIME-like experience, and keep the tissues handy. I highly recommend this film, not only for Ginger's performance, but for the movie as a whole.",1086393600,28,1001,4.693181818181818
630021,4,6303360009,"Whenever Ginger Rogers' name is bandied about, it is usually done so in the context of a musical, usually co-starring with Fred Astaire.  Her acting ability was most often hidden in a rousing background of song and dance.  But with KITTY FOYLE, Ginger showed that she could play it straight too.  Kitty is a lower class Irish lass who has the great bad luck to fall for an upper crust Philadelphia scion (Dennis Morgan) whose family has long since planned his future, one that does not include a poor Irishwoman.  They marry but the gap between them is too wide.  Exit the scion and enter a poor but kindly doctor (James Craig) who loves her enough for her to have to choose between them.
The charm of KITTY FOYLE rests squarely on Miss Rogers' ability to create the aura of a woman who loves two men, although unequally.  Morgan and Craig are purposely bland, and very nearly interchangeable, so it is no surprise that Kitty bounces back and forth between them. Along the way, director Sam Wood presents New York as a backgound that is just perfect for young lovers to meet in quaint Italian restaurants.  Eduardo Ciannelli is cast against type as an Italian waiter who brings to mind Mister Botchagaloop of Abbott & Costello fame.  By the time the closing credits roll, it comes only as a minor surprise as to which lover Kitty chooses.  KITTY FOYLE is no great film, but it is a grabbing piece of pre-WWII soap that showcases the talents of an actress who for far too long had been admired more for her hoofing legs than her thespian skills.",1053216000,5,1544,4.565217391304348

It is interesting to see the character's interactions with two very different men, and there's the suspense of wondering which she will choose.  Enjoy!",1018742400,7,459,5.319444444444445

I say her at Disney World in a parade with Mickey and Minnie  after she had a stroke and rather drunk besides...she will always bring  fond memories back to me of that era...Thanks Ginger",940636800,3,648,4.195121951219512
