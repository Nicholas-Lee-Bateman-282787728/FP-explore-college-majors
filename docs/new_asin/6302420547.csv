7825225,5,6302420547,"I've read the book many times throughout my life and I've also seen the documentary which I've always enjoyed.  I'm very proud of my grandpa who was one of the camera men on this film, Willard Van der Veer.  He won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography.  I loved seeing him cranking that camera in the beginning of the film.",1406592000,3,327,4.416666666666667
7825226,4,6302420547,"This film came out when talkies were just coming in.  The first 5 minutes has Byrd introducing the film and thanking the public.  He is obviously reading cue cards, and is a little stiff.  He looks more natural in the expedition footage.

The film starts out silent with title cards, or I should say with only music accompaniment.  The last 15 minutes of the film have post-expedition play-by-play commentary by Floyd Gibbons of the Ford Trimotor flight over the South Pole.

We see the Trimotor being dragged onto the ice unassembled, the expedition of the Fokker Super-Universal and it's wrecking in a sudden storm, the rescue by the Fairchild FC-2W2 ""Stars And Stripes"", the sheltering of the Trimotor before the same storm reaches Little America, the final assembly of the Trimotor after the long polar night, the trans-polar flight, and a last look at the Fairchild and Trimotor  in the distance as they take their leave from Antarctica.  (The planes were recovered with the Trimotor now residing at the Henry Ford Museum, and the Fairchild at the Virginia Aviation Museum.)

Unfortunately, Paramount flipped some of the footage of the Trimotor, as the expedition name and the wing serial number are seen in reverse in two shots.

At the time of this posting, copies were still available directly through Milestone.",1338422400,2,1320,4.986301369863014
7825227,5,6302420547,"With Byrd at the South Pole, won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography on 1929-1930,indeed excellent. This documentary is a vivid example of the transition from silent movies to talkies. The film restoration  allows movie lovers to view a picture that was a great hit in the 30's, and exposed the public to new lands through the filming of a scientific exploration.",1277510400,,368,4.935483870967742
7825228,3,6302420547,"It's tough to be totally objective in 2007 about the 1930 docudrama WITH BYRD AT THE SOUTH POLE. Definitely groundbreaking for it's time, this film ""chronicles"" the 1928-1930 expedition of Admiral Byrd and his team to conquer the Antarctic and fly over it. Cameramen Willard Van der Veer and Joseph Rucker shot this marvel in 35mm and for their work this film is to be highly recommended. This George Cukor production for then burgeoning Paramount Studio, though, is just too ""Americana rah-rah sis-boom-bah"" for many modern day thinkers. Words such as ""golly gee, boy oh boy,swell"" seem just a little TOO precious. The film extols the virtues of man against the elements and gives the dogs credit for proving themselves human (which is frankly insulting to the dogs!)WARNING TO PARENTS: lead dog, Spy, is shot for being too old and infirm and the other dogs react as they look on!

The script is pure propaganda schmaltz and is quite laughable. But,this was 1930 and unless you still act, think and talk that way, you will more than likely be amused. This is not in any way to discredit what was accomplished in Byrd's feat and in Paramount's vision for the time. The soundtrack is one big melange of Sousa Marches, American popular tune and National Anthems which will stir some to patriotic fervor and belief in the superiority of men, not man necessarily, over the universe. The entire film is very staged and Admiral Byrd, for all his bravery, appears totally inept and quite uncomfortable in front of a camera as he thanks ""Divine Providence""! One viewing will suffice.

Excellent companion films would be SHACKLETON and THE ENDURANCE.",1184716800,4,1641,4.899280575539568
7825229,5,6302420547,"Seventy-five years after the fact, this remains a fascinating visual testament to human persistence and the awesome variety of our world. At times it's difficult to believe the sheer daring of the Byrd mission and the ingenious ways the team overcame life-threatening obstacles. A ground-breaking documentary that brings a heroic, often overlooked chapter of history to life.",1182384000,6,375,5.5964912280701755
7825230,5,6302420547,"I bought this because I am interested in the story of Byrd and his dog, a Smooth Fox Terrier named Igloo, who accompanied him to both Poles on Byrd's expeditions.  It was great to see this little guy in such an alien environment as Antartica.  But the experience of seeing what these remarkable men accomplished in the most unforgiving of settings was most memorable.  The film won an Oscar for Best Cinematography in 1930, and one can see why watching this footage.",1178755200,5,466,4.658536585365853
7825231,3,6302420547,"a strange hybrid of documentary and travelog and potboiler docudrama; its clear that genres were still defining themselves when this movie was made. while much of the ""plotline"" is dubious, the heroism of the figures involved is not, and the camera work under undeniably terrifying conditions is nothing short of spectacular. i won't call this a great movie but id recommend it to anyone.",1165190400,5,388,5.078125
