This was shipped from MPLUSL company all the way from Germany! It doesn't play on my DVD player. 1st time I've ever been disappointed.",1391212800,2,152,4.428571428571429
8033780,4,B0002WYS0E,"I was anxious to get this movie because it closes the gap between this marvelous screen personality's teenage years and those of her early twenties maturity. Since this legend's death in April I have managed to find all 21 of her full-length pictures, with varying results. Some are fuzzy with poor soundtracks, others look as though they were just filmed yesterday, with sharp focus and good audio. This is one of the best, and there is definitely on-stage chemistry between Joseph Cotten and Deanna (and even a rumor started by one of the fanzine columnists that they were having an off-screen affair, which both were quick to deny). I would have appreciated a few more songs, but that is what I usually watch a Durbin movie for . . . the plots are often pretty corny, and the main reason she retired to France while still in her twenties.
If you want to see the world's richest working woman (in 1945) in action, catch this flick and enjoy Deanna's exquisite singing and the convincing love affair between the movie's principals.
Warning: this film is issued in PAL format, the one found in the U.K., and playable only on the latest generation of DVD players.",1376524800,5,1162,4.700980392156863
8033781,3,B0002WYS0E,"I couldn't watch the movie, because it was made in the UK and I don't have a DVD player that runs that type of DVD.  I am sure the movie was great, but unfortunately this is the second DVD of the same name I could not watch.  Both from the UK.",1372118400,3,243,3.7450980392156863
