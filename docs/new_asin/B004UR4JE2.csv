8442064,1,B004UR4JE2,"This DVD does not work on Macs.  I didn't even know it had to be played on a computer when I ordered it, because it just says it is a DVD.  But when you open the package it says ""PLAYS ONLY ON COMPUTER DVD PLAYER"" on the disk.  Well, all I have is a Mac, and it doesn't work on that.",1328659200,,283,3.6065573770491803
8442065,1,B004UR4JE2,This product is a home-made DVD that does not do a very good job of explaining accounting or QuickBooks.  I wish that a sample video clip would be available before I bought the DVD.,1322611200,2,181,4.323529411764706
8442066,3,B004UR4JE2,"I bought this product to learn a little more about Quickbooks than accounting. I learned about both. Is it a perfect product? No. I do not know why it has 4 star reviews. Is it worthless? Certainly not. Person with 1 star has a grudge and can't read as, in description on Amazon, it states it only plays on computer DVD's. I personally say it falls between. The only reason I am writing review is because I have used support forum it comes with and they have been quite responsive. This is worth the price alone. I must admit the chapter by chapter format is hard to get used to but it is arranged much like a book. Just view the chapter you are interested in. I also agree the voice of narrator is not the best but this is not his fault.",1307232000,2,738,4.1678321678321675
8442067,1,B004UR4JE2,"This DVD plays only on Computer - This was never mentioned in the Cover - only inside the DVD they have mentioned that it plays in Computer - Perfect way of ripping the money

The 5,4,3 stars are really the customers or these people are proxy customers to encourage other customers to buy this product?

The contents are so BAD - You can't learn anything except how to waste your money for this DVD - Such  a Horrible DVD, had the author seen his presentation once before publishing for the customers??? In nutshell buy a basic accounting book for $9 and that will speak a lot than this garbage

Quality of the Material - Extremly poor - They always show one single flow chart and a person behind speaks with lousy voice

In the back outer cover they say

You will learn

  *** Accounting Terminology
  *** How to Set up a Company
  *** How to ensure proper controls
  *** How to create Budgets
  *** How to run reports
  *** How to perform account analysis
  *** How to pay vendors
  *** How to Setup Inventory Items
  *** How to Print Invoices
  **

BUT very interesting the above topics are not all there in the DVD - How amazing they are?

They have various chapters and you have to select them one by one and they won't go automatically

Simple - SAVE MONEY - Dont buy this and AMAZON needs to protect their customers from the BAD & Poor sellers like  Accounting 101 & Beyond - Big Forgery

I wanted give NEGATIVE Stars for this product - You can not learn anything in accounting only your Blood Pressure will go up",1307145600,,1520,4.336917562724015
8442068,5,B004UR4JE2,"I found the Accounting 101 & Beyond is very useful and easy to understand. It's just like having a private tutor who walks me through the whole accounting cycle....beginning from setting up the accounting book for a new company to annual close. I have learned everything from how to record all the basic types of accounting transaction to generating the financial statements....profit & loss, income statement and cash flows in Quickbooks.

I also like the extra bonus from this DVD that teaches how to use Excel's functions to analyze the financial data.

It makes it a lot easier for me to manage my company financially. I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to learn accounting.",1305763200,2,699,4.915254237288136
8442069,5,B004UR4JE2,"The DVD helped me greatly with my principles of financial accounting class at NYU, which I am now finishing up. It went over everything I need to know about bank reconciliation and depreciation, and made it easy. I also needed to know Quickbooks for my class, but my professor didn't teach us everything we needed to know for the project. This DVD filled in the gaps and I did a solid project.",1305590400,,393,4.472222222222222
