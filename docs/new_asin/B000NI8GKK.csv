in the Netherlands and since it was here on TV it was with subtitles too. I kept this film and when it is available on DVD I certainly will buy the original too.
It`s a great ,but short film.( not yet one hour !)It touches everone watching it and it is so very well played,so natural too.
No false sentiments  as one maybe would expect. It is not a ""gay"" story.....The story happens to be about a man being gay .
He falls in love with another man while still being married to his wife. They divorce and the men live together up to the point one of them dies of aids.
The ex wife sells the flat and most of the film is about what happens in the flat when the funeral is over and it`s time to tidy up the flat but very much also both their feelings . It is not at all very sweet their conversation,but in the end they learn both their point of view about it all.",1318204800,3,982,3.9346733668341707
8177793,5,B000NI8GKK,"I use this movie in my literature class.  Students are quite surprised to learn that one of the actors was also the playwright.  (Some say that they didn't know this was possible!) They are also surprised to find they already know Harvey Fierstein from ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" a movie which was important in their childhoods.  I ask them to write about the unusual love that develops during the movie.  A few are suckered into writing about the ""kinky"" love triangle between two gay guys and a woman, but of course, that is not the point of the movie at all, as most students realize.  Since I teach in a VERY conservative county, the film is valuable educationally as well as artistically.
It's good to point out that one might expect a gay playwright to create his gay character as loveable and glamorous, which is not at all the case here.  Fierstein's character is bitter, unkind, and unfair as he attacks his lover's widow (played by Stockard Channing), who is, in contrast, a very sympathetic character who has behaved quite well to him in the property settlement from her divorce from her dead husband. Why would he make this character so unattractive?  This question defuses hostility from students who suspect one is about to show them some pro-gay propaganda.  Of course, any fair-minded viewer will come away with greater understanding and at least some sympathy for gay people, but should not feel manipulated.

I do slightly prefer the original ending of the stage version, which may have proved impractical on a movie set.

This movie makes an interesting companion piece to ""A Doll's House"" for compare-contrast papers, as, of course, does the written play version.",1256515200,6,1674,4.88339222614841
