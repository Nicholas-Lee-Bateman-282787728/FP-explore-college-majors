7718505,5,B01DL2EX6A,This is a great movie that only shows a small fraction of what a lineman has to go through to keep your power on so you can function day to day. Its nerve racking getting in a tight spot with live phases on all sides of you and one little wrong twitch will get you or someone else killed. How do I know this? Because I'm a real life lineman so I thank the ones that helped make this movie to show what the backstage hero does so you can have the power that runs your life day or night holidays and birthdays we all miss for you.,1479427200,16,528,3.8981481481481484
7718506,3,B01DL2EX6A,"This a mostly slow paced movie, that takes forever to get to the story you know is coming, as text on the screen constantly pops up telling us how many days are left until the storm hits. It's not helped by the fact that the movie is bookended by a poorly done Modern Family style where they sit on the couch and talk to the camera mokumentary, where Duncan sets up the tale (the movie in the middle is basically his response to a question). Before the storm arrives we basically see John Travolta as a biker drifter type who has asked his brother to let him be a linesman. However he's a bit of a slacker, more into showing off his new truck then concentrating on the job, so when his brother has to fix a mistake he missed, he ends up becoming the guardian of his brother's daughter, as the electrical company he works for obviously has no workplace health and safety guidelines in place for dealing with this situation and phones the brother's wife instead of sending someone around to break the news, who highly stressed dies on the road rushing to the scene.

That's basically what this movie is about. The cost cutting and lack of work place health and safety and common sense if it gets in the way of doing things quickly and restoring the power, on an electricity line that is old and hasn't really had the money put into maintaining it, which endangers the lives of the crew Travolta's character is in charge of, who is now the best and most careful tolerates no nonsense from his men linesman around. This is one of those typical management and those in the safety of their office based positions (which has a map of all their electricity lines like a subway map where when lines go down it lights up the line in red) being portrayed as stupid and evil only caring about the bottom line, prepared to sacrifice workers out in the field's lives to save a few cents here and there. There's a side story of Bailey, Travolta's character's niece being hassled by her uncle to fill out university application forms, which she's clearly avoiding. Bailey has broken up with a guy (Duncan) who her uncle hates (although we never learn why) and is mad at him for most of the film. There's also a guy fresh out of prison who likes to harass Bailey, although again there is no backstory told about him, we just know he's obviously a threat to her safety but no idea why he is obsessed with her. When we first meet him his employer threatens if he doesn't get back to work he'll call his parole officer, yet this guy doesn't seem concerned that stuff he does in public such as at a bar would put him back behind bars.

It's a pretty predictable movie, there isn't really a storyline in this film that you don't work out early how it's going to play out. Shockingly we learn at the end that 100s of people who do this in real life have been killed on the job. Travolta has an obvious (perhaps because we've seen in so many films) fake accent. It's very distracting. Duncan and the ex con characters look pretty similar too, which makes scenes like when they're fighting and even when they aren't together hard to work out which one they are. Overall it's a film that's watchable, I don't know if this was a made originally for TV movie, but it's around that quality. It's the only film I can think of that is set in the world of those who fix downed power lines and restore power during storms, so it has that uniqueness going for it. It's a shame it took an hour though to get to the reason most people are probably watching it though, leaving us with a story that was to be frank pretty boring and uninteresting up to then.",1477440000,,3620,4.377414561664191
7718507,5,B01DL2EX6A,Ithought travolta did a great job loved the movie my husband is retiererd now but his whole life a line man and electrcian .His job was hart and very dangerous. Really a great movie with heart,1474156800,,192,4.361111111111111
7718508,5,B01DL2EX6A,"Hey mr movie guy, ive been a contractor lineman in fl for 12 years and i assure i have worked in the middle of many lightning storms and a more hurricanes than i can remember.  Come into the field of my trade before you dare make assumptions.  This movie is an accurate depiction of what we go through at any moment.  Weeks away from our families in miserable conditions working 36 hours... that takes heart and trust me we don't do it for the money.",1473552000,33,450,4.270588235294118
7718509,4,B01DL2EX6A,"The other review I read said that linemen don't work in storms and the power doesn't come on till storms are over.  Excuse me.  But my husband is a Lineman.  He has worked on power lines for over 40 years and has at times worked 24/7, with only brief breaks for an hour or two of sleep and a sandwich,  to put power back during the some of the worst snow storms in history in this country.  A little credit please, for the men who do this dangerous work so that you can sit at your computer and criticize them.  Perhaps your power company men don't go out during a rain storm, but the IBEW Union workers go in some of the worst conditions.  It's truly dangerous work for which they get very little respect.",1472342400,245,706,4.185185185185185
7718510,2,B01DL2EX6A,"This is based on a true story, we are told and dedicated to the safety conscience linemen who died on the job. The film centers on Beau (John Travolta) a lineman, whose sloppy work, through circumstances ends up killing his brother Danny (Ty Olsson). Danny's wife kisses a truck on her way to the hospital leaving uncle Beau to raise his niece Bailey (Kate Bosworth). 22 years later, bailey has boyfriend issues. Eugene (Ryan Robbins) moves in next door. He has PTSD issues and an alienated wife (Julie Benz). Beau ends up working with Duncan (Devon Sawa) a man he doesn't like because of his relationship with his niece.

The whole faux drama builds up to the ""day of the storm"" which is the film's unfortunate climax.

On the plus side Travolta has lost his eerily smooth Botox face, but the role didn't suit him, who we have recently seen as a super black ops guy. I know my linemen don't climb poles during a power storm (stupid and unsafe) and my lights rarely come on before the storm is over. The film glosses over the fact our power grid is old and failing because utilities prefer to reap and share profits than reinvest. However, that is changing, one concrete pole at a time and lines moving underground.

7718511,5,B01DL2EX6A,"With relations to actual linemen who didn't like this movie, I'm sorry.  but, having had a loved one who died doing exactly what linemen do, I liked it.  I think awareness about just how dangerous this job is will be raised some by this movie.  Most people who drive by these men and women on the side of the road, don't pay them any attention or appreciate what is they do.  If only one person, watches this movie, and appreciates what linemen do for them, in my opinion, this movie has accomplished something.  The acting was great, although I thought Travolta's Texas accent was a tad overdone.  Other than that, great effects, good story, great acting.  I'd watch it again.",1528502400,,677,4.591666666666667

What a terrible job ;people risking their lives in unimaginable weather, to be struck by lightning, to give us electricity. A real lineman here says the movie is unrealistic. John Travolta did a wonderful acting  job, in his job here and as an old woman worrying about their child (niece). Horribly sad and ridiculous,that people die and the government ,power companies don't pay their families ,who have to live with all of this pain and risk .",1527897600,,503,4.715909090909091

But being from TX, former fire fighter and 2nd woman in TX to be union electrician apprentice at an industrial plant, it brought back lots of memories.

7718517,1,B01DL2EX6A,"I have lived next to a neighbor that worked his way from journeyman to foreman as a lineman for over 20 years - have a nephew through marriage that is a lineman today - they would be HORRIFIED and EMBARRASSED by this movie. My neighbor and nephew are two of the hardest working guys you'd ever meet. Intelligent, honest, true blue-collar guys who respect the danger that is inherent in working with electrical lines. This movie (and you don't find it out until the very end credits) is really made as a charity film for people who have lost their lives keeping the electrical grid up and running. For that, a huge thank you should go out because they do hard, dangerous work.

As for this movie... not even John Travolta can save it from the ridiculous plot line, the unnecessary flashback moments, the shallow (sorry actors and actresses, it's true) character development and truly poor acting from a supporting cast that had nothing to work with because even the main characters had barely more than that. That this was billed as an action movie and not a drama was a fatal mistake to begin with and feels a bit deceptive on the part of the production company and those involved with making the film. What makes it embarrassing to real linemen (male & female) is that it is unrealistic, predictable (a major weather disaster in the middle of a crew rebuilding an entire electrical grid while the mean old corporate power company is pushing them to go faster) as to where the plot is headed and tried to play linemen off as superheroes (think people who can do anything against all odds and save the world). Anyone who knows a lineman knows that they don't see themselves as heroic, but as doing a job that requires skill, patience, intelligence, care, caution and know-how. Is there risk? Yes. Sacrifice? Well, if you consider that during bad storms, for example, they may have to be away from their family (if they have one) for periods of time. My nephew, for example, went to Puerto Rico following the hurricane and is still doing work there. His comment was that not only has the media completely misportrayed the work he's doing but that this movie is not even close to realistic. Courage? Well, not everyone can climb a pole or tower and not be afraid they'll fall.

I wanted to like this movie, so I kept with it. I won't recommend it to anyone, however, because it is like a bad propaganda or recruitment film. If the story had been better, it may have been easier to overlook all the things they got wrong about linemen in general --- but it was that bad. Sad, really.",1524873600,,2579,4.568034557235421

He watched a fellow lineman die in the hospital and just like in this move he was burned over 80% of his body and the electricity left gaping holes in parts of his body where it exited.

7718544,4,B01DL2EX6A,"People are so ignorant. I'm honestly just frustrated BEYOND, seeing reviews based on ""entertainment"", rather than the importance of what the ""story"" = ""movie"" is based on. Making a movie is extremely $$$$$, & close to perfect luck at the end of a process to translate the story and get the point across, if there is a point. If your just making a movie for entertainment value, watch ""Transformers"" as much as you want if you, if you want to be entertained. If your watching a movie & you come to the end, realizing awareness of something you knew nothing about, because you just got ""informed"" about a relevant issue, TRY to separate, the acting, delivery of lines, cinematography, etc, from the basis of the story. DUH!!!
This movie was definitely B level, not award winning by any means, but the story of ""Linemen"" needed to be told & honored. Had no idea, how many linemen lose their lives in the line of duty, how dangerous and crazy this job is,  and how brave these men are, to go to work day in and day out, not recognized (working to provide a basic necessity, or ""luxury"" depending on what you consider a necessity), and there is no awareness or celebration, or funding towards the lives of their loved ones who deserve that. We wouldn't have electrical access without these brave men!! Like most blue collar, middle class employed who are not payed what they deserved, or benefitting from contribution as a hard working American citizen.

Yes, the plot was a bit shaky but my Wife and I came to have a much better appreciation for the Women and Men who support the grid and the power it brings us with the flip of a switch.

There are just too many hackneyed lines and situations, as well as outright errors as to electricity and electricians.  Since this is a true story, it's a pity the writers couldn't have spent some time getting things right and coming up with some better dialog.  The funniest part is when there are hot primary power lines sparking all over the place around a train wreck with tankers, and the ""linemen"" are just walking around, among the live wires, wondering what to do, saying stuff like, ""we've got to find those switches!""  Where I live it takes many years of electrical work before someone becomes a lineman, but in this movie guys seem to walk in off the street and are immediately climbing poles, which they do a lot of in this movie because their bucket trucks must not work.  3 stars because it's entertaining.  1 star for the writing.",1513987200,2,955,4.688622754491018

John Travolta goes from working a refinery, where his Uncle was killed in a very similar accident at a refinery in Southeast Texas, to the one showed here in Life on the Line.  Fast forward 30 years and you've John now working the lines in Southeast Texas.  Bar scenes from Gilley's in Urban Cowboy could very well have been the same scenes in the this movie.  Ok so I'm in fantasy land, not sure the writers of Life on the Line meant for the connection to be made. And if you've never watched Urban then you wouldn't make the connection.  Life on the Line is a good movie.  Plot was a little weak, characters could've been developed deeper BUT BUT.  It was a great weather story and the examples of danger that Linemen work in was awesome.  As a tribute to them, for which their efforts typically go unnoticed, the movie scores high in my book.

As far as the side storyabout the neighbors and what happened there. That was clearly an answer to the reason of the end of the movie being what it was. In that sense the writers could have been more creative in my opinion. This was a nice movie to show what these Linemen go through because at the end of the day you are watching movies using power which is supplied and maintained by a company the linemen working for them.

A lot of this movie is badly written filler with characters that are introduced, but don't develop at all during the film. I usually tend to not mind filler in movies, but it seems like the majority of this movie is plot filler. There is also some of the small amount of character development done in bad taste in my opinion. Lastly, the ending of the movie put a really bad taste in my mouth.

Overall this film isn't very good, has some decent effects work done on it, but it doesn't really stand up to the name.

7718670,2,B01DL2EX6A,"This review is regarding the movie not the content.  As a whole there was a story, but there are area's that make no sense and are not thought out by the writers.  Some scenes have no logic to them, with the timeline jumping around with no proper transitions to blend from one point to another.  The acting is equally not what this content deserves.  John Travolta has some kind of made up accent that is not really identifiable to the character, or any other character for that matter.  The guy with the muscle car has a totally illogical purpose and has nothing to offer the story.  Maybe some thought out writing would make him have more of a sensible addition to the movie, other than shooting the gun that leads to the climax of the film.  The neighbor's husband climes a tower (with no wires) and seemingly seems to want to jump, but then magically appears for the altercation with muscle car guy. The sets are just horrible, and the special effects are equally as bad with silly CG fire and a horrid train crash.  I would expect that there was no research and thought put into some of the jobs and procedures to perform this type of work.  The repairs depicted and basically the story plot for them really don't seem realistic at all.  Oh and what electric company is still putting up wooden poles anymore? Which leads to the storm itself.  It was no more than rain, they used no wind, no lighting, and nothing to cause the havoc that was depicted by the story.

Let me get this out of the way she was a very beautiful woman and she loved men (no we did not ) see when you work with some one you see more than your wife they became more like a brother or sisters to you . so let move on . like my title said most people never see what line men see the power of mother nature  is amazing a ice storm can take a 100 years old tree and pull it apart till the only thing there is about the size if a tooth pick ,the Wight of the ice took every pole down or damage them , let's back up here if there is no power in 1993 in Greenville, Mississippi and no power for 300 Miles any way you drove where are all the linemen going to sleep ( not that they will sleep much ) and it was February so campaign was out.let's add no running drinking water and was told not to take a bath In it for the  sewer plant overflow in to the water plant . but thee things happened in bad storms and the lineman  is still on his way to help fix the damage the storm did knowing the may have to sleep in a gymnasiums with about 50 to100 other people from all over . so here one you never see we see a sing tell us last store for rule for the next 150 mile we are all about on e see we got our trucks oldest to the max with supply pulling poles. We go in to get fuel and they do not take the rule man card they call or company they tell the we will overnight them a check for the fuel ( I forgot to tell you the state was under a state of emergency )  so that mean if we needed we could just took it and gave them a IOU became it was below freezing and people's lifes are in danger we explained I say we the state troopers tell the store owner ( store owner calls them on us. Here what we do we have to use our own cc to pay for the fuel just to keep the piece. Our company pays us back when we got back 30 day latter. Here the funny part there are other line crews coming up about 100 mile behind us from a other company they hear us talking on the radio ( Lucky for them they have the same frequency to hear us) there like we need fuel will the owner hold the fuel till we get there we ask if he would no keep in most mind he got paid by all of us. He said no will not hold fuel for anyone. The troop said I don't have a way to stop him .we told him we do we turn off part of his power until the other crew get there and turns it back on to get fuel and left it on when they pulled out  ( we where told later the store owner was fined ) see the peopleer see any of us that ! We worked that storm for 47 day  about 18hr a day no days off . became another ice storm hit the state of Georgia and the Federal government pull 1000 men and sent them there .when we where told we was going to Missippiss we would only be there 7 bays max  total day 47 +7 = 54 days but people never see or think about that but for us its part of the job . I loved my job I made good money the work is a  very dangerous job I lost friend never a partner before I retired my partner worked together for 14 years . in the movie you hear the wife tell him its your ugly wife  my partner and I put are kids though High schools seen them get married have kids I still talk with my partner David 2 times a week if not move my kids call him if they need help fixing a car became he is the best mechanic I ever seen.  The woman that I worked with she went to for AT&A in the outdoor line work it was for more money . I hope that everyone enjoyed the movie the people that do this type of work do become like a big family I think it because we have to trust each other with our lives as for the ending that would never happened but that a movie for you . one more thing I just found another one of my old friend on face book we talked for 2 hr but it was like we had seen each other everyday and its been snout 14 years .

This is one of the most dangerous jobs a person can have and 95% of the time one of the most Thankless!

I don't know if anyone else is like me and because you didn't have a family member working for a utility or electric supplier you got upset when you found yourself without power. No thought to the men and women that are 'getting the lights back on'. Not because you were an ingrate, or had no thought of these individuals. Because when we have to work for a living, some are faced sometimes with dangerous, dirty, unpleasant jobs. I'm not a big John Travolta fan anymore because as he has gotten older, he's become a cross between Gere and Segal with the expression's and affectations when performing. He seems to draw from the other roles he's played of a blue collar guy, a loser, soldier, or successful businessman. Only the title of the film, his lines and character names change.

7718777,4,B01DL2EX6A,"There was a time when Hollywood chose to make movies about people from every walk of life. They weren't specially challenged, didn't toss about political agendas, most were not super spies tracking down the latest bad guy and very few were dressed in tights with super powers. Instead these movies celebrated the normal average Joe and on occasion focused on the tough jobs they performed, celebrating them in the process. John Waynes HELLFIGHTERS comes to mind when I think of movies like this. Those movies are rare these days. Thank goodness that didn't stop LIFE ON THE LINE from being made.

John Travolta stars as Beau, a lineman in Texas wracked with guilt after his brother dies of electrocution completing a job he should have done. On the way to the hospital his brothers wife is also killed when hit be a semi. This leaves their daughter behind with only Beau to raise her, a job he willingly takes with no qualms.

Years go by and Beaus niece Baily (Kate Bosworth) has grown into an upstanding young woman. The two of them have worked hard with the intention of her going off to college. But Bailey has a problem to deal with first. Shes still in love with Duncan (Devon Sawa), part of a family that Beau is not keen on. As a matter of fact hes not thrilled with Duncan either viewing him as a stumbling block for Bailey.

When Duncan shows to take on the job of a new lineman Beau isn't pleased but works around him. At the moment they need all the men they can get. A set of lines is being replaced and needs done before the storm season kicks in. Face it, this is a movie and you know problems will arise with this task.

Sub plots revolve around the new neighbors who just moved in next door, Eugene and Carline (Ryan Robbins and Julie Benz). Eugene is suffering from PTSD after returning from Iraq but not being treated for it. Carline is wishing her husband were the man he was and eventually searches for comfort elsewhere. Another subplot involves Ron, a young man obsessed with Bailey who refuses to take no for an answer, basically stalking her.

As the film moves forward Beau and Duncan have their run in and both learn what the other man is made of. The eventual storm, which we know is coming since the movie continues to count down the days to the storm, trouble does arrive. With power out across the county the men must concentrate on bringing power back online. A suicide attempt and a confrontation in the dark from Ron just adds more to the story as the men who risk their lives to insure we all have power do so once again.

I know some will discount this movie because portions of the plot seem like cut and paste moments from the standard melodrama playbook. The thing is if it works it doesnt matter. All the storylines on display here work well with one another and intercept at various times forwarding the story along. It is never a hindrance to what we are witnessing unfold.

Others will shoot this film down because of the accuracy depicted of the men who work as linesmen. Rare is it that a movie gets a 100% accuracy level when it comes to things like this. The goal of a movie is to tell a story, not show the most minute details of the job being depicted. I read one review that complained that the depiction of the linemen showed them as boozing brawlers after work. I didn't walk away with that. Knowing several linemen in person I can tell you that coming home to a cold beer is not all that unusual.

The film itself is entertaining and well-made on all levels. The cinematography, even during rain sequences is clear and sharp. The sound levels aren't such that we cant hear or understand the actors when they speak, a personal gripe of mine with most movies today. And directing is well done here too showing a talent for composition for the entire film and a coaxing of great performances from the entire cast.

What most will watch this for is to see John Travolta. I will say that I think he does an amazing job here. Dont shoot him down for the accent he chooses, it works. Perhaps the best thing is to see him performing in a role thats closer to his real age 63 than those roles chosen by most actors his age playing characters far too young for them. He does it with such skill and ease that for the most part you never pay attention to it.

On the whole Im sad to see that this movie didn't warrant a major release in theaters. It deserves better than a straight to DVD release. Some movies Ive seen in theaters were not near as good as this one and a large number of critically acclaimed films were not as enjoyable. So my suggestion is that you seek this one out, rent it, buy it and watch it maybe more than once. When you finish youll find yourself not only entertained but with a much larger sense of gratitude for those who choose to make sure power arrives at your doorstep.",1497225600,,4841,4.3988826815642454

I do know that linemen do not work when a situation becomes very dangerous. In the first part of the film, they are working in a thunderstorm. That simply does not happen.
I may be wrong but I know back in 2000 we had linemen from every corner of America restoring downed power lines from an ice storm. It took most of the crews from a week to 3 weeks to get the power back on. If you or I am outside we often get warning to take shelter, the lineman does not climb poles in thunderstorms.",1489363200,,596,4.330357142857143

7718840,5,B01DL2EX6A,"I am in shock at some of the heartless reviews on this movie. I am one of two daughters of the greatest man I've ever known...my Daddy. He was a lineman and also the foreman and supervisor of the electrical department in our area. He was the most sacrificing man a person could imagine. He went to work many days without lunch because the pay was not the best and he made sure we were taken care of first and foremost. He worked in the freezing cold rain, sleet and snow for days on end with absolutely no sleep. These guys go 72 hours and sometimes more with no rest to make sure they do their job and take care of those who are cold and possibly in need of medical equipment which also goes down in home and in nursing care facilities. He would always say he thought about the cold babies and children as well as the elderly people who suffer during power outages. They also went without food and drink to make sure others could have it. The conditions are miserable to say the least and the dangers associated with this line of work are many. Only a certain type of man does this job. They must be wiling to suffer and sacrifice and have honor, integrity, and selflessness beyond measure. So I from the bottom of my heart thank all of the wonderful lineman risking their lives for us and am so glad a movie was finally made about this dangerous job. Love you Daddy and Rest in Peace!",1488585600,10,1386,4.273764258555133

Any knowledge I have of the work these people do has been gained through documentary films, news reports and articles.  Having said that I am only too aware of the type of dangers these people can face on a daily basis and I have the utmost respect for them.  There have some reviewers who even stated that these people do not work during a storm!  Come on now.  I have experienced plenty of storms in my life time and on many occasions power was lost.  But logic tells me that when the power comes back on some time later and the storm is still raging, someone had to be out in that storm fixing things and that someone is a linesman.  OK, so after that lengthy intro, let's talk about the actual movie.  While the title ""Life on the line"" seems to indicate that the story is primarily about the linesmen and their work, there was a background story about the families.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, there was more emphasis placed on the background story than on the actual work of the linesmen.  Don't think for one minute that I am against families.  I know only to well how much influence family life can place on how well (or poorly) a person does their job.

7718874,3,B01DL2EX6A,"Life on the Line is a drama that pays homage to electrical power line workers who work in a dangerous profession and are dedicated to keeping the power flowing and protecting the power grid, no matter the problems that arise. A prologue takes place in Texas in 1998 and shows Beau Ginner (John Travolta), a lineman working in the middle of a lightning storm. Through his negligence his brother is killed and his sister-in-law, rushing to the scene, is also killed in an automobile accident. Ginner suffers enormous guilt and raises his niece Bailey. Kate Bosworth plays both the sister-in-law and the adult Bailey. Years later, experience has made Beau a safety expert. Bailey is involved romantically with bad boy Duncan (Devon Sawa), who has just joined Beaus crew. Because Beau doesnt approve of Duncans lifestyle, theres tension between the two men that spills over to the job.

The films opening features a lineman being interviewed. His somber manner suggests that the story that is about to unfold has tragic elements. During the main narrative, director David Hackl places date and time stamps over the action to show that a serious storm is getting closer and closer. But while we wait for the storm to vent its fury, theres a lot of routine melodrama bordering on soap opera. The plot mirrors that of Armageddon, a picture that had the benefit of elaborate special effects to make up for a substantial plot. In Life on the Line, theres a sense of deja vu, and its hard to become invested in such stereotypical characters. When the storm finally hits, the effects don't dazzle the way they should.

Travolta  the star of such successful films as Saturday Night Fever, Pulp Fiction and Hairspray  has been doing low-profile movies lately. His last two features  I Am Wrath and In a Valley of Violence  had limited theatrical release and wound up on home video pretty quickly. His outstanding performance as lawyer Robert Shapiro in the TV mini-series The People v. O.J. Simpson indicates that, given solid material, Travolta still can command a role. Here, however, the material is mediocre, the role of Beau nothing special, and he simply goes through the paces. No previous film has focused on linemen as subjects, but if it was intended to honor their work, it should have been given more than a formulaic treatment.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include Life on the Line music video by Fiona Culley featuring Darius Rucker; Behind the Scenes with Cast & Crew featurette; interviews; and trailer gallery. A digital HD copy is included.",1486425600,,2553,4.895833333333333

I respect myself less for having watched half of it.  (Seriously, that is a true statement.)  My review has nothing to do with the Lineman that this story attempts to portray.  This movie just has  an absolutely pathetic script and awful directing, start to finish.  The acting was terrible, too, but given the script and directing I can't really hold them accountable for it.

How many clichs, flashback sequences and half-baked, one-dimensional characters does it take to screw in a light bulb?  Far, far too many, apparently.  I think the dialogue and character development were intended to be edgy and interesting, but instead it was all so obvious and unimaginative.  If I were a lineman, I think I would have liked this movie even less because of how little effort apparently went into creating realistic mult-dimensional characters or a narrative that didn't heavily rely on a contrived, belligerent and unbelievable antagonist that served no purpose at all, other than as a feeble attempt to get the audience to care about its otherwise weak, cardboard characters.

Now, years later she is grown up and beginning to start her own life. Beau thinks this is the worst thing ever, until the night of the storm that changes everything. This is a movie that tries as hard as it can to be important. It hits you with an emotional punch right in the beginning and does its best to help you relate to the men in this field. There are some very good aspects in this movie but it ended up become a cheesy version of Armageddon. Some movies try way to hard to prove a point and make a statement. This is one of those. The movie is good and worth seeing but a little too over the top and unbelievable to be taken all that serious. That said, this is am exciting movie that is very entertaining. Overall, an Armageddon like movie that is entertaining but a little too cheesy and over the top to have the effect it really wanted. I give this a B.",1484006400,,1037,4.242424242424242

I have live in and traveled all over Texas and never heard anyone talk like this.  Travolta sounds like he learned his Texas accent from a New York Yankee.",1480204800,3,409,4.413333333333333
7719031,5,B01DL2EX6A,"GREAT MOVIE! It keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what's gonna happen next, exciting & entertaining. So glad that one of my favorite actors--John Travolta came out with a new movie, AWESOME! Please don't stop making movies John, you're one of tne best out there, love ya!!!",1480118400,3,284,4.7
7719032,5,B01DL2EX6A,Excellent movie depicting a lineman's life at work.  My husband enjoyed all the one liners that he says at work as the substation foreman.,1480032000,,138,4.75
7719033,5,B01DL2EX6A,"I hardly ever right reviews for any movie on Amazon, so this is kinda new for me.  All I can say is watch it.  The acting is great and the actors are top notch.  It seems John Travolta has been in a slump lately, but he brings it back with this movie.

Now, before I say this next part, you must know that I am a manly-man.  Beard, flannel, chop trees, etc.  But at the end of this movie I was bawling like baby.  I am so glad I watched this though.",1480032000,2,449,3.8152173913043477
7719034,5,B01DL2EX6A,I really enjoyed this movie. I have total respect for the men and women who sacrifice their lives everyday as lineman. It is a truly dangerous job. It says it was based on actual events. My heart goes out to all of the families that have lost loved ones or have been injured while performing these dangerous jobs. John Travolta and Kate Bosworth and all the actors and actresses did a wonderful job portraying these characters. I will buy this when the dvd is released.  5 stars for this terrific movie.,1479772800,15,503,4.527472527472527

7719036,2,B01DL2EX6A,OK @ best. I had to force myself to watch it because I paid for it and it was OK and nothing more. Not sure how this has more than 2 stars is insane because this movie is borderline boring. Would I buy it again if I knew it was going to be this bad?

7719038,4,B01DL2EX6A,"I liked the movie, it was pretty realistic to a point. there were some instances in the movie that a real lineman would not have done. But the movie did show what being a lineman is about and more people need to watch this movie to see what it takes to keep the lights on, its not just flipping a switch!",1479513600,,304,4.0
8756238,5,B01DL2EX6A,"It's a good movie, but I bet not one female has ever died doing this kind of work. So why say women are risking their lives? I'm sick and tired of this mindless, political correctness. All they ever contribute to occupations like this are sexual harassment lawsuits brought against innocent men for profit.",1537920000,,306,4.7924528301886795

8756241,3,B01DL2EX6A,"Three PERILOUS Stars. Life on the Line is a well-made disaster drama with a TV movie of the week ambiance that 'over reaches' the subject. It revolves around the tough lives of a number of Texas utility lineman who maintain, restore and upgrade their part of the national electrical power grid. Its also about their families, like the events surrounding the Ginner family. The movie is based on an actual disastrous event as linemen go into the teeth of a monster 1999 weather event known as The Storm. Full of cliched events, the script lets down a very capable cast of John Travolta, Kate Bosworth, Devon Sawa, Julie Benz, Gil Bellows, Ryan Robbins, Ty Olsson, Stuart Stone, Reese Alexander, and Sharon Stone. Directed by David Hackl, Definitely Recommended for a look. Three INTENSE Stars.

8756247,2,B01DL2EX6A,"I'm giving this two stars because I love the cast, but I really think it was a waste of talent on a bad script. You get the idea that they were trying to get across, but it was very stale. The movie focused more on the family and only touched on what it is to be a lineman, which I found very unfortunate because this is a world I don't know and I was genuinely interested.",1528848000,,373,3.9210526315789473
