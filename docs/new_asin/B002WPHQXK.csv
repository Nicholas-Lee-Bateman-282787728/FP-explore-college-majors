8383358,3,B002WPHQXK,"I usually love Canadians movies such as  ""the Decline of the American Empire"", ""the Barbarian Invasions"" and ""Bon Cop Bad Cop"".

I am not so sure about ""De Pre en Flic"".",1350432000,,169,4.419354838709677
8383359,5,B002WPHQXK,"I first saw this film at the Cleveland International Film Festival a few years ago and thought it was a great comedic film.  Since then, I've purchased the dvd and am so glad it is now part of my collection.",1342224000,,207,4.175
8383360,5,B002WPHQXK,"It was Dizzy Dean who said, ""It ain't braggin' if you can do it."" This is the quandary for our hero in ""Fathers and Guns."" His father is a braggart, an egotistical show-off and a self-centered bully. Problem is, he is also a testosterone-laden top cop, an effective undercover agent and a crack shot. Our hero is a pretty good cop in his own right, but ""pretty good"" isn't good enough for his father, who never misses an opportunity to berate, bully and humiliate him.

When a brutal biker gang kidnaps a fellow Montreal police officer, they go undercover and discover that the gang's defense lawyer and his unhappy son have gone on a woodland bonding retreat in an attempt to fix their dysfunctional relationship. Our warring pair pretends to want to repair their relationship, too, so they're off to the wilderness to try to convince the lawyer to turn state's evidence.

This French-Canadian (English captions) entry to the 2010 Seattle International Film Festival was a crowd pleaser, because the dialogue and the situations were hilarious. Insult humor has never been my favorite, but I found the father's sarcastic comments, laced with contemptuous barbs to be laugh-out-loud funny. Okay, okay. I should know better, but I did laugh!

Some of the bonding stuff gets a little maudlin, but the main characters are played by actor-comedians, so the lines are delivered flawlessly and we enjoyed an unlikely combination of action, suspense, and farce. I'm getting my DVD from Amazon.com.",1335139200,,1489,4.995967741935484
8383361,5,B002WPHQXK,"Beaucoup de viande, ce film la. This is the funniest movie I've ever seen. You have to see it in the original Quebec French. Sooooooooo funny!!",1314057600,,143,4.538461538461538
8383362,5,B002WPHQXK,"De Pere En Flic Is unlike any other film I have seen. It is not the typical crime or police tale. It is very funny often but not formulaic. Even the members of the criminal organization are fresh and different. Some of the best scenes deal with a company which tries to bring adult children and their fathers closer to each other. Many of the films which come out of Quebec are original as well being very entertaining. Out of many others, like impressive movies such as Jesus of Montreal and Black Robe, I would strongly recommend C.R.A.Z.Y. I love the scene where one of the five sons soars above a church service to the music of the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"" while the congregation accompanies with the beat of the song.
Michel Cote appears in both C.R.A.Z.Y. and De Pere En Flic. He is one of the  best Canadian actors.",1308700800,,838,4.477124183006536
8383363,5,B002WPHQXK,"I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival earlier this year and I just loved it. I saw 14 films at the festival and this was my favorite comedy hands down. Those Canadians talk French far more quickly than my 30 year old high school French can follow, but if you can keep up with the subtitles then you should be o.k.

The scene with the dolls made group therapy look like it could actually be a lot of fun. One of these days I'm going to try that with a few of my family members. Seriously, this has all the humor of the Lethal Weapon films but w/o all the violence. If you're not afraid of subtitles, then I'd recommend this film whole-heartedly.",1282176000,,665,4.277777777777778
8383364,5,B002WPHQXK,I just saw this incredible film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and was blown away with the witty dialog and fast paced action.....terribly funny!,1263340800,,162,5.269230769230769
