8599948,5,B00E19EGCE,Great concert considering this is in 2010 and Cesaria Evora passed in December of 2011.  There are a lot of great songs on this DVD. How she was still able to sing and perform the way she did is really a testament to a woman with an incredible strong will and talent.,1404000000,3,267,4.134615384615385
