7806663,5,6300223051,"This may be old, straight from the 80's fitness craze; but this is still the best workout video I have ever done. Granted yes it is difficult at first (I could not make it through the workouts for quite awhile) but eventually becomes easier with practice and the results are amazing, you really cook the fat and get nice muscle tone. The leg workout is my favorite. My father did this workout for years; now my sister and I continue the tradition. Excellent and highly recommended for both men and women.",1211241600,3,504,4.549450549450549
7806664,2,6300223051,"This video is way, way outdated!!!
The moves are too fast &  ""jerky"", even for someone of intermediate fitness  level!
Ergonomically incorrect, confusing, would discourage most  beginners.
I love Joanie, but threw this video out!!",968284800,2,230,5.514285714285714
