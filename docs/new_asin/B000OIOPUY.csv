8185153,5,B000OIOPUY,"I now have several of these ""Watt"" fly fishing DVD's - they're ""cookie cutter,"" and their laughing becomes pretty wearing - makes you wonder if they're there for a lark or they know what they're doing or saying.  However, I buy them mostly to get a look at the particular river they're fishing for my own future access, and they're all pretty good for that, so I watch them over and over again to become well-versed on the stream (I've wade fished the upper stretches of the Teton - good river).  There's always quite a bit of ""catching"" action in their DVD's, which is good, although they all are in the context of having a guide, and virtually all drift boat fishing, neither of which appeal to me, but that's OK.",1296604800,,715,4.450381679389313
