1345142,5,B00004RM2X,"I don't know about this particular product, but I do know that this is one classic movie. It's achievements should be recognized. The awards it won for its music and acting (RIP Mr. James Baskett), animation, etc. It seems more disrespectful to the African Americans involved in the movie NOT to release it. None were portrayed in any negative way, especially uncle Remus who is practically the moral center of the ENTIRE FILM. Yes, they seem uneducated and poor (in the traditional European/American sense) but that doesn't mean they were less of human beings. As I said, the MAIN CHARACTER is an old black man who is perhaps the wisest, most compassionate, friendly and virtuous character in the movie! Actually, I wonder if it was more offensive to those racist white people in the 1940s when it was originally released. Walt had the guts to make a movie like this and releasing it, (premiering it!), in the still widely racist south. I can't imagine the significance of the on screen relationship between uncle Remus and Johnny at the time. The imagery of an old black man holding hands with a white boy in a time of need and sadness. It must've really been something.

Honestly, this movie demonstrates the power of friendship and compassion and how it breaks boundaries of age and race. The message is clear. Now release it properly in honor of James Baskett!",1473638400,2,1365,4.783898305084746

The criticism that I've heard is that this movie perpetrates the view that slaves were happy. But this movie takes place after the civil war. If you didn't otherwise know it, you should figure it out when Uncle Ramos decides to move to Atlanta. A slave couldn't just decide to leave.

BUT, if Disney wanted to release an official version on Blu-Ray (PLEASE!!), then how about just adding the words, ""Georgia, 1885"" to the screen at the opening scene? Of course, with today's crappy education system, they might have to say, ""Georgia, 1885 - 20 years after slavery ended!""",1466208000,3,743,4.621212121212121

1345156,4,B00004RM2X,"It is the stuff of legends.  There are whispers.  There are rumors.  Its the movie that Disney is ashamed of (except when they use it).  What am I talking about?  Song of the South.  The movie was last in the theaters in 1986, and the only video release was long before mass consumption of VHS tapes began.  I was lucky enough to finally get to watch the film this year.  While I can see cause for concern, I certainly don't see why it is self-censored.

The movie tells the story of Johnny (Bobby Driscoll), a young boy in the south during the 1800s (more on that later).  For reasons that are never explained, his father is sending he and his mother (Ruth Warrick) to live with his grandmother (Lucile Watson) on her plantation somewhere outside of Atlanta.  All we really get a feel for is that his newspaper articles are controversial.

Johnny doesnt like being left without his father, so he sets out to head for home.  Before he gets too far, he meets up with Uncle Remus (James Baskett).  This kindly old man tells him a series of stories about the misadventures of Br'er Rabbit and his encounters with Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear that teach Johnny lessons and convince him to stay on the plantation.  How will others react to these stories?  And will Johnnys father ever return?

The Movie as a Movie

Before we get to the controversy, lets discuss the movie as a movie.  I knew the basic premise and that it involved humans and animation.  What I didn't realize is just how much of the film is actually live action.  I would say the majority of it is live action.  This was the first film Disney ever made that wasn't mostly animated, so right there it has some historical value.

The animated sequences are wonderful and easily the highlight of the film.  They are simple tales with morals to learn, although the lesson of the second one is questionable.  Each sequence has its own song, and they are all catchy.  At times, the humans interact with the cartoon characters ala Mary Poppins, and the result looks great.

The live action parts can be overly acted and overly dramatic.  This is especially true when it focuses on the kids.  Bobby Driscoll would go on to act in Disneys take on Treasure Island and voice the lead in Peter Pan, which I love.  Here, hes over the top if he has to do anything requiring emotion.  Likewise, a neighbor girl he meets (Luana Patten) isn't the best actress.  Everyone is passable, but the acting in the biggest weakness of the film.

Frankly, the animated portions are the best parts of the film.  These short stories present a simple conflict that is quickly resolved.  The live actions parts can be slow at times with conflict that is barely there.  Still, it is entertaining enough to keep you watching and it does create characters you care about, so you do care about the ending.

Purely based on entertainment, I give the film 4 stars.  (And youll notice that is how I rated it.)

The Controversy

So lets get down to the good stuff.  Why is this movie so controversial?  Keep in mind that this is nothing new.  It was boycotted when it was released in 1946, and in 1970, Disney announced they would never release it again, something they reversed just two years later.  But as I said earlier, it has not been available or shown in the states since the mid 1980s.

I can certainly see some cause for concern.  If you are trying to get any historical lessons from it, youll be sadly misguided.  The biggest question is when does the movie take place.  The original stories that the movie is based on are apparently set after the Civil War.  If thats the case, why is the plantation where the film takes place so well put together instead of ravaged.  The fact that Uncle Remus almost leaves and seems to come and go at will would back this theory on the time the story is set.  But the movie never says, so we can only assume.  If it is set before the Civil War, the fact that he almost leaves is very problematic since surely he would have been a slave.  I chose to view the film as taking place post-Civil War and will be discussing it at such.

As I said, this is one I will definitely grant detractors.  Like it or not, we do get ideas on history based on films.  And since this is my complaint about Disneys Pocahontas, I have to acknowledge the issue here, too.

But some of the other complaints I have seen have just been bizarre bordering on ignorant.  Yes, I went there.  The biggest one I have seen is the complaint that the former slaves are shown singing while they work or when relaxing together at night.  Um, hello?  Where did all those Spirituals come from?  Thats right  slaves singing to lift their spirits while working.

Or theres the complaint about the scene where Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear set a trap for Br'er Rabbit using a tar figure, a figured covered in tar that they hope he will stick to so they can catch him.  The complaint?  The tar is black.  Black equals racists.  Um, hello?  Tar is black and a sticky substance you can get stuck in.  They chose that color to be realistic and that substance for it's plot potential, not to be remotely racist at all.  Plus, they were copying a story from the originals, published in 1881.  Honestly, this the fact that this term has a dual meaning should not be used to penalize a movie or a person who is using the better known, more traditional meaning of the phrase.  Context is everything, and you need to learn that.

Then there is how Uncle Remus interacts with Johnnys mom and grandma.  He treats them with deference and respect.  You might almost say like an employee to employer or a former slave to former owner/current employer.  Yet people complain about it.  Frankly, I find it completely believable.  It is frustrating because Uncle Remus gets in trouble (only in words, no actual punishments) for what he does, yet he is looking out for Johnny and doing what he thinks is best in each situation.  Honestly, I want to get him to defend himself because he is right (something everyone agrees on by the end).  But where would the conflict in the story be if that happened.  Again, I think this is a realistic portrayal given the time that the movie was made and is set.

Which brings me to why I think the movie is actually anti-racist.  Johnny makes two friends his own age in the course of the film  Ginny, the white little girl down the road, and Toby (Glenn Leedy), the son of one of the former slaves living on the plantation.  Its the kind of friendship that only kids can make, I just met you and we are best friends now.  This color blind acceptance is a very powerful example, especially for the time period when the movie was made.  And none of the adults say anything about it either.

The only true villains of the piece are Ginnys older brothers.  Yes, the neighborhood bullies are white.

Then there is the relationship with Uncle Remus.  Johnnys grandmother and father both show him respect.  And, in my mind, Uncle Remus is the only one who shows he truly cares for Johnny.  Johnnys mom is too wrapped up in her own cares to listen to what Johnny tries to tell her multiple times.  Uncle Remus cares and parents.  Hes the best adult role model in the film.

Furthermore, all the former slaves on the plantation are treated with respect like humans.

Okay, all the pluses are certainly not time realistic.  There may have been an isolated plantation or two like this, but Im sure they were the exception.

So this movie fails as history.  Then again, what movie is good history?  Those who try to learn their history from movies are going to be grossly misinformed.  But lets look at the positives here.  The African-American characters are treated with respect and shown to be human.  And the white characters are color blind, treating them with some measure of respect.  That had to be a radical notion in 1946, and yet it is ignored when discussing this film.

So how do I think it should be handled?  See, thats the beauty of DVD and Blu-Ray.  This film could be released like several of the Disney companys shorts have been handled.  A brief disclaimer could air when you hit play that reminds you this is a romanticized view of history and to treat it only as entertainment.  It also reflects the views of the time when it was made and not those the company holds today.  From there, they could create an extra feature talking more about what life was really like in that time and how the Uncle Remus stories were first preserved from the oral history of the former slaves right after the Civil War.

How Disney Treats This Movie

For a movie that hasn't been released 20+ years, they sure keep it around in our consciousness.  The highly popular ride Splash Mountain takes its inspiration for the inside scenes from the animated portions of the movie.  All three of the songs are included as well.  The tar scene has been switched to honey, which I have no problem with.  But why build a ride about a movie you are embarrassed to show any more?

Then theres the music.  Youll notice I haven't mentioned the songs by name yet.  There is one youll immediately recognize  Zip-a-dee-doh-dah.  Yep, that classic comes from this movie.  I have it on several Disney CDs.  I even have a copy of the song Everybodys Got a Laughing Place from this movie as well.  Again, if you are so embarrassed, why include more than the most famous song anywhere.

Ive even noticed walk around characters of Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear in Critter Country in Disneyland in the last couple of years.  Yes, thats right by Splash Mountain, but is anyone going to know who they are outside the ride in another 10 years?

Frankly, I find the way Disney treats this movie shameful.  No, it does not reflect current attitudes.  Its nice to see how far we have come.  So why cant we still view it and use it to discuss attitudes, how they change, and what else should change.

So if you get a chance to see the film, I highly recommend you do so.  Song of the South is not a highly entertaining classic, but it is fun.  More importantly, you can form your own opinions about this highly controversial film.",1433635200,15,10124,4.4769736842105265

I am also bothered by the fact that Disney has not seen fit to release this in the US on DVD or Bluray.  I understand that some ignorant, uneducated few call this film racist.  However, they fail to recognize, that this is a retelling of a  HISTORICAL piece of literature and this film is true to that literature.  Back when the Onkel Remus stories were written, that is how those people talked, that is how things were.

But I talk about serious issues that need to be discussed in order to get this great film released on blu-ray some day, and my comments are voted down as not helpful.  I think my comments are extremely helpful.  If you want Disney to EVER release this movie on DVD, these things MUST BE DISCUSSED.  So, gee thanks for your not helpful vote.  I hope it made your day...

Song of The South is Not a racist film.  It's a beautiful movie that was set AFTER the Civil War, AFTER the Emancipation Proclamation, so all those people working on that plantation Were Free, and Walt Disney himself just did not think to say so at the beginning of the movie.  You can tell everyone in the movie is free, because no one tries to stop Uncle Remus from leaving the property. No one acts worried about about it, just sad.  AND, unlike many movies of the period and before, ALL the black people in that movie are portrayed as ""normal"" respectable, intelligent, honest human beings.  And when people say that the portrayal of a happy Uncle Remus is racist, because black people in that situation could not have been happy...  How does anyone know that they would not have been happy?  After all, they had just become free for the first time in American History, and lived in a place that was owned by kind people who treated them with a great deal of dignity and respect.

I have known black people who said the ban on Song of The South was ridiculous. I hope that some day Disney will release it.  But if they do, I think it would help a great deal to include a documentary explaining the above, among other things.",1380672000,10,1819,4.404191616766467

Walt Disney made a wonderful film and was brave enough to put it out but was the company who bears his name is just plain chicken to put it out again - fearing criticism from certain parts of a country even now where after half a century they can still but put up racial blocks to voting and where a child can be murdered for wearing a hoodie and carrying a coke and skittles.

So, to fill the vacuum, a Chinese black market company known as Bo-Ying (whose logo is clearly visible on the DVD jacket), with their fast-and-loose interpretation of international copyright law, has released their own pirated edition of the movie. Where did they get their source material? From Disney's Japanese LaserDisc release of 1990? This rare edition has both the original soundtrack and a dubbed Japanese voice track, but rather than rerecord the songs in Japanese, Disney burned in Japanese subtitles that can't be removed. So, listening to the English soundtrack, you're suddenly reminded of the Japanese origin when you see strange-looking subtitles during the songs. Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah in Japanese? I can't comment on the adequacy of the translation. The infamous Bo-Ying company is noted for their circumvention of copyright restrictions and also for the variable quality of their products. I've screened their clones of Criterion DVD's that are indistinguishable from the quality of the real thing. Others bear the marks of whatever derivative source material they can get their slimy hands on. They'll do anything to make a buck and mostly get away with it.

1345214,2,B00004RM2X,"This review is specifically for the Chinese import DVD version of ""Song of the South"" produced by the company Bo Ying. It has English and Chinese text on the front and back cover.

I was excited to see an official (looking) release of this classic film on DVD. Unfortunately, this is not the one you're looking for.

It is a factory pressed DVD (not a burned copy), but the quality is substandard. By seeing the picture quality and occasional video dropouts, it was clear to me that this was made from a PAL VHS tape version of the film converted to NTSC. To make matters worse, there is a blue animated logo that appears EVERY 4 minutes and 45 seconds. It starts at the top right and moves across the screen to the left and stays on the screen for 20 seconds at a time. Really? Who wants to see that every 5 minutes? Certainly not me. (Click on ""View and share related images"" for a screenshot of this.)

However, if you're so inclined, there are a few good things about the disc. There are optional dubbed languages in Chinese and Mandarin as well as subtitles for those languages. There are surprisingly good English subtitles, too. They duplicate the natural ""dialect"" of all of the characters. Other than these things, the DVD is bare boned. Just the movie and no special features.

I doubt that this is authorized by Disney as there is no mention of the Disney company anywhere on the cover, the disc, or in the DVD content itself. In fact, the very beginning of the opening credits are cut to avoid ""Distributed by Buena Vista"" and even ""Walt Disney Presents"".

Bottom line, if you love the movie, you're better off getting an un-authorized copy of it from a place like MayanCastleDVD dot net or just doing research and downloading it from the internet.

of all his cartoon films.  As the Civil Rights movement grew, there
came ignorant pressure criticizing it because it portrayed slavery
graphically as a part of our country's past.  Disney was hurt!  And
why shouldn't he have been?  For it has a brilliantly crafted scene
where Brer Fox prepares to cook the rabbit! You laugh your head off
seeing it!  It's probably the best movie cartoon scene ever created!
ANYBODY watching that scene would totally understand that this whole
movie was NOT supportive of racism!  Just the opposite!  Brer Rabbit
was really the hero of this movie!  He was, in a way, Uncle Remus'
saying to the little boy that courage and intelligence could someday
overcome the fear and ignorance that kept slavery in place.  As I recall
the story, after the fox had thrown the protesting rabbit into a briar
patch to die,the rabbit hollered back ""'Born and raised in a briar patch,
Brer Fox,'born and raised in a briar patch!!!""  Thanks to the Civil
Rights movement years after that film, the Blacks in our society began
escaping from their briar patch.  And for sure, they'd been born and

However, it is still watch-able and indeed highly recommended for the songs etc. and most probably was 'state of the art' at the time.

1345254,5,B00004RM2X,"Although plenty of people have already written their displeasure at not having ""Song of the South"" out on DVD, I would like to express myself as well. First off, the story takes place during Reconstruction which means AFTER the Civil War so Uncle Remus is an ex-slave. Yes, many blacks have chosen to stay on the plantation where they were formerly slaves for pay. Although the Civil War gave blacks freedom from slavery this does not mean that there still wasn't discrimination against the blacks. Yes, that is basic history as well. However, as survivors of slavery many people took pleasure in simple things like going fishing without needing permission or moving to other states without having hound dogs pursue them. Not everyone had a chip on his shoulder and people like Uncle Remus actually existed meaning joyful, wise, and caring. As Americans, our past history isn't always fun but there are dark stains as well like slavery which we should never forget because it is tragic. Teaching the truth to children is very important without any liberal spin to the truth.

  Furthermore, we have another dark stain such as political correctness which in today's times means censorship. One of the leading culprits is Disney which is an insult to Walt's memory because he always made films that are family friendly and oftentimes taught moral lessons. Walt always loved children and would never produce an insulting cartoon or movie for them. For those who don't care to have ""Song of the South"" on DVD do not seem to realize the danger of censorship including self-censorship. SOTO is laughably considered controversial yet if you care about family friendly films or cartoons just look at what modern Disney is producing: potty mouthed characters, children disrespectful towards their elders, fart jokes, etc. This is what today's kids should emulate? SERIOUSLY?

  Besides, SOTO portrays a positive spin based on African folktales where a black man teaches some white children lessons through storytelling. Storytelling is a tradition among the black folks and James Baskett does a wonderful performance of Uncle Remus. In 1946 this is more of an exception than the rule. What baffles me is that there is never any protest from the black community (as far as I know) when blacks are portrayed as drug pushers/addicts, prostitutes, welfare recipients with 10 children, jailbirds, cursing all the time especially with n****** this and n****** that, etc. Is that what one is in real life ALL the time? Are we, the viewing public, supposed to believe that there is nothing else to a black person? Is there nothing POSITIVE that a black person contributes in life? Of course there is plenty BUT where are all the good films portraying the POSITIVE side of black folk?

  Well, the only way to view positive movies is to watch cable and such films as ""Something the Lord Made"", ""Gifted Hands"", ""A Lesson Before Dying"", etc. Oh, yes, ""Akeelah and the Bee"" was released a few years ago in the movies and a war film that is out just now about the black air force men (forgot the name) but by far fewer than should be. My point is: ""Song of the South"" belongs in the same category as these other wonderful films. PLEASE CONTACT DISNEY AND BOMBARD THEM WITH EMAILS! Censorship is dangerous. We, the buying public, are intelligent enough to be our own censors and to know whether a children's movie musical is a good or bad buy. Disney needs to quit with their over-the-top liberal crap and give the consumers what we need. Instead of being spineless wimps who cave to dumb interest groups who have nothing better to do than to pick on innocent films Disney needs to rediscover who they are and correct the errors in what they have become---SPINELESS IDIOTS!

1345255,4,B00004RM2X,"Depending on how you look at it Song of the South is one of the film world's most revered or reviled films. Beyond any doubt it is Disney's most controversial. Not released in any form in the American market and officially retired by Disney in 1986, I finally had a chance to see the film recently. The story of Uncle Remus and his folk tales is well worth seeing despite its racist overtones.

The story follows the adventures of a young boy in post Civil War Atlanta who has come to live at his grandmother's plantation when his father leaves the family to work in Atlanta. Adrift and friendless the child meets and befriends a former slave named Uncle Remus. Through Remus' folk tale of Brer Rabbit and his friends he teaches the child valuable life lessons.

Is the film worth seeking out? The answer is absolutely. The film presents some of Disney's best animation. This animation is uniquely blended with live action to create a seamless whole. The film's live action pales when compared to the animated sequences. In fact when the film was retired many of the animated sequences were merged into other programming.
The music from the film is also essential Disney. The film won the Academy Award for best original song and was nominated for its score.

The film is not so much racist but the product of its times. It probably wasn't the best choice for Disney but it remains what it is: a faithful retelling of the Joel Chandler Harris stories. The important question is when or if Disney should re-release the film. The answer will depend in the long run on both perceived political correctness as well as economics. This is too valuable a property for the company to let fall into the public domain. If Disney wants to preserve the film it must take the lead. Many inferior versions are available anyway and a pristine print would be appreciated.

The disc I viewed was the UK PAL version. The Technicolor picture was slightly washed out but the soundtrack was vibrant and strong. The only real extras were copies of the 1972 and 1986 release trailers. Also included was the 1946 Johnny Mercer radio spot promoting his recordings of some of the film's songs which is interesting from a historical point of view. The version I saw included two easy to find Easter eggs of two controversial cartoons from the period. The first Coal Black and the Sebben Dwarfs is one of Warner Brothers censored eleven which also needs to be preserved as part of animation history. The second: The Martins and the Coys is a retelling of the Hatfield and McCoy feud that Disney deemed to violent for its chosen audience. The bottom line is seek out this rare film if you choose to see one of the most controversial films in American Film history. Many versions are out there so choose wisely.",1338854400,3,2781,4.6578411405295315

Uncle Remus, living a poor, humble life (like Jesus), is the enormous hero in this story.  Many of us would like to have a benevolent father like Uncle Remus, who is wise, attentive, understanding, patient, kind, and loving.

1345276,5,B00004RM2X,"I watched a banned movie tonight. I watched it before when I was living in Ireland over 45 years ago with my sisters and friends. I have valued the lessons this movie imparted to me, through the wise words and gentle portrayal of Uncle Remus, by James Baskette. I have had my child watch it and wish it was around for all the children of my friends and family, but unfortunately the people who are supposed to know what is best for us have messed up again.
What do they think will happen if the children of the generations to come, see this miraculous movie? Would they be insulted that their race are belittled by another race? I hardly think so. The smartest people in the film are black. They are what saved the children of the whites in the movie, in this troubled time. Watching it in Ireland may have been the trick, because we realized people of all races could be smart. Could resolve the issues, we had no answer to.
 What possesses companies, governments, associations, societies etc. to think they know better than the people? I used to talk to school children about Irish culture, traditions and our Irish heritage, here in America. I was told, I could no longer speak about the Celts hurling themselves naked at the Romans, no longer talk about spirits and demons being able in folklore, to re-enter our World at Hallow'een, to talk about Irishmen and women owning plantations and so African Americans might have acquired their names,Kelly, Murphy etc through this terrible time in the history of the World. Why hide what happened? It did happen. We are not, or at  least I am not, proud of that little gem of information I gleaned from my readings here. I try to atone for the sins of my countrymen and not to forget it.
I believe we cannot hide the crimes and bestial actions of the past. History is known to repeat itself. We should never hide the suffering of our peoples in this World, ""Lest we forget"". Isn't that the saying? It rings true in my head. And I would do anything in my power to prevent it happening should it rear it's ugly head again.
Disney, hiding this glorious and precious lesson in life from our children, you are indeed committing a crime. I know it would be better for a child to watch this movie and learn the gentle ways of life than watching a film portraying human beings being blown up or shot to pieces. What reality do you want for your child?",1318723200,5,2390,4.479357798165138

It is a shame that it hasn't been re-released by Disney because of a mistaken perception that it supports slavery. The movie isn't about slavery, it is about children and stories.",1317254400,22,355,4.741935483870968
1345281,5,B00004RM2X,"I, like almost everyone who saw this film as a child, loved it.  Its memory has been a source of great warmth and happiness to me.  That its benefits have been withheld from so many children out of fear of thought police who have ""Good Intentions"" is very bad.

I am a particularly color blind person.  I suspend disbelief when I try to enjoy fiction and Song of the South is very much a fiction.  I don't take the good or bad too seriously.  I saw this film more than once as a child.  I found the parts that most people object to were about people in subordinate positions getting along as well as they could under difficult circumstances.  This was a fiction for entertainment.  This fiction was not a moralizing object lesson against slavery.  It brings out some positive points in a creative way despite a negative social/class environment.

It wasn't until much later in life, after hearing many times ""Tar Baby"" used in a vulgar fashion by rather foul people of more than one race, that I understood that a trap/doll made of of tar to fool and trap a dumb bunny might be seen as a black (in Latin) person.  Most people I know who saw the film didn't take away from the film that the tar baby was meant to be a black person.  This is a cartoon segment in which a rabbit, fox and bear wear clothes, talk and do other fanciful things.  Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar and sometimes a tar baby is just a tar baby and not a depiction of a person of a particular race.

Sometimes people have friendship or compassion even for or with an overlord if things are going relatively well between the individuals.  This may rub those still fighting angrily against slavery or injustice the wrong way but it is part of human nature.  In a fiction dramatizing this trait is a pardonable plot device.

That some would ban this fiction because it isn't a more realistic promotion of racial equality and depiction of the horrors of slavery so as to provide a positive influence on children is slanted and does not give the film credit for its positive nature.  I find the vulgar cruel circumstances in some films an edifying contrast to a films better parts, but found the kindness and compassion shown in this film so overwhelming as to preclude any of the negative conditioning people seem to be afraid of.

Frankly given their less than ideal position, as a child I regarded the black people in the movie as being of as high or higher stature and personal integrity than of those they dealt with.  ""Do unto others ..."" were not just words to them.

As I recall the most negative characterizations were of white children acting as bullies (terrorists) against other white children.

The positives that the whole film put in context beyond that available in the partial releases are important to the story.  I hope the film is available soon.",1316044800,2,2834,4.522593320235757

I loved this movie as a child and I marched for civil rights in the sixties. I'd love to get SOS on dvd for my grandchildren. I can't imagine that any modern young person would be influenced by this movie to think that slavery was a good thing.",1315440000,5,552,4.585858585858586

I have been wanting a copy for myself for some time now, and upon reading the first review, I am in total agreement that this movie should be put on DVD.  When I first saw it, the movie was shown by my brothers' Boy Scout troop at the high school.  It was part of their troop's annual 'Fun Day.""  It was the only time I saw tis movie, and I am a grown woman now, and I STILL want to see it again.  It it a classic movie, as are about all Disney movies, and this political correctness thing needs to stop (Ahem, DISNEY!!).  This was a fun movie with a great soundtrack, a soundtrack that I miss hearing. The movie was a movie of the times back in the 1940's.

1345284,5,B00004RM2X,"I last saw 'Song of the South' in theatres in 1986, on its' 40th anniversary. I loved it. I remember the theatre being packed. I have seen it since on Laser Disc. Unfortunately, because of reasons only Robert Iger knows (he's CEO of Disney), 'Song of the South' has not yet been released on DVD. 'Song of the South' is a wonderful tale about a former slave, Uncle Remus, who tells stories about B'rer Rabbit and B'rer Fox and B'rer Bear to neighborhood children. He tells these stories to white children and black children. The stories all have sensible themes in them - some are about running away from home, or trying to find a kind of laughing place for us to go to when we are feeling sad. Uncle Remus' stories fill us with warmth. Children of all ages (adults too) would love this 1946 film. But the reason Disney hasn't released this wonderful film is because the studio is afraid of political correctness backlash. Dreamworks released 'Prince of Egypt', about slavery in Egypt. 'Gone With the Wind' takes place on a plantation. 'Birth of the Nation' makes heroes out of the Ku Klux Klan. These and so many more movies are still being released to the public. I'm in favor of these releases, even the very racist 'Birth of a Nation.' It shows that America is still free, and Americans have a right to judge films for themselves. Disney should release 'Song of the South' if only to allow Americans to judge it for themselves. I can guarantee that there will be some protest by a small minority. This will last for, say, a few days, especially leading up to the release. After that, 'Song of the South' should be easily accepted by the public, the same as 'Snow White' and 'Pinocchio' and 'The Lion King' and so many other Disney classics have been over the years. 'Song of the South' has a wonderful story, solid acting (especially by Remus himself, James Baskett, and the young Bobby Driscoll, who would later do the voice of 'Peter Pan'), great songs, and three very funny B'rer Rabbit cartoons. If some are offended at the 'Tar Baby' reference, please don't be. There is offense in just about every film that I have seen, and it's best to weigh each film individually, as a whole. 'Song of the South' is a true treasure. For those of you who haven't seen it, you are in for a special treat. Please let Disney know that you want to see this remarkable film.

I am by no means defending any of those things. What I am getting at is, it was our history. A terrible part of our history, but we did learn from it. Slavery had been around for thousands of years. It was and is wrong. But like it or not, it was a common practice. How did ancient egypt become one of the most powerful countries in the world in biblical times? Slavery. Yet, every Easter you can probably find the ten commandments movie on the air.

""Song of the South"" is mid-19th century melodrama set in the ""Deep South"". It was never a politically based picture, it is a purely historical... as well as hysterical (at times), tale of love between the group of portrayed characters. It was a cut of the history of our nation and depicted things as they were during that era. Slavery was a thing of the times, not just in Americas but in much of the world. This film is not a glamorization of slavery; it simply depicts life as it was during the period of a fictional story.

Anyone who could find this story politically incorrect is, in my humble opinion, a true racist at heart, and therein lays the problem for why this beautifully told story has been prohibited from viewing for more than two generations of American children. I have been waiting for Disney to re-release this film for more than 45 years... since my now adult children were CHILDREN so that they could enjoy the wonderful chemistry between ""Uncle Remus"" and the children who took such joy form his wondrous tales of the three ""Brers"", being ""Bear, Fox, and Rabbit"".

About a dozen years ago, I found a VHS version on E-Bay in PAL format. I bought the film for under $10 and also bought a variable format Samsung VHS Recorder/Player for over $200. That's how badly I wanted to add this film to my Disney collection. I still have the VHS tape and the Samsung machine which has only been used to view this film. This VHS PAL tape has poor video quality, but has the story that I grew up loving and still do to this very day.

I'm on the early notification list for the release of this on DVD or Blue Ray I can't wait to show it to my youngest grandchildren who have yet to see this truly beautiful story and the wonderful characters that were created to bring this tale to life. ""Uncle Remus"" would be proud to know that his wonderful stories will be once again available to new generations of children as well as those of us elderly who remain children at heart!

All works of art, whether they are paintings, literature, or films, become popular and remain popular because they posess the ability to  bookmark a topic, a point in time, or sometimes a prevailing social atmosphere and do so in a creative and unique way.  Song of the South is one such creation.  It was an instant classic the day it was released and remains in great demand, in spite of Disney trying to push it into the background and treat it like it's the ugly, unwanted stepchild.

I am disappointed that Disney seems embarassed by this classic film.  They are missing out on more than just revenue by not releasing this film.  Millions of people grew up loving this movie and the lessons contained within it.  Its a shame that we cannot share this movie with our own children and grandchildren.  The story is for CHILDREN and contains sincere and heartwarming lessons that no child would walk away from with anything other than good feelings about people of all races.  If Disney thinks at all that releasing this movie would put them in a bad light with anyone, they are sorely mistaken.  They have created a ride at Disney that pays tribute to it...lets take the next step and release the film!

Song of the South was created as a reflection of simpler times with lessons that are far more powerful and sincere than what the modern day movies portray.  I realize that we live in different times now and we all need to own up to presenting content in the media that doesn't encourage children to smoke, drink, bully, or act in ways that are prejudice toward others.  This movie does nothing to promote any of this.  In fact, I would say that this movie actually could provide parents with an opportunity to teach their children about how times have changed.

My fear is that if Disney does choose to re-release this movie, they will alter and censor parts of it to make it PC which would be a shame.  I know they did this with The Three Caballeros when they re-released it on DVD.

The song alone helps the movie stand out compared to other movies of the time period.

The actual movie itself is great as well. The plot is good and the characters are very believable in portraying the time period of slavery. The movie does a very good job of portraying what it was probably like growing up in Georgia in the slave era. Uncle Remus stands out as probably one of the best characters in the movie. James Baskett was an incredible actor at the time and made me believe that I was watching Uncle Remus tell Brer Rabbit stories instead of someone portraying Uncle Remus.

  Song of the South (2 DVD set) Set in the years just after the Civil War, the story begins with young Johnny (Bobby Driscoll) being sent to live at the southern plantation of his grandmother (Lucile Watson) while his parents contemplate divorce. At first disconsolate, the boy is cheered up by African-American handyman Uncle Remus (James Baskett), who tells him many delightful fables concerning the clever trickster Br'er Rabbit, whose adventures are illustrated in cartoon form. Each story has a moral, which Johnny applies to the exigencies of his real life. Johnny's mother (Ruth Warrick) disapproves of Uncle Remus, and orders the boy never to visit the kindly old black man again. Uncle Remus packs his bags and leaves; while chasing after him, Johnny is injured by a bull. He recovers thanks to the friendly presence of Uncle Remus, and all is forgiven.

The white characters, with the exception of the little boy, are bigots, as wealthy, entitled white people in the South were likely to be during this era.  The stereotypes in the film (and they are stereotypes) are all in favor of the black characters.  So, who is the target of the film's social critique and more likely to be offended by it?  Compare this to the ugly stereotypes of slaves in ""Birth of a Nation.""  In ""Song of the South,"" it's the white characters who come off badly.  Could it be that the Disney enterprise anticipates a white more than an African-American backlash?  Either way, it's time for these fears to be laid to rest--release the film.  It's a brilliant and warm, humane recognition of the folklore of African American culture that we should embrace while we put the ugly past behind us.",1286323200,2,1110,4.635897435897436
1345310,5,B00004RM2X,"I first saw ""Song of the South"" when I was only 4 or 5 years old. The charm of the film, especially that of Uncle Remus and the cartoon characters he brought alive for the children, has stayed with me ever since. This was a unique, beautiful little movie, one of Disney's best, combining live action and animation as no other did. And as others have mentioned before me, James Baskett won a special Academy Award for his portrayal of Uncle Remus. By the way, he was a Hoosier, as I am.

 That the gutless wonder poobahs at Disney, Michael Eisner in particular, are afraid to release this movie on the most up-to-date home viewing systems available in the U.S., is a sin and a shame. There is not one earthly reason not to make ""Song of the South"" universally available to the American public, other than the fact that some aspects of the film offend the tender sensibilities of a few professionally race-conscious groups, chiefly the NAACP. Well, in America no one should have a ""thug's veto"" over freedom of speech -- especially not the NAACP. Come on, Disney organization, what are you afraid of? Do you think they'll start a riot in Burbank and burn your studio down?

 For those who'd like to see the film without having to order from Europe or Asia, it is posted, in short segments, on YouTube. That is how I refreshed my memory after not having been able to watch it for about 60 years.",1284076800,7,1392,4.490118577075099

(The original ""Zip-a-Dee-Do-Dah"" is on that LP.)

Anyone that would, for personal or political reasons, deny those of us who fondly remember SONG OF THE SOUTH an opportunity to see it again should immediately cease and desist. This delightful blend of live action and animation did NOT warp our minds, nor will it harm our children and grandkids. All the extremely violent films that are so prevalent today are surely as detrimental to impressionable youngsters as this sweet movie would be for them benign.

It is these same censors of our sensibilities who have nearly succeeded in relegating the once widely popular poet,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Whitcomb-Riley/dp/0253207770/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Whitcomb Riley</a>, to history's dustbin. It was Riley who gave three generations of American kids such marvelous ethnic characters as goblin storytelling housemaid Little Orphint Annie, but because his poems were written in dialect, these days it's as if they never even existed.

This is wrong, and so is keeping beloved Uncle Remus locked up in a vault of historic denial. To the folks at DISNEY/BUENA VISTA: do what's right, please. Give us our ""Song of the South,"" complete and unaltered in any way. America's children, young and old, deserve no less.",1281571200,9,1736,5.991935483870968

However, if anyone of any race is not offended by what is depicted in the film, why should they not be allowed to purchase it?  Just because someone enjoys this film and wants to see it available for legitimate purchase does not automatically mean that person is a racist.

1345313,4,B00004RM2X,"Song of the South (1946) is a hybrid movie, combining cartoon,
musical within a historical context, similar to Tom Sawyer, Moby
Dick, Oliver Twist and those classics of American and British
literature.

This movie has been maligned by controversy, and as a result, in
the marketplace is virtually impossible to rent or purchase. This
has also been the case, over the past 50 years, in America.

As recently as the 1970's, the musician Frank Zappa - an iconoclast
who grabbed onto anything controversial yet meaningful to real
people,  adapting it with his sarcasm, irony and humor - released
the song ""Uncle Remus"" referencing this work to his music audience.

The entertainer James Baskett  plays Uncle Remus, already having
proven his talent, skills, hard work and professionalism on the
Amos 'n' Andy radio Show (also maligned by controversy and
political correctness) with a heart-felt, mature and honorable
performance - unfortunately passing away 2 years later.

The actress Ruth Warrick is a plantation owner's wife, with 2
""beautiful, ideal and perfect children"" as perhaps only as the
ultra - wealthy could have. It turns out, one of those is played by
Bobby Driscoll, who 20 years later would shockingly die on skid row
from drugs, anonymously and alone.

Taken together, the underlying elements apart from the business are
difficult and tragic. But those are counterpoised by the reputation
of the company behind it - Walt Disney - with all the expected
outstanding artistic elements that are later confirmed to be in the
picture.

The cartoon elements are frequent, and lovely ...with a personal
touch from the artists in bringing to the forefront the innocence
of youth made possible by responsible parenting, and a reliable
community of people having a strong character and honesty, tinged
to a certain degree with religious values, as was the case in the
South of the USA, and the upholding of basic human principles.

The songs performed over the 90 minutes, are appropriate, sung by a
choir of women, in a manner that today would sound perhaps
over-the-top or simplistic, and pro-family. In 2010, that vision
probably would not go pass well with  today's fragmented and
individualistic society. The numbers work well, and underline the
innocents'  vision of the world.

Surprisingly, Europeans can identify with a number of elements,
most of all, the agricultural aspects, such as plowing the fields
without a tractor, but with a bull or a horse, the field workers
walking in line, with various farm tools, such as hoe, sickle,
baskets and more, in their overalls, sweaty and naturally dusty
from tilling the fields. The roads are single lane, sided by trees,
no cars, no asphalt, no traffic lights or road signs. The Sun
shines in the afternoon from a hard day's work in agriculture.

The farm hands will  sing as they walk or work, making the time
pass  faster, as no radio is seen in that time and place-
underlinign the dignity and seriousness of hard work, and the
desire to earn wages from being active.

This is a childhood tale, not as political story. It's a utopian
agricultural small town, with people accepting the rhythm of life
and technology at the time and being happy despite up and downs and
facing challengers.

This film is a thumbs-up winner and would benefit all audiences
world-wide in today's society that is overly-technocratic and
consumerism-driven where every 30 seconds in a person's work
schedule is treated as a life-and-death situation.

Congratulations Walt Disney, for bringing perspective.",1279411200,3,3541,5.065404475043029
1345314,5,B00004RM2X,I am saddened that this movie isn't out in high quality.  I believe it is a great show of our history.

1345315,2,B00004RM2X,"I am surprised so many people love the Song of the South, because it is a mediocre movie at best.  The actual stories are great, but that is due to Joel Chandler Harris and the black folklore he recorded in his Uncle Remus stories.  The Disney story book version of Uncle Remus stories, by the way, is superb; they have kept the flavor of the dialect but made it more readable and  more entertaining.  The strength of the original material, however, is what alone carries the entertainment value of the movie.

The silly back story about the little boy and his father is ridiculous and poorly acted and written.  I disagree with those who see the integration of animation and live action as remarkable; it is no better or worse than any other film from the period which did this.  The actual retelling of the stories is mediocre at best, with silly slapstick humor which takes away from each story rather than strengthening the point of the story.  Furthermore, Brer Fox is at times almost impossible to understand, which makes no sense at all in a children's movie.

I am certainly not against bringing the movie back as an example of the racist and paternalistic attitude of white America during the 20th century, but I do wonder why people love this film so much.  Disney simply botched up superb material (the Uncle Remus stories) with bad scripting, silly directing, and awful acting (except for the main character).  When compared to the many other Disney classics, ""The Song of the South"" is almost on the bottom of the list in terms of quality and entertainment value.  I wonder if those who are so vocal about bringing the film back either don't understand what quality is about in a movie or possibly are more worried about their ""rights"" as consumers than about what is actually good movie making.",1277078400,5,1808,4.686708860759493

1345318,5,B00004RM2X,"Like many others I see no reason for this fine and groundbreaking film not to be available to be seen and/or purchased by today's U. S. citizens.  The time period for this film is after the Civil War (although in the film there is no mention of that) and therefore, the time period is after Afican American slaves have been granted their freedom.  I suppose the Afican American characters in this film are still hanging out at the plantation where they were once slaves and I imagine slaves did not just drop everything they were doing and walk away to find paid work elsewhere once they were freed.  This film is about transition and this is to be found everywhere in the film.  The one-time slaves in this film are depicted as easy going and ever eager at night to sit around the camp fire and tell stories and sing wonderful songs from their history.  Is it wrong to depict one-time slaves enjoying their lives as the characters in this film seem to be doing?  The greatest loss of not having this film freely viewed by U. S. citizens is the many excellent and well rounded performances of the African American actors in this film, including the fantastic Hattie MacDonald, that are being missed. James Baskett, who plays Uncle Remus, as if he was born to play the role, for this film won an honary Academy Award for his brilliant characterization.  He also sings Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah and it's a great rendition.  What a shame this film is not being seen.  I think Disney should get President Obama to tape a short speach that could be played before the film as an intro.  It's time not be be ashamed of history.

This is yet another example of political correctness gone mad and not releasing it is an affront to all of us no matter what the colour our skin.  The film is widely available on video yet you do not see African Americans rioting over Song of the South anywhere in the world.
Taking your stance to it's logical conclusion Disney, the following Disney films should also be banned:
Snow White - it is offensive to short people, Pinocchio - offensive to anyone with a large nose,  Dumbo - offensive to anyone with large ears, Bambi - the film promotes hunting and animal cruelty, Cinderella - only beautiful women go to the ball, Alice in Wonderland - (can`t say for legal reasons), One Hundred and One Dalmatians - animal cruelty again, Jungle book - Mowgli was discriminated against as he was human, Robin Hood - promotes crime, The Fox and the Hounds - promotes a banned sport, and animal cruelty, Beauty and the beast - Disney infer only good looking men should be with beautiful women, Pocahontas - race again.  These are just a few of your animated films - come into the 21st century Disney and release Song of the South on DVD ASAP.
There would be one fair test, ask President Obama if he would be offended by it - if the great man himself is not offended you have your answer.

is Titled ""SONG"" of the South, because it is a STORY, set in the reconstruction era. Few had money, it was a near cashless society; most Plantations had fallen into hands of speculators. Many of the 'unpaid and ignorant help,' felt unwilling to relocate to northern urban areas. They knew hard work, and oppression...the unknown was often more frightening. Therefore, they remained with land owners they knew...whether a kind Planter they HAD been owned by, or one nearby who had a reputation of fairness.

The freedmen's ideal was, options. They could sharecrop for product and provisions. They could venture into the Northern Unknown. They could open a business to cater to black clientele, equally penniless. They could 'hire on' to a land-owner's staff. This was the reality of the period...ONLY A TINY GLIMPSE OF THIS COLLECTIVE STRIFE CAN BE GLEANED FROM THIS FILM.

""Mouse, Inc"" has incessantly released and re-released ZIP-a-Dee-Doo-Dah tunes over the past 60 years. It has spent millions building an EXTREMELY POPULAR ride at Florida's MAGIC KINGDOM...namely SPLASH MOUNTAIN. Even the animated ""stories"" have been edited from the film and stitched together to create a quick-sale music video! They know they are cashing in on the franchise...They just don't want to have the movie OFFEND the sensitive...enough about that!

This movie has NO VALUE to the modern audience...anymore than you find people racing to the cineplex to see PAINT YOUR WAGON. SONG OF THE SOUTH would fail as an intact release because:

1. It doesn't have VIOLENCE.
2. It doesn't have FART jokes.
3. It's rated G for GOD's SAKE!
4. It has not objectionable material for children under 10.
5. It has a bunch of 'situations,' and boring grown-up stuff.
6. TOO SLOW PACED to keep interest of SUGAR-infused A.D.D. kids.
7. Stereotypically negro cartoon voices
8. PARENTS that overcome their selfish differences.

WHAT IT DOES HAVE is Art House Appeal, for instance:

1. No FART jokes.
2. No Gratuitous Violence.
3. The 'working class' are given screen time to play a GREEK CHORUS, (they separate the key plot twists, with mood-setting neo-spirituals.)
4. The introduction of BOBBY DRISCOLL.
5. A RARE big screen appearance by RUTH 'All HER Children' WARWICK.
6. MORALITY FABLES hidden in animated shorts.
7. U.B. IWERKS' masterpiece. (Acclaimed for Tom cat dancing with Gene Kelly, for adding more BIRDS to an Alfred Hitchcock classic. Popping in for son Jolly Holiday music, etc. ...This blows EVERYTHING ELSE HE HAS DONE OUT OF THE WATER!)
8. With a child-driven story...the adults are given time to form opinions...
9. HATTIE McDANIEL...okay she's playing a mammy-role again, ...but, her smile seems sincere.

What it has for multiple viewing...aka HOME VIDEO...controversy.
An option to springboard on 'look how far WE'VE come...not the black's only...ALL of AMERICA.
Colorful.
A feel good ending.
Socially, economically, and racially open relationships.

1345339,4,B00004RM2X,"Disney, in the past three decades, has buried 'Song of the South'. It's not mentioned anywhere as a film, but B'rer Rabbit and the other characters pop up from time to time in the Parks, but only the characters, not the movie. You might hear 'Zippidy Do Dah' played in the Parks, but that is about it. Not the the film is really racist, but it sure does reflect an Uncle Tom attitude. The Company just took the film and vanished it. It was as if they were ashamed of it.

I've got a copy that was made for the Asian market, where apparently there they are not embarrassed by it. It is in English with Korean subtitles. I  can live with that.  It doesn't seem very racist to me, but then again I'm not Black. Ir does show a rather backward view, there is some Uncle Tom-ing, but it IS a product of it's time. And the songs are fun, and so is the animation. But Disney is ashamed of it and seems to never want to leave themselves open to any criticism.

That's why I think the upcoming 'The Princess and the Frog' is in many ways an apolgy for 'Song of the South'. 'Frog' is full of dark-skinned characters. I hope that it's good. It looks like it might be fun. It will be big, I'm sure, and may have as much impact as 'Mermaid' and the other Disney animated films of the psst twenty years did.

I see more into the interactions between people, I appreciate the work that went into doing all those ""live action"" / ""animated"" hybrid scenes. It's really a great movie.

Obviously, the reason the movie is not getting released is because some people are offended by it and Disney doesn't want to tarnish their image by releasing it. For the detractors: don't forget that this is a ""Disney film."" It's made for little kids. It's going to portray any event in the happiest of lights. Have you seen the other movies? Are those realistic or fair to all races? Wouldn't it have been more racist to portray Remus with pale skin talking like a white man? What did you want: Remus to get whipped after he tried to run away? All the white owners to treat their slaves as subhuman? For the slaves to sing Negro spirituals instead of Disney's orchestrated sing-songs? Maybe that would be cool too (call it ""The Passion of the Uncle Remus""), but that's not what this movie is about.

1345344,2,B00004RM2X,"I recently had an opportunity to pick up an import of this at a yard sale. Being in my early 30s, I never had an opportunity to see the entire film (I have seen the zippity do dah segment)and for my nephew's third birthday I decided to purchase some early Disney classics and thus decided to pick this up. Having watched it I think that it is not one of disney's better (technically) examples of the animation/live action films. It's morality is not as strong as old yeller, and the songs are okay (disney has done better and has done worst then the tunes presented in the movie). I am not afraid of controversy persay as I purchased a collection of old Tom & Jerry cartoons for my nephew. In this particular instance MGM studios did a preface to the dvd putting the offensive language and imagery (the mamie character among them) into context and to be clear about its inappropriateness in this day and age. Unfortunately, the problem with songs of the south is such a simple preface to an official USA release would not suffice. Disney wanted it both ways...the studio wanted the ability to set its stories mythology and wanted to set a story within a distinct historical context. unlike disney's typical fairy tales songs of the south takes place within a specific historical context that adds to the story as much as the linguistic stylings. but there are to many artifacts of history that led to jim crow and systemic racial prejudice (which doesn't do whites nor blacks any good) lingering in this movie...I don't know how I would explain to my newphew - why when the mother comes into the room to wake johnny she doesn't acknowledge Toby (the frog scene), when the grandmother and mother are talking about not having uncle remus tell stories to johnny and the g'mother alludes that uncle remus is good for johnny cause he needs someone his own age (despite uncle remus being old enough to be his grandfather), the fact that the mother is upset about her missing son but she sends 'aunt' tempy to find him, the fact that bre'r fox seems determined on hanging bre'r rabbit (he mentions it during the tar baby segment and in the laugin' place segment he's leading bre'r rabbit around by a rope around his neck), of course there's the fact that johnny's mom can address uncle remus in the familiar but he must address her as 'ms. sally' (again despite being old enough to be her father)...these are historically fair but when disney decides to spin a tale in which a young boy seeks a father figure and finds it in uncle remus it begins to ring untrue. We've come far, but because kids are impressionable (and in fact many adults don't have a handle on the issues broached in songs of the south) it would be a problem for disney to release this in the US. To be fair I am not sure it deserved a video treatment releasing in Asia/Europe (but its already happened)....but given america's history (maintaining slavery after most industrialized countries including the caribbean had outlawed the practice, almost 100 yrs post the ending of slavery of Jim Crow state/local laws, and modern day adults still having difficulty cultivating and maintaining friendships across color lines) disney has a difficult task before it when this work is ultimately released into the public. ultimately, I would like my nephew to know about the rich storytelling tradition of the south, I would like him to understand america's mythology that comes from during that time period...unfortunately song of the south is to problematic to do that...",1248566400,8,3527,4.7272727272727275

1345351,5,B00004RM2X,"First off, $250 for a BOOTLEG?! This wonderful film has NEVER officially been released on DVD, therefore any dvd you see of this film is a bootleg.

Second, it is not a banned movie, nor did the NAACP ever attempt to ban it. In fact, when it first came out, the NAACP noted ""the remarkable artistic merit"" of the film, but stated that it gave the impression of ""an idyllic master-slave relationship"". Apparently, the NAACP has no current official position on this film. Disney execs have taken it upon themselves not to re-release the film, even though there have been no documented complaints stemming from the last 1986 release. Notice I said LAST 1986 release, because that was the last time it was re-released, hence no official dvd release. The movie was re-released in the UK and Japan, but was withdrawn worldwide in 2001.

I haven't lost hope that Disney will re-release this film, as it will become public domain in 2039 and you just know Disney isn't going to miss their chance at making some bucks before they lose their copyrights. I'm just hoping they don't wait until 2038 to do it. I would love to see this movie again and share it with my children, but I fear they will be grown before it happens.

As a final word on all the controversy over racism in this movie....what a crock! The time period is set AFTER the civil war, when slavery was abolished and is clearly established in the film where we can see that Uncle Remus is FREE to leave the plantation of his own will. Yes, there is some stereotyping, but it is a fairly (if sadly) accurate portrayal of life in the deep south back in the day. It is a part of our history, for better or worse, and future generations deserve to have the rich stories of Brer Rabbit and friends passed on.",1244419200,8,1758,4.4875

If Disney is putting ""Song of the South"" locked under 7 keys because its supposedly rather strong racist content then, by that train of logic, ""Gone with the Wind"" should also be banned.  I have watched GWTW several times as I was growing up, it was my mother's favorite movie, and saw it several times with her.  In many ways GWTW deserves its reputation as a great movie.  The sets, the cinmagratophy tech for 1939, the acting quality and the romantic story between Gable and Leigh was extremely engaging.  But as I matured and learned about the terrible thing that the South was trying to do during the Civil War (destroy this country to preserve slavery) the last couple of times I saw it, I started analyzing critically from a historical point of view (I am a history major with the Civil War as one of my specialties) and saw the movie in a new light.  ""Gone with the Wind""  is a blatant piece of pro-Confederate propaganda, that depicts Northern soldiers as monsters, white Southerners as noble protectors of ""great"" civilization that was ""Gone with the Wind"" and the black slaves as feircely loyal to their Southern masters. In other words a thourghly offensive movie that completely distorts history, racial relations of the era, and denegrates the great sacrifice the North went through (360,000 deaths) to keep this country together. I have not watched GWTW since then, about 15 years ago. Despite all this, do I think that GWTW should be banned? NO! NO! NO! No matter how offensive certain cultural creations might be to a certain gruop or even a great majority of the population destroying them or banning them does not help us become a better person or society. We can only become better people if we learn from our mistakes, and on a cultural level learn of the dark side of humanity in the past and learn not to commit these ""dark events"" again.  So back to ""Song of the South"".  I do not know how long the ""offensive"" parts of this Disney movie last, and whether they are really more offensive than GWTW offensive moments, but banning it serves no purpose to my or the public in large cultural development.  Disney, please release ""Song of the South"" and trust that the American people are smart enough to learn the lessons that the movie intentionally or untentionally teaches us.",1243987200,,2442,4.6342592592592595

The place was packed with noisy kids, but they all went quiet when Uncle Remus started telling his stories. In the intervening years, the dreaded Political Correctness has relegated this movie to the Disney Vault, although I was able to find an imported copy. I recently watched it for the first time in 35 years and you know what? There's nothing wrong with it. It might have some stereotypes but nothing offensive or even questionable. Think of Gone with the Wind or some of the old Shirley Temple movies or even Our Gang. I certainly wouldn't think twice about letting my own children watch it.

With that out of the way, SONG OF THE SOUTH is every bit as memorable as Pinocchio, another movie I just watched after too many years. In both cases, elements of the movies have entwined themselves around our collective consciousness. The Tar Baby, for example, is a metaphor I've heard used often. I use it myself. (Disney changed it to a Honey Baby on their Splash Mountain ride.) And who can forget Br'er Rabbit begging Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear not to toss him into the briar patch, which is just where he wanted to go.

'PC' is destroying this country and those who cave into it stifle our history, creativity, honesty & all that was once good & made this country great. We should always embrace our history because simply put, we are who we are today because of it. Slavery was a dark part of our history for sure but to cover it up or deny it ever existed is to cheapen what we've learned from that chapter in our history. We cheapen what we've accomplished & become today, because of that very history. 'Song Of The South' IS a beautiful movie & certainly nothing to hide deep in the vaults. It's certainly not 'Mandingo' or for that matter, 'Gone With The Wind'. Should we pull 'GWTW' because it shows slavery? Back then Disney took a story based on beloved children's tales presenting it with all the sensitivity & dignity that it deserved. It's a fun filled, lighthearted, often humorous, sometimes sad tale of a boy growing up who didn't fit in. A kindly old slave known as Uncle Remus understands what the boy is going through and decides to help him by telling him stories of a cunning & crafty old character called Brer' Rabbit. These stories come alive bringing live action & animation together, the way only Walt Disney could do it. Plus he gives us one of the most memorable, beloved, songs in Disney history, ""Zip-A-Dee-Do-Dah"". Through these stories the boy learns how to stand up for himself, how to deal with others, how to get out of tight situations. The love that exists between the boy & Uncle Remus tugs at your heart. Uncle Remus understands the boy more than his parents & the relationship they forge is truly beautiful. It's representative of all that is pure, good & human. It transcends 'color' & for that it should be celebrated not shunned. If Uncle Walt were still here, I'm sure he would agree. He loved this story & felt it was one of his proudest achievements. To continue to deny 'Song Of The South' to the public would be a huge disservice to Uncle Walt but remains a travesty for the very public it was intended for.

I am now in my sixties and as a white child I was taken to see Song of the South. The one thing that stands out in my mind is that even in the '40s, I learned that love between two people has nothing to do with race or age. It was the beginning of my education about love between people of all kinds and it is so sad to me that today's children can't see this wonderful, extraordinary story. I also understood very clearly that the African-Americans were not being treated right and that was the beginning of my enlightenment that helped me become a civil rights activist in the late '60's.",1233100800,,679,4.223076923076923

You get child-adult interaction that's natural and you don't see these days.  Uncle Remus isn't really a family member, but the kids treat him very well.  He's practically Mr. Rogers.

The story itself is a very popular one from Uncle Tom's Cabin.  Disney brought out the humor and message the story was meant to have, and created characters kids could easily understand and love (or love to hate).  For all the racist comments against the storyteller, the story is a metaphor for a black man outwitting two evil white people.  I enjoyed this as a child, and after learning more history, I still enjoyed it.

You don't have to be too young or too old to understand what's wrong, and I feel that despite the accusations against this movie, it has a message that goes against all the slander and teaches children to think things through about people, both good and bad, and to use good judgment, not to  be duped by tricks or prejudice.",1232582400,,1193,4.315315315315315

The problem is in the packaging and marketing. Song should be released to educate, but it's marketing and packaging should not lead people to think this is an appropriate, relevant, or happy-go-lucky piece of entertainment.

It's difficult to acknowledge that things we loved as children are not what we perceived them to be. As adults, though, we should turn a critical eye to things we learned as children and see them from different points of view. There are, like it or not, portrayals of black people and relationships between black and white people that are racist. Though the relationship between the white boy and Uncle Remus is friendly and loving, there still must be discussion on why that relationship exists, how voluntary it is, and what the power dynamics imply.

Song of the South is valuable in that it relates complex issues that teach universal lessons: that personal relationships often have broader societal contexts and that social conditions impact personal relationships; that America has always struggled with racism, classism, and sexism; and that insensitive portrayals of ethnic groups have often been wrapped in a colorful box.

To me there are far more offensive things on television, not to mention all the other forms of media, than this story.  Not releasing this movie because you don't want to offend someone is ridiculous, I do not believe the story was meant to be offensive (it was set in a time where it could be believable).

This is a quote from the Wikipedia website. However with the Frog Princess in the offing as  Disney's first  animated feature with African-American as lead characters. Over the past two decades Disney has moved beyond the simple white princess. With Mulan,Lilo and  Stitch,and Aladdin to name a few. Disney has done much to rebuild its image as a family entertainer but also  for all families of all colors. So Its very doubtful they would want this film re-released for public consumption. To show how Walt Disney depicted Blacks during this period would only hurt today's fans and serve no true purpose. We all know Walt Disney was a racist. But as Warner Bros has decided not to show Bugs Bunny in black face anymore. So should Disney ban this film. After all the work Disney Studios has put in making a better image for themselves and how Blacks are depicted in film  I very much doubt we will be seeing tar baby and his ilk an time soon if ever. America has a less than honorable past and while I'm against revisionist history where we don't talk about such things. When I was young and saw this film I was happy to see another Disney film but when I figured out that Tar Baby was a racist idea of a black child I was hurt . That Walt Disney would allow such a image to be animated lowered my opinion of the man greatly.

The idea that this film would offend people on racial grounds, but that ""Gone with the Wind"" or ""Birth of a Nation,"" both available on DVD, do not is simply ridiculous.  It also is hypocritical, since there is no hesitance to release any number of westerns that feature whites playing Indians who speak in idiotic pigeon English.

To suppress this film is unfair to the actors who put so much into their characters.  Why should James Baskett or Bobby Driscoll be denied recognition for their wonderful performances?  The film also features seminal Disney animation in the segments with Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox and Brer Bear, who bring Uncle Remus's stories to life, a brilliant cinematic innovation.  This was the first film I can recall that combined animation with live actors, something Disney ought to be proud of.  And, despite its age, the film holds up quite well.  It is a piece of film history that deserves to be seen, enjoyed and discussed.

In a year that will see our first black Presidential candidate, Disney ought to realize that our country has grown up quite a bit in the past 40 years and issue ""Song of the South"" on DVD.

Song of the South is of its time, and yet by no means is it similar to the Amos and Andy shows of the same era, that is, it's the antithesis of those old shows that insulted and mocked people of color.

1345422,5,B00004RM2X,"A large group of supporters have garnered huge amounts of support recently for the release of this film.  From my experience it seems that the primary reason behind this rallying is simply childhood memories of rightfully nostalgic adults.

I am not so much a nostalgic adult, but I am a committed student of American identity, and, clearly, a truly informed view of the present cannot exist without a full knowledge of the past.  Song of the South is, without question, the most important film of the recent American past that is still unavailable in the present.  From our very beginnings, due to our credos and institutions, America has been engaged in a constant struggle to find some sort of unity and commonality that can blend the sentiments of all races, nationalities, and beliefs into the American people.

This film, in the most innocent and accurate way, shows the strife, the joy, and the beauty of this struggle and the individuality ever-present in what we only assume to be the homogenization of a nation.  I would love nothing more than to be able to fully examine this film for its diagnosis of the society it depicts and that in which it was produced.  I would love to search its contents for commentary on today's teetering racial balances and fully understand the impact a simple 90 minute children's movie had on society as a whole.  No one will be able to see these results and implications if no one is able to see the film itself.

1345433,5,B00004RM2X,"Ok, here's yet another review for this movie which seems to inspire either devotion or nasty diatribes. Admittedly, I haven't seen this movie since I was a child. I remember loving the songs and the animation. I thought that ""Uncle Remus"" was very funny and brave (sound like Brer Rabbit, anyone?), and he was trying to teach the little boy (yes, the rich little white boy) how to make the best of bad situations. I don't remember getting the impression that the black people/negroes/(stick your PC term here) in the movie were depicted as being ""happy"" about their second-class citizenry so much as they were shown as focusing on what positive things they could, and just dealing with the unpleasant things that they couldn't change. In self-help groups, this is usually referred to as ""thinking positively."" It's a coping mechanism, not a denial of reality, and is not meant to belittle whatever is wrong with your situation, whether it's racism, sexism, or what have you.

We recently purchased Disney's Platinum Edition of ""Peter Pan"" for our little boy (he's 3 years old), which is what inspired the title of this review. I somehow missed seeing the Disney Peter Pan movie as a child, and so I was absolutely flabbergasted by the caricatures of Native Americans in the film. The only attractive one is Princess Tiger Lily. How can Disney think that it is all right to depict Native Americans in the worst sterotypical fashion imaginable (and not just visually, either. Just listen to the song they sing after Peter Pan rescues Tiger Lily!) and find ""Song of the South"" to be unacceptable? I can only assume that because ""Peter Pan"" is totally animated that it somehow becomes acceptable to present these racist sterotypes. A more negative interpretation of the Disney Corporation's seeming double standard might be the observation that Native Americans do not have the equivalent of the NAACP...

In closing, I would like to ask Disney to remember that we are living in America, the ""Land of the Free,"" and it would be nice if they would allow us the freedom to make our own decisions about what is acceptable (or not) for us, personally. I do not appreciate having other people decide what is best for me, like some kind of well-meaning ""Big Brother."" If they're still paranoid about having people think badly of the Disney Company because of one old film, maybe they could tack some spiffy little history lecture onto the front of the film, kind of like an introduction, to help put the film into historical context. Actually, this would be a nice approach for many old films, either to explain historical context or to provide definitions of old slang terms, which sometimes are not clearly apparent just from context.

P.S. Yes, we still let our little boy watch ""Peter Pan"" even with the stereotyped Native Americans; when he's old enough, we'll explain why I find the depictions offensive, even though I think the film in general is harmless fantasy. Instead of banning the film, I'm going to consider it a ""learning opportunity."" Please take note, Disney execs: America is not supposed to be about censoring and thought-control, but about education and enlightenment... Isn't it?",1190505600,8,3191,4.905555555555556
1345434,5,B00004RM2X,"If nothing else, SONG OF THE SOUTH is arguably the most hotly debated Disney production ever made.  Released to war-weary audiences in 1946, this movie was another exercise in combining live-action with animation, but simultaneously it happens to be an iconic film in Walt Disney's career.  At the time, much of the studio's financial resources were cut off, so it was very expensive to produce a full-length animated feature.  Since it was economically feasible to mesh live-action with short cartoons, it's no surprise that SONG OF THE SOUTH ended up becoming one such title.

The animated segments, arguably the most appealing aspect of the movie, are based on the famous literature stories of Brer Rabbit, whose habit for getting into and out of trouble makes him an invulnerable target for adversaries Brer Fox and Brer Bear.  Walt Disney had always been a fan of these tales, as told by ""Uncle Remus,"" and this film was an effort to bring them to the screen.  On an aesthetic level, the three cartoons, in which our floppy-eared hero outsmarts his foes through psychology, are some of the most colorful and beautifully executed works to come out of the studio, but as stories in and of themselves, they are very intelligent, clever, and well-written.  Who could forget Brer Rabbit getting stuck in the gooey mass of a Tar Baby?  Or running away from his home in the Briar Patch?  Or even the infamous Laughing Place that turns out to be a beehive?  All three of these stories are somehow shoehorned into a live-action narrative in which a kindly old Negro, Uncle Remus (James Baskett, in an amazing performance for which he deserved more than just as ""special"" Oscar) uses his tales to help an unhappy little boy, Johnny (Bobby Driscoll) deal with his parents' separation, bullying brothers, the ownership of a dog, and his friendship with a cute little blondie named Ginny (Luana Patten).

It is this central story where SONG OF THE SOUTH's roots of controversy lie within.  Although obviously meant to be harmless and innocent, the live-action plot sometimes feels intrusive.  We never find out the tension between Johnny's parents, nor do we learn anything about the concerns of Uncle Remus.  These scenes are also strangely discomforting at times, particularly the depiction of the various African-American characters (and I'm not talking about just Remus).  They speak in a surprisingly outrageous dialect and are shown to be quite content with their positions as ""slaves,"" going so far as to sing catchy folk songs while going to work.  Even though the movie is not intended to put across any such messages, these sequences can be tough to swallow, especially if you're a sensitive viewer.

I also found it very bothersome that Remus is treated hideously by Johnny's misguided and arguably *bitchy* mother, who wrongfully believes that the old man's tales are only leading her boy astray.  Yet if Remus stands up to the mean-spirited brothers who torment the two leads, then why doesn't he do the same when he's around Johnny's mother?  (Granted, this was typical of the post-Civil War South, where this film is presumably set, but it's another source of discomfort that sometimes took me out of the film.)

Ironically, it was because of such scenes that SONG OF THE SOUTH was made unavailable to the public for many years.  After a very profitable release in 1946 and subsequent reissues, criticisms of the aforementioned live-action sequences, particularly the roles of the African-Americans, skyrocketed so strongly that Disney locked the film away in its vault since 1986.  Consequently, the only way for fans of the film to purchase it for themselves was to purchase bootleg copies of a PAL VHS and/or import the laserdisc release from Japan.

The criticisms surrounding SONG OF THE SOUTH are not unjustified; it may have trouble finding an audience in today's politically correct society.  But stripped of this controversy, is SONG OF THE SOUTH a likeable and beautiful movie?  Absolutely.  The animated sequences, as mentioned, are wonderful, the musical score is very tuneful, particularly the Academy Award winner ""Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah"" and the catchy ""Laughing Place,"" and, if the live-action narrative seems superfluous (and unintentionally offensive), the performances by a majority of the cast makes it easier to stomach.  As mentioned, Baskett's Uncle Remus is portrayed perfectly; just as good are the youngsters, namely Driscoll and Patten, who manage to be both likeable and adorable but not saccharinely so.  The other adult actors do credible jobs, too, although their roles don't really stand out.

On the whole, while the issues over the story and the even more controversial African-American depictions are bothersome, there is no denying that SONG OF THE SOUTH is indeed a lovely, sometimes charming film that has its heart in the right place.  Should this movie be released in America on DVD?  Definitely, although background information SHOULD be given about the film's ""slave"" characters in order to better educate viewers.  At this point, though, it seems unlikely that Disney ever will reconsider and bring SONG OF THE SOUTH to a new generation of fans.  Shameful, too, because in spite of its flaws, this movie does display positive messages of friendship and psychology... and yes, I have to confess, it's a classic.",1182384000,5,5355,5.090389016018307
1345435,4,B00004RM2X,"To the reviewer that compares this movie to a fictionalized comedy about the holocaust...I think Mel Brooks may have covered that already.

This mentality is exactly why Disney will not release this movie in the US--because of the ignorance of some of our people in our great country. Apparently our educational system has failed this reviewer and it is obvious she has not seen the movie. It is also apparent that reviewer knows nothing of slavery and the reconstruction. I do not fault her, but fault our government dictated US educational system which is inherent with the pc mentality that waters down history.

This movie was born out of a book that Joel Chandler Harris wrote and Disney bought the rights to. It pays tribute to the smartness of stories Harris heard from former slaves and handed down to the children of slaves.

If anyone goes on line to read the slave narratives published by the US government you will read some of the same type of stories and some of the same type of vernacular. Ebonics before Ebonics was cool. You  will also learn a bit of the psychology of what it was like to be a slave and the child of a former slave. These narratives will make you laugh and cry at the same time and will put history in perspective during that time.

This movie was actually politically correct for it's time as Disney was sensitive to the issues of slavery and it was not mentioned in the movie. Jim Crow laws were in effect when this movie came out and really Disney should be applauded for producing this movie, in a historical aspect. This movie was liberal for it's time in that it showed how smart blacks were and that blacks were not sub-human as US law dictated during that time. It's sad our reviewer and others appear to be a product of ignorance which scares me more that the undertones of the movie itself.

The ignorant pc folks become our lawmakers and history thus repeats itself in terms of bad laws being put into place.

I did not get the impression of racial discrimination as I did from the classroom reading of ""Little Black Sambo"" or other works that were popular in the 40's and 50's. This is a movie that I would like to see again. When I engage in historical research there is documentation of slaves who, like the character of Uncle Remus, mesmerized children, white and black, with memorable tales. I have no problem with depictions that are historically accurate and basically benign. We did have slaves in this country in all thirteen colonies at the time of the American Revolution. It was Massachusetts that was the first colony to institute slave laws and even after emancipating the slaves in that state continued to engage in the business of the slave trade. When it came to slavery, nobody had clean hands. Had the north been able to grow cotton, in my opinion, slavery would have continued in the north. Since slavery was not economically advantageous after the land was cleared and developed in the north, it was expedient to free the slaves in that region. Free labor in the northern factories, including child labor, was more practical economically than slave labor.

  Therefore, to me, it is a contived fiction to sweep the truth under the national rug. Don't deny history. An honest, charming movie depicting actual circumstances will do more to alleviate social ills than suppression. Disney created a wonderful film and if the public demands the movie it should release it with whatever legal disclaimers that it deems necessary.

It is mostly the story of the folk-hero Uncle Remus telling folk tales to a little white boy who is enamoured by them. The stories he tells are the animations, which is a nice twist. The songs are also very good to listen to.

I learned many life lessons from Uncle Remus that would not have been learned until much later in life.  I believe I grew up a better person for having spent time down in the briar patch.

When I began searching for a copy, I was distressed and saddened that it wasn't being released for fear of racisim.  What happened in the past has already happened and there is nothing we can do about it now, except make sure it doesn't happen again.

Regardless of other's near-sightedness, this is a great movie for all ages with timeless lessons that have sadly been forgotten by today's society.

Although filmed in Phoenix, the setting is an old southern plantation. Johnny and his mother go to stay with their grandmother and that's where Johnny's ""lessons"" begin. Along the line, Johnny makes friends with Uncle Remus and that's where the magic begins for it is his words that bring the tales of Brer Rabbit to life. And what tales they are. But they're more than that. Each tale has a lesson applicable to daily living both yesterday and today.

1345453,3,B00004RM2X,"Song of the South is chalk full of controversy.  It seems to be the black horse in Disney's library of films, constantly hiding and used to politically slander the family-friendly film company.  I will be the first to agree that Disney is slowly loosing its grasp on the pulse of children's cinema with their recent flops and horrid strands of marketing (i.e. why isn't Lilo & Stitch a more popular film?), but after watching Song of the South I don't think they need to worry about any backlash with this film.  I agree that the vision of slavery is extremely skewed, with the truths hidden and the darkness completely removed, but this Disney animation/live-action film is no different, no more racist, than Gone with the Wind.  There I have said it.  I recently had the opportunity to watch Gone with the Wind and completely disliked it because it is such an American favorite, yet it is utterly racist.  Those that argue that it depicts honesty for the time, I will agree with, but it doesn't have to be such a staple to our film community.  With this film constantly getting new DVD face-lifts and awards, I cannot help but wonder why Song of the South continues to be the poster child of evil.  When I watched Song of the South I saw nothing different than what I saw when I watched Gone with the Wind (sans the animated characters).  So I ask you, film reader, is it ""alright"" to like Gone with the Wind and completely dismiss Song of the South?

I am a viewer that critically watches films.  While I do admire films that challenge me, I do find myself a bit more indulgent in children's films because they are a step away from the overbearing nature of adult cinema.  As I watched Song of the South, I was impressed with the steps that it took in the direction and imagination in creating live-action with animation.  It wasn't until really Cool World and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (and maybe Puff the Magic Dragon) that we saw this combination again.  So, on the side of creativity I have to give this film credit.  I also liked the stories that Remus today and enjoyed how it seemed that Johnny connected with these stories to use in his own life.  In future Disney films, I don't think that this would be such a big point because they tend to focus a bit more on the animation than the supposed story, but it was a breath of fresh air in this one.  I also enjoyed the stories that Remus told.  They were uplifting, honest, and simple.  No convoluted tale to frighten or upset just simple stories that could relate to anyone's lifestyle.  I believe the stories that Remus told in this film could be relevant in today's society, the idea of using your mind instead of your brawn is again, a lesson not taught often enough in cinema.  Song of the South was creative, but it also felt a bit bland.  It is due to the film's inability to stand fully up during its songs or core characters, that I couldn't fully admit that this was Disney's best.  It was sloppy, and it is because of this sloppiness (not the racism) that this film should remain just another notch in Disney's belt.

What upset me the most about this film, again, wasn't the racism, but the sporadic scenes, flat acting by everyone outside of Remus, and the choice of actors to put behind the words of the animated critters.  Don't get me wrong, I liked the animated bits, but I just didn't like the actors chosen to voice Br'er Rabbit, Fox, or Bear.  I believe this is the core of the racism discussion.  For me, they just didn't seem to fit the personalities of the animated characters.  There wasn't enough separation between Remus' real life at the plantation to that of the animated segments.  I wanted to be taken away from the plantation and away from the debacle of slavery, but I just didn't get it with this film.  The animated characters sounded too much like Remus, and that bothered me a bit.  The next issue surrounds the actors like Bobby Driscoll, Ruth Warrick, Lucile Watson, and Erik Rolf who never quite congealed into a family dynamic at all.  Bobby Driscoll felt like he had taken ten years a Julliard by the age of four, and I continually felt that when the director yelled ""CUT"", Driscoll would curse, bring out a huge cigar, and have a deep raspy voice.  He was good, but overly good.  At times Driscoll's Johnny made me sick to my stomach.  Then there were the scenes between Hattie and Remus which hinted towards something, but never quite developed.  The conflicts between Ginny, Johnny, and the Favers boys just seemed too clich and completely overdrawn, especially for a children's film.  There wasn't enough reason for the two boys to constantly harass Johnny ... again more development would have been nice.  It was just these smaller segments of this film that transformed this Disney cult classic into a mediocre film.  Walt could have done better.

What would this film be without hinting towards slavery?  I am under the utmost belief that this is not the horrid film that others seem to paint it to be.  While I utterly agree that slavery is the darkest cloud in this nation, this film is not going to suddenly bring people up in arms.  I will also agree that it paints a false picture of slavery for those watching it, but I don't think it is going to confuse children.  What I believe needs to happen is that groups need to look past the fake-slavery/plantation owner moments and see this film for what it truly is ... one that could have the potential to educate children to use their minds instead of their brawn.  I believe there are even deeper meanings in this film that children would enjoy more than the big car chases, explosions, and bathroom humor allowed in so many other films deemed ""quality"" children's cinema.  Song of the South fails at painting an accurate portrait of the south, but honestly people, can we not agree that Disney has never painted an accurate picture of anything in their films.  This is just another glossed image of reality that Disney has maintained throughout the course of its film career.

Overall, I thought it was a fun film to watch, but don't know if I could watch it again.  Get past the racism on this film, I think you will find more in the American loved feature Gone with the Wind, and you will see this as a film that will help our children grow stronger, with their minds - not with their fists.  With some retooling, I believe this film could be released and considered a strong Disney contender.  I enjoyed this film, but not enough to watch again and again.  It isn't my favorite Disney, but not one that I believe deserves all the negative publicity that it has seemingly been handed.  Watch it once, it is worth at least that much!

1345454,3,B00004RM2X,"Well, apparently Bob Iger (president of Disney) told a shareholder that they would be re-releasing the movie ""at this time"". It is a shame.

Personally, I don't consider this a great movie. But I do consider it an important movie as far as race relations and desegregation in the US go.

It is not set during slavery (as most critics claim), the use of black dialect is not worse than that used by Will Smith or Ice Tea, and the original stories of the Uncle Remus stories have been shown to be genuine African folktales only slightly changed by black Americans.

There are so many things to recommend this movie as an important landmark of Black American cinema, not the least of which is that James Baskett (Uncle Remus) was the first black man to receive an Oscar and he got it for his role as Uncle Remus. He was also the first black person to be cast in a Disney film. All the animated characters (heroes and villains and stand-ins) in this film are all African-American...another first. Hattie McDaniels (who essentially reprised her character from ""Gone With The Wind"") is another African-American cinematic icon whose performance we are being denied by the Disney board's hyper-PC attitude.

Meanwhile, MGM has no problem hawking GWTW on DVD and is not being called racist because of it. Nor is anyone complaining about the multitude of films portraying black Americans as primarily drug dealers.

I can remember seeing this on Walt Disney Presents at one time or another and I had the book about Brer Rabbit & Brer Bear & Brer Fox when I was a kid.  The fact that we as a society cannot handle the very concept that Slavery once existed in America, that class and race and status were(and are still to this day) regarded by a large part of the population as the social structure by which all shall live makes me ill.  Is this the way we overlook the past?  Simply pretend it didn't happen?  Soundz like Disney is doing just that.  As for Soung Of The South being offensive.  Hmmmm.  I think I'm more offended by the fact that I had to go out and buy a Japanese bootleg of the DVD just so my kids would stop wondering where all the wonderful characters from Splash Mountain were hiding.  It's a disgrace that they would bend to the will of the politically correct morons and hold this movie back.

Sadly, Mr. Baskette passed away of a heart ailment a year later, decades before Sidney Poitier (1963), Louis Gossett Jr.(1982), Denzel Washington (1989), Whoopi Goldberg (1990), Cuba Gooding Jr. (1996), Halle Berry (2001), Denzel Washington (2001), Morgan Freeman (2004), and Jamie Foxx (2004) would win their acting Oscars.

  Last month, I even recommended to the thirteenth Librarian of Congress, James Billington, the preservation of ""Song of the South"" on the growing National Film Registry and its uncut, unedited, and uncensorized release in the USA.  Why should it only be available for ~$300 on e-bay as a used, out-of-print Japanese import laser disc, which I could play on my home theater system, with distracting Japanese subtitles for the lyrics during the songs?  At least the Oscar-winning song number of ""Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah"" is included in restored color in ""One Hour in Wonderland"" on the supplementary disc of ""Alice in Wonderland"" to offer viewers a tantalizing slice of ""Song of the South"".  Its lessons should be available to new generations of children during theatrical re-releases and home video (DVD, VHS, HD-DVD, etc.) releases.

  In ""Political Liberalism"" by John Rawls from the 1970s, his only consistent example was slavery because it was so far removed in American history and because nobody in his/her right mind would advocate its return.  While slavery was utterly reprehensible in the Americas and is abominable in some countries in the Middle East and Africa today, James Baskette's achievements as an actor in ""Song of the South"" parallel those of American history hero Jackie Robinson, who finally integrated professional baseball in 1947 with the support of Brooklyn Dodgers' owner Branch Rickey.  In one of my volumes of American history which I read cover-to-cover at UIC, Jackie Robinson was the only athlete even mentioned.  Today, only an estimated 120 - 150 Negro League baseball players are still alive.

1345470,5,B00004RM2X,"This is my second time reviewing this movie.  I read over some of the other reviews actually searching for my previoius review.  Not finding it, I am left to the assumption that the reviews are updated every so often, which is fine.  It's great to know that since my first review back in the 90's, people are still writing favorable things about this movie.  Maybe if you went back over ALL the reviews you have received over the last 10 years and could somehow send them to the Disney Company (corporation, whatever), someone might take notice.  Then again, maybe not.  It would be worth a try though.

  In reading over these newer reviews, I saw one that said it had been re-released in the 80's.  I DON'T THINK SO!  If they saw a version of it in the 80's, it wasn't the original; or if it was the original, it was in a foreign language!  Why can people in foreign countries see this movie and we here in this country (where it was made)cannot?  Could it be that they don't have as many ""hang-ups"" as we do?  Get over it Disney!!!!!  That's all a part of America's history!!!!  What happens next?  We re-write our children's history books so that they are ""politcally correct"" and we can all ""feel good"" about ourselves?

  Song of the South is by far the best (and I do mean the best) movie I have ever seen.  Granted, there are ""good"" movies out there but, nothing to compare with ""Song of the South"".  By not re-releasing it so that today's children (as well as the adults who remember it) can enjoy it and learn from its lessons, is like putting a ban on Aesop's Fables.  Come on Disney, get with the program.  We are in the 21st century now!  People need to let go of their ""hang-ups"" (including you) and learn to get along with each other.  ""Song of the South""  is a wonderful and endearing movie.  I enjoyed it as a child, and looked forward to taking my child to see it, or renting it so we could watch it together at home.  Now there's an idea!  Release it on DVD (or VHS for those who don't have a DVD player, or both) and then the ""people"" can make their own choices!!  This IS America, right?  Isn't that what we're supposed to be all about; the freedom to choose?

  I was watching television the other day and saw an ad for ""The Adventures of B'rer Rabbit"" and thought, ""Oh great.

The story is set in 19th century rural Georgia and this was a time and a place where the races were not yet equal. The mix of live action and cartoon is an early one and the mix is well done. Disney is keeping this in their vaults so as not to offend anyone but all the villains in this movie are a fox and 2 white bullies. Uncle Remus is portrayed as an uneducated but wise and gentle man- a good role model for all races. I think Disney is being overly sensitive in not releasing this or making it available.

1345476,5,B00004RM2X,"Though I have never been able to see this movie (it was removed from viewing before I was able or knowledgeable of its existence), I can't help but feel that it is a great movie.  I say this because only really great movies are so fraught with debate and intrigue.  It's as though this film had incorporated some covert military secret that must be kept under lock and key, but not destroyed, because its value is too high.

I understand that slavery is a touchy issue and I weep and blame my own skin every time I see a moving story depicting the evil that was done to so many (Toni Morrison's Beloved comes to mind).  As an Irish descendant, I have learned the value of hard work.  As a Jewish descendent (though I still have no proof of this), I feel outraged at Hitler's fascism.  As a young white woman growing up in the United States, I have been spared many of the torments and heartaches bestowed upon my ancestors.  This does not change my views about what is right and what is wrong.  It does, however, make me that much more grateful for what I do have and want my children to have.  If nothing else, this movie should do the same--provide a link to our past and show that we have much to be grateful for.  This is our happy place.  We must be able to live with the guilt of our forefathers and still breath in simple pleasures.  If we can't, we will never be able to lead a fulfilling life.",1146873600,11,1402,4.249056603773585

1345480,5,B00004RM2X,"There is but one reaction I had as a boy when I viewed ""Song of the South,"" and it was not racism. It was, in fact, so blessedly removed from political considerations that it shocked me to learn that there were others looking at this spellbinding story from a political/sociological viewpoint. That reaction I had was one of pure beauty. I was transported to a fairy tale place by the wonderful Uncle Remus, and that place - The Laughin' Place - was where this boy wanted to go and live forever. To me, Uncle Remus was everything I could ever want in an adult: he understood what was on my young boy's mind, he reached out to me, and he did indeed ""sing"" his tales, so eloquent was his mastery of the art of tale-telling and so joyous his focus on life.

This was high adventure, this was the stuff of the millennia-old tradition in all races and societies of tale-telling. I am of Irish extraction, and I have learned that the Irish were the last of the European cultures to lose its peasantry, one of the hallmarks of which is this ancient art of telling tales - tales designed to evoke wonder and marvel at the great exercise of the creative genius within the human mind. Later, when I attended college, I was to learn that this is also the purpose of philosophy: to evoke awe and wonder in the pursuers of truth.

Criticisms that ""Song of the South"" fails to achieve practical racial advancement criteria should be viewed with great caution. Practicality has nothing to do with the unfettered pursuit of truth, and so politics have no connection with art or philosophy, both of which must be subordinate to no practical intent (when art or philosophy are hitched to political agendas, they instantly devolve into propaganda - to remain art or philosophy, they must be intrinsically ""un-practical,"" serving no master but truth instinctively pursued).

There is another clue to the transcendent value of ""Song of the South"" over practical criticisms - the tradition of another subject people, the medieval Irish, and how their conquerors found their way of life so irresistible that the English crown actually had to issue laws prohibiting the Norman-English lords in Ireland from adopting Irish customs. Ireland had, in fact, won over its conquerors with its charm and zest for life, all evident in Irish music, dance, tale-telling, and overall merriment. Am I alone in seeing a parallel to the glorious love of life exuded by Uncle Remus in ""Song of the South""?

Here we have the same paradox of the human condition: the weak possessing strength beyond the military and political might and social position of the powerful, and so we see the white son of the privileged class eager to sit at the feet of the vanquished but joyful black man, rich beyond rubies with his inner peace and unbroken spirit. The youth has in fact come to Uncle Remus to receive the true wealth of the human experience. The message of Christ appears here in force: the meek will inherit the Earth, for they are alive to the real treasure of living that power and privilege petrify in the human spirit. When Christ admonishes His people to seek the higher treasures, that greatness will be expressed not in the lightning strike but in the gentlest breeze ... or perhaps in the gentle laughter of a poor old man delighting young children with tales of wonder, wisdom and laughter. ""Deprived"" of social status, Uncle Remus can really get down to the things that matter to us. The untrained youth knows it and responds, for his heart is tender and not crushed by the artificial concerns of mature society.

The matter of the political propriety of ""Song of the South"" points out this perennial paradox of life, and today's politically overheated society - Black, White, Hispanic, Oriental - should take note. We gain nothing when we confuse practical advancement with personal fulfillment and spiritual enrichment. There is a time for counting votes and a time for relaxing one's grip on the workaday world and leaving it for higher pursuits - for, perhaps, The Laughin' Place, for those pursuits expressed in the impractical exercises of the mind found in all art, philosophy, and religion. Blacks should rejoice in the inner strength of the politically weak Uncle Remus, not run from his example. He is testimony to the ultimate ability of the politically vanquished black man of the 19th century South to triumph over political adversity and the social stupidity that made him poor, simply because he has prioritized the soul over wealth and power. Self-conscious nit-picking over the supposed proper political posture of Uncle Remus in ""Song of the South"" is missing the hidden message that the artists behind this great film instinctively knew ... it's about the human spirit, stupid (to paraphrase that recently formulated political slogan). Paradox is ever the hallmark of truth, and here we clearly feel that something is very right with this picture, even if our mind is trying to distract the heart from what it knows to be right.

So viva Disney, Uncle Remus, ""Song of the South,"" and all who can still relax and dream. For they are the ones who are winning this mysterious thing we call living. There is at present a tale of bondage involving this story. But it is, again paradoxically, the bondage of this wonderful film, so good and necessary for the nurturing of the human spirit, held captive to the politics of our age that prevent it from being sung to all and enriching us with its message of joy and freedom from the world's miseries and cares.",1143763200,18,5539,4.782654127481714

1345484,4,B00004RM2X,"At Disney's 2006 Annual Shareholders Meeting held earlier this month in Anaheim, California, one shareholder present asked Disney CEO, Robert Iger, point-blank when the DVD would be released.  His question was met by thunderous applause from other shareholders.  This was Iger's reply, quote -

""Um ... we've discussed this a lot.  We believe it's actually an opportunity from a financial perspective to put Song of the South out.  I screened it fairly recently because I hadn't seen it since I was a child, and I have to tell you after I watched it, even considering the context that it was made, I had some concerns about it because of what it depicted.  And thought it's quite possible that people wouldn't consider it in the context that it was made, and there were some [long pause] depictions that I mentioned earlier in the film that I think would be bothersome to a lot of people.  And so, owing to the sensitivity that exists in our culture, balancing it with the desire to, uh, maybe increase our earnings a bit, but never putting that in front of what we thought were our ethics and our integrity, we made the decision not to re-release it.  Not a decision that is made forever, I imagine this is gonna continue to come up, but for now we simply don't have plans to bring it back because of the sensitivities that I mentioned. Sorry.""

Sorry indeed.  Keeping this film ""in the closet"" is an act of cowardice on the part of Disney Studios.  And by being timid, they are passing up a golden opportunity to set the record straight.  The DVD should be released - but done in an intelligent manner.  A statement by Iger himself should precede the film, telling movie watchers that the lifestyle depictions of post-Civil War African Americans are inaccurate ... and urging them to watch a special feature included on the DVD.  This special feature would be historical, telling it ""like it was"" both following the Civil War and in 1946 America.  And to illustrate the 1946 dilemma, Iger should mention that none of the African American performers in the film could come to the premiere in Atlanta ... not due to Disney ... but due to the fact that in the Atlanta of 1946, no African American performer could find hotel accommodations (for a very racist reason).  If any film studio could do a good job on such a feature, it would most likely be Disney Studios.  But, there are two other important reasons why the film deserves a DVD release.

The first-ever African American male performer to receive an Academy Award was James Baskett for his portrayal of Uncle Remus in the film.  Withholding the film ""robs"" African Americans of that important milestone in their history.  Shortly after receiving his Oscar, Baskett died of a heart ailment.  And, the film itself also received an Academy Award (""Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah,"" Best Music, Original Song) and was nominated in another category (Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture).

Movie watchers of ALL races deserve the right to revel in the film's good qualities while being mindful (and educated) as to its shortcomings.",1142985600,23,3075,4.773156899810964

The given reasons for the film not being released in the US (I have a copy converted from the UK release) is its supposed racial elements. Except for the Tar Baby sequence, I'm forced to disagree. The african americans in the live action segments are not treated that badly --- for the time period in which the film is set. They are treated by Grandmother as employees (and nothing in the film establishes that they are not paid for their work), not as second class citizens as many in that time period were. The film was made and still shown on TV before the era of the PC movement, and reflects that.

According to the article (possibly rumor) I read, the planned DVD release will be setting the film in its historical context by having a prominent african american actor(s) introduce the film and talk about its historical context. They also intend to include samples of modern Disney shows featuring African American characters, such as The Proud Family and That's So Raven, to illustrate Disney's modern attitude toward the different races. (The Proud Family also features a Hispanic family).

It's also worth pointing out that except for some of the thrill rides like Aerosmith's Rockin Roller Coaster and Test Track, many rides at Disney World is based on a Disney movie, or has one based on it --- but Splash Mountain is themed to Song of the South, and given Disney's attitude toward this movie, many people have no idea what the story behind the ride is.",1142640000,3,1611,4.6456140350877195

I feel that keeping this film behind closed doors is merely a statement that leans toward, ""Walt Disney made a mistake by making this film and it should never be viewed by anyone again, ever!""

  I cherish the work and ideals of Walt Disney and find it hard to believe that anything he gave his approval on was anything less than positive and supportive of all humanity in general. Keeping this film in the vault does nothing more than create a sense of mysterious ambiguity about the studio itself and proclaims infallably that Disney quite possibly did in fact create something racist and slanderous towards the black community.

  Disney Studios needs to release this film as soon as possible to allow the world a chance to see it as it is in it's unedited, original form so that creeping allegations of less than tasteful entertainment being created by Disney can be hung out to dry. I believe Leonard Maltin did a fantastic job of explaining the humor and original intent of the old black and white Disney Classics in the Walt Disney Treasures collections and never once have I heard big news about any kind of backlash resulting in the release of cartoons that did in fact poke fun at African Americans, Japanese, Mexicans and any other stereotypical ethnicities of the time. That's the way they were made, we understand things alot better today and there is no need to hide anything away out of fear of being called racist.

  Disney has done quite well showing it's commitment to embracing all ethnicities and peoples around the world. Why are they so afraid of this film? Let's hope they get over their phobia and finally release this film in all it's glory to all of us to share with each other without fear of reproach and allow this masterpiece to speak for itself instead of hushed rumors and confusing ""myths"" being all that is available to those of us that have not yet experienced it.",1142640000,5,2253,4.598503740648379

POOR UNCLE REMUS JUST DOESN'T FIT IN WITH MODERN SOCIETY.  HIS MOVIE IS POLITICALLY INCORRECT OR OBSOLETE.  HIS ANTICS WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE FOR OUR CHILDREN TO WATCH.  AFTER ALL, THEY ALREADY HAVE PLENTY TO ENTERTAIN THEM ON TV, ON THE INTERNET, AND AT THE MOVIES.

Argument Against Releasing Song of the South:

March 11, 2006

Disney CEO Robert Iger: ""No Song of the South Yet""

During the question and answer session at Disney's 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders in Anaheim, CA, the question was raised by a Disney shareholder why Song of the South has not been released. Here is a transcript:

""My name is Howard Cromer. I live in Cypress, I'm a Disney shareholder. I'm actually delivering a message from my son, 10. He wants to know in recent years, in the midst of all your re-releases of your videos, why you haven't released Song of the South on your Disney Classics?"" [Applause] ""And, he wonders why. Frank Wells told me many years ago that it would be coming out. Well obviously Frank Wells isn't around anymore, so we still wonder why. And by the way, Mr. Inger, he thinks it was a very good choice when they made you CEO of Disney."" [Applause]

Inger: ""Thank you very much. You may change your mind when I answer your question, though. Um... we've discussed this a lot. We believe it's actually an opportunity from a financial perspective to put Song of the South out. I screened it fairly recently because I hadn't seen it since I was a child, and I have to tell you after I watched it, even considering the context that it was made, I had some concerns about it because of what it depicted.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
James Baskett, the actor who magnificently portrayed ""Uncle Remus"", won a special Oscar for his efforts. The film's song, ""Zip-a-dee Do-Dah"", won the ""Best Song"" Academy Award for 1946. Although some Blacks have always been uneasy about the minstrel tradition of the Uncle Remus stories, the major objections to the Song of the South video had to do with the live action portions. The film has been criticized both for ""making slavery appear pleasant"" and ""pretending slavery didn't exist"", even though the film (like Harris' original collection of stories) is set after the Civil War and the abolition of slavery. Still, as folklorist Patricia A. Turner writes:

Disney's 20th century re-creation of Harris's frame story is much more heinous than the original. The days on the plantation located in ""the United States of Georgia"" begin and end with unsupervised Blacks singing songs about their wonderful home as they march to and from the fields. Disney and company made no attempt to render the music in the style of the spirituals and work songs that would have been sung during this era. They provided no indication regarding the status of the Blacks on the plantation. Joel Chandler Harris set his stories in the post-slavery era, but Disney's version seems to take place during a surreal time when Blacks lived on slave quarters on a plantation, worked diligently for no visible reward and considered Atlanta a viable place for an old Black man to set out for.

Kind old Uncle Remus caters to the needs of the young white boy whose father has inexplicably left him and his mother at the plantation. An obviously ill-kept Black child of the same age named Toby is assigned to look after the white boy, Johnny. Although Toby makes one reference to his ""ma,"" his parents are nowhere to be seen. The African-American adults in the film pay attention to him only when he neglects his responsibilities as Johnny's playmate-keeper. He is up before Johnny in the morning in order to bring his white charge water to wash with and keep him entertained.

The boys befriend a little blonde girl, Ginny, whose family clearly represents the neighborhood's white trash. Although Johnny coaxes his mother into inviting Ginny to his fancy birthday party at the big house, Toby is curiously absent from the party scenes. Toby is good enough to catch frogs with, but not good enough to have birthday cake with. When Toby and Johnny are with Uncle Remus, the gray-haired Black man directs most of his attention to the white child. Thus Blacks on the plantation are seen as willingly subservient to the whites to the extent that they overlook the needs of their own children.

When Johnny's mother threatens to keep her son away from the old gentleman's cabin, Uncle Remus is so hurt that he starts to run away. In the world that Disney made, the Blacks sublimate their own lives in order to be better servants to the white family. If Disney had truly understood the message of the tales he animated so delightfully, he would have realized the extent of distortion of the frame story.

The NAACP acknowledged ""the remarkable artistic merit"" of the film when it was first released, but decried ""the impression it gives of an idyllic master-slave relationship"". Disney re-released the film in 1956, but then kept it out of circulation all throughout the turbulent civil rights era of the 1960s. In 1970 Disney announced in Variety that Song of the South had been ""permanently"" retired, but the studio eventually changed its mind and re-released the film in 1972, 1981, and again in 1986 for a fortieth anniversary celebration. Although the film has only been released to the home video market in various European and Asian countries, Disney's reluctance to market it in the USA is not a reaction to an alleged threat by the NAACP to boycott Disney products. The NAACP fielded objections to Song of the South when it premiered, but it has no current position on the movie.

Perhaps lost in all the controversy over the film is the fact that James Baskett, a Black man, was the very first live actor ever hired by Disney. Allegedly, though, Baskett was unable to attend the film's premiere in Atlanta because no hotel would give him a room.

Argument For Releasing: Song of the South

In their overzealous attempt to be PC, Disney has created a thriving ""underground/black market"" for this movie. It has been released in Europe in PAL VHS format, in Japan on laser disc, and most recently overseas on DVD. At legitimate auction sites people are paying into the hundreds of $$ for the DVD. How ridiculous! All necessitated by a company who is wrapped up in a PC bravado that is belied by the release of the motion picture everywhere but the US. So I say screw Disney- I guess we can't handle Gone with the Wind either? Or any other movies with blacks?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What is Disney trying to hide? That there was slavery in this country? That there was and is inequality? That they made a movie in 1946 that might be deemed offensive in 2004? By not releasing the movie, do they hope to ignore or perhaps rewrite history? This from a company with an ""out-of-the-closet"" agenda that is barely disguised. Apparently it is more PC to promote that agenda to our children than to let history stand for what it is, and open doors of dialog about racial equality and pluralism.

Based on Disney's current stance about Song of the South, we have to ask the question what would happen to ""Roots"" if Disney owned the rights to it? How about ""The Holocaust?"" Maybe by never releasing that movie on DVD, we could erase the entire history of WWII, or make Jewish people forget what their ancestors went through.

Then there's the question of why release the movie at all? If it's that offensive, then why be hypocritical about it? That part is obvious - because they can make money on it.

Well, I'm offended Disney! I'm offended that my 4th grade son came asking me to buy it for him today, and I had to explain to him that Disney won't release it for him to see the way I saw it twice as a kid. I'm offended that because I want to own it, I'm going to have to go to the ""black market"" or pay big $$ at auction for the DVD. I'm offended that I'm not as ""worthy"" as the people who live in Europe. I'm offended at censorship.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once again, Disney proves that it's leadership suffers from a severe lack of vision. Poor Walt! This was purportedly one of his favorites. He's probably been rolling over in his grave for years at the directions his namesake company has taken since his death. I can imagine if he were alive and releasing this movie, he'd come on personally and tell the history of the movie and it's value to the modern audience. Hey Disney Company, why don't you go back to your roots and ask yourself, ""What would Walt do?""

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and I have always loved it. I am now a mother of two and when I started buying Disney movies for my children the first one that I sought out was The Song of the South, but of course I could not find it. I am so tired of all of this politically correct garbage. I thought that we lived in America and that we did not censor things. There are a lot of movies out there today that I find offensive and will not purchase but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't be available to other people. The whole ban on the movie is absurd. I live in Florida and my children and I have been to Disney World numerous times, they have a very popular ride called Splash Mountain that they put in only a few years ago and the whole theme of the ride is The Song of the South which is meaningless to anyone under under 25-30 because they have never seen the movie, it makes no sense at all. Why is it that some people always find something negative and never see the positive. If anything this film was way ahead of its time showing the colorblindness of a well to do, young white boy and how someone's color (Uncle Remus) or social status (Ginny) is not what a person should be judged by. As Martin Luther King said ""Judge me not by the color of my skin but by the content of my character."" I believe that is what this whole movie is about, the wonderful relationship between a little boy from a broken home and a wise old man who has survived the bondages of slavery and can still find joy and beauty in the world and shares his wisdom with that troubled little boy. If there was ever a time to release this movie, now is that time.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I saw this film recently for the first time. The setting is a plantation in the south AFTER the Civil War. We know this not only because the Uncle Remus books were set after the Civil War, but because the African Americans in the movie are free. Uncle Remus decides to move to Atlanta, and just packs his things one day, and boards a carriage travelling down the main road.

The film is not disrespectful of African Americans, but rather celebrates some of their contributions to popular culture. The lead performance by James Baskett is wonderfully nuanced and joyful. Of course, I loved his performance singing Zip-a-dee-doo-dah with the birds and bees, and I had been able to see this once before. But since I could never see the rest of the film, I couldn't appreciate how fantastic his performance was throughout the film. It's a shame that such great performances and depictions of African Americans - including Uncle Remus' delightfully comic animated friends - should be hidden from view.

Of course, there are stereotypes of country people - both black AND white - dialects and costumes and behavior reflect how we think those living in rural areas in the late 19th Century would speak, dress, and act. But the main characters transcend these stereotypes, and that's what this film is really all about. All of the children - rich boy Johnny, poor Ginny (white) and Toby (black) - prefer each others company, and that of Uncle Remus. Johnny defies his class conscious mother, who herself learns a thing or two by the end of the film.

And about Uncle Remus' stories - Brier Rabbit should be as well known and loved a Disney character as any. But so many children will never know him, as long as Disney continues to make this video unavailable. And about the incredibly foolish ""moratorium"" policy Disney has established for its other classic animated videos - I can't help but think Walt Disney would be very, very unhappy with the way Disney is being run today. These videos should be freely available so everyone can enjoy them - we need them now more than ever.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I saw this movie back in the 70's and it helped me through some difficult situations. Uncle Remus' stories and advice were very helpful when dealing with the bullies at school. Disney claims that the movie is Politically Incorrect, once again Eisner has shown how out of the mainstream he is in his non-family views of life. How can a movie, that has only been held up by Disney, be Politically Incorrect, but an entire ride at the Disney Theme Parks based solely on the Movie is good fun. By the way, not only has Eisner been the controlling force to keep the movie from being released in the US, but the gentleman who played Remus and his children have been tied up in courts for years trying to get the movie released. This brings up an interesting question. Is the movie Politically Incorrect, or is this a case of a rich white CEO not wanting to pay movie royalties to a very talented black actor and his surviving family.

The reason people want to discuss the banning of SONG OF THE SOUTH isn't only because it is a Disney classic. In America, we are constantly trying to right the wrongs in this country. A few executives at Disney decide to prevent audiences from watching a popular 1946 family classic because 'they' find it offensive. This isn't unlike a publisher who has little affection for controversial authors like Mark Twain ('Huckleberry Finn), James Joyce ('Ulysses') and Henry Miller ('The Tropic of Cancer'), and thereby decides not to print these authors simply because he has ownership of their materials, and he can. But it doesn't mean he is right. Luckily these authors are not being banned today, but there is still this case surrounding SONG OF THE SOUTH.

The United States is made up of various religious beliefs and cultures. We are a great country because we are free to express ourselves. The makers of SONG OF THE SOUTH made this film way back in 1946 for a company run by a man who himself preferred not to offend audiences, even at risk of alienating them by not showing them reality. Instead of portraying the post-Civil War days the way it really was, his idea was to entertain people. Walt Disney was a master showman. In SOTS, he throws out much of the pain and suffering. His view on life, at least within his empire, was pure and simple (Disney-fied). SOTS sugar-coats that day in history after the Civil War. But does this mean the movie should be banned? Some of today's critics watch SOTS and are deeply offended. But why should they be? SOTS is not trying to be a history lesson, just as GONE WITH THE WIND doesn't pretend to be. Where are GWTW's critics?

Americans should be allowed to make up their own minds as to the controversy of this film. The Disney Company has a right to disown SONG OF THE SOUTH if they want, but that doesn't mean their choice is right.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As a person of color I have seen plenty of racism on television to last a lifetime. I know racism when I see it, believe me, but Song of the South is not it. It is a tribute to our proud African-American heritage and should be seen. Uncle Remus is clearly admired in this movie more than any other character. The animation and music ranks among the best work ever done by Disney and the black folklore is included. Considering that the REALLY harmful Birth of a Nation is widely available and hailed as a masterpiece, adds injury to insult regarding the absence of this classic that is a proud illustration of the African-American heritage.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
O.K., enough already. Several comments regarding this movie (most, but not all from those who argue it should be censored, ergo not released again by Disney in any form) contain erroneous so-called ""facts"" about the movie. Here is the truth:

There are NO slave characters in the film. Several comments about this movie go on and on about it containing ""slaves."" Wrong, wrong, WRONG. The movie is set AFTER the civil war. That is fact. The African Americans at Miss Doshy's plantation are working employees, NOT slaves. Yes, the film is set during the Jim Crow era, and yes, one can obviously argue that the quality of life (in terms of housing and education in particular) of the African Americans shown was not much better than that of pre Civil War slaves. But to identify the the African Americans in Song of the South as ""slaves"" (and to therefore imply they are chained, whipped and ordered around by nasty white ""owners"" is absolutely ridiculous. Are there one or two situations in the film where an African American shows a certain level of ""servitude"" to a ""white manager""? Yes, but to define that as ""slavery"" is simplistic, erroneous spin.

The words ""massa"" is never used by anyone, much less Uncle Remus. I've seen several discussions about Song of the South containing comments to that effect, which state or imply African Americans in the film refer to the whites as ""massa."" That is completely false. That term is NEVER heard anywhere in the entire 93 minute film.

Uncle Tom is NOT ""ignorant."" He is defined or implied to be that way in several comments. Why, I don't know, but how anyone can sit through this wonderful film and be completely ignorant of the intelligence, compassion and common sense shown by the Uncle Remus character (at a level frankly higher than that of any white character in the film) is completely beyond me.

As for the general PC argument that the movie ""sugar-coats"" a ""sad period"" in African America History, what's next? Is the PC crowd going to also demand a ban on ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Showboat"" (two films that also contain ""Old South style"" black characters) that are currently readily available for viewing? Thankfully, I don't yet see any ""it isn't PC, ban it"" comments on the Amazon reviews of those films, which leaves me wondering: why does the PC crowd -- which seemingly views the former movies as benign and acceptable -- find so ""frightening"" about Song of the South? I sense that seeming hypocrisy has something to do with a fear of Disney's appeal to children, but heaven only knows.

Bottom line: the minority that attacks Song of the South (and is trying to bully Disney into burying it forever)is running with a political agenda that depends upon on your buying spin and erroneous ""fact."" Don't fall for that - it's a classic film that overall provides a positive message to any honest viewer with an open mind.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The many reviewers who have said ""history is history, get over it"" and have accused opponents of being too PC and oversensitive, have misunderstood Disney's reasons for not releasing this movie. Disney didn't decide to withhold this movie because the ""history"" in it might offend people. They are withholding it because it distorts history. Sure, it's set right after slavery has been abolished, but its portrayal of a peaceful life on the Southern plantation of blacks who decided to stay is unrealistic and gives the idea that slavery must not have been so bad--look how happy they were afterwords and how they just loved staying and serving those nice white folks and their open minded children. Unfortunately that is not how it was for the great majority of former slaves still living in the South after the Civil War. The distortion is what is offensive, not the ""history.""

The animated sequences are great, but the live action is something Disney can't responsibly uphold. I don't want to give my children a sugar-coated version of grim parts of our nation and race's not-so-distant past. To do so would be an injustice to all who have suffered because of slavery. My hope is that Disney will release the animated sections with some new live action scenes of Uncle Remus the way he was portrayed in the books, and in a neutral setting rather than a historical one.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Anyone who isn't embarrassed by the sight of the happy Darkies singin' down on the Plantation needs to examine his heart. (Anyone offended by the male pronoun?) This film is an artifact of a time when the United States was an apartheid country. The glory is that most Americans have moved far beyond that time and those beliefs. It certainly would have been interesting (and could be for a future version) to see slavery depicted in a truer light, and to have the stories put into their historical context, but the film probably wouldn't have found an audience.

To me, this film is a paradox. It's wrong, but it has HEART. I still get teary at the ending. I love the animation. I love the songs. I love the stories. I love Uncle Remus. I love the happy Darkies singing their songs. The fundamental humanity of the characters transcends the stereotypical representation of their status. Indeed, the image of a black man with wisdom, warmth and heart presents a more positive image than what we get from a lot of more contemporary, and presumably ""correct"" films.

Like ""Birth of a Nation"" and so many others, ""Song of the South"" is a flawed masterpiece, but it is a masterpiece and deserves to be seen, cherished and reflected upon. I am thankful to Walt Disney for giving us his version of Uncle Remus, and more thankful to American society for giving us Martin Luther King and Malcolm X to open a path where we can walk arm-in-arm with Uncle Remus and thank him as an equal for the joy he shared with us and to apologize for the pain our society caused to him.

Bobby Driscoll

Born: May 3, 1937 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa
Died: March, 1968 in New York, New York

Bobby Driscoll first appeared on screen in Lost Angel in 1944. Almost from the beginning, his Great Talent and screen presence was evident. He was the first child actor put under an exclusive contract to Disney, and he is known for such memorable performances as Johnny in ""Song of the South, Jim Hawkins in Disney's Treasure Island (for which he received his star on the ""Walk of Fame"", and Tommy in ""The Window"" (for which he received a special Oscar).

The time came, however, when Bobby was dropped by the Disney studios. Despite his memorable performances, he found himself unable to get work. This was an eventuality that Bobby was not ready to deal with; he was unable to adjust to the loss of the fame that he had always taken for granted.

Bobby moved to New York to try stage work and turned to alcohol and drugs. At one point, he was reported to have told Jackie Cooper that he just wanted to prove to the world that he really was a legitimate actor. He just wanted to be remembered. The reality, of course, is that this young man didn't need to prove anything. His talent had been demonstrated to the world many times.

Even being remembered was to be denied him, however. In March, 1968, he was found dead in a tenement building in New York. No one knew who he was, and he was buried as a John Doe in a pauper's grave. This talented young man died completely alone and without friends.

It was a year later, due to a chance checking of fingerprints, that it was discovered that the John Doe they had buried was actually Bobby Driscoll.

Filmography

Bobby's was an extreme case, but it is not the only case of its type. It must be realized that fame, especially early fame, can be psychologically addictive. The Industry needs to recognize this danger with children.

I urge SAG: start preparing the kids early with the knowledge that the fame may not last forever. Establish industry programs to support these children when / if their careers end.

I applaud such organizations as ""A Minor Consideration"" which stands ready at any time to assist and counsel children who have known early fame.

And to those in the public: When a favorite of yours has his / her career fade, consider writing them a note telling them that you haven't forgotten. This single act may mean much more than you realize.

We looked to the lessons to be learned and just enjoyed the simple life.  If they are going to not show ""The Song of the South"", then why have Huckleberry Finn or Tom Sawyer on the book shelves, it is the same issue.  Think what the author was trying to portrey, it was in the instant of time that the books that I mentioned were published and that was our culture then.  The same with The Song of the South.  Let our kids see history and don't ban it because someone thinks ill of it.  That is what should make the U.S.A. so good, the freedom of Speech and the right to see what we want to watch.

1345495,5,B00004RM2X,I saw this when I was a child and it disappeared from my view for many decades.  I nabbed a DVD copy from a website for $8 and watched it last night.  What a wonderful film!!  That was the best $8 I have ever spent.  I sure hope Disney gets a life and re-releases this film so that several generations of kids and their parents can get to see this magnificent tale of the master story teller... Uncle Remus... and that ole Br'er Rabbit.,1138665600,11,436,4.154761904761905
1345496,4,B00004RM2X,"First of all, let's clear up the rumor mill. The NAACP nor any other civil rights group or leader has anything to do with SOS being off the market today. Disney withdrew the film after a 1986 theatrical rerelease on their own accord. It's true that some NAACP members griped about the film upon its initial release in 1946, but they've had other priorities since then.

So back to the film. I'm an African American historian and folklore fanatic myself who grew up with elders spellbinding me with stores much as James Baskette/Uncle Remus does with the children in this movie. So I love this aspect of the film! The animated segments integrate well with the action and the B'rer Rabbit tales are real knee-slappers that gave me some hearty belly-laughs upon viewing this DVD in its entirety last night.

One could argue that one drawback of this film is that it paints too rosy a picture of slavery/sharecropping (the film itself is never clear whether it's during or after slavery, but Joel Chandler's original book was set during sharecropping). But that can be cured by parents checking out some books about the realities of this era and discussing all this with their kids afterwards.

However all but the most hard-nosed and bitter will agree that this film has some good things to say about race relations and human relations in general. It is clear as the rich white boy looks admiringly at Uncle Remus from his bedroom window after a storytelling session that he has tremendous respect for this black man's mind. While Uncle Remus may not be educated in the European/American sense of the word, he is certainly more of a force to be reckoned with as opposed to the typical Black characterizations of this era and is posessed with a dignity all his own.

This was not unusual for the actor James Baskette. He also played a very dignified preacher named Reverend Johnson in the Amos and Andy comedies. He deservedly received a special academy award for Uncle Remus shortly before his death a few years later. (BTW-Johnny Lee, who played Lawyer Calhoun in A&A, was also the voice of Brer Rabbit).

Many people are aware that the film was based on Joel Chanbdler Harris' 1881 book ""Uncle Remus' Songs and Sayings"" and that the white Georgian Harris based his book on the ""Brer (brother) animal tales"" passed orally among African-American slaves. What most people don't know is that a decade earlier, another white writer named Abbie Holmes Christensen recorded Brer Rabbit tales being told among ex-slaves around Port Royal, SC for her pioneering book ""Afro-American Folktales."" I have met many older African-Americans in rural South Carolina who had heard ""rabbit stories"" (as they are called among the indigenous) from their elders without knowing of Harris or this movie. So this is a legitimate part of Black culture.

The movie actually improves on Harris' book in a number of ways. The ""N'word"" is tossed frequently in Harris' book and Harris' Uncle Remus is shown as preferring slavery to education. James Baskette's character lacks these negative aspects. The thread story of the little boy who turns to Uncle remus from his troubled relationship with his family is expanded from the book's brief framing devices of the white boy simply enjoying the old man's stories.

So if you want an accurate history of Blacks during this era, not quite! But if you believe that children should be exposed to the joys of storytelling and the idea that friendship goes beyond age, race, and social class-then this is for the children and for the child in you! Enjoy-and think!",1136851200,237,3576,4.862068965517241

Teaches the very values our children so desperately need to know so as not to become 11-year old spree murderers.  I have a terminally ill older sister who saw this as a toddler, for years afterward plagued our mother to read her the story, and I, who advocate artistic rights as strongly as anyone I know, was not going to deny her the chance to see it once more before she dies.

0 stars for the current corporation that uses Walt Disney's name -- in vain.  Since the early 90s, Disney Corp. has abandoned its roots and made raunchy R-rated movies and cynical, ironic, post-modern cartoons that, while often entertaining, will never rise to the level of ""classic.""

The sheer absurdity and utter hypocrisy of ""political correctness"" is no more clearly on display than in Disney Corp.'s decision to permanently vault Song of the South.  No other major hit movie that I am aware of, let alone one that was nominated for multiple Academy awards (as Song of the South and some of its actors were), is being withheld from the public solely because of its ""controversial"" content.  A few great films are currently out of print, but most have recently been in print and are only temporarily out of production due to lack of sufficient demand, copyright issues, or other economic reasons.  But Song of the South is being withheld from the public simply because of its content.  It will never be shown on TV, cable TV, or pay per view, and will never be available in stores to anyone in the United States.

With all the gruesome, nihilistic, and otherwise disturbing films Hollywood has produced in recent years -- from Fight Club, to Hannibal, to Gangs of New York, to Sin City -- Song of the South is too offensive to be released to the public?  Unbelievable!  I can understand why people objected to Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Passion of the Christ.  I wouldn't want my kids seeing those kind of movies.  But I would gladly and unhesitatingly show them Song of the South.  There is nothing offensive about it at all.

Instead of portraying black people as profane, volitile, and thuggish, as they are portrayed so often today on MTV and BET and in movies and ""music"", Song of the South shows the black characters to be gentle, benevolent, and even role models for white children.  A poignant moment in the film shows a close-up of Uncle Remus' black hand interlocked with the little white hand of the boy.  Remember, this was in 1946, before Brown v. Board of Education and before the civil rights movement.  Walt Disney, who personally cast Uncle Remus, was a man ahead of his times.

Despite its message of interracial brotherhood, Song of the South still is not politically correct enough by modern standards.  Even though the film takes place after the abolition of slavery, political correctness demands that blacks living at that time in America (and especially in the South) be portrayed as victims.  There has to be explicit discrimination, brutality, and suffering.  At least one white person must be portrayed as an evil bigot.  And blacks certainly can't be portrayed as happy.  Uncle Remus was just too cheerful.  He should have been infused with militancy, refusing to help the privileged white family and demanding Affirmative Action, and yelling ""black power"" like a leader in the Nation of Islam.  Instead, Uncle Remus was a happy, caring person with not one ounce of hate or resentment in him.  And for that, he has been banned.

The NAACP has requested that Disneyland dismantle the scenery from its Splash Mountain ride, because it features Brer Rabbit and the other cartoon characters from Song of the South, though no hint of Uncle Remus.  This is Disney's only token acknowledgement of Song of the South.  The NAACP would rather kids grow up listening to some gangster rapper glorify crime, violence, and sex with prostitutes than grow up singing Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah with Uncle Remus.  No major record label has banned ""cop killer"" rap albums.  But Disney has banned Uncle Remus.

The NAACP and other purveyors of political correctness don't want black people to be happy.  Maybe that sounds extreme, but sadly, that's exactly what it comes down to.  Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah is  joyful.  Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah might encourage lots of black people to enjoy life, to take a break from the angst and victimhood they've been fed by the media and the schools and the politicians, which keeps them dependent on the politicians and on groups like the NAACP.  Remember, their power and influence dwindles in direct proportion to blacks' satisfaction with life.

Song of the South is as profoundly anti-segregationist and anti-bigotry as any film I've seen, even though it's not a political film and has no axe to grind.  I bet thousands of people who believed negative stereotypes about blacks being dangerous or otherwise unfit for whites to befriend had their minds and their hearts changed by Song of the South.  Even if you walked into the theater in 1946 hating black people, you would not walk out feeling hateful.  You couldn't, unless you were a total sociopath.

You can still buy import and bootleg versions of Song of the South on ebay, but this movie deserves much wider availability and  restored/remastered DVD treatment.  That a culture elevates absolute trash with no redeeming value to prime time TV (i.e., Fear Factor) and to the top of the box office charts (i.e., the sleazed up version of Dukes of Hazzard) but suppresses a genuinely good-hearted movie and a landmark in the history of animation and cinema, shows what backward times we live in today.

Better get your copy of Gone from the Wind before it too is banned (it's been declared ""racist"" for the same reasons that Song of the South has).",1130630400,76,5424,4.8926615553121575

The whole world deserves to know the stories of ""Uncle Remus"" and ""Brer Rabbit"" and ""Tar Baby"" and the whole gang.  The world has taken away too many of our freedoms as it is, so please, don't take away another great pleasure that should be known and available to all.  Give us ""Song of the South"" again....PLEASE!!!

""Uncle Remus"" FOREVER

Like me, my daughter was enchanted by this film, especially the basic morals imparted by the tales of Brer Rabbit segments. Neither of us were remotely provoked into thinking about any racialist undertones until we heard that the film had been banned. How absurd!

If anything, it shows love between people, regarless of color, social status, or age.  Which in my opinion is what life is all about.  I quote things from the movie and sing the songs and my kids cannot even know what I am talking about, except by my inept attempts to explain the movie to them.

It's probably true that if someone goes into ""Song of the South"" looking for something troubling, they'll probably find what they're looking for.  ...But unless your deeply prejudiced, those troubling feelings just won't come looking for you.

I try to watch every movie through innocent eyes, and ""Song of the South"" led me to laugh, cry, and feel totally at one with a couple of little boys, a little girl, and an old black man ... people who look, talk and behave nothing at all like me.

I recently read another man's review, in which he said he believed the movie's primary lesson is tolerance, but as nice as that notion is, I honestly feel it's inaccurate.  When ""Song of the South"" closes, we aren't ""tolerating"" it's characters, we're genuinely loving them.

Yes, the movie would be labled ""politically incorect"" in today's world because of the way black people were portrayed in the South in those times.

1345515,4,B00004RM2X,"Disney is doing what it is always doing these late years since Nixon, Reagan, and Bushes I and II: caving to the notion that politics can't be talked about.  In this case, even inferred.  That is the reason they dumped Michael Jackson's ""Captain EO"" and had subordinate Mirimax dump Michael Moore.  (I would like to add that Disney, after refusing to release ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", sold the film to the two brothers-executives of Mirimax, who subsequently made more money on that film than DISNEY made on any film of theirs that year; so, how could it possibly be against their shareholders?  I would like Disney to answer this!)

I'll ALSO include the VHS release of Fantasia back in the '90s that showed Disney and proved to Disney that people WANT these classic films regardless of religion or politics, or even for the scenes Disney deleted from Fantasia's Beethoven segment for that VHS.  Walt might not be alive today, but if he were, I don't think he'd mind that the public watched his films.

On a personal note with Disney, their consumers (to whom they market on behalf of their shareholders) are people who want these things because they like them.  How can anyone in their right mind decide to pass over the release of a film so talked about?  I don't want to say it, but the word ""chicken"" comes to mind.

Don't you know?  The Art Speaks For Itself, and not the Disney Company nor anyone else should meddle around in the views of the artists from whom employ the destributor to get their message to the people through un-wise executive decisions as WHAT NOT TO RELEASE!

I resent anyone else trying to make that decision for me in the hypocritical name of being ""PC.""  I, for one, do not find this, one of my most beloved movies of all time, to be offensive.  I do find it offensive that it is not available to the public to exercise their freedom of choice as to whether or not to watch it.  It is a classic and shows nothing but a way of life, which is now history, in a really unrealistic and naive way at that, and brotherly love and the overcoming of the racism that prevailed at that time.  I feel that it was done with taste and dignity and respect toward all peoples and that brotherly love is its message.  Those who do not feel the same way do not have to watch it.  Censoring it is very much like agreeing with those who claim that the holocaust never happened or trying to edit out parts of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" or Mark Twain or other classics that today are deemed not to be ""PC.""  Maybe we should also edit Shakespeare and Dickens and friends?  If you do this, you lose the flavor and climate of those days in history, and the lessons of those times will be lost.  The last time ""Song of the South"" appeared in the theaters, my son was too young to enjoy it and has only heard the tales and wisdom of Uncle Remus as bedtime stories.  He is now twenty, and I do not want him or his children to miss out on this classic.

I think that our so called ""PC measuring sticks"" need to be checked or, better yet, thrown away.  People have a right to choose.  I agree with the reviewer who said that this film presents people of color in a more respectful and positive light than does the cable channel that is supposed to represent them.  I was more offended by ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" and by the horrible, violent killing of Simba's father in ""The Lion King"" and by the flogging of the Hunchback of Notre Dame than anything presented in ""Song of the South.""  (I know children who were traumatized by those scenes.)  I miss this movie and its beloved characters very much.  Please, Disney, release this movie and do not ruin it with ""PC"" editing.

American history shows us that Indians, Negro's and Arabs have been used, discriminated (and killed...) for the American ideal. Any books and films that try to deny or sugarcoat it SHOULD be controversial. So for example James Earl Jones wants it released, fine, but Sidney Poitier does not. So this film is controversial. That's a fact.

Fair enough and point taken; after all this film has become famous for it.

However not releasing it in the US but releasing it in other countries is measuring with different sticks. Apparently Disney released VHS and Laserdiscs copies and hence all the bootleg copies now.

The film is now an important classic and can be seen with the above in mind but still enjoyed for its undeniable value. After all we are not talking about some Nazi or KKK propaganda film here, it is a children/ family film made a bit too nave.

Nothing more, nothing less.

A dilemma for Disney; they need to be politically correct and don't know what to do. Yes, individually you can get a bootleg and donate 10$ to an organization for the rights of black people at the same time and you're ready.

Disney could also make a special edition of this film, with a booklet and footage of the controversy about it and donate all profits to a comparable good cause. That would be a classy solution for everyone; Disney, people who like the film and people who could be offended by it.

Though if being `politically' correct is important then Disney should release their WHOLE catalogue on good DVD's, not just 4 (!) as a `Vault Disney' (ironically a proper name...) and 6 (!) Platinum collection. Hello!!!??? Out of the hundreds of the Disney Catalogue???

The rest are bad DVD's or still not available at all!

And then complain that there are so many downloads and bootlegs. Yeah...

Being so correct does not seem to be a priority for Disney as shown before by the release of SOTH on VHS and Laserdisc abroad.

Films are not just `owned' by the company that holds the distribution rights, they are our cultural heritage and should be released in the best possible way, so everyone can enjoy them. THAT is the task of the distributors and that's why a consortium of many companies invented the DVD format.

It also makes me wonder; doesn't the management of Disney want to see their own films on their own plasma screens at home? Do they even like their job or their products?

Also DVD was set up as a standard so we could all enjoy films in with a sharp and anamorphic widescreen picture, digital surround sound and have 29 different languages of subtitles and if available, extra's. Seeing the many, many complaints about many DVD releases we know that studio's are out of line here. Disney, Colombia, Miramax, the French Studio Canal and others.

Besides that it is commercially stupid not to use everything the format has to offer and release as much as possible.

Studios should also be forced by government to ALWAYS include subtitles for the hard of hearing.

by Jim Hill

Complete article:

[...]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I know that it's been a really rough winter so far. But who would have thought that Hell was gonna to freeze over?

""What do I mean by that?,"" you ask. Well, I just got word that Buena Vista Home Entertainment will be releasing ""Song of the South"" on DVD in the Fall of 2006.

That's right. ""Song of the South."" The Academy Award winning film that former Disney Feature Animation head Thomas Schumacher once told Roger Ebert was on ""permanent moratorium"" has reportedly been greenlit for release late next year. A special 60th anniversary edition that -- thanks to a plethora of extra features -- will try & put this somewhat controversial motion picture in historial context.

""Why -- after all these years -- did Disney finally give in?,"" you query. It's simple, really. ""Song of the South"" 's 60th anniversary was simply too good a promotional hook for the Mouse's marketing staff to pass up. More to the point, Buena Vista Home Entertainment could really use a hit right about now.

Don't believe me? Then go check out Disney's financial reports for the first quarter of 2005. Where you'll discover that the Mouse's accountants actually blame the 20% drop in revenue that the company's Studio Entertainment division recently experienced on lower DVD sales of current-year films.

Given that Disneyana fans have been clamoring for a ""Song of the South"" DVD for nearly a decade now, BVHE execs are hoping that all of this pent-up demand will eventually translate in really big sales for this disc. Disney is hoping to sell at least 10-12 million units of this particular motion picture.

""But aren't Disney Company execs concerned about how the African American community may response to 'Song of the South' 's release of DVD?,"" you continue. Yep. I won't lie to you folks. There's a lot of people in the Team Disney Burbank building who are very concerned that -- by releasing this much maligned motion picture on home video & DVD -- that the Mouse House is potentially opening itself up to a ton of bad publicity.

With the hope of avoiding that, BVHE reportedly plans to really pile on the extra features with ""Song of the South."" Among the ideas currently being knocked around is producing a special documentary that -- through use of clips from that TV movie version of Rodgers & Hammerstein's ""Cinderella"" that Disney produced back in 1997 as well as sequences from ""The Proud Family"" & ""That's So Raven"" -- would demonstrate that a person's color really doesn't matter at the modern Walt Disney Company. There's also talk of including Walt Disney Feature Animation's seldom-seen short, ""John Henry,"" as one of the disc's special features.

Buena Vista Home Entertainment is also supoosedly toying with approaching a prominent African-American performer to serve as the MC on the DVD version of ""Song of the South."" You know, someone who could then introduce the film, explain its historical significance as well as re-enforcing the idea that ""SOTS"" was a product of a much less enlightened time in Hollywood's history. I'm told that -- up until recently -- Bill Cosby was actually at the top of Disney's wish list. But now that Dr. Cosby has been accused of inappropriate behavior with several ladies ... Well, let's just say that Bill is no longer Mickey's top choice for this position.

Anywho ... There's one other aspect of this ""Song-of-the-South""-soon-on-on-DVD saga that I guess I should mention. Which is why Buena Vista Home Entertainment is low-balling its predictions of the number of units that ""SOTS"" might sell (I.E. 10-12 million versus ""Finding Nemo"" 's 39 million+ units). Why is that, do you suppose? Mind you, it's not because ""Song of the South"" is decidedly old fashioned (Well, what do you expect from a 60 year-old motion picture?), but rather .... Here, why don't I let my source inside BVHE explain:

""This movie isn't nearly as good as people seem to remember it being. Sure, the animated sequences are charming. But the pace of the rest of the picture is so damned pokey.

Which is why I seriously doubt that we'll get all that many letters about ""Song of the South"" 's racial content. The way I figure it, most kids & adults will be nodding off 30 minutes into the thing. And people who are sleeping can't write letters of complaint.""

Well, I don't know about that. But what I can tell you folks is to stop bidding NOW on those black market ""SOTS"" DVDs that keep popping up on eBay. For -- if you can just wait another 17-18 months -- you can actually purchase a really-for-real authorized version of Disney's ""Song of the South"" of your very own.",1112572800,36,4904,4.867947178871549

Contrary to their claims that Uncle Remus is a belittled slave character in the movie, he is in fact the hero while the Caucasian mother who forbids him to continue telling stories to her young son becomes the villain. It is Uncle Remus that saves the day, and perhaps the life, of the very son that was deprived of the close relationship that he enjoyed with Uncle Remus, who can be viewed as a father figure, especially with the absense of the boy's own father who appears briefly at the beginning of the film and remains absent until its end.

1345553,5,B00004RM2X,"I first saw the movie ""Song of the South"" in 1972 as a child. The movie is one of Disney's finest masterpieces, however due to the movie not being ""politically correct"" it has never been released in the United States. Having grown up in the south myself I can attest to the fact that Disney in no way ""exploits"" the negros, but instead portrays slavery as it really was, an everyday fact of life on the plantation. The story line is warm, telling the story of little Johnny coming  with his mamma to stay on his grandmothers plantation. Upon arrival he is befriended by Uncle Remus and it is through this friendship that he flourishes and thrives. The live action combined with animation is an art masterpiece. The musical score is beautifully done, including the award winning ""Zip A Dee Do Da"" ""Uncle Remus Said"" ""Everybody's Got A Laughing Place"". It is a shame that Michael Eisner has attempted to  take Walt Disney's vision of family entertainment to the level of ""political correctness"" while cowtailing to the left wing liberal organizations who promote such twaddle. For those who would like to voice their opinion go to ""SaveDisney.com"" a website which has been set up by Roy Disney and Stanley Gold to preserve Walt's vision/legacy. As for our family we enjoy the movie as well as the ""Tales of Uncle Remus"". They are part of our nations history and should be treated as such.",1108857600,3,1386,4.699588477366255
1345554,4,B00004RM2X,"""Song of the South"" took place in the...READ...~*POST*~ Civil War U.S.A...many of the slaves in the South were already freed. Which is WHY Uncle Remus is allowed to leave the plantation whenever he feels like. It is in NO way ""Sugar coating"" slavery...in fact, the story's not even ABOUT slavery. It's just about a lonely young boy and how he finds solace in listening to an elderly man's stories about cunning ol' Br'er Rabbit.

In my opinion, the live action parts of this movie aren't really that impressive, with the exception of James Baskett's performance. Excepting for him, a great deal of the other characters in the live action parts lack more than one dimension. The animation segments, however are very nicely done, beautifully animated and worth the effort of releasing a DVD alone.

So forget the naysayers. Forget Eisner. This movie deserves every amount of right to be released as Winnie The Pooh, or any other Disney classic film.

1345558,5,B00004RM2X,"First let me say this, plain, simple, racism is wrong.  Racism is more than just wrong though, it is pure evil.  One should never judge another by the colour of the skin.  One should never make presumptions toward another by the race of that person.  Yes this film could be said to have stereotypical blacks AND whites, but this film is not racism per say.  Simplistic yes, but then again, this is a children's movie, not something you'd see as drama on cable tv.  Unlike most films of today, this film is truly suited for parents and their children.  The stories are important because they have life lessons that any body...no matter how young or old...can learn with a smile and a nod to the head toward wisdom.  Children can laugh out loud with their folks at the humor of rabbit, fox, and bear.  Song of the South is a well developed movie that might yes be showing a simpler time, but at least it shows something descent for those watching...unlike the two examples I am about to give toward what true racism is...

Yes still so many people cry the racism card toward this movie.  I am a firm believer that racism is wicked, but those people calling this movie racism seem to be quite quiet in terms of what is seen in this day and age.  I am about to give two examples of what racism is, in comparison to the Song of the South. Example 1:  I turned on the comedy network the other day, during the day time, during hours that children can easily watch, and there were African American comedians laughing and snickering because they call each other the ""N"" word.  As if the ""N"" word was a joke?  I would like to remind those who use that word so frivolously of the painting by Norman Rockwell of the young African American girl in a white dress being brought to school.  If you know the picture, you know what I mean.  I doubt very seriously she'd say yes if you asked that girl if the ""N"" word was ""funny.""  Example 2:  Grand Theft Auto SA, the latest game in that PS2 series.  This game is not only violent and destructive, it gives a thumbs up toward the life of a gangster--killing other African Americans because they are in other gangs, killing police men (especially white) just because the character's can kill the police, drugs, prostitution, etc. etc.

These two examples are far greater and more important examples of what racism is, and the destructive nature of racism...Songs of the South, on the other hand, is not.  I think that if Disney had any sense in their mind they would put this movie out because this movie is a great movie for all to see.",1104451200,15,2568,4.430703624733476

Joel Chandler Harris lived near Eatonton, Georgia and based the characters on those he knew on a plantation in that area during the Reconstruction Period (i.e. post civil war). His writings comprise the single largest collection of African-American folk stories in existence. Though the collections still exist, Disney has made them fun and understandable for young people who may not be able to read the dialectic writing. There are stereotypes in the movie and Disney does gloss over the hardships of Reconstruction Georgia. However, we do not disparage Disney for how it portrays life during the middle ages, or how it simplifies the stories of the Grimm Bros. which are often horrifying if we go back and read them. Disney is not out there to enlighten the world to the horrors and atrocities of civilization. It provides a welcome and lighthearted relief from them. Another argument could be made for the free speech aspect, but because this is willing self-censorship, I will refrain. It is appalling at how quickly those who censor works of art for fear of offending each other are willing to cast out the essence of what makes themselves unique. Heed Cato: ""Those who know not their history are doomed to repeat it."" Book burners beware!

By the way, classism exists today in the south just as it did during Reconstruction. As the grandson of a white sharecropper, I urge the teaching of the ignorances and prejudices of the past so that we may finally overcome them. This movie should be rereleased not only for the superb artistry and entertainment value, but also as a teaching mechanism for our youth. Do not use it to babysit your children, rather make it an educational experience and teach them, they too will grow up to ask questions.

One aspect of the film that many people do not seem to notice is that the film is set in the POST Civil War era.  Neither Uncle Remus, nor any of the other people in the film are ""slaves"".  They are FREE citizens, to come and go as they please, as demonstrated when Uncle Remus decides to leave his home, for personal reasons, just as the father in the story leaves home for his own reasons.

Although there are slight references to when the mother of the young children in the film was a child herself, probably when Uncle Remus and others were slaves, this film has gotten an ill-deserved bad rap.  There was slavery until 1864, and that is a sad fact.  When we try to deny the ugly and evil parts of History, we lose, alas, the good and beautiful parts as well. The Joel Chandler Harris stories are so wonderfully wrought, and beautifully and morally depicted in the animated portions of the film that I seriously doubt that the rest of the movie would make much imprint on very young children, although it is suitable for those who understand it.

When one compares this classic and much revered film with the filth and effluvia presented to children today, even by Disney, ""Song of The South"" is still the winner after all the years, and after all the attempts by Disney to sweep it under the rug, as if the film was a mistake.

1345578,4,B00004RM2X,"In their overzealous attempt to be PC, Disney has created a thriving ""underground/black market"" for this movie.  It has been released in Europe in PAL VHS format, in Japan on laser disc, and most recently overseas on DVD.  At legitimate auction sites people are paying into the hundreds of $$ for the DVD.  How rediculous!  All necessitated by a company who is wrapped up in a PC bravado that is belied by the release of the motion picture everywhere but the US.

What is Disney trying to hide?  That there was slavery in this country?  That there was and is inequality?  That they made a movie in 1946 that might be deemed offensive in 2004?  By not releasing the movie, do they hope to ignore or perhaps rewrite history?  This from a company with an ""out-of-the-closet"" agenda that is barely disguised.  Apparently it is more PC to promote that agenda to our children than to let history stand for what it is, and open doors of dialog about racial equality and pluralism.

Based on Disney's current stance about Song of the South, we have to ask the question what would happen to ""Roots"" if Disney owned the rights to it?  How about ""The Houlocost?""  Maybe by never releasing that movie on DVD, we could erase the entire history of WWII, or make Jewish people forget what their ancestors went through.

Then there's the question of why release the movie at all?  If it's that offensive, then why be hypocritical about it?  That part is obvious - because they can make money on it.

I'm offended that my 4th grade son came asking me to buy it for him today, and I had to explain to him that Disney won't release it for him to see the way I saw it twice as a kid.

The politically correct pundits love to tell the rest of us that we must accept what they consider entertainment (have you listened to the current music or watched a network TV show lately?). It's freedom of expression, they say, no matter what the subject matter or language usage. But when something comes along (or has been around for 60 years, as is the case for 'Song of the South'), that does not fit what they consider suitable, well, they're the first to censor what they deem to be offensive.

Unfortunately, not one dime of what I spent went into the Disney coffers.

Now I know Disney definitely frowns upon these unauthorized versions of its movie, but its refusal to release Song of the South itself, despite the requests and demands of thousands and thousands of people, only encourages their proliferation.

I live in Florida and my children and I have been to Disney World numerous times, they have a very popular ride called Splash Mountain that they put in only a few years ago and the whole theme of the ride is The Song of the South which is meaningless to anyone under under 25-30 because they have never seen the movie, it makes no sense at all. Why is it that some people always find something negative and never see the positive. If anything this film was way ahead of its time showing the colorblindness of a well to do, young white boy and how someone's color (Uncle Remus) or social status (Ginny) is not what a person should be judged by. As Martin Luther King said ""Judge me not by the color of my skin but by the content of my character."" I believe that is what this whole movie is about, the wonderful relationship between a little boy from a broken home and a wise old man who has survived the bondages of slavery and can still find joy and beauty in the world and shares his wisdom with that troubled little boy. If there was ever a time to release this movie, now is that time.",1090627200,42,1661,4.098159509202454

Flight of the Navigator was never edited for political correctness and I hope this one won't either be edited. This movie contains stories and songs of Brer Rabbit. Also Bobby Driscoll was super cute and endearing in this film. I think he was a great asset to all of Walt Disney's films.

A white family runs a plantation and is of course helped by black slaves. At least the owners and the slaves are a little like friends, the hierarchy is not very big although of course the white owners can tell them what to do.
It is mostly the story of the folk-hero Uncle Remus telling folk tales to a little white boy who is enamoured by them. The stories he tells are the animations, which is a nice twist. The songs are also very good to listen to.

Kids today need some of the old Disney, and this was and is

in our history. Kids do need to have fun, and there are lessons

If that's not a role model for kids, I don't know WHAT is.
Disney may have felt reluctant to release this film due to pressure from some members of the African-American community.

I thought this movie was a delight.  Disney's best movie? No - it was extremely sappy in parts which got annoying and cloying, but I definitely enjoyed watching it.

How can a movie, that has only been held up by Disney, be Politically Incorrect, but an entire ride at the Disney Theam Parks based soley on the Movie is good fun.  By the way, not only has Eisiner been the controlling force to keep the movie from being released in the US, but the gentleman who played Ramus and his children have been tied up in courts for years trying to get the movie released.

There is a scene which shows black folks going home on a plantation but that is part of American history and I believe was not shown to offend anyone. The movie Parrish starring Troy Donahue shows both white and black people working on a tobacco plantation. This movie also shows respect between black and white people, so I can see nothing offending in this movie.

Yes slavery was wrong but what isn't nowaydays. We all must put the events of the past behind us, and look towards a brighter future.

The point I am trying to convey is that this movie should teach white people how stupid they were.  Our ancestors or not.  What the main point is here is that children see no color and having studied prejudice for years I have confirmed what other studies have shown. It is all learned from adults.
I have put my children in situations to prove this and I have protected them from any idea that people are different because their skin color. All in the Family is still in reruns but it is ok to show Archie Bunker because it is supposed to be understood that he is not so smart. If South Park can be accessible to my childen why can't  something as educational as Song of the South be available.

The story line certainly conveys good values and this movie has one of the very best Disney musical scores ever. The film has a captivating and timeless quality, even after all these years.
Unlike what some uninformed persons indicate, ""Song of the South"" takes place in the Reconstruction era of the Old South (1870's-1880's), and the black people (and many whites) were sharecroppers during that period. This is indeed *not* a film depicting slavery!
It is not all that difficult to obtain unlicensed copies, from what I hear <ahem>, but bootlegged copies are of inferior quality, not to mention the fact that they are not legitimate. (Legal home video editions have been available in Europe and Japan for years!)

1345614,2,B00004RM2X,"From reading only a few of the over two hundred reviews on this unreleased movie, I may be the only one who has seen the movie this century and not within distant childhood memory.  I took two of my young children to see the movie last year at Mary Washington College.  It was a special showing for educational purposes that mostly included members of the community and a few students.  The showing was from a Japanese video where it has been distributed in English with Japanese subtitles.
Myself, the audience, and my children thoroughly enjoyed the Zip a Dee Do Da song, the mixture of animation with live actors, and the Brer Rabbit stories.  The children still talk about those parts of the movie now several months later.  However, the overall quality of the movie and the story are not as one might be led to believe.
The acting of several adult characters is rather poor (except for the actor playing Uncle Remus) and at times laughable (especially the mother of the main child).  The main character's parents have a rift in their marriage and the father is involved in some unspoken problem that is the reason the family is staying at the plantation.  Also, there is an ambiguous death scene and class hostility among the whites.
The movie is actually without reference to whether the time involves slavery or post slavery.  I think the time is post war, and the former slaves are farming the land for the plantation owner.  While some who have written reviews may remember the characterizations as mostly harmless, many of the characters and their situations were troubling to observe.  For example, white children are shown bossing black adults with the black adults weakly submitting to these children.  The Uncle Remus character is highly fearful of offending any of the white characters and his place in the plantation is anything but secure.  Also, there are the scenes of the smiling blacks laughing and singing after work as if every day were Sunday and they had no labor with plenty of food in their stomachs.
Overall, I would not oppose the film's release, but Disney should not be condemned for refusing to do so.  Contrary to popular belief, the film was not a financial success at the time of original release.  And those who are recalling the film after decades of having first seen it, are likely doing so with faulty memory.

1345617,5,B00004RM2X,"The reason people want to discuss the banning of SONG OF THE SOUTH isn't only because it is a Disney classic. In America, we are constantly trying to right the wrongs in this country. A few executives at Disney decide to prevent audiences from watching a popular 1946 family classic because 'they' find it offensive. This isn't unlike a publisher who has little affection for controversial authors like Mark Twain ('Huckleberry Finn), James Joyce ('Ulysses') and Henry Miller ('The Tropic of Cancer'), and thereby decides not to print these authors simply because he has ownership of their materials, and he can. But it doesn't mean he is right. Luckily these authors are not being banned today, but there is still this case surrounding SONG OF THE SOUTH.
The United States is made up of various religious beliefs and cultures. We are a great country because we are free to express ourselves. The makers of SONG OF THE SOUTH made this film way back in 1946 for a company run by a man who himself preferred not to offend audiences, even at risk of alienating them by not showing them reality. Instead of portraying the post-Civil War days the way it really was, his idea was to entertain people. Walt Disney was a master showman. In SOTS, he throws out much of the pain and suffering. His view on life, at least within his empire, was pure and simple (Disney-fied). SOTS sugar-coats that day in history after the Civil War. But does this mean the movie should be banned? Some of today's critics watch SOTS and are deeply offended. But why should they be? SOTS is not trying to be a history lesson, just as GONE WITH THE WIND doesn't pretend to be. Where are GWTW's critics?
Americans should be allowed to make up their own minds as to the controversy of this film. The Disney Company has a right to disown SONG OF THE SOUTH if they want, but that doesn't mean their choice is right.",1072742400,7,1881,4.601190476190476

1345620,5,B00004RM2X,"I'm pleased to see all the customer reviews praising Walt Disney's 1946 Technicolor feature ""Song of the South"", and I want to add my support for its (hopefully soon) transfer to DVD. This is one of Disney's most engaging movies and one of the first (perhaps the first -- references are a little vague) to combine animation with live action, a process which TV commercials have made as common as soapy dishwater. The 57-year old technology here is remarkably sophisticated, the ""toons"" often sharing the screen with the live actors. As a matter of fact, there are two directorial credits, Wilfred Jackson for animation and Harve Foster for live-action. (Evidently, Uncle Walt really had  little to do with this production.) Based on the Uncle Remus stories by Joel Chandler Harris (1848-1908), the plot is simple and sentimental: a little Southern boy travels with his parents to visit his grandmother only to learn that his father is moving on. Feeling hurt and lonely, Johnny accepts Uncle Remus, a middle-aged black man, as his father-figure friend and, from him, hears the adventures of clever Br'er Rabbit, malicious Br'er Fox, and dumb really dumb Br'er Bear. (""Br'er"" was the 19th Century equivalent of ""Bro"".) The earnest child star Bobby Driscoll plays Johnny, the sensitive James Baskett plays Uncle Remus (he was given a special Oscar), and their rapport is perfectly presented. What the racial discrimination or degradation or whatever is all about leaves me completely flummoxed. Obviously, the black characters are not slaves (judging from the costumes, the story takes place in the 1870's or 1880's), and all of them are depicted as warm and intelligent. I suspect many people object to the original Harris stories, written in a heavy dialect, rather than to the movie itself. (Incidently, the film's working title was ""Uncle Remus"".)  The censure of unpleasant stereotypes could much easier be aimed at ""Gone With the Wind"", what with the hysterically inane Prissy and the black potential robber/rapist in the Shantytown sequence. (""Song of the South"" shares several elements with ""GWTW"", not the least of which is Hattie McDaniel tracing her Mammy performance.) The story's ""villains"" are two trailer-trash white boys who are the live-action approximations of Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear. Aristocratic-looking Ruth Warrick (who played Charles Foster Kane's first wife) is Johnny's mother, and if the character seems a little cold one assumes it's because she's going through a bad time with her marriage -- not to mention dealing with her mother, the tiresome Lucile Watson. This being a Disney picture, there is a Broadwayish score including the Oscar-winning ""Zip a Dee Doo Dah"" and a playful ballad ""Sooner or Later (You're Going to Be Coming Around)"", which Hattie McDaniel sings while baking pies. When this song was popularized the lyric ""want my cookin' again"" was changed to ""want my lovin' again"", and there's just the slightest hint that the Hattie McDaniel character and Uncle Remus have had a ""thing"". Altogether, ""Song of the South"" is beautifully realized, Americana at its most charming, and to deny it DVD status is sort of like denying Br'er Rabbit his brier patch. DVD is just where it belongs.",1069632000,28,3226,5.11954459203036

I think it's sad that Disney has forced a movie with history into a vault never to be seen again!  The African-American's told wonderful tales with music that is still a rich part of their culture, same with the Native-Americans.  Who has the right to deny us history?  Slavery happened and we cannot go back in time to change it and to deny the truths of our past is criminal.  How can we change in a positive manner if we and our children are not exposed to books and films that depict what our country and its people were part of?  If Disney is so ashamed of producing this movie then why do we still have characters and music in Splash Mountain,such as Brer Rabbit, as a part of the ride?  Why did they release a Sing-Along, Zip-a-dee-doo-dah for children to ask,""where did the songs and all the characters came from?""  I am an avid collector of Disney animation and would love to have Song of the South as part of my collection.  This is a classic!  No one has the right to censor classics that are full of beauty,love and friendship between a slave and a young boy.  If Disney is going to censor movies than they need to remove some of the garbage that is on tv and certain movies that are released from their sister companies.....This was one of the first Disney released films.

Though it was extremely costly, it was well worth every penny spent, not to mention the only way I could get a legitimate/legal copy of this great masterpiece.  Though Disney had produced several short films using live action and animation, this movie represents Disney's first major effort at combining the two.  Though the movie presents a view of the post-Civil War era, which some find distasteful, it more importantly provides a visual telling of The Tales of Uncle Remus as only Walt Disney could have done.  These stories were once only passed on by word of mouth through generations of African slaves until pen was taken to paper to record them by Joel Chandler Harris in 1878. I am tired of Disney coddling and cowering to the Black Community who uses those rights granted to us under the Constitution when it serves their purpose, yet opposes them when it serves the purpose of others.  This makes them hypocrites.  If they had their way, many movies and literary works (e.g. Gone With the Wind, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, etc...) would no longer be available and lost to the populace.  No one person or group should have the power to dictate what another views or reads, or for that matter, what one can say or write.  Disney should release this movie on DVD as it is a marvelous groundbreaking piece of work that all should have the opportunity to view, and if one does not care for it, then they should not buy it.",1062201600,11,1596,4.675

As a child I sat at the feet of Uncle Remus (wonderfully brought to life by James Baskett, sadly no longer with us) with Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten and got happily lost in the stories he told. I haven't seen this wonderful slice of Americana in many years, due to some unfortunate misperceptions about political correctness and views of raacism, which, BTW; it has none. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder; the same is true of racism. In Orwell's world there existed the thought police and any events, albeit even historical ones, which were not viewed as good for the state, were removed from the national consciousness; we must not let this happen to SOTS. Children love this story and the great, finely drawn characters and the unparallelled storytelling of Joel Chandler Harris. When combined with the classic Disney animation of the time, it is truly a unique work and one which should be available to all generations, especially those coming up now. It is a magical tale, filled with great characters, and taken from old folk tales of the Old South, now long gone, but brought back to life in this masterpiece. There was never any racist thought, reference or word which would disallow this work from being readily available; all is misperception by those who see wolves behind every tree and would erase this historical and wonderful tale of times long past in favor of the demands of political correctness. When we stand by and allow others to make decisions for us, we are always the loser, and hopefully, public demand wil bring this Disney classic back to the public, where it belongs.

Disney struck pure gold with the casting of 42 year old former B-movie actor, James Baskett, in the first live role ever cast, the wise, worldly, folksy and kind-hearted Uncle Remus, and the voice talent for Brer Fox.
Comforting Jonny, a lonely little boy adrift on his grandmother's plantation in Georgia, Uncle Remus seeks to guide the lad through a series of tall tales featuring Brer Rabbit and the Briar Patch, the Laughing Place and more.
The animated stories are engagingly drawn and are small moral pieces, much like another country's Aesop Fables. These are spoken in a drawling dialect popular in the old South of slaves, freed slaves and spoken word history.
This 1946 movie has the same sort of racial stereotyping as another film classic, Gone With The Wind, and even reprises GWTW's role of Mammy, (Hattie McDaniel), here in the person of Aunt Tempie, the seemingly gruff cook with a heart of pure gold.
Looking beyond those somewhat caricatured roles, is the moving story of people cast together in the earliest days of Reconstruction, following the Civil War. The soundtrack is excellent, with gospel spirituals side by side ditties by Johnny Lee, (voice of Brer Rabbit) and the surprisingly good Baskett.
Foremost among these songs, is the rightly Academy Award winning theme song, Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah, with Uncle Remus giving full and joyous voice to the fact ""...there's a bluebird on my shoulder. It's the truth, it's actual, Everything's so satisfactual.""
A genuine slice of classic Americana, there is nothing quite like Uncle Remus, the smartest, most down-to-earth person on the Georgia plantation of Disney's imagineering, going 1 on 1 with a few of the more small-minded employers and worthless neiborhood bullies.
Disney and Buena Vista Distributing really need to make this movie available to all viewers, everywhere. To be sure, the dated, and politically incorrect stereotypes need to be addressed when viewing this film with children and yoong adults.
Disney made bold strides when conceiving, filming and releasing this classic but it now needs a proper U.S. release, so everyone can enjoy the Award winning performance of Baskett, Brer Rabbit and company.",1026950400,27,2663,5.23887587822014

1345658,4,B00004RM2X,"I liked this movie when I was a kid, and having viewed it again last night I don't know what the fuss is about.  I found it to be entertaining for the kids, and much more benign than some of the garbage Disney has produced under it's other labels (ABC, Touchstone, etc.).  And here's a novel suggestion for those worried about it corrupting the minds or their kids...watch it WITH them and talk to them about it afterwards.
Yeah, I feel like Disney caved on this one.  But the BRAND IMAGE is EVERYTHING for a company like Disney, and they wouldn't risk tarnishing that wholesome family image for the relatively insignificant revenues this release would generate.  That's just bad business, and the kind of thing that costs senior managers their jobs.
Disney didn't shelve this out of respect or taste or anything of the kind (don't forget this is the same company, through its ABC subsidiary, that brought us such ""tasteful"" shows as ""The Chair"" and ""The Bachelor"").  The bottom line is they wanted to avoid any potential contraversy that might tarnish the Disney brand and hurt revenues on it's blockbuster films and theme parks.
They're perfectly entitled to protect a brand they've spent a great deal of money marketing.  But let's call it what it is - a huge multinational corporation making decisions that it feels will optimize shareholder revenues and make the Disney entertainment empire not such a ""small world after all"".  CEOs get payed for increasing earnings/share, and that's what this and all decisions ultimately boil down to.

I grew up in a time when no one analyzed to death the 'politically correct' insanity of nearly everything on the airwaves.
If Song of the South is 'politically and socially inept' ... then why are re-runs of such shows from the 70's: 'Sanford & Son'; 'All in the Family'; 'The Jefferson's'; M*A*S*H; etc .... being left out of the argument of what's 'appropriate' to release when at any given time more violence and sexual content goes into PG-13 movies now than ever before??

1345661,4,B00004RM2X,"O.K., enough already. Several comments regarding this movie (most, but not all from those who argue it should be censored, ergo not released again by Disney in any form) contain erroneous so-called ""facts"" about the movie. Here is the truth:

There are NO slave characters in the film. Several comments about this movie go on and on about it containing ""slaves."" Wrong, wrong, WRONG. The movie is set AFTER the civil war. That is fact. The African Americans at Miss Doshy's plantation are working employees, NOT slaves. Yes, the film is set during the Jim Crow era, and yes, one can obviously argue that the quality of life (in terms of housing and education in particular) of the African Americans shown was not much better than that of pre Civil War slaves.  But to identify the the African Americans in Song of the South as ""slaves"" (and to therefore imply they are chained, whipped and ordered around by nasty white ""owners"" is absolutely ridiculous. Are there one or two situations in the film where an African American shows a certain level of ""servitude"" to a ""white manager""? Yes, but to define that as ""slavery"" is simplistic, erroneous spin.

The words ""massa"" is never used by anyone, much less Uncle Remus. I've seen several discussions about Song of the South containing comments to that effect, which state or imply African Americans in the film refer to the whites as ""massa."" That is completely false. That term is NEVER heard anywhere in the entire 93 minute film.

Uncle Tom is NOT ""ignorant."" He is defined or implied to be that way in several comments. Why, I don't know, but how anyone can sit through this wonderful film and be completely ignorant of the intelligence, compassion and common sense shown by the Uncle Remus character (at a level frankly higher than that of any white character in the film) is completely beyond me.

As for the general PC argument that the movie ""sugar-coats"" a ""sad period"" in African America History, what's next?  Is the PC crowd going to also demand a ban on ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Showboat"" (two films that also contain ""Old South style"" black characters) that are currently readily available for viewing?  Thankfully, I don't yet see any ""it isn't PC, ban it"" comments on the Amazon reviews of those films, which leaves me wondering: why does the PC crowd -- which seemingly views the former movies as benign and acceptable -- find so ""frightening"" about Song of the South?  I sense that seeming hypocrisy has something to do with a fear of Disney's appeal to children, but heaven only knows.

Bottom line: the minority that attacks Song of the South (and is trying to bully Disney into burying it forever) is running with a political agenda, one that depends upon on your buying spin and erroneous ""fact."" Don't fall for that - it's a classic film that overall provides a positive message to any honest viewer with an open mind.",1023148800,,2891,4.743027888446215
1345662,5,B00004RM2X,"After reading a few of these reviews, I think it is time to set the record straight.  I got a PAL copy of this movie and have watched it recently, after not seeing it for years and, being a history teacher, there are just some assumptions going on out there that simply aren't true.
First, the African-Americans depicted in the movie are NOT slaves.  The most likely role these people play is share cropers on the plantation.  Case in point:  Uncle Remus is told to leave and leaves by his own free will - he is not sold.  This would have not occured during slave times.
Indeed, the main division in this film is not by race but by class.  The poor white family is treated the same as the African-Americans and appear to live under the same conditions.
An older, single widowed woman during these times would have needed share cropers to keep the plantation opperating, trading use of a small parcel of land for work on the plantation.  This is an arrangement that was very common in the south among both African-Americans and poor whites for many, many years after the Civil War.
To say that this movie depicts slavery as a ""happy time"" is simply incorrect as it is clear that there are no slaves in this movie.",1022976000,11,1212,4.457013574660634
1345663,3,B00004RM2X,"The many reviewers who have said ""history is history, get over it"" and have accused opponents of being too PC and oversensitive, have misunderstood Disney's reasons for not releasing this movie. Disney didn't decide to withhold this movie because the ""history"" in it might offend people. They are withholding it because it distorts history. Sure, it's set right after slavery has been abolished, but its portrayal of a peaceful life on the Southern plantation of blacks who decided to stay is unrealistic and gives the idea that slavery must not have been so bad--look how happy they were afterwards and how they just loved staying and serving those nice white folks and their open minded children. Unfortunately that is not how it was for the great majority of former slaves still living in the South after the Civil War. The distortion is what is offensive, not the ""history.""
The animated sequences are great, but the live action is something Disney can't responsibly uphold. I don't want to give my children a sugar-coated version of grim parts of our nation and race's not-so-distant past. To do so would be an injustice to all who have suffered because of slavery. My hope is that Disney will release the animated sections with some new live action scenes of Uncle Remus the way he was portrayed in the books, and in a neutral setting rather than a historical one.",1021593600,9,1370,4.834042553191489

The young boy's decision to spend time with the people he felt most comfortable with appealed to us, although we were probably too young to understand what we liked about it.  Slavery was / is / and always will be an abominable institution, but it happened and to be able to build a positive story around such a regrettable time in man's history is one of the reasons why Walt Disney and ""Song Of The South"" are such lasting icons.

This film is an artifact of a time when the United States was an apartheid country.  The glory is that most Americans have moved far beyond that time and those beliefs.  It certainly would have been interesting (and could be for a future version) to see slavery depicted in a truer light, and to have the stories put into their historical context, but the film probably wouldn't have found an audience.
To me, this film is a paradox.  It's wrong, but it has HEART.  I still get teary at the ending.  I love the animation.  I love the songs.  I love the stories.  I love Uncle Remus.  I love the happy Darkies singing their songs.  The fundamental humanity of the characters transcends the stereotypical representation of their status.  Indeed, the image of a black man with wisdom, warmth and heart presents a more positive image than what we get from a lot of more contemporary, and presumably ""correct"" films.

Taking the good with the bad: An analysis of racism in Song of the South
Note: I tried to be vague, not giving away any plot points, but there may be some spoilers...
I think it is a shame that a great movie with so many classic moments has been lost on a generation. I find it obscene that people can't look at both the good and the bad when analyzing this movie. All in all, it's a very positive movie.
Yes, there are ""ignorant slaves"". Yes, there is a white supremist air with certain characters and themes. However, 3 key points are lost on people...
1) The children ignore the race barrier. This is the key to the movie. In spite of certain stereotypes, the kids didn't care. They played together as equals. The only time you saw inequity was when an adult addressed the issue.
2) In the end, when all was said and done, Uncle Remus was not only the hero, but also the one who showed everyone appearances can be deceiving. It was his ""so-called"" nonsense and stories that united everyone, and his love for others and the love for him that won in the end. He was the one that saw the problem, knew what needed to be done, and went and did it. Not the boy's mom, grandma, or any other real family member. It was this ""ignorant slave"". In the end, it was his actions that gained him acceptance and the rejection by the adults were dismissed.
3) Also, did anyone care to notice that the boy's father always had a great respect for Uncle Remus? While other adults dismissed Uncle Remus, the father had grown with him as a boy, and remembered that this loveable man brought him joy and showed him the beauty of life.
Yes, it was a different time back then. Yes, certain stereotypes were more acceptable then than now. But in spite of all of it, the message in the end is positive, and bridges the barrier between the races. Isn't that the point? The path may be dark by today's standards, but it's the message at the end we walk away with.
It is a shame that pressure from groups like the NAACP and others see fit to pressure Disney to suppress this movie in the US. I think if this movie was truly as racist as people claim, it wouldn't even have made it to be released everywhere else in the world.
I can think of a dozen other movies that contained much more racist characters without the benefit of a positive message that are in general release today. Even that great classic ""Showboat"" has similar elements of racism, and that is one of the most widely available musicals, although once again, there was some positive with the negative there.
OK. The ""Tar Baby"" is a potential hot point. I won't say the movie was perfect, but again, which is more important... The conclusion, or the path you take? I think most would agree that the conclusion is the most important point. May Disney find it in their collective corporate wisdom to release this movie again.",1015459200,13,2932,4.381651376146789

Walt Disney made this movie with the story set after the Civil War. What's the problem? Well, Uncle Remus still looks like a happy slave and that's racist. Well, what do you expect in this movie, a Nat Turner? Yes, slavery is wrong. Hey, every tribe of man engaged in it one time or the other. We are created equal in that sense. The Mark Ferman isn't used in this movie, the servants aren't whip. This movie isn't a doucmentary of slavery. It tells the loving story of a relationship between a boy and servant. The servant becomes a father figure (does that sound like Mark Twain's Jim and Huck?). In one moving scene, the boy holds hands for Uncle Remus and become his eyes. Listen, slavery is wrong, but all slaveholders and their slaves are dead. They are in hands of a just God. Justice will be served. To deny this movie to a fellow human is morally wrong. Judge not lest thou shalt be judged. The actor who protrayed Uncle Remus received a special oscar for his work, but he wasn't at the show in Atlanta. No hotels would admit him.

Only researching the film now do I realize it was about happy slaves and the good old pre-Civil War South - the type of thing that makes me unable to watch with any patience and self-respect ""classics"" like Gone with the Wind.
I understand that people look back fondly on this movie.  But looking over the reviews, I respect only the people who simply stated that they liked it and it should be brought back.  Any time people tried to argue why it's safe or inoffensive, they revealed their own ignorance.  You cannot argue that a movie structured around black stereotypes (and happy old Uncle Remus would be a stereotye even if he wasn't a slave) is not racist.  By saying things like ""slavery existed, it's part of the past"", you miss the point.  No one's mad at this film for featuring slaves in it.  Some crazies have even wrote things like ""it doesn't have the n-word"".
May it be said once and for all that this movie is considered racist for its ignorant patronizing view of black people and its romanticizing one of the most horrible periods in our history.  Disney made a symbolic move by disowning the film; it said, ""we recognize this film, directed at children, reinforces hurtful ideas and we're going to be sensitive to that"".  If you want to argue against their decistion, that's cool; you may have a point.

It combined live-action with animation [one of the first films to do so] and nearly every element of this film works. The acting is what gets the most attention from me. Bobby Driscoll and Luana Patten were discovered by Walt Disney himself, and he signed them to contracts. And thank God he did! Driscoll and Patten are two of the most attractive, appealing, and refreshing child actors I've ever seen. They seem to act natural with their dialogue and expressions, and they don't leave a bad taste in viewers' mouths. That's how good they are. James Baskett is ideal as Uncle Remus, and he's also funny at times. Hattie McDaniel is in this movie, too, and she's always good. The animated sequences themselves are joyous and fun.

I had all the classic animated features except this one. I also grew up on Disney Sing Along videos and had the Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah one. So i have known the songs since age 4! My family also takes trips to Disneyworld every year and we love Splash Mountain. I had always heard that Disney would not release this film on video/dvd because of racial material. I was at a comic convention the other day and bought a copy of the film converted into vhs. The sound isn't good but it dosen't distract from the brillance of the film. I couldn't find a racist part in the whole movie! On the plantation, there are many black people, but they are never refered to as slaves and they are not treated in cruel manners. They are spoken to by white people in a way with respect. The only black person ever seen working is the cook and she is happy and singing a song! If you didn't know your history, you would swear that it was just a village with a lot of black people. And the story is very good. It's about a young boy who's parents clearly are seperating (although they are never shown fighting). His father leavs his mother and him at his grandma's plantation and the dad goes back home leaving the boy heartbroken. He makes friends with a little black boy and a girl who's two older brothers bully her around. But what really helps him get through tough times are the stories told by Uncle Remus about Brear Rabbit and all the conflicts he come across. When the boys mother decides that the stories are giving the boy the wrong ideas and forbids Uncle Remus to see the boy, It'll take his parents to reunite to help him recover from a tragic accident. The songs are amazing. The film is rated G and I feel Disney is robbing us by not releasing it. Pretty soon, Disney will find that people are buying these illegal copies and will be out of money when they do release it because everyone will have bought a copy. Disney should act fast. I hear that their video department is losing money and hope that Show White sales will bring them out of their slump, but if it's not enough, they could make a ton of money off this.

This film shows the interaction of two cultures and how they created a world that is now gone with the wind, that was the song of the South.
Providentially, slavery was smitten from the land of the South, but unfortunately we have forgotten the good relationships that existed between the races in this time.  Uncle Remus is a kind and benevolent, elderly man who helps a young man better to understand the tragic world in which he lives, by offering him hope through story telling.  Please Disney, offer the people the same hope by allowing Americans today to view this story in order that they might better understand themselves, and their relations with other races.

1345707,2,B00004RM2X,"I happen to own a copy of SoS on Laserdisc.  While the movie is okay, it isn't the blockbuster most people draw it out to be.  The acting is mostly subpar and the animation isn't much better.  I question whether most people who purport seeing the movie actually have seen it, and if they have if they have REAL memories of it or imagined ones.  I too grew up singing Zip-a-Dee-Do-Dah, but I learned it from a book and tape set, not the movie, as I suspect 85% of the people on this forum have.
The thing is, Disney is trying to self police itself.  And it has a legal right to do so since they own the copyright to SoS.  Just as they butchered Three Caballeros and Aladdin, they must do the same to Song of the South before it is deemed acceptable for release.  A scene of Goofy smoking was removed from TC, and Aladdin had a song modified and a brief graphical depiction of an ear being chopped off removed.  Imagine what they'd have to do to Song of the South.
While the slavery aspect of the movie is not overbearing, and quite frankly, there is nothing derogatory or hurtful in the depiction of the slavery, the issues come to bear when you see the young boys black playmate and the interactions with the nanny and the boys mother.  Even when uncle remus has to enter the farm house you get the tension of what it was like to be black in early America.  Add to this graphics scenes of violence with a pinch of racist depiction, and you have a winner for the chopping block.  Unfortunately for Disney to correctly fix this movie to stand up to the high quality standards, the movie would be little if nothing.
The movie itself is not all fun and animation, so those of you out there reading up on Brer rabbit, brer bear and brer fox, you're only getting 1/3 the story of Song of the South.  The bulk of the movie is a dry back story in which small snippets of animated morays are inserted.
Probably the most offensive part of this film (and one I would probably consider holding this film back from children), is the debasement of women as demonstrated by the boy's father when he sends away his wife and child to the farm house.
At any rate, the film is at best mediocre, and I don't think the community as a whole is really missing out on not having this film.  That being said, I wouldn't mind owning this film on DVD, but it really wouldn't benefit from a DVD transfer since the audio track is clearly (and boldly) mono and the picture...well even with the recent cleanup (1998-99) of the film for UK video purchasers, the film is still ultra-grainy and obviously dated.
A VHS copy would be equally suitable.

I have heard that Disney will never release this in the States because of the controversy of the subject matter.  That really bothers and distrubes me.

When I watched this movie on TV with my late father, he cried. The old Remus stories were familiar to him, and the story is touching--cynics, don't bother.
Originally, this must have been Disney's answer to ""Gone with the Wind""--it even stars the Oscar-winning Hattie McDaniel.
This is a textbook example of Disney's capricious releasing policy which I'll never understand. They sit on perhaps the most valuable movie archive in the world, and are extremely stingy in their offerings. (All non-USA DVDs of ""Lady and the Tramp"" were pan-and-scan, not Cinemascope. The reason escapes me.)
I do not think the ""will release, will not..."" policy is directly dictated by PC pressure groups. Instead, it most probably is just Disney's self-censorship. A parallel: when the complete works of the comic book artist, Carl Barks, were published, some earlier characters were clumsily retouched to appear less ""stereotypical."" What I mean is this: had it been a DC comic, this wouldn't have happened.
Under the new management, Disney is obviously extremely afraid of criticism from pressure groups (as if everyone weren't able to see it's not a new movie and tells about another period.) But when their ""grownup"" company Touchstone started, one of the first movies was about a prostitute (""Pretty Woman"".) And whoever decided that a new cartoon feature should be released each year, was in error. ""Hercules"" goes to show what can be done in such a short time. I also recall some of the new bosses say there's no longer a market for wholesome family films. A glance at zShops or eBay disproves that claim immediately.
What a relief it is to see that they have a remote intention to release this timeless gem on DVD. The new generation will surely appreciate how the children learn wisdom from the old man--nothing offensive about that. And the animation is wonderful; the music one of the best (assisted by the great Daniele Amfitheatrof.)

1345733,5,B00004RM2X,"Song of the South was one of Disney's first experiments combining live actors with animated action - and it suceeds admirably.
It's a shame that the studio is reluctant to release the film to home audiences based on  'social pressure' and 'offensive content'. Frankly, there is nothing  offensive in it.
It's the story of a poor little rich boy - from Atlanta,  GA, who goes to the country in the company of his mother to stay with his  Grandmother for a time. While there, he befriends a old black story-teller,  Uncle Remus (a slave?) and is captivated by the man's moralistic tales of  Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox and Brer Bear.
Each of Uncle Remus' stories are  well presented by short animations featuring the characters mentioned  above.
The boys mother takes exception with the old man filling her son's  head 'full of nonsense' and forbids both to see each other any longer.  Defying his parent, the lad seeks out his black mentor only to find that  he's left his shack and is moving on. Crying out in loss, he chases after  Uncle Remus and cuts across a field containing a fierce bull and is  subsequently injured.
The tale is truly touching as Johnny (the young  boy) lies seriously ill in bed, unable (or unwilling) to respond to either  his mother or his father (who hastened back to be at his son's side), but  comes around when Uncle Remus is brought to his bedside.
This is a story  of friendship and bridging social/racial gaps, and is as relevent today as  when it was made. Currently it is only available outside the U.S. or dubbed  from PAL tapes. If if becomes available here in the United States, this is  a definate must for your Disney collection. Watch it with your  children.

My children need to enjoy such wisdom in a medium that is  full of fun, singing, and color.  I don't think they get this from  Poke'mon, Digimon, or Power Rangers.  Please bring this movie back.",954979200,27,490,4.415730337078652

I WOULD LOVE FOR MY OWN CHILD TO ENJOY TO THE LIGHT HEARTEDNESS  OF THIS MOVIE.",954979200,17,312,4.310344827586207

1345756,5,B00004RM2X,"When I first saw this film as a child, I loved the animated sequences so much that I remembered them clearly for years. I was fortunate to get a copy on a Japanese laserdisc several years ago, and it's a shame that  Disney doesn't release this film to the public. The most offensive thing  about this film is probably the weird post-Civil War plantation with slaves  (ex-slaves?) still happily working away in the fields. Uncle Remus himself,  played by James Basket (also the voice of Brer Fox), is one of the most  likable human characters ever in a Disney film, and probably the only human  you will like in this film, in my opinion. Despite his dialect, he is not  shown in a derogatory or condescending manner at all, which is unique for  an African-American in a movie made in 1946. The animation itself is simply  amazing. If ever Disney came close to creating characters and comedy  rivalling Warner Bros, this is it. The interplay between the hyper-kinetic  Brer Fox and the super-slo-mo Brer Bear is hilarious. The only real regret  is that they didn't put another animated segment or two in the completed  film, but the whole point was to make a film that was cheaper than a  full-length animated film. The scenes that combine live-action and  animation succeed wonderfully, much better in fact than similar sequences  in ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"". If  this film ever becomes available, grab it quick!",954633600,25,1432,4.80327868852459
1345757,4,B00004RM2X,"I remember the last time I saw this movie when I was about eight years old way back in the early seventies and thought it was a great movie.  I'm an American currently living in England and shortly after I moved here I  stopped by a local store and something caught my eye.  I saw there on the  shelf ""Song of the South"" on VHS!  It was in PAL format but fortunately I  purchased a multi-system VCR and TV so I could watch any VHS movie.
On  the way home I kept trying to remember what the movie was about and what  all the controversy was.  Well after watching the movie as an adult keenly  attuned to see where the racism was, I didn't find any.  It showed black  people as being very poor and the white people being rich (which was true  at the time in the south), but that's it.  The black people were happy in  the movie despite their situation.  So what's the problem?
If you ever  make your way to England, they sell it in every store that carries videos.  However, you will need a PAL or multi-system VCR and TV to watch it.  It  was even on BBC about a year ago.",954633600,14,1071,4.082125603864735

I loved  this movie as a child. I never saw  anything offensive about it's content. I wanted my children to have the  same experience that I had. But they were not blessed enough to see it.  Movies are made for entertainment. Have any of you seen the movie released  by Disney called ""Pochahantas""? Are you aware that the land where  this story took place in Virginia has no waterfall? No one expects Disney  movies to be precise and accurate. I would hope that the viewing audiance  is intellegent enough to know fact from fiction. Please bring back this  masterpiece.

1345764,5,B00004RM2X,Song of the South is wonderful childhood memory. I used to sing zip-a-dee do-da when I would go hicking through the woods just like Uncle Remus and Brar Rabbit did in the film.
