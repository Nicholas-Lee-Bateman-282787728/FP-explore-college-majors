8213035,5,B000UDV2PO,Ayo is an amazing artist. Bought the DVD for my brother who loves her. I forgot all about leaving a review I bought this a few years ago whoops,1376870400,,143,3.9655172413793105
8213036,3,B000UDV2PO,"Let's get straight to it, I love Ayo. Her voice is lyrical and fresh and I've litenned to her CDs over and over and over.
I actually bought this DVD late at night and for some reason I thought I was getting a CD. Not to worry, the sound qulaity and Ayo are amazing. That said, I detest the overlaying and split screen parts of this DVD. The odd parts of the concert which are straight shots of Ayo and the band are excellent, but still there is the annoyance of the overlays....first time I played it, I ejected the disc after only a copuple of minutes. I don't see the point of it, to me it's not really that appealing and reminiscent of someone who has a basic editing program trying out the functions. If you've ever seen a poster with far too many typefaces to the point of being amatuer, then this is the equivalent.
It's a wonderful recording that makes excellent background, but if you want to see a concert vid then this is probably not for you; that said, if you're cooking and listenning more than watching, it's a super cool experience.",1267228800,3,1047,4.346938775510204
8213037,5,B000UDV2PO,"Ayo is definitely one of the most remarkable singers and songwriters of our time. After watching this DVD, I got both of her CDs available that were ""Joyful"" and ""Gravity at Last"". From my standpoint, everything she has produced so far is absolutely great. Two more reasons to purchase the DVD are that it contains two songs (""Girls, Boys"" and ""Africa"") that you will not find on any of Ayo CDs, and also that watching the performance is a real pleasure. I would even dare to compare the atmosphere with the one at well-known performances of late sixties. I highly recommend all of Ayo products to those who look for something new, fresh and sincere.",1238371200,4,650,4.660869565217391
