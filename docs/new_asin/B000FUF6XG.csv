Now, a full year later i saw the same item offered again WOOOOW, and i got it!!!!!!!
This you may not miss, if you like Country Music.
What these mother and Daughter will bring you is really fabulous, really, it is.

Do the best you can and see and listen yourself, you won't feel sorry.
I know, I don't:))

2588938,4,B000FUF6XG,I thought that this was a great portrayal of Naomi's version of The Judds. However in the years since this movie things have been made known about what really happened. I wish there was an updated version that would combine Naomi and Wynonna's books together to make an updated movie. If Ashley was to write one that would make it even better!,1192579200,,343,4.548387096774194

2588940,5,B000FUF6XG,"I loved this movie and happy to see that it is out on dvd. I recorded it when it was on a long time ago. This movie has the viewer look into the life of the Judds off the stage. They had many problems with each other especially wynonna and Naomi, but it also shows the relationship between these two woman. The producers got people who looked very similar to the real people, not a lot o producers take the time to do that.",1179100800,4,423,4.0476190476190474

2588996,5,B000FUF6XG,"Love can build a bridge tells the real-life story of Naomi and Wynonna Judd's rise to fame. It also chronicles the devastating way Naomi was forced to leave it. The movie depicts the tumultuous relationship between mother and daughter, and the strong bond between them. It is based on the book of the same name written by Naomi Judd. It is definetly a must for any Judd fan.",1231977600,2,374,4.514705882352941
2588997,4,B000FUF6XG,I wouldn't know how to rate this product because amazon sent me the wrong movie and then couldn't gaurantee it before christmas so I canceled it. This was one of many mistakes they made this holiday season. I was very dissappointed in Amazon. Beings I saw this movie a while ago I will review it based on memory.,1231286400,,312,4.396551724137931
2588998,4,B000FUF6XG,This is a well done film based on Naomi Judd's biography.  I'm glad we purchased it.,1222732800,,84,4.25
2588999,5,B000FUF6XG,"I read Naomi Judd's biography of the same name years ago and was delighted when they made a tv movie from the book.  I am even more excited that they have released it to DVD.  This story follows Naomi's biography fairly close and it is just a heartwarming story.  Thankfully Naomi and Wynonna did the singing voiceovers because it lent more emotion to the story.  The acting and the lip synching are fairly good, especially Kathleen York, the woman who plays the character of Naomi. She really seemed to have alot of the mannerisms that Naomi has.  Whether you are a Judd fan or not, it is likely that you will enjoy this movie.  It is simply made with not a lot of flash so it allows the story to be at the forefront.  It always makes me want to tell my Mom how much I love her and respect her for putting aside her own ambitions and needs in order to make my life a better one.",1214352000,3,879,4.196428571428571

8126671,4,B000FUF6XG,"I realize this TV biopic was produced in 1994. As I watched the production I had to put myself in a late 90s mindset, and also recount that for several years in Country Music, the Judds ruled supreme. Unlike most biopics that are made when the subject is deceased, old, or otherwise past their prime, this project came out not long after Naomi retired and the Judds were still fresh on everyones minds. The movie was based on Naomis autobiography, Love Can Build a Bridge. At around 3 hours in length, there is plenty of time to delve into Naomis background, and show how her determination as a single parent lead to the development of the singing duo.

Cast to play Naomi, Kathleen York, does a commendable job portraying Momma Judd. Though shes a either taller or thinner than the real Naomi, she manages to talk like her and capture many of her stage moves. Viveka Davis plays Wynonna. Davis manages to portray the young smart-alecky and stubborn Wynonna, but she looks more like fellow country singer Jodee Messina. In some scenes Davis looks older than York, and even seems taller; maybe it was the lighting. The music performance sequences were better than average for a biopic, and Davis and York seemed very comfortable in those scenes. Both were/are singers in their own rights.

During the heyday of the Judds, many were unaware that there was another Judd at home  Ashley. A line on the DVD packaging reads, featuring Ashely Judd as herself.  She does provide narration for the movie, but I didn't see her in it. That doesnt mean shes not, it just means I didn't see her.

The biopic does a good job of showing the dynamics between mother and daughter(s), as well dramatizing Naomis hepatitis diagnosis which lead to her retiring. Also portrayed is Naomis relationship with future husband Larry Strickland.

Surprisingly, to me, the movie holds up even though its now several years old. It doesnt feel dated. Fans of the Judds should be pleased with this movie, and the casual fan can gain some insight as to the career arc of the Judds.  Even though Im late seeing this movie, this bridge still holds up after all these years.",1469318400,2,2138,4.7005347593582885
