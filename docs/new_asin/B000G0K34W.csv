8167418,2,B000G0K34W,"This dvd was truly big disappointment! I purchased it so that the Praise Dancers at my church could add the tambourines to their dance. Looking at the cover, I thought that this would be a Joyful experience of Worship in the dance/tambourine. Very misleading! This was ""The Most"" boring dvd that I have ever had the experience of viewing! And since this was an instructional dvd, made it more disappointing!

The same piece of music was played (on piano)throughout the presentation,

for each dance routine, only the tempo changed(slow , moderate , fast)!BORING! There were several blunders and bloopers that should have been edited. There were scripture readings during the dancing, which were read in a monotone voice! It sounded like someone sqeaking a piece of chalk on a blackboard! Irritating! The instructor gave instructions that would put any body to sleep!

I decided to get a second opinion about this dvd before rating it, so I took it to a friend of mine who heads the Praise Dancers at her Church.

Halfway through the viewing she looked at me and said,"" This is awful, how much did you pay for it?"" Which brings me to my final point: The cost of this dvd ($29.95) made the sale even more ridiculous!

People do a lot of things in the name of the Lord, but God is about Excellence! This tape was far from that! Whoever put this dvd into circulation, needs to go back to the drawing board, and give people something worthy of $29.95.",1176940800,,1446,4.654901960784314
