So I made my purchase through a seller on eBay that I purchased a lot of my Twins collection from. You get a total of 53 freakin videos of the HOT Twins!!! Granted you're not getting every video ever put out by Twins, but this is 53 of them in a great collection!
I love my Twins and I love this collection!
You get a majority of all Twins hits! This is a collection of music videos spanning from Twins very first 2001 EP ""Twins (AVEP)"" to Twins 2006 album ""Ho Hoo Tan"". This great collection was put out to celebrate Twins 6th year anniversary. So for any Twins fan, this is a must have for your Twins collection!",1423958400,,716,4.121428571428571
