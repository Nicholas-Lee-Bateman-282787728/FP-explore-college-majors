6200836,4,B00HRUQ992,Marx Brothers were funny not only in their movies but also in their tv appearances. This collection is great one of their tv-apoearances.,1438214400,,137,5.0

6200838,5,B00HRUQ992,"Just got this and spent a very enjoyable couple of evenings with this set.  Quality goes from superb (the Cavett, Gleason and Dinah Shore clips are from high-quality color videotape) to kinda rough (some of the filmed commercials), but the kinescopes (which is what much of this is from) are of generally acceptable quality.  I have seen a lot of the Groucho stuff, and even some of the Harpo, but what was the most fascinating was Chico's material.  I never realized that he made so many TV appearances and he was absolutely charming!

My favorites:

The College Bowl (March 26, 1951).  Chico on a live TV sitcom.  His speech at the end directly to the camera is beautiful.
The Colgate Comedy Hour (March 30, 1952).  Two clips, one featuring Harpo and Chico's famous dual piano bit.
Showtime (October 4, 1959)  Chico late in life on British TV.
The Dinah Shore Chevy Show (October 4, 1959)  Groucho and Dinah doing ""Peasie Weasie"" on beautiful color tape.
Kraft Music Hall with Milton Berle (January 14, 1959)  Harpo cutting up with Berle.  Great.
Showdown at Ulcer Gulch (1958)  Chico playing piano in color!
The Marx Brothers Home Movie Collection, with music and narration by Harpo's son Bill Marx.  Fun stuff.
The Red Skelton Hour (September 25, 1962)  Harpo late in life showing that he still had it.
Championship Bridge with Charles Goren (October 16, 1960)  Chico's last appearance.
The Jackie Gleason Show (October 14, 1967)  Groucho and Gleason do ""Gallagher and Shean"" and ""Show me a Rose"".  Beautiful color tape.
The Dick Cavett Show (March 20, 1970)  Cast of ""Minnie's Boys"" and Cavett and Groucho sing Gilbert and Sullivan.  Another great tape transfer.
Beds (1976)  Groucho right at the end.  He's weak but still funny in an exchange with his old pal, George Fenneman.",1435104000,,1783,4.853820598006645

6200841,3,B00HRUQ992,"I was disappointed with this collection.  Though it has some real gems- they're usually Groucho; there is so much crap in this collection.  The stuff Harpo and Chico did was almost always really sad, poorly written, and just incredibly third rate programs.  Not even that they're program we've never heard of- but they're sooo awful!  I have a sneaky suspicion the clips and shows here that are actual gems are also available on youtube tho haven't checked that totally.",1422403200,,470,4.9113924050632916

6200867,5,B00HRUQ992,"Classic stuff, most people only remember Groucho on TV from ""You Bet Your Life"" but forget Chico and Harpo were all over the early television landscape as well.

6200872,1,B00HRUQ992,"I would buy this set in a nano-second if it had the missing 4th disc as it looks magnificent.

Margaret Dumont's final appearance here with Groucho on ""The Hollywood Palace"" only days before she passed away is the reason why I'd be buying this set -- to me, ""The Marx Brothers TV Collection"" IS this guest appearance -- having looked for it on shoddy public domain video cassettes and dvds for years, finally here is officially released here -- and being in Australia I can't get it (they don't ship down here) and while some Shout Factory sets are released in Australia and overseas, I'm not holding my breath for this one, just in case. So on behalf of all the Marx Brothers fans outside the US -- 'hello, I must be going' -- sorry that Amazon is taking the heat over this, they've got everything....except this Margaret Dumont 4th disc.",1408838400,,839,4.556291390728477
6200873,5,B00HRUQ992,It's not every day a video company goes to the trouble of digging up rare tv footage to compile. This is an amazing collection of gems from the golden age of television. The people at SHOUT have put together a terrific compilation of Marx brothers tv rarities. This set includes Harpos shinning in a dramatic role. But on a sad note Chico looks old and tired in many of his later tv appearances. Buy this set while its available.,1408752000,,429,4.443037974683544
6200874,5,B00HRUQ992,"Disregard the two more negative reviews of this set especially the iidotic 1-star. If you're a Marx fan, this set is essential. True, these are the older Marx Brothers but you know that from the start. This set isn't just clips from appearances but the complete programs where applicable such a Red Skelton Hour that alone is worth the price of the set. If you insist on the younger Marx Bros from movies, fine, since they're all available but you can enjoy these as well. It also gives a chance to see Groucho in a rare dramatic role. Ok, he's no Olivier but still interesting. Bottom line? Grab this while you can as good stuff goes out of print all too soon.",1408492800,2,661,4.426229508196721
6200875,5,B00HRUQ992,Fantastic collection of all the loose ends one could ever hope to be collected in one place of the  Marx Brothers. Well worth the cash. I'm very satisfied.,1406505600,5,155,4.535714285714286
6200876,5,B00HRUQ992,"I'm very impressed by this collection and that we see home movies of the great clowns. As well, to any Marx aficionado to see this 10.5 hours of work on TV spanning the end of their movie career almost yup until their deaths, is really remarkable. Here in the 21st century something like this is possible, where if you missed these when they aired, it is amazing to have all of this in one small collection. Bravo to Robert Bader and Bill Marx who were the primary movers and shakers to unearth these gems.",1406160000,4,506,4.3936170212765955
6200887,5,B00HRUQ992,"The description says ""360 minutes"" (maybe that's been fixed by now), but it's actually about 10 hours of treasures.  A deep dive into the final act of three comedy legends.  I loved every minute of it.  Thank you, Shout.  If you hadn't given this to us, no one would have.  There are pieces in here I didn't think even existed.  It's like the most entertaining museum I've ever been to.",1405987200,7,386,4.442857142857143
6200888,5,B00HRUQ992,"If you order from Amazon you will receive 3 total discs.  If you order directly from the Shout Factory website you will receive a 4th disc, More Bits & Pieces.

More Bits and Pieces is NOT included with the Amazon version, and features the following:

FULL SHOWS
Silver Theater: Papa Romani (May 15, 1950)
Chico filmed two episodes of Papa Romani for the Silver Theater anthology series in 1950.  The first one, broadcast on January 9th, is not known to survive.  This second episode, featuring William Frawley and Margaret Hamilton, survives in a syndicated version from the Hollywood Half Hour series.

The Christophers: It's Your Serve (December 18, 1954)
Father James Feller founded the Christophers organization in 1945 and enlisted numerous Hollywood stars to help deliver his message.  Father Keller began hosting a weekly inspirational television show in 1952.  This episode features Harpo, Pat O'Brien, Jerry Colonna, James Gleason, Charles Farrell and tennis stars Jack Framer, Pancho Gonzalez, Ken McGregor and Frank Sedgerman.  Harpo performs his composition ""Guardian Angels"".

BONUS TV CLIPS
See You At The Polls (October 9, 1956)
Groucho and George Fenneman urge voters to participate in the upcoming 1956 presidential election in this appeal filmed on the set of You Bet Your Life.  It was broadcast on the special See You at the Polls with similar messages from other stars.

The Hollywood Palace (March 15, 1964)
Groucho hosted The Hollywood Palace twice.  This performance of ""Dr. Hackenbush"" from the first show features Dee Hartford, Groucho's sister-in-law.  Dee was the former wife of legendary director Howard Hawks.

The Hollywood Palace (April 17, 1965)
For his second time as host of The Hollywood Palace, Groucho invited Margaret Dumont to be his guest.  They recreated the ""Hooray for Captain Spaulding"" sequence from Animal Crackers - which Dumont had starred in with the Marx Brothers on stage and screen.  The Hollywood Palace show turned out to be her final performance.  Margaret Dumont died on March 6, 1965 - several weeks before the tapes show aired.

One Man Show (November 1, 1969)
Groucho was the guest comedian on an episode of the curious, short-lived series One Man Show. Groucho's monologue - which originated as a 1965 letter to his friend Harry Kurnitz - also appears in printed form in the book, The Groucho Letters.

Maxine Marx Interview (1971)
Chico's daughter Maxine is interviewed in her New York City apartment by Norfolk, Virginia television station WTAR.",1405641600,36,2509,5.1786600496277915
6200889,5,B00HRUQ992,got it directly from Shout last weekend.  if you like the Marx Brothers  & classic TV --get this set. The Jack Benny  show meets You Bet Your Lyfe skit is classic Groucho/Benny. Also liked Chico as Harpo on I've Got  A Secret . So much more for me to watch--but---it's a great collection!,1405296000,4,288,4.377358490566038
6200890,3,B00HRUQ992,"These are the Marx Bros. in their older years way past their prime.
Your not going to see anything here that is better than in their movies.
It is what it is Marx Bros. in 1950s' t.v. and some Groucho in the 60s' and 70s' t.v.
Nothing here is worth repeat viewing like I LOVE LUCY or THE HONEYMOONERS.",1405209600,5,301,4.11864406779661
6200891,5,B00HRUQ992,"I heartily recommend this just-released box set to any fans of the Marx Brothers or early TV.  When I first heard it was being assembled, I was concerned that it would be kinda sad to see post-""Love Happy"" Harpo and Chico in their declining years (while Groucho was white-hot with ""You Bet Your Life""), but I'm happy to report this set is jam-packed with a great many fascinating/enjoyable/entertaining/amusing things, many/most of which I'd never seen, lots of which are of better quality than one might expect from vintage kinescopes and long-neglected film footage.  Also, Rob Bader's accompanying booklet has a lot of interesting info I didn't know.  A real treat.",1405209600,14,668,5.054545454545455
6200892,5,B00HRUQ992,"Simply an amazing set, filled with gems you've been waiting years to see, things the experts said no longer existed, and others you didn't even know ever existed.  The energy level the brothers show in live performance before an audience is astonishing.  As the very informative forty page accompanying booklet points out, some of the routines done here go back to the brothers' earliest days in vaudeville in the 1910's.  Groucho's performance of Schnitzlebank goes back earlier, to his teenage days as a member of The Three Nightingales. The Harpo & Chico appearance on the Colgate Comedy Hour is among my favorites on the set, performing their four handed piano piece and also the knife dropping bit (among other things).

An added treat are home movies that stretch back to the late 1920's with narration and musical accompaniment by Son of Harpo: Bill Marx.  Those who have read about Harpo's experience performing with Alexander Woollcott in Yellow Jacket will be amazed to see vibrant colour home movies of that.",1405123200,19,1019,5.005917159763314

On the basis of the above contents, virtually none of which have circulated since their original playdates, this set is clearly essential for anyone who considers themselves a Marx Brothers fan.  It will doubtless also prove invaluable for film & television history scholars as well.  I've placed my order and do not expect to be disappointed!",1400889600,136,3265,4.721052631578948
6200894,5,B00HRUQ992,"I never write reviews for products before they're released, but I consider it SO unfair that one customer has seen fit to give this set a one star review simply because he doesn't know what's included, that I'm temporarily posting this review to bring the average back up.  The details on the contents of this set can be found on Shout! Factory's web site.  This is going to be the most significant release of new Marx Brothers material in our lifetimes.

They were one of the greatest, if not the greatest comedy team of cinematic history. 10 stars for them -- but for this product one star or less! That said, where is the details as to what is contained in this 3 disc (6 hours running time) set? It claims to be a ""TV collection"" -- so it should contain NONE of the Marx Brothers movies that are readily available in other collections. Does it contain more episodes of ""You Bet Your Life,"" of which there is a plethora of collections? The General Electric Theater episode ""The Incredible Jewel Robbery"" (1959), which starred Harpo and Chico with an uncredited Groucho in a cameo role? ""The Mikado"" (1960) starring Groucho only? ""Papa Romani"" (1950), a television pilot which starred Chico only?  Without more information -- MUCH MORE --- even a die-hard Marx Brothers fan would not plunk down $38, an inflated price, for just six hours of just what ??????",1400630400,11,982,4.611428571428571
6200896,5,B00HRUQ992,"Sorry, Amazon, but Marx Brothers enthusiasts need to know that that you get a free bonus DVD when this item is ordered directly from Shout Factory.",1399248000,53,147,4.6923076923076925
8634927,5,B00HRUQ992,"...but only IF you're a hardcore Marx Bros fan.  This is the TV years, well after their glory years.  It's like watching Paul McCarthy now.  You appreciate him as an artist, but...yeah.  Harpo and Groucho come off a little bit better than Chico does in these TV spots, but it still feels like the Bros are retreading some of their great bits for a nostalgic public.  It's nice to see as a fan, don't get me wrong, but if you're coming into this thinking you're getting movie-quality Marx Bros comedy...sorry.

The best parts about this collection is the home-videos and documentaryish aspects to home life of the real men.  The children and friends of the Marx Bros provide some footage and insight on who these guys really were.  For that alone, it's worth the money.

This is a great value as well.  The first disc alone is over 4 hours of content... all worth watching.  When they say over 10 hours, they aren't lying.  Literally everything the Marx Bros appeared in during that time-period is here, even if it's a strange company advertisement for a magazine (only to be seen by employees.)  Aside from the Marx Bros themselves, this is a weird look back into how early television was, which for someone who didn't grow up with it, was interesting.  It's like a time capsule in some way.

If you're a casual Marx Bros fan, I don't know if you'd like it on your own.  But with everything I mentioned above, there are levels of enjoyment to these discs.  You can enjoy it as a television historian, or as a semi-documentary, or just enjoy watching the brothers preform once more.  Hardcore fans need this in their collection though.  So buy it.  You'll thank me later.",1511481600,,1670,4.596610169491526

Lots of stuff you've never seen before,even if your a lifelong fan. 3 DVD's packed full of really great,really touching and some really weird clips. I really enjoyed a color,vaudeville performance with Groucho &  Jackie Gleeson, GREAT! Lot's of rare Harpo stuff and of coarse Chico. It's well mixed with all three on all 3 discs. RARE RARE RARE,BUT....... you gotta really love and be a fan of The Marx Bros. to truly enjoy this! Well put together packaging,
with a booklet to boot. All I can say is,I got my moneys worth just in 15 mins of the 1st disc. A great addition to those who collect Marx Bros.movies

There are great (and some color!) commercials with Harpo and several previously unavailable clips.  Things like Shamus Culhane's SHOWDOWN AT ULCER GULCH (1956)--an advertising film that literally turned the industry on it's head.  Culhane was a former Disney animator who formed his own production company--and was married to Chico's daughter.  Culhane was able to get cameos from some real stars--Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, and Chico and Groucho!!  The color on this film is faded (early Eastmancolor) but still it's historically very important.  And it's funny, and a real treat to see this groundbreaking filmmaking that even has a fully animated Hazel (the cartoon maid from the Saturday Evening Post.).
