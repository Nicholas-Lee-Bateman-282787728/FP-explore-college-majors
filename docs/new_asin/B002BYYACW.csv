8362630,4,B002BYYACW,"In this 1988-89 Season of KATE & ALLIE, TV's favorite single moms are back for the 6th and final season of one the most funny, hip and poignant shows of our time. Susan Saint James and Jane Curtin co-star as high school girlfriends Kate McArdle and Allie Lowell, 2 divorcees raising their kids together in 1 of the rare modern sitcoms set, which was filmed in New York City.

Critics raved as the show had massive ratings, earning Jane Curtin 1 of 2 consecutive Emmy Awards for Best Actress.

This 1988-89 Season also included guest appearances by football legend Dick Butkus, Christa Miller (Scrubs), Dylan Walsh (Nip/Tuck), Wendie Malick (Frasier, Just Shoot Me!), Jude Ciccolella (24), Skip Hinnant (Fritz the Cat, The Electric Company), film actor Jay O. Sanders, Max Casella (The Sopranos, Doogie Howser, M.D.), Steven Gilborn (Ellen, The Wonder Years), June Gable (Friends), Susie Essman (Curb Your Enthusiasm), as well as Louis Zorich and Cynthia Harris (Mad About You).

Unfortunately, Kate & Allie's relationship seemed to have gotten stale & hackneyed in this shows last 2 seasons & felt it was time to move on, which is probably what led to KATE & ALLIE'S cancellation in the Spring of 1989 after its 6-year run on CBS.",1400544000,,1230,4.903846153846154
