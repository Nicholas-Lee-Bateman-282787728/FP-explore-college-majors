2338585,4,B0009Y02BE,"Directed by Fritz Lang, AMERICAN GUERILLA IN THE PHILIPPINES is based in part on life incidents of Navy Ensign Chuck Parsons. Technicolor on location filming occurred just prior to America's involvement in Korea, although ""Guerilla"" was released two months after the Sept. 1950 Inchon landings. Timing, plus story content belie a commonly held belief that this was created as pro-Korean War propaganda.

Here, Ensign ""Palmer"" (Power) flees capture in Bataan by going to the Philippines, where he helps organize resistance to Japanese invaders. Along the way, Palmer gets romantically involved with a Frenchwoman (Prestle) who's a widowed plantation owner. Just when things look bleakest the ""cavalry,"" in the form of Gen. Douglas McArthur (Barrat) and his troops, come to the rescue.

2338618,5,B0009Y02BE,"It's a good war story. Well acted and narrated by Tyrone Power. The movie has a realistic approach to war time and it didn't smell like propaganda to me, unlike some people wrote in their review. No one likes the war, no one wants to die but sometimes we have no control over what's happening in the world, and sometimes War becomes an ugly outcome. I read that Tyrone Power didn't want to do the movie however he did what a great actor could do, that is create a very believable character. When I watch him in this movie I forget he is Tyrone Power. Yes, he is still very handsome but it also feels that he is one of us so all you see is a guy next door and you forget about his extraordinary looks, I also read critics reviews of that time. They said the movie script was week and watered down and the writer/director himself didn't like it. If this is true it only shows how great of an actor Tyrone Power is. He pulled it through for me. One last thing: don't listen to other people, form your own opinion and get this movie. I think you will enjoy it.",1492214400,,1056,4.15609756097561

2338637,3,B0009Y02BE,"The technical quality of the movie is just ok -- not bad, but not great either.  My main complaint is that this movie did not do justice to the book it was based on -- ""American Guerrilla In the Philippines"" by Ira Wolfert.  The book is brilliant - full of humor, pathos and excitement, written in a fresh, lean style that puts Hemingway to shame.  The movie cuts about half the characters out of the book, reduces the story line, and makes the rest of the characters into simple cartoon people with comic book dialogue.  Also, in the true story book, the white American hero falls in love with and has an affair with a local Philippine beauty.  But of course this was too extreme back in1943 -- after all, a Filipino was almost....a.... . negro!  So in the movie he has an affair with a white 'French nurse'.  Anyway, it's an interesting period film, when the ""Japanese"" were really ""cruel Japs"".  And they were.  Buy and read the book as well!",1472774400,2,945,4.4476744186046515

If you are a Tyrone Power fan (like me), you'll be happy that this film is FINALLY available on DVD. I love 20th Century Fox stars from the 1930s - the 1950s. There's just something about them that's distinctly different from the stars at MGM or Warners. I don't recall ever seeing the female lead (Michelline Prelle) in any other Fox film (or any where else, for that matter). Usually, you can spot the same actors over and over again in films from the studio era but she's definitely not a regular.",1467849600,,578,4.351851851851852

challenge to lead a band of Philippine Natives who carry out acts of espionage.  Constantly, they are pursued by Japanese Imperial Marines.  They receive clandestine support and supplies from U.S. Submarines during the interim also.

Tyrone Power gives a strong performance as Ensign Palmer, a dedicated but compassionate man.  Micheline Presle is stirring as the French woman he falls in love with, as they battle the abuses of the Japanese.  Filipino actor Juan Toreno is admirable as Presle's husband, who faces the odds to help the cause of his country.  The locations in the Philippines evoke the poverty of the people, who nevertheless had the strength to fight for freedom.  Good watch.",1418428800,4,698,5.026086956521739

2338703,5,B0009Y02BE,"When I was a lad I used to watch this movie on TV with my Dad WWII Vet Army Staff Sergeant via Picture for a Sunday Afternoon.
In the last 10 years, I have only seen parts of this movie maybe 3 times. It unfortunately is not shown much these days and was about 95% out of print. I am very glad to say that early this week I saw it available via Amazon from CClassics. I read the reviews and ordered it. It arrived today Saturday May 05, 2012 in the mail. The delivery service from CClassics was fabulous.  One review I read stated that they were disappointed in this color DVD. It was in their opinion ""washed out"". Well maybe you could say that if you compared it to the vivid standards of the New 2nd season 2012 ""Hawaii50"" CBS TV series, but truthfully the color is just fine for the time frame it was made and Colorization for a limited audience isn't feasible financially. As for the film if you like Tyrone Power and WWII films you will like this film. Another review penned that the relationship/romance between Tyrone and Micheline Prelle as ""hokey"" and compared to the promiscuity non-standards of today e.g. Jersey Shore that statement makes some sense, but not for then. The movie was trying to maintain sensibilities of the time, it was made for ""G"" viewing by the public and is a standard that needs to be embraced again today that is in my humble opinion. Hope this helps.
Thank you.
Blessings,
Phil

2338706,4,B0009Y02BE,"One of the few remaining Lang films that I hadn't seen and that was at all accessible, I finally caught up with this color war film for the first time on AMC.  Though not one of the director's finest works, it was certainly worth a watch, with Tyrone Power leading a group of Navy enlisted men on a circuitous journey across the islands, at first in the hopes of making their way to safe Australia but eventually settling for becoming part of an American guerrilla warfare effort. The film is notable for not presenting the Japanese in as brutal a light as was common at the time -- though they certainly are ""the enemy"" in every way, and the film definitely has a rah-rah go America feeling to it at times, particularly the ending. The use of color is outstanding as I've found it always to be with this director despite his favoring black and white, and the performances are all quite solid.

The problems lie mostly in the central third of the film as the guerrilla mission gets going; there's a little too much repetition here, and the romance between Power's ensign Palmer and Micheline Presle's Jeanne Martinez doesn't really seem necessary nor is it well thought out; overall the film feels a little too long and verges on tedious.  But the final shootout is pretty well done and the patriotic feeling that MacArthur's return evokes is pretty stirring.  I certainly wasn't bored, even if this is a far from typical Lang effort that does not show him at his best.

This Hollywood's Attic DVD is pretty watchable for an off-market release, but here's hoping that this film and other Lang rarities like BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT get official, quality releases before too long.",1263600000,16,1680,4.68135593220339
