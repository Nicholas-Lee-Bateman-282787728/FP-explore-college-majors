The film is based upon Greek mythology tale ""Orpheus and Eurydice.""

The film opens with a cheap prop suicide of Apollo Greenspan (Mike Horner), billionaire. It shifts to his son Orpheus (Dillon Day) who being taken for a cab ride by Hermes (Ron Jeremy) wearing a funny winged hat. In case you didn't know Hermes was the messenger of the gods, the cab has a bumper sticker which tells you that. Orpheus plans on rescuing his girlfriend D.C. Vegas (Ava Vincent) and returning to earth to the dismay of his uncle Pluto Hades who runs the place. Orpheus gets advice from fate, played by MENSA member Asia Carrera, who still can't deliver a line after 280 movies.

The film was overran with silicon. It included adult scenes that were out of the flow of the film, i.e. the added nothing to the plot and were more of a distraction. I would say for those who like an extensional adult film with a Dante twist that has both intellectual appeal and Amber Lynn I would recommend 1986 "" The Devil in Miss Jones 3: A New Beginning"" a far superior film.

This film was grainy. There are Russian amateur films of higher quality. What was that all about? Michael Raven didn't think we would notice or care? Also the film ""climaxes"" too early with an orgy scene being the second adult scene. Since the scene really never connected well into the tale, they should have ended with it, i.e. what normally happens in the underworld and they could have included Ava Vincent in it too.",1397606400,,1504,4.600746268656716
