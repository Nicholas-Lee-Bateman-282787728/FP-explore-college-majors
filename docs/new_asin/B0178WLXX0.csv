Highly recommended to anyone who likes music documentaries,  punk or English history.  The disc 1 film itself is  90 minutes and not 130 minutes that the back of the packaging states. Ask your local library to order this film if you would like to see it. That's how I was able to get my hands on it and more people in your community will get a chance to find out about the band.",1485734400,,474,4.075268817204301
8738351,4,B0178WLXX0,"Paul Weller and The Jam
Poor Paul Weller ,to this day he just can not reconcile that,although he was the chief architect of the band and it's driving force,he wasn't The Jam. They were,Paul,Bruce and Rick. All you have to do,is watch and listen when he is asked the question ,he has been asked a thousand times before ,""Are you guys going to reunite?"" The fury and rage ,that comes through is still white hot to this day.
I saw the band a bunch of times back in the day,have been a fan since the 2nd lp. When Paul disbanded them to become a french pastry back in 1982,I'm sure he thought he could go on forever,always being the center of everything he did. As it turns out,that really wasn't the case. I think the reason is,The Jam,are what I like to call a force of nature band. They instantly and permanently became more than the sum of their parts,the minute they got together. They would join other bands like The Beatles,The Stones,The Kinks,Jimi Hendrix Experience,The Dead....right up to modern times with bands like REM and U2.,The Smiths.. Once done ,it can never be undone. it's unbreakable and unchangeable. Sometimes bands can whether personal changes,Pink Floyd and The Stones are two that come to mind. They are exceptions and also there was a death involved,most of those,like The Doors,just end.
Anyway,here we are over thirty years later and Paul still has not comes to grips with the simple truth,that band was three people not one and nothing he has done since even nears what they were able to do,as a matter of routine. When those three guys made music,it was just better. End of story.
So ,these days I think of Paul ,as the crazy old guy,who gets up every morning,has his tea and ciggie and then heads down to the seashore to shake his fist at the incoming tide. You have to admire the conviction and tenacious attitude but tide rolls in regardless.
Sometimes Paul reminds me of that scene in Excalibur,when Merlin tells Arthur,that he and the land are one. More or less,how one fares so shall the other.
Then there is this final one; He's like the creature in the Mothman Prophecies film,when the Richard Gere character asks the creature what he looks like,it replies ""Depends on who's looking""
RIP The Jam,one of the finest British bands of all time,right to this day.",1482364800,3,2293,4.650246305418719
8738352,4,B0178WLXX0,"For someone on this side of The Pond, I was a massive Jam fan. I followed them on two Canadian tours, had every 45 (in pic sleeve, of course!), posters, badges, the parka, The Jam shoes...they were my band back in the day. Now, I have moved on and am not stuck in the late '70s and early '80s. Anyway, the documentary itself mainly focuses on viewing the band's impact on its fans while chronologically following its start to finish. Jam fan and actor Martin Freeman makes an appearance as well throughout, FYI.

I think telling is the band members are never interviewed together at all. The documentary also takes us past The Jam's breakup. I found the scenes of really old mods (yes, my age) at Not The Jam gigs. Sorry, I don't get it at all. The young Middlesbrough kid who became a Jam fan in 1994 and started a mod vlog is great. That sort of enthusiasm was infectious. There's an extended version of his interview with Paul Weller on the extras.

The extras are decent as we get more of Weller and his childhood chum Steve Brookes hanging out on a sofa talking and fooling around on their acoustic guitars. Weller visits his old school and neighborhood in Woking. Buckler and Foxton take us around their neighborhoods in Woking. Buckler is shown some odd public sculpture to The Jam. Then there are some live clips of the band at The Rainbow in London in '79 (""It's Too Bad"" and ""Saturday's Kids"") and at The Ritz in New York in '81 (""The Modern World"" and ""The Eton Rifles"").

Oddly, there's a booklet inside the case suggesting there's a whole other concert from The Rockpalast in Dortmund, West Germany, from Nov. 30, 1980. There was no other disc that came with. Nor could I find that concert on the single disc that had the doc on there.

In the doc itself I thought not enough time was spent on how the All Mod Cons LP really was the true breakthrough to greatness. They did go on about ""Down In The Tube Station At Midnight"" as being a seminal sounding single but that entire LP was it, baby. It broke the mod mold and proved The Jam stood with their mod forebearers as unique musical talents.

Lastly, there was this theory back in the day that such a massive band in the UK was unable to crack the American market because they were ""too British."" I think that is such a flawed theory. The reality was ALL New Wave era bands had a hard time cracking the charts and getting any radio airplay to do that irregardless of their citizenship. I mean, you hear the Ramones or Talking Heads nowadays but back in that 1976 through early '80s time, they got virtually no airplay or press in the States and they were AMERICAN! Different era, folks. The powers that were in music were mainly that stuck-in-the-supergroup hippy '70s types.

Things didn't really open up in the US until Nirvana came along in 1991 with ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."" Only then did radio stations start realizing they'd missed the New Wave generation of music such that now you can hear New Wave bands' tunes in TV commercials over here.",1480291200,,3015,4.482695810564663
8738353,5,B0178WLXX0,Nice to see a modern release about the Jam that has the full support of Paul Weller. The documentary does a great job of having the band members tell their own story. Seeing all three members discuss their history and their amazing music makes me wish they'd set their differences aside and put on a show or two.,1475280000,2,312,4.396551724137931

8738359,5,B0178WLXX0,"I wrote a review for this--accidentally, for the 'soundtrack' as it were.  This package contains 2 DVD's: one is an excellent documentary that is currently being shown on 'Showtime' to subscribers for free (and you can request if you have cable, for free, then cancel ST), and the other DVD is a complete nearly perfectly performed live performance by the group in November 1980 to an audience in Germany who were hearing the songs from 'Sound Effects' for the first time--and the group were playing them as if the future of the world was at stake and only they could save it... Summation: if you never 'got' (a) The Jam (b) new wave (c) punk rock, you need to see/hear this second live disc.  Period.  If you love the Jam already, even you will be surprised I think at how very great this is!",1455408000,9,793,4.493055555555555
