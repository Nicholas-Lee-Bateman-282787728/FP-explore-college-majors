4114126,5,B003ELOQD4,"I was at this concert, as well as the show two nights before in Las Vegas.  The concert was streamed live on YouTube (and archived for later viewing for the next week) and of the more than 20 U2 shows I've gone to dating back to the Unforgeable Fire tour, this was best of the lot.  That statistics tell part of the story: this was the biggest show U2 ever played in the US, and the largest show by a single headlining artist in US history.  But that's only part of the story.

While U2 shows are always high energy, this one went just a little bit further. The next to the last show of the tours second leg, they were polished, confident and clearly having a great time.

This is the first U2 live video that will be released in Blu-Ray, and in a rare move for a live concert release, it was taken from only one show.  (Typically, at least two concerts are shot to give more editing choices.)  While this may result is a slightly rougher sound (no second takes - unless they re-recorded them in post), it also gives an even greater sense of being there live in the moment.

More than just a memento of a night at a concert, I'm looking forward for the chance to relive a night that saw one of the best bands in the world completely ""in the zone"" and sharing the moment with 100,000 of their friends in Southern California.",1270339200,6,1323,4.243027888446215
4114127,5,B003ELOQD4,"I saw the 360 tour live in Virginia, and then a little while later the live streaming on YouTube.  Just an amazing concert, great song selection, wonderful visuals.  I can only imagine how good this is going to look on the big TV playing on Blu-ray.

The great thing about this stage, isn't just how good it looks, and how well it showcases the band, but also the design features a bunch of mobile high definition cameras all over the place.  These should have recorded enough footage to really capture this concert well.  The live edits for the YouTube concert were impressive, but given time, I'm sure they have taken it to the next level.

If you like U2 even a little bit, I don't think you'd be disappointed by this purchase.",1270252800,3,730,4.492424242424242
4114128,5,B003ELOQD4,"Hands down, one of the best performances I've ever seen.  I've been to 4 U2 concerts now, and by dumb luck, we made it to the inner circle.  We saw U2 at Cowboy's Stadium, in and of itself, impressive.  Glad to see it is finally here.  If this captures half the excitement I whitened first hand, I would say it is well worth the purchase.",1270080000,4,338,4.153846153846154
4114129,5,B003ELOQD4,"Right. While I wasn't at the Norman Oklahoma show - I WAS at THIS show and I can tell you that it was hands down the BEST concert I have ever been to. Bono and the boys put on a FANTASTIC show and surprisingly, the Black Eyed Peas put on a GREAT show themselves *thanks to the surprise appearance by Slash*. But U2 definitely delivered. I especially loved Bono's shout-out to his MEXICAN fans in Los Angeles during ""Vertigo"" with his shouting ""Viva Mexico"", it drove us ALL crazy! I will CERTAINLY be buying this when it comes out.",1269993600,10,531,4.373737373737374
4114130,5,B003ELOQD4,"I witnessed U2 in concert in Norman, Oklahoma and it was amazing! If you are a dedicated U2 fan, you should purchase this concert movie to watch one of the greatest rock bands of all time perform one of the most amazing concerts ever.",1269993600,4,234,4.340909090909091

4114151,5,B003ELOQD4,"I really enjoyed this bluray as a document of the 360 tour and while it may lack the definition and precise editing of the Elevation Boston DVD it still held my interest throughout. Bono is loose, the setlist is fantastic, and the show is just plain great. Worth it for ""Ultraviolet"" alone.  Can't wait to watch it again.....",1440892800,,325,4.603448275862069

4114177,3,B003ELOQD4,"The music and audio are fantastic...the video editing however, sucks.  I hate the camera jumping from one scene to another, shaking, zooming in and out.

I wish I hadn't bought this one...but I did because I saw this tour so I took a chance.",1417564800,,377,4.582089552238806

I went to there 360 tour when it came to Miami, Fl. it was the best concert I every went too. The spider looking like thing made the show.

4114185,3,B003ELOQD4,"This performance was lackluster in just about every way. Too bad this is the only performance available on Blu.
  The band just didn't seem to give it their ""all"" and didn't try very hard....as a result, there were very few palpable moments of intensity.
 The PQ was grainy most of the time and the AQ was lackluster - maybe because of the massive size of the venue (Rose Bowl).

  I was so disappointed after watching it, that I turned around and ordered the U2 ZooTv concert on Pan and Scan DVD.
 It's not Hi-Def, but at least the performance is intense and the picture will most likely look as good as this Blu-Ray.",1408924800,,618,4.415929203539823

4114190,3,B003ELOQD4,"It captures the u2360 tour, i understand why let Breathe out, they struggled to find a good opening song during the tour, and breathe obviously wasn't one.

The main problem here is the video quality, its just about colors and nothing about details.

Audio is A+

4114193,3,B003ELOQD4,"i was lucky enough to have been at this concert, so i was really looking forward to this release.  the whole point of this tour was ""the claw"" and having been there, i have to say it was impressive.  Unfortunately, this was not evident on the video.  Yeah, i understand the band were the focus, but without any background screen, most of the ""light show"" was above them and not really on display.  They could have used a lot more ""wide shots"" where both the band and the claw were on display.  Since, the band members were usually on display on the screen, you'd still be able to see what was going on.  The screen shot was during ""streets"" and this shot was ended too early and they went back to one of the band members.  Again, having been there, the claw was part of the show, but it wasn't shown off enough on the video... Another, complaint was the filters they used on the video.  Prior to the release, there were about 10 clips that were on their website from this show.  10 songs from the concert without any ""effects"" and i have to admit that they look far better than the released video.  HD video looks best things are well-lit.  The blu ray is far too dark so it doesn't always look like it's in hi-definition.  Maybe the band thought they'd look younger if the screen was darker.  It wouldn't have bothered me so much if i hadn't already seen a much better, ""less produced,"" version of it.  Even the Youtube version wasn't so bad.  One more complaint was that they chopped off the first song!!! seeing the band walk on stage and Larry starting the show with his drum solo was a fantastic way to start the show.  They ended up starting the show in outer space and zooming into ""boots"".  Sure they included ""Breathe"" as a bonus track, but it's more of a produced live video rather than the actual concert performance.  Ultimately, this could have been a better release (more wide angle shots showing the claw, less ""production"" on the video, showing the original beginning) but I'm still glad it was released.  They just didn't do the concert justice with this release.",1396137600,,2080,4.469496021220159

4114205,4,B003ELOQD4,"I've had a love/hate relationship with Dublin's finest since someone's older brother shoved a copy of October (vinyl) in my face in the summer of 1981 or so. Musically they have always been great, with a few missteps. Of the early stuff, I wore out a vinyl record, several tapes and a VHS tape of Red Rocks...during the Joshua Tree (becoming bigger than the Beatles) era I got frustrated a bit but I loved Achtung...I come and go but at this point I think all their records offer a lot. My wife and I drove around Hawaii in 2001 with about three CDs one of which was All That You Can't Leave Behind, now one of my favorite albums. Touring wise, I missed the early days but had numerous chances to see them in ""mega mongo dome"" mode and balked. That's not really my scene. I tried to make it work when they did their straight rock band shows at MSG a few years ago but had a work conflict. But the 360 setup caught my attention, and the clips I saw looked very promising. When then U2360 Tour came to NJ went a with a buddy who had also been yearning to see U2 forever and we were literally stunned at the quality of the show both as musical experience and performance art/technical exposition. If I hadn't been to the show I am not sure I would care about this product at all, but as a souvenir of the tour for those who went, it's a winner even if you're not likely to watch it over and over. Bigger is not always better but in the case of U2360 it certainly was. Bono and the boys know what they are doing.",1373932800,,1508,4.167808219178082

U2 360 is without a doubt U2's most visually impressive concert film, even surpassing the ones chronicling their over-the-top 90s shows. The enormous and seemingly sentient ""space ship"" stage (aka ""The Claw"") is a spectacle unto itself, rivaled only by the sight of  98,000 plus perpetually euphoric U2 fans.",1372896000,,471,4.814814814814815

4114212,5,B003ELOQD4,"I am a huge U2 fan, and I have to say that this show was absolutely incredible! The 360 tour was amazing and this blu-ray movie of the Rose Bowl show was extremely well done. The audio and video quality was great, I really felt like I was there at the concert. The bonus features were also pretty cool. The bonus features include documentaries about the tour and music videos from the No Line CD, a bonus track (Breathe), clips from the 360 tour, videos from the opening of the European tour and the North American tour, and more. Overall this movie is incredible and provides a breathtaking concert experience. In my opinion, this is one of U2's best concerts on film.",1364774400,,669,4.491803278688525

You get a sense while watching this of the love that binds the band together after all these years. They are all so good at what they do, each of them could be leading a band on his own.

Bono is definatly getting old ...totally sucks ...wish those 4 could stay young his voice was really awesome on the Zoo TV tour but that tour took it's toll on his vocal chords. I noticed that some songs had to be detuned a half step so he could sing it. ahhhh life gotta love it but sometimes really dislike the getting old part.,1351900800,,509,4.151515151515151

4114229,3,B003ELOQD4,"The U2 360 show did not come to Philadelphia. I heard the stadiums were too small. Looking at this video, I can see the stage would have been a tight fit. It must have been a great show. It is a shame that the video does not transport me into the action, but the editing in this production is too jerky. When I watch a concert, rock or classical does not matter because it's about the music, I tend to watch each musician play his special passage. So if it's Beethoven's Fifth Symphony or Put on Your Boots my eyes follow the musical action, passage by passage through the piece. The editing in U2 360 does not do any of this, it jumps around about every three seconds, which also happens to be the attention span of a rat. I don't know who decided to do the post production like this, but he has no musical talent.

Oh, and the music was hard to understand. The soundtrack was muddled. After the first viewing, I discovered the default soundtrack was ""PCM stereo"". I thought Bluray was supposed to be smart enough to sense your audio setup and put out the right mix. When I changed the soundtrack to ""DTS Master Audio HD"", I heard the music with greater clarity.

So this video has been a disappointment, all the worse because it looks like it was a great show. I wish I had been there.",1341705600,3,1287,4.292181069958848

4114231,5,B003ELOQD4,"Frankly I have no idea what some of these reviewers have a problem with. They must have gone to some high end film school, or wish they did. I was hesitant to buy this for some time due to the negative reviews  This is an excellent show to watch, (especially if you went to the concert) I would highly recommend it.",1338854400,,315,4.163934426229508
4114232,5,B003ELOQD4,"One of the main highlights of last summer was attending the 360 concert in East Lansing.  I know that I am bragging now, so bear with me, but I was literally only six feet away from Bono when he made the ""rounds.""  He was in a direct line from me, and to say that I was starstruck is an understatement.  Granted he only loitered in this spot for a few minutes while I tried in vain to make eye contact with him before he roamed onward to another degree of the 360 stage.

I enjoyed the making of the 360 Degree concept/set special feature on this DVD.  The engineering behind the stage set-up was extremely impressive.  Bono acknowledges that while he is very creative and artsy, he didn't know the nuts and bolts of what it actually took to make this 360 concept a reality.  From what I heard, the band only broke even with this tour because the overhead costs were so astronomical.

And finally, the music is invigorating and passionately performed.  Whenever I am cleaning, I pop this baby into my All-in-One Dell Computer Blu-Ray player and enjoy the show all over again (though the set list for the Rose Bowl show differs a bit from the East Lansing show). I'm not enough of a techie to gripe over the ""low quality"" of the Blu-Ray video or ""disjointed"" camera angles, as more savvy reviewers have observed.  I just enjoy this DVD, and it brings back good memories of a fantastic concert (where there were moments when I was only six feet from Bono!).",1334707200,,1455,4.456603773584906

4114235,5,B003ELOQD4,"FYI: This review is not so much a review of the concert/contents DVD as much as it is my personal experience of watching it.

I have to admit that at my age (42) and *their* age, this is/was probably the *only* way I was ever going to get to see U2 in concert. While I've been a fan since the late eighties, I am NOT a fan of huge crowds. Unless I could have the insane luck of seeing them live at a tiny venue like SNL or something it just wasn't going to happen.

I've seen some concert footage of U2 before and was always impressed - in one concert, can't remember which, Bono picks a girl out of the crowd and lies down on the stage, serenading her as they both look up at the stars. If I could only trade places for a few minutes.... but I digress. As much as I love their music, I never watched their music videos - not of U2 or any band for that matter because I like to keep my own imagery of what the music inspires in my head and for me videos interfere with that process; weird? - maybe but that's me, go figure. The concert video is another story though; I bought this DVD when U2 came to Utah in 2011 to make up a concert date and I was licking my wounds that I did not have the guts to brave tens of thousands of people to see them live.

In the end, after seeing this DVD I am not all that sorry I missed the live concert.

First, I am a normal, not die hard fan. I am 42 and not about to worship anyone in entertainment - so fanboi/girl I am not. Second I am not a audiophile, videophile or technically savvy person so if this video had serious sound or video or editing flaws I would NOT notice. That said, I think the whole thing was excellent. I can't imagine from *all* the views and vantage points that it would be any better actually having been there. After all even with perfect peripheral vision the most I would have been able to see is 180* not 360*.

I set this up with a Bose sound dock and a projector on my living room wall; seated ten feet away, my screen was about 7ft by 10ft. If there was anything closer to being at the concert I certainly would like to know how to do that. We've all read the lengthier reviews, and we all know what we are looking for as far as what we want and expect from to footage, so hopefully it is suffice it to say I really, really enjoyed this concert via DVD and now I can cross one more thing off the bucket list.

Highly recommended for U2 fans.",1328140800,,2411,4.002079002079002
4114236,5,B003ELOQD4,This is yet another fantastic U2 concert wherein they set the standards for other bands at such high levels. Professionalism at all times and a DVD to really enjoy on Blue Ray as its like being at the concert.,1327104000,3,209,4.384615384615385

4114241,5,B003ELOQD4,"I saw U2 at Soldier Field in Chicago and the band must be nocturnal because they did not come out until it was completely dark. The effects, lights, fog, etc. was incredible and it was the second time in my life (Prince was the first) that I've attended a concert and felt as if I were part of the concert instead of a fan simply viewing the artist. Guess that's what 360 degree was all about - spreading the concert-party like an airborne virus to everyone who attended. The blu-ray was pretty much identical to the concert that I saw, sure it's dark, but it was dark OUTSIDE; this concert was not inside an enclosed arena with lighting, e.g., Madison Square Garden, so I think whoever filmed, watched and edited the blu-ray copy met his or her goal - to make the viewer feel as if they're part of the show. When I watched the 360 degree concert on blu-ray, it was just as phenomenal as being one of the 61,500 sold-out screaming fans at Soldier Field. Yes, there are some trippy moments on the blu-ray, especially when they sang Vertigo. I felt as if I was experiencing equilibrium issues, the spins from too much of da sauce and vertigo all from the comfort of my sofa - AND IT WAS TOTALLY COOL!  Did I mention the singing? U2 sounds identical live as they do on radio/blu-ray/dvd/whatever your medium which is always a treat. Their lyrics and music are extremely powerful, uplifting, compelling and makes you feel blessed just to hear simple words strung together to create the most unprecedented imaginative vocal utterances in song. The power of the pen that they use while writing their songs must set the paper ablaze. I also must write that the creative genius who dreamt of the stage and lighting for the concert should receive some serious recognition - it was the most amazing concert stage setup I've seen to date. The additional footage of the blu-ray contain moments from other locations where the concerts took place. The sound is perfecto and the setup options on blu-ray are pretty cool too. Only thing is, when they performed in Chicago, they sang at least 3 other songs - Gone, Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me and I Will Follow - and these songs are not on the blu-ray. Yet this blu-ray concert is completely worth adding to your musical collection.",1323129600,,2274,4.573529411764706
4114242,3,B003ELOQD4,"This review is for the Blu-Ray edition. I really think a high school team could have done a better job with this footage, I know I could have. Lets start with the gripes 1/ Doesn't auto-start in my Blu-Ray nor did any button on my universal remote start it. The Blu-Ray remote had a 'disk menu' button that I found worked to start it. Only disc I've had to do this with. 2/ Lots of bonus features but each one dumps you back to the main menu(scroll to bonus's, scroll to find the bonus you want, press enter) Other discs I've had queue up the next bonus(press enter)Really aggrivating after a bonus or two. 3/Special effects really don't enhance the effort. I didn't buy a Blu-Ray to watch dark, grainy scenes. I highly suspect that the DVD version is just as good. 4/ The concerts opening song is buried as a bonus??? That's not just weird but WRONG!. 5/ Editing wasn't bad but I feel a lot of ambience of the show could have been shown to better effect. Not a major gripe though. 6/ On a personal level I'm sad they don't play New Years Day or In The Name Of Love anymore. ITNOL is truly one of the great rock songs of all time & I miss it.
  The good news is this was one heck of a show. Great band, awesome staging, & huge crowd made me wish I had been there. Still worth buying, but U2 really have to look somewhere else for video production. Other concert video's I've watched don't usually leave me shaking my head & muttering about amateurs.",1322352000,2,1449,4.265454545454546
4114243,4,B003ELOQD4,"A few months ago, U2 wrapped up the 360 Tour, a tour that at one point seemed like it was going to go on forever. Stretching from 2009 to 2011, the tour played around the world to mostly sold out stadiums. Not many bands or artists can pull off a truly enjoyable stadium show, but to make sure that this would be a musical and visual experience the fans would never forget, U2 brought along a 5th band member, created just for this tour: the ""Claw"". Mounted in the middle of the stadium, it is just gigantic, and an integral part of the show.

""U2 360 Live at the Rose Bowl"" (23 tracks; 130 min.) brings the complete show from October 25, 2009 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The set list runs 23 songs, including about half of the then-new album ""No Line on the Horizon"". For me, it is extremely important for concert DVDs like this one that the editing doesn't go overboard ""MTV-style"" (if MTV actually played any music videos anymore), and on that level this is a decent result. Yes, there are some tracks (such as ""Vertigo""), where the switching of camera-angles every second or so is just dizzying. I was surprised as well that the Claw isn't featured more prominently in this DVD. But overall, this is an enjoyable and pleasant souvenir if you caught U2 on this tour (I saw them at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta just a few weeks before this show).

One final comment: I couldn't help but compare this to the ""Zoo TV Live from Sydney"" DVD, which was filmed 17 years before the ""360"" DVD. Incredibly, even though both sets run a generous 23 songs, there is only an overlap of 4 songs between the two (One, Mysterious Ways, Where the Streets Have No Name, With or Without You). It just shows how much U2 has reinvented itself over the years, and keeps moving forward.",1321056000,,1766,4.414110429447852
4114244,2,B003ELOQD4,"I want to premise this review with the proviso that I have seen U2 live on every tour since The Joshua Tree (with the exception of the Lovetown Tour), sometimes twice in the same tour.  I have all of the concert DVDs, and I have seen a lot of bootlegs.  In short, I am a big fan.  That said, I have three different problems with this DVD.

First, there is the band.  U2's performances have been going slowly downhill since 2001 (e.g., tempo of the older songs), and while the 360 Tour offered up a lot of songs that have not been done in years, Bono's vocals are really deteriorating (e.g., Ultraviolet).  And then there is the random mix of songs that just don't go that well together - just for the sake of having a mixed up setlist every night.  Long gone are the carefully constructed setlists that actually had some flow to them (e.g., ZooTV and PopMart).  One thing that I used to look forward to in subsequent U2 tours was re-working older songs (e.g., The Fly on the Elevation Tour, Discotheque on the Vertigo Tour, Bullet the Blue Sky on ZooTV Tour).  For the first time ever, I can safely say I cannot name a single song from the catalog that was done significantly different on this tour (e.g., Elevation complete with intro and acoustic Stuck in a Moment, same as last time).

Second, there is the stage set.  ZooTV and PopMart were big, but big with a purpose or a message.  Apparently, the message here is: we are all taking off in a claw-shaped spaceship?  THAT has something to do with 'No Line on the Horizon' or any song on that new record?  Furthermore, the video accompaniments to the songs enhanced the experience in prior shows since 1992, but in continuing the trend begun in 2001, most of the video is now devoted to giving everybody in a huge stadium a closer look.

Third, there is the DVD package itself.  The omission of the first song from the concert from the concert film itself (it's an extra on Disk 2) - ""Breathe"" - is inexplicable.  With the lights up, Larry Mullen, Jr. walks out alone to the drum kit and begins the drum solo.  Great moment - lost.  In fact, overall I was not thrilled with the editing or the cold camera work.

Did any of you people who gave this DVD glowing reviews actually watched 'Under a Blood Red Sky,' 'Rattle & Hum', 'ZooTV Live in Sidney', 'PopMart Live in Mexico City,' or even 'Elevation Live from Boston' recently?  In doing so, I cannot believe you wouldn't find this DVD to be depressing.  U2 are starting to resemble the post-1980s Rolling Stones.",1320537600,,2517,4.461706783369803
4114245,2,B003ELOQD4,"The worst performance i saw of U2, it seems like the band doesn't want to play anymore...sorry folks but for me it has to be the End !!!!!!!

4114246,5,B003ELOQD4,"I had the pleasure to see this show Live in Los Angeles 2011. This DVD is an incredible example of how great a live concert DVD can be. The huge size and scale are well depicted while we as the audience are drawn into an intimate performance by U2. This is a concert DVD for anyone who enjoys incredible production design, energy, color, movement and great sound. If you are a U2 Fan, you simply can't do without it. The staging is among the most technologically advanced ever devised and it's transformations are beautifully executed. One will never be disappointed by this DVD. I was a mild fan. This DVD put me over the top. I'm a fan now. Well done, boys!",1317859200,,659,4.409836065573771
4114247,5,B003ELOQD4,"Can't imagine what so many people were complaining about in terms of the overall production of this DVD?!  I guess it's paced a bit too quickly for some, but frankly I thoroughly enjoyed the intelligent integration of so many different camera angles.  The quality of picture varies from camera to camera, so some are grainy while others are crisp, but the color is consistent on everything, which is the most important thing to keep it from feeling jarring.  I own many, many concert dvd/bluray discs, from Woodstock and Monterey to The Last Waltz and Shine a Light and the sound is as good if not BETTER than the greatest sounding concert DVD's I've ever heard.  Rich.  Full.  Detailed.  Quite a feat considering this was recorded in an outdoor stadium, not in a club or indoor venue.  As for the concert itself, I couldn't be more pleased.  It's U2 at their best, with every member performing brilliantly.  The grandness of the presentation is capture beautifully by the crane camera and the intimate moments of facial expressions, instrument playing and crowd reaction are there too.  Those who criticize this are entitled to their views, because after all, this is an artistic endeavor, but in my humble opinion those disparaging comments have committed a disservice by inhibiting others from experiencing this truly wonderful gem.",1316822400,2,1335,4.995475113122172
4114248,3,B003ELOQD4,I was here so I had to order it. But I was kind of surprised at the filming of it. It's not my favorite. It's probably my least favorite live U2 dvd.,1315353600,,149,3.6875

4114250,4,B003ELOQD4,"By all means, U2 360 looks set to be a fantastic concert. The fabulous set list, the venue from space and a rocket ready to launch.

The first two times that I watched this, I felt a disconnect. Perhaps I had not listened to No Line On The Horizon, from which many songs were performed. It could also be the uneven pacing of the songs. It veers from fast to slow and then fast to slow again. The final reason being the disorientated editing on the first few minutes that put some Amazon reviewers off.

I'm glad to say that on the third viewing, I thought that U2 360 was actually a very good show, just a more mellow one. And the setting; a ""spaceship"" with spider-like claws provides the out of this earth feel. The center of the ship beams out the concert to the back rows.

Look out for U2's tribute to Burma's democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi in Walk On. The stadium collectively puts on her face as a show of solidarity. The last three encores also features Bono dangling from a mike and he sings while twirling around. U2 still knows how to wow the crowd.

Initially, there appears to be are no extras on the single DVD edition. Only a space age menu greets you if activated. I was fiddling with the DVD remote and discovered this. Go to either Audio Set Up or Track Selection and press the left arrow button.  A short film called 21 Days featuring rehearsals and people setting up the stage will appear. Other bonus features and documentary have been saved for the deluxe, super deluxe and what-have-you editions.",1314921600,,1520,4.414285714285715
4114251,1,B003ELOQD4,"I am a huge U2 fan but how U2 could have authorized the release of this pile of #@%^ is beyond me.  I am wondering what happened to the band that rocked Slane Castle?  I won't rehash all of the negative reviews that slammed the video and editing as they were spot on.  Blu-ray?  Puh-lease.  DTS sound and video on Live at Slane Castle was mind blowing, as was the performance and set-list selection by U2.  Unfortunately that was not the case with this concert and you can really tell that this was the end of the 360 tour because they all looked and sounded tired.  My hat is off to the engineering and logistics that went into the set and production.  I can't imagine what that probably cost and took to haul that thing around from concert to concert.  Hopefully the guys get some much deserved rest, fire whomever talked them into this over-the-top circus set approach and come back out with a real Blu-ray experience that we don't have to throw into the 'I want my money back' DVD pile.",1314489600,2,990,4.395604395604396

4114254,4,B003ELOQD4,"Having gone to the actual U2 Rose Bowl concert in 2009, it was inevitable that I would pick up this Blu Ray of the concert.

The quality of the concert is very beautiful.  The lighting and special effects through were done very well. I loved the use of the blues and reds throughout.  The sound is good, but better when the volume is turned up with the surround sound.

The extras are great.  You get 3 music videos from their ""No Line on the Horizon"" album along with the makings of, various concert clips from other cities, and other web based goodies.

I will say though my only grip with the concert Blu Ray was having actually been there, I was a little disappointed that the songs were edited out of order.  When initially starting the film, ""Get on Your Boots"" started to play, and my reaction was that of ""That wasn't what they played first....""  I did enjoy the overall presentation though, despite songs being out of order.  I also didn't like how the beginning was edited.  The crowd shots were nice, but I was disappointed with the fact that they didn't keep the original opening of the band making it to the stage while David Bowie's song ""Ground Control to Major Tom"" played.  It is on the extas, but it would've been nice to add that in.  They also maybe should've added the actual Youtube video in the extras.

Overall this was a great Blu Ray and it still was able to bring me back to that night.",1311552000,,1413,4.388461538461539

4114256,3,B003ELOQD4,"I am an avid U2 fan, having loved their tunes after falling in love with Mysterious Ways as an 8 or 9 year old back in 1991. My first album was Zooropa, and I was the only person in my circle-of-friends who actually liked (and still likes!) Pop. I lost touch of them after I couldn't score tix for the Elevation Tour, and found them after buying their Atomic Bomb album with a gift card given me as a Christmas gift from a former boss. I saw them on the Vertigo Tour in Atlanta with my best friend and his dad, about 10-feet from the b-side ramp. Edge playing his Until the End of the World solo and the band ending the night with Bad were my two main highlights.

Fast forward a few years, and to No Line On the Horizon. Personally, I think it is their best, most realised album since Achtung Baby (my personal favorite). So, when my mom called me to say that she scored 4 tix for us to see the opening North American show in Chicago---stating, ""Who's the most kickass mom in the world!!!""---I was stoked beyond belief. And, rightfully so. In a word, the show was epic. Almost overwhelmingly so (they spontaneously ended the main set with Bad, for crying out loud!).

So here we are at this dvd, which is the closest I have to a memento from my Chicago show. Minus the absence of Bad, I think the Rose Bowl setlist is overall better.  (The band later adding Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me and swapping I Will Follow and New Years Day depending on the night is even better!).  On this dvd, the band performs with uncanny energy, and Bono's is more consistently strong throughout than on most of their recent dvds.

So, what are my two quibbles? The first has been voiced by many below: editing Breath out of its opening slot. It may not be the best opener, but the martial drums starting things off sent such intense shivers down my spine in Chicago that it is an utter shame that Get On Your Boots has been relegated as the opener. Second, the audience volume is turned WAYYYY too low for much of this recording. At Chicago, the audience singing along was audible for the majority of the show, particularly for Still Haven't Found, Bad, Sunday Bloody Sunday, Pride and With Or Without You (the same can be said for Atlanta on the Vertigo Tour). Even when the audience is turned up, it sounds too weak. Compare the video of Breath on the bonus disc to the main dvd. Compare the audience in the ZOOTV dvd, particularly when Bono prowls the ramp during Until the End of the World.

Overall, this dvd is epic, and despite my beefs, I recommend it! 3.5 stars!",1310860800,,2558,4.352201257861635

360 is a one of the most powerful concerts from what should be the best band in the world. The concert plays music from 5 decades of solid hits, is visually delicious and the music is superb. I especially liked the re-mix of I'll go Crazy Tonight with cuban rythms, its fantastic.

I LOVE watching concerts...every aspect of them...the interaction of the band, the music, how they interact with the crowds, the musicianship of each member...etc...

When Editors do all the FAST/FRANTIC/QUICK/SHORT edits...it takes AWAY from the video experience.

This obviously was an AMAZING & INCREDIBLE show from one of the greatest live bands ever. U2 can rock a stadium and have the whole crowd into the show like no other band.

That's why it hurts to say that their last couple of DVDs (including the one from Chicago) have too many 'jerky' and frantic edits.

The 4 guys of U2 and their music are EXCITING ENOUGH without all the dizzying edits.

...that's why I was so disappointed in this DVD. I'm going to keep it b/c I love U2, but I hope they change their future concerts to something more enjoyable to watch.

I wish they could even do another camera angles or alternative edits feature, so you could choose if you wanted... or maybe they could reissue with a 'director's cut' ...LOL.

4114267,1,B003ELOQD4,"I saw U2 at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1992 and previously owned Rattle And Hum on blu ray, so I thought ""why not pick up their latest tour in blu-ray quality?"" The answer is ""Because the video quality is ok, the audio quality is great, but U2's performance itself is TERRIBLE""

I nabbed this when it went on sale for $10 thinking there was no harm in spending that on it. But U2's actual performance is so bad that I know I'll never watch it again and that to me is a waste of $10. I prefer to re-watch Rattle & Hum or remember the performance I saw in '92 when the actual band cared about what they were doing. Note to Bono; singing off time and slightly off key only works when there's genuine passion behind what you're doing. It NEVER works when you're doing it for show, real music fans know the difference.

If you have Rattle And Hum or have seen U2 previously, avoid this release like the plague. The ONLY way I could see this warranting a purchase is if you were at this actual show (The Rose Bowl 360) and you want to see it again, though I cannot imagine why you would.",1302480000,5,1080,4.1875

My anticipation for this release was intense, especially after having seen U2 myself on the 360 tour. This production has outstanding audio quality, however the visual look and feel of this recording can only be called a disaster. It is so bad it is almost unwatchable at times. The bands' performance is top notch (the Youtube broadcast of this concert was thrilling) but the visual presentation of this DVD seemed designed to avoid allowing you to experience the soaring experience that is the 360 tour. Some of the faster paced songs are like watching the concert inside of a shaking snowglobe. I am begging the band to issue a second DVD that actually allows the experience of 360 to be enjoyed by the home viewer. A cursory view of this video by the band should have lead someone to say, ""Why is the whole concert shot out of focus?"" ""HD"" only works if you actually use it. Skip this release and download some of the Youtube amateur handheld video from fans.

4114272,5,B003ELOQD4,"I will start by saying that I have just about every Live U2 DVD released including the Slane Castle Gig, Sydney Australia, Mexico City, Chicago, Red Rocks & Milan.
The cinematography with switching & fades capturing the complexity of their songs at this Rose Bowl gig is PHENOMENAL!! Considering the scope and size of this 360 stage; the state of the art cameras flying and rotating bring you to a place that is simply unattainable from being there live and actually brings the ""concert experience"" or should I say Reexperience? to a whole new level.
Millions of people watched this unparalleled theatrical show live around the globe. It starts with a powerful, nearly flawless, version of ""Get on your Boots"" and ""Magnificent""  and encouraging performances of ""Beautiful Day"" ""In a little while"" ""until the end of the World"" (incredible Camera work) ""The unforgettable fire"", ""I'll go Crazy"" is enlightening. Later in the show a message to Iran, ""This is United States Calling"" to ""all who love freedom"" for those persecuted in Iranian prisons followed by an emotional version of ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" It is profound to see the fans singing along with ""Amazing grace"" leading into ""Where the streets have no name"" or witness music transcend politics and borders in SO Cal during ""Vertigo""... & wrapping up with an awesome version of ""Moment Of Surrender""
Each song performed that evening has it's own little story. No other band has been able to generate this type of global response & bring a genuine intimacy to this SIZE of a venue. It is really quite amazing and quite honestly super natural, in its own ""mysterious way""

Before watching this show I did not care too much for their new album... but now I am discovering new things about each song as I watch this memorable evening in 2009 that was captured on film.

Regarding poor reviews...
What the whiners do not understand (Now I know why Bono wrote the song with or without you) is that this show was in Los Angeles!! the whole concert is geared to honor Hollywood and LA! that includes special effects and color!!  and this is supposed to be through the eyes of a spaceship!
At the intro, the Ariel view of the Rose Bowl completely filled with a enormous crowd glowing in Neon Blue is unprecedented... People complaining about a ""grainy"" look to this HD concert? Maybe they did not notice that they used colored lighting almost exclusively?? HD is not going to have a ""SHARP"" picture you expect in this type of lighting environment!!
In my opinion it was refreshingly different, with almost surreal type effects the band & fans at times seem to glow in neon colors almost like a blend between Tron, Terminator and Fantasia!! The fast switching is executed between the musicians and the songs in a genius type manner, catching the emotions of the band and venue dancing back and forth between every note of their dynamic and ever changing music & melodies.
The audio recording & mixing with ""360"" surround in Dolby Digital is awesome!
After 30 years of singing Rock and Roll and touring more than any other band... I was impressed with Bono's voice, unbelievable energy & grace for this show.
Yes I too, can not wait for U23D live from Argentina to be released! But in the mean-time I am thoroughly enjoying this magic night that was captured at the Rose Bowl USA.",1301961600,6,3326,4.769097222222222

I have to admit that I had this feeling, this not-really-good feeling about the whole thing. The album was pretty much a disappointment to me, but that I was ready for. I thought ""hey, the album's a pretty weak one so they'll make it up to us with the tour."" But alas, they did not.

The editing leaves something to be desired, some of the takes look like they were not carefully planned, I'm not sure if the intention was to give the show an ""edgy"" feel or whatever but to me that did more damage than good, most of the time I failed at getting a sense of what was really going on up there. At least the sound was better than previous live performance releases.

The there's the band's performance itself. Don't get me wrong, I understand the guys are no longer in their prime but come on, Bono looks stressed, The Edge kind of struggles when he tries smile and look happy, Clayton was his usual self, and pretty much was Larry, but from watching the video I couldn't tell they were having a really good time. They all seemed to be just working, let's just get trough this, let's get done with it. If you've been to their shows, you know what I mean. I did not see that in this show, I did not see that connection, within themselves and with the crowd, that has bound the band together for so long.

The stage and its artifacts seem to be there to distract us from what's happening, there's not much aid from those elements to make it a better experience. Probably it's just the whole in-the-round thing. There's no band upfront, the members are scattered on a large area, maybe it's just too big, or the concert director intended to make it look that way. Of course some people will say they did the same thing with Popmart, but the Popmart performances were top notch, the stage was just that, the stage, not the main attraction.

Even counting the Burma and Iran things, there were no touching and/or special moments or some other things that got me. They did not play Bullet, they removed all feelings from Sunday Bloody Sunday, it was as if including the song was an afterthought. I'm all for rotating the setlist but if you're going to include Ultraviolet, do some justice to it, that's a magnificent track that was well underperformed, if you ask me.

The Unforgettable Fire was pretty much the highlight of the show for me.

Overall, I found this show to be one that I will not sit through again, but rather will have it playing on the background while doing some other thing. Like cleaning the house. And that's after having played a lot of other performances I own from U2 and other bands.

The concert itself is amazing and I think it authentically replicates any U2 show.  My complaints have already been addressed, but I'll rehash:

1) The video is too ""jumpy"".  The director of this video needs to realize that it is o.k., and even preferable to keep a camera shot longer than 5 seconds.  Watching this can make you sick to the stomach.  It's better to ""listen to this DVD"" as opposed to ""watching"" it.  Of course, different people have differnt tastes, so maybe some others like this.  so I can forgive them for this.

2) What is NOT unforgivable, and pretty stupid at that, is they cut out the first song of the show (""Breathe"").  Now, when I first heard that, I figured that maybe there were recording problems with the song.  Then I found out it's included as ""bonus"" material!  OK, now THINK about this.  The song is NOT in the show, but included SEPARATELY as a bonus??  This makes absolutely no sense.  If you were going to do something this stupid, why pick the first song??  This song shows the dramatic entrance by the band which was a crucial part of the show!  I really can't believe this idiotic decision was made.  I'm hoping to find the answer somewhere.  Incredibly idiotic.

Otherwise, great show.",1285200000,,1402,4.5951417004048585

I sat and watched this grinning like an idiot, singing away with Bono and the Edge. And the stage is really something to be seen- you just cannot describe it to someone.

4114311,1,B003ELOQD4,"... but with everything that's plagued these guys (even though they're still touring right now) in the last year, it just might be. That would be sad, if so.

The problems with this release:

I've been a U2 fan for a very long time. Bono already thanked me directly during the Slane tour for giving them $500 during the span of their career. I've probably given more, and I hate to have to qualify myself before I write this review, as I hope people read it with a clear mind, but it's true.

I think the more time passes, the more people expect from U2 and very likely the more U2 expect from themselves as well as a band. Most people when they tune into watching or listening to U2 want them to remain timeless, not age, play the same stuff perfectly and sound magnificent.

Unfortunately, this just isn't reality. Part of the problem is that U2 hasn't figured this out yet, either. Maybe it's the competitiveness of hearing the huge sums that the Rolling Stones pull in from their touring that keeps them coming back. I don't know. Honestly. But these last two DVD concerts, while they do look and sound better on some levels have really shown the truth about U2. I can't really knock U2 either because these guys have been on tour for the bulk of the last thirty years and that's no lie.

But sadly, Bono is really aging badly and very quickly. I hate to say it, but it must be said. Sure everyone ages, but it doesn't look like the guy is in a great shape anymore. He's heavily winded during most of the concert, out of breath many times, doesn't have the vocal range of even 2001-2004 and the 'gimmicks' he used to employ to get him going during concerts like doing laps around the huge circle just don't get it. The long political dialogues front-ending songs, which must be brutal for the Edge and the boys, which also used to give Bono a short rest from singing during the concert, also don't really have the same heart in them. These monologues now lack sincerity and just come across as real over-rehearsed bloviation. I wish it was different, but from where I'm sitting, it isn't.

1. This DVD is 1080i not 1080p. Packaging it as Blu-Ray is badly misleading and shameful. I've been hoping for a Blu-Ray release for sometime, but not like this.

2. The editing of this is pretty uninspired and the shots they used as transitions were just awful.

3. I watched this live on Youtube, for those that might remember that it was also streamed live that night, and this just doesn't feel or sound like the same concert.

4. Bono's 'soapboxing' is probably at its worst here. I almost feel like someone is purposefully trying to repackage all this music to fit in as the soundtrack of the day and not the soundtrack of our lives as it has been. I almost feel like I'm being robbed. Placing this music into new contexts with speeches about current Government misdoings just makes a listener sad. The whole An San Suu Kyi piece should've been moving, but it wasn't. Even at home, alone, it was just uncomfortable.

5. On the DVD, I really couldn't pin down any really inspirational performances here. Larry, Adam and the Edge were all on the money, but I think the front man really let them down. There was no 'All I want is you/Where the Streets' moment like on Slane.

6. Making Breathe a bonus track instead of the opening is just plain wrong.

7. The opening menu wasn't as seamless and intuitive as previous versions and several times while bouncing around from song to song the thing reset itself and started over. The opening menu was so convoluted that it's more of a hindrance than anything artful or cool.

I was really looking forward to this DVD for quite some time but it just didn't win me over. I usually play along with these U2 concert DVD's the best I can, but I couldn't find the heart in this show. If you catch the facial expressions of Larry and The Edge, several times they seem not just frustrated but a bit mad. I might be too.

I think the real lesson here is basic. My suggestions for U2 and what they should do regarding concerts in the future or at least for awhile, is only opinion. Take all of this as you may. I'm only a fan and a consumer and not an authority. It seems wrong to suggest anything.

1. U2 should tone down these huge spectacles and preform smaller venues or do a smaller circuit. David Bowie did this and was incredibly successful at it. During his Heathen Tour he strictly played the 5 Burroughs in NY and played the clubs. People talked about seeing Bowie like this as his finest hour. U2 should to do this for awhile as all of their performances in smaller settings are typically phenomenal and very moving. Even their SNL, David Letterman, Jules Holland, et al, shows on Youtube are mind blowing. It's difficult to deny this.

2. They should focus on releasing more intimate and personal DVD's  that really capture the essence of the band. The Documentary on ""The Unforgettable Fire' that's on Slane is incredible. Sting, yes, Sting ... has released several DVD's where he filmed a few concerts at his house and they're very good. Even if you don't like Sting, The Police or that kind of music, it's hard to knock it and his level of honesty during filming is quite shocking. Sting's last DVD at Durham Cathedral was remarkable. The second disk was a camera following him around in his home town and was very moving. U2 should put something like that together. I don't know who wouldn't be enthralled.

3. An acoustic package like the second disc from the HTDAAB release is long overdue. Hearing these songs in their most raw and broken down form greatly eclipse these uninspired performances from this show or the last one from Chicago.

Look, I've posted a lot of U2 reviews through the years, some critical, some praising. I don't mean to say anything negative about Bono either. If you read this, Bono, please don't think I'm an ungrateful upstart. Not many people can do what you do or what you've done, so I won't pretend to think it's easy for a moment. We are all going to get older and begin to crumble. Some of us work at keeping it together harder than others. I don't know how hard you have to work or what more you have to do and I know you probably work a lot harder than I do. Whatever road you guys are going down, I hope it's the right one and not a direction that keeps putting out stuff like this. Some of us will probably turn away.

In truth, I'm not going to say I'm not going to buy anymore U2 DVD's, because I will. I buy guitar equipment because of you guys and microphones, too. I buy books about U2 (and Bono) and I read them. I've seen you in concert and probably will again if I get the chance and can afford the tickets. I still buy U2 T-shirts and other stuff and probably always will. U2 has some of the most dedicated fans out there and I'm one of them. People love you for the music and the inspiration. I'd say play to that.

4114318,3,B003ELOQD4,"Ok, first the positives:

The sound on this DVD is amazing. Playing this on my home theater system made me feel like I was back at the concert, which in the case of U2 is always a good thing. The video is also extremely sharp and clear.

Now, the negatives:

Ugh. I really hate to criticize this DVD because U2 is my favorite band in the world that still tours and makes music. However, I was at this show and it just doesn't capture what it was like to be there. I know that is an extremely difficult thing to do for a concert video, but U2 has done that before for their concert recordings. If you want proof, look at the ZooTV recording from Australia. Now, I wasn't there for that show, but I did see the outdoor performances in Los Angeles and in Oakland. Watching the ZooTV concert, even though the setlist had changed a little by the time the show reached Australia, felt like I was reliving the shows I'd seen. I was able to turn that video on and show friends what I had been raving about for months. There was a 'this is what it was like' feel to the camera work for that concert and you were able to get an idea of the magnitude of what the ZooTV experience was like. This is SORELY lacking in the 360 DVD. Again, I realize that because the claw was so huge, the DVD only watching crowd would never fully be able to experience what it was like to be in the presence of the claw. But if the editing had just lingered on the claw from distance for more than 2-3 seconds, if there had been a few audience level shots from different points of view from the stadium that maybe lasted 10 seconds or so, then maybe, just maybe, people would have gotten a feel for what it was like to be there. Bombastically over-the-top though the claw was, and rightly or wrongly, many have said the claw detracted from the intimacy of a U2 show, it was a technological marvel to witness and should have been given its 'time in the sun' for this recording. To be completely honest, the worldwide youtube broadcast of the Rose Bowl show was a much better indicator of what it was like to be there. I guess they figured they couldn't just clean up the audio and release that on DVD, but I would much rather own that than this DVD.

Secondly, no Breathe to open the concert? Seriously? Look, always one of the the greatest moments in a U2 show is the dramatic buildup to the opening song. The salvo fired across the bow of the U2 fan that begins a U2 show is crucial. Any U2 fan worth his salt can tell you the opening song of the various U2 tours, it sets the tone for the whole show. Not including Breathe on the setlist except as, essentially, a 'deleted scene' section on disk 2 of the product is completely ridiculous. Not to mention the fact that the reason this was done was stupendously stupid to begin with, the tension created, the way the band was introduced during Breathe, plus the fact that Breathe is simply a kickass song...I don't know, it just boggles the mind.

Thirdly, I brought this up before a little, but the editing, YIKES! Watching this DVD makes me want to kill Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay, you know those guys. The idiots who brought you Armageddon, Con-Air, the Transformers movies, etc. These cinematic delinquents have nearly ruined movie going with the quick-cut editing style that seems to be the formula for big-budget action movies. This editing style makes you worried that you'll start having an epileptic seizure in the movie because the scene changes so quickly. Well, U2 360 is not as bad as some of those movies, but almost. Sometimes the cuts are so quick between Bono, the Edge, Adam and Larry that you start to think maybe they are only one person and not four. Throw the Ang San Suu Kyi masks into the mix and you seriously might think you are losing your mind.

In the end, would I recommend this 360 DVD to others? It's a hard case to make. If you are a U2 fan that wants to be complete and own the visual record of each tour available, then yes. If you didn't get to see 360 and want to get an idea of what 360 was like, i'd say rent it. As for me, I've had this since 2 days after it came out and have only watched it once and I doubt I'll watch it many more times. I'd watch ZooTV, Slane Castle, Red Rocks, heck even U2 in Chicago over watching this, and as a diehard U2 fan, that's tough to say.",1280880000,,4338,4.2777101096224115

My major disappointment is with the audio engineering.  I was very excited to hear this in high-def Bluray format, but the sound mixing is just horrible.

Always the camera shot you want to see at every moment, including lots of great aerials to give a sense of the size of ""the claw"" staging in the stadium.  And the audio mix (which has been suspect on previous U2 live releases) is outstanding.

The performance is good, not great.  What 'elevates' a U2 show above others is an emotional connection between the band and audience, and I never got a sense of that watching this gig.  If anything, Bono in particular seems to make a greater effort to connect with the onstage cameras than with actual people.  I realize this is intentional, since 90% of the live audience is watching the giant screen anyway, but there's a magic that happens when the band physically interact with their fans - and that didn't happen on this night.

My other minor problem is the setlist.  I'm not a fan of the album being promoted (No Line On The Horizon), so I find myself skipping those songs in the show - except the rave-up remix of ""I'll Go Crazy..."", which is a highlight.

4114338,3,B003ELOQD4,"Ok, first the positives:

The sound on this DVD is amazing. Playing this on my home theater system made me feel like I was back at the concert, which in the case of U2 is always a good thing. The video is also extremely sharp and clear.

Now, the negatives:

Ugh. I really hate to criticize this DVD because U2 is my favorite band in the world that still tours and makes music. However, I was at this show and it just doesn't capture what it was like to be there. I know that is an extremely difficult thing to do for a concert video, but U2 has done that before for their concert recordings. If you want proof, look at the ZooTV recording from Australia. Now, I wasn't there for that show, but I did see the outdoor performances in Los Angeles and in Oakland. Watching the ZooTV concert, even though the setlist had changed a little by the time the show reached Australia, felt like I was reliving the shows I'd seen. I was able to turn that video on and show friends what I had been raving about for months. There was a 'this is what it was like' feel to the camera work for that concert and you were able to get an idea of the magnitude of what the ZooTV experience was like. This is SORELY lacking in the 360 DVD. Again, I realize that because the claw was so huge, the DVD only watching crowd would never fully be able to experience what it was like to be in the presence of the claw. But if the editing had just lingered on the claw from distance for more than 2-3 seconds, if there had been a few audience level shots from different points of view from the stadium that maybe lasted 10 seconds or so, then maybe, just maybe, people would have gotten a feel for what it was like to be there. Bombastically over-the-top though the claw was, and rightly or wrongly, many have said the claw detracted from the intimacy of a U2 show, it was a technological marvel to witness and should have been given its 'time in the sun' for this recording. To be completely honest, the worldwide youtube broadcast of the Rose Bowl show was a much better indicator of what it was like to be there. I guess they figured they couldn't just clean up the audio and release that on DVD, but I would much rather own that than this DVD.

Secondly, no Breathe to open the concert? Seriously? Look, always one of the the greatest moments in a U2 show is the dramatic buildup to the opening song. The salvo fired across the bow of the U2 fan that begins a U2 show is crucial. Any U2 fan worth his salt can tell you the opening song of the various U2 tours, it sets the tone for the whole show. Not including Breathe on the setlist except as, essentially, a 'deleted scene' section on disk 2 of the product is completely ridiculous. Not to mention the fact that the reason this was done was stupendously stupid to begin with, the tension created, the way the band was introduced during Breathe, plus the fact that Breathe is simply a kickass song...I don't know, it just boggles the mind.

Thirdly, I brought this up before a little, but the editing, YIKES! Watching this DVD makes me want to kill Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay, you know those guys. The idiots who brought you Armageddon, Con-Air, the Transformers movies, etc. These cinematic delinquents have nearly ruined movie going with the quick-cut editing style that seems to be the formula for big-budget action movies. This editing style makes you worried that you'll start having an epileptic seizure in the movie because the scene changes so quickly. Well, U2 360 is not as bad as some of those movies, but almost. Sometimes the cuts are so quick between Bono, the Edge, Adam and Larry that you start to think maybe they are only one person and not four. Throw the Ang San Suu Kyi masks into the mix and you seriously might think you are losing your mind.

In the end, would I recommend this 360 DVD to others? It's a hard case to make. If you are a U2 fan that wants to be complete and own the visual record of each tour available, then yes. If you didn't get to see 360 and want to get an idea of what 360 was like, i'd say rent it. As for me, I've had this since 2 days after it came out and have only watched it once and I doubt I'll watch it many more times. I'd watch ZooTV, Slane Castle, Red Rocks, heck even U2 in Chicago over watching this, and as a diehard U2 fan, that's tough to say.",1278460800,10,4338,4.2777101096224115

4114340,5,B003ELOQD4,"U2 360 is the best U2 concert video to date.  The camera angles and clarity help you feel as though you are at the concert.  I know this because I attended two of their concerts.  The extras help explain the philosophy of building the ""spaceship"" in order to attempt to increase intimacy in a large, outdoor venue.  Like all U2 videos/dvds, it's the music that has the most impact.  After 30 years, U2 remains at the top of their game and the most important band in the world for the 3 decades.  I can't wait to watch it again.  The only thing I would have changed would be to put ""Breathe"" on the main dvd since this was the actual song that they opened with on tour. At least they included it on the extras dvd.  I recommend this package for anyone who enjoys live rock music.  It'll take some of the sting out of having the third leg of the tour cancelled due to Bono's back problems (get well soon, Bono!).",1278374400,2,910,4.244186046511628

You really get it when you see them live and can expect the spiritual experience only us fans truly know or understand.

Those of us die hard fans know U2 for who they are as human beings, not only the biggest band in the world.  Bono's soul was spilled out again here as he gives us the audience, his all. What can you say about the the claw other than it's a totally innovative uniquely U2 idea that no other entertainer or act has ever accomplished in the industry! They are ground breakers with a mission. Thank you Bono, Edge, Adam and Larry for this performance of a lifetime! This show felt meloncholy for me as the segway from the stellar UltraViolet---With or Without You felt like a permanent farewell to the character we all know as The Fly.
I hope this isn't the U2 farewell tour without announing a farewell.

I seriously don't see how this could have been shot on HD equipment. The difference between this and the Springsteen concert is like the difference between a DVD and a VHS tape. Heck, The Who, Live at Kilburn, which was shot 33 years ago looks better than this. Strangely, some of the bonus material (specifically the making of feature)is of far better resolution. The 2011 leg of the tour, where the band replaced some of the weaker new material with songs from Achtung Baby and Zooropa was far better.

The collection of songlist spanned back to 1983 to current and most importantly, the video and sound quality of this Blueray is superb!

When I say this, I think back on U2 Live from Mexico City where the excited roar of the crowd drowned out the band in the background through musical passages of the performance and was absolutely annoying. Here you see U2 at the top of their game with great video quality, camera angles, and especially great sound. A must have for any U2 fan.",1277856000,,717,4.37593984962406

Are you guys using the composite cable that came with your player or something?

Audio (specifically the DTS-MA 5.1 track) is of superb quality.  The details in Edge's guitar work is great to hear!  Audience ambience is nice, but does not compete with the performances.

As for the 1080i video, it is important to use the best deinterlacing component in your setup. At first I was letting my BDP-320 Pioneer player do the job, but I was getting some judder, so I switched the player to Source Direct (a feature ALL blu-ray players should have!) and my VIZIO sv470xvt1a LCD TV surprisingly did an excellent job.

OMG the amount of shaking there is in this video is just amazing.  There is some massive jerking going on in this video.  The video is not smooth at all.  Very very poor quality considering this is the biggest band in the world right now.  My theory on this, well here goes:  As you know this show was broadcast live on YouTube and and I think they just used the same cameras for this release.  I was next to one of the cameras and believe they were not exactly the HD cameras you see ESPN crews using.

Anyways sound wise it is decent, but video quality wise it just appears that it is buffering all the time.",1277424000,,740,4.111888111888112
4114358,1,B003ELOQD4,"I gave up watching this after a pretty short while.  I left it play in the background though and enjoyed the concert (the sound that is)!  I later skipped throughout the whole video to confirm what I already knew.  The filming is horrible!  The camera jumps from one thing to another constantly every 3 seconds.  You cannot watch a friggin thing the entire show.  It's like closing your eyes and opening them every 5 seconds while being spin around.  It flashes from Bono, to the audience, to The Edge, the drummer, flashes of video that change so often and last so little, you get dizzy!  Sadly this seems to be a trend because ANOTHER video of a band I like Spandau Ballet reunion tour 2009 was filmed almost the same exact way.  I backed off on going to concerts in the 90's when ticket prices started to shoot up close to $100.  The Eagles seemed to start that trend.  I seen almost 100 shows however from 1985 to 1995 when prices were cheap and all levels of tickets were released to the public.  It was a GREAT time to see all the bands I ever loved, multiple times in many cases.  There wasn't much need to watch videos and DVDs.  But since than I have caught on DVD the groups I wanted to catch a tour of, but didn't want to spend $100-$200 for a ticket.  Now they are starting to ruin that with this stupid kind of filming.  Another problem with live shows that may not bother some people is that they crank up the volume to match Deep Purples old record in the 70's.  But when they film a DVD or live show, they cant do that because the recording would be distorted!  So instead they are distorting the filming, shame on them!",1277337600,3,1636,4.308196721311475
4114359,2,B003ELOQD4,"Having been to the Boston/Foxboro 360 show, I was pumped to see that this DVD had been released and couldn't wait to relive the show.  Bottom line is that this looks like a 2 hour commercial or a music video.  The director and/or producers are not at all concerned with attempting to document what it was like to see this amazing concert but make it a point to show us what fancy editing and camera magic they can do.  It is ""cleaned up"" so much that you can't even hear the audience at all for the majority of the show.  The only thing good about this DVD is the setlist, but it is painful to watch.  Hopefully, the band releases another DVD of this tour and direct the director to make it more realistic looking with some great shots from a crowd standpoint.  There is not even an intro segment that shows the amazing stage in light, the gigantic crowd, or the band even coming on stage.

This show, I believe, is the one that was broadcast over Youtube and it was amazing.  A real mix of new and old songs.  This set also comes with the tour program, as well as those fun extras that we've all come to know and love. I'm not going to rehash what's in the set.  Sure, you don't really need U2 guitar picks, but for the cost of the whole set, it's kind of fun to have.  The set is beautifully packaged and the materials are good quality.  The hardback book is kind of cool too, plus a single called ""Soon.""  I have not listened to it yet. But it's U2, so most likely, I'll like it.

I'm not sure what it is that left the concert looking worse - perhaps the style of the director? Whatever the cause, an otherwise great concert was left a little unsatisfying - simply because it did not live up to the blu-ray possibilities.

I've always appreciated when they've reinvented their sound (well, maybe not on Pop) and am even a big fan of No Line ... (and it seems like I'm in the minority here). But, when I saw them in New York last year, I couldn't believe it was the same band. The sound was absolutely terrible and the performance was so lacking that, for the first time, I regretted spending tons of money to get great U2 tickets. I've never seen a band just go through the motions the way they did that night. I understand that they're getting older and all that (by the way, not an excuse - look at Metallica), but a band in their position owes it to the fans to maintain the standard they've been setting for the last 25+ years. Sadly, U2 didn't do that on the last tour and definitely not on this DVD - while the sound is ok, the rest of it comes off like a cheap cash grab.",1276819200,3,966,4.1436170212765955

What I wanted out of this video is something that would be a momento of that tour, regardless of the fact that this DVD was at the end of the tour, the setlist is similar and of course the show and band were fantastic.

I put this disk in the player only to find that some marketing genius decided it would be a good idea to SKIP THE FIRST f-ing song!!!!! When you go to a show there's a sense of excitement and build-up as the entrance music plays, as the band takes the stage, and as the first few riffs of the first song bounce off the audience creating that huge wave of joy. This video doesn't represent the tour as I remember it simply by the fact they cut all of that out and went to the second song.

I understand they are trying to push the HD/Blu-ray medium, and they included Breathe as a bonus feature, but to edit it out of the beginning of the main presentation just suck in every way.

I have viewed the past two U2 releases...'Vertigo 2005' and The Elevation Tour from Boston, both filmed by Hamish Hamilton, whose editing is quite annoying. But with the new 'Rose Bowl' video, I was pleasantly surprised. The editing wasn't as bad as the previous videos listed, the sound is very good, and my only complaint is the editing of their now famous intro and the performance of 'Breathe'. Aside from this, the dvd is actually very good, with the exception of the ending of 'Moment of Surrender' and we should be watching U2 taking their bows and walking off stage. Instead, we are transported back into the spaceship and the credits roll.

If you want to see a great opening, I mean 'Space Oddity' playing from the very beginning, as you hear a fan state....'Here we go'...go to YouTube...type in U2 Dallas..then scroll down until you see U2 Dallas-10/12/2009-Intro & Breathe. The length is 10:24. Trust me, this is a very good version of the intro and song. Watch this first, then right after, start the dvd.

Get well soon Bono!!",1276473600,16,1208,4.77511961722488
4114372,4,B003ELOQD4,"Middle of August, 2008, Red Rocks. My wife and I had Allman Brothers tickets. Looking forward to a ""Blue Sky"" boogie - instead we were hunkered down, hypothermic in horizontal rain and 45 degrees. The optimist in me feared a similar story for the concert of the year, U2, 360, Denver (just about the only thing I can imagine that would get me to set foot inside Mile High). Well I was right about the weather - it's snowing in the mountains above the city tonight. It didn't matter though, Bono blew his back out at the end of May and the gig was postponed for a year.

Now these tickets were a wee bit pricier than I'm used to paying. First I had to join U2.com to get a one day advantage over the masses. It did work though. I was able to get 4 nice seats for less than you would pay to watch grown men in Howard Johnson suits stand up and fall down in the same stadium. That was last October however, nine months before the show. Now make it 21.

Hey, no concert, no problem. Instead I went shopping. Took a 10% off coupon to Best Buy, grabbed myself a Blue Ray and a free BR disc of my choice, which just happened to be be"" ""U2 360 At The Rose Bowl"". Out with the old, in with the new, DVD players that is and we were ready to crank up the amps. It was ""Magnificent""!
What a set! What a play list! My were they on that night. The sound was stupendous, but the film editor has to go. If you didn't have ""Vertigo"" before you pushed ""play"" on your remote you would shortly. In the first 15 minutes the average camera shot lasted less than two seconds. It made the frenetic madness of MTV look calm in comparison. The producers and film editors apparently didn't take any of the criticism of the Elevation DVD to heart. (I think U2 fans really are able to hold a visual thought for longer than a heart beat or two.)

The two titles I've already mentioned shined particularly and then there is always ""Beautiful Day"", Bono's done better, but I feel privileged each and every time I hear that song. I was also grabbed by ""Until The End Of The World"", a song whose lyrics I hadn't payed attention to until this evening where Judas converses with Jesus in alternating sarcasm, longing and regret. Missing from the gig was ""Yaweh"", a stunning, soul-moving, acoustic segue to (Psalm) ""40"" performed at the finale of the Chicago 2005 DVD and on ""U2 3-D"".

So my review: two thumbs up, one down. Sonic and visually dazzling! Film editing the equivalent of ten fingernails on a black board.
Now back to waiting patiently. There won't be a film producer editing my eyeballs in Denver 2011.",1276387200,5,2579,4.322314049586777
4114373,1,B003ELOQD4,"After I found out the release date for U2360 and placed my order with Amazon, I watched the mailbox daily in excited anticipation of the arrival of my new Bluray.  I was at the opening night show in Chicago and loved the show but was too far away to enjoy it fully, so this disc was to be the up-close-and personal version for me.

It's not.  I can't evevn sit through a whole song.  The audio is quite excptional, but the video quality is horrible.  The frame rate is so foul that it seems like the hardware is at fault.  Based on other reviews (and swapping back to other movies) it seems the effect in intentional.  While I can appreciate artistic vision, this is not that.  It's just plain impossible to watch.",1276300800,10,714,4.356060606060606
4114374,5,B003ELOQD4,"I have just watched the blu-ray of this concert and have been blown away.  I was a bit nervous after reading some of the negative reviews here, but as an owner of almost every U2 concert available on DVD I must say this one ranks as one of my top 3 (with Slane and Zoo TV - with Red Rocks just a little behind) as an exciting and explosive entertainment experience.

Trust me  - the editing is great - it suits each song (check out Vertigo) - and adds to the excitement (it does not jump around all the time, there are long shots when there need to be).  U2 are in great form as well, sounding much better than on the Vertigo tour DVD.

The stage and lighting are incredible, the setlist is great (nice to see and hear a few songs we haven't seen before - like Ultra Violet and In A Little While).  I like 'Pride' as much as the next fan but have heard quite enough of it for now.  The only minor quibble is I would like the band to play something off Pop again.

The extras are fun, it's nice to have the promo videos from the new album, the Berlin timelapse was interesting - did it really take 2-3 days to set everything up?  Wow.  Nice booklet as well.

The sound and video quality were fantastic on my setup (I watched on a large screen projector with dts sound).  The blu-ray defaults to stereo so I'm wondering if some reviewers here didn't know to switch to the multi-channel sound.

Like they say - you can't please all the people all the time - but I would suggest running to the nearest store (or putting this in your Amazon basket) without delay if you like U2 or have been wondering what all the fuss is about - this is entertainment at its best.",1276300800,12,1659,4.163009404388715
4114375,3,B003ELOQD4,"The problem with this show is that it lacks any kind of intimacy. The sheer magnitude of the production makes it more like a half-time Super Bowl show. Bono says the 360 setup is supposed to bring the fans closer to the band (and vice-versa), but I think it's just the opposite. Never have I seen U2 less connected to their audience as in this DVD/Blu-ray production.

We watched the entire concert, but had to split our viewing over three evenings because the ADD-style editing (2 seconds per shot), jiggly camera work and grainy picture quality is enough to give you a headache. For my money, I recommend the 2001 ""Go Home"" DVD which is far superior in almost every respect.",1276214400,2,676,4.586776859504132

I think the production of this disc is beautiful. It's simply clear and crisp when the producers wanted it to be. Don't let the 1080p every frame must be crystal clear types throw you, the creators of this presentation knew exactly what they were doing. The multiple angles and fly overs is spectacular, add to that the unbelievable lighting at the Rose Bowl and you've got a great 2 1/2 hours of entertainment. Really, it's a work of art. I really enjoyed it thoroughly. The sound is spectacular. Piped into your 5.1 HD Surround Sound and it's as if you are in the Rose Bowl!

the sound mix on this thing is INSANE if you have DTS-HD surround.  i mean... i was there and this makes it feel like you're there.  some have complained about the editing or the video quality... i have to disagree.  Elevation and Vertigo (both directed by Hamish Hamilton) were cut to be all over the place.  this one is different.  each song has its own feel and approach and yet is part of the greater whole.  it looks fantastic.  yeah... it's a little grainy, but i think that's the point.  it should feel like a rock show not some slick, glossy pop show.  it honestly looks like i remember it feeling.  they've captured the feel of this show perfectly.

for my money, i don't know that there's a better concert dvd out there.  if they ever get around to releasing U2 3D to the home market, we'll see!",1276128000,3,838,4.434210526315789
4114380,4,B003ELOQD4,"Jason Schoellen -  nice review and I agree 100% with many of the points you made, although I have to say that I side with the majority of the posters here who say that ""Breathe"" should have started the video.  Why didn't it?  To be a true document of the evening they should have included the ""Kingdom"" intro including Larry Mullen walking solo up to his drum kit to kick off the show - very powerful stuff.  There are a few shots in Breathe that are out of focus and appear to have some lens flare from the lights.  Is that an ""artsy"" inclusion or some beginning of concert technical issues that relegate the cut to the ""Extra's"" bin?  Only the editors can answer that, although with the number of cameras working I would have to think they could have put together a clear edit.

I feel that the video in 1080i is clear enough - those that say is looks like 480P are mistaken.  Regarding the quick edits - yeah, there are a fair amount of those, but they are tastefully done and the cuts are relevant.  Could the shots have been held longer?  Absolutely.  This ""MTV"" quick-edit crap drives me crazy.  But at least they don't cut from an Edge solo to, say, show a fan jumping up and down.  You might see a wider angle of the same cut with Edge on the overhead screen continuing the solo, or a sweet bass line from Adam that's relevant to the song.  All in all it flows very well.

Sound is great.  No complaints at all about that.  And you will truly see the Edge shine here - as Bono once said, he, Larry and Adam would make a great 3 piece band.  So with the minor complaints I give it 4 stars out of 5.  Hey - for $20 you can't lose.  Rock on U2 fans...",1276041600,2,1656,4.147798742138365
4114381,4,B003ELOQD4,"First, let me clear a few things up...

Some have said the Blu-Ray edition includes the show on DVD as well.  That is 100% false.  You just get one Blu-Ray disc.

Others have said this doesn't include ""Breathe"".  That is 100% false as well.  It's not in the main feature, but it's in the bonus content.  It's edited a bit differently and I'm wondering if that's why they opted to keep it seperate...or if they just felt that ""Boots"" had more energy to kick start the show.

Finally, others have said that the YouTube version will suffice in lieu of this.  It's a matter of opinion, but I watched the YouTube show live (and later as a download) and it doesn't hold a candle to this Blu-Ray.

The audio is SPECTACULAR, if nothing else.  I've been to 10 live shows (including a pair in Dublin) over the last three tours and have HUNDREDS of audio bootlegs and every official concert release they've ever made...and this is an audiophiles dream.  I've yet to hear better sound from a live show.  For those complaining, perhaps they don't have the capability to reproduce the HD audio in their receiver or blu-ray player.  I can ... and it's fabulous.

For those who say the video is ""grainy""...it's a dark night...and it's also a ""post-production"" effect for a film look.  That was intended...it wasn't a matter of sub-par equipment.  Personally, I think the video quality is amazing...the lighting and colors are perfect.

Rating the production/editing aspect, as many have mentioned, the editing is questionable at times -- they go through phases of falling in love with superimposed shots that have, on many occasions, no rhyme or reason.  Some are executed well (this coming from somebody who has produced live shows for a living) but most are just in excess.

That being said the quick shots are done more tastefully than recent releases (i.e. Vertigo Chicago, Elevation Boston, etc.).  In order to accurately portray the energy from the band and the audience, fast tempo'ed editing is almost required.  I'm not a fan of the uber-ADD style we see in many things nowadays, but I think the style used was better than other recent U2 releases.

Big props to the variety of camera angles -- for those who complained you don't see the majesty of the set...did you even WATCH the show?  It's what I loved so much about this release -- aerials of the Rose Bowl/stage, jibs swooping across the crowd as if you're floating above them...jibs hovering over the band and stage as if you're a ""heavenly"" guest just taking a peek.  Shots of Larry doing his thing up-close (we rarely, if ever, have seen this in past releases).  Intimate and personal shots of Edge and Bono as if you're right there with them.

Quick notes on the bonus features.  ""Squaring the Circle"" is a great featurette...the rest of them are pretty much worthless.  Very short and no real ""payoff"" in them.

As somebody who has heard and seen a LOT of U2 bootlegs (and live shows in person), I'd HIGHLY recommend adding this to your collection...if for no other reason, it's the only current U2 release in HD (outside of Rattle and Hum, circa 1987).",1276041600,6,3107,4.689463955637708
4114382,3,B003ELOQD4,"I was at that concert, and it was a typical U2 extravaganza. Exceptionally well done, and the energy, look and feel of the Rose Bowl audience and environment and U2's interaction with it was a part of its success.  Afterwards, I really really enjoyed the Youtube broadcast of it that was available online for a couple of weeks before they yanked it.

Regarding the DVD, I am disappointed because I felt the editing didn't do justice to the entire concert environment in a way that was accessible. No shot was on the screen for much longer than 7 seconds, and most between 3 and 5 seconds.  I have amazingly quick vision (I make my living drawing people and things really fast) yet I felt I never had a chance to focus on any one scene before another was quickly flashed, faded into, etc.  There were few views that gave a sense of the hugeness of the concert. It was like blinking my eyes and another view.  I'm pretty good at connecting the dots, and even though I was at that concert, the DVD never gave much of a feeling of the whole.

While the camera work and sound, etc., were very well done, I felt there was too much being thrown at the viewer, too fast.  Frankly, I thought the Youtube live broadcast provided a better feel of the concert and visual experience of it, which was after all, a ""world event"".",1276041600,81,1314,4.404958677685951
4114383,5,B003ELOQD4,"I attended the U2 360 Tour concert at Fed Ex field last September. Trying to describe the experience to someone who wasn't there is almost impossible. The HUGE ""Claw"" stage setup was an amazing sight - like something out of a Godzilla movie! But if you couldn't be there, this DVD is the next best thing. Although the Rose Bowl set list is slightly different than the one I saw, watching this DVD still brought back some great memories. 95 percent of this concert is the same as what I saw in DC. It was like going back to the concert again, but this time from different ever changing seat locations. The sound quality is excellent and the presentation of the concert is top notch!  So for those that missed the 360 tour, heres your chance to finally see it. And for those of you that did go, this is the ultimate 360 concert souvenir. Enjoy!",1275955200,17,842,4.397435897435898
4114384,4,B003ELOQD4,"The U2 extravaganza we know as 360 live at the Rose Bowl documents the bands latest and biggest production yet which will still be trotting around the world this year. I was fortunate to catch this show in LA and and the one 2 nights prior in Las Vegas at the Sam Boyd Stadium. Looking back now the Vegas show was just a dress rehearsal for LA. The setlist was identical which is unfortunate which tells me as the biggest Rock and Roll band in the world they like to ""play it safe"" and create the illusion that that night was special and unique. If you like your Rock shows presented to you with perfection then shows like U2, Rush and Kiss is your cup of tea. If you wanted to see a rock show where the music is center stage go see The White Stripes, Prince or The Black Crowes where setlists if there is one differs night after night. I personally take the big production shows for what they are at face value. U2 at a time did let the music dictate and be the center piece of their shows and if it worked it worked. Take example their live aid performance in 85' They were meant to play 3 songs that day ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" ""Bad"" and ""Pride"" but they only got to do 2 songs Sunday and Bad. They got lost in the music and Pride wasn't performed. They didn't need all the gadgets -they had passion and its hard to get that with a rehearsed show. There are shows like Rush where it works they are probably the only exception in my opinion, with U2 seeing both forms - they do work better when they play off the fly- they are more exciting to watch as performers. Now that being said, at the vegas show I was in the front pit and in LA I was in nosebleed seats. Having experiencing the same show in 2 different outlooks. The show makes more sense in the nosebleed seats as a whole - the lights, the visuals it was more enjoyable, so with that in mind the home dvd will be great viewing. Being in the front didn't matter - the band 80 percent of the time were roaming the ramps playing to the rest of the stadium except Adam and Larry who you couldn't see at all. The front pit was created so it could have a club vibe with the band -standing room only without the pushing shoving and being crushed. personally it didn't work for me for the band was hardly visible and you couldn't see the visuals. The sound was way better in the nosebleed seats. The show was designed more for the people in the nosebleed seats. I give credit to U2 for coming up with ways to make a stadium very intimate. As far as track listing one thing i can say about U2 is that they play almost all their new material. They don't have to depend on their hits to make their shows work. They also throw in other than hits deep cuts from their old albums ""In a little while"" ""Ultraviolet"" ""The Unforgettable Fire"" fans like myself like to hear the new material and songs that aren't as popular. U2 is great in the balancing act of giving hard core fans and just regular radio listeners what they need.",1275955200,8,2973,4.2084063047285465
4114385,3,B003ELOQD4,"Why do concert film makers insist on getting off on ruining simplicity at its finest. The 360 stage was an amazing spectacle which U2 put on some of their best gigs since the Elevation tour yet the creators of this concert dvd didn't feel that was enough. Instead of leaving some stationary cameras and inserting some dramatic angles etc they delude the entire concert with over the top camera cuts, fades and special effects.

The ZooTv concert VHS/DVD was similar in which the film maker added some on screen effects etc but even that was mild compared to the 360 dvd. The YouTube live broadcast was MUCH better than this cluster [...] of a mess. Performance, Stage and setting are fantastic...the dvd production is embarrassing.",1275868800,3,731,4.848
4114386,2,B003ELOQD4,"I'm giving this a bad review based solely on the technical aspects of the disc. The video quality is absolutely terrible. For a Blu-ray I expected so much more. The video is grainy, overexposed and all-in-all very sub-par. At first I thought maybe the look was an intentional effect that would pass. I even checked my Blu-ray player settings just to make sure it wasn't my machine. Having seen the other comments on here about the video I have to sadly accept that's the way it is. It's too bad. Having seen the 360 tour and the spectacular stage show it's a real shame this is how they chose to capture it. My standard definition DVD of the 2005 Vertigo tour looks much better than this disc. Someone else said the streaming YouTube video looks better and they're right. It does.

Some have commented about the editing looking more like a music video than a live concert, and I agree it does. It doesn't bother me too much, although I would have preferred just a straight-forward approach as opposed to all the overlays, dissolves, composite images, etc.

The concert itself is good. Bono and the boys sound good (although Bono's voice isn't what it used to be) and the set list is varied, although why they chose to leave the opening song ""Breathe"" out of the main concert and make it a ""bonus feature"" is puzzling.

I wish Bono a successful and speedy recovery from his recent injury and I hope to see U2 back out on the 360 tour soon. It would be nice to see them live again since the Blu-ray does a real injustice to the experience I remember.",1275782400,65,1548,4.4822695035460995
4114387,5,B003ELOQD4,"I was at this show and I am so glad it was put to film. I was shocked to see all the negative reviews of the Blu-Ray editon. I am a little disapointed they didn't start the film from the Bowie song Ground Control to Majior Tom from David Bowie when U2 entered the staadium into Breathe. Other then that I truely enjoyed watching the show again and again. Anybody that enjoys live music, especially from the best live band in the world will love this film. The stage is unbelievable and it's cool to see it from all angels in and outside the Rose Bowl. Buy this vid and you will be truely happy....no doubt in my mind",1275782400,2,616,4.184873949579832
4114388,2,B003ELOQD4,"The editing is such that you will get a headache if you watch it too long. No shot is stationary everything is panning around the entire time and when it isn't it is a montage of multiple angles. Then no shot lasts for longer than one or two seconds. It is best to just listen to it and not watch. I had watched it on youtube the night when it was live and I can't remember it jumping around so much.
I did manage to catch the tour when it was near me. I had expensive seats that where behind the stage. I left feeling very disappointed that I pretty much only got to see the backs of their heads for the entire show. I had gone in thinking I had great seats since they where so close, how wrong I was. Sooo if you are planning to get to one of the future shows, don't bother buying seats in the back because the only thing 360 about the show is the video board.
Long time fan here.
I was at the Joshua Tree show at RFK in DC. Been to many other shows even multiple times on the same U2 tour. I am pretty sure the 360 will be my last.",1275782400,3,1034,3.8820754716981134

Was particularly moved and impressed with the U23D I saw at imax. This U2360 Blu-ray is very hard to watch. Put simply. How does the biggest band in the world. With the biggest stage and production in one of the biggest venues in the US not consider the home viewer of this DVD? One needs to capture the concert experience. The majesty of the set. The narrative of the songs and flow of the show. They have done this before in their other video releases. Other artists like Peter Gabriel and countless others get this concept. Apparently the director and editor of this production did not. Jump cuts and shaky footage can be useful for effect and to make visual points and are great when they are used sparingly. But when not a single shot lasts more than 3 seconds and there are jarring zooms and pans in them...You get a mess. We have split screens. Super imposed shots. Quick shot of Bono's shoes to a quick shot of the back of Larry's head. Those things work in a 4-5 minute song video..But a live concert has to take you there. I think of New Years day at Red Rocks. I think of Exit in Rattle and Hum. I think of Origin of Species in U23D as amazing moments of u2 on video. This concert film does not have those moments and it is not because of the performance, the sound, or their material which is great...It is because the editor and director approached this like a communication student that just got final cut pro. I will watch it again because I own it. Maybe dig around on the disc menu for alternate shots. Or just treat it like a really expensive live CD.",1275782400,206,1684,4.332278481012659

Really like the live versions of the new songs especially I'll Go Crazy IF I Don't Go Crazy Tonight and the highlight for me was The Unforgettable Fire which is the best version of that song I've ever heard. The editing of the show especially on Get On Your Boots was very frantic and hard to watch on a small TV but most of the rest of the show flowed more smoothly.

I was at this show, and this actually makes the concert seem better than it was.

Bono's voice has been ""touched up"" quite a bit here, he's definitely on the downside of his career.

Same quibbles about the the picture that others have stated. Definitely NOT of the caliber of other Blu-Ray Music videos, particulary Rush Snakes and Arrows live is

Better extras than last few releases.

Better direction than last 3, Hamish Hamilton butchered those.

Not on a par with Pop, Red rocks or ZooTV.

It just looks like the put some digital garbage on it to make it look like a standard def DVD...and sometimes WORSE than standard DVD.

Now, I need to pay to return it, and re-order the two disc version, which has that song on the second disc.  I love U2, but they should have included all songs from the concert on the 1-disc version.

4114395,1,B003ELOQD4,"U2 must of had in their contract with Live Nation that they could release this on DVD because it feels rushed.  As others have commented, the show does not look like it's in high-def, the rapid camera changes are very annoying, and the whole spaceship thing is just plain silly.

The other gripe I have is with U2.  First,  I absolutely love U2 and have seen them at least 10 times on various tours.  What was so great about U2 for many of was the spontaneity of the group.  You never knew what Bono was going to do and it was not uncommon for a five minute song to turn into a fifteen minute jam with Bono singing from the heart.

I'm afraid that my favorite group is becoming more predictable.  What I mean is that every show on this tour was pretty much the same.  Hopefully U2 will return to that dangerous edge where you never knew if you were about to experience something truly special.

And hopefully they will never let this editor touch one of their DVD's again.",1275609600,9,972,4.320441988950276
4114396,1,B003ELOQD4,"Man, I couldn't have been more disappointed with this bluray.  Ok, I was at this concert
about 15 feet from the outer runway and no I couldn't find myself but that isn't why I am disappointed.  First off the quality is like a regular DVD this is not high definition by any means. Second, ENOUGH of the 3 second fast cuts in the filming!  When are these directors going to stop editing these concerts like an MTV video?  On a 60 inch TV it becomes nauseating and down
right annoying.  Hold the stinking camera in one place otherwise I would banish you to pergatory where you will be forced to watch ""Speed Racer"" for 12 hours a day!  The last was the weird way this thing was put togther with this Space ship at the begining.  It was SUCH and amazing show
and ruined by taking out the actual opening and some adding dated looking CGI space ship.
To me the whole DVD ( I can't call it a bluray) is a disaster.",1275609600,28,907,4.208092485549133
4114397,4,B003ELOQD4,"I was at this show live back in October of 2009, and once I heard it was coming to DVD, I was excited. Even moreso once I heard it was going to be offered on Blu Ray. People are complaining about the picture, I am not sure what that is all about. The visuals are so stunning in blu it's very hard to describe. The audio is so pitch perfect that even with my outdated surround system, it felt like Bono and Co were in my living room.

The dvd gives you the complete U2 experience and leaves nothing to chance. Stunning visual array, a video screen that has to be seen to be believed and a massive crowd of over 97,000 all singing ""I Still Haven't Found (What I'm Looking For) is amazing.

The extras are pretty cool, the time lapse of the stage being assembled, and a documentary on the creation of the stage and show was excellent. Like many others my only complaint is why ""Breathe"" was put as an ""extra"". Why could the creators just not present the set-list as it happened. That is very confusing to me. I would love to hear why that is the case.

Great DVD, great Blu-Ray not just for U2 fans, but for people that like to watch concerts from the comfort of their own home. This one had tremendous re-watch value.

LOVED IT!

4114398,2,B003ELOQD4,"I give this a 5 for the marvelous DTS soundtrack and a minus 1 for the horrendous video. For a group that is supposedly on the cutting edge of multimedia, the video on this blu-ray looks like one of my old VHS tapes from the early 90's. Dark, grainy, and off-color. I should know because I attended this concert. Having seen clips of the upcoming Springsteen dvd which is in true HD, I plan on returning this in exchange for that as soon as possible. What a shame. Wait for 2 months when this appears in the bargain bin at Walgreens.",1275523200,3,533,4.287128712871287

Highlights include ""Until the End of the World"", ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" (featuring a Green Iranian Revolution theme), ""One"", ""Ultra Violet"", and ""Moment of Surrender.""

I own about 500 or so dvd and blu-ray concerts and the dramatic effect of dark atmospheric lighting makes for a great concert experience,but doesn't necessarily translate that well for picture quality. That being said ,the picture quality is still very good. More importantly to me are performance and sound,which are exceptional here. Everyone has there favourites but the setlist for me leans way to heavily on 2000 onward and little from their best albums of the 80's and early nineties,but a great disc nonetheless.",1275523200,,614,5.029411764705882

There's nothing wrong with the concert, production values, performance, etc. but the video quality was atrocious. It was not at all what I thought I'd get. I guess I was spoiled I just got through watching Foo Fighters live at Wembley (a reference Blu-Ray DVD)and that Blu-Ray was spectacular for clarity and detail. That's what I thought I'd get with U2, but no, it looks like a regular ole DVD. Too bad, a great opportunity missed.",1275523200,4,531,4.720430107526882

4114405,5,B003ELOQD4,"This is simply U2, performing, one of the greatest, Stadium Rock Shows ever. The Big Screen Above the stage, resembles an Alien Space Craft, that has landed on the Rose Bowl Stadium. The stage itself is in the center on the stadium, plus there are walkways, coming off the stage, that protrude into the audience. The Atmosphere is ""Awesome"". U2 performs at their best. The concert features songs from their ""No Line on the Horizon"" album, plus, their classics. Plus, you get some great, legetimate, human rights issues thrown in. The stadium is packed to capacity. Who could ask for more in a Rock Show? You will not be disappointed in this one, for sure. Disc 1 contains the concert, disc 2 contains the bonus material. All together you get about 4 hours & 11 minutes of footage. Thanks and Enjoy!!!",1275523200,,800,4.680851063829787

The concert is beautifully captured, edited and presented on the BluRay edition.  The special features are also very well done.  The only complaint I have is the decision to relegate the opening song (Breathe) as a ""bonus track"", which sort of breaks the continuity of the overall stage production.  The audio is fantastic.",1275523200,9,455,4.947368421052632

4114408,3,B003ELOQD4,"I was fortunate enough to pick this up early, but as luck would have it, that was not the case. The video quality is pretty bad; certainly not what I am accustomed to with Blu-Ray. Luckily, it is the same price as the ""standard"" DVD version, because they must look about the same. Overall, I am quite disappointed with U2's first live Blu-Ray offering.",1275436800,10,352,4.515625
4114409,5,B003ELOQD4,"According to ""Rolling Stone"": ""This is a stunning concert film shot by 27 high definition cameras documenting the epic scale of the band's montrous, clawlike stage...."".""The sound is crisp and detailed ; new songs such as the closing ""Moment of Surrender"" feel like they've been reinvented in this setting.""

I have seen all of U2's prior concert DVDs, and all have their good points and bad points. I've reveiwed hundreds of concert dvds, I have a vast collection. In my opinion, this is the best U2 concert DVD. If want a professional opinion, read the ""Rolling Stone"" review.

This is a review of the 1 DVD Disc Set. There is also a 2 DVD Disc Set available. This concert was filmed on the 25th of October, 2009, at the Rose Bowl, in Pasadena, California. The stadium is packed to capacity. This was a show from their ""2009 U.S.A., U2, 360 Degrees Tour"". This is one of the biggest Rock & Roll Shows ever, it's huge. The stage is in the center of the Rose Bowl,(which is reminiscent of Def Leppard's ""In the Round, In Your Face"" DVD, from their ""Hyteria"" Tour back in the 80's, but U2's is a much larger scale). There are revolving walk-ways (kind of like the bridge on the Rolling Stones ""Bridges to Babylon Tour"" concert DVD). Plus, there is a big circular walk-way that circles the stage.

Also, U2 has this huge, round, big screen mounted on the top of the stage, that shows close-up's & light shows to go along with the music, sometimes it forms the shape of a ""cone"" and does other things. It's totally ""Awesome"". It has 4 arches, that look like ""legs"", holding it up. It looks like a ""space alien/space ship"" I didn't get to see U2 on this tour, but I had a friend who did, and he told me that it was the biggest Rock Show, he'd ever seen. After watching this dvd, I totally agree.

This concert DVD features some songs from their recent album, ""No Line on the Horizon"", along with their classics.

Disc 1 (The Concert): The song set with some comments & personal observations:
1. Get On Your Boots
2. Magnificent
3. Mysterious Ways
4. Beutiful Day
5. I Still Havn't Found What I'm Looking For - On this one, Bono includes a part of the Ben E.King song ""Stand By Me"".
6. Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of
7. No Line on the Horizon (Bono plays his electric guitar, along with The Edge on this one.)
8. Elevation
9. In a Little While - Includes the commander of the International Space Station, on the screen, and he makes some comments.
10. Unknown Caller
11. Until the End of the World
12. The Unforgettable Fire (On this one, The Edge plays keyboards.)
13. City of Blinding Lights (Includs great light show.)

14. Vertigo - Simply outstanding, and it includes a little bit of the Rolling Stones song ""It's only Rock & Roll, But I Like It.""

15. I'll Go Crazy if I Don't Go Crazy Tonight (Includes an ""Over the Top"" light show on the big screen. At the end, Bono has a message for Iran & freedom. He states Iran, this is the U.S.A. calling Iran. The big screen shows an Iran woman, with her head covered, and Bono calls for freedom for Iranian women and Iranian people in general.) Bono, even states this message is even for people who don't like freedom. This quickly leads into ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"".

16. Sunday Bloody Sunday (Among other things, this shows a bus that was blown up by terrorists on the big screen.)

17. MLK (Bono talks about a woman for freedom who is being held in prison in Burma, she's been in prison for about 20 years, because of her stand for freedom. Bono mentions her name. Her name is Aung San Suu Kyi. Bono basically dedicates this song to her. Her picture and name is shown on the big screen, during the song. Bono mentions Martin Luther King, Jr, and Nelson Mendela, and how they were for non-violence, freedom, & for peace. This quickly goes into the performance of ""Walk On"".

18. Walk On - An Outstanding song & performance by U2. Again, this song is dedicated to Aung San Suu Kyi. During the song, many members of the audience are wearing her face mask, and her picture is shown on the big screen. During the song, ""Walk On"", there are volunteers from Amnesty International, walking on the circular walk-way that surrounds the stage. It fits perfectly with the song. Then the Bishop Desmond Toto introduces the song ""One"".

19. One - Bishop Desmond Toto introduces this song. He is shown on the big screen, and he talks about people who have faught for peace, non-violence, freedom, equity, & justice, in the old ""Aparhied"", South Africa, in the Civil Rights movement in the U.S.A., and in Northern Ireland. (On this one, Bono plays his electric guitar again). Bono ends the song ""One"", by singing ""Amazing Grace"", it gave me ""chill bumps"", and this quickly leads into the next song.

20. Where the Streets Have No Names - (This is a phenomenal perfomance, the crowd is really, really into this one.) Then you get a light show with a space alien & a lighted ""Flying Saucer"" that is shown on the big screen. The alien talks in ""space alien language"".

21. Ultra Violet/Light My Way - (On this one, Bono has a round ""ultra violet"" red light that circles his microphone.)

22. With or Without You (On this one Bono starts giving credits & thanks.)

23. Moment of Surrender (This is the last song, on this one they turn the Rose Bowl into the ""Milky Way Galaxy"". Bono has the audience members to turn on lights, from cell phones and etc., plus there are special lighting effects. They do an awesome performace of this song, then leave the stage, leaving the audience ""spellbound"", and me too. Then, that's it!!! You start getting song credits and all that kind of stuff on your TV screen, and it's over.

In Conclusion, this is One of the ""Greatest Rock Concerts Ever"", and certainly the best U2 concert dvd. Thanks!!!!!",1275436800,3,5769,4.500956022944551

4114413,5,B003ELOQD4,"There seems to be some frustration in previous reviews about this set not being a Blu-ray release.  Apparently, it actually includes BOTH the 2 disc DVD and the Blu-ray.  For anyone who is still concerned about what this ""Super Deluxe Edition"" contains, here is the description from the U2 website:

""The Set will include: a 32 page hardback book; limited edition 2-disc DVD of U2360 At The Rose Bowl plus 2 hours of bonus material; 1 blue-ray of U2360 At The Rose Bowl plus 2 hours of bonus material; 1 vinyl 7inch; 3 U2360 guitar picks; the Tour Programme; a limited edition numbered drawing of final stage design; and 5 art prints in an embossed wallet.""

I was at the Vancouver, BC show that closed the 2009 tour and it was a FANTASTIC show.  One of the most memorable concerts I have been to.  The only thing that I lamented was the fact that BC Place was a bit of an echo chamber because it is comletely enclosed.  That much sound in a confined space just had no where to go.  The sound must have been phenomenally clean at the Rose Bowl, with it being so open.  I am looking forward to this release being the perfect keepsake for an amazing tour.",1273708800,21,1153,4.400943396226415
4114414,5,B003ELOQD4,I watched this show when it was broadcast live on utube and it was absolutely hands down great. I actually liked some of the songs more so live then the actual recording. The recording quality as it was broadcast was exceptional and I think it is probably becuase of the technology behind the scenes used during the concert. U2 utilizes 2 mixing boards one for edge and bono and one for larry and adam. I was amazed the clarity and sound for a live broadcast show. This show is truly amazing to see and is worth the cost. If you are a fan of U2 music you will enjoy this show. Do not bother with the live from slane castle or mexico concerts. vertigo show and Live from boston are very good also but this one is top of the pops baby!,1273449600,3,733,4.169014084507042

I know that concerts tend to be edited but eliminate the opening song? Was it just to tell the fans that don't like Get on Your Boots, you don't like it? It's the opening of the official DVD/Blu ray concert.",1270512000,7,569,4.220183486238532
