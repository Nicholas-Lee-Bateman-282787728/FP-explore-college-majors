2562143,5,B000FEBWUS,I purchased this DVD and 2 others at the same time. My purchase was for my 3 year old nephew. And he is definitely wearing them out. The Teletubies and what they teach are very enlightenig. He wants them all. Children love to watch there tummies come alive with something new in every episode. These are great DVD's for little ones wanting to learn and have fun.,1208217600,,362,4.417910447761194
2562144,5,B000FEBWUS,"When I first saw the show, I was simultaneously fascinated and horrified by these creatures.  Who are they?  Where do they come from?  Where exactly does their world exist?  How come there are no other sentient beings around, and where do they get their manufactured goods from?  Obviously they have no means of production.  And who mows the grass and tends the flowers???

Then it hit me.  What I'm about to explain to you is one of the best kept secrets in children's television.......

The teletubbies and their world are actually a virtual reality environment.  In the far future, some segments of society, for a variety of reasons, will choose to upload their consciousness into a variety of VR environments, all housed in a massively powerful supercomputer.  What we are viewing in the teletubbies is just one of those environments being broadcast backwards in time from the far future.  Think about it, it explains EVERYTHING and makes perfect sense.  Another good example of this is ""Jay Jay the Jet Plane"".",1201824000,5,1015,4.9
2562145,5,B000FEBWUS,"My son who is 2 years old, loves Teletubbies and I do too, but not because I watch them, but because I can have an hour for my self a day to do whatever I need to, because the minute I put this DVD on for him, he is glued to the TV and fascinated by them! He like to repeat words and things Teletubbies do on DVD so it's not just entertaining for him but a very educational DVD as well! Thumbs up!",1201046400,,397,3.738095238095238
2562146,2,B000FEBWUS,"I myself really hate the dvd but I did not purchase it for me, but my 13 month old son won't watch it either.  Maybe he is too young.",1200700800,,133,3.586206896551724
2562147,5,B000FEBWUS,"I am not a big fan of this kind of ""babysitting"" but as long as it is in moderation, I can handle it and Teletubbies are just the thing I needed to be able to get a little stuff done around the house. My daughter loves them and they are simple enough for her little mind (she is 1) to follow along to and enjoy. She gets entertainment, I get a clean kitchen.",1169510400,14,358,3.9178082191780823

8121448,2,B000FEBWUS,"Not my favorite either. The best one of all that I ordered was ""Go,Exercise with the Teletubbies"". My 14 mo. old daughter imitates the exercise movements. Even my husband loves it.
If you only buy one, get the ""Exercise"" DVD.",1214092800,,225,4.65
