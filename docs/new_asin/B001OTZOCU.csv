8331556,4,B001OTZOCU,"This movie follows the life and death of a man through a span of ten years.  He is an 'average Joe' married publishing editor who has an affair with a would-be author presently involved with an addict playwright. Confused yet?  Wait. The story is told from two points of view:  The events in the lives of four people. And the events remembered by the first three main characters who meet up after death.  Be prepared to watch this twice to be sure you've gotten the point! It's a very interesting script obviously well thought out and the characters are all very strong, so you get really caught up in it all.  But what is the real ending?  This is a good film to debate with friends because of the questions left unanswered. Nyqvist knocks another one out of the park with his portrayal of the editor. The man just cannot give a bad performance.  Have fun with this one.",1302048000,4,871,4.440251572327044
8331557,4,B001OTZOCU,"Details (Detaljer) is a mature Swedish drama which plays as two realities at one time. The film covers 10 years in the lives of 4 people.

This film is crafted in a clean, simple, intelligent manor. It stars the great Swedish actor Michael Nykvist (The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo aka Man Som Hater Kvinnor), Pernilla August (Miss Kicki), Jonas Karlsson (Storm) and Rebecca Hemse (Just Another Love Story).

On one hand, this film is a straight forward drama. Each character has their own subtle and not so subtle  idiosyncrasy's.

Details is a well written drama.

The four leads blend together nicely, the casting was wonderful. I really enjoy this kind of straight forwardness in film making.

People love and people lie. They lie straight in each others faces. They find something else that helps them wake up in the morning supposedly happy. Their selfishness or lack of consideration for someone else allows them to go forward with their lives with a clear conscience.

Some people are not sexually motivated, some people cannot share their true feelings. Maybe, some people cannot control their hidden feelings. If we really look at this from a psychoanalytic view, I can write all day about these normal, sane, law abiding, hard working regular people and decide that they are all fully crazy.

Underlying feelings are still there.

The relationships mix and bonds form with people who are very different from one another.

I don't want to spoil this... I will say that one person has extreme habits and has a relationship with someone who is a polar opposite. Yet these very unalike people found a warm and safe place at home to share their lives.

The second (change) relationship is hard to explain without giving the ""real"" story away.

****

The other reality is the after-world and that connection directly to life and how we find our soul mates and our existence in that mysterious place we go.  Do we find each other later? Where do we go. Are we there when we are here?

The dialogue is top of the line. This film is paced very realistically, therefore it is at a slower pace. When you think you are in tune with the film, someone does something unthinkable.

This is a film that full grown, mature people will enjoy. There are no car chases, explosions, false gestures, over the top acting. Just clean professional work.

The writer Jonas Frykberg wrote the Girl Who Played with Fire (Flickan som lekte med elden aka Millenium 2 which  was a choppy disappointment). I hope that he writes more adult drama's like this and less action. This is a great work for him as a writer.

The director, Kristian Petri has a talent for this sort of adult / real or seemingly real drama.

Ultimately, casting makes this slow drama tick. The actors drive this film.

Michael Nykvist is now a world famous celebrity. He is an actor first. He really digs into his roles and I am personally finding myself looking for all of his wonderful work. He is now being cast in more and more commercial/mainstream Hollywood roles in English. He is very strong in this film.

Pernilla August is a master actor. Sadly, I have several films where she is being cheated on. She brings a lot to the table in every role. In Details she carries this film in many ways.

Jonas Karlsson really got down in this one. The party scene which changes his life really showcases his brilliance. He is definitely perfectly cast in this extreme role.

Rebecca Hemse was a big teen star in Sweden. She truly is growing into a real adult actor. Her career is very bright. She is a breath of fresh air in this film, yet she is very dark at the same time.",1300924800,5,3622,4.641065830721003
