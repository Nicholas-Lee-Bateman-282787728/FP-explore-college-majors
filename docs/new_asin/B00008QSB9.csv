*Spoliers*

The film starts with a team of government agents cleaning up a sewer of strange alien eggs. One survives. A snake emerges and transforms into a woman. She walks naked through the rainy city and is taken in by a kind man.

She needs to mate, but she doesn't mate then kill him, but a friend. For some reason a woman suspects she's not human.

The film goes weirder from there.

I gave it three stars because the leading lady is sexy.",1152921600,6,535,4.155339805825243
