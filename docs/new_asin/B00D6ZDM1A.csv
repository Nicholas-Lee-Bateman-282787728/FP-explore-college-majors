5775864,4,B00D6ZDM1A,"Im quite a fan of both genres but rarely see them come hand in hand. It was quite a surprise to find a bunch funny moments in the film intertwined with intense parts, which form quite a roller coaster of suspense, relief in laughter and unexpected twists. I love the cinematography of the movie, almost surprisingly great for an indie film.
Len and Gigi were definitely the attention grabbers, very racy characters and actors as well. However Len's appearance automatically boosted the expectations for his acting which he didn't quite live up to, i felt like i needed more intensity. Though his humor gave movie some originality.
I looved Gigi, she was so beautiful and perfectly psycho for her part, the actress did a good job! But i really kept hoping for some crazy giving birth in the woods scene!)))
The other couple exhibited decent, however not spectacular acting.
There was a couple of minor flaws in timing and sequence of scenes but overall the movie is well put together and i can see a lot of hard work went into it. Would certainly recommend it to my friednds.",1376006400,,1074,4.6878306878306875
5775865,5,B00D6ZDM1A,"This film was a hoot and a holler!  So many genre films attempt humor and fail - not so here.  I laughed out loud!  Smart, scary AND funny.  Everybody wins!",1375660800,,156,4.1
5775866,5,B00D6ZDM1A,"I love finding things. Original things. This movie is one of a kind, that's for sure. The main character takes her boyfriend on a weekend at a cabin, but when they get there a creepy enormous guy and his pregnant girlfriend are there. I'm not going to give the rest away, but there would be plenty to say if I did. This movie actually has a PLOT. The actors (I never heard of any of them) do a fantastic job on the whole and I got totally sucked into the world of the cabin and what was going on with the story. The relationships between the characters gets tense, and some of the conversations were like my real life, but this movie manages to be hyper real stylish (I want those PJ's Susan wears, she looks like Spiderman) and fun and edge of your seat, too. It's great to find female characters to both root for and against in the same movie (and even switch allegiances from time to time). When it ended, I wanted more (maybe a prequel? sequel?) This movie is brave and kicks ass, and looks good doing it.",1375142400,9,1009,4.260416666666667

5775869,5,B00D6ZDM1A,A femme noir full of twists and slights and reversals.  Psycho meets The Shining - this skillfully made thriller has elements of both.  When you're not cuddling back with the popcorn the film's suspenseful pace will have you on the edge of your seat.  The ending is a killer - and it makes you laugh out loud.,1381536000,,309,4.385964912280702

5775871,5,B00D6ZDM1A,A taut thriller that keeps you guessing and is very well paced.  Great acting pulls it all together. I am definitely recommending this film to all of my friends.,1377648000,,161,4.551724137931035
5775872,5,B00D6ZDM1A,"I love suspense/horror movies, but I often ""know"" the ending before the movie ends--disappointing. Not so with Nobody Can Cool, the twists and turns kept coming until the very last scene. Other movies, both lower budget ones and fully funded studio flicks, come to rely on the shock and gore factor with needless or excessive violence and blood and guts. Again, Nobody Can Cool was able to keep the plot moving with minimal violence. An intelligent suspense movie. I highly recommend.",1376352000,,484,4.987654320987654
5775873,4,B00D6ZDM1A,"I wasn't sure what to expect before watching this, but it was definitely time well spent!  The story twists and turns with the funky camera work, making it engaging and visually exciting.  The three main characters (Annette, Principe, and Atlas) gave real and sometimes chilling performances, making up for any blips you usually find in these low budget thrillers (I really thought the pregnant chick was a dude at first... that threw me).  All in all, there was something definitely different and risky here... and worth checking out.",1376179200,,535,5.056818181818182

8590165,1,B00D6ZDM1A,"This is without doubt one of the top ten worst movies I have ever seen.  The high rating on IMBD may be attributed to the fact that (I have no proof of this -- it's just an opinion) the entire production crew voted before audiences had a chance to view it.  The criminals are the most incompetent, ridiculous and annoying I have ever seen outside of a comedy (which I don't think this is supposed to be), and the protagonists are just as bumbling.  One of the criminals actually wants to take his dead brother in their car across the Mexican border, which I'm pretty sure border patrol agents notice from the smell.  Add to that some of the worst dialogue I have ever heard and film-making skills that could easily be surpassed by a bunch of teenagers playing around with their cell phones and you have Nobody Can Cool, a film that makes about as much sense as its title.  You have been warned!",1410134400,2,894,4.393939393939394

8590169,1,B00D6ZDM1A,High school drama club acting. They must have found the script in the garbage can. Maybe the people who gave this five stars were the ones who made it. I have seen a lot of clunkers in my life but this one comes close to the worst.,1407542400,5,231,3.9361702127659575
