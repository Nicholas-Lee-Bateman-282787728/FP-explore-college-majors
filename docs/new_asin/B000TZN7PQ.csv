8211611,2,B000TZN7PQ,"DEMON LOVER (aka: THE DEVIL MASTER) is an ultra-low-budget horror film from 1977. In it, a long-haired sorcerer named Laval Blessing -who bears a striking resemblance to the cowardly lion from Oz- seeks ultimate power through occult means. Sadly for him, his ""occult study group"" (!!) walks out on him. So, Laval performs a secret mumbo jumbo ritual w/ a hot, naked babe in his basement. Suddenly, a demon appears! Soon, the rebellious followers of Laval start dying in grisly ways. The mega-cheeeze piles up fast, accompanied by a recorded-in-a-public-restroom soundtrack, and animatronic mannequins as the supporting cast. Thankfully, it takes itself so seriously that one can only howl in approval! This is funny stuff! My favorite scene involves a girl in a car having the world's most hilarious seizure! Also contains the apocalyptic-shaving-cream-battle sequence, complete w/ demonoid slaughter! The demon him / itself is just plain awesomeness incarnate! Be sure to stick around for the bloody, mega-death finale! Pure Platinum! Gunnar Hansen (TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) fans had better look quick, as he ""stars"" as Professor Peckinpah for about 30 seconds. Mercifully, this movie is very short...",1404345600,,1202,5.433155080213904

Absolutely ""no"" redeeming value. Spare yourself and do not buy, rent or otherwise see this movie.",1329609600,2,268,4.604166666666667
8211613,5,B000TZN7PQ,"I was one of the stars in this movie and it was a blast. I was the nerdy whiny one as referred to in another review. It was really fun making this film, although I never received any royalties from it, and have had many laughs with friends while watching it again. You really need to buy a copy and watch it.

8211614,1,B000TZN7PQ,"I could not watch this past the five minute mark. It is obvious that the studio simply transferred a VHS to DVD. When will be people stop doing this? How hard could it be to track down the film master and do a proper release? I had seen the ""Demon Lover Diary"" which is a great documentary on this film and couldn't wait to buy this. Well I'm going to wait til a proper release is done because the quality on this is REALLY REALLY WRETCHED. I would say worse than VHS because it rolls and flutters and looks like crap. AVOID. It is possible to find both this film and the documentary combined but amazon would probably not allow such sources to be revealed. Do a search.",1284940800,3,670,4.2421875
8211615,4,B000TZN7PQ,"Wow!  Where to start?  Also known as ""The Devil Master"", this old 70's movie has it all if you are looking for a really chintzy mind boggling evening of yucks.

Here's the plotline...A group of teenagers get involved with a satanic priest who calls up a demon from hell.

  This flick is ripe with unintentional hilarity.  Probably shot on a $300 budget, it definitely delivers the goods as far as head scratching ""what were they thinking?"", gut busting, ""so bad it's good"" fun.

  The only real name in the cast is Gunnar Hansen (The original ""Leatherface"" from ""Texas Chainsaw"").  He must have needed a couple bucks for the weekend & shot his 2 minute cameo as a professor with a specialty in Demonology.  The rest of the cast adds to the hilarity.  Most notable is Christmas Robbins as ""Laval Blessing"" who is awesome in his role of the evil Devil Master.  Where did they find this guy & why hasn't he been in anything else?  In addition to his demonic scenes summoning up a really bad looking demon (with horns & some kind of shaggy pelt suit), he has numerous karate scenes where he truly kicks butt (well in a funny sort of way).  In a few scenes the punches & kicks barely land (if at all!) & his victims go down hard none the less.  You have to see it to believe it.  You'll go down hard too while laughing.  Good stuff.  Then there's the cop with the crazy 70's style pants & tough talk.  His entrance near the end of the film where he bounds into the evil castle ""Starsky & Hutch"" style is a winner too.  The crazy 70's ""rock"" songs are truly bad.  There's a whole party scene that you'll love as well.  Bad music, bad clothing, bad fake partying.  Another hilarious character is the nerd of the group.  He has some great scenes where he does some pitch perfect whining.  ""Come on guys!  I have to be home by 10:00!"".  The guy looks a bit long in the tooth to have a curfew.  Must be about 30 years old for cripes sake!  There's some pretty good death scenes during the climax.  Nothing very gory mind you if that's your bag but pretty funny none the less.  The music score is actually pretty effective I must say.  Creepy & strange.  I dug it (as opposed to the previously mentioned ""rock"" tunes mixed in there).  Of course as much as I am busting the film, it's really quite interesting & fun.  I think the grainy look, eerie score, strangely poor acting & locations really give it a kind of nauseating feel which really works in the film's favor.  There is some creepiness mixed in between laughs.  Very, very unique...hard to describe, hard to forget.  I'd imagine those involved must have had a blast making this oddity.  I applaud the film makers in finding the resources to get this thing made.  It must have been cool back in the day to get your friends together & make a low budget flick such as this.  Directed by the late Donald G. Jackson (check out his resume on imdb.com) & Jerry Younkins, this is an experience to not be missed!  If you are a fan of crazy 70's cinema, rent or pick up a copy of this one.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

Hard to find a crisp version of this film & this version doesn't deliver either.  I think my old VHS version is probably cleaner believe it or not.  But beggars can't be choosers with a chestnut like this.  Yep it's muddy, grainy, soft focus, glitches...the evening shots are very dark.  Maybe one day someone will pair it with it's documentary ""Demon Lover Diary"" about the filming of this classic which I have yet to see but have heard it's a fascinating look into this cheesefest.  I can't wait to see the documentary.  I've been told it is even crazier than the film itself.  Perhaps we'll get a cleaned up version down the road.  Of course the muck & mire of a print they ""mastered"" this with adds to the atmosphere.  And as the tag line for this film goes...At Last! The Truth About Demons!  So if you truly want to see the best of the worst, ""Demon Lover"" is the true champ!",1199923200,9,3949,4.363636363636363
