Since I gave it one star you must be wondering why. This movie is unfinished. It needs at least another 10 minutes maybe more. Just as this movie was reaching a suspenseful peak, it ended. No resolultion, no nothing. I have enjoyed movies that made you think, that didn't spoonfeed the audience an ending and explanation. This is NOT what happens here. Even for a mystery ending, they have to have a mystery ending. Watching this movie is like watching the first movie in the Alien series and having it end abruptly just as they are about to interrogate what is left of the robot Ash. Great up to that point, but incomplete.

The way this movie ends makes it a complete waste of time. Save yourself the aggravation and STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!!",1295654400,,875,4.537974683544304
