3128589,5,B0014BRCXC,We loved this!  It went back to the first Macy's parade and why they began them and brought it up to todays parade!,1291248000,,115,4.0
3128590,5,B0014BRCXC,"I showed this to my second/third grade class and they were enthalled! They got excited when they began seeing balloon characters they recognized. Then I watched it with extended family over the Thanksgiving holiday and everyone from the 1 and 1/2 year old to the 70+ year-old enjoyed it. There is amazing footage of early parades as well as behind the scenes shots of modern parades. The pace and the voice over are lively, which helps hold your interest. Well worth the price.",1291161600,4,477,4.759036144578313
3128591,5,B0014BRCXC,"As a child I watched my first Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on NBC, at age three (1963). Watching the sights and hearing the sounds- I was taken with the visual treat of gigantic cartoon characters floating between the skyscrapers of Broadway. The balloons and the melodic sounds of the music of Milton DeLugg, enjoying his first year as the parade's musical director had me hooked. I knew that one day- I wanted to become a designer of giant helium filled balloons and one day- march in that great parade! Well, Macy's designs and creates their own balloons....but the dream of being a part of the Macy parade came true when I was invited to help lead the huge Charlie Brown balloon down Broadway- 2002. I have shared massive amounts of archival material with Macys and have had the honor of being a part of their parade every year since! As for the balloon designer dream- 2010 marks my 23rd year as a designer-creator of giant helium parade balloons for parades and events all over the country and abroad! So, when my friends at Macys suggested to Al Roker Entertainment to consider me as a part of the documentary ""Inside Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade"", I was thrilled and delighted to say the very least. In addition to great interviews, I supplied photographs and home movie footage from my own archives and led the producers to a trail of vintage- never before seen historic footage- which I am proud to say made the final cut of the special. As a participant in this amazing special- I would highly suggest this DVD to anyone who has ever seen the parade, marched in the parade or just loves a parade. You are in for a real treat. It's a real keepsake and makes a wonderful gift! There is no parade on earth like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and yes, I love the parade!",1266537600,18,1785,4.58125
