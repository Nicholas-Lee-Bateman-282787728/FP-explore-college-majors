8359170,4,B001NVRSGO,Was nice to watch a movie with my grandkids where I didn't have to be on guard for offensive language or inappropriate subject matter. Good story line and pretty good acting. Liked the racing footage for sure. It was a little slow at times but overall a movie well worth watching that had a good message about struggles and triumph.,1366329600,,332,4.55
