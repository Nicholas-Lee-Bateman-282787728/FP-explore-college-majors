5731386,4,B00COBE2N4,"Whether you find the subject material difficult or not one can't argue that Juliet Binoche's performance was beyond masterful.  Unfortunately it is all too true that women have been institutionalized for the flimsiest of reasons.  And frequently for their money.  It is a truly horrible history and in this case very difficult to watch.  In an enlightened world Camille Claudel would have been given her own studio (she was a gifted sculpter) to continue her work which meant everything to her.  But in a misogynistic culture, and with an unenlightened (dare I say evil?) brother she was denied this.  So very sad.",1404864000,2,614,4.970588235294118
5731387,5,B00COBE2N4,"French screenwriter, film editor and director Bruno Dumont`s seventh feature film which he wrote, is based on the works and correspondences of Paul and Camille Claudel and Camille Claudel`s medical records. It premiered In competition at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival in 2013, was shot on location in real asylums in France and is a French production which was produced by producers Jean Brhat, Rachid Bouchareb and Muriel Merlin. It tells the story about a middle-aged sculptor from Villeneuve-sur-Fre, Picardy in France whom after living at a mental institution which her family sent her to, is taken to an asylum in Montdevergues, France.

Distinctly and precisely directed by French filmmaker Bruno Dumont, this quietly paced and somewhat biographical retelling which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main character`s point of view, draws a literary and reflective portrayal of a woman whom after being in a relationship for fifteen years with a renowned sculptor named Auguste Rodin and spending the next ten years of her life in a self-imposed solitude, was diagnosed as schizophrenic and against her own will committed to a psychiatric hospital near Paris, France. While notable for its naturalistic and atmospheric milieu depictions, reverent cinematography by cinematographer Roger Arpajou, production design by production designer Riton Dupire-Clment, costume design by costume designers Alexandra Charles and Brigitte Massey-Sersour and use of sound, colors, light and real patients and their nurses, this narrative-driven story about a French author, father of four and diplomat who had the power to determine the outcome of his sisters` future, depicts an abridged and concentrated study of character.

This densely conversational, at times humerous and tangible narrative feature which is set in France in the early 20th century and where a daughter is fighting for her independence whilst holding on to her convictions about her former teacher and that someone is to poison her, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, subtle character development and continuity, the commendable emphasis on the similarities of all the people at the Montdevergues asylum, noteworthy scene of Camille reading in a church and the masterful acting performances by French actress Juliette Binoche and French actor Jean-Luc Vincent. A reverently cinematographic, humane and lingering homage.",1403136000,3,2448,5.613513513513514
5731388,5,B00COBE2N4,"This is one of Juliette's best films. Through her posture, facial expressiveness, and long thoughtful and thought provoking silences one can see the essence of her soul. A wonderful depiction of a not so mentally ill person thrown among and trapped powerlessly in with profoundly ill people . She is Camille Claudel in every sense of the word. MESMERIZING!",1398729600,5,356,5.0508474576271185
5731389,1,B00COBE2N4,"I admire Juliette Binoche tremendously, but why she chose to do such an excruciatingly dull film amazes me. It plays as though it were a narrowly focused one-woman show that's been stretched past the point of endurance. The dialogue (what little of it there is) is so random and pointless, one wonders why they didn't do the film as a silent film. [ I suspect that the director wanted us to be reminded of Dreyer's PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC; but all he succeeded in doing was robbing me of 2 hours I will never get back.] The only other actor of note in the film plays Paul Claudel, a real-life religious fanatic so sanctimonious he would have been completely at home with Joan's Inquisitors. A truly unpleasant film.",1398384000,5,714,4.542635658914729
5731390,4,B00COBE2N4,"It is very touching the sufferance that she endures.  She plays the part very well.
It helps to know the story. I enjoyed it very much",1396742400,2,134,4.153846153846154
5731391,5,B00COBE2N4,"Juliette Binoche just might be the only actress on the planet that could have pulled this off as convincingly.  I also suspect this was easily the most difficult role she's ever undergone.  It's all very real, thanks to the director's use of the actual residents, nurses and doctors that live and work in the facility.  The film focuses on just three days out of Camille's 30 years of confinement, an internment the family saw fit, essentially, to avoid public embarrassment because of her erratic behavior.  Her self-serving, colossally hypocritical, neglectful brother, Paul, the man who committed her to the asylum to begin with, and who at any time only had to say the word and Camille would have been set free, is just as disturbing in the movie as he is in books.

No, there's no car chases, gunplay or explosions to pacify the masses.  There's no music at all either, which, due to the dreary, monotonous existence experienced by Claudel, is a wholly understandable artistic decision by director Bruno Dumont.  What we have, however, is a thoughtful, quiet, important film, and Binoche gives the performance of a lifetime.  Beautifully photographed and lit, it paints an accurate -- and oftentimes ugly -- picture of the injustice exacted on this great artist.",1396483200,13,1267,4.971563981042654
5731392,5,B00COBE2N4,"I have seen her many, many times on her career as an actress and i will say that this is one of her best performances. Bravo Juliette!",1396224000,5,134,4.0
5731393,2,B00COBE2N4,"This movie is so slow and boring that it nearly drove ME insane. On the bright side, it had good acting. I just don't get the hype.",1437696000,,131,3.888888888888889
5731394,4,B00COBE2N4,"There are two French movies filmed about the life of Camille Claudel. The first one directed by Bruno Nuytten starring Isabelle Adjani and Grard Depardieu that was released in 1988 which depicts the relationship between her and Rodin, and the second one directed by Bruno Dumont released in 2013 starring Juliette Binoche and Jean-Luc Vincent which depicts a later episode of her life between her and her brother Paul when she was interned in a mental hospital. Personnally, I prefer the original one, but it depends on what you want to know about her life, unless you want to see everything (!).",1437609600,,596,4.852941176470588

5731397,5,B00COBE2N4,"If you are someone who is truly interested in the inner life of Camille Claudel and her feelings (grief, anger, paranoia, etc.) towards Rodin, this is a performance that makes you feel as if you were actually watching Camille.  Ms. Binoche is spectacular.  She projects abandonment and hurt and so many emotions while saying very little.  It's all in her face and movement.

  If you watch this just to see what the dynamic was between Rodin and  Camille but really aren't that interested in the life of Camille, this probably is not the movie for you.
Cannot say enough about Juliette Binoche's acting; just terrific.  Also, as this movie is based on fact, I dislike Paul Claudel more and more.",1427241600,2,695,4.733333333333333

5731399,5,B00COBE2N4,"This film is largely a tour de force performance by Juliette Binoche playing the film title's character, consigned to an asylum by her family after her failed relationship with Rodin the sculptor in the late 19th century led to her becoming a recluse. While Camille Claudel was in asylums for many years, the film's strength is to focus around three days in 1915 when her brother played by Jean Luc Vincent visited her.

Freely adapted from diaries, journals and medical records of Camille, her brother and the asylum's doctors, the film works based on its largely visual appeal and the use of real inmates from a lunatic asylum as extras and actors. Bruno Dumont the director admitted in an interview I read since seeing the film, that his luck was to find an asylum which let him both shoot there and felt the use of real inmates was a useful therapy for those inmates whose families were willing to give the necessary permissions.

Shot largely in the barren Alps Cote D'Azur region, the rural asylum and surrounding countryside provide the perfect backdrop as the emotions of Camille play out in anticipation of the visit by her brother and its outcome. Binoche in nearly every scene by nuance and facial expressions shows the torment and anguish the real Camille must have gone through as her artistic talents get worn down by the mood of the asylum and her interaction with the nuns and medical staff who run it and the inmates, when as the lead doctor admits she should not be there.

The arrival of her mystic poet brother who she hopes will obtain her release falls away as one realizes that he is the one who is insane and should be in the asylum but retains control over her and the doctors by having the money to do so.

One of those films the French in particular do so well, where not a lot happens action wise but by the end one feels like you have undergone a gruelling journey of revelation on the strength of the human spirit.",1416528000,3,1944,4.56160458452722
5731400,4,B00COBE2N4,"Camille (Juliette Binoche) is doubly bereft in new film Camille Claudel by Brunot Dumont. She is bereft of both the love of her life,Rodin,and the creation of her art,the sculpture,for which she manifested genius. However,she is not just incarcerated against her will,she believes people are trying to poison her food,so she is allowed to make her own. The elephants in the room,her artistry and Rodin,are kept firmly out. She was consigned to a mental hospital in the 1st place,because she had been not eating,while living in isolation. She had also been destroying her sculptures. In the film(she had separated from Rodin for 20years),she says he was stealing her ideas and taking her work studio. She is reminded of her sorrow of Rodin's actions by her anguish(after 1st being amused) while watching the inmates production of Don Juan.

Brunot usually uses non-professional actors. It was interesting to see the outcome of this. Binoche has proved her versatility and depth as an actress. Here the actor's age is the same as Claudel's (50) in 1915. She has been confined here by her mother and brother,Paul,the poet. Binoche is shown without make-up,her face like a blank canvas on which are revealed all her emotions. She registers the trees,the sky,the wind-swept grounds of the hospital and its inmates,who appear mentally and physically disabled, looked after by kindly nuns. The film gives us just 3 days in her life here,which would last for a period of 30years. She is shown to suffer under the patriarchy of the state and Catholic church. Her actions seen as scandalous by her family:the older lover,the bohemian life-style,the abortions. Her mother never visited her once. Paul(Jean-Luc Vincent) thought she had to redeem herself towards God.

Dumont chooses the documentary technique of filming in a real hospital with real inmates and nurses at Montedeverges,they are just being themselves(Dumont sought permission from inmates and their relatives beforehand).He is an atheist but seems drawn to transcendence in art not religion. He bases the film on a correspondence between Camille and her brother Paul. Binoche was asked by Dumont to ""Do nothing,be neutral"".The last 3rd of the film builds up to the visit of Paul. Now there is some question as to whether Claudel is mentally ill. The way Binoche portrays her, sometimes she helps the nurses with the inmates,she could be sane. Paul's spirituality could be seen as the madness,his certainty,his self-righteousness,his bourgeois morality. Yet he's also a genius of poetry. He rigidly resists her embrace,claims her incarceration is part of God's plan. He tells the doctor how easily artists become unhinged. The doctor thinks she should be allowed a wish to live alone near Paris. There is a real compassion in the depiction of the inmates. Binoche's performance recalls Falconetti in Joan of Arc and Garbo at the end of Queen Christina.",1416441600,3,2904,5.176595744680851

8583932,5,B00COBE2N4,"One of the saddest life stories ever. This movie is exactly opposite the first movie made about Camille Claudel. This is dialogue driven with raw emotion and circumstance in Camille's post-Rodin life, after she was installed into an asylum. Her family was cruel; it helps to research her story on the web to understand her history It is amazing to me that while she sculpted, she was so prolific, given the obstacles and shackles placed on her by Rodin, her family and society. In the beginning, she got a good break with her career in the women's school, but her love for Rodin was eventually her downfall ... and her family betrayed her even more. Great performances and a well-done, very intimate movie. Her story draws some similarities to Joan of Arc's fate -- keeping women in their place and taking their power away to make sure men stay on top. Claudel knew exactly what was going on with her art talent being closed off, and I wonder how long she kept hope that her family would do right by her? How she lasted that long in there, I have no idea. Betrayal by a mother is the most evil kind and her brother was a greedy coward, equally evil. It's hard to click, ""I love it"" = 5 stars, but these stories MUST be told truthfully, and I think the movie achieves that simply and as coldly as it really happened.",1477008000,9,1315,4.43801652892562
