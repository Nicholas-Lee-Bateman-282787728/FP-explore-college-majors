3816429,5,B001UXJGJ2,"As a ""child"" of Alzheimer's - my father and all of his siblings died of the complications of Alzheimer's - and an Alzheimer's Caregiver Support Group,leader I have found this series, which I was able to preview at NIH, before it's release, is an importnat educational experience for anyone who is/may be dealing with the Alzheimer's world.  I ordered two copies and will be sharing them with the members of our Support Group.",1250726400,2,425,4.821917808219178
3816430,5,B001UXJGJ2,"Though I've yet to officially add this DVD set to my home library, having watched the series numerous times on television, I assure any potential Amazon shopper this is a worthy investment.  Each installment is captivating and interesting and heart-breaking in its own right, and so masterfully composed!  I didn't have much knowledge of or exposure to the disease prior to my initial encounter with the documentary but was moved to tears by each individual story.  Every segment represents a different stage of this vicious illness, from diagnosis to death, and--apart from disturbing the viewer with how rapidly the mind and body can deteriorate--provides candid and nuanced views into the lives of those who could just as easily be our friends and/or family.  We also learn there is hope.  Great strides are being taken to address a medical issue many Americans fear.  I think sharing this series and the stories within it can only help to inform an otherwise unaware society, teach compassion and empathy as well as remind us to cherish every moment we have with those we love.  We owe it to those victims of Alzeihers to take full advantage of the life we have while we can.  Beautiful and relevant.  A must see!",1250726400,7,1217,4.868932038834951
3816431,5,B001UXJGJ2,"Hopeless helped be develop a clearer understanding about Alzheimers. I am now better able to understand what is happening to my dad, and prepare myself for what lies ahead. I am happy to have spent my money on such an important movie.

3816432,5,B001UXJGJ2,I saw this on HBO.  I was very impress on the mini series.  I work for a senior citizens organization and I would highly recommend anyone caring for Alzheimer patients or know someone who is.,1245110400,,191,4.428571428571429
3816433,5,B001UXJGJ2,"I work with the elderly.  This DVD collection was shown on HBO, I watched it and was so taken with the contents that I purchased it so that everyone at work could view it.  Understanding Alzheimer's is very important to everyone, not just health care workers.  This collection helps others to understand what the person affected is going through and what you can do to help.  My husbands grandfather suffered from this disease for 7 years until his death.  After watching the DVD's my husband now understands what was really happening.  He stated that he wished he could have seen this when his grandfather was in the early stages to help prepare for what was happening and how he could have helped more.",1242518400,21,704,4.682926829268292
3816434,5,B001UXJGJ2,"My parents are in their 90s and we just assumed when they were in their 80s that senility/dementia was just something that came along with the territory of advanced age. The five years between 85 and 90 were the most painful years of all our lives. We had no information on Altzheimers, no specialty doctors (like geriatric medicine), no housing facilities that would take both of them -- after 70 years of marriage they refused to be separated. We tried to get caregivers 24/7 but could only get untrained babysitters. And it cost a fortune. Then we viewed this wonderful documentary.

We learned a thousand things about the disease that we didn't know before. We learned what medications there are to slow down the disease. We learned that age is only one marker of the disease, as is heredity. The vignettes of the patients and families and doctors and caregivers are touching. They give the general audience an idea of what these people are going through. More important, though, is what the documentary tells us about our future as we age. Every man, woman, and adolescent ought to see this film to understand 1) what is happening to their dear ones and 2) the liklihood of your getting the disease.
As the documentary states, the brain is a muscle that can put out more neurons if it is oxygenated (exercise, exercise) and if one's lifestyle is sedentary, the brain atrophies.
Please watch this, and tell eveyone you know about it.",1242086400,41,1437,4.748
3816435,5,B001UXJGJ2,"My maternal grandparents both died having ""dimentia"". We now suspect that it was Alzheimer's. Three of their daughters later died of Alzheimer's. One of those daughters was my mother. I have been an active advocate for Alzheimer's research for 10 years.
Before Ronald Regan announced that he had the disease, no one talked about it, and certainly did not advocate research. I have seen the awareness grow over the years, but this particular series is the absolute best I have seen rearding Alzheimer's and the devestation it brings to families. I only wish that all major networks would play these tapes all in the same time frame (like the presidential speaches) so that more people will be truely aware of this horrible disease. We all are likely to get it eventually as we are living longer and longer. What a blessing it would be to humanity to eradicate Alzheimer's.
Huge kudos to Maria Shriver and the Alzheimer's Association for this wonderful film.",1242086400,20,956,4.907407407407407

I admit that I dreaded the whole inservice routine.  This was the best inservice I have ever attended.  Kudos to the families and Maria Shriver for bringing awareness to this awful disease.  There were no dry eyes in the building. The love and courage that these families had for their loved ones as they journeyed through these years was AMAZING.  I feel that every age group should watch these documentaries, we all see people with demntia.  This can help the old and young understand how these people feel.  I especially enjoyed the people in the early stages talk about how they feel and how they prepared their own families for the later stages.  Truley the best I have ever seen, have your kleenex ready.  It's not all sad, it is very touching to see what people with dementia can actually teach us about patience and understanding.",1314316800,3,976,4.654970760233918

3816663,5,B001UXJGJ2,"My husband was recently diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's, so I am trying to learn all I can about this disease.  What causes it?  What should I know to help him?  What is being done in the medical field to treat/cure Alzheimer's?

I found the video to be very helpful in answering these questions. The discs also covered many issues; including the physical and emotional impact Alzheimer's has on the ill person, the caregivers, and the family.

The medical information was very easy to understand.  The material was broken up into short chapters so that my husband could watch and remember a few highlights.  My husband, my adult son, and I watched it together.  We all thought it was beneficial to us.

My only disappointment with the Alzheimer's Project, is that I would have liked more information about early onset Alzheimer's.  Most of it was focused on those who develop the disease after the age of 65.

But, overall, I would say this video delivered what it promised--to change hopelessness into hope!",1300924800,5,1016,4.848837209302325
