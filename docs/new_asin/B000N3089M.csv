8174310,5,B000N3089M,"My old tape copy of The Green Iguana has long ago been worn out after many pleasurable viewings. I'm so happy to have it again, as part of this terrific set, on DVD.

Jack McCoy's films are delightful - the surfing footage is expertly and artistically shot, the accompanying music buoys things along and the film maker's eye for humor and fun is evident throughout. I especially love the parody of an over-wrought French black and white ""art film"".

These films were made in the early 90s, which was a fun time for surfing; technically, surfing was at a new plateau, with the short board era having reached some mastery and maturity; the state of the art of filming in the water (and even under the water with astonishing views from inside of a walled up wave with the surfer slicing his way across the aqua-blue face) and the music was not too over-bearing (no savagely brutal hardcore, just good rocking music). The talent on these movies are a pleasure to see and I especially enjoyed seeing ""Occy"" again.

I'm so glad that these have finally been issued on DVD and are available in the States. This particular set of films is a lot of fun to watch and all are keepers.",1236902400,9,1172,4.518867924528302
