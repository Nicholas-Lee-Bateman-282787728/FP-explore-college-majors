A trapped crew fights to save the station from self-destruction when an automated Cardassian security program is accidentally activated.
While working in the station's ore processing unit, O'Brien and Jake accidentally activate an automated Cardassian security program, which traps the pair and Sisko in the room. Throughout the station, monitors display an old message from Gul Dukat warning of a Bajoran ""worker revolt"" in the unit. Dax tries to beam out the three, but the computer requests an access code, which the Cardassians never revealed when they abandoned the station four years ago. Jake crawls through a pipe and opens the hatch to the ore chute, allowing Sisko and O'Brien to get out just as lethal neurocine gas is released. Dukat's image reappears, announcing that the ""workers"" have escaped, after which the doors to Ops all slam shut!
Sisko, O'Brien, and Jake are now trapped in an ore processing bay. A force field keeps Dax, Bashir, and Kira stuck in Ops, while another one holds Odo and Quark in the Security Office. Dax inadvertently activates the security program's second level, a program designed to release neurocine gas through most of the station in five minutes. Garak suddenly arrives at Ops, using his Cardassian access code "" which only works for him "" to enter through the force field. At his suggestion, Kira destroys the life support system, which stops the gas and gives them twelve hours to regain control before the oxygen is depleted. Unfortunately, Kira's phaser blast has activated the third phase of the program. Dukat's recorded message now declares that the station is programmed to self-destruct in two hours.
Garak tries to make the computer think he is Dukat, but ends up initiating level four of the program "" a series of phaser blasts which forces everyone to take cover. Then, to everyone's surprise, Gul Dukat transports into Ops to taunt the officers. But he can't leave the station when he tries, then a recorded message from his old superior, Legate Kell, appears. Dukat won't be allowed to flee his post during the ""revolt,"" states the message "" and his code won't stop the self-destruct.
They determine that the only option would be to reach a control junction and disengage the laser fusion initiator, but can't do anything while trapped in Ops. Meanwhile, Sisko, O'Brien, and Jake blast open the bay doors by detonating the unstable ore left inside, but are stopped from going far by more force fields. Back in Ops, Dax suggests creating a power surge to short out the force fields all over the station. The plan works, and Kira informs Sisko they have ten minutes before self-destruction. Sisko, O'Brien, and Jake have the only chance of reaching the control junction. Realizing they may not have time to disable the fusion initiator, Sisko decides instead to direct the explosion into the deflector shields. He crawls through a burning conduit, makes the adjustments, and as the destruct command is initiated, the shields absorb the blast and the station is saved.",1058832000,,3142,4.963946869070209
7902647,5,B000003K7H,"I love this episode because it is well written and (as someone already said) to see the look on Dukat's face. Well, I can stop the station from blowing up... *smiles* think again. Garak get's a good laugh from the whole thing. What else is new, right? They hate each other, and here is your enemy, being embarassed. Top notch!",1002153600,,326,4.45
7902648,5,B000003K7H,"O'Brien is tinkering with some computers deep in the heart of DS9, doing this sets off a Cardassian security programme designed by Gul Dukat to  prevent Bajoran rebels from taking over the station. Sisko, O'Brien and  Jake must work together during various tasks and obstacles to prevent the  station from being destroyed. In the height of the action Gul Dukat appears  on the station, it appears the creator has come to see first hand what his  programme can do...",966643200,,465,4.8354430379746836
7902649,5,B000003K7H,"This was a very good episode. Jake Sisko and Chief O'brien are doing work in a seldom used part of the station, Commander Sisko comes in and checks on them.  Jake and Miles while trying to decode some hidden Cardassian  computer codes trigger off a defense warning trapping them in that part of  the station, and putting the whole station on alert.
Apparently Dukat had  a computer program installed in case the Bajorans tried to take over the  station during the occupation.
Dukat noticing some problems, beams in and  finds Dax, Kira, Bashir, and Garak trapped by a laser beam from the food  replicator that is designed for everyone except Cardassians. But when Dukat  is finally convinced by Kira to deactivate the defense systems, his  over-confidence is shattered when his father secretly over-rides Dukats  codes, so that Dukat can't be a coward, and escape the destruction of the  station.
Meanwhile Jake, Ben, and Miles are trying to escape through  ducts, because a poisonous gas is being released. Jake is able to fit  through a small hole in the duct and open a door so that the other two can  get out.  The commander and Miles go through a firey tunnel to get to the  main computer system, and deactivate the self-destruct sequence before the  station is destroyed. O'Brien is overcome by the gas half-way down the  tunnel, and Jake pulls him out in time.  Commander Sisko makes it to the  main computer and deactivates the self-destruct sequence, just seconds  before the station is  destroyed.",962236800,6,1507,4.850393700787402
