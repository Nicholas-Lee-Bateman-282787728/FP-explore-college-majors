1354804,5,B00004U8H5,"This is the best prenatal tape I've ever done, I did this tape almost every day and had a pain and stress free pregnancy. I've done yoga religiously for years, and stopped taking regular classes at 4 months. This tape continued to be challenging throughout the rest of the pregnancy.
Looking forward to the yoga journal's postnatal workout tape.",994809600,5,345,4.864406779661017
1354805,4,B00004U8H5,"I borrowed ""Yoga Zone"" from a friend before buying this video. I like this video better because it shows all the poses in three stages of pregnancy, and how they can be adapted. However, I thought they moved through the moves very quickly, you really have to be ready with all of your props (chair, pillows, etc) to keep up. They spend a lot of time on Kegels, which is good for pregnancy, but I don't need a video for that (there's nothing to show in a demonstration!). Although the people in Yoga Zone are a little goofy, I think ""Yoga Zone"" does a better job of explaining the proper way the body should be aligned in the poses. So I do both tapes for variety.",993859200,4,663,4.26984126984127
1354806,5,B00004U8H5,"After reading some of the reviews of this tape, I purchased it and have been extremely pleased with it.  I have been experiencing a great deal of back and neck pain with this pregnancy, and after I do this workout, I feel terrific!  I feel it's a great asset in my preparation of my body for a natural birth.  Also, it provides the physical benefits of yoga without any of the chanting or meditation.",992822400,,400,4.378378378378378
1354807,5,B00004U8H5,"If you are looking for yoga to help prepare you physically and emotionally for childbirth, this is the video.  It is not rushed, so it is not for someone looking for a quick workout.  It incorporates many basic yoga movements, with modifications for each trimester.",991526400,,265,4.866666666666666
1354808,5,B00004U8H5,"I'm a novice at yoga, but wanted to find something to alleviate all the back pain I was having starting with my 5th month of pregnancy. This video is the answer. I do it faithfully each morning (it's divided into sections, which are about 15 minutes each -- standing poses; floor exercises, etc.).  There are three women in the three stages of pregnancy doing the exercises, so you know how to modify accordingly. It's a must-have for pregnant women. Actually, my husband (who has had some back problems) enjoys doing the video with me, too! The instructor is knowledgeable and straight-forward. It's great!",989366400,30,607,4.893203883495145
1354809,4,B00004U8H5,"Aesthetically pleasing to watch which is very important as opposed to another prenatal yoga tape I own which was made in the 80's where the women have outdated hairdos and the exercises take place in a stark, white, hospital type room. In this video the women are pleasant to look at and the background is calming with breaks showing waterfalls, lilly ponds etc... I have never done yoga before however and I must say I was shocked at what a workout this is. They don't mess around here and by the time I am done I am wiped out. Perhaps it is just me and my wimpy body. Also, I find that some of the moves are not explained well and I have to watch it over and over again to get it right. I have done the video now about 7 times and I still am trying to get some of the moves correct. All in all, if you have the time to do a 50 minute workout with no interruptions (like my kids yelling ""MOMMY""!!! during the middle of the relaxation segment)it is a challenging tape that I'm sure will keep you fit through pregnacy. They tell you that you can break up the tape and just do 15 minutes if that's all you have time for but with my busy day if I don't do it all in the morning before the kids wake up, forget it.",988588800,18,1210,4.045833333333333
1354810,5,B00004U8H5,"This is one of my favorite prenatal yoga tapes.  It combines stretching, breathing exercises, kegel exercises, and meditation.  And it is great for all stages of pregnancy.  But best of all it really relaxes your pregnant body physically and mentally. This is the prenatal yoga tape to purchase, whether you are an experienced yoga person or not.",987465600,22,346,5.035087719298246
1354811,5,B00004U8H5,"I would definitely recommend Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea.  She breaks up the workout into 3 sections approximately 15 minutes each, so you can do  what you have time for. I feel great after doing the stretches.  There are  3 woman who do the routine on tape, one for each trimester of pregnancy, so  you always have someone to follow. The tape has gentle music in the  background and a visually appealing backdrop for the class.  While this may  not sound important, it makes a huge difference when you are watching it 3  or more times a week.
The tape is run like a class, so you can just put  it in and go.  You don't have to wait while someone explains the pose and  then forms the pose.
My only criticism is that some poses are not  explained that well. So if you are a beginner or have never done a pose,  you may need some additional explanation that is not available on the tape.",967507200,510,887,4.265060240963855

1354822,3,B00004U8H5,"It seemed like a well-balanced exercize routine, but the instruction was not great -- unclear when to breathe, didn't give you enough notice on how you should be setting up, didn't give clear enough instruction on how to modify the poses.

1354832,5,B00004U8H5,"I had just started doing yoga for the first time a few months before becoming pregnant and wanted to find a workout I could use throughout my pregnancy.  I checked a few yoga DVDS out from the library and found myself coming back to this one.  I ordered it from amazon and am SO glad I did.  I have been doing it about once a week since the end of my 2nd trimester and find it extremely helpful for my 3rd trimester.  Some of my other workout DVDs are a bit too awkward now at the end of my pregnancy, but this one is not.  Definitely recommend!  Will be keeping to use during my next pregnancy!  I also recommend ""Spinning Babies Prenatal Essentials"" DVD, especially for 3rd trimester--the yoga flow is also very good (https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Essentials-Activities-Pregnancy-Comfort/dp/0977679365/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8).

PROS...
--The yoga moves flow and there isn't unnecessary talking as on other DVDs.  The first few times were a little challenging as I had to look up a lot, but after a few times, I can do the routine without having to keep my eyes open the entire time.  Very relaxing.
--Shiva Rae's voice is calming.  Great for days when I have little energy and don't want to hear a high energy voice!  I have fallen asleep on more than one occasion after the guided relaxation at the end!!
---This is not an invigorating workout where I sweat, but I feel I am doing good for myself and my baby AND that it is preparing me for childbirth.  My back pain has been minimal in my 3rd trimester and I really think it has to do with yoga/stretching.  She includes kegel exercises too.
--You can do a shorter workout (the first segment is only about 20 minutes) or the entire DVD (about 50 minutes).  I thought 50 minutes would be too much for me, but often I find the time goes really quickly.

CONS...
--Shiva says left/right and it is opposite for the viewer.  It is slightly annoying, but I mostly just mirror what she is doing and don't pay attention to the left/right.
--There is not an option on the menu to choose which segments you want to do.  So, if you want a shorter workout, you have to skip/fast forward instead.  I have gotten used to this, but it would be nice to have this ability.",1474588800,11,2221,4.591370558375634
1354833,5,B00004U8H5,"I only purchased this DVD as my exercise routine for my pregnancy and I started in the third trimester. I think it's a great DVD with a good workout. 4 stars because she does go through some movements rather quickly especially if you are just starting out, but once you go through the workouts a few times it doesn't seem too fast anymore.
The video has three women in it each in one of the three trimesters. Shiva is in the middle and demonstrates the moves for first trimester, Brita is on the left and demonstrates slightly modified moves for the second trimester, and poppy is on the right and demonstrates fully modified poses for third trimester.
I mostly follow poppy for third trimester, but sometimes I'll follow Brita because I'll find I don't need to modify a pose as much as poppy does. Shiva says in the video to follow whatever feels most comfortable to your body.
There is 4 different sections to the video, meditation/warm up, standing poses, floor work, and guided relaxation. I really like the warm up and floor work sections as they stretch out my arms and back which always feel like they need a good stretchin. The guided relaxation is a nice section too and serves as the ""cool down"" for the workout.

After writing my review I changed the 4 star rating to 5 because I really enjoy the DVD and it may have just been a little too quick for me at first because I really wasn't exercising like I should have been the whole pregnancy so it was mostly my fault for not having the endurance to keep up from being lazy the first two trimesters.",1474416000,6,1559,4.470175438596491

1354835,5,B00004U8H5,This video is great for all women during pregnancy. I did the workout 2-3 times per week in my apartment and it helped me quite a bit. The only regret i have is not doing the workout more often during those 9 months.,1471305600,,216,4.046511627906977

1354846,3,B00004U8H5,"This moved a little fast for me and it was kind of hard choosing whether or not to follow the first, second, or third trimester girl.  Personally, I think I would rather have a dvd that provides a separate section for each trimester so that I do not have to be distracted by so many different poses at once.  Regarding it moving fast, I really feel like in order to focus on breathing right, there needs to be a little more time devoted to each pose.  I would feel like I was just getting the breathing down and then have the instructor move right on to another pose.  I needed more time with each pose.  Also helpful would be a list of supplies needed listed in the product description or on the DVD somewhere to help with preparing for these exercises.",1463097600,,754,4.319148936170213

1354850,1,B00004U8H5,"I tried a number of prenatal DVDs, including Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga, Yoga Pregnancy, 10 Minute Solutions Prenatal Pilates, The Perfect Pregnancy Workout, Summer Sander's Prenatal Workout, and Suzanne Bowen's Long & Lean Prenatal Workout. I am currently halfway through my second trimester. Before becoming pregnant, I exercised about 3-4 a week and was a healthy weight. I typically did a mix of power or vinyasa yoga and weights.

I found this DVD highly disappointing. The routine was repetitive, boring, and not even a little challenging for me. Shiva Ria seems to approach pregnancy as a disability and views pregnant women as highly fragile. The variations for different trimesters were the most conservative of all of the DVDs I purchased. The woman in her third trimester spends a good portion of the video sitting in her chair. Shiva Ria spends 3-5 minutes talking about the workout before it begins. This intro is part of the workout chapter, so there is no easy way to skip to the start of the workout. I found no toning benefit to this workout, but sadly did not feel particularly stretched out either. I found that I got a better stretch from using the 10 minute stretch section at the end of Long & Lean.  DVD is also highly dated. I had a hard time getting past the solid colored unitards the instructors wore. However, the datedness would not have been a deal breaker for me if the workout was beneficial.

I can say that this workout most definitely felt ""safe"".  If a woman started her pregnancy with a poor fitness level or health complications, I can see how this DVD might feel good. However, I would still recommend Yoga Pregnancy over this DVD. I found Yoga Pregnancy to also be a very easy workout, however it was better rounded, more stimulating, and less irritating.",1455235200,5,1794,4.77741935483871
1354851,5,B00004U8H5,"I used this DVD every other day while pregnant with my first daughter. With my second daughter I never got around to doing this DVD, and totally noticed a difference. I gained a lot less weight when I used his and often got comments on how my arms and legs had toned. I had a lot less hip and back pain as well. My mother who would do it with me to keep me company even noticed increased mobility in her injured shoulder. The exercises are totally doable at all stages of pregnancy and a novice to yoga like me had no problem following along.

It's the only prenatal yoga dvd I've tried and I like knowing that the poses are safe and that they show the modification for each trimester, HOWEVER.... (as previous reviews have mentioned) the voiceover is pretty annoying... (I even mute the first part because she drives me crazy) and on top of being annoying it doesn't match up exactly in a lot of places with the movements the women are doing. The poses are easy but I feel like I get decently stretched afterwards. If you're a beginner they are simple, however another downfall is I don't feel like she explains the breathing and positions very well (I have other yoga workout dvds that do a much better job). If you're looking for a workout that will make you sweat even a little bit this isn't for you. I'm not super in shape by any means and this isn't exactly a work out, more like a relaxing hour of stretching and squats. A lot of the poses aren't held long enough to really get a great stretch but she talks so slow I normally hold everything a little longer than she says to and by the time I'm done she's finally moving to the next pose. I'm not sure if I'd recommend this... however I don't know if there's anything better out there soo....",1454457600,,1248,4.430434782608696

I have always been told it was amazing for you and took a chance on this DVD because of the reviews. First I will say I prefer Power and Vinyassa practice and prefer more intense work outs. With that being said, this DVD seems to do its job as far as practicing my breathing and opening up my hips in preparation for delivery. My complaint is the length of the video is too long for what it is. There is no menu- that I have found- to skip to the next section. The ladies voice has also started distracting me the last few times I have done it. This is great for someone with tons of time on your hands and wants to relax and really meditate to prepare for birthing.

1354885,1,B00004U8H5,"Keeping up a yoga practice has really helped maintain my physical, mental, and emotional health during pregnancy. I try to do it 5-6 times per week, once in a studio and the rest at home, so finding good DVDs has been really important.

My favorite is Hala Khouri's Radiant Pregnancy, but even the best program can start to feel stale if you do it 4 times a week for months on end, so I ordered 4 others to add to the mix and am reviewing them all here (in order of preference). Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea was by far my least favorite, so its review is listed at the bottom.

1. Radiant Pregnancy with Hala Khouri - 5 stars
- Pros: Includes 3 completely distinct programs for each trimester; each program is divided into sections so you can do as much or as little you want each day; Hala provides clear instructions and honest and relaxing dialogue; excellent range of poses, stretches, and movements; one of the few programs that can get my heartbeat pumping while also offering more moderate alternatives if needed; includes Kegel exercises starting in the 2nd trimester.
- Cons: Some poses require props, but I used everyday objects from the around the house (throw pillows, picnic blankets, and a towel instead of a strap) and they worked fine until I decided to go ahead and buy the real deal. Only problematic when I travel.
- In sum: Wonderful program, highly recommended for all levels of experience and fitness, should be a cornerstone of any consistent prenatal practice.

2. Element Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga with Elena Brower - 5 stars
- Pros: Clear and concise 30 minute prenatal routine, I can always find time for it; closely resembles a non-prenatal practice in tone and form, but with subtle variations; difficulty is enough to feel productive and strengthened but with well-timed pauses to regroup and recenter; narration is calm and soothing; no props needed; also includes a postnatal program (which I am looking forward to).
- Cons: Not much of a warmup before you begin, so may be better suited to people who are already familiar with yoga; not ideal for days when you have less energy and want something more restorative; only 1 routine so you probably need at least one more program if you plan to continue yoga throughout your pregnancy.
- In sum: Very good all around program for people who practice less frequently or need more than one routine in their practice.

3. Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga and Short Forms with Jennifer More - 4 stars
- Pros: The most challenging program I've found and a true vinyasa flow class, very invigorating and energizing; the full length routine is 1 hour and 15 minutes of constant movement (relaxation follows separately); despite challenging movements, subtle modifications make sure you stay stable and balanced throughout all three trimeters, with a model in each trimester demonstrating the correct variation; also includes a partner yoga routine and a separate DVD of ""short forms"" with 15, 30, and 45 minute routines for when you have less time.
- Cons: Would not make a good choice if you only select one dvd, program is too difficult for days when you have less energy, even the short forms (sometimes you just want stretching warm ups and/or restoratives, neither of which are offered in this program); mediocre production sometimes prevents you from getting a good view of the poses, which can be confusing if you're new to this program or to yoga generally; relaxation consists of 15 minutes of guided shavasana, no other meditation or restoratives, with narration I found more distracting than helpful.
- In sum: Great option for when you want a challenge and completely doable (don't let some of the reviews scare you off, you can always start with the short forms and work your way up to the full routine), would need to supplement with a more well-rounded option like Hala Khouri or Jane Austin for less active days.

4. Jane Austin Prenatal Yoga - 4 stars
- Pros: Upbeat and clear instruction; good emphasis on upper body strength in addition to legs and the pelvic floor; does have chapters (though they're not as clearly segmented as Hala Khouri); feel fully stretched and relaxed by the end.
- Cons: Only 1 routine; moderate difficulty wouldn't be hard enough for me to choose as my only program (still good as an alternate); pace is a somewhat relaxed and the full hour can feel a bit long; only soundtrack is ""om"" chanting which I can tune out most of the time but occasionally becomes distracting.
- In sum: Good program on the more gentle side but still engages the entire body.

5. Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea - 2 stars
- Pros: Honestly hard to think of many, but I suppose if you are really brand new to yoga and nervous about starting, then this incredibly easy program with demonstrations for all 3 trimesters could be a good option for you. You can also buy this as part of Shiva Rea's ""Yoga for Pregnancy"" set which includes a prenatal and postnatal routine, so perhaps you'd get more for your money that way.
- Cons: Really no challenge whatsoever if you've done even a little yoga or are in otherwise decent shape, it's really just 50 minutes of light stretching or holding very easy poses; on top of that, it's a poorly balanced routine, some parts of my body got no attention at all (lower back, calves, abdomen, arms) while others kept repeating the same movements over and over (hips, side waist, and quads); odd use of a chair in some poses when it really wasn't necessary, and they don't offer instruction for how to do the poses without the chair.
- In sum: Skip this unless you are really sure you want to start with the easiest possible program or got it as a gift (in which case who knows, maybe you'll like it).",1431302400,4,5712,4.684262948207171

1354897,4,B00004U8H5,"I started used this video 23 weeks pregnant, at the same time that I started having a lot of lower back pain. The stretches feel great on my back and I'm hoping with regular use it will strengthen my muscles and reduce the pain overall.

I did a bit of yoga before pregnancy, and the video is definitely low impact, which feels good since I move slower! The whole program is about 50 minutes long, with warm-up stretches, standing poses, floor work, and a guided meditation at the end. You can skip to different sections of the DVD. There is a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester model doing all the poses, so you can clearly see the modifications. Shiva Rea explains poses through a voice over, with reminders of modifications and remarks about how your baby is probably enjoying the yoga with you. :) A bit touchy-feely, but a comfortable pace for pregnant women moving slower, and lots of stretches to open hips, back, chest, and pelvis.

In terms of exercise intensity, it is at its best a stretching workout, extremely gentle, which I bet is super safe but might be suitable for the very end of the third trimester. If you practiced yoga before or just wanted a little strengthening and toning of your body the workout wouldn't bring contentment. Most importantly, a critical element lacking in this workout, in my opinion,  is a flow and a rhythm. Poses are isolated.

I like the sequence in that there's a bit of a warm up, standing work and mat work. The speaker has a very soothing voice, which is nice when you're trying to relax.  There are modifications depending on flexibilty and/or trimester.

But then there are the Cons:
  Those unitards are the worst. A pregnant woman in a unitard is a really strange look (no offense to pregnant women-- no one should wear a unitard). Who wears unitards anymore? I find it distracting. Secondly, the way this woman says ""exhale"" is super obnoxious. She says it like, ""exssssssale"" over and over again. If find it irritating. Also some of the voice commands don't necessary line up with what the yogis are doing in the video. It would've been better to have the woman leading the yoga session speaking as she was doing it rather than having them all stand there silently with the voice added in later. It's peculiar, especially when coupled with the strange unitard wearing women haha.  Other than that, I'm used to doing a vinyasa style yoga, with more flow in the sequence and this one doesn't flow very well. I'd say it's a good yoga video if you're relatively new to yoga and are looking for a good stretch with some fair modifications.

  During my first trimester I didn't do much yoga (or anything else) at all and now that I'm in my second I find this video to be a decent way to get back into yoga after a 13 week hiatus. Personally, I'm looking for a nice, relaxing and easy workout after work that won't leave me exhausted or overly energized. I think this video is enough that I can do it and still have enough energy to cook dinner and take my dogs for a walk, but not so much energy that I can't get to sleep if I do the video shortly before bed.",1405555200,,1891,4.392550143266476
1354956,2,B00004U8H5,"This video was just too weird for me.  I enjoy yoga for the gentle excercise, but I don't enjoy the type of yoga that is about meditation and breathing.  I only did this video once because it was just a little strange for me.  The three women in the video are in different colored unitards and it was just strange.",1405382400,,314,4.2

1354958,4,B00004U8H5,"I'm normally not into yoga, but I did this through both of my pregnancies to help stretch and loved it!  It's a good balance of relaxation, stretching and non-strenuous workout.  I like that she modifies moves based on size/trimester.  Admittedly, it's hard for an intense runner like me to enjoy the slow, boring breathing exercises, soft whispers and spa music, but I came to appreciate what this workout did for me during pregnancy.  And word to the wise, post baby back pain can be pretty intense, too, because you're always holding them!  Doing this DVD I learned which stretches really help me and still do them when my back is tired from holding my kids (2 and 9 mos).",1404777600,,675,4.638655462184874

1354962,5,B00004U8H5,"I did this video at least once a week throughout my entire pregnancy. At first, I felt it was bit underwhelming, but I kept doing it because I knew it was safe way to keep exercising. Later, as my baby grew and me along with him, I found that I enjoyed this video more. I was big and heavy, and this video helped me to relax and get some mild exercise in around that big baby bump! I actually followed the model in the second trimester up until I gave birth, which became more of a challenge in those last few weeks. It was just a very nice video, and I loved coming home after work, lighting some candles and just relaxing with these yoga poses.",1403136000,,646,4.134920634920635

1354964,5,B00004U8H5,"This video was exactly what I was looking for: something that would help me to practice my breath, reduce stress and back pain during pregnancy, and help stretch and tone me to prepare for natural childbirth. Although I've practiced yoga in the past, I am out of practice and my flexibility and balance is poor; however, the exercises I'm this were not difficult for me. At the same time, I can see that they will continue to challenge me as my flexibility and balance improves. I ended the workout feeling relaxed, energized, and healthy. This is not a yoga workout for people looking to sweat, but paired with light cardio, this will be perfect through all stages of pregnancy and beyond. There are three women demonstrating modifications for the three trimesters and the 2nd and 3rd trimester models looked like real pregnant women, not the incredibly fit and super-human pregnant athletes seen in other videos.

However, there is only one hour long option to view from the menu. I don't have a full hour to practice yoga each day, so that was a problem for me. Second, the 'modified exercises' are simply three women in a room doing yoga and I have to differentiate which one is doing what poses I should be following along with. I assumed there would be a menu selection and specific workout for each trimester. I've found more targeted and shorter yoga workouts on YouTube for free and so that would be my recommendation for those interested in practicing prenatal yoga at home.",1400025600,,699,4.511811023622047

You'll need a block, a mat, a blanket, a strap, and a bolster of some sort.  If you are new to yoga, and you purchase this DVD, you may not have those items on hand.
The other advantage to in person classes first is you have an idea of the flow and pose formation prior to starting this DVD.  Very helpful as the narration is a little off from the people posing.
I did find it helpful that there were modifications for every trimester of pregnancy.",1398988800,,625,4.132231404958677

Each exercise has three different women at various stages in pregnancy showing 3 different modifications for each pose, so you can see and follow whichever is most comfortable for you at your stage. This also makes it a great post-partum exercise DVD as your body heals and gets stronger. All of the poses are easy to follow and very well explained/demonstrated. You will feel refreshed, relaxed and wonderful each time you use this DVD.",1397433600,,565,4.775510204081633

1354985,4,B00004U8H5,"My best friend, who is also a well trained yoga instructor, recommended this video to me. The instructor moves slowly through basic poses, explaining them thoroughly.  While experienced yogis may find the narrative a bit excessive, it is essential for beginners who are using the video to practice.  Poses are modified for each trimester of pregnancy and could be further modified in either direction based on your yoga experience and comfort level with doing various poses during different stages of your pregnancy. This is a gentle yoga video and will not be intense like your advanced yoga classes (if you practiced regularly prior to pregnancy). Yet, you can still reap the benefits from a slower pose progression.

I read both the positive and negative posts. I was floored when someone said that Shiva refers to a ""crotch baby."" I went through the video the first time and had no idea what this reviewer was talking about. Then, on the second viewing, I realized how the reviewer misunderstood what Shiva is actually saying in the video. On two different occasions, Shiva says ""to make room for your GROWING baby."" She did not say GROIN baby or crotch baby. That is just absurd. The video pose progression is definitely slow, but that allows more time for you to settle into the pose, and is perfectly good yoga instruction and practice. Don't put too much stock in the negative reviews on this one, as this is a quality video.",1393632000,2,1433,4.817073170731708

There is so much more you can do pregnant and I feel like this video doesn't cover a wide enough range of poses or work/stretch all muscle groups fairly.  It is relaxing and I did it after finishing the Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol 1 and it served as a good cool down compliment (although I don't find the PPW1 to be difficult).

All that being said, if you are new to yoga this is probably a good video to start with.  None of the poses are complicated and it moves at an easy to follow pace.",1392595200,,653,4.150793650793651

I have an intermediate amount of yoga and dance experience so a DVD is more apt to be of benefit to someone who already has a sense of body awareness and proper alignment.

My motivation for trying this out was some fairly significant lower back pain that started VERY early in my pregnancy, at 8 weeks... I'm now 12 weeks.  I am relatively fit and slender and back pain isn't something I've ever experienced, not even in my first pregnancy.  I have had this DVD for 5 days and I've practiced the entire routine twice now (and once only did the first 20 minutes because that was all I had time to do).  I already notice a difference in my back pain!  I love how the instructor offers modifications for each trimester and also how she moves fairly slowly through each posture to give the growing bellies time to catch up :-)

The semi-conscious ethereal ruminations on the miracle that is your ""crotch baby,"" provided by the drug-addled queen of the faeries Shiva Rea is enough to inspire self-flagellation as a hobby.  You heard me right: she will refer to your child as a ""crotch baby.""  Let me repeat that.  Shiva Rea calls it a ""crotch baby.""  The first 20 minutes of the DVD (which you can't skip- you have to endure all of it) is dedicated to Shiva Rea addressing the camera, explaining to you the miracles of pregnancy and her own insecurities about her name Shiva Rea, but how she eventually came to terms with the name Shiva Rea and how it means peace and love and magic and dream catchers and earth, wind and fire and crystals and namaste.  This is like watching a rainbow die of prostate cancer.  Again, throughout all of this, there is no yoga happening.  When she finally gets to the yoga, there is more talking about her assistants, one of whom is referred to as Poppy (who I suspect hasn't come to terms with her name and secretly loathes Shiva Rea as a result)...then some yoga happens, sprinkled with more magical language about ""breathing into the earth"" or being a building with multiple floors and bringing your consciousness up and down the floors of your ""building""...and enough ""crotch babies"" , ""spiritual hearts"", ""lotus flower"" metaphors and ""namastes"" to make me want to take the DVD and punch myself in the face with it, or maybe just take it out on my poor husband who is trying his level best to be supportive of my yoga efforts, but has to leave the house in want of a stiff drink because he can't bear to hear the expression ""radiant pregnancy"" whispered by a sleepy vegan in Lululemon tights, set to a soundtrack provided by a relentless sitar that is evidently in quite a bit of physical pain.",1385424000,36,1878,4.6017964071856285

I went online and looked up prenatal yoga videos, just to try out...I saw the reviews for this video and thought I'd go for it. Great decision. This is a great video for someone trying Yoga for the first time while pregnant. The video clearly verbalizes instructions for movements (you don't have to watch the video to know what to do with your hands/legs/feet/arms) and demonstrates what to do for each trimester of pregnancy (you can use this video during your entire pregnancy). This video gives plenty of time to really stretch and feel the workout. If you need a little extra time on a certain stretch, you can always just pause the video and play it again when you're ready to continue.

The ""first trimester"" poses are the only ones that I find to be at my level, no matter what trimester I am in.  The second & third trimester poses are just not enough for my level of experience.  The tape is OK, I would encourage you to find a ""live"" prenatal yoga class instead - it is seriously one of the BEST things I have done to keep my body, mind and spirit in shape during my whole pregnancy.  I LOVE IT & I feel SO GOOD every time.  You will notice your balance and ability change week to week & will need to adjust as you go along.  It is one of the best ways to stay in touch with your changing body during this exciting time.  Find a live yoga class ladies, just DO IT!",1383868800,2,811,3.908536585365854

I like that the workout is low-impact, but challenging enough that it warms you up, and gets the heart going a little bit.  The stretches feel really good, and Shiva talks you through how each move impacts the pregnant body, and the labor and delivery process.  There are three individuals in the video, one for each trimester, so you always know what modifications to do.  All I needed was a chair and a yoga mat.  I would recommend getting a yoga block and a strap/band for third trimester.  I have a pillow nearby (in lieu of the yoga blankets they use on the video.)

It was sort of annoying to have to have extra items around to do the workout as well; I mean a chair is one thing, but who has a brick or a block hanging around?

It was also good on hard pregnancy days where it's hard to move much.",1382313600,,405,4.220779220779221
1355020,4,B00004U8H5,"There are a lot of prenatal yoga videos to sift through and choose from. Everyone is looking for something different from their prenatal workouts. As for me, I have (for the most part) kept up with a less intense version of my normal workout schedule. I do some form of cardio 3 times a week (usually walks or elliptical) and ChaLean Extreme weight training 3 times a week (modified with resistance bands). Starting in my 2nd trimester, I wanted to introduce yoga once a week, to stretch my sore muscles and unwind. I took intermediate yoga classes a couple of years ago, so I'm not new to yoga, but by no means do I practice it frequently. After researching on Amazon, I chose to try the 2 videos mentioned above. I will compare my findings for you in hopes it will help with your decision:

1. Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga - I tried this video first. It is pretty much what I was looking for. It is relaxing and the stretching feels so good on sore pregnancy muscles. It is not for those of you looking to work up a sweat. Anyone could do this video. The production quality is good (although I wish it was filmed on a beach instead of a studio:) and the 3 women representing the different stages of pregnancy are very helpful. You can modify each exercise as you need to. Shiva moves slow enough so that you're never unsure of what you should be doing, but not so slow that you're holding poses for an uncomfortable length of time. None of the poses feel unsafe for pregnancy and I love that she incorporates kegels. I also like that she keeps the hippy dippy yoga jargon to a minimum. My only complaint is the length. It is a solid hour. I think 30-45 minutes would have been more practical for busy moms-to-be. 4 STARS.

2. Jennifer Wolfe's Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga & Short Forms - I was attracted to this video because of the good reviews and I like the idea of being able to choose the workout length based on my schedule. I have only tried the 30 minute workout once. Honestly, I don't see myself putting in this video again. This is not meant for anyone who doesn't practice yoga on a regular basis. It is fast paced. Often I wasn't finished getting into one pose before she was moving on to the next. Women hefting pregnant bellies take more time to move! Some of the poses felt uncomfortable and frankly, dangerous. I was out of breath at the end, definitely not the relaxing stretch I was looking for. The production quality is low. Also, the technique of the instructor and demonstrators was sloppier than I like. I used to be a dancer, so I prefer more precise, graceful movements. 2 STARS",1382054400,,2596,4.428870292887029
1355021,3,B00004U8H5,"I think it will do since I don't want strenuous yoga/excercises. It was pretty boring, but is good to get you moving and stretching with low impact. I was not physically active before pregnancy so I am not complaining about the level of difficulty.",1381968000,,248,4.659090909090909
1355022,4,B00004U8H5,I really like how there are 3 levels one can follow depending on which trimester you're in.  This DVD has been great for me to keep myself moving through my pregnancy.,1381881600,,167,4.387096774193548
1355023,5,B00004U8H5,"I love this DVD. I was an avid yogi in the past, but have been off the yoga wagon for about 6 years. Since I got pregnant I wanted to get back into yoga to keep me and my back strong while my body changes. This DVD is wonderful! It feels so good to do. It might be slightly challenging if you have never done yoga before, but the modifications make it very doable at any stage of your pregnancy. If you are looking for a real workout, this might not be the DVD for you, but if you are feeling the typical aches and pains of pregnancy this DVD will give you some relief and major relaxation. Fair warning, there is a kegel portion that might bother some people, but they are important and great to do to prepare for childbirth and beyond.",1381104000,,737,4.125
1355024,4,B00004U8H5,Of course this can't beat the real class but being a mother of two and working full time its near impossible to get out of the house for a class. This is a great alternative.

1355025,2,B00004U8H5,"I wanted a yoga video for meditation and relaxation as well as exercise, but it wasn't very comfortable doing the exercises. I felt like I was straining the whole time.

1355026,2,B00004U8H5,The quality of this DVD is very poor.  It might as well be on VHS.  I'm 21 weeks and my only experience with yoga has been Yoga X from P90X.  This Gaiam routine was incredibly easy in comparison and did not leave me feeling like I had done much of anything to strengthen or stretch my body.,1379635200,,290,4.052631578947368

1355028,4,B00004U8H5,"I liked the relaxing pace of this video, more stretching than anything which is what I needed.
I wish it was a bit more consistent with the 'mirroring' of the poses, sometimes the instructors would do their left side to mirror our right side, sometimes they did the right side while we were doing the right side.",1379376000,,312,4.491228070175438
1355029,4,B00004U8H5,"I purchased the DVD with a little hesitation due to some of the mixed reviews.  Now, at 16 weeks pregnant, I have done this DVD many times and feel like I can accurately assess it through at least 2 trimesters.  As a background, I was in average shape (not a fitness buff but not a couch potato either) before getting pregnant - I used to run a couple miles on the treadmill several times a week coupled with a yoga or zumba class once a week.

This DVD is basically ""yoga light.""  It combines some basic yoga postures with A LOT of stretching, breathing, and relaxation.  It's fairly easy, even for beginners, and will not push you too hard.  Don't underestimate it's power to stretch and relax though - some days when I'm feeling especially tired or tight and I do the workout, I do feel noticeably calmer with more relaxed muscles, better posture, and better breathing afterwards.

What this video is NOT:  a cardio workout or a muscle strengthening workout.  If you are looking to tone, sweat, or really feel like you worked out, this video is not for you.  As a relaxing and stretching tool though, it's great, and I would highly recommend.  Also, because it's not too intense, I can see myself doing the video comfortably throughout the rest of my second and third trimesters.",1378425600,2,1282,4.578947368421052
1355030,3,B00004U8H5,"The video itself is good but the case was damaged. It had a chunk missing out of the top. I have not watched the whole video yet, so hopefully it didn'd damage the DVD",1378252800,,167,3.9411764705882355
1355031,4,B00004U8H5,"I've never done yoga before in my life, so I have nothing to compare this to, but with my experience, I can say that I really love this video! I started it when I was already in my 3rd trimester of my pregnancy so I love that fact that there's a level of difficulty/level for how far along in pregnancy u r in. It focuses on stretches and relaxation, it helped the swelling and numbness in my feet and hands, I sleep very well on the nights I do the video.",1378166400,,456,4.021978021978022
1355032,4,B00004U8H5,"I bought several pregnancy workout videos, and thought it would be a good idea to write a review of all of them at once: Amira's Bellydance and Yoga for Pregnancy; 10 Minute Solutions Prenatal Pilates; Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga; Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1; Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout.  Let me start this by saying that before my pregnancy, my level of fitness was somewhere in between couch potato and world-class athlete - I usually worked out a few times a week, doing 20-30 minutes cardio and some light weight-lifting, but was not running marathons or anything like that.  I wanted to maintain a similar level of fitness during my pregnancy, while building muscles and flexibility specific to labor and burning enough calories to offset my very increased appetite.  Whether you get one of these or not, my overall advice is that working out during pregnancy really, really helps - it helped me stay more comfortable as I expanded and my center of gravity shifted, it helped me feel good about the changes that were happening to my body, and it helped prepare me for a relatively smooth and manageable labor and delivery (no medication).

Amira's Bellydance and Yoga for Pregnancy: This was one of my favorites, and I think in the long run it really helped prepare my body for labor; it also helped me to relax, stretch, and feel good as I got bigger and bigger.  Some of the reviews here point out that it is not a very intense workout - that's true, but I felt like there was plenty of stretching and strengthening, and through much of my pregnancy high intensity was not what I was looking for - the goal of this video is not to increase athleticism, but to help the body adjust to pregnancy and prepare for labor.  Amira is a very encouraging coach, and much of the commentary is designed to be relaxing, informative, and comforting; I also appreciated that she looked like a real pregnant woman in the video, rather than a super fit, still skinny woman who just happened to have a bump.  The bonus material - interviews and some dance performances - was not all that appealing to me, but I liked Amira's intro statement about her own experience and the history of bellydance.  The interviews might be more interesting/helpful for someone who doesn't have sisters/girlfriends who have been through this before.

10 Minute Solutions Prenatal Pilates: This was another favorite.  I really like the format, where you can choose how many of the 10-minute segments to do, and in what order, and I felt like the workouts were manageable and well-suited to pregnant bodies.  Towards the end of my pregnancy, I was doing the flexibility workout more than the others and often just one or two at a time, but for the first two trimesters, I would usually do three of the workouts at a time.  I was somewhat familiar with pilates already, but not an expert by any means, and I found the workouts easy to follow (with a little practice needed the first few times); I think this would be good for those new to pilates, and the format means that even people who are not used to working out can start off with a manageable amount and work up from there.  The instructor sometimes gives conflicting cues about breathing patterns, but generally she is clear, informative, and easy to follow.  Seeing someone well into her 3rd trimester doing these exercises was very inspiring.  Some of the workouts don't require any equipment, but some require light hand weights and/or pillows.

Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga: I didn't get this until near the end of my pregnancy, but the few times I did it made me wish I had it earlier.  The pace and level of difficulty are definitely geared towards beginners, and much of the emphasis is on toning and stretching in ways that are particularly geared towards pregnancy and labor (kegel exercises and hip stretches).  This is a very relaxing and slow-paced video - not a killer workout that will leave you sweating and panting.  There are modifications for each trimester, but with many of the moves, I found I could do the 1st trimester version and didn't need the modifications.  It did require some equipment: a yoga blanket (? Not sure what this is - I just used a regular blanket folded up), a strap (I used the belt from a bathrobe), and a yoga brick (this was needed for some of the later trimester modifications - I just skipped it).

Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1: I had read great reviews of this, but was disappointed and only used it a few times.  Basically, it was too strenuous for my pregnant self - the instructor is a world-class athlete and I guess this is the workout she had put together for herself during her pregnancy - nothing wrong with that, but her level of fitness and her fitness goals were just a little different from mine, and I really couldn't keep up.  That said, there were a few moves that I liked and did separately when I just needed something quick (like the labor squats).  I did like it that kegels were built into this.  If you feel you are up to it, it is an intense and thorough workout.  The final section, on preparing yourself mentally by doing an intense endurance exercise, seemed silly to me at the time, and it still seems silly now that I've been through labor: 3 minutes of arm circles is difficult, but conquering this difficulty will not be enough to prepare you for making it through labor (which can be manageable if you are well-prepared!).

Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout: This video was ok, and definitely offers a thorough workout, but it was not my favorite.  It has three separate workouts, one for each trimester, and you can choose the complete version or an express version for each one (I think the complete version is just the express workout repeated a second time) - I almost always did the express version.  The 1st trimester workout was way too hard for me (I wanted to spend most of my 1st trimester sleeping), the 2nd trimester workout was just about right in terms of intensity, and the 3rd trimester workout was a little too light (for me).  The moves here are fairly traditional and will certainly tone major muscles groups without any frills; I would have appreciated more stretching.  There were a few pregnancy-specific moves that I often did separately (labor lunges, plie squats).  Summer Sanders and her trainer/sister-in-law are encouraging, but their chatter doesn't hold up well and starts to get annoying after watching it a few times.",1378080000,6,6463,4.707187222715173
1355033,5,B00004U8H5,"I bought this in my third month of pregnancy and have continued to use it through out. Its easy to follow along and I really like how it has three people to follow depending on your stage of pregnancy and how you feel. I also feel so good after I do this and I find it challenging enough to feel I have had a good stretch yet also feel very relaxed afterwards. I have minimal background experience with yoga and feel anyone can follow along. I even brought this on a family vacation because it helped me feel so much better, (my sister in law had a copy too and she loves it as well). Excellent purchase!",1377993600,,604,4.170940170940171
1355034,2,B00004U8H5,This video was my least favorite of the prenatal workout videos i bought.  I have done yoga on and off for years and consider myself in decent shape and usually swim or bike for workouts but wanted something a bit lower key for pregnancy.  This seemed to focus more on strength and difficulty than just getting a decent workout with movement and stretching.  I found it quite exhausting for a pre natal workout.  And i must agree with other comments that shiva rae is a bit annoying...,1377734400,,485,4.540229885057471
1355035,5,B00004U8H5,"I love this DVD.  It got old by the third trimester, but I quickly got over it each session because body and baby needed it.  It felt so good to relax with this DVD.

1355039,5,B00004U8H5,I purchased a couple prenatal DVDs during my first trimester and this is the one I stick to. The music is very calm and it is really easy to follow along. They have modified poses for each trimester which has really helped move me along now that I am in my third. I don't watch the video if full much anymore but have used a lot of the poses on my own for when I need a good stretch. I've started taking a lot of the movments I learned in this video and encorporating them into my workout now when I am in the pool now that I am getting bigger the pool really takes the weight off my joints and the poses from this workout really help me get a good streach in my hips and lower back. I've had a lot of lower back pain and this video always makes me feel so much better after.,1374710400,,775,3.911392405063291

1355041,3,B00004U8H5,"This video is just okay.  I still do it regularly because I find that prenatal yoga really helps with aches and pains, but I think it could be a lot better. Don't be fooled by the cover: Shiva Rea is not pregnant in the video, which I think is strange. I also don't like how many chair exercises there are. And, this is silly, but the unitards that the ladies wear in the video are dated and depressing to me.",1373760000,2,409,4.1125

1355044,5,B00004U8H5,Dont be fooled the first 3 mins make it look easy but WHEW this is quite the workout! It is pretty neat because it has 3 women representing each trimester during the workout so it makes it easy to follow! Make sure if you are in your second-third trimester that you have a block and a stretchy strap before you workout. Thats one thing that is required with this video which I didn't know so I had to improvise with a big book and a belt. Overall this is a really great dvd and it even has a guided meditation at the end which is really great! Good luck ladies!,1373241600,2,561,4.109090909090909
1355045,4,B00004U8H5,"I checked a few DVDs out of our library to see if I could find one that I would want to use through my whole pregnancy. Side note: I also watched the video ""Yoga Journal and Lamaze present: Yoga for your pregnancy with Kristen Eykel"" (it seemed to have quite a bit of promotional material where I wanted yoga and I didn't like the jarring motion of many of the moves) and ""Yoga for Pregnancy, Labor & Birth Starring Colette Crawford"" (which seemed like they locked two pregnant women in a small windowless room to do yoga with a creepy older lady). I've read positive reviews of each, so maybe they just weren't my style, but I didn't get what I wanted out of them. What I was looking for was something to help me relax and focus on myself and my body. I wanted calm, easy movements, with a few challenging moves to push me just a little further. My yoga goal is centered relaxation and control of my body for delivery. In that regard, this video is great. It is gentle and quiet, and her voice is very... I don't want to say monotonous, but I think that may be the best word. But I like that the whole video is hypnotically peaceful since it helps put me in the yoga headspace. If you're looking for a workout, this is not the video for you, since there is only a small portion of the video (the planks) that I find difficult, and I am not in great shape. There are other sections where I can push myself a little further, but that is the only section where I feel like it's a real workout. I do like that each section is focused on the muscles and positions that will help with delivery, and I love that they include Kegels.
I have a two-year-old, so it took me about three viewings to get through the whole video uninterrupted (it's a full hour long). I do wish you could jump to the cuts between sections (sitting, standing, relaxation, etc) but there is no menu for that and scene jumping on the remote puts you randomly in the middle of the section. I just wrote down what the time was for each break so I can fast-forward when I don't have time for the whole thing. I also paused a lot to spend more time on some sections and less on others, but over time I realized the video comes back to the same areas a few times, so if you don't feel like you got enough of a stretch, you'll probably get that muscle again later. Oh, and there are a few places where the directions she says are not what the actors do, so it took me a few viewings to not mess up at those parts.
All that being said, I do find that this video leaves me feeling relaxed, centered, and more in control of my body. I felt at ease and motivated with this instructor, and I find the modifications for each trimester helpful. I'm glad I purchased this video since it has become a pleasant part of my pregnancy where I get to focus on just me and the new baby. I definitely recommend it for people looking for the same peace and control that I am, even with the few set-backs it has.",1373155200,2,2955,4.195079086115993
1355046,1,B00004U8H5,"I was very fit before pregnancy, doing P90x, Insanity, ect. and wanted to keep working out while pregnant. So, I got this thinking it might be a nice way to keep a little workout going and do this a couple times a week with another program. BUT I found this to be very boring. I'm not a huge fan of Yoga, but I do like it as a break from cardio routines throughout hard workout weeks. But this was just way too slow for me. I like doing my workouts in the morning, so trying to do this at 5am was awful. I couldn't stay awake.

Sorry... 1 star only because it's the lowest possible rating. :(

I would probably only recommend this for people who are looking to begin working out for the first time when they are pregnant.",1372723200,,721,4.142857142857143
1355047,3,B00004U8H5,"I purchased while I was in my first trimester to keep in shape during pregnancy and stretch my muscles as things got moved around.  At first the dvd was great.  By the end of the second trimester, I was more annoyed than anything with the dvd.  It just became old and the softness of the talking was just too much for me.  It then just sat on the shelf.  It does show what moves to do for each trimester which is really nice since you're less mobile as pregnancy goes on.",1372291200,,471,4.131868131868132
1355048,4,B00004U8H5,"I started using this video around week 34. It's a nice, gentle option for the third trimester; not sure if I would have found it as worthwhile earlier in my pregnancy. I like the fact that there are three levels of modification according to how pregnant you are and/or how you're feeling on any given day. The 50-ish minute length feels just right. If you're looking for a ""workout,"" look elsewhere. If you're looking for a good way to stay flexible, open and relaxed as your pregnancy progresses, this might be a good option.",1372291200,,526,4.6063829787234045
1355049,4,B00004U8H5,"Overall I've enjoyed this yoga dvd. I'm not very coordinated and I'm not a very flexible person, I usually find yoga to be uncomfortable and un-enjoyable.

The yoga track has three gals, the leader is 1st trimester, then their are two back up girls one in her 2nd and one in her 3rd trimester. It's nice to be able to see the modifications for both and adjust accordingly.

I had decided to give yoga a try since it comes highly recommended for pregnant women, I started this a week or two into my second trimester and and now approaching my third. I'm only able to yoga about once a week but even in that time I've found the lessons very helpful and have found a wee bit more control over my muscle groups, it also aids tremendously with all the painful stretching occurring in my tummy muscles.

Within the yoga tracks, there are three exercise regiments; a mediation and pogayoma, stand poses, and floor work. I've done all of them at least once, I really enjoy the first track since keeping my stress levels down and being able to actually accomplish some of the poses makes it more enjoyable to me. When I feel more rambunctious I'll do another track that's a bit more rigorous. Overall I enjoy the options.

Also included is a prenatal massage track with three segments as well. My husband watched the first track and he plans on watching the other ones as well. He's found that giving a little massage here and there can help me relax quite a bit and that makes him feel more involved. (He's also a huge advocate of belly rub time, cause he gets to rub my belly, talk to the baby and feel him move a bit. But that's slightly separate from this review - I just highly recommend it for any upcoming parents trying to bring dad more in)

On another note of my husband, he also tries to do the yoga with me. Granted he obviously could do a regular yoga session and does not need a prenatal yoga but he enjoys doing it with me. He says that since it's more relaxed he can just do it with me and not feel overwhelmed. I think he also enjoys it since it's supporting me through something I don't enjoy as much but I'm pushing myself to experience. (No enjoying has more to do with just not liking yoga... not any critique on this product.)

Sorry if this is a little random and ranty, but overall I enjoy this prenatal yoga. I think it would be great for woman who already know what they are doing and it's great for woman like me who aren't quite as into yoga but are looking for a relaxation/stretch/ exercise to aid them through this exciting period in life.

Good luck! Hope this helped a bit.",1372118400,,2597,4.353305785123967

I like I how she very clearly shows three women in all three trimesters so you can adjust your own movement and how she softly talks to you throughout poses so that you don't necessarily have to watch the TV the whole time. I also like the assistance elements of using a chair, block, and belt. And the division of sections allows you to pick and choose how much you want to do each session. The only thing I dislike is that it tends to repeat a lot of poses (in different ways), which is probably good for newbies to yoga, but as someone who has been doing yoga for years, I'd prefer a little more variety.

Many of the poses can't be easily or safely accomplished during your last trimester, so the majority of the activities involve you sitting on a chair and just watching the DVD. I also wish the sections were divided into DVD chapters so you don't have to fast forward through the intro every time you play it.

We had an old version of this yoga video from the library which was excellent, but when we bought this hoping it also contained a guided massage like the old video. This DVD does not have the massage section anymore like the old version did. So, don't buy it thinking that you will get the guided massage because it isn't there even though one of the pics shows the massage section. Also, just an FYI Shiva Rea is not pregnant in the video. In my opinion this doesn't really affect the sequencing, but if that's important to you then its good to know. This is one of the more old fashioned yoga videos that doesn't have the teacher speaking in real time, but rather, she does a voice-over narration. We also really liked ""ZenMama with Rainbeau Mars: Prenatal Yoga Workout"" (Rainbeau is pregnant and she does real-time explanation of the poses which makes it feel more like taking an in-person yoga class).",1369008000,,1065,4.670212765957447

This video is nice because there are 3 girls in the video and you just follow whichever one is in your trimester or you feel comfortable with.

During the stimulation stage of IVF your ovaries get very large (due to the number of follicles in each one, I have 10 on each side)and you look like you're 5 months pregnant.  It can be very uncomfortable and the process itself is very stressful so I got this to help me relax and stretch.  I started off following Shiva and as my lower abdomen got more swollen I followed Britta (2nd trimester).  The modifications using the block and the strap are great (I purchased them through Amazon for a great price after using the DVD a few times).  This most certainly is helping me relax and unwind.  I have taken a few yoga classes here and there but am not really that familar with the practice and I feel like I can easily keep up, everything is very well explained.

The yoga is mild and gentle, not a ""hard breathing"" workout - it's more stretches (lots of side bends which help with low back pain) and some thigh strengthening squats.  If you're looking for more vigorous yoga, don't order this.  If you need slow breathwork, gentle movements, and rhythmic flows, this is perfect.  Shiva is in her first trimester and leads in front.  The two ladies behind her are in their second and third trimesters, and adjust their movements accordingly - so it's just one series, and you watch the person who coincides with which trimester you're currently in.

You need to have certain things in your home to do many of the poses/stretches (I don't have a dinning room chair, for example), and the music is VERY annoying. It's not in the same style as her many other DVDs. What is nice about the video, is that she has three different women in different trimesters, which makes doing the DVD at anytime during your pregnancy easy to follow. I agree with another reviewer on here, that at times it was hard to follow what she wanted, and by the time I got some of the moves, she moved onto the next one.

It was hard to do this in front of the t.v. because you not only need some space to do the positions, but some of them are chair-based, so you need enough space to have a yoga mat with a chair. In a tiny Boston apartment, that was a little difficult. They also don't warn you that for the second/third trimester, you might want a yoga block. Didn't have one for a while, and let's face it - a preggo lady has other things on her mind than to go out and get a yoga block. However, it was easy to follow and relaxing.

I felt like the movements were pretty fast. I am new to yoga, so I'm not sure what is standard, but feel like I get a much better workout when I hold poses much longer (feel sore the next day).

1355102,5,B00004U8H5,I love prenatal yoga and this video has been great for me. I've used it through my entire pregnancy and it's one of the few things that give my achey body relief.,1358899200,,162,4.09375
1355103,3,B00004U8H5,"I thought that this was worth the price $9.99 because I certainly felt I got my money's worth after doing it only a handful of times. If you are used to a strenuous yoga regimen or do yoga fairly regularly, this will not be much more than a decent stretch. I am in my third trimester and follow the second trimester woman throughout because the third trimester model barely does anything in my opinion. Sometimes you ate asked to move from one pose to the next too quickly and other times too slowly. All in all, it is appropriate for a moderate in-home routine and the length is nice.",1358726400,,585,4.376146788990826
1355104,5,B00004U8H5,I am currently in my last trimester and have been using this video since my first trimester. I love all the modifications for each trimester. I am relatively new to yoga and found this a great yoga video for beginners.,1358640000,,218,4.475
1355105,3,B00004U8H5,"This video is okay - don't get me wrong, I am definitely on the hippie yoga side, but Shiva is a little too much in this video.  First off, the video is very much of the hippie, cheesy yoga-zen side, which in itself isn't a deal breaker.  The actual yoga in the video is pretty good - it's nice and thorough and really stretches every part out, unlike some of the other yoga videos out there.  What I don't like about it is that it is about 53 minutes long and you can't really do specific chapters so you have to do the entire thing.  I don't always have 50 minutes to do yoga everyday and I would like to do just hip openers or standing poses or something, but the video doesn't let you select.  (I am using the previous version of this video, so it's possible they have fixed this.)

I much prefer Crunch Yoga Mama, even though it's a little dated or Krystel Eykel's Yoga Journal prenatal video.  The Crunch one is really through and only 35 minutes and the Krystel Eykel one has a few chapters for energizing and relaxing sequences that you can do separately (they are about 30 mins and 17 mins) or together for a longer workout.

Overall, I would give this one a pass and try one of the other ones.  Also, they wear these ridiculous one-piece unitards in this, which is completely silly.  I can't imagine wearing that if I was pregnant.  It just seems a little over the top to me.",1358640000,,1385,4.268199233716475
1355106,5,B00004U8H5,I highly recommend this collection. I love how there are positions and props for each of the three trimesters. I like Shiva Rea's instruction. I found this to be very helpful.,1358553600,,175,4.67741935483871

1355110,5,B00004U8H5,"I have used this throughout my pregnancy. I have been practicing yoga for about 6 years, but stick with a relatively gentle practice. I haven't seriously progressed into the more vigorous or acrobatic asanas some folks do. In many ways, I'd say I still do a beginner's practice. With that said, I would suggest this video to a true beginner (out of shape, no experience with yoga) or to someone who wants to gear down to a more gentle routine for pregnancy.

I also bought Complete Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga & Short Forms 2 DVD Set by Jennifer Wolfe and have used it a couple of times. There is a lot I like about that video but it is a little too intense for my personal taste. Also, I don't like the way it is shot. Many times, the videographer does these close-ups on the faces of the models, not sure what the purpose of that is. It's not a big deal at all really, but I notice these details every time and it just bugs me. Overall I prefer the Shiva Rea video and, if I recall correctly, it was significantly cheaper when I bought it. So another reason to go with Prenatal Yoga by Shiva Rea.",1357689600,,1092,4.27536231884058

At first it seemed to amplify my pain but then a few days later while taking a two day break, i noticed i could actually sleep comfortably. My doctor recommended doing prenatal yoga since i Have fibromyalgia and have had several flare ups during my pregnancy( long story). I ordered the dvd and it was shipped promptly. So far I have only done the opening sequence and the cool down sequence because of my pain levels and due to bed-rest 2 weeks after starting. I started it back up last night but it will take  a few days before i see improvement again. I may do two days of it and one day of rest this round and after 2 weeks incorporate another sequence until i can do it everyday.",1357603200,,739,4.24113475177305
1355112,3,B00004U8H5,I like Shiva's normal workouts but this dvd is a lot of twisting and bending over which I have been in structured in other prenatal yoga classes to not do. I like doing it everyone once in awhile.  I highly recommend Blooma's Prenatal dvd with Sarah Longacre over this one.,1357603200,,273,4.46
1355113,5,B00004U8H5,"This video is a relaxing, effective way to exercise while you are expecting.  The poses are not too difficult to achieve and the moves flow softly.

I was always relaxed at the end and felt that I got an amazing stretch. Although it is not as intense as regular yoga, it was good enough to help with breathing technique and stretching.",1357516800,,316,4.448275862068965
1355115,4,B00004U8H5,"Like other reviewers said, the intro is very annoying. It was fine to watch/listen to once, but the forced calm tone/affect is annoying, and it's nothing that anyone would need to hear more than once. It doesn't look like it can be easily skipped, so maybe I can fast forward past it next time, or I might just use that time to get my mat and other yoga props ready.

That was the ""con"". There are a lot of pros, too. First of all, the DVD does a great job of showing and telling you the different ways to modify the poses for your ability and trimester. If you've done yoga before, this DVD will be no problem. If you haven't done yoga before, some of her terms or explanations might be confusing at first, but if you just mimic what's happening on the screen, you'll be fine. I found that it was challenging enough to feel like I was doing something, but not so hard that I was questioning the safety of the poses. It went by pretty quickly, and you could certainly stop and start, or just do part of the DVD.

Overall, I do recommend this DVD.",1357516800,,1046,4.225

I don't really have time to go to a class right now so I thought I'd try this out and I'm just not happy with this.  First of all the workout is over an hour long which for me is just too much to do at once.  (I can do a class that long but DVDs for some reason need to be 30-40 mins for me) and I also didn't care for the style of teaching in the DVD.  Wasn't a fan. I haven't really found another one I like yet, however, maybe I just need to suck it up and go find a class. :)",1357430400,,553,3.5454545454545454
1355117,2,B00004U8H5,"My husband got me this DVD for Christmas t and I tried it for the first time the other day at 17.5 weeks.  Firstly, the woman is highly annoying.  The first part is some hippie, pregnancy is wonderful and magical and blah blah blah.  So I just fast forwarded through that part.  After getting into it a bit, all the moves are okay but she goes through them like she's trying to get it done with so she can go off to the rest of her evening.  This video should easily be 2 hours long, but it feels soooooo rushed.  And lastly she for some reason says ""exale"" instead of ""exhale"" which gets fairly distracting.

I may use this after 36 weeks but I can't see using it again before then.  I'll be looking for a new yoga DVD for the time being.",1357171200,,739,4.118881118881119

I know that has little to do with the actual workout but I found it distracting. Each woman did a different move to show modifications for different trimesters of pregnancy, which is helpful in theory, but I found that it was harder to follow along.

Yes, the narrator is obnoxious at times, the vocal descriptions aren't that helpful (you really need to watch what they're doing), and the music/relaxation fountain between segments is seriously cheesy -- but I feel GREAT afterward, and that is what counts. Plus, it's a fraction of the cost of taking a class.

They modify the poses to suit any trimester too, which is really nice. I would recommend this to any expecting mother especially if you experience back pain/discomfort. I didn't find it too hard either and she always makes sure to tell you to take it easy and only stretch until it doesnt feel good any more...not the case in a regular yoga class!",1355184000,,545,4.25

1355131,5,B00004U8H5,"I have been doing this yoga video every single morning for a month now. I am 33 weeks along and I had been attending the yoga classes at my gym up until I bought this video. I have been doing yoga for years but as I started to get farther along in my pregnancy I couldn't continue to do the standard yoga positions and the instructors at the gym gave very little to no advice on how to modify the positions.

Before I bought the DVD I attended yoga classes about twice a week at the gym. Even then, I still had many aches and pains daily in my lower back and shoulders caused by my ever changing pregnant body. Now that I do the Shiva Rea DVD daily, my aches and pains are completely gone! There are some days when I just cannot fit the 50 minute routine into my day and I can feel the aches in my joints and muscles start to come back. My pregnant friends keep complaining about all the pains they are having and I keep telling them to just do this simple yoga DVD once daily and they will have a great pregnancy.

I did read a few negative reviews on the DVD. As far as her babbling on and on in the beginning of the video, yes, she does speak for a while and you only need to watch that section once. However, the next time you watch it, one press of the skip button on the remote takes care of that problem in .25 seconds. I'm not sure who is using a video cassette these days so I don't really see fast forwarding as an issue. I also think the video is perfectly challenging for me. I'm in great shape and even work out at the gym twice a week in addition to the yogo at home and I still find parts of the video challenging. But then if you find it too challenging you can always follow the woman who represents the 3rd trimester. Her version is easy enough for even beginners. As for me, again I'm 33 weeks along and I follow the 1st trimester most of the time and have no problems.",1353888000,,1888,4.045454545454546

1355133,1,B00004U8H5,I tried doing this video twice and got so bored doing it. It's basically a lot of gentle breathing techniques. Not enough for someone looking for a good yoga  work out.

1355135,4,B00004U8H5,"After reading the negative reviews I opted not to buy this DVD but as luck would have it a friend of mine gave it to me this week as a prenatal gift. I do not consider myself a yogi as I previously only did yoga on occasion for mental stress relief and breath control rather than as part of my general work out methods. I am about 18-20 weeks pregnant and asthmatic but I had no problem doing the unmodified version of the poses. The problem was that a lot of the poses went by so fast that before I could get into it all the way and feel the much needed stretch it was time to go on to the next one. I simply hit the pause the button during the poses that really work for me and held it as long as I wanted before moving on. Problem solved.

The dvd is broken down in 15-20 minute segments which is nice because it lets me quit when I want because there is a natural stopping point built in every so often. As an asthmatic i get very short of breath very quickly now so even just 20 minutes of this and I am panting. The good news is that you can choose by segment to either do standing, seated or a combination of moves. The bad news is you need some supplies for many of the modified poses: a chair, a small sturdy rubber brick, a rolled up blanket and something like a tension band or towel.

All in all, I felt that despite the pace (which can easily be adjusted for), the stretches are quite  useful and quite helpful in loosening and strengthening the lower back and pelvic floor and relieving some of the common minor aches associated with pregnancy.",1351987200,,1558,4.135313531353136

Its easy to follow even if you want to close your eyes and really focus on the movements and breathing.  If you're looking for a mild workout, I recommend this DVD.

It is broken up into sections:  a warm up, standing positions, sitting positions and rest/meditation at the end.  There are also 3 women, one showing each trimester.  This has been my favorite part, that they show you how to modify the poses based on which trimester you are in.  Especially being a beginner, I'm glad they show an easier/modified version of the pose.  And the fact that it is broken up into sections is nice, too.  I started without the standing positions; then, as I got more used to it, added those into the mix, too.

Like I said, I'm no yoga expert, so some may say they don't like the poses or the voice or don't get much out of it, but if you don't know any better, this is probably the video for you!

1355144,4,B00004U8H5,"I recently bought this DVD and have had the opportunity to use it a couple of times already.  I am very pleased.  I have never done Yoga before, and always wanted to.  I am 26 weeks pregnant, so starting late in the second trimester.  Since I am a beginner, I simply watch the poses then rewind so I can do them while Shiva talks you through them.  Seeing all 3 woman at the same time (camera angle permitting) is very helpful.  It does seem to be fast paced (i.e. it moves from pose to pose quickly sometimes) but I simply pause or rewind it if I think she moved on too quickly, which isn't often.  She has a lovely voice and is very soothing. and the background music fits nicely with everything (nice and subtle, yet not too quiet).  Definitely well worth the $10.  One last thing about the props: the first time I watched and followed along all I had was the chair.  I sit with a blanket on top of a yoga mat (to keep the blanket in place on my wood floors - the mat wouldn't even be necessary if you have carpet).  I use a pillow instead of a yoga blanket and I don't need the yoga strap or yoga block, but this is partly because I am very inflexible and can't do very much (yet!).  So don't let the fact that they use these intimidate you because it's quite easy to follow without them or to substitute them (like I did with the pillow).
Like I said, I am a complete beginner, brand new - this is my first time doing yoga ever!  I find that most ""beginners"" have at least taken a class and that, to me, immediately promotes you to amateur status, so I wanted to give other beginners out there an opinion from an actual beginner and also point out that, though I find little to fault with this DVD, I also know nothing about yoga.",1347753600,7,1735,4.158682634730539

1355151,4,B00004U8H5,"Being fairly new to the whole pregnancy deal and still something of an amateur in regards to yoga, I've been trying to find a good DVD that's comparable to my non-pregnant yoga workouts  and will get me through the next months.  This one seems to fit the bill.  The workout is fairly mild (no perky extreme yogi mamas here) but with careful focus on solid poses that encourage precision in the pose.  The workout covers a good range--floor, standing, meditation, even a pelvic floor workout.  While I have to agree with other reviewers who felt Shiva moved through poses a little too quickly (lately I've been trying to work on holding my poses in my own makeshift practices) I feel she encouraged focus on getting each pose just right.  The whole practice is very relaxing--my first impression was of a workout and teacher a little too holistic and hokey, but after about ten minutes I really found myself peaceful and engaged.  Beyond the cramming of the poses, my only other complain was the setup of the DVD.  Shiva encouraged a build-up to the whole workout, but unless one wants to skip through the DVD and hope to get the player to stop at the right moments, one sort of has to watch the whole thing. Which isn't necessarily bad, but a scene selection option would have been nice.  But overall I am quite fond of this workout.  I felt both relaxed and exercised afterwards, and I think with the modifications I can keep this up all through my pregnancy.",1345248000,,1460,4.602316602316602

Why i recommend this product?
 This CD begins with meditation and then exercises.
  - The instructions are very clear
  - Demonstrated well for each trimester
  - Based on your time availability you can do atleast few stretches(Something is better than nothing)
  - Personally i feel confident after finishing.

I absolutely loved the relaxation guidance. Its short, so sometimes I played it twice :) It helped me during delivery too, especially breathing and relaxation (Shive guides you on how to relax from the top of your head to your toes with directed and controlled breathing). I liked this DVD more than the ""Postnatal"" Yoga with Shiva Rea, because this ""Prenatal"" workout is gentle and not exhausting, however I found ""Postnatal"" to be too challenging for a beginner at times.",1344384000,2,789,4.602836879432624

This DVD does provide both relaxation and strengthening. However, I found it to be best for beginners. The instructor moves very slowly which can be frustrating at times. The DVD is also very long, so those of you who are still working may find it difficult to squeeze this workout in. It is possible to stop at any point, but then it feels like you are missing something from your workout.

1355158,2,B00004U8H5,"I bought this DVD after reading the good reviews on Amazon.com.  I already own ""South Beach Prenatal Yoga"" (which I bought on amazon, but they no longer have in stock) and really love it...but I thought I would like a second DVD just to switch things up.

As a background on myself, I am a runner, former gymnast (years ago!) and generally physically fit.  I am 15 weeks and jogging as my main aerobic workout, but use yoga to relax and stretch.  I do not have any experience with yoga aside from prenatal (took a class my first pregnancy, and regularly did the south beach dvd)

I was really disappointed in this DVD.  It is extremely slow moving, to the point that it is not relaxing, just annoying because of all the pauses.  The workout is choppy, rather than one move flowing to the next.  And while I understand some people may need to scale back their workout as the pregnancy progresses, it seems that Shiva assumes a 3rd trimester mama cannot do anything physical (""Poppy"" spends most of her time just sitting or standing, not really doing anything).  While the video is voiced-over, they explain the next move completely (as in 10 second explanation) before even moving; I found myself often ahead of the 3 women.  I forced myself to finish the workout but felt like I wasted an hour.

If your physically fit and looking for a good use of 45 minutes, I highly recommend the South Beach Prenatal Yoga. It also has 3 different mamas for the different trimester (and modified versions) but more to-the-point and definitely more of a workout (although, not to the point that I even need a shower afterwards; I like to do it before bed and I sleep so well!)",1342915200,,1662,4.543624161073826

I will say that it is helpful if you have a general idea of a flowing practice, because that is the style she teaches. That way you don't have to keep looking at the screen but she does explain transitions very clearly. She doesn't hold poses for too long but that is what the pause button or back button is for, or just hold a pose longer before catching up with her. I also like that it is almost an hour and there are three different segments, so if you don't have time for the whole thing you can have a good stopping point. I tried the Crunch Yoga Mama dvd and I thought this was much better specifically for pregnancy.

In general the DVD is extremely slow moving. It's hard for me to even emphasize HOW SLOW this practice moves. It's broken up into three parts, which makes maintaining a flow very difficult. She explains every single move in detail, and speaks faster than she actually does the moves, so you're left WAITING for her to finish. Overall, I was not satisfied. It was nice to see the adjustments for those in each trimester, but she moves so slowly, that I don't even think it's necessary.

1355169,3,B00004U8H5,"I am 20 weeks pregnant and I've been practicing yoga for five years. Obviously, nothing compares to attending a yoga class. But our schedules don't always afford us the time to do so, or some people do not have access to a prenatal yoga class. Prior to becoming pregnant I practiced hatha, vinyassa and Bikram yoga with four different teachers each week. Since becoming pregnant I've tried the following yoga DVDs and here is my opinion of each:

1. Gaiam Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea
Professional production quality. My local library had a copy so I tried this very early in pregnancy. At that time it seemed too slow for me. For that reason it might be perfect for someone with no yoga background. I have a feeling it might be the right pace for me as I enter into the third trimester, when my belly is so big that I really need to slow down anyway. I will give it another shot in a few weeks.

2. Complete Prenatal Vinyassa Yoga & Short Forms 2 DVD set with Jennifer Wolfe
This was the right DVD for me early in pregnancy (0 to 18 weeks). I love that there are four workouts at varying lengths. This workout is challenging, moving in and out of poses at a good clip. Recommended for those with previous yoga experience. Production quality is mediocre but that does not bother me. The studio where they shot the video must be in an urban location because at moments you can hear the sounds of traffic passing by. If I have learned one thing in yoga, it's that there's an art to ignoring environmental stimuli. Learning to focus inward is a good mental challenge. Jennifer Wolfe is sweet and easy to follow.

3. Element: Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga with Elena Brower
Perfect for me right now, at 20 weeks. Excellent production quality shot in a beautiful, serene landscape. I love that Elena Brower uses voiceover to narrate rather than having the person doing the yoga narrate. She explicitly explains the positions in a lovely, calm voice. I love the style of yoga, moving in and out of poses with breath as opposed to holding poses. I found the workout to be the perfect length, not too long.",1332374400,4,2094,4.505263157894737

1355172,2,B00004U8H5,"While the pace of the dvd was very relaxing and non-invasive, I found the moves to be superficial and basic at best.  Having the third trimester mommy on a chair for the majority of the workout was kind of ridiculous in my opinion.  There is no reason she could not have done those moves and it should have been offered as an extreme modification for those experiencing any difficulty in their pregnancy rather than 'this is what you should do in your 3rd trimester'.  Just because you have a big belly, it does not instantly preclude you from being able to execute many yoga poses.

I was much more impressed with the Jennifer Wolfe's Prenatal Vinyasa - faster paced, much more challenging and you really felt like you got a significant workout/stretch!",1331596800,2,754,4.6893939393939394
1355173,4,B00004U8H5,"I bought this DVD mainly because of the top review mentioned it has one section for massage; but it does NOT'  I was not aware that review was left soooo many years ago and the version has changed.  No wonder there are two different package images on product page.  You are getting the green box, not the white one that has bold font saying massage section.  They eliminated the massage section but throw in some free classes online (which I did not check out yet) that you need to follow the piece of instruction in the box.

Other than that bid disappointment of massage section, the yoga section was great.  It is relaxing and easy to follow.  I am at my 2nd trimester and have been having lower back pain and leg cramps since I am pregnant.  Practicing this yoga helps loosen up those tight joints and give me more energy.  Background music and instructor's voice were both calm and relaxing, I do feel really good after practicing it every other day.  I think my body is better prepared now and ready for regular gym routine again.

One star is taken because of the missing of massage section but the yoga itself is definitely worth 5 stars to me.  Just be aware - this yoga is not intended to keep you maintain weight or tone your muscles.  If you are looking for a more intense yoga to keep you in shape, you may want to try something else.  If you are just like me, looking for yoga to relax my soul and body, you can't go wrong with this DVD.

I thought yoga would be relaxing and also help me stay flexible during the final (and very cumbersome) trimester. Though I didn't use this DVD as much as I had hoped (sleep always seemed to win!) when I did use it I was very relaxed and in tune with my baby. It is easy to follow without being slow paced (a pet peeve of mine), and it also seemed very safety oriented for the different stages of pregnancy.",1316390400,,543,4.281553398058253
1355193,5,B00004U8H5,"I don't think I could have survived pregnancy without this dvd. I have a very physical job, and it always left my upper back, knees, and hips miserable at the end of the day. However, even if I only did the warm-up (which was sometimes all I had energy for), I felt way better. The video is relaxing at the same time as being invigorating. Afterwards, I almost felt ""normal."" I also think this would be a great video for people with very limited flexibility who aren't pregnant - it has great modifications for all the moves. I did this video even on the first day of my labor! I recommend it highly.",1316131200,,600,4.31858407079646
1355194,4,B00004U8H5,"On pregnancy #3, I have now tried just about every prenatal yoga DVD on the market (amateur youtube videos included), and this one is far and away my favorite.  For starters, it is not a yoga routine awkwardly altered in an attempt to fit your growing belly into something you used to do.  Instead, it is a yoga routine *designed* for the particular peculiarities of pregnancy.  Shiva Rea does a brilliant job of centering and focusing the mind, body, and spirit of the expectant mother.  The routine greatly reduces stress and tension while improving muscle tone, flexibility, alignment, and circulation.  This is *not* a high-impact workout; don't expect to work up a mega sweat.  But, do expect to come away refreshed, rejuvenated, and filled with new peace and self-awareness.

My only complaint (and the reason for the 4-star rating) is the format of the DVD.  The navigation set-up is not particularly useful, and there is no simple way to bypass the lengthy intro in which Shiva Rea narrates her own journey and lays out some yoga basics.  It was worth watching the first time, but it is irritating to have to fast-forward through it before you even arrive at the menu screen for EVERY subsequent viewing.  All in all, it's worth it to arrive at such a wonderful feeling at the end.",1316044800,,1289,4.7657657657657655
1355195,5,B00004U8H5,I liked how this video had three models to pattern your workout after depending on the trimester you are in.  It helped flexability and muscle control.  Very calming transitions and soothing environment created.,1315872000,,211,5.363636363636363
1355196,5,B00004U8H5,This is my second pregnancy and I am much more tired this time than the first and so my normal workouts just don't get done for lack of energy or drive.  This video is great for giving me the up I need without straining too much or feeling like I didn't do enough.  I walk a mile before I do this video and feel great,1315785600,,317,3.8615384615384616
1355197,2,B00004U8H5,So I am at the beginning of my 2nd trimester and love Shiva Rea but I was so board by this DVD. This would be good for someone very new to yoga or much further along in their pregnancy.,1315440000,,185,3.769230769230769
1355198,4,B00004U8H5,"Didn't have much yoga experience prior to using this dvd, but I do enjoy it, good stretches, I do feel good after completing this workout.",1315267200,,138,4.56
1355199,4,B00004U8H5,"I am pregnant with my second baby and decided to do yoga this time around.  I am in relatively good shape, definitely active (was working out 4/week pre-pregnancy), but have minor stamina problems.

I have never done yoga in my life before.  The advantage of this Shiva Rea's prenatal yoga routine is it's so easy that even someone who has never practiced yoga before can start doing yoga in her second trimester of pregnancy.

On the flip side, however, this would be a disadvantage to someone who practiced yoga pre-pregnancy already, then it is indeed way too easy.

This DVD is definitely not meant to be a workout.  It is to stretch and relax you.  I do find it relaxing, I do this routine in the morning before I go to work.  It does not make me sweat or leave me feeling sore.

I also agree with previous reviews that even though there are 3 women in 3 trimesters of their pregnancy, you should just do whatever you feel comfortable with.  Personally, I don't use a blanket and I don't use a block when I bend down (I am 29 weeks).  I am balanced and flexible enough without the block, at least for now.  I definitely do not follow the woman in her third trimester, I doubt I ever will.  But, if you need to follow her, it's good to have her there, it's provided an option to make this routine available to anyone.

All in all, I would recommend this DVD with caution.  Know what you're looking for, realize that this is not a fitness routine, and evaluate yourself well.",1314835200,,1478,4.402214022140221
1355200,3,B00004U8H5,"I am not even in shape right now, and I find this video to be too easy. I can't do it as a standalone. I'm 18 weeks, and I do this as an extra if my Element yoga dvd didn't cut it and I'm feeling especially tense or like I need to MOVE a little more.  It's not that's it BAD, it's just...EASY. I have been doing the first trimester moves the whole time, and honestly don't think I'll be resorting to the blocks any time soon. I find that I get a better workout in a shorter time with some of the other dvds out there.
In the interest of full disclosure relating to being in shape, I was carrying 30 extra pounds from my daughter when I found out I was pregnant with number 2, and I had just come off of a spring full of working out, including yoga, kettlebell gym classes, and meeting with a trainer twice a week, plus jogging and any gym class I could fit in around finishing school and raising a toddler. Which I guess is to say: I am fat, but not really that out of shape; I've been pretty active this pregnancy with pilates and yoga, and walking, and hauling around a 22 pound toddler.

I would recommend this if you are new to yoga, or already have a pregnancy fitness routine that needs just a little more to make you happy.

edited to add:
I forgot about the magical 1.5 acceleration on the PS3, which is our DVD player. So suddenly I've gone from a 50 minute yawn of a yoga dvd to a 35 minute, faster paced, much better for me yoga dvd. I also modified some of the ""floor work"" to make it a little harder on my upper body.",1314489600,,1530,4.042904290429043
1355201,4,B00004U8H5,"I bought three pregnancy workout dvds at the same time: this one, The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol 1 by Karyne Steben, and Baby Bells by Lauren Brooks.  I wanted a variety of workouts, both to keep me relatively fit and strong, and for toning/stretching.  I am 7 months pregnant and have been keeping active right through my pregnancy, walking, swimming, and bought these dvds about a month ago.  When I first played this dvd I didn't play right to the end as admittedly I got bored and thought it too easy. Especially after doing the other two dvds, which provided me with a really good workout. Then I started doing this dvd straight after one of the others, as a warmdown/stretching workout which I enjoyed. And now that i'm heavier, I like to do this workout as a stand alone session as well as still doing following one of the other dvds.  I like it as it relieves tightness and any aches and pains, and it is perfectly safe for everyone (I would pass this one onto my friend who is pregnant but not as fit as me, but I wouldnt with the other two dvds as I feel they are a bit more advanced/require a good level of fitness/strength).  The workout gives you a choice of following someone in her first trimester, one in her second and one in her third, so you get a choice of who you wish to follow, but even though I am in my third trimester I follow the lead lady Shiva, as the third trimester option in my view is way too easy, although good to have the option for those who might need it.",1314316800,,1496,4.290780141843972
1355202,3,B00004U8H5,"This is a decent, gentle workout.  It is not the most exciting, but is do-able, and does relax you.  I had a VERY rough first trimester, and went from being active (1-2 hour workouts 4-5 times a week) to lying in bed moaning for a couple of months.  I too found the extensive use of props a bit annoying (who in the world has a freakin' yoga blanket?  & if you do, you are NOT going to dig this workout, as you are truly an aficionado.  I used some old pillows instead).  I find it best to do this at night, since it is sooo slow-paced it kinda puts me to sleep, as oppose to energizing me.

This is a great way to gently stretch out tight muscles after a period of inactivity, but if you're looking for a workout, this is not it.

I'm very disappointed that there was no massage section, as that was the feature that ultimately swayed me into buying this DVD! I kinda feel like I got bamboozled!!  :-(

I found some of the exercises to be a waste of time, as they did not really stretch or work anything for me.",1309132800,,464,3.967741935483871
1355209,5,B00004U8H5,"This is the video that turned me on to Shiva Rea. At first I thought it was too slow and easy for me to get a good workout (I had to workout during my pregnancy because I had gained a lot of weight and didn't want to become unhealthy).  This will not lead you to break a huge sweat but especially during pregnancy you need to prepare your body for labor and help keep aches and pains at bay. For example, you will get leg cramps and this will help stretch out your calves and hamstrings. My right groin muscle start to pull doing my last trimester and this helped stretch it. It is calming, relaxing, and it gets you through basic movements that will give you some muscle tone and keep you limber or increase your flexibility. Even though your are inhibited by your growing belly, you still need to maintain your flexibility and muscle tone and this video will help. It also helps you to forget about all your worries and just meditate a little each day. Especially the last trimester as you start to taper off your exercise, this video is great to do. And for those women who are afraid of miscarriage, this video is light enough to not be a concern at all. It is so safe. In fact I was able to do all the movements of the lady in the video in her second trimester all through til the end. And my non pregnant friends who were new to yoga loved the video because it was challenging enough but slow enough to be able to.follow and the moves weren't too complicated. It also has good core exercises like planks and all fours exercises that help you to keep your core, arms, and pecs strong. Oddly, there are not many downward dogs in this. I was told by my Pilates instructor that downward dog was a great pregnancy stretch but Shiva doesn't have much of it here. She has a short modified one. I guess some people feel the baby being upside down (or right side up) is not good for the baby? See? Shiva is really careful in this video. Also the set and music are really nice and quite relaxing.",1309132800,,1992,4.26984126984127

This didn't seem like a ""workout"" to me at all- just 50 minutes of slow stretching.  I wasn't challenged at all either.  If you are looking for something that will keep you in shape I would look elsewhere.  If you are looking for some VERY easy stretching then this might be the video for you.

Well of course with pregnancy comes weight gain and I was having severe headaches. I decided to order a prenatal yoga video to see if I could relieve some of the tension in my neck. Ive taken maybe two or three yoga classes in my life - Im more of a cardio and weights girl. There are three women featured in the video - one for each trimester. I am in my second so I followed Britta. The next day after doing the excercises in the video I woke up feeling 80% better. I did it a second day and my neck pain has essentially disappeared. If you got a massage before or after using this video Im sure it would be an awesome combination. There is an instructional section on massages in this video as well.

If you're new to yoga, you will probably have to look at the TV and pause and rewind a few times to make sure you're doing the poses correctly, but I got the hang of it quickly.

Up until now, I have been an avid jogger and cardio exerciser, so I wasn't sold on the benefits of yoga until a week into this DVD. While I don't break into a sweat doing this, I can already feel a difference in my body. I can't quite put my finger on it - whether I feel stronger, more centered, more relaxed - but my body already craves yoga like I used to crave jogging if I hadn't been out in a few days.

I think I will be using it in conjunction with other workout videos, plus the gym, but primarily for stretching and relaxing.

The modifications for different stages of pregnancy are great, and easy to follow thanks to the three models, each representing a trimester.  I have had the opportunity to take classes with Shiva Rea in person and liked her well enough, but I was really moved by her approach to a prenatal workout.  It was sensitive and thoughtful without being too spacey.  She reminds you to breathe deeply, and think about bringing more oxygen to your baby.  She leads side stretching, and suggests visualizing making more space for your baby.  I found these real physical connections between my movements and my baby really nice and inspiring.  Her interview video where she discusses her own pregnancy was also very well done.

My only regret is that the video is not a very taxing workout (you can also read my review of the video I purchased because I thought I needed more of a challenge - it didn't go so well!).  It would be nice if there were more challenging modifications suggested for more experienced yogis.  But I find it really hard to find fault with a video that takes away all the aches and pains of a day of pregnancy, leaving you feeling more comfortable and relaxed.

I got a cold weeks 33-35 and couldn't do yoga as I couldn't breathe very well, and I felt a marked difference in my back comfort.  I couldn't sit for longer than 20 minutes without feeling pain.  Once I started the yoga again in the mornings, I haven't had anymore pain during the day.  I have continued to sleep on my sides and am able to maneuver around well, I think due to stronger core and back muscles from the yoga workout.  I highly recommend this workout for pregnancy.  I'm also planning to use the guided relaxation at the beginning of labor.",1300406400,,845,4.310126582278481

It leaves me feeling as though I have done some great stretching and toning.  It's easy enough for those who are out of shape to do, but can be made more challenging for those who are more in shape.  It's nice to be able to choose the different segments to do.  My only complaint is that the last segment (Relaxation) could use a little more...it seems bland.

I really like how there is a model for each trimester and the exercises are modified to fit the needs of each trimester. This makes me feel confident that the movements I am doing are safe for me and my baby as my pregnancy progresses. The only reason I could not give this product 5 stars is because the voice-over does not always match exactly with the exercises the women are doing, so you have to pay attention to their movements rather than listening to the instructor.",1299024000,,739,4.481481481481482

1355239,3,B00004U8H5,"Pros: It's very gentle. I think this is a good series for anyone fairly new to yoga, or anyone who has been away from a practice for a while. It carefully focuses on hard to reach areas such as the lower back - perfect for when that lower back pain begins to set in. It's also simple enough to only do a portion of the series depending on your needs or energy level. I have found that some days of my pregnancy I'm more energetic than others. Even getting in 15 min. of yoga is worthwhile. I  also sometimes use a portion of it as a cool down after a run on the treadmill, or to simply relax.

Cons:  The routine in its entirety is pretty darn boring by the 6th or 7th time you do it. I have had to mix it up with a few other yoga routines during the week to keep it fresh and get in some extra stretching. I was hoping the DVD had 3 separate routines for each trimester, but instead it's just the one with adjustments depending on which trimester you are in. (I can't imagine doing this specific series for 9 months!) The music sounds a bit like baby nursery music. I do understand that it's to keep us relaxed and in keeping with the theme, but it's border-line sleep inducing.
I might start turning the volume down and playing my own yoga mix to keep myself engaged.

I would also say it has helped me sleep through the night since the stretching and resistance has strengthened my back and has eliminated leg cramps. Like I said, I have no prior yoga experience so maybe someone who is into it would have a different opinion but I think it has been great. I also appreciate that the poses are modified depending on what trimester you are in. I would definitely recommend.",1296518400,,570,4.438095238095238
1355243,5,B00004U8H5,"I recently tried all three of these prenatal yoga dvds and they each have some good qualities.  I am 6 months pregnant and started yoga 4 months ago, so I am a beginner.  Here is my rank order:

1.  Shiva Rea Prenatal Yoga
2.  Prenatal & Postnatal Yoga with Elena Brower
3.  Yoga for your pregnancy with Kristen Eykel

I like Shiva the best!
- 3 women on the dvd showing modifications for each pose, based on your trimester
- great pace & poses for beginners
- easy to follow and plenty of time to move from pose to pose
- shows how to use a chair, blanket, strap, & blocks for comfort
- has plenty of relaxing time at the end
- easy comfortable tone throughout

Elena does not have any other women on the dvd with her, so she does not offer any modifications.  Her poses are a little more advanced for a beginner.  She does offer a great pace and relaxing feel.  Lots of leg work.

While Kristen does have 2 other women on the dvd with her she talks too much for my liking.  It was hard for me to focus on my breath with her talking all the time.  She also offers much more advanced poses and moves too quick for a beginner like me.  I would only recommend this for someone who is more advanced.",1295481600,,1196,4.116883116883117

This DVD has just enough of explinations not but so much that after you have watched it a few times it get annoying. I have another penatal yoga DVD that I can't stand to watch because there is too much instruction over and over again. This DVD is great for beginners or the more experienced person.

There are several different options for each position depending on how far along you are, which is great to be able to pick-and-choose.  I really like that each move flows right into the next. I've tried other prenatal yoga videos and each position is completely different requiring you to pause the DVD between each position to re-arrange everything (very annoying).

The yoga is not too challenging for a novice, but it is intended as one long session that many people may not have time or energy to do.  I would have preferred 15 or 30 minute sequences.  However, you can create your own shorter program by skipping through the DVD menu.  I prefer following along with yoga done in a beautiful outdoor setting, where you can imagine yourself there along with them.  Unfortunately this DVD is just set in a boring empty room, with women wearing ridiculous tele-tubby like bodysuits.  I also found Shiva Rea's accent a bit annoying--if you have any experience with the Los Angeles area, you may find she reminds you of a few Valley Girls you have known.  In the end, that was just too much for me, so I stopped using the DVD.  I switched to Anna Getty's ""divine mother"" DVD, which I much prefer, despite the cheesy title.",1291334400,,953,4.5

I like that there are several modifications demonstrated.

There are some great squat exercises (very important for muscles you'll use during labor) and lots of focus on opening up your chest and diaphragm to give growing baby room to stretch and breathe. No position is too uncomfortable or awkward. Shiva is careful to recommend that each woman follow the moves according to their trimester, but I am in the third trimester and find that the corresponding woman on the DVD sits in a chair for too much of the video, while I find the modified-for-second-trimester poses totally manageable.

That way, you can see how the poses should look, and can be modified depending on how big you are. It's very relaxing and easy - the workout is about 50 minutes long.

Now that I've done this workout, I'm going to do it every day. It was amazing. I loved that there is a model for each trimester. I just followed the woman in her third. But there is one doing modifications for 2nd trimester, and first.

As an athlete who worked out a lot before pregnancy, I never expected being as exhausted and sore as I am. But carrying twins, I have felt like I've run a marathon before I've even started my day. This DVD is for those woman who need good stretching, breathing, and relaxation. Don't expect to get cardio. But at this point in my pregnancy, I can only handle the bear minimum. This DVD was fantastic. With the modifications for each trimester, you can make it as easy or hard as you like.

I have recently ordered two other DVD's, and I'm hoping they compliment this one. But if I did this each day the rest of the trimester, I wouldn't mind that either.

I purchased this video at the recommendation of my friend who is an aerobics and pilates instructor.  I am so happy with this video!

I am 25 weeks pregnant and have been suffering with terrible hip and low back pain for a few weeks now.  Also I shoudl mention that this is my first pregnancy and prior to this video I had some limited yoga experience.

This video is excellent for women of all skill levels and at all points throughout pregnancy!  The video is setup so that you can follow a woman who is newly pregnant, a woman in her 2nd trimester, or a woman in her 3rd trimester.  This makes it very easy to follow along in a way that you know is safe and well-accomodated.

I have used this video every day for one week and am simply amazed at the increased mobility that I already have experienced.  The workout is not strenuous, but rather relaxing.  It is long... about 50 minutes in total.  But, believe when I tell you that it is well worth it!  In fact, my baby girl seems to love when I do this routine.  She seems more active and I believe it is because the routine is opening my ribs and making more room for my baby girl.

It's just... easy.  I'm sure this is fine for ladies coming to yoga for their first time, but as someone who's pretty active, this practice just didn't challenge me at all.  I also found the inward-looking sappy new age stuff got old fast.  The one strong point, though, was that it does demonstrate three separate ways to do the poses, so less flexible people could look at the 3rd trimester version for help.  But I'm in my 3rd tri and had no trouble doing almost all of it with the 1st trimester version.  It's just that easy.

First, I did Suzanne Bowen's Long and Lean Prenatal Workout = FANTASTIC! Such a great all-body workout, got my heartrate up a little, felt a good burn all over.

I'd heard great things about Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga, so I was looking forward to that this morning. I was completely underwhelmed.

The video is relatively short as well. But the exercises leave me feeling invigorating and I love that you can choose a person to watch based on what trimester you are in.

Here is my comparison:

Shiva Rae Prenatal Yoga: I like that it has 3 women, one for each trimester but I honestly can't imagine ever needing to modify as much as the third trimester woman does (she uses a chair in some cases) I use this DVD on days when I want a VERY gentle practice which is not that often.

Complete Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga by Jennifer Wolfe: I have found that I use this DVD almost every day since it also has 3 models, one for each trimester and it has 15, 30, 45 and 75 minute routines plus labor poses and a partner section (which my partner actually does with me!). I love this DVD. The best part is that Jennifer is a doula and childbirth professional so I feel really safe while maintaining my strength and flexibility. This is like a regular vinyasa class, just modified for pregnancy.",1268611200,2,1087,5.313953488372093
1355275,5,B00004U8H5,"I just completed my first trimester and started looking around for prenatal classes. My gym yoga instructor asked me to join the gentle yoga class since its the same as prenatal. However when I attended I was constantly fearing that I was the only pregnant woman there and some moves I did were no-no for pregnant women. Another place I called charged 15$/class. Thats when I decided to buy the CD and practice yoga at home. The CD is broken down into 4 sections - breathing/warm up, standing,sitting and relxation all for 50 mins. Right now I have decided to start with warm up and end with relaxation and switch between standing and sitting on alternate days. I like how the Cd has 3 instructors- one in each trimester and how they modify the poses accordingly. The music is relaxing and so is the way the instructor talks. A few places I have noticed the instructions are quick, and you need to watch the screen but I think once you get used to it you will not have to look at your TV.",1267660800,,988,4.404371584699454
1355276,5,B00004U8H5,"I have never done yoga before, but wanted to give it a try since my workouts were a bit more limited with my pregnancy, mainly due to lack of energy. The stretching and breathing were both stress relievers that instantly gave me more energy and I felt great afterwards. The video itself was easy to follow, I never felt that I had to ""catch up."" There are also different sessions that you can pick. Just doing two made a difference for me.",1267660800,,439,4.365853658536586
1355277,4,B00004U8H5,"This is not my favorite pregnancy workout, however it is the perfect pregnancy all yoga, simple and easy workout DVD. This is because as long as you are really in to working the stretches it is a great middle ground. It isn't hard and it isn't easy. It is safe. The con is that it isn't very challenging, and it is slow paced. There isn't a single move that ANY pregnant woman can't do but it isn't to easy, it is a long video and a lot of movements. It might be right for you. Especially if you are new to yoga, new to working out, later in your pregnancy, or having a difficult time in your pregnancy. It is great also if you can't sleep, it will really help you relax. I use it the day after a harder workout video, to rejuvenate my body, I also use it when I have taken to many days off to get my body prepared for a harder workout the next day. I also know from experience that at the very end of my pregnancy this will be my only workout video, it is very gentle.

I don't have that much time in the morning before I go to work, but I love Yoga and a nice thorough but short workout. This was thorough but really long. It is broken into segments but it is all part of the workout. With my other dvd I can get a total body Yoga workout in half the time and feel energized for the day. If you have the time, it is a good workout, but I just don't. I did like that they had the three different people to represent each trimester of the pregnancy, but I found that I most poses were fine when I followed the first trimester lady even though I am third trimester (only 5 1/2 weeks to go). I had a couple that I did with the second trimester lady but the third trimester person was more for people who have lost a lot of flexibility  or never had a lot to start with.

1355281,3,B00004U8H5,"This workout goes through a basic, traditional set of poses you will find familiar if you've taken yoga classes before.  I think the  best segment is that on Kegel exercises.  We are instructed exactly what to do and how it should feel, in a guided series, as opposed to other videos where the host just tells you it's time to do kegels and sets you loose.  I also like this video's host, which is a must for me to get into a workout.  She has a peaceful voice and gives clear instructions, gives a positive mood without joking around and getting corny like some of the others I've used.  My least favorite part of this video is all of the modifications.  Though I am far from a hardcore yogini and honestly not in great shape, I have some yoga experience and enough body confidence that I would prefer to just do a lot of the poses like I normally would, except leaving room for baby in them.  You will not be able to comfortably complete this workout without a chair at least, along with props like bricks, straps, blankets if you want to fully imitate what you see.

I was very disappointed, however.  2 main reasons: 1) Not enough time is spent/focused on breathing (one of the main tenets of yoga); I definitely thought she moved through the poses too fast and 2) In a related vein, the DVD was narrated in ""voice-over"" format so the instructions were not coordinated well with the poses.  If you engage in other types of more intensive physical activity and want a less intense ""workout"" during pregnancy, this DVD may be for you.  If you are someone who regularly (and mostly) practices yoga as your main form of physical activity, however, you may be disappointed.",1265414400,,793,4.642857142857143

  But honestly, I find the whole DVD a little silly. First of all, she sounds stoned in the intro section (which gives my husband a good laugh, as well as the extended (no pun intended) kegel strengthening section). The other yogis are dressed in brightly colored unitards and I keep getting distracted by how much Poppy (third trimester) resembles Winnie-the-Pooh. (And whose idea was it to put a second trimester woman in a grape colored body suit?)
  There's just not enough here to keep anyone other than a very beginner interested or inspired. However it feels safe and fairly relaxing so it might be something you use as a back up (or to keep those uterine walls strong strong strong)!",1261267200,,915,4.7

I have been practicing yoga for a few years and consider myself to be 'intermediate' in skill, knowledge, etc. I like that this video has an actual person in each trimester working out along with Shiva so you know who to follow for modifications. It is a nice, relaxing practice; however not challenging at all if you are already familiar with yoga. That being said, it is very relaxing and provides a nice full body stretch. It is divided into sections, with the entire video lasting just under an hour.

As I got further along in my pregnancy I began searching for prenatal workout videos.  After reading reviews on Amazon I purchased this DVD.  I found it to be almost too easy in my first and second trimesters.  Now that I am in my third trimester and my belly is larger I am enjoying the pace of the video more.  It is very slow.  Even though I am in my third trimester I still follow the second trimester adaptions.  The third trimester adaptions seem too easy.  I also wish the video was a tad bit shorter.  It is almost an hour long and I perfer 30minute workouts.  Since it is broken up in different sections you can do just certain parts of the workout. Easy workout that I think will be great for beginners or those who want a slow paced yoga workout, not for those who want a challenging workout video that will make you sweat.",1260057600,,936,4.297142857142857

I much prefer Jennifer Wolfe's Prenatal Vinyasa (though I would not recommend it to a beginner; it's clearly for women who already have familiarity with yoga). In sum, it just doesn't do it for me.

1355290,5,B00004U8H5,"Hello Friends. Here is a comparison of 2 great videos: ""Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga"" and ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" with Karyne Steben.

""Prenatal Yoga"": Soothing, gentle stretches. Shiva Rea's voice is gentle and relaxing. A wonderful time to focus on the baby inside you as you breath, stretch and become aware of your body. Not physically demanding (good for days when pregnancy hormones have a person feeling crummy and tired). Has modifications for all 3 trimesters. I feel relaxed physically and emotionally after doing stretches.

""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"": A good workout for arms, legs and torso. It's a relief to know I am doing exercises that are safe for a low-risk pregnancy. I would guess the beginner's level on this video is more like an intermediate aerobics videos. After 3 months of inactive nausea, I use the pause button for breathers. There is also an advanced modification shown for a more intense workout. I just love how Karyne is sporting a beautiful, bare, pregnant tummy. Seeing a kick-ass fit pregnant woman who obviously is comfortable with her full-rounded tummy is inspiring. No frills on sets or music, this is all about the exercise.

Thanks to everyone for your helpful comments on Amazon. I always check what you say before I pull out the credit card. Here's to a wonderful pregnancy!

As someone who is quite fit, slim, and petite in regular life, but whose body seems to want to gain 70 plus pounds while pregnant, this was the perfect dvd for me for all trimesters of my pregnancies.  I had many joint problems, fluid retention, and contraction problems during my pregnancies but this dvd helped me feel comfortable and good in my body for at least a few hours after the routine.  I used some of the other pregnancy dvds mentioned in other reviews but honestly they were too much for my body by the third trimester (keep in mind, not pregnant I run and do elipitical 4x/week, do yoga 2-3x/week, and have a 20 bmi).  This was perfect for me.  i looked forward to this part of my day.  and I did not find her pronunciation of ""exhale"" annoying.",1254614400,,975,4.418994413407821

I bought this DVD when I was in my second trimester and thought it was fairly easy. I would get so relaxed that I almost wanted to fall asleep after the sessions; at times I found it boring because I was looking for a good workout.

I would recommend this DVD to women that are in their third trimester when everything starts to ache and you start to feel more pain. This video has helped me feel GREAT throughout my pregnancy! I use to get leg cramps, my back would ache, etc.etc. but with this video I feel great (considering I have a watermelon to carry 24/7.

As I attending childbirth classes (this is my first child) the instructor would mention that while in labor & delivery it is very important to stay relaxed and conscious at the same time. This video has helped me remain calm (so far; I have 4 more weeks to go). I think that is the purpose of this video, to help you through labor & delivery as well as help stretch and keep yourself in tune with your body and your little baby growing inside you.

This video is mainly stretches, breathing, and relaxation, which are all the things I was looking for. A lot of the negative reviews say this video is too easy, but I don't think it's meant to be hard. It's meant to relieve aches and get you ready for childbirth. The hardest part of the video is the part with a few squats and modified planks, but they're still not hard. I love it!

However, these poses were too easy, focused on gentle stretching, not heart rate raising at all. Without heart rate raising, it's hard to warm up. The stretches moved too quickly from one to the next, so just when I get into the stretch, it moves on. Also, I find in my third trimester, I still do the adaptations for 1st or 2nd trimester because I am not new to yoga, am open, and strong. Basically, this DVD brings peace to the mind, a little stretching, no exercise, good chest/side opening, and a feeling that after it's done I need to go back and stretch my hips and legs more deeply.

Before I got pregnant, I had dabbled in yoga, but mostly practiced Pilates.  By about halfway through my pregnancy, I was ready for something a little more relaxing and less strenous than my pregnancy Pilates DVD.  This was the perfect solution - it's so relaxing, and the music and Shiva Rea's voice are so soothing that I hardly noticed the time going by.  I would actually look forward to coming home after a long day at work and unwinding with this DVD.  I even used it for a few weeks after I came home from the hospital, because it was just what I needed to stretch my tired muscles and destress, and I wasn't ready to jump into my pre-pregnancy workout regime just yet.

The collection consists of three work outs and a relaxation section. Although Shiva Rea is not pregnant, all the models are pregnant and represent the three trimesters. The yoga moves are designed to accommodate your growing bodies need during the trimester. Do I feel that this helped with child birth...no, but it help through the uncomfortable portions of pregnancy, especially through the hot days of summer. Her focus is on staying healthy for the baby. There is never any reference doing yoga now to get back into pants latter. This should be how all prenatal exercises programs should be! Sadly, so many tell us how we should look based on the medias distorted representation of body image.  But I guess that it what sells. Do this work out for yourself! Continue to do Yoga after your pregnancy is over, because it will help your body recuperate. Do not go crazy with your postpartum weight loss, it is not good for you and not realistic. Yes, the starlets are losing tons of weight with in months but they trainers, nutritionist, and full time nannies helping them get red carpet ready. Is this realistic?

If you want a prenatal yoga video that is actually challenging but still completely safe, try Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga with Jennifer Wolfe.  She offers three workouts, 15, 30 and 45 minutes long.

1355315,4,B00004U8H5,"This was a very easy workout that is simple to follow especially since it offers three different women (at each of the stages of pregnancy) as models for all of the steps.

1355316,3,B00004U8H5,"I was annoyed for the fact that through the entire dvd when she tells you to exhale, she misses the ""H"", and says ""exale.""  If stuff like that bothers you, don't get this.",1245888000,,171,4.181818181818182
1355317,4,B00004U8H5,"I didn't have a regular yoga practice when I became pregnant so for me this DVD was fine. The moves are basic and easy to follow. As others have noted there are 3 women to watch, one for each trimester. I find that helpful to see what options there are for me as I progress in my pregnancy. It was also reassuring to know that the moves I had been doing because they just felt good were OK to be doing. It helped confirm that pregnant women are not overly fragile!

If you are a hard core yogi, this may be too basic and simple for you.

Shiva does have an annoying way of saying 'exhale', but I have gotten past it. What I think GAIAM, the producers of the DVD, could have done to make this better, is segment out Shivas intro. It is obnoxious to have any workout DVD that treats you as if it's always your first workout. I just end up hitting fast forward right away, then I get my mat and materials ready while it gets through that section.",1244764800,,943,4.119565217391305

1355319,4,B00004U8H5,"I started looking for a yoga DVD as something low-impact that would help me in preparing for birth and in easing some of the body aches and pains I was experiencing even in my first trimester.  I bought this video when I was about 14 weeks, and am at 19 weeks now.

This DVD does that.  I have had no back pain (upper or lower) since starting to do this video.  I don't even do it regularly, but do use the video about 2 - 3 times per week, and pair it with other exercise like walking.

I have no yoga experience, and didn't even really like yoga before when I tried it, but this is a great video for beginners.  The explanations of the poses are thorough and simple to follow.  I don't find myself getting bored, since there are three parts to the video (that I do): preparation, standing poses, and floor work.  I always feel better after doing this video.  I feel energized, my muscles and joints feel looser, and I am more relaxed.

I don't do the relaxation (the last) part of the video yet, but I might once I get closer to my due date.",1244160000,,1043,4.17

1355321,5,B00004U8H5,"I had never done Yoga prior to my pregnancy. In fact, it was safe to say I was extreamely out of shape..and I was scared to death. I thought that I was going to have a terrible birth because of my low exercise level. So, I bought this DVD early on and used it about 4-5 times a week. I loved it. It made me feel like I was doing something proactive, rather than just sitting around worrying. It also helped me from gaining a ton of baby-weight. In the end I gained 27 lbs, and I had a fantastic delivery. I credit it all to this DVD. I recommend it to all pregnant friends and family, and have lent it countless times. Also, I still use it, and my daughter is 3! :)",1243296000,,665,3.970149253731343
1355322,3,B00004U8H5,"There are a few things I did like about this DVD-the overall choreography choices, the music and the guided meditation at the end. Unfortunately, there are a few things which make this less than a perfect pre-natal yoga choice. One of the most critical items was the complete lack of explanation on the positions. I have done yoga for years so I knew what each pose should be, but with the number of side angle poses chosen in this DVD, a simple reminder to ""drop your shoulder away from your ear"" would not have been remiss here. The flow of each pose does not give the viewer much time to compare their body position to make sure everything is in proper alignment with the demonstration. This could lead to unnecessary soreness later. The next critical problem with this DVD had to do with timing. While Shiva narrates the change from one position to the next, half the time the demonstators did not move until the second or third step in. Then they did step one and two and the viewer would have to quickly adjust to get into the position, which throws off the proper flow needed. Also, when further instructions were given for particular poses, it did not occur until the position was moved to the other side of the body. So your left side would get the benefit of the correct position, and the right side would feel unbalanced.

 Also, some minor errors involved her instructing to ""stand with feet shoulder-width apart"" when the move (as demonstrated) calls for a wide-legged stance, beyond shoulder-width, for a forward bend. Additionally, she calls to return to ""Mountain Pose"" and instead, the feet are shoulder-width apart. Mountain Pose is correctly performed later. The Kegal exercises called for picturing a building with ""four storeys"" and then the exercises only go to the ""third floor,"" but this is just quibbling. Overall, if you are experienced and can get past these glitches (and the minor annoyance of her not pronouncing her ""h"" in ""exhale...believe me, repeated often enough and it can get to you), then you will probably enjoy the selection of moves. Otherwise, I have enjoyed ""Yoga for Pregnancy, Labor & Birth"" which helped me through delivery with my first child last year.",1243209600,3,2200,4.786842105263158
1355323,5,B00004U8H5,"I was only expecting updated poses during the different trimesters, but when I saw it included massage I was ecstatic! Great video!",1243209600,,131,5.0
1355324,5,B00004U8H5,"Shiva is the supreme God, Lord of Dance. He is one of the five primary forms of God. Shiva Rea's father named her in honor of Lord Shiva. She did not connect with this name until her teens when she started practicing yoga. She is now a world-renowned yoga teacher.

This video will benefit anyone wanting a well thought out yoga routine. There are three women representing the three stage of pregnancy. Follow Shiva if you are in your first stage, 0 to 4 months. Follow Britta if you are in your 2nd stage, 4 to 7 months. Follow Poppy if you are in your 3rd stage of pregnancy, 7months to the birth of your child.

For those that are new to yoga, I recommend following Poppy. The squat move is an example of a more strenuous move. With practice, slowly move up to where you feel more comfortable.

Shiva Rea says ""Your breath helps you connect with your baby. Standing poses provide strength, flexibility, balance and stamina. Squats help open up your pelvis and bring elasticity to your pelvic floor. Your well being affects your baby, dedicate yourself to helping bring your child to a healthy, peaceful environment.""

My only down side to this video is that at the intro, Shiva's voice is very relaxed almost to the point of feeling a little over done. A few may be set back by this but it really does pay off throughout to bring on relaxation.

Shiva herself is not talking during the filming of the yoga session; it is an overlay of her voice. This gives it a claming effect as she is simply moving fluidly.

The relaxation at the end of the session is reason enough to view this video. The soothing subliminal suggestions release all remaining tensions while allowing the flow of oxygen to saturate all areas newly unlocked from the previous asana's.

The massage part of the video brings your partner into the journey. There are some very helpful tips here.

This really is one of the best prenatal videos out there. You want the baby nestled safely inside the best home you can provide. Follow this and you are helping to make available the best environment to start the life of your child. You are increasing your blood flow and loosening your muscles, calming your internal environment, toning your body. Add this to your day along with a healthy external environment, nutritional food, and loving response to your world.",1242950400,,2331,4.627118644067797

First Shiva has the most annoying voice and she pronounces exhale as ex-sale. She isn't even really instructing the other two women, she has a voice over of herself running the ""class"". Her voice is off a lot of the time and her directions are terrible.

Second there is an introduction by Shiva and then 4 different sections - but you have to fast forward to get to them - so annoying when you are putting the dvd in 3 times a week.

Third I am an athlete, I played collegiate volleyball, and I have been training, lifting weights, and stretching for many years.... and this ""workout"" does nothing for me. I could just as easily do stretches that I would normally do before a typical workout or game and feel better than this.

The only good thing I can say is that putting in a dvd helps me to stay scheduled to doing the stretching I need - so I recommend you don't purchase this dvd - DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!

I feel more irritated when finished doing a section of this DVD then I did before I started. I am a nanny for two boys and I'm 6 months pregnant... the stresses of my day are more relaxing than Shiva... hint hint",1240790400,2,1327,4.188235294117647

Its very helpful that the video shows the ladies in all 3 trimesters with their specific pose modifications.

It also got on my nerves that she pronounced the word ""exhale"" as ""eck-ssale."" She says it over and over again and it made it hard to focus on what I was doing.

On the flip side, I don't rely on this DVD for my only activity for the day, as I prefer to actually feel more challenged. I pair this DVD with a trip to the gym or a long, brisk walk. I go to a prenatal yoga class 1-2 times a week that is more vigorous and doesn't treat me like I am fragile. So, if you exercised regularly before you got pregnant and have done at least a few yoga classes, this one may make you yawn, although I am not advising against it (like I said, it is beneficial, just not for getting you energized).

1355361,1,B00004U8H5,"i am a reasonably fit and healthy young woman in my early 20's, and was a regular at my local gym and cycling class for several months before i got pregnant. after i got pregnant and had to take a break from my routine because of horrible all-day-sickness and exhaustion i was looking for something gentle, but still somewhat challenging, to ease me back into a more regular routine again. i picked up this dvd because i thought prenatal yoga would be fun and relaxing. i have never really done yoga before and thought it would be a nice change of pace to learn something new. i am VERY DISAPPOINTED in this dvd...

the instructor has absolutely no personality, and her tone of voice is completely flat and unmotivated. her long-winded introduction that has to be watched before the workout, EVERY TIME, is more irritating every time i hear it, and the terrible voice-over instructions are not even timed correctly. some exercises don't even match up with her instructions! the music is slow, boring, and uninspiring. the poses are far too short, and only a few of them even make me feel like i am doing anything at all! there are too many variations of the ""triangle pose"", which i am REALLY sick of now; it feels like i just keep doing the same thing over and over again the whole time!

i'm not at all experienced with yoga, but this has got to be one of the most boring, ineffective workouts i've ever tried, and i have done the whole routine beginning to end about six times to be sure i wasn't doing something wrong! when it's over i just want to fold into ""child's pose"" and go to sleep! i'm looking for something more motivating and challenging! if anyone has any suggestions please let me know!",1229558400,,1703,4.525974025974026

Now its definately the right pace for me, and its a good allover workout.  I would say its a bit slow for first tri and early second tri, but its great for the second half of second tri and third tri.

As someone who has practiced yoga for 6 years I was looking for a dvd that would be challenging in terms of the poses but not a major ""vinyasa"" cardio workout.  I use this dvd in the morning before I go to work to stretch, relax and get rid of my morning sickness.  This dvd has 3 sections which make it easy to break up if you don't have the full 50 minutes.  It had some new poses I wasn't familiar with that made it fun and exciting.  It also focuses on many poses that can help you through labor and delivery.  You need a chair, strap, blanket and block (especially when you get into the 2nd and 3rd trimesters) but if you don't have these items you probably have something laying around the house that would work just as well.  This video is good for beginners, intermediate or advanced but don't order if you're looking for a faced-paced cardio workout.",1224806400,,891,4.299401197604791

I do like how the video smoothly shows you modified poses for various stages of pregnancy. Overall though, I think the workout is a bit too simple. Most poses are not repeated more than one time, so I don't feel the benefit that I normally do from a regular yoga class. I may start watching it with the remote close by so that I can pause and do each pose a couple extra times!",1224806400,,505,4.326315789473684

As I go through pregnancy, I am coming to find - everyday is not the same.  I choose this on a day when I want to move mindfully and more gently.  This is a good video to have in a collection and I use it frequently.

I love how there are actually pregnant women in the video to follow depending on your stage of pregnancy. The moves are slow and comfortable and there is no need for fancy equipment.

It is nice to have the three ladies on the DVD displaying modifications for each trimester.  You need a blanket, chair, block, and strap for different exercises and modifications.  There is no need to buy special items, you can just use things from around the house to make it work!  I like how Shiva stresses to not overdo any poses, only what is comfortable for you.  The first few times I watched/did the tape, I payed quite a bit of attention to the poses.  I would suggest after that to try not to watch the tape so closely and focus on your breathing, which has seemed to help me transition from pose to pose more smoothly.  I have minimal experience with yoga, am 28, first time mom,and an average weight/muscle tone...if that helps get a better idea of where I am coming from.  Also, I can't forget to mention the guided relaxation at the end...is AMAZING!  I wish it was a little bit longer, but it is a nice treat.

It helped so much for my lower back pain. I've had lower back pain for a few years, then was in an accident in 2006, then another one when I was about 8 weeks pregnant.

I would recommend C. Crawford's DVD for earlier times during pregnancy, or if you have previous yoga experience. There are a bit more challenging poses in that one such as the warrior pose. Towards the end of my pregnancy, I ended up using only the Shiva Rea's DVD, as she presents nice/light alternative versions (for second and third trimesters) in case you are not feeling you can do the regular versions of the poses. I did more Kegels and squatting than what is on the DVD.
I strongly recommend prenatal yoga for a healthier pregnancy and birth. It helps feel more relaxed and energized. It was very useful for me to have a pretty stress and problem-free pregnancy and get mentally ready for natural childbirth.",1215648000,,925,4.578313253012048

As a long-time yoga lover, I am pleased to see that the video gives subtle but important safety instruction, along with emphasizing the usefulness of isometrics during yoga. In general, though, it is super relaxing. Three fifteen minute exercise segments plus a guided relaxation section at the end make for a perfect after-work yoga session. For the last couple of hours at work every day, I look forward to coming home, getting out my mat, and settling into these relaxing (yet challenging) stretches. I can feel my breath capacity expanded after completing the workout.

When I started I was in my first trimester and I am already in my second and I can use the same video - just have to follow the modified poses. I would highly recommend this Yoga program to any expectant mother!,1205712000,,571,4.5

I feel like it's too gentle...and I'm not an avid athlete.  They make you use a chair a lot, which is a pain, and not really necessary if you have yoga blocks.  I asked my yoga instructor what she would recommend and she said Yoga for Pregnancy, Labor & Birth (2002) by Crawford, Colette.  I just ordered this, but hopefully it will be better.",1205107200,3,462,4.204545454545454

I do recommend it, if you want a second video.",1204848000,,283,3.9473684210526314
1355412,3,B00004U8H5,I only got to use this after my pregnancy was over because for some reason I forgot about using it prior.

Don't be fooled by the cover, however, I don't think Shiva Rea is pregnant in the dvd, if she is it's really early on, so her stretches are really deep and impossible for the pregnant woman to achieve.  If you follow the modified participants of the dvd you'll have a much better time with it, rather then, if you are like me, begrudgingly watching Shiva Rea bend and twist herself into a yogic pretzel.  All in all good and simple dvd to follow.",1203724800,,562,4.436893203883495

My few pieces of criticism are that the video is a bit slow.  I find myself getting bored with it.  I have been doing yoga for about 2 years and I almost feel like I could just write down the poses in the order she does them and then do my own workout at my own pace.  Also, the part on Kegel exercises would be very confusing if you did not know what they are because it looks like the women are just sitting there.  I also found that there was a lot of side-stretches, more than I felt I needed.",1202428800,,673,3.948148148148148

I really appreciate the 3 models who demonstrate each trimester.  Overall, I find this exercise DVD to be relaxing and beneficial to help my aching back.  Her kegel exercises are short but great, providing a more refined control of those kegels.

Shiva Rea's voice was so monotoned, I found myself looking up at the tv trying to figure out what she was talking about. While some of the positions were nice and I felt like I was stretching, I was too busy being annoyed by all the spiritual aspects of the narration. If you like that sort of thing, you'll probably like this video.

1355423,5,B00004U8H5,"I can't imagine a yoga video that's easier to do.  The DVD begins with an intro about the exercises, as well as a list of what you'll need an why (a chair, blanket, yoga strap, and block. Simple.) The techniques are split into three sections, each progressing in extension and stamina (I won't say dificulty, because it's really not).  Even after the second section, 30 minutes of yoga has been accomplished.  But trust me, that last section is well worth it.
I am currently 6.5 months pregnant, and have been doing this regularly (at least 2 times a week) since I was 2 months.  I can already see a difference in my breathing rhythm, squatting stamina, and pelvic floor strength.  Now, whether I'll be applying these techniques in the delivery room is up to me, but it's too natural and easy to accomplish for my body to not want to.
Also, I know it seems like a small thing, but all the women in the video (3 women, 3 different trimesters) are wearing full bodysuits like the one seen on the cover.  It's a detail, but it helps to put more focus on the exercises than on watching their bulging bellies.

The production is professional and the yoga itself is really helpful.  Throughout my pregnancy I have really felt the need to stretch out my muscles, legs especially.  Taking an hour to relax and stretch really feels good.  The DVD starts with a long spoken intro, but you can skip through it.  The rest of it is broken up into segments, so you can do 15, 30, or 45 minutes of yoga plus a cooldown.  I liked having the option of only doing a chunk of it at a time. Though I never did the full 3rd trimester variation, it was nice to see women at different stages adjusting the workout to their physical needs.  The whole session is very soothing and relaxing, yet helps build strength too.  I would recommend this DVD to any pregnant woman who likes a good stretch.",1201132800,,889,4.5125

Shiva Rea has a calming voice and explains each pose as well as creating modifications for each phase of pregnancy which is great for those of us who have never done yoga before! The poses assisted in the aches and pains that come with pregnancy and kept me limber.

Shiva Rea's voice is soothing and relaxing.  The video is calm and the movements flow into one another.  All you need is a chair (any chair will do) to support you and you're on your way to making your body a better place for your baby and for its birth.,1198886400,,417,4.036585365853658

I've been pregnant before so I was a little suspicious of what they'd have somebody in the third trimester try and pull off, but they've got a different woman doing the poses for each trimester and the third trimester woman was doing poses that I think were completely realistic.

1355432,5,B00004U8H5,"Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga class is an excellent choice for both experienced yoga students and novices. During my second trimester, my newly retired mother and I enjoyed the practice together every day. I have been doing yoga for a few years, and she had no experience but found the DVD to be excellent for her beginner status. Because of the three options for each pose that Shiva Rea offers, we both could find the right position for our bodies.
Besides being a bonding opportunity with my mother, this DVD has helped me keep toned and in shape throughout my pregnancy. I am now quickly approaching my due date, and I can still do each pose in one form or another. I think that the continued yoga practice will help me connect with my body and relax during labor and delivery, as it has kept me relaxed during my pregnancy. Shiva Rea has a calm voice and says the right things to get me adjusted and comfortable in each pose. I am going to order her Postnatal DVD to use after the baby is born. I highly recommend this DVD to any pregnant mother or a woman who is interested in doing yoga but has limited flexibility and would like to see several modifications for each pose (as long as she doesn't mind an occasional reference to babies).",1197331200,,1240,4.466960352422907

I just did Shiva Rae's video for the first time (I'm in Week 13).  I found it to be very comfortable, while effectively stretching and working my body.  She uses very few props (though you should have a bolster if you are doing any prenatal yoga past the first trimester.)  When she does recommend props, like a blanket or a block, they are constructive uses.  I feel like I could do this every day.

I will still use the other two videos, but they will be reserved for the days I feel particularly strong and ambitious.  (They are each full length sessions with out the program divisions that Shiva's routine offers.)",1197158400,,1210,6.419753086419753

I liked it because I could do the entire DVD as my only workout of the day (about 50 min), or just one of the three segments that the workout is broken into.  Even if I did just one segment, I could get a good whole-body stretch.  It was also a good reminder to do Kegel exercises every day.  Well worth the money.

But I wouldn't recommend that pregnant novices go into downward facing dog w/o any detailed instruction (as she does in this video). That doesn't seem safe. Also, the instructor moves too quickly from one pose to the next--seemingly forgetting that she's asking pregnant women, who can be slow and off-balance--to move quickly.

I am almost 7 months pregnant and find the breathing and stretching beneficial.  The DVD seems quite mellow, but I think that is because the women doing the yoga are not the ones speaking, there's a voice over.  I can see how others who have been doing yoga for years would find this DVD too slow and boring. For me, it's just what I need right now.  Having the 3 different women in different stages of pregnancy is helpful.  I also like that it's broken into 15 minute segments so you can do what you have time for or what you are in the mood for.

She told me that she is really pleased with the program, because it demonstrates every position with a woman from each trimester - modifying the exercises appropriately to accomodate a growing baby belly. It has helped relieve some of my friend's back aches and body tension as well as providing her with the opportunity to ""do something"" (her words). However, my friend did say that it took her a couple of sessions before she could do the whole video, but believes that was natural due to the increased tiredness that comes from being pregnant.",1194134400,,710,4.642857142857143

I've taken a couple of yoga classes (but am still very much a beginner), and this video neither got my blood flowing nor really stretched me even close to the level of an actual class.

The video has three models for you to follow:  Shiva, who is in her first trimester and doesn't look pregnant at all; a woman in her second trimester who uses bricks to do the positions (I don't have bricks, but even going all the way down to the floor during my 2nd trimester didn't really do anything for me); and a woman in her third trimester who basically stands around and raises her arms occasionally.

1355447,5,B00004U8H5,"I'm in my second tri and I have really enjoyed this dvd. Yesterday I came home from work stressed. After resting a bit, I did the full program. It is very relaxing. It is always great for a mom to work on her breathing for baby's sake. And flexibility and strength is an important asset during labor. This dvd has a lot of side stretching, which is good to keep loose as mom's mid-section gets crowded. The warm up section is almost more relaxing than the ending meditation, because the end is quite short. However, I guess they expect for to lay there as long as you like.

I don't consider this to be the be-all-end-all of exercise for pregnant women, because there is no cardio in this kind of workout. I mix it up: Sometimes I'll do part of Body By Jake Total Body Workout, then do one section of the Shiva Rea's yoga. Or I'll go to the park and come back and do yoga. This is a great dvd to put in the mix. For a harder yoga workout, I recommend Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga. It is challenging!",1192838400,,992,4.221052631578948

1355449,5,B00004U8H5,"I am currently seven and a half months pregnant, and I had been using a different prenantal yoga DVD (The New Method) until just a few weeks ago. I felt frustrated with the New Method DVD because I could tell how much flexibility I was losing, and it was NOTHING like the yoga classes I had taken every week for the past couple of years, but it was free, fun, and fit in well with my cardio and strength routine, so I just went with it.

I decided to purchase Prental Yoga with Shiva Rea, and based on previous reviews, I was skeptical that it would be challenging enough for me. But I LOVE it! It's the same sort of hatha-oriented poses I am accustomed to. Most importantly for me, it requires you to ""hold the pose"" as opposed to doing vinyasa or ashtanga-style ""flows"" like with The New Method. For me personally, holding a stretch for a good long time and really breathing through it is the only way to really increase/maintain my flexibility.

Shiva's voice is soothing (although some of her pronunciation can be a little distracting), the modifications are mostly appropriate (I still do some poses the second trimester way even though I'm in my third trimester now), and I feel GREAT when it's over. I highly recommend this for other pregnant yogis who like to ""hold the pose!""",1192406400,,1284,4.530172413793103
1355450,2,B00004U8H5,"Although this DVD contains modifications of the poses for each trimester, the modification for the third trimester basically involved sitting in a chair.  I found many of the poses did not feel appropriate for a prenatal program, and did not feel any benefit from the program.  I think that the program would be too easy in your first and second trimesters in addition to being almost useless in the third.  It's also inconvenient to have to have a chair available for the program.  The guided meditation at the end is too short.  I strongly recommend the Divine Mother prenatal DVD instead of this one.",1191888000,,603,4.759615384615385

I have always had trouble with yoga breathing, which worries me for the whole labor process, and this has been helping me immensely.  It also gets rid of my lower back pain, and helps me work out soreness in my hips and pelvic area.  THis is so useful after a day in an office chair.  The guided relaxation is also really fantastic - I might actually record her voice and bring it with me to use inbetween contractions during labor!!!  It really helps to release my tension. This isn't a really high intensity workout - you aren't going to break a sweat or anything, but it does improve your sense of well being and posture, as well as starting to prepare you for birthing.  It would make most sense to alternate this with some more cardio based activity like walking, and some toning exercises.

It does just what I desired- a form of exercise in which I could stretch and feel rejuvinated, while not overworking my body or risk elevating my heart rate too high. It's very calming, but at the same time it also works many muscles that will be useful for childbirth.

A couple silly things you may want to be prepared for:
- The person on the cover is not pregnant, she is just made to look pregnant. In my opinion, it would have much better if they had a real pregnant woman on the cover because you kind of feel fooled.  Although, it does not detract from the quality of the workout.
- You need to find out what Kegel exercises are on your own.  They're great for pregnancy and they are in the workout but they are not explained.  If you don't know what they are you will get lost at that point in the workout.  Just google ""Kegel exercises"" and you should find a good description.

Possibly because she already had been doing yoga for a while, and was comfortable doing it on her own without the walkthrough-  so this may be a nice DVD for beginners.

The instructor plus 2 students, each in a different trimester, show 3 ways of doing each 'asana' or yoga pose. Do the poses gently, especially in your 2nd and 3rd trimester, and with practice they will be become easier and more fluid.

I especially liked the stretching moves. The backache and stiff joints of pregnancy are greatly eased by these. I am in my 5th month and have done the DVD once and loved it. I don't have the yoga block and strap that they recommend so I didn't stretch as far as I could have. But even without these, I had no trouble following the instructor.

I don't work out a ton, but I do find the video very easy and much easier than the prenatal yoga classes I've taken.

Shiva Rea is a great yoga instructor anyway, but she's been pregnant (says in her interview she gained 50 pounds while pregnant), and she is dead on with these poses.  She knows exactly what you need to stretch and strengthen, so there are lots of poses that help loosen up your back, hips, and pelivs, strengthen your pelvic floor (squats and kegels), and get all those tired, achy muscles.

The workout is in three segments plus a cooldown that is the pregnant lady's equivalent for savasana (corpse pose), and is very relaxing.  Each segment is about 15 minutes, so I find it easy to do one, two, or all three, depending on how much time/energy I have.  I love that!

She has two other exercisers with her, so there is someone demonstrating poses for each trimester (and they are definitely in their 2nd and 3rd trimester!), and the modifications allow you to get the benefit of the pose without overdoing it.  The music and instruction are soothing and peaceful.

Sometimes I do this as my main workout, other times this is my ""before bed"" stretch-out session.  My whole body feels better after I do this workout, like I've had a massage.  In fact, I do part of this workout before getting a massage, and the massage is more effective.

I feel this workout, along with regular chiropractic adjustments, has eliminated the headaches and back problems I was experiencing, and I certainly feel a lot better in general than my pregnant friends who are not using it.

The best part of this video for me is that I can feel stretched, toned, and energized without needing to take a shower afterwards. I would recommend for anyone new to yoga.

1355510,4,B00004U8H5,"I feel confident that this is a safe product for pregnant women.  The prenatal yoga program is long enough to get a good workout, however, if you're not feeling up to the whole program it is divided into three sections for your convenience.  I personally love doing the whole workout from start to finish. I feel relaxed and satisfied at the end.  The program is paced well and easy to follow.  The quality is great.  The setting is nice, the lighting is beautiful, and the camera work is slow and steady.  You always see what is going on.  There are no fancy camera tricks to take away from what the viewer needs to see.  Last but not least, there are three different women on screen at all times.  Each is demonstrating the appropriate move for each trimester.  This is exactly what I needed to know; how to modify a move to make it appropriate for each stage of pregnancy.  I think this program is very appropriate for many levels.  I think a beginner would find this program especially helpful and insightful.",1172966400,,1013,4.535911602209945
1355511,5,B00004U8H5,I started developing bad back pain at week 25. I practiced this routine every other day until I delivered. My back pain was significantly reduced by week 30 and stayed under control for the remainder of my pregnancy.,1172102400,6,216,4.7105263157894735

This video provides a challenge even in pregnancy, which I like, and makes me feel great afterwards. It is also aesthetically pleasing as they are in a nice atmoshphere with candles and soft music. You need several items for the session, such as a blanket, chair, band for stretches, yoga ball, and block but you can improvise with nearby items although I would suggest purchasing a yoga ball for some of the stretches as a pillow just doesn't do the trick for me.",1171929600,2,817,4.641379310344828

This video delivers the realxation and stretching, but did not offer a challenge.  Although it shows women in various stages of pregnancy, I feel that it is better suited for someone further along with limited mobility.

If you are looking for a challenge, I recommend purchasing one of Gaiam's regular yoga DVD's and modifying to suite your prenatal needs.",1171843200,2,515,4.885057471264368
1355515,4,B00004U8H5,"This DVD provides good poses for pregnant women in any trimester. It gets a little boring though, because of the redundant side angle stretches. In any case, I like it because the exercises are not too strenuous, it helps alleviate joint and back pains, and it relaxes you enough to help you sleep.",1171584000,,298,4.6415094339622645
1355516,2,B00004U8H5,"I was very disappointed in this video. I exercise for enjoyment, whether doing yoga or aerobics or dance or anything else - I expect to finish with a feeling of having loosened my body, or of having energized myself, or of having built strength (depending on the type of workout). I'm now 21 weeks pregnant, and I bought this video to just stretch me out on days when I don't want to sweat (I wasn't expecting anything intense). But only my legs got a good stretch throughout this video - my back didn't lose any tension. And from my experience, back tension is the most painful aspect of pregnancy. I was also incredibly bored and annoyed throughout, for these reasons: 1. I prefer cueing that instructs you so that you're performing a mirror image of the instructor (so when the instructor is facing the screen, you're mirroring her movements). This was the opposite - you're doing the same side as the instructor at the same time, so it's harder to correct your posture. 2. The cueing was always several seconds in advance of the instructor's movements, so if you look up to the screen during the cue, there's a lag: she won't make a move until the cue is basically over. 3. It's very, very slow. I lost interest very quickly and was barely able to get through the whole video. In short, I only recommend this if you just want a very, very light stretching workout and don't mind if it takes you 45 minutes to do that, or if you're very out of shape. Otherwise, If you're looking for a really nice feeling of tension relief, relaxation, and looseness after exercise, try the Perfect Pregnancy Workout. Even FitMama's 20 min yoga part does the trick better.",1171411200,,1659,4.570469798657718

While I enjoy this DVD, I think that the Perfect Pregnancy Workout and Pilates for Pregnancy are better.  I am a huge yoga and pilates fan and I just thought this could have been done better (and shorter - critical when you have children at home and it is hard to find time to sneak in a workout).  However I am recommending it because I think that I will use it more in my last trimester and it is an effective (if lengthy) workout; it really helps with achiness that you sometimes get in pregnancy as well.",1170720000,,649,4.168

1355523,4,B00004U8H5,"I am very happy with this exercise video. Admittedly, it doesn't leave you sweating, but if you are looking for something like that, yoga is probably not the way to go, anyway. This is my second pregnancy in a very short time (my children will be born less than 20 months apart) and I am experiencing the discomforts of too closely spaced pregnancies - sore joints, fatigue, back aches etc. - and this exercise video helps relieve pain even when I'm positively suffering before I begin. I have never experienced any strain in my joints while doing the exercises. I was in pretty good shape when I got pregnant but as I said earlier, had only just recovered from my last pregnancy, and even though I'm 26 weeks pregnant, I'm still mostly following Shiva (1st trimester) and not modifying my poses a lot. Therefore, I assume that almost anyone can do the exercises by modifying the poses according to capacity.

There are really only two things I can criticize. One is that sometimes I don't think Shiva Rea gives the viewer quite enough time to really deepen the poses. I don't know enough about yoga to know if that might have something to do with the type of yoga she is doing or if she just doesn't think it's necessary. The other thing I sometimes find mildly irritating is the way she always leaves out the H in 'exhale' => 'exale'. Very trivial, I know, but if such things do bother you, be warned!",1168905600,3,1403,4.5236220472440944

I really appreciate her modifications for each trimester, and having used this dvd in my 1st and second tri, think the modifications are good.  I also like that the video is broken up into floor poses, standing poses, etc., so i can squeeze in some yoga when i can, essential for the mom of a 3 year old.  She goes a little slow at times for a time pressed mom, but thank god for the fast forward button!  Highly recommend this.",1168300800,,654,4.425

In my last pregnancy, I borrowed some prenatal yoga books from the library and could not bring myself to go through more than a few chapters because of the new age commentary, but Shiva is not annoying in that way.

There is dedicated time for kiegle excercises, which is nice.  They do suggest equipment like a yoga block, yoga mat, band, and a chair, but those (I think) can be improvised at home without much problem if you are not interested in buying lots of equipment you might not use later.

1355535,4,B00004U8H5,"This DVD is all about the mother, the baby inside you, and being gentle on your body (it hurts enough as it is!). I like the fact that Shiva has been pregnant and therefore understands what pregnant women can and can not do (or should not do). The full workout is about 90 minutes long, including relaxation. The three examples of the different trimesters with modified poses are wonderful. Sometimes I find myself following different models according to my capability. You really get a sense of caring and well-being for yourself and your baby with this DVD. I wake up feeling a huge decrease in the level of pain I feel in the morning.

The only negative things I'd say about it is that I wish she was more creative in the different stretches and poses. The types of stretches are redundant even though you're doing them in different places: standing, on a chair, or on the floor. I also wish she did more of a lead-in to the relaxation portion instead of jumping right in. Also, if you're looking for a more intense workout, this wouldn't be a good choice.

Also, I appreciate how she tells us the benefits (to women, to the baby, and to aid with pregnancy and labor) of each posture. My only ""complaint"" is that the women don't do the ""mirror image"" of the postures, so if you are new to yoga it might be difficult to follow some of them (especially the twists) at first. The other thing to be aware of is that she uses props (a block, a strap, a blanket and a chair). I have all these, but someone new to yoga should be aware that they'll need these pieces.

It goes in 'real time', so you can just put in the DVD and exercise as if you were in a class (I hate the DVDs that talk for a long time before each pose/exercise .. it's good the first time or two, but then once you learn the basics it's too slow).

Poppy, the woman in her third trimester, sits on a chair, barely moving, throughout most of the ""workout.""  On a positive note, the unintentional humor factor is quite high.  I prefer a workout that I can practice safely yet feel afterwards.  I found both ""Pilates during Pregnancy"" and the ""Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" challenging, wonderful and much more effective.",1146614400,36,751,5.3760683760683765

This DVD is great because it gives examples for each trimester as to how to modify certain poses/stretches.  And if you are into yoga and pregnant, this DVD is a must have.  But, pregnant or not, yoga still bores me.  I still try to do the DVD at least once a week though.  One of many sacrifices I expect I'll make for this baby!",1142553600,,566,4.242990654205608
1355563,4,B00004U8H5,"I chose this DVD because of other reviews which wrote that it moves more quickly through the yoga poses than some other prenatal videos.  Having done yoga off and on for a few years before becoming pregnant, I was happy to find a video that uses the normal naming conventions and structure.  It requires me to look at the video less so I can focus on my movements and breathing.

If you aren't well versed in yoga before buying this video, you should be able to come up to speed after following it a few times.  Shiva Rea does not do elaborate or confusing moves.  One thing I like about this film is that it continuously focuses on the three women, including the instructor, so you know how you are to be holding a stance.  While I understand that different women look different while doing yoga, I also think that there are wrong ways of doing things that could potentially be harmful.  Other videos that focus too much on the participants make me wonder what I should be doing.

I must admit that I wish the video was slightly more challenging.  I'm in my 32nd week and I can do most of the stretches with Shiva Rea (first trimester).  I still really like the video, but I mention this because I find it more of a relaxing/stretch video than a challenging, feel-it-the-next-day stretch.  Perhaps I also wish that the video was longer than an hour, but I feel that way about most of them.

I prefer this video to a few others I've seen, which are overly spiritual for me.  This does focus on breathing and being in the moment with your baby, but it's not too ""far out"".",1141948800,10,1571,4.3944636678200695
1355564,5,B00004U8H5,"I used this video during the early part of my last pregnancy (I went on bedrest at 20 weeks so I couldn't do yoga beyond that) and I found it very easy to follow. The exercises are simple and the directions are clear, and you can see what each of the models is doing with each pose and there are explanations and close ups of the modifications for the second and third trimesters. There are three models to follow one for each stage of pregnancy and even if you are not that far along you can modify your poses according to the other models if it is more comfortable for you. I do not practice yoga on a regular basis and the only other time I have done any kind of yoga was during a previous pregnancy. Best of all I felt energized and relaxed after doing the exercise routine in this video.

Shiva Rea has a soothing calming voice and the music and background are very unobtrusive. I liked this video so much I am planning to get her postnatal yoga video now that I've given birth.

I also want to respond to a previous reviewer and let others know that the intro can be skipped by pressing the skip forward button on your remote control because it is a little long to watch each and every time.

However, I have been very plesantly surprised. I cannot believe what a difference it makes in how I feel. I do the program usually three times a week and I absolutely feel more relaxed (and sleep better) afterwards.

I really like how there are women in each trimester so that you can modify the program as you progress through pregnancy. I skip the guided relaxation at the end, but I can see how it would be helpful for some women.",1141516800,3,607,4.278260869565218

1355567,4,B00004U8H5,"I had a relatively easy delivery and recovery for a first timer and got back into prepregnancy form easily, which two doctors credited to regular exercise before, during and after pregnancy. I used this DVD regularly, as well as Karyne Steben's ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" (strength building and more challenging). I also continued to lift weights into my 7th month and walked about 3 times a week up to the 40 week mark.
This workout provides both the relaxation and strength building benefits of yoga (I especially feel the results of the squats in my legs). It also helped me relieve tension and pain in my lower back. Women from each trimester demonstrate modifications of the workout, which is broken up into meditation and pranayama, standing poses, floor work, and guided relaxation. I enjoyed the soothing music and Shiva Rea's calming tone. I also own Crunch's Yoga Mama, which is also relaxing and relieves back pain but does not leave me feeling I actually exercised. After this workout, I can tell I have worked my body.
Once I found out I was expecting number 2, I couldn't wait to start this workout once again. From my experience - exercising is one of the most important things I can do for baby's health, my health, and my own peace of mind. I highly recommend this DVD!

I have had a friend complain that the video is boring; however, this friend never did yoga before, so I don't know if she understand some of the movements.  I can do this workout any day regardless of how I feel.  A lot of the stretches and movements really get my kinks out too (especially since I already have trouble sleeping).

1355573,3,B00004U8H5,"My sister gave me a GAIAM Prenatal Yoga with Sheva Rea video (I would rather have it on dvd.. but the video is nice too). I liked it, but I still think that Rocki's Prenatal Yoga is more my style.

This video has three women doing it (with Sheva doing a voice over for all). Sheva does the first trimester variations, and one women does second trimester, and the other does third trimester. It uses a chair, block, a strap, and a blanket (and your mat).

There are three sections, each about 20 minutes each. You could do them separately if you wanted to.

The workout starts with a Warm-up. I found it to be a bit too fast in some poses, it didn't really let me get into something before moving onto the next thing. This is a recurring problem throughout the workout, I thought. But, it was a good warm-up.

Next came Standing work. Again, I just think that Rocki tends to get it more. I feel like I am getting a better workout with her. BUT - some of the poses are different and good in that way. I did find that some of the ""variations"" specified for the second trimester were too easy for me, so I did them unmodified. And I am almost in my third trimester! The third trimester variations seemed really easy. I don't know how much my flexibility etc will change in another few weeks, but I don't see it diminishing THAT much. Maybe when I am nearer to the end...

The Floor Work was also good, but again, not as good as Rocki. Shiva skips doing a real downward dog, and instead uses a chair. I don't know, but the downward dog I do with Rocki's routine feels sooooo good. I missed it. And the way that Shiva modifies child's pose made it feel not as good, either.

There is also a short meditation at the end. A bit too short. I don't really normally DO the meditation bits, but I think anyone who did would find this too short.

Shiva also only does a really short bit of kegels, whereas Rocki does them throughout the workout.

SO - I guess what I am saying is that I will just stick with Rocki, unless somehow I get seriously bored with her, although maybe doing one of the sections on this video might be nice if I am short on time and still want to do some yoga.",1138492800,4,2171,4.201923076923077

In my 8th month, i'm finding it is about all I can do and I appreciate the modifications.

I left my first version of this DVD somewhere a few weeks ago and cannot wait for the replacement I ordered to arrive!

I like this video b/c: 1) it isn't too slow, 2) I don't feel like a whale performing the poses, 3) of the flexibility of the 3 seperate sections, and 4) it has wonderful stretching and standing poses.

Another reviewer said it is not a ""workout"" ... I would agree that it's not an aerobic workout that you sweat to, but a good yoga workout that combines stretching and deep breathing, with your pregnant body in mind.  The idea of yoga is that one can stretch as deep as they are able to for full benefit.  I follow the workout nearly every day, because of the incredible benefits I feel afterward.  Shiva Rea incorporates many side angle poses which strecth the hips, waist and ribs.  This has been extremely beneficial for me: I've even lost some extra weight in those areas, while my belly continues to grow.

Now, in my second trimester, I've come to rely on this workout, but it was only after I'd really learned the routine that I started to feel the benefits. I have noticed that Poppy, in her 3rd trimester, spends a lot of time seated in the chair: I wonder if I'll be able to continue some of the 2nd trimester modifications all the way through.

1355581,4,B00004U8H5,"I purchased and tried 3 prenatal fitness DVDs around the same time:

* Perfect Pregnancy Workout

* Prenatal Yoga

* Leisa Hart's Fit Mama Prenatal Workout

Here's how I thought they compared.  (Note that I do yoga and walk regularly; while I enjoy dancing, I do not dance regularly.  I'm not overweight.)

* Perfect Pregnancy Workout - 5 stars.  Designed and narrated by a Cirque du Soleil acrobat (faint French accent), this video is my favorite of the three.  The woman demonstrating the workout is about 8 months pregnant and in amazing athletic shape (visible muscle definition).  The theme of this video seems to be preparing for birth and staying strong and fit.  It has two sections: (a) workout and (b) instructions.

  (a) After a mercifully brief cheesy earth-mother introduction, the yoga-based workout is vigorous yet flowing and straightforward, building incredible muscle strength, flexibility, and stamina.  It includes squats, lunges, lots of ab work, lots of great hip stretches, kegels, lots of different arm strengtheners.  At the end I am sweating, breathing harder, relaxed, and satisfied.  The next day my muscles are sore (in a good way) and feel stronger.  The music is world-beat without vocals, easy to exercise to.

  (b) The instructions section is excellent as well.  Animated anatomical graphics clearly illustrate diastasis, how to check yourself for it, and how to modify your workout to avoid further muscle separation, as well as exactly what kegels are.  This part also explains in depth how to do the moves in the workout.

* Prenatal Yoga - 4 stars.  Designed and narrated by a UCLA-graduated yogi, this video is my second favorite.  Shiva is under 3 months' pregnant in the demonstration but has women behind her in second and third trimesters.  The theme of this video seems to be relaxing and preparing for motherhood.  It has three sections: (a) workout, (b) massage, and (c) interview.

  (a) The workout is much less vigorous than Perfect Pregnancy, but includes squats, lunges, many spinal twists, kegels (no deep explanation, just metaphor), lots of different stretches.  At the end I am sweating a bit, relaxed, and satisfied.  The music is new-age without vocals.  For some reason, Shiva does not pronounce the ""h"" in ""exhale"" which can be distracting.  Also the narration gets slightly out of sync with the demonstration in a few places, which can be confusing.

  (b) The massage section is fabulous if you have a partner willing to watch it and give you one!  Great techniques for feet, legs, back, and neck.

  (c) Shiva explains her story in the interview, how her father named her after an Indian god, how she took up yoga in college, etc.

* Leisa Hart's FitMama - 2 stars.  I bought this on Amazon's recommendation and I'm sorry I did.  My biggest gripe is that this video doesn't focus on smooth continuous deep breathing, unlike the other two DVDs.  Leisa is a perky actress who does infomercials.  She is 8 months pregnant in this but her body looks very different (thin, wiry) compared to the woman's in Perfect Pregnancy (athletic).  The theme of this video seems to be feeling better (sexier) about oneself while pregnant.  It has basically two sections: (a) workout and (b) bonus stretches.

  (a) The workout is much less vigorous than Perfect Pregnancy yet goes at a faster, more erratic pace than either of the other two videos.  It has four parts: salsa dance, ""yoga fat burn,"" labor and delivery prep, and prenatal stretch and relaxation.  The dancing is about 8 moves repeated, with a few squats.  I feel foolish and bored doing this.  The yoga fat burn is more aerobics than yoga, includes ab work, squats, no twists, never holds any pose for long, is repetitive.  Labor and delivery prep includes kegels (no real explanation), many boring arm swings, ab work.  Prenatal stretch and relaxation includes leg stretches, ab work, is repetitive.  The music is salsa, soft rock, and world beat without vocals; very good workout music, loud in places.

  (b) The bonus stretches are the best part, but are buried under Special Features (the DVD doesn't seem very well organized).  These include leg, back, hip and shoulder stretches actually held for several seconds, squats, plenty of rapid boring arm swings.

All three videos show women in different trimesters doing the exercises and mention appropriate modifications.  All three videos explain how to do the exercises safely and how to recognize warning signs of overdoing it.

If you're a yoga gal like me and you want to buy just one prenatal yoga video, get Perfect Pregnancy.  If you want your partner to give you a great massage too, get Prenatal Yoga.",1134604800,823,4676,4.940721649484536

Furthermore, I didn't experience anywhere near the backpain or leg cramps that my friends have experienced during their pregnancies, and I don't doubt that the reasons behind that are the fact that I worked out to this video several times a week throughout most of my pregnancy (working out in this case is loosely defined, as this video probably does not constitute as a ""work out,"" it is mostly stretching, breathing and preparing the body for labor).

I was regularly practicing yoga before I bought this DVD, and now find it more enjoyable than my ""live"" prenatal yoga or other yoga classes that I attend.

Sometimes I complete the entire DVD (3 sections to total about 50 minutes) or I just do one section for a quick relief on my back when I don't have enough time.

I find that it is not ""calorie burning"" or a ""workout"", but at the end, my muscles feel tired and awake and I can sleep better at night.  Highly recommended for women who appreciate the relaxing and strengthening that yoga can offer.",1133136000,,919,4.7125
1355586,3,B00004U8H5,"I just tried this workout for the first time.  I did yoga for a couple of years, wasn't spectacular at it, but not too bad either, but since I used to take classes at my school, I would have summers off, so I am pretty stiff now.  I have to say it's my first prenatal yoga DVD, so I don't know how it fares if compared to other DVDs.  Although I liked it, there are a few problems:
1.  At the beginning cueing doesn't seem to go with action in quite a few places, which was quite annoying - I'd do the exercise at the pace of her voice and then would glimpse at the screen to see the people on DVD completely out of sync with me, which threw me off.  It sort of persists throughout the DVD (the cue might be to lift arms, while they're still finishing up the previous pose), although not quite so bad.
2.  I feel like some poses, even those designed for the first trimester, were way too modified and way too easy (mind you, I'm very stiff and out of practice right now).  I think that once and if I get back to the shape I used to be in, I might just do some regular yoga with modifications to accomodate my changing body (plus, I simply fear that once I do this video a few times, it'll become too easy).
(I'm revising this review a couple of months later, I'm 5 months pregnant now, and I have to say, it is much harder to do some parts of the routine (just 2 or 3 poses) now than it was at 3 months, so maybe I underestimated the intensity a little, but I also have to admit, I have not been doing this regularly at all, so I am not only getting more pregnant, but also more stiff, which could have something to do with the level of difficulty I now experience as well).
3.  I also would have liked a slightly longer practice (or choices of shorter ones) and more flow, rather than just a series of postures.
4.  Some of the things she's saying sound a little ""new-agy"" to me, and annoy me rather than help.

To address some issues brought up by other reviewers, I didn't mind her voice so much (although I couldn't help to notice that she doesn't pronounce the ""h"" in exhale and for some reason I got fixated on that), and I thought her directions were pretty good and not annoying.  I also didn't mind the music at all - it is a good background without being overpowering and annoying.
I also was quite glad to have kegels incorporated into the workout simply because them being relatively easy to do, I tend to forget to do them at all, so it's nice to have time set aside in a workout just for those.
Overall, a good DVD, a great one for those who want a pretty gentle workout/stretching routine, but not so perfect for those of us who rely on yoga to keep us fit, especially those who are in shape as they begin it.",1131926400,2,2724,4.120754716981132

Shiva Rea's voice bothers me to no end. she is obviously very well informed, practiced, & knowledgable in yoga, but she just sounds so flakey and spacey. i cant get past it. and the the time spent devoted to kegal exercises is a bit excessive, how many women could possibly need that much help in doing kegals?? the organization on the DVD is great and the massage section is awesome and very cool, but that voice and tone has got to go. the background music is very ""new age"" also, while some people might like that i certainly am not 1 of them.",1130889600,,833,4.054545454545455

1355589,1,B00004U8H5,"I would definitely not recommend this workout to ANYONE who has previously practiced yoga. It is not challenging in the least bit. There is a whole lot of fluff in it. Shiva Rea taks too much in the beginning and you can't ffwd through it. I just want to exericse! I don't want to listen to her ramble on! She spends much too much time on kegels which if you are in your first pregnancy are irrelevant bc those muscles are already fit! If you have done yoga alot pre-pregnancy, stick with a regular yoga dvd until you are so big you cant move, and just do some modifications, such as not doing corpse pose during relaxation bc you should not be on your back after 4 mos. I have this dvd and now I don't know what to do w/ it. I am considering sending it to one of my pregnant girlfriends who is less fit and has never done yoga. Honestly, heed my advice, don't waste your money if you want to be remotely challenged.",1129852800,14,916,4.1807909604519775

The program is broken up in such a way that you can do just one of the 20 minute segments or all three for a more complete workout.  My apartment is small, and I can still do each posture.  My only slight criticism is the length of the whole work-out, as I work full time and am quite tired when I get home.  I would like to have a ""full"" workout in 20 minutes, but I'm not sure that's possible.  Regardless, this is a great program and the instructor is not too alienatingly ""new-age.""",1128384000,3,655,4.241935483870968
1355591,5,B00004U8H5,"The instruction and exercises in this DVD are excellent! The format is broken down into 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester variations with the use of helpful and practical props. The props suggested are a Yoga strap, blanket, Yoga block and a chair.

When I first began using this in my 2nd trimester, I did not feel like I was getting a very thorough (i.e. sweaty) workout. However, now that I am 36 weeks along, I find that this routine is about the only physical activity that I am able to handle. The use of a chair prop has been a lifesaver and I really appreciate how the poses open up my hips and chest. Shiva also makes us do some Kegel routines as well as squats to strengthen delivery muscles - a must in any prenatal workout. When I am finished, I feel very relaxed, refreshed, and as if my stiff and achy back, hips, and joints have been loosened up significantly.

Shiva has a very calm and soothing voice. Her instruction is pertinent and avoids being chatty, while new-agey type comments are kept to a bare minimum. The music is truly in the background and not at all obnoxious. The setting is pleasant and peaceful.

The only (very slight) negatives I have noticed is that Shiva moves a bit too fast in some spots and there is not enough time given to transition from a prop to a pose. However, you can always press ""pause"" if you find things moving too fast for you. Also, some of the poses are not explained, but I do not feel like this would be a problem for someone (like me) who is new to Yoga because the poses are demonstrated very well and is does not take much of a mental leap to figure out how to do them.

Other thoughts: Shiva suggests using a towel instead of a Yoga strap if you do not have one. However, I was unable to stretch the required body part by using a towel. I bought a Yoga strap and now feel like I am working the correct muscle group. Also, it has not been necessary for me to work exactly in the confines of the trimester divisions (I was still doing 2nd trimester variations well into my 3rd trimester), but I do STRONGLY advise you to heed Shiva's warnings and do ONLY what is comfortable! I was doing all the squats one day and found I could not the next day and had to start using a chair. That's just pregnancy. Don't feel bad about it. Roll with the changes and NEVER EVER do anything that hurts or feels uncomfortable, or you could risk injuring yourself and/or your baby!

**UPDATE** I now am seven weeks into being a new mama to a beautiful (really!) baby girl. I endured only about 15 minutes of pushing until baby popped out (not 2 to 3 hours of pushing like the nurses predicted). I credit this to being in shape from Prenatal Yoga and to regular chiropractic adjustments during pregnancy.

Still using it at 38 weeks, and it still helps me relax and improves my ability to sleep at night or get energized for work in the morning.  Unlike some other reviewers, I've found this DVD loads more quickly, and is easier to skip to the segment I want, than some others.  The narration was detailed enough that I could learn the routines quickly, but still allowed the motions to flow relatively continuously (no waiting).  Shiva Rea's voice didn't get on my nerves, even after several months (although I did occasionally discover the cloying music stuck in my head hours after using the video).  I never did get the hang of the Floor Work segment but I found the first two segments very effective in relieving my aches, pains and stress.

1355594,3,B00004U8H5,"As a yoga practictioner of over 10 years, I chose this video because I'm a long time fan of Shiva Rea. The dvd is divided into warm up, standing poses and then floor poses.  Regardless of what trimester you are in, every one spends a lot of time using or sitting on a chair.  I loved the way this video opened my hips and lengthened my hamstrings.  On the down side the verbal instructions do not always match what is taking place visually, the models do not mirror which can be confusing and during the floor work, there is a 180 degree turn which means you are now facing away from the tv.  This is a standard transistion in a yoga class but a bit thoughtless for a video workout, for the purposes of staying in front of the video i simply switched legs and ignored their transition.  The seated poses are not held for long at all, so I have to pause the video every time. If you are new to yoga or only have the money for one video buy CRUNCH YOGA MAMA.  Instructions are clear and those in your third trimester will probably get a better workout.  If you like down dogs go for Crunch.  Coming back to the Shiva Rea dvd, I paid for it so I will continue to use it as a compliment to my own practice and the Crunch dvd.  Even though I'm used to using props, on days where I'm feeling completely fatigued, I go for the Crunch dvd because I don't have the patience to mess with the chair and everything else!

I have noticed increased strength, flexibility, and much less pain in my back and neck since using this video.

I spotted lightly after first trying the DVD, even though I adjusted it to the 2nd trimester level (I am early in my first trimester) and went very slowly and gently. That put an end to my using the DVD for a week, by doctor's orders. When I tried again, I used only the opening sequences and a few of the standing exercises.

I have been practicing yoga since 1991, so I am familiar with the moves used on this tape. But I still found the positions a little hard to follow as described, and I found my abdomen twisting in quite a few places, which I think is just not a good idea at any stage of pregnancy. I am not sure that a beginner would follow this workout easily.

On the positive side, I liked the warm-ups, and, after a few tries, I was able to do most of the moves as described. I like very much that there are adjustments shown for each trimester. The lack of chapter subdivisions, however, is a minus. My spouse liked the section on prenatal massage.",1126310400,2,997,4.214659685863874

Prenatal Yoga-Shiva Rea, was the choice for my first venture into yoga and I was surprisingly pleased with the way my body felt after the workout. The video offers one workout, but has three women in first, second and third trimester completing the exercises. This allows the viewer to make the necessary accomodations based on where they are in pregnancy.

I wasn't interested in a video that focused on the spiritual essence of yoga. I was pleased in that regard as well. There is a meditative period at the end of the video, but it serves as the cool down and is important to complete to feel refreshed.

All and all, I am pleased with my choice.",1126137600,2,847,4.559210526315789

My only caveat is that my husband pointed out that Shiva Rea pronounces ""exhale"" without the ""h"" and after a while I guess that sort of bugs me.  Not that diction is a reason to buy a yoga DVD.

I started in my 11th week and continued to use it 2-3 times a week, schedule permitting. The music is relaxing and Shiva Rea's voice is very soothing. The poses are simple and are modified by trimester and there is time allowed to follow the instructors. It is divided into segments so you can skip the ones you are not comfortable with - I for one was not flexible enough for the ""floor work"" until doing the poses for a couple of weeks but it has definite benefits. It really relaxes and stretches the muscles that strain the most - lower back especially, and I found I can do some of the poses at work to release my aching back.

However, after only 5 or 6 uses, I find I hate the idea of hearing Shiva Rea's voice again, and for that reason don't even want to practice yoga.  I'm ordering another video today.

I'm a beginning to intermediate level yogi with quite a number of non-pregnancy DVDs.  Before pregnancy I usually used, and really liked, the Yoga Zone series.

Rea intones, in the oddest monotone accent, over the entire video.  Mostly what she is saying does not consist of helpful tips about position or breathing, but metaphysical nonsense.  She says things like ""Open your legs with awareness, in preparation for birth.""  And her pronunciations will have you fantasizing about a nice alchoholic beverage after your workout.  All in all, I find her so annoying that I can't focus and breathe properly, and hence don't feel I am getting the proper benefit from the yoga.

The workout itself is OK for stretching.  The variations for the later trimesters, as demonstrated by the two most dour and serious-looking women (even as Rea is intoning over them, ""Imagine that your baby is enjoying the gentle swinging motion..."")  are somewhat helpful.  I find the prop use excessive-- it interrupts a smooth flow of yoga, breaking up the workout and making it more difficult to concentrate.",1122595200,7,1380,4.821276595744681

I've never done yoga before, and it did take a few times through to be able to follow along (the narration is out of sync sometimes).

I would recommend this only for women who have practiced yoga for some time, as some of the stretching is very deep and held for at least 3 breaths. But I do feel like I get all the ""kinks"" out of my back after doing this DVD. Drawbacks: I can't understand why a seasoned pro like Shiva Rea doesn't understand the mirror technique for teaching--she instructs you to bend to the right, but you're seeing her bend to the left, which is confusing. Also, I think the poses are out of order. After the warmup, I forward to the standing postures and leave the kegel work for the end of the practice, as I find that stretching part too challenging for the beginning of the practice.",1120608000,13,797,4.32

I started not long after I found out I was pregnant, and now with only three weeks until my due date I am still loving this DVD more than anything... it's even better at times than my husband giving me a backrub and was especially helpful in the first trimester when I was too sick to do any cardio exercise but needed to do something, this got me out of my depression stage and I became a very happy pregnant lady.

The constant voice over, made breathing correctly with the postures very difficult, and the voice over doesn't match up with the action.

On a trivial note, we kept just cracking up.  The 3 women's have odd names, and the voice over is like a mock yoga instructors voice (""You are getting very sleepy"").",1117584000,7,598,4.390909090909091

I was somewhat disappointed, for a few reasons.  First, Shiva Rea talks too much.  Fine for the first few times you do the video, but after that it gets annoying to hear the same whisperings endlessly.  Second, it is heavy on the stretching (which is actually good) but light on the strengthening.  Hence, it's not much of a workout (as in boosting your heartrate).  Third, it's a bit too cautious in it's poses to allow work on balance (which pregnant mothers can do).  And fourth -- which is an important issue to me -- I find the spiritual aspect of yoga silly, and I was rolling my eyes throughout this video.  My studio class is much tuned down.

I think this video is still worth doing, though, if nothing else than for the stretching.  During my third pregnancy I did a minor stretching regimen to prepare for labor, and it really helped!  Yoga stretches are superbly designed for labor, and I am looking forward to an even better experience with child #4.",1116547200,,1151,4.5931372549019605
1355613,3,B00004U8H5,"This workout video, is very unlike traditional videos in that it's hard to follow.  Most workout videos has the instructor verbally walking you through the steps as they're doing it and also adjusts their movements so it's easy to follow, such as when they ask you to turn right, they're actually turning left since you're facing them and your right side is their left side.  This video is not like that at all.  The video is narrated by voice overs and when they say turn right, they're actually turning right, so it makes it confusing because your eyes are watching them turn to your left.  Plus since the instructor is doing voice over narrating, it doesn't always correspond with the movements.  There are numerous times when the verbal instructions tells you to get up, but the people on the screen are still sitting down, so the flow of it is confusing making it hard to relax and follow.

In the end, after doing the first 30 minutes of it, I was bored and frustrated because I focused more on trying to follow the motions on screen than actually relaxing and doing the yoga poses right, especially when the narration is off.

The pro about this video is that it does offer a good stretch and the stretches itself are relaxing when you can get it right.  I would probably look for an easier to follow video, especially when it comes to yoga and relaxation is part of the workout, not frustration and spending most of your time trying to figure out what they really want you to do.",1116288000,,1487,4.522388059701493

If you're a beginner, you could possibly add the '1st Trimester' stage as part of your daily routine (might as well get the most use out of this - you won't be pregnant forever!) I also love that it reminds me of my Yogalates (Yoga & Pilates) DVD by Louise Solomon, which is my absolute favorite, but can't be used throughout pregnancy if you don't know how to modify the poses.

1355618,3,B00004U8H5,"If you have never practiced yoga before, or if you have only limited experience with it, I would NOT recommend this video.

The positives:  It is in three sections:  ""warm-up"" (includes minimal breathing/relaxation & Kegel exercises), standing poses, and floor poses. All sections last approx 15 minutes. (There is a lengthy intro by Ms. Rea, which I had to fast-forward through after watching it once. It should have been part of the main menu options, instead of part of the main video. Likewise, the three sections should each be isolated as choices from the main menu.) Three women in the different trimesters show modifications according to the trimester:  a real plus. There ARE some wonderful stretches in this video. She tends to emphasize hip/pelvis-opening work:  a great idea for pregnant women.  She minimizes neck & shoulders. Hamstring group gets fair play. Her shivasana (final relaxation, or ""corpse pose"") is very mediocre; there are better ways to talk someone into total relaxation.

My DVD also came with a Prenatal Massage section (which, by itself, I would give 5 stars!), geared towards educating your partner on how to give you different kinds of massage:  feet, back, neck/shoulder.

The negatives:  As someone who has studied a little bit of Iyengar yoga, I was horrified that Ms. Rea didn't give better instructions on the postures themselves. She moves quickly, so if you are new to yoga, you won't know if you are doing/holding the posture correctly. She does not explain, for example, how to hold your weight, position your spine & pelvis, position your feet, how to stretch deeper into a pose, how to breathe, how to avoid slipping (why is she doing yoga on a handsome Afghan rug, not a mat?), and how to know when you are pushing yourself too hard. She just moves from one pose into the next, assuming the viewer can ""do it correctly"". I think this is a mistake.

The best yoga videos and classes give gentle, thorough instruction that connects mind, body, breath. Ms. Rea's video IS physically demanding, as yoga can be, but lacks the careful and accurate guidance that a prenatal yoga video should have.",1110844800,11,2137,4.908333333333333

1355620,2,B00004U8H5,"This was the first prenatal video I tried. After having done all of Wai Lana's easy series videos before pregnancy I loved the feeling I get from yoga and the feeling of having had a workout. I got neither of these from this DVD. The ladies in the video (one representing each trimester's modifications, which is very useful) move from one position into the next so quickly and Shiva (I'm guessing it is her talking) talks throughout in a way that I find very distracting. I did this with a friend who had never done yoga before and there wasn't enough explaination for her to do the poses safely and/or effectively. I tried doing yoga to this video many times, but never felt relaxed or connected when I had finished. I also felt like my upper body had not had a good workout. In favor of this DVD I will say that it is a 50 minute workout which is longer than most and so some people may like it just for this. Also, while her style of talking is distracting it is not very annoying. In the end, with this DVD, I just ended up not doing yoga at all, so I went on a search for a video that was better for me.

In my search I found ""Yoga for your pregnancy"" by Yoga Journal and Lamaze. When I finish I feel refresh, relaxed and reconnected...all the things I expect from yoga. This has only a 30 minute workout and goes slower, but I found that I felt more like I'd had a good workout when I'd finished - not real heavy, but good. I also liked not needing more than a blanket and/or chair as props. In this video there are also three ladies showing the various modifications. I love the extras on the video also...a relaxation ""workout"", ""Birthing Room Yoga"" and ""Postnatal practice"" to get you back in shape after birth. I might still use other videos occassionally, but I certainly love ""Yoga for your pregnancy"".",1110240000,11,1815,4.338235294117647
1355621,4,B00004U8H5,"This DVD is a good yoga workout. It features three women at each of the three trimesters so it's easy to do modifications based on your current ability. Shiva Rea repeats side stretches a little too often (she does them three or four times in different variations) and doesn't do any balance poses. I get a little more challenge and variety out of my yoga class but that's to be expected. The workout is an hour, broken into three parts (warmup, standing poses, and floor work) and is a nice way to get a workout in at home. Recommended props are a yoga blanket, block, and strap, as well as a chair but it's easy to make do with stuff found around the home.",1109548800,,658,4.314516129032258

I was in labor for only a few hours and the labor and delivery nurse commented that I seemed to be having a pretty easy time with the labor and what had I been doing?  I said this yoga video (plus swimming).  Hard to say if that is what made the labor relatively easy but I am now in my second pregnancy, same sickness, and just started the video at 17 weeks.  It made a lot of difference to me but my goals are not to prevent weight gain with this video.",1107043200,,723,4.286764705882353

I also found the props required cumbersome and unnecessary. I will try it again when I get further along and see if it is more beneficial as one reviewer suggested.

1355626,5,B00004U8H5,"I was a gym rat before I got pregnant, but work and travelling a lot during my pregnancy have prevented me from getting to the gym as often as I'd like. I am also skeptical of exercise tapes. But I have to say that this DVD has been a really wonderful surprise.

If you are already pretty fit, it will increase your heart rate only a bit on some more challenging moves, like yogic squats, and it probably won't build strength like weight work does. But the moves are excellent for stretching and balance. They make you feel strong and capable at a time when perhaps your body always doesn't. (My husband tried a couple of moves and failed miserably, poor guy!) They definitely relieve tension and are good to do at the end of the day.

I think even if you have had minimal yoga experience, like I have, the DVD is still pretty easy to follow, and there are three women at different stages in their pregnancies who are your guides. And it's so great to see normal-looking, beautifully round expectant mothers rather than twigs with a bump that society increasingly wants us to be when we are pregnant.",1106265600,5,1100,4.467661691542289

1355628,5,B00004U8H5,"I love this video!!!  I never did yoga before my pregnancy; was mainly a step aerobics/cross-training person.  I bought this video from Amazon based on others' reviews.  This is a GREAT video.

I have an hour-long commute in the mornings, and I'm on my feet a lot at work, so I have been experiencing a lot of back and leg pain during pregnancy.  This video rids me of that pain, and helps to get rid of my slight ankle swelling.

As a cross-training-type person, I thought that anything that didn't make me break into a vigorous sweat couldn't be beneficial.  This video has broken this belief for me.  I have really gained a lot of strength and flexibility from this video.

First off, Shiva Rea's voice is so incredibly soothing, she makes you feel like you're getting a massage.  The music and set are peaceful and calming.  The overall production is relaxing.

The mood is set with mediation and warm-ups.  Then there's standing work, floor work, stretch, and guided relaxation.  Kegels are worked into various sections.  Each section is subdivided, so you can do only part of each if you like.

Traditional poses are covered, such as planks, downward dogs, triangle pose, etc.  (I don't know much about yoga.)  Instruction is clear and understandable.  Breathing is always kept at the forefront, with Shiva's never forgetting to tell you when to inhale and exhale.

There's one person representing each trimester, demonstrating the recommended modifications for each trimester.  As I've found as I've gone along, these variations are very helpful.

This is a great video.  Do not do pregnancy without it.  Start lightly and build up if you need to, but you have to get this video for prenatal exercise.  It helps me with my pains, and makes me feel relaxed.  I really feel like I have gotten a massage after I finish this video.

The last thing I'll say is that there are little moves in the video that I've been able to do at work to alleviate some of my aches.  I highly recommend this DVD, even if only for Shiva's voice and the soothing music that accompany it.",1096934400,46,2071,4.693593314763231

In response to some of the posts that had negative things to say...first of all I don't care that this video uses a voice over.  Because once you do a video a few times you don't look at it as much.  It didn't bother me at all.  Also, so what if the instructor is not officially pregnant.  In the video she represents first tri with 2 other women (one in second tri and one in third) behind her.  I for one like it when the instructor says exhale and inhale because it helps me to remember which one is more beneficial for that particular move.  The instructor's voice is soothing, the music is relaxing, and the setting is very peaceful.

I definately reccommend this video for those looking for a more in depth yoga video and not just and easy relaxing video.",1093132800,18,908,4.196531791907514
1355636,4,B00004U8H5,"I have several pre-/ante-natal yoga videos, and I am currently studying to teach yoga for pregnant women and new mothers.  I believe this practice to be the best, real yoga video/dvd out there for pregnant women at the time.  Not perfect, but miles ahead of any of the others I have seen, if you are interested in doing an actual asana/yoga movements practice, and not just a relaxation routine.

Most other tapes/dvds are not actually doing yoga, but doing gentle movements and stretches, only some of which are based on actual yoga.  I'm NOT knocking those.  They are great for what they do, and when you have morning sickness or joint trouble, they can be just what you need.  BUT, if you are truly a yoga practitioner, you want to do real yoga, not a hybrid programme.

If you already practice yoga, you will love this.

If you are generally fit already, and had a decently regular fitness routine before pregnancy, you will love this.

If you've never done any yoga or other fitness routine before, this may be too challenging or confusing for you.

Only technical problem:  Shiva Rea's cues are off at 1 point in the 40 min routine (the voice over says ""stand with feet shoulder width apart,"" while she demonstrates the much wider stance necessary for the pose).  But if you are doing what she is showing, you'll miss that glitch and move on smoothly.",1092268800,10,1357,4.631799163179917

It has three women in three stages of pregnancy-- with varying poses.  Video uses yoga block, mat and rope and a chair (but I never used the block and rarely the rope)

Great, relaxing stretches that really help sore, stiff muscles.  At the same time, challenging enough to get my heart rate up.  The instructor gives very good explanations of each pose, although I agree with a previous review that it's sometimes difficult to figure out left and right because she does not mirror the poses.  It's nice how the whole workout is broken into segments so you don't have to do the whole thing if you are just starting out or if you don't have enough time.  I also like that Kegel exercises are included.  She ends with a nice relaxation segment that you can skip ahead and do whether you've completed the whole workout or not.
I do have to laugh out loud at some of the things she says about connecting to the baby, etc.  It's just not me.  But the goofy moments are few and far between.  My biggest complaint actually would be that she says to inhale and exhale SO SLOWLY.  (""Inhale.....[5 sec. later]....Exhale""--um, I exhaled 3 seconds ago!)  Perhaps they have much greater lung capacity than I do, but I certainly can't breathe like that.

As for the CONTENT of the DVD, I guess it's okay. I've done the routine twice and am already a bit bored with it, and I find the narrator's voice telling me to ""imagine your baby is enjoying the rocking motion,"" etc. a little annoying.

After learning I was pregnant, I researched several different prenatal yoga tapes to find one that would focus more on building strength and flexibility, and less on New-Agey chanting or visualization. I am much more interested in preparing my body for labor than I am in chanting or mantras! From the reviews I read, this seemed to be the best prenatal yoga workout that would focus on the areas that I am interested in.
Although i had never done Yoga, and actually didn't begin until I was in my second trimester, I found this tape extremely easy to follow. The poses are not terribly challenging, but I have definitely noticed a difference in my strength and flexibility, which is very encouraging!
The one flaw that I have found is that after a month or so, the workout seemed a little too easy. So I got the Leisa Hart Fitmama Workout also, and now I alternate those 5-6 days a week. I highly recommend using these two together - the Fitmama Workout is more high impact (it actually makes me sweat!) so I feel more worked out at the end, while the Prenatal Yoga is a good, low-impact workout for the days in between.
I've read some reviews that criticize Shiva Rea for not actually talking during workout (it's all voiceover). But that really didn't bother me. She does come off a little drippy at times, but all-in-all this is one of the most focused Prenatal Yoga workouts that I've come across!",1066348800,11,1442,4.571428571428571

The exercises are perfectly designed for the aches and pains of pregnancy, as well as for birth preparation.  In fact, you'll find many of these same poses recommended in the best natural childbirth books.

I had no trouble following the video and getting back into it.  I liked the 3 different models showing different modifications.  I didn't like that each model was specifically for a trimester.  I wish it took more of a ""do what feels right"" approach.  Many of us can still do most of the postures with no or small modifications.  The tape assumes in trimester 3, all you can do is sit in a chair and put your arm or leg out.  The relaxation at the end is fantastic.  The modifications here are completely appropriate to enhance circulation for each trimester.  All in all, it's a good pregnancy workout.

I bought Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga video and was annoyed by it. Although I am very familiar with common yoga postures, I couldn't understand what I was supposed to be doing from listening to her, and I had to keep looking at the screen to figure out what she was talking about. Then, as soon as I got into the pose, she would quickly shift to something else, so I never got to hold any pose for more than a few seconds. Annoying. She also drones on at the beginning of the video for a few minutes, which is minimally boring when you want to get started the first time, but REALLY boring when you are doing the tape on a regular basis and you have to fast forward through it every time. Lastly, I felt like I got no workout whatsoever from Shiva Rea's tape, and barely a stretch. Maybe if I had been able to hold the poses a little longer than the split second she allowed... The woman in her third trimester hardly did anything at all.
Crunch Yoga Mama was MUCH better. I really liked the teacher. She was straightforward, and best of all, she was actually pregnant! She gave a better selection of poses, a bit more challenging, but still very easy, and I hardly had to even look at what she was doing...she was very descriptive when telling us what moves to do next. I liked the variety of pregnant women in her ""class"". She had women in all different stages, and they were all doing pretty much the same moves, except for one woman who was demonstrating modified moves for women who wanted to take it really slow. My only complaint was that I would have liked to hold the poses a bit longer, especially at the end, when she guided us into a closing relaxation/meditation poses that you normally allow at least 10 minutes for in a typical yoga class...in the video we got about a minute to relax and clear our minds before being told to get back up again.

1355687,5,B00004U8H5,"I was new to yoga when I started this tape.  A former runner and elliptical-trainer enthusiast, I am used to a workout that makes you sweat buckets and finish feeling spent.  This was a very new experience for me.
Yoga was recommended to me by my doula. I was interested because I've never been a flexible person and I wanted desperately to exercise throughout my pregnancy.  Yoga is ideal because it can be modified as your progress and it teaches you to relax, breathe, and move deliberately with control.  Every morning, when I've finished this workout, I feel so loose and relaxed, like I could ""slip down the drain.""  I also feel more confident as my due date approaches that I will successfully birth my baby without any medication.  I am learning how to open up my pelvis, strengthen my pelvic floor, and RELAX AND BREATHE.  While pregnant you have 40 weeks (give or take a few) to prepare for the hardest (and most rewarding) work you'll ever do.  Make the most of it!
This video was designed with your choice of three people to follow--one for each trimester.  Many modifications are suggested and modeled so no matter what your current state of fitness, you will find stretches and poses to do.
You will be plagued by aches and pains and restless nights if you don't take care of your body while you're pregnant.  So many of my friends try to comiserate with me, ""Oh, you poor thing!  I hated being pregnant!  It's so uncomfortable!""  I just smile and say, ""I feel great!"" becuase I really do.",1059436800,304,1503,4.584269662921348

I had an awesome natural birth and I know that the work I did beforehand played a big part.  Now that I am pregnant with my second child, I am using it again, preparing for another natural birth.  I love the music--it isn't too invasive or corny, and I also like the fact that the instructor doesn't get too hung up on the eastern mysticism that sometimes gets thrown in on a yoga video.  A very balanced workout, you can fast forward to another section for a lighter workout, or if you don't have much time.

Overall, there's nothing negative to say about the video, I just don't find it as motivating or enjoyable as other yoga videos I've used.  There's something about the presenter that I find kind of grating, and there's nothing that just hits me and makes me say, ""Great!  I'm so glad I'm doing this!"" aside from my own internal motivation....since that's not so strong these days, I wish it could be coming from the video.  Many yoga videos just get me in the right frame of mind to feel like it's well worth my effort, and I feel invigorated by what I'm learning.  That just doesn't happen here.  That being said, as I'm preparing for a natural childbirth, the exercises that are recommended to prepare the body to support a nat. childbirth are all built in nicely to the program on the tape (even just the meditative warm-up), so doing this will definitely be beneficial to your baby.",1057881600,2,1091,4.592783505154639

1355707,5,B00004U8H5,"**Note:  Since writing this review, my son is now 7 months old.  I just wanted to update to inform anyone considering this video, that after having my son, I went back to my pre-baby size!  I worked out diligently 5 days a week, once a day (sometimes twice a day) and I ate right... well, MOST of the time! ;)  This video and the other video I talk about in the following review were SERIOUSLY the best purchases I made during pregnancy.**
Now, feel free to continue for more information:
I do NOT understand how I went through my first pregnancy without this video!!  Whilst pregnant with my first daughter, I worked out very little, making losing the after baby weight THAT much more difficult.  I made the decision once I finally DID lose the weight that with the next pregnancy, I would not make a stupid choice like that again.
I did weeks of research before I finally chose two videos:  Fit Mama with Leisa Hart and PRENATAL YOGA WITH SHIVA RAE.  I wanted to make sure that wherever I spent my money, that I would not regret the purchase.  I read and re-read reviews written by other mommies and mommies-to-be who had used these videos and 99% of what I read was positive, so I ordered and hoped for the best.
From the first moment that I did Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rae, I was in LOVE!  I did not order until my second trimester (money issues prevented ordering earlier) but I wanted to work out no matter what and no matter how far along I was.
This video has become a staple in my daily routine.  No matter if I have to wake up early, stay up late or do it during my daughter's nap time, I do it religiously!  Five days a week once a day and even sometimes twice a day.
There are days that I do not have time to do it and I am so bummed to have missed it!  When my body feels as though every muscle, ligament and joint is out to get me, I turn on this video and by the end of the tape, I feel normal again (well, as normal as any pregnant woman can feel)!
A total plus to this video is that it is perfect for my two and a half year old to do along with me.  The intensity level is made for pregnant women (who should not be trying to be Billy Blanks, Tae Bo Master) so my daughter can join in on the activity (as much as her toddler coordination will allow) and I can have my workout.
I truly, highly recommend this video for any pregnant woman in any trimester at any level of fitness.  Your body, mind and spirit will thank you!",1054857600,,2440,4.150743099787686

It is not the most challenging, but it is good for the times you want a more relaxing/soothing workout. That is why I do like the voiceover.  It helps to create a relaxing mood. The workout is broken up into 3 sections approximately 15 minutes each, so you can do what you have time for. There are 3 woman who do the routine on tape, one for each trimester of pregnancy, so you always have someone to follow.

Although it is a very basic beginner-type yoga program, a minimal amount of yoga experience helps, so that you know how it is supposed to feel and you can adjust for your changing center of gravity. I'm glad I started doing it early in my pregnancy because although the poses for later pregnancy are modified, I have a feeling for what muscles to use and what the full stretch feels like. I really think this program is meant as a progression throughout pregnancy, and the third trimester model helps you maintain (not attain) tone and flexibility.",1041724800,9,872,4.525316455696203
1355731,5,B00004U8H5,"I love this video!  I'm a couple weeks from giving birth, and have been using it almost daily from month three.  It is relaxing, easy to follow, and helps you feel confident, knowing that the exercises are appropriate to your trimester.
I started using this tape in desperation because of some extreme pregnancy related sciatic nerve pain.  After one week the pain had lessened considerably, and after two it was gone. (Note: it isn't supposed to go away until after birth if you have it, so my dr was pretty shocked.) I'm pretty large at this point, but the pain has never returned, and although I'm feeling more awkward as my due date nears, I have had a much easier pregnancy, with fewer aches and pains, and I sleep more easily than any of my pregnant friends.
This video includes every exercise recommended by our lamaze instructor and doctor. The duration is 50 mins, but goes quickly. It is not taxing, but does stretch and tone muscles. I hate to 'work out' and it is at a perfect tempo to exercise without getting sweaty (hey, I get enough of that just because I'm pregnant  ;-). Also, it isn't so new-age as to be annoying.  -Oh, as you get bigger, I would suggest buying a yoga mat too.

The woman in the video are each in a trimester and you follow the one whose trimester you fall in.

The exercises are not extreme, and are well within the abilities of a pregnant woman (even this ""old"" 37-year-old first-time mom!).  In my third trimester, I am most grateful for the gentle stretching of the poses - which eases the general aches caused by my ever-expanding uterus.
I anticipate that I'll continue to use this video during my post-partum period, as well.",1003536000,37,679,4.93859649122807
1355800,3,B00004U8H5,"I bought this VHS when I was 3 months pregnant along with 2 other prenatal aerobic VHS.  I have not had alot of exposure to Yoga but wanted to give this one a go.  And I must say, it is quite difficult if you've never done yoga before or if you don't quite have the strength and stamina.  I have worked out occasionally so I am not new to doing routines but I found this one quite strenuous and difficult for beginners, not to mention beginners who were pregnant.  For me, I just preferred the aerobics as it's livelier and similar to dancing but at a slower pace.  However, if you've done yoga before this may be no trouble for you.",1003276800,5,633,4.198347107438017
1355801,5,B00004U8H5,I am now 9 months pregnant and have been using this video since I was about 3 months.  I have been using it more and more and find that the workout is gentle yet effective.  It helps me sleep and I feel that it has helped with my flexibility and relaxation.  Some days I do only 15 minutes.  Other days I will do 30 minutes.  Each of the 3 sections has poses that I really enjoy.  The modifications are useful and make poses that would otherwise be impossible this late in pregnancy quite doable.  I'm very happy with this video and would recommend it to anyone (unless perhaps you're already very experienced in yoga in which case it would probably be too easy).,997920000,27,663,4.341463414634147
1355802,1,B00004U8H5,"This video seemed like a great idea. Ive done yoga for years and looked foward to continuing in my pregnancy. I was very disappointed. The women on the cover is not actually pregnant in the video. It was very hard with little moderations made for pregnant women. There was alot of activities you are not supposed to do in pregnancy, like abdominal streches and downward dog.  This video was very difficult to do and is strenuous on both mom and baby. I was not happy with this one at all.",997228800,21,488,4.4222222222222225
1355803,5,B00004U8H5,"I barely started doing yoga for the first time. I am six months along. Before this time, I had to have my boyfreind rub and message my aching back. But once I started with this video, it helped relieve the aches and helped me to lie down without dealing with muscle spasms. I also liked the choice of music. It helped realx the body, along with doing the stretches. I recommend this video for beginers and for the those who may not necessarily be fit (and I am sure for those who are fit, and just want something that is helpful for relieving aches.)",994982400,2,550,4.298076923076923

7923775,3,B00004U8H5,"I am in my first trimester. I was fairly active before pregnancy as I was recovering from a broken wrist. I want to stay active during my pregnancy the best I can.
This is 1 video on the CD. They are not broken down into sections so its hard to pick a section (such as standing pose) and do that if your looking to break up the workout.
Its more great stretching then yoga. Very gentle workout. Good for a day when your just tired and not motivated. I like that they demonstrate 3 levels guided towards the pregnancy trimester but do wish the different sections were seperated.",1522972800,,577,4.351851851851852

7923779,1,B00004U8H5,"Wayyyy too easy. This is not a workout i feel like. They use a chair during almost every pose. And it's not a huge deal but she says ""exhale"" as "" eggs-ale"" which gets annoying after a bit.",1515974400,,189,4.0

7923782,2,B00004U8H5,"Pros: Very entry level and she had modifications for each trimester performed simultaneously.  Easy to follow instructions.

Cons: SO SLOW.  This is not the video you want if you regularly practiced yoga pre-pregnancy and like to have a bit of an elevated heart rate.  I was beyond frustrated with the sluggish pace and lack of challenging or diverse poses.  It's also really long and half of the video feels like you are just focused on breathing.  I'm in my 3rd trimester, and I'm sorry but I do not need the ""sitting in a chair"" modification she provides for this stage of pregnancy.  There was not an adequate modification for my stage and experience level, so I just performed the poses for the 1st trimester.  I found Elena Brower's Prenatal and Postnatal Yoga much more fulfilling and the segments are just 30 minutes, but you get your heart rate elevated.",1503446400,,863,4.74496644295302
7923783,4,B00004U8H5,"I really enjoy this video. Shiva Rae has a calming husky voice and she doesn't do as much of the awkward pregnancy pep talk as other videos. There is still quite a bit of ""connect with your baby"" stuff, which is great if you want that and tolerable if you're really just here to do yoga.

Unlike other reviewers, I don't think 50 minutes is too long for a session. In fact, I am more satisfied by a full length yoga session than I am at the end of 30 minutes, which is what most videos offer. My only criticism is that the voice over is not synced with the women's yoga activity, so you kind of have to close your eyes and follow the voice once you know the poses.

Finally, you probably shouldn't invest in this  if you're already in your third trimester, because the third trimester girl barely gets to do anything beyond sit in a chair and occasionally stretch from side to side (okay, I'm exaggerating... kinda. But srsly the third trimester yoga is really boring). I started in my second and had amazing benefits. Better sleep, better mood, toned arms and legs. My weight gain has been average and right on schedule and I've only gained weight in my abdomen, which surprised me because I'm 29 and I can't stop drinking milkshakes! ;_;",1501804800,,1239,4.425438596491228
