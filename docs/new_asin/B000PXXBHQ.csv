Absolutely recommend it if you're into brasilian music, or any kind of latin music, you just can't be still while listening to this great artist.",1188000000,,274,4.851063829787234
2828621,5,B000PXXBHQ,I haven't heard Brazilian music in a long while and just loved this DVD.  There are some older songs together with some new Ivete Sangalo hits.  All the songs are awesome and transpire great energy.  I danced to the whole DVD!  Even my American friends that know absolutely nothing about Brazilian music were surprised at the beat of every song.  It is a must own!!!!,1184198400,,367,4.584615384615384

""Abalou"" (Let's Rock!)

Five MARVELOUS Stars. A stunning performance, worthy of Six Stars. Take one of Brazil's biggest selling ax&eacute; and MPB (Brazilian Popular Music) singers and tape her in front of a wild standing-room-only crowd at one of the world's largest performance arenas, Maracan Stadium in Rio De Janeiro, and the result is a smoking live DVD set that is INCENDIARY. This Latin-Grammy winning singer, who rose to fame as the lead singer of ax&eacute; group 'Banda Eva', is dressed initially in a snug patent-leather jumpsuit and boots, arriving on a motorcycle like Trinity in ""The Matrix"" movie. The charismatic Ivete then jump-starts the show with a blistering 15 minute 'tour de force', as part of a whopping overall 24 clean ax&eacute;, reggae, and MPB songs, with several costume changes. English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles reveal the meaning of the Brazilian-Portuguese lyrics. Saulo from 'Banda Eva', Samuel, Alejandro Sanz, Durval Lelys, and others are special guests. She is totally in command of an immense crowd.

The show shifts gears near the end and becomes pure magic as Ivete, visibly moved by an audience that knows all of her lyrics, serves up medium tempo sambas, and then hovers, on an elevated platform, over the audience delivering soulful, sensual ballads like ""Deixo"". Aided throughout the show by a large musical group, singers, and dancers and a constantly changing special effects screen behind, Ivete is in the perfect venue for her powerful up-tempo delivery, the soft side of her voice, her dancing, and attractive clothing. This is a DVD of a great show delivered to one of the biggest audiences in history by one of Brazil's favorite performers, with meticulous attention to detail, that looks fantastic on a big flat screen TV or even on a computer. The cinematography is excellent. It's all sung completely in Brazilian Portuguese, but the multi-language closed-captioning gives us complete translations of what is going on. Kudos to Joana Mazzucchelli the DVD director, Rafael Draqaund the artistic director, and the entire 3000 person crew for pulling this off. My Highest Recommendation. Five MESMERIZING Stars.

8193674,5,B000PXXBHQ,"Ivete Sangalo is a Brazilian force of nature; although Im not particularly fond of Brazilian popular music I was completely enthralled by her impressive performance and mighty contralto voice. Her energy, charisma and sex-appeal makes everyone want to dance when she exhorts the audience to get your feet of the ground (Tira o p do cho!!!).

Through the show she sings not only her originals but also timeless Brazilian classics and excellent duets with remarkable singers such as Alejandro Sanz, Durval Lelys or MC Buchecha (among others).

With beautiful outfits and unending energy, even when there was a technical glitch she managed to bring her leadership and faith (only Latin-American women can mix sexiness with religion convincingly and with sincerity) to the fore controlling a potential crisis with glamour and sincerity.

50000 persons watched this concert live in Maracan stadium by December 2006, now you can watch it also at your place, be prepared to jump a lot in your living room.",1427155200,,998,5.148148148148148
