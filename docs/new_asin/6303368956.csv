7844979,5,6303368956,"Can you imagine Buster Keaton as a Don Juan or a romantic Casanova? Me neither! He plays a simple sign-hanger who's drafted into being a love-'em-and-leave-'em lover boy. Why? Because there's this guy that can't marry his fiance because she refuses to marry him until her sister gets married first (innocent times those were!)Her sister wants a ""romeo"" who is unpredictable and has a wandering eye. Go figure! If you want a movie that is funny and clean, this one is good!",1318723200,,472,4.7682926829268295
7844980,4,6303368956,"PARLOR, BEDROOM AND BATH (1931): ""Parlor, Bedroom and Bath""  (PB&B) is a farce comedy about a wealthy socialite who desires only  dangerous men she can't be sure of. She's conned into believing that  hum-drum Buster is a philandering Don Juan. The movie was partially filmed  at Buster's goliath-size Beverly Hills estate. The most bizarre scene in  PB&B is at the beginning, where we see Buster doing the poorman's job  of hammering an advertisement to a telephone pole, with the Keaton mansion  looming in the murky black and white distance. We get a tour of the  swimming pool area and backyard, as the athletic Buster is chased  throughout the grounds by handymen and gardeners. (I noticed that the  film's production crew forgot to dismantle and remove Buster's sons'  swingset, which had no business sitting on the lawn of a bourgeois,  unmarried, childless woman's estate. Also within view is his kids'  playhouse).
The second half of PB&B takes place in a hotel room where  lots of door-slamming scenes occur. Some very funny lines emerge from these  scenes. Buster plays opposite Cliff ""Ukulele Ike"" Edwards, whose  character is the only bellhop I've ever seen who has the nerve to barge  into a hotel suite without knocking first, always when Buster is making out  with a girl.
SPEAK EASILY (1932): Buster's childhood spent less than 1  day in a schoolroom (mobile vaudeville upbringing), but in ""Speak  Easily"" he was a good enough actor to pull off the dweeb-like role of  Timolean (!) Zanders Post, a college professor who spews lines like  ""don't equivocate"", ""we may meet at some future time, per  chance?"", ""the dance is anachronistic"" and ""there  should be more sinuosity"". I half-expected hearing a line like  ""I'm allergic to fowl"", but it never emerged. The plot involves  Timmy Post financing a no-talent vaudeville troupe's debut on Broadway. The  vaudeville troupe's vocabulary uses words like ""palooka"", with  Jimmy Durante at that helm.
By the time Buster made ""Speak  Easily"" in 1932, his original comedic style from the 1920's of  performing mechanical sight gags with dangerous acrobatic stunts had pretty  much been squashed by his bosses at the MGM studios. However, in this film,  I was surprised to find that they let him be dragged from a moving train  and hang from the rafters of a theater. It was the last time he would be  able to perform dangerous stunts in grade A films.
My editions of these  films came on this 2-volume set. The price is very reasonable, but the  films were recorded on LP speed. I wish the manufacturer had recorded on SP  speed and given me better quality. The viewing quality is not bad, but I  would not have minded paying a few dollars more for a clearer picture.",968112000,,2726,4.87117903930131
7844981,3,6303368956,"I have been a Buster Keaton fan for a long time and was thrilled to find this 2-video set for such a low price - even though it had two movies that are considered past Keaton's prime.  It didn't take me long to realize that  the reason for the low cost was that both movies are recorded on the slow  speed setting!  Still watchable but certainly down a notch in recording  quality.  After reading Leonard Maltin's review I was expecting ""Speak  Easily"" to be entertaining and ""Parlor, Bedroom and Bath"" to  be a visual chore.  However, I found the opposite to be true.  ""Speak  Easily"" relied too much on pseudo clever dialog and not nearly enough  on Keaton's comical visual artistry (my best attempt at sounding like a  movie snob).  The only laugh I could muster was at the end of the movie  when Buster got caught in a stage rope.  This movie was interesting to me  only as a curiosity.  ""Parlor, Bedroom, and Bath"", however, was a  pleasent surprise.  Although it starts off slow it picks up when Buster's  character, the naieve, innocent Reginald Irving, is encouraged to stage a  romantic interlude with a woman.  The resulting chaos that results reminds  me of some of the later Marx Bros. movies (some of which Keaton helped out  behind the camera).  However, none of the Marx Bros. had Keaton's  athleticism.  Even my wife laughed out loud a number of times and this  really isn't her favorite type of humor.
If you haven't seen a Buster  Keaton movie before please look at one of his earlier silent works first  (e.g. The General, Sherlock Jr.) because the films included in this box set  are not even close to his best (his movies got less entertaining as he lost  creative control).  But for those of you like me who are fans of Keaton and  know what he's capable of, you might find ""Parlor, Bedroom &  Bath"" an interesting and entertaining treat.  Don't bother with  ""Speak Easily"" unless you, like me, are trying to collect all of  Keaton's films.",948758400,,1962,4.593023255813954
