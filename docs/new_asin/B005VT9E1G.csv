8487691,5,B005VT9E1G,"I am in the middle of watching the DVD, but I am finding her instructions very easy to follow and her lessons seem to cover not only what I want to know, but questions I might have.  Highly recommended",1428883200,,201,4.153846153846154
8487692,5,B005VT9E1G,"The techniques presented in this video are presented in a step-by-step fashion and if followed, would allow anyone to be able to do the intricate beading illustrated.  I had purchased the video directly from the author at a promotion event.  My granddaughter, who is a beader, desired to do beading on clothing, and since she is 200 miles away and I cannot teach her myself, I feel this video is the next best thing to Grandma. Even though it cost more for the video from Amazon than I  had paid, I feel it is worth the price.  It is the best ""go to"" directions for beading on cloth I have encountred.",1397001600,2,601,4.387387387387387
8487693,5,B005VT9E1G,"Lyric is a wonderful and entertaining teacher.  I rally like embroidery and bead work to embellish my smaller quilts.  I've done beading and have not always been happy with the results.  Her video not only showed what I was doing wrong, but gave me lots of tips and ideas for future quilts.  I really garnered a lot from this DVD.  I don't make modern art quilts, my stuff tends more toward the traditional or whimsical ... but I definitely learned a lot from the DVD and would recommend it to any quilter who wants to learn more about beading or quits.",1390176000,,553,4.435643564356436
8487694,5,B005VT9E1G,"Bead It Like You Mean It adds important information to your beading library.  Clear, easy to follow instructions make this a must have DVD.",1370044800,,139,4.791666666666667
8487695,5,B005VT9E1G,"I've finally decided to try to use some beading in a few of my quilts.  This book has some great - and easy - ideas and the instructions seem simple enough.  But it also has more detailed ideas so you can move forward too.  It was worth the purchase (and often you get one or two great ideas and the rest of the book is throwaway, so this means a lot to me!)",1369612800,4,358,3.8767123287671232
8487696,5,B005VT9E1G,"Lyric does a great job of combining visual instruction and verbal descriptions as she carefully works with several types of beads. She takes you from a beginning level to a more advanced level of techniques. She gives you a tutorial of what to buy and not buy in the big world of beading supplies, and shows you examples of her own work.

 This DVD lasts about 2 hours and is broken up into sections; so that you can select one section at a time, as you work along with Lyric. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to get an introduction into the world of beading. One section is for using beads on clothing and quilts. This was especially helpful.",1337558400,9,659,4.39344262295082
