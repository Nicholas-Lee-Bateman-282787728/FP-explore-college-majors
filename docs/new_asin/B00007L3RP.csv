7977680,1,B00007L3RP,Terrible sound quality. It sounds as if there's an artillery barrage going on throughout the entire disk. Very weak dubbing and the speaker can hardly be understood. An excellent film series is the Battlefield Collection with Piggot-Smith. This wasn't even close to that quality production.,1490572800,,290,5.466666666666667
7977681,2,B00007L3RP,I thought this was part of the old pbs battlefield series but unfortunately it wasn't it's still an ok documentary but a far cry from the battlefield series,1479600000,,156,4.607142857142857
7977682,4,B00007L3RP,this is a fine video but there is so much about the Russian front that is still unknown because of Russian lies about the war and there casualties . And the real story of the cold war.,1446595200,,184,4.0
7977683,1,B00007L3RP,The DVD did NOT work.,1441584000,,21,3.4
