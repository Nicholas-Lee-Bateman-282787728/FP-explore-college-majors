7965338,1,B0000694XF,took a classic like Dance of the Drunk Mantis and paired it with garbage. Then on top of that the picture quality was not that great on either movie but at least i knew the Drunk Mantis was a good movie subtitles and all next time leave them seperate,1367884800,,250,4.122448979591836
7965339,2,B0000694XF,"The ""Black Belt Theater"" series often leaves much to be desired.  The transfer of Dance of the Drunken Mantis is so bleached out that the subtitles are often unreadable.  Whenever the silver-haired Jang Lee appears, most of his face is indiscernable.  What a waste of money!  The picture quality on From China with Death (which is dubbed) is also horrible, but due to cropping and the dirty, VHS ""original"" that was used.  I have learned my lesson with ""Black Belt Theater"": I won't buy that title again.
My advice is that you go to a Hong Kong Imports film distributer and try to find ALL your kung-fu films there.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of the really good, re-masters of the best martial arts films (per their original HK release version) are Region 3 encoded.",1082073600,3,773,4.731343283582089
7965340,1,B0000694XF,"I cannot even rate ""Dance of the Drunk Mantis"" as a film.  The subtitles are unreadable and the picture quality is terrible.  It made for a baffling viewing experience.  It might be worth it if you didn't need the subtitles.  Maybe.",1053561600,,232,4.585365853658536
7965341,3,B0000694XF,"First off the picture quality is poor on both movies.  ""Dance"" is widescreen but the picture's brightness is so bad that you lose the action at points and the subtitles are often unreadable.  ""China""'s picture quality is fullscreen but somewhat more watchable but is taken from a VHS copy and even freezes and has tracking problems at points.  ""Dance"" is the only reason to get this DVD as it is a Yuen Woo Ping movie and a sequel of sorts to Drunken Master with Jackie Chan.  The action is good (when you can see what's happening) even if the storyline is missing (or not able to be read for those who don't understand Cantonese).  I suggest you wait for a better version of the movie on DVD unless you absolutely must have it.",1027987200,3,728,4.443609022556391
