6355978,4,B00JESQRS8,"The movie kept my interest to the very end.  For a small production movie, I thought it was done very well.",1399248000,,107,4.095238095238095
6355979,5,B00JESQRS8,"""Favor"" takes you into a dark place and lets you simmer with the ultimate question: ""What would you do?"". Favor opens with Kip (portrayed by Blayne Weaver) in a potentially sticky situation and turns to the only person he believes he can trust - childhood friend Marvin (Patrick Day). However, a lot has happened over the years to both men and their positions in life are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Kip realizes his childhood trust in Marvin is only a dream from the past and things begin to break bad for both of them. Twists and turns keep you on edge, and director/writer Paul Osborne shows no mercy. People change when favors are exchanged, sometimes with nasty results. Check this movie out if you like a good thriller that keeps you guessing - you won't be disappointed. It will definitely make you consider a little more the next time you need to ask a friend for a favor.",1398816000,17,886,4.54375
6355980,3,B00JESQRS8,"This plot contrivance has been done many times already, with movies like The Cable Guy and What About Bob?, so even with the unique twist this one seems like a repeat. Also the production values are seriously lacking. So...good, but not great.",1398729600,,243,4.809523809523809
6355981,4,B00JESQRS8,"Well, I guess is pretty cool, realistic maybe, and expected to write really bad language into a movie -- but what Hollywood doesn't seem to get is that it is simply unnecessary.  After my wife an I watched this movie I wanted to watch it again with my mom because she likes a great twisting plot -- but the language used in it would have made both of us -- along with other family members who would have been present, offended and uncomfortable.  That is so sad since the movie was a good watch otherwise.  I am no prude -- just sayin' the language was not necessary and the movie could have been more appealing to more people without it.",1398643200,,638,4.3
6355982,5,B00JESQRS8,"Wow. Best movie I've seen in far too long. It's good to find that there are still good films being made, not just sequels and reboots.

6355986,4,B00JESQRS8,"It is a low budget flick but spending more money on it probably wouldnt have added much. The plot was a tidy little thriller and there were some surprises to keep you interested. Mixed reviews on this one but I thought it worked and, unlike the cover art, no sofas were moved. Kip is a real jerk and you cant really feel too bad for what happens to him but the synopsis of the movie that states  the waitress with whom he's having a casual fling is accidentally killed in their motel room is misleading but watch the movie to see why.",1495929600,,534,4.235294117647059

6356005,5,B00JESQRS8,"Favor is one of those rare low budget films that will restore your faith in unknown actors, writers and directors. Both the script and plot were believable, and the actors were hardly amateurish, as they didn't appear to be reading from cue cards. Perhaps my favorite aspect of this thriller is it's unpredictability. At first, the viewer is purposely led down a somewhat predictable path, only to be stunned by a sudden dark and unexpected twist, the sort of taboo surprise that is common in European films but is rarely seen in American cinema. Favor is proof that more can be done with less, but most importantly it proves there is so much undiscovered talent in Hollywood.",1480291200,,676,4.786324786324786

6356012,3,B00JESQRS8,"It's ok, probably a solid 3 stars. Not really deep, weighty, or exciting enough to be a go-to thriller, largely due to the narcissistic mostly unlikeable characters in unbelievable situations.

6356032,5,B00JESQRS8,"I have not seen a movie so perfect in quite some time. The director and actors and everyone else involved in the making of this film deserve a 5 star credit IMO. The acting by all the actors in this movie is outstanding particularly by the two lead male characters. The plot is quite simple but involves meticulous, complex and unexpected human emotions and reactions that are superbly performed by all the actors. I started watching this movie with low expectations because I did not know any of the actors but I am now wondering why these superb actors are not more famous. It seems odd that there are so many fat cats in Hollywood who barely know how to perform and yet these talented individuals are ignored. Anyway, the movie is worth watching every bit of it. Despite the theme of the movie centering around death, most of the dialogue in the movie is somewhat funny and entertaining in a dark sense. It is the dialog between the two former classmate friends, now turned into a high-achiever professional and an unemployed low-achiever, that becomes philosophically interesting.",1478304000,2,1084,4.802139037433155

They didn't spend a lot on special effects or props, but the acting was great and the story believable.  Each plot twist kept me interested to see what was going to happen next.

I felt the two male leads did admiral acting jobs and showed a depth of character that was more than one dimensional. There were some twists and turns that demonstrated that the screenwriter used some thought and cleverness in developing the plot. Overall, it was a decent flick. I would suggest hiding the remote for the first 30 minutes. I think if you do that, you'll not have felt you wasted 90 minutes of your time by watching from start to finish.",1476144000,2,597,4.4363636363636365

Perhaps with a bigger budget the lighting and camera work could have been better; however, the dialogue was well written and the lines were executed flawlessly. Although you will know what is coming most of the time it will still take your breath away and perhaps shock you at the veracity to which the actors and actresses deliver.",1436486400,,451,4.580246913580247
6356200,4,B00JESQRS8,"It was a good movie, but Amazon's streaming leaves much to be desired.  The movie stopped at least 10 times and then would go back to the start.",1433721600,,144,4.142857142857143

6356203,4,B00JESQRS8,"Good stuff. Light in the beginning but then turns dark, perhaps a little darker than intended, insofar as the acting. But still, it's good enough to clear your brain of the day's fluff.",1412121600,,185,4.636363636363637
6356204,3,B00JESQRS8,"I was skeptical about renting this movie because you could tell from the preview that it was low-budget. To my surprise, I enjoyed it. It's not great and it drags a bit for about 10 minutes in the middle, but there are several unexpected events and the actors do a decent job. My only complaint is that there were a few times in Favor when I asked myself why the character did what he/she did. It just didn't make sense, but then I waited until the end and the actions fell into place. The only character I felt sorry for was the girlfriend. She really didn't deserve what happened to her.

The movie Favor won't win any awards but I have no regrets about spending the $3 to watch it.",1409270400,2,684,4.2615384615384615

6356208,5,B00JESQRS8,"Compelling and cerebral, a thinking man's mystery, that seduces by its unassuming setup only to throw obstacles in your path at its denouement.  And I was shaken by its conclusion.  The movie had me on after an early event that led me to question throughout the piece, ""Why do people do what they?  Why do they think the way they do?  The write/director, Paul Osborne, is covered in talent and while I would wish for a major studio to snap him up, I wouldn't want to see him beholden to some corporate type's idea of what good film-making's all about.  The actors' performances, unknowns all, were so engaging that there was no chance to mistake the glamour of a famous star submerged in a role that he never assumes.  These actors made us feel the everyman quality of the script, that these events could happen to any of us. Do yourselves a ""favor"" and see this thriller now.  The irony will hold you long after the credits roll.",1406851200,2,930,4.5

6356214,5,B00JESQRS8,"For me, a movie is all about story and acting.  I'm sick to death of brainless, blockbuster CGI-heavy garbage where absolutely no thought was given to just telling a good yarn, and maybe making it engaging by focusing on character and the human element.

FAVOR is a stripped-down thriller, bare and simple and terrific.  It's everything movies should be and aren't.  It kept me glued to the screen and the twists knocked me off my seat.  I checked this out as a rental on iTunes and have been waiting patiently for the DVD, which is now coming.  Can't wait!!",1402531200,11,558,4.585858585858586
6356215,5,B00JESQRS8,"This is a better movie than I expected. Not exactly the action film I'm use to. I would put it in the category of personal relationships and lessons to be learned. One childhood friend ask the other for a BIG favor and once done, never hears the end of it. It also reveals the friends true characters as the movie unfolds. I thought it was a good movie because I did not anticpate all the turns in the plot that took place. Usually, you know what comes next in some of these bad movies. Kudos to the actor who played the character of Marvin - he was great.

So, if you are looking for a good plot and story, watch this one. My only negative was that it cost $3.99. $2.99 would have been better.",1402272000,7,694,4.140740740740741

I will not give away any of the plot, except to say that it surprised me. Very good movie, great plot and as I said earlier the actors are great. I don't think you should overlook this one.",1401753600,11,315,4.266666666666667
6356218,4,B00JESQRS8,"Kip (Blayne Weaver) has it all: A beautiful wife (Cheryl Nichols), a nice house (except for painted cinder block walls), a great job, a beautiful mistress (Rosalie Ward) and a friend Marvin (Patrick Day) who helps him bury dead bodies. Of course being out of work, Marvin performs the dirty deed. Marvin has a very nice collection of recently emptied green beer bottles decorating his home. He requires favors in return from Kip that escalate.

This is a simple quirky low budget film with some uncomfortable settings and a nice twist of events. Acting and direction was decent. Limited flashbacks done well, i.e. you knew they were flashbacks and they served a purpose. Good pick for ""Indie Night.""

If you like this film, you might also like ""Meeting Evil"" which has a higher intensity factor.

6356219,5,B00JESQRS8,"Well done, a thought- provoking movie, the acting is excellent, with a strong storyline. The show has a nice buildup and catches and keeps your interest throughout the show - actually as with most good movies your interest increases as the show develops and builds to the final frame.",1399420800,,284,4.816326530612245
6356220,2,B00JESQRS8,"Yes, the poster is very funny. I thought I was going to see a comedy. Turns out the movie is darker. What's wrong with the film? Nothing major. However, it's better suited for a television movie. The story is not dark enough, until it's too late. What transpires towards the end was needed at the beginning to make the film more intense and immediate. Instead, we get lots of pointless bickering among the characters. There was potential, though. What if the story revolved around Marvin figuring out what really happened in the bedroom between Kipp and his mistress? Was Kipp a victim of circumstance or maniacal from the get go. The twist ending points to the ladder, but isn't believable because it's not true to the characters. Overall, I have to give credit to the writers, directors, actors, etc., the movie is a good first attempt. Their next project will be better.",1399248000,3,873,4.75
6356221,4,B00JESQRS8,"This was an entertaining film, with an original and reasonably believable plot.

8650333,4,B00JESQRS8,"Its almost impossible to review this movie in any depth without spoilers. But I'll give it a shot. For instance: if you've ever suffered through the experience of having a clingy, selfish, psychopath friend who is a habitual line-stepper and requires you to solve their problems and make them happy, this movie will give you awful flashbacks. There are parts that are hard to watch because of that. And the writer doesn't give you anyone to empathize with: pretty much all the main characters have serious flaws. However it does make you think in terms of bad and good, and how 90% of everything anyone does is some shade of gray. Its fairly obvious that this film was made on a budget, but for the most part the acting is well done and cinematography sufficient to help you suspend disbelief for and hour 42. The writing really stands out. An original idea that could easily happen in real life. For that matter, it probably has...",1502668800,2,932,4.654545454545454
