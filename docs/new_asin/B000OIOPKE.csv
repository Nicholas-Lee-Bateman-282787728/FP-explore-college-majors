8185452,2,B000OIOPKE,"PREY OF THE JAGUAR (1996) is a rather silly straight-to-video martial arts film that stars Maxwell Caulfield as a former secret agent who, to revenge the murders of his wife and son, learns Kung Fu from an old master, after which he dons a strange superhero uniform that resembles the gear football players wear under their uniforms, and becomes...the JAGUAR!

If you've ever seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GETTYSBURG/dp/B00003CXA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GETTYSBURG</a>&nbsp;(1993), Caulfield has a minor role as Col. Strong Vincent. He appears twice during the Second Day: initially to tell Col. Joshua Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) that his Maine regiment is the end of the Union line so they must hold their position ""to the last,"" then later after an heroic stand against several Reb assaults to congratulate Chamberlain and inform him that the 2nd Maine has been reassigned to a new position, ""safest place on the battlefield, smack dab in the middle,"" where ironically these exhausted and bloodied survivors, will, on the Third (and final) Day, help repulse Pickett's Charge.

As for ""Jaguar,"" the less said, the better.
It currently has a well-deserved 3/6 out of 10 rating at IMDb.
A real stinker that gave both Stacy Keach and Linda Blair a chance at a paycheck.",1427846400,,1321,5.534653465346534
8185453,2,B000OIOPKE,"Why? This is a movie from the 90's so I didn't expect too much, but come on, it could have been a little better. the plot, such as it is...ex-agent who put away a bad guy and is living under the witness protection program finds out that the bad guy got away but is told you are in no danger and the bad guy kills his family and thinks they killed him. Overdone plat, but in some other films done so much better. here we have Maxwell Caulfield (Grease 2) with a 70's pornstar mustache (why?) he trains to go after the bad guys with a Chinese sensei (why?) he takes on the persona of his son's imaginary hero, jaguar (why?) Bad acting, bad fight scenes, bad plot, bad dialog, bad locations (the prison? is a warehouse?) really, just terribly bad. $5.00 I could have done better. the rest of the cast all awful, everyone. Why 2 stars you may ask? Maxwell Caulfield and Jason Leigh (I think) have great bods. BTW Linda Blair is in this too. No wonder she had no career!",1396137600,,965,4.25
8185454,2,B000OIOPKE,"To look at this one's DVD cover and to know the reputation of director David DeCoteau (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creepozoids/dp/B0000B1OCP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creepozoids</a>), you might think you're about to see a B-grade sci-fi flick involving a half-man/half-jaguar. As it turns out, the creature in the art is entirely metaphorical, because this is an action outing about al superhero calling himself the Jaguar. If that doesn't sound very interesting to you, it's because the film isn't either, thanks to a lackluster story, some questionable production decisions, and mediocre action scenes.

The story: When the family of ex-CIA agent Derek Leigh (Max Caulfield,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grease-2/dp/B00008Z45B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grease 2</a>) is murdered by an escaped drug dealer (Trevor Goddard,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>) and he himself is left for dead, he trains himself to become a vigilante capable of taking down the villain.

The Jaguar is inspired by Derek's son (Devon Michael), who drew him on paper before being killed - that's a neat touch. However, everything else about the guy is forgettable. Supposedly he's a ninja-esque master of stealth, but only because the henchmen in this movie are blind and deaf morons. He's also supposed to be a martial arts master, but few of the fights are worth watching (more on that later). Worst of all, he looks like a tool in his superhero outfit, right up to his bangs stylishly protruding over his headband. Max Caulfield has led action movies before, but this is the first that tries to make him into a legitimate action hero, and it just doesn't work. Superhero flicks are supposed to be filled with cool stuff, but ""Prey of the Jaguar"" is too down-to-earth and limited to even think about competing against any other superhero movie, save perhaps Albert Pyun's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-America/dp/B005E7SF7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain America</a>.

Failing as a superhero movie doesn't mean this one also has to fail as an action flick, but it does that also. The adrenaline scenes are limited to a couple shootouts and nine fistfights, the latter of which are as awkward as can be expected for karate brawls featuring a non-martial artist. The fighting cast also includes Steven Leigh (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring-of-Fire/dp/B000094FE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring of Fire</a>), whose fight with Caulfield is probably the best in the picture but that's not saying much. Drama-wise, the output is inoffensive but limited. Caulfield is unremarkable, and while the late Trevor Goddard tended to be one of the most enjoyable action regulars, he doesn't get to do much after the film's first act. Stacy Keach (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Legacy/dp/B005LAIIPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Legacy</a>) and Linda Blair (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcist/dp/B0000524CY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcist</a>) appear in supporting roles but don't have any strong dramatic scenes.

""Jaguar"" is neither downright awful nor particularly boring, as it maintains relative enthusiasm and a good pace, but making a case for anything higher than a two-star score is beyond me. Were it not for its R rating, I might recommend this one to younger viewers who can build on their superhero experience, but as is, I can't think of too many folks who'd genuinely enjoy this one. Watch out.",1364169600,,3795,6.464566929133858
8185455,2,B000OIOPKE,"This movie is really nothing more than Saturday morning kids' fare, except it is rated R by the MPAA. Therein lies the irony.  The sophistication level of the movie is pretty low, stuff kids would believe in.  Yet some of the scenes are violent and a bit too gruesome for children to watch.  That doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy some aspects of this movie.  The scene where our hero practices katas with his martial arts master in the dojo are moments of poetry in motion. And the opening scenes of our hero with his wife and son are nicely portrayed.  But with such mixed temperaments  this movie is left wanting for a real audience. As one other reviewer stated, Prey Of The Jaguar begs for a remake.

I purchased this movie because it is directed by David DeCoteau, who is mostly known for his ""C"" grade horror movies.  I was surprised at how much better this movie is directed compared with his Full Moon Production films.  It's probably because someone else was writing and producing.",1267401600,,990,4.579545454545454
8185456,4,B000OIOPKE,"I like B movies, superhero movies and revenge movies, so when I find a B movie superhero revenge flick, well that's some of the sweetest cream of all.

  Derek Leigh is an undercover agent for the SOC, an agency so Top Secret that we never clearly learn what the acronym SOC means. He puts away the son of a huge drug lord, Bandera, and then drops into the Witness Relocation Program so that the drug lord can't get revenge on him.

  The movie starts 8 years later. Bandera is locked up in a Federal pen, which is remarkably short of both federal employees and prisoners. I knew something was up with this movie when Bandera steps out of his cot wearing leopard skin print underwear. I know there is a prison in the Southwest where the warden makes the prisoners wear bright pink skivvies in order to make their stay less pleasant and them, therefore, less likely to return. But I don't know what kind of prison issues leopard skin underwear and I'm not sure I want to know.

  Anyhow, Bandera's cartel breaks him out while the prison is transferring him to another facility. The cartel is well funded and organized and they manage to pull off the break out easily, although not without employing some inept martial arts. It was the same style martial art practiced by Gil Gerard and William Shatner and other middle-aged action heroes, a style with a name like Creaky Mantis or Winded Monkey. Luckily they were so inept they were funny.

  Of course Bandera ices our hero's family and although that bit of violence happens off camera, we are there when he discovers their bodies and let me tell you he emits a ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!"" that would put Darth Vader to shame. Bandera tries to ice Derek at his job site (He's a roofer! Thanks alot Witness Protection Program!!!) But the metal wine flask he carries in his pocket saves Derek. ""Whatever the vintage"" says the cop who finds his unconscious body, this wine saved his life"".

  That cop is played by none other than Linda Blair. I have to warn you though that this is not the sultry, pouty, ""I don't care if she's possessed because I would pork the devil out of her"" Linda Blair from the woman in prison movies. This is the late 90's Edie McClurg in training Linda Blair.

  She and her partner, a detective who looks like a statue of Dennis Franz sculpted from  cottage cheese, end up trying to track Derek down once he becomes Jaguar.

  Now this is an interesting little angle. Derek's kid loved superheroes and he created his own little comic books. His favorite creation was Jaguar, a man who made his body and mind strong so he could fight crime. Derek patterns his crime fighting costume very closely after the costume his kid had designed, in order to honor his son. Wow, that's different, and probably the most interesting angle in the entire movie. Unfortunately the design of the costume doesn't work very well on film as Jaguar looks like one of the Village People of the Future come back through a wormhole in time.

  I won't spoil the rest of the movie for you except to say Jaguar's revenge involves the liberal use of explosive tipped crossbow bolts.

  This movie wanted to be Batman meets Out for Justice but didn't quite achieve that awesome synthesis. It's still a fun movie though. Ragging on it is part of the fun. It's the kind of movie you find likable just because of the energy and fun it brings, but it's also fun to pick a little at its shortcomings.  If you're up for a solid B movie, it's worth the watch and then some. Give it a go.",1227484800,5,3520,4.516587677725118
8185457,3,B000OIOPKE,"""Prey of the Jaguar"" is a revenge/vigilante movie. Cop Derek Leigh's wife and kid are murdered by a drug lord who escaped from prison. He seeks out his old friend, a martial arts teacher, and trains to become ""The Jaguar"", to avenge their deaths.

The movie suffers from a low budget. But the low production values are redeemed by an entertaining script. The movie never gets boring (although they could have shortened the flashback sequences) and it has some good, fun action. Recommended to fans of low budget action movies and vigilante movies.",1210550400,2,547,4.881720430107527
8185458,3,B000OIOPKE,"One could be too rich on imagination to see nudity in this movie mixing Batman-style heroism with the South-Bronx-flick-style street-fighting. However, camera perpetually catches groins' profiles of practically all characters involved.

This film is an adult-oriented kid-story-tale of a builder - police associate taking revenge over by him dismantled mafia having killed his family in vendetta.",1191456000,4,396,6.071428571428571
