7968550,5,B00006G8EP,"Sailor Moon R is my favorite season

In the first 13 episode of the season, during the Doom Tree part of the season, I enjoyed the story most of all. I found the relationship, the love square, going on between Serena, Darian, Alan, and Anne to be amazing. I had never seen anything like it before in my life, mostly because I was young when it started. It was probably what made me think Love Triangles and Love Squares where a great idea for writing in my own future.

The second half of the season was great but it had several episodes that I found unappealing because the story line of those episodes was lame. Still, over all, the whole season was amazing, the entire story lines, both of them, for start to end were great. The Crystal Tokyo part of the story was amazing to.

I would suggest that everyone watch this season.",1372550400,,829,4.37012987012987
