8241257,4,B0011B9VZW,"The World Combat League was a kickboxing organization founded by Chuck Norris - his first attempt to do so in almost three decades. While I don't know exactly how it fared afterwards, its opening season is an exciting spectacle. It's easy to imagine how more traditional fans of the sport may be dissatisfied with Norris' flashy take on it, but as a casual viewer, I'm largely pleased. The program isn't always consistent, but for the most part, it's a good set.

The WCL hosts a tournament-based competition in which nine teams of six - five men, one woman - battle in a unique ring and under unique rules for the ""Turf Wars"" championship. The ring is a spherical structure without ropes or walls, 27 feet in diameter with an inclined border. The rules are basically those of K-1 with some modifications: (1) bouts comprise single three-minute rounds, (2) kicks below the knee are not allowed, and (3) passivity is penalized, necessitating the fighters to remain active at all times.

That last rule is what's most likely to ruin the concept for some viewers. I'd sooner liken this to a game of air hockey than a chess match. The frequent penalties for passivity in the earlier matches made me shout ""Just GIVE them a sec!"" Nevertheless, I think the fast-paced style may be just what it takes to win over newcomers. There's always something going on in the ring, and furious exchanges are a given. The need to keep fighting is also less detrimental to the fighters than one would think, as the majority of them adapt to the rules and channel the time pressure into explosive combinations.

The size of the ring also facilitates this. The wide, circular structure allows for unprecedented mobility and some fighters use this to their advantage. Contenders like Raymond Daniels use their agility to put distance between themselves and their opponent before firing off some surprisingly flashy moves. Also, the space and aversion to passivity allows the competitors to challenge some general preconceptions about the effectiveness of certain fighting styles: everyone is technically a kickboxer, but for example, fighters utilizing a sport karate approach are able to topple muay thai practitioners or Golden Gloves boxers by making their opponents chase them and maneuvering around their power techniques. In a special feature, Norris claims this creates a realistic fighting environment, and while I think such a statement is contentious, it nonetheless make the fights a lot less predictable.

Speaking of Norris, he's somewhat conspicuous by his lack of involvement. He appears in the special feature and can be seen in the crowd during several events, but he never makes a substantial appearance during the shows. I thought he'd at least open the first event or award medals to the victors, but nope - he's mostly just a face on the DVD. More visible (or at least audible) are movie stars Richard Norton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Nice-Guy/dp/078062260X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Nice Guy</a>) and Don Wilson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist/dp/630582469X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist</a>&nbsp;series), who provide guest commentary for many of the events. The fighters themselves are mostly a mix of experienced competitors from karate and kickboxing, but probably won't be recognizable for fans outside of those sectors.

The production quality of the show fluctuates throughout the three discs, but this is a minor annoyance. With fewer blowout victories than expected and a huge variety of fighters, this season's very satisfying. If more complete seasons of the WCL were available, I'd buy `em.",1388707200,,3709,5.4100346020761245
8241258,4,B0011B9VZW,"I am not sure if it still exits but it was a novel idea pitting the nation's best stand up fighters and strikers against one another. If you are not famillar with the World Combat Leauge it had a unique set of rules for any combat sport. It is Kickboxing on a team sport. Five men and one woman would compete as a team and the men would all fight out of a different weight class. They also would have alternates for each weight class in case some one would get injured or knocked out in the first round of the competition. Each competition would start with all 6 fighters fighting a 3 minute round. They would have a coin toss at the start and the coach who won the coin toss would select wich weight class would fight first. To insure an action packed fight they gave immediate point deductions for clinching, or Backpeddling unless you were throwing punches and kicks as you backed up. Also if you stopped or knocked your opponent out you would receive more points for your team than by winning a decision. Every one would fight one round and then there was a half time like in football. After half time every one would fight a second round. The team with the most points won of course. This is there highlight reel where you get to see alot of knockouts by punches and kicks. These guys and gals are amazing athletes as they can punch and kick there opponents with great skill and gritt. Also they do not fight in a ring, they fight in a padded pitt that changes elevation on the outside edges to make it more interesting. Many Major American citys had a team like Miami,Philladephia,L.A.,New york,Houston,Las vegas, and Houston. This is an entertaining watch for any fan of combat sports.",1343001600,,1692,4.461290322580645
8241259,4,B0011B9VZW,"First half was not that great,rules didn't seem to work the way they wanted. Last half,with rule changes(being able to grab and knee)really had a big impact on how the fights flowed. Overall great concept and am looking forward to season 2",1208649600,,239,4.714285714285714
8241260,5,B0011B9VZW,"If you are a fan of kickboxing, then you might find the World Combat League enjoyable.  This is certainly different than K-1 or Muy Thai fights, but if you like the ruleset then you'll love the action.

To be sure, the first season of the WCL started a little rough around the edges.  There was no logo in the ring.  There were a lot of silly and confusing rules.  And the fighters seemingly wore way too many pads to be effective. However, during the course of the season, they really improved the league by modifying some of the rules and polishing up the stage and TV presence. By the championship series, they had ditched the footpads, allowed leg kicks and limited holding, and we were cheering for our favorite teams/fighters.  Everyone was just waiting to see who would get knocked out next.

And speaking of knockouts, this league has a ton of them.  This is due to the fact that they only fight two 3-minute rounds, so the fighters really go all out each round. Those with boxing or kickboxing backgrounds seem to excel. There are probably two or three KOs per episode and as a result, the league has grown its very own stars.  Be sure to keep an eye out for Raymond ""The Real Deal"" Daniels, Tim ""Irish Pride"" Connors, Stephen ""Wonderboy"" Thompson, and Kevin ""The Hitman"" Engel among others for some spectacular fights.",1207094400,2,1328,4.593220338983051
8241261,4,B0011B9VZW,"I've enjoyed watching this as it played out last season, and this season they have fixed some of the quirks that were there. It's entertaining especially if you like the more traditional style of fighting. The knock out series that you can check out are great in this series.",1205625600,,275,4.63265306122449
8241262,3,B0011B9VZW,"As a big fan of mixed martial arts, I was pleased to see that Chuck Norris founded a league of his own.  Way back before he was nothing but Mike Huckabee's lapdog and a webpage of humorous facts about his abilities, Chuck was in fact a world champion fighter, and what better way to carry on his legacy than to pass on the torch?  However, this particular format is something I just really have trouble getting behind.

The World Combat League is initially compelling.  It's a team martial arts competition, similar to the IFL, except that it's striking arts only, much like Japan's K-1.  This means no clinching, no grappling, and no fighting on the ground.  Furthermore, the organization puts emphasis on ""fast-paced action"".  The rounds are very short, and the fighters are encouraged to push the action as much as possible.  This results in fights that feel way too rushed, and often turn out to be rather sloppy and uninteresting.  Now, I'm a big fan of grappling, so I am a bit disappointed that Chuck Norris, being a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt himself, has chosen to cut that aspect of fighting out of his organization just to try to make it more ""exciting"" to people who don't have the attention span for a ground fight.  This is why in the UFC these days you see fights getting stood back up a lot faster.  I just feel like Chuck is pandering to the lowest common denominator, and I'm not happy with it.  And hey, I love kickboxing and muay thai fighting too, but even compared to most other striking competitions, this feels like it's tailor-made for people with no attention span, and I for one don't like it.

3 stars because they are talented fighters, and some of the fights are interesting, sure, but this format just feels way too rushed for me.  I guess I just have a different idea of what makes for an exciting fight.  I just hope that third fist doesn't come out of Chuck's beard and knock me out for saying so...",1200182400,4,1937,4.525862068965517
