There is lots of great behind-the-scenes footage in this DVD and I really enjoyed watching it. I am a huuuge Randy Couture fan and it was awesome to see him in so many candid moments captured early in his career. I highly recommend this video for anyone who wants to get a feel for the true personality of our all-time favorite fighter, Captain America!!",1334102400,,463,4.590361445783133
8177458,4,B000NDY5KA,"This is not a DVD with a ton of tecniques. Randy and Iowa State wrestler turned-MMA coach, Rico Chiapparelli, demonstrate fundamental techniques and drills for combining striking with wrestling.

I enjoy the combination of instructional alternating with behind-the-scenes segments, Pre-Zuffa UFC fight highlights, training sessions and outakes. It keeps it interesting for me as both an MMA fan and practitioner. I get bored watching only techniques.

Like I mentioned this DVD has basic MMA drills combining wrestling & boxing that you'll need to drill with a partner. When I first watched the boxing, I thought, ""Oh no, way too basic."" but then Randy starts to add in the strikes off the clinch:

Shadow Boxing * Focus Mitts* Heavy Bag Drill * Wall Bag Drill
* Jab Cross Combo * Survival Drill * Slipping Punches * Collar Tie
* Heavy Hands * Under Hooks * Static Pummel Drill * Leg Takedowns
* Underhook Throw * Striking Flow Drill",1214092800,,933,4.929936305732484
8177459,2,B000NDY5KA,"If you are looking for an instructional DVD, this really is not it. There is about 5 minutes of actual techniques, the rest of it is just a bunch of dudes hanging out and other behind the scenes footage. On top of which its terribly shot! The cover art and packaging are the best things about this product! Sorry to say, but I feel ripped off! Hence the trouble I went to of writing this review. For value for your money get the Learn to Fight stuff, trust me.

 I am a huge Couture fan. It took me years of traditional martial art b.s. to get to the point where I could see the value of what a genius wrestler like Couture can add to your game. Wrestling is the bridge between striking and the ground, and being truly dominant in this phase will win fights in the ring or on the street. Also, for the jiu jitsu people, it is great to get a different perspective on the ground. Randy drew with Jacare in a submission match, so he's no slouch.

You just won't see all that on this DVD! Look elsewhere for instruction, Grasshopper...",1187740800,10,1031,4.25
