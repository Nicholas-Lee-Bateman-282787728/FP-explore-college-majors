Customer service went above and beyond!!
Your purchasing a product that has a company standing behind it, what more needs to be said....

Keep in mind theses movies were made back in the 30's so restored or not your getting the best :)
Thanks!",1367452800,,420,4.662162162162162

-This has 12 more episodes than most sets and is watchable.
-It appears all episodes are uncut, only missing the MGM lion.

Negatives -
-The set I bought is from GoZilla and they have their watermark halfway through some episodes, tried to return these discs but they refused to return any emails or calls.  I had to file a claim with my credit card, but they refused that too.  I never actually talk to any correspondent from the company.
-Gozilla Company also has an advertising commercial at the beginning before starting the 1st episode, which you can't shut off or fast forward.
-I compared the quality to others. The quality is good, but not great.
 The Cabin Fever set is truly uncut and the Genius Little Rascals Complete Collection set is truly  remastered
-The lines, hissing and pops are very annoying while watching.  It's like watching episodes on You Tube.  Don't  get me wrong 6 or 7 quality rating out of 10 is still good, but not great.
-This set is on single layered discs, the Complete Collection is on Dual layered discs for quality purposes.
-To tell the truth(as a kid), I use to love the MGM lion and that is missing from the beginning of these episodes.
-Appears to be bootleg if you ask my opinion, but who's asking, right?  The reasoning is I can only find this set online, the other 2 sets are or use to be in big name stores.  The labels appear to be that of a home production.  To tell the truth, I can make better labels from my printer and my son agreed.

I've decided to buy the 7 individual uncut Vivendi Entertainment discs(also sold in big name stores), which are the truly Uncut and Remastered original discs with the MGM lion which I found for the same price as this 92 episode set minus 12 episodes  like silent some silent episodes and some documentary.  But all the talkies from the early rascals are here and complete.  But hey I will take quality over quantity any day of the week when dealing with these old little rascals.  FYI they sell these discs individually so you can't buy them in the set.  Just so you know The Complete Collection set is different, it is great quality, but not all episodes are truly uncut like the Vivendi discs.",1352764800,11,2189,4.487373737373737
8456442,4,B00548JDJM,I was a little leary of ordering this because there were no reviews on the product.  But I took a leap and did.  I'm glad I did.  The videos got here sooner than expected and in good conditions.  The videos are just as we remembered.  We've made it through 2 of the 8 disks and everything is just perfect.,1329868800,6,305,4.101694915254237
