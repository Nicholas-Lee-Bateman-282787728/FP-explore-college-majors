209924,5,6300155919,"I saw this on Disney a while back. I wish I could have this tape.
It's about the flutter ponies home flutter valley losing the sun stone. They go through many trials and make new friends. The witches from the volcano of gloom cause just as much trouble.
If you want to know what happens I recommend you buy this tape.",1022716800,6,317,4.213114754098361
210004,5,6300155919,I remember when I was younger watching My Little Pony's all the time with my cousin. It was the highlight of our childhood. =),1362355200,,126,4.291666666666667
210005,5,6300155919,"The movie came brand new and arrived very fast, this was a great present to give to a child. Would buy again.",1344643200,,109,4.0
210006,3,6300155919,"Really. I grew up with My Little Pony and as I got older (and MLIP went off the air), I began to watch the Simpsons. I saw this on sale at Pamida and got it for my then 3 yr old daughter. There was SOMETHING about the voices that I couldn't quite put my finger on ... Gusty's voice is the same as Bart Simpsons, Cupcake is Martin Prince, Honeysuckle is Sherrie, Morning Glory is Terry. It is kind of eerie watching the student body from Springfield Elementary as pink ponies.

That being said, as an adult, a few parts are truly annoying (conversations between Morning Glory and Sting) and I had trouble sitting through. The only part that I really have a problem with as a parent is Megan playing Matador to distract an angry bull. We have livestock and we've spent the last several years ingraining our daughter with the message ""Don't go in the corral with bulls, stallions, rams or buck goats"" so I cringe every time I watch that part as non-farm kids think that they can play matador with dangerous intact bulls. But my daughter now age 5 loves it and I'm adding more MLP stuff to her collection.",1260316800,4,1101,4.397058823529412
210007,3,6300155919,"Did not live up to expectations, hard for an adult to sit through and watch, very dark, not my child's favorite.",1255910400,,112,4.380952380952381
210008,5,6300155919,"Childhood called and I answered. This movie was for a friend's daughter and she loved the ponies. The dancing, the spontaneous songs and learning patience, love, cooperation and family. It's a great movie and brought me back, way back. It's great to see movies like these out there that bring a positive message to children out there and bring the adults back to their childhoods, even if for awhile.",1245628800,3,400,4.811594202898551
210009,4,6300155919,This movie wasn't quite up to par vs. other My Little Pony Movies as far as the storyline went. Good quality as far as the picture and sound were concerned.,1242345600,,156,4.233333333333333
210010,4,6300155919,"THE DVD WAS IN GOOD SHAPE, UNOPENED,SCRATCH FREE.  MY GRANDDTR. IS ENJOYING IT VERY MUCH. IT'S A JOY TO BRING THESE SHOWS BACK TO LIFE FOR A YOUNGER GENERATION.",1156118400,,160,4.517241379310345
210011,1,6300155919,"We shut this show off within the 1st 10-15 minutes.  Wow.  First of all there are witches.  Then the ponies have pyramids with ""all-seeing"" eyes on them where they live.  Then they start a celebration where the sun shines through the clouds, shines on a jewel in the middle of the pyramids (kind of like a stonehenge ritual?), start singing a ""nature worship/loving"" song.  Then the head witch looks at pictures of her ancestors on the walls that are long since deceased and asks them to come back and help her, they started coming back to life and stepping out of their paintings.  This is where we shut it off and said NO MORE!",1153526400,4,629,4.473684210526316
210012,5,6300155919,"You can't beat My Little Pony.  It's pretty much the best series ever for little girls.  It is TRUE that this DVD is part of the Season 1 DVD, but if you are just looking for a good DVD to give to your two-six year old daughters, look no more!  This has everything - good vs. evil, singing, and magic.  The plot is GREAT for anyone with half a mind!  The Little Ponies have to rescue the Sunstone from Bumble (Who has stolen it from the Flutter Ponies) before Flutter Valley becomes a wasteland.  In their struggle to defeat the Witches the Ponies learn about friendship, loyalty, teamwork, and sharing.  They learn that good will always triumph over evil in the end.  The Ponies are bright and beautiful, and, unlike most children's TV programming today, My Little Pony won't treat your kids like they are mindless, weak, retarded zombies.

That said, if your kid seriously gets scared from watching My Little Pony there is a serious problem in the home.  I watched this series as young as two years old and had NO PROBLEMS whatsoever! That's the problem in America.  We are raising a generation of weak-ass wimps.  It's almost like Cobra Commander really did take over the TV stations (remember that episode of GI Joe people?).

If you want some ""Educational"" bull crap for your kids to watch, don't buy this DVD.  We wouldn't want them to grow up to be able to think.  If you want weak-ass kids, keep them tuned onto Nick Jr. or the Little Einsteins and don't even bother tainting the good name of My Little Pony.

If you want your kids to have creativity and imagination, (which, I might add, is what stimulates intelligence) then buy this DVD for your daughter and let her enjoy!  Not everything has to be educational, in fact, it's good for kids to just have fun and use their imagination! If you are a person who doesn't want your child to ever be exposed to anything ""evil"", just save your money.  Poor kid.

I'd bet ten to one that these negative reviews about ""OMG my daughter heard numb-skull!"" etc... are from Christians.  Good gracious people.

210063,4,6300155919,"The fact that adults are sitting around contemplating whether or not this video is fit for children is ridiculous. This video talks about playing with others, teamwork, and is a fun entertainment experience for children. If you are one of those that goes overboard on analyzing videos, this might not be for you. But if you love your children, and want them to enjoy themselves this is a good movie. If you are price concious though, you can buy the entire first season for a cheaper price.",1142467200,2,490,4.64367816091954
210064,1,6300155919,"Although I did buy this to entertain my 2 1/2 year-old daughter, I had to turn the movie off within the first 5 minutes. In that short amount of time, the word ""hate"" was said at least 3 times in addition to ""numb-skull"" and ""dumb."" Such name-calling and negativity should not be so prominent in a children's video.",1142380800,3,315,4.448275862068965
210065,1,6300155919,"I got spoiled with the original Midnight Castle and Escape from Catrina specials when I was a kid. The artwork, songs, voice work and creativity in those two far outshine ANY pony movie or TV show released to date.

This DVD was not worth the $10 I paid for it, frankly. The artwork and animation was horrible, and the plot was terrible. The whole idea of the bees just made me shake my head. And the witches reminded me of Gargamel from the Smurfs.

Even the new Minty Christmas... the ponies have lost some of their charm by making them really bubbly and annoying characters with twitchy habits and nothing much other than fluff and shiny happiness in their lives or average daily problems to solve.

What happened to the dragons? What happened to the castles (The traditional, non-balloony-goofy castles)? And hey, even good villains like The Darkness and his horned minion helps bolster a good show! He really caught my attention, and I LOVED the sequences where the captured ponies got transformed into black dragons. We moved from a Renaissance theme set for the original storyline to this kind of... muddled, weird new-age setting. The Renaissance setting was better. Why the heck don't you release the original Midnight Castle UNEDITED to include all the original songs, and then follow it up with a ""Return of the Darkness"" or ""Darkness Returns"" in the original style?? It could work. I'd probably like it a lot better than End of Flutter Valley.",1138233600,4,1455,4.812
210066,2,6300155919,"If you have the complete first season of the tv show, don't bother buying this because you already have it.

  Now, on to the review itself. I LOVE My Little Pony, no doubts there. However, I found this particular story kind of boring. It wasn't bad, it just felt out of place and was kind of silly. The original piolet special and ""Escape From Catrina"" were excellent, however I was really bored trying to watch this one. The witches were absolutely ridiculous and their voiceovers bothered me more than anything. The bees were stupid (sorry), especially the one they made to look kind of like a biker punk.

  Sorry, but My Little Pony has a lot better to offer out there. But if you really want it, get the first season, that way you have something to compensate it with.",1136592000,3,774,4.492857142857143
210067,2,6300155919,"Why on earth did they release a 'miniseries' on DVD that was already on the Season 1 box set?

While a great little show, it seems odd that they would rerelease a particular few episodes from the boxset as a new DVD...  and why this series vs, say, the two pilots/specials?

Anyways, please don't be fooled and buy this in addition to the Series One box set... you'll be buying a repeat.

How about releasing other Seasons on DVD?  Or the actual My Little Pony theatrical movie?",1136419200,7,478,4.448275862068965
210068,3,6300155919,"From the description, ""The End Of Flutter Valley,"" this is the ten-part ""movie"" that kicks off Season 1.

If you purchase the Season 1 box set, you get this movie, PLUS the rest of the Season 1 episodes and the two specials.

I don't understand why Rhino re-released this instead of the episodes from Season 2, which are NOT on DVD at all.

I would recommend that MLP fans buy the entire Season 1 box set instead of this.

Please Rhino, release MLP Season 2 and My Little Pony Tales on DVD.",1132185600,16,490,4.293478260869565
210069,4,6300155919,Im a My Little Pony fanatic from the 80s and was so excited when I saw this movie on DVD. After reading everyones reviews though I am now confused about wheather or not I should buy the first season of MLP or the End of Flutter Valley DVD--it sounds like everyone is saying that they are the exact same thing. Does the season one DVD have more content on it than the Flutter Valley DVD? There is a $35 price differance and I just want to know if the first season DVD is worth that differance.

This 'movie' is a series of several episodes from the MLP First Season. It features the Little Ponies trying to save Flutter Valley and the Sunstone from Hydia, Reeka and Draggle AND Bumble and her band of bees.

210072,3,6300155919,"Don't get me wrong, I am a huge My Little Pony Collector myself.  However, I will not be tricked into buying something that I've already bought.

For those of you, out there, who've purchased the Season 1 Dvd Box Set, you will have no need for this one.  I know for a fact that these episodes are on the first disc... I watched them with my nephew and niece.

Of course, I'm only going by what the description says on this one.  Queen Bumble and The Witches, sounds like the one dvd I've watched.  For those Collectors that must own everything... go ahead a get it.  I'm just letting you know that this is just a chunk sliced out of Season 1.",1123286400,53,642,4.213114754098361

7803251,5,6300155919,"Most of the complaints about this aren't about the story or characters, but about the fact that it is already on the Complete First Season box set... and yes, that is true. However, what the complaints don't mention is that the box set didn't see an extremely wide release. It's not something you can just go get at your local video store (if you still have a local video store; we sure don't in my area.) It's a collector's item that demands extreme prices. Don't take my word for it, look what it will cost you on this very site. Cheapest used one as of this writing? $169.40. (Plus 3.99 shipping.)

True, this isn't the only site you can find it on. Elsewhere I've looked, you can get your hands on it for a ""mere"" seventy bucks.

If you've got that kind of money to spend on cartoons, awesome. If like the other 99% of us, you're either a fan of the new series and want to see the first generation, or are a parent who wants to show the kids a cute cartoon, but *do not* happen to own a diamond mine or an oil well or three, here you've got the movie-length direct sequel to the theatrical film (no celebrity voice actors but same writing crew; if you liked MLP: The Movie, you'll like this every bit as much.) and you know what the best part is? *You will not have to sell any organs to get your hands on it.*",1404172800,,1314,4.189723320158103

However it was promptly shipped and their was no problem with the product. I was going to leave a review reflecting the epic disapointment my innerchild had just suffered because of an incorrect search engine descriptive appied to this movie. I had planned on watching a specific movie for my birthday and this mislabeling had fudged it. However When I read the feedback another person left in the 1 star section  left I was horrifed. Um .....you are crazy it is a cartoon movie about talking ponies.....lighten up. The responses though helped cheer me up in reaffirming that not all humans are crazy greedy nutbars. thank you. FYI the movie while entertaining and teaches a positive message, is not actually the MLP movie and made me on my 29th birthday cry like a 5 year old who didn't get the one thing she wanted for her birthday.",1367625600,,953,4.540697674418604
