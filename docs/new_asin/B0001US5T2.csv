2027097,5,B0001US5T2,"There has been so many dvds (8 IN ALL)released about 2pac since he was murdered on sept 7 1996 at 25yrs. His estate has released 8 albums & there is still more to come plus he stared in 6 movies while he was alive. This movie captivates you from start to finish, his eyes draw you in & make you feel like your going threw the struggle with him. His life was so short yet he achieved so much, with just another 6 months who knows how many more albums we would have coming out. This movie is filled with never before seen footage of pac on several talk shows where he does not hold back on anyone & you get to hear his side of what happend from his fights with police,rape allegations & of coarse biggie & puffy. AS you watch you come to realise that puffy is a fake man beyond words & that one day he will be exposed. AND songs like hitem up & about 20 others he made dissing puffy & biggie would be what anyone would do in his position who was shot 5 times. Ressurection is by far the best movie made about pac, his music sets the soundtrack perfectly as the story unfolds. At the end you are left with an empty feeling that all the jealousy of others was what finally brought him down(they wounder how i live with 5 shots, ni**az are hard to kill on my block). Pac never let up on his goal(to make us all aware white & black,what the governement & certain people in the world are fooling us & leaving us in vicious cirle of poverty & no hope) even after his death he still remains the best rapper of all time. Ressurection will be a classic for years, plus the dvd will have extra scenes & interviews. This movie is so enjoyable beacause there is no one else talking about him its all pac telling his story(some of the comments he makes leaves you woudering did he sit down & tell his story to a mic before he died so his legacy would live on. Im getting 2 copies when its released on june 15. Pacs lyrics will live on for ever. rest in peace pac & yak",1079395200,11,1953,4.0753246753246755
2027098,4,B0001US5T2,"While I am a very big fan of Tupac Shakur, I will present this review based on the movie itself and not ""what an AWESOME rapper"" I think he is or print my own half-baked theories on how he is really alive. I have noticed that pretty much every review has offered very little detail on the film. With the countless amount of DVD's and other product floating around, is there really a need for another movie based on the life of Tupac Shakur? Well, this movie does offer something that none of the others have before and that is narration by Shakur himself.
Courtesy of old audio interviews and soundbytes, Tupac tells the story of his life in a way that few others could. From his birth as the son of a Black Panther to his final days in Vegas, Pac goes into detail on it all. Though commentary on his fatal shooting is clearly actually that of his first shooting at a New York recording studio, there are still some very eerie moments here. He talks about his days on Death Row Records in the past tense even though he was there until the day he died, he predicts his own downfall many times, and speaks candidly on a number of subjects that will really surprise you. The inclusion of Shakur's music is another thing that helps seperate this from a lot of the other documentaries on his life. To be able to hear the man himself speak on some of his best and most controversial recordings while they play in the background makes a huge difference.
""Resurrection"" really plays like a companion piece to one of Pac's albums. It provides all of the visuals to go with the stories that Pac tells in his complex rhymes. It isn't just a story about rap music though. We're not spending exhausting moments of time in the studio or on concert. This isn't about Tupac the rapper. This movie much like the artist it depicts is bigger than just its contributions to the world of rap music. The film spends most of its time examining the man himself. Going into depth about the controversy surrounding him. It gives him the microphone and allows him to fire back at the hypocritical politicians and Black leaders who try to dismiss his music as ""gangsta rap"" without even attempting to listen to the message behind it. It allows him to speak in great detail about the real horrors of the ghetto. He talks about his experience in prison and how it nearly destroyed him inside. He give us his side of the story on his sexual assault conviction, his NY studio shooting, and the beef with Notorious B.I.G. and Puffy.
At times, ""Resurrection"" makes the mistake of pointing us away from things that don't show Shakur in the best of light. Well, it isn't exactly a ""fluff piece"" but there were some details that seem conviently absent. There is a moment where Pac talks proudly about being happy to work with Dr. Dre on Death Row but the movie never makes any mention of their falling out after Dre's departure from Death Row. Pac's feud with Biggie is the only one that actually gets covered while there were several others that at least deserved an honorable mention.
For those Pac fans who are still pondering whether this film is worth the price of admission given that you probably have seen or heard every interview and own every DVD, it is. Granted there were a handful of times where I recognized the source of the audio in his narration, it didn't ruin the film at all for me. Seeing this one movie makes all of those other Pac documentaries seem like a waste of money. Pac's story finally gets the respect and attention that it deserves.
""Resurrection"" is a very unique film that really educates the average fan on the history of its subject. This film would honestly be best suited for those who no little to nothing on Shakur but continue to dismiss him as some ""loud-mouthed thug"". Sadly, it is that very ignorance that will keep them from ever even giving the movie a chance. With this film, I think Afeni Shakur has done something that I feel she was never able to accomplish in releasing all those posthomous recordings and that is to paint a portrait of Pac that really fits him well. I don't like taking quotes from other reviews, I think Roger Ebert summed it up pretty well when he said ""Even if you don't intend to ever see a rap documentary but might have in it you to see one. This is it."" This film might not convert you into a Tupac Shakur loyalist but if nothing else, it will give you a better understanding of who he was and why so many young people of all races view him as such an important figure.",1069200000,105,4508,4.452237001209189
2027099,5,B0001US5T2,"I am a big Tupac Shakur fan. This movie is the best documentary of Tupac's life to date. Not only does this movie captures Tupac  ""Thug life"" persona, but it also lets the viewer see his sensitive and funny side. Grrrrrrrreat Movie!!!!!!

2027100,4,B0001US5T2,"For any people who are not fans of the rap genre, Tupac Shakur is dead, and this is movie with REAL footage about his tragic and heroic life! Now, you may seem a bit confused to as why, nearly 10 years after the rap legend's death, that they would just be releasing a film on it. It is a tribute to Tupac, a martyr and legend to the rap community. Tupac Ressurection features real footage of Tupac in his younger days all the way up until his brutal shooting, and I am very excited for the whole thing to come out in theaters. This seems like the thing that should be on Biography, not in the movie theater, but whatever the case is, I am finally glad that someone is recognizing this great person for everyting that he has done. For any 50 Cent, Eminem, or Snoop Dogg fans out there, Tupac is the man that gave them inspiration. He practically invented the gangsta rap genre along with the legendary producer Dr. Dre, producer of such albums as The Marshall Mathers LP and Get Rich or Die Tryin'. Not many people in the world have an appreciation for this man, but people like me do, and I hope the rest of the world will open their eyes to Tupac's story. Go see this film! I know it will be informative, and just because it is all real footage doesn't mean that it won't be enjoyable. 8 Mile is gonna be nothin' compared to this!",1067817600,11,1331,4.244094488188976

2027148,5,B0001US5T2,"Gospel truth, indeed.

  This is a man so beholden to the brilliance of his Black Panther upbringings that his music presents equal parts authority and rebellion the way a Christ figure could be considered in film or otherwise. This text is a surety in the world of rap that not only acts as an avatar for his experience but rap as a whole, the same way Elvis was the kick in the door for rock and roll already afforded for him by Little Richard and Chuck Berry. As someone who's primarily a rock fan, I have great respect for rap as black America's rock and roll. You heard me say that.
  The film's execution is the music equivalent of Game of Death, wherein we have an product holding a space for the twofold candor of what is left unfinished by death and what is finished by his friends. Pac certainly had them.

  I want to write an even more full review of this film eventually, but this is a clear example of a rockumentary that pushes itself without force into the realm of cinema greatness. I apologize if I am too laudatory, but such is the consequence of when you can tell this isn't Aaliyah's biopic.",1457049600,,1112,4.364077669902913

2027150,5,B0001US5T2,"I was always of the impression that Tupac Amaru Shakur had what was coming to him. I loved his music,  d lyrics and flow were unbelievable but I didn't see him as anything other than a  gangster.  Then one day I happened to come across his collection of poems titled the rose that grew from concrete.  It was probably one of the deepest book I ever read .  I'm not  ashamed to admit I cried. And therein changed my perception of this young man.  Like a crazed person,  I went in search of books, interviews and every material I could get about his life. I was enthralled by the sheer depth of this man whom everyone routinely referred to as a  thug. I'm in love with his mind. This movie is by far the best so far in encapsulating the pure essence of this intellectual giant. On the downside however,  it made me feel his loss so very profoundly.  He taught me d difference between a role model and a real model. I believe it was his time to go because sometimes it's better to die a legend than live long enough to become a villain.  I strongly believe he would have been a force for good if he had lived and would have definitely delved into politics cos he was a born charismatic leader. I wish he didn't have to die so young before maximizing his full potential. Unfortunately,  a candle that burns twice as fast never lasts twice as long.  I know he's in a  better place cos he hurt too much in this world . Rest in perfect peace Pac. Thanks for your music . You'll live forever through them",1450137600,,1496,4.236749116607774

2027234,5,B0001US5T2,"I just re-watched this last night and let me say, its still just as powerful as it was when I first viewed it. If all you know of Tupac Shakur is his time at Death Row Records, his sexual abuse case and his death under the specator of the East Coast/West Coast thing, then you need to peep this.

A lot of people don't know that was actually a trained actor from a very prestigious arts school in Baltimore, MD and not just some thug who got a part in a film because he was a rapper. Don't believe me? Then watch the film as he's shown with classmates such as Jada Pinkett-Smith (that's right, Will Smith's wife) and other stars that are big now. They also show him with established stars such as Jasmine Guy (Whitley Gilbert from A Different World), Mickie Rourke and even Madonna in her younger days.

Admittedly, I wasn't a huge 2PAC fan as I felt he was a bit overrated as a rapper (though he was FAR better than the crowd that we got now, especially Kanye West)! He was, however, an intelligent and (when he wanted to be) very articulate man. Not a bad actor either. That makes this even more tragic.

Just my opinion but he, in part, brought about his own death. While I have no doubt he was set up, a lot of choices he made towards the end of his life contributed to his early demise in my view.

It's always tragic when an artist with so much talent dies far too soon, and as intended Tupac's senseless murder casts a shadow over the entirety of Resurrection. That infamous last photograph of him looking back through the car window as he's leaving the Las Vegas casino moments before his fatal shooting should haunt anyone.

2027238,4,B0001US5T2,"In this documentary Tupac Shakur--gangsta rapper, movie star, rape convict, and murder victim--narrates the story of his own life and work. And what a work, with 36 million albums sold (most of them since his death in 1996 at the age of 25), and 150 songs still unrecorded. As I watched this film I moved through successive waves of fascination, even admiration, empathy, and then anger and revulsion. Born to a crack-addicted mom who was in prison when she was pregnant with Tupac, with no father around, Tupac insisted that he spoke for the many hopeless people he grew up with who were trapped in chronic unemployment, police brutality, hunger, poverty and racism. Just as the news media shocked viewers into the horrors of Vietnam with their gruesome images, so, Tupac insisted, he was only chronicling the ghetto ""war zone"" most Americans would otherwise never see: ""All my songs deal with the pain I experienced in childhood."" But you know you have big problems when your own community censures you, including the likes of Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and Dionne Warwick. With his trash-talking vulgarity, misogynist lyrics, and rage, Tupac made himself an easy target. In his better moments he admitted he was ""young and dumb."" In the end, you can only lament the self-destructive life and tragic death of an immensely talented artist.",1169596800,2,1340,4.986607142857143

2027240,5,B0001US5T2,"Tupac fan or not, this film will affect you by the end. It takes you on a deep mental trip through this man's life from beginning to end. Yet, unlike most music documentaries, Tupac narrates this film himself. Using hundreds of old interviews, both on film and also audio recordings. He tells his own story, his own way. The film starts off showing the journey of Tupac's Car through the Las Vegas streets the night he was shot to death. While you watch this a song is playing, one of the last songs he would ever do. It is so ironic because it is talking about what actually happend to him that night. ""Multiple gun shots fill the block, the fun stops. Nigga's call the cops... people shot, nobody stops. I wonder when the world stopped caring last night."" Tupac's mother Afenia, produced this film and put all her heart and soul into making it happen. God bless her for having the strength to do so. Tupac tells his story of growing up poor and without a father to lean on. Growing up in a community with more drugs on the streets than food on the table. You get to understand the man behind the music alot more. Tupac was like most of us, angel and devil rolled into one. In the public eye, Tupac was seen by many as a thug and a evil man but he was also the same man that recorded songs like ""Dear Mama, Keep Your Head Up and Brenda's Got A Baby."" These songs showed his emotional side and a real deep concern for the future of the youth. However, Tupac also got caught up in the angry, gangster life style of rap music once he became famous. He even admitts that in the film. ""I was immature and my ego was out of control. I did and said alot of stupid things I wish I could take back."" One of the most chilling scenes in the film was the first time Tupac got shot five times in New York at a recording studio in 1995. This is what started the East Coast/West Coast war in the rap music. The film inter-cuts perfectly the two stories of the shooting. Tupac's version of what happend and the Biggie Smalls/Puff Daddy version. No, they don't match up. Tupac went to the grave thinking they did set him up that night. Once you see this, it's up to you to decide for yourself. All in all, this is a fantastic documentay of a very talented music artist and brings it to you on a very human level.",1160265600,3,2296,4.220454545454546

2027262,4,B0001US5T2,"""Tupac: resurrection"" (2003) is a documentary that tells us about the life of Tupac Shakur, a rapper that became an icon, and that was murdered in Las Vegas in 1996, when he was only 25. I am far from being a fan of rap music, but I don't regret watching this documentary, as it is interesting and informative, the kind of film Tupac's fans will adore, and spectators that don't know about him will appreciate.

To start with, the director (Lauren Lazin) managed to get Tupac to speak from the grave, thanks to the careful edition of many interviews he gave during his lifetime. We get to know about his childhood, his relationship with his mother (a Black panther, and one of the producers of this documentary), and his beginnings as an artist. We are also allowed to hear his point of view about many issues, the kind of things he did to help his community, and the mistakes he made. Most importantly, we can hear his songs, the controversial music in which he expressed what he felt and who he was.

On the whole, I think that this documentary is outstanding. Notwithstanding the fact that it is subjective, it manages to entertain and inform at the same time. And even though you must not expect to know the whole truth about Tupac after watching ""Tupac: resurrection"", I'm confident you will have a pretty good idea of why we is remembered by so many even now. Highly recommended...

This is quite entertaining learning about Tupac's life from when he was a little boy up to when he died. A must own if your a Tupac fan. It's great with concerts and videos and the information about how he became a star etc. In the special features it has two full length music videos (Trapped and Brenda's Got A Baby), his first singles and other interviews by friends and family of Tupac like his mother and Snoop Dogg. It's amazing how they could make a full length documentary on Tupac's life with all the photos and interviews made before he died, I'm very impressed. Like I said a real movie on Tupac's life would be just sensational but Mr Shakur just wasn't alive long enough to provide us with that so we will just have to enjoy this.

2027264,5,B0001US5T2,"After watching ""Tupac Resurrection,"" I found myself with a much greater appreciation for 2Pac's music.  I was also amazed how 2Pac's many interviews and recordings were seemlessly pieced together to make it sound as if Tupac himself was narrating his own documentary.  Although it is a bit eerie at first listening to a dead man narrate his own life (and death), it is a much more involving and incredible experience with 2Pac's narration.

Tupac lived an amazing life, even if it was tragically cut short.  Tupac Resurrection, then, is a movie that can be appreciated even by people who are not fans of Tupac or rap in general.  I watched this movie with my brother, who is absolutely not a fan of rap at all, and even he enjoyed the movie.  It is just that 2Pac was such a charismatic, intelligent, and poetic man that he is just fascinating to listen to.  And, this movie is doubly fascinating listening to a man narrate his entire life, from birth to death.

If you are a fan of 2Pac, this is a must-have.  As I said before, after watching ""Tupac Resurrection"" I gained an even greater appreiciation of his music.  Even for those that aren't fans of Tupac or even rap in general, I highly recommend this movie because it is simply an intense story about a man that is birthed into this world with nothing, becomes rich from an intense dedication to his artistic medium, and then dies a tragic, early death.

The only thing I have left to do is quote Roger Ebert's review, because I really believe he hits the nail right on the head when he says, ""Let's assume you are a person who never intends to see a doc about rap music, but might have it in you to see one. This is the one.""  I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  Rap fans or not.  Tupac fans or not.",1149638400,,1765,4.424148606811145

It starts off when he was younger growing up and goes through all that he experienced through his far to short life . If you don't know anything about Pac or you don't know much about him this is the dvd you want to learn more about and the type of life that he lead .  He had almost different faces of him some people knew him as a gangster, some knew him as a poet, some thought he was to violen, some thought that he was no good , others saw him as a kind gentle caring man.  Whatever side you choose to belive in him is up to you you will see his many sides in this dvd. Me personally I believe that he had a little bit of everyone of these sides but was more good than evil.  This is a must and would probably be his best dvd to date.

2027268,4,B0001US5T2,"Tupac's Resurrection was all about choices to me. On one hand, you have this good looking , charming young man whose intellect could rival some of the most reknown scholars. On the other hand, you have a brash pawn who hung out with the wrong peeps, and trouble and denialibility clung to him like shadows. This is the most sincere and frank account of him and his life. From his intent to carry out a new way of ""thug-living"" to him getting carelessly caught up in ""groupie luv"" You can say what you want about Pac, but he was always about ""choices"" He said this himself. And to actually try to pinpoint one of the many sides of him as a whole, then you would not have an accurate definition of the man we know as Tupac Shakur. He was good, bad, indifferent. As I stated in an earlier review, he is an array of every emotion caught on film. I would recommend any Pac fan to invest in this dvd.",1135555200,4,894,4.233918128654971
2027269,5,B0001US5T2,"If you are looking for a Tupac DVD, this is where you should start, Resurrection is the most comprehensive look at all of Pac's life, from his childhood, until his fatal shooting.  Unlike other documentaries, this looks at his entire life and it is also endorsed by Afeni Shakur, which could be good or bad depending on how you look at it.  It is also entirely narrated by Tupac, splicing together interviews and bits of speech to create the voiceover.  I know some people object to this, however when you watch it the majority of the speech comes from about four or five seperate interviews, which they show large sections of, so he did say most of what is on here.

As you would expect with his mother on the project, it gives a fair and balanced account of Pac's life, concentrating perhaps a little more on his caring side rather than his thug persona.  Including interviews with childhood friends like Jada Pinkett, some of the main players at Death Row, and also footage from the infamous incident at the MGM, hours before his death, there is little left unturned.

For a quality overview of Pac's life, this is the DVD to get, my only minor complaint is the lack of music video extras, only Brenda's Got A Baby and Trapped are included as extras.  They could have included more, although perhaps Suge Knight had a say on his Death Row material.  Regardless, this is highly reccomended.",1133827200,3,1392,4.607287449392713

2027291,5,B0001US5T2,"This mesmerizing documentary about the late rap star Tupac Shakur makes clear what a talented performer and vibrant presence he was, even for audiences who don't listen to rap music and aren't quite sure which rap star/convicted felon/murder victim he was.

But it does more than that. It tells a deeply moving story of a gifted, thoughtful, and intelligent young man who has to cope with the challenges of poverty and then has to manage the even more complex challenges of success. And it deals forthrightly with the problems of race and class in America, from racism and police brutality to black on black crime, absent fathers, and the uneasy relationship between showbiz ""thug life"" and the real thing. At one point, he says, ""I really did believe that no black person would ever shoot me.""

The movie was produced by Shakur's mother and MTV, which provided access to broadcast footage, interviews, and outakes. That allows Shakur, eerily, to tell the story himself, even predicting his own violent death. He warns us that this will be a story of ""violence, redemption, and love,"" and that proves to be true.

Shakur's mother was one of the few women leaders of the Black Panthers. She went to prison when she was pregnant with him. He was deeply aware that he served time in prison before he was born. He also respected his mother's activism but felt that he did not get enough of her attention. ""I always felt she cared more about 'the people' than her people."" He missed having a strong male role model. ""You need a man to teach you to be a man.""

He cared for his community but hated being poor. He briefly dealt drugs, but even the local dealers urged him to follow his dream. He loved performing and was accepted at a school for the arts. By the time he was a teenager, he was working professionally. By the time he was 20, he was a successful recording artist.

He understood the irony when it was only after he became famous that he was picked up by the cops. A citation for jaywalking led to a confrontation that became a beating.

Meanwhile, he is stunned and humbled to find that his visibility has young people looking to him for leadership. He takes it seriously, and gives a lot of thought to what he wants to tell them. He helps develop a code of behavior for ""thugs"" that covers things like keeping civilians out of the line of fire in gang warfare and taking responsibility for children.

Shakur is clearly and refreshingly as free from any form of prejudice as it is possible to be, at least in his own relationships. He uses racist and sexist language in the songs he writes, but also writes about respecting women. He has enormous charm but is also a thoughtful young man who wants to understand the world better and he wants to make an important contribution. He admits his mistakes freely and he learns from them and moves on. Anyone who watches this movie will feel his loss and want to carry forward his dreams.

Parents should know that this movie includes a great deal of very bad language, including racist terms (with some discussion of when they are and are not racist). Characters use drugs, drink, and smoke, and the ravages of drug addiction are frankly described. Characters engage in violent behavior and sexual abuse, including assault and shooting, and some go to jail. Shakur and other characters are shot and murdered. There are candid discussions of police brutality and racism. All of these issues and the consequences are presented in a realistic way that parents may find more suitable for teenagers than the usual shoot-out and explosion movie.",1132444800,,3591,4.67987321711569

2027296,5,B0001US5T2,"I saw Tupac Shakur perform early in his career with the Digital Underground in 1990. I respected some of his work and his apparently sincere concern for the segment of poor Black America that was either ignored, shunned, or exploited. In spite of that, I do not consider myself a fan, despised much of his later antics, and am not in favor of holding him up as an icon. In spite of all that, I loved this DVD.

This DVD makes no attempt to either glorify him or demonize him. It shows you as he was-period. You see his heartfelt concerns about the ghettoes of America, his family, and of poor and disfranchised people in general, as well as his more intelligent statements and lyrics. On the other hand, you see the foolishness and self-destructive behavior, especially the unecessary, deadly feud with Biggie Smalls (which, to Biggie's credit, he tried not ot respond in kind), foolishly linking up with criminals like Suge Knight (it should be noted that Tupac never had an arrest record until after he appeared on phonograph records), etc.

Some really intriguing moments include a couple of speeches in front of civil rights groups. He is filled with wild profanity (""They say they want me to watch my language-F___ THAT!""), but he really makes some good points about how the civil rights establishment then (and now) does not relate to the poor black youth of the present and has nothing but scorn for them. At first, you respond with a ""this is so embrarrassing"" squirm, but as you really listen to him past the wild cursing, you see that he is being heartfelt and honest about what he is saying (""Don't get mad at us! The only mfers who taught us anything were the pimps and the dope dealers!"").

In essence, you get both sides of the shakur story. Revolutionary? Truth teller? or Glorified jackass? This DVD basically says-YOU decide!",1119225600,5,1842,4.696594427244582

Tupac Amaru Shakur is my favorite and in my mind the best rapper of all time so when this came out I went out and got it right away.  The special features that come with the DVD are definitely worth watching, it's very interesting.  You can watch two of his old school videos ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" and ""Trapped"" off of his ""2Pacalypse Now"" album from '91.  You get to see a never before seen interview with 2Pac which was not shown in '92 because he got arrested.  You get an exclusive interview from his incarcerated stepfather Mutula Skakur from prison and also get to hear other rappers talk about Mr. Shakur and where they were when he died, etc.

The documentary itself almosts runs about 2 hours so you got to know that it's jam packed with information and stuff about his life.  It starts off when he got shot and then Tupac says some things and then says ""This is my story"" and then it starts talking about his roots before he was even born.  It goes into a lot of detail about his mother and black panthers and what they went through when they were around.  It talks about his life when he lived in New York, Baltimore, and finally California where you all know he started his real rapping career.  I'm not going to give away any more so you're going to have to watch it if you want to know what happens.

Im just telling yall because when i went to c it in the theaters halfway through most people left cuz they were expecting some ganga a** movie with Tupac in it.

Personally I really liked this.  I would recommend it not only to the fans of Tupac but also to his enemies and to the people who don't agree with his lyrical content.  I would recommend it to them because they should take the time to see what Tupac was really bout.  I ain't saying that after you watch this you'll become an expert at his life but it's a pretty good summary.  His voice addition made everything stand out more.  It was great.  Some people think that we should stop commin out with sh** about him because he is dead but that don't mean nothing.

He wasn't just a regular rapper.  His raps stood for smth.  Not like many of the rappers today who just rap about getting high and drunk.  I mean that ain't bad but com'on they should be rappin about some real s***.

Tupacs raps will never be matched.  His words will never be forgotten.  Everytime i hear lyrics on the radio or anywhere in real life it just hits me like ""Damn thas Tupacs words""

You can't do that just with any ol'rapper.

His lyrics stood for smth important and in whatever mood i am they will always help me out.

This DVD is real good.  He has a lot of stuff out but everything is diverse and so is this.  You don't got to buy it you just got to watch it.  This reviews up in here trying to sell DVD's and s***.  All you need to do is watch it once and his words will get embalmed in you head.

The film begins with him commenting on his own murder, then tracing back over the events of his life as a means of both setting the record straight and trying to make some sense out of all that happened to him in his very brief time here on earth.

The film, directed by Lauren Lazin, relies primarily on interviews Tupac gave throughout his short career, supplemented with some additional commentary from those who knew him best.  Though he became a lightning rod of controversy due to both his criminal activities and his provocative (i.e. violent, sexist) lyrics, Tupac saw himself more as a ""voice of the people,"" using his music as a vehicle for reaching out to and connecting with the downtrodden, impoverished blacks living in the kinds of ghettoes from which he himself sprang.  However, even many well-known black leaders and spokespersons had trouble accepting Tupac's rather rose-colored definition of himself.  What's most interesting about ""Tupac: Resurrection"" is the dichotomy it establishes between the violence, drug use and criminal activities which played so prominent a part in Tupac's life, and the genial, reflective, almost apologetic tone of so much of what we hear him saying.  It's hard to know just how much of what has found its way into this film is really raw truth and how much is sugarcoated revisionism designed to ""resurrect"" and burnish a man's posthumous image and reputation.  His views on women come out particularly incoherent and unresolved.  Yet, ""Tupac: Resurrection"" is an intriguing documentary because it gives us a glimpse not only into a strangely conflicted individual but also into the even more bizarre world of corporate thuggery he inhabited.  Like many artists who have attempted to speak for the ""little people,"" Tupac became a victim of his own success and celebrity, living the kind of pampered lifestyle that most of the people he was singing about would clearly never know.  It's a conflict as old as art itself, and it is one that Tupac, for understandable reasons, was never able to resolve in his own life.  Interestingly, however, his brutal death at the hands of murderous rivals, demonstrated that he never made it quite so far from his roots as his lavish lifestyle might otherwise have suggested.

As a document, the film traces Tupac from his early years as the child of two Black Panther members ( a pedigree that, he believes, set him on the path to social crusader early on), through his youth in poverty, his exposure to literature and drama at a performing arts high school in Baltimore, his early attempts at performing, his meteoric rise in the music industry, his years as a controversial celebrity, his burgeoning film career, his continuing battles with police, the first attempt on his life, his conviction for rape, his time in prison, and, finally, to the rivalry between his own West Coast label, Death Row Records, and the East Coast label, Bad Boy Records, which ultimately led to his untimely death.  For that little bit of history alone, the film is worth watching.

As someone who knew very little about the life of Tupac - and even less about his music - before watching the movie, I found him to be both appealing and repellant, frightening and charismatic.  The film leaves the audience feeling as conflicted as the subject - which is what a truly successful documentary should do after all.",1095465600,6,3723,4.893481717011129
2027305,5,B0001US5T2,"this is the most amazing tupac dvd/documentary i have ever seen, completly narated by tupac and features some amazing footage of previosly unseen interviews etc. if you see only one hip hop dvd this year let it be this one it is a must see",1093478400,2,239,4.333333333333333
2027306,5,B0001US5T2,"I was never a fan of rap music, and for the most part, I still do not like most of it.  However, after viewing this documentary on Tupac, I became very interested in this gifted, talented young man whose life was cut much too short.  The world has lost a truly promising and magnetic artist/activist.  I was genuinely surprised to see that Tupac was a very intelligent and articulate young man.  His writing, his poetry, his acting ability and his political savvy, all were far beyond his young age.  If he had lived and matured, he could (and would, I believe)) have become one of America's leaders.  It is so sad that he is gone.  What a waste...

Buy this DVD or if you don't want to buy it, at least SEE IT.  I think you will understand what I'm talking about.",1092873600,4,764,4.323943661971831
2027307,4,B0001US5T2,"I never was much of a Tupac fan but this dvd has got my interest up. He seemed to be a talented creative man with the ability to throw rhymes and put him emotions into making art. Negative thoughts or images can also be made into art and I think some of that was accomplished by him. Not to say that his thoughts were all negative. He made some valid points. I liked how he said that were are all America and he wanted acceptance for himself not just about the race, but about what he believed surrounded his people, poverty, unfair and unequal treatment, drug addicts, gangsters, etc. I believe that too, I believe that we all need to be accepted because we all make up this country, no matter if what we do is positive or negative or both. Some of the stuff he said seemed hypocritical. So I took some stuff and threw some stuff away. What stood out was this enigmatic character, who had a whole lot of energy. He wanted alot of attention and maybe some of the need for attention may have turned into addiction. I think this strivng to be heard and respected could have caused problems for him. Whether he ticked the wrong people off or was murdered as a marketing strategy, your guess is as good as mine. It seems like whenever a black man gets to vocal he seems to get taken out. I could be wrong it just seems like that. Who does it or who is behind it may be different in each case or it may not be. It is just sad. I think as Tupac evolved he could have really been a force in the black community as a whole, not just for the ghetto but even more than that. The movie basically tells the story of Tupac, which has been pieced together brilliantly, in his own words. That is what really hits home. It really seems like he is talking from the other side. Definatley enlightening and not a waste of time, even for people who may not be fans of rap, a real history on not just this man but on rap music itself and the industry.

2027328,5,B0001US5T2,"Sure you have seen clips of Tupac on BET, on MTV, and on retrospectives but you need to check out Tupac Resurected on DVD--even if you saw it at the movies, this is worth owning, Pac in his own words and awesome extras,  I'll admit it's pricey but worth it.",1089417600,2,257,4.14
2027329,4,B0001US5T2,"""Tupac Resurrection"" is a documentary celebrating the life of Grammy-nominated rapper Tupac Shakur. Tupac's mother, Afeni Shakur, serves as executive producer on the film, so this is really a loving tribute to her son, made for his many fans. Because MTV produced ""Tupac Resurrection"", director Lauren Lazin was able to include material from MTV's archives, which would otherwise not be available. Lauren Lazin has done a good job of presenting a coherent portrait of Tupac Shakur's music, message, and personality, from his childhood in Harlem to his death in Las Vegas in 1996, at the age of 25. ""Tupac Resurrection"" isn't going to convert anyone who doesn't already like Tupac Shakur's music or share his political convictions. His detractors will find their justification in the film, and his fans will find theirs. Perhaps ironically, that is the film's  strength. ""Tupac Resurrection"" uses a lot of interview audio, as well as the interviews, themselves, to present Tupac's life in his own words. He speaks for himself here. Afeni Shakur and director Lauren Lazin are to be commended for including the less admirable aspects of Tupac's personality, including coverage of his 1994 trial for sexual abuse which resulted in Shakur serving eleven months in prison. Tupac Shakur once said that his life is a story of ""ambition, violence, redemption, and love"". Love him or hate him, this is a very good documentary about a man who not only cultivated the image of constant conflict, but also the reality.

The DVD: This is a very good package of bonus features for Tupac Shakur fans. In ""Interviews"", you will find a never-before-seen interview from 1992, recorded by MTV while Shakur was recording ""A Very Special Christmas, Vol. 2"" and an interview with Tupac and Snoop Dogg that was taped after the 1996 Music Video Awards. The ""Malcolm X Dinner Speech"" is a speech Tupac gave in 1992 at a dinner banquet given by the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement. ""Deposition"" is a video taped deposition that Tupac gave in 1995 while in the Clinton Correctional Facility concerning a lawsuit. ""About the Resurrection Soundtrack"" features three songs from the movie accompanied by interviews with the artists: 2 songs by Eminem and one by 50 Cent. There are two videos in ""Music Videos"". In ""Remembering Tupac"" ten actors and musicians and nine family members talk about what Tupac Shakur meant to them in mostly separate interviews. The celebrities include Jada Pinkett Smith, Snoop Dogg, Treach, Mary Jo Blige, and 50 Cent. ""Mutulu Shakur Interview"" is with Tupac's stepfather. In ""Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts"", Afeni Shakur talks about the performing arts center that bears her son's name. ""Bootleg This!"" is a short statement concerning lawsuits against Tupac Shakur's estate. Also included are some deleted scenes and an audio commentary featuring director Lauren Lazin, Tupac's mother and executive producer Afeni Shakur, and some surprise guests. I wouldn't recommend the bonus features if you're simply interested in learning about Tupac Shakur, but are not especially a fan. It really doesn't provide any additional insight. But this is a gold mine for fans.",1087603200,21,3167,5.14757281553398
2027330,5,B0001US5T2,"Bought the special collecters edition of ""Tupac Resurrection"" (2003) earlier today. I am very impressed by the way this movie was put together, to have everything in his own words was a real highlight and this is by far the most comprehensive release about him. This movie really gives people an idea of who Pac was, and how he came up while also showing his motivation, struggles, ambitions and influences. I liked the numerous pictures of Pac at different stages of his life and the fact that his own music serves alot of the movies background. The special features menu is full of gems, my personal favourites are the never before seen interviews, and the section entitled ""Remembering Tupac"" which has music artists, family and friends recollecting. Today (June 16th) is the day Tupac was born, highly recommend getting this DVD for the collection whether your new to Pac or have followed him since his first album like myself. Gone, but never forgotten. One Love.",1087344000,4,968,4.872727272727273

I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know about Pac, his life and his experiences.",1087257600,,420,4.134146341463414

2027333,5,B0001US5T2,"I saw the first cut at the Sundance film festival.  I wasn't a huge Tupac fan before the film.  This film was brilliant though.  The director told the story of Tupac's life and death in only his words of narration.  The crazy part is Pac was already dead!
(The director some how got a hold of MTV footage that was never aired etc.)
Even if you don't like HIP Hop it's an amazing documentary.
I thought some of the transitions could have been quicker but I saw a rough cut so maybe they have changed some things.",1086480000,2,511,4.237113402061856
2027334,3,B0001US5T2,"""Tupac -- Resurrection"" takes a page from the ""Peter Tosh -- Stepping Razor/Red X"" documentary ""book"" by basically having Tupac Shakur tell his own story by weaving together snippets of interviews with the rapper himself.
The documentary of reggae legend Tosh did it to better effect, namely because the ""Red X"" tapes were made by Tosh with the intent to turn them into his own story, spoken in his own voice. And both interesting and sad, Tupac's life and death somewhat mirrors the life of the Jamaican legend who still is put in the shadows of Bob Marley's iconic worship. Tosh also lived by the gun and died by the gun. His gun was his fiery vocals and lyrics, and it was his relentless, don't-back-down stances that made him a target of the government and police who would mark all his government papers with a red ""X."" And he was beaten by the police on numerous occassions, one time almost being beaten to death. And it was his unflinching demand for equal rights that lead to his death at his home in 1987.
And so, in many ways Tupac is like an American Tosh. He was similarly relentless, and uttered truths in an in-your-face, unabridged manner.
Whereas Tosh's documentary is governed by a sadness stemming from a childhood in which he was abandoned by his father (and had no fatherly presence in his life) and was taunted and teased for being ""dark-skinned"" -- ultimately all he wanted was love, not just for himself, but for the poor and struggling, and he was seeking the always-elusive truth to bring it to the people (both friend and foe alike), a lonely man always seeking happiness and love, but yet he never truly found it.
In contrast, while Tupac fought for much of the same and had a semi-similar upbringing (lacking a father), he had more support around him (going to the Baltimore arts school), and he was a living, walking contradiction as many who fall under the Gemini sign are, living in many extremes (feminist--misogynist, lover--firebrand, sensitive--hateful). For Tosh, he didn't fly between such opposites -- he was who he was, didn't pander to anyone or anything, but what he believed to be the truth.
So while Tosh's documentary is driven by an underlying sadness of unrequited love, Tupac's movie carries with it a sort of ghostly creepiness, as it begins with him seemingly speaking about his own murder. It may be somewhat light and superficial as many documentaries for fallen icons are, but it doesn't entirely shy away from showing his faults. It may not answer new questions, but it's still worth picking up for any Tupac fan, if only because you have Tupac, like Tosh, telling his own story -- which is arguably the best way to hear his story.
Who knew it? Tosh and Tupac, T and T, related in death.
(get both DVDs, telling stories of two men who never knew each other with Tosh dying just as Tupac's career was getting started, but yet having many striking similarities)",1085961600,2,2912,4.700587084148728
2027335,5,B0001US5T2,"This movie was flawless. There wasn't a single mistake nor error. I know that is a disappointment to maintstream Hollywood, but it's true! Yes there is finally a great movie about the most Controversial rap artist of our time. There is finally a movie that shows how wrong, biased, and down right evil the media was towards Pac during his life time. They tried to reduce him to nothing but a low-life, trouble making, hood star with tattoos. Just because they were threatened by the truth in his lyrics, and the realness of his actions. Let's keep it real, Tupac represented a whole mass of youths in urban ghettos all across the country, if mainstream media accepted Pac, then they would have to accpet all of us, gangstas and thugs included! and you know they are not having that! With that being said, it's not suprising to hear some of the negative reviews previously stated. Some people would love to keep Tupac Shakur in that negative depiction of a thug life screaming maniac with out hearing his side of the story. Well this movie dismisses all of that. We hear the story coming straigt out of his mouth. We heard why he did certain things, how he felt about it, and his opinions of his own actions. If you watched the movie you saw that he was caring, intellegent, beautiful, charismatic, charming, misunderstood and incredibly talented. Don't get me wrong.. He had his faults as well.. But he didn't have faults because he was Tupac, he had faults because he was HUMAN, not only that but he was only 25!
Let Pac rest in Peace! He was already his biggest critic. If you're going to tell a story about him then tell all sides. If your going to scream about him being a thug, then also scream about him being politically conscious. If your going talk about him being in trouble with the law, then keep it real with yourself and others and talk about how almost everyone with the last name SHAKUR is either dead or in jail from their political practices.
This movie shows all of that.. The good and the grimy, the real and the romantic. It is a most have for any fan of hip-hop, urban politics, and future film makers....
until next time
