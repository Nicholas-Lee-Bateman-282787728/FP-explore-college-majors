8660101,3,B00KMJBM8S,"Serious teenage revolt here! Already rebellious and sneaking out at night to hang with the beat crowd, Jennifer accelerates her misbehavior when Dad brings home his new, French bride. This British film has a John Barry soundtrack (a plus) and the storyline is fairly interesting. Acting is mediocre, there is a lot of conflict and tension. Worth a watch.",1521417600,,354,5.016949152542373
