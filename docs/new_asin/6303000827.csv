Its damn funny. If you like B horror with kitch, overdone fx, bad acting, and hot chicks you'll love it , but its not a horror masterpiece. I liked it enough to have bought a replacement copy

but I like horror with kitch, overdone fx, bad acting, and hot chicks ;)",1137628800,3,387,4.273972602739726
531094,5,6303000827,When i was 9 yrs old my grandfather had this recorded tape under his bed. When i found it i watched it. It ended up being Demon Wind. Then as i got older i realized that i loved that movie so much because everytime i watched a scary movie i thought about it. So i went to every movie store and none of them had it.. NONE!!! So i finally decided to come online and i found it. Im so glad i did. This movie was my all time favorite.  I just loved watching it. I just cant wait til i actually get to have the movie in my hands so i can watch it again!!,1130371200,4,549,3.7327586206896552

531097,3,6303000827,"This film to me was one of those ""Almost"" films. Almost, but no cigar. Not much thought in the storyline, and the acting was somewhat weak. To myself, it was like an Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead, and a touch of Friday the 13th, ripoff. Friday the 13th, meaning at the begining of this film, with the old man, Harcourt, telling them not to go there, to stay away if they know what's good for them, etc. But then again, there are quite a few movies that do that.  The movie starts with this couple in a farmhouse in the year 1931. She's praying and whatnot, while candles burn in the house, as well as in the center of a pentagram, while demons are screaming,""you can't keep us out"". It seems that this farmhouse is some gateway to hell, and grandma has some spell that keeps them at bay. Until this night. They seemed to have possessed her husband, and all hell breaks loose. Then we skip to present day. So, here we have a young man, his girlfriend, and a couple of car-loads of their friends, in the middle of nowhere, in search of a rural farmhouse, where the lead man, Cory's grandparents had suffered a horrible fate, almost 60 yrs. ago. It seems Cory is determined to find out what or whom killed them.(pretty stupid reason wanting to find out after all these years, but hey, it's a movie) When they find the farmhouse, a couple of the girls, mainly Molly, feels some bad vibes there. Cory, determined to find out what happened to the grandparents, does not really care about the bad vibes, and decides to investigate inside the house. There, what was left of it, is everything in place the same night his grandparents were murdered. (even the beautifully cooked turkey, that still looks like it just came out of the oven, I'd like to know where you can buy a turkey like that, that stays that good sitting around for 60 yrs.) Practically all the stuff in there looked brand new. It must have been some great weather conditions to keep all that stuff looking like that. Couldn't the makers of this movie at least thrown some dirt on stuff to look like it's been sitting around for years? Anyway, strange things start happening. These 3 little girl ghosts, demons, or whatever they are, appear and takes one of the girls. So, they deceide it's time to leave, but the cars will not start. They decide to walk, but then a mysterious fog keeps coming while they are walking, and takes them right back to the farmhouse. Seems there is no escape, and they systematically start getting bumped off. After being killed, they come back as ""DEMONS"", and go after the living that remain, at the farmhouse. (Kind of sounds like Evil Dead to me). This movie, I think, could have been alot better, if there was more gore, and made a little more sense. The acting was typical b-rated I guess. About as corny as you're gonna get. There's some decent one-liners, some slimy, gorey effects, but just not enough. The make-up was pretty impressive though. That I did like. All in all though, the movie was not that great. Nothing new presented here. Like I said earlier, you can definetly see that they relied heavily on copying Evil Dead. Personally, I would skip this one, and go buy Evil Dead if you haven't seen it yet. The only reason I gave this 3 stars was for the great make-up, and special effects. Otherwise, i can't say I enjoyed it. I bought it after reading the reviews on here about it. It sounded pretty good, but I was pretty dissatisfied overall.",1042416000,5,3454,4.491255961844197
531098,3,6303000827,"I didn't expect much of this movie, particularly after seeing the hologram packaging, but it turned out to be _really_ good. It has some nice touches, some bizarre twists, and some really likable characters. It did have me  scratching my head from time to time (why does the power of good imbue you  with a troll head? ), but it was altogether a good romp of a film. The  magician duo and their last stand against pressing hoards of zombies is  just a classic moment. If you're a horror fan, you'll get a kick out of  this film.",964742400,9,528,4.346938775510204
531179,2,6303000827,"This is a B-movie that made the mistake of taking itself seriously. This would have been entertaining as a spoof or horror / comedy. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy B-movies. They can be very entertaining. My opinion is - just move on. The effects even at late 80's level are poor. The characters are criminally stupid in both concept and action. The writing is pitiful. Characters come and go with no concept of plot advancement. Its just a bad movie. The overall story in the right hands could have been decent. The movie's only saving grace is decent production value (ignoring the awful drippy demon makeup). Bleh... I hated it 5 minutes in, but watched the rest to work off bad karma.",1519171200,,685,4.5772357723577235
531180,5,6303000827,"So happy for this movie to finally be available on a modern format!  I only ever got to watch this gem once when I was like eight or ten years old and I never forgot about it.  I have often sought it out as an adult, but could never be assed to deal with it on vhs format.  It isn't quite as terrifying as I remember, but it is still amazing and it looks great on blue ray.  Has an Evil Dead feal... ALSO, if you are a fan of Cabin in the Woods, I think you'll agree the puppeteers had a hand in everything that transpires in Demon Wind.",1518998400,,537,3.8545454545454545

Cats that won't start, creepy Latin, and demons who can only be defeated with karate and witchcraft. This move scared me as a kid and going back to it as an adult has made my life complete.

531184,3,6303000827,"It's a decent B movie and I remembered really liking it when I first watched it in 1991. Yes, it's campy as hell, but decent effects for a low budget film. It's nowhere near as good as Evil Dead 2, but it's great if you're looking for something similar.

The three stars is my personal experience on the audio transfer for the Blu-ray disc. There was an ear splitting ringing that would not go away no matter if I ran it through the television speakers or through the external speakers. I was excited about seeing a remastered version of the film but I just couldn't listen to that ringing anymore. I popped in the DVD and let my 4K DVD player do the upgrading and there was no you're splitting ring that distracted me from the movie. It was a combo package and I'm really glad the DVD was included or else I wouldn't be able to watch the movie again. Maybe I just got a bad copy and the audio track on other Blu-rays is just fine.",1515110400,,931,4.230337078651686
531185,4,6303000827,"I remember getting this on VHS as a kid from Blockbuster back in the year 2000. I was terrified of this movie as a kid.

I will not say it's the greatest movie ever but it's a fun cheesy 80s (I know it was released in 1990 but the atmosphere is still very 80s) movie. Some pretty cool practical effects, costumes and GORE.",1510099200,,322,4.111111111111111
531186,4,6303000827,"Unusually amusing horror movie about a young man who brings a surprisingly large group of friends along when he visits a mysterious farm where everyone but his father was murdered.  When he asks for directions a local gas station owner tells him the farm doesn't exist which actually kind of turns out to be true.  Another local warns them that they should turn around and go back home before it's too late but that kind of warning only makes horror movie characters more determined to get to the place where they will meet their unfortunate fates.

The visual style, music, monster and gore effects and even the storyline are all very similar to what you would find in a 1980's Italian horror movie by Lucio Fulci or Lamberto Bava.  But the acting and dialogue end up moving the needle much closer to parody than horror.  Demon Wind is frequently very funny but it's possible that everyone involved was dead serious and the movie just turned out that way.  It's also possible that Demon Wind is a deadpan horror comedy and that the laughs are completely intentional.  I couldn't tell for certain but either way the movie is a lot of fun.",1509408000,6,1138,4.6318407960199
531187,5,6303000827,"I loved Demon Wind when I saw it on VHS, and I love it now that it's on a stellar Blu-ray.  Sure, the story is all over the place.  There are some slow moments, the audio could be better (the way it was made, not the way it was released on Blu-ray) but for those things, there is some pretty good action horror going on.  Fun gore and atmosphere.  Great throwback to the VHS days.

The interviews on the extras are interesting.  I really wish there was a director's commentary.  Overall, this is easily a five star release by Vinegar Syndrome.",1509321600,,543,4.316831683168317
531188,5,6303000827,"The Vinegar Syndrome Blu-ray disc looks excellent, with a 2k scan from the original camera negative. The movie is a wild one, with a crazy appearance from martial arts legend Stephen Quadros, a ton of goopy creature effects, and some offbeat dialogue and narrative choices.

531209,5,6303000827,"I bought this dvd thinking nothing of it until I tried to play it. It wouldn't. Very frustrating.

531210,3,6303000827,"From its fiery opening credits, we know that DEMON WIND means business! Yessiree, demons are real, and they indwell the unsuspecting! Cory (Eric Larson) and his friends are led to an old shack in the middle of nowhere. This has something to do w/ Cory's dad, and a series of nightmares. From the weird gas station, to the creepy diner, DEMON WIND tries its best to create an atmosphere of eeevil. Instead, an atmosphere of cheeeze-fabulous-ness is generated! Mostly, this is a feeble attempt to make a movie like EVIL DEAD. Unlike this film, EVIL DEAD had a building sense of dread and doom. Unlike EVIL DEAD, this film has a karate-kicking magician! Upon their arrival at the aforementioned shack, terror, possession, and slow-motion flashbacks ensue! As far as ultra-low-budget horror movies go, DEMON WIND isn't the worst. It actually has a few, precious moments of true spookery, unfortunately all too reminiscent of Sam Raimi's classic. There's the scary journal, squawking demon voices, and squirting goo, a la EVIL DEAD, as well as the seven daggers from THE OMEN! There's a load of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD in here too! At least it borrows from the best.  Annnd, there's the big, bonkers finale w/ Satan himself, covered in corn syrup and mashed potatoes! Still, w/ the right amount of the proper beverages, at the right time of night, w/ the right group of friends, this could be a hoot-a-thon...",1453075200,2,1405,4.854166666666667

531213,5,6303000827,"I took a chance on buying this movie despite the bad grade on IMDb. Horror movies in general are a gamble, their either a waste or great. Demon Wind is a true gem in my eyes because it's everything I love. It's about a man trying to find out about how his grandparents died so he goes to revisit their house, his friends come along as well. When one wants to leave, a strange force brings them back to the house, it's the force of the DEMON WIND pushing them back. The only way they can escape is buy killing the source but it's not what they expect.

My favorite part of the movie is when the karate dude was showcasing his amazing abilities, by kicking a can in the air then into his other friends face. I though that was extremely random. Also when demons pop up everywhere and two dudes go all guns a blaze on them. The movie has terrible acting though it makes up for it with it's interesting premise. I wish they made a sequel or remake of this, it's the bomb.",1383955200,,966,4.165775401069519

A real shame. This is one that demands a re-issue. With all he crap that gets put out year after year, why not a super quality film like this. I don't wish to ruin it by discussing it.

531217,4,6303000827,"Warning: Region 2 encoding (This DVD will not play on most DVD players sold in the US or Canada [Region 1]. This item requires a region specific or multi-region DVD player and compatible TV.  Luckily I have that, since there are more than a few rare films that are still only available in the Region 2 format.

The story is simple: A young man revisits his family estate where years ago a horror was unleashed by ancestors that delved into the dark arts.  Now that horror is unleashed upon him, his girlfriend, and his iconic friends.  Their attempts to escape are thwarted by dead engines, a mysterious fog that transports them back to the main haunting grounds, and hordes of zombie-demons on the prowl.  They are forced to make a last stand in the ruins of the house that was the source of the evil.  Who do you think will survive?  You get two guesses.

Just as in Evil Dead, no one simply dies, everyone comes back in some demonic form.  There are some interesting effects.  My favorite involved some simple camera tricks where the old house can be seen whole and complete through the extant mantle of the doorway instead of in its current state of ruin.  Unlike most of the films in the horror genre from that decade, this one is more hopeful.  There are also powers of good that can be called upon to fight the powers of darkness.

I have long been a fan of this film.  The movie certainly plays to a variety of horror tropes, but manages to pull it off.  The special effects are cheesy, pretty standard to the quality of movies from that era in which it was made.  The acting is typical of this genre.

I actually saw this movie originally when it first came out and remembered liking it enough to order the DVD.  After viewing it again (mind you I was in my 20's when I first saw it, I'm 44 now) it seemed kind of stupid in parts.  Could have done without the martial art magicians.  All that said, I would recommend it to fans of the horror genre.  Especially some of the younger generation of horror fans who have probably seen the Evil Dead and Demons movies, but may not have heard of this one due to it's obscurity.
