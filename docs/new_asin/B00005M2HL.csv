7944793,3,B00005M2HL,"If you are not familiar with the Sidney James series of movies, they are actually fairly tame, with little to no nudity and no swearing with typically good British humour though. This particular film is about the planning of a heist of birth control pills from a maternity ward with one of the men posing as a nurse and all that follows afterward. An added bonus for me in this film is that it also stars Wendy Richard (from ""Are You Being Served""), who's voice I have always liked for some reason.  Anyway, not a ground breaking film, just something silly and fun to watch, although some of the other Carry On films are better.",1511568000,,628,4.460869565217391

7944798,4,B00005M2HL,"Carry on Matron plot involves a gang of crooks, Sid James, Bill Maynard, Bernard Bresslaw & Kenneth Cope, robbing a maternity hospital of ""the pill"" and selling them to other less well off countries. The only way to get information on where the pill is stored is by Kenneth Cope, dressing up as a nurse and going inside the hospital. Kenneth Cope as a nurse attracts the attention of a randy doctor, played by Terry Scott, who takes a fancy to him. The plot rolls along with several running gags including one with Kenneth Connor as a train station master complaining about his much delayed baby. Hattie Jacques is the matron with the inevitable crush on the chief consultant, played by Kenneth Williams.

Joan Sims is reduced to a bit part really as Kenneth Connor's ever pregnant wife who just keeps on shovelling down food.

Barbara Windsor plays the sexy nurse who also falls for Kenneth Cope when his identity is revealed when he runs upstairs, falls as he does and she sees his trousers rolled up under his nurse's uniform. It's one of the better films in the series.",1127952000,,1073,4.6421052631578945

7944800,5,B00005M2HL,"Another fun-filled, laugh a minute, Carry On Adventure, set in, as quite a lot are, a hospital!
Old lovable rogue Sid Carter (Sid James) leads his bumbling gang of thieves in an escapade to steal a massive hoard of birth control tablets from Finisham Maternity Hospital, and gets his son Cyril (Kenneth Cope) to pose in drag as a nurse, with disastrous consequences.
Add to this the neurotic head of the hospital, Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), the bumbling and domineering Matron (Hatti Jacques)-who Sir Bernhard is curiously besotted with- and the blond and bubbly fun-girl Nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor)-as the nurse who Cyril lands as his roommate- and you get a handful of disasters and laughs.
If you like the wonderful 70's and British Comedy , you will love this!",1050883200,2,784,4.946969696969697
7944801,4,B00005M2HL,"After the failure of Carry On At Your Convenience (1971), Gerald Thomas (Director) and Peter Rodgers (Producer) decided to return to familiar terrority - the hospital. Previous medical titles Nurse (1958), Doctor (1967) and Again Doctor (1969) had proved immensly succesful at the Box Office and were regarded by some as some of the best entries in the long running series.
In my own opinion I have to say that I found Again Doctor (1969) to be the best of the medical carry on's, although this later entry is of good value. All of the familiar faces are here including Hattie Jaques in the title role, who plays the role marvelously, taking a calmer, more subtle approach to the role in comparison to the more ferocious stereotype as seen in Nurse and Doctor. Sid James, Kenneth Williams, Joan Sims, Barbara Windsor, Bernard Bresslaw, Charles Hawtrey, Terry Scott, Kenneth Connor, Jaki Piper and Patsy Rolands are all present as well as being joined by Kenneth Cope, Jack Douglas, Bill Maynard, Gwendoline Watts and none other than Wendy Richard, more famously known as the downtrodden Pauline Fowler in the hit BBC T.V soap, EastEnders.
There is a little more structure to the plot with it centering around Sid and his petty gang of crooks that plan to rob the maternity ward of fertlity pills, which are worth millions abroad. They send in Kenneth Cope in drag, posing as a nurse. Its all predictable stuff of course but there are some wonderful performances here including a lovley cameo from Joan Sims as an over-expectant mother who spends most of her time eating in bed, Terry Scott as the ever randy doctor and Kenneth Williams who is permantley paranoid about being struck down with some illness. The film develops at a leisurley pace making way all the slap stick mayhem etc although that is actually toned down considerably a lot in comparsion to most other entries. Regardles of that, it stands as a very good comedy and one of the best of the 1970's carry On's which were beginning to be almost preoccupied by smut which led to the series abruptly ending in 1978 with the worst film in the series, Carry On Emmannuelle. As for carry On Matrion, it remain true to the spirit of classic Carry on's. A classic. Recommended.",996364800,5,2233,4.757731958762887
