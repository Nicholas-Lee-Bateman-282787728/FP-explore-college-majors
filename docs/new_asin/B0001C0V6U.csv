8009904,5,B0001C0V6U,I first saw this movie in 1982 when it premiered on NBC. It really moved me then and I had the chance to see it again about a year ago.  It is still just as moving now as it was 28 years ago.  Excellent performances and good writing make this a classic family movie.,1266019200,,266,3.9074074074074074
8009905,4,B0001C0V6U,"This is not normally the kind of movie I would normally have any interest in seeing - probably having to do with my fear that it would try to 'inspire' me or some such triteness. But I have to admit that this 1981 TV-movie actually did affect me, and not always for the reasons I expected.

Okay, yeah, I will confess to having a youthful crush on Karen Valentine (the result of a kiddie matinee of ""Hot Lead and Cold Feet"" at age 10), and it's very easy to dismiss her now as a sort of ersatz Sally Field. But the fact is she's actually a pretty good actress (not to mention very pretty), and perfectly suited for this story of a young woman struggling to change the lives of emotionally and physically abused children through the use of animal therapy, specifically involving this telefilm's title character, the lovable, scruffy Skeezer.

I think what's best conveyed here, though, is the uphill nature of Karen Valentine's fight to help these kids, how hard it is, and all the challenges she has to face to even make marginal progress. There are no easy answers here, and her charges will never be fully 'cured.' But with the help of her four-legged friend, some progress, however incremental, can be made.

One note: the previous reviewer, in addition to being almost completely incoherent, apparently mistook this as some kind of kids' movie. Despite the fact that the cover art does seem to promote it as some kind of cute-girl-&-her-cute-dog type of story, that it ain't. Not that there's really any objectionable material in it (though there are some scenes where some of the kids are a little rough on Skeezer which are a little bit hard to watch), but this is a film that's certainly suitable for all but the youngest members of the family.",1236384000,2,1751,4.641935483870967
8009906,2,B0001C0V6U,"being that I was 11/12 during this ""made for TV"" flick. A drama but not a mellowdrama about a dog in the MH.  Kid's don't like being subjegated to emotional baggage drama and violence in an otherwise lighthearted endevor about a dog. Me and my brother thought it was like ""Benji"" or ""Lassie"" boy were we wrong.  I am reveiwing this by memory only, haven't seeen this POC in 30 odd years.  But i think kids shows were(in the Fn '70s) a way for 20 something boomers to ""work out' thier own issues. my childhood, the X.
I let bigons be bigons here as this is bigon and archane I MO and no wonder they don't sell it anyomor.",1226620800,,620,4.19327731092437
