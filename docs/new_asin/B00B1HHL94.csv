5551729,4,B00B1HHL94,I started a collection of the Saturday Morning shows from my era(1967-1974).This  cartoon fits in the 1973-74 slot. After the first viewing all that was missing was the Super Sugar Crisp.,1402704000,3,187,5.032258064516129
5551730,5,B00B1HHL94,I am so glad they finally released this DVD.  This show was one of my favorite cartoons as a child.  I really enjoyed  watching this again.,1400457600,,139,4.269230769230769
5551731,5,B00B1HHL94,"I received the dvd promptly, & it was everything I remembered it to be.  Too bad the show didn't last longer & get the recognition & fandom it deserved.",1387670400,2,152,4.241379310344827
5551732,3,B00B1HHL94,"The first disc didn't play due to loading problems, but the second one worked fine. (I suspect this may be because I have an old DVD player, though...)
The episodes are pretty much standard fare for 70's Saturday morning cartoons, and yes, ""Elvis"" the dog got VERY annoying after a while...
Get this DVD purely for nostalgic purposes, but don't expect high theater...",1377129600,,367,4.841269841269841
5551733,5,B00B1HHL94,havent seen it yet but it is a cartoon on saturdays i usally watch them because there is nothing else on but great voices from the past,1376438400,,135,4.037037037037037
5551734,5,B00B1HHL94,"This show presented the concept of teenage secret agents 20 years before the likes of ""Kim Possible"", ""Totally Spies"", and ""Alias"".

Butch (who resembled 70s hearthrob David Cassidy) led his team on secret missions on behalf of their computer boss Mr. Socrates.  Merilee was an expert in disguises and piloting aircraft and played a mean tambourine.  Steffie kept her cool during dangerous situations.  Wally was the *Shaggy* and Elvis was the *Scooby* of the group, preferring to avoid danger yet sticking by their friends in completing the missions.

Great songs, appealing character designs, and some good adventure stories with the familiar Hanna-Barbera animation style and sound effects.  The bad guys were not phony ghosts like ""Scooby Doo"" or exaggeratedly power-mad costumed villains like ""Josie and the Pussycats"" but subtle villians for enemy foreign powers.

Interesting show.",1376265600,,888,5.485294117647059

5551737,5,B00B1HHL94,"i used to be an animator/layout artist for hanna-barbera, among other studios, back in the day. i met chip hand, butch cassidy's voice back in the '80's, when i was one of the few who actually had tapes of this show. he asked me to make a set for him so he could show his kids 'what dad used to do for a living.' i've also met judy strangis (steffy) and mickey dolenz (wally) in my past, too. it's cool to finally have this series on dvd where, unlike previous shows from these people, they DIDN'T TAKE THE LAUGH TRACK OFF this time. that ALONE would garner 5 stars from me, but the show was one of h-b's better 'scooby clones', plus their music group rocked. love it, glad it's back and WHEN ARE YOU GUYS GONNA FINALLY DO DEVLIN???????????",1363046400,19,740,4.292857142857143
