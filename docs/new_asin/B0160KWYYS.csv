7455083,5,B0160KWYYS,"I watched this film with Chinese subtitle on website and was amazed and touched by its quality. I therefore ordered the DVDs mainly for the English subtitle.  Unfortunately the first disk which includes several episodes was broken and I don't know how to get this park back. Anyway, this film is so well done and inspiring. It gets me closer to the image of Lord Budhha in my mind. Best wishes to all the workers involved in making this film.",1492732800,4,442,4.525

About the product:
Product is made with good quality, I would say good for the price range. It comes with book separators and some paper weight, although I'm not too concern with these gadgets.  I had a problem with one of the DVD, it did not play properly (disk 9 in my case). I contacted the seller and received a replacement DVD within reasonable time frame. Excellent seller.

About the movie:
In terms of movie productions, this is excellent (much better than many Hollywood films). The CGI is good enough.

In terms of the plots, I think it emphasizes too much during the growing up period, i.e., from Sitthata pre-birth to his turning to ascetic hood, it covers 65% - 70% of the story.  In my view, the producer over emphasize background or drama scenes of those various characters. Mangala in particular.  Perhaps, this may be a characteristic of Bollywood films.  The story really become much more interesting and cover very well the key parts with its details as most Buddhist now know from the Tipitaka.  The enlightenment scenes was excellent.

The DVD has its audio in Hindi with English subtitle. This is where I would beg the producer to please redo this part and release DVD again.  As a none Indian person, I feel strongly that the English subtitle miss out a lot of critical information.  Better yet, an English audio version would be ideal.

That said, I still say that this is the best Buddha biography ever !!",1449705600,12,1494,4.681992337164751

8735255,5,B0160KWYYS,"Being a student of Western Buddhism, getting this close to Buddha Shakyamuni's life is amazing. Everything since his ancestors, birth, childhood and young age as prince of the Shakyas, his surrender of al possessions and meditative experiences for 6 years under the Bodhi tree, his 84,000 teachings, seeing many of his brothers and other relatives become early monks and his mother becoming the first buddhist female monk (nun in our days), to his death. AMAZING!!!!!",1529539200,,467,5.24

8735257,5,B0160KWYYS,"I really like this production of Buddha.  The movie  sets are beautiful, the actors are talented and the story are retold beautifully.  I wish they have the series in blu ray.  The DVD may be clear for 40 inches TV but not bigger TV.  All the DVD worked.  The subtitles are not as good or clear as the one on Netflix.  Overall, I would give this series a 4.5 stars.",1525132800,,365,4.128571428571429

8735262,1,B0160KWYYS,"I was very busy and could not watch the DVDs until after the return date had expired.  Of the thirteen DVDs only five played on my DVD player.  I checked them on my friends DVD player and got the same results.  When I tried to play them on my Toshiba laptop, ten played and three did not play.
I sent several emails to Indian Ethnicity and never received a reply.  Could it be because my return date had expired they did not reply?  I sent one email to Ultra Distributors in India and they said the next time I come to India they would gladly replace the DVDs.  Great!  The quality of the physical DVD is very low.  As far as the content of the Bollywood production, I hold reserve on that.",1497225600,2,690,4.174242424242424
