8502787,5,B0009RCHBO,"I would have to say that this is an absolutely incredible production as an introductory course of neuroscience at an undergraduate college level.  It is done with a great university professor, and Dr. Sapolsky introduces the basics of neurology and some slight genetics integrated throughout the curriculum.  It is very well organized, and it is extremely comprehensible to almost anyone who would like to know a bit more about the functioning of the human brain.  Although it is a short course, it comes with detailed outlines, and there is a good glossary with the course, in addition to a large bibliography, so it is easy to have ideas of what new texts you will use.",1117670400,3,671,4.817391304347826
