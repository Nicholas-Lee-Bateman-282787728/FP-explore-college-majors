8392876,5,B003A7TNIK,"This movie explores both a powerful war theme and highlights a historical contribution, too often ignored by English speaking historians, when it comes to the Czech and Polish men and women serving alongside the British in all theatres of the war against German and Italian forces.

The film focuses on a company of Czech soldiers fighting in the Battle of Tobruk.  They fight alongside British, Indian, South African, New Zealand, Australian and Polish troops in holding the line against Rommel's forces.  The Czech characters range from a brutal and murderous bully to a coward turned heroe.  It is a well made film with very graphically realistic battle scenes.  I highly recommend it as a war film and for those interested in compiling for themselves the full story of the Battle for Tobruk.",1350777600,5,795,4.992424242424242
