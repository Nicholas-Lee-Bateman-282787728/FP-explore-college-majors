2356035,3,B000A3DGF8,"Funny movie. Not as intelligent or well-made as my favorite zombie movie parody, Shaun of the Dead, but this is more a parody of a B-Grade zombie movie. The scene where Johnny is using a decapitated head as a hand puppet is priceless. I love how it has such a nonsensical plot like a lot of those movies.",1124582400,,304,4.258620689655173

It's kind of like a bit of a musical (in that there is a lot of music and at least one ""dance number""), mixed with Shaun of the Dead. Very bizarre and somewhat random. The plot is the same as most zombie movies, but because of the twists and turns, it makes it into a production of it's own.

It is almost like a parody of horror movies, because of its intended cheesiness. Nothing in this movie is to be taken seriously. We have a huge amount of people dying gruesome deaths all over the place, with country music playing in the background. Like one film critic said, it's ""The U.S. Answer to Shaun of the Dead"".

2356078,4,B000A3DGF8,"I should preface this by saying that I usually avoid horror movies, particularly horror films that tend to be on the gory side. But i really enjoyed this movie and and all of its goriness. The movie is really funny. I actually found myself laughing out loud which isn't common while watching a 'scary' movie. The story is pretty standard. A group on their way to a wedding have to stop for the night at a bed and breakfast. The group then has to do with a bunch of sort of hillbilly zombies. While the film appears to be made a small budget, that sort of adds to the charm. I also really enjoyed the musical interludes. They were really funny and a highlight of the film for me.

It actually has some really good acting and actors. It's everything you'd expect from a roadtrip in Texas gone badly. (Why's it always gotta be Texas, y'all?!) However, it's definitely NOT what you'd expect...especially with chapter titles such as ""Massacare at the Hoedown"".

There's singing, dancing, murdering, zombies, possession, love, death, destruction and David Carridine.

2356081,3,B000A3DGF8,"""Dead and Breakfast"" pulled a fast one on me personally. I was really looking forward to completely bashing this movie. There were so many things in the first half that made it unbearable, I was ready to give it two stars, or even one, which I've never done for a movie. But then of course, halfway through it becomes a lot more enjoyable and my horror senses perked up like Spiderman in Sing-Sing! So what did I think about this slasher-gone-possession/comedy? Read on to find out!

To be honest, the back story is thin as paper. The movie opens up with the six main characters in their RV driving to a friend's wedding, I didn't know until she mentioned that a girl and her boyfriend were strangers to the others? Yeah, that makes sense. Then they decide to stop at an overnight hotel, when clearly they have enough sleeping space in the RV. Well, that's just the beginning of the movie's shenanigans and tomfoolery.

The town in which they stop is absolutely riddled with yokel wonders. In fact, practically all of the characters in this movie are complete and absolute pinheads! The town residents are country bumpkins, evident in such lines as""You don't eat meat? Hhmm... how about beaver!"". The sheriff also starts a massive shootout/mob-fight because somebody yanked a hair off the back of his head. Oh yeah, makes total sense, no problem. The main characters, most of the time are hotheaded booze-guzzlers. In retrospect, it's all actually pretty funny but at the beginning can be annoying. Then we have a guy who puts cigarettes in his mouth but doesn't light them? Terry Gilliam would be dying of laughter if he saw.

There are also comic strip postcards in the entire opening credits, and a segway from scene to scene. It's a unique idea and I give them credit for doing something like that, but it just feels like filler to me. We also get a narrator that combines country and rap. Sometimes it's really entertaining, other times it's just obnoxious, like when he sings a song that sounds like a total ripoff of the Eagles 'Take It Easy', at the town hoedown.

So, while I found the first 35 minutes of this film to be absolutely detestable, irritating and self-parodying, the rest of the movie ironically kicks it into high gear and becomes very enjoyable. One thing that did pull me through the first half-hour was that a few of the jokes were quite amusing, and there's great gore scenes throughout the entire film. This was evident towards the beginning, but really escalated as the movie went on. It also went from a slasher mystery to a possession-horror film halfway through? Well, I've seen weirder. One part that I absolutely fell in love with was when the country-rap narrator was singing a song and all the possessed zombie-like town residents started dancing like it was an '80s music video, whereas the song was some mix between country and the most stereotypical '90s rap. It's just beautiful.

Bottom line: If you can survive the first 35 minutes or so of this movie, which are horrible, the rest of the movie should prove to be quite entertaining. Lots of super-gory scenes throughout the movie, some great jokes, and some really unique ideas put to the screen. If the writers were a little more consistent this movie would probably be a four or five-star film, but for what it is, I've seen worse movies. Check it out and have a gory fun time! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1318982400,,3404,4.68561872909699
2356082,5,B000A3DGF8,"First I was hesitant about watching the movie, but I was told it was good. And I had no idea it would be so much fun! You will laugh, you will love it, you will enjoy it! It is less scary, a bit gory, not entirely stupid and with good actors.",1311811200,,242,3.764705882352941
2356083,4,B000A3DGF8,"Campy, gory, fun good times. This movie doesn't take itself seriouly and has alot of nods to The Evil Dead franchise.

Lots of comedic moments along with a few decent scares. David Carradine shows up in this film too, which is kind of random, but provides some good moments.

Check this film out if you're a true horror buff!",1301443200,,325,4.491525423728813
2356084,5,B000A3DGF8,"Another entry into the zombie/comedy genre, 2004's Dead and Breakfast is a pretty good movie. The story started out a little slow, but after about the first 20 minutes it really picked up. Dead and Breakfast isn't Shaun of the Dead, but it comes about the closest of anything I've seen recently. Funny lines and a great cast (Jeremy Sisto, Portia de Rossi, Erik Palladino, Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and more than enough blood to keep violent zombie movie fans satisfied.

There's a scene in the movie where the heroes are holed up in the house trying to fend off the zombies and one of the characters chooses that time to confront her boyfriend about their relationship that I loved. She asks him a question and he asks her if maybe this isn't the best time to be talking about this.

""Ha! There's always some excuse for not wanting to talk about these things.""

""I think defending ourselves from being possessed by a demon spirit that's now inhabiting your best friend's cousin ranks pretty damn high on the list of good excuses for not wanting to analyze our relationship right now.""

I also loved the dancing zombies.

I recommend Dead and Breakfast very highly to genre fans.",1297814400,,1174,4.679611650485437
2356085,4,B000A3DGF8,"I just watched this last night and am ordering it now. Very funny and a little gory (think Black Sheep and Dead Alive, Shaun Of The Dead). The acting was near perfect for the insanity of the situations in the movie, like the part where the guy's girlfriend gets mad during a zombie attack because the zombie leader reveals that the guy slept with her girlfriend: ""What did he SAY!"" Hilarious.

This is a really good parody of the horror genre. There's even a bit where the zombies do a little Michael Jackson 'Thriller' line dance. Laugh out loud stuff. I give it 4 out of 5 stars. The film was so good I only wish it had been longer.",1293148800,,634,4.283333333333333

2356088,4,B000A3DGF8,"Any zombie movie made with a low budget is inevitably compared to Evil Dead. These comparisons are often made by people who never saw Evil Dead, conflate Evil Dead with Evil Dead II, or lack a sense of humor.  Evil Dead II featured claustrophobic confines (the cabin), insane inventions (a chainsaw hand), the unstoppable dead that never shut up (Candorian demons), and - when insane invention meets unstoppable dead - lots and lots of gore.

What made Evil Dead II work was that it was deadly serious one moment and then hilarious the next.  Too many horror movies try to emulate Evil Dead II but are so self-aware, so eager to get to the gags, that the horror is lost.  Evil Dead II was funny because after a minute of a demon-possessed woman in the basement stretching an elongated, drooling head whispering about swallowing your soul, you WANT someone to cut its head off, to stop the horror.

Dead & Breakfast has its own goofy charm.  Instead of being horrifying, it breaks up the narrative with a song. It gleefully intertwines personal drama worthy of Jersey Shore with zombie killing. And zombie hicks. And dancing, we can't forget the dancing.

Claustrophobic confines?  This is a bed and breakfast after all.  CHECK!

Insane inventions? The survivors create a series of shotguns made out of pipes, nails, and a hammer. CHECK!

Unstoppable dead that never shut up?  Oh yes, a demon box known as the Kuman Thong leads to the possession of the living, which makes them unstoppable killing machines.  Okay, maybe that's a strong word - more likely partially stoppable stumbling machines.  You get the idea.

Gore? Buckets.  CHECK!

There are twists in the movie that go beyond the traditional zombie battle. Because the demon box needs a piece of a person to gain control over them, the zombies eagerly try to grab snippets of hair or blood to place in the box. When they do, it's all over.  Weird characters you expect to be important die.  And for some reason Diedrich Bader speaks with a French accent.

Dead & Breakfast isn't always consistently funny.  But the pacing is such that when things slow down, we have a clever tune, people screaming, or zombies being blown up to keep things moving.

Is Dead & Breakfast as good as Evil Dead II?  No.  But it's definitely as good as the Evil Dead musical.  And that's all you can ask for from a zombie movie.",1284076800,,2364,4.679611650485437
2356089,3,B000A3DGF8,"When a character utters the line, ""This is like a bad horror movie,"" you know it's either a blend of horror-comedy, or just a really bad movie.  In this instance it's both, but with just enough action, gore, comedy and casting to keep it from being unbearable, and may even more.

You've heard, read, and seen it before...group of young, attractive 20-somethings - Kate (Bianca Lawson - Save the Last Dance), David (Erik Palladino - U571), Johnny (Oz Perkins - Legally Blonde), Christian (Jeremy Sisto - Wrong Turn), Sara (Ever Carradine), Melody (Gina Phillips - Jeepers Creepers) - goes to hick town and stays at a B&B owned by Mr. Wise (David Carradine) where an evil spirit in an ancient Chinese box is accidentally released.

Mostly gore (tons of gore) and gags follow, enough oddball moments and jokes to entertain - and spur the unfortunate comparisons to Shaun of the Dead - and enough respect paid to the horror genre, mainly of the zombie variety, that aficionados will be pleased with the results.  Most mainstream audiences will probably not enjoy the movie, but the bizarre moments (e.g. a severed head ventriloquism routine and a bumbling voodoo spell) should keep most until the end.  Add in a homage to Creepshow and a country-rap fusion by Zach Selwyn who serves as the film's narrator, and it's an experience, despite a subpar script and moments of questionable acting/directing - that starts slowly but builds towards an enjoyable end.

2356090,5,B000A3DGF8,"I have owned this one for a few years and still watch it a few times a year due to creativity of the actors, script, and cinematography.  If this movie is known for any single element, it would have to be the hilarious (and catchy) soundtrack.  And like so many great horror-comedies, this movie provides many entertaining and memorable quotes.  The gore is more cheesy than disgusting.  The scares aren't many... being that it doesn't resort to jump scares, the music is funny, and the lead antagonist resembles a young John Lithgow.  This is more comedy and belongs on the shelf next to Shaun of the Dead and Evil Dead II.  Nearly every actor/actress in this movie have gone on to other visible roles.  This movie also has some well utilized cameos that add to the story.  The director was lucky to find such talent to make this low budget, but entertaining movie.  Thankfully, NO CGI!

2356093,4,B000A3DGF8,"Dead and Breakfast (Matthew Leutwyler, 2004)

Wait, Matthew Leutwyler made this movie? The same Matthew Leutwyler who inflicted Unearthed upon an unsuspecting, horror-loving public? I find that very hard to believe, because in every way Unearthed is awful, Dead and Breakfast is awesome. It's stupid, by all means, but it understands, and revels in, its own stupidity, choosing to use it as a vehicle for poking fun at anything and everything that runs into its path.

The plot: six friends--Sara (Ever Carradine), Kate (Bianca Lawson), David (Erik Palladino), Johnny (Oz Perkins), Melody (Gina Phillips), and Christian (Jeremy Sisto)--are on their way to a wedding. They stop for the night in an out-of-the-way little town (after they get lost, of course) run by the enigmatic Mr. Wise (John Carradine, who is, yes, Ever Carradine's grandfather) and his annoying lackey Henri (Diedrich Bader). All is going well, if weirdly, until one of the boys discovers a butchered Henri while tucking into a blueberry pie. (That's an awesome scene. Really. Trust me on this.) The gang are held in town as material witnesses. But then things really get weird. It seems Mr. Wise has a spirit trapped in a little box. Except that it gets out of the little box. And boy, is it pissed.

The first thing you'll notice about this movie is the music, much of which is actually performed live as the movie is going on. Which doesn't sound all that out of the ordinary, but man, it gets there. Does it ever. The main actors all have good comic timing (and there's a perfect cameo from Portia de Rossi as the bride), Leutwyler's direction is as dead-on as it was dead-off in Unearthed, the script is actually funny, and man, you've gotta love that music. If you missed this one the first time around, it's definitely worth checking out now. Really, answer me: is it possible to get enough Jeremy Sisto? The magic 8-ball says no. *** ",1263600000,,1911,4.817073170731708

The cover also says ""The best independent horror movie of the year"" and ""...The U.S. answer to Shaun of the Dead"".  Well, Shaun of the Dead was a 2004 movie and this movie doesn't come anywhere near that level.

The jokes are flat, often slapstick, but also very often difficult to notice as jokes at all.  The acting is bad (fairly normal for a horror movie) and the plot is basic if not bad.  There are a bunch of scenes in the movie which make no sense whatsoever...the kind of stuff that should've been left on the cutting room floor. If that was suppose to parody horror movies, they missed the mark.  The best thing about this movie is the gore which is so-so at best.

Another reviewer said that the hope that this movie will get better makes it worse to experience...that is almost exactly how i felt.  Except by a third of the way through it was clear to me that it wasn't going to get better.  I watched the rest out of morbid curiosity.  I've seen a number of really bad horror movies.  I even enjoy some of them.  This was boring, plain and simple.  Barely watchable and simply not funny at all.

There may be people who like this movie...there is a very country feeling to it.  It may appeal to country music fans and people who like Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy kind've humor (frankly I'm surprised they didn't show up as cameos in the movie).  The rest of the world should steer clear of this.  If you want more of Shaun of the Dead....this is nothing like it!  Not even Mystery Science Theater good.

It works to a degree, but for the most part the film just comes up kind of empty, and close to being a self-parody of itself.  The story revolves around a group of friends on the way to a wedding, and get waylaid at the bed and breakfast of a small town.  Soon enough, a murder occurs where they're staying, and before you know it, an ancient evil gets awakened that turns the townsfolk into mindless zombies (though not the flesh-eating kind mind you).  Given the low-budget and indie nature, there's some nice gore effects to be found, and an ensemble cast that includes Ever Carradine, David Carradine, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Jeremy Sisto, Erik Palladino (who is clearly having fun here), Bianca Lawson, Gina Philips, Portia de Rossi, Oz ""son of Anthony"" Perkins, Diedrich Bader, Vincent Ventresca, and Zach Selwyn of G4's Attack of the Show as his country singing/rapping self.

There must be a fatal,nation-wide crack epidemic, according to all the 4-5 star reviews I've seen for this celluloid abortion. I believe that a mentally challenged class of 3rd graders could have written and directed a far better zombie-comedy film. I've noticed the pathetic trend of every tired, trite, asinine excuse for a zombie comedy that comes out in America to have a 'Shaun of the Dead' tagline. Well, guess what? Shaun of the Dead has something that this movie and its ilk could never hope for; brains, balls, and a heart. And guess what else, guys? dancing zombies weren't funny after 'Thriller', they weren't funny in Return of the Living Dead 2, and they sure as hell aren't funny now. Especially put to some awful Rap/country inbred hybrid music(?), by the local dog-kicker from the neighborhood bar.

2356103,4,B000A3DGF8,"Before I tell you how to find the easter egg on this disc, let me first off say ""What an overall entertaining horror movie!"". This is how tongue-in-cheek horror should be done. While some reviewers here say that the intersecting comedy seems at times ""forced"", these people should see the Scary Movie franchise sequels again or it's many imitators. This movie has equal levels of horror, gore, and humor all perfectly in place, nothing seems unnatural or out-of-place. In fact, unlike those movies that are marketed as horror-laughfests, this one succeeds more on an ironic level, acting as if you're in on the joke as well as them. Featuring a full cast of ""I remember that guy/girl from something else on TV or movies"", it's shot very well, with not only an incredible sound score, but humorous musical narratives and animated images to boot. This is the movie for the moderate horror fan that doesn't care for all the tension of today's scary movies, while still pleasing the hardcore gorehounds too. This is one flix worthy of at the minimum a well seen rental.

Okay, on to the Easter Egg. This DVD, well put together by Anchor Bay, is chock full of extra features. But strangely clocking in at a whopping 17 minutes and 50 seconds, is it's longest and hardest feature to see, it's Easter Egg. First, select
""Extras"" on your Main Menu. From there it will automatically highlight the first selection ""Trailer"", but from there push LEFT on your remote. This will highlight in red a silhouette of a man holding an axe on your bottom left corner of your screen. Push ENTER on your remote.

This easter egg features some sort of behind-the-scenes of it's first theatrical screening or possibly it's premiere. But this seems to be shot somewhat unprofessionally with a digital camera, maybe meant for just the ones who shot it rather than as a feature for a future DVD. Funny is how this at first drags and drags showing the outside line in front of the theatre, just glancing around picking up the occasional conversation without the person behind the camera actually trying to talk to anyone or get attention for what he/she's doing. Then it shows the people walking in to the actual theatre finding their seat. This is truly ""fly-on-the-wall"" material, sort of like ""hidden camera"" sorta stuff. Occasionally, you can hear separate conversations about the industry and hopes for the film, yet all the talking is blended together, so it at times is hard to make out. Anyway, then it gets to the film itself, cutting to and showing ALL of the end credits (I guess the filmmakers involved in this hidden camera stuff wanted to see their name up on the ""big"" screen). Afterwards you hear through a conversation after the main audience has left towards the lobby, that a planned ""Q&A"" after was blown due to a lack of microphones or whatever. But here's where this long-winded Easter Egg gets interesting, which is the ""hangin' out"" in the lobby after the show. It's interesting to see all these Hollywood B-listers talk to each other about the film and present/future projects. The discussion with ""D&B""' co-star Diedrich Bader explaining why he was there in the lobby yet missed the actual showing of the film is interesting, and I'm pretty sure he had no idea someone was taping this conversation. Still, it seems rare in this day & age that an 18 minute Easter Egg could appear on a DVD, especially one of this type of material, yet however due to it's ""fly-on-the-wall"" status, maybe it was for the best to hide it on this disc instead of proclaiming it to be a ""special"" feature.

Overall, this is a film that any level of horror fan should see at least once. While films like ""Evil Dead 2"" and/or ""Dead Alive"" combined the horror/comedy blend better, this one's no slouch either.",1190678400,2,3782,4.735963581183611

But this film . . . well, it is a REALLY tough call. The cast is recognizable and, oddly enough, lovable! We have Gina Philips who played the sister in ""Jeepers Creepers,"" Erik Palladino who played Dr. Dave Malucci on ""ER,"" Vincent Ventresca who played Fun Bobby on ""Friends,"" and Diedrich Bader who played Oswald on ""Drew Carey"" . . . just to name a few!! So, if you dig mainstream horror or television, you'll already know (and probably like) the cast. (This is what actually makes you want to finish the film!)

Now, here is the thing . . . this film REALLY stinks. The ""cinematography"" is HORRENDOUS! It is as though someone strapped a camera to goat and said, ""Go make a film, boy!"" Moreover, the colors are completely washed-out (with the exception of A LOT of very ""arterial"" blood . . . think Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive""). And it looks like Leutwyler may have edited the film with his feet (if we are lucky). There are musical interludes about every fifteen minutes (strikingly similar to ""Something about Mary"") . . . and it's not just some cheesy guy with a guitar, it's a foul-mouthed hillbilly with a guitar. Not to mention, there are bizarre illustrations which clumsily mark the transitions between scenes (I guess it wasn't enough to use ""Brady Bunch"" wipes and silly split-screens).

It is, at times, funny. It is fairly gory (you actually don't want to watch it on Sci-Fi because all the thrill is probably in the excessive gore). But it JUST misses the mark . . . maybe it was the line-dancing zombies, I dunno. Still, if you are a zombie enthusiast, watch it just to say you did . . . and because David Carradine is in it (Umm, for about five minutes, until his bones are crafted into zombie-killing bone-stakes . . . but still) ;) (And because you will enjoy the allusions to ""Evil Dead"" . . . including posters and chainsaw/boomstick usage!!)

By the way, if you are buying it for Portia de Rossi prepare to be disappointed (she is in one scene for exactly three minutes). This is one of the film's true failings...deceptive promotion.

Some of the transitions are straight forward, while others charge headlong into comedic little diddies. I enjoyed the music so much that I purchased the soundtrack a few days later.

  Many of the characters are likeable and David Carradine is in the film. What more can you ask? There is gore a plenty and even a dance number.

2356118,4,B000A3DGF8,"Dead & Breakfast, a movie that has been proclaimed to be the ""U.S. answer to Shaun Of The Dead."" Well... maybe that's a stretch. Shaun, considered a modern zombie classic by lovers of the horror genre everywhere, definitely overshadows Dead & Breakfast, but that doesn't mean it still isn't a worthwhile film.

At first viewing Dead & Breakfast seems to present itself as another standard horror film, a bevy of beauties and wisecracking wannabes naively delivering themselves to certain doom. All that's needed is an interesting way of dispatching them, one at a time, for 90 minutes, a cooked up lame back-story, and some fake two-dimensional characterizations.  I've seen it before, you've seen it before, in fact I defy anyone to say that they haven't seen the exact plot setup a hundred times over. But... here's where it gets fun.

The filmmakers seem to have said, ""Hey, let's just take this and go nuts with it."" and what you get is a wacky, over-the-top gore-filled comedy romp. It's not a spoof either (an overly tired plot device in its own right) but an original and daring piece of filmmaking.

After the first 20-mintues or so of setup, I was expecting nothing more than standard fare as it had been played straight for the entirety of that time. There were a few jabs at humor here and there, but they kind of went by me without much of a reaction. I was just starting to think, ""What the heck is with this singing cowboy?"" when we see our first death and David (played by Erik Palladino) begins his cartoon inspired running in place over a blood drenched floor. It's at this point that the movie begins to grow on me and I realize that, yes, there has been a joke playing along the whole time and it's been at my expense for falling for the standard old plot setup.

There are a lot of inventive ""in-jokes"" like that within the film. It was obviously anticipated that there would be an outcry of Romero purest naysayers screaming at the top of their lungs ""Those aren't zombies! They're talking! They're not eating people!"" and it is made clear by the exposition-spewing drifter (played by Brent David Fraser) that ""They're not zombies!""

Many inspired scenes of comedic levity are thrown at you at various times and add a certain anticipation until the next big joke. By the end of the movie, the singing cowboy Randall Keith Randall (played by Zach Selwyn) had become may favorite part. His catchy songs with their ghoulish lyrics were laugh-out-loud funny. The Thriller-inspired dance number ""We're gonna kill ya!"" is my absolute favorite scene for its outright silliness.

Explaining the plot would be pointless, because as I have said it's standard. It's the humor you want to see. There's gore-a-plenty as well and done equally as over the top, lots of exploding heads, decapitations, and eviscerations to sate any gorehound. It's a rare treat when a movie can combine the elements of slapstick and gore and find such a successful balance between the two.

This film boasts a nice little cast, lots of familiar faces. David Carradine, who is enjoying something of a comeback, has what I thought was a rather uneventful cameo, until I saw that his daughter Ever Carradine has a prominent role as Sara. Diedrich Bader (of Drew Carey Show fame) has a funny cameo as French chef Henri. He plays up the French accent and his inability to say ""Home"" was quite amusing. The rest of the young cast have had roles from Buffy to Jeepers Creepers. There was no waste of talent on this film and the cast seems to be having an extremely fun time with the material.

I've seen some other reviews across the net for this movie that surprisingly have been negative. As far as I can tell it is because the reviewers got something that they weren't expecting, but with any good form of storytelling isn't that the point.",1147651200,3,3824,4.7040358744394615

2356120,4,B000A3DGF8,"Every once and awhile, a movie will come along that'll make you laugh, and gross you out, all at once...Dead and Breakfast is just that kind of movie. I didn't really know what to expect when I bought this movie, I half expected it to be another horror/comedy that falls flat when it comes to the jokes. After the first 10 minutes I was cracking up! Some of the most hilarious moments involve the character Johnny, and a head that he wears on his hand and uses as a puppet. Also the redneck that sings/raps threw the entire movie will entertain you.

While watching it, you can tell that most of the budget went to the special effects and gore, which is VERY good, considering how low the budget was for this movie. It doesn't really get gory until the middle of the movie, but once the first drop of blood is spilled, it'll stay gory till the end. Most people assume this is another zombie movie, where the corpses are slow and stupid...they aren't, in fact, they aren't even zombies, their possessed dead people, and they're pretty smart.

The main group of actors (Ever Carradine, Gina Philips, Oz Perkins, Bianca Lawson, and Erick Palladino) do a really good job. Ever Carradine makes a good Heroine, as does Gina Philips, but Palladino makes this movie memorable, with his wise cracks, and all around hilarious dialog. Some of the supporting acting is pretty silly, but that is expected, Diedrich Bader, in particular, plays a pretty silly role. David Carradine plays a small, but important role in this film as well. The comic book esque transitions are pretty interesting, and they keep the movie flowing

There really weren't many slow spots, Dead and Breakfast held my attention the entire time! (which is a pretty hard thing to do). This movie isn't for everyone, some people will find it silly, and stupid, but most will find it to be a fun campy movie, in the tradition of Dead Alive, Evil Dead, and Shaun of the Dead. All and all, I loved it, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a less then serious horror movie. Like the cover says ""It's like a bad horror movie, only worse!"".

The special features are pretty basic, Deleted scenes, Commentaries, Bloopers, you know...all the usual stuff. The bloopers are pretty funny! The most unique special feature is the extra music option...it has some of the unused songs of the film. There are 2 commentaries for this movie, one with the crew, one with the cast and both are pretty funny.

Some think this also has a feel of Raimi's Evil Dead II, but even Raimi's splatterflick had genuinely scary moments to balance the comedy.

I first read about Dead and Breakfast from Aint-It-Cool-News. I read that it was suppose to be some sort of zombie comedy and America's answer to the excellent British romzomcom (romantic, zombie, comedy) Shaun of the Dead. Well, that was all I needed to hear. I bought the dvd once it was out for sale and I have to say that it got the comedy part right and somewhat the zombie part. The zombie's are more like spirit-possessed people. I saw no gutmunching and limbs being ripped off unless it was the zombies themselves being hacked and chopped to pieces. Dead and Breakfast didn't skimp on the gore and splatter gags. And for a low-budget film most of the gags and gore-effects were pretty well done. But outside of the gore and blood there really wasn't anything scary about the movie to help balance the over-the-top comedy side of things. When I say over-the-top I mean it. There's a whole sequence of zombies busting out into a country line dance number all the tune of a trio of a rap-country zombie band doing a set on-top of an RV. I must say that this movie is weirdly funny.

The acting is typical of most low-budget horror flicks. Though I'm surprised that the quality isn't abit higher with a few young actors who have done better work such as Gina Phillips, Jeremy Sisto, Erik Palladino and David Carradine. I think the actors couldn't decide whether they should act just funny enough and serious when it came to be serious or just be over-the-top. I think if they all just went overboard with their performance it would've added more to this film. If I had to pick a stand-out performance then I'd have to say Erik Palladino's character of the boorish David would fit the bill. He seemed to know that the dialogue wasn't meant to be taken seriously and any of the scenes. He seemed to be one who was having the most fun on the screen.

In the end, Dead and Breakfast is one of those movies that will be seen as a cult hit on the midnight circuit. It'll do well for those Mystery Science Theater 3000-type of movie nights where people watch and add their witty comments with much beer to be had. I really think alcohol consumption would make watching this film a more enjoyable endeavor. There's not much scares to be had for a horror movie, but it sure has a belly-load of laughs, gags, and bloody slapstick.",1140307200,7,2667,4.54054054054054

I got the R rated edition of this film since I had not realised that an UNRATED  edition existed.
This film is something like Michael Jackson's thriller meets, Buffy, meets ... every dreadful example of film work ever.
There is one EVIL DEAD  moment where a film poster( the Raised Hand motif) appears with the cover of EVIL DEAD, but an altered Title, however it is clearly the EVIL DEAD poster.
The core story for this film is  actually quite interesting. IF someone had made an effort and worked the script, it may have made a very good film.
However, the start of the descent into silliness is the pie scene just when Diedrich Bader's character is found dead. The slipping around looks like a 3 Stooges Sketch, which is point two in the rip off Sam Raimi sub plot.
The continual useage of the singing  plot links is REALLY silly.
It does have some entertainment value, but if this is the best Independent Horror  film of the year, then the crop of Indie Horror  films is VERY bad, and VERY low quality.
The extras are probably of the same quality as the film, but some of the bloopers are better than the film ... and the extended film scenes, and deleted  scenes are probably better than the real thing in the film.

the scene I laughed the hardest. Some scenes are just plain
gruesome. Like That one close up of the guy getting stabbed in the head with a garden hoe and then all the blood and guts spewing out of him. Hard to watch. So, people start getting killed one by one, and the friends try to survive as the town slowly starts turning into zombies. This is where it starts getting stupid. And I mean bad horror. The scenes that cut to the gas station guy singing with guitar get weirder. Expecially the, "" we're coming to get you,"" song. The reason behind seeing this is because its so bad.

I'd recommend Shaun to non-Horror fans, but not this movie.

2356131,3,B000A3DGF8,"Heralded as the American answer to Shaun of the Dead, this horror comedy is a hit and miss affair. It's not quite as funny or as clever as Shaun of the Dead, but what it does have going for it are some good performances, stylish directing and a guitar-picking narrator who serves as a Hillbilly Crypt Keeper.

The movie starts off like so many other teen horror movies. A bunch of twenty-somethings on their way to someplace. It gets late and they decide to find a place to stay overnight. They stop at a local gas station, which serves as an introduction to our narrator. He's a guitar-picking gas station attendant who sings about what's happening in the movie. At first, he seemed like a completely bizarre and incongruous addition to the narrative, but after a while I found myself thankful that he was in the movie. His catchy little ditties wound up being the glue that held the rest of this flick together.

Our heroes check in to a local B&B, which is inhabited by a strange cook and a weird proprietor. I have to admit, at this point I started waiting for the cast from the Rocky Horror Picture Show to turn up, and then they would all start doing the Time Warp. Soon thereafter, one of the guests opens a magical box and becomes a zombie. The movie quickly becomes the musical version of Night of the Living Dead.

As far as zomedies go, this one is on par with UNDEAD, not as good as SHAUN OF THE DEAD. It's got some funny moments, and it's directed in an interesting style. Borrowing from CREEPSHOW, the director did a lot of comic book panel transitions that gave the movie a unique flavor. I guess the director has been hired to do the remake of Creepshow, which isn't so much an inspired choice as an obvious choice after watching this movie. I'm not sure I'd want to remake a George Romero movie, but that's just me. There are some solid performances from the anal retentive nerd-turned zombie and the town Sheriff, and of course the ever-popular Jeremy Sisto. In the end, this is good for a night's rental if you like horror comedies, and might be worth adding to your collection if you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead or Undead.",1136678400,3,2140,4.468030690537084
2356132,4,B000A3DGF8,"If you rent/buy this movie expecting something as good as `Shaun of the Dead', you'll be disappointed.  Then again, with the exception of Romero's originals and `Zombie', there really aren't many movies that top `Shaun of the Dead'.  `Shaun' was a brilliant homage to the genre that is Zombie.  `Dead and Breakfast' is its own entity altogether.

Anyone who has read Max Brooks' `Zombie Survival Guide' (buy it if you don't have it, it just might save your life) knows full well that zombies can't shoot guns, dance, or perform ventriloquism with a friend's severed head.  Anyone who has seen a horror comedy knows that country Greek Chorus narratives that will cause zombies to 2-step don't exist.  Anyone familiar with old-school Kung Fu movies knows that David Carradine will never do a horror movie.  `Dead and Breakfast' proves all of these notions wrong.

If the idea of talking, shooting, dancing zombies seems to you an affront to the genre, you might want to avoid this one.  However, if you are a true fan of the zombie, you might be encouraged by the amount of play zombies have gotten in recent times.  If so, rent or buy this one.  If we keep buying 'em, they'll keep making 'em.  And note the relatively large budget (and quality actors) `Dead' was given.  Pretty encouraging in a time when a re-make of 'War of the Worlds' is a box-office smash.

If you are looking for something scary, this is not the right movie for you.  If you are looking for social commentary, check out any of Romero's films, or the recent and highly overlooked `Feeding the Masses'.  If you want to laugh at a very experimental and very well made and acted zombie comedy, and you've already seen `Shaun of the Dead' a hundred times, you will like `Dead and Breakfast'.  Just don't expect another `Shaun'; there's still only one `Citizen Kane'.",1135728000,2,1833,4.713836477987422
2356133,3,B000A3DGF8,"Seems like this movie is reaching a bit out of it's intended audience, somehow, which likely results in some more negative reviews than you might usually see for this kinda film. I mean seriously, 'Dead & Breakfast' is pretty frickin' stupid, but what did you expect?  It's just another silly, gory horror-comedy.  Admittedly, most of the humor is quite lame, but it's got enough amusing violence to tip the balance in its favor, and it is kinda charming at times.  (Though it's actively grating just as often)  Most significantly, it's got way, WAY too much redneck humor.  Apparently, ludicrously broad hilbilly caricatures are the height of comedy.  Didn't know that.  Also, it has gratuitous dance scene which makes your head want to explode in the worst way possible. (I'm not even sure which way that it.  I don't wanna think about.) However it's got a lotta zombies, or quasi-zombies anyway, so that helps.  Enough zombies to make it worth while, as a matter of fact, and a not half-bad zombie siege towards the end, in spite of the jokey nature of the film as a whole.

Some serious horror fans may find this offensive, in that it is clear that the makers of this film aren't real hardcore horror buffs.  Lotsa the references are pretty obvious and mainstream, and nothing really indicates that they've got a real deep understanding of the genre.  But, ehh, whatever.  If you know too much about the genre you may end up trying so hard to fill it with cliches and references that you'll get a whole lotta nothing.

It's got a more prominent cast than this sorta thing would usually have, as it is filled with people who look kinda vaguely familiar and has some cameos from semi-famous individuals. (David Carradine, that dude from 'The Drew Carey Show' who isn't Drew or the tall lanky guy, Portia de Rossi. heh-heh, she's got real purty hair.  Well, not so much here, but in general.)  The acting is probably a bit above average for this kinda thing, and Ever Carradine is a likable enough protagonist, but it's certainly nothing to get worked up over.  Also, Erik Palladio, or whatever his name is, is extremely annoying in this.  I think he's meant to be irritating, but that doesn't make him any more fun to watch.

I suppose this movie is hurt by the continuous comparisons to 'Shaun of the Dead', as they are severely different: 'Shaun...' is very knowledgable, clever, and subtle, while this is staggeringly broad and obvious.  And, of course, from a quality standpoint, they aren't even the same league, as 'Shaun...' is brilliant, while this is barely passable.  But, if all you need is a stupid, violent zombie comedy, this ill do ya.  But don't come in expecting anything you shouldn't be expecting from a film that has a lame wordplay for a title.  Course, 'Shaun of the Dead' also has a lame play on words for a title, but that is the exception that proves the rule.

2356135,3,B000A3DGF8,"I first discovered this movie when I saw a trailer for it on the Man with the Screaming Brain DVD (a Bruce Campbell-starring, writing, & directing flick- check it out!). What stuck in my mind? A group of zombies begin dancing to the tune, 'We're coming to kill you, we're coming to kill you, coming to kill you..."" and repeat. Wackiness indeed!

 Well, it may not be the U.S version of Shaun of the Dead like the cover says, but it has plenty of great moments and sly references that put it a notch above the crappy horror flicks being released nowadays. For one thing, the deputy in town is named Enus (cough, Dukes of Hazzard), an Evil Dead poster can be viewed in a closet, and a Greek muse-type country singer/ gas station attendant (Zach Selwyn) narrates the film.

 Oh, the plot, eh? Six friends driving in a RV are on their way to a wedding. Tired, they stop at a bed and breakfast in the town of Lovelock. That night, David (Erik Palladino) is having a midnight snack when he discovers the French chef (Diedrich Bader) with a kitchen knife in his neck (and promptly slips on blood to gleeful music). The six are all suspects to the local sheriff (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), so they must stay put in jolly ol' Lovelock, and they use it to check around town. Christian (Jeremy Sisto) and Sara (Ever Carradine) discover some spooky history of the town, David, Kate (Bianca Lawson), and Melody (Gina Philips) visit a hick bar, and Johnny (Oz Perkins), well, he opens a box that possesses him, and he shows up at a hoedown that turns very bloody, and most of the town become possessed as well (but not zombies, we're reminded countless times). So, a la Night of the Living Dead, the remaining four (Christian had a bit of an accident, and now Johnny is using his head as a puppet) amke the bed & breakfast a fortress of pain (nice imagery, huh?). A drifter (Brent David Fraser) helps as well, telling our heroes what's going down: Mr. Wise (David Carradine), the runner of the bed & breakfast, who's now six feet under, did some creepy black magic one night on his dead infant son in the local cemetery, and he captureed the boy's soul in the box that Johnny opened. Now, whenever a piece of someone (finger, hair, ear, etc.) is put into the box, bam, possession. Mr. Wise needs to have a spell done over him, so the drifter, sheriff, and Melody head to the graveyard while the other three play zombie killers. Cue the gore, as there are decapitations and flying limbs galore thanks to makeshift shotguns, chainsaws, hammers, shovels, and other fine weapons around the house.

 Have I ruined everything? Nope. Who dies? Who becomes a zombie? Wasn't Johnny in Legally Blonde? These questions and more will be answered in this equally funny and gruesomely scary (well, gruesome) soon-to-be-cult-hit.",1134777600,3,2795,4.613682092555332

2356139,4,B000A3DGF8,"Most film fanatics will hate this film.  Why?  Because follows a simple pattern that nearly seems tired and overused in most pho-horror film created.  While that may be the case, in Dead & Breakfast, at least for me, it worked.  From the inspirational comic beginning (a bit of foreshadowing) to the slack-jawed narrator that sings us through the motions, I enjoyed this film.  It was funny, it was gutsy (literally), and it was dumbening all at the same time ... but in a very good way!  It was a simple story, with plenty of laughs, that borrowed (never say ""stole"") several of its jokes from other horror films of the same caliber like Evil Dead and Dead Alive.  It was refreshing to see a modern tale that paid homage to such great films that literally built the foundation on which this film could be made.  While some have been arguing that this is the US version of Shaun of the Dead, I thought this was a completely different film.  Shaun was smarter than this film, but that doesn't mean this was bad.  I don't think I would put these two films on the same playing field.  They were similar, but both likeable in different ways.

Zombies invade a town, strangers must stop them. If you have seen a horror film before, than you have seen Dead & Breakfast.  There is nothing new to this story.  I could count all day the number of films that follow this structure, but what gave this film the pizzazz that it needed were the actors and the characters that they played.  I loved the characters.  I thought that Jeffrey Dean Morgan (the one that played the Sheriff) was hysterical and really kept the story flowing, while Brent David Fraser played his clichd part perfectly.  The intermittent use of seemingly ""famous"" people like Portia de Rossi, David Carradine, and Diedrich Bader only increased the fun of this film.  I have spoken in other reviews on how you can tell when actors are not having fun with the film they are making.  You can see their disgust in their performances, but in Dead & Breakfast everyone seemed to be having a blast.  Sure, you are not going to find Oscar winning performances here, but that is not the reason for watching this film.  I watched to laugh, to be grossed out, and to have fun ... that is what exactly happened thanks to such a sharp group of actors.

Part of the structure that I thought was creative and original was the use of the narrator in this film.  The choice to combine the country music with the hillbilly zombies was hysterical.  One of my favorite scenes of this film was when we broke to one of his narrated moments and all of the zombies broke out into a line-dance.  It had me rolling in my seat.  I realize that it is not the highest form of comedy, but just the overall wackiness of the situation kept my interest high and eyes glued to the screen.  I think that is what won me over on this film.  The use of recycled originality, the idea that you knew what was going to happen, yet you really didn't know ""how"" it was going to happen.  Perhaps I was just glued to the graphic nature of this film, a la Sin City complex, but I think it was more than that.  It was the comedy, the zaniness of the characters coupled with the ""borrowed"" moments from other classic horror films placed Dead & Breakfast above some of the bigger budgeted horror films that lure pre-teens in with the promise of Paris Hilton.  This film had little nudity, plenty of gore, and tons over tons of laughs.  Exactly what I needed!

Overall, I thought this was a great Halloween film.  If you are going to gather some friends and want to be scared, I don't suggest this film.  If you are looking to gather some friends, enjoy a drink, laugh quite a bit, and find yourself perhaps even quoting some of the lines after the film, than this is right up your alley.  I would not be surprised if this film eventually fell into the seemingly difficult status of ""cult"" relatively soon.  With the proper word of mouth, the ability to laugh at the horror of this film, and just the overall way that it was filmed I think it will do well on the small screen.  I really liked this film.  I realize that I may be in the minority, but I thought for a smaller budgeted film, it beat the pants off some of the higher grossing horror films.  Buy it, rent it, enjoy it with friends, but I think Dead & Breakfast is a perfect Halloween treat!

""Dead and Breakfast"" walks a fine line, in fact, a line that I have trouble articulating in explaining why I loved this movie.  ""Tongue in cheek"" does not quite fit this one and trying to explain it better might be impossible, so I will just devote myself to trying to persuade you to see this film, which I think should end up as a midnight movie in whatever college towns still indulge in such late night festivities.  To explain the situation, let me just provide the first two stanzas of ""Quiet Little Town,"" the Zach Selwyn song that recaps the film during the closing credits:

""Well, three young couples were riding along,

They had the directions messed up wrong,

So they stopped in Lovelock to take a snooze.

They were on their way to a friend's wedding,

They had no idea what they were getting into,

When through town they happened to cruise.

""I was working as a gas station attendant,

When a couple of pretty girls and some men did,

Ask me if I knew where they could spend the night.

Well I sent them up the road to the B & B,

It's the only place in town you see,

But they were greeted warmly by death, horror, and fright.""

Kate (Bianca Lawson) is on her way to Galveston to be maid of honor at a wedding and her boyfriend David (Erik Palladino) is a boxer who just lost a fight.  Driving the Winnebago is Johnny (Oz Perkins), who likes to count road kill so he can pray for them later, Christian (Jeremy Sisto) wears shades and a cynic's smile, Sara (Ever Carradine) is a school teacher who knows how to make a shotgun out of pipes, and Melody (Gina Philips) is along for the ride.  Then end up at the bed & breakfast of Mr. Wise (Uncle David Carradine) in the town of Lovelock, and in a twist on expectations the six guests are the only ones left alive when the sun comes up the next morning.  The Sheriff (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) makes them stay in town while he investigates the murders and the Drifter ((Brent David Fraser) locked up in jail as a suspect warns them not to open the pretty Chinese box that belonged to Mr. Wise.  But somebody does open the box and the next thing we know there is a zombie blood bath down at the hoedown.

I know the comparisons with this 2004 film to ""Shaun of the Dead"" are inevitable, but ""Dead and Breakfast"" is both drier, in terms of the humor, and wetter, in terms of the fountains of blood.  I was going to say that the British film was a horror comedy while ""Dead & Breakfast"" is a horror movie that is funny, but that hypothesis goes out the window by the time we meet up with Lisa at the Hall of Records and we get to ""We're Coming to Kill You"" with the dancing dead (I like the guy in the back who is two counts behind).  Then as soon as you see the geysers of blood horror fans have to start thinking of the early and not largely forgotten work of Peter Jackson, more ""Dead Alive"" than ""Bad Taste.""  Of course, as soon as Zach Selwyn as Randall Keith Randall starts interrupting the proceedings to sing a quick little song about what has and/or is about to happen (e.g., ""Johnny Stay Away From the Box"") you will be thinking ""Something About Mary.""  You will either love these songs or press the eject button by the time you get to the third one.  There are thirteen of them, either sung solo by Selwyn or by his group Zechariah.

I loved the songs, which explains in part why I loved this movie.  I like whenever the Drifter plays Mr. Exposition and starts explaining what is really going on or what needs to be done because he treats these convolutions as if they were sacred text.  Part of the balancing act here is that the six young people on the menu play things pretty straight while the people of Lovelock and the zombies they become are the ones that are off kilter.  I also like that once you get past the exceptions that proves the rule with the obvious ""Thriller"" reference with the dancing dead and the ""Psycho"" joke for Oz Perkins the cinematic homages are pretty much hit and run.  I caught bits from everything from ""Straw Dogs"" to ""Aliens,"" but recognizing things was never obtrusive the way it was in ""The Rock.""  Leutwyler and co-writers Jun Tan and Billy Burke throw a lot of gags into this one and while one of the characters observes that ""This is like a bad horror movie"" the key thing is that ""Dead and Breakfast"" does not waste time on trying to building suspense but just keeps the gore and gags coming (that would be good gags, like in ha-ha funny, and not bad gags as in reaction to the gore).  This film is going to be either a big hit or a big miss with viewers, and I hope you are a sick enough person that it is the former and not the latter, in which case, start memorizing the chorus of ""Quiet Little Town"" so you can sing along during the credits:

""Well, this used to be such a quiet little town,

We never had too much trouble around here,

Until that spirit was released,

And we were haunted by the deceased,

And now there's all this crazy s**t that's going down here.""",1129334400,2,5110,4.323189926547744

Its funny to a degree and there are alot of humage to other films if you look closely. This one is far better than some of the ones that plaqued the screen earlier. Sure the acting is bad but then again watch The Bad Seed the acting was bad but its a classic. Dead and Breakfast is campy but enjoyable. It's a spoof on horror/slasher film and succeeds. The plot is simple; a group of friends on their way to a wedding get lost find a place to stay for the night stumble on a curse inside a box which was opened and now fighting for their life from dead folks. Its simple gory funny and campy. I agree with one of the other writers. I can watch this one over and over too,only because I stopped comparing and started enjoying!

Imagine a country western singer who acts as kind of a Greek chorus, narrating the events that have happened or will happen.  This is an extremely gory little movie, with some over the top decapitations and other death scenes.  David Carradine and his daughter Ever lead the pack, but ably supported by Jeremy Sisto, Erik Palladino, Gina Phillips, Oz Perkins (Anthony's son), and other capable actors.  These are not truly zombies, but merely dead souls revived by a deadly spirit first conjured by Carradine.  DEAD AND BREAKFAST is fun in its own perverted manner, and it surely beats many of the straight to video atrocities we've been forced to absorb.",1127520000,4,775,4.877862595419847

2356152,4,B000A3DGF8,"If you love camp, enjoyed Airplane or Hot Shots, this film will be completely captivating. Sadly, not everyone is wired to enjoy camp as I do, and some may find the blood and gore in this film a bit much. Perhaps too much. Perhaps over the top, which is the intention, and part of the humor!

This film is a scream, and not because of the horror theme. It is downright funny, if not hilarious, with country music gouls, redneck zombies possessed by some dark spirit that transforms their sleepy Texas town into a night of the living dead situation, and a musical score that fits right into the action seamlessly. Don't stop the movie while the credits roll either, because the last song is worth the price of the video all by itself!!!

I bought this DVD without any clue about the movie, never having seen it in advance, nor seen any reviews on the film. It is now one of my treasured favorites, and one that I will see many times in coming years. This is a great film, one I would have rated higher, except that production values were not well polished. But the campy humor, unexpected comic schtick, and country music zombie theme are a total treat.

This is a movie I recommend to folks who really love camp. Maybe not for everybody, but certainly one that I think most folks with a twisted sense of humor will find thoroughly entertaining.",1126828800,,1344,4.477551020408163

Not only did they milk the 'stupid redneck' character for all it's worth, but the jokes and humor left a lot to be desired. The country band singing during all the intermissions was horribly annoying, and the so called Zombie dance number wasn't as funny as all the hype made it out to be. I wouldn't recommend buying this movie to anyone, if you want to see it for yourself, you'd be better off renting it.

2356156,1,B000A3DGF8,"I will (and have) watched just about every type of BAD movie out there. And for the most part have enjoyed myself doing it. A movie that was filmed with 20 bucks and a case of beer, and gives the impression that the parties involved had a blast doing it...... well that's the kind of movie for me. Off the top of my head, ""Monster Man"", ""Dead Meat"", ""Dead End"", maybe even ""Savage Island"" are the better of the low budget movies I've seen recently. ""Dead and Breakfast"" is not that kind of movie. I do not know who had a worse time...me watching the film....or the actors making the film. I have never seen a movie where the players looked more like ""get me the heck out of here."" It was upsetting to watch. It was very uncomfortable to watch an actress of Gina Philips' ability suffer through this bomb. And a bomb it is. A total waste of talent, of resources, OF TIME, and proves that America is having a harder and harder time making even bad movies.....well.......BAD. Look for your Horror fix elsewhere, try ANY of the Japanese or English Isles movies. Try reading a book for 88 minutes. Walk around the block for 88 minutes. Get a  case of beer and a beat up video camera, gather a few friends, spend 88 minutes making a movie, and rest assured, your movie will not only be MUCH better than ""Dead and Breakfast"", you'll have a lot more fun than the cast and crew of this mistake had.",1126483200,4,1389,4.342307692307692

It's not the worst movie I have seen but I was totally let down.  The previews led me to believe it was something much funnier.

I loved Shaun Of The Dead.  This is not an american answer to that.  Not even close.  It's just a very cheap and silly movie.  It's not even that funny.  I had a couple of laughs.  Not big laughs either.

2356161,4,B000A3DGF8,"This is what I expected a funny silly horror flick. For the first 30 minutes actually 40 minutes i wondered where is the horror and bllod and violence and when it cameon it came at a full force. The humor in this movie is very good and not bland at all, the only one part I didn't like was when one of the guys was slipping on the blood it was a bit over done, as for the rest top notch and great.

 For the people giving this 1 or 2 stars i don't know what they expected or maybe just didn't know what they were getting I did and was quit impressed at how well done the movie was done.

the cowboy narrator appears maybe 5 or 6 times which is enough and doesnt get you aggravted, the blood and gore is there and atually very well done, the acting is top notch thats no question and humor is there through out the whole movie and like i said it is not bland or dull at all. This flick is very fun to watch and while the gore is there it makes the film even better. This is a flick i will watch plenty of times and definitly worth the money as i would expect it to be good as my expieiences are that Anchor Bay always releases good stuff, form what i buy from them atleast.

Dont waste time go out and get this flick if you enjoy a low buget, well they say low budget but seemed like it had a decent budget, don't know how low , low is,but anyway its comedy horror and a very good independent film i would compare it in a sense to movies like The Stink Of Flesh, Sahaun of the dead, the evil dead series etc... may not be as good to some but to me is right up there a very cool original well done script with everything falling in place.

You must have an open mind watching and take it for what it is,i think its the type of flick you will either like or not. a definite classic IMO, and it deserves the recognition I think it was quit well done.

Im not big on horror comedies but this one works very well, just so you all know take a look at some of my other reviews and i think you would say Im a pretty fair judge at what is good and what is bad, if that makes your decision to buy this any better.

2356162,5,B000A3DGF8,"The cast alone makes this movie worth seeing--there's barely a face you won't recognize--Portia de Rossi, John Carradine, the guy from Drew Carey, billy from Six Feet under and Wrong Turn, the girl from the first jeepers Creepers. As for the movie itself, in the first half hour or so, I thought it was a bit too slapstick, but you really have to go with it, because that's exactly what it is--an all out comedy. It's not even so much a ""parody"" of other horror movies as it is a horror premise that has non-stop humor. Sure, you can see some of the horror nods--Evil Dead 2, Carrie, Creepshow with its comic book still shots--but this movie is totally over the top. Think the airplane movies with a horror theme and buckets o' blood. The entire movie is scored with a sort of hillbilly group and a singer who is basically the narrator of the movie, and he steals the show with his campy lyrics and expressive faces. And, if you get the unrated version, do expect a whole lot of cheesy blood and gore.

It quickly turned into a much in demand prize of the trivia contest being held at the Anchor Bay table every few hours.  It's not every movie that features a Greek Chorus in the form a a country singer/gas station attendant.  Horror movies with this feature are even fewer.  The movie does emphasize humor over horror, but it isn't run of the mill chop-em-up slasher fare either.  I was never scared (big surprise.

The comedy they try to use is really bad nyuck nyuck slapstick that doesnt even make me want smile at it. The gore is almost non-existent, I mean its there but not in huge amounts like advertised. This film consists mostly of filler. Too much talking, and rambling from scene to scene. I'm starting to believe that this is a cash-in on trying to outdo Shaun Of The Dead, which was good too but not amazing. They had bad(as in not good) looking zombies dancing to really lame music and I'll tell you the songs in this movie are painful to hear. So yeah I cannot say too much more about this film, cause quite frankly it doesnt even begin to hold a candle to other stuff in the horror genre. I like comedys, but I like horror films better so it really let me down. Skip this entirely and get another film fron Anchor Bay cause they release EXCELLENT films, this excluded.

Sadly, the end result most resembled Return of the Living Dead Part 2. It's beyond cheap and only got funding because of the VERY BRIEF appearances of some decent actors. ALL the gore happens off camera or worse, is shown as comic book drawings. The original songs will have you in tears as your brain is sodomized over and over again by its hack of a director - Matthew Leutwyler.
