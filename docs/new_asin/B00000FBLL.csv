7907577,1,B00000FBLL,"Schizophreniac: The Whore Mangler (Ron Atkins, 1997)

Schizophreniac is not the first movie I've seen in 2010 to hit my list of the hundred worst movies ever made. (It's the seventh, actually, and the year is far from over.) However, you've got to go back to 2003 and Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter to find the last movie I knew would be hitting the list within five minutes of my starting to watch it. Schizophreniac is a horribly-acted, horribly-directed, possibly-unscripted turd of a movie with no redeeming value whatsoever, with the arguable exception of copious nudity. But that's not usually enough to send a movie to the purgatory of the hundred-worst list. This one nails it for two reasons: the special effects are painful, and at the base, this movie is ripped off from such gems of cinema as Reefer Madness. Yes, you heard me correctly.

The plot, what little there is of it: Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who has never acted for any director save Atkins, and what a huge surprise that is) is a scriptwriter who's far more interested in ingesting superhuman amounts of drugs and liquor than he is in writing scripts. Or interacting with his girlfriend Drew (Eat the Rich's Jasmin Putnam). Or just about anything else. Especially since he acquired a doll he calls Rubberneck. After years of abusing his body with drugs, he finally reaches the stage where he beings long-term hallucinations. In this case, Rubberneck, with the voice of Ron Atkins, starts instructing Harry to take even more drugs and to kill people. Hooray!

Acting: worthless. Giancaspro will remind you of every five-year-old with ADHD and a potty mouth you've ever had to deal with in a restaurant or movie theater. The difference is that, since he's an adult, if you ever meet him, you actually can drop-kick him over the nearest fence. Putnam and Playboy playmate Laurie Farwell, who appears briefly, both get very naked. High points of the movie by far. Script: nonexistent, as far as I can discern. It involves Giancaspro running around screaming at the top of his lungs, pretty much, or mumbling to himself. And some award-winning dialogue, really. My favorite piece of it has Harry standing in front of his mirror. Here's what he has to say. [censored for Amazon consumption. Yes, the entire quote.] How did this dialogue not win an Academy Award? For real. (And that's indicative of Harry's level of intelligence throughout the movie.) Direction: well, Atkins knows which way to point the camera, which is about all I can say in his defense.

And now for the really low points. Did you ever see Dagon, the low point (by far) of Stuart Gordon's career? Fifteen minutes or so into the movie, there's a hysterically bad special effect with a fish hook and a rubber hand that is very obviously rubber. That was Oscar-worthy work compared to the effects in this movie. There's a particularly great scene in an adult movie theater where a guy gets his throat slashed. In the close-ups, you can see the guy's hands (which are obviously at his neck, supposed to be trying to hold the wound closed) manipulating the latex piece so that the hydraulic fluid will squirt out. Yes, hydraulic fluid. Awesome. And then there's the whole ""drugs are bad, kids!"" vibe. Take drugs and you will go out and kill people. When I said this was ripped off from Reefer Madness, I meant that.

I have seen worse movies. I've even seen worse movies this year. I haven't decided where in the hundred-worst list this is going to end up yet, but I can guarantee you it will be somewhere in the top ten. It may not be the worst movie ever made, but it's pretty damn close. And the worst thing of all? There's actually a sequel. I'll pass, thanks. (zero)",1285027200,,3706,4.73953488372093
7907578,1,B00000FBLL,"Schizophreniac, like ""Nutbag""( anotherfilm of the same ilk..) promises big things,slick packaging, lots of self-promotion ( see the ads in Fangoria magazine) but just doesn't deliver. Number one: you DO NOT make a film about a serial killer and not put in some decent effects,the effects seem like high school students did them. Number two: WRITE A DAMN STORY!!!Number three: The serial killers companion; Rubberneck, now I might be dating myself age-wise but jesus, isn't that ventriloquist dummy none other than MORTIMER SNERD!?Friend to DANNY O'DAY, who both used to sit on Mr. Bergen's lap?? I smell a lawsuit! At he very least the people making this film should have dressed up the dummy so it wouldn't be instantly recognizable to us older folks! the reason I gave this movie one star in its defense is the main actor protraying the serial killerNow he was very entertaining and over- the - top!! Looks like he had fun doing this and like he can't wait for the sequel( which has been been made!).I could have done without the gratuitous nudity scenes and the scenes of the main guy dancing around naked with his ... bouncing, he seemed to enjoy this too much!! Needless to say I won't be keeping this in my collection of exalted horror films or my collection of really bad ""B"" films , this will be given to a friend who will either pass it on, or sell it. I won't be purchasing the sequel and I'm embarassed to say I bought the original!",991008000,,1443,4.640625
7907579,3,B00000FBLL,"I was expecting a down and dirty slasher gorefest when I bought this one, but it turned out to be hilarious, due mainly to actor John Giancaspro's incredible, raving performance as Harry Russo. He snorts coke, dresses up like a woman, dances around naked, and funniest of all, spouts extremely profane dialogue to the camera, to himself, and to a dummy he carries around with him named Rubberneck (who also tells Harry to kill people).  What makes this actor's performance great is the fact he has his tongue-in-cheek the entire time.  Don't get me wrong, this is hardcore cinema, with very graphic dialogue and rampant misogynism (he refers to women as ""whores"" and ""bitches"" almost constantly).  The violence is strong, but unconvincing. He kills numerous people, but the best effect is when he decides to chop his own thumb off!  The film is fun and nasty, but it does go on for a little too long and the strength of the film depends on whether you like John Giancaspro or not; he's in every single scene!  I do recommend this to those of you who watch lots of horror films and are jaded to screen violence, or fans of early John Waters (who will appreciate the sick humour). Others need not apply!  NOTE: The film was shot-on-video.",986428800,,1236,4.6728110599078345
7907580,4,B00000FBLL,"Well, you can't call this one predictable. If you are easily offended, you will be seriously offended. I gave the stars for originality, unpredictability, frequent nasties and having the balls to put this content on film. The fifth star would have been achieved by the use of more gushing blood effects, there definately could have been more gushing blood effects. Oh, and Rubberneck gets a bad rap as far as I am concerned.",986342400,,424,4.821917808219178
