7879656,5,6304959133,"I love this because of the lessons about bullying it teaches kids in their own language. It shows how bullies can trick and seem to be nice but aren't really nice. I use this and pause it frequently to show kids the importance of standing up to bullies.
There is one segment I don't show the kids because it has the name of a character to be ""Lipshitz"" or something similar and I don't think that's appropriate. So, I just show the other segments--they're unrelated, separate stories so it works out fine.",1389484800,,505,4.5
