5878601,5,B00DYC648S,"While there are some extreme views/commentaries, for the most part, there was a strong effort to be factually informative versus a biased perspective.  When viewed with the group I was with some were really moved, others felt there were extreme views and discounted some of the claims.  I reminded them - it was important to know and understand, to help in our own decision-making before we took action.  More for the critical thinker and not the light mind.  Well done.",1393459200,,470,4.8375
5878602,5,B00DYC648S,"Many of us in America knows that something is terribly wrong, but cannot put our finger on what it is.  This documentary explains how instead of our country being the republic it was formed to be, has now become an Empire controlled by large corporations and large banks, both nationally and internationally, which insidiously influence our government.  Our water, food supply, medicines, minerals and everything else we need to sustain life are now controlled by this vast empire.  And it's not only our country and people who are suffering the effects of this incredible greed, but countries and people groups around the world are slowly being destroyed, as well.  Those giving insightful thoughts and opinions in this documentary are not right-wing or left-wing, but experts in a variety of fields such as economics, the banking industry, history, the environment and natural resources, as well as other fields.  If we as a people don't wake up and work together to thwart this American Empire (AND I DON'T MEAN ALLOWING ANARCHISTS TO TAKE OVER!!!!), then our country and world have only a short time of existence left.  As resources grow increasingly limited, the wars that will break out will be nothing like humans have ever seen before.",1393027200,4,1243,5.0390243902439025
5878603,5,B00DYC648S,"Good info. Probably right on the money.

It's sad the state that America has become. Even sadder how the corporate media keeps people ignorant.",1392249600,8,143,4.958333333333333
5878604,5,B00DYC648S,This movie explains the low wages and stagnate economy for most of the world. Great interviews of key folks helping to turn the tide.,1391126400,,133,4.583333333333333
5878605,5,B00DYC648S,"It is extremely important for anyone who values the future of their children and grandchildren, to watch and understand the implications of this sophisticated, eye-opening movie.

We are being subtly manipulated into believing that the present, unsustainable paradigm under which we all live is the only way.

Unfortunately as the film eloquently describes, this 'only way', from the food we eat to the air we breathe and indeed all aspects of our lives, are totally under the control of mega-corporations whose priority is first and foremost profit, to the detriment of all else.

They do not care what irreparable damage they are doing to the environment and all the delicate ecosystems that sustain life today as we know it, just so long as they can reap their obscene profits and as a side effect maintain an unhealthy control over the citizens of our allegedly free country.

I would urge anyone to buy this brilliant movie and encourage all their friends and family to watch.  Only by spreading the message in this way can we stop those who seek to take away our freedom of choice ---- before it is too late.",1390176000,12,1114,4.81151832460733
5878606,5,B00DYC648S,"I recently saw a ""must see""documentary titled ""american empire-a collective tragedy"" . This film logically and emotionally,describes the down spiraling trajectory we are on if we don't stop it now. It exposes the miasma of misinformation being fed to us as truth by corporate america! It also deals with environmental and financial ruin coming down on us fueled by corporate greed. I would recommend this film not only to believers of the tragedy we are playing out, but also to those who seek the truth. It is a film to see for everyone except, maybe, those corporate entities that are destrying our world. They won't like it!  Lynda jordan",1386028800,22,641,4.8807339449541285
5878607,5,B00DYC648S,"Excellent overall look at our global human situation.  It speaks only to you and I and to whatever moral integrity any of us have left.  The question it asks is whether we are going to stop our collective self-destructive system from continuing to race unchecked toward oblivion.  A very worthwhile film to watch and discuss with your children, your neighbors and your community.",1385251200,12,379,4.984126984126984
5878608,3,B00DYC648S,"To much emphasis on ""Global Warming"" ruined this movie for me. Would have been  better  if focus stayed on Corporations and Politics.",1384300800,5,133,5.0
5878609,5,B00DYC648S,"I don't feel the editorial review does this justice. For anyone who is concerned about GMO's and Monsanto, this documentary reveals why this issue is so important. It is one of the few documentaries showing that the Federal Reserve is not a government run institution. I know the producer personally and met her at a cob-building workshop. I loved the interviews with John Robbins who has a first-hand knowledge of corporate America and find it interesting that all interviewed viewed America as an empire.

This documentary is so important in educating the general public about what's really going on as they will not learn this information in the general media.",1380153600,42,663,5.027272727272727

5878611,2,B00DYC648S,"Trying to follow this film is an act of disjointed madness. While the filmmaker clearly has good intentions, this film is a rambling hyberbolic diatribe against corporations lacking in facts and data, yet still overall boring through the use of stock footage and talking heads. Many films have done a far better job of addressing the issues of corporate dominance than this film. Sadly a missed opportunity to use some strong intellectuals well. This is a film that will serve as fodder for the anti-left conspiracy accusers and sadly it doesn't do much to dismiss that accusation.",1420329600,5,581,5.0

5878615,1,B00DYC648S,"Poorly done sensationalism. Just presenting the facts would have made it 10x more powerful. These kinds of films influence the general public to dismiss this genre of whistle blowers as nuts and ""conspiracy theorists"". So in effect the producers undermined their own cause. Disappointing because I believe there are a lot of underlying truths in what they had to say.",1411430400,8,367,5.133333333333334

5878619,4,B00DYC648S,"Great documentary, coherent and scary with a hint of optimism. A good introduction to how the American political system is going wrong.

5878626,5,B00DYC648S,"American Empire effectively depicted every single one of my theories of how things have become exactly like they appear. If you have the slightest notion that the United States revolves around Wall Street and the Federal Reserve Bank, then you will truly appreciate this film. And if you ever had the slightest notion that our beloved president is as dishonest as he appears. Then this movie is definitely a must see and share with all your friends and family. I believe that it follows right in line with movies like ""Food Incorporated"" ""King Corn"" ""Genetic Roulette"" ""Doctored"" and Jeff Hayes newest film ""Bought, the Movie"" expected to be released this May 2014.

The only difference between the USA and ancient Rome is that our Empire is much stronger and more dangerous than Rome ever was.  Even if you decide this is not possible, you better rewatch it until you are convinced. Our forefathers gave us constitutional rights to protect us from something like this ever happening. However, our new goverment deemed that our right to be free is unconstitutional under their new rules.  Enjoy",1400112000,3,1094,4.934782608695652

5878629,5,B00DYC648S,"An eye-opening and informative and rather shocking documentary on US imperialism. Our politicians do not talk plainly about all these aspects. No doubt they don't want you and me to know.  The video covers a lot of ground, contains interviews with key experts in the various fields. As to the content, this blurb at the Amazon page says it quite well: ""An expansive and provocative documentary covering the Federal Reserve, U.S. foreign policy, corporate collusion and destructive agriculture, weaving together interviews with top thinkers to deliver an urgent yet hopeful message.""

I found it disturbing but I'm glad I watched it. I think it contains vital info every US citizen should be actively aware of.  I like the way the video traces the cause and effect relationships of all the corporate meddling in other countries and the effect on our food and water. Believe me, it made me want to shop locally for our food and grow our own as much as is practical.

Highly recommended.",1396656000,7,984,4.909638554216867

8599086,1,B00DYC648S,"Full of sensationalism. Not at all a thoughtful or well-presented documentary. Seriously, who is rating this so highly? Were you all part of the crew of people who created it? Did someone pay you (good money) to write these glowing reviews? There is no other explanation. We bought it, and it was so terrible, we stopped watching it. I usually really enjoy documentaries and the description for this one made it look interesting, but it was a COMPLETE waste of money. I definitely regret not watching the preview before making the purchase. Note to the writers: viewers don't need images of skulls and crossbones or people shooting at each other flashed at them in quick succession, during the commentary, so that they'll know whether they're supposed to feel good or bad about the subject matter, at that particular moment. Viewers can decide how to feel about the message you are trying to convey, on their own, without all that fluff. Not to mention the purposefully creepy-sounding narrator spouting off conspiracy theories while you flash the random images. Incredibly cheesy and devoid of any hard-hitting fact-finding. Really disappointed in the product, and in the fact that this attempt at a documentary ever made it out of the drawing room.",1420416000,3,1250,5.014423076923077
