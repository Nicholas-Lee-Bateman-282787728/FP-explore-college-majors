But the prominent issue is that ""you cannot read the subtitles"".  Never have I seen such small print, and then white on top of that.  So I had to watch it in ZOOM!

This is a brooding film, music is very sparse, terrain is the mountains of Turkey, and the city of Istanbul.  When American soldiers, unsure of raided her village in northern Iraq, killed her entire family, Cennet, a young woman has no alternative, but to travel to Turkey to find her brother, a barber, Azim, who was injured in the war.  She makes a journey with smugglers, is raped, and eventually escaped that group by jumping into a river.  She is discovered by other villagers and they lead her to Turkey, where she discovers her brother is in Istanbul, in a hospital and injured by a bomb.  Her journey and determination is to find him.

But, a startling interception and lies from  religious fanatic jihadist set to brainwash her to destroy those they believe have hurt them.

The film runs slow at times, the journey takes a while, and the tension builds slowly.  There is little music to be heard  Suprisingly, there is a scene, of all places, Turkey, where a bare breast is revealed.  .....Rizzo",1290643200,2,1326,4.508403361344538
8399657,4,B003LCIDWQ,"Shot on location in Iraq in the midst of an ongoing war, Atil Inac's remarkable film is about Cennet, a young Turkmen woman, who survives a mistaken raid by American forces that wipes out her family.  Her older brother had been previously wounded and sent to an unknown hospital in Turkey.  With no one left in her family, Cennet attempts to find her brother.  With the help of smugglers and bandits, crosses the mountains on foot from northern Iraq into Turkey.  She's raped by the bandits and flees, collapsing in a creek.  Islamists find her and she is sent to their connections in Istanbul where she is told her brother is dead (it's a lie) and she can get revenge on the Americans and honor the words of the prophet by being a suicide bomber at the American Consulate.  Terrific location photography and authentic characters populate this harrowing tale that reflects the wider dilemma that infects the world as we know it.

My only complaint is that the editing could be a bit tighter.  Nothing would be lost with a somewhat shorter running time.  But that is a small complaint.",1290297600,,1084,4.663157894736842
