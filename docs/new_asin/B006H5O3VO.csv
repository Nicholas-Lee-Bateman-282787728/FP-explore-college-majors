8498173,3,B006H5O3VO,"With the possible exception of Michael Mann's ""Heat"", I can't name too many ""cat and mouse"" police procedurals I've seen where I've found myself rooting for both the ""good"" guys and the ""bad"" guys. That would the case in director Eric Vallette's thriller, ""The Prey"", because he adds a ""worse"" guy to the mix (more on him in a moment).

Granted, our ""good"" bad guy is no saint. Franck (Albert Dupontel) is doing hard time for armed robbery, but is trying to keep a low profile. He longs to be reunited with his wife Anna (Caterina Murino) and little girl Amelie (Jaia Caltagirone). However, there's a complication. Just prior to his arrest, Franck was able to stash the loot. Keeping his cards close to his vest, he's remained mum to the authorities. And, thanks (or no thanks) to a corrupt guard, Franck has endured repeated intimidation from fellow inmates who have been trying to pry the intel from him so their accomplices on the outside can scoop up the loot. Franck holds firm, and somehow keeps landing on his feet.

Everything is going swimmingly until the day he steps in to thwart several sadistic inmates who are about to gang-rape his mild-mannered cellmate Jean-Louis (Stephane Debac) as the guard looks the other way. The bespectacled, bookish Jean-Louis is in jail for child abduction, although he swears that it's a ""wrong man"" scenario. You know what they say: ""No good deed goes unpunished."" Long story short: Franck gets extra time for his trouble, Jean-Louis is cleared by the court and wins a release. Soon afterwards, Franck has a discomfiting visit from a twitchy ex-cop (played by the wonderful Sergei Lopez) obsessed with nailing Jean-Louis, whom he insists is in fact a diabolical child-rapist and serial killer. Franck, now seeing Jean-Louis as a potential threat to his family, makes a jailbreak (with the ex-cop's help), and they team up to hunt down Jean-Louis. They in turn are being chased by a no-nonsense police squad leader (Alice Taglioni)and her team.

What ensues is a pulse-pounding mash-up of ""The Fugitive"", ""The Lovely Bones"", and ""Taken"", rendered by Valette in a fluid, kinetic style. Laurent Turner and Luc Bossi's deftly-constructed script nicely manages several converging storylines, maintaining a vibe of Hitchcock-worthy suspense whilst delivering surprisingly well-fleshed out characters for such a fast-moving entertainment. Strong performances abound, particularly from Dupontel as the fiercely focused Franck, Taglioni as his dogged pursuer, and Debac as the deceptively benign (and truly creepy) serial killer. ""The Prey"" may not break any new ground within its genre, but delivers the goods.",1375056000,,2647,5.151162790697675
8498174,4,B006H5O3VO,"This French film stars Albert Dupontel of `A Very Long Engagement' fame; he plays Frank who is banged up for bank robbery. Whilst in prison he defends his seemingly nice cell mate from the prison thugs. These guys have it in for Maurel (Stephane Debac) as he is in for child sex offences. The two form an unholy alliance and when Maurel gets released, Frank trusts him to do him a favour - that is mistake number two.

Then a series of murders come to light and Frank seems to be the number one suspect and then his wife and daughter disappear. He knows he is being framed and more over his former cell mate is not only doing it, he most likely is a child sex offender. So like any red blooded Gallic man he breaks out of the Pen and goes all out `pour la revenge!'

We also have the parallel story of les Gendarmes who as usual start off as if it is an open and shut case and then realise that things are a little bit more messy than they thought and set off in hot pursuit.

So is it any good? Well the acting is all fine the direction is well above average and it has a certain panache, well it is French so we would expect nothing less. The music though is well melodramatic with more than its fair share of in your face drums. There are a few plot holes but they are somewhat forgivable and there is a fair smattering of action. It is described as a `no holds barred' action fest, and it does try. Basically this is a well made thriller but you will have seen a lot of it before and probably done better. If you are a Francopile then you will not be disappointed, but at the end of the day it is a 6 out of ten, hence my rating.",1373068800,,1633,4.04953560371517
8498175,4,B006H5O3VO,"In a 2011 French thriller ""La Proie,"" Albert Dupontel (a French 1996 film ""Bernie"") plays Franck Adrien, a bank robber serving time in prison. What he did before he was caught will not be told in detail. All we know is that he has a wife Anna (Caterina Murino, ""Casino Royale"") and daughter Amelie, and that only Franck knows where the stolen money is hidden.

His cellmate is Jean-Louis Maurel (Stphane Debac), suspected of rape and child molesting. When the court dismissed the charge against him, and Maurel goes out of the jail, Franck asks him to give a message to Anna, who is in dire need of money. However, when a mysterious visitor Manuel (Sergi Lpez, ""Pan's Labyrinth"") visits him, Franck learns he might have made a big mistake - his wife and daughter could be in danger. Now Franck must break out of prison, no matter what it takes.

The rest of ""La Proie"" is a series of intense cat-and-mouse chase between the police detective Claire Linn (Alice Taglioni) and Franck looking for Maurel, with no one he can trust. The plotline of the fast-paced action thriller is convoluted, with one or two too many characters in it, but the film delivers the goods with several gripping action set-pieces.

Probably the little known French thriller has some familiar narrative elements, and Sergi Lpez seems wasted in a comparatively small (yet important) role, but still ""La Proie"" is worth watching for its solid action sequences.",1342828800,2,1431,4.808943089430894
