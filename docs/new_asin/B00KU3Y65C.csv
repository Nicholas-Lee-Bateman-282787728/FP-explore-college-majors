6448463,4,B00KU3Y65C,"This animation is adventurous with specks of comedy and laughter throughout the film. It's an enjoyable film to watch.

The Shane Gang is back and they now have the power and talents of five Slugslingers.  With new member Junjie, they discover that they and their world are in deep trouble. The Elemental Slugs are being corrupted by an evil force and the only way to stop them is to gather up all of the 5 elementals, before it's too late.

Surprisingly, I really enjoy this movie with having all the Elementals coming together for a common cause. The aspect of the film that I love the most is that you never know what`s going to happen next and it keeps you guessing. The action and anticipation makes it great especially when watching the fighting scenes. The film keeps moving at a good pace. It has lots of colors, but it is dark at times. The comedy keeps the film light and it never stays very serious for too long. Speaking of comedy, my favorite character is Pronto (Lee Tockar, voice), because he's funny and he's definitely the goof of the group. He is doing things that you wouldn't think that he would do.

Other voice actors include Sam Vincent (Eli Shane), Shannon Chan-Kent (Trixie) and Andrew Francis (Kord Zane). They all have high energy and are true to their on screen characters. The interaction between all of the slugs is great. Director, Johnny Darrel, is no stranger to adventurous animations, he also directed Hot Wheels: Battle Force 5 (2009), Spider-Man (2003) and Heavy Gear: The Animated Series (2001).

Trust people who have proven they can be trusted and who's good for you is one great message in this film. Trust is earned and not just given away.

I recommend Slugterra: Return of the Elementals for ages 8 to 14. It's a film that's perfect for a family movie night. Kids who love being courage and animation, this is your film. I give this film 4 out of 5 five stars because it interests me, it's adventurous and funny at times. I love the message about trusting. Slugterra: Return of the Elementals is now available on DVD and Blu-Ray. So please check it out.

6448464,2,B00KU3Y65C,"I really really hate to give anything Slugterra a negative review. I love this show and it *was* one of the most original and innovative things on the air. Anyone who calls it ""pokemon in the wild west"" isn't paying attention. But....this movie took it down a tired old done-to-death road that may just destroy the show. I don't want to write any spoilers, but seriously, it was a bad writing choice, and it's created a story arc that's just...too hack-kneed. I just pray the show can recover. I *was* upset I missed this in the tiny US theater run it got...now I'm glad I saved all those ticket purchases :(",1411948800,,608,4.486486486486487
6448465,5,B00KU3Y65C,Slugterra is one of the best and most original animated shows I've ever seen. I'm 36 and started watching because my 4 year old loves it. I quickly got hooked. Must watch!,1410825600,,171,4.375
6448466,4,B00KU3Y65C,"The adventure won't be easy, but there is just as much hilarity as fighting in Slugterra.  Fans of the show will enjoy the same funny humor and silly personalities of the slugs and crew in Eli Shang's gang.  This movie can be enjoyed by people of all ages.  There's plenty of action to keep a child's attention in the 70 minute DVD and the asking price is a reasonable $14 or less.",1409529600,3,381,4.263888888888889

This is the 2nd Slugterra movie. The third Slugterra movie is expected to be released around February 10, 2015. Some of the Disney XD Slugterra TV episodes and the first Slugterra movie are available on Netflix and/or DVD.  My daughter (11) has as many Slugterra DVDs as she has been able to accumulate. She is a HUGE fan! I also enjoy Slugterra and am looking forward to the third Slugterra movie too!  :)",1417219200,,570,4.603960396039604
