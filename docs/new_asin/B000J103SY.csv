2664756,5,B000J103SY,This is one of the funniest stand up comedians I have ever seen.  Almost as good as Robin Williams!!,1204070400,,100,4.2631578947368425
2664757,5,B000J103SY,"Ralphie May is the man! This DVD delivers the comedy! If you still haven't heard his ""Black Movie Theater"" bit, your doing yourself an injustice. Its one of the best!",1203811200,,166,4.566666666666666
2664758,4,B000J103SY,"Ralphie May is definitely a shining star on the comedy scene and if you're a true Ralphie fan, this video won't disappoint you.  The only thing that prevented me from giving the video 5 stars was that I've seen him live, and that was by far his finest performance. This video isn't quite as funny, but it's still worth the price of admission.",1190592000,,342,4.428571428571429
2664759,3,B000J103SY,"Since this was a new dvd release in Nov 2006, I thought that his material would be newer.  I have seen him twice in the last 3 years and the material he used in the dvd is identical to what he does live.  I thought he would have had new material by now.  Disappointing to watch the same stuff when you thought it would be new.  It wasn't funny to me as I knew every joke already.",1176854400,,379,3.883116883116883
2664760,2,B000J103SY,"A far cry from ""Just Correct"" which was VERY FUNNY.  ""Girth"" was way too short, there were no extras, and the jokes were the same ones I heard at Ralphie's live shows.  Really not worth the $15.  I am a BIG Ralphie fan from Last Comic and I have seen him live 3 times, so I was expecting alot more.  I was very disapointed.",1173312000,2,323,4.0
2664761,5,B000J103SY,"The Comedy industry just got turned upside down.  Ralphie May is an exceptionally talented young comic.  His brand of comedy is definitely not politically correct.  It is however very funny.  He will make you laugh at things you never thought you would laugh at.

Well worth the money.",1172188800,2,285,4.854166666666667
2664762,5,B000J103SY,"Ralphie is that rare comic who is funny, insightful, and constantly evolving.  He uses consistantly fresh and hilarious material to cut through so much B.S. or racism we don't notice or just take for granted.  Sometime he'll just rant on an absurdist topic.  Either way he brings you along as he breaks down the rediculousness of a current event or a generally accepted concept.

If you have a chance to see Ralphie live he's even better because he engages each audience differently, like it's a conversation.  You won't hear any worn topics, or regurgitated punch lines.  I'd highly recommend his dvds and live shows.",1164758400,,618,4.894230769230769
2664763,5,B000J103SY,"It is incredible that Ralphie has come up with so much new material.  I thought it was his best yet.  Highly recommended for those with a good sense of humor and not afraid to hear what's correct, not just politically correct.  Ralphie is definitely America's best new comic!!!",1163808000,6,277,4.729166666666667

2664778,3,B000J103SY,"Not as good as some of the other Ralphie May DVD's I've seen, but still not bad.  I'd watch it twice if that tells you anything.",1380412800,,128,3.923076923076923
2664779,5,B000J103SY,"Ralphie isn't PC, but you wouldn't want him to be. Seriously die laughing everytime i see this. If you're not a fan yet, check him out on youtube. The guys talented. enough said.",1367280000,,178,4.424242424242424
2664780,5,B000J103SY,This video is from his earlier material the stuff that made his mark. His style of comedies will keep you laughing.,1354579200,,115,4.523809523809524
2664781,5,B000J103SY,"I had this before, but lost it.. so happy i was able to find this on amazon.. ralphie may is so damn funny!",1345507200,,107,3.6956521739130435
2664782,5,B000J103SY,"It's nice to know that you can read everything about the dvd before buying it. The price, the condition of the dvd and everything else. I like how you can track you purchases and even sends out an email letting you know when it left their warehouse and approximate time your product will arrive. I'm very happy with my dvd and it brings laughter into my home knowing there is someone like me (humor)out there. I have other Ralphie dvd's but this one is one of the best that can make you laugh so hard that you can't breathe! Amazon.com is one of the places that I would recommend and keep purchasing from Amazon.com.",1310688000,,616,4.412280701754386
2664783,5,B000J103SY,Political correctness is so overblown these days. It's good to see someone who just speaks his mind. I hope he keeps coming out with DVD's.,1305331200,,139,4.6
2664784,5,B000J103SY,"If you have never seen Ralphie May you should. He is hilarious. Love this dvd, especially if you like comedy this is one to add to the collection.",1269129600,,146,4.25
2664785,5,B000J103SY,"I feel this Ralphie May is a very Hilarious DVD and my reasonable purchase from Amazon was great too.
You can't beat two great things for one great price. Very funny and cheap for the money...",1268524800,,192,4.361111111111111
2664786,4,B000J103SY,"I first saw Ralphie May on Comedy Central several years ago.  His take on things at that time was pretty original.  While I have not followed his career very closely I purchased ""Girth of A Nation"" after I saw it on Comedy Central.  It's rude, tacky, picks on people whom are mentally challenged, and is just a mess of how life really is.  This sort of reminds me of the late Sam Kinison who was way out there for sure.  Ralphie does his best at showing how real life can be looked at from a less serious side.  ""Girth of a Nation"" will having you whispering to yourself, ""did he just say what I thought he said.""  Pick up your copy as you will enjoy this for years to come.",1255996800,,674,4.138461538461539

8148347,1,B000J103SY,"I first heard Ralphie May on the radio. But, this Dvd sucks the high hard one!
When I listened to this DVD I kept waiting and waiting for something New, other than recycled juvenile and shallow Jokes!
There is NOTHING worth listening to on this Dvd. All of these jokes I have heard from other artists.
Not One Joke had me laughing! I threw this Dvd in the garbage can.
This Dvd is an embarrassment for Ralphie May. His heart was not into making it. He should be arrested for theft for any monies given to him for this Dvd. Even the audience sat on their hands for most of this Dvd.",1459900800,,581,4.196428571428571

Everyone gets dissed.  He really is the best. Very rare for me to laugh until the tears roll down my cheeks.",1428278400,,263,3.9056603773584904
