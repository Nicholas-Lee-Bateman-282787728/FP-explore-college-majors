7840383,5,6303186866,"Dr. Ray Flemming (played by Gene Barry) has it all, hes a rich psychiatrist, has powerful friends, and has a beautiful mistress. But, with his wife threatening to pull it all down in a messy divorce, Dr. Flemming decides that it is time to kill her off in the perfect murder. But, disaster strikes when into his apartment walks a little man in a rumpled raincoat, police Lt. Columbo (Peter Falk). Now, with Columbo hot on his trail, Dr. Flemming only needs to keep everything together, but he has one weak link... [Color, released in 1968, with a running time of 1 hour, 33 minutes.]

This movie was produced in 1968, and is indeed the first Columbo show ever made! The music and fashions are definitely 1960s, with big hairdos and cat-eye glasses, and no jeans to be seen. Peter Falk looks young (about 40 years old), but other than that, all of the elements are there  the rumpled raincoat, the pretence of simplicity, the cigar, and the doggedness that marked all of Columbos career.

My wife and I are real mystery fans, and have always loved the Columbo shows. Well, this one is just as great, and is a real joy to watch! A little more polished than subsequent Columbos, but that just helps to make this a real joy. So, what I say is, this is a great mystery  if you can buy it, then boy it! You won't regret it!",1460419200,,1317,4.407407407407407

7840385,5,6303186866,"This was Columbo at his best.  Long trenchcoat in LA, broken down car, can't remember his pencil, scratches his head, almost out the door before coming back to ask ""Oh yeah, and one more thing""...

These are just a few of the things this iconic character does to lead his prey right into the trap.  Columbo always gets his man and you should buy this premier episode.",1207267200,,367,4.447761194029851

We have to accept it: there is a huge difference between this pilot and the Columbo episodes of the first season. For example, PRESCRIPTION: MURDER looks a lot more like a stage play and still belongs to the TV world of the sixties. But there are also in it a few sparkles that announce the grandness of the first episodes. I'm specially thinking here about the scene when Dr. Ray Flemming, a psychiatrist, dissects the way and the recipes Columbo uses with the suspects. This scene alone is worth the 99 minutes of this TV movie.

A VHS for the Columbo buffs.",1178668800,2,1419,6.834254143646409
7840387,5,6303186866,"This pilot episode is terrific. This original episode was the beginning of one of the best TV series of all time with great writing, excellent acting and a all-around quality production.

In this episode, Dr. Ray Flemming, a rich and highly intelligent psychiatrist, who seems to have it all, attempts the perfect crime. It is Columbo against Dr. Flemming in a battle of wits which is just terrific television.",1106524800,,410,4.942028985507246
7840388,5,6303186866,"For those old enough to remember Columbo was I think one of a family of tv movies that were all part of 'The Sunday Mystery Movie'.  Some of the other mystery types shows in the group were McMillan And Wife and a cowbody type detective (Dennis Weaver ?).

The Columbo series is a true classic.  I don't think I've ever seen an episode of Columbo that I didn't like.

'Prescription Murder' was the premier episode for the Columbo series.  The Columbo character in this first movie is a little different than the other episodes I've seen.  The series creators made some adjustments to the character after this movie.  They generally softenned up the character in the later episodes even including giving him a softer hair style.  However that's what makes this movie interesting also.

The villain in this case is a psychiatrist who gives Columbo a psychological evaluation.  This is interesting.  It really defines the character as far as he lulls people into a sense of false security while constantly waiting for the suspect to get careless and reveal something.

If I recall correctly Peter Falk played a bad guy in 'Murder Incorporated' but I don't think that was a great casting job.
True greatness in a movie character I think requires perfect casting.  The casting of Peter Falk as Lieutenant Columbo was a stroke of genius by someone.  I suspect perfect casting only occurs when the character shares some personality traits with the actor in real life.

For some reason just lately I was thinking about the Columbo movies and I took out the videos and watched a lot of them again.  It's probably a sign that something is good when you can watch them many times and still enjoy them.

There's usually some pretty girls in the Columbo movies and this one is no exception.

These movies are good too because they get into human nature and the good and evil in people.

The plots themselves are totally contrived and would never really happen.  In real life civilians would never be allowed to interact so closely with detectives.  Also many things that Columbo does to catch people are against the law in real life such as tricking people.

But that doesn't hurt the movies at all.  In fact if they were more realistic they probably wouldn't be any fun to watch.

7840389,5,6303186866,"Most pilots of successful televsion series are in a ""raw"" form, i.e. the formula that subsequently works well and the chemistry between the characters in the series has not been fully developed. Therefore fans of the series are often disappointed in the pilot.  That is most definitely NOT the case with this film.  All the main features that made Columbo so good are present here (except for his old Peugeot 403 convertible!).  Falk puts in as good a performance as any of his subsequent ones and the script is superb.  We see Columbo's eye for detail and the battle of wits between the detective and the suspect.  Gene Barry puts in a fine performace as the murderer.  The popularity of the Columbo series proves that a program does not need a lot of ""action"" (fist fights, gun battles, car chases, etc) in order to be spellbinding.  Incidentally, one little item to watch for is the fact that the camera usually focuses on the right side of Peter Falk's face where we see his artificial eye and the surgical scar which was a result of the operation to remove his eye when he was a child.  I believe this was done deliberately because it makes him look a little ""strange"" which emphasizes his outwardly slovenly appearance which is a key to his character.",1013126400,9,1257,4.63063063063063
7840390,4,6303186866,"I don't know if this made-for-TV movie was intended as a series pilot, as it isn't obvious from the way it was put together, but whether it was or not has nothing to do with the quality of the film.  It's excellent. We have been accustomed by now to expect the rumpled-looking, cigar-smoking, affable-but-apparently-ditzy detective ""with just one more question, sir/ma'm...""  These qualities exist in the pilot but not at all to the same degree.  This earliest Columbo is a much more clever-seeming man, with less of the schtick we've come to know and love, and more of the raw power of his intellect and his relentless probing energy.  Columbo badgers a reluctant witness/accomplice!!!! I don't think we ever see that again in any of the rest of the series.  That scene absolutely takes one's breath away, used as we are to a much gentler, more cajoling manner-even with the miscreants [or perhaps especially with the miscreants.]  Gene Barry, who plays the criminal mastermind, does an excellent job as a conniving, almost evil adulterer (...).  He is a psychiatrist, and we are treated to a psychological reading of why Columbo uses his camoflague of the wrinkled raincoat, the sheepish expression, the shy and affable but continual pestering.  I won't reveal what it is, but it is interesting. Columbo takes it for what it's worth, and the audience will too.  If you are a Columbo fan, I highly recommend viewing it.",1005091200,10,1420,4.883333333333334
