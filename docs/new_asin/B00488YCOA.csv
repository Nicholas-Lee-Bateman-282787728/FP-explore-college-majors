4285894,5,B00488YCOA,"""While searching for his twin brother, young escort Paul embarks on a dark and dangerous odyssey through the lurid netherworld of male prostitution and the porn movie industry. All the while he experiences bizarre nightmares and orgasmic visions - shared by his clients when they have sex with him - of a mysterious masked stranger who holds a morbid interest in him... Can Paul find his long lost twin and unlock the riddle of his perplexing visions before it's too late?

Ian Powell's atmospheric and provocative gay art-house horror unfolds as an increasingly nightmarish mystery filtered through the candy-coloured lens of Mario Bava. At the heart of Seeing Heaven pumps an intriguing mystery involving the search for a twin brother through a bizarre dream world that seemingly exists in reflections and can be fleetingly glimpsed in mirrors and puddles by protagonist Paul (Alexander Bracq). It is revealed to him through his dreams and the intense visions he experiences when he orgasms. As an alluring male escort, he tends to orgasm quite a lot! Much in the same way that Cronenberg's Crash used its sex scenes as the main narrative thrust (sorry), so does Seeing Heaven. With each sexual encounter, Paul learns something else about Saul and catches a longer glance into the bizarre dreamscape his brother seems doomed to dwell in; thus gradually fuelling the mystery before the inevitable peeling away to reveal the truth. Powell takes his time getting to the reveal, opting for a slow-burn trawl through this moody, twilight world.

The cast provide restrained and measured performances that enhance the dream-like tone. Along the way Powell's script offers a plethora of ruminations on beauty, aesthetic value, the soul and escapism through art, flesh and sex. Lots of sex. Powell also delves into and explores the murky and very real dangers of working in the escort/porn industry, with the dangers of unsafe sex and the spectre of AIDS ever prevalent. These vulnerable Adonis's seem to flit about in a shady netherworld, doomed to repeat past tragedies and mistakes over and over again like Sisyphus or Loki. An intriguing blend of Bava-like visuals, provocative concepts and unnerving thrills."" - Behind the Couch",1288569600,30,2227,5.132231404958677
4285895,5,B00488YCOA,"Haunting story that really took me in at this year's Philly QFEST.  Technically a psychological thriller I believe; the story had the feel to me of true fantasy/faery tale/dream world.  Magnetic lead, luscious cinematography, and honest direction, not to mention a few particularly strong actors who I had never seen before made this one of the best at the festival.  Sexy scenes and genuinely scary moments make this a film I'll definitely watch again at home and not alone.",1288483200,12,475,4.987341772151899

The cover makes a comparison to David Lynch, sorry, bad thing there, I never was a fan of anything David Lynch. I don't mind strange, believe me, but this was waaaaaay out there and I am not sure what the message was, if there was one? We have a kid, Paul ,who admits he is beautiful having lots of sex to conjure visions of his twin brother, Saul who is missing. He runs into a myriad of characters and they begin to share his visions. This is all about men together, so if that isn't your cup of tea....this is the time to go. I thought the ending was predictable from who the mysterious masked man was to the also predictable ending. didn't like who he wound up with but......seems narcissism plays a big part of this film.

4285908,2,B00488YCOA,"We need to keep movies in perspective. We need to consider budget and other resources available to the film maker. This movie was OK within a certain context. I can see what the film maker was trying to do. I can see the point he was trying to make. Give the limited budget, the film actually looks pretty good. Though I have to confess the acting and the dialog are on the weak side.

So, this is not a film for everyone. You have to be something of a film buff. Further the gay themes probably also limited the audience to a select few. Allowing for the lack of resources, I would say this is a film worth see for film buffs and potential film makers. Those who can view a film analytically and in perspective.

4285918,1,B00488YCOA,"One of the most vapid gay theme movies I had ever seen. The storyline was mediocre and longwinded and never came to the point. The acting was really bad in some scenes. When the bad guy finally took off his mask, we knew exactly who he was from the very beginning. It was so easy to guess. There was no surprise there. The bruise on the lead actor's lower lip seemed to move from the left side of his mouth to the right side and vice versa. In all the sex scenes, the actors were wearing their underpants, even in the ""porno scene"" shots. How can you possibly expect the audience to believe that they were having sex when both participants were visibly wearing their undies! The least the director could have done was not to show the lower half of the actors bodies in those scenes. I am not expecting to see real sex in this movie, but seeing them wearing underpants really takes the cake. In the other scenes the participants had strategically placed sheets between them while they were ""having sex"" This movie, I think, was specifically made for the people in the audience who would find it disturbing to see naked people in their movies.",1379203200,,1141,4.464114832535885

Some of the plot just never was explained, it resolved the issue, but I found myself wondering still why the dream sequences could transmit to his sex partners.

4285921,3,B00488YCOA,I had seen the trailers for this film and was spurred to rent it.  Unfortunately the film did not hold up.  The story concept was intriguing and well thought out but the acting by the young male lead was lacking.

The story telling of the movie could use more polish, some of the relationships that developed in the movie weren't flesh out enough during the film.  However the overall story was pretty good.  The beginning of the movie was a little heavy handed with monologues about beauty which they kept repeating and felt like it was going to be a one note this is what you are supposed to take away from the movie.  However as the movie developed, even though watching you could guess the twist at the end, it turned into a decent movie.  Not a great movie but a good movie.",1365292800,,623,4.2905982905982905

4285929,3,B00488YCOA,"The portrayal of Gay people in film has progressed and that's a good thing. We're less likely to be portrayed as suffering deviates, comic relief or sexless one dimensional caricatures. Nor do I see the avalanche of apologizing and or explaining of homosexual characters any more so than heterosexual characters. This is progress and it's a good thing.

Seeing Heaven is like one step forward and two steps back. Like far to many independent gay films the acting is atrocious to the point it makes you long for community theater and Seeing Heaven is no exception. The performances are stiff and awkward you can literally ""feel"" the actors struggling for their lines and trying to remember their blocking, it's disappointing and distracting.

That said the story here is a good one and perhaps in more experienced hands the execution would have been more effective. Mr. Powell may have put to much emphasis on physical looks because beauty alone does not an interesting character nor performance make.

Because Paul sees visions as do his clients during sex he exclaims during every scene involving sexual activity 'I need to see! I need to see"".  I needed to see something too - the credits roll. Haunted in dream like visions by a mask wearing phantom, we learn at the end with the last line of the film when Paul cries 'What if I'm Positive"" that the phantom now unmasked is AIDS and to this regard the film does indeed work.",1361664000,,1427,4.765182186234818

At least you might expect there to be some decent sex scenes - and there are sex scenes. Unfortunately the pacing is too slow to keep one interested,the characters completely fail to catch you, the acting is insipid, and the dialogue sounds like a broken record. They just keep repeating the same lines over and over.

The actors 'are' pretty, but that's not enough. And their continued assertions amongst each other that 'gay guys get to know each other through sex' is entirely off putting. So much so, I will admit I only got through about 45 minutes of this one. Which surprised me, I thought it had been at least an hour and a half.

That I am not too sure about. He thinks that he is connecting to his twin brother, and it seems the premise of this film is that he is in search of this missing brother. He is a ""rent boy"" and seems to be easily manhandled and open for sexual abuse to anyone walking by because his focus is on searching for this brother. Someone mentioned that this film is about the exploitation of young attractive men by the gay porn industry, I didn't really see that in this film, but I will say that there seems to be a underlying critism of bareback gay pornographic films. While this movie could have been a lot better, I have to admit the eye candy was quite pleasant, however if good looking guys is all one is looking for, I would think that your money could be better spent on a film that is made specifically for sexual titilation. There is something about this film that I found interesting outside of the shallow attractiveness of the actors. There are some obscure literary references and some issues that spark thought. I would like to reference the any truth behind the story of the man who like Jack the Ripper killed prostitutes, however this man killed attractive young men that worked the street corners. This movie has little things that pop up every now and then that are fascinating, but the main character Paul is nice to look at none-the-less.",1307491200,,1515,4.492753623188406
4285944,4,B00488YCOA,"Paul is a beautiful young escort in the UK, who is searching for his long lost twin brother, Saul.  When Paul is having sex with a client, he sometimes gets visions of his brother somewhere in danger, and the visions are more acute the more dangerous and enthusiastic the action is.  When he gets an offer to do a ""tasteful"" porn film with a young director to whom he is referred, he senses a possible connection to his brother there, and goes for it, despite his initial misgivings about it. Paul is afraid about how dark and dangerous his encounters are getting, but feels this is the price he needs to pay to save his brother from whatever danger he is witnessing in his visions.

This is not an easy film to watch, not just because of the dark content, but also because of the quick shifts to scenes for seconds at a time, occasional mumbled dialogue, and - at first - an overall vibe that makes the film seem like a cross between a DeCoteau ""boys in briefs"" horror schlockfest and a softcore porn film. But stay with it, as the plot (such as it is) becomes clearer as the film goes on, and there is actually a significant amount of suspense surrounding the eventual solution.  The camera loves newcomer Alexander Bracq, who shows significant talent in the tough lead role as Paul.  DVD includes cast and crew interviews, deleted scenes and a video diary.
