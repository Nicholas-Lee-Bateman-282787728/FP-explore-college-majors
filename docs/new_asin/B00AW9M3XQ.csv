5510794,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"Dustin Hoffman's ""Quartet,"" from Ronald Harwood's screenplay, takes the middle ground between ""Amour"" and ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" Like ""Amour,"" it depicts the infirmities of old age honestly. But like ""Marigold Hotel,"" it takes an upbeat view of its elderly characters, portraying their lives as triumphant rather than tragic.

There isn't much to the story, which takes place in Beecham House, an elegant but financially troubled home for retired musicians. The residents are planning their annual gala on Oct. 10, Verdi's birthday, the revenues from which comprise a good portion of Beecham House's operating funds. Cedric (Michael Gambon), the imperious director of the annual gala, has commanded Reggie (Tom Courtenay), Wilf (Billy Connolly) and Cissy (Pauline Collins) to persuade Jean (Maggie Smith), a famous diva newly arrived at Beecham House, to sing at the gala. Jean, Reggie, Wilf and Cissy made a legendary recording of ""Rigoletto"" many years before, and their singing the quartet from ""Rigoletto"" at the gala would guarantee a big enough attendance to keep the home open indefinitely. However, Jean is painfully conscious that her voice is no longer what it was, and angrily rejects her friends' entreaties.

There are further complications, the biggest is which is Jean and Reggie's painful romantic and marital history. Also, Wilf and Cissy are not well: Wilf has had a series of strokes, and Alzheimer's disease is tightening its grip on Cissy.

Despite the sorrows, however, the overall mood of ""Quartet"" is genial and celebratory. Michael Powell once said that the only important things in life are love and art, and both are worth dying for. Hoffman and Harwood show us characters for whom art--specifically, the art of music--has been their entire way of life. Between that art and the love they bear for each other, they can go, if not gently, at least with equanimity into that good night.

The final scenes of ""Quartet"" will leave you smiling through tears, but the final credits--which shows pictures of the various cast members in their prime--will have you bawling and applauding simultaneously. ""Quartet"" may not be an important film, but it is a sublimely satisfying one.",1361145600,26,2210,5.216901408450704
5510795,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"I'm not sure if you have to be over the hill (as I am),  to love this movie  (as I did) about a home for retired musicians,  but it certainly appears that way to me after coming home and  reading A. O. Scott's middling  New York Times review and its online reader responses, which seem to be either total disdain or absolute delight and nothing in between.

 It probably helps to have a lifelong love of classical music, especially opera, with just a smidgen of Gilbert & Sullivan & vaudeville mixed in.

While, as expected, Maggie Smith, Pauline Collins, Tom Courtenay, Billy Connolly and Michael Gambon are superb in the leading roles,  the supporting player-musicians, who also inhabit the beautiful, scenic Beecham House, some of whom are familiar faces but most of whom I'd  never heard of, are a  joy to behold as well.  Please be sure to stay for the closing credits where you'll see headshots of each of them  as they are now and as they were in a key role from  their heydays.

No one sums it up better than  Ann Hornaday in her rave review in the January 24, 2013 Washington Post: ""Smoothly navigating the perilous line between insufferably twee and heartbreakingly grim, ""Quartet"" is a subtle, sure-footed delight -- made all the more enjoyable by the fact that it was directed by a 75-year-old first-timer named Dustin Hoffman.  Judging from this debut, the kid's got a future.""

RE THE DVD EXTRAS: There's a batch of short clips of the leading actors talking about the movie and what it was like to work with Hoffman.  But my fave is Hoffman's commentary track.  You get the impression of an old friend sitting alongside you with his feet up, filling you in on the story behind the creation of these scenes, how they found all those wonderful old musicians for the supporting roles, sharing anecdotes about the actors and production challenges, pointing out  how much of what's on screen was in the script and how much (quite a lot) was improvised. (Example: Pauline Collins's request--which was granted--that she adapt and play her character as being in the early stages of  dementia, modeled on her own real-life mother.) It's great fun to go back to the movie for another look with DH's  insights and anecdotes and backgrounders in mind.

I'm thinking this DVD might make just the right double feature for ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.""",1360886400,111,2355,4.72972972972973
5510796,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"I'll watch anything with Maggie Smith, but this is an amazing and charming performance. However, Pauline Collins and Billy Connolly steal every scene they are in! Set in a retirement home for British musicians, this sweet, funny, touching film has something for everyone. The characters are charming and engaging, but the script does not make them buffoons or treat them as stupid children. You will fall in love with each of these three-dimensional people.",1360800000,24,457,5.1891891891891895
5510797,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"Maggie Smith stars as Jean Horton, an aging opera diva waiting for a new hip (again! same premise as Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) who has run out of money to pay for her incredibly gorgeous London flat and so has to move to Beecham House, opulent retirement home for aged musicians. She arrives to a standing ovation, to find that her ex-husband, a few old friends and one rival diva rank amongst the inhabitants of  the home.
Tom Courtenay is Reginald Paget, Jean's ex and is particularly wonderful and moving I thought. Billy Connolly is randy old Wilf Bond, there for comic effect (brilliant move Dustin) and Pauline Collins is perfect as the adorable but slightly demented Cissy Robson.
Don't believe some of the cynical reviews out there. This one is a keeper and will be purchased by me to pull out regularly when I need a little lift. It is not a realistic film (if you have spent any time around a real retirement/nursing home you will know what I mean) but it is not meant to be. It is meant to be an uplifting, inspirational film about how to age gracefully, supported by good friends and continuing to pursue your passions. Kind of like hanging around with the coolest grandparents in England!",1360108800,17,1203,4.621495327102804
5510798,3,B00AW9M3XQ,"A somewhat needlessly ""idyllic"" film about four former ""operatic singers"" living in at a lovely retirement home in England, who have to overcome past hurts/egos to sing (at a Benefit concert) together again. Still, even if economics aren't seriously part of the picture, coming to terms with growing old and fixing the relationships that need to be fixed isn't easy. And this is what the film is about...",1359936000,5,404,4.955882352941177
5510799,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"""Quartet"" (2012 release; 97 min.) is not to be confused with that other recent classical music-themed movie called ""A Late Quartet"" (more on that later). This movie brings the story of Beecham House, a place in England that is ""Home for Retired Musicians"", but more accuratly very gifted musicians. All is well at Beecham House until the arrival of a new retiree, Jean Horton (played by Maggie Smith), once a very famous operetta singer. On top of that, also living at Beecham House is her ex-husband of many years ago, Reginald ""Reg"" Paget (played by Tom Courtenay). The annual gala (providing much needing funds for the continuing existance of Beecham House) is coming up, and the question is whether Jean and Reg, along with Wilf (played by Billy Connolly) and Cissy (played by Pauline Collins) will reunite as a quartet from many years ago to bring Verdi's Rigoletto.

Several comments: noteworthy, this is the debut of Dustin Hoffman as a director. Why it has taken him this long to go beyond the camera I don't know, but better late than never (hey, he's a spring chicken at a mere mid-70s!). The acting performances are a delight pretty much from start to finish, even with Maggie Smith playing a mostly unlikable character (Jean is a ""prima donna"" for most of the movie, pining for her golden years of success and asking herself ""why do we have to get old?""). The movie is correctly billed as a comedy-drama. When it stays light-hearted, the movie plays great, but when it goes for the drama angle, the movie falters badly, and the end of the movie is utterly predictable. (But stay for the end credits! We get to see who among those at Beecham House in the movie were real-life musicians and what they did back then. One of the best surprises of the movie.)

The proof is in the pudding: when I saw it in the theatre here in Cincinnati last weekend, the audience (of mostly seniors, I might add) lapped it up with chuckles and all-out laughter during the lighter moments of the movie (typical example: Reg reminisces to Jean 'I took 12 curtain calls' to which Jean immediately replies 'no you didn't, you took 9 and I took 12'). In the end, the movie was fine but it doesn't make a lasting impression. This is in contrast to that other recent quartet movie I mentioned (""A Late Quartet"", starring Philip Seymour Hoffman and Christopher Walken), which I absolutely loved. That aside, classical music is front and center in both these movies, so if you're not into classical music, save yourself the trouble.",1359417600,47,2515,4.700680272108843
5510800,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"Beecham House, the setting of this film, is an English country estate, a posh historical mansion surrounded by acres of park and garden. It's autumn, the leaves are gorgeous, Golden Pond was never so scenic, and the inhabitants -- a couple dozen octogenarian ""retired professional musicians living on charity -- are effectively in Paradise. They're a handsome crowd too, these oldsters with much of their talent and all of their ego intact. Not an oxygen tank or a movable chemo-drip in sight! Alzheimer's, senility, dementia? Acknowledged but quaintly innocuous. Crotchets and squabbles? No worse than among younger folk. A doctor in residence and a staff of sympathetic nurses? Hey, nothing but the ritz for beloved stars of yestershow! A real place? Don't we wish, we soon-to-be-aged musicians! It's fantasyland, but I'm NOT complaining. The film is too visually luscious not to be appreciated, and the acting is too artful not to be admired.

Bill Connolly has the ""Peter Pan"" role as Wilfred, the irrepressible flirt and funster of Beecham House. Pauline Collins is the sparkly but memory-challenged Cecily, the perfect Tinkerbell to run errands and deliver messages in this musical Neverland. Tom Courtenay is Reginald, earnest and unimpaired though subtly challenged by his own realism in this kingdom of Children Who Decline to Grow Old. Maggie Smith is the haughty, acerbic narcissistic super-diva Jean, to whom falls the Captain Hook role of antagonist. We the audience all know that she'll be captured eventually, conquered by joie de vivre, and join the Lost Boys in their climactic gala rumpus. Great fun! Who doesn't love Peter Pan?

""Getting old is what people do,"" says Reginald somewhere in the middle of the film, and ain't that the bleary-eyed truth! I've seen three movies in real theaters this winter -- Quartet, A Separation, and Michael Haneke's devastating Amour -- all of them focusing my 71-year-old attention on aging and dying. Is this some kind of omen? Foreboding? A warning shot across the bow of my walker? I won't grow up! I won't grow up! Peter? Tinkerbell? Where are you now that I need you?

Perhaps Dustin Hoffman is the J.M. Barrie of our generation.",1359244800,179,2188,5.072222222222222
5510801,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"Here is a cast to die for, playing characters in a home for retired opera singers; they are preparing for their annual celebration of Verdi's birthday. But there is a ""spanner (wrench) in the works"" when a former diva arrives, in the person of Maggie Smith. Based on the play by Ronald Harwood and directed by first-timer Dustin Hoffman, this delicious PG-13 comedy bathes us in classical music, witty dialogue and a lovely setting. In fact the opening credits include some of the finest editing I've had the pleasure to enjoy in recent years. Kudos to Barney Pilling for the film editing; Ben Smith for the art direction; and Dustin Hoffman for respecting the music.

The world of opera is a relatively small one, so it is no surprise that a few of these divas and divos have a shared ""history,"" and therein lies our tale.

Let's look at some of this wonderful cast:
  * Maggie Smith (""Downton Abbey"") is Jean, who always had at least 12 curtain calls but hasn't been in the spotlight for far too long!
  * Michael Gambon (""Harry Potter"") is Cedric, in charge of the star-studded gala, with a towering ego of his own.
  * Billy Connolly (""Brave"") is Wilf, proof positive that an old horn dog never quits sniffing around.
  * Tom Courtenay (""Gambit"") is Reggie, a kind, considerate fellow who is still nursing a broken heart.
  * Pauline Collins (""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"") is Cissy, the sweet busybody who can't think of one bad thing to say about anyone.

Just a couple of important tips: 1) If you have any hearing problems, either see this in a theater that features closed captions, or wait for the DVD with Amazon.com so you can turn on the subtitles. 2) Be sure to stay through the final credits because Mr Hoffman generously included the faces of many of the performers, along with a head shot of that same performer during his or her heyday. What a beautiful finale!

BTW: I just received my DVD from Amazon and it DOES have closed captions. Yippee!",1358985600,370,1969,4.588571428571429

I found it delightful, but it does deal with the question of aging in a fairly serious manner. The only element I did not like was the actor Billy Connolly, who dominates the movie, and whom I just find unbearable and crude.

My favorite tenor, Jon Vickers, makes an appearance via his 1973-74 film of ""Otello."" Dame Gwyneth (long one of my favorite sopranos) sings the aria from ""Tosca,"" and is still quite effective. Her character really seems ""operatic"" and glamorous.

The climax of the film is when the stars are to sing the Quartet from ""Rigoletto,"" and they segue into the credits with the 1971 recording, featuring Dame Joan Sutherland, Huguette Tourangeau, Luciano Pavarotti, and Sherrill Milnes.

5510944,2,B00AW9M3XQ,"I could have enjoyed the movie and the stars if I were oblivious to the horrendous treatment of women in this movie.  Especially in the first half, the women are talked down to, sneered at, degraded, humiliated, and treated like morons.  It is shocking.  Billy Connolly plays a dirty old man, who makes disgustingly inappropriate sexual comments to every women he runs across -- and has a habit of urinating anywhere, anytime -- all of which are treated as endearing, lovable little quirks.  I hated him.  Then we have the delightful scene in which Tom Courtenay sees a woman walking in the distance and immediately starts screaming vile names and vulgarities at her  -- it turns out she works at the retirement home and served him the wrong type of marmalade at breakfast that day.  Again, this is treated like it is so sweet and appealing.  I'm sure that woman, in real life, would not have been so charmed.  Pauline Collins, a wonderful actress, is constantly treated as simple-minded, and I was embarrassed for her.  Never, at any point, does one woman speak up for herself.  Never, at any point, does anyone else, male or female, object to this treatment.

Is this supposed to be some type of statement on aging?  Are they saying men just become more uninhibited as they age and have no filters and just let loose with any improper comment and it's okay?  And that women just get dumber and dumber?

The music is beautiful and great stars are wasted.  I loved that many of the characters are actually older musicians, and my favorite part of the movie was seeing their ""before"" and ""now"" pictures.  This could have been a much better movie.  I will certainly think twice before watching another movie directed by Dustin Hoffman.  The writer, Ronald Harwood, also, should be ashamed.",1457308800,,1787,4.7435064935064934

For the first few minutes, I kept thinking, ""I'm not sure about this"", but after about 10 minutes, I was enthralled.  This is one of those rare movies that I describe as beautiful.  I am a huge Maggie Smith fan, and I also greatly enjoy Michael Gambon, and their roles in this movie were delightful.  Humor, drama, the joys and pains of growing older, the power of memories of the ""good times"", all are present and all are brought together remarkably well by the dynamic cast, the great writing and the excellent direction.

5510984,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"Not since The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel have third-agers had such an opportunity to shine.  Dustin Hoffman, in his directorial debut, adds a light touch (at least on screen) and allows his veteran actors to do their thing, and very well.

Beecham House is a retirement home for musicians, singers and actors in the lovely British countryside. As retirement facilities go, it doesnt seem too bad, although getting your favorite jelly for breakfast seems a bit of stretch. And there is one reminder that most residents leave feet first when they make that final curtain call.

But the old manor house is filled with music. This is one of the joys of this movie; the superb music, mostly classical, but some Vaudevillian. Many of the supporting characters are played by real musicians and singers who still have the right stuff.

Then theres Maggie Smith. She wears her wrinkles like a badge of honor (she has earned them), and yet, she is beautiful. Anyone who watches Downton Abbey knows she can deliver a line with aplomb. She stands at a window where we imagine she has watched the seasons come and go until the money ran out and she had to move on to Beecham House.

Growing old is not for sissies, a bit of a paraphrase from Bette Davis famous quip. Each of the characters in this story are coping with it the best they can. Billy Connellys character has suffered a stroke and although he is perfectly capable of speech, it damaged the part of his brain that censors. Add a little randy and he can dampen a few encounters.

Okay, now bear with me while I do a bit of swooning.  Tom Courtenay is gorgeous and debonair! His character was once married to Smiths and his bitterness toward her is still evident. His portrayal of a man scorned is excellent, in a field of excellence.

When you see this movie, pay attention to Pauline Collins; for those who fear that getting older brings only infirmity, well just watch her bounce around! She is also fabulous as the permanently happy person. And yes, they can be annoying, but here, there is an occasional vulnerable note that makes this character all the more authentic.

The story revolves around the usual scarcity issues we hear about everyday. Beecham House must raise money and is preparing for its annual fundraiser. With the talent at ready, they rehearse and spar. But Smiths character is a famous soloist and she doesnt want to be part of the quartet. She stays in her room and listens to herself on old vinyl, wondering where the time went.

Will the quartet be a trio? There is a pivotal moment in the story when we hear the slogan that made Nike famous: Just do it (Ahem, almost). Whether the advice is heeded or not, I leave you to discover.

We, especially those of us who live in the States, must come to view the third age as an actual part of lifeand not the useless, sickly segment right before death. While there is a certain amount of sadness connected with growing older, studies have found most older people are actually happier than the young. Hmm. Maybe there is something to that wisdom and experience thing? Or perhaps we finally appreciate the really remarkable things in life.

Do stay for the credits, although you won't be reading them. Photos of each of the actors in their younger years are shown and, oh my, the talent in this one movie! Youll leave convinced that making music into your twilight years is not only possible, but highly recommended.

Dame Gwyneth Jones (not so long ago an artist at the Metropolitan Opera) is one of the residents.  Others in the credits are former artists in opera companies and orchestras of Britain.  What a pleasure to see them still able to shine.  The cinematography is indeed stunning, and the acting - frequently without words - conveys real conflicts and emotions.  Maggie Smith is, as predicted, wonderful, but Tom Courtney, Michael Gambon (Dumbledore to some), and all the others are perfectly cast.  Tensions do not stem from diva versus another diva.  They stem from the past, and from the present aging process.  This is quite a treasure.",1443139200,3,754,4.7384615384615385

5511120,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"Quartet takes place in The Thomas Beecham Home for Retired Musicians, a stately mansion in the English countryside, which is preparing for their annual fundraising gala to keep the home going.  It is also a pleasure to see Tom Courtenay, whom Ive seen only once or twice since his indelible performance as Strelnikov, the emerging Stalin-like figure of the Russian Revolution, as portrayed in David Leans Doctor Zhivago (1965).

Now, fifty years later, with only a slightly mellowed intensity, Courtenay plays a retired opera star who isn't buying his ex-wifes overtures when she arrives to live at Beecham Home. That would be Maggie Smith, whose cockeyed gaze is withering enough, even without a confrontation, but the tension between them is palpable. The remainder of this talented cast provides the humor, the music and the liveliness of this old folks home. These aging musicians can at times be off-key; but in other moments they are pitch-perfect.

I have to credit this entire production to the able hands of Director Dustin Hoffman, who is also executive producer. I first saw Hoffman being greatly influenced by British-based storylines while he was filming Last Chance Harvey in London with Emma Thompson in 08.

Be sure to stick around for the credit roll, so you can see the authentic performing cast of this movie, which contains more musical value than almost all American high school curricula these days. But not to worry about the serious decline of teaching art and music in our schools -- football is being fully funded.",1431820800,,1540,5.027450980392157

I could watch Dame Maggie Smith all day (which is why I got all 4 seasons of ""Downton Abbey"" for Christmas), but Billy Connelly has some TERRIFIC and funny lines that NEVER get old, no matter HOW many times I recite them along with him!! The chemistry between all four principal parts, as well as the supporting cast of some ""seasoned""  singers & musicians, is perfect!

5511221,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"Hidden amongst a stack of films lent to us by a friend, this gentle little movie nearly got overlooked. With a stellar British cast, plenty of real old-school retired operatic divas, maestros and thesps, direction by Dustin Hoffman and a screenplay by Ronald Harwood, there was no way this was going to be a bad film.

Set in a sumptuous retirement home for retired classical musicians, the narrative revolves around the preparations for the annual fundraising gala. It all sounds very tame and a little dull, but it is far from it. You're drawn immediately into the lives and pasts of the four main protagonists as you're carried along on a wave of masterful acting and beautiful music.

A lovely, calm, understated, whimsical oasis of a movie in world crammed with brash Hollywood blockbusters. Much like the excellent Marigold Hotel, this is a life affirming tale aimed squarely at those of us refusing to take our onrushing dotage without a fight. As I get older at a seemingly accelerated pace, I find myself liking films like this more and more. Now ... what did I come upstairs for?",1421452800,,1089,4.787234042553192

I love this kind of music, I love the acting, I love the story so how could I give it any less stars! Please let there be more movies of this caliber both on DVD and in movie houses and on TV.  We are so accustomed to poor quality and violence in the movies and perhaps that is my point entirely...why not make movies about real people in reality situations and search for the true meaning of entertainment. I have to comment also that I find so many quality films made in the UK and or with British casts that I know the Brits have good sense and people pleasing skills.

I then repaired upstairs to watch my latest acquisition, Quartet, a film starring the incomparable Maggie Smith and a wholly stellar cast. The film is set in a home for retired musicians, all of whom are in various stages of the downhill. It was breathtaking in many ways. I watched as a caregiver for my mother who is failing in a spectacular way. I watched as a former musicianalthough I am told that musicians are never former. I watched as an aging woman, who still has considerable energy and who still seeks to live and be engaged in life in many waysnot unlike many of the characters in the film.

In the end, it was about second chances, even in older age. It was about continued love and continued celebration of God-given talents. And it was about compassion.

I bought this DVD and I enjoyed a lot, the copy was perfect and the movie is very beautiful and very well done.
The story takes place in Beecham house, a retirement home for musicians with a very nice environment, but with the possibility that it has to be closed for economic issues. Personnel from the home decided to make a concert to request money to sustain the place for another year, among these people are four ex opera singers that used to work together in the past, two of them were romantically involved at that time: Jean Horten, the soprano and Reg,the tenor played by Maggie Smith and Tom Cortenay respectively. The other two singers: Wilfred and Cissy played by Billy Connelly and Pauline Collins got the idea to sing together Bella figlia dellamore from Rigoletto which the had sung together many years ago.
This charming movie reflects how having the limitations cause by age people can enjoy life and given the opportunity to solve problems cause by mistakes committed in their youth.

Depressing and boring for the most part. I particularly disliked the stereotyping of most of the characters as older people with all sorts of mental and physical problems.

Granted, I'm older so I can relate to the situation of creative people who are past their prime but still want to create and give purpose to their lives.  The sheer level of talent in the players, often in the background of the action, if awesome.  It all comes together in the end with resolution of decades-long issues.  The pace may be a bit slow for the car-crash generation, but it is a masterpiece directed by Dustin Hoffman.  Be sure and stay for the credits!",1413590400,,520,4.431578947368421

In fact, I bought it and then loaned it to a friend of mine who also fell in love with it and sort of forgot to give it back to me.  SO I bought another copy.  Aside from the obvious actors, pretty much the entire rest of the cast are actual, retired musicians, of various types - opera, vaudeville, etc.  You get used to the accents pretty soon so it will be fully enjoyable to watch.  Fantastically funny romp at a nursing home for retired entertainment people.",1410480000,,578,4.364485981308412

5511400,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"I discovered this film at my local, small-town midwestern library--and shiver at the thought I might have missed it in fact, when I saw the title, my mind immediately jumped to strings--not that Rigoletto standard which is foisted upon almost all of us at some point in our education!  Because I AM a professional classical singer, with colleagues/friends singing all over the world, yet I had never heard of this project-- that is how I perceived it: An accurate, beautifully conceived, cast. and produced by a most unexpected personage--Tootsie?  I actually considered telling the library that I had lost the DVD, paid the fine and kept it--but my better nature prevailed and I purchased it from you.  Lots of insider jokes, but I believe almost anyone would appreciate appreciate the generally tragi-comic big picture--pulled into delicate sharp focus by beyond first-rate, incredibly thoughtful, honest and sensitive acting--and in a truly special setting;  so organically perfect for the story that is seems almost impossible that it could have transpired anywhere else--unbelievably realistic.

Yet again, we were delighted with her and the movie and enjoyed it from beginning to end. Having seen the movie, I then decided to go to the Amazon reviews of the movie and found several excellent reviews that capture the spirit of the movie; I'll limit my comments to our personal experience with the movie and the things that made the movie so charming to us and may make it charming to you too.

If you have a love for classical music and enjoyed some level of performance of music then I think you'll love this story. It brought back so many memories of my youth and my early dreams of being a classical musician. The sound of music being played in unexpected places and times brought back memories of school and the practice rooms where students practiced their instruments.

The movie is thoroughly enjoyable and offers great acting, beautiful scenery, and beautiful music all packaged together in a very professional package that really leaves nothing out.

This is a film for the entire family, especially the musically inclined family, and provides a delightfully charming evening's entertainment. I recommend it highly!",1403308800,,1300,4.846846846846847

5511590,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"4* for the movie, 5* for the Director's Commentary.  The film is based on a play which moves at a leisurely pace, always charming to watch, but with less energy than we're used to.  Gotta love a movie with Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Billy Connolly and Pauline Collins -each a pro and enjoyable to watch. The hidden surprise with this disc is the commentary by first time Director Dustin Hoffman. It's Dustin Hoffman's generous spirit and loving care for his team in its setting that makes the commentary even more a riff on our mutual humanity than the screenplay is.  Buy this for Dustin Hoffman and also enjoy the film.",1402444800,,623,4.6454545454545455

Maybe in Europe there are retirement homes like this but here in the US most ALFs are not.

Both funny and sad, it shows the downside of growing old when your talents and accomplishments are not as accepted as they once were.

5511738,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"If you thought ""Amour"" was too bleak, with its unvarnished portrayal of the ravages of age on a pair of cultured French musicians, first-time (!) director Dustin Hoffman's "" Quartet"" offers the perfect tune to soothe the mature target audience!
A lulling, aspirational fantasy with many comedic highlights presents aging, cultured Englishfolk (and one randy Scot, played by Billy Connolly) living out their golden years in a beautifully manicured home for retired musical artists. Every vista suggests that physical and mental infirmities belong in some other film, and that the manor house used to depict Dalton Abbey is next door. The arrival of a famous opera diva [Maggie Smith, complete with trills and her notorious one-line squelches!] upsets the idyllic harmony, especially for her ex-husband {Tom Courtenay]. The cast is populated with real singers and instrumentalists of years-gone-by, along with Michael Gambon as the impresario who organizes a benefit gala performance to save the home from closing. Verdi's immortal quartet from the 3rd act of Rigoletto ['Bella figlia del'amore'] is the titular selection around which the plot revolves. This is a classic to be cherished not only by music-lovers, but by anyone who appreciates wit and spontaneity, conducted at a pleasant tempo.",1396742400,,1293,5.405940594059406
5511739,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"The questions I apply after watching a film include; was it a great story, wonderfully told, superbly acted, very well directed, with top-of-the-line production values? ""Quartet"" checks all of the boxes in bold strokes!

The cast brings the nuances of the characters to the surface throughout and just when you thought you had a person on the screen pegged as this or that, a new facet is unveiled and you enjoy the mental action of incorporating that newness into the piece. That level of film making is very hard to achieve in an ensemble and even harder to maintain throughout.

Their characters  are determined to remain relevant and stay connected to the arts that they strove to master in their younger years.  In addition, the music chosen to enhance the story is wonderful. Inspired by the real life Casa di Riposo per Musicisti, founded by Giuseppe Verdi, it makes one wonder why no one has tried to establish a residence for older dancers.",1395878400,,593,4.9

5511789,2,B00AW9M3XQ,"My heart sinks when I see there's another ""heart-warming"" movie or TV drama featuring great older actors and set in a retirement home, or in a group situation that resembles one - especially when a favourite actor happens to be one of them. I can only imagine how much further the actors' hearts must sink when they receive yet another script of this kind. This story is about musicians, and yet many, including singers, maintain respected careers as coaches and teachers after retirement from performing, and for the rest of their lives (even leaving aside how ridiculous it would be to see Placido Domingo in this kind of setting). None of the actors in this depressingly predictable film - and certainly not Dustin Hoffman himself - are in the least pathetic in real life, whatever ages they have reached. Can't film-makers just allow us to see and enjoy older actors in the incredible variety of settings and relationships that real life offers, in dilemmas they share with the rest of humanity, and resist the temptation constantly to line them up and observe them as stereotypes from a different world, ""old age""? Like all actors, they need the work that comes their way, but they themselves are successful, hardworking, inspiring to younger people in their profession and with admiring fans - and yet how few scripts include older characters who are simply working productively in more ordinary jobs or otherwise engaged in the wider community, let alone still at the top of their game in a demanding industry and doing work they love. I'm waiting for movie-makers to catch up, and meanwhile, the next retirement home movie that comes along I plan to ignore, even if Maggie Smith has felt obliged to be in it.",1395619200,2,1716,4.840136054421769

The lovely doctor grins.  The Setting: Beecham House, home for retired and quite famous English opera singers and musicians.  The Plot:  Through a thickening mist of dementia, the director attempts to rehearse and assemble a program centering on the quartet sung in ""Rigoletto.""  All these huge egos, the veiled insults and snips, huffing, laughing at each other's foibles, but truly with artistic love and feeling for each resident's musical gifts, this little film,  beautifully and sensitively directed by Dustin Hoffman, tells anyone with a soul why--why oh why---music, both instrumental and vocal, should be required subjects in all our schools.

The music, of course, is superb.  One thing I loved, which a commentator somewhere considered a ""goof"", was this: the movie ends with the quartet singing, which we only hear from a distance as the camera pans back away from the gorgeous building and the sky grows ever darker. The reviewer couldn't understand why there were suddenly no cars in the parking lot which had been filled at the concert's beginning. How could such a touching metaphor be seen as an error?

Three members of a renowned operatic quartet reside at the home, and the sparks begin to fly when Maggie Smith, as Jean Horton, the fourth and grand diva member of the quartet, arrives to live at Thomas Beecham. She had previously been married to one of the quartet, Reg, and their meeting is bittersweet. Faced with dwindling finances, Jean is forced to give up a spacious home to move to Thomas Beecham. It is not an easy pill to swallow. However, she is welcomed with an ovation from the other residents who remember and esteem her voice and musicianship. The quartet were renowned for their rendition of Verdi's Rigoletto, and the remaining members want to sing the quartet from Rigoletto for the gala. Jean, however, is broken in spirit and body, and not confident that her once golden voice will only embarrass her further.

I will not divulge the remainder of the plot, suffice to say that this little gem of a movie, one of the best movies I have ever seen. This movie is heartwarming in its portrayal of our senior citizens, especially musicians, as the joints ache and bones creak, the reed players air support is not there, the singers' voices not as fluidly beautiful as in their heyday. But they are making do, as their life long love of music and their determination to present the show keeps them going.

Especially heartwarming is that the members of Thomas Beecham all truly care for each other, and the ""youngsters"", the doctors and workers at the home, play second fiddle to this remarkable group, but one senses that the workers adore them. Billy Connolly is hysterically funny, a standout, as a member of the quartet who is the resident ""dirty old man"" and witty raconteur, keeping up the morale of the members of Thomas Beecham Home. The finale, as the members are set to perform, and come alive at the sound of the applause of the audience, will move you to tears.

In all, a truly wonderful movie that casts a spell of warmth, humor and charm. It is also a tribute to the human spirit. I urge you to get it and see for yourself.",1393459200,,2550,4.530434782608696

5511883,4,B00AW9M3XQ,I do love the Brits. They know how to craft a storyline and people it with rich characters and then they employ superb artisans. This is one of those movies that I tend to gift.,1393372800,,177,4.085714285714285

5511885,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"No complaints about condition or mailing.  Liked the story and the actors. Anything with Maggie Smith will get my interest but I will read reviews and these were good. Those of you like me who are thirsting for something not geared toward 17-25 year old boys will appreciate a film with no cursing, bathroom humour, graphic sex or violence.",1393113600,,340,4.762711864406779
5511896,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"This is a excellent movie about the world of ageing Opera singers and musicians and what happens to them after they retire.

 It reminds me of the Itialian movie ""Tosca's Kiss"" or ""ll Bacio di Tosca"".

The cast is the best English actors and actresses around and the wonderfully sensitive and poignant story will bring tears to your eyes.",1392940800,,338,4.694915254237288
5511897,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"I'm just a 'huge' fan of Maggie Smith, so there is probably no movie she's in that I won't like.  Being retired myself, it's refreshing to see movies like this that show life in our 'golden years'.",1392940800,,197,4.324324324324325
5511898,1,B00AW9M3XQ,"I kept looking for a knife to open my veins for the first half hour of the movie. Beautiful scenery, wonderful settings, but it doesn't turn into a wonderful story...at least for me. The grounds are magnificent; it reminds me of Ettington Park at Avon-on-Stafford, only smaller. (Great bed & breakfast, by the way.) I suppose if one must grow old, a nice British, Irish, or Scottish mansion is the way to go, not some squalid U.S. old folks home that feeds its residents stale cheesecake and a medley of bland carbohydrates with no protein -- but that's another movie. Alas, this movie takes some elegant actors, incredible cinematography, great saturation of colors and makes the script appear more as a stage production than what real people would say in actual situations. Yes, I know it's adapted from a stage production, but it shouldn't be so obvious. Where the actors stood, the way they interacted, I never lost sight of the fact that the people were actors. Perhaps that's what happens when actors play performers. I did enjoy the ending, not only for the music but because it was the ending. My wife kept asking throughout the film if it was halfway over, but I'll let her write her own review.",1392681600,7,1204,4.710900473933649

5511900,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"This was a very interesting film about musicians no longer able to practice their art to the fullest, only on a very limited basis.  When you are young, you think you will go on forever at the same pace and intensity.  However, life and age catch up and make you slow down.  Sometimes you're not even  sorry that it is so.  The interview with Dustin Hoffman and the background of the shooting of the movie were captivating.

I loved this movie not just for its story but also for the wonderful music performed by the ""residents"" of a rest home for aged musicians. The opera stars played by the actors don't actually sing, so no dubbing is necessary - a recording supposed to be made when they were in their prime is played as background.

And I've never before cried at the credits after a movie - don't leave before the credits on this one.",1392249600,,513,4.4

People exhibiting Alzheimers , diminished abilities, or frustration due to the effect of aging...did not make me smile, it made me sad. It seemed to me to be a glaring tragedy to show that talent will  wane because the body will become unable to sustain it. yes we must cheer for those who make the best of it and try to enjoy what is left to us that we can do.

5512129,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"What a great movie with lots of heart and excellent performances by all. It's amazing that the elder singers and musicians did so well in their 1st time acting in a movie about older Opera singers and musicians living in a home in England giving an annual performance. When hearing the 75-95 year olds sing and play instruments I thought at 1st that it was dubbed in, but later upon further investigation by checking out the commentaries from the very able and youthful 76 year old director Dustin Hoffman, I found out that they were surprisingly actual performances by elder former stars. In fact there are many memorable Operatic and instrumental performances including a 76 year old lady who incredibly sings like a 26 year old. I'm really not into Opera music but this deeply heartfelt movie was a very pleasant exception. The commentaries enlightened me that these former celebrities hadn't had a phone call in over 20 years and enthusiastically showed up for rehearsal at 6 in the morning instead of 12 noon. This is a fantastic moving movie with no violence and lots of passion worth seeing.",1388275200,,1098,4.814814814814815

5512289,1,B00AW9M3XQ,"I wanted to like this movie since Maggie Smith is one of my favorite actors. But this movie developed too slowly while at the same time having an erratic flow of the development of a romantic relationship between the main characters. I hoped it would be wittier, but it was just plain boring. I think Dustin Hoffman set out to direct a movie specific to opera lovers. No, wait.  Old opera lovers. The final performance was anticlimactic. Kudos to the cameos by actual musicians and singers, but their importance was lost on me since I don't know the genre.  Didn't like this one.

The ensemble cast of this story complement each other as only British actors can I think. What I love about British actors is their quiet professionalism. Each of them is instantly recognizable and have appeared together in other films. If there is one jarring moment, its hearing Maggie Smith deliver the ""F bomb"" which she does with great conviction and yet its so ""in the moment"" one hardly realizes that ""Professor McGonagall just let fly in front of Headmaster Dumbledore"".

This is a well crafted story of a gracious retirement home for down on their luck theater folk set in a gorgeous British countryside.",1383955200,,816,4.73943661971831

5512343,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"Dustin Hoffmans directorial debut is adapted from a play by Ronald Harwood about a retirement home for aging musicians.  Many supporting roles are played by musicians who do perform.  My major disappointment is that Hoffman didn't cast top flight aging opera singers in the quartet.  But then, most singers probably wouldnt be willing to perform past their retirement, and the quality of Verdis glorious Rigoletto quartet, which is the movies finale, would suffer.  Since I love musicians and fine music, I reveled in the film.

5512357,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"This is a fairly unremarkable plot with somewhat stock characters but nevertheless, the movie is very watchable. I think perhaps this is because despite the story and characters not being novel, the acting is phenomenal and story mostly plausible. The male lead, Tom Courtenay, was in Dr Zhivago as the young poet revolutionary Pasha. We recently rewatched Dr. Zhivago on the big screen and I was impressed with the actor and once again, he does a fantastic job with this role. Trivia: This is the 2nd time Maggie Smith has been in a movie named ""Quartet"". Long career or not, how often does that happen?",1383436800,,604,4.761904761904762

It was hard for me to accept the truth that this was Dustin Hoffman's debut as a director. (Be sure to take the time after you watch the movie to also watch his commentary regarding the making of the movie -- such things as off-the-script moments that he kept in the film, for instance. Years ago I watched a documentary about Verdi House in Italy, a retirement home for impoverished retired opera singers established by the great Verdi himself, so I was not surprised to learn it played a part in the story behind this film.)

This is a beautiful, touching, tender, very human tribute to the human condition. As far as I could see, there wasn't a false step anywhere, even in the smallest bit part. And the main characters? Simply wonderful.

A first-class delight in all respects.",1383177600,3,964,4.528735632183908

The fact that the story is based on the true story of Verdi's real life story, makes the film even more charming. I applaud Dustin Hoffman for finding this story, and for taking the time to hire a fabulous cast to bring this worthwhile story to screen with exquisite grace.

What a joy to watch this cast, most of which were former vocalists, singers and musicians. Billy Connolly is a unique, gifted actor, has an impeccable sense of the special nuances within scenes, he is extraordinary. The music of course, is fabulous. Lastly, the message of this film is for all ages. Hoffman and this cast succeed in showing vitality, charisma, respect, love and values are still strong in those in their golden years, and we of the younger set should take notice. There is much to learn from them and most off all...appreciate who they are.",1382227200,,649,4.752212389380531

The story is first rate, the characters are real and believable, and the movie was put together very nicely by first time director Dustin Hoffman.

I decided to buy a copy because I enjoyed it so much.  I also enjoyed very much sitting through the commentary of Dustin Hoffman because I was able to hear how the film was put together.

5512460,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"I would be hard-pressed to choose whether this exceptional piece is due to the outstanding cast (some of whom are not professional actors), the sensitive direction of Dustin Hoffman, the story (loosely based on such a ""retirement"" home in Italy), the representation of people come to retirement homes and the sensitive depiction of someone dealing with Alzheimers...  None of this is ever far removed from the wonderful music selections which linger long after the movie has finished.  And speaking of a finish, be sure to watch all of the credits as in the credits are pictures of the real-life people who have parts in the movie.  The pictures alongside their credits reveal a brief bio of their ""real life"" occupations and contribution to the world of music while they were in their prime.  I could go on and on and on.

Billy Connolly is perfect as the smart-ass whose filters are all gone, Pauline Collins is equal parts funny and heartbreaking as a ditzy diva, and Maggie Smith is wonderful, as always, as the opera star come-down-in-the-world. Michael Gambon was very funny as the reigning boss of everyone. I didn't know Dustin Hoffman was the director until I saw the credits. Well-directed, well-acted, and the setting was beautiful.",1380585600,,547,5.2272727272727275

The ""artiste"" personalities were wonderfully varied and believable--not a stereotype in sight.  Talented actors played flawed human beings but managed at the same time to make the characters sympathetic. A nice surprise was seeing the tribute paid to the artistic achievements of aged-but-living, highly gifted musicians.",1380499200,,455,5.676470588235294

They are all quite surprised when the fourth person of their former quartet - Reggie's ex-wife Jean (Maggie Smith) - becomes a new resident.

The story was not good, hard to follow and disappointing in the end. It was also unfortunate that the ""F"" word was used in an other wise fairly clean language movie.

I have to admit however, the movie blurs the edges and lightens the indignities of growing old.  I have always dreaded the onset of the ""vegetable patch"" for me, but I would not mind this one; rather I would relish it.  Perhaps as I grow ever closer, a film such as this might act as an inspiration.  Maggie Smith does her usual larceny of the best acerbic lines.  Pauline Collins does a charming Alzheimer's which is aspirational. Actually there is no not a bad apple in this magnificent cast.  Just watch it.",1379721600,,623,4.412280701754386

I appreciated being introduced to the possibilities of their autumn/winter years.  The home and grounds were beautiful, the background music was lovely and usually familiar, and I thought the characters were very believable considering their fame and their talents.  I especially loved Pauline Collins' adorable character, and I couldn't stop thinking that Tom Courtenay played Pasha in Dr. Zhivago (in the 60s) - great then and now.  In my opinion, this movie would not appeal to the majority.  Interests would include:  classical music lovers, serious love stories, retirees, and serious musicians.  It would only appeal to the younger generations who themselves prefer classical music and serious themes.",1379462400,,806,5.451612903225806

After I saw it, I thought, ""well, that was sort of blah"" but Maggie Smith was great as always.  I really liked the interplay between all the ""characters"" in the musician's retirement home.  These were high-powered, professional musicians at the end of their careers, but their love of music still shines through.  For that alone, it was worth the price.  Also loved the fact that the minor characters were real musicians and you have to hang in there and watch the credits to see that most of them were very successful in their careers.",1379116800,,622,4.618181818181818

To have it happen in a retirement center for has-been musicians was the icing on the cake.  I told my friends watching it, ""If I get like Maggie Smith's character in my old age, just put me out of my misery as quickly as possible.""  In the end, of course, Maggie Smith comes through.  Then again, she could read a grocery list and I would think she should get an Oscar for it!  Fortunately, she didn't try to sing!",1378684800,,504,4.208333333333333

5512699,3,B00AW9M3XQ,"I've heard raves about this film and was curious to form my own opinion.  But as a great fan of Maggie Smith I was most disappointed in what I think is her least interesting role to date.  When someone is as bitter and haughty as her character, the viewer would like a reason, but none is given here.  Of the 4 main characters, the only one who didn't come across as a complete fool was Tom Courtenay, who plays her ex-husband.  Billy Connelly, as the randy stoke survivor, and obvious comic relief, even started to get obnoxious after a while.

Sadly, I blame this on Dustin Hoffman, who was a first time director of the film.  The gimmicks felt like American film gimmicks and turned what could have been a great film into a mediocre one.  ( I really don't need to watch Maggie Smith say the F word, either.)

The best part was the credits, because you see the older and newer shots of all the supporting actors, most of whom have histories in opera productions and orchestras from decades ago.  Now THAT was original.",1378598400,,1020,4.440860215053763

However, it won't be because of this film. The screenplay simply is not well written and no matter how Dame Maggie and her fine co-stars struggle to raise the thin, predictable plot to a level befitting their talents the material just doesn't merit their attention. If you're a Downton/Potter fan and are not familiar with Maggie's brilliant career don't miss The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, California Suite,The VIPs (a so-so film with the exception of Ms Smiths scenes and the fabulous Margaret Rutherford in an Oscar winning performance), A Room with a View, and a quite beautiful Desdemona in Othello.",1378512000,,757,4.786259541984733

This movie was Dustin Hoffmann's directing debut. It deals with how artists are often cast aside as they age, something he has personally experienced. There is humor and pathos.

I am not ashamed to admit that I wept manly tears at these people who had contributed so much to the entertainment world taking a last bow, as it were.
Dustin Hoffman was up to these Stars. He proved himself as a director.
My complaint: being of an age myself the Amazon rentals have no closed captions and even with two expensive hearing aids, the dialogue was frequently undecipherable. I must have lost many of the spoken nuances, but it was a great show nonetheless.",1377907200,,877,4.814569536423841

5512830,3,B00AW9M3XQ,"This directorial debut from Dustin Hoffman is slight, but enjoyable.  My main problem with the movie: how to get past the implausibility that Maggie Smith - whose well-known voice seems bereft of any oomph and power - is somehow one of the world's best singers (albeit one past her prime)?  I wondered how Hoffman would finesse that at the film's payoff moment, when the four protagonists meet on stage: lip syncing? Smith's character turning tail? Ultimately, the director takes another path, but it's one that pays heed to this reality.

On the other hand, the supporting players require no such artful dodging.  Hoffman filled out his cast from the UK's finest actors, singers and musicians from the 50s, 60s and 70s.  As he stated in any interview, these are people ""whose phones stopped ringing years ago for no good reason.""  In that same interview, he noted their collective gratitude and willingness to work hard, age no matter.  That comes through on the screen.  Ultimately, what sticks with you is not the four main characters, but rather the small, sublime performances that the director lays in from these pros who still have their chops.  Of special note: ""Are You Havin' Any Fun?"" performed by David Ryall, Ronnie Fox and Trevor Peacock. It's a ditty that has stuck in my head since I saw it.

And, it almost goes without saying that Michael Gambon's usual scene-stealing shtick is set on full power here and is well-worth the ride as always.",1377907200,,1457,4.838709677419355

5512842,3,B00AW9M3XQ,This movie would have been better if the majority of the focus was not based on comedy in in the first half of the movie. When they started to dig deeper into the realness of life and aging it was much more enjoyable. Sad to say that I almost didn't make it to that part ( the last 30 min.),1377648000,,290,3.85

I know some of these people, they are so real to me.  My daughter worked in theatre also and I can't wait to watch it with her.  I can't believe that Dustin Hoffman had this in him, well bless him for telling the story of these artists who are able to enjoy life together to the end.",1377475200,,453,3.7872340425531914
5512877,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"It might be tempting to dismiss Dustin Hoffman's ""Quartet"" as a conventional film about the indignities of old age if not for its clever and humorous screenplay, sublime music, and magnificent performances.  Adapted for the screen by Ronald Harwood from his 1999 stage play, ""Quartet"" is set on the beautiful grounds of the Beecham House for Retired Musicians, where elderly performers happily interact, sing, and play their instruments. Every year, these talented men and women put on a gala concert.  This year, the event has special significance, since Beecham needs a substantial infusion of money if it is to remain open.

The residents of Beecham are shocked and excited by the arrival of Jean Horton, portrayed by the incomparable Maggie Smith, who has made a career out of playing imperious, disdainful, and lonely women.  Horton, a former opera singer, sacrificed her personal life for professional success. Reginald Paget (the brilliant Tom Courtenay) is appalled that he will be forced to face Jean, his former wife whom he adored--until she broke his heart.  Another source of dramatic conflict is whether or not Jean will join Reggie, the randy and wisecracking Wilf Bond (Billy Connolly is a standout, thanks to his impeccable comic timing), and the increasingly forgetful Cissy Robson (Pauline Collins), in a quartet from Rigoletto that the four once sang together to great acclaim.

Although the ending is a bit pat and predictable, ""Quartet"" is still a delight--droll, touching, and an affirmation of the power of music to unite, inspire, and enrich our lives, no matter how old or young we happen to be. Be sure to watch the terrific bonus features in which the actors pay homage to their director, Dustin Hoffman.  His empathy, good judgment, knowledge, and skill impressed even Maggie Smith (who, it has been said, is not easily impressed).",1377475200,,1860,5.118811881188119
5512878,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"This movie is a delight for anyone who loves music.  The story is sweet and gentle, and a delightful bonus is the  many musicians who play small parts.  Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay are luminous.",1377475200,,197,4.571428571428571
5512879,3,B00AW9M3XQ,"The story line was good, however, the movie was slow.  So slow that my husband fell asleep.  Enjoyed the music. All in all, a bit of a disappointment.  I expected so much more with such a good cast.",1377475200,,198,4.157894736842105

She  encounters  Reggie,  her  first  husband  and  they  work  out  their  lost  relationship  in  very  believable  ways..  The  plot  revolves  around  persuading  Maggie's  character  to  reprise  the  Quartet  from  Rigoletto  for  the  annual  fund-raiser  concert.  Woven  in  are  some  amazing  vignettes of  Chamber  Music,  jazz,  vaudeville,  choral  works.  The  old  people  are  totally  believable  (I  am  81).  Have  Kleenex  handy.

5512917,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"I had to be ""beaten"" into watching this presentation by the local ""Director of Entertainment"" who demanded that we watch it together. That person is my wife. But I was snickering at the sideways verbal jabs by Billy Connolly in the first scene or so, and crying at the interplay between Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay half way through. Since then we have repeated the performance twice and I am sure will do so again, after football season and wrestling seasons are complete.

This film is a romance. And with any such adventure, suspension of some disbelief is necessary. The disbelief is about two aspects of the film: (1) that there would be a home for retired opera singers, which could have been the lavish English countryside home selected to stage the TV play Downton Abbey, and (2) that opera music would turn out to be something other than the stereotypical non-melodic ""screaming"" in Italian. The effort to suspend disbelief is well rewarded by the first-time director Dustin Hoffman and playwright Ronald Harwood.

Harwood's story is about the personal struggles necessary to organize and produce the home's annual concert to celebrate Verdi's birthday. It is this concert which purportedly provides sufficient financial wherewithal to keep these retired musicians in a fulfilling environment unlike that of any recognizable retirement home.

But it is Hoffman, supported by Cinematographer John de Borman, who encourages richly colorful characters to interact in a setting lush with natural beauty. Laughter abounds! And there hard words; some tears too. All accompanied by classical, and at the close, joyous vocal operatic music.

This is not a movie full of righteous moral fury, nuanced social insight, or unsentimental but devastating drama. What viewers will find is joy - within in the interplay of the characters and within their own hearts.",1377216000,,1861,5.172757475083056
5512918,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"Oh, what a marvelous, warm-hearted film this is, rich with engaging story, powerfully written, with endearing characters perfectly cast. I'm no opera fan, certainly, but this film grabbed and held me through two viewings. Unlike most movies today, this one's a keeper. Maggie Smith is, as always, magnificent ... but so are the others. An added bonus: many of the cast are indeed retired performers, though you don't know that until the credits roll at the movie's end.",1377216000,,469,5.0256410256410255

5512953,5,B00AW9M3XQ,This movie is a delight. All the residents of a wonderful old english house are retired professional musicians. The ordinary physical deterioration of old age is dealt with in an open and  gently humorous  manner. The music throughout the movie is mostly classical with the musicians giving lessons to children from the surrounding community. My only regret is that the movie isn't long enough. I would love to hear more of this caliber of music. And the movie is a clear statement that old age although inconvenient does not mean you have nothing valuable to share with others.,1377129600,,578,4.887755102040816

The acting features knock out performances by Billy Connolly, Tom Courtenay, Maggie Smith, Pauline Collins, Michael Chambon, and perfectly arrayed cast of supporting players, is as deeply entertaining as its premise is humanly revealing.

5513061,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"I found this movie to be entertaining. Of course, it helps to be well past the age of 50  to understand some of the struggles the  characters are forced to deal, that stuff that comes from advancing age. For a non-romantic, I was surprised that one of the story lines relating to a misplayed love interest from long ago hit rather close to home... overall this movie is well worth watching.",1376438400,,390,4.47887323943662
5513062,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"I love this film & watch it at least once a day. The four principal stars worked beautifully together; it was so nice to see a love story between older people. I am 68 so they are my people. Pauline Collins, who plays Cissy, is exceptional. Much of the cast are real musicians & singers of a certain age; since the story takes place in a retirement home for retired musicians,  this makes the story more believable. It is a real feel-good movie. I heartily recommend it.",1376352000,,470,4.402298850574713

If I could be directed by him, I would go after my life long dream to act. I love this man, he has a true heart of gold! Oh, and the actors were the best synergy I have ever seen.

5513114,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"Maggie Smith is, and always has been, versatile and multi-faceted as an actor.
She shows her acerbic, cutting wit and sarcasm in the ""public"" scenes of this film,
while reserving much of her acting gifts for ""alone"" moments. The cast includes former
performers, now in their very mature years. Dustin Hoffman's direction allows the story to
unfold  gracefully, even as the characters struggle with the challenges of aging and the ""used to be""
realities of their lives. While not her greatest work, this film may be Smith's greatest gift to the rest of
the cast of Quartet, and Hoffman's gift to Americans who are not familiar with the wonderfully gifted supporting cast.",1376265600,,670,4.982142857142857

5513117,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"I enjoyed this movie.  The cast was excellent and performed up to expectations.  The premise and plot were predictable, but satisfying nonetheless.  If I were to compare it to another ensemble movie in its genre, it would be ""The most Exotic Marigold Hotel"".",1376179200,,258,4.953488372093023
5513118,3,B00AW9M3XQ,it was good but slow and a little depressing.  Good in that it showed that even when you're old you can still enjoy your talent with others.,1376179200,,140,4.185185185185185
5513119,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"Very few movies are so well conceived, acted, directed, filmed and edited as this.  It isn't just a gem, it is a Faberge Egg.  I would give it five stars if it weren't about performers.  I am very tired of performers--not while they are acting--but when they are consumed with telling their own stories.  They are, by and large, very tiresome people, often thinking they are important people just because they once played one, or received a standing ovation.  You know the type, they play Julius Cesar in High School, get a standing ovation, and then forever assume they are as important as old Julius.  Ultimately, this story is about tiresome people, being tiresome.

But rather shortly after the movie started, I started to like some very briefly displayed characteristic of one of the very tiresome characters.  A mystery unfolded.  Would the spark catch?  Would the likable characteristic fade or blossom?  Would other blooms appear?  Would love triumph over tiresomeness?

The movie is much like an old, barely attended garden in a languishing mansion's side yard.  It is near enough to the house that the very elderly widow who lives there steps out daily to sit on her wrought-iron throne.  From where she sits, there is still order and if not beauty, calming green, but from every other angle it is jungle.  One fine spring day, daffodils spring to bloom.  Long sleeping tulips peek toward the sky and offer surprising refinement.  A cherry tree breaks forth in song.  Old roses, long suffering, come into cascades of harmony.  The widow is provided with one last overwhelmingly beautiful view of glory before the garden succumbs to the jungle.",1376179200,,1653,4.920289855072464

5513122,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"Not a great film, but outstanding and affecting.  Such a pleasure to see four of the great British actors doing ensemble work here: the great Maggie Smith, Pauline Collins, Billy Connolly, and Tom Courtney.  They are four opera singers now retired and working towards reprising their once famous quartet for a retirement home gala. We learn much about their lives and loves in the past, and it builds to a very touching finale. I was amazed by Tom Courtney, whom I remembered from my youth in the ""Billy Liar"" days. He has aged remarkably well and should do more of this kind of mature work.  I found the extras revealing. They all praised Dustin Hoffman as a very engaged director.",1376092800,,682,4.666666666666667
5513123,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"This is a smart movie with good writing, good acting and lovely music in the soundtrack.  Even if you don't appreciate classical music and opera, there is plenty here to like.

It could have been uncomfortable seeing old people because I'm of a certain age, but these people were talented and, except for one, they were civilized.  I would recommend the movie.

5513238,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Billy Conolly runs away with the entire thing, in my opinion. He is just so delightfully wicked and droll, and I think he had the best lines. My favorite part is where another rest home-resident is trying to spit out a sentence and is using a lot of hand gestures; Billy Conolly basically says to him ""Give us a clue...is it a movie, a book, or what?"" I laughed so hard that I threw myself backwards on my bed and nearly smacked my head on the wall! I thought the film also highlighted the fact that people's petty jealousies and insecurities don't disappear just because we get older. The music in the film is beautiful too. I just adored it.",1375660800,,675,4.408

Quartet reminds me a bit of the British television series ""Waiting for God""--except with music!

I loved the humor which was perfectly timed, the setting was idyllic, Mr. Hoffman did a great job directing - I'd swear he was actually acting it sometimes - there was something about the timing that was sooo Hoffman, and the cast - their talents alone are fabulous, the dynamic of them all working together is such fun.

5513334,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"""Quartet"" (2013)

Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut is an entirely confident, measured, heartfelt and multi-layered drama-comedy situated in an old-folks home whose residents were top-flight music professionals - opera stars, orchestra members, etc. The cast is packed with classy A-list talent, actors such as Tom Courtenay, Michael Gambon and Maggie Smith, as well as a rambunctious Billy Connolly, who cheerfully steals scene after scene as a irrepressibly lecherous old-timer who was part of a legendary opera troupe. Also in the film are several ""ringers,"" real-life members of British royal orchestras and opera companies who play residents of the home, and who perform throughout the film. Hoffman's film explores issues of aging -- of lives piled high with lost loves, failing health and former glories -- but does so without belittling or trivializing the characters.  It's also a sweet celebration of art and creativity, and the kind of buoyant, intelligent personalities that make great art. The script and direction share a light, subtle touch, and the magnificent cast hit exactly the right tone, making this one of the most enjoyable, intelligent, mature films I've seen in a long time. Highly recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1375488000,,1260,5.456410256410257
5513335,1,B00AW9M3XQ,Oh. My. Lord. Was this movie boring!  That's about all I can say.  It had great actors but the whole thing made me feel claustrophobic and kinda delirious (which is how most of the seniors acted during the film.)  I ALWAYS look for the good in movies but sadly this fell flat.,1375401600,5,276,4.269230769230769

5513337,3,B00AW9M3XQ,"I liked the concept; and the photography and acting were superb. The story was rather dull and slow. I got the feeling this was made to honor many of the great talented singers and musicians of the 20th century who may otherwise be forgotten. For that reason, it was interesting to me to see these great talents in the background and to research them in google for their contributions.",1375401600,,385,4.594202898550725
5513338,3,B00AW9M3XQ,"The main reason I have a high end computer and 30 Mbps internet connection is so that I can stream movies uninterrupted by the dreadful buffering symbol. Well, apart from the movie, that I would rate average at best, I could not enjoy it because six times during the show I was entertained for several seconds by the message: ""Amazon, loading video"". Each time I checked my download speed and it came in at 30 Mbps. This leaves Amazon as the responsible party. I am disappointed.

Back to the movie. The acting is superb; and, not surprisingly, many of the actors are familiar from the BBC series Masterpiece theater. The story line of old musicians in a retirement home specifically for musicians gets a little old (no pun intended) after a while. There is an undercurrent of mystery between two possible old lovers but not enough interest to raise the level of the story above average.",1375401600,,887,4.685897435897436

Well, she didn't sing, but she was still great.  Plenty of other actors did, and the music was really terrific.

For those of us over 60, the theme of an old folks' (musicians') home, was a little bit disconcerting, but Dustin Hoffman directed this movie with style and fun.  And thankfully, at least to my recollection, no one died.

Bittersweet yes, but well worth watching.",1375228800,,549,4.618556701030927
5513392,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"This is a humorous, warmhearted film that ends well for all concerned.  I greatly enjoyed seeing actors and musicians from my younger years still active.  And it's too bad we all can't end our days in such luxury.  But the adding machine in my head suggests that you'd have to shell out a few hundred thousand up front and come up with at least five thousand a month thereafter, if you could even find such a place.  My experience is that in America, retirement homes are wedged into the cityscape and offer little green space outside and only modest elbow room inside.  They're built to maximize income per square foot.  The chair-lift on Beecham House's grand staircase offered a hint of reality, however.",1375228800,,707,4.7073170731707314
5513413,1,B00AW9M3XQ,"We eagerly awaited the release of this dvd because of Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut and the fine cast.  Much to our great disappointment it was a great disappointment.  Maggie Smith was outstanding as usual with what she had to work with but the movie was S-L-O-W and that's being kind.  It took more than half the movie to get to any point at all and by the time we reached that point we had dozed off several times.  Perfect for insomniacs because it's guaranteed to put you to sleep.  Even though it is about seniors and meant for our target audience, there were no redeeming values and most points were telegraphed far in advance of the point.  Save your money and buy a bad movie you can laugh at like ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" that, up until now, was the worst one I ever saw.",1375142400,17,789,4.36986301369863
5513414,5,B00AW9M3XQ,Maggie Smith is absolutely wonderful as always.  The cast in this movie is like Who's Who of the English film and stage for the past fifty years or more.  The movie is fun and entertaining - its a hoot!,1375142400,,202,4.153846153846154
5513415,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"The best part of Quartet, directed by Dustin Hoffman, is not just that everyone is really playing the instruments you see them playing in the film; it's that the story is so believable.  You can see these people, so talented that they carry their music inside them, coming together as they age, fighting arthritis and encroaching dementia and the demons of their past to create something amazing.  I loved it.  What a treat.  The major stars are wonderful, but the secondary characters are equally winning.  Listen to the clarinet, the cello, the piano, and the voices - amazing.",1375142400,,579,4.86734693877551

5513417,3,B00AW9M3XQ,"The cast was stellar, so I had high expectations.  We found the story line a bit weak.  The tension between Maggie Smith's character and her former husband (I think) wasn't developed enough.  It was easy to see the bitterness, but not much foundation built in for why she wanted reconciliation.  Of course, she can make eating dry toast look interesting, so we didn't feel like the film was a total waste of time.  It would have been with less accomplished actors, though.",1375142400,,472,4.7073170731707314
5513418,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"It is so nice to be able to rely upon some actors who never fail.  Maggie Smith is certainly one of those.  The other cast members were also delightful.

While I note that this film probably  would not appeal to people in their 20's or younger, it is certainly not limited to those in the actors age range.  The filming is beautiful - what else could the English countryside be unless the director ruins it with camera shots that zip, tilt, flash so it ends up looking like someone on speed held the camera.  The quietness of this film is such a relief.  Hold on - it even has dialogue - what a concept!  Using words instead of animation or special effects.

All in all a wonderfully done film, enjoyable story line, and one I'm happy to have spent the money on.",1375142400,,762,4.309859154929577

The setting, the actors, the premise of the movie as being a home for retired musicians in their later years, British humor, the vocals, the pianists and all musical instrument perfection was a joy to behold for me.  Dustin Hoffman, in this his Directorial debut, did a masterful job, and I would bet big money that he enjoyed every minute making this film and his association with the musicians made famous years earlier in being the best and brightest of their craft (as he brought many of the original vocalists and musicians into this movie).

We start the movie as the residents are planning the annual gala to try to get money to keep the home open.  During this time there is a rumor that anew ""star"" will be arriving.  This is significant as three of the residents are members of a quartet and the new resident is the fourth member.  There is some conflict as she was also the ex-wife of one of the men.  I felt that this was a sweet movie and it featured something you don't see much of ""older actors""  I felt the Dustin Hoffman did a good job directing.  The bonus materials were interesting.  But believe it or not my favorite part were the credits as there showed the actors in before and after shots.  They were mostly real musicians that had quite distinguished careers.

5513483,3,B00AW9M3XQ,"The general gist of this movie was about what you would expect, though the specific details were nicely done and less predictable.  The real stars of this movie are the musical performances of the supporting actors, real-life retired musicians, because there is not that much plot for the great actors here to flesh out.  I'm not into opera at all, but I alway appreciate skilled performance. A nice touch was including photos of the supporting actors earlier in their careers in the credits. Enjoyable but ultimately forgettable.

The complexities and issues of old age were depicted in a shallow manner, for anyone who has dealt with the issues of actual declining old people.  However, for those who are unfamiliar with aging in real life, this will make the movie a bit richer.

But for me, the real problem with this movie was the storyline, which is close to minimalist and was too predictable.  Things which could have made good scenes, such as a real discussion between two enemies causing them to move beyond their hate, or a lament about what it is like dealing with flimsy memory, are simply not there. It dragged near the end -- it would have been better to tighten up the pacing so that there was room to include the scene that was deleted (see IMDB for details - it would have been interesting to include on the DVD as an outtake).

Dustin Hoffman, the director, was recently interviewed by Terry Gross on Fresh Air, and he spoke a bit about this movie and other topics -- what an interesting guy!  The transcript and audio of this interview can be found on the NPR site.  I really appreciate his body of work much more after hearing that interview.

Never too long on lightness without letting us know these old people are on their last lap.  Because he musicians in this movie are from the real life English musical landscape, their presence in the retirement home adds a big dose of reality.  The four lead actors carry the story beautifully, each down now and then, each encouraging the others when they can.  Just go.

5513487,3,B00AW9M3XQ,"QUARTET is set entirely at a ""Home for Retired Musicians"" in Britain.  It's a gorgeous old manor (think DOWNTON ABBEY) converted into a charitable home for classical musicians, opera singers, etc.  For not one moment does it seem plausible that this place would really exist...it's so beautiful and spacious and grand.  There are servants everywhere, even though the head of the establishment proclaims the recent ""staff reductions"" have really cut back on services.  And the place is full of lovely music all the time, because these retirees just can't stop performing and delighting each other.  It's a nice fantasy world, populated by several well-known (and well-worn) luminaries of the British screen.  I was willing to accept this fanciful setting, but this meant I was immediately set up to see the whole film as a trifle.

And it is a trifle.  A gentle, amusing, twinkling and only modestly moving one.  The movie revolves around the annual gala held at the house, geared towards raising enough money to keep the place running one more year.  These old performers dust off their costumes (and their vocal chords), performing to a few wealthy individuals who apparently keep funding this place out of both charity and nostalgia.  Not for one minute is it believable that this one night event, in front of less than 100 people, could for year after year raise enough funding to keep this enormous place going.

Anyway, into this friendly atmosphere comes new arrival Maggie Smith, a former MAJOR opera star.  She disrupts those around her, because she brings such a sour mood with her (as only Smith can do).  She meets up with the rest of her former quartet, Pauline Collins (ditsy, forgetful and forgiving), Billy Connelly (a sparkplug who steals all his scenes) and most importantly Tom Courtney, her former husband, who is still nursing some VERY deep resentments.  Courtney is a bundle of hurt, and if this group is to gel again (and headline the gala)...Smith and her ex must come to terms.

Virtually none of the film is surprising.  You can predict so much of what will happen that it's as though you've seen it before.  In such a case, the film relies heavily on the charms of its stars.  And they do come through.  Connelly, as I said, is terrific.  He flirts continuously with EVERY woman he sees and is just generally the clown of the film, in the best way.  Courtney is tight and reserved and proper.  His performance is a bit one-note...but he's written that way a bit.  Collins is fun and zany.  Michael Gambon makes a puzzling turn as the director of the gala...a thoroughly disagreeable man who dresses just a bit like Dumbledore.  Did Gambon have to bring his old costumes to the filming?

Smith, of course, is the main reason to see the movie, and she does a fine job.  She is never less than interesting.  But this role is nearly as fun as what she's done lately in DOWNTON or even in BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL.  She is sad and moody rather than acerbic and funny.  It makes sense that her character would be this way, considering how far she has fallen...but it's not as much fun.  Thus, Smith feels reigned in from the zing we have lately grown accustomed to from her.

QUARTET is a perfectly pleasant movie and worth a look, particularly if you like those very gentle British comedies featuring these old stars.  But it travels no new ground and offers no revelations.  The music is GREAT though.",1374969600,,3426,4.739424703891709

I so hate giving a two-star review to great artists.  But just because they are, it doesn't make the work itself a great picture.

It's a story about a retirement home where aging musicians go to live out the remainder of their lives.  Many of them know each other from the early days when they were at the highlight of their careers.  They have now congregated in one place to continue dabbling in the art of music while they wait for the undertaker to take them away in a body bag.

Maggie Smith plays Jean Horton, a once famous and highly sought after opera singer who is now old, broke, and alone.  (Of course they say she's broke, but I'm not sure how she affords the swanky retirement home.)  Like most elderly, her baggage upon arrival is filled with bitterness over life. To make matters worse, she discovers that her ex-husband is living out his days at the retirement home as well.  He's not much better when it comes to forgiveness for Jean's early days of adultery, so most of the movie he has a chip on his shoulder along with the air of being a former star himself.

The storyline is weak, superficial, and frankly uninteresting.  I will say this, that it would be a great place to retire! The movie is set in an converted English manor, with gorgeous countryside, comfortable and beautiful interior, kind staff, and an eclectic mix of eccentric elderly. You can sing your days away, rumba to music, croquet to your heart's content, and walk the grounds with a dirty old man, if you'd like. However, the story, at least for me, started with a great premise, but moved at a snail's pace.

If the movie accomplishes anything, it does give a poignant view of aging and how one's youth and glory fades. We all know it's coming; perhaps we just don't wish to acknowledge it.

Excuse me, while I search the Internet to find a retirement home in the UK that fits the description for retired authors.  I would love to pack my bags and take my own bitterness over life to a swanky retirement home in the English countryside to live out my days. I can pen murder mysteries until they haul me away in a body bag. Works for me.",1374883200,5,2414,4.481735159817352

This could not have been filmed in the US with and American cast. It just wouldn't have worked. Dustin Hoffman has outdone himself in his directorial review and I look forward to seeing what he does next. Quartet is a very difficult act to follow.

As I write this review there are 285 four and five star reviews two hundred of them five-star, 28 one or two star reviews and 48 straddling three stars. Several of the movie haters speak of technical problems with the DVD and perhaps should not be counted. You should be aware that some folks have had technical issues. Others who speak against the movie seem to be upset that the language is not uniformly dignified. I'm not sure what to say to that. The language seemed very authentic. One soul felt that the movie was to geriatric. I'm guessing they missed all of the advertisements and did not pay attention to the picture on the cover. One negative person sniffed that this movie did not deal authentically with aging issues. This is not an issues movie; Quartet is if anything a slice of life -it is just happens that the slice of life under discussion is very close to the end-of-life.

Director Dustin Hoffman has assembled one of those classic casts of British performers who are as at ease in supporting roles as in leading roles and know how to impart a quality depth to every performance. The philosophy on display here is that there are no small roles and small actors need not apply. While the performances and the script tends to favor classifying this is a comedy, the underlining theme is that these are people serious as death.

Quartet takes place in a retirement home for British musicians. Overall these are plush quarters but  clearly assignments are made based on the reputation and status of the now retired artists. The story arc revolves around the long ago failed marriage between newly arriving Opera diva Jean Horton (Dame Maggie Smith) and equally diva -ish longer retired Reginald Pajet ( Tom Courtenay). Between them must be resolved first the issues that ended their marriage issues he has never gotten over. And second her loss of confidence in her singing ability so that she can participate in an upcoming fundraiser needed to keep the retirement home open. We can be almost confident how the story lines will be resolved but the brilliance in the writing is to keep us just enough unsure such that the dramatic tension holds through to the end.

The real story line in quartet and the reason why I will not shrugged it off as a light comedy is in the nature of the personalities involved. The most immediate fact is that these are old people very aware that they are losing all of their individual capabilities due to their advancing age. These people are very aware that death awaits them impatiently. Secondly these people are all artists used to performing at very high levels. All have had to make sacrifices in the name of their artistic skills and now they are facing the fact that they must now sacrifice their standings as artists. There is an old expression ""nothing quite focuses the mind like the certainty that one is to die in the morning"". A premise of quartet is that to the degree that these minds can focus; they are aware that time is against them. Consequently decisions that have been delayed for years have to be attended to rapidly and in such a manner as to leave them neither compromised nor dissatisfied with their decisions. Ultimately these are people who choose to enjoy the time that is left to them.

Besides a very well written story, a first class team of actors and one of those classic British Manor home film sets; Quartet is graced with the plethora of enjoyable small things. There is a 2 to 3 second image of a young girl in a white summer pinafore running across a green grass trailing a red shawl. It is visually breathtaking. There is a similar visual of Dame Maggie Smith in a simple, regal turquoise dress suit striding into the dining room which again speaks to what superb cameramen can achieve. Dir. Hoffman has filled the retirement home with real musicians. They are honored in the closing credits and they honor us with beautiful musical interludes throughout the movie.

Something else Dustin Hoffman gets correct is that faces do not have to be conventionally beautiful to be beautiful. If there is one thing that American movies tend to render boring it's conventionally beautiful faces. From beginning to end quartet is filled with faces that are not normally allowed in close-ups and the movie is better for this decision.

I am a huge fan of small-scale movies that do not require lots of flashing lights or loud noises or huge scale issues. Quartet is homage to art, to artistry and a movie that respects and therefore honors the elderly. This movie could have become maudlin or morose. It has more than a few cliches except that they are all used in creative and original ways. If you haven't figured it out yet I like this movie and I recommend it without hesitation.",1374537600,,4898,4.667439165701043
5513684,3,B00AW9M3XQ,"Despite the setting, this is not a laid-back movie.  They may be in a nursing home, but these residents do not plan on sitting around playing cards or watching the telly; they were all actors and this is just another role that they are performing.  The location is a beautiful estate that is filled with acres of parks and gardens.  The season is autumn so we get to see the English countryside during this beautiful time of year.  Add to this a cast (see below) that is terrific and a story with great dialogue and you have an entertaining movie.

5513686,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"In the extras on the DVD, director Dustin Hoffman and some of the cast members say that this film is about living life completely, about continuing with life even in old age. That may be, but what makes this film wonderful is not the message but the cast. Maggie Smith is, as always, magnificent as the diva who no longer sings because she realizes that her best days are behind her but who listens to her own recordings (but denies doing so). Michael Gambon (the second Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films) shines as the director of the annual show to fund the home for retired musicians. Trevor Peacock (whom many will remember as the ""No, no, no, no, no, yes"" man from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Vicar-of-Dibley/dp/B000SINSX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Vicar of Dibley</a>&nbsp;is always a welcome treat.

But the star of the show, at least in my eyes, is Billy Connolly, the forever flirtatious would-be lothario. In the commentary, Hoffman notes that Connolly was hesitant to take the role since he thought he would not be in the same class as the other cast members. Hoffman notes that Connolly underestimated his talents. I would add ""seriously"" before ""underestimated.""

The plot itself is not exactly new, and there are few twists here. But the magnificent cast makes the plot almost secondary. Finally, one touching note is that over the closing credits, pictures of many of the cast members appear, both as they are in the film and as they were during their heyday. It's sobering to think just what an amazing assembly of talent Hoffman was able to bring to this film.",1374451200,,1636,5.123595505617978

We will all age and things won't be good, but this movie seemed to lean toward the negatives of aging instead of the aging with grace.

The subject of aging is handled with dignity, respect and a lot of humor.  I can only hope, should I end up in a retirement home, to have such experiences.  When I went to see it in the theatre I was with a good friend, who has been teaching music for many years.  She commented that the actors were actually playing the instruments, that they were not ""acting"".  She was able to tell this from watching.

I realize it is a movie about old people but could we move it along and include a little more character development? The obstinacy of Reggie lasts too long and is unreasonable considering the length of his marriage (9 hrs) to Jean. Just sluggish and predictable. Beyond that, the director/producer found it necessary to insert the f-word twice when it was totally unnecessary. Does Hollywood think they can't make an adult movie without gratuitously throwing-in unnecessary foul language? What, did you need a more restricted rating or something?

5513774,2,B00AW9M3XQ,"Even Maggie Smith couldn't save this movie for me.  It's clich and boring, without direction, and no story to speak of.  And a little depressing.  We're meant to believe that the residents of a home for elderly are down on their luck, but the residence is sumptuous as are the grounds.  The thin plot is not very skillfully developed nor are the characters.  And against the premise of being in various stages of dementia, the movie is one long sing-along as the residents happily and skillfully perform throughout.  Typical side show of staff shagging in the bushes, procuring the naughty old folks their hootch and smilingly enduring tedious repartee filled with sexual innuendo from the ""residents"" scattered liberally throughout, but not executed as well as Benny Hill.  Everyone is engaged in producing or avoiding the big ""gala"" that will ""save"" the home.  Not sure they had it...I gave up 1 hour into the movie.

It is a wonderful story and shows how we must laugh at ourselves as we age and make the most of what it means.  These lucky people happened to be in a Home where they were among other musicians and could enjoy ongoing music.,1374278400,,330,3.984848484848485

5513823,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"Quartet is Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut. It's a gentle tale, beautifully made, of life at a home for retired musicians. The problems and challenges of growing old are not glossed over but throughout you see the dignity in arthritic fingers and voices that are not what they used to be.

Throughout it all is the music, because the home is getting ready for their annual fund-raising gala. So music rings from beginning to end as you see the residents practicing and auditioning.

Into this closed and charming world comes Jean, an operatic soprano who has come upon hard times. She was married once to one of the residents, Reg, and famously sang in Rigoletto with him and two of the other residents (the Quartet of the title). Maggie Smith plays Jean and it's a wonderful performance. You expect Jean to be diva-like in every aspect of her life. Certainly the first scenes with her lead you to this impression. But Smith plays her with depth and gentleness and humility that makes her a wonderful center for the film.

It's a quiet comedy of manners, full of music and wonderful performances.",1374278400,,1099,4.773684210526316

But the concept and the delivery of this comedy were excellent. After all... just because a diva gets old and retires from public it doesn't mean she stops being a diva! The humor is very dry and very subtle and there are some serious threads that leave you thinking about your own old age and making the most of life's opportunities. All in all a very pleasant hour and a half and a movie we will be purchasing.",1374192000,,541,4.303921568627451

My son is a huge fan of Opera as am I but even if you are not, you will be drawn into this film by the story and the brilliant acting of this fine cast.  Dustin Hoffman makes his directorial debut and I can only say I certainly hope he continues, because this was a sweet, funny film about older ones that manages to bring out the frustration of getting older without wallowing in bitterness.  You will be drawn in immediately to this story of Jean, the prima donna descending upon this lovely home for older artists and the havoc she creates with her presence.  I love the line, ""I had 12 curtain calls.""  To which Jean replies, ""No my dear, you had nine.  I had twelve."" They try to persuade her to be part of the quartet and sing a piece but she is such a perfectionist she is loath to sing and accept her voice as she has aged.  These lovely people manage finally to get her to agree to be part of their gala but it is quite an interesting journey. Beautifully done, and even if you are not aware of it, I really loved the way they told us how many talented people from the opera were in the film in the credits.  This is a movie you will watch again and again.  I loved it.",1374105600,,1298,4.074803149606299

It's Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut, and he gathered a great cast of British talent in this film, including Maggie Smith, Pauline Collins, Billy Connolly, Michael Gambon, Tom Courtenay, and Andrew Sachs.
A little slow at time, but overall I enjoyed the film.
American star Dustin Hoffman made a very unique decision to go abroad direct an a mostly British cast in his first film as a director.
The dvd has a few extras, including a audio commentary by Hoffman (I'll have to give that a spin in the future!)

Aging is not for sissies as they remind us in the movie, but life still holds all the possibilities for fun and laughter and love and meaning that it does at any other age.  It's all in what you make of it--each and every day. The movie doesn't provide gripping drama, or loads of tension, or gut-wrenching action scenes--so if you need that kind of stuff to enjoy a movie, this isn't for you.

Anyone in their Senior years should not just hunker down and give in but to live life to it's fullest.  A movie where there is no sex, no violence but yes they do swear a bit but it's funny.  It's one of those times when it just pops out of the mouth without the brain thinking first.

I truly love Maggie Smith and try to watch all her productions.  She is among my top favorites along with a few others that she sometimes pairs up with and they are just so wonderful and present a life in a time that is no longer but hasn't been forgotten completely.

Hoffman's direction, was awesome throughout the whole film.  He is an actor who understands character; and it's

The music and scenery were beautiful and the acting, fine but there was a big build up for a performance that we were never allowed to see. That was a disappointment. Also, I felt it ended rather abruptly. That said, it IS worth seeing if you're a fan of classical music, as it is played throughout the movie.",1373760000,,454,4.404761904761905

It captures the charm that comes from living a full life offering us a simple story about a collection of wonderful characters that is not limited to the five billed stars [Smith, Courtenay, Connolly, Collins and Gambon] who are all more than excellent. The grand Beecham House, which is just outside of London, is portrayed as an elegant home for retired musicians that is full of the most charming extras, many of whom are actually retired professional artists. Such a unique ensemble adds its own texture and charm to a story of relationships that tenderly confronts issues of aging and loss.

The smart, witty British dialog pulls you in quickly and focuses your attention on the intricate interactions of these amazing seniors, making you more of a participant rather than an observer. Their collective energies are pushing for the success of an upcoming, annual celebration of Verdi's birth and his music that binds them together. I would not describe this as comedy but rather as a warm picture of life with many of the lighter moments of these elders elegantly addressed; I highly recommend it. I can't ever remember seeing a better ensemble cast and they challenge you to keep up as they warn you that 'old age is not for sissies'. Kudos to Hoffman.

5514095,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"I thought about giving this the title of 'When the Music is Dying"".  It is a sad story, because the people  portrayed are talented, some world reknown, and they  are losing their abilities to create the beautiful music they formerly did.
It's a story that every one eventually lives through, but most of us are not as talented as these people, Younger people likely will not enjoy the movie as much as older ones, .unless they are lovers of classical music and opera.
The story involves a group of retired musicians and singers who live in a retirement home especially for their profession.  A gala to raise mioney for a new roof is being planned, a kind of geriatric Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland story.. Much bickering and back-biting goes on about who was the best singer, there is tension and hurt feelings from former romances and love affairs,
All ends well with the gala performed to great success.  Maybe not a great plot, but many good scenes, great actors, and direction, and wonderful, marvelous music.!!

5514100,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"Quartet is Dustin Hoffman's first directing gig of a major film, and he's done something that's not easy - he's made what could be a depressing film about aging stars into a warm and engaging tale about the power of friendship and love. The story is set at a senior home for retired musicians and centers around an upcoming fund-raising concert at which all the residents perform. The main characters all have something of a history with each other. I think a good bit of the charm of this movie is the actors. Maggie Smith is, as always, incomparable. Pauline Collins (Shirley Valentine) is delightful as the one member of their little group who is having serious memory problems. Billy Connolly is perfect as the rude, rakish charmer who actually has a heart of gold. Tom Courtenay is the perfect gentleman who has a history with Maggie Smith's character.

5514157,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"""Quartet"" is a sweet, romanticized tale about talented musicians in their golden years. What happens when a successful, long career on stage has reached its end? When youth and vigor have slipped into the unavoidable issues of aging? The residents of a bucolic (fictional) retirement home in the English countryside may be dealing with limitations following a stroke, or even mild dementia, but they aren't alone or completely forgotten. Music is still an important part of their everyday lives.

On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give this movie a solid 7. ""Quartet"" isn't a deep movie, and having had relatives in assisted living/nursing homes it clearly shows an idealized, unrealistic depiction of retirement homes in general, but it's pleasant and even funny entertainment with some very nice music.",1373500800,,797,5.130769230769231

And, the greatest disappointment of all, Maggie Smith, at almost the very end of the movie, started dropping ""F-Bombs""!  I was really shocked that an actress of her level felt the need to go along with a script that called for such vulgarity!  The dialogue would have been just as effective had she been allowed to express anger and outrage with out demeaning herself and her generation with that disgusting language.  I don't understand the movie industry's love affair with that kind of language, nor do I consider it to be a sign of any intelligence on the part of the writers when that is the only thing they can think of to write.

5514256,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"I used the word ""deliberateness"" in the title of my review because I'm trying to avoid use of the word ""slow.""  The truth is... this movie does begin a bit slowly... much like the characters it depicts.  And that would not necessarily be a criticism--I love character-built films and books--except that while we are strolling our way through the exposition on this fabulous ensemble cast, the tone is just a tad on the dark side.  And it's not the dark comical sort of gallows humor such as we see in films like Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (suggested if you need a bit of a lift after this one); it truly is an ""old age isn't for sissies"" themed piece, with very little comic relief to make us believe there will be hand-holding and tenderness throughout.

Still... I didn't think I could love Dame Maggie Smith any more than I already do from her impressive career, but I found even deeper levels of her talent here.  In fact, there are splendid performances here by Pauline Collins (pitch perfect in her role, really), Tom Courtenay, and I would be remiss if I didn't confess I've never been able to help being a little in love with Billy Connolly, no matter what role he plays.  Michael Gambon is great as well, although his role doesn't ask much of him.

I think if one understands that this film was first a stage play, one has a better appreciation of what Dustin Hoffman was trying to do.  Moving a drama from a live theater audience to a movie-going public audience is nearly always problematic.  For some reason we expect to find cynicism in the theater but happily-ever-after in the movies.  Or at least, I do.

All things considered, this film touches on several issues dear to my heart, not the least of which is recognition of what our seniors have to offer if we will but listen.  My favorite part had to be when ""Reg"" explains to a young man the difference between opera and rap.  Brilliant.",1373328000,,1905,4.535087719298246

5514309,2,B00AW9M3XQ,"I was eager to see the QUARTET. Directed by Dustin Hoffman, QUARTET stars several beloved older British actors. Maggie Smith shines in any film she graces. Add in Tom Courtney, Billy Connolly, Pauline Collins and Michael Gambon, and we have a dream cast. Unfortunately, the film is uninspired and rather sad. Beecham House is a retirement home for singers and musicians and it is about to have a glorious new resident in opera sensation Jean Horton (Maggie Smith). It's not clear how this cast ended up in what seems more like an assisted living facility than a retirement home. Most residents seem to be in reasonable good health. Are there destitute and needing to live in a group home for the elderly? It seems like these acclaimed singers and musicians are now alone in the world with only each other.

Horton arrives just in time for rehearsals for a gala event to keep their home open. Does Beecham House run on charity? Again, it is unclear as to why Beecham House is short on funds. Horton is asked to join a quartet that includes her very bitter ex-husband. Old wounds have festered through the decades. This is not a happy group of people except for eternally cheerful and confused Cecily Robson (Pauline Collins).

Although Tom Courtenay and Billy Connolly have aged well, time does not seem to have been good to the residents. Rather than being an inspirational film about enjoy life in later years, QUARTET seems to be the story of once famous people fading into oblivion looking for one last hurrah. Ironically, in a bonus feature, someone mentions the film as a ""comedy."" It seemed rather sad to me. Hopefully, others see it differently. I was disappointed in a film that has such a marvelous cast and director.

Be sure to watch the credits. There are some bittersweet pictures of the cast members as they are in the film and as they were in their prime. Most of the cast worked in theater and were once well-known stage actors and musicians. Opera and classic music are the keys here. Beecham House is actually full of aging opera singers s there are no 70-year-old rock stars living in residence. Mick Jagger won't be moving in any time soon. I wondered how these people had fallen so far that they were now in Beecham House. Was it health or financial issues or just a chance to live with old friends in their twilight years? They do live in a lovely home on a stately English estate but had they forsaken families and friends for their careers? The setting is delightful. The residents seem happy and they do band together for the annual gala but what about the rest of the year? I left the film feeling sad, sad, sad.",1373155200,4,2638,4.62046908315565

5514339,3,B00AW9M3XQ,"I really wanted to love this movie. And I did, in a way. By the end of it, I was really touched and left with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye. I wish the whole movie could have made those simple emotional connections the same way the eloquent final gesture did. The premise of the film was uttered by a character who, at one point, said something like, ""Take part! Before you're the guest of honor at the crematorium."" And that really sums up what QUARTET was about--that the promise of life, happiness, and love do not end simply because we grow older and our physical beings fade.

It's a lovely message. Yet the film seemed to be trying so hard to be serious, to be about big themes, that, at times, it was painfully slow. It could have used a bit more humor and a little less pretense. Its characters could have benefitted from being a bit more zany, so we would like and care about them more. Although I enjoyed the movie for the most part and would recommend it to others, I simply didn't think it had the spark of, say, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, another film with similar characters and themes. The latter had more heart, was more willing to let down its gray hair, and that made it more worthwhile--and fun.",1373155200,,1229,4.297413793103448

5514425,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"The story is less substantial than Maggie Smith's other hit of the past year, ""Marigold Hotel"" but this is still enjoyable. My wife and I are old (65 and 68) so we could identify with the characters, even though they were retired opera singers and orchestra members. We saw it via our cable company's ""on demand HD"" movie rental option. (We just purchased our first flat-screen set a couple of weeks ago.) The acting is fine, the music is glorious. My father-in-law, age 91, a WW II vet who earned a Silver Star for saving the life of a fellow sailor on a burning ship, just moved in to a fancy retirement palace much like the one depicted here. So we had plenty to recognize and with which to identify. Crotchety personalities abound in the film's world, along with poignant ""senior moments"" heralding the probably precipitous declines of a few of the main characters. It is realistic about aging, and the fact that some talented people can indeed still sing well enough in their '70's and '80's. (Check out Tony Bennett and Hal Linden, for instance.)",1372896000,,1052,4.661290322580645
5514426,2,B00AW9M3XQ,"I love British film, telly and have been an avid collector for years. So I quickly grabbed this Vine choice and felt I'd scored a win. After viewing, I  was tempted to give a one star review, but I can't really say I hated this film because I did get to see some fine actors do their usual good work. But I can honestly say I did not like it.

This film was a disappointing waste of time and of a Vine choice. Looking at the cast list I expected a nice little film, Brit style. Alas, perhaps to ""appeal to the younger viewers"" the vulgar witticisms of Billy Connelly were injected at regular intervals. They failed to lighten the mood, however and the jokes fell flat as lead in the layer cake.

After much sniggering and dithering, the film works itself up to the climax of Dame Smith uttering an F bomb at her old lover in the dining room. A pointless and embarrassing moment to be sure. Mr. Courtenay also gets his chance to utter a stream of four letter invectives at a young girl for no clear reason. Something to do with marmalade (!?)

The problem here is not so much the profanity, but that it seemed out of character and did nothing to enhance or advance the story. So why sprinkle it around like some kind of poisonous pixie dust hoping movie magic will result? I suppose I should be grateful nobody gave birth bloody and screaming, threw up on someone or bared their breasts as this seems to happen in every other show nowadays.

Maggie Smith was pitch perfect as always, as was Tom Courtenay. Pauline Collins turned in a good performance, always a treat to see her, but  she was miscast in her role. Her natural strength undermined her characters frailty. Another casting flaw was the girl who played the doctor and head of the nursing home. She would only have been believable as a pizza waitress. Expecting her to be a trained physician and in charge was asking too much of an audience who by this time was bored and thinking ""don't I have laundry to do?"" Now that I think of it, Pauline Collins would have been perfect in this part. Her wonderful blend of strength, sass and warmth would have given the other characters the pillar they needed to circle around.

Michael Gambon's scenes were brief but it was fun watching him channel the spirit of Rex Harrison. He did him to the life. I assume it was intentional?

There was a very thin storyline in the first place, which all this seasoned talent tried valiantly to support, yet despite their best efforts it could not be done.

Dustin Hoffman directed. I expect by now he's hiding someplace and drinking heavily.

Sad waste of talent all around. Don't waste your time and money.",1372896000,,2645,4.468879668049793

The English countryside scenery was beautiful. The operatic singing was beautiful. There was a touching love story where Maggie Smith's and Tom Courtenay's characters realized they truly loved each other.  There was a happy ending.  What I didn't like were all the fart jokes, crazy skirt chasing, vulgar swearing, peeing jokes and trying to ""make-it-real"" meanness the characters showed. Did like the overall message that if you aren't having any fun you need to adjust your attitude, no matter what your age.  Life is fun and it holds surprises.

5514487,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"I'll admit that I chose this movie more for my wife than myself. While I enjoy the occasional drama/comedy of manners, this movie's plot of the reunion of four aging opera singers in a home is not what I usually buy or rent for myself.

This movie greatly exceeded my expectations. It was warm, humorous, and even romantic. Even my mother-in-law, who doesn't like opera, really enjoyed it.

Adapted from a stage play there are few alterations to the movie format leaving some puzzles: time seems to move with varying degrees, there are no apparent elevators in the retirement home as the residents seem to use the stairs.  The staff is small and relatives of the residents are not seen.  Beecham House is in danger of going under, but this point is quickly forgotten with more attention given to the characters than the plot. You will want to keep your finger on the volume control of your remote while watching this, as parts are hard to hear/understand--or turn on the subtitles.

If you are not a fan of opera, you can still overlook it for an enjoyable movie.  The terrific cast and first-time direction by Dustin Hoffman(at age 75) are worth seeing. In sum, this is a great for the adult members of your family. The movie is funny and well done.  (There is nothing objectionable for kids outside of a little strong language, but they'd be bored.)

nature of all human relationships. When we know that we have gone to the top of the ladder in our chosen field, we
are reluctant to relinquish that position to anyone, especially another person within our age range who has been a
competitor. It is a superb cast; many of those men and women actually lived that role in their daily life. Personally, I
wanted to be able to walk through space and time, and be a character in that movie. It must have been great fun to
participate as a cast member. I highly recommend this movie to any person who has an interest in good music;  not
just opera, or classical music in general. Perhaps this very entertaining movie may open up your minds to a genre
of music that can lift your soul. This movie is a sampler of aurally appealing music, with excellent actresses and actors

Why aren't they with their families or living independently from the wealth they created as famous people? The themes are relatable. The story is really not. The reality of it would probably be that you wouldn't have so many in a home, the home would be a dump, and they'd be more debilitated. Of course, that doesn't make such a great story either though. ;) I think if I were in a different frame of mind or maybe just older, I'd enjoy it more.",1372723200,,798,4.256578947368421

5514539,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"A must see for two reasons:
It's Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut,and it's a sweet, entertaining show.

Quartet is a film of Ron Harwood's 1999 play set in a retirement home for musicians and singers.  The annual feconcert fundraiser is being planned to coincide with Verdi's birthday and heading the committee is Cedric Livingston, played by Michael Gambon.  Also on the committee is Cissy Robson, beautifully performed by Pauline Collins, who is ""getting forgetful""  and her old stage buddy, Wilf Bond raucously played by Billy Connolly who delights in flirting with all the women and makes a hobby of needling Cedric.  Another resident, Reggie Paget, an outstanding performance by Tom Courtenay, who came to the home to check on his old buddy Wilf who had been admitted after a slight stroke.  Reg never left and found his niche in caring for his friends and holding classes for young people.  The scene in the classroom where he makes the comparison between rap and opera is delightful!

Into the idealic setting comes the grouchy diva, a noted opera singer, Jean Horton, played by Maggie Smith.  Her arrival shakes up Reg who she was very briefly married to years ago, and turns his world upside down.  She also brings out the evil eye in an old rival, Anne Langley (Gwyneth Jones).

I love Maggie Smith, a great actress, but couldn't get used to her childish behavior in this role, too much Downton I guess. The entire cast from the colorful main characters to the extras and minor bits are all exquisite.  Beautiful, touching performances by all. The music throughout the film, lovely range of familiar classics.  Great piano, violin, voices, in fact, my only complaint would be that I could have heard more from the very talented musicians and singers.  Be sure to see the credits.

5514632,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"This is a sophisticated story of aging opera stars avoiding the doldrums associated with life in a retirement home by staging an annual end of year gala production.  The story is filled with aging artistic ""characters"" whose eccentricities color their world, and the film is cast with actual former leading musicians and opera stars. The story is fascinating, filled with elements of love, anger, passion, kindness, ego and even sex.  Director Dustin Hoffman effectively guides the tale through a series of daily interactions and developments that expose the core humanity of the characters and send them to a triumphant climax.  Each actor, lead by Maggie  Smith, does a outstanding job of developing interesting and complex characterizations.  This film is definitely not for the ""explosions and car chase"" crowd.  But for those of us still interested in films that provide a ""people-centric"" story with an uplifting theme, this film is worth your time.",1372550400,,955,5.25
5514633,2,B00AW9M3XQ,"Honest admission.... I'd watch Maggie Smith eat cereal.  However this movie way under-utilizes her talent and the story seems very contrived.  In fact, all the actors are top notch!  Such a fantastic cast, but their roles demote them to caricatures.  All I could think of at one point is that poor Dumbledore (actor Michael Gambon who plays Cedric Livingston) has become the cranky head-master of a retirement community and is having trouble keeping Professor McGonagall from casting confundus charms on the unsuspecting Muggle, Cissy Robson (Pauline Collins).  The comic moments seemed to vacillate between sweet and uncomfortable, but mostly centering on ho hum.

Neatly tucked away in the bucolic English countryside, Beecham House is a retirement home for aged singers and musicians who still perform for one another - and for the occasional outsider - on a regular basis. It is with the arrival of a newcomer - starchily played by the always-starchy Maggie Smith - that the tranquility of the place is suddenly threatened. For, you see, Jean Horton, a former opera diva, world-renowned for both her talent and her temper, was once briefly and unhappily married to one of the residents there, Reggie (Tom Courtenay), who had hoped to live out what is left of his life in peace, never having to see or interact with Jean ever again. Jean and Reggie once comprised one-half of a singing quartet that also included two other residents, Wilf (Billy Connelly) and Cissy (Pauline Collins), and the hope is that the four can be convinced to reunite for a performance that will bring in some much needed revenue for the home which otherwise might have to close its doors due to insufficient funds.

Adapted by Ronald Harwood from his 1999 play, ""Quartet"" is a sweet and poignant comedy/drama that acknowledges the sadness and difficulties of growing old without unnecessarily dwelling on them. Long past their primes, these talented, life-affirming individuals know full well what the years have robbed them of, but they are also, to varying degrees, making the best of the time that is still left to them, though of the four, Jean is clearly having the greatest trouble adjusting to the realities of aging. The movie shows that it often takes as much courage for an artist to exercise his talents at the end of his life as it does at the beginning.

In helming the project, Dustin Hoffman joins his colleagues Paul Newman (""Rachel, Rachel""), Robert Redford (""Ordinary People""), Warren Beatty (""Heaven Can Wait""), and Denzel Washington (""Antwone Fisher"") in proving, in his first time in the director`s chair, that he is as adept behind the camera as he is in front of it. ""Quartet"" is clearly an actors' picture, and Hoffman, respecting both the material and the talents he has on hand, wisely pulls back and lets these great seasoned performers do what it is they do best. The plotting may be a bit pat and predictable at times, but you can't go wrong with an acting quartet like the one here.",1372118400,,2333,4.784119106699752

5514808,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"Although this is a movie about elderly musicians, it is also a story about hope and life, giving all of us the goal of making our last years as full of joy as these people have. The principals are all great actors and much has already been said about them in other reviews, all praise deserved. Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, and Tom Courtenay - we have come to expect amazing performances from them. But the best of them as far as I am concerned was Billy Connolly. His humor and wit not only keep the movie light and enjoyable, but cheer and comfort those around him. He is a true spirit of growing old gracefully, a true morality tale of choosing to enjoy life rather than let it get you down. Another plus in this movie is that most of the musicians in this ensemble are real musicians who have had music careers in their lifetime and are still amazing. The music is fantastic and mixes up all sorts of styles with even an appreciation of 'rap'. Another actor who must be mentioned is Pauline Collins and her portrayal of a woman who is 'losing it'. Here was another example of growing old with dignity and grace, loved by everyone around her. I am sorry that Dustin Hoffman has waited so long to direct a film. He is certainly gifted as a director and I hope he will consider other projects. This film is very highly recommended.",1372118400,,1333,4.40080971659919

If you like Masterpiece Theatre and are a major Anglophile, this is a good fit for you. Tom Courtenay's character even spices things up with a comparison of opera with modern hiphop music, including an ad lib, a cappella example from a teenage black high school student. Billy Connolly plays Wilf, a kind of old rake dancing on the edge of dirty old man, pinching the girls and peeing in the bushes. Pauline Collins plays Cissy, a wispy, lovely, happy singer who sometimes loses it, but whose friends bring her back to the present tense. Try it, you'll like it...",1372032000,,1133,4.875647668393782

They enjoy singing together, playing musical instruments, and reminiscing about the old days. Into the mix reluctantly steps a former diva and opera superstar (the incomparable Maggie Smith) who's fallen on hard times and poor health, so now needs to take up residence in the home, which itself is supported mostly through donations. Her arrival stirs up old rivalries, resentments, and just plain drama when she refuses to sing in a Verdi quartet to be performed at an upcoming fundraiser. Added to the mix at the home is her one-time husband and co-star, who still smarts over her infidelity decades earlier. And who still loves her. The film carries a poignant underlying theme: that even in old age, there lies in all of us a young soul that is unchanging - and still capable of vulnerability, joy, and above all, true love.",1372032000,,982,4.851190476190476

5514959,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"The story opens in a British retirement home for opera singers and musicians.  Here we meet the genial, still active residents who are happily rehearsing for an upcoming gala.  A new guest is moving  in today, and there are mixed feelings when it turns out to be a famous diva (and unfaithful ex of one of the residents).

This is a lovely, sweet - but not too sweet - comedy staring Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Billy Connolly, and Pauline Collins and directed by Dustin Hoffman.  The cast is uniformly excellent (although Courtenay looks too young to be paired with Smith).  The setting, a beautiful manor house in the countryside, is exquisite.  The story deals with life and death, frailty, love, and hate and does so gently and honestly.

Some reviewers seem to think this film would primarily appeal to older viewers but I disagree.  There are several common elements that anyone, regardless of age, can relate with.  What runs concurrent generationally is our ability to adapt to life transitions.  Our lives are continuously in a state of flux.  Our  environment changes, our relationships change, our bodies change.  What makes a successful life is how we learn to adapt to the changes around us and within ourselves.  Even those who are not of the ""boomer"" generation, have been forced to adjust to an unwelcome changes, a loss of some sort?  Who hasn't had to adapt to some change in one's sense of control?  Parents move to a new area, the children have no say in the matter, but they must adapt to a new school, make new friends, etc. Transitioning from middle school to high school comes with unfathomable bodily changes. What young adult has not lost a job, or the person they thought was the love of his or her life?  Some people engage in an overwhelming desire and expend tremendous effort to fight back or rebel against change.  Some adapt more easily with humor and understanding.  Maybe most of us come to acceptance more slowly over a period of time.  Each of these characters has a zest for life that we can appreciate whatever our age.",1371686400,,1471,4.651162790697675

5515037,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"Ronald Harwood wrote both the original play and the screenplay for this diversion and somehow managed to get Dustin Hoffman to direct. The concept of a sound one - what happens to retired musicians who can no longer care for themselves after years of glory before the public has accompanied them to the station of being elderly and in need of assistance? Turning this situation into a comedy takes taste and restraint and Harwood delivers both - as does Hoffman.

In Beecham House, a home for retired musicians Cecily (Pauline Collins), Reggie (Tom Courtenay), Wilfred (Billy Connolly) and Cedric (Michael Gambon) are preparing plans for the annual October 10 concert to celebrate Verdi's birthday - and to raise funds so that Beecham House can survive. They are tended by Dr. Lucy Cogan (Sheridan Smith) who manages to fend off sexual advances from Wilfred while assisting the entire ensemble in their participation. All goes relatively smoothly until the arrival of the newest tenant, MegaDiva Jean Horton (Maggie Smith) arrives on the scene (Jean is Reggie's ex-wife, a divorce that didn't end amicably). When informed that she must participate in the Verdi gala, Jean refuses and the rest of the film is the interaction of the other residents with Jean and how Jean manages to change her attitude - and heart.

The film gently shows the comical aspects of approaching senility in some and the personality quirks in others. The story is slight but does carry a warm message. It is not until the end of the film that we discover that the majority of `actors' who appear as residents in Beecham House are in truth retire and aging stars of yesteryear. They deserve mention here: Andrew Sachs, Dame Gwyneth Jones, Trevor Peacock, David Ryall, Michael Byrne, Ronnie Fox, Aleksandra Duczmal, Denis Khoroshko, Sarah Crowden, Colin Bradbury, Patricia Varley, Ronnie Hughes, Jack Honeyborne, John Rawnsley, Nuala Willis, Melodie Waddingham, Cynthia Morey, John Heley, Graeme Scott, John Georgiadis, Ita Herbert and Ania Duczmal.

At Beecham House,  the inhabitants are planning a fund-raising gala to commemorate Verdis birthday. it is directed by Cedric, played by Michael Gambon, and the usual who is best game is played. The appearance of Jean Horton, played by  Maggie Smith, who is a brilliant British soprano, brings issues. If she joined three old friends for the quartet from Rigoletto, it would bring in a lot of mney.

Wild, played by Billy Connolly, is the lovable lech; Cissy, played by Pauline Collins , lovable but who is losing her memory. Reggie, played by Tom Courtenay, was married to Jean for nine hours years ago and has never gotten over her. Will the four come together and make music?

This is at once a lovable film, but also a look at the lives of those who are growing older. We can see ourselves in this elders. The terrific actors play their roles with grace and wit. Real musicians are interspersed into the film as residents of the Manor. Great music comes from the film, and it is an enjoyable film. You may become weepy eyed, but go into it.

I saw this wonderful film last year at the Philadelphia Film Festival and immediately told all my friends to catch it when it hit national release. As you can see by the reviews posted here already, those who have seen and loved it have sometimes seen it more than once. If you have only seen it once, I urge you to get the DVD when it is released later this month. Not only will you get to savor some of the wonderful dialogue and acting again but the bonuses will make your experience even better.

Both the DVD and BD contain two ""bonuses"". The first is a series of ""making of"" featurettes covering the directing, casting, music and script. There are seven of them that can be played separately or as ""all"". They are really short and total just 14 minutes, but worth watching. The other bonus is the full length commentary track by Director Dustin Hoffman.  I don't always have time to listen to these but, in this case, I'm glad I did. It is probably one of the best commentaries I've heard. Hoffman provides insight into many scenes and lets us know the many times the ""dream cast"" of actors for this ""independent"" film (thankfully picked up by the Weinstein brothers) are adlibbing their lines. There is just enough dialogue included to blend in with Hoffman's discussions to job your memory but not fill it with too much. The 98 minutes went by quickly and I felt I knew the film better after hearing Hoffman explain the casting and the need to some scenes.

I'll leave it to others to tell you about the plot - though I think you'll do best to discover it yourself.

With the great lines - and the great music - all filmed ""live""!;no lipsynching here -by real musicians and singers - this is a film you can watch again and find something new each time.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5515087,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"QUARTET is a delight!

Set in a home for retired musicians, this British comedy, directed by Dustin Hoffman, boasts a cast of some of the UK's most revered vintage performers, including Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Pauline Collins, Billy Connolly and Michael Gambon.

Beecham House is buzzing with activity.  The residents are preparing for their annual gala, and this year the event is particularly important because, if it is not a success, the retirement home might be forced to close.

Into this aged disorder comes a new resident (Smith), once an internationally renowned opera star, but now virtually broke and in need of a new hip.  She is also the former singing partner of Collins, Connolly and Courtenay, her former husband who has never forgiven her for her infidelity.

Can past transgressions be forgiven?  If so, then perhaps the revered opera quartet can stage a special reunion for the gala and thereby save Beecham House.

Ronald Harwood adapted his witty, quite touching stage play to the screen, and Hoffman has done a masterful job directing.  The cast is nothing short of absolute perfection.

Extras on the DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment include audio commentary by Hoffman, plus several ""Behind the scenes"" featurettes.

5515117,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"It took something like 72 years for Dustin Hoffman to direct his first film, but he did beautifully with his first one; QUARTET is a lovingly-made film, absolutely beautiful to look at, about a home for retired classical musicians and opera singers preparing for their yearly tribute concert to Verdi ... when a new resident - opera diva Jean Horton (the incomparable Maggie Smith) - moves in, disrupting the tranquil lives of three of the residents (including her ex-husband) who used to sing with her.

Funny, touching, but never pandering to a bunch of old-age stereotypes, the film's location shooting in the English countryside, in a beautiful old manor house, sets the perfect mood - and the performances of the four leads (Smith, Tom Courtenay, Billy Connolly, and the brilliant and charming Pauline Collins), as you learn more of their characters and their relationships with each other, makes for a sweet ride.

5515121,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"I rarely bother seeing movies in the theater any more.  Too expensive, and I can just wait for the DVD. However, I went to see Quartet three times in a row in the theater!!!  Each time with a different friend...each of whom loved it.  The reason it's great in the theater is because Director Dustin Hoffman OBVIOUSLY wants the audience to participate in the climax. Which, uniquely, takes place during the credits.  It was a little disappointing to see -- on two occasions -- how few people ""got"" this, and how many did not stay on for the credits (which takes place during the Quartet that the entire movie is building up to).

The one time the audience did understand, there was a great ovation, which is obviously what the Director is ""asking"" -- for the audience to participate.  But Hoffman has a special surprise for those patient enough for the credits.  Brilliant end. Kudos to Hoffman....or whoever thought of that idea with the credits.

Still...even without a theater audience to participate, this is a feel good movie which I will be buying to add to my list of 4 movies I can watch over and over, and still love.  And I will be ordering it as gifts for several friends and family, as it wasn't widely distributed at the ""big chain"" theaters.

Great Cast! Billy Connolly steals (and makes) the show, playing a classy and exceptionally charming version of himself -- with a hair cut.  Dame Maggie's character, Jean Horton, is a beautifully crafted opposite of the very endearing-with occasional bouts of dementia -- Pauline Collins' character Cissy. The late-in-life healing of a love gone bad reminds us all of many lessons in life.  And the entire movie is a great illustration of both the tragedy of aging, but the salvation of a supportive community, as well as paying homage to aging talent....which may live on for many, many years after the ""glory days"" are over.

Sheridon Smith's character of Dr. Lucy Cogan is an inspiration for all of us. This character's tenderness and appreciation for and genuine love of those who have dedicated their lives to the classical performing arts is a beautiful metaphor for how all those who have given so much in their prime would be treated in old age, were it a perfect world. She is a beauty inside and out. As Connolly's character says, she's the craic.

I'm not even an opera fan, but I truly loved the music. It keeps on playing in my head. And the comparison between Opera and rap in the movie -- during an educational class with very modern teenagers -- is brilliant and fun.

5515122,3,B00AW9M3XQ,"""Quartet"" tells the story of 4 former opera singers who, having grown old, are residing in an assisted living facility in England. There is plenty of drama as they, and other musicians and singers, prepare for an annual concert fundraiser that will literally save their home. Old flames face off over decades-old affairs, prima donnas have not grown mellower with age, and sickness threatens to derail everyone's plans. It was wonderful that so many actual opera and music stars of past years participated in the film.

Now, the downside.

It was more than a little unbelievable that elderly singers were able to belt out arias as well as they could in their prime. Overdubbing was rampant. Decades-long doubts and animosities were vanquished in a trice. Debilitating sicknesses disappeared miraculously just in the time for the big show. ""Quartet"" is the kind of film that gets it laughs from seeing old folks drop F-bombs and from elderly men urinating in public and acting like horny teenagers. Not much effort went into trying to make the situations believable. The able actors, notably Maggie Smith, mostly mug their way through their scenes. Michael Gambon, dressed in Oriental gown jacket and cap, seems to reprise his role as Aldus Dumbledore, sans the beard and glasses. Thumbs down to Dustin Hoffman as the film's director.

Still, the audience, made up of mostly of the elderly, loved the movie and gave it an ovation at the end. ""Quartet"" is a sweet movie that  could have been something, if only it had tried.",1366934400,6,1522,4.93359375

A very simple and beautiful message is delivered; A society can be judged and measured by the degree to which it protects and fosters the dignity of the elderly, and creates a context in which they can hold onto a creative, human identity, rather than what is done to our elderly today, which is, to be thrown into a Nursing home, overmedicated, and treated like a side of beef on Metamucil, to be gotten out of the way, and hastened into the next world, so that the living can inherit their money, and the politicians get away with cutting the budget which is allowing them to ""live too long"", at too high a cost. As long as people live, they have within them a spark of beauty, and goodness, that makes every breath they take and every minute they live a precious gift. Why shouldn't every senior citizen home have music, and celebrate the life of Giuseppe Verdi? Dustin Hoffman, who is now 75, directs this beautiful film as a understated but forceful reminder that every life is a life worth living, especially those like the aged who are marginalized to a degree that is frightening. Verdi lived and composed late into life, til his 90's. Ironically, some of the most beautiful creations of musical art were the gifts of the man who in today's United Kingdom, (the setting for this movie) would be put into hospice against his will, given Morphine, and starved to death by the British Health system to save money, years before he was done composing.

This should be perfect, for she once collaborated with Reg (Tom Courtenay), Wilf (Billy Connolly), and Cissy (Pauline Collins), to perform Verdi's ""Rigoletto,"" but Jean - Reg's former wife - refuses to sing.

The screenplay is written by Ronald Harwood, based on his own play. The veteran writer is known as screenwriter for such wonderful works as ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"" ""The Pianist,"" and ""The Dresser"" (the last starring Tom Courtenay). With a rather conventional storyline, ""Quartet"" may not be among his best, but it is still enjoyable with likeable characters.

Jumayn Hunter (""Attack the Block"") briefly appears as an avid hip-hop fan, engaging in a debate with Reg teaching opera over similarities of two music styles. You may also enjoy seeing real-life opera singers and musicians including Dame Gwyneth Jones (don't miss the end credits). And of course, the film has great music. In short ""Quartet"" is a charming film with great performances.",1366502400,2,1442,5.343612334801762
5515126,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"Luckily I got to see this at the theatre. Marvelous film of retired musicians and singers at a retirement home in England. If you enjoy characters and great acting, this one is for you. Also a great directing debut for Dustin Hoffman. Maggie Smith is fabulous as the opera diva Jean. Very highly reccommended.",1365984000,2,309,4.7407407407407405
5515167,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"Only the BBC and Great Britain could produce such a film on retired musical artists, mostly musicians and opera singers. They are not guaranteed a long, slow and inactive aging period leading to their eventual dismissal but they are expected to go on practicing their arts, singing and playing, together if possible? and performing a few times a year to remain active and hence not simply survive but still create, produce, and enrich their collective lot, not out of pity or from charity from the public but because they provide that public with all kinds of real services, classes, lectures, concerts, etc.

This film is exceptional since the average age of the actors is 178 or is it 198 years, so says one of them, but they are escaping depression and self-abandonment because they perform together for themselves and for a public that they invite, that come to learn from them. That film is a beautiful gospel of hope for the aging population in our countries. They must not be dependent, even and especially on the state, but they must keep the control of their life and their economic resources. A man can only be a man if he produces added value and that does not stop when you retire. Retiring is a humane solution for those who don't have their physical and mental health or enough of these physical and mental means to still be able to create, to teach, to bring something to other people, younger people or not so young people. In international humanitarian NGOs one can volunteer up to the age of NINETY-NINE years.

So this film, produced and directed by the aging Dustin Hoffman (he is seventy-five years old, since he was a child of the New Deal), is the proof that life and the show must go on, no matter what. The film is full of empathy, humor, living power and force, constant and permanent energy: what am I going to do today? Of course I am going to play some music, do some singing, read a book, but also meet the others here and do these things with them, with passion, with emotion, with sympathy and at times compassion. I will share my emotions and passions with the others who will share their passions and emotions with me. I may take a walk and sit in the garden, go down town and enjoy looking at the cars going by, the children getting out of school, the salespeople in the stores where I will buy a trinket or a ballpoint pen just to be able to speak to the salesperson there. I may flirt or simply be nice and friendly with the unknown people I meet at the bus stop or in the streetcar, on the train, or anywhere indeed. Most of them will either shrug me off silently or just answer nicely: I have the age that brings respect and even help if I need some, and a few words often are all the help I need.

People around me are just like elephants in the jungle. If I don't block the way, they may go by without noticing me, or smile at me for no reason whatsoever except that I am old enough to be smiled at, or even provided with a few words and a hand to hold a door, to help me up or down some stairs.

This film is just showing this macrocosmic reality of aging in a society that does not seem to age at all, along with the microcosmic reality of everyday tensions, emotions, feelings, happiness or satisfaction. And the film shows how you must not overdo it. That's when you really get senile: you don't see others at all and you escape into an invisible reality that is only material in your mind, or you invade the people around you with your own sentiments, feelings and obsessions without seeing that it is not an exchange but a drone from your mind onto the people around you.

And when that balance is kept, between these two extremes, you can have some very pleasant moments of real sharing that will enlighten your life, and their life, till the end of the trip. Yes indeed the objective is to get married again with the people of your generation, and also with people from younger generations, and marriage is sharing and doing together. That's what marriage for all means for me.

A very sensitive and endearing film about an essential stake of the present and the coming decades.

5515168,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"Set in a retirement home for musicians, QUARTET tells the story of a group of people, each with their own story to tell, who learn how to live with one another and grow old gracefully.  Billy Connolly's Wilf is an incorrigible flirt, with a penchant for finding alcohol stashed away in a greenhouse.  Tom Courtenay's Reggie, a retired opera singer, tries to come to terms with his past; especially when he encounters his ex-wife Jean (Maggie Smith), a proud operatic diva forced to live at the home because she has no money.  The two of them begin by not speaking to each other, but their relationship softens in the end.  For me Pauline Collins' standout performance as Cissie is the film's most memorable aspect; her portrayal of a woman suffering from Alzheimer's is both funny and poignant.  The supporting cast is just wonderful: I loved David Ryall and Trevor Peacock impersonating Flanagan and Allen, while Michael Gambon blusters and preens as a conceited director.  Beautifully photographed in autumnal colors - matching the mood of the piece - QUARTET quite literally left me with tears of joy in my eyes, and that rarely happens.",1364515200,3,1140,4.880829015544041

5515170,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"Many others have written lengthy and accurate views.  I'll not waste your time on more words.
I found this film spectacular.  A line I remember, ""Your repeating yourself.""  The lead tenor, Gene Horton's love (Maggie Smith) responds, ""In opera we're always repeating ourselves.""  The film is about a group of old people trying to recreate those golden moments of flow from their past lives.  Are we not all like that, or don't we all attempt it, but so few succeed.  This group at the retirement home actually pulls it off.  The quartet does put on a very respectable quartet from the end of Rigoletto - the most magnificent quartet music ever written.  The credits are astounding.  I stayed till the end.  All the actors are not actors;  they are retired musicians.  They play and sing all the music in the film.  Their images, from their prime, fill the right hand of the screen as the credits roll by:  la Scala, Covent Gardens, the Met, Frank Sinatra's orchestra, D'Oyly Carte and many others.  What a stunningly elegant touch;  it must be Hoffman's idea.
This film is a must see.",1362960000,19,1083,4.680851063829787
5515171,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"At the age of 75, Dustin Hoffman appears to be looking for a second career as a director.  And from the look and feel of this, his first attempt, he should have some success.  The film centers on a retirement home in pastoral England, established for aging musicians, classical musicians specifically.  Four residents in particular drive the story.

Reggie (Tom Courtenay) and Wilf (Billy Connolly) and Cissy (Pauline Collins) are soon joined by a true opera star, Jean Horton (Maggie Smith) who was once part of their quartet and had a brief marriage to Reggie.  Years earlier with her career about to take off, she left the group and her husband and never looked back.  Reggie in particular isn't about to reconcile.  Michael Gambon also stars as Cedric who fancies himself as a producer/director and is putting together a live performance with the residents.  You know, to make money and save the home from possibly closing.

Like this plot gimmick, ""Quartet"" doesn't break any new ground and is predictable to a fault.  At the same time the film is light hearted, funny and contains some spirited dialog, most of which belongs to Wilf.  There's also a nice scene when Reggie has a group of teens over for a lecture of sorts.  He gets into an exchange with a young man about the differences between opera and rap music.  Entertaining and insightful as is the whole movie.",1362787200,10,1374,4.771186440677966

5515173,3,B00AW9M3XQ,"If you're going to make a movie about opera singers, the first rule is to cast someone who is at least plausible in the role.  Maggie Smith is one of my favorite actresses, and I'd go see a door open if she was in it, but, despite all her formidable talents, nothing about her suggests that she's got the ability to loft an aria.  She doesn't open her mouth wide enough to to get much more than an acidic remark through, and with a voice somewhere between sand paper and a cat's purr.  Meryl Streep would have been a much better choice.  Fortunately, Dustin Hoffman spares us the embarrassment of having to listen to her try, but with what amounts to a swindle;  we know that we've just been robbed, but of something we were so nervous about being caught with that it's something of a relief.  Still...

This should not be interpreted as a slur against the talent in this movie.  The Quartet of actors at the center, while not from the Opera, are a diverse bunch of experienced actors that are a pleasure to watch, and the cast in the background is largely composed of former opera divas, cast members, and symphony orchestra members.  Something like ""Sunset Boulevard"" although as noted, Maggie Smith is not to Opera, what Gloria Swanson was to the Silent Screen.

And, it's something of a relief that the trailer doesn't give everything away.  It turns out that, even with the ""F""bomb, it's Maggie Smith's character who's to blame, not the gentleman.  It seems that Tom Courtenay and Smith's characters were very briefly married until someone went astray and an attempt at honesty misfired and, well time passes very quickly...  In any case, the love story is one of two plots that intertwine within the main story, that being the need to have a concert to raise funds such that the grand old English country home can be preserved as a home for aged Musicians.  The old hams have to sing for their bread.  Why not, the Girl Scouts have to do it.  Thus, when Smith lands at the coop, the Quartet is once again together, so logically it would seem they should be the top bill of the night.  Maggie Smith's  Jean, disagrees, and that's the movie, well, getting past that...

About that ""F"" Bomb.  Apparently Ms. Smith swears like a sailor off stage, and while I have no problem with that, I wouldn't have minded if she played a character more like herself, off stage (whatever that may be), where such language might be more integral to the story.  Having a woman of such dignity suddenly spout vulgarisms is a bit tacky.  What next?  Nudity?  Diane Keaton did it.  Must we see them all naked?

Maggie Smith is big these days.  Movies about and for an older audience are big money makers.  It's a bit much to expect everything she's in to be like ""A Room With A View"" or ""Downton Abbey"".  I don't think this will be listed among her best movies.  If you wait until it's available to be streamed, then you'll save a quite a bit of money and may well find this movie to be more to your liking.  I went out to the theater, which I rarely do these days, sat through the commercials and spent over $30. for two people with a popcorn and diet coke, and it's not worth nearly that much effort and money.  Not by a long shot.",1362441600,9,3216,4.444444444444445
5515174,5,B00AW9M3XQ,"It is so refreshing to see a movie not about tattooed teenage angst and to have two of them-- I'm referring now to ""Marigold Hotel"" in the space of a few months is quite a gift to movie-goers. ""Quartet"" is based on the play by Ronald Harwood and directed by Dustin Hoffman in his directorial debut at the age of seventy-five. The wait was worth it. It has been a very long time since he thrilled us with ""The Graduate"" and ""Midnight Cowboy.""

A retirement home for musicians! What a wonderful concept! The movie has everything going for it: the stellar cast is headed by that grand dame Maggie Smith, and the music of course is beautiful. And can there be a more poignant moving theme than that of love in old age. To paraphrase a bit from Tennyson's poem ""Ulysses,"" while these singers may not be those that in old age moved earth and heaven-- and opera lovers too-- they are still standing and surviving.

One of the pluses about the film is that the supporting characters are all actual singers and other musicians. When the credits come up, photographs of the performers from their heyday are juxtaposed with stills from them in the movie.

I saw this film at least three weeks ago and am still basking in the afterglow.

5515175,4,B00AW9M3XQ,"The other reviewers are correct in their assesments. A pleasant enough foray into what life is like in one's
crumbling 80's. Anyone familiar with assisted living facilities know what a fantasy this movie is. This one saving grace for the film, is that  it may well serve to underscore how poor many such ""homes"" are. This ""Beecham House"" is grand and opulent alright...it's what we all wish for. Sadly few of us will ever experience anything close to this . We should. My loved one works in just these environments. It is not uncommon for a ""participant"" to have to be shown where the bathroom is every day-although one such woman could still play the piano beautifully! Couching octegenarians in visual comfort and beauty to me would be a noble thing for any civilized society to think about seriously. So the concept is a good one, and we thank Dustin for his foray into producing and directing.

My objection has to do with movie houses in general, and in particular the sound, the voices, the dialogue. You've experienced, those of you over 60,...loss of some eyesight and hearing...and straining to hear what is being said! I am not the only person to complain bitterly about the abominable work by so called sound technicians. It's likely they have ""golden ears""...meaning they can have background noises or music at 86  decibels, and the voices, the speech at 77 decibels...and hear it all just fine. Not the rest of us! a 9 decibel spread means you ""halve"" the loudness, halve it again, and halve that again...and there you have the speech, burried under a mound of pillows. Add to that, the deplorable trend in all movies today of mumbling...lips not moving at alll, all speech gargled in the back of the throat. If the sound technician rather knows that people over 60 will be coming to the theater...to overlook the fact that they can't hear well borders on cruelty. I heard, perhaps, one tenth of the dialogues! That left me with one thing only...read body language, and just enjoy the  scenery..and short snippets of music. Building ever more clsoely to the grand quartet finale, alas, we discover our fabulous actors can't sing!...We are treated to the gloriously beautiful quartet during during the titles ONLY at the end of the movie ! !...some professionals singing it. This all by itself is anticlimactic. So we feel cheated a bit, misled, but worst of all...cheated out of hearing what they were all saying!

Now of course all the bombastic pre-movie ads, and stunning graphics...is accompanied by THUNDEROUS sound...up there with a NASCAR race track...then the movie begins, and the sound pressure level drops by a good 80%. And you sit there thinking...oh hell! Why do they do that? I'm sure producers have steered movies toward everyone under 25...thinking, oh old people don't matter, and don't care about movies. Yes we do! The movie industry doesn't care enough to make certain actors speak clearly and distinctly. Remember Humphry Bogart? John Wayne? I can think of dozens more...all of whom spoke clearly. But not these sorry excuses for actors today, and their sorry excuses for sound technicians. This oversight makes this movie one soon to be forgotten. Think about this....there were about 6 people in the movie house!  And still the movie industry doesn't understand why? I'm telling them why. Those of us who can afford to go to the movies can't hear what is being said! And a young people are just 'downloading' movies, ...which is NOT going to the movies! This is the hand writing on the wall for the end of movie houses. Six people! Sheesh. That is a wretched failure on the part of everyone involved.

5515176,3,B00AW9M3XQ,"Outstanding cinematography, beautiful sets and an attempt at telling an engaging story characterize this movie. An English country estate for retired musicians is on a continuing mission to remain self-sustaining.  It houses a group of remarkably talented people who seem well cared for, but have few visitors. It's a pretty isolated country place, almost no interaction with the outside world until their annual fundraising event. This situation deserved to be explored further, but instead the script takes a shortcut and focuses on an old love rekindled. Speeding through relational issues (which in reality can be tricky) made the last half of the movie end on a sweet note. I hope this comment does not discourage either the exceptional actors nor Mr. Hoffman from trying again. It's important to remember that senior moviegoers are seasoned readers who expect a strong storyline and  multi-dimensional characters.
