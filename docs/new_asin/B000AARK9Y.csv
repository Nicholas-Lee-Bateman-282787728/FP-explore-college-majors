8077467,5,B000AARK9Y,"What a superb, undervalued and often overlooked series.  The series is divided into two collections, from 1939-1942, and from 1942-1945, comprising a total of 39 episodes.  The 24 minute episodes are fast paced, action packed, and contain a great deal of very dramatic footage that I'd never seen in the 200 or so hours of WWII documentaries I've viewed.

There are some stock scenes, yes, but not annoyingly many, and the only time I remember seeing repeated scenes was a few times in the segments treating of the African Campaign.

The testimony of former soldiers, one each on opposing sides per episode, were illuminating and at times, quite humorous.  Jim Bishop does a solid job of narration. Personally, I like this series better than Victory at Sea, but I suppose that's a matter of taste.

One nit.  The person or persons responsible for compiling the dvds places the Battle for Paris on disc 2 with a date of (1940).  The Battle for Paris, which the series' narration gets right, occurred in 1944.  Had the Battle of France been placed there, it would have been in the right chronological order, which the compiler probably mistook it for.

But this is a quibble.  One can easily view the episode in proper chronology if one owns both sets.  I started the collection five days ago and only have one to go to complete both sets. Great!",1428710400,,1344,4.721030042918455
8077468,5,B000AARK9Y,"This is a classic  series  from the  past , which  shows some of the  critical battles of  world  war II from the  perspective of  1 allied and one  axis  soldier, silor or airman. Nice to see it without the commericals.",1403308800,,220,4.25
8077469,4,B000AARK9Y,I remember this show from the mid 60's. It came on at 7:30 pm. As a child I was fascinated by the images and the music. Now as an adult I also enjoy the history as told via Mr. Bishop's narration. Picture and sound are excellent.,1294790400,3,229,4.0
8077470,4,B000AARK9Y,"""Battleline"" was an old black and white TV show produced by Sherman Grinberg.

I remember watching this show after school when I was growing up.

These two DVD sets each have 5 disks, according to the Internets.

There are also some VHS tapes with the ""Battleline"" title listed, but they appear to be a Time-Life series.

Buy these instead.  ""Battleline"" was a good TV show about the war.

Time-Life stuff about the war is usually crappy and full of the Luce family's limo liberal propaganda.  Corporate media stink.",1278720000,2,516,4.795454545454546
