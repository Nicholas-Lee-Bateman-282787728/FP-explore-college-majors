528847,3,6302985935,"Basically, this is a collection of Irving Berlin songs. The plot (if you can call it that) adds nothing. The songs are well sung. This would have been a more enjoyable DVD if they had eliminated the story and simply presented a concert of the songs, replacing the dialog with more songs. However, since the price of this DVD is less than most CDs, I suppose one shouldn't complain too much.",1100908800,5,390,4.507042253521127
528848,3,6302985935,"Film: *****  Extras: *****  DVD Transfer Quality: BOMB

Another huge disappointment from Fox Home Video.  ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" was 20th Century-Fox's most prestigious production of 1938, featuring three of the studio's biggest box office draws (Tyrone Power, Alice Faye, and Don Ameche); a marvelous supporting cast led by Ethel Merman, Jean Hersholt, and John Carradine; outstanding direction by veteran Henry King; and a slight but entertaining script that showcased more than two dozen of prolific songwriter Irving Berlin's most beloved melodies.  The prototype for the big budget musicals that Fox would perfect in the 1940's, the film was a huge hit with the public and critics alike, garnering six Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) and winning the statuette for Best Music Scoring.

One might think that Fox would take special care in mastering such a revered film for its DVD release - especially when releasing it under the Fox ""Studio Classics"" banner - but one would be wrong.  Although the film's soundtrack has been painstakingly preserved, the visuals are inexcusably shoddy. Specifically, there is a visual noise line that appears in the midst of Chapter 8 (during the song ""Now It Can Be Told"") and continues to disrupt the picture for the remaining hour or so of the film.  This distortion never appeared on the various prints shown on pay cable stations during the past 20 years, and should not appear in a home video release that purports to be ""restored"".

This major and obnoxious glitch is especially upsetting because the rest of the DVD is so appealing.  The extras include 3 rarely seen musical sequences that were deleted from the final cut of the film; the Original Theatrical Trailer; Fox Movietone News footage of the film's British premiere (fascinating to see the English hoopla surrounding this quintessentially American feature); and best of all, the full-length A&E Biography segment, ""Alice Faye: The Girl Next Door"".  If only the film itself were as lovingly presented as the wonderful bonus materials, this would be a must-have DVD.  A pity.",1096588800,68,2093,5.178041543026707

Beautiful songs performed with all the style and glamour of that era, charming people to cheer for and hurt with, the universal element of true love . . . all this makes for a classic.
One of the nitpicks, of course, is that none of them age a day throughout the entire movie.  And the eerie feeling you get from the taxi driver seems better suited for a mystery or a suspense, not a musical such as this.
Alice Faye (spunky and sincere) and Ethel Merman (smooth yet practical) both singing to Tyrone Power (handsome as ever) is rather amusing.  The songs, including ""Blue Skies"" which both lead ladies sing, are some of Irving Berlin's best.",970531200,9,787,4.458333333333333

Add Ameche (Pianist in the band, and long time friend it's leader) to mix, and we have a little love triangle involved.  I love most of the old movies, especially, involving music--this is no exception.  The movie loosely adapts the story of Irving Berlin's rise to fame.

529067,4,6302985935,"Because Fox's disaster movie (with musical numbers) IN OLD CHICAGO was such a big hit, the studio decided to try again with the same troika of stars  (Alice Faye, Tyrone Power, and Don Ameche), but this time in a complete musical, a celebration of the music of Irving Berlin and they came up with what was not only yet another hit but a film that would set the pattern for their many expensive big budget musicals for over a decade. The plot is ridiculous: Power is a  musician whose Nob Hill family rejects him when he starts a ragtime band featuring Faye, as a trashy Barbary Coast chanteuse with whom Power strikes sparks (and somehow Ameche is involved in this too so the three become a love triangle). But, the story doesn't get much in the way of its more than twenty Irving Berlin musical numbers which are carried off with joy and gusto.

The film is something of a revelation if you're mostly familiar with Berlin from his later and more square songs from his later family-friendly musicals; this film shows the fresher and sassier side of Berlin from the early part of the century, first with the ragtime numbers that made his name (the title song, ""The International Rag,"" ""Ev'rybody's Doing It"") and then with his fun jazz-inflected numbers from the 20s. Faye is undeniably the star of the whole thing, and she has great fun swinging the early ragtime numbers, but of course she was most famous for her slow heartbreaking ballads that allowed her to use the full expressiveness of her great mellow voice, so the filmmakers had the terrific idea of allowing her character to start a career singing romantic ballads and be replaced in Power's band by the young Ethel Merman, who is nothing here like the later campy gorgon she became. Slender, zesty and fun, Merman pulls off big numbers like ""My Walking Stick"" (which she sings in male drag) with great joy, and the director has a lovely sequence where he keeps cutting between Faye's mellow ballads and Merman's snazzy showpieces. Of course the two women were perhaps the most famous of Berlin's interpreters (and two of his favorites), and there's a great moment when Merman sings the first verses of ""Blue Skies,"" which she sings with jazzy optimism, and then turns it over to Faye, who finishes it slowly, beautifully, expressively. The women don't get in each other's way, and they beautifully complement one another. (At one point, the film even allows Merman to sing a few sweet bars of Berlin's ""Say It With Music"" to Power, and you see that just as Faye could swing the ragtime songs Merman also had the ability--so rarely shown in her later years!--of singing tender numbers with sensitivity and grace.) Also with John Carradine, in a bizarre bit near the end as a cabdriver who brings Faye to her destiny at Carnegie Hall; his sinister looks make you think for a moment he's going to drive her instead to her doom. There are a number of intriguing extras, including a biographical documentary about Alice Faye narrated by Peter Graves.",1269561600,,3007,4.723809523809524

I have listened to many DVD audio commentaries, and they range in quality from very good to very bad. This audio commentary is, without a doubt, one of the best I have ever heard. Other distributors of DVD's should listen to this audio commentary as an example of how it should be done! There are other good extras on this DVD, including an A&E Biography on Alice Faye, three deleted musical numbers in pristine condition, and newsreel footage of the London premiere.

A word about the DVD transfer quality - I have noticed that some of the other reviewers on Amazon.com have carped about the picture quality, saying that it is supposedly ""terrible"". Trust me, this is not true! The only defect is a faint vertical line that runs through the picture that looks like a scratch on the original negative. However, the viewer becomes so engrossed in the film that he forgets all about that faint line, and it does not distract at all. Some of these other critics who are complaining about the picture quality of this DVD - well, they just need to get a life! I can certainly live with that faint line. We're lucky this film even exists at all, as the film stock on which movies were made before the 1950s was nitrate based, which dissolved after a few decades. Because of this, many old movies have disintegrated and are totally unavailable today for viewing. So take your pick - a faint vertical line in the picture, or nothing. If you have any doubts about the picture quality, rent it first through Netflix (like I did), then buy it on Amazon.com.

A classic Musical. I was eager to see this film after reading about the deleted scenes. While the deleted scenes are good, I did not miss them from the film at all.

Acting is good and the music great. I thought that this movie showed both Tyron Power and Alice Faye at their best. An enjoyable viewing!!",1220313600,2,470,6.444444444444445
529114,4,6302985935,"Alexander's Ragtime Band is one of the very best musicals ever produced by Fox Studios. Of course, the numerous song and dance numbers are beautifully staged; and the songs by Irving Berlin are performed flawlessly by greats Alice Faye, Don Ameche, and a young Ethel Merman. The action moves along at a good pace and the acting was extremely convincing.

The action begins in the early 1900s in San Francisco. A young man from a wealthy society family named Roger Grant (Tyrone Power) just can't stand playing classical music even though he's very good at it. Instead, to the dismay of his family, he forms a ragtime early swing era band and calls it Alexander's Ragtime Band. He even changes his name to Alexander! That's when Alexander and his buddies Charlie Dwyer (Don Ameche) and drummer Davey Lane (Jack Haley) meet up with tough talking Stella Kirby (Alice Faye); but soon Stella is singing with the band.

Romance inevitably blossoms. Eventually, after a few misunderstandings, Stella and Alexander are in love. However, when Stella gets her big break to leave the band and go to New York to star in big Broadway shows, Alexander is furious that she would leave the band behind. Only Charlie sticks up for Stella; and in a fit of rage Alexander tells Charlie that he should also go to New York with Stella.

World War One sets in and Alexander tries to forget about Stella. After the war Alexander returns--only to find that Stella, who he still loves, married Charlie back home during the war. Alexander is depressed but Davey introduces him to Jerry Allen (Ethel Merman). Jerry replaces Stella in their band act and Alexander tries to see if he can find romance with Jerry instead of Stella.

The plot can go in many different directions from here. What happens to Stella after she becomes a huge star and marries Charlie? Is she happy with that life or does she want something else? Will Jerry Allen take Alexander's mind off Stella--at one point Alexander actually asks Jerry to marry him--how will that turn out? No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!

The DVD has some rather good extras. There is the ""biography channel"" episode of the life and career of Alice Faye; this is very well done. We also get deleted scenes and footage of the movie's premiere in London, England. There's even an audio commentary--terrific!

My only complaint--and it's somewhat minor--is that there IS a vertical, white line ""scratch"" on the screen starting about 35 minutes into the picture and it never really goes away although it is less noticeable in many subsequent scenes. I will take off one star for this flaw; this will be a four star review.

Alexander's Ragtime Band is an excellent motion picture musical from the golden age of Hollywood. I highly recommend this for fans of classic musicals.",1208390400,17,2838,4.80327868852459
529115,5,6302985935,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this movie is a gem--an unlikely, busily bizarre plot and curious collection of actors fueled by the songs of America's arguably best and inarguably most indispensable composer.  A highlight is ""Blue Skies,"" on which one of the women competing for the affections of Tyrone Power sings the part that's in a minor key and the other (at that moment with the best angle on a piece of Power) the part in a major key.  Perhaps the best Berlin musical on film, more intricately plotted than ""Annie Get Your Gun"" and not the lumbering behemoth production that was its 1950s descendent, ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" (though the latter's ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" number is admittedly Hollywood excess at its most excessive, worth having as a complement to the version on this earlier B&W version).

The slipshod transfer of these early Fox Classics to DVD, some markedly inferior to the previous VHS editions, is I'm afraid another symptom of cultural amnesia and growing indifference to a golden albeit non-digital age.",1204848000,4,1061,5.051428571428572
529116,5,6302985935,"Alexander's Ragtime Band was a huge production for 20th Century Fox in 1938 and it still looks it all these years later. It it incredibly musical , packed full of songs and is extremely dramatic and touching - it is still highly entertaining and Tyrone Power, Alice Faye, Don Ameche & Ethel Merman do some of their very best screen work in this film.

It also boast an excellent supporting cast and Paul Hurst and David Carradine to name but two are great. This film has been giving me a lump in my throat since I first saw it on BBC Two in the late 1960 's ( it was the first Fox film shown on British television ) and the taxi cab scene towards the end still gets me. It is a wonderul example of ""everything"" coming together in a movie and delivering and although it is probably corny by today's standards I wish there were more movies like it.

This film knocks so many raved about musicals off the list - it is unpretentious , entertaining and incredibly touching.

Thank goodnes it finally made it to DVd - not the best transfer but the negative for ARB is worn as Fox forever used it to reprint from over 30 years. The extras are good - original trailer is great as is the newsreel of the London premiere with Gracie Fields .",1181174400,5,1231,4.274678111587983

529118,5,6302985935,"I'll keep my review brief. I'm not sure what the previous reviewers were referring to in regards to picture & sound quality. Both are excellent and most likely transferred from first generation master tape. The music and singing are terrific. An appearance from a young Ethel Merman was a great surprise. Tyrone Power is as charming & handsome as ever. Beautiful Alice Faye is in fine vocal form with several classic songs. Don Ameche is as suave & debonair as always. A nice romantic triangle between the three keeps the plot and songs moving along at a good pace. I think this is Ms. Faye's finest performance next to ""In Old Chicago"", in which she wowed me by singing my state song ""Carry Me Back to Old Virginny."" A great family movie showcasing the amazing Irving Berlin's talent.",1171152000,4,785,4.695652173913044

529150,5,6302985935,"Irving Berlin once said that he would rather have Alice Faye introduce his songs over anyone else. Who could blame him? This film is packed with great Berlin songs, the wonderful voice of Alice Faye and two of the top screen stars of their day, Tyrone Power and Don Ameche. This film introduces some Berlin classics and is the first time ""Easter Parade"" is featured on film. A must buy for fans of film musicals.",1168300800,,412,4.506666666666667
529151,3,6302985935,"I watched this movie because I noted that it was an Oscar winner in 1938 for Best Music (it was nominated for a few more including Best Picture).  I must admit that the plot has nothing to offer that you haven't seen dozens of times before.  What makes it worthwhile is the music that it won the Oscar for.  The highlight is the two or three numbers that a younger, slimmer Ethel Merman got to sing.  I had forgotten that she was in the cast so I wasn't paying much attention until I heard her start to belt out a song as only she can do.  I don't know why Alice Faye was given the top female role as a singer if Ethel was going to be in the cast.  I suppose she had the bigger name back then but you can't hide a voice like Merman's.  There is some good orchestration in the movie as well.  Irving Berlin is credited with the lyrics and music but I think some of the songs predated even him.  The acting was somewhat mediocre.  Tyrone Power was poorly cast to play anything but Tyrone Power.  Don Ameche was an improvement and there was some good dance routines included.  John Carradine showed his unique talent in a minor role.  This movie is strictly for the song and dance fans but it is definitely one that that group will enjoy.",1167436800,3,1235,4.2042553191489365
529152,4,6302985935,"Irving Berlin started it all, though this story is not a biopic. The only part he plays is as an unseen friend to a lower-class girl named Stella (Alice Faye) who sends her ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" which helps her get a job in a club and forces her together with two men that play a significant role in her life. ""Alex"" (Tyrone Power) is her mortal enemy, but the two become quite close after Charlie (Don Ameche), the man who loves her, brings them together. Pitfalls and love triangles make for an interesting story and the great music it is set to really keeps one's toes tapping.

Later on, Ethel Merman joins the story. She is certainly one of those singers who you love or hate, and I happen to hate her. She has a brash, obnoxious way of singing that is in stark contrast to Faye's creamy alto voice. However, these two polar opposites add variety to the film.

Also included on this DVD is a documentary about Faye from the A&E Biography series. It includes interviews from her daughter, Roddy McDowall, and Hugh Hefner and shows many clips from her relatively few films. It is an interesting watch.",1154563200,3,1109,4.54

529154,2,6302985935,"I was disappointed by this film. Tyrone Power, who is apparently devoid of musical talent, portrays a bandleader. Alice Faye, who can't carry a tune, is his Chantoozie. Ethel Merman, the one singer in the cast, never got to sing the title song! In later years she made it famous, probably to stick a finger in the eye of the producer. When ""Alex"" takes his band to Carnagie Hall in 1938, it is three times the size of the actual Benny Goodman orchestra that played the real gig the movie copies. Perhaps the saddest scenes of all are when Alex Haley, a decent hoofer, has to pretend to be a drummer. Good thing the beat was faster than his sticks! The one saving grace of the film is it was shot close to the period it portrays - so at least they got that right!",1141344000,,762,4.2620689655172415
529155,5,6302985935,"This film was a mammoth production in 1938 and contributed significantly to the emergence of 20th Century Fox as a major studio. Faye, Power and Ameche were box office dynamite. The film became the prototype for many Fox productions of the forties. Power and Faye fall in love, they part, she marries Ameche, achieves success, divorces Ameche and finally reunites with Power. As is often the case, the first version was the best. The story moves logically and may even draw a tear or two to the sentimental even if it is corny in typical Fox fashion.

The score is divided almost equally between the husky contralto of Alice Faye and the show stopping boom of Ethel Merman, with a couple of other numbers along the way from Jack Haley, Don Ameche etc. Over 25 Irving Berlin songs are featured. The musical arrangements progress with the story from small time ragtime to full blown Carnegie Hall Orchestra. Alfred Newman did a brilliant job.

The film is a showcase, above all, for the talents of Faye. Wallow in her signature warmth, humour and that indefinable star quality which annihilates Ethel Merman except, of course, when she sings. This is the film for which Alice Faye will be remembered. The film also shows the smooth direction and attention to detail typical of Henry King. The leads obviously liked each other and it shows even if Tyrone Power is wooden in his earnest display of an ambitious musician. Don Ameche, however, is very good in a difficult part which could easily have become VERY corny.

The print of the film is good enough but a white line appears down the left of the screen in some places. The package benefits from an excellent comentary by Ray Fiola, full of interesting information about how the film was put together but the commentary is out of sequence in the last third of the film. There are 3 pleasant musical numbers which were cut and one, in particular, ""Marching along with Time"", was a major loss because it played an important part both dramatically and musically in the progression of the story.  Ethel Merman gives a rousing rendition. The DVD also contains an episode of Biography about Alice Faye, made in fact while she was still alive. The theatrical trailer also contains footage of the film's gala preview at Grauman's Chinese Restaurant. Other newsreel footage contains the London premiere.

The total package is a gold mine of memorable even if dated entertainment but it is disappointing that the print is not perfect.",1126396800,8,2475,4.800469483568075
529156,3,6302985935,"Comparing it to other old musicals, say Singin' in the Rain or The Music Man is 10, Alexander's Ragtime Band is probably about 7, mainly due to the great Irving Berlin tunes.

Anyway, the plot is fairly standard, a love triangle between the members of the band, including Tyrone Power (as the leader, Alexander), Don Ameche (song writer), and Alice Faye (the band's singer).  Power and Faye start out with a love-hate relationship, but when they split up she ends up with Ameche; meanwhile Power fights in World War 1 and returns to form a new band with Ethel Merman singing.  Question is, who will finally get Alice Faye?

Here are some good performances by several great performers.  John Carradine is outstanding in a small but key role near the end.  There are many great Irving Berlin tunes, including Merman singing Blue Skies, Tropical Heat Wave, and others.  And the finale is the first and greatest swing tune of all: Alexander's Ragtime Band..",1115424000,4,953,4.809815950920245
529157,1,6302985935,Fox Studios obviously took a worn print that was shown 250 times on late night tv and slapped it onto a DVD format. This is a classic film that deserves better. What an absolute disgrace! The execs at Fox should be ashamed of themselves.,1106179200,55,237,4.409090909090909
529158,1,6302985935,"I love this movie. Its story is ridiculous. The main characters span 27 years but do not age. The dialogue is corny. But the SONGS, those great Irving Berlin songs, are performed with gusto by Alice Faye, Ethel Merman and many more. Add to that Alfred Newman's great musical direction, and Eddie Powell's orchestration and heaven is at your doorstep.

Unfortunately, this release has a blatant WHITE STRACTCH down the left side of the image for most of the film. It's so distracting it makes it hard to enjoy the film.  How could Fox do this, with their prestigious STUDIO CLASSIC series, which also by the way, could use a fresh coat of packaging paint. Their covers are awful.

The commentary by Ray Faiola is fun, the outtakes are fun, and the trailer looks TEN TIMES better than the movie.

C'mon Fox, pay attention and do a better job. This was a Best Picture nominee!",1102809600,32,873,4.612903225806452
529159,4,6302985935,"""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" is a red herring in musicals - a stagy, stilted fictional lament of the hardships of composer Irving Berlin, without Berlin's name ever surfacing from the deluge - except in the title sequence. It stars resident 20th Century Fox heartthrob Tyrone Power as Berlin's alter ego, the suave band leader `Alexander.' Smitten with the rather racy girl from the wrong side of the tracks, (Alice Faye), Al makes a few wrong turns and winds up lovelorn and bitter. However, true to the tripe of musical plotting he gets over his angst in style. Ethel Merman - fresh from Broadway - makes the most out of a series of hear-pounding musical sequences, the best probably being `Heat Wave' which closes the show. Don Ameche turns up for good measure and in good voice, along with the delightful comic styling of Jack Haley Sr. (best known to audiences as the Tin Man in ""The Wizard of Oz""). Darryl F. Zanuck lavished this fictional film bio with every ounce of sumptuousness that his studio could afford and every last dollar shows up on the screen. Even the set of the seedy bar which opens the story looks like Toot Shores for the rough trade. Despite its faint hint of formaldehyde, ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"" is a valiant addition to the Fox Studio Series DVD collection.

The transfer is remarkably clean and solid. There are moments where the image slightly jerks from left to right, but these are sporadic glitches in an otherwise flawless transfer. The gray scale has been impeccably remastered with deep, velvety blacks and very pristine whites. Occasionally one will note a slight hint of film grain but this is to be expected for a film that is 60 plus years old. There are no digital anomalies (edge enhancement, pixelization, shimmering of fine details) for a smooth video presentation that is sure to please. The audio is mono - as is to be expected - but has been very nicely cleaned up. Extras include several deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer and an exceptionally dense and engaging audio commentary. Bottom line; come on and hear and see ""Alexander's Ragtime Band."" It's a treat!",1102464000,3,2112,4.818181818181818
7833193,5,6302985935,I found this to be a terrific mostly upbeat musical with a lot of really great music! This was my introduction to Alice Faye and I loved her performance. Great singer and wonderful actress as well! She and Tyrone Power make a great screen couple. Don Ameche is very good as a key partner in the band and as a guy who is smitten by Alice. Ethel Merman has a supporting role in this and even though I really don't care for her very much I have to admit she does very well. All in all I found this to be a very well put together musical that is very enjoyable( and I am really not a fan of musicals in general!!). Highly recommended.,1525910400,,630,4.088709677419355
