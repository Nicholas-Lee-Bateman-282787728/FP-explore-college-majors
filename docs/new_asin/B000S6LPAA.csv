8204506,2,B000S6LPAA,"I was watching this movie and had to stop.  I had to stop because it's kinda bad.  I get that writing a script and actually filming it is not easy... that being said, this movie was bad.  This from a guy who actually digs some pretty out there B movies. I made it 37 minutes in and decided I will not waste anymore of my time waiting for it to get better.  It actually never does.",1510358400,,380,3.960526315789474
8204507,2,B000S6LPAA,"Completely underwhelmed doesn't begin to describe how I felt about this movie.  I can't think of anything good to say about it other than it did have a plot that stayed consistent throughout the movie, which is what kept me from rating it as one star.  Even within its own genre it couldn't generate a three star rating from me and I'm generally fairly easy on B movies.",1509408000,,370,4.426470588235294

8204509,3,B000S6LPAA,"That was a fun watch, good action, decent story and fun premise. Could have been better with a few of the plot elements, and dialogue, but overall it wasn't bad!",1507507200,2,161,4.4
8204510,2,B000S6LPAA,"In the beginning we see a woman named Dakota rolling around her basement floor and ultimately stabbing her leg with a needle.  She also stabs her belly and arm.  My gut feeling tells me this doesn't feel good.  She escapes and a couple friends go searching for her.  We soon learn they aren't friends- they're members of a dangerous wolfpack who demand she return to them at once.  We now see a woman take off in the woods, turn into a werewolf and run up the basement window of the needle-injected Dakota.  Dakota hides under a table, grabs a hammer and bashes the werewolf's head.  She punches and kicks it, then takes off running in the woods.  Dakota wipes the sweat off her forehead and throws the rag on the ground.  The werewolf smells the scent of the rag.  When Dakota finds a house and knocks on the door for help a man and woman let her in after questioning what she's doing running around in the woods at 1 in the morning.  The werewolf breaks into the house and attacks the man by slicing his face.  He kinda deserved it for criticizing teenagers.  Dakota and the werewolf fight in the house while Dakota tries to take the wife and get her out of there but the werewolf's too strong and drags Dakota away.

Then we hear cheesy 80's-style heavy metal with weak singing.  Dakota is now tied to a chair while a man threatens her.  This man is the leader of the wolfpack.  She says she wants to be normal but the man says he can't have her threatening their entire race.  The wolfpack leader says he knows Dakota struggles with this but she's meant to be with him.  He slaps Dakota so she jumps up and smacks him with a pan (since she untied her hands before the guy re-walked into the room).  We see an overweight guy dreaming he's having sex.  He wakes up and eats a sandwich while cutting the cheese and desperately needs an underwear change.  He walks into a room with the wolfpack who look at the floor and say ""Let her go for now"".  It's 6 months later.

We now see two nurses talking.  One nurse hides a syringe.  This is Dakota.  One cute nurse tries to get into her car but a group of thugs attack her.  These thugs are the wolfpack.  They tell the nurse not to struggle- it'll only make it worse.  Dakota appears and says ""She doesn't look to be having much fun!""  Dakota grabs one guy by the neck, kicks another in the testicles and wrestles the other to the ground before headbashing the female thug.  The man who tries bashing her with a metal pole makes a huge mistake because he's soon slammed into a nearby car and roundhouse kicked after he pulls a knife.  A knife to his back is too kind.  The nurse returns home after kicking all those wolfpack thug butts and injects her hand with werewolf morphing power.  She fights it off and returns to normal.  We see a wolf slashing something apart in the woods soon after.  We now see thugs having fun on a playground before a werewolf eats the guy who goes backwards down the slide.  It's clear the werewolf is just a man in a werewolf costume.  The werewolf ends this playground massacre by grabbing a man's heart and holding it up high.

The thug werewolves call each other sloppy since they've spent centuries walking around undetected.  The one guy says he was following a scent and fighting the change.  They want Dakota to return to their wolfpack group but she's... somewhere else around town in her own apartment.  She eats square chunks of raw meat for breakfast.  I'm more of a French toast guy myself.  She hears about the werewolf attacks on the radio.  The one thug stops two women walking their dog.  The dog stares into his werewolf eyes and starts barking.  The girls tell him to stop.  The wolfpack talk about paying Dakota a visit since they know she lives in an apartment.  They pay her a visit and the one says ""Maybe we can join you to (to attend a party) or maybe you can join us!""  The main werewolf thug points a gun towards Dakota's friend's forehead and pulls the trigger.  Weird gunk comes out of the gun but she dies anyway.

Dakota runs away to a bar.  The thugs follow her into the bathroom.  She hides in a stall and jumps on a guy while he's using the toilet.  The guy smiles when the wolfpack thugs open the door because she's able to crawl away.  He smiles like it's funny but the other thugs beat him up, and even punch and headbutt themselves by mistake, lol.  The owner of the bar takes Dakota to the boss.  She explains she was trying to get away from the werewolves.  Security escorts her outside while the man werewolf thug beats up security.  One guy tries fancy kick move but he's no match for the werewolf and gets tossed through a table and beat on.  Lots of kicking going on in this fight.  The female thug has a gun pointed towards Dakota.  We return to the fighting and it's still really intense.  Dakota walks outside to the parking lot and thanks the guy in the bathroom for helping her.  He didn't just help hide her, but also participated in all that kicking action!

The man takes Dakota home on his motorcycle and they kiss. A man points a gun at Dakota's new boyfriend while Dakota's haunted by werewolf attacks.  The thug wolves say to give Dakota time and she'll come back to them.  Dakota returns to the bar and the boss says she must want something.  She says she just wants to live like a normal person.  Dakota wants to know why her new boyfriend didn't pick her up in the morning like he promised.  The boss wants to know about the werewolves.  She says they're half human half wolf.  On a full moon they're the most powerful but on a partial moon they're not so powerful.  However on a partial moon they retain some of their human intelligence.  On a full moon their human instincts are all gone.  It looks like one guy is wearing a t-shirt for AC/DC's For Those About to Rock album cover.

The group talks about gathering weapons to take out the werewolf pack.  They hang low until morning.  The boss mentions a story when confronting the werewolves.  We see these people get shot in black and white.  The boss says to Dakota that the thug wolves will keep her boyfriend alive in order to get her back.  While the thug wolves try to think of a plan to get Dakota back, a homeless man tries to grab the bear bottle from the hand of the head wolf only to get backhanded.  Dakota wakes up and hears a weird, but strangely catchy tune on the radio about a cat lady.  A man sticks his hand over Dakota's mouth while a woman in the bathtub plays with her breasts in the other room.  When the man sneaks into the bathroom the woman pulls a gun on him.  The man wants to make sure she's prepared.  Her breasts are definitely prepared!

Dakota and her friends practice using their guns in the woods until Dakota sees her new boyfriend sitting in the kitchen of the nearby house and tied to a chair.  She says ""We can't leave him here!"" The one man of the group says to Dakota she has 60 seconds to get him out.  A woman gets her neck slashed as Dakota finds her new boyfriend tied to that chair.  The girl who gets her neck slashed then gets munched on by the werewolf.  The group picks up the girl with her throat chopped and runs away for help.  Dakota apologizes for dragging the group with them and admits she shouldn't have left.  The groups seemingly turns on Dakota before changing their minds and kicking the werewolf when it jumps out from the trees.  The werewolf grabs the man before he tries to shoot at the werewolf only to find out the gun isn't loaded.

Dakota drives her friends to the hospital as she reflects on the damage and destruction the werewolf caused her friends.  They stitch up the friend and Dakota says she can control the werewolf change by injecting potion into her skin.  Her friends say she better be able to control it ""Or we'll control this one *holds up some kind of pill* for you!""  While in the bathroom the leader of the wolfpack walks in and tells Dakota to come back to them or more friends of hers will have to die.  They'll free her new boyfriend if she re-joins the wolfpack.  In the bathroom Dakota mentions she cares for both her friend and her new boyfriend while dropping the towel and revealing her nude body.  She makes out with this man.  I like the song that plays here ""We're a little confused for the first time"" while Dakota makes out with this man.  Seriously an awesome musician!

The guy from the wolfpack tells Dakota's new boyfriend that he hasn't seen what the real Dakota looks like.  The guy from the wolfpack says ""We haven't had a full moon yet but give it time- love can be a very hairy situation!"" as everyone laughs (and one guy laughs a few seconds longer than he should which prompts the group to give him bad looks!) Dakota comes back and asks the wolfpack to let her new boyfriend go since she's returned.  The one guy in the group gets his hand stabbed.  Some shootings happens too.  The wolfpack turns into wolves with long teeth.  Dakota tries to escape with her new boyfriend.  The female thug of the wolfpack is in the woods surrounded by hairy wolves.  A hilarious moment when Dakota's in the woods, turns around and finds a wolf dog sitting behind her.  It was such a cheesy thing to do.  Outside in the dark more Mortal Kombat kicking ensues when the one man fights the werewolf.  The wolf gets angry and smacks him down.  The guy gets angry and shoots the werewolf.  On the third shot the werewolf explodes.

As Dakota and her boyfriend try to find a way to escape they're attacked by werewolves.  A wolf attacks and kills one person, but Dakota is able to quickly inject the wolf in the back with venom.  His teeth fall out and he peels his skin off.  Meanwhile Dakota gets into a kicking match with a woman.  On one occasions she even precisely times a perfect roundhouse kick.  Dakota's boyfriend comes in and shoots the werewolves.  Dakota's happy for the help.

Outside the boss of that bar gets into a fight with the werewolf.  He loses until Dakota injects the wolf with venom.  In the barn the boyfriend battles the werewolf as cheesy heavy metal plays.  It's hilarious how this scene jumps around so the boyfriend is suddenly fighting new wolves/people that just pop up out of nowhere!  People that we've never even seen before just appear and pick a fight with the guy, lol.  The boyfriend tries to stab someone with a 2x4 but dizzying effects make him drop the stick and morph into a werewolf.  He hits a button and the barn explodes.  Dakota tells the pack leader she found a way to live a normal life and always wanted to be alone but he kept finding and confronting her.  This leads to, you guessed it, another kick boxing match!  He mocks Dakota ""You're so much smarter than the wolfpack but what makes you think you're smarter than me!""  He adds ""I'm the alpha male around here, me!"" Just then Dakota's teeth turn long and her werewolf change over occurs.  She headbutts the wolf leader repeatedly.  Dakota's rather scary looking.  She knocks the wolf leader's head completely off his shoulders.  Awesome moment!

Dakota's one friend recommends shooting and killing her since she's in werewolf form and looks destructive, but the one guy says she doesn't know who she is so it's not worth it.  Dakota as a werewolf crawls on the ground.  She gets shot anyway.  The boss says he retires and says someone else can take over his business.  Dakota turns back to a regular girl and wakes up in a field.  She's holding a key.  Just then her boyfriend appears behind her... like magic!  They're happy.

Wow this movie's bad.  It seems there's more super cheesy Mortal Kombat style kickboxing going on than werewolf attacks, which means the blood is kept to a minimum and there's no suspense whatsoever.  The werewolves are clearly in costumes making me think this movie is a mockery.  The acting's beyond bad and the way characters just suddenly appear out of nowhere to place themselves in certain situation is hilarious!  This movie's so bad it's almost good.  Oh and the two catchy songs with the acoustic guitar really are awesome.  I'm still singing them!",1501027200,,12075,4.4359325125399
8204511,3,B000S6LPAA,"The film starts out rather bad, but then grows on you. I liked the idea for the film in spite of the bad execution. Dakota (Renee Porada) wants to leave her pack of werewolves. She has been able to control her changes by injecting herself with some medication she steals from the vet she works for. However, the pack insists she stays with them for some reason, and will kill anyone who comes in their way.

Dakota ends up making friends with Logan (Lanny Poffo) who along with his lackeys fights the werewolves. The film starts out with black and white footage, but then changes to color like the ""Wizard of Oz"" but this one didn't have any rhyme or reason. The special effects was ""rubber mask"" bad. The fight scenes ranged from very well done to LOL campy. The man who played Stick, was also the writer and director of this low budget, shot in Erie, Pa., production.

On the plus side was the original soundtrack which had music and lyrics that were appropriate for the scene. Too often low budget films use one song over and over again. Thanks Len. The acting fell into the negative column. The dialouge was hit and miss. They threw stuff at you fast and I didn't know if it was intentional or not. For instance, several of the words spoken by the werewolves were one word dog commands such as ""sit"" or ""stay."" Was this meant to be funny or did it just work that way? The name ""Stick"" fit into a few places, like when they said ""WTF Stick."" Is Kabasinski a ""B"" movie cult genius waiting in the wings as the next Peter Jackson, or is he just another Ed Wood impersonator?

8204512,2,B000S6LPAA,"Curse of the Wolf is another film about a female werewolf that had much promise but it's  terribly executed in production.  Several great ideas (i.e. female werewolf struggling with her curse and her relationship with a fellow coworker) were never delved into.  I felt is could have been a solid film but it never really goes anywhere.  It tries too hard to be ""cool"" but it fails in the end.",1233100800,,392,4.557142857142857
8204513,1,B000S6LPAA,"Curse of the Wolf is a film that had a very small amount of potential, but lost every way possible.  The only reason why I saw this film, is because of Darian Caine, and she didn't have a big part.  The cover is supposed to be Darian Caine, but she doesn't even look like that.  Also this film had a lot of poor camera shooting.",1215820800,,328,4.015384615384615
8204514,5,B000S6LPAA,"This is the 2nd movie from Killer Wolf films and it does not disapoint. It grabs you with it's unique blend of horror and action and never lets you go. This film fits those who love horror and the martial arts because both are on display. Len the director is an avid martial artists who gets equally gifted fighters to be in his movies. There is also great comedic relief here provided by wrester Brian ""Blue Meanie"" Heffron so don't think it's all dark. Try it out and if you like it then there is also their first movie ""Swamp Zombies"" out there wiating to be consumed.",1200355200,5,571,4.345794392523365
