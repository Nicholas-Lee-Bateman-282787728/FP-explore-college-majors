3113142,5,B0013JRDZM,"This video by Leslie is absolutely excellent for those beginning an exercise regimen! The One-Mile walk alone is a perfect set to do when you find you just don't have time each day to commit an hour or two at a gym. It takes all of two minutes! And guess what? If you don't have those fancy hand weights that Leslie uses - you can substitute canned soup to start with, and build up to using peanut butter jars (creative!).

You will break a sweat during the one-mile - not pouring down the back/socks dripping wet type - but a good forehead sweat! Perfect!
As you get accustomed to the one-mile then finish the whole video each set. Take your time, gradually adding segments!

I love how she shows you how to do the less-impact exercises while walking. For instance, if you can't stretch your arms all the way out like you are flying, no worries, she will (along with her 'helper') show you how to do smaller, yet just as impacting exercises!
DEFINITELY recommend this to most everyone!",1295827200,8,986,4.5027932960893855

The Get up and started and the 2 mile walks are AWESOME! I really like the large
group work outs. I really like the group interactions. It feels like you are part of the group.",1268179200,,396,7.270833333333333
3113144,4,B0013JRDZM,"First time purchasing a Leslie Sansone 'collection' and was pleased to discover none were duplicates to the handful of old VHS tapes I have. (I've since purchased 'For Your Week' and 'Ultimate Collection' and, as a result, am now getting dupes.) Given how many workouts Leslie has done not sure why they couldn't offer a unique set of routines on each of the compilation DVDs.

'5-Day' is a decent mix of 1- and 2-mile workouts (varying production quality...some better than others). My fave is 'Walk & Kick.' Fun, challenging and affords a nice change from the four basic moves. 'Get Up and Get Started' (also on 'Ultimate Collection') and 'With High Calorie Burn' give me the 1- and 2-mile complements to the 3-mile I already owned from this series. Both are very good and I enjoy the cast (go, Randy!). '30-Minute Walk' (also on 'For Your Week') is decent workout but one member of the group never smiles and looks less than thrilled to be participating. (I prefer happy, peppy participants.) The 'Power Mile' is great for quick calorie burn. Whereas I didn't have much interest in Leslie's early 1-mile routines, I've come to enjoy and appreciate her more recent ones. At present, I do 3 miles every day...usually with a mix of 1 and 2 miles... so this DVD offers good options along with my other collections.

BTW, the music of these older workouts....upon which I rely to keep me moving and in sync with the workout...is weak at times. The sound quality from one workout to another lacks consistency, as well.",1264896000,4,1515,4.756653992395437
3113145,5,B0013JRDZM,"Alright, I admit it...I used to sneer at Leslie Sansone.  I never gave her workouts a chance because I figured they would be too way easy for me.  My main source of cardio was step aerobics, a little kickboxing and a little low impact aerobics.  For me it was always hard to find low impact aerobic workouts that I truly enjoyed.  Then in late 2007 after years of consistent exercise, I was plain burnt out and fell off the wagon.

Fast forward to 2009 where I am trying to get back into exercising after a year and a half layoff.  Who do I reach for?  LESLIE!  I found this DVD at Target in 2008 and thought, why not?  Turns out she is exactly the kind of low impact aerobics that I have always looked for. For some silly reason I always thought you just marched in place for 20-30 minutes, which wouldn't have been my cup of tea, I couldn't have been more wrong.  Yes... you walk in place, but you also do other moves, side steps, knee lifts, kicks (the 4 main moves in her walking programs, and sometimes you will see other moves like hamstring curls (she calls them kickbacks), double side steps, etc. This is perfect for choreographically challenged me.

This DVD contains 5 of her previously released workouts, 1 Mile Get Up & Get Started, 2 Mile High Calorie Burn, 30 Minute Walk, Walk & Kick, and Power Mile.  While I like all the workouts, I find that I use the 2 Mile and 30 Minute Walks the most.  I like the 1 Mile and Power Mile for adding on before or after strength training, and Walk & Kick is a great little kickboxing workout for me.  Many kickboxing workouts that I have tried have high impact moves, which I don't care for and tend to stay away from, this one is perfect.  Maybe a little easy, but who cares.

What can I say, I am a Leslie convert.  I honestly wish I would have tried her years ago, I see why she has so many fans.  I still struggle with getting back to exercising as consistently as I did a few years ago, but this DVD helps immensely.  For those days that I don't feel like doing anything (and there are many), I pick one of these workouts and am glad that I did afterwards.  5 stars all the way.",1256342400,138,2135,4.224691358024692
3113146,5,B0013JRDZM,"I've been trying to get into an exercise routine for a decade and I've never been able to until I found this DVD. It's my first Leslie Sansone DVD, but I'm sure there will be many more added to my collection soon. The workouts are challenging but I'm still able to do them all the way through without modifications. I started very unfit, but now only a few weeks into it, I can feel a definite difference in my body. I was tired of workouts being ridiculous prancing around and Leslie's workouts are practical, effective, and to the point. Her encouragement is genuine and there's a general light-hearted feel of just getting together with friends. I've only added exercise to my life without changing eating habits yet and the pounds are dropping off. This DVD has been life changing for me and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a real way to lose weight.",1244592000,3,866,4.5576923076923075

3113148,4,B0013JRDZM,"This is mostly her first two WATP videos (1 mile, 2 mile, & 3 mile)compiled into one. But, she did add a new segment, with kickboxing moves. I really did like the kickboxing moves; they are not as jarring as TaeBo.  But what I don't understand is why sellers are selling this so EXPENSIVE!! Seventy two dollars? This same DVD is brand new at [...], for much less, if you don't want to pay almost a hundred for just one workout vid.",1228089600,3,431,4.2560975609756095

I am thrilled that the first two workouts are the 1 and 2 mile from the original WATP. That set is my alltime favorite and I only have them on VHS (which I don't use anymore). The 3rd and the 5th workouts I am not sure which ones they are but the set and clothes look late 80's early 90's, I am less than thrilled with these. And the Walk and Jog I already own. I gave my review 4 stars because I LOVE the first two workouts but overall I am not pleased with this dvd. There is MUCH better Leslie out there!",1226448000,38,614,4.0

I am trying to get fit and can actually keep up with this workout.  I like it because it has 5 workouts on one DVD which are divided up into 5 days, but sometimes I do two days workouts on one day.  Each workout is approximately 20 to 30 minutes.  It is a great way to get in shape by walking and being able to do it in your home.

This is a really great in home work out that works!  I live in the Midwest where it is cold and it snows a lot - this really helps me get off the couch to get my exercise!  What I like about them is you don't just walk, you use all kinds of muscle groups and light weights for some of the walks - I even sweat during some of the workouts...sweating is so good for you!

It has two different 2-mile walks for 30 minutes, so it's good for days when my time is limited or as a supplemental workout in addition to a longer walk outdoors or with lifting weights. I also enjoy the variety offered in this DVD, especially the short workout with light weights for arm conditioning.

I still use the same program today (although I have since purchased the DVD's, and discarded my VHS's). I have this DVD because it includes the 1 and 2 mile walk, as well as the 30 minute walk (a variation of a 2 mi walk), the walk & kick (Leslie's version of kick boxing), and the 1 mile fast walk. In addition to this DVD, I bought the Walk Away the Pounds Super Fat Burning 3 Miles (from 2001). Since 2001, Leslie has bombarded the market with other programs and variations - but I stick to the tried and true original program. Each one of the workouts on this DVD are about 30 minutes long, and I do one each day, 6 days per week. They keep me feeling energized and strong. You don't need to be a gym rat or a true fitness buff to be able to stick to these workouts.

3113257,5,B0013JRDZM,"This program was recommended to me by a friend in the Weight Watchers community.  I was skeptical of how one ""walks at home"".  It's a cross somewhere between marching and walking in place.  In any event, there is a one mile beginner walk and then you can go up to more miles.  Incorporated into each walking session are other simple side steps, kicks, knee lifts, hand movements.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.

She found the first session was just right; not too grueling exercise, with helpful explanations from Leslie and pacing she can keep up with. There are different options/sessions and so far she has only done the first session and has enjoyed it quite a lot. It's perfect for someone who has to start an exercise regimen after being away from exercising for a long time. I recommend it for both young and older people since both my friend (who is in 20's) and my mom (who is in her 60's) have found it to be helpful and a good starting point.

Because you are basically doing the same moves for every workout I think the music should be good and loud enough to hear as well as the people should be on beat.

I'm a fan of Leslie's 1 mile/2 mile DVD so I thought this was perfect for her because it's low impact cardio but challenging enough to work up a sweat.
She is happy with the DVD itself, but not so happy that the package arrived with a big tear and was left in a puddle of water outside for her to collect.
From my own personal experience, if you're out of shape and looking to add cardio to your workout regime, this is a great start. The moves are uncomplicated, and you can do as much or as little as your body can manage. And with different work outs, you can mix and match based on your exercise goals.
I love that it's basically 5 workouts for the price of one, and with this price who can complain?

3113269,3,B0013JRDZM,"If you want to do one workout a day this DVD is great. Each of the 5 workouts have a warm up and cool down. However if you are like me and like to do the entire DVD at once each workouts warm up and cool down really ruins the momentum.

Each workout on it's own is good and the fact that they are all different adds variety. My favorite workout of all Leslie's workouts is on the DVD. It's called walk and kick in which Leslie incorporated some kickboxing into the workout. I use this DVD just so I can get to do that workout.

For some reason this DVD does not forward or rewind simply using the cursor like her other DVD's I'm not sure if this means it's defective or it's simply how this DVD was formatted. You can forward by holding down the forward button but that's very slow if you want to forward through the warm ups and cool down and interferes with maintaining the heart rate. Therefore I only recommend this DVD if you plan to do each workout separately.

Unlike some of her other DVD's you can not watch all 5 workouts at once and there are credits and talking between the crew at the end of each workout. So there is a lot of wasted time.

I personally would still purchase this DVD simply for the walk and kick workout included in this DVD. Some of the workouts also use weighted balls. Any kinds of weights would work or she has some models not using the weights at all.",1324512000,,1386,4.179775280898877

3113272,1,B0013JRDZM,"This video is awful.  You cannot hear the music to do the workout to most of the time. You can hear Leslie which I do not mind but in order to hear any music I have to turn the volume up so loud that leslie is too loud.  Each segment starts with Leslie talking without any exercise so each workout portion is delayed.  At least two of the workouts include one person in the walk group who has some sort of facial tic or was making faces as she heard what Leslie had to say.  While I should be generous and ignore it, I could not ignore it because it stood out so prominently.  The other problem was everyone talked and put in their two cents.  I don't want that.  I want a workout, not a therapy session.  Leslie gets one star for the one good workout I did really enjoy... the walk and kick video.  Its only problem is I don't know exactly how many miles it is.  I am guessing two.  It would be great if she could make another walk and kick video with louder music and no intro/narrative prior to the workout.  I thought I was getting a good deal with so many workouts so economically priced.  Now I know why.
And I usually love Leslie. I have many of her videos.  I am guessing she just did not know much about video production when this came out.  But, she knew after she saw it and she should re-do it into a better video and take this one off the market so no one buys it.  I think that is the main issue.  If she did re-do it then she left this lemon out and that was not right.  Thanks.",1311811200,8,1493,4.020408163265306

The One-Mile walk alone is a perfect set to do when you find you just don't have time each day to commit an hour or two at a gym. It takes all of two minutes! And guess what? If you don't have those fancy hand weights that Leslie uses - you can substitute canned soup to start with, and build up to using peanut butter jars (creative!).

You will break a sweat during the one-mile - not pouring down the back/socks dripping wet type - but a good forehead sweat! Perfect!
As you get accustomed to the one-mile then finish the whole video each set. Take your time, gradually adding segments!

I love how she shows you how to do the less-impact exercises while walking. For instance, if you can't stretch your arms all the way out like you are flying, no worries, she will (along with her 'helper') show you how to do smaller, yet just as impacting exercises!

3347641,4,B0013JRDZM,"First time purchasing a Leslie Sansone 'collection' and was pleased to discover none were duplicates to the handful of old VHS tapes I have. (I've since purchased 'For Your Week' and 'Ultimate Collection' and, as a result, am now getting dupes.) Given how many workouts Leslie has done not sure why they couldn't offer a unique set of routines on each of the compilation DVDs.

'5-Day' is a decent mix of 1- and 2-mile workouts (varying production quality...some better than others). My fave is 'Walk & Kick.' Fun, challenging and affords a nice change from the four basic moves. 'Get Up and Get Started' (also on 'Ultimate Collection') and 'With High Calorie Burn' give me the 1- and 2-mile complements to the 3-mile I already owned from this series. Both are very good and I enjoy the cast (go, Randy!). '30-Minute Walk' (also on 'For Your Week') is decent workout but one member of the group never smiles and looks less than thrilled to be participating. (I prefer happy, peppy participants.) The 'Power Mile' is great for quick calorie burn. Whereas I didn't have much interest in Leslie's early 1-mile routines, I've come to enjoy and appreciate her more recent ones. At present, I do 3 miles every day...usually with a mix of 1 and 2 miles... so this DVD offers good options along with my other collections.

BTW, the music of these older workouts....upon which I rely to keep me moving and in sync with the workout...is weak at times. The sound quality from one workout to another lacks consistency, as well.",1264896000,4,1515,4.756653992395437

Then in late 2007 after years of consistent exercise, I was plain burnt out and fell off the wagon.

Fast forward to 2009 where I am trying to get back into exercising after a year and a half layoff.  Who do I reach for?  LESLIE!  I found this DVD at Target in 2008 and thought, why not?  Turns out she is exactly the kind of low impact aerobics that I have always looked for. For some silly reason I always thought you just marched in place for 20-30 minutes, which wouldn't have been my cup of tea, I couldn't have been more wrong.  Yes... you walk in place, but you also do other moves, side steps, knee lifts, kicks (the 4 main moves in her walking programs, and sometimes you will see other moves like hamstring curls (she calls them kickbacks), double side steps, etc. This is perfect for choreographically challenged me.

This DVD contains 5 of her previously released workouts, 1 Mile Get Up & Get Started, 2 Mile High Calorie Burn, 30 Minute Walk, Walk & Kick, and Power Mile.  While I like all the workouts, I find that I use the 2 Mile and 30 Minute Walks the most.  I like the 1 Mile and Power Mile for adding on before or after strength training, and Walk & Kick is a great little kickboxing workout for me.  Many kickboxing workouts that I have tried have high impact moves, which I don't care for and tend to stay away from, this one is perfect.  Maybe a little easy, but who cares.

What can I say, I am a Leslie convert.  I honestly wish I would have tried her years ago, I see why she has so many fans.  I still struggle with getting back to exercising as consistently as I did a few years ago, but this DVD helps immensely.  For those days that I don't feel like doing anything (and there are many), I pick one of these workouts and am glad that I did afterwards.  5 stars all the way.",1256342400,138,2135,4.224691358024692
3347643,5,B0013JRDZM,"I've been trying to get into an exercise routine for a decade and I've never been able to until I found this DVD. It's my first Leslie Sansone DVD, but I'm sure there will be many more added to my collection soon. The workouts are challenging but I'm still able to do them all the way through without modifications. I started very unfit, but now only a few weeks into it, I can feel a definite difference in my body. I was tired of workouts being ridiculous prancing around and Leslie's workouts are practical, effective, and to the point. Her encouragement is genuine and there's a general light-hearted feel of just getting together with friends. I've only added exercise to my life without changing eating habits yet and the pounds are dropping off. This DVD has been life changing for me and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a real way to lose weight.",1244592000,3,866,4.5576923076923075

Since 2001, Leslie has bombarded the market with other programs and variations - but I stick to the tried and true original program.

3347751,4,B0013JRDZM,Leslie Sansone has made a great DVD with this 5-day fit-walk. She has a great way of making you feel that she's a good friend whose just called around to your home to work out with you!  It varies well from day to day so one never gets bored with the same routine.  Found the music harder to hear in the background and not as good as in the 3-mile Walk your Belly Flat DVD.  Loved the kick-boxing part.,1344902400,4,402,4.063291139240507
3347752,5,B0013JRDZM,"These workouts are perfect for me.  I have fibromylgia and intense exercise can be painful the next day or even up to 3 days later.  NOT so with these workouts.  You can do 1 or 2 mile and work your way up.  Some walks have weights some don't. Some are laid back and some are more intense.  I LOVE the variety in this set.  After a couple months of this DVD I'm now onto the longer more advance work out ""Ultimate 5 day walk plan"" that has 3, 4 and 5 mile walks on it. Seen here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Ultimate-5-Day-Walk-Plan/dp/B006NKFAA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan</a>

If you think it's too easy just pick your feet up higher or add weights, if it's too much walk closer to the ground.  So easy to adjust!  (I have 4 of Leslie Sansone's DVD's and this is the best value for money for beginning your exercise routine.  Next level, get the DVD ""Ulitmate 5 day walk plan"" I mentioned above.

Only wish she did more stretching.  I find I need to spend 5 minutes after the DVD is over to do more stretching.",1339632000,4,1115,4.810526315789474

3347754,5,B0013JRDZM,"This program was recommended to me by a friend in the Weight Watchers community.  I was skeptical of how one ""walks at home"".  It's a cross somewhere between marching and walking in place.  In any event, there is a one mile beginner walk and then you can go up to more miles.  Incorporated into each walking session are other simple side steps, kicks, knee lifts, hand movements.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.  If you are just starting out you can do the one mile and that is still a good workout.  Highly recommended.",1336435200,2,524,4.51063829787234
3347755,5,B0013JRDZM,"I bought this dvd for my mom so that she could start exercising at home. It was recommended to me by a close friend who said that it helped her get back into shape. My mom is only starting an exercise regimen and needed something she could easily follow that was not too strenous. She found the first session was just right; not too grueling exercise, with helpful explanations from Leslie and pacing she can keep up with. There are different options/sessions and so far she has only done the first session and has enjoyed it quite a lot. It's perfect for someone who has to start an exercise regimen after being away from exercising for a long time. I recommend it for both young and older people since both my friend (who is in 20's) and my mom (who is in her 60's) have found it to be helpful and a good starting point. The price is great (less than $9 including shipping).",1333843200,12,876,4.347560975609756
3347756,2,B0013JRDZM,"I love Leslie Sansone's walk exercise programs and I have about 4 DVD's. This is the worst. The music is too low to the point you can barely hear it. Everyone seems like they are off beat. I can't even watch them while they move because it throws off my workout. Because you are basically doing the same moves for every workout I think the music should be good and loud enough to hear as well as the people should be on beat.

3347759,4,B0013JRDZM,"Instead of buying my friend chocolate or candy, I decided to get her this DVD for Valentine's Day since she's trying to get back in shape. I'm a fan of Leslie's 1 mile/2 mile DVD so I thought this was perfect for her because it's low impact cardio but challenging enough to work up a sweat.
She is happy with the DVD itself, but not so happy that the package arrived with a big tear and was left in a puddle of water outside for her to collect.
From my own personal experience, if you're out of shape and looking to add cardio to your workout regime, this is a great start. The moves are uncomplicated, and you can do as much or as little as your body can manage. And with different work outs, you can mix and match based on your exercise goals.
I love that it's basically 5 workouts for the price of one, and with this price who can complain?
Leslie needs to put out some more new content, I'm definitely a fan.",1331164800,5,912,4.15819209039548

3347766,3,B0013JRDZM,"If you want to do one workout a day this DVD is great. Each of the 5 workouts have a warm up and cool down. However if you are like me and like to do the entire DVD at once each workouts warm up and cool down really ruins the momentum.

Each workout on it's own is good and the fact that they are all different adds variety. My favorite workout of all Leslie's workouts is on the DVD. It's called walk and kick in which Leslie incorporated some kickboxing into the workout. I use this DVD just so I can get to do that workout.

For some reason this DVD does not forward or rewind simply using the cursor like her other DVD's I'm not sure if this means it's defective or it's simply how this DVD was formatted. You can forward by holding down the forward button but that's very slow if you want to forward through the warm ups and cool down and interferes with maintaining the heart rate. Therefore I only recommend this DVD if you plan to do each workout separately.

Unlike some of her other DVD's you can not watch all 5 workouts at once and there are credits and talking between the crew at the end of each workout. So there is a lot of wasted time.

I personally would still purchase this DVD simply for the walk and kick workout included in this DVD. Some of the workouts also use weighted balls. Any kinds of weights would work or she has some models not using the weights at all.",1324512000,,1386,4.179775280898877

3347769,1,B0013JRDZM,"This video is awful.  You cannot hear the music to do the workout to most of the time. You can hear Leslie which I do not mind but in order to hear any music I have to turn the volume up so loud that leslie is too loud.  Each segment starts with Leslie talking without any exercise so each workout portion is delayed.  At least two of the workouts include one person in the walk group who has some sort of facial tic or was making faces as she heard what Leslie had to say.  While I should be generous and ignore it, I could not ignore it because it stood out so prominently.  The other problem was everyone talked and put in their two cents.  I don't want that.  I want a workout, not a therapy session.  Leslie gets one star for the one good workout I did really enjoy... the walk and kick video.  Its only problem is I don't know exactly how many miles it is.  I am guessing two.  It would be great if she could make another walk and kick video with louder music and no intro/narrative prior to the workout.  I thought I was getting a good deal with so many workouts so economically priced.  Now I know why.
And I usually love Leslie. I have many of her videos.  I am guessing she just did not know much about video production when this came out.  But, she knew after she saw it and she should re-do it into a better video and take this one off the market so no one buys it.  I think that is the main issue.  If she did re-do it then she left this lemon out and that was not right.  Thanks.",1311811200,8,1493,4.020408163265306
