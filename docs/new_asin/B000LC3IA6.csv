2701710,3,B000LC3IA6,"Led by an excellent performance by Nastassja Kinski and a usual performance by Keifer Sutherland, Paradise Found is the story of Paul Gauguin, a stockbroker that became what we now know as a celebrated impressionist artist.

The movie moves between episodes of his well-to-do family life as a stockbroker, as a starving artist seperated from his wife and childern and as a crazed White artist on a South Seas island with his native girl lover.  It's these South Seas scenes that are the most annoying, but where Gauguin paints what is now some of his most celebrated work.

The best scenes in the movie, however, are with Miss Kinski.  She shines as Mrs. Gaugin through various emotions, settings of rich and poor, as a travailed, but loving wife and mother.  Get the movie for her performance.  This is definately one of her best, even if her screen time is not as much as it was in, say, Cat People.",1178496000,5,901,4.635220125786163
2701711,5,B000LC3IA6,This is a very good movie if you like Kiefer Sutherland and art. This is based o a true person. I found it very informative.,1174435200,,124,4.0
2701712,5,B000LC3IA6,Nice to see Kiefer in other parts than Jack Bauer. It shows once again what a great actor he is. I think people would enjoy this movie. Paradise is out there.,1174262400,,158,4.129032258064516
2701713,5,B000LC3IA6,I loved this movie.  It was well done. Kiefer Sutherland's acting is as always outstanding.  It's a beautifully done movie.  The location scenes are breath taking.,1169251200,7,163,5.1923076923076925
2701744,4,B000LC3IA6,"The movie is good, Kiefer plays well as Gaugain, there are many facts from the book, so i recommend it.",1382054400,2,103,4.2
2701745,5,B000LC3IA6,Good insight into well known artist Paul Gauguin. Lovely scenes of Tahiti and the South Seas. Australian actors in film.,1363824000,,120,5.05
2701746,1,B000LC3IA6,"I've been teaching film for a decade, and it's rare to find a film that I find completely lamentable, but the wrongfully named Paradise Found is one of those films that suffers on every level.  I won't go in to a lot of details, but the gross historical inaccuracies perpetrated on the filmgoer is enough to make one apoplectic with rage.  Gauguin's real life was interesting enough without trying to completely recast him in what amounts to a romantic picture.  I would really prefer to give this film zero stars, but alas, that is not an option.  I really wonder what was going through the heads of the producers and writer, and even director, of this picture.  It is complete and utter dreck.  The other pictures that exist about Gauguin are far more interesting and far more historically accurate.",1363219200,7,801,4.726618705035971
2701747,1,B000LC3IA6,"I found this movie while researching the life of Paul Gauguin - evidently something not a single person involved in the production thought to do. The acting is phoned in, the score is cheap, and the historical accuracies are rooted in what could very well be no more than a Wikipedia entry. I've seen softcore pornography directed with more gravitas. I'll stop my review of the film here as it doesn't even merit the thought I've given thus far.

If you're searching for a title with more substance and information, look a generation back to Donald Sutherland's performance as Paul in WOLF AT THE DOOR. Not an easy movie to find but worth it.",1294963200,3,642,4.631578947368421
2701748,2,B000LC3IA6,"As an artist, I'm often frustrated by the way artists are romanticized in movies.  Few films actually manage to get it right.  This isn't one of them.

That's not to say it is lacking in charm.  The movie is full of beautiful scenery.  In fact, if the whole story were edited out, it would be a better film.  There are lush tropical forests, waterfalls, beaches...and part of the film takes place in France, rendered with equal style.

The plot features the early life of Gauguin up to the point where he decides to sail for Tahiti, interspersed with scenes that happen after he gets there in a complex, rather annoying format that disrupts continuity possibly to make a point about the differences between Tahiti and France.

The scenery is beautiful, the costumes are beautiful.  The film is a treat for the eyes.

The supporting cast are all fine.  The problem is Kiefer Sutherland and Nastassja Kinski, who play Gauguin and his wife.  Neither of them are particularly good actors, but in this film they seem to be competing in some kind of duel to see who can be the worst actor of all.  It's strange to watch a movie in which the supporting actors consistently outshine the two leads by so much.  But that gives you an idea of just how bad Sutherland and Kinski are.

Sutherland's performance is alternately flippant, maudlin, hilariously overwrought, and curiously flat.  It is clear that he doesn't understand the character he is playing.  He also sports the worst mullet ever seen on a human being.  It's painful to behold!

Nastassja Kinski sulks, nags, and occasionally bursts into histrionic temper tantrums.  I found myself longing to reach through the screen and slap her.

The facts of Gauguin's life are ignored if they don't fit the filmmaker's romantic pretentions.  He's made to seem a romantic figure who found success following his dream; the film doesn't bother to point out that Gauguin's greatest works were painted by a half-blind, diseased wretch lying in a hammock because he was too sick to stand.  Or that he was about to die of syphilis.  It perpetrates a false view of artists - that REAL artists have no material concerns, leave their wives and children to starve, and don't care about anything but painting the perfect picture.  No wonder nobody likes us!

This is the kind of movie you wouldn't mind watching on an airplane.  But it's not worth much more than that.  Unless bad movies are your guilty pleasure.

If you want a good movie about Gauguin, try to find a copy of ""Wolf at the Door"" featuring Kiefer's father, Donald Sutherland.  Donald has an amazing talent that his son has not managed to inherit.  It's not on DVD for some reason, but you can find copies of it on VHS.",1215475200,6,2714,4.698513800424628
2701749,5,B000LC3IA6,What can I say?  Keifer did a great job portraying Paul Gaugain.  If you are an artist you'll love it.  If not you'll probably walk away not getting it.  Great movie to learn more about the artist!,1214697600,6,197,4.243243243243243
2701750,5,B000LC3IA6,"This is a marvelous film focusing on artistic passion, and the sacrifices made in fulfillment of that need. Kiefer Sutherland nicely portrays impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, who painfully sacrifices family, home and wealth to seek out a career as an artist.",1205798400,,261,5.390243902439025
2701751,4,B000LC3IA6,"I am a big fan of Kiefer and I always wonder why he's in (usually) crappy movies.  This is a nice change of pace for him since his character doesn't carry a gun or work for the government.  Everything is well done in this move, the settings are great and the acting is done well.  It would have been nice to have some extras on this DVD, but I guess somebody was too cheap for that.  Oh well.  Still a good movie.",1186617600,8,413,3.9878048780487805
2701752,4,B000LC3IA6,"This movie is for the artist in all of us. We all have in one time or another that little voice inside that wants us to be something that it might not be the best career choice, but that it would make us feel complete.

Kiefer Sutherland as Paul Gauguin is fantastic and you feel for his struggle during the whole film. It makes you wonder and think how many of us have an incredible talent in something but we do not follow or instincts because we are trapped in our careers and in our jobs...

This movie makes you reach inside and think what you rather be doing in your life, that would be worth leaving everything for...what is your dream, what makes you happy and complete...

Loved the movie...Kiefer Sutherland gives us a great performance once again",1183420800,,757,4.431654676258993
2701753,3,B000LC3IA6,"Sure there are some slow areas, but kiefer's crying scene was the most real crying sene I have seen to this day by a man. I think it was Oscar worthy. Not ""acting"" crying, but I felt he was doing a natural crying that would take place at that kind of moment.

If your an artist, you will like this movie because of the artist's struggle.",1182902400,,337,4.106060606060606

8160788,2,B000LC3IA6,I love art movies and think highly of both leads but this movie is simply awful: there is no chemistry between them and they don't show a believable relationship even at the beginning. Having failed to be believable at the beginning of their romance it is hard for the viewer to engage with anything that follows. Sutherland's acting is flat and gives the impression of being checked. I had hoped for a passionate movie about an interesting and driven man who but this was simply miscast.,1490227200,,488,4.686046511627907

8160791,5,B000LC3IA6,"This film examplifies the creative impulse that artist feel throughout their life.  No matter how much you want to bury it with other endeavors, it will rear its head and have its way with you.  I wasn't a Gaugaine fan but this film will make me look at his work with new eyes.  For all the artist, and art lovers, this is film is a must.  For those that do not u derstand the artist mentality, perhaps this film will give you insight into the artist mentality and drive to create.  Be kind to them.",1439164800,,499,4.2105263157894735

8160793,3,B000LC3IA6,Worth a watch for a Saturday night.  This film is not historically accurate and is pure Hollywood.  But it's an artist movie so that was an interesting part.,1413676800,,157,4.571428571428571
8160794,3,B000LC3IA6,"A good film if you are interested in understanding how frontiers are pushed in the field of painting (and enrichment of society). Consider to watch Kiefer Sutherland father's (Donald) interpretation of Gauguin's life preceding the period covered in ""Paradise Found"".
