8181143,1,B000BNX4KE,"I tried to buy this product from FOUR different TPSs, and NOT ONE was able to send it to me.  Two could only offer refunds and the other TWO sent me the WRONG THING.  I brought the problem to Amazon's attention, and your Customer Service reps, Cha, Sachin, Giovanni, Ryan, and possibly others have generally been very courteous, sympathic and understanding of the problems involved, but they could do little if anything to SOLVE the problem, which in this case was to send THE RIGHT THINGS.  Clearly, Amazon has problems insofar that your Fulfillment Centers need attention.  Your system needs to be more than just ""tweeked"".  I have suggested a simple solution of having someone in you shipping department simply compare the invoice with what is being sent WITH the invoice to make sure THEY MATCH!
Three times you sent me the correct invoice and three times you sent THE WRONG ITEMS!  Obviously, Amazon has become so big a company that simple problems are NOT being addressed or corrected, much less prevented in the first place.
I hope that this matter will be corrected, and that the DVDs that you have promised and promised and.... will soon be sent to me.  You have issued me numerous courtesy refunds and discounts and the like as a way of trying to make me happier.  That's all well and good, but, believe it or not, I STILL WANT THESE DVDs.
Thank you for reading all this.  If I can be of service TO YOU, please don't hesitate to call or email me.  Actually, calling would be more preferable to me.",1186790400,,1507,4.610486891385768
