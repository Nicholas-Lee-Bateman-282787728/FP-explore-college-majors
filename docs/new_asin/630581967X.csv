Great movie though, albeit made a bit early in the Moffatts attempt to break the US, and thus doesn't have a lot of interesting content. It's more of a background and 'who are they anyway?'. None the less a good collectors item that's getting harder to find.
My favourite part is where the triplets, Clint, Bob and Dave, are told that they're the most famous triplets in the entire world. They didn't know this fact, and their puzzled, awed reaction is worth getting the video alone.",1030579200,,604,4.5
