8185167,5,B000OIOP0Y,"Kelly is the man.  I was new to this and he made it very easy to understand and I didn't feel like he was trying to talk over your head or make this into something overly complicated like some fly fishers do.  If you are new to this, it's a fantastic video for getting the basics.  Just listen and follow his directions and you really will catch more fish.",1429833600,,356,4.130434782608695
8185168,5,B000OIOP0Y,Kelly is entertaining and does a great job of explaining the nymphing rigs.,1416873600,,75,4.846153846153846
8185169,5,B000OIOP0Y,"This is probably the best fishing videos around.  Kelly Galloup is a great fisherman and he takes you through an effective method of catching trout.  If one is familiar with the Madison River below Quake Lake you will say to yourself ""I've been there""  Follow Kelly as he explains what, how and why and catches fish.  I for one can hardly wait until I return to the Slide Inn and apply what Kelly teaches and then share a cold beer while he critiques my mistakes.",1351555200,,463,4.411764705882353
8185170,5,B000OIOP0Y,"Based on the quality I had seen in his previous videos, I figured there was no way to go wrong getting this one.  I was right.  Kelly produced another very informative video that will be viewed again and again.

 When I started fly fishing, I learned nymphing first.  I didn't throw a dry fly for the first three years I was fly fishing.  It's just the way my mentor taught me...and for that I'm grateful, because I seem to have one up on most fly anglers I fish with.  They don't fish with nymphs... and the real reason, which they won't tell you...is that they don't know how.  Well this video lays it out pretty well.  The rest is up to the person wanting to learn and going out and just doing it.",1296259200,,700,4.203007518796992
8185171,5,B000OIOP0Y,This video probably has something new for even the most accomplished anglers.  I have been fly fishing for over 40 years and picked up some new ideas.  The new approaches have been field tested and they work.,1272412800,3,208,4.594594594594595
8185172,4,B000OIOP0Y,"I have Kelly Galloup's streamer fishing DVD and based upon that video, I also purchased this one on nymphing.  Great video instruction, good quality quality, he covers techniques ""in the classroom"" and then out on the river.  Definitely recommended for anyone wanting to learn from an expert.",1255219200,6,292,5.191489361702128
8185173,4,B000OIOP0Y,This a well put together video for anyone interested in begining nymphing for the first time. It is very informative and clearly shows numerous rigging techniques to get you down to the fish. Overall a good instructional DVD well worth buying if you are new to nymphing.,1242604800,2,270,4.76595744680851
8185174,5,B000OIOP0Y,"If you've ever thought about giving nymphing a try or if you need to give your nymphing confidence a big boost than this is the DVD for you. I am a hard to satisfy, critical person and I can not say enough good things about this DVD. I highly recommend this DVD.",1226793600,5,262,4.0576923076923075
8185175,5,B000OIOP0Y,In this DVD Kelly Galloup unloads a massive amount of tips and information!  Even when Kelly is fighting a fish he is telling tips on what he is doing right and wrong.  This DVD is very informative on nymphing and leaves the viewer with confidence after watching the DVD.  Only downside is sometimes the camera doesn't follow certain things that Kelly is trying to emphasize.  I am thoroughly pleased at the level of instruction included in this DVD and hope that Mr. Galloup continues to produce instructionals!,1177977600,7,512,4.850574712643678
