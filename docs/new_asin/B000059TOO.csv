Perhaps we can say it's ""charmingly poorly edited"" or ""charmingly void of grounding"", but even this is a stretch.  The blaring and ""low-fi"" techno music, for instance, might be ""charming"" to me, were it not counterintuitive to the length of the single-shot interview scenes. The interviews themselves are only loosely structured to give an idea of the last years of PKD's life, but even that structure is muddled by overwrought anecdotes and non-sequitors. The human warmth that came across in some of these interviews are really the only valuable thing about this movie, but it seems like the filmmakers were trying their hardest to undermine that quality to turn this into some sort underground geek-punk documentary. Picture a woman relaying to the camera how much she misses Phil, or relaying a touching anecdote about his irreverend and conforting sense of humor,all while irritating fast-paced garage-techno blares in your ear.

Who cares.  It is Phil.  And even if incomprehensible to anyone not familiar with Phil, there are enough of us out there who are that it is worthwhile for us.
You want a documentary that will introduce - really introduce Phil to the great unwashed?  It ain't gonna happen.  If one is not exposed to Phil's work at an innocent enough age then it will not become the life-changing, life-enhancing, life-affirming experience it could and should be.  This doesn't imply any lack of greatness.  Just that a certain greatness can't be apprehended after a level of cynicism has set in.  And even with an open mind, the writer certainly won't be understood without reading the books.
I find the low-tech, geek-oriented aesthetic rather charming and down to earth.  (Hmm.  THAT's a weird thing to have said about Phil.)  You'd rather see Jurassic Park-level visual quality in a documentary about Michael Crichton?  Don't think so.
And, of course, there were references to The Dark Haired Girl....",1023062400,5,1029,4.95906432748538

Just about a week before its release on video, I spotted an advertisement for ""The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick"" and pre-ordered it without having read anything about it.  And I was not disappointed.

Although the production values perhaps could have been better, considering the budget, they are not bad.  This documentary is an endeavor of love, not profit (much as the entire writing career of PKD was).  The interviews are poignant and heartfelt; personable, which is something that reading transcripts of interviews is not.  The care and admiration is evident in the faces and voices of those people remembering the author, from personal friends to fellow authors to notable guerilla ontologist, Robert Anton Wilson (whose comments about himself possible being a perfect android created by the CIA alone made this film worth watching).

There are features available which include a ""Dicktionary"" of reoccurring words and phrases in PKD's writings (what is ""kibble""?), and animated pieces showing Phil at his typewriter, as if speaking to us about key elements of his philosophy.  The audio tracks to these sequences are culled from interviews with him over the years.

For a newcomer to PKD, this film may be an invaluable resource into the mindset of the author following a deeply personal experience he had in 1974.  This experience dominated his last half dozen books and could be defined as a philosophical-religious epiphany or the result of a complete mental breakdown.  Phil himself never satisfactorily came to any firm conclusions about it.  And this documentary, instead of attempting to be a biography of his life, focuses on his thoughts and endless theories about this experience.  It provides a unique perspective on what lead up to this event and how much its profound influence on his later writings.

For a veteran reader of PKD, this documentary offers a glimpse behind the some of the realities of the master of creating unrealities.  Some of those people interviewed include Ray Nelson (author of the story on which ""They Live"" was based), Robert Anton Wilson, Paul Williams (journalist/writer and former literary executor of PKD), & Jay Kinney (former editor of Gnosis magazine).

In all, this low-budget documentary is much like the cheap paperbacks of the 1950s & 60s which Phil Dick wrote: the quality could be better, the production level could be flashier, the music could be more diversified, the animation could be smoother.  But the subject matter could also be something more shallow than the mind-twisting beliefs of Philip K. Dick.  What *is* this documentary?  It is like sitting down and reminiscing about an author with his dear friends.  It is a funny, tragic, deranged, and darkly delightful film about one of the greatest writers and philosophers in any universe.",1017532800,10,2817,5.135964912280702

Interviews make up the majority of the content and are mostly people telling their opinions of the man. The beginning of each segment of interview is marked by a stupid animation of a cartoon-PKD typing out little tidbits of trivia. I got the distinct impression that these little cartoons are only in the movie to add length, as each instance of the cartoon is exactly identical. I also though the music was cheesy and annoying. Overall, if the cartoons were taken out. A couple of the more pointless segments were taken out (who cares about the PKD section of the So. Cal. library?!) you would be left with a short, mildly interesting documentary. As it is currently a long, annoying and (in my opinion) intolerable documentary.",1001635200,4,825,4.769230769230769
1409419,2,B000059TOO,"A one star rating if not for the fact that anything about Dick must have some value.
The production values are abysmal: poor sound, boring & repetitive animation, the lighting is nearly non-existant and there is never a cutaway, nor more than one camera angle per interview subject. Structurally the film is a disorganized mess. The first half rambles hither and yon with no apparent structure while the second half fixates on Paul Williams reportage. (Williams discusses at length a break-in to Dick's house and Dick's various unusual theories as to who was responsible).  It was a fine approach for Williams to use as a means of focusing on Dick but it is just that, one author's tool, and not remotely the definitive event of his life. Get your own point of view guys.
I don't think that this film is a good starting point for new Dick fans as it does not present a good autobiographical overview and is so poorly made as to be off-putting. I do believe that long-time fans will be interested in what Ray Nelson and certain others who were actually there have to say (as opposed to the interviews with teenage webmasters whose idolization of Dick is fine but their third hand info feels, well... third hand).
I absolutely want to see good documentary work on SF literature, but this ain't too good. (If you want to see a truly excellent doc on Dick, the BBC's Arena series produced one some years back).",999475200,3,1406,4.646586345381526

Dick's writings, this collage of interviews is a good introduction to the bizarre and controversial events of the author's later life.

For those who have read the Lawrence Sutin biography (Divine Invasions) or any of the extensive biographical material that has been published since Dick's death, there isn't much that's new in this film.  However, Robert Anton Wilson (author of the Illuminati Trilogy), Ray Nelson (SF author, best known for the story on which ""They Live"" is based) and Paul Williams, former Rolling Stone writer and literary executor of Dick's estate, are especially fascinating to listen to, and the material is compelling even though it may be familiar.

1409422,2,B000059TOO,"Dick really deserves some first class documentaries exploring his remarkable life and personality- and this one just doesn't cut the mustard.

If you love Philip Dick, you already know these stories (which, the ones they get to, are very shallowly explored), and if you are unfamiliar with Dick, this, I can safely guess, will not make you very interested in looking deeper. The interviews are not very revealing, the audio clips out of context and thematically meaningless, his works are not explored, there was no access to persons, pictures, video footage that make documentaries worthwhile. There are animated clips that are annoying and last too long.

This film is not totally without redeeming qualities, just not enough to warrent a purchase; unless, of course, you would like to see extended footage of the librarian talking on and on about the Dick archives.

If you would like to get a deep look into Dick, I would recommend the intriguing book ""Only Apparently Real"" by Paul Williams. Once, Philip Dick had his house broken into and a filing cabinet/safe blown up. This book, which is a series of interviews, has Dick, in his own words, unspool theory after theory after theory about whom may have done it and why: the police, The CIA, drug dealers, Black Panthers, and even at one point, himself. It shows how his mind functioned, like a megacomputer on acid and amphetamines, staring straight into the void. Also recommended is ""Divine Invasions"" by Lawrence Sutin, a more traditional bio but very well written. Then there is ""I am alive and you are dead"" by Emmanuel Carrere which I have not read yet but is supposed to be very good.

We can respect the efforts and the intent of the filmakers, but the results just left me cold.",1133308800,9,1744,4.822742474916388
1409423,4,B000059TOO,"I have only read We Can Build You and a portion of Dr. Bloodmoney by Philip K. Dick--I definitely plan to finish Dr. Bloodmoney very soon-but that was enough to arouse my interest in this documentary about the enigmatic science fiction author. Genius or madman, or both, Philip K. Dick possessed a visionary perception of this life, which he referred to as the ""Black Barred Prison."" He steeped himself in the sorts of philosophical questions that usually mark the end of sanity: What is real? Who is real? What if I swapped minds with a friend--would I find that we view the world in the same way?

The fact that Philip K. Dick stories have been the basis for immensely popular Hollywood films--Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report--are the least interesting details discussed in the fascinating, very low budget documentary, The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick. The fact that Dick was married, much less four times during his life, is not even touched upon. For better or worse, the filmmaker, Mark Steensland, focuses on the truly bizarre aspects of Dick's life, and the bizarre aspects were legion.

The first episode of Dick's life examined is the time in 1971 when he returned to his house to find that someone had broken in and blown open his 1,100 pound safe with explosives. The vault contained all of Dick's personal papers, tax returns, as well as an unknown quantity of drugs. One friend suspected those drugs to be heroin. Although a frequent and fervent drug-user, Dick summoned the authorities, even calling the FBI to investigate the matter. It remains vague just how deeply the authorities investigated this break-in and theft, but they did take the time to inform Dick that they felt he was, in fact, responsible for the act. As writer Paul Williams--whose 1975 profile on Dick was partly responsible for launching Dick's modest fame during his lifetime--points out, Dick was charmed by this notion, and actually spent some time meditating on the possibility that he had breached his own safe with explosives somehow without consciously knowing about it. No conclusions are offered, though one friend and writer speculates that some of the transient youth who crashed and used drugs at Philip K. Dick's home had violated his safe and made off with a quantity of drugs. Not long after the incident, Dick made rapid plans to leave California, heading up to Vancouver, British Columbia where he entered a drug treatment facility.

The next period in Dick's life that's examined in the documentary centers on what Dick referred to ""2-3-74"", meaning February and March of 1974. Following a period of illness, sporadic drug use, and coming out of a vitamin experiment where Dick's body had been bombarded with mega doses of Vitamin B, Dick answered a knock at his door one day to find a delivery driver from the local pharmacy had arrived with his prescription. As the girl at the door handed Dick the bag containing his prescription, his eye fell upon a Christian fish symbol pendant that hung around the girl's neck. He was then overtaken by an intense flash of light that knocked him unconscious, or at least senseless, for a period of twenty-four hours. The experience was very profound, leaving Dick with the sense that he had had an encountered with God. He referred to the experience as arising from a ""pink beam"" of light, and spent the next several years of his life writing about the experience in a body of work he titled ""Exegesis."" This piece of writing ultimately came to span 8,000 pages, and obsessed him until his death.

Interviews with Dick's contemporaries and fans are intermingled with animations of Philip K. Dick sitting at his typewriter, knocking off typewritten introductions and brief explanations about his experiences. Dick speaks through these animations; there is copious audio recordings of Dick speaking, but apparently the only footage of him on television was taped for a French network. All reviewers on the Internet Movie Database slam these animated interludes, I actually felt they added an interesting, quirky layer to this already strange and fascinating film. There is something haunting and fitting about an animation speaking onscreen for Philip K. Dick.

Although the friends, acquaintances and fans of Dick are not particularly well-spoken--seeming at times to ramble and digress from the point at hand--this only serves to further inject the documentary with the surreal mood that must have pervaded Dick's life.

Whether it can ever been determined whether Philip K. Dick was a genius or a madman, there is no question that the man lived a strange and intriguing life. He was a man of deep thought, unafraid to ask himself staggering questions about his own existence. One compliment given to his ""Exegesis"" by the publisher of Gnosis magazine, is that although it arose from a mystical experience, the work was not at all dogmatic. Dick explored numerous paths and possibilities of the source of the experience, and expressed many varying ideas on its meaning. Dick wrote his ""Exegesis"" in order to help him understand exactly what his ""pink beam"" experience was all about, not to convince others that it happened, or had some particular meaning.

As a writer, I'm always inspired by seeing documentaries about famous and infamous writers. The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick was an enjoyable surprise, and definitely a quirky piece of popular culture that is worth finding and viewing.",1115942400,5,5465,5.005500550055006
1409424,1,B000059TOO,"I bought this (without reading the reviews) because I thought it would provide some real context to the genius whose work spawned so many excellent movies, but was I ever disappointed.

I read PKD's stories back when he was alive, and was hoping for some insight into how his mindset influenced his work. There was very little of that. This was a movie that cried out for some critical synopis of Dick's work, and should have tied his eccentricities or psychosis to his output. Instead, we are left with reminicences, some of which are interesting, but very little insight into this artist. A big disappointment--even for a fan.",1098316800,4,628,4.814814814814815
1409425,3,B000059TOO,"Some day Philip K. Dick may get the documentary he deserves, one that gives us the life and the works; unfortunately, this isn't it.  ""The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick"" is, at best, the first step.  And while I appreciate the effort put into making this film, as well as the astute contributions by interviewees, this is a seriously flawed production, and does, indeed, seem like a college project hamstrung by a commensurate lack of funding.

For instance, as the director was unable to use any actual video of PKD, he hit upon the idea of using a cartoon version of PKD to segue from one ""segment"" to the next, but also to provide the ""medium"" to present a garbled, and at times, indiscernible PKD speaking in an interview, without, however, the benefit of subtitles.  As Elvis Mitchell noted in his review of the movie for the NY Times, the ""animated version of Dick behind the typewriter, which suggests a low budget version of the Cryptkeeper...underscores the minimal amount of money the filmmakers had (reportedly about $10,000) to finish the project, which was shot on videotape and feels even more cheaply done than an episode of ""Biography"" on A&E."" (3/2/2001)

To note that mind-numbing repetitions of the same minimalist animation overlaid with an abysmally god-awful techno(?) soundtrack that no one in their right mind should be subjected to would be to belabor the obvious. Suffice it to say that before long I was muting the music, and then fast-forwarding through the un-animated animated segments to locate the next interesting ""human"" moment.

Insofar as the dvd bonus features package goes, forget about it.  The dvd simply recycles the comments already presented in the film.  So there is nothing new except for the interview with the director and the definitions of a half dozen key terms in the late oeuvre. Big deal.

Given the fact that some half dozen of PKD's stories have been made into movies (with more reputedly on the way), its high time for a full scale documentary.  This ""Gospel"" may be a first attempt, but PKD deserves more and better.  Seriously.

[As a side note: back in the day, when it lived up to its name, The Learning Channel aired a wonderful series (co-executive produced by Walter Cronkite and Goeffrey C. Ward) called ""The Great Books.""  Imagine what they might have done with Philip K. Dick.]",1095552000,14,2348,4.854636591478696

Dick's life, and with virtually no discussion of his fiction, it would be incomprehensible to a newcomer. But since it contains nothing that hasn't been widely known about PKD's life for many years, longtime fans will find most of it boring. But besides this, the entire film is hindered by amateurish production values. As many have already pointed out, the film is padded by repetetive, crude animations which serve no real purpose, and features an electronic soundtrack that sounds like it was lifted from a PBS special, circa 1985. While watching it, I finally lost all hope of improvement during the sequence when the librarian at California State University (where many of PKD's manuscripts are kept) painstakingly explains the procedures for checking out materials from Special Collections. (And then, ironically, not a single page of any of PKD's manuscripts is displayed in the film.) The people who are interviewed (with the exception of the librarian) all have something interesting to say, but due to the filmmakers' total lack of editing skills, the film is painfully slow to watch. And most of the audio clips of PKD himself speaking were from the cassette issued fifteen years earlier by the PKD Society and widely available. I actually felt the deleted scenes section of the DVD contained more interesting material than anything that was left in the film, such as Ray Nelson discussing PKD's friendship with Bishop Pike. One wonders what led the filmmakers to conclude that watching their little animation of PKD at a typewriter for the sixth time made for better cinema than this material.

Dick.  (Not surprisingly the only conclusion made was that Philip K. Dick's death was a tragic loss.)

I personally get a better sense of Philip K. Dick from his novels than from this DVD.  I realize this film was a labor of love and the creators could only utilize what was available however the poor audio on Dick's recordings was a disappointment.

1409429,4,B000059TOO,"This is a very fun and informative documentary for aficionados of Philip Kindred Dick whose writings directly inspired such science fiction film classics as Total Recall (based on the short story ""We Can Remember it for You Wholesale""), Minority Report (based on the story ""Minority Report""), and Blade Runner (loosely based on ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep""). Nonetheless, Dick made only a little bit of  money near the end of his life time before he died of massive heart attack in his early fifties. He had been married several times, may have been abused as a child, and seemingly experienced benzedrine- and sodium pentothal-potentiated schizophrenia that was also a form of mysticism as well as an inducement to his multiply interpretable science fiction plots. On February 3, 1974 he had an extremely realistic 24-hour hallucination that he raced to explain throughout the remaining years of his life with such questionable concepts as alien contact and the stopping of time. (A Google search should reveal the 52-point Appendix to VALIS which gives an overview of this bizarre cosmology.) Thus, as the filmmakers correctly realized, Dicks life is theoretically of as much epistemological and science fiction interest as the plots he derived from it. This will disappoint you if you want to see a state-of-the art science fiction movie, but it is quite fascinating if you are just looking to get closer to the wellspring of Dicks incredible productivity/creativity. The documentary features interviews with individuals such as Paul Williams, the Rolling Stone journalist who published an interview with him (whose audio tapes have been cleverly used to dub a tasteful cartoon rendition of Dick speaking to us from beyond the grave at his typewriter) and  Robert Anton Wilson, author of The Illuminatus Trilogy and a cult figure in his own right (he is a trip).

As a whole, the various interviewees offer insights of uneven interest (the most notable contributions being arguably made by R. Nelson, D. Scott Apel, J. Kinney and P. Williams), and some anecdotes seem out of place, needlessly extending the film's running time while providing little in the way of intellectual substance. There's no doubt that it could have digged deeper - Dick's work is certainly complex enough to warrant a more meticulous treatment - and the best way to introduce oneself to Dick's world and ideas has always been and still is to read his books.

Nor does it concentrate on anything that could be considered his ""Gospel."" It's just a group of people who knew him sitting around talking about him. Not even together, with exchanges of ideas, but with an off-camera interviewer. Of the group, the only one I'd ever heard of before (met, actually, when I lived in San Francisco) was Robert Anton Wilson. He's an appropriate one to talk about PKD, because both of them were enormously creative and totally crazy. It takes a kind of madness to write really good science fiction.

The other very annoying feature is a padding out of the length of the video by a cartoon of a manual typewriter, someone who is presumably Phil typing, and all the details: pick up a piece of paper, fit it into the typewriter, roll the paper up, push the lever that advances the carriage to a new line, click a bunch of keys, pull the paper out of the typewriter and show what is typed on it. This is done for the opening credits, and for each of the ""chapter"" headings, and in my opinion, only serves to test the viewer's patience.

In addition to Robert Anton Wilson, there is Paul Williams, who wrote an interview of PKD in Rolling Stone in 1975; Jason Koonick, who runs philipkdick.com; D. Scott Apel, author of PKD: The Dream Connection; Miriam Lloyd, who is described as a ""close friend"" of PKD; Ray Nelson, author of ""They Live""; Jay Kinney, publisher of Gnosis Magazine; Duncan Watson, webmaster of pkdslepthere.com or perhaps it is philipkdickslepthere.com

I watched it all the way to the end mostly to see if they ever really said anything worthwhile. They did get into some of PKD's later life, when he was doing a lot of drugs and having some pretty bizarre psychedelic experiences, and I suppose that was meant to be the ""Gospel"" part. As a skeptic, I was having trouble with the sound of ""I halfway believe it was real"" in these friends who watched the man's mind deteriorate.

I'm not sure why because I usually don't have that reaction to animated content.  The credits at the beginning and the animated typed pages that gave written information instead of narration both seemed like padding to the film to meet some specific number of minutes.  The lack of a narrator may have been a cost issue or thinking the animated PKD could compensate may have thought to have been a excellent idea but it wasn't.  Those parts plodded along.

What I liked was seeing the interview sections which were fascinated and the film was broken up into a number of topic areas related to the gospel of Dick, like the visions and the Xerox missive but there were only a few viewpoints given in each section with the interviews for extremely complicated topics.  I think an entire movie could be made exploring the 1971 break-in or pink beam visions and related events.  What could have been an interesting view that many fans may not have the resources to see is the visit to the collection at Fullerton but the detail there goes overboard including a librarian running through the process to view the collection pieces.  Overall I was disappointed in this documentary and hoped for more content and less filler.",1328400000,,1518,4.71969696969697
7934167,1,B000059TOO,"I was a teenager when the first Star Wars came out and like many teenagers at that time I immediately became very interested in Sci-fi.

I was somewhat interested in science fiction before Star Wars because after all we did have the original Star Trek series which was quite good and some cool movies like the first Planet of the Apes, but those were exceptions (in my opinion at the time) to the rule that most Sci-fi was just crap particularly in the execution (I now believe that most Sci-fi films today are still crap but they sure look great).

This was before even video tape and movie rentals and being young I did not have control over what we watched on TV so I had only caught slight pieces of some movie that had me transfixed even though I only caught snatches of it here and there. That movie was of course 2001: A Space Odyssey.

So along came Star Wars and suddenly Sci-Fi became epic, not just in story but in execution. Like many teenage boys I ran to the bookstore where I began gobbling whatever science fiction books a Puerto Rican kid from the projects in The Bronx could afford. I don't remember the first Science Fiction book that I bought post Star Wars but I clearly remember that the second book was Philip K. Dick's The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, which if you don't know bears no resemblence to Star Wars or any action book/film it's hard to believe they're in the same genre (generally speaking).

Looking back later in life, after reading it again as an adult, I realized that The Three Stigmata Of Palmer Eldritch was way too advanced for a person at that young age but in my very young person's point of view I still thought it was awesome even if it didn't have lasers battles and dogfights and even though I still enjoy sci-fi themed action films, sci-fi books are a different matter and The Three Stigmata Of Palmer Eldritch is probably the reason why.

Even as I write this it only dawns on me now that The Three Stigmata Of Palmer Eldritch can be actually be enjoyed by serious minded adults plumbing it for the meaning in its metaphors and teenagers who may be able to intuit deeper meaning amidst the wild and crazy events that take place between its covers.

The Three Stigmata Of Palmer Eldritch also started me on the path to becoming a fan of Philip K. Dick and I'm proud to be able to boast that I got there before all the Johnnies-come-lately that stormed the house after Blade Runner. I've read nearly all of the novels and the original five volume collection of short stories as well as the excellent biography by Lawrence Sutin: Divine Invasions: A Life of Philip K. Dick. But that was years ago; my memory is not what it once was so I plan to start all over again.

I wish The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick was a better biography, actually I wish it was a great biography because that's what Philip K. Dick deserves.

The effectiveness of a biography on an artist or author, as far as capturing the essence of its subject, can be judged by whether someone who has little to no knowledge of the subject at the very least will have their interest piqued, and at most  if they're filled with a desire to explore their work.

Philip K. Dick was a paranoid drug user who sometimes could not distinguish fantasy from reality, let drug using teenagers hang out at his house and oh he wrote some books that were kinda cool and hey, one of them was made into Blade Runner.

He also lied so he can get into a clinic for drug abusers in Canada while trying to hide from drug dealers to whom he owed money.

That's what I learned from The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick.

There is precious little biography in this biography as a decent chunk of time is wasted with bad and slow animation of a typewriter tapping out interesting gems of information such as how Philip K. Dick did not see much success while he was alive which although true, just furthers the image of him as a loser.

Several of his major works are not even mentioned such as The Man in the High Castle. You know the one that earned him a Hugo award and is often cited as one of the first examples of alternate history novels, the one where the Axis powers win WWII, the one he wrote with the aid of the I-Ching (if that doesn't send shivers down your spine I don't know what will).

Now, I also happen to be a fan of the late Robert Anton Wilson who was interviewed for this film and usually when making a film such as this, only a small amount of footage is used from the interviews and I find it hard to believe that Robert Anton Wilson or any of the interviewees appearing in this mess failed to give deeper meaning to Philip K. Dick and his works. It's almost as if the filmmakers were afraid that potential viewers would fail to appreciate the full depth of Philip K. Dick's life, works and mind. Of course some effort is made in that direction but it's lost in a desert of the colorful characterizations I noted above. So instead we get lousy animation over snippets of Philip K Dick talking about some of his works, some of which is not very clear partially because of the sound quality and partially because of the ever present bad synth music, that as I remember, never ceases.

We're also treated to interviews with some nice young men who run Philip K. Dick websites and personally I have to believe that if you're the type who will go through the trouble of creating and maintaining a web site dedicated to Philip K. Dick that you are probably intelligent and deep, but in this film these guys just come off as goofy fan boys.
The only good thing I got from this film was of personal interest as Philip K. Dick himself refers to The Three Stigmata Of Palmer Eldritch as a ""...book so extraordinary that it may have no peer...""... an insane book that was not about insanity, it was insanity."" I don't know what that says about me but I have a vague feeling that it's positive, but if all you know about Philip K. Dick was from this movie you'd have a different opinion and I couldn't fault you for that.

I fully understand that by calling the film The Gospel of Philip K Dick the filmmakers are going to dwell mostly on the pink laser incident (oh, just look it up) and the works that resulted from that experience but by failing to balance the film with a more complete and meaningful biography they render the subject they love so much down to an oversized bear of a man in need of a serious intervention, and all this after opening the film with Robert Anton Wilson comparing him to James Joyce, whom Robert Anton Wilson admired.

I would hate to see how these guys handled a writer they hated.

Opening the film with a nod to the opening of Blade Runner was just pathetically lame but I can't get the image out of my head of the filmmakers high fiving themselves over its cleverness.

Yeah, it comes across as that type of film.",1315267200,,6865,4.38630999213218
7934168,1,B000059TOO,"There's no ""gospel"" in this documentary.  It simply talks about his life in a convoluted, abstract, poorly-shot, ill-conceived way.  The interviewees knew him, but they make no attempt to do anything but talk about their personal knowledge of him.  There is little mention of his books.  No mention of his impact on modern media.  I highly recommend you avoid this.  I just wasted 90 minutes.",1307491200,,392,4.953846153846154
