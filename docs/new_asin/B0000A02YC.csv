1900051,4,B0000A02YC,"I can't really review this based on my opinion. My mother is an avid lover of BBC American Television from Are Your Being Served?, to the Detective Poirot and Keeping Up Appearances. I purchased this as Christmas Stocking Stuffer and she (we were all) snowed in starting Christmas night until Tuesday Morning and she was in my den, with a some Rum and EggNog (LOL) cracking herself up. I would've thought it was just the EggNog talking but since I've heard her on more than one occasion laughing and talking about this show; (I too have caught a few episodes) it was the show that had her laughing, as well. So I would have to give this a Thumbs Up.",1294704000,2,649,4.416666666666667

1900053,5,B0000A02YC,"A hilarous BBC comedy about everything that can happen in a store, and it's staff.",1207526400,,82,4.533333333333333
1900054,4,B0000A02YC,"First, I recommend buying this volume as part of the second boxed set of this long-running series.  You get volumes 8-13 and an extra volume 14 that has a special Mollie Sugden 80th birthday celebration with interviews from her co-stars and the first episode of the adorable ""Are You Being Served Again!"" series (known as ""Grace and Favour"" in the UK).  Volume 12, by itself, is a good one although it includes a couple of ringers.
The two below average shows are ""Memories are Made of This"" and ""Monkey Business.""  In the former, Mrs. Slocombe reverts to childhood after being hit in the head with a golf ball.  This one is silly even by AYBS? standards.  In the latter, Grace Bros. is threatened by a Japanese takeover and the staff goes to #10 in the hopes of voicing their grievances to Prime Minister Thatcher.  Oh, and there is a monkey loose in the store.  The plot goes all over the place.
Now for the good stuff:  In ""Calling All Customers,"" the staff puts on a hilarious radio play to attract customers.  The content of the play, however, draws in the wrong type of customer and the department's punk rockers must intervene.  Mrs. Slocombe's pussy is missing in ""Lost and Found"" and she mistakes a kind gesture of Mr. Humphries as a marriage proposal.  This episode probably marks the only time Mr. Spooner shows any sympathy for the senior saleswomen with the colorful hair.  In ""Good-bye Mrs. Slocombe,"" Mrs. Slocombe is considered ""redundant"" (in other words, she's too old) and is forced out.  Unwilling to retire, she takes on other jobs at the store until her co-workers can figure out how to get rid of the snooty spinster (Ms. Featherston) who has replaced her.  Mr. Humphries posing as a ""customer"" is the strategy, although ""she"" doesn't seem difficult enough to justify Ms. Featherston's reaction.
The best of this disc is ""Grounds for Divorce.""  This episode is one of my favorites of the post-Mr. Lucas seasons.  Here, almost every female seen in this show is enamored with Capt. Peacock.  He must go to drastic measures to save his marriage (even shocking Mr. Humphries).  These shows first aired between May 1983 and February 1985.  The DVD has fun graphics with rotating photos of ""Employee of the Month"" Mrs. Slocombe and a lift conductor's voice that takes you to each episode.",1074556800,8,2305,4.760705289672544

1900057,5,B0000A02YC,"Are You Being Served? Vol 12 iffers more laughs and giggles from the sales floor of Grace Brothers.  Guided by stern Captain Peacock, Mr. Humphries, Mrs. Slocombe, et al do their best(?) to keep the store alive.

Great writing occasionally marred by a mediocre episode usually has viewers waiting to eagerly call up the next episode.  All in all, Volume 12 offers more laughs than not and will keep AYBS? fans happy in their viewing habits.",1404950400,,440,4.7631578947368425

7994872,5,B0000A02YC,"I had the complete set which included this volume 12 but in our move the dvd got broken.  I re-ordered another one and was so happy to be able to go back in the set it had originally come from.  Monkey Business is a great and funny episode and Lost and Found, where Mrs. Slocum loses her cat is hilarious.  What a cast and so enjoyable.  Mr. Humphreys is cute as a button, as usual.  Captain Peacock is the true gentleman and Mr. Rumboldt is a great boss, trying to be fair at all times.  This is a great series if  one gets broken or damaged, it is worth it to be replaced.  It gives us laughs and situations that lift the spirits on those blue days.  Thoroughly enjoyable and at a reasonable price.",1425427200,,700,4.164179104477612

are good.",1421366400,,303,4.901960784313726
