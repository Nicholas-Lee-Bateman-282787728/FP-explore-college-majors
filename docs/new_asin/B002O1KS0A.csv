8375875,5,B002O1KS0A,"A succinct review of the weapons available to both North and South, from rifles through ironclads, artillery, field medical treatment, telegraph, canned food, and railroads.  Hangs together very nicely despite the seeming unconnected nature of these elements.  Lots of good visuals to drive the messages home as each is described.  Missing is the story of the HL Hunley, the rebel submarine, presumably because it was a singular experience, not something in widespread use or immediate influence.  Great video from a History Channel Modern Marvels episode.",1415923200,,556,5.5058823529411764
8375876,5,B002O1KS0A,"Civil War Tech is an excellent portrayal on how technology impacted the American Civil War of 1861-1865.  Rifled weapons, ironclads, the revolving turret, railroads, the telegraph, and other forms of technology are depicted in this fifty-minute documentary.  The program makes good use of computer animation to help the viewer better understand how the various forms of technology work.  Numerous statistics are provided in the narration.  The connection between Civil War technology and technology in modern warfare is a common theme.  I use this program with my eighth grade students while teaching the Civil War and have found it to be an effective teaching tool.  However, there are two photographs of soldiers with facial wounds which are a bit unpleasant to see; thus, if you are using this video for classroom use, you might want to warn the students about the images before showing it to a classroom audience.  Still, this is a great video about technology and its impact on warfare.",1338854400,,991,5.118012422360248
