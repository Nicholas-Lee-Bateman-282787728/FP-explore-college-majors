7485937,3,B0170PCBJU,"This is about three people of Tamil origin thrown together by the harsh vagaries of war, who then escape from Sri Lanka to France. There Dheepan gets a job as a caretaker to some blocks of flats that seem to be inhabited by a lot of low level criminals.

The film follows the travails and hardships that they all face and how they stand up to them and bring them all closer together.
***Plot Spolier Ahead ***
Now this is from French film director Jacques Audiard whose last film Rust and Bone I really liked but it was over sensational where the Killer Whales were concerned (they have never bitten a trainers legs off ever in captivity) and once again he takes liberties here but what did it for me was the fairy tale ending that just acts as an advert to refugees to flock to England every time they want to make it big in our multi cultural Utopia. The hype around this one is most definitely undeserved.",1470960000,,908,4.372781065088757
7485938,4,B0170PCBJU,"A refugee from and purveyor of war finds that escape isn't so simple in Jacques Audiard's rich, compelling Cannes award-winner, Dheepan. Dheepan has established himself as the foremost chronicler of unique, deeply intimate multicultural stories, rising to international prominance with 2009's sprawling crime drama A Prophet. That was followed three years later by the equally powerful love story, Rust and Bone, which brought together Marion Cotillard and Matthias Schoenaerts. Dheepan follows another complicated romance between lost souls looking to move beyond the past and forge a connection in a new land.

Much like his earliest work, Audiard has cast mostly unknowns and first-time actors for the central roles, adding an indisputable layer of authenticity. Antonythasan Jesuthasan plays Dheepan, an ex-Tamil rebel fleeing from wartorn Sri Lanka with a fake family in tow. His ""wife"" Yalini (Kalieaswari Srinivasan) is younger, in her mid-20s, and has absconded with 9-year-old orphan girl Illayaal (Claudine Vinasithamby) to pose as their daughter. Securing new names and passports they are granted asylum in France, where they are given shelter in a drug-infested, crime-riddled ghetto.

The transition does not go smoothly. Dheepan finds work as the building's caretaker, which also means cow-towing to the needs of the local drug lords, who show him only marginal respect. As Illayaal struggles to acclimate to public schooling, the restless Yalini begins working as the maid and cook to the uncle of the most powerful criminal around.

Emotions are complicated in any relationship but they become even more jumbled among this sham family. Feelings of loneliness and longing are clouded by what is real and what is simply a matter of proximity. The confusion is only elevated by Illayaal's defiance to fit in with the French culture, and Dheepan's haunting memories of the past. Audiard, in examining the immigrant experience, places Dheepan and his family in a new environment only to find that the same problems, the same violence, is inescapable.

Audiard humanizes his characters in such a way that it's easy to forget you're watching a film and not a documentary subject. He's aided by three tremendously powerful performances, most especially by Jesuthasan who captures Dheepan's desire for a simple family life, and his growing anger that it may never come to pass. There are so many wonderful character moments shared between them that the final act, a chaotic spiral into murderous rage, is a bit jarring. Audiard has always had a propensity for melodrama; think of the ice-breaking final scenes in Rust and Bone, but as usual he recovers from the momentary lapses with hopeful optimism. Dheepan also ends on such a note, and while that may seem unusual for this type of refugee story, the heartbreaking and tender journey Audiard sends these characters on makes it all feel well earned.",1470182400,4,2908,5.287878787878788
7485939,4,B0170PCBJU,"""Dheepan"" (2015 release from France; 115 min.) brings the story of a group of Sri Lanka refugees in Paris. As the movie opens, we see a man cremating bodies in the open, and we wonder what is happening. We also see a woman wandering around looking for a child who has lost his or her mother, which she eventually does. Eventually, the picture becomes clearer: in order to be able to migrate into Europe, these three need to pretend to be a family and use a deceased man's (Deepan) passport. They end up in a tough suburb ('banlieu') of Paris, where Dheepan gets a job as the maintenance/groundskeeper guy but where local gangs also run their drug activities. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see how it'll all play out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest from writer-director Jacques Audiard, best known for ""A Prophet"" and ""Rust & Bone"". I will go see anything this guy does, simply on the basis of his proved talent and track record, time and again. Here he brings a tough story of, on the one hand, how third-world refugees try to adopt and integrate into a Western society, and on the other hand, the even tougher challenge to survive in a crime-and-drugs infested environment. It doesn't make for easy viewing at times. The three lead performers (bringing us Dheepan, his supposed wife, and supposed daughter) are all nothing short of outstanding. The last 20 minutes of the movie will absolutely blow you away (sorry, can't say more than that).

This movie won the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. Why it has taken over a year to reach US theaters, I have no idea, but better later than not. The movie finally opened this past weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended reasonably well, but I'm not sure this movie will play more than 1 or 2 weeks in the theater, sadly. If you are in the mood for a tough family drama that gives a great insight in some of the struggles encountered by legal migrants in Europe, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video., or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Dheepan"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1469491200,6,2278,4.567237163814181
7485940,4,B0170PCBJU,"Dheepan is a film directed by Jacques Audiard of 'A Prophet' and 'Rust and Bone' fame.  It is about a Sri Lankan rebel's refugee life together with a Sri Lankan woman and a girl teenager he picked along the way in order to qualify as a refugee family for immigration to Paris, France.  It is a story about the trio who tried to adapt to the new country with limited knowledge and language skills.  Most of the story taken place in the crime-ridden housing estate the 'family' was placed, with the man working as a janitor/caretaker, the woman as a cook for a hoodlum and the girl tried to fit into the local school.
It is a unique story well told and executed with fine acting all around, especially the woman who tried desperately going to UK to join her cousins.
The only weak spot is the epilogue.  Is it supposed to be a dream or reality?  I find it better to be left on the editing room floor.",1468108800,,898,4.289940828402367

7485943,2,B0170PCBJU,"Call me curmudgeonly if you like, but I found DHEEPAN to be a rather slight tale using obvious symbolism to make its political and psychological points.

Dheepan (Jesuthasan Antonythasan) is a Tamil Tiger forced out of Sri Lanka and settled by the French government as an asylum seeker in one of the less salubrious Parisian suburbs. He claims to be married to Yalini (Kalieaswari Srinivasan) and to have a daughter (Claudine Vinasithamby), but this turns out to be a convenient lie, guaranteeing him a place to live. Dheepan gets a job as a janitor, responsible for cleaning most of the apartments on the estate. Despite his best attempts to fit in, the experience of civil war proves too traumatic for him, affecting his mental state and driving him into an orgy of violent retribution at the end.

Director Jacques Audiard's representation of the dystopian estate with its gang warfare and perpetual threat of crime is not much different from that portrayed in LA HAINE (1995). Most of the residents are immigrants from North Africa or the Middle East, so it might be argued with justification that the film perpetuates racist stereotypes of ""the other"" as somehow threatening the civilized status quo.

Dheepan's state of mind is signaled by some fairly obvious symbolism - for example, a close-up of an elephant suggesting that unpleasant memories can never be forgotten. His eventual descent into violence seems illogical in terms of what has gone before; but perhaps this is what the experience of battle does to people. On the other hand, the film does include footage of Sri Lankan rituals - for example, a Buddhist religious celebration followed by a picnic - so it could be argued that director Audiard once again associates the Other with strangeness and irrationality.

In light of current events, especially those taking place in Paris, it might be argued that DHEEPAN serves a negative rather than a positive purpose. While suggesting that the experience of war causes trauma that can never be dealt with successfully, the film almost exclusively associates that trauma with the immigrant. The only way to remove that trauma is to treat them in hospital or expel them from the country, a measure that would certainly satisfy the political right, but might not be acceptable to most believers in the democratic ideal.

The film won the Palme D'Or at the 2015 Cannes Festival. Perhaps this was due to its political content: at last a director had the guts to deal with the immigrant experience in an honest yet forceful manner. But perhaps recent political events have overtaken the film, and hence changed our impressions of it.",1452643200,,2642,4.981859410430839

8737767,4,B0170PCBJU,"This movie won awards and is well woven into a good story to watch  Since it is done by a French Director, it has received recognition about the plight of refugees.

I have friends who know people who came as refugees from Sri Lanka to Canada, Australia etc. So I knew the background before I watched this movie.  For anyone interested in the BACKGROUND, they shd see award-winning British Channe4 news Documentary NoFireZone - Sri Lanka killing fields at NoFireZone.org which I saw in US when Pulitzer Center showed it 3 different places.

If interested in a book on what happened to SriLankan refugees, see Australian Journo Grant's well-written book:

Well acted and directed.  This film will spark a dialogue on immigration with all its sides.  The film ends on a hopeful note that some dreams will be realized while other might not be realistic.  For so many they have no choice.  To leave and live or stay and die in the violent of their war torned  countries.

8737772,5,B0170PCBJU,"Note: I have tried to write only in very vague terms about the film's concluding half hour, and I think I have avoided 'spoilers', but there's no way to discuss the film without indicating in a general way how it evolves. I knew nothing about the film's story arc when I saw it, and I think that was a plus for my experience, so read forward at your own emotional risk.

Not everyone responded enthusiastically to Jacques Audiard's confusing and disturbing film. It tells of a 'family' of war refugees escaping from Sri Lanka to France. In reality none of the three in the 'family' even knew each other in Sri Lanka, but now that they've used the lie to escape with their lives, they have to keep the story up. This leads to odd, sad and fascinating dynamics. There's Dheepan  a mid 30s ex soldier suffering from PTSD. Yalini is his much younger 'wife', for whom playing family, especially 'mother' is a painful and confusing prison when she dreams of a chance to become her own person. And 'their' child is a bright, sweet 9 year old orphan who was dragged into this situation without anyone asking her permission or caring how she felt. Now the three have to figure out how to survive in a violent and poverty stricken French housing development riddled with drug dealers. It's better than where they were, but far from the haven they might have imagined.

Up to this point in the story there's no question the film is a powerful and sad human tale. Almost everyone has responded to both the situation and the excellent performances. But then there's a sudden odd and violent series of twists in the last half hour, which culminate in some extremely enigmatic final images that resist neat interpretation. These are what has caused much of the mixed reaction to the film. And I can certainly understand and even empathize with those who feel the film betrays it's first 2 acts to go off in a skewed direction that defies emotional logic. But for me, it worked. There was something dream-like for me about the whole film that allowed a sudden veering into a surreal nightmare  as sometimes happens in dreams. And something satisfying about going deeper into the specific nightmare that belongs to a tortured man who killed and watched death for years as a soldier. It may not be satisfying in a conventional sense, but it sure as hell shook me out of any more common, simple 'isn't that awful' reaction to our character's plight and pushed me into deeper thought and emotion about class, violence, the scars we carry, and what we try to hide behind our masks as we fit in to societies that can be cruel and uninterested in those at the bottom of the ladder  immigrant or local.",1483315200,2,2678,4.60587002096436
