8764074,5,B01GWCJWYO,"Overall, this is the best Gong concert I've seen on DVD.  This year 2000 concert is a treasure, because it features the late Daevid Allen and the late Gilli Smyth, both still sounding great, along with the genius Didier Malherbe on doudouk, sax and flute, and the mesmerizing Mike Howlett on bass.  It also features a great second sax and flute player, Theo Travis.  The sound is full and clear, and the long jams are top notch.  The playlist spans most of their albums, and includes Foolfare, Zeroid, Radio Gnome Invisible, Yoni on Mars, Bodilingus Intro, Bodilingus, Zero the Hero & the Witches Spell, I Am Your Pussy, a doudouk solo, Magdalene, Infinitea, Mad Monk, Flute Salad, Oily Way, Outer Temple Gliss, Inner Temple Gliss, Goddess Invocation, Master Builder, and You Can't Kill Me.

The band is having so much fun, it's infectious.  Gong just barely makes my top ten favorite bands, but this might just be my new favorite concert DVD of all time.  If you're new to Gong, approach with an open mind.  If you're a fan, you will treasure this.",1473206400,,1049,4.693989071038251
