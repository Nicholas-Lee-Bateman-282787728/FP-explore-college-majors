8331736,4,B001OYP91G,"I have always been a huge fan of TRUE CRIME and  A & E has become one of the leaders in producing TV shows dealing with TRUE CRIMES.  BIOGRAPHY  has always done individual bios of famous people that are recognizable until recently when those that we likely do not know are profiled. ""NOTORIUS: Bullets and Bad Guys"", goes beyond the famous and takes us into the criminal process by tracing crime from the initial responses through the legal process until sentencing. I find this type of investigating interesting and as always BIOGRAPHY does a great job in tracing the steps and defining the criminal process to perfection. I particularly enjoyed the segment on the bully of Toulon. In a small town where not much crime appears a triple murder is committed, tracing what actually happened through the eyes of those involved in Curtis Thompson's life and the investigators working on the case I found the case interesting and enjoyable. I would highly recommend this DVD for those interested in true crime and the criminal process.",1231027200,,1030,4.8742857142857146
