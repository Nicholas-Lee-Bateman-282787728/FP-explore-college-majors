The DVD was difficult to find when I purchased the VHS tape some years back (I transferred it to DVD myself), but both versions are currently available on Amazon. Highly recommended.",1484179200,,260,4.931818181818182
8152717,5,B000JRP1WQ,"I spent years looking for this tape!  I saw this on TV just before I left for my missionary work in Japan.  Since I am interested in most things Japanese, these very special people and their incredible creative gifts gave me tools with which to workwith other Japanese and their unique gifts in life.

The production is very good.  It is visually stimulating.  I just wish so much it was longer and more detailed.

I got to meet one of the crafts persons in the video.  She was true to NG's version.  Thank you NG.",1271203200,,514,4.336842105263158
