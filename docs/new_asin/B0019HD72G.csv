8274071,1,B0019HD72G,"I wish there had been some feedback on this product before I bought it because I wouldn't have bought it. I bought the DVD with the expectation that it would complement Peggy's book, ""Connect with your Horse."" I have been using that book as a manual to help me with my horse and have been having a lot of success. And I thought if I could also see and hear the techniques demonstrated on video, it would help me that much more. The DVD does demonstrate a few things, but mostly it's 50 minutes of a completely annoying voice over by some man talking about what Peggy is doing. It's more like a TV show with subtitles geared toward a non-horsey audience. It's almost completely useless as a learning tool as far as I'm concerned. If your reason for purchasing the DVD is simply to hear someone other than Peggy talking about her basic concepts, then you would probably like the DVD. If your reason for purchasing the DVD is to actually learn more about her techniques from Peggy herself, then don't waste your money. Buy the book instead. It's far more helpful.",1358035200,14,1060,4.4974093264248705
