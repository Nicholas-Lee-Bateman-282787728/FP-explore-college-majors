7801773,2,1933502223,"Ian Kirby obviously has woodworking skills. Unfortunately, he is not great at making a video. Ian repeatedly forgets his speech, make errors, and says ""um"" with apparently no re-takes. While I did get some knowledge out of the video, I felt like I had to suffer through amateurish mistakes with video recording. I could have gotten the same knowledge out of some youtube videos. This does not get my recommendation.",1263859200,,415,4.942857142857143
