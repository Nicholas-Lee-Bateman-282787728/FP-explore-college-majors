8207765,5,B000T4T8X2,"In Eureka Seven Volume 10 you will recieve four very interesting and insightful episodes of the show on DVD. Specifically, these episodes include 39 up to and including 42 of the series. If you haven't seen all episodes before these, my following review may confuse you, so read on at your own risk.

The Gekkostate, along with Master Norb, take a brief break from the journey to do something Master Norb considers to be very important...play soccer! The first episode shows how good members of the Gekko are at the game, and is the most lighthearted one on the disc. By its end, you are reminded of Dewey's tremendous power and that the mission is only beginning.

Next, the Gekko travels to the Vadarac shrine in the hope that Renton and Eureka will be able to meet the mysterious Lady Sakuya.  After a difficult and sneaky entrance, the two succeed and learn of the tragic past of a girl named Sakuya and a boy named Norb. In truth, both Sakuya and Eureka were created by the scub coral to communicate with humans. When Norb is appointed to take care of Sakuya, the two accidentally form an unbreakable bond.  They try to get past the Great Wall and reach the Promised Land in the hope that it will save humanity, but fail as Sakuya transforms into a flower bud and Norb has a compac drive embedded in his chest.

All hope is not lost however, as Sakuya is told of the birth of another - Eureka, who may be able to accomplish what she could not.  After hearing the story, Norb tells the two to go, as he and Sakuya will open the way for them, along with the Nirvash, to reach the Promised Land and get passed the Great Wall!

This isn't as easy as it seems however, as outside Dewey is determined to stop them. Ultimately, Holland sacrifices his own ship, the 909, to stall The END long enough for Renton, Eureka, Nirvash, and the children to reach the Promised Land, while Anemone is brutally rejected. Now that they have entered the Promised Land, what will Renton and Eureka find?

Ultimately, these are four very interesting episodes, with the first being the most comic and warm. The story of Sakuya and Norb is truly a tragic one, but one that has a happy end thanks to Renton and Eureka as the last image of the two seen is them walking away, holding hands... The extras on the disc are lacking, but do have audio commentary on one episode by the original Japanese voice actors, as usual, and an interview by the English voice of Holland. Overall, if you're a fan or collector, this disc is a must have. With only 2 discs and 8 episodes of the series remaining, how will the story change, now that it is coming dangerously close to its conclusion?",1195257600,,2657,4.463917525773196
