925605,5,6304773404,"As in the earlier movie, a beautiful woman marries a mysterious man who may or may not want to murder her for her money. This is a diifferent story than Suspision but it does seem the Hitchcock film at least inspired this movie.

Giving away plotlines will take away from enjoyment of the film so that will be avoided. Rob Lowe is no Cary Grant in this movie (or any other for that matter) but he does manage to handle his part. Meg Tilly is excellent and her performance carries the movie. In the Hitchcock film, Joan Fontaine won a best actress Oscar in the newleywed part and Tilly's work here is of that caliber.",1138406400,8,616,4.356521739130435
925606,4,6304773404,"A handsome gigolo, Tim Whalen (Rob Lowe), meets a wealthy heiress, Olivia Lawrence (Meg Tilley), and her selfish and domineering stepfather is far from happy with their relationship. The local cop (Doug Savant) also expresses an interest in the Lawrence girl.
A subsequent string of murders puts each of the characters under suspicion and the wealthy Lawrence girl is suddenly caught up in a murderous plot that will see both her inheritance and her life put at risk.
'Masquerade' is a tense thriller containing a multitude of twists and turns that keep the viewer guessing to the end. It is in the same vein as 'Bad Influence', 'Sleeping with the Enemy', and 'Dead Calm'. I first watched this film when it was released on VHS in 1988 ... it is still as exciting today.
Watch it with someone you can trust.
Also stars Kim Cattrall and John Glover.
The extras include widescreen format and DVD quality picture.",1080691200,27,909,4.796178343949045
925607,3,6304773404,"Meg Tilly plays Olivia, a milquetoast of an heiress who may be in mortal danger in ""Masquerade"".  Set among the rich and their tony sea-side mansions in the Hamptons, the story has Tilly as a softspoken yet beset heiress sharing a barely amicable existence with her wicked stepfather (John Glover) and his uh..witchy girlfriend. Olivia knows that millions are tied to her remaining alive, but she remains too innocent almost to the end of the movie - soothing herself by sailing her small boat on Long Island Sound (or is it the Atlantic?).  Though often falling back for help on a childhood friend who now works as a local area cop (Doug Savant), she manages to find love with an impoverished charmer played by Rob Lowe.
Is Lowe really in love with her?  What is her stepfather up to?  Can Savant protect Tilly?  Unfortunately, while full of details, Masquerade never builds up suspense because it cashes in its chips too soon - the script has mysterious events remove potential threats to Olivia's existence, whether it's Glover or a very pre-""Sex and the City"" Kim Catrall.  By the middle of the movie, Lowe remains the only possible avenue of danger, but the thin script gives him no chemistry with Tilly.  The final twist seems perfunctory - it is a surprise, but by then, who cares?  It's a shame because we can see how Lowe and Tilly are trying to break out of the meaninglessness of their roles.",1072656000,3,1403,4.67479674796748
925608,4,6304773404,"MASQUERADE IS ROB LOWE'S BEST MOVIE!!! Rob Lowe is at the top of his game in MASQUERADE, young, handsome, and in a part made to order for him as a boat captain for the rich. Meg Tilly is also excellent as the poor little rich girl who falls in love with Lowe, John Glover is sensational as her scheming stepfather, Doug Savant--gay Matt from MELROSE PLACE--is terrific as the bad cop who loves Tilly, and Kim Cattrall is as good as ever as the pretty cheating wife she always seems to play.
 MASQUERADE's photography is great, John Barry's music is great, Bob Swaim's direction is great, and the movie's only flaw is that it would have been better if had been a little longer and had a little more information about the characters, but even so, Rob Lowe's unusual looks--the wide cheekbones, the hair, the well proportioned body--and perfectly matched role with Tilly make MASQUERADE an irrestible showcase for his underrated dramatic acting.
MASQUERADE IS ROB LOWE'S BEST MOVIE!!!

925609,4,6304773404,Rob Lowe stars in this unknown thriller before his personal & professinal life turned upside down. In this film he plays a womanizing playboy who charms a rich but naive heriness out of her money and tries to  frame her for murder. It's a shame this film didn't receive the recgonition  when it was first released back in 1988. But Thanks to Rob Lowe's sudden  turn around in his carrer with the sucessful Austin Power Films As well as  the hit show The West Wing people are starting to see the great potentional  Lowe once had and now he gets the chance to show it again.,959558400,2,572,4.3584905660377355

925836,3,6304773404,"Spoiler alert. Great production values in lush scenery. Rob Lowe, Kim Catrall, and Meg Tilly contribute convincing portrayals. Spoiler - there are at least two major flaws in the plot - 1) that Tilly's (a multi-millionaire due to her parents' deaths) lawyers/executors don't do a background check on her new boyfriend (Rob Lowe) even though they end up getting married. Likewise the Keystone Cop local police chief doesn't ask for a background check on Lowe although he should be a murder suspect; and 2) the director attempts a bitter-sweet ending by having one of the lawyer/executors telling Tilly at Lowe's funeral service that he ""visited me two weeks ago and insisted on being taken out of your will. He really didn't want any of your money, so, he really loved you."" I'm not a lawyer, but my understanding is that only the principal party (Meg Tilly here), can alter her well - not a beneficiary. So, this point really undermines the entire denoument. Those two plot flaws lowered my rating from 4 to 3.",1484956800,,1010,4.810344827586207

925912,4,6304773404,"This is a thriller that has some twists that I didn't anticipate and while not exactly plausible, they are not outlandish. I like that in a thriller. This movie could easily have been a formulaic soap opera thriller in the 1980's Dallas or Dynasty mode with its tale of a wealthy heiress, greed, love and betrayal but its not. Rob Lowe does his standard handsome hulk thing here that made him the heart throb of that era but the  real surprise is Meg Tilly's excellent performance as a wealthy young woman who apparently has had more than her share of grief with the recent death of her mother. Tilly does this vulnerable and longing for love woman perfectly, and yes as noted in the other reviews there's some good steamy sex in this movie. It's a good movie.",1484006400,6,760,4.507246376811594

I loved this peek into the lifestyles of the rich, and there were jaw-dropping twists and turns everywhere.  Maybe other viewers saw these things coming, but I sure didn't!!!

I don't think it is even the first movie in history about a hustler after a woman's money, but it was so good! Meg Tilley is PERFECTLY cast as the preppy heiress and Rob Lowe ALWAYS does a good hustler (see Bad Influence...different kind of hustle, but also a fun rise). His acting is not fantastic, but he sure is pretty in this one!

The sex scene goes down as one of the sexiest I can ever remember, and I don't mean to be crass here but Meg Tilley did THE most realistic onscreen orgasm I have ever seen. I am not kidding; VERY convincing. You've got to see this. it shows all the others you've seen as a total joke. I don't know how she pulled that off. Wonder how many takes it took! The music during that scene (and others) is exquisite...sinister music played during ""the seduction for money""...brilliant (although at this point I don't think it was about money anymore...which makes the ending that much more sad).

It's a really, really sad film on so many levels, and lonely Olivia (Meg Tilley) just cannot seem to catch a break in life. Every time she does...tragedy ensues.  A reminder than money cannot buy happiness.

I don't want to give stuff away here; just check it out!

P.S. Have fun looking at some of the most atrocious set decoration you've ever seen. I know it was the 80s and a beach setting, but the NYC apartment, which should have looked like Studio 54 (though not Olivia's style) looks like  the bedroom of a six year old. Then it again, it underplays Olivia's nave nature on some levels.",1409443200,5,1732,4.507987220447284

I listen to John Barry's composition for this film, every morning while driving to work. Who knew when I was sixteen years old watching this film, it would carry on with me well into my adult years.

Anywho, This film started my obsession w/all the 80's Hollywood hunks. Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise ..etc.

Meg Tilly was amazing and I really connected w/her character. I felt sorry for Olivia (Meg) she had way too much money and no real friends. It also made me think about rich people in general. I'm sure its hard to know who to trust when you have so much. What fun is there in living in a big old mansion by your self???

There are twists in the twists (the masquerades) that are supposed surprise you.

Just another movie to take people's money and not entertain them. I can remember that the big selling point back then when this movie came out was that you got to see Rob Lowe's naked rear. Big deal. Who wants to waste their hard earned money and life on something like that? Also the first . . . probably 40 minutes . . . of the movie was about nothing. You hardly got into the movie. And by the time you did you saw it was lazy writing and boring. The helpless rich girl was not someone you sympathized with. You see her sweating like an animal in bed with Lowe on their first date. You see her turning down the good looking supposedly do-gooder town cop she grew up with because she is aching for the bad boy. She is the one that instinctively comes up with the way to hide the murder. She isn't helpless. Lowe comes across as sleazy. For whatever reason when he opens his mouth that baby face look melts. And of course you have that ""great actress"" Kim Catrell running around with her boobs hanging out. To me this just seems like a string of scenes. There is no connection between them but the characters. It is like they showed up to shoot the scene and then went about their lives until the next day to shoot that one.

927035,3,6304773404,"I have watched this film many times to catch Meg Tilly's performance. She really carruied this picture. Kim Cattrall was nice to look at too. The yachting scenes were also quite nice.

The plot really doesn't stand up to a moment's analysis. Olivia Lawrence (Meg Tilly) is a poor little rich girl who has lost her parents and is at a loss for any direction for her life. She has a vast fortune, but apparently no responsibility in managing her affairs. The money just automatically flows in without any effort on her part. She has an obnoxious stepfather, Gatewood (John Glover), who apparently has no interest in anything outside staying drunk, sleeping with his mistress, controlling Olivia, and spending the family fortune.

The film hints that Olivia's mother was murdered by Gatewood to allow greater access to the family fortune. Now Gatewood has recruited gigilo Tim Whalen (Rob Lowe) to seduce Olivia and murder her to allow Gatewood total control of the vast fortune. Here is where the plot breaks down. Why would Gatewood need a gigilo? He can arrange an ""accidental"" death for Olivia with the help of his accomplice on the police force. He could then silence his accomplice permanently and the money is all his.  A cop who suddenly came into possesion of a substantial amount of cash would attract a lot of unwelcome attention. The larger the number of plotters, the greater the chance for exposure of the plot. After Olivia is dead, Tim Whalen would be a liability better paid off with a bullet than some cash. A streetwise predator like Whalen would obviously be aware of his likely fate in such an arrangement.

Well, in the end Olivia is noticeably pregnant, but still able to overpower the burly policeman trying to strangle her. How the cop intended to escape justice from such a public murder is never made clear. The suspension of disbelief quickly becomes too much to support. Is it too much to ask for a screenplay that can hold water?",1341273600,,1956,4.77810650887574
927036,3,6304773404,"No kidding.  Everything you've ever seen in a Lifetime movie is in this one.  Poor little rich girl Olivia Lawrence (Meg Tilly) is lonely after the loss of her mother and stuck living with her leech of a father-in-law (John Glover) who is parading his mistress (Dana Delaney) freely about their mansion.  Enter Tim Whalen (Rob Lowe) a sailing drifter with a dark past who is scheming with her father-in-law to get the 200 million she's inherited and kill her.  Whalen is also fooling around with his boss's wife (Kim Cattrall) on the side and Olivia has the obsessive affections of the local cop she grew up with (Doug Savant) to contend with.

All this fun reaches murderous proportions in the vein of movies like Bad Influence, Mother May I Sleep with Danger, etc..  Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but it's also so far fetched and somewhat predictable that it's quite campy and unintentionally funny.  The dialog is pretty hilarious, as if it was written by an aspiring junior high novelist, and we have to be honest:  Meg Tilly is a good actress, but she is no beauty.  She would have to play somebody rich, or a guy who looks like Lowe would never give her the time of day.  Unintentionally humorous, but entertaining all the same.",1339632000,,1243,4.609090909090909
927037,3,6304773404,"The synopsis of the film didn't intrigue me so I took a gamble on it and I'm glad I did. I really enjoyed this one. Throughout the film there are some twists as the story evolves. Unfortunately the main lesson is that money truly can be the route to all evil. It is a painful lesson but also I rated the movie only 3 stars because I felt the overall tone of the film was so cynical and I wasn't completely satisfied with the ending. It seemed rather anticlimactic especially when all of the deceit was exposed. There are some familiar tv stars you'll see throughout the film when they were much younger. Kim Cattrall, Doug Savant and Dana Delaney to name a few. By the way, I disagree with the other reviewer saying that the film is too sexually explicit. It doesn't even come close to Basic Instinct which also shares an R rating. The R rating here is appropriate and its a normal amount of sex. This is also more of a psychological thriller so the violence is minimum. There are a few ""thrills"" but nothing too heavy. You can see more violence on any typical modern day cop show. Still, I did enjoy the movie overall so I recommend it as a movie night treat.",1322611200,13,1160,4.325688073394495
927038,4,6304773404,"I don't think this will ever land on anyone's list of Best Films ever made.  Nor will it keep you awake pondering the philosophical implications.

But it's a good movie!  It starts out with beautiful shots of yachts racing in the Atlantic with gorgeous Rob Lowe at the helm.  Then it moves quickly to (gorgeous) Rob Lowe in bed with  Kim Cattrel, showing it all as usual, who plays the wife of the yacht's owner.  Rob does show some hint of a conscience at the betrayal when he mentions that his boss/her husband trusts him.  However it doesn't slow down the action.

Next we see the virginal looking Meg Tilly, graduating from some Catholic institution, shaking hands with the Bishop.  She wears a gold cross during the whole movie and we learn that she is very, very rich.  Then, at a dance Lowe is introduced to Tilly, while her evil step father, drunk as usual, leers at them from the bar.  Hmmmm...How is this all going to play out?

Oh, I forgot, the blond, square-jawed cop who fell in love with Tilly at age 12, and seems not to have given up that dream.  Again....how are these characters all going to interact to give us a good show?

The script is fast and clever with many twists and turns.  I won't give it away. All the actors do a good job.  Meg Tilly has the kind of face that can look very bland and boring, especially in the beginning when she's wearing her rich preppy girl outfits and one wonders if the hyper handsome Rob Lowe character could really prefer her to the sultry Kim Cattrall.  But Tilly perks up when she's in love and looks quite beautiful in the later scenes, especially in a black dress where she makes Cattrall look dowdy.

I can't give it five stars because the plot is too improbable, but if you just look at it as a good show with  pretty people, beautiful scenery, appropriately scary music and a lot of surprises, then you should enjoy it.",1207180800,,1882,4.4186046511627906
