888849,5,6304441630,"And I do not say that lightly. This is a one of his finest works. One I prefer over Monte Walsh ( 4 stars ). This is a gritty movie without all of the Hollywood enhancements. Coming back from the war, Cable finds himself disillusioned with the Confederacy cause, but ready to start his life fresh. But he finds it's not easy to start where he left off, due to Union loyalist and Confederate sympathizers. His primary problem comes from his own wife, who has her own issue with him leaving the family to go off to war and has yet to forgive him. This is a keeper. I hope Tom keeps up the great work!",1064448000,16,598,4.163793103448276
888850,5,6304441630,"The television Westerns starring Tom Selleck are among the best of the genre. I think of them all, Last Stand at Saber River is my favorite. It's a great if simple story, but one so well done you can't help but enjoy the film. Selleck is superb as a cowboy and I hope he and the TNT network continue to team for more. The period accuracy is excellent, the variety of arms refreshing for any gun enthusiast. A wholehearted thumbs-up for Last Stand at Saber River!",1061251200,8,462,4.383720930232558
888851,5,6304441630,"After reviewing Last Stand this week, and having thoroughly enjoyed Monte Walsh, I think Tom Selleck is the cowboy star of
the 21st Century. I mostly appreciate his attention to detail
in arms and cowboy gear of the period. Along with the great story
line and characters, this attention to detail is much appreciated
by a fan and student of the Old West and Old Western.
 Hope for more from Mr. Selleck in the future.
 P.S. If you read this, Tom, I'd give my eyeteeth to be an extra in one of your films",1046131200,10,503,4.340425531914893

889010,4,6304441630,"I have the three movie set with this, Monte Walsh, and Crossfire Trail. Saber River is 1.33:1 aspect ratio here and on the copy I own, meaning that there are black bars on both sides of the image. I have been watching this on Starz and their copy is 1.79:1, which means no bars. I wish that the DVD was the bar less version. The other two movies in the set are bar less, so I was disappointed that Saber River wasn't also. That said, it is a good, solid western from the mind of Elmore Leonard, who also wrote several books made into movies, like Hombre.",1482796800,,554,4.186915887850467
889011,5,6304441630,"Released to TV in 2007 and directed by Dick Lowry based on Elmore Leonard's novel, ""Last Stand at Saber River"" is a Western starring Tom Selleck as Cable, an aging Confederate who knows the cause is lost and thus comes home prematurely in the last couple months of the war (1865). He picks up his wife, Martha (Suzy Amis), and two kids (Haley Joel Osment & Rachel Duncan) in west Texas and proceeds to their small ranch in Arizona, which they discover has been confiscated by Union settlers. They understandably fight for their homestead. David Carradine and Keith Carradine play the pro-Union antagonists, one bad and the other reasonable. Tracey Needham is on hand as the former's daughter while David Dukes appears as a shady Confederate gunrunner.

This is a solid Selleck Western with a unique plot and awesome New Mexican cinematography. Cable and Martha have an interesting and satisfying story arc, as does the character played by Keith Carradine, at least as far as a secondary character goes. Needham stands out as the minxish babe while the revelation about the Confederate die-hard isn't surprising. This is a quality modern Western about making a bold stand when you have to, doing what's right even when you feel like doing what's wrong, confessing past mistakes or regrets and moving on, inner healing, living and let living. There are numerous tense standoffs and brief thrilling shootouts.

The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Santa Clara & Valle Grande, New Mexico.

889429,4,6304441630,"Yep, it's what you would expect from a Louis L'amour adaptation by Tom Selleck.  Not bad, the production was well done.  I was actually pleasantly surprised that the ""Evil"" cattle baron who we all assumed was trying to steal everyone's land from them, was not really all that bad . . . and even turns out to be one of the good guys in the end.  That was a twist I wasn't expecting.  But the reason for not going 5 stars on this was the whole seduction scene.  I mean really, are we to believe that he is so oblivious that he wouldn't realize what the ""bad"" girl was trying to do . . . drive a wedge between the hero and his hard core frontier wife who just blew 2 bad guys away in order to protect her man?!?  I tell you what, after seeing what the wife can do with that double barreled 12 gauge, I'm not sure any man in his right mind would dream about cheating on her (and he doesn't).  All in all, it's a good movie, and one you can sit and watch with the kids and not have to worry about sex, drugs, foul language and tooo much in your face bloodshed.",1419552000,,1055,4.019138755980861

889432,5,6304441630,"This is a very good western by the very good writer, Elmore Leonard, with superb acting and action, as well as a subtle psychological study of the character of the people in the tale.
A Confederate man returns home from the Civil War in 1865 just before the war ended and refuses to return to the battle. He wonders why he had left his wife and children, enlisted, left home to fight, and was gone for three years. He is disillusioned because of what he saw in the war, especially a particular battle. Although he loves his wife, he is no longer the man who left and does not relate to her well now.
His wife was told that he died in battle and is surprised that he is still alive. She must now engage with a man she thought was dead and change her daily habits. She finds it hard to deal with her husbands changed mood and his desires. He wants to go off again and make money, but she wants him home and for him the take her and their children, leave Texas, and go home to Arizona. They go and find that their home has been taken over by a family with northern sympathies.
The family with northern sympathies has a man who was kicked out of the northern army but still wears a northern uniform. He thinks of himself as General Grant. He wants the family from Texas driven from their home.
Nearby is a man who is secretly buying guns and selling them to the Confederacy. He is strongly, very strongly, supportive of the Confederacy and dislikes that the man from Texas does not want to help the South.",1418688000,,1501,4.270175438596492

I've been reading all of Elmore Leonard's books and then watching the movies that were based on the books to see how they compare.  I expected this one to be really good since the book was good and I love Tom Selleck, but I was a little disappointed in this adaption.  Wasn't as great as I was expecting.  The book was so fantastically written that I was amazed at how much this movie fizzled.  I know they have to change some things around to explain the story line, but this was so off base with the book's story line that I was left really disappointed.  Too bad.

889757,4,6304441630,"Last Stand at Saber River is a good western that has a more emotional tone than most westerns. This time Selleck plays Paul Cable, a Confederate soldier who unexpectedly comes home, but not before generating anger and animosity from his wife. Cable tries to rebuild his stance as a family man, while contending with Union loyalists who took over his property when he was at war. Cable's wife, Martha, is a woman of strength and resilience, and knows how to stand up to a fight. Her husband's absence while trying to raise two small children only strengthens her resolve; she lets her passion spill over into fighting alongside her husband for what's right, even if she didn't agree with how things went in the past. In the end, she accepts her husband, and learns to love again. This film has its share of gun fights, and the scenery is good. I would've liked to have seen a more expansive set and environment in this one, but what was presented here is still acceptable. To me, westerns have the saloon, bartender, rides through town, and a lot of gunslinging. Last Stand at Saber River is a western with a human touch, and is enjoyable to watch. 8/10",1326240000,,1152,4.597087378640777

889759,5,6304441630,"""Last Stand At Saber River"" stars Tom Selleck and Suzy Amis as a couple being reunited at the end of the Civil War, as Tom Selleck's character returns from Confederate soldier duty.  Upon arrival back with his pioneer woman spouse (staying with her father in TX), he discovers one of his children has died while he was away, and returning to his home in Arizona, also finds out his property there has been confiscated by the opposing side Union army.  As the story unfolds further, Keith Carradine and David Carradine (Union army sympathizers) tangle indirectly with Tom Selleck and Suzy Amis.  Tracey Needham portrays her role as sister to Keith Carradine, and visits Tom Selleck while Suzy Amis is away.  It's just a movie, so even though she's living in the raw wilderness of circa 1865 as a seasoned mustang handler amidst an otherwise male bastion crew, naturally Tracey Needham is absolutely drop dead gorgeous and looks like she just walked out of Saks Fifth Avenue; so lovely you can smell her perfume just watching the movie.  Made me wish this movie had been rated ""R"" instead of being a made-for-TV flick.  Suzy Amis is attractive too, don't get me wrong, and I'd definitely want Suzy Amis on my side of a gunfight.  The movie flows along nicely, with a sort of sluggish start.  The bad guy gets his due, and as the movie draws to conclusion, Suzy Amis decides to be less spiteful and angry, which means Tom Selleck is going to finally get to have Sir Lancelot make a significant deposit with the Fort Knox vault.  Which gives a whole new meaning to otherwise ending a movie by horseback riding off into the sunset as the camera fades to black.  Hi Ho Silver, awaaayy !!",1296345600,,1681,4.62962962962963

The always-reliable Selleck is convincig in the lead role and Suzy Amis is fun to watch to in the corresponding female lead. It's also kind of neat to see a very young Haley Joel Osment two years before he became famous in ""The Sixth Sense.""

Once again, as these westerns tend to be, the viewer is treated to some beautiful scenery and in addition, a good story of a man taking taking family back home to Arizona - not the north or south - after the Civil War and not finding a nice welcome from the home folks.

In this film, we also get two Carradines: David and Keith, villains but not as despicable as many are shown in other westerns. The Carradine family has produced some really fine actors over the years.

889809,4,6304441630,"Over the years, Tom Selleck has developed into somewhat of a western icon. And why not? Selleck is spot on in fleshing out those qualities most cherished by folks of the untamed old west. And, of course, it doesn't hurt that he looks the part, all tall and rugged and bemustached. He's at it again in LAST STAND AT SABER RIVER, the 1997 TNT oater. In this one, he plays Paul Cable, a weary ex-Confederate soldier who returns home to Texas, knowing full well that the war between the states has already been lost, even as it rages on.

The terrible war has left scars on Cable, but it's also deeply impacted his wife and children. In his absence, his family had learned how to get on. His suddenly showing up causes tension to surface and mount as everyone is forced to cope with the new family dynamics. In particular, Cable's relationship with his steely wife Martha is in the crumbles. His wife never did see why Cable had to go off to war in the first place. During his years away, their daughter fell ill and passed away, and this leaves a lingering bitterness within Martha. She is so deeply resentful of her husband.

Struggling to readjust, Paul Cable takes his family back to the Arizona territory, back to their old homestead. But it ends up becoming yet another battle for Cable as he learns that Union sympathizers have overran his ranch. With his wife and children directly imperiled, Paul Cable means to fight one last time, to keep his land and his family.

LAST STAND AT SABER RIVER, adapted from Elmore Leonard's gritty novel, is more a contemplative western drama than a typical shoot-em-up, although things do climax with two pretty darn good action sequences. Much of the tension is provided by Selleck and Suzy Amis, who is very good and intense as his estranged wife Martha. Tom Selleck has done this type of role so often now that he can do it in his sleep. Not to say that dude is sleepwalking here. Selleck brings a worn down gravity to his role. His character is stoic, although he's good enough that you glimpse the sub-text of alienation, of a man tired of warring and who merely wants a return to a normal life. Selleck exudes quiet strength and enough machismo that he gets away with sporting a pink-colored shirt for much of the film. Veteran western actors and brothers, Keith and David Carradine, step in for good performances, particularly Keith, whose character rises above the role of predictable designated villain. And, whoever that girl is who plays David Carradine's refined but bored daughter, well, she's muy caliente.

Tom Selleck hasn't disappointed in any of his western films, although it's been a few years since he's done one, what with his involvement with the Jesse Stone movies. I say it's time for the man to get back in the saddle, hoist them six-shooters, and, yes, maybe even sport that pink shirt again (would it help to call the shirt salmon-colored?). There's still plenty of Louis L'Amour and Zane Grey novels out there, just waiting for someone to bring them to cinematic life. And Tom Selleck, he continues to embody that ideal man of the frontier.",1227916800,,3108,4.676416819012797

889861,4,6304441630,"Though the western has all but disappeared from the cinemas these days, the genre is by no means dead. Instead, it has moved to the realm of the small screen. ""Last Stand at Saver River"" is just one example of the many westerns that have come on TV since the late 1970s. Featuring Tom Selleck as an ex-Confederate returning home, this is a fine film that deals with the effects of war on both a person and their family. While not one of the greatest efforts from TNT, the sometimes weak storyline gets elevated through terrific performances, including one of Selleck's greatest, and great gunfights and action sequences. Fans of the western genre will surely enjoy ""Last Stand as Saber River.""

889865,3,6304441630,"Selleck and the rest of the players clearly had a good time filming this entertaining western.  The chemistry is much like John Wayne's friends and family productions.  They even bond as friends on screen after the hero (Cable) and his wife kill numerous friends and associates of the Carradine brothers.  David Carradine's daughter tries to seduce him to undermine his marriage, and, when she is rejected, gains respect for him, if not a crush.  To be fair, pretending to hate Tom Selleck would present a daunting challenge even for the most seasoned actor.  Another similarity to Wayne films is the attention to detail on firearms and their handling.  Touches like this make the story much more believable.  The action scenes are well done and exciting.  One criticism is in order regarding the climax:  How does a one-armed embittered Confederate veteran drag 10 or so cases of Enfield rifles out of the cellar of his trading post and load them into a wagon?  One of these rifles weighs around ten pounds.  The answer is that it doesn't matter; just enjoy the movie.",1219795200,,1069,4.850828729281768

889868,5,6304441630,I think Tom Selleck could perform in any western and be great. He's a real natural.  Tom Selleck (Paul Cable) came back from war with only one thought of putting his life back together and to find he has only  to face the hardships of fighting again to regain what we rightfully his when he left and to a wife Suzy Amis (Martha Cable)who has her own battle of adjustments.  Now she must face the fact Paul is alive after she believed he was dead. She must deal with the anger she has because she blamed  him for leaving his children and her to fight in the war.

It is set in The Arizona Territory in the time period immediately following the Civil War.  The plot, the acting, and especially the weapons used are all superb, and in the case of the firearms very authentic to the period!  In fact Sellecks's character, Paul Cable, is first seen coming home from the war and stopping off in Texas to gather his family.  It is here where Cable is given a beautifully engraved, ivory handled Colt conversion revolver that his father in law gunsmith built for him while he was away. (The gun itself was actually custom built for Selleck on an actual Colt 1851 Navy revolver by R&D Gunshop and is a museum quality reproduction - correct in every detail.)  And which he uses, along with his Henry rifle, to great affect during the many shootouts to protect his life, land, and property.  If you love western movies, and especially if you love authentic western firearms, you'll love this movie. I heartily recommend it!

I truly believe that if westerns were as popular today as they were in John Wayne's time, Tom Selleck would have become an even bigger star than the Duke himself, and this is coming from a huge John Wayne fan!

889947,4,6304441630,"""Last Stand at Saber River"" was the first of three excellent Westerns that Tom Selleck made for TNT between 1997 and 2003 (and I'm still hoping there'll be at least a fourth one some day). Selleck has starred in five made-for-TV Westerns total, three of which are based on Louis L'Amour stories. This one, however, is based on a book by Elmore Leonard, and the difference is obvious in both the lack of idealism and in the extreme violence.

Selleck is Paul Cable, a Confederate cavalryman who has come home from the Civil War (only slightly) early. He knows the war is lost for the South, he is worn out, and he only wants to take his family back to their homestead in Arizona to live a normal life. His wife, who was told that he was dead, is less than thrilled to have him back home because she is resentful that he left to fight in the war in the first place. Suzy Amis does an excellent job as Martha Cable. She is not the stereotypical beauty who runs around in a bustle under fancy dresses. She is a tough frontierswoman who has experienced many hardships and gets her husband out of some tight spots as the movie progresses.

While the majority of the movie is good at depicting the divisions between North and South that caused the Civil War and which the Civil War then exacerbated, the subplot of the inner struggles that Paul and Martha Cable face is far more interesting. It's a great movie until the end, when we get the additional time-worn subplot of a Confederate soldier who just can't give up the Lost Cause. No, it's not Selleck's character who has this problem, but Selleck already had covered this territory in 1982's ""The Shadow Riders"" (though it wasn't his character who wanted to keep fighting in that movie either); John Wayne's ""The Undefeated"" is another well-known film with the Lost Cause plotline.

In spite of the needlessly melodramatic ending, this is a strong Western. Selleck and TNT kept getting better and better with ""Crossfire Trail"" and ""Monte Walsh"". Check out all three, and you'll join me in wishing for number four.",1162512000,16,2061,4.610354223433243
889948,5,6304441630,"Tom Selleck takes on a serious role in this made for TV western.  He stars as Confederate soldier Paul Cable, realizing the war is lost, returning to find his wife and family...hoping to pick up the pieces of a life he left behind.  His wife Martha(Suzy Amis) isn't so happy to see him..she had thought him long dead..and was trying to get on with her life.  With family, daughter Clare and son Davis(Haley Joel Osment), they leave Martha's father(Harry Carey Jr.) in Texas and head for Arizona and their ranch home.  Upon arriving in Arizona, they find that the Union sympathizers(Keith and David Carradine) have confiscated their land..everyone still thinking he was dead.  This requires them to fight for their home and for their acceptance in the rebuilding of life after the Civil War.

This is a well put together movie with good continuity.  Not only does it have the western action but it also effectively shows the rebuilding of the marriage relationship between Cable and his wife.  Susy Amis does a great job in portraying a wife that is ready to make her stand for family and home.  Selleck puts in one of his better performances and shows that he can seriously act.  Well worth adding to any western collection.",1151280000,16,1224,4.758293838862559
889949,5,6304441630,"It is truly a pity that the western has died off. They are rare and far between these days. A few years back Tom Selleck and Sam Elliot made a few together and separate. They are all worth seeing. This one has Tom playing Cable, a confederate soldier who has left the war early because he knows it is over and the South has lost. It just hasn't been declared yet. His family and friends thought him to be dead, and the reunion seems a bit shaky. His wife played by Suzy Amis, is a tough as nails no nonsense frontier woman that knows guns well from her fathers gunsmithing business.

Eventually she works things out with her husband Cable and it is a good thing he has her to back him since she is great with a gun. Even though Cable believes the war is over he finds sympathizers trying to enlist his aid in the confederate cause but he shuns them. When he is accused of murdering a retired Union officer he must track down the real murderer and bring him to justice. The production values are excellent and the acting, directing, sets, and music are all top drawer. Good DVD quality but no extras. If you enjoy westerns you should find it very entertaining.

890028,3,6304441630,"Tom Selleck does a great job in westerns. He plays the gritty, no-nonsense type well and does so with a sense of style and determination reminiscent of the Duke. He does so in this film. It's a shame, it not better than it is.

Selleck plays a confederate officer near the end of the war. He knows the war is a lost cause and he has been disillusioned. He heads back to Texas to pick up his family with a mind of taking them back out to their homestead in Arizona. Everyone is surprised to see him. They all believe he is dead. He is in turn surprised to find that his youngest child is dead. The news had not gotten to him for years. Meeting up with the wife is a strain. They have some personal issues to deal with and each has a generous share of emotional baggage. Dealing with the baggage, though takes time and there are other issues to deal with.

Selleck's spread in Arizona has been taken over by people who thought he was dead. They are Union sympathizers and have no use for a former Confederate. Selleck, though, just wants to get on with his life and repair the damage to his family. This is easier said than done. The Union folk see him as a threat to their lives and their profits. There is also a diehard Confederate who runs the dry goods store. He runs guns for the Confederacy and tries to suck Selleck into his machinations. When the war does end, he is unable to let it go and continues to stir up trouble for which Selleck is blamed. It is only when the Yankees and Confederates begin to work together that healing begins to take place in both the community and the family.

This film is mostly well done. The characters are strong and the production values are good. The problem is that it is utterly predictable in most places and that there is little sense of excitement. It was worth watching but not worth owning. That is a disappointment. It could have been more.

As an additional note, other reviewers have reported problems with the disk. I too had a problem. After the introductory screen, the tv went black and a menu never came up.

890033,4,6304441630,"The age of the Hollywood western had its apex in the middle of the 20th century, then with the change of modern society in the 1960's, the western genre lost its allure and Hollywood abandoned westerns for other fare.  Thanks to Ted Turner and his love for American Western film making, the long lost western has been reborn in a big way.  Tom Selleck continues to impress audiences as a true western hero in the tradition of John Wayne.  Selleck is more than adequate for the part, big in body and big in acting skill.  He takes the part of Paul Cable, and turns his character into someone we can believe, like, and respect.

Cable comes back from the Civil War months before its official end. He is tired of war and killing, and wants to return home to raise cattle in his home state of Arizona.  In trying to escape his wartime experiences, Cable runs into more trouble at home.  He finds his wife terribly embittered by his absence, and his home farm is now run by former union soldiers who are naturally hostile to a returning Confederate soldier.  Cable must not only fight to regain his farm, but he must also try to rekindle the love that has been lost in his marriage.

The story by Elmore Leonard is a solid one and very believable.  There are no dull or boring scenes, the picture grabs you and holds you throughout.  Selleck is terrific as Paul Cable, fighting for his family, his woman, and his life.  Selleck once again establishes himself as a solid western actor in the mould of John Wayne.  He is every man's western hero. Selleck carries the picture on his broad shoulders with ease.  He is supported with a fine ensemble cast, including Suzy Amis as his embittered gritty wife, and Haley Joel Osment (of ""The Sixth Sense"" fame) in a minor role as Selleck's son.  Amis portrays a western pioneering woman in perhaps one of the most realistic role ever portrayed.  Too many times we see western wonmen portrayed as prissy and prim, dressed in their long skirts and blouses without a scuff or mark of western sand or dirt.  Amis' portrayal as Mrs. Cable breaks the mould; we see her with dirt and dust on her face, with sweat dripping in lines across her face, and with a surprising ability to hold her own with wagon reins in her hands, or for that matter, a rifle.  I personally welcome this portrayal of western women, as it is undoubtedly more realistic than the western wife sitting pretty in her muti-layered petticoats.  David and Keith Cariidine are fine antagonists in the fight for the family farm.  Harry Carey Jr. plays a small role as Selleck's father-in-law.

As a collector of fine western films, I intend to keep ""Last Stand at Saber River"", as it is an excellent western film in the tradition of the great Hollywood westerns; it's not an epic, but it is fine film-making and will please those craving for a fine western drama. I recommend it.

890035,5,6304441630,I saw this TNT a few years ago and was wondering when it was coming out on dvd and I'm glad they finally did!! This is well made with a great cast and well-paced..Tom Selleck is the perfect choice in this role and he's excellent throughout...They should make more of these westerns written by Elmore Leonard and Tom should star in every one of them!!! It's THAT good!!,1118188800,7,368,4.426470588235294
890036,5,6304441630,"To see a woman who learned her father's craft of gun smithing, and hey, she can shot the darn thing!

Loved the fact that she was not squemish about useing a gun and was ready to fight for her husband and family.

In their trip from Texas to the Arizona territory we got to see [in theory] some rugged, beautiful country.

Had to chuckle at Carradine's smart-alec daughter thinking she could seduce Cable. [The little hussy]  Three cheers for Cable's restraint.

Great action and more to the true life and living for that period.  Was greatly appreciated.

Although I surely did like Selleck in Quigley Down Under with that rifle and his besting of that up-start.

I did find it hard to understand how the teams of horses broke away from the wagon at the last minute [no explanation] In reality they probably would have gone over with the wagon.

Awesome characters - great exchanges - wonderful emotions - great action.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - belongs with the other great westerns!",1117670400,13,981,4.7176470588235295
890037,5,6304441630,"I must say, this is one of my favorite Westerns of all time.  Sort of like ""Shane"", it is full of emotion, and mood.  When Cable comes home from the ""Struggle"", his wife is still resentful of his leaving her and the children, even though they had heard he had been killed. I love Harry Cary Jr's line, ""Well I'll Bow"" when he sees Cable riding up. And Cable's comment to his wife, I don't want to live with someone that doesn't like me, ""I'll take you back to Texas if you want"".  Their struggle with their relationship, and the local Union Sympathizers is a great tale.  I recommend this movie to all.  Very true to life.
