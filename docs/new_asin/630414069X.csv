Hilarious lines like this await you as you endure one stink of a movie ""This Island Earth"" along with the bots and Mike.  ""Oh,  yeah.  This is when science didn't have to have any paticular  purpose.""  Pick up your copy today!  You won't be sorry!",921110400,,309,4.392857142857143
794919,5,630414069X,"I am a fan of MST3K and I know you will be, too. The premise may take some getting use to but it is well worth the effort. The commentary is side-splitting from Tom, Crow & Mike. I only wish the  producers would  have spent a little more time on Crow's escpae attempt. May have been some  real funny stuff there! It is still well worth it, though. You'll find  yourself ""commenting"" on all t.v. programs and movies. Or, like  myself, repeating some of the funnier ""comments"" from this movie.  I highly recommend this movie!!!",920678400,,525,4.473684210526316

795055,5,630414069X,"What mistie could refuse this tribute to possibly the greatest parody/satire TV series of all time? Featuring the Universal classic ""This Island Earth,"" Mike Nelson and the bots do their best to resist the torture from the evil Dr. Clayton Forester by subjecting them to bad movies as an experiment to slowly drive them crazy. Mike and the bots use comedy as their coping just as they always have while orbiting the Earth in the Satellite of Love spacecraft, which they can't escape. However, Dr. Forrester is hardening his efforts by including the movie audience!

795114,5,630414069X,"Shout Factory has done a great service by re-releasing these. The main reason being that third party sellers love to price gouge out of print titles. The packaging is slim lined, which is more convenient and cost effective. Now there aren't any new special features apparently, but that doesn't matter if you didn't own the previous version. This is a great collection of episodes. Cave Dwellers, a cheesy sword and sorcery flick. Angel's Revenge, a made for TV Charlie's Angel's rip off, co-starring Skipper and Mr. Howell from Gilligan's Island and the shining star of this collection, the sci-fi epic, Pod People. The story of an alien, prophetically named Trumpy! It tries to be a horror version on E.T. but fails in hilarious ways. This one is worth the price on it's own! Pod People contains some of the absolute best riffing in the show's history. The fourth disc is a collection of the very best (or worst, depending on you P.O.V.) short films the show has ever riffed on. My personal favorite is Why Industrial Arts? The story of a young man's unnatural obsession with wood working. It's one of the best MST3K collections, because every film's a winner here.",1502755200,,1167,4.810945273631841

With a big budget movie what better way to make it than have Mike, Tom & Crow review one of the classic Universal Monster movies in This Island Earth? It was also a great way to bridge the gap between the Comedy Central owned seasons and the Sci-Fi Channel owned seasons.

This is a fine addition to the Mistie list of films. Essentially harmless, a good time will be had by fans of the Soon-to-be-returning-to-a-TV-near-you-in-the-not-to-distant-future TV show.

795335,5,630414069X,"This review is of the MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER TURKEY DAY collection, four movies in a themed tin box. (I say this because there may be other special releases mixed into these reviews.) The movies consist of:

Jungle Goddess
The Painted Hills
The Screaming Skull - and -
Squirm

Naturally, we don't expect ""Mistie"" movies to be very good, and these fill the bill for laughable awfulness. JUNGLE GODDESS is an unbelievable concoction about a white female American whose airplane crashes to the ground in Africa, is worshipped by the natives, and has to be persuaded by two male Americans whose plane also crashes nearby that it is time to get out. THE PAINTED HILLS is a weak Lassie movie with Lassie the collie dog here called ""Shep"" (to match the diminished production values, presumably). THE SCREAMING SKULL is an unhappy attempt at a marriage between the newlyweds-in-haunted-house theme and REBECCA. At least, there's a seldom-seen GUMBY cartoon called ""Robot Rumpus"" included as the short, which got superior riffs from the SOL 'bots, of course. SQUIRM is about earthworms in the coastal south who become electrified and wreak havoc, to the consternation of a backwoods family, the new Yankee boyfriend down for his first visit, and the dunderhead whose father runs an earthworm business.

These four movies were selected at various point in the Mistie television broadcast run, and the spaceship-bound botmasters run from early Joel Hodgson to late Mike Nelson (the last of the four, in fact, features Mary Jo Pehl as the antagonist, playing the mother of ""Dr. Clayton Forrester"" since Trace Beaulieu had already left the show). Bells and whistles are minimal, just a few mock trailers and some introductions by a notably more mature Joel, but the riffing and scatting the bots and their human masters give these slack movies is always spot-on. The cost is reasonable, and there's a ""keepsake"" tin box to house the four discs. If you are a Mistie fan, these will please.",1483660800,2,1976,4.9818181818181815

It's particularly good as an introduction to the show, as the host segments are a little tighter and more polished than the TV episodes, and while several cast members and traditional segments are missing (Cambot, TV's Frank, the Invention Exchange of the Joel years) the simplification of the premise is helpful to new viewers.

795677,5,630414069X,"I didn't become a fan of MST3K during it's original television run, I didn't run into until a couple of years after it was canceled (I think it was around 2001) and couldn't sleep one night.  I got out of bed in the early hours of the morning, when there was nothing on TV, and came across MST3K The Movie playing on the Sci-Fi Channel.  I think I'd heard of MST3K, but really knew nothing about it, but I immediately fell in love with the jokesters as they tore This Island Earth to shreds.  Granted it's a MUCH better film than the usual schlock they'd take on in the television series, but still ripe for jokes.  Over the years I've seen the bulk of the series, at least what's available on DVD and online, and while I could probably name a lot of episodes I prefer to the film I still love it. It was my introduction and a lot of the riffs/jokes are hilarious.",1461456000,,864,4.218181818181818

795683,4,630414069X,"Not much in the way of bonus features for this re-release of the 2003 Rhino set. It'll be closed captioned, as all Shout Factory MST3K sets seem to've been since volume XXX, and this set will include the MST Hour wraps for ""Cave Dwellers"" and ""Pod People."" Other'n that, you'll get exactly the same thing you got in the Rhino set: three movies and a shorts compilation.

POD PEOPLE (episode #303): So why are the opening and closing credits of the French-Spanish co-production POD PEOPLE (1983) superimposed over (blurry) footage from Don Dohler's Baltimore-based, direct-to-video Z-movie, THE GALAXY INVADER (1985)? Blame the outfit that re-released POD PEOPLE in 1990, the original American distributor having gone belly up in 1985 after its CEO disappeared, along with a million dollars of the company's money.  As for the movie itself, it's one of the most risible things ever to appear on the series, an attempt to cross a low-budget, shooting-gallery-type horror movie with the childish whimsy of E.T.(1982). It's a highlight of season three, and probably the series' record-holder for the number of ""McCloud"" jokes.

ANGELS REVENGE, aka ""Angels' Brigade"" (episode #622): A low-budget ripoff of CHARLIE'S ANGELS that actually makes the TV series look classy. Six supermodels with martial arts/demolition skills (and their annoying middle school sidekick), decide to destroy the local drug cartel after a teen gets beaten up by a pusher. Jim Backus, Jack Palance, and Peter Lawford humiliate themselves in embarrassing roles, and there's a surprisingly relevant Bruce Jenner joke (from 1995!). A consistently funny episode.

CAVE DWELLERS (episode #301): Is this the worst sword & sorcery movie ever made? It's certainly the most incomprehensible, in which Conan-wannabe Ator comes to the aid of his sorcerous mentor, ""The Great One"" (and his hot daughter Mila) to defeat the simpering conqueror Zor. Any attempt to relate the details of the alleged plot will only give you a headache, so let's make it brief and consign CAVE DWELLERS to the lowest circle of movie riffing hell. It is, in a word, unmissable.

SHORTS, VOL. 1 is just that, a cut-and-paste anthology featuring ""The Home Economics Story,"" ""Junior Rodeo Daredevils,"" ""Body Care & Grooming,"" ""Cheating,"" ""A Date With Your Family,"" ""Why Study Industrial Arts?"" and ""The Chicken of Tomorrow,"" many of which were better than the features they preceded. It's the Bergmanesque gloom of ""Cheating"" and the savage mockery of vocational training in ""Industrial Arts"" that stand out for me, but your golden moments may differ.",1455580800,29,2584,5.231884057971015
795745,5,630414069X,"This may sound odd, but hear me out! As a MST3K collection, I think it's pretty terrible, however, Outlaw of Gor is my favorite Mike episode, and that's really the only reason why I bought it, but all that aside let's look at the facts. First off, there is only one Joel episode on here! What the heck is that about?? And second, two of of the three Mike episodes are ones featuring Pearl, Bobo, and Brain Guy, who I personally feel ruined the show. Oh, and don't let me forget, the replacement for Crow even isn't good...at all really. I just was never satisfied with the later seasons after Dr. Forester left. The writing went down hill, the characters were nowhere near as loveable as they were when Joel was on the show, or even early episodes with Mike. But again, I love Outlaw of Gor so it was totally worth it to get two crappy episodes with it. And before I rant to much, the Joel episode on here is really funny. I shouldn't overlook that. So there is that as an other reason to get this. And this is just my opinion, you might like the later seasons. If so, check it out. But if you're like me, it's still worth it to get it for Outlaw.",1455321600,,1147,4.218181818181818

795856,5,630414069X,"""Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Turkey Day Collection"" is another set of MST3K episodes from both the Joel and Mike eras in a nice collector's tin. The riffing is universally excellent in the collection, though the underlying movies are not on my MST3K A-List. ""Jungle Goddess"" is a turgidly paced George Reeves vehicle about two pilots searching for an heiress in an African jungle. Adventure abounds (not really) as does stock footage as the deadly but formulaic love story plays out. This is an early installation that also features a short from the ultra-slow ""Phantom Creeps"" serial with Bela Lugosi: to say this isn't among Lugosi's better work is something of an understatement. I found this to be one of the less enjoyable episodes overall as despite the excellent work from Joel and the Bots the film just creeps along.

Ascending slowly up the boring meter brings us to ""The Painted Hills"", starring Lassie who is on the trail of a murderer. I'm no fan of westerns, but Joel and the guys do well with this occasionally emotionally-manipulative tear-jerking canine action adventure full of double-crosses and a dog-poisoning evildoer, as well as a child as determined and resourceful as the dog. The host segments are strong, and the riffing is great even though the movie is fairly slow: the accompanying short ""Body Care and Grooming"" perhaps inspires the best segment, when there is a fierce debate about which version of the girl is hotter, the sloppy or neat version: Crow is especially insightful, as always. I enjoyed this episode in spite of itself.

""The Screaming Skull"" is a rehash of other movies done better elsewhere with much bigger budgets, better actors, and more talented directors (including Hitchcock). Let's just say that the second wife of a man is driven crazy after the mysterious death of the first wife. I bet nobody can see the common element there. Despite it being a cheesy imitator of other films, it has some memorable points and makes an ideal canvas for Mike and the Bots to paint on. Served with a disturbing Gumby short, ""Robot Rumpus"", ""The Screaming Skull"" is a very satisfying dose of MST3K.

Last, and in my opinion, best in this collection is ""Squirm"", a killer worm movie filmed in Georgia. I had seen ""Squirm"" years before MST3K got around to doing it, and had always thought it would be a natural fit for the show. So it turned out to be: Mike and the Bots absolutely skewer the production and its eccentric cast. (""A pencil with hair! Oh, no, its her."") This film is actually a bit gross in spots, but pays off with big laughs. Of all the episodes in this collection, ""Squirm"" is my easy favorite, not only because of the central film but because of one of the greatest shorts in the history of MST3K, the otherworldly ""A Case of Spring Fever"" (with Coily, the Spring Sprite!) I have never understood this short, why it was made, or who made it. The Spring Council? The Society For the Advancement of Springs? Who? Whatever the motivation of the producers, this short is worth the price of the set by itself as our hero, Gilbert, learns why springs are important and then can't stop talking about it for the rest of his life. This is a great short subject and is sublimely handled by the MST3K crew. Absolutely magical.

Though the set doesn't have my favorite assortment of episodes, Shout Factory added a lot of great features including Turkey Day introductions with Joel Hodgson, trailers, and perhaps my favorite, an interview with ""Squirm"" star Don Scardino. If you like cheesy movies this is a good set.",1441152000,4,3565,4.773095623987034

sense of humor I guess.
I already have this movie (the original) and love it.
The MST3K version is poorer quality (film quality that is) and has a lot cut out of it.
Even so, it was enjoyable, but not my favorite. But for the cost (yes it's just one movie versus the usual four), it
is well worth the price.
My only general complaint about the MST3K ""guys"" is that I wish they had realized that fans with conservative political views
also watch their shows and had just omitted a few of their personal ""digs"" at the ""right"", especially at the right here in Minnesota.
But as most of conservatives do, I just ignore it and move on.

(Everyone's 'funny bone' is in a different place - and this is my reaction - of course)
So - if you like my review and it helps you - Great. - And if you Don't - just go write your own review - and leave me Alone! (Thanks)

Jungle Goddess (B&W); (Joel, Kevin & Trace)
Starts with a segment of a Bella Lugosi 'part' of a movie. Only one riff I liked - Joel commenting about 'ruthless comedy club owners'.
(my rating for this segment is only a 1)
The movie itself stars George Reeves (of The Adventures of Superman fame) - yet very little riffing about that (perhaps 3-4 comments).
I only had a few chuckles here and there. (My rating - scale of 1 to 10) Rating 3

The Painted Hills (color); (Joel, Kevin & Trace)
*Short 'Body Care and Grooming' (B&W) (there was another Hygiene MST short about kids that was Much better). Rating 3
(Movie) a Very bleak story - and 'dark' in topic. - Even the ending is Not uplifting.
I Didn't like the 1st 'Sausages' riff - but heard it like Anther 20 times.
At one point - it looks like the actual dog - was thrown like 10 feet - for the effect of the story. - I'm Not cool with Any animal abuse - even if it was 50 years ago. Rating 4

The Screaming Skull (B&W): (Mike, Kevin & Bill) (and Unfortunately Maryjo/Pearl. I Don't like her)
*Extra bonus, 'Gumby & Clokey' (color) - a Great historical presentation - by the son of the creator of Gumby!! Rating 9!!
*Short, - Gumby 'Robot Rumpus' (color) I LOVE it!! Rating 8 1/2
(Movie) on the DVD case it says '1940' - yet some riffing says 1953, 1958.
One character is 'Mickey' - yet Not one 'Mickey Mouse' riff. He gets slapped across the ear - yet they missed a Mr. Gower/Wonderful Life riff. The riffing picked up towards the end - and I had some good laughs.
It's a movie about Severe betrayal - and I Didn't enjoy that.
One of that last riffs as the movie ended - was about The Doors, - and I Love when they do that!! Rating 5 1/2

Squirm (color): (Mike, Trace & Bill) (and Unfortunately Maryjo/Pearl. I Don't like her)
Short 'A Case of Spring Fever' (B&W) ""No Springs!!"" : ) I really enjoy the 'hokeyness' and nostalgia of this short! Rating 7
(Movie) At 48:44 minutes - a Great riff about 'Okay if I come along too?'. : )
This actor looked like a young David Letterman - yet (again) Not one riff or mention about him.
For some of the movie he wore a Howdy Doody like shirt - only one mention/riff of that.
A horror/scifi movie about 'Worms' - yet Not one riff about 'the early bird gets the worm'.
I had a few laughs - but kind of a standard MST3K. Rating 4

My overall rating of this set - was just under average - but then I factored in the shorts and that bonus Gumby documentary - and upped it a bit. Rating 5 1/2

Don't get me wrong - I LOVE MST3K - I just give my reactions and opinions to This particular set. Thanks, Scott M.",1429056000,,3046,4.119528619528619

796400,4,630414069X,"I didn't have the Comedy Central channel on my cable system until after ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" had their annual Thanksgiving Day marathons, so my fond memories of the show don't include watching it on Thanksgiving.  The bonus features included in this volume regarding the marathons were lengthy and very informative, especially ""Undercooked & Overstuffed: Inside The Turkey Day Marathon,"" and ""Bumper To Bumper: Turkey Day Through The Years.""  In addition, the collectible tin the special edition comes in is one of the best ones ever released.

""Jungle Goddess"" is a movie that would never be made now, because of its stereotypical depiction of African natives.  Other than starring George Reeves, who played Superman on television, it was a pretty standard jungle movie.  Fortunately, the blonde playing the jungle goddess was hot!  ""The Screaming Skull"" is my favorite film in this volume.  The suspense in the film built very slowly, but was greatly aided by the constant movie riffing.  It had all of the typical horror movie clichs: the rich wife with severe psychological problems, her heel of a husband who only wanted her money, and the creepy gardener who went to the Torgo school of acting.

As Joel said in his turkey day introduction, ""Squirm"" is just like ""Jurassic Park,"" except that the low budget movie is set in the deep South instead of on an island, and features crazed earthworms instead of dinosaurs.  It's a creepy creature feature, made palatable (and laughable) by the riffing.  The only reason I didn't give this volume five stars is because of ""The Painted Hills.""  Starring Lassie playing a collie named Shep, it's a tale of gold prospecting, greed and murder.  That maudlin movie doesn't fall into the general MST3K categories of horror, science fiction or fantasy.  The film is unwatchable, even with the humorous riffing.  Despite that, this volume of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" is well worth buying for all Misties.",1418515200,9,1960,5.08125

The Black Scorpion: Joel, Trace & J. Elvis. Black & White - from season one.
Somehow - I like the movie and 'riffs'. Some good riffs here and there. Rating 4. (scale of 1 to 10)

Outlaw of Gor: (show #519), Mike, Kevin & Trace. Color.
Jack Palance stars in this movie. For me - the movie and riffs fall flat - except one about 'mountains following them'.
I just couldn't watch this film again. Rating 1

The Projected Man: Mike, Kevin, Bill & Mary Jo (who I just don't like). Color.
(I don't like to say this - but) - Some of these movies are a chore to watch. - This is one of them.
Rating 1

It Lives By Night: Mike, Kevin, Bill & Mary Jo. Color.
Not obvious by the title - a man gets bitten by a Bat and Partially turns into one (at times).
The Guys/Gang completely miss some opportune moments for some 'Where's Waldo' riffs - And
Not one 'Batman' riff/reference (how'd they miss that?!) I laughed once - but forget at what.

203- JUNGLE GODDESS with short: THE PHANTOM CREEPS PT 1
This is a 1948 black-and-white film starring George Reeves who is famous for playing Superman on 1950s television. It was produced by Robert Lippert who also produced King Dinosaur, Lost Continent so you know you're in for both a terrible movie and a great episode of MST3K. A plane carrying a millionaire's daughter has crashed in an African jungle and two fortune seeking pilots set out to find her and collect the reward. The pilots find her and discover in a groan-worthy plot twist that she has become the goddess of a local primitive tribe. Escape becomes problematic because the tribe's witch doctor is not a fan of the meddling outsiders. This episode is full of terrific riffing fodder and inspired some excellent host segments making fun of it too as two ""white devils"" visit the SOL via the Hexfield view screen and Joel and the 'Bots perform ""My White Goddess"". The phrase ""I could really go for a nice hamburger and some French fried potatoes"" comes from this film and would get many call-back in episodes to come. This is another seminal Season 2 episode that helped define the show. It also includes the first of several Phantom Creeps episodes used on MST3K and that also became a big part of the show's internal identity with several distinctive elements including Bela Lugosi, a huge and odd looking robot costume, exploding ""spiders"", an invisibility device and an assortment of oddly amusing characters. Also note that in a host segment parodying the Jackie Gleason show Joel introduces the cast and refers to Crow as ""Art Crow"" as if he was Art Carney. Some small child thought Crow's name was really ""Art"" and labeled him that way in a drawing he sent into the show which was read on the air in a future episode. It's why Crow is sometimes called ""Art"" in sketches on the show years later. This is a MSTie must-see episode.

510- THE PAINTED HILLS with short: BODY CARE AND GROOMING
Lassie plays ""Shep"" in this 1951 film about gold prospectors, greed and betrayal. Don't expect the quality of Treasure Of The Sierra Madre here when it comes to script, story or acting, after all the main character is a dog. There's the obligatory Lassie film child character as well. Lassie is way smarter than the humans in the film and does all the work when it comes to crime solving. It's a dreary and maudlin film that won't leave you feeling good about anything when it's over except that MST3K gives it a good riffing. The Body Care And Grooming short is more entertaining than the feature film and Crow and Tom debate about the messy woman in the short in a great little host segment. It's a fun little episode with an unusual choice of film.

912- THE SCREAMING SKULL with short: ROBOT RUMPUS
A newlywed wife sees skulls everywhere in this 1958 thriller. It's less thrilling than the genre name implies. The new wife has a history of mental illness and her husband's first wife died under mysterious circumstances. Suspicion falls on the simple-minded gardener. The actor playing the gardener is also the director of the film. Could the plot be more hackneyed or the outcome of this mystery be more obvious? You won't be surprised or thrilled, but it is a fun episode of MST3K. The Gumby short was the first short used on a Sci-Fi Channel episode of the show and it's much more exciting than the feature film. A rerun of this episode was the last broadcast of MST3K on Sci-Fi Channel, January 31, 2004. Highlights include a host segment with Crow disguised as a screaming skull.

1012- SQUIRM with short: A CASE OF SPRING FEVER
This is a 1976 horror film about earthworms driven to the surface and into a human-eating frenzy by some downed power lines. It's that implausible and that simple. It's actually an entertaining little film for its type with some decent performances by not-so-well-known actors. Being a bit more recent than many of the horror films used on MST3K it's quite a bit more gross than most films used on the show and it was rated R, though cuts are made for the sake of the show especially since the film runs 92 minutes on its own. More remarkable is the short, A Case Of Spring Fever which is the stuff of nightmares and you'll be hearing ""no springs!"" in your head for years to come after seeing it. It's goofy fun that is perfect for MST3K and one of the highlights of Season 10. Host segments in this episode were inspired by both the short and the feature film. A fun episode from the final season of MST3K.

796764,5,630414069X,"I never get tired of old MST3K DVD releases, and I'm pleased that so many seem to feel the same way.  The collection of episodes from various seasons (ranging from the last episode of season 1, to one of the last episodes from season 10) doesn't make much sense to the uninitiated.

But MSTies, as they are called, are always welcoming to those new to the club and are happy to explain that complex rights issues prevent coherent releases.  Rhino, and later Shout Factory, collect 4 episodes (called ""experiments"") and release them about twice a year. Grab 'em if you want them sooner rather than later, because things happen and you never know if/when these will go out of print.

They come with slimline cases, posters, and many experiments have nice extras including cast interviews and sometimes comments from the filmmakers themselves (those that are good sports, anyway.)

So some words about the particular experiments:

113 - The Black Scorpion.  No TV's Frank, we have the most excellent J. Elvis Weinstiein as Dr. Eckhardt and a surprisingly deep-voiced Tom Servo.  The shadow-rama (silhouettes) have an odd green tinge we don't see in later years, but the writing and execution foreshadow the excellent seasons that were to follow.  This experiment has to do with maneating ginormous scorpions released by volcanic activity (!!!).

519 - Outlaws is a Jack Palance vehicle of the John Norman ""Gor"" series.  It's awful, so let's focus on what is unusual about this experiment.  It is an early Mike episode, and there is a rare invention exchange.  The opus ""Tubular Boobular Joy"" is in this experiment.  And ""buffalo shots"" (don't ask, you probably don't want to know).

901- Projected Man - this is about a matter-transfer experiment that leaves a scientist with a lethal touch.  It is the first of season 9, and the first featuring Pearl in Castle Forrester.  When this experiment was first broadcast, the soundtrack was damaged or bad in some way, leaving Mike and the 'Bots with an ""echoey"" sound during their riffing.  This was cleaned up in later broadcasts, and this DVD has the corrected sound.  Sadly, season 9 was rather short with only 13 episodes, but this was one of the better ones.

1010-  What lives by night?  Bats of course, and we got a guy turning into one. Host segments are very funny as Mike and the 'Bots take ill-fated steps towards business ownership and entrepreneurism.  They fail of course. This episode was one of the last, and was repeated several times by the Sci Fi Channel.  One of the better experiments.",1407542400,13,2548,4.844907407407407
796765,5,630414069X,"MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 VOL 31 episodes have been announced. Its Turkey Day Special Edition part two, with a free collector's tin. Unlike Volume XVI, which has the famous 1995 Thanksgiving feast in Deep 13, with Mr. B Natural, Pitch, Kitten with a whip, etc, the only reason why these four episodes were chosen for this Thanksgiving edition, was they are ""all turkeys"". (Puny... Humph)  Overall, SHOUT! is back to their normal formula of two Joel experiments, and two Mike.

JUNGLE GODDESS (with Phantom Creeps Pt. 1)  EPISODE 203
We start out with the beginning of the PHANTOM CREEPS serial, staring Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist. Since parts 2 and 3 have already been released on VOLs 27 and 11, its nice to have the whole story.  In the prologue, Joel and the Bots play hide and seek with the universal mystery of Oneness. The invention exchange has Joel inventing a remote control saw, so if you mess up, you're not in danger.  The Mads chop off Frank's head, and fuse it with a saxophone.  We are also treated to a SOL Infomercial for a phantom creep that can blow up anything, a cinematic effects lesson by Joel concerning the matte effect for a binocular, and finally the two pilots from the film show up on the view screen. The movie itself, is a typical 1948 B&W low budget affair, staring George Reeves (TV's SUPERMAN).  A plane carrying an heiress crashes in the jungle. Two pilots (Bob and Mike) are dispatched to search for Greta, and when they find her, she's become the jungle queen for a bunch of primitive natives. Random, but it apparently happened back then. I don't want to spoil the fascinating complex plot devices, but Jungle Goddess falls in love with one of the pilots, and the two return to the USA. The other pilot stays behind, due to a backache caused by ""spear-in-spine"" syndrome.  Overall, an early season two episode, very funny,  that has Tom Servo still figuring out how he sounds and moves. Since the Godzilla pictures will never be available due to copyright restrictions, that means Season two is complete with the release of this episode.

THE PAINTED HILLS (with short ""Body Care and Grooming"") EPISODE 510
This short was previously released with RHINO MST3K box set VOL. 2, on the SHORTS  Vol. 1 DVD.  Its popular and well liked, and if you're obsessive compulsive, you'll like it too. The skits on this show are great as well, with the TONIGHT SHOW parody that has Crow impersonating Jay Leno a favorite of mine.  Joel's invention is a subliminal memo machine, while Dr. F uses the cholesterol from Franks heart, to run a generator. (Green Energy--very hip.) The lovable femme fatale GYPSY moderates a debate concerning which girl in the short looks nicer, the sloppy version, or the clean and neat version.  Crow's insights into this are hysterical. The other skits include Crow being turned into an ingot of gold (Tom has GOLD FEVER!), term papers get written about the old miner in the movie, and canine vigilante justice is examined--pros and cons. The movie is hokey, and way out of the norm for MST3K.  Its a LASSIE movie from 1951, the seventh and last of the series.  An old miner 49er strikes GOLD! on the widow Martha's land.  A friend of Martha's late husband offers to help dig it out, but kills the old miner 49er out of greed. The miner's best friend, LASSIE, and widow Martha's young son Tommy exact revenge. I've always noticed that the more bizarre the movie, the better the riffing. And for me, Joel and the BEST BRAIN crew were consistently spot on at this point in the series.  Even tho I hate westerns, this episode rocks.

THE SCREAMING SKULL (with short ""Robot Rumpus"") EPISODE 912
Here we are in the SCIFI years, at Castle Forester with Pearl, Bobo and Brain Guy. The opening involves Tom Servo's metamorphosis into a ""Beautiful Butterfly"" (and butterflies are free to fly, fly away, bye bye). Meanwhile, the Castle Forester crew dance around in Penguin costumes, attempting to degrade the SOL trio. It backfires, naturally. Other skits involve two clay blobs in a mini puppet show that parodies the Gumby short, I love the next comedic interlude, which has Tom Servo attempting to scam a telephone operator for the free coffin advertised at the beginning of the movie. (As a promotional gimmick, when SCREAMING SKULL was released, they promised a free funeral if you died of fright during the film.) We also see CROW as a disembodied skull, that terrified Mike.  The short is a Gumby cartoon, that was a popular Claymation character back in the 1960s-70s.  Since it involves robots, Tom and Crow understandably identify with their fates.  As for the movie, its a low budget crime drama from 1958 staring John Hudson.  SCREAMING SKULL is a blatant copy of Hitchcock's REBECCA. You have two newlyweds, Jenny and Eric. Eric's first wife, Marion, died under mysterious circumstances.  Since Jenny is filthy rich, and has a psychiatric history, Eric attempts to scare her to death by showing her a --get ready for it--a screaming skull. (thus the skit with the Crow skull scaring Mike.)  The movie is typical melodrama for the period.  As far as MST3K episodes go, its middling. Personally, I'd have rather SHOUT released ""Space Children"" from season 9, but no doubt they shall in the fullness of time.

SQUIRM (with short ""A Case of Spring Fever"") EPISODE 1012
The opening involves a safety check on the SOL. Castle Forester meanwhile, is hosting ""THE FAIR"", a diabolical plot to take over all the county and state fairs all over the world. Crow wants to enter his 5000 pound pig to the livestock competition. Other skits involve a satanic sprite that grants the wish of the Bots, causing Mike to disappear.  Another one has Tom turning into a Southern Belle, complete with 1862 green velvet gown. In another, Mike electrocutes a worm in an attempt to create a mutant like in the movie.  As for the episode content, the short is pretty odd. A sprite that looks like a spring makes all the springs in the world disappear. Chairs sag, watches don't run, and other apocalyptic disasters occur from ""NO SPRINGS"".  The movie is a gross out classic from 1976 (and in color). SQUIRM used to be played on TBS all the time late at night during the early 80s. The MST3K version has been edited for content, ie all the really gross stuff was removed.  The film's setup involved a bad storm that knocked down power lines, which fell on watery mud. This electrocutes the worms in the mud, transforming them into monsters. What else? So the bloodthirsty worms invade a little Georgian backwater town, burrowing into the skin of the townspeople to kill them.  The townspeople run around, looking for ways to prevent the monster worms from turning them into a human mulch pile.  This is the next to last episode for MST3K,  Even tho I notice the delivery tended to become a bit formulistic by this point, the episode is solid, and consistently funny.  After all, what's NOT funny about Killer Worms?

Overall, another fun-tastic box set of MST3K classics. Even tho we are getting a collector's tin, I honestly cant rate this box set as high as the GAMERA box, or the excellent 25th anniversary box, with the bonus episodes. For fans new to the series, I wouldn't recommend this as a first purchase.  Even tho every episode is strong, I'd be hard pressed to refer to any of them as all time fan favorites. When you buy every box set, you accept what they release. When SHOUT announces the Bonus Features, I'll tag it onto this review.",1407456000,79,7485,4.721198156682028

796912,5,630414069X,"This set features one episode hosted by show creator Joel Hodgson and three hosted by show head writer Mike Nelson. It spans a wide range of the show's history including episodes from seasons one, five, nine and ten. Two episodes are from the Comedy Channel/Comedy Central era of the show and two are from the Sci Fi Channel years. The variety is good enough here to have something for every MST3K fan.

113- The Black Scorpion
This fun little 1957 black-and-white monster film features the stop motion animation of King Kong creator Willis O'Brien. An earthquake releases monstrous sized scorpions on New Mexico and it's up to a heroic few to stop them. The main character, Hank Scott, is played by Richard Denning who went on to play ""Governor"" on Hawaii Five-0. The story is a bit dull, but the monster sequences are entertaining. Host segments feature one where the 'Bots put on a puppet show and another where Gypsy is a giant scorpion. The 'Bots also discuss stop motion animation with Joel. This is the final episode of MST3K season one and with this all of season one will have been released on DVD. This was also Josh Weinstein's last episode.

519- Outlaw (Of Gor)
This 1988 sequel to Gor stars no one of note except inexplicably, Jack Palance. The movie is based on the series of Gor sword-and-sorcery novels by John Norman which one could say are inspired in their main concept by the John Carter of Mars novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs to say the least. An Earth man finds him transported to another planet where he becomes a sword wielding hero that must rescue a princess and such. If it sounds familiar it definitely is and this Gor book film adaptation is not nearly as good as the sadly overlooked adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's John Carter from 2012. Nevertheless the Gor series of books have a huge following so it's no surprise that a movie or two got made from them, though not particularly good ones. A huge amount of the dialog in Outlaw Of Gor seems to involve people shouting the name of the hero, Cabot, dozens of times. The film is surprisingly entertaining though because it is at least not slow and the poor script quality, mostly mediocre acting, colorful sets, and numerous action scenes do add up to amusing fare. Costumes are exceedingly scanty for both male and female actors which inspired one of the funniest MST3K host segments ever, the musical number ""Toobular Boobular Joy"". This really is a must-see and must-have episode for all MST3K fans.

901-The Projected Man
This 1966 British color film is about a scientist who tests a matter transmitter on himself. The experiment goes horribly wrong and turns him into a mutant that can kill with a touch. The movie is relatively dry and unexciting and there's certainly nothing new even at the time about the premise of a scientist experimenting on himself and accidentally becoming a lethal monster in the process. The film is passably entertaining, but nothing more. This episode introduces Castle Forrester in the host segments. In another host segment Crow acquires a death touch like the guy in the movie.

1010- It Lives By Night
This 1974 color film also goes by the title, The Bat People. A doctor gets bitten by a bat in a cave and slowly transforms into a bat creature. This turns out to be bad for his marriage and other aspects of his life. The only noteworthy cast member is Michael Pataki, who played J.C. in another MST3K film, Sidehackers (Five The Hard Way). Pataki was also in The Trouble With Tribbles episode of the original Star Trek and in one episode of the Star Trek: The Next Generation. He's one of those talented actors fans find in both really good productions and in some terribly bad ones, which brings us back to It Lives By Night. It's a slightly different twist on the the endlessly remade vampire and werewolf premises and it seems to be an odd mix of the two. Why does being bitten by a bat turn a man into one? People do get bitten by bats occasionally and that does not happen! The movie is short on explanations and it's hampered by its low budget. Host segments include MIke and the 'Bots testing out new mustaches.

Extra features include:
- Stinger Of Death: Making The Black Scorpion
- Writer Of Gor: The Novels Of John Norman
- Director Of Gor: On Set With John ""Bud"" Cardos
- Producer Of Gor: Adventures With Harry Alan Towers
- Shock To The System: Creating The Projected Man

Factory for providing genre movie lovers with terrific Blu Ray packages, providing hours of popcorn and TAB diet soda fun. -- The MST3K riff on 'This Island Earth', a feature length offering from the comedy group, originally hit theaters in the summer of 1996.  It is arguably one of the top ten efforts of MST.  Part of the reason for this is that This Island Earth is actually a pretty good movie, offering special effects and ideas a little far beyond what the 1950s scifi movie usually offered.  It isn't great, but it isn't Castle of Fu Manchu or the German version of Hamlet.  Mike and Kevin and Trace provide the 'horror movie host' jokes and the movie itself (This Island Earth is edited pretty heavily) breezes along at under an hour and a half.  And boy is it funny.  Seeing this movie through the eyes of Mike and the bots, it's easy to pick apart the kind of cheap trappings of this movie.  But in a weird way, it also helps you to appreciate what charms it has to offer.  It's been said before and I'll say it again ... watching a B-rate scifi movie with the gang of MST is like watching a B-rate scifi movie with your funnier and smarter friends.  And in the awfully capable hands of the folks at Shout!, this offering can't be anything less than a dream come true for fans of both MST and the monster movies of the 50s.  It isn't out yet ... we must wait another month.  But is there any doubt that our anticipation won't be satisfied and then some?  Of course not.  So Join Us.",1375660800,4,1624,4.26797385620915

Trust me. This Island Earth is far from perfect. First of all, Cal, our hero, goes on a mind-binding journey across the universe-and yet he returns utterly unchanged in any way. Secondly, Cal is supposed to be the hero, but his most heroic act is to yell ""Run, Ruth, run!"" at one point.

797362,5,630414069X,"For some reason, this was impossible to find for awhile on DVD.  That's too bad, because it is absolutely hilarious.  For those of you who did not see the great TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000 or don't know anything about it, this is the perfect introduction to it.  The backstory to the show is there is a guy who got shot into space by evil scientists on the satellite of love.  As part of their dasterdly plan to take over the world, they subject Joel Hodgeson, and later Mike Nelson, to watch horrible grade z movies.  During the movie, Joel/Mike, along with their robot friends Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo, skewer these cinematic stinkers with running commentary.  The view you see is as if you were sitting behind them in a movie theater.  The show is interspersed with cuts of stupid little skits that are a lot of fun.  This was released in movie theaters and rips apart Universal Pictures' This Island Earth.  Unlike a lot of the normal MST3K fare, This Island Earth actually begins to break through into the recognizable as many people with a passing knowledge of science fiction will recognize the aliens at the end.  MST3K The Movie is, in my opinion, a little funnier than the TV show and a lot more accessible to the general public in its humor.  The TV show had thousands of very clever pop-culture references and sometimes lesser-known people and events, giving it a kind-of intimate atmosphere if you got a lot of the humor.  Most of the humor is subtle, but incredibly funny.  MST3K the movie has more jokes of a general nature that are sidesplitting from start to finish.

The key problem with MST3K was that, due to the budget of the show, they could not skewer bigger budget stinkers like Star Trek V, Highlander 2, etc as they were prohibitively expensive to license.  If you like MST3K, check out Cinematic Titanic and Riff Trax on the net, the next project Joel and Mike have taken on.  The idea is the same, dumping on stupid films, but now they take on the likes of Star Wars I, Harry Potter, Die Hard, Avatar and Twilight to name only a few.

797458,3,630414069X,"Some bad movies are so bad they are funny; most bad movies, however, are simply bad, and in order to be funny they need a little help.  Debuting on television in 1988 and running for eleven years, MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 did precisely that.

The premise was wacky.  An average Joe--originally played by series creator Joel Hodgson, later by series writer Michael J. Nelson--is trapped on a wayward satelite by a mad scientist who is convinced he can dominate the world through bad movies.  The series episodes ran in a two hour slot, the time divided between the necessary evil of commercials; broad-farce sketches between the victim, his robot friends, and the mad scientist; and of course the movie the mad scientist forces them to watch--and which they wildly ridicule in order to maintain their sanity.  Over the years MST3K took a crack at some of the worst movies ever made, including the infamous MANOS: HANDS OF FATE, and somewhere along the way someone decided it would a great idea to put it on the big screen.  The result was MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000: THE MOVIE.

The creative team behind the series complained that the film's backers butchered the concept.  Although MSTK3 made its reputation by ridiculing bad films, the backers didn't believe an audience would pay to sit through a bad film--and so the film elected to ridicule was actually a classic of the science fiction genre: the 1955 THIS ISLAND EARTH.  Filmed in Technicolor with state of the art effects that are still a lot of fun today, it is far from being a ""stinkburger,"" and not only did its use here annoy film critics and historians, it simply didn't give Mike and his ""bots"" Tom Servo and Crow the same material a genuinely bad movie would.  Another backer error was the notion that the film couldn't be over seventy-five minutes total, which meant that the THE MOVIE was actually shorter than both THIS ISLAND EARTH and an episode of the series itself.  As if this were not enough, the backers also forced the writers to dilute much of their humor--and to write less of it, lest the audience miss one joke while laughing at another.  To add insult to injury, publicity, marketing strategy, and distribution was a disaster.  Most fans didn't know the movie was in release until after it had left town.

Even so, and while I personally don't feel it equals the best of the television series, MSTK3: THE MOVIE has enough going for it to be an enjoyable break-in for new-comers and a pleasure for old fans.  The few moments of set-up sketches work very well, most particularly the moment when Mike wrecks the Satelite of Love by running into the Hubble Telescope; the real fun though, and as always, comes around when Mike and bots Tom Servo and Crow offer jeers and jibes to the film they are forced to watch--and even though THIS ISLAND EARTH is actually a good movie, the writers still manage to find a lot of laughs.  Not a first rate example of the silly fun that made MSTK3 famous, but enjoyable nonetheless.

GFT, Amazon Reviewer",1283904000,4,3023,4.705882352941177
797459,5,630414069X,"""Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie"" -- it sounds very grand and impressive, doesn't it? But except for a couple of extra sets, the movie version of this snarky little series is pretty much the same as the episodes -- a painfully bad movie that Mike Nelson and his sarcastic robot pals relentlessly mock.

As explained by evil Dr. Forrester (""I'm a NAUGHTY BOY!""), he has trapped Mike on the Satellite of Love, and is plying him with terrible movies to see what breaks him. This is apparently part of his evil plan to conquer the world.

Meanwhile on the Satellite of Love, everything is pretty much normal -- Gypsy is running the ship, Mike is running on a giant hamster wheel (complete with water bottle!) and Crow is trying to tunnel back to Earth. After a near-fatal hull breach (""Mommy mommy mommy I LOVE YOU, MAAAAAAAAAAAA...""), the guys are called in to watch their latest movie.

Unfortunately, that movie is ""This Island Earth,"" a pretentious sci-fi flick that was apparently made up as they went along. A bunch of rather dumb scientists are called by a secret organization of suspiciously large-skulled people who are obviously aliens. Immediately the rugged Carl Meecham decides to break out of the place (you volunteered to go, idiot) along with his required love interest -- and soon they find themselves whisked onto a flying saucer and headed for the planet Metaluna. Of course, things go downhill after that.

Despite the ""The Movie"" tag, this movie is basically just a slightly expanded episode of the series. The guys get to be a little cruder in their language, and we see a couple more rooms on the Satellite of Love when Mike and the robots try to hail Earth using a hokey-looking communicator. Of course, it all goes horribly wrong.

But most of the movie revolves around the guys sitting around making fun of the movie -- Mike, Tom Servo and Crow all mock the special effects (""So they worship the ever-lasting gobstopper?"") the silly plot developments (""That's what happens when you leave a potato in the microwave!"") and the ridiculous costumes (""It's Ted Kennedy in a Barney suit!""). Not to mention the obviousness of the aliens' identities (""I ram my ovipositor down your throat, and lay my eggs in your chest! But I'm NOT an alien!"").

The movie itself is a pretty awful affair, despite the then-impressive special effects and attempts at depth. It's got some really wooden acting, an interstellar trip that turns out to be totally pointless, some heavy-handed anti-war preaching, and a hokey alien species -- with the required benevolent alien who inexplicably cares about our species, but not his own (he doesn't seem very upset about his entire species being wiped out, as long as the all-American heroes get to go home).

Despite the title, ""Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie"" is basically just another episode of the series, albeit a bit glossier than most -- funny, snarky and full of wretched movie.",1277337600,,2945,4.854581673306773

I really liked it, but missed all of the inside jokes that Mike and the bots typically use.  Don't get me wrong, there were parts that were hysterical, but the host segments were mediocre at best, and the movie that they were subjected to wasn't that bad.  I also hoped that since it was on DVD there might have been some special features, but nothing; just a subtitles option.  That is why I gave it the 3 star rating.

The film version of Mystery Science Theater 3000 has some great lines and can produce gales of laughter, but the scenes on the Satellite of Love are boring and never funny and the movie starts feeling a bit long even at under 80 minutes; if you're a fan of the show check it out but expect a bit of an uneven performance from everyone's favorite wisecracking movie-watchers.

797556,4,630414069X,"Hello.  Since I am a true MST3K fan I am not going to describe the movie, This Island Earth.  It is a well-known movie and their are plenty of descriptions available on the internet.

Rather, I would like to focus on the MST3K production itself.  This is definitely an enjoyable MST3K production as are most, if not all, of their productions.

As a fan, there are some things that I would have changed but I think that the MST3K people were trying to appeal to a wide audience and draw in other people that might not have been as familiar with the show as the fans are familiar.

Any MST3K fan will tell you that the show on TV wasn't long enough.  Bear in mind, that we are talking about a show that filled a 2-hr time slot.  So, that is probably my biggest complaint with this big screen production.  The whole thing, including credits is something like 70-75 minutes long.  They should have included a short or additional breaks with skits.

I am also sad that TV's Frank did not make an appearance.  I know he left the show right around that time but it would have been nice if he stuck around just to be in this movie.  I was also a little disappointed that familiar MST3K personnel like Paul Chaplin, Bridget Jones and Mary Jo Pehl did not make appearances in skits like they typically do on the TV shows.

It is a shame that this movie didn't do very well in the theaters but I think that is largely due to the promotion of it.  They certainly could have promoted it more but I think the movie should have been treated like a new Rocky Horror Picture Show complete with audience participation.

As far as this specific release is concerned the picture quality is clear.  There is nothing wrong with this release.  The widescreen format is much better than previous commercial releases of this movie.  I only wish that they would have included some bonus features.

In closing, if you are a fan of this stuff like I am you will definitely enjoy this experiment.  It is certainly worth getting, watching and having.",1243814400,,2020,4.449591280653951

797558,4,630414069X,"Filmed at Energy Park Studios in St. Paul, Minnesota, this Mystery Science Theater 3000 big screen adaptation of 1955's ""This Island Earth"" will tickle the fancy of any aficionado of the show, fan of science fiction, or lover of comedy. The plotline is essentially unchanged from the brilliant TV show, although sets are more extensive and costly. In this iteration Dr. Forrester (Trace Beaulieu) taunts his test subjects Mike Nelson, Crow T. Robot (also Trace Beaulieu), and Tom Servo (Kevin Murphy) with the classic sci-fi film about atomic power, aliens with giant foreheads, and huge mutant insects, in an effort to break their wills, an effort that, predictably, fails.

""This Island Earth"" follows Dr. Cal Meacham (Rex Reason) and Dr. Ruth Adams (Faith Domergue) as they journey to the planet of Metaluna with giant foreheaded Exeter (Jeff Morrow,) who is on a mission to save his home planet from destruction by meteors. The Metalunans are much advanced over humans, but need the help of Meacham and Adams for purposes of obtaining uranium to shield their planet from destruction. The thing that's most interesting about this film is that they spend a whopping total of about five minutes on Metaluna before Exeter, Meacham, and Adams start back toward Earth. It's like they go to the planet, tell the ruler ""no, we won't help you"" and promptly leave. All this makes for a movie with a very short running time and even with the MST3K host segments the final product is only 74 minutes long, which is a bit of a disappointment considering the original unedited version of ""This Island Earth"" is 87 minutes long.

The choice of material was controversial both within the MST3K camp and with fans. The film was readily and cheaply available, but was viewed by many as not as strong a choice as could have been made as ""This Island Earth"" is viewed by many sci-fi historians and fans as a classic of the genre and something of a good movie. Certainly the film is not among the worst that MST3K has skewered (""Monster a Go-Go"" anyone?) and as a result the riffing is weaker than a normal MST3K episode. Don't get me wrong, there are some great lines from Nelson and company: ""Suddenly I have a refreshing mint flavor."", ""Hey! It's a moth equipped with a lightning bug!"", and my personal favorite exchange after seeing the wacky Metalunan architecture that so resembled dreadful album covers from the 1970's, ""It looks like Dr. Seuss designed their planet....They're really into 'Yes' on this planet.""

While I like the film, this is the first (and likely only) time I can't give five stars to an MST3K production. While good, the riffing and host segments weren't as funny or wry as their best efforts (""Manos,"" ""Hobgoblins,"" ""Mitchell,"" etc.), and the film lost some of it's low budget charm when dressed in the trappings of a Hollywood release. I certainly like the movie and recommend it, but still believe that it could have been so much more than good; with the right movie it could have been great.",1243123200,,3006,4.810444874274662

Personally I'd still like to see a ""special edition"" or ""collector's edition"" with actual special features on it, such as a commentary track from the creators.

Personally, my suggestion (which might just rock everyone's socks off) would be to do an MST3K of MST3K: The Movie. Bring back Joel, and have him, Gypsy and Cambot rag on both the movie AND on Mike, Crow and Tom Servo's commentary. Nobody would see that coming! Well, they will now! Of course they should have just the regular version available too. Double the pleasure, double the fun!

Technically, the DVD looks good, and it's nice to be able to enjoy so many classic MST3K moments. Such as ""Should we be seeing this?"" and ""Shattner, Shattner, nope, he's not in this one, we're safe!"" or the ever-amusing ""Self-cleaning mu-tant, leaves only the fresh scent of pine!""

We loved the campy nature of the series and the truly awful movies they spoofed. Since then we've snapped up every single movie and compilation DVD released. If you're familiar with MST3K, you know there is quite a different vibe between the earlier Joel shows and the later ones after Mike took over the Satillite of Love. I suspect there are seperate camps who adore either Mike or Joel, each group loathing the followers of the other. I find both actors appealing in some ways and off-putting in others. While both can be quite funny, Joel seems to channel Pauly Shore a lot while Mike often acts likes he's on a some secret joke that's way over the heads of the rest of us. MST 3000 - the Movie was the show's first / last big screen effort and clearly the Minneapolis-based gang didn't meld with their Hollywood mentors. The studio's effort to ""professionalize"" the TV show's hokeyness totally missed the point that the series' slapdash approach was a major part of its charm.",1213920000,3,1103,4.604060913705584

798065,4,630414069X,"A quick recap for anyone who is somehow reading this without knowing what Mystery Science Theater 3000 is.  Originally a local television show, it posited a mad scientist wishing to take over the world by shooting a man into space and forcing him to watch the worst movies ever made.  The victim (first Joel, then replaced by Mike who appears in this, the film version of the TV show) can only hold on to his sanity by heckling and mocking the movie with help of two small robots.  They watch the bad movies; we watch them watching the movies.

For a non-insignificant amount of time during my undergrad years, a VHS tape of this was the only copy I had of Mystery Science Theater 3000 content.  As you can imagine, I watched that video quite a few times.  Quite a few times.

So for me watching this DVD release all those years later  is more an exercise in nostalgia than anything else. I can recite most of the riffs from memory.  In my everyday life, when I see an oddly framed item on the wall, I wonder why someone has hung a picture of a burger.  When I see a scattering of cardboard or wooden boxes, I wonder if a guy named Joe is going to have to search for his boss in them.  When I see serious men doing important work, I wonder when they're going to adjust the Flash Gordon noises and put more science stuff around.

The film they chose for mocking was THIS ISLAND EARTH (I had only known it from the short clips they used in that classic 1980s kids sci-fi movie, THE EXPLORERS).  THIS ISLAND EARTH isn't nearly as bad as some of the films they tackled during the TV series run.  For good reason: they figured that being released in the cinemas meant more mainstream eyes would be upon the screen and that perhaps the world wasn't ready for something along the lines of MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE or THE INCREDIBLY STRANGE CREATURES WHO STOPPED LIVING AND BECAME MIXED-UP ZOMBIES.  Regular people may think they've seen bad movies, but, trust me, you need to work up to a viewing of MONSTER A-GO GO or INVASION OF THE NEPTUNE MEN.

But what the film lacks in sheer awfulness it makes up for in pretension.  This is one of those 1950s science-fiction movies that takes itself incredibly seriously.  And if MST3k did one thing extremely well, it was taking the air out of something overbearingly pompous.  The jokes at the expense of the producer's vision are amazingly funny.  There's a reason that most of Mike and the bots' comments are burnt into my brain; they're hilarious.

As far reviewing the DVD-specific content, it turns out that I can't because there isn't any.  By the way, I'm not exaggerating; there really is zero extra content.  I regularly buy DVDs at the Dollar Tree and from the one dollar DVD bin at Wal*Mart, and I have never before seen a DVD that didn't even feature a chapter menu.  The most basic of all DVD features is absent.  It's quite a difference from the DVD sets of the TV episodes which provided us with interviews, bloopers and (occasionally) the original movie as a bonus.  There's nothing like that here.

When I heard that MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000: THE MOVIE was coming to DVD, I put in my pre-order information.  This is a great way to introduce someone to MST3k.  It's not quite as funny as the best that the series had to offer, but it's still pretty good.  And a word of warning to anyone who does make this their initial foray into the world of MST3k -- as Pearl Forrester states during the final broadcast episode: ""The movies are only going to get worse.""",1211587200,,3514,4.462382445141066

Okay, it's not as great as the show, but still it's pure genius. Mike Nelson's pretty funny, as is the 'bots and Dr. Forrester.  There are some pretty funny jokes as well. The movie being watched is the 1955 classic, This Island Earth, which isn't actually a bad movie. It's just that Mike and the 'Bots make it funnier & easier to watch. Now onto the DVD. Just like the previous 1998 Image DVD, there's no extras, but whether there are extras or not, it's still worth the buy. However, I must admit that the widescreen presentation is good too.

The DVD case credits this release to Rogue Pictures, which is maybe a subsidiary of Universal?  I don't know, but I guess the suits, whoever they were, decided to go with the rock bottom basics and keep the price low, rather than jazz it up a bit with some extras and take a chance on a higher MSRP.  I think they were wrong on that bet, because I think the true MSTies among us would have paid $25-$30 or more for a ""deluxe"" edition, based on what people are paying for out-of-print MST3K releases on eBay.  I got the single disc release of Giant Gila Monster and it was great to see and hear the contemporary cast riffing on that.

Nevertheless, those 74 minutes are among the funniest 74 minutes of any comedy film ever made. On that basis -- and on that basis alone -- this disc is worth your time and money.

798150,5,630414069X,"For most of you who remember, MST3K dealt with a guy, some bots, mad scientists, and the worst films ever to hit the cinematic realm.  The series was hilarious because, as one critic pointed out, we all love making odd comments when watching bad films.  Heck, I once did it in 'Star Wars: Episode I.' (Sorry, Lucas, blame the 'bots.)

Thus, the show was a sensation hit for several seasons, even migrating over to the Sci-Fi Channel after Comedy Central plunged them into obscurity.  My favorite episodes are 'Santa Claus Conquers The Martians' (which you can finally locate in 'MST3K: The Essentials') and 'Pod People' (basically due to the fact it's kind of a messed up version of E.T. and really has nothing to do with pods whatsoever. 'Trumpy! You can do STUPID things!').

Anyway, the movie, like the series, has become a sought after classic. At the time I only have the VHS version since I didn't have a DVD, and Grammercy only made about a few copies for DVD to begin with.  Some claimed the quality wasn't that good, so we're hoping Rogue Entertainment might make some improvements to this one.

But I digress, the story temporarily rehashes the plot for those new to MST3K:  Dr. Forrester (Dr. F) has sent Mike helplessly into outer space, subjecting him (and the 'bots) to the worst films ever conceived.  This is in hopes Dr. F can find the worst one to unleash on an unsuspecting world and have global domination.

Of course, Mike and the 'Bots go about their merry business. Today Crow decides he wants to dig an escape tunnel, until he realizes (despite Tom's warnings) you can't dig through space.  Fortunately Mike manages to resolve it, just as Dr. F calls in.

The movie happens to be 'This Island Earth,' in which Mike and the 'bots make fun of in the usual fashion about a man and a woman who get involved with aliens from another world.

Though from the VHS version the theater sketches are slim (heard the original DVD version was completely uncut), they are humourous as in the series. Like Mike attempting piloting the Satellite of Love and wrecking the Hubble Telescope in the process.  Another where Tom admits he has an interocetor (the movie's invention) and they attempt calling for help.

Imagine going to a midnight screening of a ""B"" or ""C"" movie with couple of your best buds, cutting-up and goofin' on weak plot points, weaker FX and questionable acting. If you can imagine all that, then add the sci-fi genre to the mix, turn your two buds into puppet robots with some stinging-sardonic wit and you've got it.

Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie, is the post-mortem theatrical release following the series final run on Comedy Central. It is a polished presentation along with some primer origin info enough to help clue-in any newbies to the series. Mad Doctor Forester returns to throw bad movies at Mike, the temp, and his robots on the ""Satellite of Love."" But this time it isn't really a bad movie, so much as a retro-classic, ""This Island Earth."" If the title doesn't strike a cord, the crazy-bug-eyed, bulbous brained big clamp alien monster will seem familiar, at least.

The boys are on their game in this one, including Dr. F., the jokes fly fast and loose, some of which I still quote to this day. The sets are theatrical release quality, as are the edits and music. If you're a fan of the series, it will feel like the typical small screen to big screen transition, in fact, that very transition feels like an extension of the genre satire indicative of the MST3K brand, in it's classic form!

The MST3K movie has been long overdue for release, now we can add this to the increasing releases of 7 years of the original series, or you can start with this one. Either way I'd recommend it.

One down side...unlike some of the TV series DVDs, this one doesn't have both the MST3k version and the original version of the film. This DVD doesn't really have any extras at all, but I'm still happy to have it.",1202342400,12,1850,4.513432835820896
798257,5,630414069X,"MST3K The Movie got great reviews when it was in theaters in 1996 and deservedly so. Even after the studio chopped it down to a mere 75 minutes they couldn't destroy anything this funny. Siskel and Ebert at the time raved about it, as did most fans and critics. Sadly, the DVD has been out of print in the USA for many years, so it's great that this is available again for all the MSTies who missed out on it the first time around.

The movie being ""riffed"" is the classic color SF film from 1955, This Island Earth, starring Rex Reason, Faith Domergue (she was also in It Came From Beneath The Sea), Russell Johnson (the Professor on Gilligan's Island), and Jeff Morrow. It's a great looking film that is reasonably entertaining and well-made. However, as the MST3K writers point out repeatedly during jokes in this film, there's still plenty to make fun of, such as futuristic looking props that don't seem to have an actual purpose, plot premise issues, and some general fantastic silliness. MST3K The Movie is a lot of fun.

Note that Frank Conniff and Joel Hodgson had both left MST3K by the time that this film was made, so the Satellite of Love (SOL) is helmed by Mike Nelson and Dr. Forrester is on his own in Deep 13. The jokes are top notch, though occasionally a bit more PG-13 than on the regular MST3K TV show. The SOL and Deep 13 sets constructed for the film are slightly more elaborate than those previously used for the TV show on Comedy Central to that point. There are even a few scenes in the SOL in more than one location! The movie does follow the same general format as the TV show, including host segments. Look for the ""Manos"" reference during one host segment. This DVD is recommended!",1201651200,30,1711,4.480769230769231
798258,5,630414069X,"While various MST3K episodes have circulated over the internet and from companies like Rhino, the MST3K movie has long since disappeared from DVD shelves. Now, rather than rent a copy from Netflix and then ""lose"" it so you can keep one (or pay extravagant prices on Ebay), Universal has rereleased this great film to the delight of fans everywhere.

So what makes this different from any normal episode? Well, first of all it's set between the sixth and seventh seasons (right after the departure of TV's Frank and before Pearl joins as a regular), so Doctor F has the bad guy side all to himself. Fortunately, Trace is more than capable of making his every moment on screen a blast (there's even a funny ""mini-origin"" monologue that starts the film off to catch everyone up to speed). The set is finally expanded here and we get to see more of the ship finally. But, strangely enough, this is actually SHORTER than any of the episodes you see on television. This was done because the studio was afraid people who weren't familiar with the show would get bored in the theater--but of course, why would they go see it if they weren't familiar with the show in the first place?

The movie they choose to riff is ""This Island Earth"", which I always thought wasn't such a bad film anyway. However, Mike and the Bots do manage to squeeze in some great lines throughout. Definitely worth the time!

One small warning: they do use a few more colorful words here than they did on television. Not often by any means, but they sneak a couple in here and there.

I'm so glad we're finally seeing this gem return to DVD! Don't know what brought it on, but thank you!",1201651200,84,1654,4.540268456375839

However, throughout the film, we see their silhouettes against a movie screen as they quip their way through the entire movie.

In MST3K: The Movie, the trio is forced to watch the 1950's sci-fi sleeper ""This Island Earth""  We watch them as they watch the movie, ad-libbing the entire script.

Of course there is no real story.  It is just Mike  Nelson floating up in space with robots being forced to watch bad movies by  the evil Dr. Forrester.  It is almost like a B movie itself, but with witty  comments and better acting.  What makes the show so great is often the  comments they make on the films.  The main characters (Mike, Tom Servo and  Crowe) are visible watching the film in a theater and can be heard making  wise cracks about how bad the movie is.  Just like when you are watching a  bad movie with friends.  Unfortunately, the movie (which the Dr. claims is  the worst around and might be right) doesn't give them much to talk about.  The uesless ""This Island Earth"" isn't even bad enough to  acknowledge.  The story line of the bots breaking the spacecraft and fixing  it is kind of funny and they do manage to make a few good wise cracks, but  it isn't one of the best bashing.  It is just like an average episode of  the show.  I would recommend getting a few episode as a cheap as you can  and enjoying those instead.  The film is still funny and witty.  A marginal  recommendation from me on the ""Mystery Science Theater 3000: The  Movie"".",958262400,4,1472,4.344444444444444

When I saw previews of this movie on the tape Sgt. Bilko, I wondered what it was.  I rented it and loved it.  Now I try and get what  ever tapes I can get my hands on.  Unfortunetly MST3K tapes run upwards of  $20 so I have to budget myself until I can get a job this summer.

798570,5,630414069X,"""Mystery Science Theater 3000:  The Movie"" is the big screen version of the once-popular Comedy Central (later Sci-Fi Network) series.  In the series, Mike (or Joel) and his robot pals Gypsy, Tom Servo, and Crow  make running wisecracks while watching awful sci-fi movies beamed up to  them by the evil Dr. Forrester (Trace Beaulieu, who also voices Crow).  In  the big screen version, Mike and the 'bots take on Universal's ""This  Island Earth"" with hilarious results!
One of the best reasons for  owning this movie is that it is able to overcome many of the technical  limitations placed on TV series (such as the motions of the robots, for  instance).  This provides a more intimate and interesting portrayal of the  lives that the crew lead on the Satellite of Love.
If you are deciding  whether to watch or buy this movie, please PLEASE ignore the Amazon.com  review written by Miles Bethany.  It's painfully apparent that he has never  seen this movie from the fact that he continually refers to someone named  ""Jim"".  There's no character named Jim on the show (although Jim  Mallon does the voice of Gypsy).  He's clearly referring to either Joel or  Mike, but in any event Miles Bethany ought to be fired for this if he's on  Amazon's payroll!
Once you watch this movie, you'll hunger for episodes  of the series if you've never seen it.  Fortunately, the Sci-Fi Network  Episodes are not yet available.  They're not as funny as any of the early  episodes and tend to get a little overindulgent.  Additionally, Beaulieu  left the series before it got picked up by Sci-Fi, and the actor who  replaced him transformed the rather cute, insecure Crow into a character  that I grew to dislike.
The William Shatner jokes are really funny on  this movie, as well as Crow's impersonation of George Takei, which leaves  me rolling on the floor.  In any event, I recommend that you check out this  movie if for no other reason than to find out what the hell an interocetor  is (and hopefully how you spell the damned word)!",947203200,20,2022,4.726224783861672
798571,5,630414069X,"This movie is GREAT! The only flaw with The Mystery Science Theater 3000 movie is that it was too short. Even though it's still great. In this movie, Mike along with his robot pals, Tom and Crow, are forced to watch a  classic movie called This Island Earth by the evil Dr. Clayton Forrester in  an evil plot to rule the world. So while Mike and his robot pals are forced  to watch the movie they make witty comments back at the movie. Their  heckling keeps them from snapping and it provides us with tons of laughs  from their witty comments and the movie is not really that bad. MST3K: The  Movie was made more for people who were not used to the TV show MST3K thus  the reason for it's shortness, and for the movie not being that bad. Even  though it's made for more non-MST3K fans it's still gosh darn hilarious. In  other word, the movie is good for all kinds of MST3K fans old and new.

I have seen this movie more then forty times (no, really, I have) and every time I watch it I see another  hilarious joke that I missed the time that I saw it before.  Even though I  can practically recite the entire movie, I still bought copy.  Although  this movie is unresonably funny, it is a lot like an episode of the TV  show(Except for the fact that it is SHORTER then an episode of the TV  show)which disapointed me a bit, but it is funnier then an episode of the  show that I have ever seen.",942019200,,618,4.205128205128205

I had been familiar with MST3K through the press, but had never been witness to its inspired lunacy. It also helped that I have a  deep fondness for the science fiction movie of the 50's, so be forewarned,  this is NOT everyone's cup of tea. I however, loved this one and am now  waiting for reruns on the Canadian equivalent of the Sci-Fi Channel (the  video stores around here, for some unknown reason, only stock the movie).

798645,5,630414069X,"My son and I came across MST3K almost by accident one evening as we channel-surfed the dreary world of cable tv.  We found this incredibly cheesy scifi movie, with three silhouetted ""heads"" in the  foreground providing a running commentary of wisecracks.  Since my kids are  both of an age at which guffawing at all things 'cheesy' is a preferred  life-activity, we started to watch.  It was REALLY FUNNY!  And we have been  great fans of MST3K ever since.  I've even written letters to the SciFi  Channel urging them not to terminate the series.
For people who are  unfamiliar with the wacky universe of MST3K, I would recommend this video  as the one with which to start.  Generally, one can expect that about half  of the wisecracks issued by Mike, Crow, and Tom Servo to hit the mark, and  the rest to be so-so.  And hey, that's good enough.  But in their  lampooning of ""This Island Earth,"" their percentage of  ""hits"" is way higher.  Perhaps they rehearsed and edited the  comments?  Whatever--we were guffawing almost nonstop through this one.  It's FUNNY, folks.",929232000,3,1070,4.790055248618785
