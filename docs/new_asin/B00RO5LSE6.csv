6934156,5,B00RO5LSE6,I went up to Boulder to watch Railroad Earth on Etown. After a short show they played the DVD for us all. I knew I had to own it. I watch it all the time.,1430956800,,154,3.4285714285714284

6934158,5,B00RO5LSE6,"This is a beautiful DVD for RRE hobos. I was reluctant to buy the DVD for the price that came to almost $30 with shipping, but I'm glad I did. It's a great DVD set for any RRE fan. I put my new DVD in on Friday night, after a long and difficult work week, and it totally regulated my soul. A few times I found myself closing my eyes and enjoying the music and energy in the same way I enjoy Railroad Earth concerts.
It was fun to see our favorite guys in the Red Rocks setting and to see the crowd getting into the music. If there was anything I'd complain about it's that I'd like to have seen more of the beautiful outdoor theater during the sunset. I think that would've made for an even better viewing.",1429401600,3,706,4.05
6934159,5,B00RO5LSE6,"I pre-ordered this from the band website, didn't buy it off Amazon. Nonetheless I figured I'd write a brief review since there aren't any yet. The band's performances of their well-crafted songs are top-notch, as is the norm for them. This show is unique in that there is a horn section for the entire second set, which adds new flavor to the songs. The audio quality and mix is great. The camerawork is great as well. Lots of fluid shots, and the atmosphere of the night is captured well. There are enough cameras that you don't get tired of any one shot. The editing, cutting between shots, is well done. My only problem with this entire production is a simple editing mistake. After the first few songs the audio and video fall out of sync. The video is actually a fragment of a second ahead of the audio, and this is maddening to me. It drives me crazy to see a cymbal hit or a string plucked before I hear it. It's a shame because this is relatively easy to avoid during editing. I'm sure some people won't care, but for the detail-oriented it is frustrating.",1426377600,11,1064,4.433673469387755

8695653,5,B00RO5LSE6,"Love this band and have seen them live about 3 dozen times, great live band and this DVD allows me to get my RRE fix in between shows. The new material ( new songs ) are already becoming some of my favorites songs, especially hangtown ball, I think that song and this whole show will give anyone who does not know of them a chance to appreciate what great musicians they are and how tight they play as a band.",1447977600,,409,4.125
8695654,5,B00RO5LSE6,some of the best new music around with a son volt and warren haynes influence,1446508800,,77,4.2
8695655,4,B00RO5LSE6,"Great songs,great sound, really solid show of 2015 with the addition of horns which adds a little something but never distracts. The band musical is one of a kind a mixture of bluegrass, straight ahead touching folks songs, humor and avant garde music that could fit on a classical label. Too many crowd cuts. I wanted the band documented not the people who where there. Although a few are friends and are nice to see after a while I wish more long shots that stayed focus on the events instead of the cuts that work a little bit but watch it again it feels like somebody with with OCD was editing this thing.",1442880000,,609,4.398230088495575
