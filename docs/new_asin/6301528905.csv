7812182,4,6301528905,Was one of her best movies actually its an earlier rare one that she did but i loved the suspense and the drama in story line and she played off the character very well especially at the end .,1419552000,,192,3.948717948717949

7812187,4,6301528905,"Saw this movie as ""Haunted By Her Past"" when it was on tv.  Personally, I like that title better because it doesn't sound so much like a Harlequin Romance or soap opera.  But that's just me, and that is kinda the point of this review.  I'm not saying this movie is the greatest movie since ""Gone With the Wind"" but certain movies just work on an individual basis.  I won't give too much away but this is a straight forward ghost movie with a added curse theme that essentially reproduces an original murder and subsequent events in each generation along Susan Lucci's character's family tree. I bought this on Amazon Prime, $11, because it's not available on DVD.  The movie is not 1080p but no lag was noted while watching the streaming movie.  Wish it was on DVD, though.  I highly recommend this movie, just in case that point was not clear.",1381449600,3,844,4.5131578947368425
