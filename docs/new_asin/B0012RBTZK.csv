8247366,4,B0012RBTZK,"Ok, it is not as great as his later masterpiece King Roger (Szymanowski had not yet added orientalist melodies and harmonies to his orchestral palette, and the subject did not engage him so deeply) but it is still an opera worth seeing. In one Act, 80 minutes, it tells the story about how the Old King can only be saved from death if a young virgin gives herself to him. Hagith comes, but she is in love with the Young King and refuses the Old King's advances. An angry crowd kills her.

If you like Strauss' Salome and Elektra, this is a one-act opera very much in the same spirit and style. And apart from some strange costumes, and weird antics from the crowd, the production is good and the singers in the solo roles are  well cast both vocally and as acting performers.",1501804800,,775,4.375
