8412654,5,B0041EQIGQ,Very cool movie. Two very cool song's. Not in english. Must use subtitle's. One of my favorite's. No dislike's.,1528156800,,111,4.894736842105263
8412655,5,B0041EQIGQ,A very funny but dark farce on a young Pakistani who is determined to come to the USA and a bin Laden look-alike who is a poultry farmer. Bit dated now that the real Bin Laden has been dispatched.,1357084800,,196,4.051282051282051
8412656,4,B0041EQIGQ,Goofy comedy about some folks struggling for a break who think they've found it when they fake a video of Osama bin Laden. Light comedy with a few soft political jabs.,1322179200,,167,4.419354838709677
