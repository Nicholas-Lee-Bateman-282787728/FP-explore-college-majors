7833630,5,630300315X,This is a wonderful movie.  It is beneficial for those with cancer. I first watched it when I was a teen and was inspired  I recently watched it again in my cancer coaching class. I wish they would reformat to DVD- I would love to have this in my library.,1513814400,,255,4.08
7833631,5,630300315X,"Very good story about dealing with a life threatening illness, like cancer. It very perceptively addresses the sickness on many levels and helps you face the evil with new hope and many ways to find healing. Yes, we are complex as human beings. I was miraculously healed after being given five more years to live following a brain tumor operation in 1977, at the age of 19, which I wrote about in my book, The Coolness of Josh. Yet there were still emotional healings needed and I found this movie to reveal insight into wonderful and loving therapies for healing, which helped me no end. Well worth the price!",1425945600,,610,4.605504587155964
7833632,3,630300315X,I was only able to find this movie on VHS.  I would of rather found it on a DVD.  It will do though.,1403827200,,100,3.3043478260869565
7833633,5,630300315X,Worth watching if you have any debilitating illness or spiritual quest. Solid advice with a healthy approach to life told in an interesting and entertaining drama. Too bad they don't release this on DVD.,1394064000,3,203,5.0
7833634,5,630300315X,I hope this movie will be produced as a DVD which may give more people a chance to see it and learn from it. Medications may be ok for crisis situations but healing comes from within. We must regain our confidence in our body after being brainwashed that pharmaceuticals can regulate all our problems.,1316217600,7,301,4.592592592592593
7833635,3,630300315X,"I was looking for QUESTION OF FAITH, which seems to be only on VHS and out of print.  I had found it helpful, informative and inspirational a few years ago, and look forward to getting a copy somehow.
The Amazon reviews refering to the monastery and catholicism belong, I believe, to A QUESTION OF FAITH, which sounds like quite a different movie.",1190332800,7,347,4.596774193548387
7833636,4,630300315X,"I originally saw this movie at the Sundance Film Festival when it was first released and the name was ""Blessed Art Thou"".  Being a Catholic I was very open-minded to the contents of the movie and realize there is quite a bit of symbolism taking place.  I enjoyed the move. But having the opportunity to speak with the producer and the cast of the film made it more enjoyable.  The insight they gave me was very helpful to understand where they were coming from and why the movie was made.  The producer/director is Catholic but no longer practices.  As he said because of all the changes in the church he ""questioned his faith"".  I feel that one has to try to understand what the point they are trying to get across. One of the points is that in today's society, we have a hard time accepting a miracle.  We want an explaination for the miracle, instead of just accepting it for what it is.  I would recommend anyone who believes to see the movie.  I know the acting is not up for an Oscar, but the real purpose for making the movie it what one should enjoy.",1108425600,6,1058,4.32994923857868
7833637,4,630300315X,"I found this movie very encouraging.  A few years ago I was trying to recover from several health problems and was glad to find a movie that showed natural methods of healing.  I'm a christian & believe God has many methods He uses to show us natural ways to heal along with prayer.  This movie showed options such as nutrition, exercise, visual imagery, accupuncture, etc.  I healed from all my ailments that were considered ""incurable"" by natural methods and movies like this helped keep me focused and uplifted while I was healing.",1096416000,10,534,4.771739130434782
