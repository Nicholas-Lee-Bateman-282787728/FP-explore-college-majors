8427720,5,B004F432SO,One of the funniest movies ever.  I thing original print is lost and not available on DVzd.  I looked for this on VHS and DVD,1371859200,,125,3.96
8427721,4,B004F432SO,"When a beloved benefactor (A.E. Matthews) of a small Irish village passes away, the town welcomes his nephew (David Niven) who inherited the estate. However, unlike his uncle, the money hungry nephew presses the townspeople for loans owed, rents unpaid and abandons institutions that his uncle underwrote. So, they decide to kill him. This amusing comedy with dark undertones might lay the Irish whimsy (even though it was filmed entirely in England) on a bit thick but it's so good natured in its deviltry that it's best to let it soak in. Niven seems to be having a wonderful time playing the heartless rogue and Yvonne De Carlo matches him as the glamorous, gold digging widow who returns to the village after her husband's death. The comedic finale where the village conspires to do Niven in by various methods (decapitation, scaring him to death, blowing him up) is deftly handled and full of chuckles. Directed by Mario Zampi. With Barry Fitzgerald, Noelle Middleton, Robert Urquhart, Michael Shepley and George Cole. Released in the U.S. under the title TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.

I watched the Optimum DVD from Great Britain, not the Spanish import. It is a nice transfer in a full screen 1.33 aspect ratio. Some of the color seems a bit faded and it could use some touching up but it's eminently watchable.",1328313600,,1310,4.874439461883408
8427722,3,B004F432SO,"This is a 50's English ""ghost"" comedy that I'm ashamed to admit I'd never heard of. David Niven is the new squire who proceeds to make himself UNPOPULAR in the Irish countryside. It's up to the village idiot to kill him when the anger gets out of bounds. Not uproarious but amusing.",1327104000,,282,4.4423076923076925
