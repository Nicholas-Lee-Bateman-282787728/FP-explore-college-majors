4309692,4,B004AJMO4C,it showed how a demon ussed a so called man of god to unwit his own family in to a bitter end this movie was very well written with a great suprize ending,1344124800,,154,3.696969696969697
4309693,2,B004AJMO4C,"I read a review online prior to watching this that said it was (cult dark-comedy classic) The Room bad. I was skeptical, but I liked the idea of The Room meets the Exorcist, and eventually gave in and bought it. Yesterday night I finally watched it. I was expecting it to be horrible and it definitely was! When the main character meets up with the half green pig and the pig starts to speak to her in a Heavy Metal bass voice, I laughed long and hard. And when they flashed to scenes of the girl getting possessed, prancing around and spinning at double-film speed, I laughed some more. And when the film cut, and the scene changed to an image of the girl's feet, which suddenly lifted off the ground to imply she was levitating,  I laughed and laughed and, maybe, even slapped my leg.

But the laughter ended eventually and it settled into a storyline that could have been cut into a thirty minute episode. If I had to describe it with a single word, it would be plodding. They tried to spice it up with some humor (a man eating a sandwich over an autopsy table: quips the priest, ""I can see how a man could work up an appetite in this line of work""), some mystery (a strange woman and a girl are walking on the beach, as the priest looks on) and some demonic clips (prancing at double-speed, with cheesy make-up).

The only thing that kept me going were the occasional unexpected amusing bits. The fact that the family of the possessed girl was named (what sounded like) McMurder was pretty amusing. The fact that the aging, hairy, barrel chested priest could see the future and the past, as well as kick demon butt was amusing too. The fact that this was secretly a Christian film was interesting and, given the results and random inclusion of Christian messages, amusing too. Frankly, I'm surprised anyone with an obvious Christian agenda would make a violent horror film, but I'd welcome more of this sort of religious film than any of the candy-coated Hallmark wannabes that one usually associates with Christian films.

Maybe I'm being too kind, but I did think the last scene was mildly creepy. They finally tossed aside the Heavy Metal bass vocals for a simple slightly distorted male voice for the possessed girl, and it worked a lot better for it. And though the make-up was kind of sloppy, it was still pretty effective, thanks to a suddenly explosive performance from the possessed lead. But it was a quick scene and it ended too soon, and gave away to... Oh, I dunno, I kind of started skipping ahead every 5 minutes starting at the twenty minute mark, and I'm pretty sure I started skipping ahead during this scene as well once they resumed their normal low standards. Last of all, before the credits, a dedication was made of this whole bloody, violent, demonic affair to the creator's recently departed relative. And that, my friends, was perhaps the scariest part of all.

I can't tell you to not watch this. I can't even say this is the worst film I've ever seen--it's not! I can say, if any of this sounds like your thing, and you have a healthy dose of riffing skills and a room full of friends, you might just enjoy it on some sick-twisted level that you should be ashamed of.",1320537600,7,3199,4.518134715025907
4309694,1,B004AJMO4C,"Now, honestly, I like B-movies, I find them fun to watch.  But this one was just BAD.

4309702,3,B004AJMO4C,"I haven't finished it yet, but so far...
It's so funny. I don't think it was meant to be. I decided to watch because of Roddy Piper (""They Live"" was good) and his daughter. I found a movie that I think was made on a budget of $16.23. The visual effects, so far, are really bad. So are the audio effects. Demonic voices are abundant in this flick and they are completely unintelligible. The best part is the Episcopal priest who narrates in a very film noir style. In their day, those films were called melodramas, and his performance is appropriately melodramatic.
It seems to have a very pro-religion message (Jesus religion, in particular). Don't watch it if you want to see something scary; watch it if you want something you can laugh at and make fun of.",1474675200,3,758,4.5

The effects don't even have to be top notch, but for me the type and quality of the film is a big factor for me to watch any movie. And even old black and white films look better than this one did, and I will even watch scratched black and white.

4309746,4,B004AJMO4C,"Wow, this was a gem. Low budget but still a gem.

Cons: low budget, special effects sometimes corny, lack of knowledge of Catholicism (like other priests didn't like one priest and were going to ""transfer"" him to a protestant church), floats between present time, future visions and memories and had to be narrated a lot (then again, so did Dune and that was legendary).

Pros: First and foremost, it is spooky enough to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Creepy scenes in the first minute, which will start your adrenaline flowing. Watch late at at night with popcorn, it you don't mind picking up popcorn in the dark that you dumped in a scary scene.

People either love or hate this. There are mainly high star or low star ratings, with a hole in the very middle star ratings. If your picky (don't mean that in a bad way) about cheap scenery (a wood shed made into a church that seated 10 people) and effects, you probably won't like it. If you can look past that and just love movie for how spooky it is, you'll love it.

I'd like to compliment the people that made this movie. Again, budget was small, but huge return on results. Keep up the good work.

I do wish the Priest spent more time with the possessed at the end. Well done.",1450137600,5,1252,4.356223175965665

I do not scare easy but there were a few good scary parts and many parts that a person liking this sort of thing would appreciate. I don't think the acting was bad like others said. I think it was a style of acting seen more often these days.

The actors were good. And so was the story. It is what I hope for, one of the types of scary movies I like, when I look for and watch a scary movie. I especially liked the end where it said it was dedicated to a young girl in his family who was beaten and burned by 4 teenage girls to death. Says how important it was to him.

Do not judge the whole movie on the first few minutes. It does start out in such a way that I thought it was going to be trash but quickly moved on to the story. Some of the scenes are what I'd consider cheesy in other movies but not this one. For this movie, they worked. It just goes with the style of the movie, the acting, the story.
