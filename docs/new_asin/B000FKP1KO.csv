8124331,5,B000FKP1KO,"Our third year Spanish class has used ""The Aztec Empire"" VHS video for several years in our Mexico unit. Because second year Spanish wanted to use this video, I looked for a new video. I thought I had found it in ""Ancient Mysteries: Secrets of the Aztec Empire."" Unfortunately, this DVD is the same as the VHS, only it has a different name. It is a great product, but I feel it is false advertising, because the DVD did not say on the cover that it is a repackaging of ""The Aztec Empire.""",1168646400,5,488,4.258064516129032
