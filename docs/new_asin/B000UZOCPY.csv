8215852,5,B000UZOCPY,"This man, Nicholas Winton saved lives. He saved the life of individuals he did not know. He was blessed enough to live for 103 years and died on July 1, 2015. Nicholas Rejected the description of himself as a hero, insisting that unlike Schindler, his life had never been in danger. He was always modest about his achievements, and his reasons for acting. The sad part of this equation is that this man who never harmed a single soul for a single penny that he made in addition to saving lives, did not get the recognition from Nobel Prize but yet Nobel Prize has gone to individuals who have done nothing, absolutely nothing in comparison to Nicholas. Flags all over the world should have flown at half mast for an individual like Nicholas since he was one of the rare humans who represented the value of humanity on Planet Earth. This is a very sad, sad day. I wish his daughter, Barbara health and happiness. This man did not save the lives of ONLY some 650+ individuals, he saved the life of their siblings as well and how many reviews this documentary about this genuine human being has received... only three. Absolute disgrace, what majority of humans are all about.",1435708800,5,1173,4.59047619047619
8215853,5,B000UZOCPY,"I found the caliber of this movie far above some other documentaries I've seen. It's not preachy and it's very touching. I never watch TV but it reminds me of TV specials I've seen before---in other words, it was well crafted to hold your attention as opposed to some documentary that someone would only watch in an educational setting. Like an episode of 60 minutes or whatever show I'm thinking of (I have watched TV in my life, just not recently).

I had tears running down my face, but mostly tears of joy. Although the movie aroused anger in me for the horrible things done to innocent people, to a greater degree it brought me amazement, wonder, and inspiration about how people go on after tragedy to lead normal, fulfilling lives. The humility of the lead character was also amazing.",1362960000,8,791,4.65
8215854,5,B000UZOCPY,"This amazing story is nothing less than medicine for the soul. At a time of historic angst and disenchantment, and pandemic ""learned helplessness"" on the part of individuals, Nicholas Winton's story should be known by everyone. It is extremely disappointing to me that this video is unavailable at the moment. I urge Amazon to make a new copy available immediately. I watch this video several times a year because it's a real shot of spiritual vitamin B-12. Watch this video and for the rest of your life you will know that YOUR life matters and that every moment is a precious opportunity for you to make YOU count.",1335916800,8,616,4.712962962962963
8215855,5,B000UZOCPY,This film tells the amazing story of a man who saved 670 children from the Nazis and then kept quite about it for about 50 years.  He never looked for recognition for his deeds and actually seems a little uncomforable with his fame.  It is one of the most inspiring films I have ever seen.,1235606400,15,289,4.236363636363636
