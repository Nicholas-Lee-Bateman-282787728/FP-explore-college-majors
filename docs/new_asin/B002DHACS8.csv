3910461,5,B002DHACS8,"I am a black belt jujitsu and a senior instructor in a Wu Tang Kung Fu School. So, I am able to appreciate Tony Jaa's movements than those people who do not have martial arts background. I first saw Ong Bak because of its promise that Tony Jaa is a logical successor to Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Jet Li. My expectation was fully fulfilled. So, I now see ""Spirited Trilogy Killer"". In all these movies I saw a lot of martial arts movements which are not usually  displayed in more common martial arts such as Karate, Jujitsu, Kung Fu, etc. One movement is climbing into the enemy and strike him from the upward downward with elbow. Convinced of the effectiveness of Muay Thai, From Ong Back I saw the Protector and the Spirited Trilogy Killer. Just a by the way: I said before than Muay Thay displayed movements that are not usually seen in other martial arts.
An exception is probably in a form of Vienamese martial art displayed in the movie ""The Rebel"". Karate and Tae Kwon do likes to use backward roundhouse kick because it is 2/3X more powerful than frontal kick. But in ""The Rebel"", the two primary actors use a back double roundhouse kick, where the first should trap the enemy and the second is the real thing,",1257724800,5,1219,4.466367713004484
3910462,1,B002DHACS8,"I just watched these three, or I should say parts of them. I was hoping to see some interesting Thai culture in the background even if the movie was no good but no. There is some bizarre made-up pretend voodoo rituals and even wierder zombification rituals, but they aren't interesting, they seem to have been concocted by fifth graders. Then there are lots of Thai folks running around in open woods and fields chasing each other and being chased by zombies. The scenes could just as well have been in Alabama for all the Thai culture there is. There is essentially no plot or character in any of these, they aren't so bad that they're good, and I really wonder if they weren't all arranged and directed, written and edited by some rich fifth grader for a grade school project.",1257552000,6,778,4.564285714285714

Trick me twice shame on me and ,'boy' this doesn't even resemble a lousy ""B"",rated movie. Action and story,lousy. Didn't you see a whole movie load of Thai martial arts movies come out that said:Director's,producers and whatever for their new martial arts movie outbreak. These movies claim to be ""the Producers of Ong Bak and right on cue,all 3 are lemons out of 3. Not worth the postage!!!",1405728000,,527,4.557894736842106

3910478,1,B002DHACS8,"What's upsetting about this movie isn't how bad the movies are, but that it's falsely advertised as a Tony Jaa movie.

-Tony Jaa is only in the movie for 5 minutes, and he is just a random guy. The art on the box is taken from Ong Bak. There are no explosions.
-Nonexistent plot. Literally, people running around the woods and fighting repeatedly.
-Horrendous dub. The second two movies are subbed, which is better. The first movie had no sub option.
-Ceases to be funny mid-way through and just gets annoying and repetitive.
-The back of the box says the language is Taiwanese. Taiwanese is not a language, it is a nationality. The language is Thai, and Taiwanese people speak Chinese.
-The choreography is decent, but it is dragged down by every other aspect of the movie.

Not worth your time or money. False advertising.
Buy Ong Bak or The Protector (Tom Yum Goong). They will not disappoint.",1289692800,8,896,4.6645569620253164
3910479,4,B002DHACS8,"As I considered buying this collection, I was at first put off by the negative comments I read here. Fortunately, I went ahead and bought it. And I am glad that I did. The three movies in this collection are not the slick, well-choreographed and precisely executed kung fu movies like those of Jet Li, Jackie Chan or Donnie Yen. The martial art of Thailand is Muay Thai, greatly different from Kung Fu. The movies are reminiscent of the early Jackie Chan films originally made for Hong Kong audiences. As in so many Hong Kong kung fu films, the story line is thin, and the fight sequences many and lengthy, almost always including slapstick comendy routines that add spice to the martial art action. THink of them as Abbott and Costello in the jungles of Thailand. Anyone contemplating purchasing this DVD should not expect a grandiose Hollywood-type movie, nor a monster epic such as John Woo might create. These films are not well-written, exquisitely acted or tightly edited as, say, Casablanca or The African Queen, but they are to me delightful and enjoyable viewing. There was a comment that the English-language dubbing was not all that great. That may be, but we do not know what the characters were saying in the language of Thailand, so the dubbing worked for me. English subtitles are present and quite clear in all three films. In conclusion, lovers of martial arts films, and in particular the high-flying, knee-kicking, elbow-conking action of Muay Thai should consider adding this DVD to their collections. It is a demon, zombie and ghost-ridden series made comical by liberal doses of Oriental slapstick. I enjoyed them greatly<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Killer-Trilogy/dp/B002DHACS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Killer: Trilogy</a>",1283731200,7,1806,5.385159010600707
3910480,3,B002DHACS8,"Having read some of the other reviews and considering the price for 3 movies
they seem a bit harsh to me.

If you want a high action, full of rich culture type movie, flush with current Tony Jaa type quality and action, you'll be disappointed, imo, and you're going to pay more for it than the cost of all 3 of these movies.

But if you lower your expectations and realize why the cost is low for 3 movies
then you can come away satisfied.

In the set I received, one had subtitles, and the other two were in English.
They aren't great movies, but they're not bad either if you have a sense of humor
and realize upfront they aren't box office smash hits.

It's entertainment and looks like 70's movie genre. So if you don't place high expectations on them upfront, you can relax, sit back, and actually enjoy them
and some of it will even be comical as you realize the mistakes.

Now all of that being said, there were some pretty good stunts pulled off.
I'm not disappointed with my purchase because I went in eyes wide open.",1282089600,8,1026,4.322916666666667
3910481,1,B002DHACS8,"This is the worst ever, Too all who might be thinking of buying this please don't. This is my first review ever, I felt obligated to let everyone one know don't waste a dime on this movie. They should pay you to watch this video.",1276560000,3,229,4.111111111111111
3910482,1,B002DHACS8,"All three films in this collection are defective.  The first SPIRITED KILLER is presented with a choice of English dubbing or the original Thai language audio - but there are no English subtitles, and the English dubbing is unusually bad.

SPIRITED KILLER 2 and 3 are screwed up differently.  They are presented only in Thai and do have perfectly adequate English subtitles - but they forgot to letterbox the ""scope"" ratio films.  The end result is that both films are stretched out to 16x9, making everything appear unnaturally tall and skinny.  SPIRITED KILLER 1, it should be noted, is properly letterboxed in the 16x9 frame.

Bonus points are awarded for referring to the Thai language as ""Taiwanese"" not once, not twice, but THREE times on the DVD cover.  It shows how much work went into this release that not only are ALL the films on the DVD screwed up, but Mill Creek can't even correctly identify the language spoken in the films' country of origin.  Don't buy this release... unless you plan on downloading subs for the first film, then re-encoding and re-authoring the whole package yourself.",1264809600,19,1104,4.866310160427807

Good martial art moves . Tony appears only briefly. But it is all about back history of makers of Onbak. And their evolution from cheap to good movies",1521244800,,300,4.375
