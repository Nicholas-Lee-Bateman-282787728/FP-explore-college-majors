1828498,1,B000087F7K,The episodes in this disc are definitely not one of the best this series had to offer and it appears real fans of this show will have to wait several years before we can actually purchase better episodes on DVD (as many great episodes were released after 1994).,1050796800,,261,4.458333333333333
1828499,5,B000087F7K,I thought this d.v.d was put together sensationally it is really the best cartoons of the 90's and to me of all time. I have always loved batman and the the animaterd series cartoons but now i'm thirteen years but still watch when I have time on my old series tapes. I also gave this 5 stars and I will be hoping to see a batman show just like this to avalible on the network of television soon.,1050624000,,395,4.076923076923077
1828500,1,B000087F7K,"It's pretty clear that Warner Bros. is trying to just capitalize on the kiddie market with the treatment of the animated series of Batman. It's too bad, a lot of the series' fans were teens, young adults and older who now would love to have the whole series on DVD. I have several dozen of the old episodes on VHS, commercials and all. It's too bad I don't even have a VCR anymore! I'd like to catch up on one of animation's triumphs of style and substance, but I won't waste money on what's being offered. It never fails to amaze me how they will try to get moms to pick up a Batman movie for their kids rather than please the original fans of the series. WB take note - the fans of the series who used to watch it on TV now have jobs and money to spend on boxed sets.",1049932800,2,769,4.032679738562091
1828501,1,B000087F7K,"Batman: The Animated Series is probably one of the best treatments for the charatcer that has ever been realized.  Why, oh why has the release of this wonderful, exciting and fun to watch program being handled by some marketing intern?
Has WB learned nothing from the seasonal releases of ""The Simpson's?""  Even while the extras on that are not stellar, they are certainly nice additions.  Good God, ""The Transformers"" from the early to mid 80's has both box sets AND single disks available for purchase and, from what I understand is doing very, very well!  And four to five episodes per disk for BTAS?  And not even in sequence?  Who's running this?  Batman is one of the strongest properties WB owns and they are handling this like some direct to video property in whcih they have ZERO confidence.
This is how BTAS should be released.  Seasonal box sets.  Secondary audio track for commentary.  Video on the process of making the program.  I KNOW video such as this already exists as I remember seeing shorts on the subject years ago.  PEOPLE WILL BUY THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT.
WB...pull your thumbs out of your...um...ears (could barely sanitize that).  You will make more MONEY by releasig this product PROPERLY.  What you are doing now is DEVALUING your own license to print money.  Get in the game and release these shows with some backbone, or get out.  I bought the first disk, reluctantly, but if this is what they are going to .... out and try to sell me, no thanks.  I'll wait the 16-17 years until Rhino (who is doing ""The Transformers"" MORE than justice) buys some release rights and publishes this content in a format that fans are not disgusted in buying.
One of the best animated series in television history.  Too bad chimps are in charge of its treatment on DVD.",1049846400,19,1777,4.67741935483871
1828502,2,B000087F7K,"For those who willingly bought the first BTAS disc in hopes that WB would release more, and with better extras, be prepared for a big disappointment. First of all, it's been a year, and this is only the 2nd disc we've gotten. Another disc should arrive in the fall, but at this rate, we'll have to let our sons and daughters finish the collection for us. 2nd, this disc only has four episodes, not even the five that the first disc gave us, and not six, which is what a DVD disc is capable of holding (see WB's Batman Beyond DVD). 3rd...the episodes are only so-so. Only one major villain is featured, the Joker, but it's nowhere near his best outing. Another episode features the one-shot villain The Sewer King, who uses children to commit his crimes. Despite an interesting premise, it's easily at the bottom of the barrel compared to other episodes. The last two, POV and The Forgotten, are above-average and give us a nice look at Bruce Wayne and the Gotham Police force. However, overall, these episodes just weren't worth the year-long wait.
And extras? Forget about any good extras. Anything remotely interesting, such as Bruce Timm's intros, will be butchered into little segments that feel more promotional than informative. If you're a die-hard BTAS fan, you might as well grab this disc, since some BTAS is better than none, but just remember that it's a no-win situation: Good sales will only encourage WB to keep churning out poor DVDs like this, and bad sales will just cause them to stop production altogether. If it helps, consider buying this disc as an appetizer for when the new DTV Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman will be released this fall.",1048550400,32,1662,4.714776632302406
1828503,1,B000087F7K,"5 episodes a year, with no special features? That's how WB is choosing to release this GEM of an animated series. Unbelievable. Instead of putting out a box set per season, with a comprehensive episode guide and some special features, they are releasing this disappointing DVD. It's great to finally have them on a disc, but not 5 at a time.",1048464000,16,341,4.60655737704918
1828504,2,B000087F7K,"""Batman:The Animated Series"" is literally everything I could want from a comic book adaptation.  In fact, I would say it remains the best comic book inspired TV series or movie ever made.  It stays true to the characters, tells interesting stories and has some of the finest animation around.  A truly groundbreaking, amazing series.
Which is why it is all the more disappointing to see ""Batman:TAS"" get such a lackluster DVD release.  Like all TV shows, it should have been released in Season Box Sets rather than in this manner.  Even as it is, the extras are slim to none, and there is nothing to really recommend this DVD.  I hope Warner Bros will correct this error, and give us some Season Box Sets.  Until then, I will decline.",1047686400,43,734,4.6434108527131785
1828519,2,B000087F7K,"WB really give the impression that they are totally uninterested in doing anything even remotely special with their valuable Batman properties on DVD.
They know there is a market out there for season boxed-sets of this show (due to repeated requests made to them from the public) - why would they choose to ignore this?
My advice would be to vote with your wallet and wait until WB wake up to themselves and treat this award-winning television show with the respect it fully deserves.",1053216000,10,484,4.773809523809524
1828520,4,B000087F7K,"Batman: The Animated Series is probably the best cartoon produced for Saturday mornings of the '90s. (Of course, if you're reading this, you already know *that*...) So, getting released on DVD should be no surprise. But in sets like this? Please.
Warner owns Rhino. And, if you've seen Rhino's cartoon DVD sets (which include Gigantor, G.I. Joe, the Transformers, and other shows), you *know* that that's a good thing. So, why doesn't Warner just pump out their own shows (and the other assorted cartoons they own) in deluxe box sets of about 25 eps apiece? It'd certainly be the best option, especially since this disc (which is, like the previous release, in production order) has four episodes that are fairly yawn-worthy. And it's best not to get into WB's policy on ""extras"" on cartoon DVDs.
Unless you really want these eps on DVD, you might as well pass, and wait for WB to come to its' senses.",1052611200,4,901,4.745222929936306
1828521,3,B000087F7K,"First of all, I want to say that ""Batman: The Animated Series"" is one of the finest animated shows ever produced for American television.  It has a coherency and, above all, a consistency that even much higher profile prime time drama shows frequently lack.  One of the things that contributes to this consistency is the fact that characters introduced in earlier episodes often return in later episodes - not just main characters, but villians and side-characters frequently reappear as well.
Putting the episodes out-of-order would ruin one of the best things about the series, the continuing development of the characters as the show progresses.  For example, viewers are introduced to Harvey Dent, D.A. in the episode ""Pretty Poison"" as Poison Ivy's date.  Later, Harvey returns to become a well-known villian from the Batman universe.  This kind of attention to detail and set up makes the show a lot of fun to watch in order, but would be completely lost if the episodes were not made available *in the order they were produced*.
Additionally, I was rather surprised that so many people disliked the episodes on this DVD.  ""The Underdwellers"", if a bit melodramatic in narrative, shows Bruce Wayne's compassionate side (in both the care he takes of the boy and his anger at one of the least sympathetic villians in the entire Batman series).  ""The Forgotten"" is another episode that shows that Batman is more than your average muscle-bound superhero; he's also a detective, who dons a disguise in an almost Sherlock Holmes-esque manner in order to solve the mystery.  My favorite of this disc, though, is P.O.V. - a character study that introduces Officer Montoya (who will re-appear later in the series).
All that being said, I would also like to state that I agree with most of the other reviewers that there's nothing I'd like better than to see a couple of nice, full-featured, well-packaged box sets of this series.  I would buy them in a heart beat.  I also agree with the fact that a flimsy cardboard DVD package is extremely cheap and not at all what this excellent show deserves.  Please, take heed and bring out better discs with better packaging - but keep the order the same!",1051920000,2,2193,4.868279569892473
1828522,4,B000087F7K,"OK, so it's not what I envisioned either (box sets, anyone?). But it's here, and that's nothing to shake a stick at. And they're coming out with the next DVD in July, so they're at least trying to speed things up a bit. Apparently they had to limit the episodes to 4 because the two-part Two-Face episodes come next, and 6 would be too many eps for one DVD. I would give this DVD 5 stars, but the first ep really isn't too good, and the Bruce Timm intros could be a lot longer. Peace out, bat-fans.",1051315200,,498,4.144329896907217
1828523,1,B000087F7K,"These reviews are starting to sound like a broken record, but perhaps if enough people read them and stay away from these DVD releases, Warner Bros. will figure out that they can make more money by making the fans happy.
Fox can put entire Simpsons, Futurama, and The Family Guy seasons on DVD. Paramount has no problem producing and selling Star Trek: Next Gen and DS9 season sets that retail for $100. So what is up with Warner Bros. and one of their hottest properties? THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR NOT RELEASING THE ANIMATED BATMAN SERIES IN VOLUMES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SEASONS!!!
I might have overlooked this decision if Warner released a ""Best of"" DVD or DVD's devoted to single characters (all the Joker episodes, all the Two-Face episodes, etc.). But instead, we get disks like this one--containing a mere 4 episodes (none of them particularly good) and limited special features. As a fan of the series, I KNOW that there are a lot of reference materials available--just look at the excellent Batman Animated book! This disk has a brief featurette on the voice acting that contains comments from only a single actor(Kevin Conroy).
To top it all off, the disk comes in the paper DVD case that I despise (even AOL sometimes sends out free disks in plastic DVD cases!) with cover artwork that pales in comparison to the actual animation. Bruce Timm, where are you?
Please save your money by not buying this disk! Maybe Warner Bros. can forget these last two disks ever happened and start over from scratch before it's too late...",1051228800,22,1528,4.7481203007518795
1828524,1,B000087F7K,"I agree with the folks saying release the DVDs as a set. And if releasing them separately, then please number them so you know which one is which, and don't wait a year (or so) between releases. Fine animation and story. Terrible marketing by WB.",1050969600,2,246,4.488888888888889
1828525,2,B000087F7K,"Why does Warner Brothers love to give Batman the shaft on DVD.
First they simply stuck the movie franchise films on dvd with out any extras with the exception of cast information.
Now Warner Brothers fails to deliver a collector's edition dvd for its critically acclaimed Batman: The Animated Series.  I don't mind the episodes they put onto the disc...what I do mind are the episodes not on the disc.  The Two-Face episodes about his origin are not on the disc contrary to the advertisements and Amazon's editorial description.
Its time for Warner Brothers to wise up and realize that Batman is not for the three to six years old.  They killed the Batman Franchise by sugar coating it to death with such lolly-pop releases as Batman and Robin and the newer WB Batman and Batman Beyond animated episodes.  Its time to salvage what is left of the franchice and start by giving the fans a DVD collection that is both weighty with content and episodes that is placed in a neatly designed box set.  Kids are not going to buy cartoons that are over 10 years old.  Batman is old school.  Market the Pokemon videos to the infants but let Batman have a better fate.",1050969600,25,1157,4.587378640776699
1828526,1,B000087F7K,"DO NOT BUY THIS! It is a complete waste.
The WB continues to prove what cheapskates they are by releasing just a few episodes with little to no features.

1828527,1,B000087F7K,"Thats right, you heard me...there are no more heroes..not on DVD at any rate.
I too, must agree that this is an extremely shoddy treatment of a spectacular animated series.  My friend bought it and I borrowed it to see if it was worth having at all.  It isn't. It hurts to think that Warner Bros. doesn't think highly enough of its fans to treat such a gem of a show with such half hearted effort.  I won't go into the details, the other reviews are more than adequate in outling the complete absence of any redeeming value of this disc.
I fully support my disappointed comrades and will say that Fox will continue to get the bulk of my money on DVDs until Warner Bros. can come up with a box set release thats worthy of the Batman series.",1050883200,,739,4.264285714285714
1828528,2,B000087F7K,"The fact is Batman TAS did not have normal TV seasons. I think the first was 65 episodes. Way too many for a box set. And later seasons only amount to some thing like 20, 10 and 5. Releasing them one disc at a time is not the way to go either. The best way would to divide the first 65 into two voulmes, or something. The reason some of these first episodes on this disc are not the best is they are in order, so before the show got really good. I most likely will NOT get these, same as the first disc. It is just not worth the price. It has been a long time since I saw the show, but I would rather wait for the slim chance Warner Bros. will grow a brain!",1050796800,,657,3.802919708029197

7979636,4,B000087F7K,"""Batman - The Animated Series - Tales of the Dark Knight"" contains episodes 6 to 9. These are really good episodes that contain villains like The Joker and The Sewer King.

The episodes are:

6) The Underdwellers: This is a very Oliver Twist like tale, where children are made to work like slaves underground for the Sewer King. People think that leprechauns are stealing from them at night, but it is actually these homeless children. Batman captures a child and takes him to his mansion. He asks for information on the Sewer King, but the boy is unable to talk. Will Batman be able to find the Sewer King and save the kids in time?

I really liked this episode because of the well balanced action (fight with the crocodiles) and comic relief (Alfred trying to take care of the boy). (5/5).

7) P.O.V - This episode starts off with Officer Montoya and Officer Wilkes driving to an abandoned warehouse to meet Detective Bullock. Their operation is to catch a drug lord and his gang. However, by the time they reach there, the warehouse is on fire, and Bullock is outside, unconscious. Montoya and Wilkes go in to see if the gang is still in the warehouse. Afterwards, during the rest of the episode, the 2 officers and the detective narrate what they saw at the warehouse, but only one of them is telling the truth.

This is a very different and interesting episode, not because of its storyline, but because of the way it is told, through three people. (4/5).

8) Forgotten - Another wonderful episode! This episode starts with Bruce Wayne, working in a community center. He finds out that some of the volunteers and homeless people have been disappearing. Bruce wants to find out about the disappearance (because the police are not concerned about homeless people), so he disguises himself as a poor man and walks around the street corners. However, he is hit in the head by some thugs, and when he wakes up, he finds himself in some sort of a penitentiary headed by Boss Biggis, in the middle of nowhere. Even worse, he doesn't seem to remember who he is or where he's from!

The main reason I found this episode so good was because we get to see how Bruce Wayne would defend himself and fight crime as himself and not as Batman (5/5).

9) Be a Clown - Mayor Hill is holding a birthday party for his son, Jordan. However, Jordan feels disconnected with his father because his dad never spends time with him. He is interested in becoming a magician, but his father is too busy with his elections to know this. Meanwhile, The Joker has his own plans for ruining the Mayor's party. He dresses up as Jekko the Clown and comes to the party. Jordan is fascinated by Jekko and runs away with him to the circus. Will Batman be able to save Jordan from the Joker's evil schemes?

This episode is once again the fight between Batman and the Joker, and is another amazing episode! The Joker always puts Batman in situations where it seems impossible for Batman to escape from. The scene where Batman is suspended inside the water-filled box, and the rollercoaster scenes were great! (5/5)

Although these episodes are already in the volume seasonal box sets, if you are a fan of the show you can still buy this DVD. The quality of the episodes is, of course, in very good condition, except that they don't contain many extra features in them. Otherwise, if you would rather have all the episodes in one set, buy the 3 volumes released.",1119571200,8,3427,4.5667752442996745
7979637,4,B000087F7K,"Although I'm generally with the crowd that's clamoring for season-long box sets of this brooding, involving animated series, these single-disc offerings aren't all that bad.  In this case, for a few loose bills you get clean, sharp prints of episodes 6 to 9, a brief but interesting piece about the casting of the voice talent for the show, and nice intros to each episode by producer Bruce Timm.  Oh, yes-- you also get a little ""brain-teaser"" game to play, but even my forgiving self can't find it in his heart to praise THAT bit of byte-wasting silliness.
Anyway, I imagine the suits at Warner Brothers figured that the low price would encourage lots of casual purchasing by the parents-throwing-it-in-their-cart-for-the-kids demographic, while rabid fans would STILL pick these DVDs up even though they're not the juicy, packed-to-the-gills-with-extras multi-disc collections they're climbing the walls for.  And I guess that strategy is working, 'cause I'M a serious fan and I'm buying these DVDs.  But maybe there's a better solution that can please everyone: namely, do both types of products.  Sell inexpensive single-disc offerings like this one AND season-long boxed sets with premium extras.  Put 'em both in the marketplace and let people buy what they want.
But until that day comes, these DVDs could be worse.  At least the episodes are being released in chronological order, instead of being packaged in those horrible ""best of"" compilations that jump all over the map in time and leave huge gaps in your collection.",1055376000,9,1531,5.149193548387097
