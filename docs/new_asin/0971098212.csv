173621,5,0971098212,"Please forgive the ""pun"" in the Title of this review, but I couldn't resist :).

This ""Core Power Live"" tape by Baron Baptiste certainly lives up to it's title. It will really challenge your abs in a thorough and balanced way. He also counters the ab work with back bends which stretches out and opens the front part of the body while releasing and strengthing the back body.

While the primary focus of this tape is Abs, Baron starts w/ Sun Salutations so you are fully warmed up throughout your entire body before focusing on the core. He also ends w/ Foward bends, a lying twist and savasana (relaxation pose). The music continues long after the credits which is a nice touch if you decide to spend some extra time in savasana.

I highly recommend this tape for those who want a full body Yoga practice that is short enough to fit into anyones schedule and intense enough to challenge you.

Just one note.... regarding the criticism by another reviewer (this refers to a review of the VHS of this program) about the production being a mess..... I don't know what this person was looking for but I think this tapes production is perfect and captures the essence of the practice. It really feels like Baron is in the room with you leading you through the practice.

In fact I really love the live class setting which I find inspiring (and Baron shines more than ever in this setting) and his verbal cues are very easy to follow. I also like that Baron brings attention to different modifications of the various poses, which are demonstrated by various students during the class. An extra added feature is the music of Krishna Das which sets a great atmosphere to practice with.

By the way, check out Baron's other live tapes as well as his book ""Journey Into Power"". I easily lost about 17 pounds (all I needed to lose) at a safe but steady since using his cleansing diet and have learned a ton from the information in that book.

Also, check out Baron's sister Sherri Baptiste Freeman's Video ""Baptiste Power Of Yoga"" (see my detailed interview on amazon for more info). It is a wonderful, deep and unique approach on an intermediate level and Sherri's a wonderful teacher.

173622,4,0971098212,"I am new to Yoga and have been taking classes for only  4 months.  So, I am still a beginner. I would have given it 5 stars if they would demo or explain alternative positions for some of the more challenging poses, such as the camel.

Fortunately, since I have taken classes I knew how to modify them so as not to cause injury. Also I am a 46 year old petite woman in decent shape so even though this tape was challenging I was able to do most of it.  I would recommend watching this tape first then getting a book that shows modified poses for the beginners before trying this tape.  Or, go to YogaJournal.com and look up the poses for tips on modifications. You could hurt yourself if you are not a 20 something flexible person which I am not. I am flexible but no where near the level as most of the students in this class. The key is to listen to him and not over do it. If you can't reach the pose, get as close as possible where you ""don't feel pain"".  After all, nobody is watching you and I've found that little by little you will get better.

I did love this tape though and the feeling I had afterwards.  I worked up a sweat even with some of the modifications.  The pace is good and I liked the instructors pleasant and upbeat style. I've been taking Pilates and 60 minutes of core work is more than I can stand. I find Pilates in general to be boring and feel like a work out, but they are effective.

I prefer the mind-body connection Yoga provides. I also liked that this workout incorporates other poses for back strength.  This  variety provides a nice well rounded and energizing routine and in only 30 minutes.

I will look for more of his beginner DVDS.",1120262400,6,1673,4.223270440251572
173623,4,0971098212,"Just tried this one yesterday; it's a good little core practice to supplement a regular Baptiste routine.

173626,4,0971098212,"This video is part of Baron's Live! series: each video was filmed during a large, live class. Core Power is a shorter, more concentrated version of Baron's more lengthy practices such as Soul of Strength. Given that it is a power yoga workout, the practice moves along at a brisk pace, although Baron also builds in time for restoration throughout.
The practice begins with several sun salutations to warm up; each downward dog is held for several breaths. Following this, Baron skips standing poses and moves directly to the floor to focus on poses which engage the entire core area, particlarly the abdominals. Baron alternates between postures to stretch and lengthen the abs--e.g., bow, camel, bridge--and those that are designed to build strength, including crunches. At times, Baron moves quickly from pose to pose, but he uses postures like boat to provide longer, isometric contractions. The practice ends with a brief svasana, but since the music continues as the credits role, you could easily hold this relaxation pose for a longer period.
I really enjoy Baron's teaching style, which I find to be very accessible for all levels (although absolute beginners to yoga will want to learn the poses elsewhere). At 23 minutes, this is an excellent short practice for days when you have less time and/or when you want to focus specially on core work.",1084406400,,1355,5.0

173629,5,0971098212,"Between this tape and the ""living arts Pilates"" tapes my abs are flatter and stronger than ever!  This tape clocks in at about 20 minutes and it never lets up!  From the first sun salute to the spinal twist your work the abs or ""core"" an streeeetch out the back.  I would say this is best for intermediate yogis.  Some poses are tough. Just breathe. And, you will feel it the next day.  This is great to supplement a program, say combined with cardio.  Also, it's great to give to those people who say you can't get a ""workout"" through yoga.",996019200,12,541,4.306930693069307

173631,5,0971098212,i'm so glad I got to him and he is so spiritual that it is just what my body was looking for. He goes slow enough so you can do the post and you have time for adjustments.

173633,2,0971098212,I bought this dvd because I also purchased Unlocking Atheletic Power. The first half of the dvd was the same footage from Unlocking Atheletic Power.

173636,5,0971098212,"This is a wonderful practice session. It will help you build a powerful, strong core --- that includes the abs, back and even stronger upper and lower body. Baptiste is a great instructor who comes from a family of yoga instructors. He works with many celebrities and helps them achieve marvelous results.

Working the core is one of the best things you can do for your body. It's the center of all your strength.

Baron has a wonderful, soothing voice. The background music is a wonderful, soothing yoga chant and adds to the enjoyment of the practice. This is taped in a class setting with a number of students. Modifications are shown and you only need to work to your own capabilities. You'll get a lot out of this practice. You'll notice the burn in your core the next day if not sooner. You'll know you got a lot done in a short time without crunches and the danger to the back they present.

While this was done back in 2001, it's as good now as then. It's a beautiful and powerful practice that flows from one move to the next in a vinyasa.

The entire session runs about 23 minutes, including a lovely relaxation. I highly recommend this to you.

173637,3,0971098212,"My major complaint is this sequence felt like it was missing a thorough warmup.  Baron talks about warming up and the importance of it but fails to provide it.  At the beginning he quickly passes through 2 abbreviated Sun Salutations.  And moves immediately to poses that require thorough warmup.  I am accustomed to sweating by the time I am done with a yoga sequence, even a short one. In this one, in my cold living room, I started cold and ended almost luke warm.  With thoroughly warming sequences, I can start cold and end sweating hot.

The next time I do this sequence, I'll do my own Sun Sal's first and then begin the DVD.",1269734400,3,632,4.452173913043478

But Baron Baptiste's DVDs have provided me with the perfect alternative since I don't have a lot of yoga options in the town that I currently live.  I use this DVD and Unlocking Athletic Power, both of which were filmed live, and provide a great visual for modifying postures.  Baron's descriptions of the postures, and soothing voice make for a great practice.  After only 3 weeks I feel stronger, and with less joint and muscle pain that I was feeling before.  These practices are only a 1/2 hour long, so I'm able to start my day with the practice without having to get up an hour or two early.

He moves very fast during the salutations but it is not hard to get into the flow and it does warm up the body.

I personally prefer physically demanding Flow Routines challenging strength but still contributing to all the aspects of Yoga.

Beeing german my spelling is far from perfect, sorry for that!

About the DVD:

This is one more of Barons good short programms for the days inbetween when you can't practice 60 to 80 Minutes. It is 30 Minutes long and has a focus on the muscels of the Stomach and Back. It is still a complete Programm featuring Sunsalutations ( only A) and some twists and streches. The programm leaves you warm and energized but is not to hard to do. It will challange the Abs and the back but won't leave you exhausted.

It's a good programm for the morning. I highly recommend all of Barons short Routines since every one is somewhat different, aswell as his longer Programms. Baron is a very skilled, gentil and encouraging teacher giving his students a lot of important information in a calm and soothing manner. The Music of Krishna Das was a great pick for the Background.

A nice flow practice (ones again tis is true for all his programms) with beautifull Yoga Chant music. What else can a Yogi ask for?

I hope this was helpfull to you!
