7929891,3,B0000524F0,"'Ring around the Moon' is very poor... Story is muddled,thrown together,often makes no sense. Bad episode. Only saving grace is we see Carter/Koenig friendship develope which helps explain later episodes. 'Earthbound' is fantastic, a very good story,the music is totally revamped -otherwords GREAT!- Directors must have learned lessons from above episode. Characters are wonderful to watch.
'Another Time, Another Place', O.K. story, not bad, except alphans seem unnaturally hostile to Koenig/Carter. Music good.",999993600,,512,6.027397260273973
7929892,5,B0000524F0,"""Space:1999"" has been often overlooked and ridiculed by the
sci-fi mainstream, who claims it is dull, boring, and the scientific
concepts silly or uninformed. Add to that the early '70s hairstyles
and costumes, and you have a show that has never achieved the status
or respect it deserves.  The first season of ""Space: 1999""
was like watching ""2001"" every week, with surreal and
metaphysical concepts, pacing, photography, and lighting.
The music
is minimalist and yet descriptive in ways other sci-fi scores
aren't.
The miniatures on ""Space: 1999"" are still
fantastic (the Eagle!), and the special effects were cutting edge for
the day (all this without flashy computer animated FX, the crutch
propping up so many new sci-fi shows today).
The series was
surprisingly forward-thinking on gender issues, as the female
characters (despite occassionally freezing, screaming and fainting so
Keoning can rush into action), are shown as intellegent scientists and
mission controllers (unlike a certain beloved classic series where
women were often relegated to delivering the Captain's coffee and
opening hailing frequencies).
John Muir, who has written several
books about sci-fi and horror series (including ""Space:
1999""), likens the direction and visual design work to German
Expressionist film.
Whatever in the series is dated, or lacking
Captain Kirk-like action, is far outweighed by the intellegence of the
stories, the maturity of the acting, and the level of pure sci-fi the
Andersons produced in Year One of the show.
This set includes more
stunning episodes from Year One of the two season
series.
""Missing Link"", ""Guardian of Piri"",
""Force of Life"", ""Alpha Child"", ""The Last
Sunset"", and ""Voyager's Return"" are perfect examples of
the surreal style, original set design, expressionist lighting,
brilliant miniatures and special effects work, and the overall unique
achievement that was ""Space: 1999"".",975628800,12,1907,5.48639455782313
