7013450,3,B00TLXIM8E,"Othell (Charles S. Dutton) is a recovering alcoholic who is attempting to get his life back, making up with his family and getting his job back. He finds more support from friends than family. Othell is not the kind of drunk who beat his wife or molested his daughter, but the kind that missed his dad's funeral...okay he did punch a stranger in a bar. Yet, for some reason his crimes are unforgivable and overly damaging which I found hard to fathom. Established actress Tatyana Ali played Nima the daughter in a poorly scripted part which she had difficulty in making believable.

The entire film had a made for TV feel, from the cliche plot down to the soundtrack.

7013451,1,B00TLXIM8E,"Ive been a fan of Charles S. Dutton since the first time I saw him in the TV series ROC. Hes always had the ability to make me believe he was the character he was playing, something that all actors should hope to achieve. When I saw he was in this movie I had hopes even though it looked like a made for cable movie. Those hopes were dashed with each passing minute of the film.

Dutton plays Othell, a jazz piano player haunted by the sins of his past. A recovering alcoholic 3 months sober hes now trying to make up for that as his daughter is about to marry. Approaching her soon to be husband, he attempts a reconciliation with the young woman who deals with the situation by refusing to talk about it. Eventually he breaks down that wall and gets her to agree to accompany him with her fianc to his mothers birthday.

At the party that takes place over a weekend things go from bad to worse as this family of successful brothers and sisters achievements are rubbed in the face of the struggling Othell. It puts a different perspective on the situation for his daughter but she still holds a grudge because of the past. Whether or not she will finally allow Othell back into her life as her wedding approaches is yet to be seen but lets be honest, as much as this seems a made for TV movie I think we all know the result.

Its not that this movie stinks because it is a made for TV film. There are tons of those out there that have done amazing jobs of entertaining and bringing something new to the table. This is not one of those films. Dutton does another amazing job in the role of Othell but thats about the only thing you can say good about the movie. I don't usually single out one bad performance but the worst thing about this movie is exactly that in what is offered by Tatyana Ali in the role of Nima, Othells daughter. While this actress has a long list of credits to her name you would never know it watching this film. Her performance here ranks alongside those of just about any junior high school performance of a first time actress. Im guessing she is much better than this but somehow, some way, her performance here doesnt do much to help that thought.

I could excuse that performance due to her age but the same cant be said of the one turned in by Loretta Devine as Othells sister Malinda. Its as if there were either no director in charge of this movie, Devine decided that she would ignore the director or someone told her that over acting would make her stand out. If it was the last suggestion then they were correct, she does stand out and not in a good way.

A lackluster film, a cast that needs direction and a story that never seems to pop make this a movie to avoid. Then again if you like bad made for TV movies perhapsno not even then. Instead flip on Lifetime and see which spouse is abusing/killing the other in tonights movie of the week.",1436313600,3,2878,4.273394495412844
7013452,5,B00TLXIM8E,A great movie to watch!!!,1434240000,,25,4.2
7013453,4,B00TLXIM8E,"Thank you Falco Ink for sending us this DVD to review!

Not everyone grows up with a perfect family.  Many kids are raised by a single parent, and in most cases it's the mother.  It was the opposite for me as I grew up fast when my mother ran off when I was a teenager.  Comeback Dad struck a chord with me as I chose to forgive and reconcile with my mom. I was curious if the daughter, Nina, would do the same for her absentee father (Charles Dutton) in this movie.

I won't spoil the ending in this review.  Nina is an up and coming composer who learned from her father on how to play the piano.  Her successful fianc, Spence, loves her despite knowing that she can't trust him fully due to her broken relationship with her father.  Spence encourages her to make amends before their wedding and that includes an out of state trip to meet her estranged family.

Unfortunately, this movie reinforces the false teachings of works to earn a person's way to heaven.  Nina mentions getting double heaven points for making the trip to see her family.  The Bible clearly teaches in Ephesians 2:8 and in Romans 9:16 that it is by God's grace alone that we are saved, not by our works.

There are both emotional and humorous moments and overall this movie was enjoyable to watch.  Even though it has themes of redemption and forgiveness, it's not suited for a younger audience.  This film is not rated, but it does have some language, sexual references and situations, as well as drinking and drunkenness.

If you don't mind the moral short comings, the overall story is worth checking out.  It's worth renting at the very least.",1434153600,11,1621,4.5
7013454,3,B00TLXIM8E,it was a good movie but hard for anyone who had to grow up like this true to life women can be a trip sometimes,1462320000,,111,3.48

7013456,5,B00TLXIM8E,Great movie.  A real display of what goes on between custodial and non-custodial parts.  How the child is impact by the conflict.  AWESOME MOVIE!!!!!!,1458259200,,150,5.166666666666667
7013457,2,B00TLXIM8E,"I was shocked to see that Russ Par made this mess, esp. with veteran actors in this movie.  I really liked ""3"" of his movies; ""35 & Ticking,"" ""Love For Sale,"" & ""Last Stand,"" so when I saw his name on this movie I expected it to be good also but how wrong I was. The movie is only 1 hr & 28 min & within that short time there was a big mess & there are at least ""5"" scenes that made no sense at all.

Charles Dutton (great veteran actor) is the father who hasn't seen his daughter (great veteran actor, Tatyana Ali) in over 10 yrs because he was an alcoholic who abandoned his family. He comes back to make amends; the daughter wants nothing to do with him. He stalks her fiance'; (how he even knows who he is & found him I don't know). Anyway, he goes to his office to tell him who he is & tries to convince him to get his daughter to meet with him.

Fiance' tells his girlfriend her father came to his office; she's pissed off & tells her fiance' to leave when he suggests that she meet with her father because she's not interested whatsoever. While the father was in the office he saw on the fiance's large, dry erase board that he was meeting his daughter at a restaurant so he shows up & she storms out; pissed off; without speaking to him at all. Father shows up at fiance's job again & asks him if he will ask daughter if she will come to Atlanta with him to his mother's 80th birthday.

I can't tell the entire movie because that's too much writing so I'll sum it up & you'll have to look at the entire movie yourselves to fill in the rest of the mess. Here's where the train wreck begins; after already not speaking to her father at all because she's pissed that he abandoned her for over 10 yrs & after not speaking to him at the restaurant; we go to a scene where the fiance' has clearly convinced her to go to Atlanta because she's meeting with her father & she, the fiance' & the father are all getting in the same car heading to Atlanta. WTH?

She still hasn't said 1 word to him; he's sitting in the back seat & there was not 1 word spoken between the two of them the entire ride. Now ""who does that"" & how does this make sense?  Daughter is ""Sooooo Pissed Off & Hostile"" that she still isn't speaking to her father; yet she will agree to go to Atlanta with her father to his mother's birthday (her grandmother); who she hasn't seen in forever & who she is also pissed off at because she felt the grandmother and the rest of the family on her father's side abandoned her also. WTH?

Okay, now they're at his mother's & his mother is excited to see her granddaughter because she knows about the estranged relationship.  The  daughter does speak to the grandmother but she's still not speaking to her father (even though she agreed to ride in the same damn car with him all the way to Atlanta & also agreed to stay overnight at the house). Again, WTH?

This is such a mess it's hard to wrap this up but I have to because I didn't intend to do all of this typing. Now they're back home; daughter is having a very small get-together where she's playing the piano for family/friends. Fiance' suggests father comes; she says ""No,"" she doesn't want him there (yet mind you, she drove all the way to Atlanta with him). Fiance' invites him anyway behind her back then tells her before she gets ready to perform.

She decides to be okay with the father coming & Russ decides to write in the script that this man who is so desperate for another chance to get back in good with his daughter ""doesn't even show up to the recital after he told the fiance' he would be there."" I mean really, why would Russ write something that trifling in the script without even writing in a good justification?

The daughter, mother & fiance' went to the father's house after the event to see why he didn't show up & Russ had the father yell out something absolutely ridiculous; ""I didn't have anything to give her!"" That's what Russ had this man say. WTH?  What the hell do you need to give somebody after they play the damn piano at a small, tired gathering for family & friends?  Hell, it wasn't a bridal or baby shower where you give gifts or a big event where you give flowers after a performance. Bottom line, that was a ridiculous line & a ridiculous justification to write in the script.

Now if he meant ""he didn't have anything to give of himself"" & he's not talking about a gift; that was ""still ridiculous"" because he knew he didn't have anything to give when he stalked his daughter's fiance' to beg him to get his daughter to meet with him. He also knew that when he asked his daughter to go to his mother's 80th birthday party in Atlanta. Now; when he has a chance to maybe get in good with his daughter; he decides to screw that up by being ""Super Trifling"" & not show up.  Again, WTH?

Let me wrap this up because I'm tired of typing & I'm getting disgusted all over again because this was a waste of talent used in this movie. I was watching & waiting for it to get better; for the action and/or drama to kick in & ""it wasn't happening.""  I saw it was almost over & I just couldn't believe it!  The script was whack & I'm very disappointed since I know Russ is capable of much better.

Okay; moving on; now it's the ""daughter's wedding day.""  Russ decided to have the mother tell her she had been lying about her father being trifling all of those yrs & he had been sending her letters & money.  Really Russ, on her ""wedding day?""  You thought it was a good idea to have the bride's head messed up ""right before"" she walked down the aisle?  I know that adds drama but come on now. So now she has a trifling; inconsiderate father & mother to think about on her wedding day.

Here's the kicker, now that the mother has told her daughter the truth about her father; even though the daughter had just told him off for not showing up to her boot-leg piano recital; and even though he wasn't invited to the wedding, he is now walking her down the aisle along with the mother in whatever suit he wore to the wedding. WTH?

Okay, I know the message in the movie is ""forgiveness"" & I know there are some people who are quick to forgive because that's their nature. With that said; here we have a hostile daughter who is at ""level 10 of hostility;"" she didn't speak to her father at all except to tell him off when he didn't show up to her tired recital; yet now he's walking her down the aisle.

So we are to conclude that because she felt bad for her father because her mother lied about him for all of those years; she decided to just let all of her hostility go; even though it was ""mighty trifling"" for him not to show up at that recital without a good justification. Yes, I suppose this is the conclusion we will have to go with.

In closing, I want to make sure I give credit to (great veteran actor), Loretta Devine for bringing some excitement to this slow-moving script with her role as the fiesty, dramatic sister of Charles Dutton. She's his sister who is still pissed off at him after many years for being an alcoholic and a big disappointment to the family.",1457913600,,7065,4.224944320712694
7013458,5,B00TLXIM8E,The most powerful movie that I have seen about the lack of fatherhood and the damage that it does to your life,1453852800,,110,4.045454545454546
7013459,5,B00TLXIM8E,"Best movie I've watched this month.  This movie teaches you that even though you and your spouse get divorced, the parent that gets custody of the child should not try to keep the child and the other parent from having a relationship due to anger because of the divorce.  A child should keep a relationship with both parents, which in my opinion, will cheat the child out of growing up knowing the love of both parents.",1453420800,,419,4.5
7013460,5,B00TLXIM8E,"Acting was phenomenal. Had me crying, laughing, hoping,etc. I defintely can relate. It just serves as a reminder how much people can hurt the ones they love. Yet,  that does not so them from being loved by the ones they hurt. Love is the most powerful thing in the universe. This beautifully written story captures this in a way that anyone can relate. I highly recommend this movie. Especially for those going through similar situations.",1450396800,2,438,4.84
7013461,4,B00TLXIM8E,"The movie in total is not that good, but there are scenes in it that are wonderful and elicit genuine emotion. Charles Dutton is an amazing actor, and it was good to see him on screen again. The actors who portray his mother and younger brother have two scenes with Dutton that are just too funny, and Loretta Devine does an outstanding job as Othell's sister. The only downside is Tatyana Ali. She seemed to be struggling throughout the entire film and never quite finds her role. The scenes with her and her catty friends are awful; the scenes with her fianc were almost painful to watch. Perhaps it was the material she just couldn't handle, I'm not sure. Her performance left much to be desired. She nearly ruined the movie for us. Other than that, I'd recommend giving it a try. Sure, it's made for tv but it works for an afternoon at home with the family.",1450051200,,861,4.455696202531645

A lot of women that didn't have the healthiest relationships with their fathers can identify and even IF that wasn't your life still there's a HUGE lesson to learn.

8702339,2,B00TLXIM8E,"I watched this movie for the first time a couple of years ago. I wanted to like it. I tried to like it. I purchased it and watched it again. But I'm sorry! This movie has no soul. There's no warmth. No connection between any of the characters. All of the relationships seem very superficial or shallow. This is a movie about a Black family, but there's no affection, no passion, no flavor, just canned emotion, like a movie about a WASP family with very dark tans. (At the risk of insulting WASPs everywhere.) Frustrating!
I love Charles Dutton. He is so real. Loretta Devine is truly divine in her willingness to be vulnerable, the butt of a joke, unglamorous, and still skilled enough to shine as a passionate, powerful actor. But, unfortunately, they could not carry the whole film.
My favorite line was the grandmother's, when she smiled sweetly and said, ""Not in my house."" Those are the values that are proud part of our heritage.
Tatyana Ali, although a beauty, just bored me to death!",1517616000,,992,4.610169491525424
8702340,2,B00TLXIM8E,"On the surface the story appears to be about the reconciliation of father and daughter. The story is REALLY about how unforgiving, hard-hearted, silly, b-slapping black women won't give a down on his luck black men a break -- except for his mama.

There is zero attention to what destroyed the father/daughter relationship in the first place. Nothing is said about what her father was like as a father sans the alcoholism.

It never occurs to the film maker that the father  character might have been a better human being while drunk and a worse on while sober. That the father's absence from the daughter's life could have  best thing about him. Respect for women as adults and as girl children is nothing in this film.

This movie is only interesting for one reason: It gives insight into how SOME black men and women see SOME black men's soul crushing behavior as small, that their REAL feelings hidden inside should be assumed to be good---therefore all ugly actions should be  forgiven without the truth telling required for repentance  just Im sorry.

The title of this movie should have been -- In Defense Of Horrible Fathers Who Need Cheap Forgiveness

The movie starts off with the daughters fiance saying what HE WANTS for himself  which is a woman that has  a good relationship with her father.  Again, it's made clear that the relationship between father and daughter is irrelevant. The fathers character with and without alcohol- is irrelevant

The ultimate message of this movie comes 19 minutes before the end. The daughter says, ""I'm a mess because of you. i can't love my finance the way I want you because of you. I am curt, mean, and dissatisfied with life because of you. I so desperately wanted to be a Daddy's girl...""

The message is black girls and black women are nothing without black men. Sorry. Not true.

Yeah, I think a child is better off with two parents, with a man modeling what manhood looks like so a girl chooses boyfriends and husbands wisely etc. But sometimes a man is much less than a man should be -- not due to his lack of income and prestige AS THE FILM IMPLIES BLACK WOMEN BELIEVE

Single mothers raise strong heroic children every single day. Two parent families raise dysfunctional mean-spirited children every single day too.

**SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT**

The only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of 1 is because there was a shallow moment there at grandmas house where Loretta Divine discloses how different people looking at the same thing have very different perspectives on who is love and appreciated and who is not and choices. But even in this moment the sexism of the film maker/ writer shows up.

But I really should have made this movie one star due to the ending. The mother is ultimately blamed for allowing her own bitterness to be the true cause of the father/daughter rift. The mother gives a very, very small packet of cards to the daughter symbolizing that the father did try to contact her at least twice a year ---which irritates me because...

1) this shows that the threshold of a ""trying father"" is so low as compared to a ""trying mother"" and
2) the film makers assume there's no value in a woman making a choice about whether or not a show up twice-a-year father is better than a completely-gone father on the child's mental and emotional health

In other words, the film makers don't seem to understand that bitterness and pettiness is not the only reason a woman cuts a show-up -when-he-feels-like- it man out of a child's life. The film makers seem to think that a man's presence in a child's life, no matter how feeble, is good. And that's not necessarily true.

In truth, this entire movie was a vehicle to show how unappreciated black men are, how much more difficult black life is for them than any other black body. Not only did the mother confess to being bitter and breaking up her and the father by not passing on his twice a year letters and gifts, she was pressed by grown man's mama to do it during her daughter's wedding. AND the daughter is grateful because nothing is more important than how the father feels about himself after having recovered from alcoholism......recovered for a whole 3 months.

I hope the film makers  (and the writer) get therapy so they can learn respect for girls and women. That's the only way they'll make a movie that isn't a hot mess in the future.

Final rating 1.5 stars.",1512864000,,4404,4.644329896907217
