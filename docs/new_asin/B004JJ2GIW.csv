So often, children move down with their parents from far away, and are not taught to appreciate the real Florida. I particularly liked the section on Puma concolor coryi, the Florida panther; it drove home how secretive these beautiful top-tier predators are, and how essential they are to maintaining a healthy balance in wildlife populations.",1453420800,,448,5.0675675675675675
8431909,5,B004JJ2GIW,"My son loves animals so I thought this would be perfect for him. After watching it with him, I know it was the right choice and I am so pleased with my purchase. It's not only informative but entertaining as well. It held the interest of both myself, my husband and my son.",1324252800,,273,4.169811320754717
8431910,5,B004JJ2GIW,"It had a wealth of information about the animals in the state that was very helpful to my son who was going to have to do a report.  Although he did not watch the whole thing, he found enough great and accurate stuff that he got an 'A' on the paper.  I will enjoy watching the rest of it, even if he doesn't.",1323907200,2,308,3.873015873015873
8431911,5,B004JJ2GIW,"I bought the Wild Florida set and it is actually very good and quite informative. It was produced by Miami public television and - like a lot of their programming - is very high quality and well researched. I suspect the disappointed reviewer that gave it one star was simply not aware that the Florida Panther is in fact simply a sub species of the American Cougar (Puma Concolor). It is called a panther because that's its local name. However, just to be clear, Panther, Painter, Mountain Lion, Catamount, and various other local names have been used to describe the American Cougar. While we're on the subject, I might as well also point out that the ""Black Panther"" in nothing more than a melanistic (black) Leopard or Jaguar. As far as the shots of the Florida Panther (American Cougar) go, it's a very rare animal in the wild, and only about 100 individuals are in existence. Therefore, the station choose to use film of captured animals.
I gave it 5 stars because it's very informative and describes Florida's wildlife in great detail.",1323907200,,1042,4.730769230769231
8431912,5,B004JJ2GIW,"I saw parts of this on a PBS station in Florida and found it to be very entertaining.  I liked the footage of all the different animals in Florida, and who would have though there were so many.  The quality of the footage was great.",1323907200,2,232,4.133333333333334
8431913,1,B004JJ2GIW,"I bought this dvd because I couldn't find any other with footage of Panthers. There are no images available before buying it (except for the Front Cover), so I took a chance on it, thinking Crocs, Panthers and Manatees would be very interesting.

When I started watching the Panthers section (the film is divided in 3) I realized that it was actually a Mountain Lion, or a Puma, thery were talking about. Once playing, you'll see that one of the animal's names is ""Florida Panthers"" So then, why don't the PRODUCT DETAILS as well as the PRODCUT FEATURES say so specifically? Instead, they both say: ""panthers"". This was kind of dissapointing to me.

I still opted to give the film a chance, since it was in my hands, and it was truly dissapointing. The bad thing is, you don't get to actually see the animals in their habitat, but rather you see a bunch of scientists and vets just talking non-stop for about 15 minutes before showing some footage of some caged mountain lions! Going to the zoo is much much better! I think this is a terrible dvd for those interested in watching Wildlife.

I found PBS' ""NATURE: REVEALING A LEOPARD"" as well as National Geographic's ""EYE OF THE LEOPARD"" much more entertaining and informative. These aforementioned films are of great quality in content and footage and if you like those kind of dvd's you'll regret buying this one as I did.",1311206400,5,1374,4.6460905349794235
