8438549,1,B001EK1GBC,"I bought this DVD as I was curious about the spiritual difference of the animals being taken care of by a master. However, Ching Hai has showed how much she loves herself by buying and keeping birds in cages, telling parrot that it is a heavy chicken just to amuse herself, giving unhealthy food(eg. toast with butter)to dogs, not truly concern about animals' health on daily basis. She's just a show-off, flaunting her wealth with huge land, trees and houses. She can't even speak properly, no substance with all baby talk only. I shall never buy anything from her, feel cheated for buying this piece of garbage!!",1283904000,2,614,4.747663551401869

The poems and the narrative are quite simple but very deep and rich with the sweetest affection and purest love. I think it changed not only the way I look at animals but also the way I look at fellow humans.",1221523200,2,298,4.067796610169491

The deep devotion, fun and loving interactions between the Supreme Master and her pets move me to tears every time I watch this love-permeated piece. The care-free and soul-touching intimacy... isn't that something we all long for?  How to truly love, respect, and honor other beings... in all aspects?  The Supreme Master Ching Hai sets a brilliant example for all. A must see, in this much-needed world.",1221436800,6,462,4.910256410256411
