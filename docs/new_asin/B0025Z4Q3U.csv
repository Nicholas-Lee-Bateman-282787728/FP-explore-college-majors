3850178,5,B0025Z4Q3U,I did not know that this kind of treatment was still happening to the Native American .  It made me cry!,1378425600,2,104,3.9523809523809526
3850179,5,B0025Z4Q3U,This DVD will make you mad so be forewarned. Basically it tells the story of two western Shoshone sisters who are harassed by the BLM (Bureau of Land Management) for phoney baloney. The sisters graze their cattle and horses on their lands promised by treaties. The BLM see's it different. They claim the Shoshone do not own the land. The gist of this sad story is gold in the area and the intentions of mining for gold. The BLM uses every tactic to protect and represent the intentions of the mining companies. This is the same ole stuff multiplied by 100.,1370476800,7,556,4.514851485148514
3850180,5,B0025Z4Q3U,"I am a USAF veteran 9yrs plus, and I am sickened by the treatment of native americans within the United States borders.  It's funny that Canada practices the same injustices against its indigenous people.  Maybe I should feel fortunate for being treated better than the native americans living here on US soil before the USA was established, but it's pretty easy to see the injustice of it all.  When will native americans be truly given some respect by the US government, and protection of their rights even on their reservations, enforced - federally (the states can't even enforce state workers to behave), they've earned it as indigenous people of the land.",1369958400,15,661,4.936936936936937
3850181,5,B0025Z4Q3U,"The Western Shoshones had their land taken away by the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Why? Because gold was found on their land. Would the BLM give the gold to the tribe? No. After destroying the Shoshone land using open pit mining, the gold belonged to the corporations that were destroying their land. This is what is known as Capitalism: take from the poor and give to the rich.
The indigenous people of North America did not believe that  people should own land. Why? Because the land belongs to everybody living there. This is what is known as Socialism, an evil word to many Americans, but not to the Shoshone tribe.
So what did the Shoshones do? They asked the United Nations to stop the destruction of their land by the mining company. Human Rights Watch supported them.
The 56 minute documentary American Outrage uses beautiful cinematography and unforgettable characters in telling their story. Highly recommended.",1362096000,16,929,4.917197452229299
3850182,5,B0025Z4Q3U,"""American Outrage"" is a powerful video. When one thinks of the atrocities perpetrated against Native Indians- land grabbing, reneging on treaties, stealing of livestock and one's ability to make a living, you think of 19th century and prior. You don't think about it happening NOW. This amazing video should be shown in classrooms to show the injustice that is still happening today. I'd give it 10 stars and beyond if I could.",1361923200,16,427,4.944444444444445
3850183,5,B0025Z4Q3U,"I had the pleasure of seeing this film at a live presentation by Chris Sewall in Brunswick Maine in the winter of 2010. Being from the west and a Metis  I am part Apache, Sioux, and French) I should have known more about the plight of my Shoshone sisters. I was shocked, even as a educated Matis in Indian-Native affairs, at the harshness by the USG inflicted on Carrie and Mary in the film.

Chris Sewall is a major contributor to the success of the movies message about the continued and extremely bitter battle over and land rights of the Shoshone people in the west. His presentation and Q&A session after the movie was both educational and moving! Clearly, the motives of Sewall are honorable and selfless as he brings to light the importance of cross cultural understanding from coast to coast of the United States. Sewall heralds from a long line of Mainer's who devoted their lives to ship building and sea fairing in the historical Bath, Maine. Not the most likely champion for Native rights issues which made his involvement with the Shoshone's land war with the USG so compelling. Hearing his first hand accounts of the events surrounding the land issues of Carie and Mary added a personal dimension to the movie.

This film should be introduced into every high school and college as a staple of native rights, human rights, and US government's failures to recognize them in the USA.",1318377600,32,1394,4.704918032786885
3850184,4,B0025Z4Q3U,Good coverage of a bad situation.  It IS outrageous that  this can even go on in our country.  It is so difficult for people to stand up for their rights - it's admirable.  Well-covered I think.,1297036800,16,194,4.305555555555555
3850185,5,B0025Z4Q3U,"Many Americans will acknowledge now that the United States' treatment of indigenous people was horrific, even genocidal. However, most Americans think that ""that's all in the past,"" and that Indians/Native Americans are being treated as equals now, and most certainly, that the massive U.S. theft and retraction of promises (such as treaties) that used to occur doesn't anymore.

This movie documents in vivid, moving, and irrefutable ways that such despicable practices still occur. People in the U.S. who bother to think about these things often feel superior to the Spanish conquerors of the Americas; we think of them now as obsessively in pursuit of gold, and all too willing to slaughter any native people who got in their way. But today's U.S. government, in the service of corporate interests, is doing the same thing--and they're doing it for gold, too. They're basically starving Shoshone Indians into submission so the gold underneath their land can be extracted. And to think (as this film points out) that 80% of that gold goes into jewelry! We talk about blood diamonds--what about blood gold?

See ""American Outrage,"" and then get outraged, and then get involved in fighting the earth-killing lust for gold and filthy profit. You could start, as I did, by asking your local video stores and library to purchase this DVD.",1294358400,134,1335,5.091324200913242
3850186,5,B0025Z4Q3U,I loved this film. I think everyone should see this film. It blew me away and has stayed with me ... I hope to be able to help in some way to resolve these issues and bring healing. I will be meditating on this film for awhile and recommending it to everyone I know all over the planet! Exceptional work. I am glad history has this cinematic record for the generations to come!,1269820800,41,377,4.178082191780822
3850187,5,B0025Z4Q3U,This is a moving documentary about two Western Shoshone Indian grandmothers who have been fighting for their land for most of their adult lives.  The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has been mistreating them and their land even though the women  have been sanctioned by the United Nations. There is no excuse for the greed exhibited by the government and their destruction of the land.,1266624000,60,385,4.907692307692308

My heart broke for those poor, elderly, Native American, women-ranchers watching as the BLM rounded up & took their lively-hood.  As a ""white"" rancher, we would damn angry!!  The damn government found all kinds of ways to make it harder'n'harder to ranch until we finally sold to get away from the hassles.  That and the ignorant, damn, off-the-wall, environmentals w/their crazy ideas!  They didn't give a damn about people but only THEIR IDEAS!
They shut down a place in Arizona that many of the Navajos had jobs there.  Did the ""environ's"" care?  Hell, no!!  They think they know all there is to know about the environment w/o listening to the Native Americans and ""white"" ranchers trying to tell them how to best work the land so that things are better for the animals.  They simply we were too dumb & ignorant because we didn't hold a ""degree"" but time showed we knew how to take care of the land simply by how pristine it was!!!  Did they look at it that way?  Hell, no!!  Because it would blow all their crazy theories all to hell!!

3850199,5,B0025Z4Q3U,"I live in the country and you can see the absolute beauty of the High Desert where there is 'nothing' - often as far as the eye can see - so the visuals alone make this a 3-4 star movie - the 5 comes from what the Media depicted as 'defiant' Indians 'breaking treaty rights' -- spun about 180 degrees from what the truth is.  How the sisters were treated by the Media at the time made me sick, and angry enough that I simply stopped paying attention - and then, to my horror, the end of the story - or as Paul Harvey would say - ""and now the rest of the story"" - and it hit me so hard in my gut, that it was like a physical blow.  And as if we haven't broken enough promises and Treaties -- this is EXACTLY why we need to get rid of Citizens United - Corporations are NOT people - they have no heart -- but they have blood as green as any money you have ever seen, and they give it freely to politicians.  If THIS does not move you to 'vote the bums out' -- if you cannot see the transfusion of money for blood -- then I would lump you with 'them' and generalize that you will find nothing of Beauty nor of injustice, rape, pillage, and violence in this short one hour video -- ""Move along, there is nothing to see here"".",1461628800,,1221,3.9552845528455283

3850216,5,B0025Z4Q3U,"I watched this to try to better understand what some of the complaints were about the BLM and the accusations that they were involved in land grabs.  I had not realized that some of the Shoshone had ran into difficulties with them too.  Some of this footing was quite shocking to me.  There's a man who douses himself with gasoline in protest of a BLM roundup.  I had read a book on the wild horse situation from another woman, in another state, and yet the complaints were almost identical- round ups conducted in seasons that were bad for the mother/babies in the herds, aggressive roundups that left animals starving and dying, that sort of thing.  I'd heard about it, but this documentary shows the dead animals, and that's pretty powerful.

The BLM didn't really get to speak, and I really wish that more information had been given about the gold mining operation and how it was approved and how was being paid for it.  There was a LOT missing from this documentary, but it was short, and it was informative.  This documentary focused mainly on two Shoshone grandmothers, and I appreciated hearing the native wisdom that they discussed.  It definitely brought a spiritual aspect to the land ownership question, and helped me to better understand the passion that people have over it.",1454198400,,1288,4.7657657657657655

They and other tribes have suffered at the hands of the treaty breakers.  Unfortunately, to think that dialogue with the powers that be is going to make a difference is a dream.  There are just too many powerful greedy corporations that want to destroy the land for a profit.  Check out what has happened to the Navajo and other native American tribes.  It really is sickening.  Treaty breakers never cease.  Also, tribes have placed their trust in some tribal leaders who may have betrayed them for financial gain.  Do some research on what is happening and has happened to other so-called treaties that were based on trust by the native American tribes.  Somebody perverts the language to mean something other than its original intent and more rights are lost.  God bless those who continue to fight for their rights.",1449360000,,945,4.85

They've lost much of it, hundreds of their livestock STOLEN by our government, yet they continue to struggle for the sake of their children and their future, against the greatest of odds, not accepting defeat.

3850254,5,B0025Z4Q3U,"THE LAWS ARE IN THE FAVOR OF THE GUY WITH THE MONEY TO BUY THE VOTES IN THE LEGISLATURE.
If you are a working person or hold title to an asset that is valuable, you can be sure the government will never be on your side. The American Indians have lost every bit of their land each time they trusted a treaty.

3850255,5,B0025Z4Q3U,"When will this end? The government that is supposed to represent all of us, certainly does not in the shameful treatment of Shoshone people, as presented in this film.",1415491200,2,167,4.793103448275862
3850256,5,B0025Z4Q3U,Makes you stop and think about what our government is really about.  People who suffer right here in the good old US of A.  Democracy?? or righteous take over for the good of the government.,1411344000,,190,4.4
3850257,4,B0025Z4Q3U,"I bought this film because I saw it on Free Speech TV and liked it.  I have lived relatively close to several reservations in my lifetime, and currently work for a Native American now.  I have always enjoyed their sense of humor and their quiet dignity, and I have also had the opportunity to work for the BLM.  So this film was enlightening to me as well as all too familiar.  It was also ultimately positive and hopeful.  I gave my background because if you are interested in Native American issues and culture, or if you're interested in the politics of the west, or what is going on with mineral extraction in this country, I think this is a good movie to see.  You will learn something from it.  If you aren't interested, in these issues, or have a more Conservative outlook, then you probably won't like this movie.",1408838400,3,821,4.469798657718121
3850258,5,B0025Z4Q3U,Unbelievable that our government can tell these noble people that they are destroying the land by grazing their livestock on it and then turn around and allow mining companies to not only destroy the land but make the water undrinkable. Every American needs to see this film. Every American needs to voice their outrage at what is being done. 20 tons of toxic waste for one ring of gold. Do we need gold so much that it is worth destroying our environment to get it? What happens when all of the gold has been mined and we are left with land that is poisoned and unusable? Is it really worth it?,1407888000,,595,4.36936936936937

3850261,5,B0025Z4Q3U,Now don't it make one proud to know rather than act on UN advise. We do exactly what we accuse other nations of doing.  Helps explain some of the recent developments out west. This film helps shine some light how our Government will pick and choose what laws it wants to enforce. What is your Government doing it is protecting big money interests.,1403827200,,347,4.507936507936508
3850262,5,B0025Z4Q3U,"Two sisters had a small block of land.  They used to graze their animals on the native land they lived next too.  They were native Indians of America and it was their reservation.  No problem right?  Big problem when the women just happened to live on land that was on top of one of the biggest known gold mines.  Well told, well presented.  A bit of reality everyone needs to see and some hear the justice these people fought for.  Very good.",1397779200,3,443,4.329268292682927

I bought it for his Christmas present.  We've watched it several times since.  It makes me angry and hopeful at the same time. It is a very well done story.

8351510,5,B0025Z4Q3U,"While not a movie one wants to watch often, it is an excellent documentary about how native americans are still being marginalized and treated with no respect as less than 2nd class citizens in many parts of the U.S. To watch this movie is heart breaking for any feeling, compassionate person who recognizes that all people are children of the same God, regardless of their race, religion, or background.",1470355200,,404,4.869565217391305
