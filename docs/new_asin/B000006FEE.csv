8277249,5,B000006FEE,"Kenny Rogers scored a hit with his single ""Coward Of The County"" and the song was such a big hit a spin-off movie was created. It is enteraining, just like his other movies. Rogers plays a preacher and his nephew's father died when he was ten years old and promised his father he wouldn't use fighting to prove he was a man. If you know the song then you know the rest. This is a really good production and most should find it enjoyable.",1132617600,6,437,4.214285714285714
