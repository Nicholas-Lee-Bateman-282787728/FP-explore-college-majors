3663802,5,B001K98MLO,"Overall it didn't take long to ship, it was a great price for the whole box set! I most say that the box that it came in was flawless. I really have nothing bad to say about it. Every disc works great without skipping. I shall come back if I need another copy lol",1262822400,,263,3.888888888888889
3663803,4,B001K98MLO,"I have to say that after having seen a few episodes of this show randomly on Cartoon Network a while back I was skeptical about what it had to offer. But I will say that after watching the whole series through I changed my mind about it. It had a very original story behind it. A post apocalyptic world where wolves are believed to have been hunted to extinction by the Nobles (a ruling class in the world who still remember some of the old science from before the Apocalypse) because of a story that claims that the door to ""Paradise"" will only be found by wolves and once they find paradise the world we know will end. However the wolves are not extinct, they just learned how to make themselves appear human. The story follows Kiba and three other wolves, who follow him for differing reasons, as they make their way out of the city in search of paradise. Along the way there are a few human characters that have big parts in the show as well and they all do the usual human thing of having realizations about the problems that humanity caused or being just plain crazy. All in all I would recommend this to anyone who is either a true anime fan or people who like anime that is specifically about the trials and tribulations of man, since the wolves are usually seen in human form and deal with very human like problems. And if you aren't sure whether you would or wouldn't like this anime I would suggest renting it from netflix or borrowing from someone you know who already has it because I am pretty sure that once you see the show you will buy it. And if not I guess this type of show just isn't for you.",1256947200,11,1613,4.2918032786885245
3663804,4,B001K98MLO,"I bought these CDs for my daughter, she is 9, and she really enjoyed the series.  The art work is great and the flow of the episodes themselves is good.  I feel that the story can be a little corny and over dramatic at times.  However, I have watched other Anime movies and shows and that is normal.  I bought it for my daughter so was a little hesitant because I know that Anime can be very violent at times but the violence in this series is not that bad.  As mentioned earlier the art work is very good and the story is easy to follow and holds your interest
.  Overall I would rate the item w/ 4 out of 5 stars.",1252627200,,615,3.959349593495935

3663806,3,B001K98MLO,"Wolf's Rain is one of the better series in anime. Lots of deeper meaning, beautiful animation...
The only real problem I had with this boxed set was the flimsy plastic that held it together. I'm not sure how they fit a 7 disc set into it honestly. It arrived with a piece that held it together broken off inside. Also, the outer box had a crack in it. Besides Ebay, you can't beat getting this whole series for 35 dollars, but be aware of the possible poor condition it may come in.",1245974400,37,482,4.25
3663807,5,B001K98MLO,"Wolf's Rain is an anime that describes the adventures of four wolves in a post-apocalyptic setting who can take the shape of human beings to hide from people.  The artwork is dazzling:  detailed, well-animated wolves running through surreal, futuristic landscapes are breathtaking to watch.  The musical score, composed by the deservingly well-reputed Yoko Konno, is haunting and bittersweet.  And the plot is a tense, riveting roller-coaster ride, containing touching moments and wise messages too multi-faceted to be summarized in words.  I can't remember a story that touched me in the same way Wolf's Rain did.

The four main wolf characters in this story conceal themselves as humans, for they are being hunted by many sinister forces.  With the help of a creation known as Cheza, they are searching for a fabled land where they can be free to be themselves again without fear.  Their yearning for this place carries them on.  Throughout their travels, they encounter many downtrodden and disillusioned characters who appear to have no hope left.  The faith the wolves possess is often challenged by such characters, as well as by the undeniable state of the conflicted, war-torn world around them.

Wolf's Rain is not a simplistic idealist's story.  It is a dark tale meant for mature audiences, and its intonations of hope are mostly subtle.  It contains some violent scenes; the wolves are often beaten into pulps by their adversaries, and sometimes they themselves deal damage to humans.  Though we come to care deeply for the main characters as they develop over the course of the story, moments of peace for these characters are few and far-between.  The implications of the last episodes are ambiguous, deep, and philosophically far-reaching.  Wolf's Rain leaves us with the hope of a better future despite the horrors and pain of current circumstances.",1243728000,88,1865,5.146179401993355

3663819,5,B001K98MLO,"This is easily my favorite Anime of all time. The characters are so likeable in their own right and most of them are also quite tragic. The relationships in this show are so well done you'd swear the characters were real people. Even the more minor characters like Zolly are well developed.

I don't want to give anything away as far as story goes but let's just say it takes place in a post-apocalyptic world and is about four wolves in search of Paradise. Now I'm not normally a fan of post-apocalyptic worlds, but this is a very good story. So give it a buy and enjoy the ride.",1419897600,,580,4.321100917431193

3663840,5,B001K98MLO,"The packaging is beautiful, the menus and layouts are smooth and elegant, and I'm just as hooked on the story and animation as I used to be. Some people complain about the disc layout and broken tabs - I had no broken tab problem, and although the disc layout does seem rather cramped, it's not so much so that it's a deal-ruiner.

My only complaint is that I would've liked more extra features, and that the subtitles only serve as translations for the japanese audio instead of actual captions for the english dub. But such is a given for most animes on DVD. The seven discs in the package are also not numbered, but it isn't hard to distinguish what the disc sequence is.

My order arrived less than a week from when I purchased it online, and rewatching the series is a nostalgic treat. Worth the price - to anyone considering purchasing this classic series in its' entire version, I'm telling you, there's nothing you're losing here.",1408579200,,938,4.5773809523809526

It sounds fine to me. Regarding the picture, it is not that the DVDs I bought are defective. They play fine for me in several different players. The picture is not very good. Diagonal lines are really jagged looking, even when viewed at actual size instead of full screen. Thin diagonal lines look more like strings of little rectangular dots instead of lines. During shots when it is supposed to look like the camera is rising up through a shot in which nothing is moving, the division of horizontal lines looks pretty conspicuous so that the picture kind of fluctuates. Sorry I cannot explain any of these criticisms better. You probably know what I am talking about though. I have seen videos of this series that people uploaded to the web that looked much better than this, even though the resolution was not higher. The color and contrast and stuff like that looks okay to me. I did not watch this on a television, so I do not know what that might look like. I have only seen it on computer monitors. But other videos I have watched on the same monitors using the same DVD players look better than this, even videos with lower resolution.

3663852,1,B001K98MLO,"Wolf's Rain is a tale set in desolate future where wolves have dwindled in numbers so much that they have learned how to appear as humans to other people. The world in which they live is a brutal place where food is limited, life is hard and there is little to be happy about. The wolves have the idea that they are looking for a moon maiden that will guide them to a wolf paradise.

First, the good things. The show is a visual treat to look at. Designed by the same production team behind RahXephon the characters, locations and the images are really quite attractive. Another huge plus is the music. Scored by Yoko Kanno whose credit include ""Cowboy bebop"", ""RahXEphon"" and ""Arjuna"" the music is breathtaking and worth purchasing. The only dud song is the opening theme song ""STRAY"" which does sound like an 80's throwback. Beautiful songs like ""Gravity"", ""Run wolf warrior"" and ""tell me what the rain knows"" are gorgeous moving and really help connect you to the story.

Now, the bad stuff. ""Wolf's rain"" does a great job of developing each of the wolves' personalities and we understand each characters motives as they go on their sprawling trip to find paradise. Along the way things get convulted with the introduction of the moon maiden, factions of people with their own agenda and in fighting between the wolves. I won't spoil the ending but I felt like the conclusion to this anime was completely ubsurd. perhaps the writers didn't know how to end the show, or thought the ending they gave it was more ""meaningful"". By the time the series ends I felt chetated of my time and I felt i had invested in characters that were wasted for a stupid ending.

being a 26+ episode series this show is a big time investment. I don't recommend buying or watching it.",1380499200,2,1764,4.593650793650793

3663855,5,B001K98MLO,"I've loved this anime from the first time it came to the states.

The story centers around a pack of ""wolves"" living in a distopian future, who are searching for a place called paradise. Their only lead as to where to go to find it is a ""flower maiden"" named Cheza who some in the group are hesitant to trust.

The leader /Kiba/ is a lone wolf who starts there journey. The ending is very climatic and may tick some people off so if you don't like those deep thoughts kind of shows then stay away.

BUT if your up for some AWESOME effects good dubbing and deep storyline Wolfs Rain is the right show for you.",1370044800,,608,4.17948717948718

3663858,4,B001K98MLO,"as a lover of wolves this one caught my eye in a rental place and once i started i couldn't stop watching. this is NOT for younger viewers, it has alot of violence gore and death. i'm not one to cry over sad movies/shows but this one had me bawling my eyes out, even over characters i either hated or didn't care much for. there is a sense of dreary hopelessness and sadness drenching this series which is set in a post apocalyptic world where humans have destroyed much of the worlds eco systems and many seem to have a violent fear or hatred for anything natural. the wolves try to fid paradise and the themes and stories are varied and layer over each other. the only thing i don't like are the recaps otherwise the music is perfect, the feelings it evokes are powerful and the animation is stunning",1367625600,,802,4.3533333333333335

The artistry, both visual and auditory, is consistently beautiful, and the story is one in which you can easily and happily become involved.  Pacing, character development, and tone all follow suit, and I'm happy to say that I can recommend this series quite highly.

3663863,5,B001K98MLO,"This anime was among the best anime's I have seen in recent memory, the story is very engaging but I really had wished they had stayed more true to the manga as the deviation in story takes a crazy turn and kills off many of the main characters. It is a very good, but sad anime.",1352332800,,279,4.0
3663864,5,B001K98MLO,"Even though Wolf's Rain is not as recent as most of the new anime out right now, it is still awesome, if not more than the others. Not just that but the animation is superb and dub is also pretty good. (at least in my opinion, I know alot of people hate english dub). Not to mention that the music in the anime is also fantastic, I own both soundtracks. Anyway, if you've read the description, this anime is about four wolves looking for paradise, but on the way they encounter so much more than that together. Their journey and search for paradise is perilous with danger at every turn. Not quite a happy anime...it is somewhere along the lines of Grave of the Fireflies, if you've seen that movie. I mean, completely different plots, but still the same elements. But don't let that stop you from watching this series because it is one of the best I've ever watched, way better than mainstream anime like Naruto and One Piece.",1351987200,,927,4.458823529411765

She is kidnapped as soon as he finds her. Kiba and 3 other wolves search for her and continue to look for their paradise.

This anime is amazing. It's got a very unique story and unique characters. This show grabs your attention and keeps you glued to the TV. The animation and voice acting are both very high quality. All these things come together very well to make a very good anime. Definitely worth watching.",1350864000,2,715,4.458015267175573
3663866,4,B001K98MLO,"Packing/shipping times, 7/10- the packing is great besides the fact that two of the disk holders were broken, due to poor handling I assume.

Anime 8/10-  If you have not seen Wolf's Rain, I would totally give it a try.  It has excellent character development, and a great story line.  It centers around the lives of 4 main wolf's, who run into each other in a city.  They smell lunar flowers coming from a created lunar being, named Cheza.  The pack decides to follow an age old legend of searching for paradise, and eventually embark on an amazing journey.  I really liked this anime because at times you feel like you are taking every step with the characters, thanks to amazing character development. You feel like you too are going to paradise with these wolves.

Each wolf brings something to the table as they become a pack-- Kiba is very self-determined and definitely has the characteristics of a leader, which he does become.  The tortured and angered Tsume.  He comes across as an angry, apathetic character which is later shown to be a front, inside he has a deeper sympathetic nature which is shown many times, as he fights to help and save his comrades. Tsume is a deeper character meets the eye. Toboe- A very sweet natured pup who I would describe as 'the peacemaker'.  When the wolves argue amongst themselves, Toboe is always there to break up fights, and bring the pack to their goal, of making a new life for themselves in paradise. I love Toboe because he is who he is.  He always acts like himself, he doesn't hide anything.  He is definitely the most down to Earth, and my favorite character.  Hige- Hes funny, and always there for comic relief.  I don't have much to say about him, but he definitely is needed when things seem bleak and hopeless.

*warning possible spoiler ahead*

I would recommend this for mature audiences.  The ending was..... somewhat disapointing, and I would not like to give everything away, but everything does not end good for our beloved characters.  This show does take place in an apocalyptic atmosphere, which is cool, but I was told this anime had a happy ending.  Some may see it this way.  It still is brutal to say the least, but there is a lot of hope as the journey comes to an end.  The ending is what it is.

Anime fans, check it out.  I promise that you won't be disappointed.",1348876800,,2340,4.556354916067146

I ordered my copy from RoundmediaUSA through Amazon and despite a slight and very temporary shipping snafu I ended up getting a replacement copy. First, let me just say that the gang at RoundmediaUSA are awesome. They not only recieved my problem like professionals, but responded extremely quickly and truly rectified the problem. The end result? I'm now a proud owner of ""WOLF'S RAIN""!

The box set? Well, the packaging isn't the greatest, but I don't care. The case can easily be replaced if needed. The discs themselves are in perfect condition. It was tremendously enjoyable to be able to completely delve into the world of our main wolven heroes, Kiba, Tsume, Hige, and Toboe. With no comercial interruptions and annoyances, I forgot the world around me. This 30 episode series was much too short, but highly emotional and extremely well done. There are no regrets with this purchase at all. The story arc is enough to make me watch this series time and again as it reaches classic status due to its ageless qualities.

Not knowing if I'd receive it or if it would be damaged in the mail, all those worries that kept me from re-watching this series. Then I finally gave in and began to browse the deals here on Amazon. Careful to buy from someone with a 90% or above rating and getting the New or Like New. I lucked out. Got here very quick without having to pay for special shipping. Was sent to the correct address even though I provided multiple addresses (each address depending on what they sent it through). Watched the whole series again with no jumps, scratches nor fusses. Great service, will buy from here again :)

As for the series itself. You have to have keen eyes and ears. Its a wonderful story of working towards a goal regardless of all the obstacles that try to bring you down. Interesting characters, each with their own singular personality and their flaws as well. The music, oh the music. I also purchased the Original Soundtrack for this. I just can't get enough.

Just one thing about this Amazon product image on this page is that the cover on the DVD case that I received looked very differrent from this green-ish looking image. It was more of beige, bright orange and slightly pink imagery on the cover of the copy I received, what I would free call in my plainly-biased opinion ""girly-looking""

I actually once b4 saw this kind of copy of which I speak in a store just after hearing about this anime and seeing this kind of beige and pink-ish kind of cover started to actually drive me away a bit.

3663871,4,B001K98MLO,"Wolf's Rain is a good example of a show that succeeds when by all rights it should fail. There are so many weird and seemingly unrelated story elements at work here that it's a miracle the makers were able to create a story line that's compelling even when it's confusing.

The cliffnotes: It's a post-apocalyptic werewolf story about wolves disguised as men who want a flower to lead them into paradise. It would be impossible for me to explain how the characters and themes make this bizarre plot work, so I'd recommend checking it out for yourself while you still have the opportunity.

Unknowingly to the pack.. Kiba is the leader of the pack and is the one who drives them to seek paradise as well. The story is solid and has some heart warming moments. It's also an intense anime with a lot of drama and action. The dvd contains 30 episodes with dvd extras with a cast interview. The only thing I want to really point out is that even though it says it's 30 episodes..it's more like 26 episodes..there are 4 episodes in there that are a recap of previous episodes (I suggest you skip those).

I do give it 4 stars and not five because there is a few ""Filler"" episodes and around 4 or so ""Recap"" Episodes so it might be a bit long and dragging in a few spots.

3663876,5,B001K98MLO,"I've just completed this series enjoyed it immensely.  My copy arrived promptly and in perfect condition.  The storyline is geared towards adults and is a bit dark (contains ample blood, violence, and death), but highly captivating.

Some people have commented on the cheapness of the case and mentioned that it is easily broken.. I've found it to be quite sufficient and on par with most other large DVD sets condensed into a small box.  As long as you aren't violent with it, it should be fine.  The small tabs that clip the DVD inserts into place are delicate, and if you abuse them I can see that they would probably break off easily.  It has not been an issue for me.

I was a little dissappointed that one of the DVDs is amost exclusively clips from prior episodes.  A little annoying that there is no new content on the disc, but I found it to be a good quick refresher of the storyline. The DVDs are nicely broken up into separate chapters for each Prologue, Intro Credits, Part A, Part B, Ending Credits, and Next Episode Preview.  This makes plowing through episodes very easy, as you can easily skip through the intro and ending credits (the credits are beautifully done and choreographed, however, and I highly recommend watching them at least a few times).  The Extra features are pretty sparse in value, and are mostly limited to textless credits.

3663881,4,B001K98MLO,"First of all I have to say that Wolf's Rain is one of my favorite anime series of all time. it has a great and original story, it has a great cast of characters and one of the best soundtracks done by Yoko Kanno (of Cowboy Bebop fame) to address the story itself is kind of moot because I really would hate to spoil it by giving you anything. I watched this series a while back and was blown away, at first being kind of discouraged by the premise, thinking it was original but a bit over the top and stupid but as I watched more of it the characters become far more developed and brought to life in a way that makes the whole wolves storyline not even really matter in the grand scheme of things. In short if you are looking for something deep and involving get this series and watch it.

I gave this product a 4 out of 5 not for the show itself which most anime fans already know and love but because of the absolutely horrid packaging. now typically I am not one to care about what the packaging is like, as long as all the episodes are there and they work it's all good. However this packaging is absolutely horrible. The center tab is what really makes this package a polished crap ball.pretty much EVERY time I move the center tab over it pops the second to last disk out of place, I have learned that you have to hold the box a certain way so that the second to last disk won't pop out but it's just annoying. it's not a big deal, I would still recommend this set but just be careful with it so you don't damage the disks.

I also think the disks could have used more episodes on them so that you could cut down on just how many disks there are. You could have 9 episodes per disk which would give you 4 disks, 3 with 27 episodes and the final disk with the last 3 episodes and ALL the special features. Granted this particular box set has little to no special features but still it would save disk space and hassle for the company to do it that way.",1311897600,,1957,4.107049608355092
3663882,5,B001K98MLO,"Purchased the complete series and absolutely love it, in spite of the fact that the fourth DVD was basically a rehash of the previous episodes.

  Didn't care about that; this animation was put together with great carefully drawn Manga quality art work, no jumpiness indicating saving-on-the-budget Anime, and fine attention to detail. The voice dubbing fit perfectly, and the Anime had a great plot-line, although it will break your heart in the last DVD. Ending looked like it was cut short, but understand the writers reasons. The writers managed to grab me and turned me on to finding other ""Bones"" Anime to watch. (last one I saw was ""Eureka 7"" loved it also.) For Anime I consider Bones to be one of the best of them.

  Nothing cheap about Bones's work; there is always the same fine attention to plot details and fine art work in all Bones Anime works.

  Loved the soundtrack of this also (""OST"" (Original Soundtrack) is still available from ""CD Japan"" as of now); the soundtrack is excellent, and obviously from artists who cared about what they were doing.

3663883,5,B001K98MLO,"Hope, friendship, adventure, love, forgiveness, compassion, Paradise, all words that leave a subtle nostalgia upon watching Wolf's Rain; mere words cannot hope to come close to truly describing this anime. When I first saw a Wolf's Rain poster it seemed like an 'interesting' show to watch; but as I watched the first episode, then the second, then the third, and fourth, and fifth, then beyond, my initial impression of 'interesting' was drastically changed. From the first moment when you hear one of our main protagonists, Kiba, narrate the opening scene and hear the beautiful musical score behind the voice, it makes you feel as if you personally know the characters and you feel all the human emotions and struggles they go through their journey. In Wolf's Rain, Kiba is trying to find Paradise, a place that only wolves can open. However wolves were hunted down by humans and had extinct for over 200 years....needless to say being a wolf isn't exactly an option. So wolves adapted to human form and walked among humans. Upon reaching the city, Kiba tries to find the flower maiden named Cheza who can lead the wolves to Paradise. Little did Kiba know that in the city he would find more than a scent of the flower maiden; here he would find Hige, a wolf with a carefree spirit, Tsume, also a wolf with a bad-boy attitude that seems to have a haunted past, and Toboe, the youngest in the group who's sweet naive innocent ties them, and together these unlikely personalities come to form an unbreakable tie as progress on their journey to find Paradise. Their antagonists are Darcia, a man haunted by a curse and the loss of his beloved Hamona, and Quent who is a drunk, broken man convinced wolves took his happiness and family away. Yet while as antagonists their characters are very excellently developed, and while their actions are terrible and inexcusable at times, you understand them unlike other series where the explanation towards the villain or antagonist is brief or they are just so.

 A great attribution about Kiba, Tsume, Hige, and Toboe, that while having different personalities and characters, all possess human emotions and through their journey, help heal each other and relive them of their burdens and sadness that they all carried. This, for lack of a better world, 'anime' gives a hope that while we might not find Paradise on earth, it shouldn't stop us from looking. You never know since along the way you might find unlikely people who show you what true friendship is. Then we can can all know the true meaning of Wolf's Rain is.",1309824000,3,2565,4.800904977375565

That's the only part I liked. The music is great, except for the stupid 80's type intro which ruined it! Lame anime, don't buy it.",1308787200,2,467,4.258426966292135

According to an old legend, when the end of the world comes, Paradise will appear; however, only wolves will know how to find it. Although wolves are believed to have been hunted to extinction nearly two hundred years ago, they still exist, surviving by taking human form. There is a northern human city in a world where the majority of people live in poverty and hardship. Kiba, a lone wolf, stumbles upon it in search of Paradise and seeking the scent which he had noticed.... Lunar Flower.
I'd give 5/5 for this story, one of the best animes I've seen!

PACKAGING:
Many people have written that the packaging for this item was unlikeable and unstable. I found it to be quite the opposite! The box it arrived in was a little big but that was made up for by an air bubble that was in between the carboard and the DVDs. The actual case is very handy, actually, and very organized. It did NOT arrive damaged. It's very slender and could easy fit on a bookshelf, with the width of only 2 DVD cases at best. The DVDs are a little cluttered but it's overall appearance and organization is fine, especially at this great price!
On the back it has a blurb and also some good images from the series, and it lists what episodes are on what DVDs. English 5.1, English 2.0, and Japanese 2.0 for the audio, for subtitles there is Full English for both Songs & Signs! The whole series is approximately 775 minutes. DVD extras include Textless openings, textless endings, AND cast interviews! Each DVD is titled and has a face of one of the characters for each one, spicing them up a little bit.
4.5/5 for the packaging, a little frail, but still sturdy and organized.",1306886400,,1662,4.503311258278146

Great story I would recommend it to any anime fan. Everything came wrapped nice and neat there was no damages done to to the box or the DvD's.

*********

I have never been an easy person to please. This series did just that. I do not know where to begin with the series. I marathoned the entire series because I just couldn't stop watching from the beginning. I loved it so much that this is the first review I have written for any movie/show.

This has a very unusual plot line without a doubt, however, I am of the opinion that if the plot had not been as unusual as it was (wolves appearing as humans, searching for paradise) that viewers wouldn't have gotten quite the same feeling from the show, it's sort of hard to describe. I went into this thinking I would be watching an unusual action flick that simply wanted to grab audiences by saying: ""look we have wolves in our story!"" thinking I would be forced to give up from the awkwardness of having ""wolves,"" and that that the writers wouldn't be able to correctly compensate.
I was, to say the least, extraordinarily surprised.

Throughout the series the characters are truly easy to connect to. They all interlace and mesh, they fit together well, which makes for a great altogether feeling. In the beginning of the series I felt a little bored, but only for a little while. As soon as the second episode ended I was craving for more. The story line is not for everyone, some would get bored with it. However, the fair amount of action coupled with the short (essentially 26 episode) series means that you won't be dealing with monotonous amounts of action. Overall the story is VERY original and definitely interesting, I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you like stories that can truly cause an emotional response, then this series is for you. It is extremely moving and deeply intense in its imagery.

The story manages to stay simple, while explicating something extremely different than the norm. All while doing so using characters that could not possibly be easy for a writer to accurately carve. I mean, what would a wolf be like in humans form? really? You won't find any dull or pointless characters here-I think they nailed it personally.

About halfway through the series you really start feeling for the characters, its then that you realize that the characters have really gotten to you-they actually mean something.

As the end draws closer, you really begin to feel the darkness and dreariness of the close. Then, as the end collapses, I can say that I for one shed a tear, and not because the series ended. I believe the series was a perfect length (30 episodes, a story line lasting for 26 with 4 recap episodes-bleh). The storyline progresses well and there are not lulls where the characters are running around the country doing nothing useful, they are always going for their objective. As suddenly as you begin to become interested and pay attention, the action starts, and then all of a sudden you're at the end of the series-crying for each one of the characters. Its like a well written book, its not too long, its not too short, but just right, it tells the story and then ends.

A MAJOR contributor to the series was the audio/soundtrack, it truly made for a more than just wonderful experience, it made me *feel* the emotions of the story. On more than one occasion I found myself saying ""where DID they get this awesome music from!?"" I have only come across a few audio tracks that rival the ones in this series, those written by John Williams (Star Wars, Harry Potter, and others), Hans Zimmer, and the soundtrack from 3:10 to Yuma. The soundtrack from this was just simply staggering. I actually downloaded it right after hearing the ""heavens not enough"" song near the end of the series.

The art portrayed in this can be at times simple and yet beautiful. Overall the art throughout was very consistent and well made, I'm not going to say that it was unbelievable, but it was rather good. Although, the picture of the arctic wolf laying in the snow with its eyes half opened was simply amazing, and I wish I could get hold of a high quality version for use as a wallpaper. (edit: I actually got a hold of a high quality version, Google images!)

Thanks to the simple yet deep characters, the secrets kept about each up until the end, the few number of main characters (protagonists-8), the unbelievable mind-blowing soundtrack, and the rather good art, this series was an overall stunner and will be recommended by me to everyone I know. I'm giving it 9*, I was going to give it 8, but I have just realized that I haven't seen anything that quite matches up, so it gets a 9.

alright guys, that's my review from IMDB, now on for a review of the product:

The product comes packaged in a black plastic extra large DVD case. It's the size of a normal PC game case (from recent times) and is put together in such a way that the discs all have holders that won't allow them to really scratch each other too much.

IT COMES WITH ALL OF THE EPISODES. Every single one.
The packaging is adequate, not amazing, and I also received it with a broken tab that holds in the center insert.
Not a big deal though.

Overall the packaging is adequate, no legitimate complaints, and the DVDs are wonderful. No problems. Better than buying each season individually.

I'm attaching a video to show you guys the problem with the case as several people have asked about it.

As usual, Amazon is amazing, no problems from that end.

overall, I highly recommended this product.

series: 9/10
packaging: 6/10
Amazon/shipping: 10/10

If you have any questions leave a comment, and if you found this review helpful, let me know/rate the review.

thanks!

Wolf's Rain features a both complex plot and emotional characters.
- The plot gradually unfolds more about a post-apocalyptic world and a place called ""Paradise."" A forgotten legend believes that a certain maiden and wolf will open the path to salvation.
- Ironically, the wolves (characters) exhibit what it truly means to be human. They suffer painful, emotional pasts and try to reconcile them on their journey. They suffer ex. yearning for love, belonging, past sins, hopelessness, and ideals for life.
- With Yoko Kanno and Steve Conte from Cowboy Bebop, the music features and endless variety of emotional and befitting songs.
- The wolves wield deadly, natural abilities to fight and survive. However, they face countless enemies and severe injuries throughout their journey.
- Overall, Wolf's Rain is a highly emotional series. The viewers anticipate with the wolves and grip in their pain.",1294704000,,1063,5.3273809523809526

I've been a fan of Wolf's Rain ever since it premiered on adult swim, I watched every episode but missed the last two and had always wanted to buy it which is why I did last year. The quality is superb, even surpassing the quality you see on the internet and on TV. Words cannot describe how amazing the quality is, you'll just have to experience it yourself. As for the series, it is very sad but still a great series. I love it simply because its nearly the only wolf based anime, and I love anything that has wolves in it. The storyline also helps, its very mythical and reminds me of mythology, though the story is purely fictional.",1285200000,,673,4.307086614173229

3663894,3,B001K98MLO,"I was really excited to see Wolf's Rain when I first heard about it. All of my friends that had seen it and really enjoyed the series and I am sure they would give this series a five out of five. That is not the case with me though. I expected much more from this series than what I got. My friends had me so hyped for it and in the end I was left disappointed.

This series has some decent action in it. The storyline starts off about four wolves in a waste land setting trying to find their paradise. They must overcome all sorts of challenges to reach their destination. It consists of scenes with much walking like in The Lord of the Rings, but more boring. The relationship between the characters is strong and there is atleast one character you can relate to.

Like I said before this series is not one of my favorites, but it is a solid anime series. If you like series with action and drama you may enjoy this series. Like I said though do not expect to much or you be disappointed. I do not recommend this series for people under the age of 13.",1279843200,,1053,4.1568627450980395

3663896,4,B001K98MLO,"This is one of the most thought provoking anime series' I've ever seen. You can take it at face value and watch the series literally, or you can get yourself deep into the story and symbolism it contains. Yes, it can be confusing. After reading some of the other reviews you have probably already learned that the main characters are four wolves who can take human form. Just from that you can tell that the story is a little out there. I'm telling you now, unless you hate supernatural themes, wolves, fight scenes, and/or symbolism, you will fall in love with it. I did. I don't think it's giving too much away to say that I cried like a baby during part of it :P Although I'll admit it's kind of strange to watch them eating raw meat while still in their human form...

The animation is beautiful. I've never seen more spectacular wolves drawn on screen. The character design of the main four guys kinda makes me chuckle on occasion, in their tight pants and one of them with a rat-tail hairdo. But it's nothing that takes away from the story.

My biggest criticism is the inclusion of a DVD made entirely of recaps. Each episode starts at the beginning of the story and follows one of the characters you've met so far. I guess it's a way to learn a little bit more about the individual people in the story, but it is mainly just a distraction from the plot. By the time I had finished watching that DVD I had started to forget important details in the plot and it was a little frustrating being put back into the story and having to catch up on everything that happened and reinvest myself into the journey. Even more annoying, even with those recap episodes you don't really get to learn much about the individual characters later in the story. I think this series deserved to be much longer than it is.

So other than the pointless episodes in the middle of it, Wolf's Rain is a highly engaging story that is an artistic portrayal of a post-apocalyptic world. The simplest and easiest to identify theme of this series is something along the lines of: man destroys world, wolves are in hiding until they are driven to find paradise, man gets in the way and tries to stop them. A.K.A. people = villain, nature = victim. But that's not all it's about! It is also about redemption, hope, companionship, and perseverance.

I would recommend this series if you're looking for a unique story with serious themes and artistic animation. Did I mention the wolves are BEAUTIFUL?! :D",1274227200,3,2478,4.524553571428571

8314395,1,B001K98MLO,"As a long time anime watcher, some shows get such an easy pass these days for some serious plot issues.  Watching this series I felt I had such a treasure on my hands that I was going to keep this forever!  Until I saw the ending...........What....the.....Frack..............The ending ruined ALL the build up for me.

Everything before the ending to this series was 5 stars.  But I am fed up when anime series have such a great thing going and then flunk themselves out with a horrible ending.  All the wonderful animation, character development, deep philosophical thinking doesn't due jack poop when they crap out on the ending like they did in this series.

I think a large majority of anime watchers would love the heck out of the first 80 percent of this series.  But when you get to the ending, you can't help but feel ticked off for investing your time, emotional attachment and anything else into this series when you see how they ended this series.

I no longer give partial credit to anime series when they do so much so well yet poop out on the ending.  This is a 1 star for me.  All that time invested and I get a ???? what just happened feeling after seeing the closing credits.  Yes fellow anime watchers, THIS is THAT type of anime show.",1453507200,,1253,4.5

Instead it has two copies of the second to final disk. I'm dissapointed but other than that packaging, quality and delivery were flawless.",1450396800,,303,4.62962962962963
8314398,5,B001K98MLO,"I can see why it is called one of the greatest anime ever made. Very good storytelling, plot and characters. The action is good. Violent at times which is cool. A very emotional series mostly toward the end. A must see anime. Wolves who were thought to be dead are hunted by humans and are looking for paradise because the world is going to end. Then the adventure begins for our 4 wolves",1447372800,,388,4.328767123287672
