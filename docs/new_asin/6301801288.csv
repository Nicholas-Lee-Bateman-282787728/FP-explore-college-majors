367945,5,6301801288,"This was the 20th anniversary special, and it was amazing from beginning to end.  Tom Baker refused to appear and was somewhat cleverly written out, (Borrowing some footage from Shada.) but the rest of this episode fascinated me, and I turned several friends on to Doctor Who with it.  I remember when I left Alaska, I quoted William Hartnell's speech from the beginning of the episode. Just thinking about seeing it again flashes images through my mind of the Rastan Killing Machine taking out the squad of Cybermen!  This is one that's going to dematerialize from Amazon and rematerialize onto my DVD shelf the moment it's out!",992304000,,629,4.859813084112149
367946,5,6301801288,The Five Doctors special is of course a classic and the Dead Zone Game is an intriguing plot device.  There is suspense and humor but as it nears conclusion there are some weaker moments mainly Cushing's advance to the tomb being uneventful.  I wish it were longer or had a few more enemies for the doctors to fight along the way.  END,902275200,6,335,4.370967741935484
367967,5,6301801288,"I can't count how many times I've watched this, it's that great. You may know they spliced Tom Baker's Doctor in with untelevised footage from ""Shada"" and think that was the cheesy way out, but that's not the case -- it totally works. With Tom Baker being my favorite Doctor, I'm of course disappointed that he wasn't fully into the episode, but I kind of understand it too. He'd just played the Doctor ahead of Davison for 7 years, and I think it would've detracted too much from Davison's Doctor if T Baker had been there. Plus there's a scene they were going to give Tom which, IMO, would've been totally wrong. Yes, he's my favorite and Davison is, well.... less than favorite, but it was Peter's show and he deserved that scene. The pacing is smoothe and moves along well, the various Doctors and Companions are matched up well and it's overall a pleasure to watch.

I like both versions included here. The later one is a bit longer, slightly more detailed.
I don't care much for Peter Davison's Doctor, he seems too contemporary, too British. The Doctor should always be a timeless Alien, indefinable and affable.
I honestly think Mr. Tom Baker is the only actor who achieved this quality but of course it's debatable.
I regret he couldn't participate in this story.
A missed opportunity for posterity. It would have been so relevant for Doctor Who history and he would have been loved all the more for it.
What a privileged position to be in.

A beautiful gift indeed for Who fans!

Very recommended.

367975,4,6301801288,"what can be said about this story. it's one of the anniversary one that any doctor who fan should see. the story was written by former script editor Terrance Dicks. it has three of the five men who have played the doctor. the first doctor William Hartnell isn't in it because he passed away in 1975. but they found an actor that resembles Bill (Richard Hurndall). the other is the four doctor Tom Baker. Tom did get along well with the producer John Nathan Turner, so Tom wanted nothing to do with the show, but showed up to the events for the 20th anniversary.
this is a two disc set. the first disc has the original 90 minute version air in 1983 with some wonderful specials. the second disc has a 100 minute version with better effect and some extended senses as well as more specials.
the story line is great. the doctor's past self are being pulled from their rightful places to an area of Gallifrey called the Death zone. the doctors most stop the leader of the time lords from taking immortality from one of the greatest time lords ever( Rassilon).",1471564800,,1055,4.471502590673575

368013,4,6301801288,"By the production values of the 21st century, The Five Doctors barely stands the test of time.  The plot development seems ponderous and the settings and scenery are very much of the 1980s variety.  However, to judge this entirely through the eyes of, say, The Day of the Doctor would be wrong.  The absence (mostly) of Tom Baker is disappointing, yes, but the chemistry between the other incarnations of the Doctor carries its own charm, and it is a treat to see William Hartnell brought back to life in Richard Hurndall.  Peter Davison was never my favourite Doctor, but he comes through this test well enough as the youngster among the Doctor figures.  Moreover, the assembly of companions is certainly a must for anyone with an interest in the arc of Doctor Who history.  True fans will be able to accept this for what it is, and as such it would be an excellent addition to any Doctor Who collection.",1436918400,,905,4.625

368031,5,6301801288,"Four of the first five Doctors come together in this 20th Anniversary special. (Tom Baker skipped the story and so only appeared in stock footage from the unaired story Shada.) The Doctors have been plucked from the time to a haunting place populated by deadly arrow-shooting combat robots, a lone Dalek, and a host of Cybermen. The Master is sent along by the Time Lords to help the Doctors escape but no one will believe. him.

The story isn't your Traditional Doctor Who story by any means. It's about a game within a game, but it's also about stories within a story. Each of the Four Doctors has their own plot leading them to the tower, where they come together and this gives each a chance to shine. Richard Hurndall replaced the deceased William Hartnell as the First Doctor and turns in an admirable performance as the original Doctor. The others are equally on their A game. There are plenty of companions and friends and enemies in this fan extravaganza and nice moments including a ruthlessly clever scene for the Master, and a great moment for the Brigadier.

It does come together in an actual plot with an ending that's quite fitting.

On the negative side, the Five Doctors isn't a story for those who haven't had some experience with the Doctors in this story.  While Peter Davison is the Incumbent, it's arguable that he gets overshadowed here. Unlike the 10th Anniversary story (the Three Doctors) or the 50th Anniversary (The Day of the Doctor), the Five Doctors doesn't really do anything earth-shattering to the Doctor's status quo. You could skip it and not miss anything in future episodes.

But why would you want to? This is a delight A story enjoyable on its own merits and for just being a great salute to 20 years of Doctor Who and really fun adventure. Strongly recommended. Easily a 9 out of 10.",1423785600,,1825,4.672897196261682

368046,3,6301801288,"not long ago i reviewed the recent 50th anniversary special, Day Of The Doctor. my comparisons of it to The Five Doctors could be taken as critical, to say the least, so it seems that, for the sake of clarity, i should elaborate on that.
rest assured, i don't at all dislike The Five Doctors. i always enjoy the trips to Gallifrey and/or delves into Timelord culture. (my very favorite episode of the classic series is The Deadly Assassin.) the treasure hunt angle appeals to the Indian Jones fan in me, and of course how could the whodunnit not stir the Sherlock Holmes/Agatha Christie/Perry Mason fan in me? to say nothing of it being fun to enjoy the interactions of characters who'd otherwise never of met, like Tegan and Susan, or Sarah Jane and The Master.
as kind of an added bonus, we learn that Rassilon, sort of the Jesus Christ of Gallifrey, may not of been such a goody-two-shoes after all. Doctor #2 (Patrick Troughton) mentions that while Rassilon is officially noted as sort of the father of Timelord culture, there are legends which suggest he wasn't so much messiah as despot. this once struck me as a bit of a dead-end, given that the subject never came up again in the original series, but the revived series has picked up on the thread a couple of times, so who knows what it could lead to now?
so certainly this episode has a few things to recommend it. but it is, nonetheless, highly flawed.
the most obvious weakness, as i mentioned in that other review, is it's overemphasis on nostalgia. then producer John Nathan-Turner was/is notorious for favoring the P.T. Barnum school of promotion, so it makes sense that he would want to cram in as much established Who effluvia as he could get his hands on. there are times when it seems to want to be a sort of Doctor Who museum even more than it wants to deliver a coherent story. there are several familiar but superfluous stablemates - a Yeti, a Dalek, K9 - which just sort of flit in and out without even trying to fit logically into the story structure. they pretty much flaunt that they're here solely for the marquee value.
there are also a few suggestions that the Doctor may of glimpsed his own future a bit more often than advisable. No. 3 (Jon Pertwee) mentions becoming ""all teeth and curls"" in his next incarnation. No. 2 deduces that images of his sidekicks Jamie and Zoe are in fact a trap because the Timelords erased him from their memories upon returning them home. but of course this happened at the very tail end of Troughton's era, so why does he already know about it?
the most glaring weakness, though, is easily the fact that it's the first Doctor who ultimately deciphers the riddle. it's not simply my distaste for William Hartnell speaking here: the very idea collapses under faulty logic. it's obviously meant to ride on the wisdom-of-the-ages cliche...but doesn't being the very first Doctor in fact make him the youngest?
i did make one statement in that other review which, upon reflection, i must refute. i stated that Tom Baker, by declining to participate, did them an ironic favor, because now a story that was already destined to be a bit of a metaphysical rollercoaster wouldn't have to convolute itself even further to accommodate him. i'd forgotten that the most expendable Doctor of 'em all, that crotchety old fart extraordinaire William Hartnell, had been dead for several years.
now the fact is, Hartnell is easily the weakest Doctor there has ever been and, unless Bobcat Goldthwait gets the part at some point, the weakest Doctor there is ever likely to be. so in the proverbial perfect world, no. 1 rather than no. 4 would've been the one trapped in the ""time stream,"" and Tom Baker could joined the party with no ill effects.
instead, we do indeed have to deal with that not so admirable first Doctor, or rather an unctuous counterfeit. an actor named Richard Hurndall was roped in pinch hit for the late Hartnell. he manages to be just as grating as Hartnell was, but his impersonation isn't always completely convincing. his attempts to replicate the vocal mannerisms are particularly strained.
(as it happens, Hurndall would shortly die as well. what's more, legend has it the end was so sudden he didn't even have a chance to pick up his paycheck. sounds like someone's an even harsher critic than i am.)
to say nothing the fact that the Doctor's all-time greatest companion, Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen), is reduced to a whiny flibbertigibbet.
so on the whole, it's an episode with it's ups and downs in roughly equal measure. if you were to rate ever Doctor Who episode in terms of quality, from very worst to very best, the proper place for The Five Doctors would be right at the dead-center.",1388966400,,4720,4.674278846153846

368091,5,6301801288,"Go ahead and buy it -- you will definitely not be disappointed.

Yes, I know Tom Baker (born in 1934!) refused to cooperate because his ego is *still* out of control and he traditionally refused to share the stage with any of the other Doctors, but Terrence Dicks (the writer of this story and of many other Doctor Whos) fixed it. He and the producers took Baker out of another story which never aired, (*Shada* -- never saw air time due to strikes but you can buy the DVD now), and stuck him in plenty good enough, (along with companion Lalla Ward ""Romana"" who later became Baker's wife... briefly), to complete ""The Five Doctors"" theme. What did they do about poor old dead William Hartnell? They got a great actor who looked and acted just like him (Richard Hurndall), and he was absolutely superb! You will immediately accept him as Hartnell.

HERE'S THE STORY: One by one, each of the five Doctors get swept up by a *triangular Time Lord snatcher* [my phrase] and all except the Baker Doctor get sent to Gallifrey (where the Time Lords reside and run the Universe, or Galaxy, or whatever.) Baker gets ""stuck"" in some sort of time warp and so he's pretty much out of the picture at that point. The short of the story is, some nefarious person, (The Master? He's in it too and very good at that!), is trying to become immortal and the five Doctors, for some convoluted reason, are subjected to being pawns of this unknown villian, who is revealed near the end. In the meantime, you get to enjoy LOTS of former companions and you additionally get the fun of seeing the Doctors interact. They certainly do not love one another, even though they are theoretically the same person (alien, actually), regenerated.

As an additional benefit, there are more goodies with this two-disc set. On one disc, you get the entire story, all episodes, plus a ""companions commentary"" option, plus some other extras. On the second disc, you get the exact SAME entire story, only it has available a so-called ""production commentary"" in which Terrance Dicks continually rants about what he didn't write which sneaked into the story, plus his unending pointing out all of his great ideas which DID remain in the yarn... and Peter Davison mostly remains calm and listens to what this renowned, but somewhat insane, writer has to say. Oh, Davison *does* have a few things to say. Plus there are more extras on this disc. So it's a monumental deal.

Did I like the story? Well, as convoluted as it is at times, (Terrence Dicks had to perform constant re-writes due to people popping in and out of the project up until the last minute), I really, honestly thought it was great. There is a LOT of outdoor scenery (shot on film) and so it's a so-called ""piebald production"", mixing film with videotape. But that was the norm for period Doctor Who and most folks don't even notice. Film was expensive so they usually avoided location shooting and this one has enough to maintain up one's interest. The best adversary in the flick? Definitely, *The Raston Robot*, here, if you want to copy and paste the address: [...]

Do not hesitate in the least to grab this Doctor Who treasure chest. You will be pleased that you did. It's not *The Brain of Morbius"" but you'll still love it.

So far, this is the only one I've been able to find.  And it's everything I expected it to be, aside from the absence of the Fourth Doctor, who is my favorite.  But that's the only complaint I have about this marvelous tale.  I must say this is probably going to be my favorite Fifth Doctor episode.  He & all the other actors were great.  Richard Hurndall was the perfect replacement for William Hartnell.

368095,5,6301801288,"""The Five Doctors"" is not really that great of a Doctor Who story.  It has some really stupid moments (Sarah Jane really can't climb out of that ditch unaided?  My driveway is steeper than that!) but there are some really awesome moments as well - Raston Robot I'm looking at you.  The problem is that they had to bring together all five Doctors as promised (kind of - William Hartnell was dead by this point so Richard Hurndall takes over with adequate results as the First Doctor and Tom Baker is seen only in footage from the unaired ""Shada"" - but you already knew that, didn't you?) so the story is rather clunky and artificial as a result.  As an anniversary special it works; as drama... not so much.

This DVD is awesome, filled with Whovian Goodness.  First of all, both the original 1983 and expanded 1995 versions of ""The Five Doctors"" are included which is excellent as you now get a choice, unlike the previous DVD and VHS editions.  The video and sound on both are excellent.  The bonus features might be better than the feature itself - there is a trove of goodies on both discs.  TV interviews, documentaries and more will keep you occupied for the better part of three hours and that's not counting listening to both versions(!) with different audio commentaries.

If you are a Doctor Who fan you need this DVD, eventually.  There are scores of other stories you should get first however.  If you are just getting into the old show start with ""The Ark In Space"", ""Pyramids of Mars"" or ""City of Death"", all Fourth Doctor stories.

368100,5,6301801288,"THE PREMISE:
- Troughton, Pertwee, Hurndall, Baker and Davidson vs. The Master, The Cybermen, The Yetis and The Daleks.
Note: (Sadly, William Hartnell passed away before production, he was replaced with Richard Hurndall, who did a good job and I think captured a lot of the charm Hartnell had).

THE GOOD:
- The Doctors have good onscreen chemistry with each other. With the exception of Davidson who upon seeing all of his past incarnations just sods off.
- Troughton and Pertwee acting alongside each other is always great to watch! (The two doctors rival each other on screen) I recommend ""The Three Doctors"" episode as well.
- Anthony Ainley is on top form (as always) as the nefarious Master.

THE DOWNSIDES:
- The Cybermen and Daleks aren't onscreen with each other (I had to wait until 2006 for that!)
- Tom Baker is Caught in some kind of script paradox. I mean TIME paradox!!!

One reviewer compared this episode to a game of ""Dungeons and Dragons"". This is true.
This episode is basically the 4 Doctors (I'm not counting Baker) navigating their way through a deadly game in which some of his great enemies appear (Dalek onscreen for 10 seconds. Cybermen get much more screen time).

I was very pleased overall with Peter Davison's portrayal of The Doctor. He's got legit talent as The Doctor and I believe he is highly underrated second only to Paul Mcgann.

The disc was in great condition upon arrival, and the packaging in the words of Christopher Eccleston as the 9th Doctor ""Fantastic.""

368104,5,6301801288,"I was never a fan of the original Doctor Who series.  I became interested in the original series after Elisabeth Sladen guest starred on an episode of the new Doctor Who series in 2005 reprising her Sarah Jane Smith role.

I had previously seen a few of the original series episodes on one of our PBS stations here in Seattle, but could never get into the series.  I found the special effects rather cheesy.  I later learned that the cheesy special effects were one of the things that Doctor Who fans liked most about the original series.  I've come to enjoy them myself.

THE FIVE DOCTORS was the first episode of the original series that I had ever seen on TV.  That was more than 20 years ago.  I did not understand the concept of the series and the idea of regeneration and so I did not understand how all five actors could appear together playing the Doctor.  When I saw this episode on TV I missed the first part of it so did not know really what was going on.

I consider this episode to be one of the best, perhaps even the best, episodes of both the original Doctor Who and the new Doctor Who series.  Even though David Tenant is my favorite Doctor, I consider Jon Pertwee to be the best Doctor.  If such a person as the Doctor actually existed, Pertwee, as he portrayed the Doctor, is exactly how I would expect the Doctor to be.

William Hartnell, who originally portrayed the Doctor, died about 8 years before this episode was filmed.  He appears at the beginning in a brief archive footage.  His role was taken by Richard Hurndall who looks and sounds remarkably like Hartnell.  I think I watched this video three times before realizing that he was not Hartnell and remembered that had died in 1975.

Tom Baker, the most popular Doctor of the original series, is in it only in archive footage from an episode that, apparently was never aired.  He refused to participate in this episode because he considers himself to be the ONLY Doctor Who and, apparently, did not want to appear in a supporting role as one of the former Doctors.

I believe even a casual Doctor Who fan will enjoy this video and I highly recommend it.",1303862400,2,2133,4.451030927835052
368105,4,6301801288,"I know the title is probably going to sound like a complaint, but really:  It's more of an observation.  It's a great story set during the Fifth Doctor's (Peter Davison) run that brings back Richard Hurndall(playing the First Doctor because of William Hartnell's death, though Hartnell is credited on the box along with Hurndall), Patrick Troughton (Second Doctor), Jon Pertwee (Third Doctor), and placed them working with Peter Davison's Fifth Doctor.

Tom Baker does make an appearance, but it appears to me to be nothing more than pre-existing footage that they used, then plot-deviced the Fourth Doctor out of the story.  I could be wrong, though.  I'm not really that well versed in the classic series.  That's just how it appears in the show.  I think they also used some stock footage of William Hartnell, as well.

The plot is interesting, taking the Doctors back to Gallifrey, and it's great fun to see multiple versions of the Doctor together.  You get to see them deal with Time Lord traps, as well as the standard Dalek and Cybermen.  Even the Master hops in for some fun.

For companions, we see Sarah Jane Smith (who probably holds the most draw for me, as a fan of the current Doctor Who series), Susan, and I think the Brigadier from the Second Doctor's time in UNIT, and several more.  To be honest, it's quite a daunting list of companions for someone who isn't overly familiar with them all.

It's a two-disc set.  The first disc has the original 1983 version, with audio commentary by Carole Ford, Nicholas Courtney, Elisabeth Sladen, and Mark Strickson, as well as what appears to have been a '20th anniversary' special filmed for the episode.

The second disc contains the slightly longer 1995 version (about 11 minutes longer) with audio commentary from Peter Davison and Terrance Dicks (the writer).  It also contains a ton of extras that are too numerous to list here.

All in all, even as a fan of the new series just starting to explore the classic series, I loved it.  I can easily recommend it to any fan of the series, new or old.",1292716800,3,2060,4.706703910614525
368106,5,6301801288,"Okay so Tom Baker isn't really in it and William Hartnel was pretty dead when this episode was filmed, but this special is a total delight. Firstly Davison is as much of a joy as ever as the Doctor. Fans of ""#5"" will be happy to see him in his usual good form in this story and he is joined by the equally great Traughton as ""#2"" and Pertwee as #3, both of whom step back into their parts splendidly. Hurndal is okay as the ""#1,"" though he's no replacement for the original. It should also be noted that the companions, both current and the many returning are all great and by the time the whole crew is together, any old school Doctor Who fan will be amazingly excited.

The story, while not brilliant has SO much to offer to Doctor Who fans that you'd be hard-pressed NOT to have fun. This is a great story with wonderful characters and is wonderfully restored to DVD. The extras are also great for that matter, lots of commentaries including a hidden one that'll please long-time Whovians to a massive extent.

368119,4,6301801288,"I must correct a mistake by one of my fellow reviewers. Tom Baker was NOT the Doctor that was being shown on PBS at the time, it was Peter Davidson. I remember it quite distinctly because they showed 'The Five Doctors' around the same time it was being shown in Britain. This caused a small hiccup in the viewing order. The last episode that had aired was 'Time Flight'. Anyone who has  watched that episode knows that Tegan was left behind at the end and the Doctor had taken off with Nyssa. Then the next episode shown was 'The Five Doctors'. Now Nyssa is gone, Tegan is back, and there is a strange new guy named Turlough with the Doctor. My older brother explained that Britain was ahead of the USA in the airing of Doctor Who episodes.
  Okay now for the story! I loved this story and like a lot of fans I was disappointed that Tom Baker had decided not to come back to Dr Who. I was also a little freaked out by the strong resemblance between William Hartnell and Richard Hurndall. I loved seeing a lot of the old companions even if it was briefly like Zoe and Jamie. I also loved how the Brigadier knocked out the Master in the end. Strange that Rassilon has never reappeared in any current Doctor Who stories. After all, War or no war I doubt that he could be killed. I was a little disappointed by Sarah Jane's alleged ""danger"". The hill she fell down was not very high. In fact an eight year old could have made their way back up it without the help of anyone. A rope and a car winch were most definitely NOT needed!

Although I found it to be quite a good story, I was disappointed that the DVD did not include the original edition, only the special edition, and it did not have many special features either. But I still enjoyed it. This version includes both editions along with many great special features. Why didn't they release this in 2001 (or 2002)?

Now lets talk about the story itself. This is a great little adventure. The five incarnations of the Doctor are being taken out of time and space and placed in the Death Zone on Gallifrey where they fight many old foes inlcuding Daleks, Cybermen, Yeti, and the Master; plus a couple of new ones too including the Raston Warrior Robot (a great new villain), and another renegade Time Lord who is behind it all and trying to gain the ultimate power and rule Gallifrey for eternity. Now it's up to the Doctors to join forces and battle these villains and save Gallifrey once again.

It is action-packed with lots of mystery, brilliant performaces from the cast, and some great directing. And even though you begin to suspect the main villain half-way through the story, the end still comes as a shock to see how he is defeated. The only let down is that you don't see much of Tom Baker in this story. He is only in two scenes. And although the special edition is better than the original, Tom Baker is seen even less in that one because they cut out one of his scenes, leaving only one.

While I have several other Doctor Who DVD's, I had never listened to the audio commentaries prior to this one, and I must say that I'm impressed.  The Brigadier, Susan (Hartnell's Who's granddaughter), Sarah Jane, and Turlough offer commentary on the original release (1983 - disc 1) that really tie together experiences throughout the duration of the show through 1983 (and a little beyond).  And the ""Celebration"" documentary on disc 1, hosted by Colin Banker, offered several insightful (and recent) interviews and archived footage from the party held in 1983.

Well, according to the Doctor it only happens in the direst of times...with the Timelords help, as in the THREE DOCTORS.
Here the Doctor is taken out of time at points in his LIVES, featuring oddly enough 3 original actors playing their respective Doctors, the First Doctor played here by another actor and the 4th Doctor is sparingly taken from the unaired Shada episode (by Douglas Adams). The Doctor is taken out of time to play the GAME OF RASSILON in the Timelord DEATH ZONE facing old enemies like THE CYBERMEN, THE DALEKS, YETI, THE MASTER, who is actually meant to be rescuing the Doctor. Also along for the ride lots of classic companions including the Doctor's first companion SUSAN ""FOREMAN"", fan fav SARAH JANE SMITH along with a K9 cameo, UNIT'S Finest the Brigadier , cameos by Jamie and Zoey (sort of).  Tegan and Turlough are the 5th Doctor's current companions to they help out, but strangely absent is robot shape-shifter Kamelion, who isn't mentioned in the story, by timeline wise is in the TARDIS.

The Doctors and their companions are split up each finding their own way to the Dark Tower at the center of the DEATHZONE games, ultimately leading to a showdown with their abducting benefactor who is no stranger either.

The last DVD offered tweaked SFX options and several different edits have been offered of the Five Doctor's over the year, some more suspect then others, like the DVD deletion of the Cyberman's ""AHHH"" upon spotting the Doctor, which I greatly missed. The sometimes in, sometimes out ""Cyber-barf"" as well. Another change was the edited end effects of the TARDISes departure scene, which was removed, while making more sense in the latest edit, aren't nearly as cool.

This release ties in nicely to the inclusion of TIME CRASH the brief  5th Doctor 10th Doctor team up to be included in the season 4th set.

368156,2,6301801288,"It pains me greatly to give any ""Doctor Who"" DVD less than four stars. I love this show, and in my biased and embarrassingly overenthusiastic way consider ""Doctor Who"" at its worst to be light years ahead of most shows at their best. Unfortunately, if I needed an actual sample to test that theory, ""The Five Doctors"" would fit the bill nicely.

First of all, the entire concept is unoriginal. This is a cardinal sin, for originality is the lifeblood of ""Doctor Who"" and is what has kept it going for decades--without it, we wouldn't have been celebrating the show's twentieth anniversary in 1983 at all (as ""The Five Doctors"" is meant to do). And yet instead of celebrating by coming up with something new, the producers and creative staff rested on their laurels it seems and just rehashed the very creative and innovative tenth anniversary story ""The Three Doctors""--only adding in more and more stuff, proving that there really can be too much of a good thing.

Second of all, the title is a blatant case of false advertising. William Hartnell, rest his soul, had shuffled off his mortal coil years before, and there is simply no replacing him as the first Doctor. And frankly, it seems almost blasphemous to try. Richard Hurndall does his level best at the utterly thankless job of being somebody else's replacement, and there are one or two spots where he allllmost reminds you of Hartnell, but mostly the first Doctor here is a pale, anemic caricature of the real thing. There's all of the crotchety gruffness but none of the grandfatherly charm and none of the mischievous twinkle, and he even gets intimidated by danger whereas the real first Doctor would've stood his ground and made a fine display of stern indignation. And as if Hartnell's absence weren't bad enough, we also have the absence (more avoidable in theory) of the fourth Doctor. Yes, Tom Baker is not in this one. It would've been really fun to see him in the role again, this time interacting with two of his predecessors as well as with his rather bland replacement, but whether by choice or circumstance it was not to be--and splicing in old footage from ""Shada"" isn't going to fool anyone. So ironically we are back to Three Doctors all over again, after all...

But even this is squandered! A big part of the enjoyment in ""The Three Doctors"" was the interaction between three (or mainly two, really) incarnations of the same character--all quite different but just similar enough to get on each other's nerves. Here though the writer has dealt with the dramatic overkill of having four protagonists and their companions all doing the same thing by splitting them up, letting them converge only at the very end. A reasonable solution, yes, but it takes away the fun of seeing the five (or four, or, well, three plus a stand-in--oh, anyway...) Doctors actually interact--and their trading a few quips at the conclusion is paltry compensation. Speaking of the conclusion, the Doctors all converge only to stand and watch as a holographic projection of a dead guy from history does the work of neutralizing the villain. Deus ex Machina resolutions are seldom satisfying, and it seems a poor way to celebrate a hero of twenty years on TV.

There are tons of other problems. The second and third Doctors look visibly older than when they regenerated--unavoidable, but they just do. Both the Daleks and the Cybermen, hallmark villains of the show's long history, are made to appear weak-minded and feeble rather than formidable. The Master is offered extra regenerations in order to manipulate him into helping the Doctor, but if the Time Lords can just give those away willy-nilly then it makes no sense that the main villain (another Time Lord at the end of his last regeneration) is on a desperate quest for immortality--the, er, basic plot premise of the story, as such. And to top it off, on this DVD remastered scenes and CGI special effects are not optional but mandatory, which is evil worthy of the Master himself.

The chief saving grace of this mess is the pure, unadulterated guilty pleasure of unabashed nostalgia. For all that there are way too many characters and they don't do much, it's still kind of heartwarming to see them again. Furthermore, here of all places, Anthony Ainley gives one of his finest, most nuanced performances as the Master--cunning and smooth rather than the cackling knuckle-popping baddie we usually get, and more complicated, unwilling to see a universe lacking the challenging presence of his nemesis. Finally, the DVD is worth watching just to see Patrick Troughton's shining performance as the second Doctor again, and his interaction with the good old Brigadier is simply priceless. So all is not lost. ""The Five Doctors"" is pretty close to as bad as ""Doctor Who"" can get, but that's still pretty decent, a fact that is worth celebrating after all. Still, I do hope they don't try to pull off ""The Ten Doctors"" in 2013...",1184025600,7,4941,4.8288075560802834

368161,3,6301801288,"the 5 doctors was always one of my favorite stories.  It is nice to be able to See it but this Special Edition reminds of George Lucas's effects on the original star wars movie - a reduction of quality from the original.  Some scenes were added/ extended and I don't think they add anything to the story except drag out some of the scenes.  Additionally a few minutes were shaved from the SHADA clips used in the original broadcast - A crime considering Tom Baker is the most recognized Doctor for most TV audiences.  The folks at BBC made a great use of the SHADA footage for the original broadcast when Mr. Baker bowed out of the broadcast.

AKnowing that when you watch a Dr Who story you aren't going to see great special effects you accepted that to watch the story.  ttempting to Adding to the story brings me to the CGI effects.  Unlike the more recent WHO DVD's you do not have the option to turn off the ""Enhanced"" Effects and sounds.  I feel this is a detriment for most of the scenes that have these enhancements. ( the only exception being the Cybermen's amrch into the Tower which is Significantly better. As is the 'Held in the vortex ""Shot of Tom Baker.  rather than a wavy picture it is now pixelated - not a bad image.

The Timescoop used to capture the Doctors is a funnel effect ( author Terrance Dicks Calls it Casper the ghost in the commentary ) that is anything but menacing.  While more impressive than the original Black Triangle used you really cannot make out the faces of those captured. This same swirly effect was used for the exit of the doctors at the end of the eppisode- think the original effect of the 4 TARDISes splitting off and dematerializing was much better.

368162,5,6301801288,"""The Five Doctors"" was released on November 25, 1983 to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of ""Doctor Who."" The acting is top-notch, and the storytelling is remarkable.
Where the 90 Minute program fails is that the editing is off. You could tell that some scenes were cut right in the middle of them, going quickly from one to the other.
However, this DVD presents the 102-Minute Special Edition version  of ""The Five Doctors."" New scenes have been added, and older ones extended, to make the program run more smoothly. The new visual effects are better than the old effects, but they still have the ""bad taste"" feel that was a vital part of the program.
Overall, ""The Five Doctors - Special Edition"" is far better than the version that was originally aired. Fans of the program will not want to miss this in their collections. Program/DVD Grade: A+",1084406400,10,845,4.7482993197278915
368163,5,6301801288,"The original version of The Five Doctors was the first story I bought on sale video, and I saw it before the normal sequence of Peter Davison stories that were being shown on PBS.  It gave me a good look at Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee (the Second and Third Doctors), as well as Liz Sladen (Sarah Jane), and Nicholas Courtney (the Brigadier).
The Doctor, Tegan, and Turlough are resting at the Eye of Orion, a relaxing field with an effect like Earth after a rainstorm.  An unseen black-gloved figure manipulating some controls and kidnaps the First Doctor, played with great William Hartnell-ness by Richard Hurndall.  A miniature of the Doctor appears.  Hmmm, who around here likes shrinking people?  Familiar?  This happens to the Second and Third Doctor, as well as other companions, but a glitch occurs with the Fourth Doctor and Romana II, who are trapped in a time vortex.  With each attack, the Doctor suffers twinges of cosmic angst, and he must do something, lest he be pulled into the vortex and into oblivion.  ""Great chunks of me are being detached, like icebergs,"" he says.  ""I must become whole.""
The High Council of Time Lords, still led by Borusa, summon the Master to rescue the Doctor from Gallifrey's Death Zone, ""the black secret at the heart of your Time Lord paradise"" which is ""not the most hospitable of environments.""  He does so, but is rebuffed by two of the Doctors, understandable as he was full of tricks and traps before.
The Cybermen play a major role here, as three squads of them come out.  However, they prove no match to the ""most perfect killing machine ever devised,"" the sleek and featureless Raston Warrior Robot, who steals the show with its martial arts acrobatics and deadly lances and disks, and turns one squad into putty, impaling and decapitating away.  Only one Dalek appears here, as does a creature from the Second Doctor's era.
There's plenty of fabulous dialogue here.  The Master tells us why the Doctor is so endeared to fans:  ""A cosmos without the Doctor scarcely bears thinking about.""  Something the Beeb should have remembered in 1989.
The Time Scoop is seen as a spinning black obelisk here, and the Fourth Doctor and Romana's faces are swirling when caught in the time eddy.  These were changed in the revamped edition of the Five Doctors, sold together as a two-pack with The King's Demons.
My favorite Doctor, Jon Pertwee, comes off the best here, ""ever so resourceful,"" as the Master says.  He's still the charming, improvising guy with ideas; it's as if he never left the series, and he's a calm counterpart to the strung out Sarah Jane.  She's more wimpy here, and that's a big contrast to her earlier era, when she was more headstrong and self-assured.
An interesting double-entendre is when the First Doctor sees traces of two other Doctors.  ""Well, well, well, so two of them made it.  I wonder what happened to the other.""  This last sentence spoken in such an acidic tone, might be a reference to Tom Baker's last minute refusal to participate in the story.
And the Second Doctor's solo presence implies that he came here inbetween the verdict and sentencing at his trial--there is a hint of that when he encounters Jamie and Zoe, his last travelling companions.
I was right on one thing.  In the revamped version, the First Doctor's approximation of pi is 3.14287.  Here, it's more accurate--3.14159265.  Clearly they used an alternate take on the revamped version.  Another is the Cybermen led by the Master--how could they note fail to spot the Doctor and Tegan in the chessboard room upon entering?
A welcome reunion from some Who alumni, past and present, (they even included some William Hartnell in The Dalek Invasion Of Earth and Tom Baker footage from the untelevised Shada) with old pairings up (Doctor Two and the Brigadier, Doctor Three and Sarah) bringing back fond memories of the past, as well as new pairings (Turlough and Susan).",1079395200,3,3920,4.8149253731343284
368164,3,6301801288,"This 20th anniversary special is corny, essentially plotless and designed to cram in as many Doctors, companions and monsters as possible within 90 minutes. Still, you've got to hand it to them - they did a bang-up job for a show with a forever-fluctuating cast list (most notably our old buddy Tom Baker, who turned the project down before filming and got replaced by some old footage). ""The Five Doctors"" is a fun romp down memory lane, and as such happens to be one of the very best ways to bring new fans into the show (hey, it worked for me).
So why did we exactly need a ""special edition""? No, the visual effects aren't especially great, but they never were on ""Doctor Who."" The additional scenes, while interesting, are mostly pointless additions that add nothing to the plot. Probably the best changes in the Special Edition are a slight rearrangement of events (which makes the story flow a little better) and some improved lightning effects. Not enough to justify a ""Special Edition,"" for sure.
It's worth recognizing, though, that the original version of ""The Five Doctors"" will probably be released one day, and in the meantime, this really isn't a bad disc (certainly not the worst of the Region 1 line, by a long shot). Possibly where it disappoints the most is in the video department. The picture suffers from a lot of grain (especially in the outdoor sequences); while a significant step above the video, it pales in comparison to other '80s-era Who stories on DVD. The 5.1 soundtrack, on the other hand, is quite nice indeed.
Admittedly the ""Who's Who"" biographies are a bit sparing, but the half-hour of isolated musical score is a great inclusion. Without a doubt, though, the best extra on the disc is the commentary with Peter Davison and Terrance Dicks, which was recorded especially for the Region 1 release. It remains one of the two or three best commentaries for the ""Who"" DVDs yet. Davison and Dicks make a great team, both taking a jovial attitude towards proceedings. Since this disc's release, Peter Davison has proven himself an invaluable commentator on other stories; I would very much like to hear from Terrance Dicks again.
The story is a great way to get new fans into your favorite series, and the commentary alone makes the disc worth a seasoned fan's purchase.",1076889600,24,2300,4.78140703517588

The restored DVD is gorgeous. I like the new effects, especially the Time Scoop, but the real winner is the bright, beautiful picture and the pristine sound.

The updated ""Special Edition"" of ""The Five Doctors"" (produced in 1995 with extended scenes, scenes never broadcast in the original transmission, and updated special effects) deserves to be on DVD and this is a fine presentation.
The story itself is classic Doctor Who. It is a showcase for the series's 20th Anniversary. It features the First Doctor and Susan, the Second Doctor and the Brigadier, the Third Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith, the Fourth Doctor and Romana II (sort of), the Fifth Doctor with Tegan and Turlough, plus Jamie and Zoe, Mike Yates and Liz Shaw, a Dalek, a Yeti, a squad of Cybermen, a Raston Warrior Robot, Bessie, K-9, Time Lords and The Master. The story is kind of silly, but with all of these characters and monsters thrown in, who really cares about the story?
The DVD itself offers the 90-minute story, the sound mixed in Dolby 5.1, 33 minutes of isolated music score, and if you live in North America, an absolutely hilarious and extremely entertaining commentary track featuring Peter Davison and Terrence Dicks.
I rate this 4 stars because there is a lack of extra features, compared to subsequent Doctor Who DVD releases and, well, The Five Doctors will never be considered the best of the best of Doctor Who, but still a highly recommended treat for the digitally obsessed Doctor Who fan.

368191,4,6301801288,"Yes, the one with all of them. Except that the first Doctor is recast and played very well by Richard Hurndall and Tom Baker, Doctor #4 chose not to take part. The producer bought Tom Baker many lunches and many drinks and in the end, he still refused to take part. So, bits from the unfinished story, Shada, were used for Tom's contribution.
In watching this story, it's important to not have extremely high expectations. It crams a lot into a 90 minute slot (100 minutes for the extended, special edition DVD). It's best to switch off your brain and let the images hit you. All of the Doctors are in fine form, and it's especially nice to have the lovely Patrick Troughton recreating the 2nd Doctor, since there is so little that exists from his original run as the Doctor in the late '60s. It's just a big celebration of Doctor Who and all (well, many) have been invited.
The Special edition works just fine and the new visual effects are a real enhancement to the story, in my opinion. None of the changes have drastically altered the story. In some cases, they have improved the feel of the story. For example, the voice of Rassilon has been enhanced in such a way that one believes that he is the most important figure in Time Lord history, rather than the game show host that was in the original version.
This first DVD is light on features, like the UK release. I was rather pleased that the US release got the commentary with Peter Davison and Terrance Dicks. They seem to have fond memories of the program, along with a few disappointments and frustrations.

Turlough did not have much of a part in Dr. Who as a whole.  He very seldom showed up in this, except inside the TARDIS.
This special edition included scenes cut out in the original broadcast(originally broadcast in America anyway)  As for the special effects, they ruined them all!  The original release, had sharper more futuristic images for the Time Scouper and looked much better.  This ""enhanced"" version glossed it over with some kind of computer genorated blurry white thing and it is awful.  The TARDIS sequence was replaced with the same, cheapening the effect.  What were you thinking, BBC!
However, the storyline is inhanced by the added scenes and adds to the continuity.  The Master's role was a bit weak in this story.  The Cybermen were [bad]!  The Daleks made a small appearence.(and were [bad] as usual!)",1017014400,,1262,4.868544600938967
368207,4,6301801288,"The BBC for some unknown reason has always treated Dr. Who rather poorly. With todays technology and talents much could be done to this lucrative franchise yet the episodes seem to be just dumped onto what ever media is currently the ""New Thing"" and left at that. Every Dr. Who DVD should be packed with features and commentaries. Usually that is not the case.
With the Five Doctors an attempt is made to give the fans a little something extra. The version on this DVD had already been released on VHS several years ago, but they added a commentary!
Pete Davison(Dr.#5) and writer Terrance Dicks watch the program with you and it is actually quite good. If nothing else its fun to listen to Terrance complain when his script is mangled by actors and directors! Only other feature is a selection of the music used in the program. Neat if you just HAVE to hear the Who theme just one more time!
Still for the fans I would recomend it.",1015804800,2,932,4.488235294117647
368208,4,6301801288,"I'm actually going to start with the story itself first.  Who fans know it, and I think there's generally some great affection for this.  However if you're NOT a Who fan I'm not sure, despite what many speculate, that this is a good introduction.  There is a LOT of Doctor Who history which you're assumed to know to understand how the same character is being played by 5 different actors in the same place at the same time (or nowhere in time technically).  It is also not representative of the normal stories because of the need for getting all the major characters on the screen.  Additionally while the three most classic villains of Doctor Who (The Master, the Daleks, and the Cybermen) are in this (and us Who fans like to see them) they are hardly menacing as when involved in their own plots to gain intergalactic domination.  For novices this story was made to celebrate Doctor Who and in many ways succeeds for fans, but I think is not a good introduction for people new to the series, unless of course you have a fan to talk you through it.
For fans though there are some great things.  First of all we get to see the different regenerations of the Doctors interract with each other.  This is ALWAYS hilarious.  While each Doctor had their own manner and sense of humour in dealing with their companions, it's absolutely hilarious to see how much they dislike their other selves.
As noted above the top Who villains make cameos, but not at all satisfying ones.  Teh Cybermen and the lone Dalek just aren't threatening without their own specific plans for world domination.  The Master is a bit better and has his moments but even he is rather tame in this episode.
Naturally we also get to witness pathetic assistants (usually female as is the case in Doctor Who), some witty yet cheesy one liners,and some cheesy special effects.  However for people not familiar with Doctor Who, these are actually all part of the appeal.  Much like older Bond films there are things that might make one wince in real life that are priceless to see on the screen.
Personally as they're only 2 other stories with multiple Doctors this is a rare treat.  The banter is at times priceless, but for me there was something else that made this a fantastic DVD.
The commentary by Peter Davison (the 5th Doctor) and Terrance Dicks is wonderful.  To have the man who largely wrote the story and one of the principal actors discussing script choices, rapid edits, shooting conditions, and of course BBC budget limitations (notorious, and often explanatory for the cheesiness found in Doctor Who as well as Blake's 7 and other British science fiction).  From experience some commentary tracks are dull or of questionable value (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon imho) but this is one of the BEST ever!  Davison and Dicks don't just tease others but take themselves to tasks for things that they wished they could have done better.  Marvelous!
I whole-heartedly recommend this DVD, but be aware that it is not a truly first class Doctor Who story, but a Doctor Who EVENT.  For newbies I really urge you to look elsewhere.  Watch a classic episode or two, but if you get this as your introduction you may be confused and nonplussed by the villains to go much futher.  It would be a shame...",1014940800,10,3269,4.660278745644599
368209,3,6301801288,"I purchased the DVD, as I did the video.  The plot is good, and I remember as a kid loving this episode.  On the DVD, you get audio track from Peter Davision and Terrance Dicks.  That is actually quite good to listen to, as you watch the DVD.
The ""new"" special effects in this one and the previous video are not that good, and I prefer the orginal.  But all in all, good to see Patrick Trougton and the other ""docs"" reunited.",1014681600,,425,4.146341463414634
368210,2,6301801288,"I'm just getting back into Doctor Who courtesy of my three year old daughter who absolutely loves it. The first episode I really remember seeing was the Planet of the Spiders where Pertwee changed into Baker. Consequently, Tom Baker remains my firm favorite because he was really ""my"" Doctor Who.
There was a fair amount of disappointment with the Five Doctors among my fellow 13 year olds when it came on British TV. Personally, I would have held off production once I learned Tom Baker wasn't available. The stand-in for Hartnell does a fantastic job and the idea of getting the five doctors together is enjoyable. It hails back to the famous Three Doctors episode, where the enemy was a renegade Timelord called Omega, I think.
Utlimately, the entry is pretty weak. Every hallmark monster is thrown into the mix and the doctors crowd on stage cancelling each other out. Add in the side characters and you get a rare mess of a production. Ironically, the best thing I remember about this episode was a completely new creature, a lightening quick android who could throw out darts from the ends of his fingers. As I remember, he gives the Cybermen a run for their money.",1011312000,6,1171,4.717073170731707
368211,5,6301801288,"I must have seen this episode at least a dozen times, why? Well, the plot couldn't be simpler, a lot of the guest cast have nothing to do and as far as a serious entry into Doctor Who canon, It lacks any sort of scrtuiny. Despite all this however (or thanks to this, depending on your point of view), it is still probably the most entertaining out of the 150something episodes of Doctor Who produced. Great celebration for a fan, wonderful entertainment value if your not. All the Doctors give their finest performances, in particular Richard Hurndall, recreating the roll of the first doctor in such a way, you almost forget who Hartnell is, or end up wishing they had just cast Hurndall back in 1963. The only sad thing is that one is left with the terrible feeling 'Think of all the wonderful extras that WON'T have been put on it!' Having said that, we can now at least hope for a release of the original version (with more extras) in later years. This is one episdoe you really can watch again and again!",1010793600,4,1009,4.45945945945946
368212,3,6301801288,"The only thing notable about this story is that it's the 20th. anniversary story, and features a reunion of sorts, in that most of the Doctors and a fair sampling of assistants (and villains) make guest appearances.  The story itself is rather weak, especially when compared to some of the great stories from each of the Doctors.
It is telling that this story was chosen for release on DVD not because it was an outstanding story, but that it featured 5 Doctors in one (although actually only 3 of them were there, since William Hartnell had died years before, and Tom Baker appears in archival clips from an unfinished story).
Having said that, it's still a mildly entertaining ride, and I'll watch it again sometime, but it just doesn't compare to some of the finer Who stories -- thus, it only rates 3 stars.  Some of the other DVD releases have a little more in the way of special features, as well.",1005609600,,903,4.567901234567901
368213,4,6301801288,"I think Doctor Who had been going for 25 years when they decided to do this, and it's certainly not bad. A mysterious enemy traps all five (so far) Doctors (well, three and a half, really; the first Doctor is played by Richard Hurndall instead of the much-loved ""Billy"" Hartnell, who is deceased, and the fourth Doctor's actor, Tom Baker, is unavailable and so the story simply has him trapped in a time bubble or something) in a giant landscaped arena and pits them against many old enemies: a Dalek, a platoon of Cybermen, a yeti, a lightning-fast warrior robot and, of course, the Master.
  The plot is pure ..., but it really doesn't matter; unusually good special effects (updated & remastered recently) and great acting on the part of the lead characters (especially Patrick Troughton) make this story spectacular. The scenes of the Doctors teaming up is particularly warm, and great work is done by the companions, past and present: Susan (a grown woman now, but she still manages the silly feat of falling & spraining her ankle), Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (who gets to give the Master a sweet right-cross), Sarah Jane Smith (who acts her part as if she never stopped playing it), the cynical Turlough and the acerbic Tegan, who gets to show the crabby first Doctor that she can scold as well as he can. Great photography, moments of deep suspense, and a fantastic action scene where the warrior robot coldly and efficiently slaughters at least a dozen Cybermen make this story very accessible to modern viewers. A good introduction to the series, really...even without Tom Baker. Come on, he's not the ONLY Doctor...",1003795200,6,1627,4.870036101083032
368214,4,6301801288,"If you're a Doctor Who fan, you can't be without this DVD.  To my knowledge, it's the only time 5 Doctor's appear in the same episode.  If you're new to the series, this is a great introduction as you'll meet the aforementioned 5 Doctor's, a few of their assistants and get a solid foundation to explore the Doctor's further adventures.  It's not the strongest story in the series, but it's endlessly entertaining to see the Doctors relate to each other.
The audio commentary is at turns insightful and funny but I seemed to detect an undercurent of resentment that was quite suprising to me.  Picture and sound is the best I've seen for a Doctor Who release.  The 33minute soundtrack is a nice diversion, but I must admit to not listening to it all.  One complaint I have is the omission of a booklet with chapter stops.  I know you can find this information from the menu screen, but it's useful to have chapter stops in a booklet or on the back of the packaging for easy refrence when watching the episode.
Once again The Five Doctors is essential for historical as well as foundational reasons and this DVD is the best presentation it's ever recieved.  Five Doctors = five times the fun!",1002672000,7,1191,4.55868544600939
368235,5,6301801288,"The only negative thing you can say about the new DVD release of ""The Five Doctors"" is that it's not, repeat, not the version you remember from the BBC, PBS, or VHS.  This is the ""special"" edition released a few years ago, cobbled together by various members of fandom without input from the original production crew.  Only slight changes have been made, but since ""Five Doctors"" is perhaps the one story that all DW fans may know backwards and forwards, the bulk of the alterations seem both inconsequential and annoying.  Even though the DVD box states that this edition is ""not intended as a replacement for the original"", one wishes that for the DVD release, it hadn't in fact replaced the original.
However, the DVD itself is a must-have.  ""Five Doctors"" the episode is a perfect distillation of the series into 90 minutes.  To see previous Doctors, several companions, and several popular enemies, all together on Gallifrey, in a story with a crisp, clear plot, is a joy.  Nearly every line of dialogue resonates, and the enthusiasm in the production is high.  The story works both as an episode in the ongoing series, and as a standalone reunion special.  Many subsequent DW books and audios have attempted to duplicate the magic of this story, with less success.  Here on this DVD is a little bit of everything that has made ""Doctor Who"" such grand viewing since 1963.
The commentary track is by author Terrance Dicks, and the Fifth Doctor himself, Peter Davison.  This track is the best available track on the 3 DW DVDs out thus far.  The production anecdotes, insights into the script, asides, and digs at the Special Edition, are uniformly funny and interesting.  Terrance appears to remember every moment of every DW serial he worked on (literally dozens), and Peter's recall and sense of humor are nearly as sharp.  Thankfully, both men watched the episode before recording the track, so there's little dead air caused by their figuring out what happens next (unlike the commentary for the other two DVDs).
The disc does lack the breadth of special features you can find on the other releases, but don't let that deter you from buying it.  Whether you watch it with commentary on or off, ""The Five Doctors"" should be mandatory repeated viewing for both newcomers to, and old hands at, the ""Doctor Who"" universe.",1001203200,4,2324,4.821158690176323
368236,5,6301801288,"This review is for the DVD.
I was impressed by this DVD.  I was impressed by this DVD.  It was fun.  I was even more impresed when I reveived my original Five Doctors Video.
They DVD actully use surround sound.  I'm sure you noticed how other DVD's and VIDEO (Dr. Who included) use the word ""stereo"" yet you get nothing when you use your stereo.  Not the case here.  They've added new sound effects where appropriate.  There is echoing and music that takes advantage of all 5 of my speakers.  Special effects that were painful for me to to watch on my video were intelligently updated on the DVD.  Owners of the original video will notice this when they see what has replaced those infamous black triangles.  Expect some dramatic and many subtle improvements.
Extra footage is added which actually helps the stories flow better.  There is also commentary by both Peter David and the writer Terrence Dicks.  They have fun and interesting commentary.
This was definitely a joy for me.  I only hope that the rest of the Dr. Who lines either do the same or better.  Heck... I hope that any company that is planning on moving an old series to DVD looks as this as a model.

368237,4,6301801288,"A classic celebration story involving the first five actors to play the legendary Doctor but this DVD is indeed a ""Special Edition"" and not the version originally televised.  For example, the special effect of the mysterious Black Triangle that abducts the timelords from their respective time streams has been updated with a new CGI morphing effect.  Also, when Tom Baker is returned at the end the scene has been changed.  Instead of the Doctor and Romana seen happily rushing back to the Tardis in the broadcast version, we now see a recycled shot of the Doctor once again punting the yact as the new ghostly whirlwind effect flies off.  This is perhaps the most disappointing change, as I would rather have seen the aforementioned cut shot from the unaired ""Shada"" episode which fitted in perfectly with the story.  Also at the end, instead of the 3 Tardis' splitting up in different directions, the new whirlwind effect is used to show the Doctors dematerializing from the Tardis.  While I love the new 5.1 Dolby sound mix and the inclusion of the isolated music soundtrack, I am ambivalent to the new alterations.  Being a purist, I would rather have the original broadcast version intact.  Granted the visual effects at the time were of poor quality but part of the production cheeziness is what Doctor Who is all about.  The Peter Davison, Terrance Dicks commentary track makes reference to these changes specifically for the DVD version.",1000944000,8,1446,4.917695473251029

Now if the BBC would only release more DVDs in America. They're working on the Ark in Space with a new and improved cg space station, but when will it ever hit our shores. After seeing the 5 Doctors, I'm going to get The Robots of Death and Spearheads from Space, despite the fact that neither is my favorite from Tom or Jon. Just to see them clearly and all in one go, with no choppy episode editing or actual episodes is worth the DVD price. Go to BBCAmerica.com and vote for more Doctor DVDs to be released.

With the episodes edited together, we see the whole story without interruption, which works very well in this particular instance. Although some of the effects and scenes have changed (mostly for the better), it maintains the same feel as when we first saw the episode, and the same awe we had watching the Doctors unite on screen.
 The commentary provided by Peter Davison and Terrance Dicks lets us in on a bit of the process of creating this timeless story, and true fans of the show will find the little behind-the-scenes stories and tidbits delightful. I particularly enjoyed Peter Davison's fond memories, and occasional laughs at the funny moments that we all enjoy. A real refresher for him, and it's rather nostalgic and heartwarming to listen to it!
 A classic, and certainly worth picking up, even for the beginning Who fan! Also, look for the Soundtrack featured on this special edition DVD. A very nice touch indeed!",1000684800,,994,4.841176470588235

It really was such an accomplishment to show all these former companions come in as well. At least it made sense. This new 5 Doctors is done very well. The added footage that was originally cut down due to time constraints when it originally aired, was nice to see the new stuff. The new effects as well was great to watch. It made this much more enjoyable to watch and relive. As I've probably seen this so many times, this new edition certainly made it worth watching again. I enjoyed all the cast and was fond of the opening too which put the first Dr., William Hartnell as an nostalgic touch. His replacement Richard Hurndall does well but I thought he was way too tall. All the other Doctors are great and Tom Baker's absence is missed. Wished he'd done it. The new ending of how everyone was sent home made a more logical reason than the original's splitting Tardis'. The new Dolby Surround Sound certainly really enhanced the music on this new edition. Made it more a part of the story and helped set the mood to a new level of enjoyment. All in all a great new cut. My only gripe is I wish the BBC would offer the original cut on tape still. The original would be 4 stars, new one is 5 stars I'd rate.",998870400,2,1326,4.308

The writing on this series is so creative and strong that it more than compensates.  This is one of my favorite episodes (the Raston Warrior Robot alone is super-cool).  Too bad Tom Baker couldn't see his way clear to join the cast, but the episode is still stellar even without him.  Many of your old favorite assistants and villains are incorporated as well.  How do Daleks negotiate the rocky terrain of the Death Zone?  Who cares!  Richard Hurndall is terrific in William Hartnell's stead as the first Doctor.  Anthony Ainley's portrayal of the Master is excellent as well.  I'm a Roger Delgado man myself, but that's nit-picking.  A great plot and (most of) your favorite Doctors, Friends, Enemies, and some of the best music of the series.  The biggest regret I have is no Tom Baker.  I'd have loved to see how his Doctor interacted with himselves.  If you're a fan of the series, you can't go wrong with this one.

368242,4,6301801288,"With the emergence of the DVD format, the BBC finally had a chance to do right by the Doctor.  And they owe him big time!  After all, it was the BBC's desperate hunger for shelf space that deprived us of dozens of classic stories from the show's sixties heyday.  Treasures wiped clean by bureaucratic short-sightedness.  Heavy sigh.
But here they go again, releasing episodes piecemeal, cherry picking the supposed ""good"" ones and never getting around to what the Doctor deserves:  a full release of all available material.  A release, by the by, that DVD would be perfect for.  Imagine a disc with surviving clips from all deleted Hartnell and Troughton stories as a bonus.  Or with full episodes from incomplete serials that still exist but haven't yet seen video release; from ""The Reign of Terror"" and ""The Faceless Ones,"" for instance.
But no.  Instead, we'll get three episodes this year.  Then maybe three more next year.  And I will have shuffled off this mortal coil by the time the BBC gets around to releasing ""The Invisible Enemy"" or -- fervent wish -- a complete ""Invasion of the Dinosaurs.""  Yes it does exist.
So I'd like to make a modest proposal.  To Whom It May Concern at the BBC video division:  Take a lesson from Fox Home Video and consider a release a la the ""X-Files"" season box sets.  Perhaps three volumes to encompass all available Hartnell material.  One or two for all available Troughton stories.  And then a box set for each complete season from there on in.
And not forgetting the McGann TV movie.

The idea of bringing all five doctors together in a single episode was certainly a well-conceived one.  Other than the noticably short appearance of the fourth doctor, Tom Baker, I was impressed with this episode.  The story begins quickly and continues up until the climactic end.  What makes this episode special is that all versions of the doctor, both present and past, must combine forces in order to overcome the evil which is plaguing them.  It even appears as though the Doctor must employ the assistance of his ""best enemy"" in order to win.  Having lived in England for nine years, I grew up having watched a lot of Doctor Who.  This is certainly my favorite science fiction show.  The fact that the BBC never invested much money in special effects helped to prove one fundamental fact;  Good writing makes good shows.
