4894914,5,B005UXJNPU,I have been a fan of Columbo's for many many years.  Most of the shows have good writing in them.  I like most of the guest stars.  Most  of all is that Peter Falk was masterful in playing the Columbo character.  He will be missed.  I'll watch these movies over and over again!,1353628800,,277,4.132075471698113
4894915,5,B005UXJNPU,"I gave this five stars because...it's Columbo!
He's one of the most iconic tv detectives out there.  If you've never seen this show before, you'll soon love Columbo's style of crime solving and his way of nailing the murderer.",1353283200,,226,4.794871794871795
4894916,5,B005UXJNPU,"This set of Columbo is wonderful I was really surprised at the Quality of the episodes we have viewed.  Could not be happier and look forward to completing the entire series.  We have seen all before but can never get enough of this outstanding program.  I was going to order the individual seasons on DVD since the VHS we had was getting old and most had commercials.  I was willing to wait for this truly complete package and am convinced I made the right decision.

If you are a Columbo Fan this is a Must Have.  As I said the quality is outstanding!

We have been long time fans of Columbo and had most episodes on VHS from The Original Showing. We now have a complete set of this Great Show.

Thanks to Amazon for this Treasure.",1351555200,159,733,4.299270072992701
4894917,5,B005UXJNPU,"So wonderful to watch these shows.  Kazillions of guest stars bring memories flooding back, tonight was Martin Sheen, Vera Miles, Vincent Price and soooo many more.  These stories are terrific and I don't have to listen to profanity or worry about sexual content.  Gee  don't ya wonder how they made shows without all that garbage?  Anyway, the DVD's so far (into series 3) have been crisp, clear voices and no problems as of yet, and I don't expect any.  I usually spend a lot of time with British Mysteries (i.e. Midsomer Murder, Inspector Frost, Sherlock Holmes, etc.) and this is now a wonderful addition to our collections.  The stories are endearing and Peter Falks' performances bring a smile especially when he says ""Just one more thing"".  Gladly recommend ... enjoy.",1350691200,23,775,4.907692307692308

4895074,5,B005UXJNPU,"Another reviewer mentioned Columbo's ""humbleness"" and I have to agree. He let jerky people be jerks and he just listened instead of sassing back or showing his hand. He didn't argue with jerks until he had all the information he needed. I've started trying to follow this in my personal life: just smile and listen and don't try to show off or prove you're better (why worry? Columbo knew he was better than the murderer intelligence-wise and morally). Be humble, listen more than you speak and smile, smile, smile. You might find that quite rapidly you're day-to-day life will improve.

First, the boring technical stuff as of March 2018:

The discs play just fine. I'm a librarian, specifically an audio visual cataloger and I deal with people bringing me DVDs that ""don't play"" yet look fine. The discs play just fine on our computers and test DVD player. Usually the problem is someone with an old player--worse yet--an old player that's never had its lens cleaned. We pop the same discs into a computer or new/clean player and they work fine. So: there are no authoring problems on the discs I've played so far, although it does happen. Recently I bought the NCIS 1-14 season set and season 6 wouldn't play in any player!

These are full frame videos that are probably the old 4:3 aspect ratio? This means there are no black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. There is no pan-and-scan weirdness. Just a nice, full screen video just like it originally looked when it aired on TV.

There are only 2 episodes per disc and only 6-8 episodes per season: because the episodes were 1.5 to 2 hours long. So every 3 or 4 hours you have to get up and change the disc. Each season fits in a normal width case. The cases are the clear/frosted clear cases. Let me tell you: as an AV librarian I've had hundreds of broken black DVD cases, but only 4 broken clear cases (they were run over by a delivery truck). These are quality materials, not cheap thin garbage. I catalog around 100 DVDs per month and this set is top quality material-wise. However, DVD sets can be reproduced at one factory in large numbers, then a year or two later sent to a different factory to be reproduce-so you never really know from batch to batch of the quality. As of March 2018 the quality was top notch.

Some of the discs (but not all) have advertisements, however a pop-up notice tells you right away to just hit ""Menu"" to bypass these advertisements if you don't want to watch them. The only thing you cannot bypass is the FBI anti-piracy warning screen.

Sort of hidden bonus episodes: I didn't notice at first, but after watching both episodes you go back to the menu screen, however on the last disc of season 3 there was a little thing that said ""Bonus Episode"". I almost ejected the disc, but clicked on that episode and was treated to an episode of ""Mrs. Columbo""! There are 3 of these episodes throughout the set: look at the back of each season's case and they tell you which seasons have these episodes. It's really easy to miss them!

Mrs. Columbo was played by an actress (Kate Mulgrew) who was WAY too young to be married to the detective. There was also a very young daughter. If you just imagine her to be the (barely) adult daughter of Columbo it's less un-believable. The actress later played the captain on one of the Star Trek TV shows called Star Trek Voyager. I'm not saying a charming man like Peter Falk couldn't get a beautiful young wife, but it was sort of established in the show that his wife was about his age (middle age+) although maybe the detective just said that to trick a suspect. Donald Pleasence is the bad guy, but in the Mrs. Columbo episode he is really humorous, which is nice because in the Columbo episode he was in, right in that same season, he was sort of mean, weird and sad (as a character).

Through most of the first season the killer leaves an important clue behind and the walks out of the scene...only to return and grab the piece of evidence at the last second and then re-exiting the screen. It was a neat trick that they stopped doing before season 2.

As the seasons progress Columbo's shoes get worse and worse. By the first episode of season 4 you see his shoes up close a lot in the episode and they barely look like shoes anymore. That episode also marks the first time Columbo angrily accuses a suspect sort of early on in the episode. The next episode though is really, really funny: he drives his terrible car to a junkyard murder scene and they think he's there to dump it off; later he goes to a soup kitchen and they think he's homeless.

Columbo's cough: he adds a weird 'fake' cough to his questioning routine...just as his car is getting worse and worse and spitting out more smoke. Maybe he was getting carbon monoxide poisoning from his car?

PAPER! PAPER! PAPER! All my life I've loved feeling and writing on crinkled paper. Almost every episode has crinkly paper, scribbling and writing. If you are a graphophile or paperphile you'll love this show. The way he palms his notes on scraps of paper. I met a parent with a child with autism and they LOVED the feel of paper. I found them a stack of different kinds of paper to fold and touch and they loved it! There is a relaxation technique (popular on YouTube) of watching videos of people playing with paper and smoothing lightly crinkled butcher paper, etc. I know it sounds crazy, but it's called ""ASMR"" and if you love all the paper-handling in the show you'll find great enjoyment on Youtube, just search ""Paper ASMR"" or ""Crinkle ASMR"".

Oh, uh, just one more thing:  a lot of the murderers utilize various phone systems and answering machines to aid in their alibis. That gets sort of annoying, but it's still neat seeing that old technology (not just the old landline phones, but like reel-to-reel answering machines and computer punch card programmed answering machines, etc.).

4895075,5,B005UXJNPU,I finally watched all 69 episodes.  I doubt that anyone can replace Peter Falk.  The thing that really caught our attention was Pete's humble presence in such expensive surroundings.  This showed that violence (1) can be conducted by wealthy people and (2) they can be the victims of same.,1520553600,,289,4.857142857142857

I can't tell my mother though because she would want me to trade box sets and that is not happening. So glad to have this in my collection.",1520467200,,417,4.097560975609756

The ONLY complaint I have for these are that there are too few episodes per disk.  They did not need to use entirely new disks for only two or thee episodes.  It's a pain to keep changing when you're binge-watching.

There are even LOST new shows that were aired, perhaps, once or twice.  I have never seen them.  When there were a number of shows on NETFLIX, it was still limited to not very many. I watched the same 17 shows over and over.  NOW, I can grab my cigar and pretend I am in L.A. and lose myself in Columbo's world of disheveledness.  LOL",1517788800,,492,4.0625

4895149,3,B005UXJNPU,"Of course this is a FIVE STAR show. No doubt about that. It's actually my favorite TV show, period. These are, in fact, movies. Awesome writing, special guest stars and plots we can all appreciate.
However, as several reviews have already pointed out, the quality of the discs themselves is inferior. I have discs that just won't play, despite trying them on different DVD and Blu-Ray players.
I received this as a Christmas gift and immediately started watching them, so I wouldn't be stuck two years down the road with a set that wasn't playable or returnable. I'm currently up to Season 7, and have had three discs that won't play. The first of these cut out during Chapter 4 of an episode, and wouldn't continue, so I missed the entire conclusion on that one. The next disc wouldn't play a early chapter, but at least I was able to watch the end. This third disc won't play at all.
Surely GREAT-TVS-HOWS and Universal is aware of this, but what are they doing about it? Should there still be this many problem sets on the market?
I'm very disappointed that quality control and manufacturing has hit such a low. I understand people streaming their favorite shows, but there are some of us who still enjoy a tangible medium. Is it asking too much to have discs that can be played???
 I'll be contacting the person who gave this set to me and see if we can't have it exchanged.",1516752000,,1378,4.534136546184739

4895189,4,B005UXJNPU,"Columbo lives on in this TV series.  I missed the old Columbo episodes.  It has been so many years that I didn't quite remember them as I watched them.  The series played well up until the last season.  The disks in that season had many stutters and delays, however they did play through when you're patient to wait for the hiccups to subside.  The last disk was especially bad and wouldn't play at all, that is until someone cleaned it for me with alcohol.  Now, it does play back, but it has the same hiccups and delays as the others in that last season have.  I can't complain though, because the price was so reasonable compared to what the places are charging.  They may have stutters and delays too in the last season.  So, at less than $1.00 per episode, I would have to recommend it to anyone, and that it was a good buy and I have no regrets.",1509667200,,851,4.26875

4895262,2,B005UXJNPU,"If ever a television series could be accused of being formulaic it is this one.  Colombo is not a detective, he's clairvoyant.  He usually figures out who the murderer is before the corpse hits the floor.  So what draws people to the show?  It is not a whodunit as we (and the lieutenant) know who did it in the first ten minutes.
  It isn't a case of ""Will she get away with it""?  You can rest assured that Colombo will have the criminal safely behind bars before the ninety minutes are up.  Too, the way in which he catches them are often outlandish.  If you've seen one of these episodes you've seen them all.  Only the guest stars change.  Added to the lack of suspense is the drawn out quality of each and every episode.  Each one of them lumbers slowly along.  Why?  The explanation is simple.  It's an hour show at best that is stretched mercilessly out to fit some 79 odd minutes when it could easily be reduced to 44.
  Oh yes.  I enjoyed them when they were first broadcast in the early 70s (the ones from the 90s are victims of spontaneous crotch rot - he just ain't cute anymore at 68 - the mannerisms wear out like his old car, old dog, and old coat) but I was barely a teenager then and didn't quite get the total foolishness of it all.  Would it have been all that difficult to have ONE GD episode in which Columbo was fooled until the end?  You know, to add a bit of much needed spice to the tired out recipe?",1502928000,,1425,4.1881918819188195

4895288,5,B005UXJNPU,"I was a huge fan when the series originally aired, and was delighted to find the entire series, including the movie series for such a good price!  It was a first of its kind detective show, where you know who the murderer is at the beginning of the show and the mystery is how Columbo will solve it.  Although many attempts have been made to duplicate this idea, none have been as successful as Columbo.  In an era where we have so many crime shows being solved by forensic evidence, Columbo is still timeless!  He solves crimes with his wit and keen observation skills, rather than science.  It's a nicely packaged boxed set with the ""play all"" feature for us bindge watchers, and a great price!  It's a ""must have"" for fans of the show!  I've already watched the entire series twice, and will get many more hours of enjoyment from my purchase!",1501372800,,845,4.483660130718954

4895297,5,B005UXJNPU,"I wondered when I ordered this set when I'd find enough time to watch all the episodes. I should have known better. It only took me about 3 weeks or so to watch them all, including the few Mrs. Columbo episodes included in the set. I wasn't impressed with Mrs. Columbo for several reasons, but I enjoyed all the Columbo episodes, even though I'd seen most of them several times over the years. I was glad to know that I actually hadn't seen two or three of the episodes, so that was nice to have shows that weren't review. I look forward to seeing those, again, now, too.
I already have my money's worth out of the set from the first time through. Having them on DVD for future viewing is all gravy!
I would knock off a percentage of a star just because of one or two DVDs that had a freeze-frame problem once or twice, but I could move a few seconds past that spot on the DVD and resume without missing much of the scene.",1500422400,,922,4.185393258426966

I don't watch mysteries but Columbo was different with seeing the killer do the crime and cover it up for the police. That difference put Columbo in his own league.

4895333,5,B005UXJNPU,"I do like watching Columbo.  I never watched it as a kid growing up, but we found it on Netflix and watched it there until they pulled it (boo).  So I bought this set for my daughter for her 17th birthday since it's something she and I like to do together.  We get a kick out of the 70's fashions and decor, and I get a kick out of the various guest stars.  Even though the series is about murder, and often deal with adult subject matter, I find that is written from a moral perspective that I can appreciate.  In other words, wrong is wrong and there are rarely shades of grey.  When Columbo disappeared from Netflix,  we tried Matlock. I figured ""Andy Griffith, who can miss??"" Sadly, I found it very objectionable in different areas.  It had a much more ""wink wink"" attitude toward immorality, and often set up scenes for purely gratuitous effect (like bedroom scenes that went further than they needed to).  SO! I bought the whole series of Columbo and my daughter and I are enjoying it again.",1496448000,,998,4.409836065573771

4895357,5,B005UXJNPU,"There is nothing to say about Columbo that hasn't already been said.  It is the iconic 1970s TV successor to old Sherlock Holmes and Charlie Chan movie fans everywhere, and forever established Peter Falk in the classic TV firmament.

Since Netflix dropped Columbo, Rockford Files, Murder She Wrote, and a host of other Universal shows, there has been an uptick in disc buyers for these shows elsewhere (and not much reason to keep crazy Netflix).

This is a good SD copy of the entire series, including both early pilot movies and all the 1989-2003 ABC movies that Netflix never had.  But we bought it for the great NBC-era classics, and it does not disappoint.

The only better option now is the fantastically remastered Japanese BD box set, which is still well over $300.

This copy has not been remastered.  But it is a good copy with no disc issues, and will tide us avid Columbo fans over until a more reasonably priced remastered HD version is available.  Hopefully soon, as a remastered BD version of Rockford is now coming out, which is a good sign.",1494028800,,1057,4.675675675675675

4895383,5,B005UXJNPU,"Before buying this set, I had all of the individual boxes for each season which I got rid of because they took too much space. Then I bought this as a replacement and what a replacement it is! I remember that with the old boxes I was trying to improve the picture quality with the TV buttons but to no avail, the image wasn't rich enough for me and I was a bit frustrated. NOT WITH THIS SET THOUGH! The problem has been solved, and on my 40'' 1080 Samsung screen, the picture is truly now in High Definition bordering on the BluRay quality and I can't believe my eyes. Well! Aside from that, even though I know all of the episodes already, they are absolutely not boring at all due to the strong performances of the actors, the more than intelligent scripts along with the plots and all the rest. Everybody with a brain will enjoy this set and I recommend it very strongly!...",1491004800,16,876,4.315151515151515

4895387,5,B005UXJNPU,"I had to write a review even though I hate to spend the time because the other reviews I read almost stopped me from buying it. This is a DEAL if you love Columbo like I do. At my local store that sells DVD's each one of these seasons goes for over twenty dollars. To get the compete series for this price, plus a holding case is amazing. Each season has its own DVD case, its not cardboard as someone else suggested or like a DVD sleeve. Each season has its own plastic DVD size case. Inside around five DVD's can easily be flipped through and are locked in place with the middle plastic piece. It also lists each episode on each disk with a description of the episode. The outside of the DVD has the same casing as the regular seasons you can buy in store. The seasons store perfectly inside the display box and you can clearly read each season. Each season has a colored lettering on the spine and front - inside the discs are the same color - so season one is red, the discs are red and market season 1 - disc 1, etc. Which makes it really easy to know what season you are on and where the discs go. I can't recommend this set for yourself or as a gift if you like this show like I do. The quality is great, no commercials (HA) and the display looks awesome!!!

4895388,4,B005UXJNPU,Very nice set but I believe there were some more Columbo shows that were made after and that are not included in the collection. I could be wrong but it seems I saw one on TV earlier this year and it is from a date after the final movie/show that's in the collection.  It was well worth the money I paid.,1490745600,,304,3.9836065573770494
4895389,5,B005UXJNPU,"I'll give this mega set of Columbo a solid 5 stars and a little ""smudge"".
The 5 stars are for content, picture quality and value.
The little ""smudge"" is for the fact that some discs in the early seasons have uneven sound.
However, this is a small price to pay for a mind boggling mega load of 69 episodes of grand entertainment. Peter Falk is adorable and unmatched.
BTW, the 3 bonus episodes of ""Mrs. Columbo"" are best forgotten. It is like eating stale breadcrumbs after a fresh croissant.",1490313600,,491,4.52808988764045

Now, the replacement has even MORE scratches than the one I originally sent back! And, some of the discs were even loose in the cases. The packaging of the series from the manufacturer is HORRIBLE!!!! Even though it's cheaper to buy like this--I would recommend buying the individual seasons if you can just to avoid horrible packaging from the manufacturer. Amazon does send the item in a decent size box with protection--but if the manufacturer messes up in the original casing and quality of the discs---it will not matter much.

4895448,1,B005UXJNPU,"Columbo with no commercials! This was a gift to myself. I watched the first episode last night and was delighted to see his neatly trimmed hair, new suit, crisp white shirt and blue tie, new shoes and trench coat. He wore these same clothes throughout the entire run and you can watch him descend into an unkempt but brilliant deducer of facts. You get all 7 seasons and also mystery movie collection from 1989 to 2003. Not sure of what that is, but I'll find out. Tonight I watch the second dvd. There are 5 dvd's in the first season and each has a few shows on them.
2. Have watched the shows. Love them and just have the movies to look at. I have just been notified on screen, as I tried to start up another one of the movies,  that the player, Power DVD 12, which is apparantly the only player that this set uses, was only a trial.

I have now seen all of the episodes and enjoyed them all. If you are a fan of Columbo you need to get this collection. I give this item 5 stars as I believe I got  my moneys worth. Thanks Amazon.",1474675200,2,331,3.9402985074626864
4895456,5,B005UXJNPU,"Columbo is GENIUS, and having watched the full series, and I can say with confidence this is one of the greatest fictional detectives of all time. Watching the 70s ones vs. the 90s ones was great, as it's clearly the same guy... but he did get quite a bit older.

If you don't know anything about Columbo, here is a real quick synopsis: Columbo is a brilliant detective who comes across as a bumbling and incompetent fool. His primary MO when catching the murderer is to badger them incessantly. One of the most appealing aspects of Columbo is the fact that he's really VERY brilliant--even though he portrays himself otherwise. This is key, because it's not always clear if his bumbling ways are just a ruse or if he is really not self-aware. I *think* he intentionally undermines himself to set take the murderer off guard, but this is not ever really clear. This keeps you guessing to some degree.

My favorite episodes are the ones where he makes it clear to the murderer mid-way through that he knows. This presents a little bit of cat and mouse, and the murderer nearly always flaunts the fact Columbo can't prove anything. Of course, this just makes Columbo more determined, and I love watching the arrogant jerks taken down. There are also a few where Columbo sympathizes with a murderer who had good reasons for the act that didn't involve greed, etc. I don't want to say more, but it's appealing that Columbo knows how to find the delicate balance between law enforcement responsibility and compassion.

There are several ""inside jokes"" throughout the series, and these add to the amusement. Mrs. Columbo is very frequently referenced, and she has a passion for many of the careers the murderers are involved in. Yet she is never seen--not once. It's actually pretty funny when they are on a vacation together and she still isn't seen. Another running joke is the old, beat-up car featured in (I believe) every episode. Finally, I love the motif of ""This Old Man"" played throughout the series. I think it started a few years in when Columbo would frequently hum or whistle the tune, but as the years went on, this was woven into the soundtrack with elaborate arrangements and variations. I thought it was clever.

Great series, and I wish Columbo was still being made. Alas, there is no one that can play this besides the late Peter Falk.",1474588800,2,2348,4.705596107055961

So far  i own all the Dr. House seasons, Gilmore girls seasons, i won up to the 11th season of NCIS, i just watched all 12 seasons of murder she wrote and now Colombo. i love them all. and like i said no freaking commercials to put up  with..i own 504 dvd movies + because some of the dvd have more then one movie in the case. i have nearly 2 bookcases filled of episode seasons, and dvd movies. Yeah a lot of money invested in them but it beats the hell out of watching  the crap on tv. my daughter is a real bargain hunter for me to get the movies at a cheaper price. yes i do buy cheapy movies at Walmarts to for 4 or 5 dollars.

4895532,5,B005UXJNPU,"I'm a Columbo fanatic (you know, know every word of dialogue, etc.), and I'm leaving a review to make the point (here somewhere I'm sure, but if not-) that besides the fact that we know who does it from the get-go, the other focus of the series was new technologies.  You could count on Columbo to introduce new technologies nearly every week and explain how they worked, fascinating.  I think Columbo sent many thousands off to Radio Shack in the early 70s (myself included) looking for such toys.  And of course even these newfangled technologies had their Achilles' heels.  In many respects Columbo was way ahead of his time in CSI terms, too, unraveling the evidence in his inimitable fashion (e.g.- it's not what's on the tape, it's what's NOT on the tape).

Also noteworthy to me and mine was the fact that many scenes were filmed in locales we locals knew well- gas stations where we got gas, Pink's Hot Dogs, at the Pike, on the Palm Springs Tram, external shots of buildings where we actually worked (e.g., RobertShaw's, on the Queen Mary, etc.).  Police headquarters was actually the Long Beach Police Department on Ocean Blvd, and I'm pretty sure the pool hall in ""A Friend in Need"" with Richard Kiley (my favorite episode) was actually Joe Jost's in Long Beach where I spent a considerable amount of time back in the day playing snooker.  As with many shows filmed in SoCal, people start out on the Glendale bridge north of LA, turn a corner and are suddenly in Santa Monica next to the ocean.  For me watching the series is a real trip down memory lane.

A few weeks ago KTLA here started airing old Tonight shows- in one of the first ones Peter Falk dropped in in the middle of filming Columbo, in his raincoat no less, urging the audience to pray for producer/writer/director Peter S. Fischer (apparently he was ill, I don't recall).  But that reminded me that Fischer (later the creative force behind Murder She Wrote), was a big part of the series' fresh and intriguing approach, and worked on a slew of other popular shows as well.  I just saw a you tube video wherein he described how Murder She Wrote came about, and mentioned it was originally intended for Jean Stapleton.  Anyway, the 70s were a great time for murder mysteries, and for me, Columbo was the best of the bunch.",1457568000,,2297,4.602941176470588

4895548,5,B005UXJNPU,"I have never watched a single episode of COLUMBO until buying this wonderful set.  I wanted a show similar to MONK and this surpassed all my expectations and even more.  It took me about 16 months to watch the entire series and what a journey it was.  This is a reverse whudunit premise, where you know who the killer is most of the time and Columbo keeps investigating a suspect in such a way that eventually the killer is caught in Columbo's trap.

This series features a span of 1968-2003.  If you never seen a single episode, like me, I suggest you watch it from Episode 1 to 69 in THAT order.  The reason for that is to see how lives and generations change, as well as cars, technology, etc.  My favorite part of this journey was watching a 1978 episode and then watching a 1989, after the show's hiatus.  It almost made me choke up watch Columbo age so gracefully and now being broadcast in digital color.  Watching the final 2003 episode really made me lose it as he was completely white-haired and appearing in a time that was very similar to the me now.

Oh and one more thing: It was also very joyful to see legendary actors appear as killers(and victims) several times throughout the show, like Leslie Nielsen and William Shatner.  It's almost easy to forget that one of the early episodes was also directed by Steven Spielberg himself.  If you never saw Columbo and are a fan of detective shows, do yourself a favor and enjoy this collection!",1455321600,7,1454,4.486692015209125

4895614,4,B005UXJNPU,"""Columbo"" is by far one of the greatest TV Series' that's ever been made and it was a totally unique TV Series too.

4895622,4,B005UXJNPU,I am very happy with this Columbo Complete Series Collection. I have watched them on Netflix which does not include every episode so it's nice to have them all on DVD. I believe I received a customer return as the DVDs were smudged on the back of a few. My only complaint is the packaging of the set could have been better. They don't give any synopsis of each episode on the outer cases I had to pull out each DVD inside case to read the backing paper from the inside which is very inconvenient. Hopefully in future editions this will improve.,1441065600,6,544,4.3431372549019605

4895637,4,B005UXJNPU,"Nice box set and the quality is very good.  You will need to stretch the playback size to fill out your widescreen but that was no issue for me.  The only issue I have is the way in which the episodes are listed (not much info for those of you who know the shows) so finding your favorites is a bit difficult.  The actual selection process of the episode once the disc is playing isn't the best either.  With all that said, I was pleased with the quality of both the audio and the video....and I don't think you'll be disappointed either.",1437350400,4,538,4.245098039215686

4895639,5,B005UXJNPU,Who wouldn't enjoy watching Columbo catch the killer with a real twist at the end of his shows. Even with all his movies this series was the perfect role for Peter Falk. I love the surprise at the end of each show when the killer is at a loss for words! They had great writers for this show. It will be a good collection for my family to inherit. I have to admire Peter Falk for his success considering his loss of one of his eyes. It takes a lot of effort to read scripts with only one eye! He will be missed!,1436400000,,510,3.9611650485436893

I started to find this a bit tedious, saying under my breath, please get on with it.  I thought I was going to not bother watching anymore for a while, but that has changed and I am enjoying this series.  Pleased I purchased.",1436054400,,419,4.2125
4895647,5,B005UXJNPU,"Most of the DVD transfers in this set are very good, though not Blu-Ray quality obviously.  a few of the early episodes are very grainy and murky.

As for the Columbo episodes themselves, most of them are really good, a few are so-so, and some of them are great!  My favorites are the ones with Patrick McGoohan either in front or behind the camera (look for references to the Prisoner in one).  There are many other great guest stars, including John Cassavetes. William Shatner, and Burt Young among others.  The plots are clever, and I thought the passage of time did not affect my enjoyment of Columbo--I loved it when it was first on, and unlike some other series I have watched again, it holds up well!",1435881600,3,707,4.535433070866142

I am thoroughly enjoying these episodes, and can assure you that they are better than anything else on TV, these days.  When I am finished with them, I plan to start all over again, because they never get tiresome.  Seeing all the famous guest stars, some of whom are no longer with us, is like getting to visit with an old friend.

On top of that it is a very entertaining series.  Formalistic ?  Yeah, for sure, but it was that form that helped it's success.

Thanks Amazon!!!",1434326400,,318,4.3
4895681,5,B005UXJNPU,This is one of the really most enjoyable TV series. As a person watches the nearly two hour programs interviews and clues are unfolded. The viewer can piece the information together and possibly find the culprit before the Columbo disclosure/accusation takes place. Many insights into Columbo's personal life are revealed...most regarding his wife's likes or dislikes. Having the DVD series means that interruptions from telephone calls or doorbells that could  cause a missed part of the episode won't take place. I really appreciate the way the episodes progress. Clues are revealed progressively just as Lt. Columbo finds them.,1434326400,,630,5.428571428571429

4895684,5,B005UXJNPU,"Every Columbo episode is contained in this collection. I used to hate watching Columbo reruns as a child. As a kid, I thought he was a homeless guy that went around solving crimes (The episode Negative Reaction had me saying ""that's what I said too""). Once I grew up & began watching the episodes on Me-TV, I began to have an appreciation for the series & the genius behind it. Compared to most mystery movies or programs, this one was different as you would know who the killer was. Lt. Columbo would investigate, come across clues, that most other investigators wouldn't question or overlook. Then it would be a cat & mouse type movie as the murderer would try to outsmart Columbo. This collection has a few bonus features. There are a couple of Mrs. Columbo episodes & a documentary on the top 10 TV Detectives. The only thing that would have made this collection just a little bit better would have been to add additional special features such as TV spots for each episode & commentary on many of the episodes.

4895689,5,B005UXJNPU,"I am an avid Columbo fan and have been since it first started on TV...BUT I have a HUGE complaint....it is one of the frequent stars...I'm speaking of peter Falk's less than gifted wife SHERA DANESE. Her voice grates on the nerves and she always plays the SAME character...a money hungry, conniving slut who can't really act her way out of a paper bag. In every show she guested in I spent the time cringing every time she spoke a line and every time she acted like she was the kind of woman men bent on murdering would gravitate to for comfort and alibi support.

Has Ms. DANESE ever startted in ANYTHING else, beofre of SINCE her gues stinits on Columbo?

I give Peter Falk credit for being a generous enough man to share the radiance from his talents with a questionably talented and monumnetally irritating wannabe like Ms. Shera Danese. Shera danese is the ONLY constant negative in this otherwise BRILLIANT series.",1433203200,2,920,4.638036809815951

4895692,5,B005UXJNPU,"It was a great day, when I came back from work and the complete Columbo was laying before me.
Even though I already own some of the seasons of Columbo in ist original release packages, I wanted this due to the extra episodes of Mrs. Columbo.
I knew Kate Mulgrew only from Star Trek and I was really curious about that.
Therefore I tried some of the disks with my Region 1 player and did test views.
The Menu is nicely reprogrammed - it is not exactly as in the older DVD sets - some redoing of them must have been made, I would say.
All in all I am very satisfied. The quality of the package is equal to that of the older Edition. The Bonus episodes for me are the icing on the cake.
Although the Price - due to custom dues and additional VAT in Europe rose - is not the same as in the States - I can state IT WAS WORTH IT!
Now I only Need to purchase ""Mrs. Columbo""....

One of the most enjoyable mystery series ever made. My other all-time favorite is Perry Mason. The expression ""They just don't make them like that anymore"" holds true for both series. I watch them over and over. The Columbo episodes include many great guest stars, along with well written scripts. What takes them from good to great however, is Peter Falk's endearing Columbo character portrayal. Simply a TV classic. If you enjoyed this series, grab the complete set. This week's incredible sale is the perfect time!",1432166400,2,655,5.018348623853211
4895703,5,B005UXJNPU,"I recieve this box set as a gift..even though I have all the episodes of separate disks.

Peter Falk's Columbo  was amazing as the Maiget. Booth have the rumpled raincoats and same ideals of the encounters the dark side of the human psyche. Yet, he manages to maintain both compassion and his style. As mysteries goes, most of them, you know who the killer is and we watch on how Columbo unwraps each  suspect. The murderer is usually keen to demonstrate their desire to assist Columbo in his investigations and to make themselves available to him for questioning.

The magic is Falk. These shows, no matter how old are treasures. There is no crime show like this..these DVDs will prove that

FYI  ""Murder by the Book"" was ranked No. 16 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time and in 1999, the magazine ranked Lt. Columbo No. 7 on its 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time list. In 2012, the program was chosen as the third-best cop or legal show on Best in TV: The Greatest TV Shows of Our Time. In 2013, TV Guide included it in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time. In 2013, Writers Guild of America ranked it No. 57 in the list of 101 Best Written TV Series.

Lets say this, Falk owned this role..I do not any actor will ever play this again with the aplome that Peter Falk brought to the role. So why aren't you buying this set yet! I wish I could give this ten stars for how good these shows are

4895709,5,B005UXJNPU,"Peter Falk is gone now. But while he was acting he had two careers in it. One was playing in independent films made by John Cassavettes. Falk showed an astonishing dramatic range and ability in those films. Then there was his more commercial job: playing LAPD detective Columbo. It is important to remember that he started this in the 1970s so that he was way ahead of the curve on acting in police shows. His Columbo was an eccentric character whose habits were as well known to tv viewers as those of their best friend. There was his dog, his cigar, his raincoat, his car, and so forth. Then when he got with the murderer, a whole other set of habits got going. He was notorious for driving the murderer just about bats with all of his questions and poking about here and there. At first, taking one look at his rumpled, hangdog appearance, the murderer is convinced he's got it made on getting away with the crime. But that is exactly the way Columbo wants him or her to see him. Even better, a veritable ""Who's Who"" of the acting world plays the murderer in each show. Some of them are just starting off in their careers too, like a very young Martin Sheen. These are wonderful and I became a big fan of Falk's, in both of his acting careers. In his last years he also became quite a good painter.",1431820800,3,1301,4.3580246913580245

the greatest detective show of all time. Does that sound like
hyperbole? If so, you likely have not treated yourself to convincing
acting, intelligent writing and plots that will have you guessing until
each episodes unpredictable ending. Peter Faulks likeable, quirky,
sly, unassuming and ostensibly absent-minded detective will remain
unrivaled in film. This thought-provoking, unforgettable show is a
testament of when all the right ingredients come together.

Within each disc holder the disc covers what little info is available on the content of the disc. both of these are very inconvienent and would keep me from buying this set if I had known.,1423612800,2,247,4.391304347826087

4895788,5,B005UXJNPU,"Love it!  Got an awesome deal on this too.  Awhile ago I had to stay up til 2:30 in the a.m. until my daughter got home from work.  About 1:30 a.m. I went to Amazon to read a book review and my eye caught the deal of the day (which was ending in 30 minutes) for Columbo The Complete Series.  Well, I am a huge Columbo fan!  I loved watching Columbo as a kid with my mom.  The deal was down to like 50 some bucks...still a little more than I wanted to spend.  But after trying to quickly decide, I decided to splurge a little on myself,  Then I was asked if I wanted to save $40 by applying for an Amazon Store Card.  Umm...YES!  I didn't know if I'd qualify or even how long it would take to know if I qualified (time was running out fast!). But, I did qualify (I suppose everyone does) & it took like 5 seconds to find out.  So, long story short (too late!) I got this for less than $13.00!!  YAY Amazon!  That was one time I was glad I had to wait up past 2 a.m. for my daughter to get home!",1423008000,4,993,3.8564356435643563

4895801,5,B005UXJNPU,"I began watching Columbo when it first aired as a child with my Mom. It now comes on Sunday nights (again!) and we were able to introduce it to my cousin who'd never seen it before, but now doesn't miss a Sunday with the Lieutenant.

I bought this as a gift for my mother. I'd already bought several of the individual seasons for myself that she and I have enjoyed. So many nights there is absolutely nothing on TV or what is on is garbage. All that's necessary to alleviate the TV blues is to pop in one of these discs. And you're transported back to the late 60's and 70's where many of the quality TV series were created and  produced.

You know you are going to see an entertaining show. Polite LAPD cops and arrogant usually rich murderers who treat Columbo with such distain that you can't wait for them to receive their comeuppance.

Columbo is plodding but thorough. His head seems in the clouds but he doesn't miss a trick or clue. The clever men and women who match wits with the ""dumb"" detective soon find themselves singing another tune, especially when Columbo returns for just one question.

The wisdom of Mrs Columbo was channelled through her loving husband who was always doing little sweet things for his off screen wife. He got her autographs, recipes, took care of her African violet plant, took on cruises to name just a few. He had a whole host of relatives who did or said something that triggered an epiphany that lead to the capture of a suspect.

Sometimes Columbo knows immediately other times the too soliticious murderer unsuspectingly points the finger at himself, by all the ways he tries to get Columbo to follow false leads. Though the crimes are violent--this show was not about gratuitous violence. You rarely saw any blood (Columbo was too skimish for that), often the murder was shown in slow motion or off camera to minimize how terrible the killing was.

There always was comic relief to offset the seriousness of the show. Columbo's nameless disobedient Basset hound, his old raggedy ""foreign sports"" car, his lit & unlit cigars, his mop of curly hair, his ratty raincoat whose stretched out pockets held a treasure trove of clues, and the beautiful classical music he loved listening to.

Then there were the host of great stars who put in a guest appearance such as Leonard Nimoy, Robert Culp, Roddy McDowell, and Jack Cassidy. The houses/mansions of the rich and famous were beautiful, palatial estates, impressive gadgets that look prehistoric from the viewpoint of today's jaundiced eye, and cars that would have any aficionado salivating.

This series is the best. Many others have attested to it. If you get the opportunity buy it. You will not be disappointed. This is classic TV at it's best.",1421452800,8,2741,4.7175732217573225
4895802,5,B005UXJNPU,"Peter Falk just does ""Columbo"" proud!!  He's amazing and just makes Columbo an unassuming and brilliant detective and his dog and car just make the time viewing these episodes, SO WORTH the time!! A GREAT actor!!",1421366400,,212,4.888888888888889

Watching the whole series at once you realize that people be CRAZY, killing each other for the lamest of reasons. Peter Falk really was the James Bond of detectives, creating a whole genre which lasted for 40 years. And there are 3 bonus episodes of Mrs. Columbo featuring a young and quite cute Kate Mulgrew! She was a real babe and every bit the master detective her famous husband was. Too bad they never appeared together, that would have been a REAL hoot!!",1417651200,,564,4.594059405940594

4895858,5,B005UXJNPU,"..COLUMBO has met my expectations!!  What a great series.  I started watching the re-runs on tv and decided I had to buy the series.  What I didn't realize is the series ran from 1967 to 2002.  Also the COLUMBO series is not your typical WHODUNIT murder mystery.  You usually see the murder take place at the beginning of the show,  and you also know who the murderer is.  Coincidentally ,so does COLUMBO.  He just has to prove it.  At some point shortly after he meets the murderer,  COLUMBO'S  body language will tell you when he realizes who the murderer is... you have to pay attention to this.  And that's what's so unique about it.  The murderers always tries to lie, squiggle and squirm their way out of the crime.  But (2) things COLUMBO  always does is use TIME as an asset in every episode.  He also catches the suspects in lies that they usually bungle and end up shooting their selves in the foot with.

I find Columbo to be an annoying character (which I understand that he is supposed to be but his idiosyncrasies become boring to me after one or two shows)  Most of the shows let the viewer know the murderer at the beginning and then we watch Columbo trap the perpetrator throughout the rest of the show.

4895893,3,B005UXJNPU,I purchased this series as a gift and the recipient informed me that each of the 33 disc could only hold 2 episodes. That's 2 one hour episodes per disc! I'm disappointed that such a small amount of data can be placed on a disc.  Begs to the question of quality...were these recorded on sub-par disc? Are they going to wear down/break down quicker?  Did I purchase a over priced product that despite a 80% price savings is still over priced?  I will research more on similar products in the future!,1414972800,,498,4.450549450549451

It's a lot of fun and never boring.
We have found that we need to clean the discs before we play them, though they do not seem dirty.  Maybe our blue ray is just getting finicky.

4895939,5,B005UXJNPU,"We were Columbo fans back when and enjoyed every episode. To be able to watch them again is a most welcome treat. Seeing many of the great actors of that era is a poignant reminder of what the art of acting was really about when performed by genuine stars.

Watching the crimes committed and Columbo's crime solving procedure is a most interesting pastime. Yes, some of the evidence is weak but it does not detract from the entertainment factor. Another most welcome factor is no commercials in the first batch (although lots of trash later).

All this enjoyment is nicely packaged in an attractive box.

4895940,5,B005UXJNPU,"What I'm saying is each episode is really just about a movie's length. Plus, there are the made-for-TV movies collection included. A whole lot of Columbo! And that's a good thing.

These are well written detective stories where you usually get to witness the crime and then watch Columbo use his finesse (Ha!) to solve the murder(s). With so many great guest stars and even some who were not stars when they first appeared here, you will, most definitely, be entertained. I'm very happy to have these in my DVD collection to watch again and again and some for the first time.

The theme.,the same costume,the same actions,the same cigar butt and even the same dialogue never bothered.

These shows still hold up well, do not appear dated and are very engaging. One of the first episodes in the first season was directed by Steven Spielberg, when he was 24 years old. Who would have thought, over forty years ago that we could one day watch every one of these episodes at our leisure? I am very glad to have this excellent set of DVD's.

The acting is superb all around, not many shows can claim the quality of 'guest stars' that Columbo managed to have on a weekly basis. Yes, the formula stays pretty much the same (we _usually_ know what happened), and he doesn't exactly follow 'real' police procedures - but the show is the better for it. A little bit of suspension of disbelief and you'll have countless hours of enjoyment.",1406160000,,505,4.549450549450549

4896014,5,B005UXJNPU,"The concept behind this series works because of its main character, Lt. Columbo, supposedly an everyday guy who rambles on about his wife and what he had for breakfast while obsessing over miniscule details of the murder cases he's working on.  It's not a whodunit because we see that in the first half hour.  We also see how he did it and know why he did it.  So what is the mystery?  The mystery is in how Lt. Columbo will eventually bring down these pompous, self-important, overbearing killers and trap them in their own web of deceit.  Each story follows the same trend.  Columbo will present himself as non-threatening and unassuming and will proceed to make a pest of himself to the murderers who are almost always upper-scale, holier than thou types that we the viewer want to see knocked down a peg or two.  Columbo will badger the killer until the murderer is actually postulating theories on why he thinks the killer might have done something a certain way.  It's the same thing every week but with different characters in different situations.  The funny thing is we love to watch it happen even though we know Columbo will certainly pause before leaving the killers room and say ""Oh! Just one more thing...""  Peter Falk plays Columbo to perfection.  The scripts are mostly clever and the guest ""murderers"" are always fun to watch as the actors consume themselves in the characters.  The show was on for several years and then revived on another network without ever missing a beat.  A great legacy for Peter Falk.",1402012800,,1526,4.713207547169811

My younger brother by a few years doesnt like this show very much because it isn't action packed enough. He is in to the show 24, which is good, but a little too violent and dark for my tastes.

I love watching the guilty lie and get frustrated when they know Columbo does not believe them.  The series goes back to a time before cell phones and fax machines etc. and it is interesting to see how the world has changes over the years.

I don't know why the two Mrs Columbo experiments were even included.  They weren't anything like the Columbo series.
Just some stupid network decisions.  I was interesting seeing Falk trying to change his character in some of the episodes.
Some changes didn't work well, and wisely they brought the character back to the lovable grounded intuitive manipulative professional.",1399507200,8,744,4.880952380952381

I vaguely recall some of the episodes that I previously watched on television decades ago, but most of them are new to me.  It's interesting to see how Columbo (Peter Falk) ages over the years, although he seems to wear the same clothes year after year after year!  The acting, scripts and production quality are all top notch.  Of particular interest are the various guest stars appearing in each episode -- most were well-known actors at the time and almost always gave excellent performances.  A few of these actors -- such as Patrick McGoohan, Robert Culp and Jack Cassidy -- are particularly good and appear in multiple episodes over the years.  While there are a few relative ""clunkers"" in the series (maybe three or four at most), the overall quality of ""Columbo: The Complete Series"" is outstanding and never boring.  I would much rather watch these old Columbo episodes than the garbage on network television today.  Highly recommended.",1398816000,,1029,4.941860465116279

vintage TV series.  The problem I have with the show is not with the acting, which
I believe is above average to quite good. And Peter Falk, of course, MAKES Columbo.
My problem is that the scripts, while usually very watchable the first time around,
with some notable exceptions (Ross Martin as the art critic, for example), are not
something that's easy to watch the second time. The Columbo/Jeannette Nolan
running feud in Double Shock is unwatchable, for example. It's just too bad that
the series couldn't find any gifted scriptwriters for their shows. Shame, really,
because the ingredients are all there for a superb show.",1397952000,,708,4.949579831932773

One more thing... I'm BINGING on Columbo and loving every minute.
The transfers are really nice and the sound quality is clean.
With the exception of a few ""Mrs. Columbo"" episodes, there are no special features.  (Regarding these episodes; Personally, I think the casting for Mrs, C was wrong. Although Kate  Mulgree is a fine actress, her age and personality does not seem a match for what the Lt. Had been describing as his wife. Despite this, the episodes are fun to watch. One, in particular, is a bit chilling; ""A Riddle for Puppets"" on the Seaon Four set. This one feels a lot like the Twilight Zone episode, ""The Dumny"" and the movie ""Magic."")
There is very, very little pre-show advertising and it's only on the first disc of each collection. I mention this because so many collections force the ads down your throat at the start of every disc. Maddening!

It was fun to watch some that I remembered watching years ago.  And the series is well done as far as picture quality, sound and packaging.  I have NOT enjoyed the movies.  I don't care for the sexual content in some of the movies.  In fact, it seemed to me, that the Columbo movies are much like some of today's tv:  write a plot that feature sex and adultery.  I know that affairs were in some of the tv episodes, but they were more or less referenced or mentioned, not displayed right in front of you.  One of the Columbo movies left nothing to the imagination.  I would have been sick if I had watched one with anybody else in the room.  So if I could rate just the tv series, I would give it 5 stars.  But since the complete series includes Columbo movies that I don't enjoy, 4 stars is the most I can give.

Peter Falk is a genius as he plays a supposedly bumbling, absent-minded homicide investigator.  I always look forward to the way that Columbo wraps up each episode in brilliant fashion, capturing the murderer each time!  His brilliant attention to detail always shines through as he says, ""Just one more thing..."".

Over 100 hours of my hero. Years ago i purchase a bootleg version of the 69 episodes and paid $90 for it.  That was a deal at the time over buying each individual episode.  The bootleg version was missing episodes and was glitchy which pissed me off.  This official set arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  And it only cost $75.

4896071,5,B005UXJNPU,"Perfect collection of all Columbo episodes which you can review at your leisure whenever you want a change of pace.  Peter Falk is the unflappable, even-tempered detective who is invariably underestimated by murderers, as noted by the murderer in the pilot, a shrink played by Gene Barry.  I always thought of the villain as the Lawrence Harvey killer, but actually, although the killers were always cold-blooded and quick-witted, the most appearances were probably by Falk's friend, actor Patrick McGoohan, who also directed episodes and specialized in the cool, self-possessed individual whether in Secret Agent in the early 60's, or the Mel Gibson movie Braveheart in which he played the English king.  You may want to watch them all in order from beginning to end, or just pick out favorites, or sample the whole nbunch from time to time.  Whatever you want to do, having this collection on hand is the best way to go.",1391731200,,922,4.967532467532467
4896072,5,B005UXJNPU,"This is a great collection.  other reviews shows it contains all 69 episode and the 24 movies but in reality there were only 45 televised episodes and the 24 movies to make up the 69 total.  They are all in this collection plus 3 bonus episodes from the
spin off series Mrs. Columbo.  All in all  a great purchase for Columbo fans.
If you purchase this collection there is NO NEED to purchase the Columbo Mystery Movie Collection because they are
included in this complete series.
There are six white DVD boxes containing the 45 episodes from television.  Two black boxes containing 6 DVD'S each
one contain the 1989 - 1990 collection and the other contains the 1991 - 2003 collection.
ALL THE EPISODES AND ALL THE MOVIES IN ONE PLACE. eight plastic DVD cases in a heavy cardboard slip box.

I was in Vietnam when the First Season aired; in Okinawa when the Second Season aired, and in Germany when the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Seasons aired, so I've only seen them in Reruns. Seeing them like this shows me just what was going on in Peter Falk's mind as he assembled his character.

I've still not quite watched all of them, but they were perfect for viewing during these frigid winter months we've had this year.  Falk never disappoints in any of these episodes and I've never tired of the essentially same format for the stories.  A well-known actor or actress usually portrayed the ""bad-guy"" and all did admirable jobs.",1391040000,,500,4.916666666666667

4896078,5,B005UXJNPU,"I remember enjoying Columbo from my teenage years and still enjoy watching his brilliant ineptitude act. To see great guest stars gradually go through all the stages from ""I've pulled it off; with this guy on the case, they'll never catch me"" to ""oh, man...I'm screwed"" is a credit to classic writing and acting. It is amazing how something so unrealistic (these types of procedures and the circumstantial evidence would never hold up in getting a conviction) can still be so entertaining, and actually somewhat believable.
The Mrs. Columbo ""bonus episodes"" on the other hand, are not worth the time to watch them.
I felt like an employee who was expecting a generous Christmas bonus, and opened the envelope to find McDonald's coupons. We never saw Mrs. C in the original series... it would have been best to leave it that way.
All in all, though, the set was great, (there were a couple of skips, but not enough to complain about) but just ignore the Mrs. Columbo episodes, and all will be well.",1390867200,,997,4.735632183908046

4896088,5,B005UXJNPU,"A SUPERB SERIES!! While I'm only through Season Four thus far, the DVD's have been excellent! Great quality and well-packaged. My only ""complaint"", if you will, is that the DVD cases are so tightly-packed into the box that holds them all that it's quite difficult to remove them - I'm having to turn the box upside down and shake it a little to get one or more of the cases to begin to slip out to where you can grab one. After that, they come out easily. My son came up with the idea of putting a thin ribbon of cloth around the ""season"" case I'm currently watching and merely pull it out when desired - a good idea! While humorous to watch ""older"" technology being used (dial telephones, etc.), this series is just as refreshing & fun to watch as they were when ""Mystery Theater"" presented them so many years ago. I remember Columbo as being one of my absolute favorite shows to watch, although the ""Mrs. Columbo"" series did nothing for me - Mulligrew's character was not at all what I imagined Det. Columbo's wife to be. All-in-all, a superb series and WELL worth the $$$ spent - this was ""family"" television at it's finest, I think!

We've been doing Columbo mini marathons on the weekends, and our daughter (age 7) is even becoming a fan!

It's fascinating what you notice when you see the movies close together (think ""This old man..."") and the progression in time of the character and the glimpses into society and technology as it changes over time.  The last few movies don't show Falk at his best, and if you know that he suffered from dementia in the last years of his life you can't help but wonder if he was being affected earlier than known.  The acting is a little off, the character a little less charming, but there is enough that remains to make it fascinating.

Columbo, on his way out, would say ""just one more thing"" - and you knew he was about to crack the case. His rumpled raincoat, ever-present cigar, and his continued pestering of suspects was an absolute classic. What a great series.",1387584000,,367,4.333333333333333

4896147,5,B005UXJNPU,"I love this set, especially since it included several movies I hadn't seen before. In addition, it also included some bonus shows of the ""Mrs. Columbo"" mysteries which I found quite enjoyable (and had not seen before, either).

Honestly, I think Columbo is my favorite detective of all time. He seems so bumbling and so humble with his old car and beat-up rain coat, but somehow he manages to see all the little discrepancies at a murder scene. I also love the cat and mouse quality of the mysteries since you KNOW who the killer is and how he or she committed ""the perfect"" murder, but can't always figure out how Columbo is going to find enough evidence to catch the culprit. The other thing I appreciate is how little this series has ""aged."" Columbo may not have a cell phone and tablet, but he definitely doesn't need them. :)

Buying the complete series is much cheaper than buying each season individually, plus you get the movies, so if you love Columbo, you should seriously consider this. It is well worth it.",1387152000,,1018,4.587912087912088

The current police/detective shows depend on computer graphics to keep their ratings, but the shows of the 70's and 80's had to depend on a great storyline, and that is what Columbo has.

4896189,4,B005UXJNPU,"love, love, love this series!  However not crazy about getting only two episodes per dvd.  It is disappointing that there were no extras on the disks except for episodes of Mrs. Columbo.  The information about the content of each disk is written on the inside of the case which cannot be read without having to remove the disks.  Also the episodes do not seem to be organized in the order that they originally aired.  But, I am loving curling up on the couch with Lt Colombo once again.",1385942400,,486,4.4772727272727275

4896191,5,B005UXJNPU,"One of TV's greatest characters ever does his clever thing in ever episode ever.

4896193,5,B005UXJNPU,"Okay, I will confess: this is not my fir Columbo collection. I've bought the individual seasons previously but one DVD got stuck in an old player and it went with it because we forgot it was there and a few were skipping or freezing and no matter how many times we cleaned them, the skipping and freezing was coming back after a while. Not to mention that some of the movies I never had. So I HAD to get 'The Complete Series' because Columbo is such a special show: amazingly innovative at the time and still holding strong and very much watchable after all these years.

There are many 'old shows' out on DVD these days but Columbo's stand out not only because they were on an unusual 'long' format and most of them followed the unusual Columbo-branded script where the we start by witnessing the crime and then we watch Columbo solving it but also because of the outstanding quality of the DVD rendition. From 'episode one' of 'season one', the picture is crisp and bright, the colors are vibrant and the sound is clear, they almost have a digital quality which makes watching these 30-40+ year old episodes a pleasure to watch.

And, yes, not everything is to everybody's liking. This collection has near-zero extras that's not on the DVDs themselves. There are no glossy inserts and even the episodes' names can't be seen unless you look at the interior cover and you will usually have to remove the first or the last disc to access them. No huge deal but, yeah, it's a small inconvenience.

Overall, I am simply thrilled to finally have all of Columbo in one box and I highly recommend this to anyone who remembers the old shows or the relatively more recent Columbo mystery movies an ABC and to anyone who would be interested in watching one of the greatest detective TV series ever made. Oh, by the way, the ABC Columbo movies are rendered in a 'wide screen' format so if you watched the movies 'then' on an old TV, you are going to see more of it now.",1385078400,3,1959,4.481792717086835

4896197,5,B005UXJNPU,"This collection is just perfection. Magnificent clear sound and picture, and even better than first-run now that I've got a 60-inch TV. Each season is in its own five- or six- DVD case, two episodes per disc ... and no two-sided discs to drive you crazy. My husband and I love Columbo and we treat ourselves to a couple of episodes every weekend. This would be the perfect gift. Columbo was world-class television programming with unforgettable plots, terrific guest stars and (of course) the incomparable Peter Falk.",1384819200,2,517,4.954022988505747
4896200,5,B005UXJNPU,"Very nice collection of the Peter Falk classics.  Loved every minute of it, even though the guest stars were sort of mediocre towards the end of the series.

4896202,5,B005UXJNPU,"I've always loved the Columbo shows and already watched the first entire season via Amazon Video.

""Columbo: The Complete Series"" is published on DVD, as the show was only broadcast via television quality, making it easily watchable for Linux users.

A nice addition for anybodies Movie library at home!

Pros:
1) Supposedly includes every show and every Movie!
2) Dolby 2.0 16 bit audio, and connecting to a home stereo via S/PDIF and using the stereos's 5-channel upmixing creates an adequate sound or audio field, with immersion.  (If I'm not mistaken, the stream is a two channel audio and enhanced using Dolby Digital.  It doesn't do much in of itself, until the home stereo upmixes to 5 or 7 channel audio.)
3) One of the best episodes so far, ""Forgotten Lady"".  And the shows just keep getting better!",1384732800,,808,4.818840579710145

4896204,5,B005UXJNPU,This set is outstanding. The quality of the tapes are excellent. The programs are clear and look brand new. Perhaps it is because the DVDs were produced by Universal Studios.

That's how long it's been since the first Columbo TV film aired, 2/20/68, ""Prescription Murder.""  I had forgotten how many episodes have not been rerun that frequently on TV back in the day. It's a hoot to see a young Blythe Danner, Lee Grant, John Cassavetes, Anjanette Comer, Robert Vaughn, Martin Sheen in lead roles; and Katie Sagal, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ed Begley, Jr., & Jack Riley in small bit parts! The picture quality and sound are great, and NO commercials!  It is interesting to see the early efforts of Steven Spielberg and Steven Bochco.

I may have to buy pizzas for twenty for Thanksgiving, as I am being blamed for feeding Mom's Columbo addiction. A family intervention may be in order.

4896210,4,B005UXJNPU,"A fine edition to my DVD collection...Columbo is excellent entertainment for the whole family. The disks are well packaged to last a lifetime with care. My only beef is the limited extras included. It would've been nice to see Peter Falk discussing his work and the many fine actors he starred with in this series. Also, the Spanish language subtitles aren't included for the later episodes.

However, the production quality is amazing for 1970's and 1980's...The picture is crisp and clear. And the acting is superb for the era.

It's also quite a kick to see the fashion and antiquated technology of the period. It certainly brings back fond memories of when good script writing, drama and suspense--not special effects and car chases--made a show worth watching.

In my area, Columbo reruns air only once a week--on Sundays. And some of the later episodes never seem to air at all--which is when they had even bigger budgets and better directing. But now I get to play the same episode--or better--on DVD at the same time and watch it totally commercial free. And as far as I'm concerned that's the only way to see Columbo at work and not skip a beat of his masterful sleuthing. Trust me, you don't want to miss a single flicked cigar ash if you can help it...Especially in today's stiflingly politically correct culture...Also, I notice the network reruns do seem to edit out some scenes and credits to make room for more commercials--which is artistic blasphemy in my book.

For the fifty bucks I paid, this is some of the finest television that ever aired. It includes 3 bonus episodes of Mrs. Columbo; which are best avoided if you don't want to see a fine actress like Kate Mulgrew--Captain Janeway of the Star Trek Voyager series--wasting her talents in a role she was little suited for and for which she was laughably young and poorly cast. The idea of a married woman using her feminine charms and know-it-all intellect as an investigative reporter to collar murderers might've worked under any other name...But not in this case...However, it will make you appreciate the real Columbo all the more.

This Columbo series now occupies a place of honor alongside my Rumpole of the Bailey collection--which is another fine piece of period TV...I'd recommend it based on price, quality and free shipping as one of the best deals on Amazon....It's just a little short of extra features but that seems a fairly petty complaint hardly worth mentioning.

Just a viewer tip: If you watch these in chronological order you get to see Columbo's shoes go from brand spanking new to a God awful mess...He apparently never polished them once during the whole time he was shooting the show--and his raincoat gets ever more rumpled as well.",1384214400,13,2733,4.829059829059829
4896211,5,B005UXJNPU,"All the episodes of one of the best series ever.  Peter Falk is wonderful to watch as Columbo.  I don't care as much for the later episodes, but that's true of many series.  Great writing, and engaging performances by Falk and most of the guest villains.",1384128000,2,254,4.478260869565218
4896212,4,B005UXJNPU,"I already bought the individual season sets, but as a Columbo scholar and super-fan, I couldn't resist the extra-special Black Friday sale price, so I bought this set as back-up. This review will compare the releases.

Got it today! The main advantage over the previous releases, I think, is that the collection has been packaged to be very compact -- about 5 inches of shelf space for all 69 episodes. I thought they might use those super-thin boxes, but instead they just re-sized the original design to put more discs into each box. And they packed the ""ABC series"" into only 2 boxes, instead of stretching them out over 4.

Another advantage is that there are NO ""double-sided"" disks. In the original releases, at least one season (I forget which) had the error-prone, 2-sided disks. So that's been fixed.

One way they slightly slimmed each box, was to eliminate the booklets -- instead, the episode names, and brief descriptions, are printed on the inner surfaces of each box. This has the downside that you might have to pop-out a disc to read the episode list and notes.

Speaking of episode lists, one improvement I would have liked to see (other than better Extras!) would be to print the episode names ON each disk, so you can see what titles they include when they're away from the box. But no, as before, the discs are only identified as, for example, ""Season 2 - Disc 3"".

Extras are the 3 ""Mrs Columbo"" episodes previously added, and a TV special called ""Top Cops"" about the classic, mainly 1970s-era TV cop characters, including you-know-who (although if I recall correctly, their shot of his ""ID card"" is bogus, taken from an illustration created for the back of the paperback novels).

Anyway, for the price it can't be beat! A great choice to own and enjoy one of the best TV series of all time.",1383955200,12,1814,4.670846394984326

4896214,5,B005UXJNPU,"I've always loved this show and to get the whole series for just under $53 is a dream come true. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that three of the Mrs. Columbo shows are included as bonuses, of course they don't have near the high standard of Columbo but I still like them. There is no booklet listing the episodes but I took the idea of another customer and simply turned the labels so that the list of shows are facing the outside, which also includes a brief description of each show.

List of Mrs. Columbo shows:

Murder Is a Parlor Game
A retired Scotland Yard homicide inspector and author of a best seller on perfect murders is forced to kill in self-defense.

A Riddle for Puppets
A ventriloquist finds his dummy is acting independently of his will and kills the man who carved it. It's up to Kate Columbo to solve the murder.

Caviar with Everything
A society caterer, angry that her husband is divorcing her for her business partner, has murder in mind for both.

I noticed some people have reported bad disc, I just received my Columbo today and have only played two disc and it may be some time to find a defective one if one exists, if I happen to come across that problem I will post an update.

To summarize: This is a wonderful collection and the shows look great, to me watching Columbo is like having an old friend come to visit. love it.",1383782400,3,1363,4.410358565737051
4896215,5,B005UXJNPU,"I gave it a 5 star because the quality of the picture.  Plus the TV series over all was an excellent series.  I ordered this when it was a Gold Box Special and it was cheaper for me to order this complete set then to buy the movies 1990 thru 2003 separately.  Glad I did when I saw the quality of the picture had improved.

I was disappointed that the Format description was misleading.  It implies Full Screen and Widescreen available.  It reads... ""Format: Box set, Color, Full Screen, NTSC, Widescreen"".  This is misleading because it is Full Screen for everything except the last movie collection ""Columbo Mystery Movie Collection 1991-2003"", that is widescreen.  This was not mentioned in the ""Editorial Review"" either.  I felt this was deceptive.

I have the complete series set I had ordered for my mother as each season was released.  The last two seasons 6 & 7 were released in 2006.  This complete set, I just received, is by far a better quality picture and was released in 2012.",1383782400,5,990,4.626436781609195

4896218,5,B005UXJNPU,"I own each of the Columbo seasons from this box set individually and let me tell you, this is AWESOME.  Columbo is one of the great TV characters of all time, and Peter Falk is simply amazing in this role.  He's so frumpy, and comes across as goofy and clueless to the criminals until they realize he's completely on to them...and it's too late.  The murders that take place at the beginning of each episode are so well set up by each criminal ""mastermind"" that it seems unsolvable, until Columbo comes in and unwinds the clues while driving the criminal batty with his constant questions.  My favorite TV series ever, by far.

The funny thing is, when I started buying this series a season at a time, my wife couldn't believe I liked Columbo, and even called me a nerd for it.  However, as she started watching them with me, she became just as addicted to them as me and even went out and bought some of the subsequent seasons on her own.  Columbo is just plain amazing.

I consider myself a younger fan of Peter Falk. He was an adorable man and really fun actor to just sit and listen to. I have to admit, I did cry a little when he passed away.

4896278,5,B005UXJNPU,"Columbo was always one of my wife's favorite shows, so I decided to get this set for her birthday this summer. I'll have to say I'm pleasantly surprised.

Not all transfers of older TV shows come off well, but this one is excellent. The picture is sharp, with vibrant colors. The picture is so sharp that it even looks good without setting the TV's display ratio to 4:3, which for many older shows is an absolute requirement to get the best image. The sound is accurate without distortion, though at times it will drop out for a second. If there is a quibble, it is that there is film damage occasionally evident in the presence of little flickers of spots.

All of the original Columbo mystery movies are included in the set ... even the original movie made and aired years before the series started. Plus all of the later special TV movies are in the set. So if it's Columbo, it's here.

While I always enjoyed Columbo myself, I'll admit that I often had to take him in small doses. LOL I like Peter Falk, I like the mysteries and the writing, I like the guest stars, but sometimes I sort of wished that the murderer would pull out a gun and end Columbo's endless nagging. :-) Often the guest star murderer was a much more entertaining and sympathetic character than Columbo, and if they didn't start out that way, you certainly had some sympathy for them before the movie was over. Despite that, I enjoy the shows, and am well familiar with all of them.

4896290,4,B005UXJNPU,"Can't say enough about the series - loved it then and love it now.

I got a great deal on this complete series, but I have a bad DVD (Disk 3 of Season 2), and Amazon hasn't bothered responding to my concern.  I've noticed other reviewers with bad disks, and guess that they too are out of luck.  With 93 shows/movies, it can take some time to watch them all.  I received this set in April, and am on Season 4 right now, but it could be several more months before I complete the entire set.  Am I supposed to watch it all within the first month to make sure there aren't any issues?  Amazon - how about replying to me now and make this right?  It's just not fair that I am stuck with a defective set.

The only problem I had with this particular set was one of the discs were damaged. It looked like the damage occurred in the factory. The return policy setup by Amazon functions almost too well. It was taken care of so fast that you can find yourself unprepared, so have a paper and pencil handy when you contact them. I am still watching the series and have not quite yet gotten through them all and I watch one per night. The extras that come with this set will also delight most viewers.

4896305,4,B005UXJNPU,"I've watched him bumble, stumble, and rumble his way since I was a teen. It's a credit to the writing, the guest stars and Mr. Falk to pull off so many of these TV Movies (Mystery-Movie-of-the-Week Series, etc.) when you saw who killed the person in the beginning. You'd think it would get tiring, and I believe no one but Peter Falk could pull it off so successfully. The way the DVD's were dished out in small numbers at a high price kept me from buying all but the first one set. We had a local channel that showed an episode every week and that was fine. The price of this bundle sometimes remains high, then drops for awhile. I think I got it for about $55 and if you're a fan, and haven't bought almost every release of those small expensive packs, you should buy it.",1371859200,6,773,4.26530612244898

They are well written and Peter Falk makes the character lovable.  Some of the prints of the show are bad. The producers should have digitally restored them the best they could.
I haven't gotten into the later years of the mysteries yet, but Columbo has been pretty consistent through the first five seasons.

Okay, the series was a bit formulaic, but that was the payoff, the Perry Mason moment where the villain admits his wrongdoing because Pete has him boxed in, in front of either everyone involved or enough cops to make it stick.

No cell phones, rotary dials, Brick phones in the fanciest cars.  the formula of seeing who the killer is first, is probably not going to do well with todays generation but they may enjoy the bizzarre lack of technology when computers were room filling, and you had to find a pay phone to call people, and everyone smoked and drank at work.",1370822400,5,486,4.5
4896321,5,B005UXJNPU,"A funny thing happened when I was trolling around Amazon, trying to decide which rather pricy two-episode set I should buy of Commissario Montalbano (my favourite Italian detective), when somehow--not sure how--I stumbled on the complete series of ""Columbo"" at half price. ""Why not?"" I thought. ""For old times' sake! What does it matter if the series is a bit old fashioned?""

Well, about the only old-fashioned thing about this quality detective series are the cars which, rather appropriately, resemble huge moving coffins (I am, of course, overlooking the telephones, the hairstyles and other tell-tale signs of the 'seventies). Having watched only the first four episodes, so far, I am happy as a couple of clams, and I cannot believe my luck at having acquired such a great pearl at so little a price.

So what's to love in these mysteries that are not so much ""Who-Done-It?"" as ""How-Done-It?"" Well, just about everything. I love the subtle comedy--Columbo, for instance, fumbling about in the background, dropping things or fiddling with his cigar, trying to find a match, or a pen--as the slick murderer, whose arrogance is his/her undoing, becomes increasingly irritated, while Columbo--the eternal schlub--inevitably closes in. I also love the touches of surrealism (for instance, watching the coverup of the murder take place through the reflection of Robert Culp's glasses--and I can hardly wait for the episode in which Columbo--closing in on a homicidal artist--becomes part of the painting).

The casts are simply to die for. In addition to Peter Falk's underplayed over-playing of the title role, we have A-list actors, including Culp, Ray Milland, Lee Grant for starters), and the various guest directors (including Stephen Spielberg) are splendid, as are the opulent settings. The murderers always come from the top drawer of wealth, and it is so much fun to watch them being brought low by the scruffy Lieutenant Columbo, who, pestering them with ""just one more thing,"" drives all the villains to the point of distraction, before he closes in on them.

In abstract terms, Columbo portrays the triumph of the little man over the great and powerful, a potent image in tough economic times. In concrete terms, Columbo rewards the viewer with pure enjoyment and entertainment: the gold standard of television that, unfortunately, seems to have vanished along with the economy.

How lucky we are to have this collection!

The show is set up as a reverse whodunit(you see who commits the crime in the beginning)  and you spend the rest of the episode watching Peter Faulk try to gather enough evidence through his false ineptitude to catch his murderer.

4896327,5,B005UXJNPU,"Viewing this great collection is like visiting with a large group of old friends.  So many of the great TV and movie stars appeared in the remarkably long run of this series.  Many of them have passed away, so the set is an opportunity to see them in their prime.  The collection combines what they defined as the ""series"" and what they identify as the ""made for TV movies"".  No matter what they call them, it's a lot of fun.  The standard plot gag where the guilty party attempts to help Colombo solve the case is somewhat bothersome, but the trail of clues is still there for getting.  It's as comfortable to wrap yourself up in as that ancient raincoat that Peter Falk brought in from his home closet.

I didn't get into the series until very late in its first run on network television, so it's been great seeing a lot of the older episodes for the first time.  The series was produced during a time when Universal was cranking out a lot of TV series and it wasn't unusual for you to recognize one of their sound stage sets used over and over in multiple TV series.  ""Columbo"" however, used a lot of real California locations for their plots---you'll see some spectacular mansions and villas.  And, if you're a motorhead, you'll get a charge out of seeing lots of huge old luxury automobiles from the '70's. Some of the greatest guest murderers are Robert Culp, Ray Milland, and Patrick McGoohan.  Buy it!  You'll love it!",1370390400,2,875,4.717105263157895

4896357,5,B005UXJNPU,"I'll be the first to admit that I am greatly biased toward Columbo.  I absolutely adore the late, great Peter Falk and have been a fan of his most famous character since childhood.  There really isn't much one can say negative about this series except that with just 69, there were too few episodes/movies!

Peter Falk was always brilliant in everything he was in.  He was equally as comfortable in a flat-out comedy role as he was drama.  He brought all of his characters to life and you cared about them because they had that something special that a truly good character always does.

Lt. Frank Columbo was no exception to that.

The good Lt. always had an idea from the start who the murderer was.  The joy of each episode was watching him expertly lead the killer into giving him/herself away.  It didn't matter how carefully they thought they had planned out the crime, once Columbo was on the case, he would exploit their greatest weaknesses and end up letting the bad guy catch himself.

Along the way, there was a lot of humor to lighten the atmosphere, but the shows never turned into a comedy.  Let's face it, murder isn't exactly a light-hearted thing so it can always be welcome when our hero can bring a smile into an otherwise dark situation.  Whether it was always commenting on what he and Mrs. Columbo enjoyed or liked (Mrs. Columbo has to have had some of the most eclectic interests and tastes of any human being as she was a fan of everyone and everything!), Columbo whistling ""This Old Man"" or even bringing Dog along on the investigation, he could always make you smile.  Rarely did he lose his temper and even when he did, you couldn't fault him for it.

The ""Columbo"" series can also boast something that so precious few series of today can:  superior writing.  A good mystery is nothing if the writing is poor and doesn't have the characters to back it up.  The crimes in ""Columbo"" were unique for their time and kept you on your toes looking for that one thing that told Lt. Columbo that his prime suspect was guilty.  The supporting characters were just as well-written as the regular series characters.  None of them were there just for the sake of bringing in a big name guest star.  They had background and could be pretty complex.

And about those guest stars.  Some of the biggest and best names in Hollywood were on the receiving end of Lt. Columbo's razor-sharp wit or were the victim he fought so hard to find justice for.  Leonard Nemoy, George Hamilton, Patrick McGoohan (he also directed five episodes), Robert Culp, Robert Vaughn, William Shatner, Jeanette Nolan, Ray Milland, Jack Cassidy, Ida Lupino, John Dehner, Leslie Neilson, Dean Stockwell, Dabney Coleman and dozens of others.  To say ""Columbo"" was 'star-studded' would be an understatement.  We even get to see Peter Falk's real-life wife, Shera Danese in six episodes.

Along with well-known actors and actresses, some of the cream of the Hollywood crop worked behind the scenes.  Steven Speilberg, Steven Bochco and Johnathan Demme served in roles of directors and writers.  Two of the episodes were based upon two of Ed McBain's ""87th Precinct"" novels.  Even Peter Falk himself served a double role as actor and director for the last episode of the first season.  Henry Mancini and Mike Post were two of the many, and very talented, composers who worked on the show.  Over the course of its run, Columbo won thirteen Emmys and two each of Edgar Awards and Golden Globes.  Well deserved recognition for such a fine show!

There is a reason why ""Columbo"" ran from 1968 to 2003.  The quality of the acting and writing was top-notch,  The story lines were unique and compelling.  It was a pleasure to learn a new Columbo movie was on the network schedule because you knew that the two hours you would spend watching the show meant a great way to spend an evening with good entertainment that challenged your mind.

Oh, and just one more thing...you'll really regret it if you don't add this brilliant complete series to your DVD collection.  Anyone who is a fan of well-written, brilliantly acted drama would be proud to own this collection!",1369094400,,4139,4.697222222222222

4896359,4,B005UXJNPU,"COLUMBO might not be for the mystery lover who sits on the edge of a chair, biting his/her nails. But if you want to enjoy a unique character - always wearing his 'tell tale' raincoat, in a great range of situations....and solving the problems (often) in amazingly ""simple"" ways, you will really like Columbo.

Even if you select 4:3 display, it still looks terrible. I'd much rather see the original unstretched version in 4:3...I can stand the black bars on the side for the true original look and content.

You will also find a few ""bonus"" episodes of ""Mrs. Columbo"". The only bonus of this is the producers finding a place to palm off a few of these turkeys...truly horrific. It's not Kate Mulgrew's fault, its the writing/concept.",1369094400,,554,4.831578947368421

4896392,5,B005UXJNPU,"What took Universal so long to release this box set? Columbo has been and always will be one of the most iconic characters in television history. Emmy Award/Golden Globe Award winner Peter Falk (also a two time Academy Award nominee) was perfect as the rumpled, disheveled Lieutenant (no first name ever mentioned) Columbo. Making the criminal du jour believe he was a buffoon and incompetent moron, and that they were going to get away with the crime. While we the viewer knew from the outset that Columbo knew immediately who the culprit was. (To quote Ralph Kramden ""You know that I know that you know that I know""). Columbo was also my father's favorite show of all times. We would watch it on Sunday afternoons on A&E or one of those cable stations, him in NY and me in FL and reminisce about the episode when we would speak later. Dad would have loved this box set especially as there doesn't seem to be room on cable for these type of shows anymore. Reality nonsense has taken over because it's cheap to make. And to think Bing Crosby was offered the role but turned it down. That was the best decision (for the fans) that ""Der Bingle"" ever made. The box set is also packed well in regular DVD cases with each disc on its own notch. And the price??? At $56.99 for 34 discs that averages out to about $1.68 per disc and with 69 episodes $0.87 per episode. While I would never condone internet pirating I almost feel like I did steal this (which of course I didn't). If you love Columbo then this is every fans dream collection. There are also a few episode's of ""Mrs. Columbo"" that starred Kate Mulgrew and ran for about 13 episodes. I will admit to never watching them before but I will watch the episodes in this collection with an open mind. Highly recommend to anyone who loves Columbo, but then, who doesn't? :-)",1369094400,,1823,4.4774774774774775

My only gripe is, the description does not indicate all tv movies are included in this box set, I ended up purchasing two dvds for the mystery movie collection, but was able to return them because of amazon's great return policy!

4896421,5,B005UXJNPU,"Growing up I enjoyed watching Columbo. I got the collection on a whim. I figured it would mostly sit on the bookshelf and I'd maybe watch an episode here and there when I was bored and had nothing else to do. Wrong!! LOL!! I'm on season 4 now only after having it about 4 weeks. I actually don't recall any of the episodes I've seen so far (guess it was just to long ago), but I do remember Columbo's mannerism and I'm enjoying watching him again. Now I normally do not buy old TV series because the plot/story lines tend to be to outdated for me to really relate to them now. I'm not really having that problem with this series. The only fault I see in some of the episodes is that without the perpetrator's confession, I don't think the evidence would have stood up in court, but that can be said for just about any reccurring crime drama, even today's. So, all in all I think Columbo was a great crime drama and definitely worth having.",1367020800,,939,4.280898876404494

4896426,3,B005UXJNPU,"I have watched the entirety of the Columbo series, everything included in this complete set. Basically, I was happy to continue watching because the show is consistently good, though rarely great.

Columbo is eminantly likable, but paper thin. What do we get to know about him except he likes chili, is married, has a dog, has kids (mentioned exactly once, I think) and drives a Peugeot. We never even get a first name. His taste is middle brow; I think he bowls. Why does he drive a Peogeot?  This is never answered.  Even in the elongated movies, we get nothing more about him. we know more about his wife.

What is not paper thin is his relationship with the perpetrator of the crime. The best episodes involve Columbo getting into the head of the perpetrator and leading him or her into incriminating him/herself. I am thinking of Columbo convincing Robert Vaughn to incriminate himself on the cruise liner. The key to good episodes is the actor playing the perpetrator of the crime, which is pretty strange for a crime drama (though i might call it a melodrama.) There are plenty of good actors in the role of the perpetrator.

The show has a distinct formula - watch the crime commited, then wonder how Columbo will solve the crime. In some formulaic shows, like House MD, deviations from the norm lead to the best drama. This is not the case with Columbo. When a psychopath kidnaps Columbo's nephew's bride, Columbo never interacts with the criminal, and the attempt at high drama fails.

One of my pet peeves is the intro to the non-movie episodes which contain tidbits of the show to follow. As someoe who has watched before, I don't want to be reminded of what is to follow; I try to ignore the intro.

I might have given this a 4th star but the movies are lengthened with largely with filler and have many of the weaker stories.

Columbo is not riveting, but is still a staple.",1366329600,14,1888,4.5816023738872405

4896430,5,B005UXJNPU,"First of all, the price for all seven seasons and the complete collection of Columbo movies can't be beat!  The DVDs are of good quality and packaged well.

These are unique mysteries in that the viewer knows who the killer is almost from the beginning of the show.  The real mystery is determining what mistakes the killer makes and how Columbo will solve the case from the minute details that ""puzzle"" or ""bother"" him. His bumbling, deferential manner causes the murderers to underestimate his powers of deduction.  That is their downfall, as Columbo always gets his man (or woman) even though his ability to acquire the proof he needs seems unlikely if not impossible.  It's only in the last few minutes that the surprise ending is revealed, sometimes even gaining him admiration from the killer.

The Columbo series consists of fun, challenging mysteries with lots of famous guest stars.  It's a must-have for any mystery buff's DVD library!",1365552000,14,945,4.943037974683544

4896448,5,B005UXJNPU,"And I bought it twice.

This is The Complete Columbo -- all 69 episodes, for roughly a buck twenty-five per, including tax. It's an amazing (Amazon?) deal on *the* signature police procedural of the 1970s. And given that a third of the episodes run from 1989 - 2003, well beyond that decade.

What I mean by buying it twice, is that I collected the individual DVD releases largely as they came out: I got the 1970s series for my wedding (yes, really) and then as new ones were sold, I bought them. Then, when the complete slipcased versions that are in this set released on my son's 20th birthday, I knew I'd be getting it to replace my aging versions. Now I have.

This set has every episode, including the original ""Prescription: Murder"" and the pilot ""Ransom for a Dead Man."" Then there are 43 episodes from the 1970 ""regular"" NBC series, and 24 of the later TV movies from ABC. You can get details from the usual sources -- some ran as 90 minutes with commercials, some were two hours -- and etc. etc. The only technical point: when the ""first"" or ""old"" DVDs came out, they ended up in 10 cases --

1. Season One
2. Season Two
3. Season Three
4. Season Four
5. Season Five
6. Seasons Six and Seven
7. 1989 TV Movies
8. 1990 TV Movies
9. 1991-1993 TV Movies
10. 1994-2003 TV Movies

-- with of course several discs in each DVD case.

But with the new release of the complete series, there are eight cases, achieved by grouping 7+8 and 9+10 of the ""first"" / ""old"" DVD cases. But the discs themselves, within the cases, are set-up the same. So you'll have eight DVD cases (six white from the 1970s, two black for the 1980s - 2000s) in one slipcase box.

As far as content, you may already have some experience of that. Or perhaps not. Either way you're in for a treat. Columbo is awesome. And, as Victor Kiam might say, I liked it so much I bought the company: I'm writing The Columbo Case Files, and consequently have spent a lot of time watching these episodes again and again, thinking about the stories, then writing on them.

Oh, and just one more thing ... ; ) ... the DVD cases are all plastic now, with the slipcase a solid cardboard. Previously, under the old / first releases, the outer cases were thin cardboard that began to fray after a couple dozen viewings ...

I hope you enjoy the complete series.

Thanks kindly,

Paul

Peter Falk was an iconic detective and the conceit of the series - to actually show the murder and who did it - and then watch as Columbo put all the pieces together - and STILL hold your interest (rule of them: NEVER let the audience get ahead of the main character lest he seem dumb) was brilliant. the set includes all the seasons of the series plus all the TV movies - all in one box.

It's worth the money, mine was on sale for 69.99$ one weekend, and if you open an amazon credit card, you get 30$ off so I ended up paying 39.99 $ . Honestly I was going to pay the original price of 129$ if it wasn't on sale.

4896468,5,B005UXJNPU,I ordered this set from Amazon and was very happy with how quickly it came.  The picture quality was much better than expected. I loved this series growing up and (interesting enough) it stands up to the test of time much better than most detective series. I liked the format of the show as it was different from other murder mysteries on TV at that time.  In Columbo you see the murder happen and know who the killer is and how they commited the murder from the start.  The switch from other shows is that you don't know how Columbo is going to solve it till the end when he pulls off some trick to solve it.  Very Agatha Christie like. There is always a little cat and mouse game between Columbo and the killer that keeps the episodes moving quickly. The very best part is the guest stars.  They are always excellent character actors that bring the murderers to life.  Wonderful to watch again!

For those who aren't familiar with the Columbo format, it is a unique TV detective show. The viewer gets to see the bad guy commit the crime, and the rest of the show is all about Columbo's unique ""process"" as he sorts it all out. Truly unique! I've seen them all several times over the years, but I never tire of them.

I liked Mr. Hollow's write up.  Thank yo very much.  I pull out my Columbo DVD's and have a weekend marathon with them.  Many big name stars were on his show and one of him was his good friend John Cassevetes.  I believe he was in about 4 of them.  What a great series to watch over and over.,1356739200,4,467,3.78125

4896496,5,B005UXJNPU,"This is a recent purchase. I've viewed two episodes so far.

PROS...The picture and sound quality are way beyond what I expected. Everything is crystal clear. No commercials either. There are no double-sided discs. Every disc is nicely secured in its case. Nothing falls out or flops around when I open the case.

MINOR CONS...I would have preferred more detailed information about each episode, such as which main actor starred that week. Some write-ups mention it, but others don't. I have to remove some discs first to read the synopsis covered by that disc. I was hoping to be able to locate and watch my favorite episodes first, but the synopsis really doesn't help me to remember which is which. A detailed pamphlet would have been appreciated. I've solved part of the problem by turning the paper jackets inside out, putting the synopsis facing the outside of the cases.

All-in-all I'm very pleased with this purchased. All Columbo fans will be thrilled to receive this set as a gift or to buy it for themselves. At $79.49 the price can't be beat.",1354838400,127,1055,4.785714285714286
4896497,5,B005UXJNPU,"O-K, so the evidence would NEVER hold up in a real court; and real cops aren't as nice; intelligent; or as conscientious as Columbo - things that would normally turn me off of any other show....but Columbo is much more than any other show! Despite my opening criticisms, this is a show that one can become totally engrossed in. It keeps you engrossed from beginning to end- not with gimmicks, like action or gore, but with intrigue. Yes, I said intrigue- even though we know at the start who committed the crime; the intrigue enters when we try and fathom how Columbo will solve it! Truly a brilliant concept for a show, and so well executed in this series. In addition, there is always amusement/humor at Columbo's mannerisms; attire; car; dog, etc.

But wait- there's MORE! This series is a treasure trove of past acting greats whose names most generation-Xers such as myself may have heard of, but we have never really had the chance to see perform. These were actors and actresses who took the craft seriously and had some real talent- unlike most of the ilk that inhabits Hollywood today. Sheesh! I'll give you 18 actors of today for one Jack Cassidy!(Who is in three episodes!)

There's even more! Something about this show that I can't even put into words. It's the kind of show that you just want to sit and watch endlessly on a rainy night. It's pure entertainment, as it is so engrossing, and transports you to another world- as only the most well-made shows can. Not to mention the nostalgic aspect- as we get to see the cars and appliances and decor and fashion of the upper-middle-c lass-and-above world of the period (Which, in my case, brings back so many memories of how much better the world was then).

I am SO thankful to be able to have the entire series to watch whenever I want and without commercials! Some of these eps I haven't seen since they first aired (Yes, I was a fan of this show even when I was 10 !!)- If you're already a fan of this show, you wouldn't be reading these reviews; if you have never seen Columbo.....you are in for a rare treat. This show is totally unique. I don't like cop shows in general- but this is no mere cop show! And it is suitable for everyone and the entire family, as there is no real violence shown, nor profanity. Even in the few scenarios where the villains are involved in affairs, you never see anything that you'd have to censor. A true class-act. This one has truly stood the test of time: I enjoyed it when I was 10- and I enjoy it even more now that I'm 50 !",1354320000,419,2528,4.432258064516129
4896498,5,B005UXJNPU,"I am a fan of Columbo TV series. When I saw that a complete series collection was on DVD I purchase it right away. The color of this Columbo series is excellent but it is in the 4:3 format which have bars on the right and left sides of the widescreen television. There are three programs on each DVD and three DVDs in each DVD case. If you are a Columbo fan I highly recommend this Columbo series.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Columbo-The-Complete-Series/dp/B008RJ6TTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Columbo: The Complete Series</a>",1353801600,11,568,5.773809523809524

And, perhaps, the very first one that actually SHOWED YOU WHO DID IT AT THE VERY BEGINNING and then proceeded to hold your interest the entire rest of the show.  Truly one of the very first and only series that managed to pull that off.

Highly recommended.  And a revelation for every new generation of TV watchers...",1353715200,,368,4.447761194029851

The only thing I don't like are the previews of other shows of that time period and genre at the beginning of each disc.  I guess they are hoping you will by the other sets.
