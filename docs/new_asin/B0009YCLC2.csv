2343314,4,B0009YCLC2,"I read the other review for this movie on this page, and I wonder if the author and I saw the same movie.

I agree that ""Faith of My Fathers"" did not show the full horror of what McCain went through.  But it showed enough (McCain in agony from injuries that he suffered ejecting from his plane, McCain getting the hell beaten out of him by his captors, McCain getting brutally tortured).  Remember, this was a made-for-TV movie, so there were limits on what could be shown (both for ratings and not to turn people's stomachs).

My quibbles are that at 90 minutes, the movie was indeed too short.  There was no reference to McCain's narrow escape from a terrible fire onboard the aircraft carrier that he served on.  McCain's life after his release from captivity is also missing (the movie could have been a miniseries).

""Faith of my Fathers"" may not be as wrenching as ""the Deer Hunter,"" but it's still a good movie and made me admire McCain all the more.",1126828800,10,957,4.497109826589595
2343315,2,B0009YCLC2,"Arizona Senator John McCain enjoys his present day life as an influential member of the congress, leading debates on important issues and influencing legislation. He often gets into conflicts over some of his stands, but none of these can compare to the conflict McCain experienced back in the late 1960's and early 1970's. It was during this time that McCain spent several years as a Vietnam prisoner of war. This event is the subject of this movie, which is based on McCain's book of the same name.

In this film, McCain is portrayed briefly during his teenage years but the majority of the movie's time is spent either in Vietnam (inside the prison) or at McCain's military school, the U.S. Naval Academy. The movie begins by showing McCain (who is played by actor Shawn Hatosy) operating a fighter plane over Vietnam. He is shot down and has to parachute to safety; landing in water where some local Vietnamese come to his rescue and then promptly turn him over to the proper authorities. The film then alternates back and forth between scenes in the prison and flashbacks to scenes in the Naval Academy.

There is some violence in this film, but it is nothing compared to what was actually experienced. And herein lies the main problem I have with this film. The director made this movie in a very toned- down fashion so that it would be mild enough to get past the censors and be shown on television. In order to accomplish this, he had to eliminate scenes of brutal violence; profanity; and tough talk. Because of this, the movie seems very unrealistic. If you have read McCain's book by the same name, then you know that the conditions and the treatment McCain and others like him endured were horrifying. None of this comes through in this movie. It comes across as a little rough and unpleasant, but nowhere near the awful, inhumane experience that it really was.

Another problem I have with this film (which stems from the first problem) is the attitude of actor Shawn Hatosy and others who play the POW's. Hatosy's McCain character seems very bland, and rarely does he voice any concern over the nightmare he is living through. You can tell he and the others are not happy, but about the only dialogue you get is when McCain and another prisoner talk through the walls, between cells, by placing a cup to the wall. There is no intelligent dialogue, discussion of escape, feelings about the war or the captors, or anything else. This, again, makes the film seem a little unrealistic.

This movie is 90 minutes in length and it needed to be another half hour (or more) longer to give the McCain story the attention and respect it deserves. McCain's story, as told in his book, would make for a great, dramatic, and powerful Hollywood motion picture about the atrocities of war. But the way it is presented in this film, his experience seems more like a bad day on the job than the horrifying experience that it really was.

McCain, and the viewing public, deserved better.",1126656000,33,2983,4.685114503816794
2343316,4,B0009YCLC2,"Based on the memoir of the same name, this story is the familiar one about United States Senator John McCain who survives a prison camp in Vietnam during his tour of duty.
The actors are somewhat unknown but familiar. The film was produced by Arts & Entertainment network which is probably why the tone of the violence was toned down in retrospect and some might say not enough.
I can't imagine what really happened to John McCain during his time there. I have not read his book but I do imagine that it was far more worse than the film portrays to be.
I think in all that the film does it's best despite probably a limited budget and a cast including an actor, Shawn Hatosy, who does a remarkable job in bringing to light about a man who is both complicated and likable.
The scenes in the prison camp were probably toned down immensely as if not to turn us off from the movie.
As a granddaughter of a POW during World War II, I can't imagine the horrors of the camps. For John McCain, he was offered amnesty and freedom long before he was actually released.
This film shows how his character was already defined by his family make-up, his first marriage, and his relationship with his military father.
Anybody else would have longed to escape such nightmarish conditions but JOhn would rather lie than give up his men or break the honor code even if it meant torture and killing.
This film can and should be shown to everybody in schools and the book should be read as well.",1224115200,,1475,4.426470588235294
2343317,4,B0009YCLC2,This was an excellent movie and should be seen by all Americans.  John McCain has a legacy left by his father and grandfather that is instilled in him.,1224028800,,151,4.392857142857143
2343318,4,B0009YCLC2,"This effective dramatization of Sen. John McCain's ordeal in the ""Hanoi Hilton"" prisoner of war camp for 5 years was actually released a few years ago, based on his memoir of the same name. It also deals delicately with his relationship with his father, both remote and adored, and the clearly the strongest influence in his life. It is very well acted, with a cast that I didn't recognize with the exception of Scott Glenn. In an interview with Sen McCain, he touches lightly on the accuracy of the set of the prison, and his feelings about seeing it.
Even if you read the book, the video is very worthwhile.",1222992000,,609,4.545454545454546
2343319,4,B0009YCLC2,"While not the highest quality of movie ever made, this movie does a tremendous service in highlighting the integrity and character of John McCain.  Whether or not you agree with him politically, this is a movie that should be should be seen by every American that is voting this fall.  This tells the story of McCain's naval service with much of the focus on his time in a North Vietnamese POW camp.  McCain deserves our respect and honor for the service he has provided to this country, regardless of whether he gets your vote.",1218326400,,528,4.595744680851064

2343321,5,B0009YCLC2,I had seen this movie on tv a while back but wanted to see it again and have the movie for my own. It shows John McCain as a true hero. This movie was not only entertaining but history that all should see as to what our men went through in the Viet Nam War. A movie worth watching more than once and to be handed down in the family.,1214524800,3,332,3.757142857142857
2343322,5,B0009YCLC2,"Though the book provided far more details, the movie was very stirring and moving. It provided greater insight into the life of John McCain (focused mostly on his time in the Hanoi Hilton, of course).  An incredible story about an incredible man.",1202428800,7,246,4.857142857142857
2343323,1,B0009YCLC2,"when you cast your prospect of becoming a future presidential candidate, there are lot of things you've got to do one by one:
first, write several books with hired ghost writers to promote yourself to the american public, showing and telling them how brave you were, how you did for your country, how and why and why not we should and should not about this and that, writing a memoir, and giving a chance to transcribe it into a movie. hero or not, you've got to do something before the campaign and the nomination. and you would not give media a wrong impression that you are neither hawk or dove republican, you're right in the middle. you never hurt or mud-sling anybody, a perfect gentleman.
by building up this man-in-the-middle image, even you've been insulted by the other candidate, saying you''ve got mental problem, and your wife got something to do with drugs....you never fought back, you just turn your other cheek to your opponents....well, the possibility of becoming a more likable presidential candidate would be much much larger. just bear in mind, this movie and that book are just like a p.b.s. commercial, never showing it's ultimate target is not your pocket or your wallet but a future ballot. this movie sucks, big time.",1153699200,2,1244,4.790697674418604
2343324,2,B0009YCLC2,"This movie was a very short made for cable movie, quick overview of what happened to John McCain during his tour in Vietnam.  I am sure if the movie was longer it would have more details of John McCains experiences, this movie is more like an appetizer, makes you want to research more about the POW experience.  The movie 'Hanoi Hilton' is much more detailed and shows the hardship these pilots had to endure.",1142294400,6,410,4.527027027027027
2343325,4,B0009YCLC2,"When I heard that they were making a film adaptation of John McCain's excellent memoir ""Faith of My Fathers"", I was excited until I learned that it was a made for cable TV movie. Had it been an HBO or Showtime production, it might have been a whole lot better, but as is, its adequate for the job.

I'm a fan of bio-pics and think every important historical figure should have one (I'm still waiting on serious film versions of all our Founding Fathers). When I saw that this film was a rather skimpy 90 minutes, I knew that wouldn't do justice to Senator McCain's book. His lifestory is worth at least a two hour treatment. On the plus side, Sean Hatosy as John McCain was a great choice. Hatosy is fast becoming one of my favorite actors by his ability to emote perfectly with his facial expressions. Its easy to imagine a younger McCain as we watch Hatosy through the film.

Also on the plus side was the decision to not go the Mel Gibson route on the torture scenes. We get a taste of it without being made uncomfortable. However, while they spared us the details of those scenes, they also unfortunately skimped out on a lot of the Naval Academy segments that show the development of McCain's character. I wished that they would have given at least a half hour of scenes from his Naval Academy days instead of the brief few scenes we do wind up seeing. That's what made McCain the man he is, or at least part of the reason.

At any rate, its not a bad bio-pic on a great American hero. Of course, keep in mind that its not up to motion picture standards and reflects the budget of a cable TV channel. And if it leaves you wanting more, there's always John McCain's book to read and refer to for more details about his life. After I watched the film, I felt a tinge of sadness that he's not our president now. The world needs a man of his character to lead our nation in the troublesome twenty-first century.",1134000000,13,1912,4.335195530726257

Checked Amazon & found it.  Thank you Amazon. Will watch again & again & recommend to everyone, especially those who were in Viet Nam & their peers and loved ones.  I believe those who are too young to  remember that era should view also. All will gain an appreciation of a living Hero and incredible Patriot in John McCain!!!
