8042267,1,B0006Q0A7Q,"This has got to be THE WORST excuse for a documentary I have EVER come across. This DVD left me feeling that not only did I waste money buying it, but it was a waste of time to even watch it. This amateurish production looked like a bad effort produced with off the shelf software on someone's computer. The footage was nothing more than rip-offs of news footage, documentaries and home videos. Don't be fooled by the ""As Seen on TV"" marking on the cover. I am POSITIVE that this ""program"" NEVER was seen on anyone's TV except the hacks that produced it and the fools (like me) who bought it. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS DVD. JUST PASS THIS ONE BY AND CONTINUE LOOKING AT THE OTHER WORTHWHILE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE ON AMAZON.",1175904000,3,751,4.449275362318841
