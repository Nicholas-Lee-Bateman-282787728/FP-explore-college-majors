8112219,5,B000EOU4N0,"awesome footage. great music. truly the soul of surfing. I do prefer these types of surf movies over the ones where the surfers are allowed to make comments. I prefer to watch surfing instead of the youthful, very naive comments of some of the younger, albeit talented surfers out there.",1421798400,,287,4.76

8112221,5,B000EOU4N0,"This is the third installment in the moonshine conspiracy series, and possibly the best.  Threads together a series of moving, inspiring stories, with good footage, all under the auspices of renting out a shack in Oz with your buddies and surfing empty peaks, and shaping boards. Not your typical surf ""hack and attack"" 30 minute montage, but will probably get you more amped for a lifetime of surfing and surf culture.  Makes you proud to be a part of the sport and way of life.  check it out, I highly recommend it.  Especially if you liked thicker than water, september sessions, or brokedown melody. Oh, and did I mention a great soundtrack-->Mason Jennings, Jon Swift, White Buffalo, etc.",1274140800,6,693,4.8474576271186445
8112222,3,B000EOU4N0,"If you have ever received the above titled e-mail you'll know what I mean. This movie has all the cliches you'd expect in an action movie. The bad guy has an automatic weapon which hits everything but the hero. The hero,of course,can't miss with his pistol. This is still an enjoyable action video with decent, believable performances even though the ending is sort of a we-can't-figure-out-any-other-way-to-save-them ""Greek Chariot from the Gods"" type rescue. I actually wanted to give it 3 1/2 stars as it is well acted and fun to watch.",1033171200,,539,4.934065934065934
8112223,5,B000EOU4N0,"Probably the best of John Allen Nelsons movies so far, this action packed urban western is filled with complex characters and challenging situations.  The bad guys display layers of loyalty and honour and the good guys interpretation of the straight & narrow is rooted firmly in the real world.  While all the actors turn in admirable performances, Nelson displays a range that, clothes on or off, make him well worth watching.
This one is worth owning!",1009411200,,453,4.947368421052632
8112224,3,B000EOU4N0,"Although this action/adventure film is a bit clich&eacute;, I enjoyed the characters and their interraction with each other. A pleasant hero (John Allen Nelson), his potential girlfriend and an overly-exuberant bunch of  Greek homeboys (including her husband!) all tangle with each other and  telegraph their next move to you, the bemused viewer. It was fun . . . and  the ending, albeit implausible, made me smile.",951523200,,415,5.257575757575758
