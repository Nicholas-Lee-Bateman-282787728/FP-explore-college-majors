Okay, those of you that have been collecting these GAW series from Platinum already know that there are many of these discs to choose from. Over 30 I have seen so far. There are single volumes with 4 or 5 films on each disc, and there are multi packs ranging anywhere from 2 to 10 discs. Each volume is in it's own keepcase,and have been enhanced in 5.1 audio. The pictures are not Criterion like transfers; some are very old and show their age, but, usually there is nothing to detract from the fun of these films. Earlier single volumes 1-10 are each usually devoted to a particular star. The later volumes 11-20 seem to have a theme running through each(tough guys, frontier women, American Indians, etc). I haven't gotten much further on the later volumes after 20, except for a John Wayne package, that includes Vol. 24(John Wayne 2DVD). Just to confuse us, Platinum calls the multipacks as well as the single volumes, Vols 1,2,3, etc. You can usually tell by the price how many are in each item, and sometimes they will even say in the product info. Also, some of the multi-packs have an 's' after the word Western, to make them plural. Oater lovers, really can't go wrong for this price.

So...This Vol 3 is a two disc set, that contains Vols 5 and 6 of the single editions(are ya still with me?)These two are fabulous fun for lovers of our beloved singing cowboys, Roy Rogers and Gene Autry.  I did load up the discs to make sure that the films were what the box says. I love Platinum for putting together these oaters for us, but every once in a while they make a goof on the box listings; and wouldn't you know there was a boo-boo on one of these(I'll explain below).

Vol 5 stars Gene Autry. There are 4 films. Three from the 30's and one from the late 40's. They run from a little less then an hour to a little over an hour.

1949 - ""Riders of Whistling Pines"" with Patricia White, and Jimmy Lloyd.""Champion"" also gets top billing.

1937 - ""The Big Show"" with Smiley Burnette, Kay Hughes and Sally Payne.

1937 - ""Springtime in the Rockies"" Smiley Burnette,Polly Rowles.

1937 - ""Boots and Saddles"" - Smiley Burnette,Merrill McCormack. This one was directed by Joseph Kane

Vol 6 is a real treat for Roy Rogers fans. One from the 30's and the rest from the 40's. Most run over an hour.

5 films with Roy, featuring Gabby Hayes(who always seems to havea problem with 'those dern parsnickity females'), Dale Evans, and of course ""Trigger"" is no slouch in the acting department either!

1946 - ""My Pal Trigger""

1943 - King of the Cowboys""

1943 - ""Song of Texas""

""Utah""..this is the one that they misprinted on the box. It is Roy and Gabby and the gang from a mid 40's film, but the box, has it listed as a Tex Ritter film. Also this one does not show up on the first page of the Menu, you have to play with the directional buttons on your remote until it takes you there.

1948 - ""Under the California Stars"", also show Andy Devine starring in this one.

So if you love these cowboys and gals, you'll have fun with this one. And ... you know with our guys and gals in these films, there will be lots of singing involved as well!

Happy Trails to All..Enjoy..Laurie",1138924800,,3226,4.404040404040404
