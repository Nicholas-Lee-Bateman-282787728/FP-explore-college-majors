2219951,5,B0007M2234,"Orson Welles' 1937 ""Julius Caesar"" is the longest running Broadway production of the play. Welles played Brutus. In 1938, Welles' On-the-Air Mercury Theatre broadcast ""War of the Worlds"". It was a hoax. But it caused a nationwide panic. Listeners were convinced that the Earth was being invaded by Mars. RKO Studios signed Welles to direct ""Citizen Kane"" in 1941. It is regarded by many as the Best Film ever made. Welles had conquered stage, radio, and the cinema. Criterion has just released the flawless, two-disc DVD, ""F For Fake"", an anamorphic, digitally-restored transfer(1.66:1).  Disc One is Welles' 1976 essay/documentary; a non-linear, freeze-frame interview of art forger Elmyr De Hory, culled from 35mm and blown-up 16mm. Elmyr's biographer, Clifford Irving, is later exposed as the fraudulent chronicler of Howard Hughes. ""F For Fake"" features Joseph Cotten, Laurence Harvey, and Welles' mistress, Oja Kodar. Filmed in France, Rome, and southern California, ""F For Fake"" includes shots of Howard Hughes' bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. It was the last film Welles ever directed. Extras include a Peter Bogdanovich introduction, a nine-minute trailer(curiously un-restored), and a commentary track. Disc Two contains the elusive 88-minute documentary, ""One-Man Band"". It has never been available before on film, video, or DVD( I saw it once 2 years ago on late-night cable). The 1995 ""One-Man Band"" examines Welles' lost/unfinished movies. This treasure trove includes scenes from ""The Other Side of the Wind"", ""The Deep"", and, reportedly, his mysterious ""Don Quixote(A work in progress, on-and-off, for 15 years)"". Welles stares into the camera, pauses, and recites Herman Melville in fragments of his ""Moby Dick"". He is electrifying. The process is staggering; and finally heart-breaking. So much talent, and finally, a sense of loss. Disc Two has another stunning documentary, an essay, a 60 Minutes excerpt, and a Howard Hughes press conference. Director, actor, writer, painter, magician. Orson Welles was, perhaps, the greatest auteur of the 20th Century. Big words. Big man. Big cigar. Welles once said that we are all really 2 or 3 different people inside. Or none of these at all. Was Orson Welles a fake?  Welles' classic 1958 ""Touch of Evil"" ended in these last lines:  Tanya: Isn't somebody gonna come and take him away?  Schwartz: Yeah, in just a few minutes. You really liked him, didn't you?  Tanya: The cop did..the one who killed him...he loved him.  Schwartz:  Is that all you have to say for him?  Tanya:  He was some kind of a man...What does it matter what you say about people?",1115337600,7,2617,5.22673031026253
2219952,5,B0007M2234,"Society consists of symbols with a wide range of meanings within the world.  The alphabet is one of most commonly used code systems of symbols.  The letters in the alphabet have the power to form words and every single word has a meaning.  When a number of words such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives fuse together, they form a sentence.  The structure of a sentence is to produce a contextual meaning, which sometimes uses symbolism to enhance the sentences in regards to the theme of the topic.  Several joined sentences create a paragraph, which usually focuses on one idea that also could be a symbol.  A number of ideas compiled into a narrative form makes a thesis for readers to contemplate, which could help the person either assimilate, or adapt the new ideas to previous knowledge and wisdom.  This is due to the notion that new ideas comprise a symbolic meaning for the individual.  Orson Welles seems to have used this concept when he made the film, F for Fake.

F for Fake playfully utilizes every single scene while maximizing the symbolic value of words, images, and behavior among the individuals portrayed in the film.  These scenes offer several representational impressions to the audience, as Welles' meticulous editing seems to have the same meaning a typewriter has to a writer.  In this sense, F for Fake does not offer a conventional film or documentary, as Welles uses both authentic film clips edited with stage performances.  Instead, Welles advocates his ideas in neither a fictionalized nor a non-documentary manner, as he fuses these two into a notion of deceit, forgery, trickery, and any other way that could deceive the audience.  In 1972 over a Parisian lunch with writer and film essayist Jonathan Rosenbaum he expressed that he was working on this film, which Welles referred to as a new kind of film.  The structure of the film brings the notion of a thesis where the candidate attempts to support his or her own thesis from a wide range of angles.  Each visual symbol has a meaning while the scenes form the visual sentences, as the different acts form paragraphs in this cinematic thesis.  The heavy editing, which Welles spent over a year on, describes Welles' cerebrally complexity while trying to defend this extraordinarily cinematic thesis.

In the beginning of the film Welles implies that a key he used for a magic trick ""...was not symbolic of anything.""  This, however, suggests another deceit, as the audience has already seen the sequence and had time to ponder the meaning of the key to which Welles is fully aware.  The pondering has already caused the audience to give the key a visual meaning, which the viewer has either assimilated or adapted to previous knowledge.  There is also a scene where the audience gets to follow a stunning woman in high heels and a short miniskirt , as several people open their eyes starring while salivating and car horns honk in the background.  Suggestively, the scene causes the audience to think that all the men probably are secretively wishing for the woman's company.  This too is a clever lie, as Welles simply has edited together a number of scenes which insinuate that people are starring while horns can be heard in the background.  Welles seems to suggest that what one sees cannot be believed, as what one sees might only be a fabricated version of the truth.

To comfort the audience Welles informs that the viewers that they will not be victims to deception as he places in writing that ""For the next hour everything in this film is strictly based on the available facts.""  This portion of the film leads the audience through a two-piece sequence about a famous art forger named Elmyr de Hory, Cliff Irving, and the eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes.  One focuses on Elmyr while the second part emphasizes Elmyr's biographer Irving who also was into forgery, as he wrote a forged autobiography by Howard Hughes who then lived secretively in a luxury Las Vegas penthouse.  This brings several of the previous notions back, as Welles continues to discuss the idea of deceit.  One of the interesting ideas in this sequence explains the meaninglessness of experts, as fakers cannot be troubled by experts.  One thing that Elmyr advises of is that no one should have the ultimate power to decide quality, as he himself probably fooled many so-called experts with his own forgeries.  This also implies that the expert could as well be the faker, if this one person knew what was good.  This notion would also suggest that this very review would be a fake, as it also does not express anything unique while it merely retells the design and purpose of the film.

F for Fake offers an intriguing cinematic thesis that crawls within the brain causing an itch that does not seem to want to leave.  The film is nothing like anything that Welles has done before, or after this film, which also supports what he has said in regards to the film.  One reason that no other film that he created since did not mimic this film could be the concept of the film, as it provides an opportunity for him to play with his own ideas in a visual manner.  This film took over a year for him to make, as it also seems to be a film of personal growth and understanding of the world as a whole.  The personal aspect of the film seems to saturate the whole experience, as he refers to himself while acting and making comments in regards to the people in film from behind the cutting board.  Ultimately, Welles attempts to erase the idea of him being the ""expert"", as he provides examples of his own forgery from when he provided the War of the Worlds over the radio, which caused mass hysteria throughout the United States.",1115078400,25,5693,4.731509625126646
2219953,4,B0007M2234,"Orson Welles, nearing the end of his career, built a philosophical fun house with ""F for Fake,"" stuffed full of questions about the nature of art and authorship, illusion and reality, lies and truth.

Welles took an unfinished documentary shot by someone else, tacked on some hocus-pocus at the beginning and end, mixed in spicy footage of his mistress and called it his latest movie. View the movie as one of the director's great works -- or just another Wellesian goof.

The 1972 movie -- a head-spinning piece of modern video art -- more or less profiles the Howard Hughes book faker Clifford Irving and the brilliant art forgerer Elmyr de Hory.

Welles, of course, was uniquely qualified to handle the intertwined stories of these con men, having perpetrated the great hoax of ""War of the Worlds."" ""We hanky-panky men have always been with you,"" Welles says.

Criterion brings ""Orson Welles's F for Fake"" to DVD in a typically generous double-disc set. Image quality varies, from the crisp scenes of narrator Welles wandering around in his cape to the grainy 16mm docu segments. (Most of the film is in color, unusual for Welles). The feature unspools in anamorphic widescreen with an aspect ratio of 1.66:1. On surround sound set-ups, the DVD's strong mono audio roosts in the center speaker.

Disc 1 offers a 6-minute introduction by Welles' pal Peter Bogdonovich, who provides much-needed orientation. ""It's sort of like visual music,"" Bogdonovich says of the movie's dizzying quick-cut editing and narrative quantum leaps. ""If you get on the film's wavelength ... it's riveting. If you fight it and expect it to be a linear thing, then you're not going to enjoy it.""

Oja Kodar, the director's mistress and co-writer of ""Fake,"" says the film is ""not just about fakery, it's about Orson."" Cameraman Gary Graver, who shares the DVD commentary with Kodar, says ""Fake"" is ""as close as you'll get to the real Welles.""

The cameraman turns actor in the 9-minute trailer for ""F for Fake,"" included on disc 1. More of a short film than ad, it was built around new footage shot by Welles. The ""Fake"" trailer's absurd length and nude shots of Kodar ensured rejection from the U.S. distributor.

On disc 2, the 1995 docu ""Orson Welles: The One Man Band"" spends an hour and a half profiling the director in his final years. It's shot in the style of ""F for Fake"" and produced by Kodar, who appears throughout.

The docu, in English and German, follows Welles around the globe as he attempts to finish his many projects, all rejected by Hollywood and its financiers. ""In Los Angeles, everyone only talks about 'crazy old Welles.' ... I must start over from scratch,"" the onetime prodigy sighed.

The docu shows extended clips from the director's aborted projects, among them ""The Merchant of Venice,"" the thriller ""The Deep"" and the wrapped but unedited ""The Other Side of the Wind."" Most look like decent but unreleasable student films. There are broad comedy bits starring the old man, some kind of funny.",1114819200,3,3002,4.857142857142857
2219954,3,B0007M2234,"Art is a lie that makes us feel good or at least recognize some of the truth. So much about art is an illusion and a hoax. So it's fitting that filmmaker, illusionist and prankster Orson Welles should make the art of illusion and hoaxes the central theme of his last complete film. ""F for Fake"" could be called a an essay on the art in illusion and the illusion in art.  Make no mistake, Welles's last film ""F for Fake"" isn't a great movie but, like all of Welles's films, it has enough greatest in it to make it worthwhile for fans of cinema.

Welles begins his ""documentary"" (which, in and of itself spoofs the whole genre) looking at art forger Elmyr de Hory and his biographer Clifford Irving (who also penned the fraudulent Howard Hughes autobiography that raised such a ruckus during the 70's). Welles proceeds to examine what's ""real"" and ""fake"". Welles includes himself in this examination of how we lie to get what we need and why people are so inclined to believe a lie. Welles was well known for padding his resume in the theater at the beginning of his career and, of course, he masterminded the War of the Worlds radio program that caused panic (although how much panic is truly open to question and, again, is part of the deceit of showbiz) among the general public in the 1930's. This nonlinear film ""essay"" is fascinating but those watching it shouldn't expect a straight ahead narrative. The last complete film by Welles, ""F for Fake"" may not match the classic grandeur of ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" or ""Touch of Evil"" but it has its own charms worth noting.

 Criterion has done a splendid job of restoring a film that was shot on the cheap. Portions of the film have always been grainy as they were blown up from 16mm to match the 35 mm footage that Welles shot himself.  The colors are brighter than the version of this film that I had seen in art theaters in the 80's and, while the mono sound doesn't have much presence, it sounds pretty decent overall. The sound comes across with nice clarity although it doesn't have much depth.

Criterion has done its usual thorough job putting together a nice package. Included as part of the package are two stunning documentaries on the films that Welles began but never finished (with tantalizing snippets from the unfinished ""The Other Side of the Wind"" starring John Huston) and a terrific documentary on art forger Elmyr de Hory. ""Orson Welles: One-Man Band"" made in 1988 examines the films that Welles began and abandoned or lost interest in during the last twenty years of his life. It's not a biography or even a career retrospective of the man but an examination of a truly restless spirit. I'd suggest that Welles had the equivalent of artistic Attention Deficit Disorder as he would start projects and  interest and move on to the next project on a whim.  By the way, if you plan on watching the movie don't watch the documentary first as it gives away a number of twists and turns in ""the plot"".

The Norweign Film Institute documentary on Elmyr de Hory is almost as fascinating as the documentary on Welles. It's clear that Welles felt a kinship with Clifford Irving and De Hory feeling as if his career had been little more than an illusion. He really had no career per se. Welles was a polymath of sorts. De Hory demonstrated a lot of flair as a painter early on in his career but found his niche in creating nearly perfect forgeries of other artist's great works. In a sense, this documentary examines the psychology behind De Hory's desire and need to copy other artist's work. It's a fascinating glimpse into the pathology of deceit.

The video introduction by Bogdanovich provides interesting insights on Welles. I only wish that he had been asked to do a running commentary on the film in addition to Graver. Boganovich touches on some of the themes that are recurrent in Welles' work including the fact that the art of cinema is an illusion all its own and just as much a form of deceit as a forgery copying the elements of life without capturing the essence. He also discusses the making of the movie and how Welles integrated an unfinished documentary, re-edited and rearranged the movie to create a ""documentary essay"". Also of interest will be the 9 minute trailer for the film. It's essentially, an original short film by Welles incorporating footage from the film and features a brief parody of the ""News on the March"" footage from ""Kane"".  Shot by Welles after the completion of the film, it's presented in black and white. The releasing studio decided not to put into theaters as it was so unconventional at the time.

The informative commentary by and star/co-writer Oja Kodar and director of photography Gary Graver  (""The Clones"", ""I Spit on Your Corpse"", ""Countess Dracula's Orgy of Blood"") whose career of shooting low budget horror films and exploitation films is appropriate to the very subject of this film gives considerable insight into Welles and his maverick methods as a film director. Although I would have preferred a commentary from Bogdanovich or, at the very least, the three working in tandem, Graver and Kodar between them have enough stories to keep the commentary track entertaining. Graver's comments about how Welles deliberately avoided anything that looked like a Welles shot indicated how much he wanted to continue to reinvent himself. Isn't reinvention a form, after all, of a hoax and forgery? Graver also discusses how hurt Welles was by Pauline Kael's nasty accusations that Welles had little to do with creating ""Citizen Kane"" and was no more than a mid-wife at the birth of a classic collaboration.

 Don't be deceived this isn't one of Welles' best films by any stretch of the imagination nor is it a bad. It's an oddity with Welles pushing the boundaries of the documentary genre. Regardless, it's a fascinating bit of filmmaking using unusual editing techniques to tell a story about lies.  Welles uses his charming personality and techniques as a film director to keep this film from becoming predictable. While it isn't a classic, ""F for Fake"" has a number of inspired moments and Welles plays with the preconceptions of the audience just enough to keep the film diverting. The documentaries included with ""F for Fake"" make this a must have particularly the glimpse into Welles' storage closet of unfinished films.",1114560000,8,6361,4.758620689655173

2219960,5,B0007M2234,"I am excited that Welles's absolutely sui generis examination of the con is available on Blu-ray.

The last major film Orson Welles completed, ""F for Fake"" is a hidden, seldom seen (except by Welles fans, which I am happy to declare myself) seventies classic that examines truth and fiction in documentary. Welles's channels his ability to be ahead of the curve. The film has a dual focus: one upon art forger Elmyr de Hory's amazing career; and another bolstered by a then-timely portrait, ever skewed, of Howard Hughs's ""hoax-biographer"" Clifford Irving, who set in stone the image of Hugh's decline and fall as a hirsuite, bearded OCD-riddled oddity.

For Welles's admirers, it seems there are those who love ""Citizen Kane,"" and ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" and perhaps ""Touch of Evil"" only, and those who value ""Chimes at Midnight,"" ""Othello,"" and others that reveal an artist who had not peaked in his first efforts but continued to evolve throughout his amazing career.

Like Gaddis's great, labyrinthine American novel, ""The Recognitions,"" ""F Is for Fake"" addresses many of the same questions, at a small, breezy 87 minute pace, and served as the film I kept checking out from university libraries when I hauled around Gaddis's entertaining if massive sprawling tome of a novel.",1408665600,28,1284,5.104761904761904
2219961,5,B0007M2234,"If you love films that challenge you to see the world differently, then this one is for you. I would argue that this is Welles at the height of his craft, calling out and exposing the hypocritical work of art critics throughout history.",1405296000,3,236,4.511627906976744

2219963,5,B0007M2234,"I loved the structure of this film.  Very often documentaries profess to be just telling it like it is, giving you the straight dope when actually they're leaving out another side of the story, other explanations of the story and just giving you one guy's opinion that fits the 30% of the story he showed you.  Those are more like filmed polemics.

This isn't a documentary, a form that's been a bit tarnished by the filmed polemics, it's an essay.  This is Welles speaking about forgery and authenticity in art using Francois Reichenbach's footage and adding his own.  And the double layering of Clifford Irving, a soon to be revealed fake, commenting on Elmyr's fakery just makes it that much sweeter.  The editing of the Picasso stills to create ""scenes"" of him being fascinated by Kodar was wonderful as were the surreptitious crowd reaction shots as she walked through the streets.

Along with the interesting discussion of Elmyr and the art world and Irving and his travails, I found the glimpses of Welles in his natural element fascinating, too.  We see what an artist of his era considered the good life, hanging out on Ibiza, eating the best food, drinking fine wine, laughing at the stories of other artists.  He was an adult, a man and not just a little boy physically but not mentally grown and suddenly with a lot of money.",1390953600,,1337,4.703862660944206

Secondly, I personally knew Elmyr D'Hory when he was living in New York in the 1970""s. We met at an art gallery show on Madison Avenue and instantly became fast friends. I knew him as ""Victor Morey"", a name he was using at that time. He told me
that he was an art dealer and an artist. Elmyr was a fascinating man who told marvelous stories about artists and places he lived
at in Europe. All the time I knew him, I had absolutely no idea who he really was...........the world's greatest art forger and a
homosexual. I visited his apartment several times and met the young woman he was living with. I also met many of his friends
and there was absolutely no indication of who he really was.

Years went by and Orson Welles' movie ""F For Fake"" was to be shown on television. I eagerly waited to see it and when it was
broadcast I watched it in total shock. It was about my old friend ""Victor Morey"", now shown to really be Elmyr D'Hory. I couldn't
believe my eyes. Elmyr was a wonderful friend whose memory I will always treasure. He once gave me a beautiful pencil drawing

It quickly becomes apparent that, this time, we're here for fun; the station is merely the setting for Welles' impromptu magic act amidst the joyous faces of enraptured children and delighted adults. As the scenery shifts to a coruscating studio backdrop, Welles begins our journey into the movie proper with a promise: everything we see during the next hour will be completely, and utterly, true.

As the final film completed by his own hand, ""F for Fake"" shows that Welles's cinematic eye remained young and vital well into his autumn years -- a being quite apart from the rotund Paul Masson-plugging caricature he became in popular imagination (a fake front, perhaps?). So even if the still incomplete ""The Other Side of the Wind"" never rears its head, we'll always have this lively, spritely, vivacious, and playful little cinematic epitaph composed almost entirely of quick cuts and bits of cast-off BBC documentary footage. ""F for Fake"" exhibits a burning drive to hammer all its disparate pieces into a narrative whole that tells a story of charlatanry and art, shot through with a sense of personal retrospective and biography. Basically, the film looks like the work of a young director with something to prove -- the separate montage bits forming a complete work of art that's also a blast to watch.

The Criterion DVD makes the best out of sometimes sub-par 16mm film material, but it's all sharp and clear -- the best we'll likely see this side of a proper Blu-Ray release.

Is it a documentary, a fantasy, a historical drama or an art film? Welles employs a crazed guerrilla documentary style, splicing half-conversations with notorious scammers on top of one another while concentrating on awkward close-ups, unflattering angles and incomplete thoughts. Orson handles most of the narration himself from a seat at the editing table, apparently in the process of chaotically piecing the final product together. It's a manic blend of jumbled thoughts that seems like something thrown together on a whim, after filming every instant of a lavish European vacation and poring over the footage for its most quizzical moments. For what it's worth, I could watch Orson carry on conversation with nobodies for hours at a time, and on the few occasions the film delivers just that, it reaches a certain peak. If Welles could've let this story tell itself without overproducing every instant, and later forcing himself into unnecessary dramatizations, it would have had my rapt attention. Instead, the second half nearly put me to sleep. A solid concept that's been overcomplicated and spoiled.",1299715200,3,1256,5.348484848484849
2219976,5,B0007M2234,"This is a brilliant documentary in essay form about the authentic and inauthentic, about the real and the fake.  Orson Welles took a documentary about Elmyr de Hory, master art forger, originally shot by a French director and reworked it so that it took on his own personality.  The documentary is exceptional and worth watching, but in order to get the full experience you really have to watch all the extras on the Criterion version.  What starts to emerge is a series of dualities or mirror images that are absolutely fascinating.  For example:

Orson Welles and Elmyr de Hory: both abused by those with money, both creating masterpieces.  Someone says of de Hory: what are they going to put him in jail for?  Committing masterpieces?  And Welles says that someone in another country who did his War of the Worlds sketch was put in jail.

Orson Welles and Howard Hughes: The other thread of the story is Clifford Irving's fake autobiography of Howard Hughes.  Irving was also de Hory's biographer.  Watch the Hughes press conference and it becomes clear that what he really wanted to do was make critically acclaimed movies.  Irony after irony: the greatest film director of his time couldn't make movies due to lack of money, while the richest man of his time really wanted to make great movies.  (Shame they couldn't have come to an agreement.)

Orson Welles and Oja Kojar and Elmyr de Hory and Paul (?): Both much (much) older men who found great love late in life with younger partners.  Oja in the excellent documentary _Orson Welles: One Man Band_ stills seems madly in love with him 10 years after his death, while Paul (forgive me, I'm not certain of his name) is still clearly in love with Elmyr after all these years.  His apartment is full of Elmyr artworks and just the way he talks about him makes his feelings clear. I note that there are some small-minded commentators on Oja Kodar.  It makes sense to me that she had a role in the film F for Fake.  She says that the girl watching sequence was her idea, and I don't see why not.  Clearly Welles had the hots for her, but given her discussion of how they (partly) spent their time, it was in imagining stories and creating sequential stories with each other.  Their partnership was creative as well as erotic and it makes sense that this dual experience would fuel both experiences.

Orson Welles and Picasso: Oja Kodar had a vision/ fantasy of meeting Picasso that Welles picked up for the final sequence, playing Picasso himself.  When I first watched this and the girl watching scene, both seemed to be exploiting Kodar's body, but now having watched the extras, I suspect that this was also Kodar's vision as well.  She wasn't neurotic about her body or her talents, which probably was part of her appeal to Welles.  So she didn't get the greatest living artist, only the greatest living director (who then brought her fantasy to life.)  Worse things could happen to a girl.  Also, I can't help but wondering if the 22 lost Picasso masterpieces aren't linked to Welles' own unfinished or lost projects.

Making movies/ making art: In one of the documentary sequences, Welles talks about making art, then backpedals to say making movies.  We see this also in the film, where there is an amazing sequence about Chartes where Welles is confronting his own mortality.  The end of it is very powerful.  He says so what if the song ends?  Go on singing.  Then he backs away for the more farcical Picasso piece at the end.

One last note: Welles is complaining about the critics and experts and their stupidity, and yet having read reviews of Citizen Kane on various sites recently (where people complain about it, saying they don't like it because it is in black and white and for other such ""reasons"") I can't help but think that the alternative is worse. But, even though this film is not as great as Citizen Kane (what is?), it is similar in that it is its own world.  Many other dualities and linkages could be found by cycling through the materials.  Happy hunting!",1297382400,3,4036,4.668555240793201
2219977,5,B0007M2234,"Not much to say about this film, treat it as part documentary on forgery/bootleg concepts and also as an exposition on fakery. A film about a documentary about deception.

Wells did not know that at the start of filming that Irving would forge a book about Hughes. We also get to see the events that caused Elmyr de Hory to commit suicide a few years later after he learned that France would no longer protect him from Spanish prosecutors. Certain people cannot be caged, and he choose to retain his freedom in the purest sense: death...but I digress. Also Wells takes his own stab at forgery with a small skit about Picasso and an old forger. So what is ""fake"" anyways? And what is its relationship to the world? This is what Wells wants the viewer to ponder. This is a must watch film for Wells fans and those interested in art and hooliganism. The highlight of the film is a wordless montage (filmed at different places and times) between De Hory and Irving about whether De Hory signed the bootlegs he painted, thereby making them ""authentic"" pieces (and legally engaging in fraud). This kind of editing is common place now but as usual Wells was ahead of his time.

Personally, I would like to find a film that is an antithesis to it, one about ownership and perhaps intellectual rights, creating an Aristotelian synthesis. But that's just me, every ying has a yang.",1239926400,3,1371,4.614754098360656
2219978,5,B0007M2234,"Orson Welles has a ball examining the nature of what is real and what is fake in the funny, bizarre F FOR FAKE.

If you think Micheal Moore is on target with his work, this one is older and still is a bullseye! This film is an essay that Welles lovingly shares with his film audience, just like Moore does today.

Four people stand at the center of this documentary: Elmyr de Hory, who some believe forged more than a thousand art masterpieces, many of which hang in some of the world's most famous museums; Clifford Irving, who is not only out to prove what a fake Elmyr is but also wrote a fake biography of Howard Hughes; Oja Kodar (who was also Welles's Girlfriend), who claims that Pablo Picasso painted 22 canvases of her that no one has ever seen; and Welles himself, who harks back to his days creating the havoc-causing THE WAR OF THE WORLDS.

The film master stroke is in the editing; from absurd stock footage to shots of Welles smirking into the camera from different locations to scenes with a monkey scurrying about, the film is vastly entertaining to watch.

 F FOR FAKE is an underrated, underappreciated work of comic genius about the nature of reality, celebrity, and art, by a master showman showing a surprisingly wicked sense of humor. Like a good magician, he makes us want more and more

Welles has been a maverick filmmaker and it shows. Listen to the commentary track on this film, you will see either Welles the genius filmmaker  or the madman...take your pick. I pick Genius and I am sticking to it!

2219979,4,B0007M2234,"One of the greatest pieces of charlatanry in Orson Welles' brilliant pseudo-documentary F For Fake, released in 1974, is the idea that Welles' lover and one time sculptress, Oja Kodar (ne Olga Palinkas), had any real hand in crafting the film; specifically in writing it alongside Welles. Don't get me wrong; I have nothing against the woman nor the claim, for the claim is in keeping with the whole tenor of the film, and when she was young, well, the lovely Ms. Kodar looked positively ferocious in a bikini. But if her film commentary is to be a standard for judging her intellect and artistic merit, well, bravo Ms. Kodar for pushing the film's use of deceit even further. After all, Welles has been dead for well over two decades, so he can no more debunk your insipid claims than, say, journeyman filmmaker Carol Reed can deny the manifest: that it was Welles, not himself- as a mere beard for the blacklisted Welles, who directed Welles' brilliant film, The Third Man, back in 1949.
  Of course, I have erred in even calling F For Fake a `pseudo-documentary'. In a sense, its closest cousin was the kitschy old 1970s television `documentary' series In Search Of....With Leonard Nimoy, wherein Star Trek's once and future Mr. Spock would explore the `scientific verities' of such things as the Bermuda Triangle, ghosts, and Judge Crater's disappearance. Welles' last finished and distributed film is really a filmic treatise on art and truth, and, given Welles' voluminous intellect and dazzling talent, it's a near-masterpiece, and very close to being the `new kind of film' that Welles claimed it was. Of course, its closest antecedent would not be in film but in the supposed `nonfiction' literary works of Truman Capote (In Cold Blood) and Marcel Proust (Remembrance Of Things Past).... F For Fake, though, is the genuine article- a terrific work of cinema by a master of the art form. It makes fools of the benighted critics who damned it when it opened, merely using it as a grindstone for their anti-Welles axes, and shows that Orson Welles was not a `failed' Hollywood director, but a brilliantly inventive and successful independent director, one whose final completed and edited work showed how the reality of the unreal was a growing force in modern life, and left it up to the viewer how to deal with that fact. The real surprise would have been had it been hailed as the herald it is, both as a work of cultural criticism and a work of art so far ahead of its day that even now, nearly four decades after it was conceived and begun, it still may be more aptly called a work of prophecy than documentary. Thus, it is one of the few films, or works of art, that I can recommend not only for its art, but for its cultural and sociological import. See it, think about it, and let it soak in. But don't be embarrassed if you find that you've soiled yourself in the morning dreaming of Ms. Kodar. After all, there is a very good reason Welles has her beauteous form in the film, and you know that you're only lying to yourself if you deny it. See what a mere work of art can really do?",1221091200,4,3098,4.620689655172414

The inextinguishable genius of Orson Welles is carved once more in relief through this admirable of two well known fakers , Elmyr and Irving. As it's well know, Elmyr was regarded the most astute, fine and intelligent artist of the falsification, his immense skills as painter allowed him to copy Modigliani, Matisse or the same Picasso, his reproductions were bought for many art dealers; on the other hand, Irving is closely linked with Howard Hughes.

Orson Welles acts as the master of ceremonies, his voice in off and some other important reflections about himself and so other issues.

The movie is deeply absorbing and engaging, but the rest of its charm runs for you; it would be a crime to tell you the rest of this original masterwork.",1206748800,2,961,4.883435582822086

When a person slowly disappears, nobody seems to notice. This is probably what happened to Orson Welles when his film career stumbled into a downhill slope. The man who was arguably the most brilliant filmmaker to emerge on the American scene, ended up doing narration, wine commercials, and magic shows. He died in poverty, leaving behind masterpieces, but also leaving behind dozens of unfinished films. Films that could have been just as magical as his earlier works. 'Orson Welles - The One Man Band"" takes a look at those struggling later years when Welles was a ghost hovering around the Hollywood movie scene. Many people knew he was trying to make movies, but many people also knew he could never get them finished. Because of his inability to finish films, no major studio would try to finance him, so he became a gypsy-like filmmaker. Even still then many projects were not finished.

Although it is sad to see a legend struggling so badly, the film does not feel sorry for him. In fact, the film has a very positive outlook on Welles later years. The film is narrator by two people. One is the filmmaker. The other is Welles' companion, Oja Kodar. She had spent a considerable time with Welles in his last years and knew him probably better than anyone else. The image she shows of Welles was not of a burned-out has-been, but of a strong man who still had plenty of creative spark. When watching the snippets and short clips from his unfinished films, one can see exactly what Oja Kodar was seeing. Either it was bad luck or it was his conflicts with studios that could not get his films finished. Or maybe it was both. Regardless, one can see even in his later films, Welles still had incredible film-making talent and vision. One can see that he was also a versatile actor. He could play a wide variety of roles and play them as good as the best actors. When we see how creative he still was, we cannot help but think it was the Hollywood that ruined his career. There could be a lot of truth to this because many people feel he was never the same after 'Citizen Kane' because Welles might have stepped on too many big toes after his brilliant debut feature. But the unknown remains just that. At times, it is the artist who ruins his or her career with their own bare hands.

It is hard to say what happened, but this film does not try to explain that either. It tries to focus on Welles the artist. And he was just that until his death. An artist who had no audience. How frustrating, but we have seen this example time and again throughout history.",1201305600,5,2752,4.4760956175298805

The only enjoyable thing about it is a few frames of Irving's calm and beautiful Swiss wife Edith(?).  On disc B there is a BBC documentary on Elmyr if you're interested in art and what you might be REALLY looking at in a respectable museum.  I recommended this to a friend but she fell asleep so many times watching the film that she never got to the documentary.  If you're a Welles aficionado maybe you would want it.

2219983,5,B0007M2234,"Most movies that I like are in the ""not for everyone"" category, and since this is one of my favorite films, that caveat is especially appropriate.

F for Fake is an intellectually challenging film that really requires its viewer to pay attention and follow multiple interweaved plots.  Actually, ""plot"" isn't the right word here: the film explores the theme of ""what is real?"" (as well as ""what is art?"") using several real-life examples: notorious art forger Elmyr, and author Cliff Irving (whose Howard Hughes ""autobiography"" hoax is legendary in literary circles.)  And let's not forget Welles himself pulled off one of the most notorious hoaxes of the 20th Century: the War of the Worlds broadcast.  If you enjoy seeing ""con artists"" at the top of their game, this is essential viewing.

Much of the movie was filmed ""on the fly"" as several simultaneous scandals shook the art and publishing world.  This can make it difficult to follow for viewers with short attention spans who are used to linear, well-defined plots.  Multiple viewings may be required to fully absorb all that is in this.

Although Welles is on-camera much of the time, the real star here was Welles off-camera in the editing room, where his genius really shines through when viewing the final product.  Students of cinematography will undoubtedly be awed by his masterful handling of the material.

The Criterion Collection lives up to its reputation of delivering a goldmine of extras.  The best of those offered here is almost certainly ""One Man Band,"" a compilation of various unfinished products Welles was working on in his final years.",1189555200,8,1616,5.01498127340824

It's a Mobius strip - it keeps turning back on itself so that its primary subject takes turns with secondary and tertiary characters and ultimately mirrors the film's own creator. It's a film about how the truth of art is often conveyed through lies, and vice versa.

Let me also say that the overheated editing from a variety of disparate elements and different film stocks preceded Oliver Stone's own brain-fever techniques in films like JFK, NATURAL BORN KILLERS, and NIXON by nearly twenty years. Just imagine what Welles would have produced if the circumstances of his project financing had not been so dire.

As ever, Criterion has produced a marvelous version of this ""only"" color film from Orson Welles (another reason to see this movie - every other Welles film was in black and white).

Welles even had the stones to include his mistress Oja Kodar as his co-star in his own piece of trickery as displayed in this fast paced masterpiece.

Some of the other reviewers here sound as if they could use some Ex-Lax. Chill out, will ya? This isn't supposed to be a profound statement. The old man's just having a little fun.

Having said this, I will immediately contradict myself by noting that the scene in which Welles ruminates on the longevity of art while contemplating Chartres Cathedral touched me deeply. In the context of his tattered career, and the ever-growing stature of his masterpiece CITIZEN KANE, it suggests that Welles at last attained some measure of peace with his life and achievements.

Having said that, I want to make clear that this is not a stuffy and slow artistic analysis of BIG ISSUES.  Welles pulls out all the stops to make it sexy and exciting -- he prepares us from the very beginning to see him as a cinematic magician, with a beautiful assistant, whose beauty (as in such magical acts) is used to distract the audience from the games he will play with truth and illusion.  An intriguing set of stories, well told, and beautifully shot, with the most masterful use of editing (for both sound and picture) techniques I've seen in any film (I understand that he and his crew were working almost exclusively on editing this film for over a year).

While this is a unique project in Orson Welles' career, the obsessions it plays with are there from the beginning.  It is not always noted that even in Citizen Kane, for example, the questions of reality and illusion are central.  That film began with what is effectively a newsreel documentary, setting off a series of reflections on the relation between documentary and truth, and the question of how best to get at the essence or meaning of a man's life.  F for Fake explicitly connects its own concerns with Howard Hughes with the fictional biography of Charles Foster Kane -- since (in part) it tells the true story of another fictional/fake biographer of Hughes, and even reveals that at one time Welles considered modelling Kane more closely on Hughes than on William Randolph Hearst.  In any case, this is an essential piece of Welles' work, and Criterion Pictures has done a wonderful job making it available in a such a good looking DVD.",1125532800,5,1758,4.648387096774194

2219993,4,B0007M2234,"Orson Welles' ""For for Fake"" can be at times a very confusing movie. But, if you find yourself confused, the problem is your thinking to hard. You're trying to make sense of a movie that simply doesn't want you to make sense of it. Think of the film as a magic act. You know you're being fooled, but you sit and watch anyways because you are being entertained. To think how the trick was done takes away from the mystery. And just like a magican Welles' doesn't want to reveal his secrets.

 ""F for Fake"" is supposedly about a famous art forger, Elmyr de Hory and the relationship between himself and a man named Clifford Irving. Right from the beginning Welles tells us we are going to watch a movie about lies and deception.

 At first the film, notice a called it a film not a documentary, plays off as real. We think we are seeing a movie that is examing how in fact is Elmyr de Hory. At admittedly it is very interesting. Welles comprises this material in a very effective way. Though all the while we are asking ourselves, just how much as this can we trust?

 The film zips through three main plot points. One dealing with de Hory another involving Howard Hughes,which leads us back to Clifford Irving, and then finally a segment about Welles himself and some of the tricks he has pulled off, namely his famous ""War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast.

 ""F for Fake"" I believe was the last film Welles directed, and while it may not be in the same league as his other works; ""Citizen Kane"", ""Touch of Evil"", or ""Chimes at Midnight"" it is still an enjoyable film. In some ways it is quite fitting that this would be his last film. He was a man who had to struggle to find a place in the Hollywood studio system to get his films made and here he has the last laugh.

 Bottom-line: Highly entertaining film about lies and deception. The movie has the ability to suck us into its story, and manages to fool us. Worthwhile for fans of Orson Welles.",1116547200,4,1946,4.365650969529086
2219994,5,B0007M2234,"Orson Welles's F For Fake is a great film, and it's surprising to me that it isn't more widely acclaimed.  A brilliant investigation into lying, manipulation, and the chicanery that forms the foundation of high culture, it reminds me of something Michael Moore might do if he were more concerned with metaphysics than politics, or Ross McElwee if he wore a cape and was outwardly self-obsessed.  Great stuff, especially for anyone jaded by the b.s. flowing from the art world.

My one complaint-a few too many shots of Kodar prancing around in high heels-Welles's work in those sections was like a twelve year old's idea of what sexually attractive looks like.

Brilliantly shot and edited, narrated with style and panache by Welles, and it has substance to back up the style.

Criterion added some good extras.  The unreleased trailer for F For Fake might be even better than the movie itself--it makes promises God himself couldn't keep.  The documentary on Welles's late period of unfinished work is enjoyable, but by no means a revelation.  The clips that are shown are intriguing, but a more penetrating and honest analysis of his later years by someone more removed from the subject would have been preferable to Kodar's well-intentioned puff piece.  The swinging london skit shown in the film is hilarious.

The documentary on De Hory is okay, a bit dry, and has a bit of a smell of ""expert"" posturing about it.  The 60 minutes interview with Clifford Irving is strange.  The man reveals nothing that rings sincerely.  Based on it, Irving comes off to me as the most dangerous and desperate man involved in the proceedings.  There doesn't seem to be anything there beyond an enthusiasm for finding an angle and playing it successfully.

8048842,5,B0007M2234,"If you are looking for a film that will teach you everything you need to know about editing, just use this film as your example.  Orson Welles made this film a masterpiece of cinema, not necessarily for the tale it tells, but for the way it tells it.  Always the pioneer, Orson Welles used the cutting room as the place to generate the magic in this film.
Everything about this film is the timing, and it's done perfectly.",1488499200,2,422,4.397435897435898
8048843,5,B0007M2234,"This is one of the most illuminating and fascinating documentaries ever made, and aside from CITIZEN KANE remains, in my view at least, the perfect example of Welles' genius. Haunting, hilarious, dark and wonderful, like falling down a rabbit hole full of rascals, confusion, deception and questions of the ultimate meaning of life, truth and art, this is a film everyone should see and be fooled by.",1482710400,,400,4.985074626865671
8048844,5,B0007M2234,"Orson Welles's ""F for Fake"" has languished ever since its release and remains unappreciated by the most heterogeneous audience.  This singular film is surprisingly unknown to the general public and vastly underrated by the less profane.  The ostensibly learned, speak with both irritation and envy about its spirited self-indulgence, while the less demanding viewer is vexed by its vertiginous, almost pushy cutting.  The result disorientation, which recalls Altman's experiments with simultaneous dialogueparoxistically driven in ""California Split""is closely controlled by Welles's  interplay of short and long, fast and slow, dense and tenuous.
""F for Fake"" is an essay on representation.  In it, Welles manages to gloss that ineffable as much as fundamental aspect of fraud in art.  By drawing upon his career and that of an art forger and his hoax biographer, Welles actually spelled out 'representation's double flip', where, in a hurling of the senses, the artist mimics the very act of making art.  The 'metaphor of the metaphor' is at once breathtaking and terrifying as it reveals the precarious foundations by exposing the jocular element of authorship even in highly dramatic art.  For those less inclined to intellectualize, Welles also provides a visual distillation of his unmistakable style; the film comes with its own wine-spills, gargantuan meals, facetious remarks, and flamboyant juxtapositions.  ""F for Fake"" is a clamorous film, a tragedian's grandiose gesticulation dangerously exposing the pantomime in art: it is a razor's edge which is fatal to all but few artists.  Orson Welles was one of the latter.",1469664000,2,1628,5.476

8048850,5,B0007M2234,"This film/documentary/cinema slight-of-hand is an interesting piece from Orson Welles during his  period of ""European Exile"". Hollywood be damned!  Auteur, Magician, Director, Interviewer and Narrator, FAKE has an certain Cinema Ve'rite' quality running throughout!. The subject matter regarding the Irving's and Elmyr is intriguing, but in other places the subject matter falls short, is silly, and possibly should have been edited out. But who am I to tell Orson what to do!  This film is an interesting Welles ""Experiment"". I enjoyed the film for the chances it takes with the viewer, the fondness I have for Welles, and for its subject matter. I also have a personal connection to this film: my old friend and college roommate was Clifford Irvings' son, who told me many stories about the legendary Elmyr de Hory, the Hughes hoax, and his Father!. I also had the rare opportunity to meet Clifford when he visited his Son. Fond memories!

The ""Mockumentary"" as it were, is an interesting mix of the real life drama and criminal endeavors Clifford and his wife experienced, resulting from the Howard Hughes biography hoax, which  they planned and executed to defraud their publisher. There is also the relationship between Elmyr ""The Worlds Greatest Art Forger"", and Irving his biographer, friend, neighbor, frequent party guest, and possible collaborator??? I can't really say. You will find it interesting how the lines between illusion and reality are blurred here, which is what Welles intended by virtue of the style, editing, and subject matter. F For Fake is an interesting piece taken on the whole and fascinating in some of it's detail!",1434672000,4,1647,5.153558052434457
