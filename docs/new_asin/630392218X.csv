724925,5,630392218X,This movie is a comedy jewel. Tony Curtis and his best and a hilarious George C. Scott. A lost treasure.,1285113600,2,104,4.25
724926,5,630392218X,"One of Tony Curtis' better comedies. Supported beautifully by George C Scott & Virna Lisi
Classic comedy of the period. Probably looks dated but that is a major part of the appeal
Definitely worth seeing",1265500800,7,203,4.828571428571428
724927,1,630392218X,"unfortunately I had to re-order this movie twice. The first one got to me all broken up,I wasn't too happy about that. I re-ordered from another site on amazon and the service was great. The movie is in good condition and I enjoyed it very much. I love those older flicks. Thanks, Sharon M.",1200700800,,290,4.388888888888889
724928,5,630392218X,"I was only 12 years old when I first saw this movie in the theater, but yet it is one of the most memorable comedies from that era for me. It's about these two carousing super competitive Air Force pilots who go to any lengths to outdo one another when it comes to women and they have extremely jealous natures.

  After a brawl in a bar, instigated by George C. Scott, Tony Curtis winds up in the hospital and his nurse is guess who? Virna Lisi!  Yea, that can happen; obviously, Curtis does not want his friend to know anything about the nurse.  For those not old enough to know, Virna Lisi was an astounding sex symbol of that time and it was virtually impossible to take your eyes off of her in any scene she appeared, even at the tender age of 12. She had recently been in the Jack Lemmon movie, ""How To Murder Your WIfe"" and is surprisingly good in this movie. She has one of the best lines when at a cocktail party, she is dancing with Tony Curtis and is irritated with him because he has been paying too much attention to his job and not to her ... she asks him to bring back a corkscrew from Copenhagen, and when he refuses, she says ""just one little corkscrew: you can stick it anywhere!"" I still remember the audience at that time rolling in the aisles.  That was some line in the 60's!

  There is also a wildly funny airplane hijacking of an arab jet so Tony Curtis can get back and save his marriage.  Also, after he gets back, a hysterical fight scene with George C. Scott (who I thought was excellent for his role), where Carroll O'Connor, the Air Force General, is in the next room pounding on the walls for quiet.

  I thought the direction for this movie was really crisp because timing is crucial for some of the slapstick.  There are other memorable scenes, but why go on and on?  I anxiously await this film coming onto DVD widescreen. If you like these kind of light comedies of this time period, this is a must have for one's collection.",1163203200,10,1961,4.290760869565218
724929,5,630392218X,"Maybe it's just me. But I'm so happy that she thought he was dead! That way he can be all mine! Wouldn't that be luscious? Delicious? Dreamy!!! Silly girl, don't you know that Tony just doesn't want anything to do with you? Instead, he's going to be all mine!",1149552000,3,259,4.3061224489795915

7854871,5,630392218X,"I think most movies with Tony Curtis are good.  It was funny, entertaining and worth the time.  I would recommend it to all.",1400284800,,124,4.3478260869565215
7854872,1,630392218X,Basically a waste of time.  Another 60's romp with no where to go and not much humor or sex-appeal.  Forget about it.,1391904000,,117,4.2727272727272725
7854873,4,630392218X,Tony Curtis was very funny as well as the supporting cast. The video bought back some good memories...and yes I would recommend this product.,1380672000,2,141,4.916666666666667
7854874,4,630392218X,"I was stationed at March AFB, where the beginning part of this was filmed, and watched some of the filming. I would have rated it higher, but was unable to see my former Air Force buddies, as i did when we viewed it at the March AFB theater. I was a bit disappointed. The movie itself, though was quite good and funny.",1376697600,,318,4.145161290322581
7854875,3,630392218X,"I watched it and it was OK but not memorable beyond the Thunderbird flight segment.  George C. Scott as Tank was good, the girl was beautiful and Tony Curtis was ok.  Not a great story but watchable.
