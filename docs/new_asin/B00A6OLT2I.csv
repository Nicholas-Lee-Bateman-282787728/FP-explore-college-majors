5384587,4,B00A6OLT2I,"I got this when I got my first 3D tv and I am very happy with the dvd
It has more then enough 3D to show what your TV can do and the kids love to watch the fish
This is not something your going to watch over and over but when someone comes over and wants a quick demo of the 3DTV this is what I put in",1403395200,,301,3.3768115942028984
5384588,1,B00A6OLT2I,"The main problem with this DVD is light. Or lack of it. Both artificial and natural daylight.

This is either because it was shot on dull days, where the natural light has not penetrated deep enough to show the reef colours, or the artificial light is not good enough.
I suspect both.

In some scenes it is obvious that the only artificial light is a separately hand held underwater torch.....which bounces around all over the place. It simply isn't wide angled anough to light the subject and surrounds.

The overall effect is an underlit, very blue reef. The whole point of diving a coral reef is to see the fantastic colours. You just don't get that here. Add to that some dreadful over exposure and I was left thinking I was watching an amateur's holiday video.

Totally unprofessional camera work just adds to the impression that this is a very poor quality professional film.
There is no close up photography at all.

I was going to give this 2*, but changed my mind when I saw that the 5* review here was simply advertising by the filmaker. They have an identical review on another of their underwater DVDs.

This is completely dishonest - and probably illegal by Amazon's terms & conditions, so it gets a 1*.

I have two other rented 3D DVDs that are way better than this, Amazing Ocean & Imax Deep Sea. I haven't decided which one of those I prefer, but I really wouldn't recommend Fascination Coral Reef to anyone. Amazing Ocean is good and I will review them once I've had a chance to revisit both.",1371600000,5,1509,4.546125461254612
5384589,2,B00A6OLT2I,"This has some  3d effects, but no actions. It looks like somebody went underwater, shot something and made a documentary based on what they have captured.  Thay say many things, but not showing that like in Imax deep sea.",1360800000,3,221,4.641025641025641

The 3D Pop Outs are absolut georgues.

5384591,1,B00A6OLT2I,"I bought this with high hopes. I couldn't find any reviews for it. I am a huge fan of 3D documentaries. After watching documentaries such as Under the Sea and Deep Sea, you have a certain expectation. As far as content, I don't expect anything different. A coral reef is a coral reef.

The Good:
-The only thing positive is there is a lot of pop out at certain places. However, the depth is of the backgroud is not there. It seems very flat with the fishing floating. The good isn't that great.

The Bad:
-This appears to have been made for a college class. The quality of the camera and pictures is par at best.
-The music is absolutely horrible. It is techno at times.
-Was this the first time for the camera man being underwater? There are scenes where it looks like something I would do filming my son's birthday party. My son is in the picture, he is almost out. You see the turtle, you see a tiny piece of the turtle as the camera moves up and down or side to side.
-The camera stays on uninteresting scenes for a long time. There are fish swimming. You watch them swim. No narration. The pictures is not good.

I don't think the makers of this cared about the quality, but pushing out a product.

Bottom line, do not waste your money. I wouldn't purchase it again, even if it was $5. If a family member leaves it to you in their estate, maybe watch it for some of the pop out early. That is probably it.",1356998400,16,1410,4.230483271375465

8547063,5,B00A6OLT2I,"Beautiful and relaxing. Nice background movies while you're working on little tasks. We bought this set after seeing something similar on our smart tv. We are very happy with our purchase. It's so calming and you get to see things you wouldn't get to unless you were a deep sea diver. The photography is out of this world. If you like watching nature shows, you will love this.",1455580800,2,377,4.5588235294117645
8547064,1,B00A6OLT2I,"Not very happy with the 3D quality of the movies, they were not as good as similar movies I own. Overall I was very disappointed with all three. One of them I don't remember which as they all seemed to have a lot of the same footage repeated over and over wasn't even in 3D to me, no depth at all. The narrator was very monotone for all three and we even had to stop watching and switch to another ocean 3D movies because we were all bored. To try and give them a fair shake I did watch all three but the IMAX 3D ocean and sea life movies are FAR superior. If I hadn't opened this I would be sending this set back to Amazon as a return, but unfortunately I did not know how horrible they were until it was opened",1455494400,2,712,3.951388888888889

8547066,4,B00A6OLT2I,"This is a boxed 3 Blu-ray set. First one Fascination Coral Reef had some pixel and quality issues. Other 2 turned out to be decent quality. It is not the BBC or Cousteau quality but still underwater quality is quite good There are lots of new things you will see here. All are shot in Maldives, Indian Ocean. That itself will make it interesting. For the price, 3 Blu-ray DVDs are a bargain. There are some funny English translation from the original German.",1430611200,,458,4.530120481927711
8547067,1,B00A6OLT2I,"If each disk weren't the same with a few exceptions then the series might be interesting.  If you have seen any Coral Reef presentations prior to viewing the set of 3 you may just find yourself as disappointed as I was.  After watching the 1st of 3 I thought, ""maybe the next presentation would be somewhat exciting,"" but to my disappointment the 2nd and 3rd presentations were all the same with the exception being a sporadic new fish addition.  I was at least hoping to see some type of behaviour to match the audio discussing feeding behaviour, but to my surprise there were no live action feedings and only from what appeared to be pre-planned feeding when a dead fish was placed on the Coral floor, waiting for an Eel or other fish to start nibbling.  For myself, not even the reasonable price justified the purchase.  My best recommendation is to stick to the proven high quality and content such as seen when viewing David Attenborough and similar class presentations.  If this is your first experience watching anything Coral Reef because you have lived your life miles and miles away from any Oceans, then this set is an excellent introductory to life associated with Coral Reefs; or I should say, ""with only one particular reef location.""  From what I know and from what I have seen in my 60 plus years on planet Earth, all three 3D presentations were filmed on location and the same location throughout.  Exercise prudence prior to purchasing.  An excellent introductory to aquatic life for the novice and for someone who has never seen ""anything"" under the Oceans.",1428883200,4,1576,4.764705882352941
