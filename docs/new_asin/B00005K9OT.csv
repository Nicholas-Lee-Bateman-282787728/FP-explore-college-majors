7943132,4,B00005K9OT,"The highlight for me of this DVD was the Rossini Inflammatus from Stabat Mater. You can also find it on You Tube if you want to sample it. Steber had a lyric-spinto voice at midcareer. She had a large repertoire but was particularly well respected for her Mozart and Strauss. This DVD reflects the wide range of her repertoire including her Elsa from Wagner's Lohengrin, Verdi's Desdemona and Traviata, and several Puccini roles. I would recommend this DVD to Steber fans only. She was a wonderful soprano who should be remembered. The DVD is is a nice document of her work on Firestone TV broadcasts. However, she is best heard on commercial recordings and historical Met broadcasts.",1414195200,,684,4.854700854700854
7943133,5,B00005K9OT,"Eleanor Steber is one of the very great sopranos in operatic history, and despite her fame, was nevertheless underrated.  (If she had hired Edgar Vincent, she would have ruled the world!)  Her repertoire is astonishing: from Wagner to Mozart, and Verdi and Puccini to boot, all accomplished with vocal perfection. This DVD gives us several staged arias from the Voice of Firestone TV show and they are well worth owning.  Her attacks and tonality remind one of what was said about Melba (by Shaw?), that one doesn't realize how most singers are not truly on key until they hear Melba, in this case Steber.  Her attacks are consistently perfect, indeed awe-inspiring. She opens her mouth and the sound is perfectly THERE.  Despite the size of the voice, her coloratura is excellent, as is her legato. There are even impressive trills. She is also dramatically convincing, and a beautiful woman to boot, with a commanding presence and charisma galore.  If one has any quibbles at all, it is that the beautiful voice does not vary much in color, altho it must be said that she can produce a pianissimo very beautifully.
Any lover of great singing will want to own this important document of a great singer and great singing.",1376524800,6,1221,4.818181818181818
7943134,5,B00005K9OT,"Eleanor Steber had a long, international career.  She was the 'Violetta' in the first opera I attended (in Detroit)  I remember hearing her as 'Minnie' in 'Fanciulla del West' in Monaco.  By that, you can see she had a wide repertoire but she wasn't always comfortable in some of the roles.

This tape is a collection from television of various performances.  The outstanding segments are the Mozart arias.  Highly recommended for all fans of American singers of the past.",1253664000,,472,4.9113924050632916
