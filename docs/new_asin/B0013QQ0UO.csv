8252626,1,B0013QQ0UO,"Not at all what I was expecting. I needed a basic training method and this is advanced. Besides the fact Wolters looks like Einstein, he speaks like him too. This is not recommended for the novice.",1402963200,,197,4.5
8252627,4,B0013QQ0UO,"This DVD provides lots of good ideas on how to train a hunting dog. The basics of Sit, Come, and Stay apply to all dogs but the training extras for hunting dogs is well worth the price.",1397001600,,185,4.027027027027027
8252628,5,B0013QQ0UO,Richard A Wolters is the best at what he does.... He speaks on layman's terms to where anyone can understand him and then be able to follow through with his instructions... I have learned everything that I have learned about training through reading all of his books plus some more but he is by far the best when it comes to training Retreivers.,1390176000,,345,4.492063492063492
8252629,5,B0013QQ0UO,We have not watched this video yet but are currently enjoying Wolters' books and look forward to seeing his ideas in action to give us a better mental picture of what we're striving for with the pup we'll be getting in the spring.,1323734400,,230,4.372093023255814
8252630,4,B0013QQ0UO,A little dated obviously but features one of the best trainers of all time.  Definitely worth reviewing if you are trying to train your dog yourself.,1323129600,2,149,4.730769230769231
8252631,5,B0013QQ0UO,"It has been a long time since I trained a dog, and do not consdier myself an expert by any means so I purchased the book Gun Dog. I read the book and then purchased the video tape Gun Dog. The training instructions and rationale for them were clear and make sense. I am training my dog now. The tape provides some visual re-enforcement for the new trainer and also shows you exactly what these dogs are capable of achieving. The author gives me a game plan I can have confidence in pursuing the get the result I am looking for with my dog.

It is important to note that Wolter's goals here are to give you:
1.) An excellent well behaved companion-family dog.
2.) A dog the can hunt (upland&waterfowl)and retrieve reliably every time.

He differentiates this from dog owners who want to own field trial dogs.

I would recommend Gun Dog...the book and video tape.
