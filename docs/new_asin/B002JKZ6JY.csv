Did not know there were so many euro spy movies from the 60's like James Bond type that are fun to watch with the beautiful actresses and all the spy spoof that goes along with it. I also now collect these movies from the 60's because they just don't make movies the way they used to. However, I think that some of them may be a little bit over priced given that some of them are so old.",1409270400,,408,3.9878048780487805
