Increasingly hard to find, get it while you can. Original packaging sold as ""One Long Night"". Amazon has this too. Must for any hardcore BOC fan.",1475625600,,314,4.7272727272727275
8400018,4,B003M2RCX6,"I bought this today at Half Price Books in Kansas City, for $4.99. It was brand new, still sealed. While the cover has the title Blue Oyster Cult: Live in Chicago, when the DVD starts it says ""A Long Days Night"" across the bottom of the screen. So yes, this is the same show. I don't own the other one, so I can't compare. However, the picture on this one is sharp, the colors crisp and the sound well balanced. Lanier's keyboards are a little weak in the mix, but I've only watched it on the TV in my bedroom. I'll have to take it downstairs and try it on the surround system for a full review on the sound. There are no extras at all, just track selection and choice of audio setup. Great setlist, covering their entire career. Bloom's voice is a little rough, but light-years better than when I saw BOC a few years ago. Worth every bit of the $4.99 I paid, but I wouldn't pay what sellers here are asking ($16-$27). Buy ""A Long Day's Night"" instead, it appears to be cheaper. Nice to finally have a decent quality BOC show on DVD!",1363392000,3,1033,4.222222222222222
8400019,5,B003M2RCX6,"This is very disapointing! Your DVD is sold under the name of "" Live in Chicargo"" - It is just the ""a Long Days Night"" DVD renamed to suck in the consumer to purchase more. Very decietful!
Deliberate deception!!!!!
""a Long Days Night"" is a fantastic Live BOC DVD, but I don't need to buy it again deciefully renamed.",1281657600,24,316,4.372881355932203
