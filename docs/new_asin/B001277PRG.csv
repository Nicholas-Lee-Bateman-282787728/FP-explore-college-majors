8244602,4,B001277PRG,"What can you say? The Corsair is easily as iconic as the Mustang, and just as recognized today following the publicity it received from the television series, ""Black Sheep Squadron."" The entire Roaring Glory series is one of great value, but it came up just short of being fantastic. Viewers can scarcely adjust to the sounds of the aircraft before being interrupted by the narrators voice. While the details and specifications of the aircraft should be presented, and are, it is for the sounds and sights viewers buy items like this. Still, it is good we at least have this, because even these last remaining aircraft will not last forever.",1393372800,,641,4.836363636363636
