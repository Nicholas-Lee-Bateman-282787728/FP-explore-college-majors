7926862,5,B00004Y7EI,I have a VHS copy of this for years.  It was time for a tech upgrade; If anyone is looking for diverse action Chinese/Korean MA this might meet your needs. Also my DVD came on time and in good condition.,1407542400,2,203,4.075
7926863,4,B00004Y7EI,"Tan Tao Liang - no wonder he's nicknamed Flash Legs. Jeez, this guy can hold a leg up in the air and kick repeatedly, without putting it down, just like a boxer uses his jab. Really, you just have to see this guy. The other guys are okay, but this is Tan's movie. The choreography isn't bad, there's no ridiculous Chinese humor, and the dubbing works - what more could you want? Okay, by today's standards, there's no spectacular flying kicks (or flying at all - no wires), the fights are slower paced, and the villain is drawn so over the top he's quite laughable, but if your thing's kicking martial arts, this is a movie that'll have you hitting your pause and replay buttons.",1177804800,3,679,4.44
7926864,4,B00004Y7EI,"To give this flick anything less than 4 stars,,,that would only make me another follower,,,which apparently is the trend on Amazon.  If the first guy (reviewer) started off with 2 or 3 stars,,,others tend to follow that trend,,,,,,,,,,,,NOT ME,,,,I WRITE IT AS I SEE IT PERIOD,,cuz I know my old school kung fu!!

This flick has a great plot, amazing fights scenes and the dvd transfer chrystal.  Having said that to give this flick anything less than 4 stars would be a gross dis-service.  Tan tao Liang performed brilliantly in this,,,,trust me,,take a chance and check it out,,,you will walk away nothing less than satisfied!!  You could put that in your pipe and smoke it!!!",1149897600,2,678,4.860869565217391
7926865,2,B00004Y7EI,"Well this movie was ok... No where near a classic to me. I recommend ""Challenge of Death""; it was a better movie then this one.",1141689600,,127,4.12
7926866,3,B00004Y7EI,"This was an okay Kung Fu flick.  Some of the fighting scenes kind of lame and predictable!  Plot was also predictable right up to the end.  Acting not bad - seen better in other Kung Fu films. DVD crossover could have been a bit better though. I can't stand that ""Ocean Shores"" name and logo that seem to pop up in the middle of the screen and stays there until you begin to get sick of looking at it.

The villan, Tommy Lee (I think this is his name), looked like total CRAP! This bum just comes out of nowhere. That old drunk in Drunken Master looked better than he did and he was paid to look drunk!!!!!! What was Tommy's excuse? Yea, what's up with the white ghost face overdone makeup?  He looked like uneven chalk marks was smacked across his face.  Also, what's up with that fake echo projected voice?  His overdubs totally SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!! That, in my opinion made him look and sound more like a real idiot than a true villan.  This flick could have went on normally without him having the fake limp added to his already shabby appearance  - his limp did not show up at all while he was fighting.  What was the limp all about anyway? And that hump in his back? Come on! Seriously guys, I can deal with the jumping off and onto three-story rooftops and some of the bad wig jobs, but overall, I'm happy that the ghostface killer in ""Ninja Checkmate"" didn't look like this bum!

This is no where near a 5 star-rated film and giving it a 3 perhaps might be too generous.  Not surely in my top 5% either.

The Kung Fu captain had pretty good kicking abilities.  It was this that forced me to give this film a 3.",1125187200,,1615,4.269736842105263
7926867,3,B00004Y7EI,"Yes, it's Asian martial arts action with a touch of the Old West (American spaghetti westerns) when the gang from The Hot, the Cool, and the Vicious get together.  I'm not sure who was hot, who was cool, and who was vicious, but this is by no means a bad film.  It actually manages to follow two converging storylines without making a confusing mess of things, and the true motivations of a couple of characters are hard to judge for the film's first hour or so.  I wasn't overly impressed with much of the kung fu action, I'll admit; there's a great emphasis on kicking (and, at least in the case of martial arts fighting, I'm not a legs man), and I felt that all of the early fights seemed a little too choreographed - the moves are all there, but the intensity is lacking.  The action is taken up another notch in the concluding fight sequences, but by then I was facing an even bigger problem with the film.
Things were going along quite well, and then a character named Mr. Lung (Tommy Lee) showed up out of nowhere.  I don't care how good a fighter he is, the man looks quite ridiculous, sporting blonde hair and a face covered with enough white makeup to last a geisha girl for a whole month.  To make things worse, he possesses unnatural skills (suddenly pulling a well-made rug of reality right out from under the story), and his voice, at least in the dubbed version, is given a wicked little echo that was probably supposed to impress me - it didn't impress me at all because it sounded ridiculous.  Then there is the fact that the guy hobbles around with a noticeable limp, but when he starts fighting he's Jack B. Nimble.  Mr. Lung pretty much ruined this movie for me.
What about the spaghetti western aspects of the film, you ask?  They are certainly not all-pervasive, but they are there.  You start out in a saloon-type establishment, featuring special ""entertainment,"" complete with a sassy little woman running the place.  When the town's chief of security first appears, you see his feet stop just before he throws open the doors of the bar and comes in - very much in the mold of the standard Western good guy entrance.  Naturally, you have your barroom brawl thrown into the mix, the introduction of some horses to the action, and a few other little things - just enough to be interesting, really.
I consider The Hot, the Cool, and the Vicious an average martial arts film; it could have been better, but it also could have been much, much worse.  One thing is for sure: this isn't your average 1970s martial arts film.",1082937600,2,2541,4.497826086956522
7926868,3,B00004Y7EI,"THE HOT, THE COOL AND THE VICIOUS (1976) has a much more complicated plotline than the average kung fu movie and boasts some intriguing touches not often found in the genre. Packed with incident, it's a skillful blend of police drama and western as it focuses on a small town security chief (and Northern Leg expert) and his efforts to arrest the son of the town boss, all while keeping an eye on a notorious killer (and Southern Fist fighter) who's arrived in town on a mystery mission. Eventually the town boss's partner in crime, the albino Mr. Lung, returns for the inevitable showdown.
Captain Lu, the Northern Leg expert, is played by Tan Tao Liang. The Southern Fist fighter is played by Wong Tao. After initial antagonism, the two team up to combat town boss Yuen (George Wang) and the blond-tressed Mr. Lung (played by the film's fight choreographer Tommy Lee). Also in the cast are three striking actresses, one of whom (Sun Chia Lin) plays a woman seeking revenge on Captain Lu and attacks him with weapons at various points.
The film's dizzying narrative is interspersed with fast and frequent kung fu bouts, one of which takes place in a deserted ghost town. Tan demonstrates his amazing leg power with satisfying regularity. Wong Tao fights well but also has dark matinee idol looks, sort of in the mold of Hollywood golden era swashbuckling star Tyrone Power. His character is something of a womanizer, a rare quirk for a kung fu hero. The film's stars and director (Lee Tso Nam) reunited for the similarly styled CHALLENGE OF DEATH (1978).",1006646400,4,1555,4.762962962962963
7926869,5,B00004Y7EI,"This movie probably has the best plot i've seen for a old school
kung fu movie. There is a great opening fight scene and there is just enough fights in the movie and the main villian tommy lee is cool as mutha and his voice is just scary. Don't listen to any bad reviews just buy it you will be thanking me, at a price of 15 dollars you can't go wrong this. Needs to be in every kung fu fans libary. The only complaint is it could have had a little more fighting in it but thats just nitpicking so get it now.",1000944000,2,509,3.9038461538461537
