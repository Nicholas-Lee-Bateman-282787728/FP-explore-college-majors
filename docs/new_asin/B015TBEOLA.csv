7452087,5,B015TBEOLA,"Very good.  I had never put some of these facts together.  As an aside, if you look on utube for Don Francisco's I Believe in You, you can hear a lovely song about Joseph.",1460851200,,171,4.0
7452088,5,B015TBEOLA,We really enjoyed this by Dr. Paul Maler. We have been reading through the bible and this film helped give us some additional insights to look into. I would suggest this to anyone. Not complicated and interesting.,1459296000,,213,4.783783783783784
7452089,5,B015TBEOLA,Very informative movie I always LOVE to learn new thing & learned more things about Herod. Also really didn't have uch of an insite on Joseph as I have now. If u like to obtain more knowledge then I suggest u watch this movie,1459123200,,225,4.136363636363637
7452090,4,B015TBEOLA,"It is interesting that there is not much talk about Joseph in the bible despite him being the father of Jesus. This documentary sheds light on Joseph's humbleness and faithfulness. Joseph was a good man for loving Mary and not making a mess when he found out that Mary was pregnant. He listened and obeyed God. He did not show panic or remorse. He was whole in God. He also worked hard for the family. He never boasted that he was the father of Jesus. In sum, Joseph shows the characters of good Christian as a father.",1459123200,,518,4.350515463917525
7452091,3,B015TBEOLA,Nothing new here if you read the Bible,1458000000,,38,3.875
7452092,4,B015TBEOLA,"i had some good insights about Lord Jesus, while watching this narrated ""documentary"" about some likely aspects of their home life and His upbringing, with historical background and pertinent factoids etc.. It isn't a slick production but it was a good thing to listen to while i was working on a craft at home.",1452902400,,311,4.777777777777778
7452093,4,B015TBEOLA,"Nice.  Joseph tends to fade into the background as more salient figures (Jesus, Mary, etc.) are studied, but this video highlights the important role Joseph played.",1475107200,,164,5.3076923076923075

7452100,5,B015TBEOLA,Very complete and informative about Joseph. The history and culture are included in the whys of the interpretations and history of Joseph's life. Includes alternate interpretations versus sticking to just one. Acknowledges the uncertainty due to lack of complete information.,1466899200,,275,5.9
7452101,5,B015TBEOLA,Excellent.,1463961600,,10,10.0
7452102,3,B015TBEOLA,"This program brought up interesting points and everything came from the Bible.  There was historical and scientific data given which enhanced the program.  Well done.  It is amazing that, although the New  Testament tells us to be followers of Jesus and also followers of His disciples/apostles, we do not follow His and His followers' example of keeping the Sabbath and the Holy Days.  Furthermore, the Jewish peoples of the time did not keep ""Christmas.""  This was not the first ""Christmas,"" as the festival had been celebrated by the pagan for thousands of years.",1463788800,,566,5.032258064516129
8734583,5,B015TBEOLA,I feel like we do not know a whole lot about Joseph the father of Jesus.  This film gives us a view into what his life may have been like.,1507766400,,138,3.6
8734584,5,B015TBEOLA,This was a beautiful and thought provoking documentary on Joseph the humble man who was Jesus' stepfather. I always loved Joseph after watching the Nativity Story movie but now I truly see him as a great example of how a man can lead and father his home in God.,1505001600,,261,4.346938775510204
8734585,5,B015TBEOLA,"My son and I have been watching some of the other superhero shows out there and although some are good, some are definitely NOT good! So I started think who are some really good 'superheros' that my son can look up to. Joseph, Jesus' step-father came to mind. So my 11-year-old son and I watched this in two installments.

I was highly impressed with both the delivery and the thoroughness of the content shared in this show. The commentators do an excellent job of explaining facts and opinions about the events that surround Joseph's life. If the commentators have a strong opinion about how a particular event took place they explain why they hold that belief, but they also share other ways ways that the events could have unfolded. And in some cases they acknowledge that we may never know for certain what truly happened. Keep in mind that the speakers hold the view that the Bible is 100% accurate, so events shared in the Scriptures are the 'facts' whereas the 'opinions' are in what was the 'inn' that was so full, what was the 'star of Bethlehem', and what did Joseph do in Egypt.

My son's take away was that Jesus had at least 4 brothers and two sisters. Quite the quiver full! My take away is that even though the Scriptures don't even record Joseph's death, Joseph is, truly, an unsung hero. And as stated at the end, '...most of us will be unsung heroes as well. Only our families and Lord will know what the powerful impact of our quiet leadership, our noble character and our faithful actions will have on our families and on the people around us.'",1499299200,,1565,4.546099290780142
