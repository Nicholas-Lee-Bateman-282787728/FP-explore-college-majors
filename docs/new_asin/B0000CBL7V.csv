Wish I could have given it less. Kenwood is NOT a teacher in any remote sense of the word, and has no intention of teaching you anything. He says ""you learn by doing"". Wish they had been honest and warned me that watching a video wouldn't tell me anything.
If you're a VERY advanced drummer, you might be entertained by watching a series of drum solos. Otherwise you'll have no idea what's going on here, or what anyone on this video is talking about. The advertising promises for this video, which are also printed on the cover are pure lies. This video should be titled ""How to use your big name to sell worthless ""instruction"" videos"". I could go on but I can't say enough bad things about this one.",1191110400,,876,4.315151515151515
