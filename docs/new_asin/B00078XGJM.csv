All three friends work together to train him how to ride. Next, Max falls in love with a lady who writes newspapers. Her name is Debrah. She doesn't like horses so the saddle club works together to help Max be a gentelman. The last story is how there is a cowboy camp, and they find a horse and the think that it is cursed. Stevie tries to keep the horse. Will she? This is a recommended movie for everyone.",1132444800,10,580,4.2342342342342345
2205298,5,B00078XGJM,My girls love all of these movies.  This one captured their attention once again.  They love to watch these over and over again.  My 9 year old is herself horse crazy and this movie did not disappoint.,1120608000,3,201,4.378378378378378
2205299,4,B00078XGJM,"Saddle Club fans will enjoy this movie! It is four series 1 episodes put together. It was a great movie, but do not try to compare it to the books! The first part with Skye Ransom coming to the stables and filming was cool and a really funny.  It was one of the best. The second part was all about Max (stable owner) and Deborah dating and the Saddle Club (three 12 year old girls) setting it up and trying to split them apart, it was cute.  The third part was TSC trying to teach Veronica (the stuck up rich girl) a lesson about taking care of her horse, it was good but not very adventureous or exciting.  The last part of the movie was great with John Brightstar and the western clinic.  It was very cheesy and John is portrayed as such a geek, but that made it humorous.  This was a great section of the movie and it included Stevie finding her horse Belle. The only thing about this movie compared to the others it's a lot about falling in love, making it more boring to younger viewers. Overall, it was a great movie and the behind the scenes bonus feature was cool!",1112400000,8,1072,4.209756097560976

2205304,3,B00078XGJM,I bought this as a gift for my sister who LOVES the Saddle Club. She loved it and for some reason the movie sucked me in too. I mean it's kind of an interesting show to begin with and what girl didn't dream of owning her own pony when she was little? The acting is not the most awesome but then again it's a kid's show:),1271635200,,320,3.8636363636363638

2205306,5,B00078XGJM,"I really thought this movie was good.  To be sure, it is a children's movie, specifically for young horse-crazy girls. There are a few boys that ride in it also. Very age appropriate fare for your stable/barn kids to watch and enjoy over and over again, it follows several story lines all related to life at the barn for a group of girls and boys that own and work with the horses there.  As a grown up horse-crazy woman now, I enjoyed it with my 4 year old daughter and certainly would have loved for this series to be around when I was that age!  Two thumbs up for young entertainment with no veiled adult-type references, no skimpy clothes, and no bad language, just good stories that are fun and horse-centric.",1221091200,22,714,4.435114503816794

8045996,5,B00078XGJM,"I got this DVD for my 8-year old horse-loving granddaughter.  She enjoys the stories very much, and we do not have to worry about her seeing anything inappropriate.  The stories are all entertaining with moral lessons in friendship and responsibility.  This would be a good DVD for any horse-loving girl from 5-12.",1381881600,,314,5.0

but i won't recommend it to anyone cuz is not helpful nor informative",1372809600,,121,4.083333333333333
8045998,2,B00078XGJM,im horse crazy and i owned a lot of saddleclub books as a kid but this travesty (mostly the tv show but the movie too) butchered them.,1368316800,,134,4.0

8046000,2,B00078XGJM,"This ""movie"" was a huge disappointment.  My granddaughter already owns complete Season 1 and Season 2 on dvd - when we played this one, she commented that she had seen it all before.  The description says it's ""based"" on the series, but it doesn't really state that this is a compilation style dvd.  For us, it was a waste of money, as it duplicates what we already have.  If you don't already have the episodes, then you would probably find this one enjoyable.",1366502400,3,461,4.518072289156627
8046001,5,B00078XGJM,"Good series about children at a riding school. It does have a ""mean"" girl, but the good girls always solve their problem, and take good care of their horses.",1362009600,,157,4.448275862068965
8046002,5,B00078XGJM,"Got this for my granddaughter who is nine and has been taking lessons and riding for 2.5 years.  Like most girls she loves horses, has now joined 4H for horses and spends as much time as possible at the barn with her horse.  Horse movies are always enjoyed.",1356739200,,257,4.333333333333333
