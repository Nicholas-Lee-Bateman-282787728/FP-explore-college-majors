3818891,5,B001V5K3IW,"Here is the deal, I have numerous ""booty"" videos.  The problem is the next day I cannot feel that I have worked my booty.  The day after first exercising with Booty Camp I felt it.  All the exercises really do work your booty yet also give you a full body workout as well.  Hands down the best video I have ever done for my booty.  The time working out also went by quickly because of the quick changes in the video.  This is the fitness video to get if you want to lift and seriously tone your bottom!",1237161600,2,502,4.071428571428571
8345478,2,B001V5K3IW,"I was really looking forward to this exercise dvd after seeing her on Fox & Friends.  Unfortunately, I'm disappointed in it.  I think the exercises are good, but the manner in which it's made is poor.  The sound is bad, you hear wind noise and can't hear her with instructions or counting.  I understand what she was trying to accomplish with the different scenes and no music so you could use your own, but it didn't work for me.  I like to see instruction of the move then do it.  The angles switch too much and make it confusing when to switch sides.  As stated, I was excited about this dvd until I played it.",1381363200,,613,4.278260869565218
8345479,1,B001V5K3IW,Am I the only one who received a yoga workout dvd instead of the fitness workout?  I thought maybe it was a preview but no cardio on here.,1379894400,,138,3.9285714285714284
8345480,3,B001V5K3IW,Recoding quality is low and hard to hear at times. The exercises are great withvgreat results. For the price it is OK,1377302400,,117,4.363636363636363
8345481,4,B001V5K3IW,"I like the video and recommend it to anyone wanting to firm up their bottom. I've done this video a few times already and feel the results, my only problem is I have bad knees and some of the moves are hard for me to do, so I just improvise and do my own thing similiar to what she is doing. Also there are some parts that you can't hear her in the video because of the wind, but it really isn't a huge deal because you still get what she is doing.",1360195200,,448,3.827956989247312
8345482,5,B001V5K3IW,Great butt workout that incorporates the entire body!  I am dripping with sweat and feel like I've done an hour workout in 30 minutes.,1357430400,2,134,4.583333333333333
8345483,2,B001V5K3IW,"No so good. It has alot of background noise like the wind blowing. Goes too fast from one exercise to another, not enough time to get in position. I'll be selling it on Ebay.",1279756800,2,174,4.147058823529412
8345484,5,B001V5K3IW,"Did this workout last night -- great workout --- i was puffing by the 2nd cardio and I am pretty advanced.  Loved the leg lift push-ups - great advanced move...but you can modify for beginners and then have something to do as you move up. im planning to keep doing it - it reminds me of the jillian michaels 30 day shred -- which is 3 20 min workouts (cardio, strength and abs)  Awesome!",1243900800,3,387,4.216216216216216
8345485,2,B001V5K3IW,"I bought this a while ago and was not satisfied so I returned it. Nikki is very peppy and always has a smile on her face though she moves and transitions too quickly and does not explain her movement well enough. Half the time the shots don't show where her foot placement is (this is dangerous because if you position your knees/ankles incorrectly you can cause a lot of strain and damage).
Seems a bit low quality- though I have nothing to compare it to.

On the actual exercise end- some of the moves are great though these moves are the classical ones you can also find on youtube or the internet in general. I was hoping that she would bring something new to the table.",1242000000,,674,4.349206349206349

8345487,5,B001V5K3IW,"CHEERS to a workout video that actually does what it says it will do!! I suffer from cronic flat-butt-disorder. When I work out, I easily get toned and lose weight if needed, but the more I hit the gym the more my behind resmebles an ironing board. Booty Bootcamp is kicking my butt into the round shape I've always wanted. I can see and feel the difference in the shape of my behind from only using the DVD a couple of times. I'm getting married in September and my goal is to have buns to brag about by then. I recommend  it for anyone looking for a backside makeover, not to mention you are still toning the rest of your bod too. I even have my fiance doing the yoga streches with me. Throw away everything else that hasn't work and pop Nikki in your DVD player!",1237161600,2,765,4.204081632653061
