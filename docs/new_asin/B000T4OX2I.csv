I am 60 years old and exercise has never been a part of my routine, but thought stretching would be all I would need. I went to a library used book & tape sale and paid 50 cents for her 15-minute ""Slim & Limber"" stretching routine.  After procrastinating for many months, on August 1, I started doing the the workout 3 times per day for the first month.  I found it was easy to squeeze 15 minutes in here and there.  It made me feel wonderful and I was ready for the next step. So I searched on Youtube to see what else she had to offer. It looked like ""Cool it Off! Express"" would be the next step for me since it was a 30-minute routine but still stretching. I absolutely love Debbie's routines and professional way she makes her DVDs.",1441497600,4,822,4.25

8207735,5,B000T4OX2I,"I love this video for days that I need a longer stretch to my workout that that workout cool-down provides.  I love how relaxing it is and even though I have hearing loss in one ear, I have no problem hearing Debbie's voice in the dvd.  It was soothing and wonderful and is just 30 minutes long.

Sometimes I skip through the first few chapters and just do the last 1/2.  That always feels great to get those long-held stretches.

My son even used this dvd to improve his flexibility for the long jump in Track when he was in high school.",1406592000,2,538,4.235294117647059
8207736,5,B000T4OX2I,"I have to whole heartly disagree with the first reviewer perhaps we have different needs that we are trying to achieve. I need a cool down video that is gentle and can take my stressed out mind down a notch and this does that. I enjoy Debbie's soft voice and relaxed manner. It is my perspective that she is focused and into the cool down but remember this is not intended to be a ""work out"" but a cool down! I am not as sore as I have been and love to fit this in between my workouts. I work out every day with one day off and this is so beneficial for helping with tired muscles.",1361577600,7,581,3.9743589743589745
8207737,1,B000T4OX2I,"Debbie speaks too quietly in this cool down video. It is slow to begin with,but, it almost put me to sleep and there is a great lack of enthusium to do these exercises with her , as she lacks the desire herself.",1344470400,,211,4.0476190476190474
