2914626,5,B000U1ZV6C,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. It came more quickly than expected. Having the Steven Seagal classics all in one, is a great treat for anyone who does not have any of his movies. These show Steven Seagal in his prime, when they actually showed the fight sequences and his gut didn't get in the way. Highly recommend.... They don't make good marital arts/aikido movies anymore!!",1232409600,,389,4.735294117647059

2914628,2,B000U1ZV6C,I was a huge fan of Steven Segal when I was a kid but seeing these movies now is nostalgic yet embarrassing to be part of my collection.  Under Siege is the gem here.  Above the Law is second best also.,1225238400,,202,3.902439024390244

2914630,4,B000U1ZV6C,steven seagal is a great martial arts actor. he may not have the speed of jet li but he does what he does well and these four movies are packed with action. you cant go wrong for the price. the fire down below is one of my favorite movies.,1220572800,,239,3.8979591836734695

2914632,5,B000U1ZV6C,"This DVD bundle includes 4 of Segal's best movies. They are the same transfers from the crappy early Warner DVD's. Though, at least here you get them cheaper. It brings Under Siege on one side, you flip the DVD and you have Glimmer Man on the other side of the disc. On the second disc you have Above The Law, you flip that disc and you have Fire Down Below. They all come in 1:85,16X9 widescreen anamorphic. The picture quality is average on most of them. They are all in 5.1 surround except Above The Law which is in Mono.

{Above The Law} (1988)- R- Disc 1 Side 1
The Story of the movie is a bit confusing for an action movie. As a matter of fact a review said "" it contains 50 percent more plot than it needs, but that allows it room to grow in areas not ordinarily covered in action thrillers""(Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times=1988) and its true the movie is in a way unoriginal but it manages to be fresh by keeping the audience thinking and observing who is working for whom. The movie commences in Vietnam with the character of Nico Toscanni, he is recruited by the C.I.A to assist as an observant. Then we see the character as a cop investigating a drug ring. And it seems that everyone Nico busts comes out of jail quickly. Instead of being defended he is asked to back off. So it is obvious something is up...but what? The rest I leave to you to find out. Its a clever story that even though it's been used in various action movies of the 80's and 90's it still brings in a an extra punch. A must own by any Seagal enthusiastic

MY PERSONAL RATING: 3  OUT OF 5

{Fire Down Below} (1997)-R- Disc 1 Side 2

Segal plays Jack Taggart, an agent of the Environmental Protection Agency; and like ""On Deadly Ground"" Segal has a thing for protecting people from rich industrialist, that only have one thing in mind...to make more money. Taggart arrives in a small town in Kentucky, he posses as a carpenter, interested only in fixing peoples porches and houses. But as we all know Segal is undercover and is ready for some action. In this small town in eastern Kentucky, Someone is dumping toxic waste down the mountains...now that's a big no-no. Taggart begins to question people of the town, if they know of anyone that is involved with the dumping; no one of course can help because they are being watched, and even if they could they're too chicken....So you know what that means..That's right, Seagal is goanna have to save the day from cowards that cant stand up for themselves.
MY PERSONAL RATING: 3  OUT OF 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under Siege-(1992)-R- Disc 2, Side 1

Seagal plays Casey Rayback...he is a cook for battleship USS Missouri. Rayback has to prepare a meal for a special surprise party for The Captain (Patrick O'Neal) but the surprise is the new arrivals, which seem like musicians and caterers but in fact are invaders that are planning to overtake the ship to steal its arsenal of nuclear Tomahawk cruise missiles. The overtaking went as planned, the people on board are taken as hostage. But...they didn't plan on the cook. Aside from being a cook he is an Ex petty officer/Navy seal who has been given medals many times and is an expert in martial arts and his specialty is counter-terrorism...oh boy..The bad guys chose the wrong ship to overtake. The movie is filled with great lines, and some quirky humor. This is Seagal while he still was the champ. Worth owning, for sure.

MY PERSONAL RATING: 4 OUT OF 5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Glimmer Man-(1996)-R- Disc 2, Side 2
In Glimmer Man Seagal plays Jack Cole, an Ex government intelligence operative known as ""The Glimmer Man,"" because he could move so quickly and quietly that his victims would only see a glimmer before they died. in fact that is so BS, Segal moves slower than his previous movies here, his gut is beginning to grow and his acting is stale and wooden. anyhow back to the movie, Cole is assigned to work with An L.A. police detective named Jim Campbell (Keenen Ivory Wayans) they are both on the look for a serial killer known as the ""Family Man"" he is given that name because...well he kills families; and aside from killing them he tortures and crucifies them after their deaths. After a string of murders the killer gets personal, he kills Coles wife..and you know what that means...that's right...its payback time, but it seems that this killings are beginning to get weird, there is a copycat making the murders look like ""the Family Man""....now the question is Who is the killer, the ""family man or the copycat?

Along with these psychos we have a local crime boss doing dealings with the Russians, somehow it's all connected and don't expect a clever twist because there really isn't. I give them credit for adding some suspense here and there, but Segal doesn't belong in this movie, he feels out of place. The only good actors in this movie are Keenen Ivory Wayans and Brian Cox.
MY PERSONAL RATING: 2  OUT OF 5

EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THE MOVIES LIKE GLIMMER MAN AND FIRE DOWN BELOW ARENT THAT GREAT, ITS STILL A SWEET DEAL FROM WARNER BROS. 4 FILMS ON ONE DVD SET, COME'ON WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR.

2914633,4,B000U1ZV6C,"The initial 4 Films Favorites here is not the first DVD compilation of Steven Seagals work, but after seeing so many subsequent collection of classics composed of the Buddhist Bonecrushers direct-to-video work, this set has proven itself to be one of the best out there. Along with its&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/follow-up-release/dp/B0050MB5NO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">follow-up release</a>, this Warner Bros. package is a great starter pack for the aspiring Seagal fan  I know so, because thats what I was when this was first released in 2007. The lack of additional features on the single disc releases of these movies makes this set a sensible purchase for both nostalgia-seekers and new fans.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-Siege/dp/B002AT8KDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under Siege</a>&nbsp;is to Seagal what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2-Judgment-Day/dp/B001VLBDD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a>&nbsp;is to Arnold Schwarzenegger: his biggest movie to date and the one hes most prominently identified with. Its a big, chugging action flick featuring lots of gunfighting, some martial arts, a ton of explosions, and stellar supporting work from villains Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey. If you're apprehensive about the low budget features that Stevens associated with nowadays, know that this is as far from that standard as you can get.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Glimmer-Man/dp/0790729334/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Glimmer Man</a>&nbsp;is a serial killer thriller, clearly influenced by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven/dp/B00011CZRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven</a>&nbsp;and thoroughly out-of-the-ordinary for Seagal. Im not a particular fan of this one, but its a unique enough entry into Stevens filmography. The snarky stabs at humor, uncomfortably dark tone, and unabashedly strange character Seagal plays has some appeal, even if these things come at the expense of the movies momentum. Keenan Ivory Wayans does what he can with a demeaning costarring role.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Above-The-Law/dp/B000EWBKOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Above The Law</a>&nbsp;was Seagals entry into film, and its a personal favorite of mine. This one may feature the star at his physical best, and the films focus on gritty street violence over shootouts and explosions provides ample opportunity to show off his best moves. The accent slung by Seagal is a constant reminder of his dramatic limits, but what makes the movie stand out even on this collection is the personal nature of the story and the characters: the relationships between the characters just feel more personal than those of the other movies, making all the violence a little more biting.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fire-Down-Below/dp/B0045HCIWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fire Down Below</a>&nbsp;is an environmental action film  a subgenre which Seagal is frequently identified with, even though he only did a couple of these. While&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Deadly-Ground/dp/0790740826/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Deadly Ground</a>&nbsp;examined the environmental hazards of the oil industry, this one deals with the dumping of toxic waste, and while the idealism may still make the film unpalatable to some viewers, its subject seems all the more pertinent today. Theres a good deal of satisfying action, including a Grade-A chase scene, but the biggest attraction may be the immense population of country singers in acting roles.",1211068800,30,3830,7.1210191082802545

Glimmer man was an extra bonus, it was not as good as under siege but, still one of seagal's better movies. Above the law was very b budget, corny; it also had several long breaks in the action scenes. Fire down bellow was ok although, it still doesn't compare to the first two.

My husband loves Steven Seagal's movies and was very happy to purchase, Fire Down Below, Glimmer Man, Above the Law and Under Siege, on the same DVD collection. Steven Seagal is one of the greastest actors of all time and his action packed movies keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what he's going to do next.
Now that we know Amazon. com has DVD collections of the movies we love, we're planning to purchase more collections in the near future. We have been loyal customers of Amazon.com for many years and enjoy ordering from your website because it's user friendly and easy to find what we're looking for.",1337126400,,727,4.6
2915265,4,B000U1ZV6C,"The DVD set has four movies that cover a period that could be Segal's best.

The Glimmer Man is possibly the best of the group, it has some nice action but also good interpersonal dynamics. The adversaries Segal faces in this are possibly the best portrayed of any of his films.

Under Siege is as high action as many Segal movies but doesn't manage to intertwine the personal dynamics as well as some movies however that's more than redeemed in Fire Down Below where community adversity comes to the fore in a movie that finds itself in environmental injustice and corruption in the legal system. The minister is particularly well played in this as is the beekeeper.

Above the Law is another play of government corruption which is a regular undercurrent in Segal movies. This time its focused around the CIA and rouge internal operations - it's a good movie if you want to think about who watches the watchers.

As a group they all are better than average movies from the standpoint of sets, storyline, acting and composition.

If you enjoy action movies or Segal in particular its very unlikely you will be disappointed.

At the price point it's hard to fault this set, delivered quickly and as ordered.",1327190400,2,1206,4.719047619047619

2915343,5,B000U1ZV6C,"The only one that disappoints me is Fire Down Below. Not that it isn't classic aging Steven Seagal with his ridiculous Native American Jackets and stationary, almost senior-citizen like hand to hand combat. He just has better movies (See: Hard to Kill).

Anyway, this is awesomeness in a movie collection. The culminating moment was when my girlfriend looked over at me after seeing one of his outfits, and asked what nationality he was. Of course I said he's 1/8 Native American and 100% Steven Seagal. Then I gave her a stone cold stare-down and broke a piece of wood over her legs.
