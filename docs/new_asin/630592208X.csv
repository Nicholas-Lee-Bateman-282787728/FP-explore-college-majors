8048913,5,630592208X,"This film certainly falls into the category of being bad enough to be good. Pledges at a sorority house are plagued by a former sister who happens to be a vampire. Luckily, each of the new pledges is skilled at kickboxing so they are able to defend themselves. The acting is horrendous, the kickboxing scenes are totally laughable, and the vampiric special effects are at about the speed of the fake teeth they used to sell in the back of comic books. However, the girls are all incredibly gorgeous, so the T&A value is quite high, and if you are in the right frame of mind the film will have you rolling on the floor laughing. Elvira should get a hold of this one.",1524182400,,665,4.370967741935484

8048915,4,630592208X,"""Vampires of Sorority Row"" (Bovine Productions, 1999) is another entry in the deathless vampire genre, this time with pretty girls chasing each other, spanking each other, biting each other.  It's the sort of movie that would make a straight-laced critic retch.  But for those who like sexy, post-pubescent hijinks laced with suspense and a little satire, it's a pleasant enough way to spend an hour and a half.
The plot?  There isn't any.  Not much, anyway.  Three pretty girls pledge a sorority, only to discover that the initiation process requires humiliation and pain.  To make matters worse for the pledges, some of the sorority sisters are vampires who do their best to bite them on the neck.  Some succeed, some don't.  And that's about it for story line.
But the girls are gorgeous, the visuals are first-rate, and that's enough to make ""Vampires of Sorority Row"" one of the brightest of guilty pleasures.  Recommended for men (and some women) with a sense of humor and 90 minutes to kill.",1007942400,4,998,4.8579881656804735
8048916,1,630592208X,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS VIDEO!!! Since I was foolish enough to buy this movie (and I use that term loosely), I forced myself to watch the entire thing. It went straight from my VCR to the garbage can. Save your hard earned money for a film that is worthy of your time. Enough said!
P.S. The only reason that it received the one star rating is because the program wouldn't let me give it a minus mark that the movie deserved.",1007856000,,432,4.154761904761905
