1808537,5,B00007G1WV,"I used to watch George Carlin a lot when I was a kid. We regarded him as being quite risqu (lol) but today, I must admit, his brand of humor seems rather dated. What we have to remember with Carlin is that he was a forerunner, and this DVD really makes you realize the type of influence he had on the great comedians of our day--particularly Jerry Seinfeld. He was a giant of the observational method, and laid the ground upon which many a great career has traversed. Carlin's delivery is also magnificent. His acting and presence made him transcend what seems to be so-so material. He's no Chris Rock, but he made an enormous contribution to comedy.",1187913600,4,650,4.516949152542373
1808538,3,B00007G1WV,"A Readers Digest collection of mostly ancient bits of his youthful  beginnings--much of the routines is dated, maybe funny then but our new youth may not relate. Still George, but he has certainly improved with age.",1168300800,2,215,4.972222222222222
1808539,5,B00007G1WV,"Some of this stuff is from the 70's when George Carlin was young and in 1990, he looked a little bit older like in Scary Movie 3 where he looks like Santa Claus as ""the architect"". George Carlin is my personal favorite comedian and it's as good as Robin Williams-Live on Broadway. Recently, I heard that nowadays he wants to be taken more seriously. I think he would be very good in something serious. That's just me.",1092268800,,417,4.428571428571429
1808540,3,B00007G1WV,"This is my 2nd bunch of comments on this DVD, my first has not been posted, maybe it never will be.  I hope not.  I've thought the matter over.  I've read a lot of reviews of Carlin since I discovered him the other day, and I've noticed that the people who worship him seem as a general rule to like violence in their ""music"" and their movies.  (I've been reading other reviews by Carlin devotees.)  I've also noticed that many if not most of the rave reviews (particularly one that praised his intelligence) are illiterate.  A few reviews I agree with.  Early, young Carlin was warmer, calmer, more human, more humane and just plain funnier.  The comparison can be made on this DVD, because the last bit ""Driving"" was by an older Carlin.  What were previously comical expressions on his face became grotesque manic grimaces, what was sly and warm became ferocious rage, what was controversial (and I get this also from the Jammin'/Doin' It DVD which I watched part of) became meaningless rantings.  His early stuff was amusing (I prefer Bob Newhart) and I laughed some, it was not particularly insightful, some of his observations of life and things (eg the differences between dogs and cats, stuff, losing things) were clever and often dead-on.  I obviously preferred the younger Carlin (and he was pretty then with all his hair, the older version simply didn't even look like him, whichever was the real him), and I thought the older Carlin was just an explosion of incoherent hatred.  Vulgar (yay!), but to me not funny.",1080086400,6,1524,4.731060606060606
1808541,4,B00007G1WV,"It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to successfully put together a ""Best of Carlin"" on CD or DVD.  Why?  Because it'd take up too much time.  Carlin has done NUMEROUS bits that are now deemed classic, and personally I think almost everything the man does, is great.  And yet, here is this DVD,  ""George's Best Stuff.""  Well, it is a start, but only covers SOME of the great things this very funny and unique man has said and done.
It's not a complete disappointment though.  The bits and segments included are indeed funny.  And, I love how a lot of the stuff included are from older shows and acts.  I really do think Carlin shines the best in his older material, but the Carlin today is still very funny and on top of his game.  It was nice to see some of these older bits from older shows, and I hope they come out on DVD sometime soon.
The DVD includes famous bits such as ""Seven Dirty Words,"" ""Stuff,"" ""Al Sleet,"" ""Dog Incident,"" ""Fussy Eater,"" ""Losing Things,"" ""Driving,"" and much more.  The DVD has a total of 17 chapters and adds up to the DVD being 87 minutes.
AH HA!  There lies the problem.  87 minutes.  ONLY 87 minutes??  87 minutes for something with the title of ""George's Best Stuff?""  These 87 minutes should represent the entire comedy life of George Carlin?  I hope not!  Like I said, it's a nice start, but I think something of this magnitude should really be longer.  There's so much that is left out on this DVD.  So many classic bits that fail to appear on this package with the name ""George's Best Stuff.""  The stuff that is included does indeed qualify as some of George's best bits, but I think there was a missed opportunity here.  I really think more could've been done.
Is ""George's Best Stuff"" a complete disappointment?  Of course not.  Is it enjoyable to watch?  Most definitely.  Should Carlin fans check it out?  By all means, yes.  However, I really do believe more could've been done and that more could've been included.  While ""George's Best Stuff"" isn't a total disappointment, it does leave you feeling that more could've and should've been done to honor the very title on the DVD cover, ""George's Best Stuff.""  It's a start, but I'm afraid it is only that.",1052956800,74,2185,4.5

1808623,5,B00007G1WV,"George Carlin will always be I think an iconic stand up.  He was much more than a comedienne.  All comics today, from Seinfeld, to Lewis Black and most others, emulate Carlin's current and very realistic view of our world.  This disc is a good compilation of his stand up work.  Rough, gruff and towards the end of his life, more angry and berating, Carlin exemplifies what many feel but cannot articulate and he did it his way.",1379116800,,428,4.51948051948052

1808658,4,B00007G1WV,"I love George Carlin. Therefore, I can say categorically this is NOT his best stuff. His very best stuff was done after 1996. Still, if you call it ""His Best Stuff To Date,"" I guess I'll agree.

Of course ""Seven Words You Can't Say on TV"" is there, also dated. After all, once we had cable TV, all censorship was basically a thing relegated to the irrelevant broadcast band. Still, this is not just a rant about censorship, this is high-grade comedy. George goes into detail about most of the words, subjects them to a linguistic analysis that will have you in stitches.

""Stuff"" is so true it's amazing he manages to make it funny as well, but that's essential Carlin: he can put just that little twist on it that forces you to laugh. The underlying serious message -- that we have too much stuff, care too much about our stuff, and can be considered highly materialistic -- goes down like medicine with a spoonful of sugar.

""Baseball and Football"" relies heavily on his exquisite ability with sound effects and rapid-fire delivery, as well as a consistent voice management: one when describing football that sounds like what football is, and another when describing baseball that is equally fitting. Again, the observations reveal some important things about those who love these sports.

""Dogs and Cats"" does far more than get us laughing hysterically at his imitations, although it definitely does that. His observations about the two animals and the people who love them are simply priceless.

There's much more, but you get the idea. It really is a collection of the best he had done as of 1996.",1336953600,4,1602,4.748201438848921

1808679,3,B00007G1WV,"George Carlin had several good bits and they are all represented here. The DVD is definitely funny but some of the bits have been shortened by editing and overall I don't believe these particular performances do the man justice. Funny material, but Carlin did them better in other venues.

This focuses on some of his earlier (and some would argue better) material so some of it is a little dated but it's still great. I'm 25 and was too young to enjoy the material when it came out but I find it hilarious and intellictually stimulating now. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of George Carlin.,1228780800,3,368,4.125
1808687,5,B00007G1WV,"I've always loved and admired George so of course this review may be a bit bias.
This particular dvd is a conglomeration of years and different venues.  For instance the 'dirty word' pops up several times during this dvd but from a different time and place.  He just adds to them.  It's nice to see George while relatively young and see him age.  But the humor doesn't change.  His outlook on the world so matches my own, I only wish I could have made a living like he did.  He has such a way of showing us how odd we really are.  For instance, an attachment to our 'stuff'.
Back to the point.  If you are a fan, you will be enchanted by this dvd.
RIP George!
