8220704,5,B000VZGIP0,"This is an outstanding acheivement of the Spanish television. The realism is perfect (I,ve been in the Albufera myself and I know wath it is)and taken as a whole, the production makes honor to the original novel by Blasco Ibnez. The casting is very well chosen in order to embody the character of the personages in the book. Having it in your library is worthwhile.",1316563200,,365,4.630769230769231
