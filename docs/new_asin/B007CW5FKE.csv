5078847,4,B007CW5FKE,"One of the better reality shows in some years.  It's a shame it was cancelled after this season.  It follows three separate professional storm chaser teams as they crisscross the American midwest trying to get the best footage and science data on the most violent tornadoes.  Two of the three teams actually drive their armored trucks right into tornadoes - on purpose.  The only downside is IMX filmmaker Sean Casey's bouts of immaturity (give him credit, he's under a lot of stress), which are played up here to add unnecessary drama.  The tornadoes are really enough, and there is some lovely footage of severe weather captured here by a very fine field crew.

It's a little sad watching this, knowing what happened to Tim Samaras in 2013, but it's good that his work was as well documented as it was.",1383782400,3,804,4.707142857142857
5078848,5,B007CW5FKE,"I LOVED EVERY SEASON, I AM TAKING METEOROLGY CLASSES, BUT SADLY OVER THE SUMMER-A TEAM MADE UP OF A FATHER WHO WAS THE PROJECT LEADER, HIS SON, AND THE LEADER BEST FRIEND DIED IN THAT BIG TORNADO THIS SUMMER CHASING IT, AND THEY WERE A VERY GREAT TEAM, IT MIGHT BE AWILE I WATCH THEM AGAIN",1382054400,2,289,4.178571428571429

5078852,4,B007CW5FKE,"Storm Chasers Season 5 takes place during the 2011 Tornado season. It is unfortunately the final season of the show. This season once again follows the storm chasing teams led by Sean Casey, Reed Timmer and Tim Samaras as they navigate Tornado Alley in search of the most useful tornado data and the most extreme tornado footage as well. With 2011 being one of the most devastating Tornado Seasons, there is no shortage of action in season 5. Reed upgrades his Storm Chasing vehicle and has his usual clashes with his fellow teammates. Meanwhile, Sean starts filming tornadoes in 3D and in the final episode of the series, gets perhaps the best tornado footage I've ever seen. Season 4 eliminated the narrator during the episodes, while the chasers would narrate what happens. It made the show a bit cheesy and this is corrected in Season 5 with the return of a proper narrator. Perhaps the only complaint I have is the over use of sound effects in this season. Crashes of thunder follow every single flash of lightning and they all sound the same which makes the show seem like less of a documentary. Other than that this is a great ending to a fantastic series and I would reccomend that any Storm Chasers fan gets this final season.",1343606400,8,1235,4.6438356164383565
5078853,5,B007CW5FKE,"The fifth and final season of the Discovery Channel series ""Storm Chasers"" was eventful for Reed Timmer, Sean Casey, Tim Samaras, and their chase teams.  The 2011 tornado season in the U.S. was the most devastating in recent decades, with hundreds of fatalities nationwide and extreme damage in Tuscaloosa and Joplin.

Timmer's team saw perhaps the most violent tornado in the history of the series in Mississippi during the historic April outbreak in the Deep South.  The series shows the devastation wrought during those few days, and it was tragic.  The three teams also chased in Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Nebraska, and Arkansas in Season 5.

The teams put new innovations and equipment to work during this season, and hoped to collect scientific data that would enable meteorologists to understand tornadoes better and issue more timely warnings.  The sailing was not always smooth, though, as the teams faced equipment failure, the guesswork and frustration that comes with chasing tornadoes, and tensions and arguments between team members concerning chasing strategies.

A bonus episode, ""Behind the Storms,"" shows how the series was produced.  The three teams had varying levels of success in 2011, and fans of the series wish the teams well in their future chasing endeavors.",1339113600,5,1294,5.278048780487805

8514706,5,B007CW5FKE,"Season 5 was the final season of this series and it showed more storms and some great footage. Sean was in a slump, the loss of Matt Hughes had taken its toll on everyone in the TIV team, as did his wrangling with Josh and it seemed that he was losing interest in what he was doing for a time. Reed and Joel of the Dominator team were also at odds, to the point where Joel was kicked to the highway to make his own way. Thankfully, another Chaser was able to help him get home. Tim Samaras had managed to obtain a brand new radar system but it proved to be more hindrance than help as they were also hoping to deploy some new probes and the weather kept frustrating his efforts. Still, the chase went on. TIV team managed to catch a break and caught some of the most spectacular footage they were hoping for. Reed's foray into a storm without Joel turned dangerous enough that he decided to make up with him to get him back behind the wheel for a truly intense intercept. Only the Twistex team suffered a disappointing end of season, thanks to the new radar system as it was too delicate for hail. There was also a point where Joel and Reed found tornadoes a little closer to home than they wanted as the 2011 season ramped up and began to show some teeth. A great series, a wonderful finale- and my condolences to Team Twistex for losing three of their best and brightest in 2013. At least, this series gave us a glimpse of their legacy.",1408665600,,1438,4.251824817518248
8514707,3,B007CW5FKE,"As a huge fan of the previous 4 seasons of Storm Chasers, I found it disappointing that with 2011 being the record-breaking storm season that it was, all of these veteran teams were so far off of their games. Tim Samaras' (rest his brilliant soul) expensive and delicate doppler radar system ended up being an annoying hinderance to his team's efforts. TVN's equipment upgrades were off schedule, and Sean Casey spent most of the season in burn out mode. Discovery's production team was as always, second to none.",1403654400,,513,4.840909090909091
