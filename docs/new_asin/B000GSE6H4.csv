2617316,3,B000GSE6H4,"I would actually give this 3.5 stars out of 5.  It's pretty good because they don't beat you over the head with violence all the time.  But when the action happens, they don't hold back.  An interesting part of character development is Sunwoo's realization that he has to learn to use guns in order to take down his enemies.  For the first half of the movie he is all about fists until he is forced to pick up firearms when the number of his enemies greatly increases.  The ""love"" story was the only negative point for me.  He becomes infatuated with his boss' girlfriend, but she doesn't give him anything more then a glance and a smile during the whole movie.  His love for her was his downfall but she never reciprocated.  I would have liked to know more about Sunwoo's past. Maybe that would have given some insight as to why he was so taken by this girl.",1229472000,,859,4.3584905660377355

2617318,5,B000GSE6H4,"I usually buy my own films and then review them later. There are only a couple reviews where I rented the film first. This is one of them, but I plan on buying this particular DVD. After reading several reviews of this film, I decided to rent it at my local video store. Some of the reviewers such as Jenny J.J.I, K. Jones and Woopak have given excellent reviews of this film, and I would recommend others to take a look at those reviews. I have recently run the gamut in viewing different genres of film as of late. From the Korean drama ""The Way Home,"" to the Japanese romantic comedy ""Train Man,"" and now this very violent, but highly recommended revenge film from Korea.

""A Bittersweet Life,"" was directed by Kim Ji-woon, and stars (Lee Byung-hun) as the character Sun-woo. Sun-woo is one vicious killer, and as the right hand man of a mob boss named Kang, (Kim Yeong-Chul) his job is to make those who displease his boss vanish. And he is very effective as the bosses enforcer. The life of Sun-woo is one of a world of violence. And in this life of violence where Sun-woo lives in there can be no mistakes. There are no second chances. Moreover, the consequences of making one can be fatal. However, we all make mistakes, and as such, so does Sun-woo. I don't wish to spoil this film for you, however, I will write that Lee Byung-hun gives a riveting performance in his role, and this is an excellent film.

Mr. Kang, has sent Sun-woo on an important mission: Find out if his mistress is cheating on him, and if so, take care of things. Does he? I won't give out details of the film that will ruin it for you, however, expect a lot of violence, as Sun-woo refuses to bend to Mr. Kang, and must endure one hell of an ordeal. End of film? No way! Sun-woo's revenge after what he endures at the hands of his Mr. Kang's minions veers the film into one violent crime drama. [But then it already was in the beginning] This is a dark world Sun-woo lives in, and so is his occupation, and as such the film delivers more than its share of violent scenes. I thought the film was great, and especially the cinematography. The ending as pointed out by others is different, but effective I believe. Sun-woo's life truly is bittersweet! This is a very good crime-noir film. Highly recommended. [Stars: 4.5]",1187395200,7,2298,4.430260047281324
2617319,5,B000GSE6H4,"A  BITTERSWEET LIFE is a dazzling neo-noir gangster film from director Kim Jae-woon(A Tale of Two Sisters).  It is a pretty much a perfect example on how to follow the basics in making an entertaining gangster film, like the old adage goes: "" If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". It may not have the most original plot in existence, but believe me; it works. The film is terrific; Revenge has never looked so darned Good!

Sun-woo(Lee Byung Hun, J.S.A.) is an impeccably dressed enforcer for a notorious crimelord called Kang(Kim Yeong-Chul). Sun-woo is instructed to to watch over his mistress Hee-Soo( Beautiful Shin Min-ah, Volcano High) to find out if she's making whoopee with another man. His orders are crystal clear: if he catches her cheating on Kang with another man, he is to contact Kang at once or finish them off himself.
The plot takes off when Sun-woo does catch her with her lover and as an act of mercy, he decides to let them both live. (On the condition they stop their affair) This gesture of pity brings a world of pain onto Sun-woo as the entire organization sets its goals to punishing him for his ""act of betrayal"". Beaten, bloodied and kicked out of the gang, Sun-woo survives the brutal ordeal. Sun-woo embarks on a brutal, bloody trail of vengeance from which no one is likely to survive, each kill brings him closer to a final confrontation with Kang. But a strange fact remains; Sun-woo has been a faithful servant to Kang for years, why would he suddenly have a change of heart? (it wasn't something as simple as love or lust, although lust may have played a small part at their meeting )

""A Bittersweet Life"" is a beautiful, wholly engaging cinematic masterpiece. It blends the ""hardboiled cool"" of classic film noir with highly stylized action reminicent of a John Woo film. (But not overly stylized like Woo's films)
Before Sun-Woo decides to ignore his boss's orders we watch as he slowly comes to an epiphany. However, we're not quite privy to the depth of this realization until the final scene of the film, in which everything that has come before soon makes simple, perfect sense.  The film becomes a visceral, wall-to wall action film when Sun-woo goes against Kang; the carnage goes to overdrive. The movie is also very cool and fresh; with nice touches, like a quiet moment wherein Sun-woo placidly savors a slice of chocolate cake before `going to work', adds a load of style, at the same time sets a moody atmosphere.

As brutally, violent this film is, it's quite refreshing that the filmmakers didn't lose their sense of humor.  To its credit, the film pitches in its share of comedic moments in the screenplay with all the blood and gore. A Bittersweet Life can be oddly funny at times with its share of cleverly paced moments of black humor.

Lee Byung-hun does a very convincing job in his portrayal of Sun-woo's character. The actor brings a certain depth and dynamic charisma to his anti-hero role, which is very impressive when we consider that a fully-realized characterization of Sun-woo hampered by the fact that his motivations MUST NOT be revealed until the film's climax. Even so, Lee conveys a sense of his character's life, even if it isn't something readily apparent by the script. Viewers will have to also take into account that the film is a (Sunwoo's)character study (of sorts) of a person who lived most of his life in the shadow of violence which in turn may make one an empty shell. The things that most people may take forgranted may be considered so ""fulfilling"" to someone with Sun-woo's life.

I have the (Region-3, Korean release) 2- DISC Director's cut of  A Bittersweet Life that clocks in at about 122 minutes. I cannot make a statement how it differs from the Theatrical cut since I haven't seen the ""shorter"" cut of the film in theaters.
PICTURE: 2.35 Anamorphic Widescreen. The transfer is very decent but not without a few flaws. There is a small amount of grain in some scenes and some heavy edge enhancements. On the plus side, it does have nice colors, accurate skin tones and strong (but detailed)black levels. Overall, still a good transfer.
AUDIO: Korean 6.1 DTS-ES, 6.1 Dolby Digital, 2.0 surround language mix. If you're equipped, the DTS track is the way to go as it provides intense and immersive listening experience that really brings the action and gunplay to life. The 6.1 Dolby digital is not bad, but it does have a lower bass level. The English subtitles are clean and clear, very easy to read.

IN CLOSING:
A Bittersweet Life is a visual and aural feast for its audience. Beautifully shot, some folks may find it superficial. Thankfully, that impression actually seems to be based on how the film is made, as everything is meant to build towards the film's conclusion in which the TRUE  motivation behind Sun-woo's quest for revenge is revealed. Quite visceral, sometimes lyrical and even comical, ""A Bittersweet Life"" is a complete cinematic experience and contains a climax to bring it to a ""bittersweet"" close. To sum it up, it is magnificent!
A BITTERSWEET LIFE is among my top 25 favorite films. ( I have 600 dvds)

2617320,4,B000GSE6H4,This was a good movie with good acting. My only draw back was the excessive violence. I also wish the ending was different but for those who enjoy this type of drama go for it you will not be disappointed. As usual Lee Byung Hun was great.,1183420800,,239,4.1063829787234045
2617321,5,B000GSE6H4,"This was a good movie but I did not like the end, it was maybe alittle confusing and it let open some questions of is this real or a dream.",1175299200,5,139,3.6666666666666665
2617322,5,B000GSE6H4,"I just can't get enough of these Korean revenge films because they're just so different and unique from your normal revenge plot. Now of course a film like this or one of the films from Park Chan-wook's ""Vengeance trilogy"" won't be appreciated by all simply because some may think they go to far with the amount of violence. It really depends on what your limit is but I had no problem with any of these films.

Sun-woo is a mob enforcer and a darn good one, as you'll see in the beginning. While eating desert in the restaurant he manages Sun-woo is alerted that there is a disturbance downstairs. Sun-woo quickly grabs someone (Min-gi) to help handle the situation. Three men are refusing to leave so Sun-woo tells them they have three seconds to leave and starts counting down. When he gets to 1 he tells Min-gi to lock the door. It's a little hard to explain what happens after the door is locked but let's just say Sun-woo handles the situation.  Sun-woo has been working for his boss Kang for seven years and has not made a mistake in all those years but everyone makes a mistake at least once in their life. Being in the mob he knows that he can't mess up but what happens is something that he couldn't help.

Come to find out the three men Sun-woo beat up were men from a rival mob family. This was not Sun-woo's only problem; actually this situation only provides half of the story's plot. While avoiding to talk to the boss of the rival family Sun-woo is asked to do something important for his boss. Kang has a mistress (Hee-soo) and suspects that she is seeing another man. Because of the age difference Kang believes that she is tired of him and is seeing a younger man. He asks Sun-woo to watch her for three days while he is away on business. Not only does he have to watch her but also he has to drive her and basically be attached to her hip. If he does find that she is seeing someone else Sun-woo is to either call Kang or take care of it himself. Sun-woo starts to fall for the girl and when he finds that she was unfaithful he can't finish the job.

After all this Sun-woo is caught by the rival family and that's when the good stuff starts. The film just goes crazy, after a few events I won't tell cause I don't want to spoil the film but after them Sun-woo goes on a revenge spree. No matter how bad the pain gets Sun-woo refuses to say sorry or show any remorse for any of the things he's done. He won't stop until he sees the situation to the end and let me tell you he definitely does. For the rest of the film it gets very nasty and bloody for Sun-woo and the men that have wronged him.

I was amazed to see Lee Byung-Hun (Addicted, Everybody Has Secrets) in this film, he did great fight sequences and just an overall perfect performance. The acting in this film was great, very realistic and believable but not over the top. The settings and picture were beautiful, great camera work and very good sound quality. I liked that Sun-woo felt like a real person. At the end when he confronts everyone he seems like a person that has been very hurt and insulted over the reasons he's been attacked. I didn't really see any flaws in A Bittersweet Life but some people will for their own reasons, which I do understand. I do hope that nobody takes this film as trying to bite off of Chan-wook's trilogy because you'll miss out. It's definitely not as complex as the trilogy but at the same time it has its own style and feel to it. Anyone that just wants to see a good film with a simple plot then I definitely encourage you to see this.",1175126400,5,3560,4.291666666666667
2617323,3,B000GSE6H4,"This isn't going to win an award or anything, but action movies don't get that kind of recognition anyway.  This is what I would call a smart action movie.  There is good character development, coupled with action that isn't too over the top, killing any suspensed disbelief.  I like Korean movies because there is usually an undeniable syle, and they tend to be darker than most american movies.  This isn't the cream of the crop for Korean films, but it is entertaining and it does have substance.",1172966400,,499,4.7011494252873565
2617324,5,B000GSE6H4,"Here's the lowdown: if you had to be really picky about it, A Bittersweet Life has a flimsy story.  Despite this shortcoming, this sort of movie doesn't need an incredible story.  In a nutshell, A Bittersweet Life is a revenge film.  A really well-crafted revenge film that centers around the life of a man born and raised to be a brutally efficient killer.  The main character, Sunwoo, is an enforcer for a Korean crime lord.  One day he opts to hold back on one of his hits in an attempt to save a girl he's fallen in love with.  This uncharacteristic act of kindness is Sunwoo's downfall.

Sunwoo is a wizard with unarmed combat (forget the wire-happy fake fu, this is no-holds-barred fistfighting we're talking about) and a proficient gunman.  If you're a fan of no-nonsense action sequences or thought OldBoy had cool fights, you're about to see the higher end of the spectrum.

It's light on plot, but the cinematography and action scenes in A Bittersweet Life are gorgeous.  Toss in a some black humor and you have a demmed good movie, start to finish.",1161993600,9,1059,4.645161290322581
2617325,5,B000GSE6H4,"A Bittersweet Life is one hell of a bad-ass classic gangster film. It has a great mix of action,drama and violence in it. It is a story of a gangster who realizes that he cannot live a life of his own. Sun Woo, a unique character with a curious lifestyle  he's not only a valued gang member and the proprietor of a hotel bar, but also the right-hand man to the powerful gang leader, Mr. Kang. When Kang suspects that his beautiful young mistress Hee Soo might be messing around with another man, he enlists Sun Woo's help to resolve the matter, commanding him to follow her around to see what information he can dig up. Sun Woo's orders are explicit: if he catches Hee Soo cheating, he is to execute her  no ifs ands or buts about it. However, when Sun Woo spies Hee Soo with her boyfriend, he makes a stunning decision, one that will have major consequences for all involved!

The viewer may focus too much on the action scenes but the movie is much more than that. This movie shows the pains of being a member of a merciless crime organization,as one is beholden to the crime boss for the rest of his life, will continue to live without any choices of his own. Apart from that, it provides another perspective to the viewer that being a gangster is not cool and no fun whatsoever.

The acting is great. Lee Byung-Hun is supremely talented that he can take a great film into another level. Shin Min-a provides the film some great moments despite of her limited time on screen. The direction was awesome as well. The action scenes does not feel artificial and fabricated at all since they all seem believable and real. This is definitely an Asian masterpiece.

This is essentially a deeply moving love story involving a tormented man who decides he wants a different life and is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice when his inner self is challenged by an arrogant boss.

2617337,5,B000GSE6H4,"This is an excellent movie. I will never view Korean film, 'fighting' films, or even action and/or suspense films the same. This movie has truly raised the bar. Right after watching it, through my search for a new movie, I wanted to watch it again. I wanted to buy it and watch all the special features. I wanted to get to know the characters more, and see the process this film took. After watching this movie, I was an instant Lee Byung Hun fan. And, as of now, I've seen all of his films. Perhaps that generates a deeper appreciation for this film, for me - the fact that I've now seen everything he's done.

The story is just perfect - it's not overly cliche, and despite being something probable/seen-before (girl taken); that's the ONLY part that's 'cliche'. Every step leading up to, and every step away from that moment; you're completely held hostage by this movie, on the edge of your seat. The story is well-done, too - not overly developed/obviously explained.. and you're not left wondering/guessing. The characters are one-hundred percent realistic - if you were them, you'd do the same things (if you had their skills/mentality, at least).

2617339,5,B000GSE6H4,"When I finished watching Dalkomhan Insaeng one of my first thoughts was where are the American filmmakers who are making movies like this? If this movie had been made here, which it never would/could, my guess is there would have been a dozen cars blown up, a city destroyed, a billion additional bullets fired, a gratuitous sex scene, a blazingly loud techno-rock score, an eye toward high fashion and merchandise tie-ins and an ending that was overly sentimental and unrealistic. When it was over people would have commented that Bruce Willis was getting a little too old for these types of roles and life would go on and the movie would be forgotten. Life still goes on, but hopefully A Bittersweet Life will get wider recognition and notice.

Sun-woo is an enforcer for the mob who receives a simple assignment from his boss: watch his much younger girlfriend while he leaves town because he's suspicious that she might be seeing someone else. If Sun-woo discovers that the girlfriend is cheating, his instructions are to kill both the girlfriend and her lover. In the meantime, a rival gang is trying to move in on Sun-woo's boss' territory and its Sun-woo's job to deal with that. Sun-woo finds himself enjoying the company of the woman he's been told to watch and maybe kill. A master of martial arts, Sun-woo soon finds himself in need of a gun. That's a very, very small thumbnail sketch; the plot is much deeper and intricate than that.

The writer and director filled the movie with obvious nods to Taxi Driver, Kill Bill, Sam Peckinpah and probably others that I didn't get, but what sealed the fact in my mind that this was a magnificent crime drama was the character depth of Sun-woo. Maybe I'm wrong, but in a lot of movies we have heroes who are bad guys doing bad things for good reasons and because they're doing something good it's all okay. Dalkomhan Insaeng we have a hero who's a bad guy doing bad things for pretty much bad reasons and you can't help but care for him and feel for him because he wants to do the right things, but, for reasons, can't. In many movies characters seek revenge for a wrongdoing, but never that I've ever seen on the level of this movie, and I don't mean physically, but emotionally.

I think the ending of the movie was just brilliant icing on a flawless cake and about as close to a perfect ending as I can imagine for the movie. Even the movie's imagery (stuff that usually goes over my head) worked and didn't seem forced or pretentious and it added to the overall beauty. Add to all of that a wonderful acting job by Byung-hun Lee and this is top-notch movie-making and entertainment.

The movie is in Korean with English subtitles. I recommend Dalkomhan Insaeng to anyone with a warning for extreme and graphic violence.",1297814400,3,2777,4.626774847870182
2617340,5,B000GSE6H4,"I saw this movie some time ago, did not have any expectations, but was extremely surprised as what i found. Firstly this movie gives the viewer a feeling on the Korean Mafia, their rules, ""morals"", and how the main character finds himself in conflict with them, by just falling prey to feelings.

Initially you think the movie is going to fall into a classic cliche that has been done many times, but it does not at all and is very unique in it's approach of the situation the main character is in. This guy does a great job in this role, he achieves something that is not easy, he appears cold and ruthless, which he is, but also gives you the hint that there is something more which he keeps under control.

Conclusion, great movie, do watch.",1289692800,,744,4.423357664233577

The action and cinematogrpahy are great throughout. It is unrealistic in parts, but that's how the movie was designed. My parents didn't like it because of the ending, but I don't see how it could have ended any other way. It's a story about revenge, and an uncompromising adherence to honor and duty.",1241308800,,510,4.604395604395604
2617342,5,B000GSE6H4,"At first impression, it would be easy to dismiss director Kim Jee-Woon's (A Tale Of Two Sisters) film as another revenge flick from South Korea in the same vein as Park Chan-Wook's ""Vengeance Trilogy"" and just another John Woo affair such as ""The Killer"" and ""Hard-Boiled"". I wouldn't bother writing a new review if this was just a typical revenge flick. ""A BITTERSWEET LIFE"" (2005) is a dazzling neo-noir gangster film that is a ""cardboard"" cut-out of EXACTLY what a gangster film should be--the film is just awesome. It may not have the most original plot in existence but the film makes it work, revenge has never looked this damn good!

Sunwoo (Lee Byung Hun) is the stone-faced, impeccably-dressed, trusted right hand enforcer of a gang boss named Kang (Kim Yeong-Chul). When Kang is about to leave on business, he sends Sunwoo to spy on his young girlfriend, Hee-Soo (Shin Minah, Volcano High) because he suspects her to be cheating on him with another man. Sunwoo keeps an eye on the girl who slowly begins to intrigue him, while he keeps things in order at his boss's hotel. Being a man so used to be in control, using any means necessary. One evening, he discovers Hee-Soo with another man, and for someone so emotionless, and cold, Sunwoo does the unthinkable and grants Hee-Soo an act of mercy, on the condition that she sever all ties with her lover. Unfortunately, this act of weakness has provoked his boss's ire and the end result will forever change his life.

Excellently shot, with lush cinematography, ""A Bittersweet Life"" is a visual and aural feast. The way director Kim Jee-Woon shoots the film is beautiful and almost eerily ""spectral-like"". The fancy camerawork is further complemented with the film's excellent soundtrack, the quality of the cinematography is insanely cool but at the same time exudes a ""classy"" and a very real atmosphere. The film is ultra-violent, and the attitude it just gives off is brilliant. The Long silence, accompanied by the close-ups and the violent set ups are so meticulously planned and carefully shot. Scenes such as Sunwoo flicking his light on and off, the sudden strong rush of wind, the close-ups of Hee-Soo's neck and ears are director Kim's lush touches of the film's strong mood.

The film also shows a lot of emotion and is anything but a brainless action film. The opening act of the film says a lot about Sunwoo, as his daily routine at home. He has been a loyal servant to Kang, what made him disobey in Hee-Soo's case? It isn't love, it's not as predictable as that. Before he decides to disobey his boss's orders, we slowly see Sunwoo come to an epiphany. However, we are not privy to this realization until the final scene of the film, as everything that came before begins to make perfect sense.

The film becomes a visceral, wall-to wall action film when Sun-woo goes against Kang; the carnage goes to overdrive. The gunplay may have been somewhat influenced by the usual Hong Kong and Japanese style but it manages to stand on its own. The movie is also very cool and fresh; with nice touches, like a quiet moment wherein Sun-woo placidly savors a slice of chocolate cake before `going to work', adds a load of style, at the same time sets a moody atmosphere. The black suits that gangsters usually wear looks crisper and cooler than ever, the lighting complements a strong alluringly attractive atmosphere but at the same time, it feels cold and foreboding. Kim isn't afraid to experiment with his set designs and color schemes either.

As brutally, violent this film is, it's quite refreshing that the filmmakers didn't lose their sense of humor. To its credit, the film pitches in its share of comedic moments in the screenplay amidst all the blood and gore. ""A Bittersweet Life"" can be oddly funny at times with its share of cleverly paced moments of black humor. I loved the scene with the gun dealers and the scene with a rival gang boss--Kim did his homework, as he manages to remember that mood changes aid a film's pace as long as it doesn`t affect the film`s momentum.

Lee Byung-hun does a very convincing job in his portrayal of Sunwoo's character. The actor brings a certain depth and dynamic charisma to his anti-hero role, which is very impressive when we consider that a fully-realized characterization of Sunwoo hampered by the fact that his motivations MUST NOT be revealed until the film's climax. Even so, Lee conveys a sense of his character's life, even if it isn't something readily apparent by the script. Viewers will have to also take into account that the film is a (Sunwoo's) character study (of sorts) of a person who lived most of his life in the shadow of violence which in turn may make one an empty shell. The things that most people may take fore granted may be considered so ""fulfilling"" to someone with Sun-woo's life. The supporting cast led by Kim Yeong-Chul is also excellent and promotes a character very confident and assured despite his age.

""A Bittersweet Life"" is a beautifully shot, wholly engaging cinematic experience. The film is so carefully and meticulously shot that some viewers may see it as superficial and too stylish. Thankfully, that impression actually seems to be based on how the film is made, as all plot elements are meant to build towards the film's conclusion in which the TRUE motivation behind Sunwoo's quest for revenge is revealed. Quite visceral, sometimes lyrical, poetic and even comical, ""A Bittersweet Life"" is a complete cinematic experience and contains a climax to bring it to a ""Bitter"" and ""soo sweet"" close. To sum it up, it is just TERRIFIC!

HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION [4  Stars]
Note: There are decent unofficial all-region copies floating around and the region-3 Korean release is out of print. Tartan has released this film in Europe but since CJ Entertainment is already operating in the U.S. then possibilities for an official region 1 release is expected.",1234051200,2,5924,4.822834645669292

2617344,4,B000GSE6H4,"This is Kim Jee Woon's follow up to his horror/suspense film ""A Tale Of Two Sisters"", which made a bit of a splash on the import scene.

I was wondering how the director of such a slow and moody film would do making a crime/revenge film. Pretty well, as it turns out.

The film is about a mob enforcer who has to watch after his bosses young lover, while he is away. He is informed that he must kill her, and her other lover, if she is found to have one.

Well, she does have one, and the enforcer can't bring himself to off her. Which sets in motion a lot of bad things to happen to him. Of course, being an unstoppable mob enforcer, he's not going to take that lying down, now is he?

You get the picture. The film starts up pretty slow paced, and somewhat artsy. It did remind me of ATOTS, and I was wondering if this guy had it him to make a more hard edged film. Well, obviously he was just setting a mood, because things do get quite violent, and action packed. There's also a moderate amount of humor(normal and dark).

I found the film to be quite good, and I was very impressed with it. It really impresses me how some of these South Korean films I have seen, such as The Host and Oldboy, will take a pretty cliched concept, and really take an artistic spin on it. They're quite artsy, imaginative, and filled with dark humor.

The unspoken (and perhaps unknown by Hee-soo, played by Min-a Shin) love interest is what drives our protagonist to disobey his boss, survive and get revenge while paying for it with his life.
