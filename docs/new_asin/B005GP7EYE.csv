4692514,4,B005GP7EYE,"In this sequel to Golden Christmas, the older parents, Rod and Katherine Wright, have retired to Florida after selling their old homestead in the west. Their Golden Retriever is with them and up to mischief again; matchmaking mischief that is.

The story follows the life of Lisa, a young woman who lives below them and just happens to have three Golden Retriever puppies (who I might add are scene stealers). The Wrights Golden Retriever seems to arrange an introduction to Lisa who develops a friendship with Katherine and eventually tells her of her friendship with David, a young man on the verge of marrying someone else.

Again the Golden Retrievers, all four of them seem to be in cahoots to see that all of the complications are resolved and the story ends happily for Lisa and her friend David.

I personally didn't like this one quite as much as the first movie but it too was pleasant and enjoyable.",1323129600,3,910,4.710691823899371
4692515,4,B005GP7EYE,"This sequel to ""A Golden Christmas"" follows the parents, Rod and Katherine, who were preparing to move to Florida in that movie. Well played by the actors from the original (thank goodness--they were the best actors in that one) this story introduces us to their new neighbor Lisa, her ex-boyfriend David, and his new girlfriend, along with the neighbor's niece and her friend. You know from the first few minutes where this story is going to go, so don't expect any dramatic twists in the plot. But to me the chemistry between Lisa and David is so much more believable than it was in the original movie's love interests. The dogs are a little more involved in the action, too, but it still isn't the kid's movie the cover photo may lead you to believe it is. Ron and Katharine befriend their neighbor who would otherwise be spending Christmas alone, and they quickly see she isn't over her ex. They do all they can to facilitate a reconciliation, but their dog seems to have more influential, if not subtle, methods. However there is a complication--David just got engaged to someone else.
There is humor, romance, some drama and even a subtle nod to Santa in the form of David's rotund landlord with a jolly laugh. But don't expect any snowy sleigh rides or winter wonderlands. This is set in a beach town somewhere in Florida.
I did notice that there is repeated casual use of the Lord's name and several common swear words popping up in conversations. That was disappointing.
You don't have to have seen the first movie to make sense of this one. I personally felt the acting in this one overall was a notch up from the first movie. The fiancee is played with a bit of caricature, but just enough to be funny without being over the top. I think it would be a pleasant escape, if you aren't bothered by the swearing. I would like to have been able to give each movie 3 1/2 stars instead of 4. This one would be because of the language and the other movie would get the half star lower due to what I felt was the lack of chemistry between the leads.
ETA: Another reviewer mentions the portrayal of a ""sexual encounter in bed"" that is interrupted and causes the man involved to swear. This puzzled me and I had to scan through the movie and see if I had really missed such a scene. I think I found it. Rod is sitting on their bed because he has just injured his knee in a game of basketball with David. He is fully dressed and his knee is in a brace. Katherine brings a bag of ice to put on it. She sits beside him on the edge of the bed and they talk about many things, including the fact that the doctor told Rod he is never to play basketball again. Katherine says he will have to get his exercise in other ways. She reaches over and turns out the bedside lamp as she begins kissing him. They start to lay across the bed and Rod does swear because his knee hurts and they sit back up.",1322956800,20,2888,4.340110905730129
4692516,5,B005GP7EYE,"Just what we needed .. a relaxed comedy romance with the flavor of the holiday season.  Loved the work by all performers...even Santa the plummer was a nice touch.... and the dogs were good stuff as well.
Never saw the first Golden Christmas..just lucked out with this one and could not be more pleased.
Well Done and Thanks

4692517,5,B005GP7EYE,"I'm stunned anyone would think the first ""Golden Christmas"" is better. Stunned. That's straight up crazy talk! Just nuts to even say that. Makes no sense. NONE.
This movie is, without question, leaps and bounds superior to the first one. Better in every sense. Top to bottom.  We get better acting, better direction, better music -- I can go on and on.
There is a lot of heart, a lot of humor and there are puppies.
Yes, this really isn't a sequel and that's okay. ""A Golden Christmas 2"" is more of a spin off as it follows Rod and Katherine in their retirement to a nameless beach town, where they meet all new characters during Christmas. What we get is a movie about three generations of love stories. An older couple (Rod and Katherine), a young couple and two kids experiencing puppy love.
You will really enjoy this movie, the whole family will, regardless of any insane reviews to the contrary.",1322524800,,901,4.561728395061729
4692518,2,B005GP7EYE,"A Golden Christmas 2 is really not a very good movie.  Its only connection to the original are the parents and the golden retriever they own.  My wife and I both fell asleep during our first two attempts to watch the film.  The story is a best choppy and doesn't flow very well.  The puppies are cute and the little girl who plays Lisa's niece does an admirable job in a dull movie.  I am being generous by giving this film two stars.  I cannot recommend the purchase of this DVD.  I really wanted to like this film as much as I did the original, but now I'm sorry I bought it.  It is much cheaper than a sleeping pill, but just as effective.",1322352000,,642,4.120967741935484
4692519,3,B005GP7EYE,Funny and good but a drawn-out romance.  Based on the cover it looks like a good kid movie about dogs but we were surprised at the long romance scenes.,1321574400,,151,4.206896551724138
4692520,5,B005GP7EYE,"Liked this movie even better than the first ""Golden Christmas"" because the two lead characters (played by Julie Gonzalo and K. C. Clyde) really look like they have genuine feelings for each other on screen.  This is a wholesome Christmas story that is romantic, and entertaining on multi-generational levels.  There is the young ex-couple (Clyde and Gonzalo) wondering why they didn't follow through with their instincts to marry when they were dating previously.  There is the older couple (played by veterans Alley Mills and Bruce Davison, who were in the prequel), that befriends the younger couple and gives them wise advice from the perspective of their own happy 40-year marriage.  And there is the beginning of another relationship between the two youngest characters (played by Gattlin Griffith and Alex Peters).  Will Clyde rush into a marriage to the wrong woman (played by Kelly Stables) for the sake of being married?  The golden retrievers play a supporting role throughout the story, and just seem to know what's best for their human owners.  Really enjoyable movie!",1321401600,6,1080,5.172413793103448

4692572,5,B005GP7EYE,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Golden Christmas 2: The Second Tail was really quite clean.  I think there were a few swear words (mostly by a 11 or 12 year old girl, which was completely unnecessary to have a child do), several low cut shirts/dresses and a few scenes of people drinking.  I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch it again and like it a lot better than the first one. Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".

Rod and Katherine, the parents in the first movie, move to Florida with their dog Jake.  But Rod is bored with nothing to do, and Katherine misses her kids back home, especially with Christmas right around the corner. However, Rod has made friends with a boy named David who plays basketball with him and Katherine has made friends with her new neighbor, Lisa, who has three puppies herself: Mario, Luigi and Pasquale. When Jake and the puppies take off during a walk with Lisa, they interrupt a wedding proposal.  Lisa is mortified to find out that the man that Jake just jumped on is David (her childhood friend / ex-boyfriend.  Everyone can see that David and Lisa are meant to be together, except David and Lisa. Jake does his best to throw them together as often as he can, but with David's wedding approaching, now that he has met Lisa again, they both are wondering if they are better off apart or together, and to give their love a second chance.

Overall, I loved the movie and will watch it again.",1379548800,,1643,4.438538205980066

4692591,4,B005GP7EYE,"The story is a typical predictable lighthearted plot of two former lovers getting back together after one is going to get married to someone else while the other enters the picture to change the course of things.  The golden retrievers are all very cute!  What I also really liked was at about 11:30 into the DVD, there are a couple young ladies walking in bikinis, and the one wearing the pink/purple one has a very nice wiggle to her walk!  Wow!  The movie was filmed in southern California, so that is very expected.  No complaints here!  Both the goldens and the bikini backside made me rate this movie a 4-star instead of a 3-star.",1357776000,,636,4.535087719298246

4692595,5,B005GP7EYE,Another adorable love and Christmas story with dogs to help the storyline. I loved that it's a sequel keeping Bruce Davison and Alley Mills from the first movie.

I fell asleep a couple of times during the movie. The first one rocked! I wanted to see Andrea Roth, and Nicholas Brendon in part two. I was so disappointed! I figured the director would create a wedding, and a story revolving around them instead of the parents moving to Florida. Perhaps, another sequel will come out with the entire family included. The Golden Retriever was the best part of the movie. In Golden Christmas part 1 - Chasity Dotson (is a poor actress in my opinion).",1324080000,,670,5.979166666666667
4692600,3,B005GP7EYE,"I'm not a very good critic, not sure to blame the director or the script. There was some good acting, some great acting, and some not so good acting. The main problem I had with the film, was that it just wasn't believable. The dog knocks over an engagement ring in a closed case, and the ring falls out and falls down the sink.... The director had a chance to really end up with a bang, but the final engagement scene was a real dud. But...the dogs were cute, so I gave it three stars instead of the two it deserved.",1323129600,,517,4.128712871287129
