Full of great content, professors that don't drone on and on monotone, and helpful photos, diagrams, etc.  it's all the fun stuff of a college course, without the tests or notetaking.  I used to watch Modern Marvels and How It's Made, but those programs aren't produced anymore.  The Great Courses are wonderful for continuing to fill the mind with stuff about how the world worked in the past and works today.",1517443200,,451,4.894736842105263
