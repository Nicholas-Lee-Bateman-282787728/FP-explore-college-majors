8660498,3,B00KOW4AP0,Honestly not my type of movie. I guess people being at a refugee camp was eye opening but their wasn't much a plot to it. Just not my type of movie.,1437350400,,148,3.806451612903226

8660500,1,B00KOW4AP0,"Jews have been living in their homeland for 4000 years, 2000 years before Lord Jesus.  Mahamud came and died 600 years or so after Our Lord.  Israel belongs to the Jews.  When the Arab Empire attacked the newly recognized Jewish state in 1948, 400,000 Palestinian Arabs VOLUNTARILY left with hopes to return post-war to kill any Jewish survivors.  The Arabs who stayed became voting citizens along witht the Jews as Israel is a democracy, not beating women unlike the Arab Empire countries.  Simultaneously, 800,000 Jews were forcibly evicted from the Arab Empire.  Rather than giving the stolen Jewish homes to their fellow Arabs, the Arab Empire chose to make them live as outcasts.

Israel reasonably refuses to recognize the Arab Palestinians as having their own country as the Arab Palestinian leaders insist on putting in their country charter that they intend to murder Jewish Palestinians living in Israel despite the centuries of Jews living their long before Mahumed was born.  Arab Palestinians are victims not of Israel but of their ancestors decision to voluntarily emmigrate and the Arab Empire refusal to embrace them in contra-distinction to Israel embracing the forcibly evicted Jews from the Arab Empire  and the evil criminal hatred of AraFAT and the other terrorist leaders elected by the Arab Palestinians.  When they drop the hate and terrorism, they will get their country.  Jesus and the other Jews were in Palestine 1000's of years before Mahumed was even born!  The land is Jewish.  The Arab Palestinians would still be there if they did not choose to leave, hoping to kill any Jews surviving the 1948 initiated Arab attack of Israel.  Fine to feel bad for Palestinian Arabs for what their fellow Arabs did to them, but not fair/decent/honest to blame Israel.",1425513600,2,1785,5.047781569965871
8660501,5,B00KOW4AP0,"This is beautifully filmed and acted. In particular I loved the music. However, my problem with this movie is that it is trying too hard to be politically correct and to portray members of Fatah ""in all their humanity"". I don't believe that this type of image building really serves the Palestinian cause as much as the simple and moving way the film flows. The protagonist is charming and a great actor. It is my belief, mistaken perhaps, that resistance is more powerful when it is cultural than when it comes from the barrel of a gun. And culture is the one weakness of the Israeli cultural self-image that Palestinians might be able to use.",1419638400,4,644,4.608695652173913
8660502,5,B00KOW4AP0,"A sweet and poignant movie about the struggle of the Palestinian people presented through the eyes of a young boy.  It is always too easy to dehumanize the slow death and genocide of a people when you are disconnected from them and don't understand their cause.  This movie attempts to gently confront a cause for a people that are now without a country to call their own.  Regardless of your political affiliation(s), you cannot deny the sadness that envelopes this young protagonist and his mother.  Definitely a must see movie!",1415404800,6,530,4.855555555555555
8660503,4,B00KOW4AP0,This movie was great though I would've loved to have seen more about life at the actual refugee camp and I wish the ending didn't leave me yearning for more!,1412467200,4,157,4.266666666666667
8660504,4,B00KOW4AP0,"Set in 1967 we meet Tarek who has been forced to flee Palestine due to the ongoing war. He is in the Harir refugee camp in Jordan with his mother. They have been separated from his beloved father who has stayed behind to fight the invader i.e. Israel.

He is gifted at maths but suffers from dyslexia which makes him unpopular at school. He is going stir crazy in the camp and so decides to go home. He seems to have no grasp on reality when it comes to the dangers of the situation and has that boldness that only youth can bring to all situations. Once his mind is made up there is no stopping him.

There is a lot here to like, the representations of the fledgling Palestine Liberation front are all done with an understated understanding of the historical context, the Israelis are not represented as horned devils and are only really alluded to. The mother of Tarek gets to show the most of her acting abilities by the sheer range of emotions she has to deal with. The whole film has high production values and a genuine warmth for the most part - the ending has been criticised, but to say why would be a massive plot spoiler - and I think it is down to taste. It is in Arabic and English with good subtitles. This is very nearly a five star but because of the issues mentioned above it gets a four - recommended.",1410566400,6,1319,4.272
8660505,5,B00KOW4AP0,"I just saw it and I would highly recommend it.  Mahmoud Asaf is extraordinary in portraying the boy in the refugee camp who longs to find his father back home.  In the role the boy is very precocious and the young actor brings many laughs with his fearless command of situations.  It shows the desperation and terrible injustice of life as a refugee.  Though it ends on a potentially hopeful note, some might quibble and demand a decisive happy ending.  But in the conclusion chosen, the  film accurately portrays the situation in which Palestinians now live--many now understand their plight but most know that obstacles to relief, even apartheid walls, are not likely to fall tomorrow.",1402963200,8,687,4.879310344827586
