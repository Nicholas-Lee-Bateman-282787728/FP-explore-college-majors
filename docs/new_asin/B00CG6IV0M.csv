8581534,5,B00CG6IV0M,"This may be the most intense, package of instrumental prowess since...since... Ok. Maybe ever. This is Dream Theater for funk. Gary Husband is a monster. Jakko Jakszyk goes from Holdsworth legato to neck snapping funk all night. Mike Lindup is a genre creating keyboard player. Oh yeah... and then there's Mark. I've followed his playing for over 20 years and this is his best yet. His stamina makes your heart race. I know all these bass parts by heart and yet i STILL get funk-face every time. So funky. So tasty. Oh yeah... he sings while doing all this. Unbelievable. if you love funk, instrumental virtuosity, great songs, great arrangements and great vocal arrangements this may be the jewel of your collection. I have over 40 concert DVD's and this will most likely replace Dream Theater Live at Budokan as being the best.",1462924800,,829,4.804195804195804
8581535,2,B00CG6IV0M,Really hard to give it good rating as looks like was simply copied from vhs source with no menus or chapter skips.shame on manufacturer and all involved. As per the performamce classic level 42 from 90s era worth the buy for the real fans.i may re encode it with my own menus and chapter skips.,1429142400,,294,4.363636363636363
8581536,3,B00CG6IV0M,"Buyer beware: The picture is grainy and stretched (i.e., they didn't reformat the aspect ratio), the sound is subpar, and there's no menu or ability to select the audio output, songs, etc. It seems to me that they simply took a VHS tape and are reselling it in DVD format. This band deserves better, especially since ""Guaranteed"" is one of their best releases and this show sold out wherever it was performed worldwide.",1391731200,4,419,4.7534246575342465
8581537,5,B00CG6IV0M,"If you are a fan of Level 42 this is a great DVD.  Mark King is a great bass player and singer.  Though this is not all of the original band,  this is really great.",1379808000,,164,3.6285714285714286
