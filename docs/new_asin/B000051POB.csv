7929580,5,B000051POB,"It's one of these movies.....just an amazing script really.....there is that doctor which in the first place discovers the virus.....the captain wants to get her of the job cos he obviously wants everybody to die....but she won't let go....oh no sir....she's on holiday but she doesn't mind.....ok so far so good......30 seconds later she telephones with some dude from the army who actually analysed blood samples she sent him.....the army boss dude tells her that she should take care of that obvious deadly virus on the ship...actually already 3 people died....our heroin then complains that she's on holiday an that she'd prefer not to care bout business....I mean...what could be more logic....she made a fuss and eventually everybody is probably gonna die but our heroin doesn't care no more now and wants to have a good time on the cruise....she is on holiday right.....it's very realistic.....wow.....an the title of the movie is promising......""voyage of terror""....yeahhh.....then there's some sort of political plot adding up.....and the soundtrack is great too......as soon as it gets thrilling there comes up the same 4 bars of dramatic piano whatsoever music sort of a thing.....sound pretty much like one kids-keyboard did all the job by himself.......
Then the acting is....well I had the time of my life....it's overacting all over....pretty lame indeed.....when I saw the movie first I actually zapped in whilst the movie was already in the middle....at first I thought it was some sort of comedy like ""Airplane"".......so if you want to see a great comedy...go for it...it's a 5 stars comedy without any doubt.",1422748800,,1628,5.241379310344827
