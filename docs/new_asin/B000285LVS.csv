8023429,1,B000285LVS,"The DVDs started locking up and completely wrong or misaligned audio.  Came in a ridiculous built out cardboard container.  We were able to see the first movie on each disc and get into the second before it started locking up.  One one disc the dialog for one movie was on another after first being way off in the second movie.  I had never seen that before. WTH happened in the transfer to this DVD set?  Bad machines, human error or both.",1506729600,,440,4.382716049382716
