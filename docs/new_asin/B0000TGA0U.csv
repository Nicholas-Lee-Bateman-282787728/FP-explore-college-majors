1943206,5,B0000TGA0U,"I've watched many of the episodes of Sex and The City since it's beginning.  I realize it's the kind of show that people either love or hate.  Being close to being a ""middle-aged, unappealing, but wiser"" woman, as one 20 year old boy in a previous review described it, I also know that, hey, there's a lot of real life here in this show, all tossed in amongst the Manolo Blahniks (kind of like the interest football holds for men, silly perhaps, but still a passion for many) and some of the wilder antics of someone like Samantha (isn't she the perfect feminine reflection of the supreme macho male?...what fun!).  Let us remember that these ladies live in a very sophisticated city, New York (perhaps a little more up-to-date than even good old Baton Rouge can purport to be) and are basically just trying to be content, enjoy life, have some fabulous sex, and follow their own paths in order to be true to themselves and their histories.  The fact that in the meantime these characters entertain us, remind us of our foibles and vulnerabilities, and pursue their own happiness no matter what anyone thinks seems to rankle quite a few men I know, and even a couple of rather uptight women.  I can't help, then, but to respond to the boy from Baton Rouge, who I am sure considers himself very intelligent and may even be a high school graduate...after all, no average young man could have thought up the concept of calling the characters Cory, Corvette, Mirabel, and Semolina, not to mention Tom and Jerry. All I can say is, life leads you places you may never think, in your youthful arrogance, you would go, and I imagine that at 35 to 45, you may be a rather ""middle-aged and unappealing"", and may I say, bitter and unloved little old man in your own right.  Now you are still young, and already you haven't got a stitch of tolerance or fun in you (that very thinly veiled angry imitation thereof aside). Imagine yourself twenty years from now...nowhere near as hopeful and brave as the girls from Sex and the City, in their ""tottering old age"" are, I'll bet.  By the way, I'm 30, ancient by your standards, I'm sure, and happily single.  From my viewpoint here on the path to being a crone, may I pass back to you some of my hard-earned wisdom...never be so absolutely smug about anything, because life loves giving you a kick in the chops, just to let you know who's boss.
All that aside, I think this show is hilarious and gender-bending, and catches you when you aren't really paying attention with a real-life hook, and also, it's just great ""don't have to think TOO hard fun"".  I'm in!",1077580800,10,2595,4.539614561027837

I just finished watching Episode #89 last night titled: Catch-38, and I'm waiting for all the upcoming episodes, they are scheduled to end February 22, 2004...so I'll be keeping my eyes open for the 6th Season DVD! Here's a brief description for those of you dying to know what's going on in the show:
Episode 90 - Out Of The Frying Pan
January 25, 2004
Carrie is challenged by Aleksandr's preference for strong coffee; Charlotte runs to escape the pain of not having a child; Miranda emphasizes Brady's needs; Samantha gets a new hairstyle.
This show is just incredible. It keeps you guessing with all of the intriguing and beautiful characters! It talks about all the things you thought you would never hear anyone ever say on a half hour series! These women are smart! Funny! And Incredibly Sexy. This is a Must-See DVD Pack. Enjoy...and look for sales!...here is a link to a really neat article telling all about  what's going to happen in Sex And The City....... ...",1074470400,8,1029,4.653846153846154
1943229,5,B0000TGA0U,"Since Sex and the City premiered, it's become a cult classic amongst American women- and even some men.  This set is complete, and much more affordable than buying each video separately. I recieved the set as a Christmas gift, and did a SATC binge between December and January, and I realized how wonderful the series is when watched a whole, instead of having to wait several months for a new season.  When watched consecutively, the series seems like a real, romantic dramedy film.  While the features on the set are a bit sparse, the commentary really is a pretty entertaining and insightful, and not drawn out or boring, especially since each episode is only 30 minutes. Buy the set, and indulge in the joy that is SATC for years to come.",1108425600,2,742,4.648854961832061
1943230,5,B0000TGA0U,"This complete set has a very good value. If you purchased each one individually with shipping it will be more expensive than buying the set. If you were to buy them all at once individually with the Super Saving Shipper the box set is still a few cents cheaper. Also, buying the set at amazon.com is way cheaper than anywhere else.  All in all this is a very good value. No you are going to be ripped off or have another way to save money. This is the way to go.",1102464000,2,462,4.076923076923077
1943231,5,B0000TGA0U,This dvd set is great!!! It is well worth the money to purchase the whole set. I can't wait for Season 6 part 2.,1099440000,3,112,3.7083333333333335
1943232,5,B0000TGA0U,"Since the moment I put in the First Season of SATC in my DVD player, my boyfriend and I basically made it ""our"" show.  Though my boyfriend really never got in to nor had the time to watch any SATC, he was hooked after the first episode.  Little over a month after receiving the boxed set of Seasons 1-5 and Season 6, Part 1....  we are on Season 6, Disc 2.  We are anxiously anticipating the release of Season Six Part 2!!!",1094515200,2,423,4.121951219512195
1943233,5,B0000TGA0U,"but better late than never!  Believe it or not, my husband actually got me interested in this spectacular series.  I can't remember which episode I watched first but I remember laughing out loud and deciding that I simply had to see every last episode of SATC.

Up to this point, I still haven't seen all the episodes, and I missed most of Seasons 3, 4, 5, & 6.  So, despite the price tag, although not really that bad but all at once it's a lot of money for me to part with, I finally ordered all five seasons, and as soon as season 6 pt. 2 comes out, I'll order that season as well.

I love every one of these women and I love watching their adventures over and over, which is why I'm breaking down and buying all the seasons.  I've been watching this fabulous show on TBS, and until I get my dvds, I'll have to live with the commercial interupted, racyless version, but I suffer through it because it's still a great show even after it's been butchered.",1092528000,4,956,4.254143646408839

And this offer right here at amazon is really good because they are incluiding the 6th season part 1, and most of the packages out there don't, and cost alot more.

I already own all the seasons and watch them whenever I am bored or sad and they really cheer me up.",1092355200,5,372,4.152777777777778
1943235,5,B0000TGA0U,"I only started watching 'Sex and the City' this year, because I don't get HBO (unfortunately). But now, even if you, too, don't have the station, you can still watch this phenomenal show! I loved every moment of every episode, and being able to have it on DVD makes the show not only addicting because you can watch episode after episode, but also very alluring that you can watch it whenever you want!

The show is smartly written, and even if you don't enjoy the actual scenes with sex in them, you will surely appreciate the comical ocurrences in each one of the girls' lives. The script is real, and at times surprising, but surely is not to be missed!

If you haven't already seen 'Sex and the City,' now is the time! Why not watch it all at once instead of watching edited versions on basic cable?!",1091750400,6,804,4.425675675675675

1943237,5,B0000TGA0U,"i did the math, and for US buyers at amazon.com, the set saves you money (compared to all the seasons separately or 1-5 boxed + 6 part one).  This product deserves a much higher rating than what is has!  SATC is the best, and this DVD set illustrates just that.",1090281600,3,261,4.2

1943250,5,B0000TGA0U,"This past Christmas I treated myself and bought all five DVDs because I had to catch up. (Especially since the show was ending in February)  I had to watch every single episode one by one and it didn't seem like a long time and I loved every single minute of it.  So a lot of unanswered questions were answered. I'm very proud of my collection, I can't wait to receive season 6, part 1 in the mail and can't wait until season 6, part 2 come out.  Plus the DVDs have audio commentaries from Michael Patrick King, the executive producer.  That is one extra that I love to death.  Because he explains so much in certain episodes.  I wish he had done it for every single episode, but it probably would have cost a little more. So the SEX IN THE COLLECTION was worth evey dime.",1084838400,,772,4.2534246575342465
1943251,5,B0000TGA0U,"this show is amazing. that is all there is to say. its clever and smart and funny, you won't want to stop watching it. Exploring the world through carrie bradshaws eyes and seeing the way of life of these upper east side women. i reccomend this to anyone and everyone.",1080864000,2,268,4.38
1943252,5,B0000TGA0U,"What can I say - Sex & The City speaks for itself.  You can't fail to love the show, and you can't watch it too many times.  It's incredible to see the progress of the show throughout the series and how much the characters deepen and develop, to the point where you feel as if you know and care about each one of them. It's got the feelgood moments, the weepy moments, the hilarious moments and those cringeful moments we can all relate to!
Extras on the DVDs are sometimes wonderful (e.g. commentry by Michael Patrick King - just on a few episodes) and sometimes disappointing (e.g. hackneyed information about the achievements of the cast members).  But nevertheless I had to give it 5 stars for making me very happy for a very long time!",1079654400,3,740,4.466666666666667
1943253,5,B0000TGA0U,"I should start by confessing that I came to watch SATC very late in the game - not until the start of the 6th Season.  After watching the final episode, the decision to buy the complete season DVDs was a no-brainer, and I have not been disappointed.  The writing on this show is some of the smartest I've encountered in a long time.  It has been interesting and highly entertaining to watch these characters evolve.  (The 5th Season may be short, but the writing quality never wavers.)  I'll watch one episode thinking I that can really relate to Charlotte, only to relate to Miranda, Carrie or (heaven forbid!) Samantha in the next.  And it really isn't just about sex - or the city - but ultimately about the joy and heartbreak in all of life, such as the loss of a parent or dealing with an unexpected pregnancy.
Of course, most of the funniest bits deal with the search for ""the one"" - something everyone can relate to.  I think the decision to end after 6 seasons - and on a positive note for all characters - was a smart one.  It may have taken Big six seasons to realize Carrie was ""the one"" but the journey made the result more worthwhile.  (Here again, I must confess that prior to seeing the earlier seasons, I was not entirely convinced that Carrie and Big should live happily ever after.  Mr. Big now gets my full endorsement!)
I highly recommend this boxed set (instead of the watered down syndication version being contemplated on other cable channels), and have already pre-ordred Season Six, Part One.  Those concerned with what they perceive to HBO price gouging should consider that an individual season on DVD still costs less than one month of cable service...  And if, like me, the only reason you're watching HBO is SATC (and maybe The Sopranos) perhaps it's better just to cancel HBO and get the DVDs instead!",1079395200,20,1832,4.568807339449541

1943255,5,B0000TGA0U,"I have been watching Sex and the city since it first came on HBO in 98, I love this show and the price for the five set is wonderful. This show was such a great thing to happen, it is time women were also allowed to be sexual and outspoken. I have to say I couldn't even pick a favorite out of the women they are strong, independent and beautiful. The season finale was amazing I won't go into detail but lets just say it couldn't have been any better. It is sad to see our favorite New Yorkers go but it was going to happen sometime, I think the show has just got better every season. Mr Big is hot.",1078617600,4,600,3.9669421487603307

I bought the 5 season pack, it took me 7 days, to watch every episode. I was hooked, aside from watching the finale, sunday. It just felt so good. The episodes, seasons were great. I can't believe so many people were unhappy with season5. If anything, season one was a rocky start, but still great. I really enjoyed them, and I am defiently getting six in May. This show is just so moving. 5 Stars!",1077840000,,558,4.375
1943258,3,B0000TGA0U,"When this series started, it was quirky, funny and different. The sexual candor was startling but riveting. In the back of your mind, as with the Seinfeld characters, you perhaps had one qualm, namely about how this was a bit horrific after all. The constant refrain that this was about real women and how they really acted and spoke was kinda scary, and enough to keep some men bachelors forever. Did Princess Charlotte, convinced in fairy tales, make an attractive mate? Or maybe man-averse, chip-on-her-shoulder Miranda? Or slutty Samantha? Carrie seemed the normal one, but as time went on we discovered that she had a Peter Pan complex--inability to commit, setting the bar too high for unrealistic reasons. She dumped Aidan for no reason. In the finale (not on this set), she agrees to accompany Mihail to Paris knowing that he has his most important exhibition of the latter part of his career, a make or break exhibit. She whines constantly about him working rather that squiring her around, even though he's under tremendous stress and she knew he'd have to work.  He's such a cad--free trip to Paris for her, wander around and have fun, while he works desperately to save his career. What an awful guy--according to Carrie. In Carrie's little faux-feminist world, her Self has been vindicated. Others might wonder...why bother? When you see a Carrie coming, run hard and fast in the other direction if you're a single man. As this series wears on, it grates more and more and becomes less and less funny. Samantha suddenly becomes a lesbian? SAMANTHA? C'mon. The last two years of the series were little but tedious as it ran out of steam. But there's good news on this set: all of the early seasons are here and they are hilariously funny, well acted, and exuberant in their vitality. As the set wears on, you may become less thrilled as the edge wears off and turns into reality, but...enjoy the glory years. P.s. I see few people think this helpful. I guess in the world of true fanatics, a word of criticism or two is not acceptable. Blind enthusiasm only is allowed. The simple truth is that this series went wayyyy downhill and lost its way as time went on.",1077580800,,2173,4.718421052631579

There are many asking for a blu ray version of SATC and the reason is that the quality of the DVDs 2004 DVDs stink.  The video quality of the first four years are mediocre at best.  I haven't previewed season 5 and 6.  SATC the first movie DVD quality is good.

Unfortunately, converting to Blu Ray does not guarantee better quality.

The plastic trifold cases are a joke and came apart with age and time. The seams age and break just setting on the shelf.  The buttons that hold the disk in the case are about 50% missing. Mine are duct-taped together and disks taped into the cases.  Cheap, cheap, cheap.
