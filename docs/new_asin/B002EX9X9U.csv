The image is still a bit softer than optimal, but for now, it serves us quite nicely, and I'm happy to have it, especially as it so vividly preserves the ferocious performance of Raizo Ichikawa as the avenging son of the Taira Clan's  deeply revered leader. It seems almost greedy to hope for a more detailed visual presentation in light of the genuine felicities contained herewithin. This is, at this point, a most desirable choice for classic Japanese film enthusiasts, and a must for the Mizoguchi-ite.",1393286400,,613,4.783018867924528
