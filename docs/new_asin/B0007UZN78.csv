8052061,5,B0007UZN78,"I studied with Mr. Joe Lewis and this instruction is like having him right there in fornt of you. It captures his power and person. He was a master and a teacher. He was good, fast and so confident.  When I was a lad he was a powerhouse and a master at karate. His Karate was the best. In the ring, in the Dojo and the Seminar circuit he was great. He could attack with such conviction. Insdie figthing is a tuff subject. Many don't go there.  He shares his knowledge and experience in this DVD. A must for Karate Teachers and students. I am a teacher for 20 Years. Thanks Mr. Lewis and God bless you.",1372291200,3,601,4.128205128205129
