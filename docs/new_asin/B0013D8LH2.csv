Laughter through tears is certainly said in the movie and stands for the movie.  What fun to watch it and laugh and cry.

Both of these movies are classics in their own way: a sappy and funny love story in Sleepless in Seattle and a hilarious movie with a sad ending in Steel Magnolias.  When I need a good cry, I watch Steel Magnolias!  If these two movies are some of your favorites, I would highly recommend buying the DVD set.

3103060,5,B0013D8LH2,"At least ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is. ""Steel Magnolias"" is a lot of laughs with one really sad part - and I bet you can guess where
it came in. My favorite scene in ""Sleepless..."" (other than the final one where they meet on the roof of the Enterprise State Build-
ing just after she's gone in Noah's backpack to find out who's it is, and...) is where, earlier, Noah waves a letter from her at Sam,
his father, and says ""It's a sign!"" And Sam (before running out to see his date) tugs him over to the entry (?) wall, pulls down a
U.S. map and asks, ""Where's Seattle?"" and Noah points to it on the map. ""Where's Philadelphia?"" he asks next, and Noah
doesn't know. Sam counts out the number of states, real fast,  till he gets to about the middle of the country and says, ""*That's* a sign!"" as he rushes out the door. That always strikes me as hilarious.",1403827200,,850,4.246913580246914

3103082,4,B0013D8LH2,"Both are great love stories.  Steel Magnolias deals with the friendship of 6 women.  And, how they are always there for each other.
Sleepless in Seattle lets us know that there is someone out there for us (no matter how far).",1373328000,,225,4.463414634146342
3103083,5,B0013D8LH2,"This is surely the set to get if you are as hopeless of a romantic as me. I love Both movies! In Sleepless In Seattle, Meg Ryan plays a woman who is engaged but hears a guy venting on a radio station about the loss of his wife and just goes head over heals for him. She plays a reporter who decides to do a story about him so she can meet him. I won't spoil it for you but it is a movie worth watching. Steel Magnolias is a tear jerker. Wow. What a cast! They play a small town group of good old gals that visit the beauty parlor often. They are all friends and when tragedy strikes, they are there for each other through thick and thin. It really makes you feel like, ' what if that was me?' I love the all star cast and the movie is heart felt. Definitely worth watching.",1363737600,,773,3.929936305732484
3103084,5,B0013D8LH2,I loved both these movies.  They were fun to watch and most entertaining.  Highly recommend for relaxing evening of entertainent,1361404800,,128,5.35
3103085,5,B0013D8LH2,"Two really cute shows. SM- The strong southern women and the great acting from some of our great older actress's were so fun to watch. It brought home the power of female friendships.  SIS-  A fun little love story and of destiny.  I like Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks together.  I think I have liked them together better in some of there other movies like you got mail, but this was a fun and easy watch and I would recommend it.",1360972800,,423,4.185185185185185
3103086,5,B0013D8LH2,"I do have to say also that these are two of my favorite movies and the choice to put them in one set saves space. I LOVE Sleepless because it is such an uplifting love story which has such a happy ending. I have to admit that I've heard people talking like that on the radio or TV and thought the same thing as Meg, so I know those feelings she had. Well I never had the nerve to go 'looking for the person' like she did, which makes the movie a bit stretched, but that also makes me wonder when I had felt like that about someone (providing they were fairly easy to find), would it have worked out or not. Right up to the end, even though you know that they are going to meet, you still sit at the edge of your seat and keep yelling at Hanks to stay or do this or that...funny isn't it. And of course the ending just makes you melt in your seat.

Steel Magnolias is one of my most favorite comedies ever. The unbelievable cast is so perfect for their roles in the movie, you have to give kudos to the people that cast it. It would have been a fun movie with other people cast, but it was a GREAT movie with all those talented great actresses playing their parts to perfection. There is no one I can pick out as my absolute favorite because they all do such a great job. I have watched this movie many times and still love it as if I'm watching it for the first time. I laugh and cry exactly the same.

So yes, they put two unbelievable movies together for a change and you can't go wrong with this investment, you will get more of your money back rewatching them than what you spent on it. My only question is, I have each one separate  and have the 'special edition' of both of them. What I'm always afraid of is buying the double and not getting the special feature I have, they don't tell you here if there are any. And if they don't come with as many special features, why would I want to get rid of my separate discs just to have them together than separate. It does matter to me with these two movies...most don't, I just get the double.

I would say if you don't have either movie or just have one, to get this because it will cost the same as getting one of the other movies. I would just like to say that since they are separate discs, if they didn't put all the extras on them, then it is a shame because I loved the commentary by the director on Sleepless plus the videos of the songs of the movies on the disc...",1357689600,,2425,4.056367432150314

Sleepless in Seattle lets us know that there is someone out there for us (no matter how far).",1373328000,,225,4.463414634146342
3337580,5,B0013D8LH2,"This is surely the set to get if you are as hopeless of a romantic as me. I love Both movies! In Sleepless In Seattle, Meg Ryan plays a woman who is engaged but hears a guy venting on a radio station about the loss of his wife and just goes head over heals for him. She plays a reporter who decides to do a story about him so she can meet him. I won't spoil it for you but it is a movie worth watching. Steel Magnolias is a tear jerker. Wow. What a cast! They play a small town group of good old gals that visit the beauty parlor often. They are all friends and when tragedy strikes, they are there for each other through thick and thin. It really makes you feel like, ' what if that was me?' I love the all star cast and the movie is heart felt. Definitely worth watching.",1363737600,,773,3.929936305732484
3337581,5,B0013D8LH2,I loved both these movies.  They were fun to watch and most entertaining.  Highly recommend for relaxing evening of entertainent,1361404800,,128,5.35
3337582,5,B0013D8LH2,"Two really cute shows. SM- The strong southern women and the great acting from some of our great older actress's were so fun to watch. It brought home the power of female friendships.  SIS-  A fun little love story and of destiny.  I like Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks together.  I think I have liked them together better in some of there other movies like you got mail, but this was a fun and easy watch and I would recommend it.",1360972800,,423,4.185185185185185
3337583,5,B0013D8LH2,"I do have to say also that these are two of my favorite movies and the choice to put them in one set saves space. I LOVE Sleepless because it is such an uplifting love story which has such a happy ending. I have to admit that I've heard people talking like that on the radio or TV and thought the same thing as Meg, so I know those feelings she had. Well I never had the nerve to go 'looking for the person' like she did, which makes the movie a bit stretched, but that also makes me wonder when I had felt like that about someone (providing they were fairly easy to find), would it have worked out or not. Right up to the end, even though you know that they are going to meet, you still sit at the edge of your seat and keep yelling at Hanks to stay or do this or that...funny isn't it. And of course the ending just makes you melt in your seat.

Steel Magnolias is one of my most favorite comedies ever. The unbelievable cast is so perfect for their roles in the movie, you have to give kudos to the people that cast it. It would have been a fun movie with other people cast, but it was a GREAT movie with all those talented great actresses playing their parts to perfection. There is no one I can pick out as my absolute favorite because they all do such a great job. I have watched this movie many times and still love it as if I'm watching it for the first time. I laugh and cry exactly the same.

So yes, they put two unbelievable movies together for a change and you can't go wrong with this investment, you will get more of your money back rewatching them than what you spent on it. My only question is, I have each one separate  and have the 'special edition' of both of them. What I'm always afraid of is buying the double and not getting the special feature I have, they don't tell you here if there are any. And if they don't come with as many special features, why would I want to get rid of my separate discs just to have them together than separate. It does matter to me with these two movies...most don't, I just get the double.

I would say if you don't have either movie or just have one, to get this because it will cost the same as getting one of the other movies. I would just like to say that since they are separate discs, if they didn't put all the extras on them, then it is a shame because I loved the commentary by the director on Sleepless plus the videos of the songs of the movies on the disc...",1357689600,,2425,4.056367432150314
