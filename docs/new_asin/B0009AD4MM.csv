8058875,4,B0009AD4MM,"Airport 1975 may not be 100% as entertaining as its predecessor, Airport, but it remains a pretty good thriller at any rate. It all held my attention every step of the way; there's plenty of suspense and great acting! The casting was well done; and the choreography and cinematography both reflect good forethought. True, the musical score essentially just tells you how to feel; but Helen Reddy gets in a good number as she sings and plays guitar very well! In addition, some people say that this is a campy movie with a plot that relies upon many clichs and soap-opera style melodramatic relationships; and I think they are right. It's possible, however, that at the time the filmmakers thought they were making something more serious--but at any rate, it's still pretty good entertainment.

When the action starts (and there's lots of action), we quickly meet the principle characters of the story. There's 747 ace pilot Alan Murdock (Charlton Heston) and his flight attendant girlfriend (they called them stewardesses back then) Nancy Pryor (Karen Black) who have had a stormy affair for the last six years without commitment much to Nancy's chagrin; and George Kennedy reprises his Airport role of Joe Patroni, an ace at airport troubleshooting and a fine pilot in his own right. Although Nancy wants to spend time talking with Alan to save their failing relationship, she must serve on a red eye special with Captain Stacy (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) at the controls. Moreover, Alan doesn't seem all that interested in talking with Nancy--he'd rather be alone with her instead.

To flesh out the plot, the flight is full of passengers with their own problems and situations in life; there's the aging actress Gloria Swanson (playing herself) who's working on her memoirs with her assistant; men looking for fun and women (look for Jerry Stiller as Sam and Norman Fell as Bill); Joe Patroni's wife Helen (Susan Clark) and son Joe Patroni, Jr. (Brian Morrison); and a young girl Janice Abbott (Linda Blair) is also on board with her mother (Nancy Olson). Janice is being rushed to a hospital for a life-saving kidney transplant. There are also two nuns, Sister Beatrice (Martha Scott) and Sister Ruth (Helen Reddy); and Sid Caesar plays Barney while Myrna Loy plays Mrs. Devaney.

Tragedy and serious trouble ensues when the pilot of a small airplane (Dana Andrews as Scott Freeman) has a fatal heart attack up in the air; and consequently his plane crashes into the jumbo 747's cockpit, making a huge hole in one side of it that immediately pulls out the co-pilot and blinds Captain Stacy.  The jumbo 747 now has nobody to fly it--and it's up to Nancy with the help of Alan on the ground to try to land the plane safely.

Of course, there's much more to the plot--but I won't add any more to avoid giving out spoilers! Suffice it to say that even if you can guess the ultimate resolution of the plot, it's not at all obvious what transpires to get to that point.

Overall, people who are fans of this film would do well to add this to their collections. In addition, people who enjoy thrillers and action and suspense will like this movie. It's also somewhat campy in retrospective so if you like campy films you will like Airport 1975, too.",1352419200,3,3240,4.776785714285714
