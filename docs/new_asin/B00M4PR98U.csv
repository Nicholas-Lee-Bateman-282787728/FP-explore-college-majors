8670313,5,B00M4PR98U,"Creeping Crawling begins by showing a woman named Allison pull up in her orange car to a man named Doug who's sitting on his front porch.  They head into a building because they have an appointment with some doctor who's nicknamed Bug Brains.  At first they talk about Allison's report on cell phones while the doctor talks about bees and how they don't like humans.  Doug says ""Oh, bees want to divorce us!""  The doctor says men and insects have reached a tipping point.  He mentions that we have eaten millions of insects in our time.  Humans are using dogs as a tool because of what they represent.  He mentions a student who entered high fashion modeling.  We now see the story behind this model- a blonde woman, going through a modeling routine with the make up and posing.  Story one begins!

A woman insults the model by calling her imperfect.  The woman does it in a way that seems like she was born to be rude.  Not even aware of it!  Another man tells the model to lose a few pounds.  When the model returns to her apartment room... she has a huge pile of junk food sitting in front of her.  Wow, that's not how you lose weight!  She chows down on pizza and chicken nuggets.  She's basically doing the complete opposite of me since I plan to starve myself today, lol.  She throws up all that food and rubs her face in the bathroom.

The model has dinner at a restaurant with her boyfriend.  More food isn't what she needs!  She reads instructions while in the restaurant bathroom on how to take weight loss pills.  She returns to the table and watches a mother tell her young daughter how to eat healthy.  This reminds the model of being a child and lectured by her father when on one occasion she took too much food to make a sandwich, and how her father would make her burn calories.  He says ""Nobody wants to marry a fat slob"".  I could make a joke here but I won't.

It seems the story has officially shifted from Allison and Doug to this model lady.  She talks about her weight issues with a friend.  The friend recommends fasting.  The model remembers more bad thoughts with her dad making her drink medicine to lose weight so she can be desirable to men and be popular at school.  ""Don't you want that?"" the father asks.  She drinks it.  In present time the model loses weight, jumps on her boyfriend and they make out.  The model and her friend visit a male fortune teller.  He touches the model's palm and says she has unresolved issues from her past.  He brings up her dad and she says he's never loved her.  The model's friend says she needs to hurry this up because... I won't say why.  It's hilariously offensive!  Even a fortune teller should be able to crack a smile over that line!  Surprised he held it together.  The fortune teller says the model has a visitor growing inside her.  It's a baby but the model insists it's a tape worm.  They argue whether it's a tape worm or baby.

The model comes home and the boyfriend's ecstatic that she's pregnant and says he's here for her even though she second guesses having a baby.  She remembers her childhood again.  She lived on a farm and used to play with her dolls in the back yard.  Her dad drove a tractor out of control and yelled for help when he accidentally ran himself over.  When his daughter appears the father tells her to run for help.  She runs down the road.

The boyfriend discovers his model girlfriend has to take medication for a tape worm, but she tells him it won't affect the baby.  She begins to have pains so the boyfriend rushes her to the bathroom toilet and calls for help.  When she suddenly screams she gives birth to... a creepy crawly?  Nah, it's intestines.  Or a long tape worm.  The boyfriend yanks it out of her and smashes it with a bottle.  Well wait!  According to the next scene it's a healthy baby the model gave birth to.  She doesn't look pleased, especially when she looks down and sees tape worms instead of her baby's face.

We now cut back to Allison, Doug and the doctor.  Allison says ""That's a horrible story!""  The doctor says there are one million ants per person on the planet.  Mosquitoes have killed more humans than every war combined.  Do you think we can live in harmony with creatures this powerful?""  The doctor starts picking on Doug by saying ""Creeping crawling insects crawl on your flesh!""  Have you ever woken up and noticed something slithering around you?""

We're now introduced to two new characters- two women.  This is story two.  They talk on the phone.  The blonde woman is a nurse.  They have drinks at a restaurant and talk about shopping, living locations and getting to know someone.  The friend recommends her nurse friend broaden her circle with a guy and she gets offended.  The nurse visits an older woman at her lovely mansion.  She says she goes away for two weeks on a convention in England.  The rest of the year she's dedicated to taking care of her son.  He's a young man now.  The woman mentions her son hit his head on a rock while goofing off and swimming with his friends.  This messed up his spine and made him paralyzed.  The nurse is here to look after the young man.

The nurse compliments how clean he looks.  The mother gives her instructions on his daily routine such as changing his catheters.  Later that night the nurse has a provocative dream she's dressed as a sexy nurse, opens the door to the mother's son bedroom and begins to rub his back with a wet sponge.  The mother walks in and says ""Don't stop now.  You're doing a wonderful job with little Timmy!""  The nurse then goes crazy and gives an intense back rub.  ""Little Timmy's not so little anymore!"" says the mother.  The nurse then peels his skin and it comes off.  She screams herself awake.  You know based on the way the mother was acting when talking with the nurse about her life and her son, I can almost see the mother having a second side to her character and acting in such a way, lol.

The next day the nurse takes care of the mother's son by flipping him over first, then cleaning his mouth after jumping on top of him.  Oh wait, the mother hasn't left yet.  She speaks to her son about bringing him many lovely things while in London.  After spending the day enjoying taking care of Timmy, the nurse wakes up that night and sees bugs all over her mattress.  She asks to sleep in Timmy's room for the night.  Of course his silence means ""Of course you can sleep in my bed you hottie you!""

The nurse gets surprised when Timmy looks at her.  She didn't think he could do that.  The next day she's paranoid bugs are crawling on the kitchen table and in her hair.  She asks the housekeeper for bug spray but she insists the house doesn't have bugs.  As cute as the nurse looks when she's enthusiastic, she turns into a nasty monster when she gets angry.  You can tell she's young.  She rubs Timmy's body and says sexual things such as ""You can't tell I have no experience can you?"" and ""You're so nice!"" while grabbing his hand.  But the bugs on Timmy's bed distract the nurse.  That night she can't sleep with bugs crawling all over her legs.  She goes crazy and sprays everywhere.  She tries to get a shower but the bugs won't stop appearing on her body.

The nurse says she feels safer with Timmy and asks if he'll protect her.  I can speak for Timmy when I say ""You bet I can protect you"".  She hugs him and he tries to speak.  He starts moving his arms and she thinks it's a miracle.  In a frenzy she calls her friend.  The nurse says Timmy's her cousin and can't move because of his spinal chord.  However he started to move and she wants her friend to reveal how to make someone move completely again.  The friend is confused.  The nurse walks into Timmy's bedroom.  Now he's standing up, talking just fine and able to please the nurse sexually.  Timmy throws her on the bed and they go to town.  Just then the nurse wakes up, lol.

The nurse tells the housekeeper she has to pick up a prescription.  She enthusiastically buys tools at the hardware store.  When the housekeeper lady leaves the nurse injects fluid into Timmy, then dresses up in a red dress.  She tells Timmy it's going to be so wonderful.  She goes crazy screaming in delight as she sprays bug spray all over the room.  Timmy wakes up and can feel his arms moving again.  He gets out of bed and says ""I knew you would save me"" before they say they love each other.  Now Timmy and the nurse make out for real- not a dream.  However the mother comes home at this very second!  When she walks into Timmy's room she sees Timmy and the nurse murdered on the floor.  Wow that must've been some intense sex!

Back to Allison, Doug and the doctor.  The doctor asks if they ever kissed someone and had the urge to take them to the ground?  He says romance is a lie and lust drives us only when we fear it.  We now see story 3.  It begins with a boy throwing rocks in a river.  We hear a funny punk song with offensive sexual lyrics about licking and well, yeah.  The song has a great beat and okay lyrics.  ""What does sex mean to me, what does sex mean to society!""  Meanwhile the boy who was throwing rocks in a river finds a dirty magazine and buries it under the garden dirt.  Well this is a smarter hiding place than the dirty pictures I had.  I thought it would be a good idea to hide MY dirty pictures... right where my parents kept their important bills.  Yeah, the next day those pictures were gone and my parents didn't say a word about it.  To be 5 years old again!

We now see a man and woman employee in an office room.  The guy wonders what's wrong with him, and why nobody can love him.  The woman says there's someone for everyone out there.  ""Take a stab in the dark and don't take it so personally!""  The male employee meets someone named Victor who wants to talk to him about his professionalism at the call center where they work.  Victor says he can access the speaker phones in the office and can hear conversations between employees.  Victor means he used to be a geek called the dirty nacho.  Victor asks the male employee if he wants... female body parts.  He compares a love for females to a positive meeting a negative and making a complete unit.  The employee... walks away from Victor's office, lol.

The female employee mentions to Victor that her male employee is a loner and is sexually frustrated and wonders if it's wise for Victor to allow this guy to seek out potential victims (women on a date).  What a weird conversation!  The female employee is weird.  Then again the male employee is a thousand times worse.  Just check out the next scene!  The male employee goes home and puts worms in a glass.  Wow, what he does with this glass of worms is just wrong.  So very very wrong.  I can't say what it is either.  It feels good for him though.

Okay maybe the female employee was right about the guy, lol.  The next day the male employee wins over a meeting and impresses the female employee and Victor.  The male employee says it's time to break out of his shell.  He feels his personality comes off as disingenuous with the ladies.  Victor says to him that he can come in late tomorrow if the date goes well.  The little boy from earlier digs his magazine back up.  He walks to his bedroom and reads it.  He... enjoys what he's reading.  He returns the magazine to the garden to bury it again.  When he picks up a second magazine he sees bugs crawling inside of it.

We now see the male employee watching smut on his computer.  He goes on a date with a woman who's a hairdresser.  She mentions that she's told all this drama and doesn't know what to do, and the awkward silence before someone comes in again.  I experience this at my local saloon so it's true!

The male employee takes his date to the woods.  She takes her clothes off and kisses all over the guy.  He dumps a glass of bugs all over her chest and laughs.  She runs away screaming ""What's wrong with you sicko?""  We now see scorpions, tarantulas and cockroaches crawling all over the man's office computer.  Apparently he didn't scare his date away since she's lying beside him in bed, but his fascination with bugs has to go.  His fascination putting bugs in glasses and applying the glass over his ""area"" has to go too.

He calls into work late while Victor is getting a... you know, from the female employee.  He says the date didn't go well but Victor says he'll set him up later tonight.  The female plops up from her dirty job and says ""Didn't you see the newspaper this morning?"" implying the male employee is a serial killer, but Victor disagrees.  She and Victor agree to follow him on his date tonight just to make sure he's not the killer.

Later that night in the car, they pull into the male employees driveway.  The female employee insists she and Victor need to dress up as ninjas with umbrellas to properly spy on the guy and watch every action through the guy's windows.  Meanwhile inside the date is going fine for the male employee.  The female employee says she's never wrong about these things, insisting the male employee is the killer.  The woman on the date says she found something downright dirty in his kitchen- a cockroach.  She knows the male employees dirty little secret and how he likes to feel their tiny little legs crawling all over him.  ""Aw how cute.  You think you're the kinkiest one here!"" she says.  They go at it in the bedroom while the girl dumps bugs all over his chest.  During sex the girl pulls out a big blade and swings it at the male employees neck, killing him.

Back with Allison, Doug and the doctor.  The doctor asks if they have everything they needed.  Allison's had enough but Doug likes the sex and wants more story!  The doctor says to think about a cicada in the ground for 12 years waiting for his freedom, never knowing which day will be his last.  Doug says ""So you're saying we're all bug poop and enjoy every day while we can?""  As Allison and Doug leave the doctor says ""Good luck adopting out there!""  As they leave Doug asks Allison to get freaky with him.  She says doing so makes her stomach quiver and drives away.  He says ""What about my booty call?""  He calls a woman about that booty call and it's the same woman from the last story who chopped up the insect loving guy's neck in bed.

This movie's pretty good I think!  Three solid stories with quality acting, and lots of interesting sexual situations.  Creeping Crawling is more about people's inner sexual thoughts than it is about gross bugs crawling around though.  The bugs are secondary.  This movie's long though, at 1 hour and 50 minutes.  Watch it!",1501804800,,14594,4.3792071802543004
8670314,3,B00M4PR98U,"""Creeping Crawling"" is a film that creates entomophobic inducing anxiety. The stories are modern distortions of today's struggle between the vapid and the devalued. The vapid being the burden and guilt put on women to live to a male standard, in return devaluing the mind, talent and whole worth of the female as a person of equal value. Okay so maybe this anthology doesn't get that deep-but that was just the impression left on me by every one of these short films.

The special effects and soundtrack are above the grade for these low budget, indie films. I was impressed. The bug thing is a real skin crawler and this film gives it a good shot. The horror isn't so much horror, in the sense that I never felt suspense or chills. The nightmare comes completely from the gross out, utter fear of insects that most of us have to some degree. ""Creeping Crawling"" is fresh, contemporary and very now.",1431475200,,899,4.61875
8670315,2,B00M4PR98U,Looked like a college film school project more than a professional effort.  Looked like it could have been made for pennies on the dollar.  Very low budget.,1414713600,,156,4.7407407407407405
8670316,1,B00M4PR98U,"CREEPING CRAWLING is another indie horror film shot with what looks like a very low budget.
Not many scares or horror. Just bugs, if those creep you out. Comprised of 3 or 4 separate stories, non of them really stood out, tied together with one of the weakest connecting story lines this side of Creepshow 2.
There was one actress who had some talent but if she intends to continue acting she needs to have her teeth capped because they were so distracting it took me out of the story trying to figure out what was up with them.
And if you're looking for Raine Brown to get naked in this, as she often does in direct to video fare, you won't find that here.
If you're looking for a bad horror anthology it's probably better to waste your time with Creepshow 2.",1413072000,,760,4.321678321678322
