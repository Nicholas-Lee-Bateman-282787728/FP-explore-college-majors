3719814,4,B001NNTGF8,"I happened to tune in the history channel a while back and got interested in this. I watched this dvd and am so pleased I bought it. When I got to sloth I decided to get up off my back side and do something productive.

3719815,1,B001NNTGF8,"I placed an order for what I thought was a Ballet with Soprano and Chorus titled The Seven Deadly Sins, by Brecht and Weill. The performance starred Theresa Stratas. What I got was some puerile pap from the History Channel. When I contacted the seller there was no offer to put things right. Needless to say, I am quite put out. As I played the disc before I realized my mistake, I am stuck. Not only that, the ordering process resulted in my receiving 2 of the things. I can send one back, but am not well enough to go to the post office. Live and learn. Carolyn Seeman",1268524800,,570,4.238532110091743
3719816,5,B001NNTGF8,"Everything History is great and this channel and every program on it I love & watch....usually with my jaw dropped through half of the episode but still haha. Every sin depicted in the show is substantiated by the so many scholors & official people who are speaking of the way it is and the way it was. I ALSO RECOMMEND ""Ancient Aliens"" by The History Channel... I bought that one DIRECTLY.. It will amaze and shock you people who 'barely' know.",1262476800,,445,4.506172839506172
3719817,1,B001NNTGF8,"The History Channel should be ashamed of this production because it is fraught with falsehoods.

For example, it claims that the ""Christian Church"" considers all human sexual acts as ""lust."" According to the History Channel, this alleged viewpoint brought about the ""dark ages."" In fact, the Church condemns lust because it is a vice by which one person abuses another as a sexual object, but the Church also teaches that within a loving marriage sexual acts are sanctifying. See sections 1601-1658 in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which includes relevant citations.

In this series, the History Channel also claims that there are no descriptions of hell in the Bible and the only descriptions come from the novelist Dante. Yet Christ describes hell in Matthew 13; Mark 9; and Luke 16, to name just a few places in the Bible. Revelation 20 is stunning...and there are more.

These are only two major errors in the series and there isn't enough space to name them all. So the producers and History Channel network execs are either incompetent or they disregard truth. Either way, this DVD series would be a waste of your time and money.",1262390400,7,1143,4.881443298969073
3719818,3,B001NNTGF8,"I'm a bit of a historian myself, however, in the East Asian Civilizations but I have always been fascinated by the 7 Deadly Sins where they come from and where they take us. However, this format of history telling is a bit too accessible for me. It seems like they feel their audience is bunch of ADD teenagers that'll switch the channel unless they are shocked with another FUN FACT of history. I personally would have preferred it straight up without all the bells and whistles. I liked all the interviews from everyone from Jewish Temples to Mosques and Churches. From Catholic Priests to Faith-Healers and Imams. However, in the end, the focus of the program seems to be more what people thing of the sins now than where they came from. The narrator sounds like that guy Don Fontaine who used to do all those Action movie Trailers making the whole production feel rushed trying (as mentioned above) trying to keep the attention of a very ADD audience.
  However, as another reviewer mentioned, [...] for nearly 7 TV hours of history is a bit of a bargain so 3 stars from me.",1245974400,11,1078,4.580310880829016

3719826,1,B001NNTGF8,"Amazingly the History Channel intentionally failed to address the questions and answers desired by viewers and to elaborate on the exact title of the Seven Sins. More fictional than reality, lacks research, archeological facts, no anthropological findings, or examination of biblical scriptures, ect etc, it just has some Ph.

3719832,3,B001NNTGF8,Not that this is a bad documentary series but there is no play all function on this one. well sort of- Let me explain- on the first disc you have the first four sins- however the main menu offers no play all function- you choose one of the sins you would like to watch and then it pops up another menu that lists all the scenes for that particular choice and then offers a play all function. Rather surprising because most history dvds that I have come across from the documentary side of things never have that problem. I really wish they would fix this little hick up. of having no play all function,1413849600,,601,4.280701754385965

3719837,5,B001NNTGF8,"This is real History, with intelligentsia comments in it.  In this world there is nothing so observed, so vulgar and without a command  sense bases that there well be some Ivy league graduate who will profess an explanation totally void of the testimony of the Holy Scriptures.  Beginning with Ephesians 4:8 Christ descended into hell, a real place. Other verses of hell are Luke 16:22-24 Abraham's Bosom and the Lake of Fire, Matt. 8:12 weeping and gnashing of teeth, Matt. 13: 42 Cast them into the furnace of fire, and Rev. 9:2 opened the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of a great furnace.  Hell is a real place and is spoken of as a Bottomless pit, a great furnace, and also the Lake of Fire.  It really takes a Doctor's degree to be so screwed up, that he can not understand the statements, "" and He descended into hell and He ascended into Heaven"".  Although this is only a small part of the DVD, it is still misleading.  Passed the intelligentsia there is great history and explanation of the words being used to name the Sins in this documentary.  The history is that the Sins are not a list in the Bible but are a revised list of temptation renamed as Deadly Sins.  This documentary will explain why the Seven Deadly Sins are not spoken about in most churches.  Then the best of all this documentary does explain the real meaning of the Words used to name the Sins.  Many churches, Preachers and Teachers express the name of the sins in the definition of their own interpretation and not the biblical meaning.  The documentary states the meaning the names of the Seven Deadly Sins as it was meant  at the time of its writing and not in the craziness of our time.  The documentary does have other history of the authors who wrote strange things of their time.  So a person without a historical and biblical back ground need to be ware, that just because it in a documentary does not mean it is a historical or a biblical fact.",1393632000,,1939,4.484330484330484

3719839,5,B001NNTGF8,"I love this.  I saw this on the history channel many years ago and had to get it when I saw it on DVD.  It is a great historical documentary with data from the Bible, Dante's Inferno and Catholic church history.  I love this.",1386806400,,225,4.068181818181818
3719840,2,B001NNTGF8,"This two DVD set is riddled with half-truths and outright falsehoods.  One minor example: the program repeatedly states that the seven deadly sins are not found anywhere in the Bible.  False.  While a formal list does not appear, all the sins are addressed many times in both the Old and New Testaments.  One major example: the program states that the Church's teaching on priestly celibacy appeared virtually out of thin air one day in the Middle Ages.  False.  It was normative since 306 AD, and was encouraged even long before that time; besides, the Church does not teach (and has never taught) that celibacy is mandatory for ALL clergy.  Like many people throughout the ages, this program confuses the actions (or teachings) of individuals with official dogma.  Whoever produced this series was asleep at the wheel.  The various programs also display an atmosphere leaning more towards Jerry Springer than a serious documentary, which I found annoying.

That having been said, there were some segments that were moderately informative, contrasting ancient (pagan) views of these sins, and modern interpretations of them.  Those interviewed for this program were mostly lay scholars.  Clergy were Christian, for the most part, with an occasional appearance by an imam.  The most interesting commentary came from the always erudite Rabbi David Wolpe.  A Marine Corps sergeant provided an interesting perspective on how soldiers deal with anger, while still doing their duty.

On the technical side, it's a mixed bag.  Audio quality was good.  The video quality left something to be desired; once again, in this age of 16x9 TVs, a studio put a widescreen format in to a 4x3 aspect ratio.  Luckily, the picture quality is good enough that if you decide to use the zoom function to fill your screen, grain does not become distracting.

This program originally aired at a time when the History Channel was transitioning from actual history, to the reality-based tabloid junk it broadcasts today.  Such a shame...I used to be a big fan of their wonderful explorations of the past.  Now, it's all alien conspiracies, Nostradamus prophecies, and inbred mental defectives who search the swamps for logs.  But I digress.

Can I recommend buying this so-called ""documentary?""  Only if you're an atheistic, narcissist libertine looking to have your prejudices reinforced.  Although there are some good points (and I do believe it was well intentioned), in my opinion this series failed miserably.  If you want a genuine exploration of the Seven Deadly Sins, the damage they cause, and the Four Cardinal Virtues needed to combat them, I recommend chapters 13-14 of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Catholicism-For-Dummies/dp/1118077784/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Catholicism For Dummies</a>.

3719847,4,B001NNTGF8,"I began watching this series in a hotel room while on vacation, amd was so intrigued I immediately went online and ordered it from Amazon.com so I could share it with others. (I am an adult bible study teacher and love church history) As watered down as much of our Christian teaching has gotten in the last 50 + years, I found this look into the religious past to be a valuable counter point to our largely undiscplined, soft approach to dealing with our sins. I found some segments more intriguing than others, but all in all I would recommend this series to anyone interested in the Catolic Church, Christian history, and our starkly changed cultural views of sin.",1350000000,,667,4.61344537815126

Getting this DVD i can assure you u will not feel wrath and anger for the price as it worth every cent,watching this will make u lust for more history channel DVD's.
