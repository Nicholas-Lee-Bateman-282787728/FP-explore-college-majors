2473173,4,B000CSTK3I,Great movie!!!!,1422057600,,15,7.0
2473174,2,B000CSTK3I,I should have noticed it was a made-for-tv lifetime movie before I ordered,1420416000,,74,4.769230769230769
2473175,4,B000CSTK3I,Love the movie. DVD is great quality. No issues.,1407456000,,48,4.444444444444445
2473176,5,B000CSTK3I,Funniest damn movie I've ever come acrossed too for EMS story considering I'm Firefighter @ EMR myself It really does make things look funny in EMS,1389830400,,147,4.6923076923076925
2473177,5,B000CSTK3I,I want to see Ambulance Girl with Kathy Bates in DVD region 4 where it can be played here in Australia. How do I get this DVD it is so hard to get.,1375228800,,147,3.484848484848485
2473178,5,B000CSTK3I,"I got my EMT in 97. Then on to Medic in 99. I recommend this movie to anyone in the EMS field or their friends and family. Actually anyone. It is so wonderful, funny and not at all like this fake mess you see on tv. I got it for my MOM and she LOVED it!",1361404800,,253,3.5357142857142856
2473179,4,B000CSTK3I,"I finally saw this and enjoyed it. It is a good portrayal of a woman who, much to her own surprise, becomes a volunteer EMT and finds it a valuable and meaningful experience that broadens her life. It's a drama and it doesn't skirt around the fact that the heroine is in a phase of her life where she needs something more. (It starts and she's watching TV and snacking, unsure of what to do  now that her alcoholic husband has sobered up and is leading a productive life but is often focused on AA meetings and sobriety and recovery.) This, actually, is accurate for many people who become hardcore EMT's. While watching I was reminded a bit of friends' complaints that in Lifetime Network movies the men, especially the husbands are often the bad guys, but nevertheless I thought it was a great film if you want a portrayal of what it's really like to be a volunteer EMT and what sort of people do it. A much better and accurate portrayal than some of the stuff out there. (i.e. the horrible TV show ""Trauma"" -ick! bad medicine, stupid plots and pure garbage.)

BTW, I base much of this review on my own experiences as a volunteer and commercial EMT.",1349654400,,1151,4.450236966824645
2473180,5,B000CSTK3I,"I had to check to see who wrote this because it followed my own life in so many ways. I was an ""ambulance girl"" at an older age like Kathy Bates in this movie.  I made the same dumb mistakes. When I first started as an EMT I did like she did, went to bed with my clothes on, just waiting for the radio to go off. It brought back so many memories, and was a great part of my life. Love it!!!",1334707200,2,390,3.6987951807228914
2473181,5,B000CSTK3I,"I've been a fan of Kathy Bates ever since I saw her in a small role in ARTHUR 2.  She's a wonderful actress, and can handle comedy and drama roles. (who can forget MISERY) and was very happy to see AMBULANCE GIRL on DVD.",1320364800,,220,4.0
2473192,4,B000CSTK3I,"After seeing only a portion of this movie on telly I decided to buy it, as it intrigued me to find out how it ended. I found Kathy Bates to be excellent in the role and the supporting cast were also very good. It isn't an overly fast paced movie but would be quite appealing to anyone that may have an interest in EMS. It showed the light hearted side of Janes (Kathy Bates)  journey, but also tried to show the challenges that she faced both on the job and at home. The movie intrigued me enough to go and purchase the book once I realised that it was a true story. As someone who has battled anxiety, I found it quite inspirational to not let my dreams remain untried.",1304985600,,670,4.153846153846154
2473193,5,B000CSTK3I,"This movie is a great combination of comedy and drama. If you love Kathy Bates, she doesn't disappoint..as an actress or director.",1282089600,2,130,4.954545454545454
2473194,4,B000CSTK3I,I like the story of a woman who has courage even in the face of the things she fears most.  And it did a good job of showing the validity of quite different points of view.  It's definitely for adults in relationship.,1266537600,,217,4.142857142857143
2473195,5,B000CSTK3I,I am a 17 year old who is certified as an E.M.T. and I work for the local ambulance service. I truly enjoyed this movie because it reminds me of my self on how much i love the ambulance!! The DVD I bought was used but When i got it in the mail it was like BRAND NEW!!,1253923200,2,267,3.6206896551724137
2473196,3,B000CSTK3I,"I originally saw this movie on the Lifetime network. This is a good story with a good message. Kathleen Bates is superb.  The acting was credible, the filming and editing were perfectly balanced. This has the potential to be a 'chick flick', however I think it has universal appeal.",1206403200,4,282,4.755102040816326
2473197,5,B000CSTK3I,"Kathy Bates stars and directs in this hilarious story about a successful woman hitting her mid-life crisis. Paranoid of just about everything, Jane is a celebrity food writer who makes the most bizarre career change choice by becoming a volunteer ambulance driver. She bumbles down this new path while struggling to save her floundering marriage. This movie speaks to the hearts of anyone who has hit a rough patch in their lives, and or marriages.

2473198,5,B000CSTK3I,"I'm a 45 year old male who is currently recertifying as an EMT.  I read Jane's book of the same title and then later found the movie.  I must admit, as a guy, this movie was a little sappy and made for the woman viewer, but I admit I liked it.  If anything it's something to watch with the members of your family that don't have any idea what drives someone to become an EMT and the possible problems it can cause in family relationships.  Overall I find this a great movie!",1169856000,12,474,4.119565217391305
2473199,4,B000CSTK3I,If you are an EMT or Paramedic you will relate to this movie.  It was mildly funny.,1169337600,,83,3.8823529411764706

2473201,5,B000CSTK3I,"Although this was not anything like I had anticipated, it was very interesting.  Anything with Kathy Bates is terrific!!",1151971200,6,120,5.315789473684211

8101931,5,B000CSTK3I,I liked this movie. Kathy Bates is always a good actress. Basically the movie is about overcoming fears to achieve your goals.,1497139200,,126,4.7727272727272725
8101932,1,B000CSTK3I,fantastic!  thank you.  I was elated I was able to purchase Ambulance Girl!,1494979200,,75,4.6923076923076925

8101934,5,B000CSTK3I,Wonderful movie,1475107200,,15,7.0
8101935,1,B000CSTK3I,I have not watched yet but the outside envelop was fine and no damage but when opened the case was cracked and damaged. Should have shipped it better or the case was already cracked and if so that's poor service!,1469059200,,212,4.325
8101936,5,B000CSTK3I,"I'm not a movie person. It's a shocker to everyone when I sit and watch movies. This movie is worth ""the sit ""loved it",1464480000,,118,3.9583333333333335
8101937,4,B000CSTK3I,"I decided to purchase a copy of this DVD because I caught this movie on TV a few years back and found it really enjoyable.  So much on TV has the same old stale themes - either it's dark...heavy on murders, violent deaths, forensics and autopsy graphics; or it's the opposite and is unbelievably silly with adolescent, immature and off-color humor...and a pointless waste of time.  This movie was neither of these extremes. I found it very entertaining and  Kathy Bates plays her role flawlessly.",1454284800,,496,4.811764705882353
8101938,5,B000CSTK3I,"Kathy Bates performance as a new EMT is spot on in this movie.  It proves you're never too old to try something new, and have a great time doing it.  Helping others in their time of need makes YOU a better person, able to laugh and enjoy life, the good, the bad and the hilarious.",1436832000,,280,4.072727272727272
8101939,5,B000CSTK3I,Loved the movie.........thank you~,1436400000,,34,7.75
