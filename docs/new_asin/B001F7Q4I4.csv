8301327,5,B001F7Q4I4,"The show is very well-done in all aspects. The only bad thing I want to point: season 3 remains unveiled and the producers don't say a thing about it.

In fact a magnificent production since the first season!",1358726400,,208,4.473684210526316
8301328,5,B001F7Q4I4,The dvd is a 2 disk set and has a total of 13 episodes which are the second half of season 1. This is a genuine quality product that I would recomend buying. The dvds will play on most new dvd players outside of America or you can play them on your computer in any country.,1316131200,2,273,3.892857142857143

8301330,5,B001F7Q4I4,"This is so awesome to have because I watch, my seven-year-old watches, my husband watches and even my dogs watch it. It's pure fun without having to explain inappropriate themes. No one dies or kills. It's good to enjoy with the WHOLE fam. We love the DVD!",1263168000,2,256,4.468085106382978
8301331,5,B001F7Q4I4,"Stormhawks is a brilliant show. I am so glad this next dvd set is coming out. I think this show was one of Cartoon Networks best shows at night just before Adult Swim and then they moved it to early mornings. That was a stupid move on Cartoon Networks part that pretty much killed off this show. Though rated Y7 adults can enjoy this show as well.

What is not to like? Motorcycles that have wings and can fly, awesome characters, cool bad guys, and lots of action. This show was ahead of it's time.

Stormhawks is a great show I would recommend you pick up the dvds.",1223251200,8,567,4.2407407407407405
