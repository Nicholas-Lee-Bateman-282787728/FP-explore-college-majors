The matches were not that good wrestlingwise,but the atmosphere was great in LONDON,GBR.In my opinion,the highlighte was in the sable-jacki match when sable ripped  off jaqualin's  shirt to expose her chest!

The festivities kick off with a basic one-one-one match against the leader of The Brood and Al Snow. Not much interesting stuff happened here until Edge and Christian interfere as distractions. While Christian has the referee's attention, Edge comes off the top turnbuckle with a missile dropkick on Snow. The 2 make their getaway while Gangrel makes the pinfall for the victory. Decent match

2.) LOD 2000 (Animal and Droz) vs The Headbangers

Okay match but still kind of basic. ""We want Hawk"" chants get pretty loud throughout. I'm not really sure why they thought it was a good idea to put Droz in Hawk's place during this time. Droz gets worked over by Mosh and Thrash until he makes the tag to Animal who cleans house. While the referee has his attention on Thrash, Droz pushes Animal out of the ring to try and cleverly switch places with him, but Mosh rolls him up for the win. After the match, Droz and Animal start fighting and have to be separated by referees. Meh match with nice story continuation. But why they chose to do it on a PPV like this is beyond me

3.) Val Venis vs Goldust

The Jerry Springer esque, yet confusing story between Goldust and Val Venis continued. Terri had recently told Venis that she was pregnant after they ""got it on"" but Venis denied impregnating her, claiming he had a vasectomy and called things off with her. This feud was confusing because there was never any clear indication as to who the heel and face was. Was Goldust the face and Venis the heel? Was it the other way around? Or were they both tweener? It was Russo Attitude Era booking at its finest. Despite the story issues the match itself was short but solid. Nearing the end, Goldust and Venis collide into each other and Goldust accidentally headbutts Venis right in his Big Valbowski. Goldust tries to capitalize, setting Venis up in the corner for the Shattered Dreams, but Venis uses the referee as a shield to prevent it. Venis takes advantage with a rolling cradle pin for the win. After the match, Goldust attacks Venis and hits the Shattered Dreams to a big pop from the crowd

Clip of Vince McMahon speaking at the Oxford Union

The McMahons, Pat Patterson, and Gerald Briscoe come out shortly after the clip and announce changes to the Capital Carnage card while Vince sips on English tea. Patterson announces that The Rock will no longer defend the WWF Championship against Triple H, but against X-Pac; while Triple H will fight Jeff Jarrett. Briscoe and Shane tear into Vinny Jones and George Michael. Vince gets his turn on the mic and considers England's tea time as a ""pile of pious crap"" and slams the tea cup to the ground. Vince says the British crowd wishes they were American blah blah and says Great Britain will become a cesspool governed by a Pakistani leader. The Corporation take their leave. It's clear that this promo was meant as a way to just kill time, but my goodness, this promo seemed like it went on forever

4.) Tiger Ali Singh vs Edge

Edge pretty much dominated this match, owning Tiger all over the ring. Tiger counters a crossbody off the top and pins Edge with his feet on the ropes for the win. Abysmal match in addition to a poor booking choice to have Tiger go over. It didn't help that the crowd was silent for it anyway. Tiger Ali Singh was an afterthought in the Attitude Era who really didn't offer much to the product at this time. Considering it wasn't on TV much longer after this says enough as it is. Tiger tries to attack Edge after the match, but Edge fights back and ejects him from the ring.

5.) Intergender Tag Team Match: Marc Mero and Jacqueline vs Christian and Sable

The partnership between Mero and Jacqueline had quickly deflated. After costing him a match on Heat not too long before, Mero fired Jacqueline from being his manager. Jacqueline enters the ring and Mero starts mouthing off at her and she tackles him down and starts attacking him. The opponents make their entrance the match is underway. After some shenanigans, Mero decides to start off with Sable (who was looking extra fine in the face on this night) but finds himself getting pantsed by Christian, leaving him a victim to kicks to the gut from Sable. The 2 double team Mero, before Christian takes over. Christian attempts a pin but Jackie breaks the pin, initiating a brief chase around the ring from Sable. Christian tags Sable who kicks Mero in his marvelous ones before flattening him with a Sable Bomb. Mero tags Jackie while Mero heads for the hills with Christian going after him. Sable TKOs Jacqueline to get the win. After the match, Jacqueline fights Tim White and he ends up hoisting her up on his shoulders. Sable comes up behind and accidentally rips Jacqueline's entire shirt off, exposing her jugs to the entire crowd. Perhaps the biggest memory point of Capital Carnage. The match itself was too difficult to keep up with constant tagging in what seemed like 30 second intervals. Plus it was just an oddball pairing. A team that hates each other against a goth and a martial artist model

6.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Ken Shamrock w/Big Boss Man (c) vs Steve Blackman

We get a nice but random technical bout between former friends Shamrock and Blackman for the IC Championship. Midway through, Blackman hits a spinebuster for a nearfall. Shamrock comes back with a Fisherman suplex pin also for a nearfall. Blackman knocks Shamrock to the outside with a shoulder block and then completely unprovoked, attacks Boss Man on the outside with a baseball slide. Blackman continues to attack Boss Man on the outside for whatever reason before re-entering the ring to fight Shamrock. Boss Man retrieves a metal baton from his vest and strikes Blackman's ankle with it while the referee isn't looking. Shamrock locks on the Ankle Lock and Blackman taps out for Shamrock to retain the title. Boss Man enters the ring after the match and beats down Blackman for good measure. Can't say Blackman didn't have it coming.

7.) Jeff Jarrett w/Debra vs Triple H

The match starts off back and forth with Jarrett eventually gaining control. An uppercut punch leaves HHH vulnerable to cheap shots from Debra, only to be stopped by Chyna who makes her way to the opposite side of the ring to keep her distance from Chyna. Jarrett continues his assault with a sleeper hold and HHH goes out, escapes the arm drop and escapes the sleeper with a back drop. A facebreaker knee smash sends Jarrett to the outside and Debra uses her womanly ways to try and distract HHH. Chyna tries to intervene but the referee keeps her away from Debra, as she enters the ring to continue her distraction. Jarrett sneaks in the ring with a steel chair as HHH gives Debra a crotch chop. Debra attempts to slap Triple H, but the referee blocks it and tries to get her out of the ring. Just as Jarrett gets ready to nail HHH from behind with the chair, Chyna grabs it out of his hands and HHH follows up with a Pedigree for the win. Not a bad match at all

7.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: The New Age Outlaws (c) vs D'Lo Brown and Mark Henry

This match was pretty dull. A similar match took place at the Survivor Series a few weeks before only the Headbangers were also involved. The Outlaws and Henry and D'Lo had ZERO chemistry in the ring. These guys just couldn't tell a story and it showed in how boring this match was. Henry had to go and make it worse with the dreadful bearhug of doom. Gunn hits the piledriver on D'Lo and Henry just stands there and watches as Gunn gets the pinfall victory

I really enjoyed this tape because it showcased my favorite wrestler X-Pac at his best in a classic battle between the Rock for the WWF Title. It also had a great amount of comedy provided by Mr. McMahon and Co. All around, every match was great, including the main event, A fatal Four-Way match.

The Al Snow match could have been better if it was hardcore, not 2 great.
Val Venis once again performed fairly well.
The mixed match was the most entertaining match at that point of the match, it was fun and at the end Jackie's shirt was ripped off- revealing her breats! giggle.
the rest of the card was alright and the ending was great.
if you are not a wrestling fan but thinking about purchasing this you should because you will gain and understannding of what the wwf is all about, even if it was a bad show.",974764800,,599,4.172413793103448
7886272,2,6305255261,"Having watched this event LIVE in the UK this was a huge disappointment, the WWF seems determined never EVER to left a title change hands at a  non-US event, which may seem a good idea at the time, after all the WWF  doesn't want their main audience (you American's) to miss a title change or  anything, but then when it comes to selling the video it works out a little  different. So them main event is a good one, fatal four way rules, ideally  it would've been elimination rules but we don't want out top starts  performing for more than twenty minutes and actually break out into a  sweat. The WWF messed up big time, the crowd was a sell-out and fired-up,  but only 90% effort was delivered. Terrible announcing and a terrible card  that had half the matches on RAW the week before.",966211200,,787,4.409722222222222

The Rock-Xpac match was tremendous,  and the main event fatal fourway was even better. Plus the only time you'll  ever see HHH vs Jeff Jarrett, the Jaqueline incident, a classic Rock  interview, and Marc Mero's last ever WWF match ( maybe ever? ).",957657600,,501,4.413043478260869
