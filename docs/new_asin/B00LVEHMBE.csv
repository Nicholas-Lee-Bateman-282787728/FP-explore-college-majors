8668330,3,B00LVEHMBE,"This would have gotten more marks if SM had not Cut Hankyung out of all the videos.  I have some of the old DVDs and I can't believe they just cut him out so blatantly.  Out of Super Girl?  And what did they replace him with, Henry and Zhoumi.  I'm not fond of them.  For Suju fans who know some of these vids, this will be a big shock.  SM you suck.

The good parts are that you get TONS of videos.  The quality is nice, and the older live perfs. etc from Cooking Cooking, Pajama Party etc are included. These are some of my favorite songs.  There is also From You, which is also one of my favorites.  And of course Oppa Oppa with some blatant and gratuitous Eunhae.  There are English subs for most of the items in the video, as well as hangul subs. and I think all of the live are from SBS inkigayo, but I don't remember.

Still super good.  But the Hangeng bit was unpleasant and surprising.  He is not my favorite member, but you can't say it is All About Super Junior and remove members if you don't like them.  This is for fans, not for the management of SM.  Hangeng fans and any long-time fans will be disappointed.  If there is some legal reason they could not include him, then they should state that.",1448841600,2,1212,4.155172413793103
