2517820,5,B000EGDAF2,"My daughter with Down syndrome was born the same year that Life Goes On debuted on television. It was so personally empowering to witness an actor with Down syndrome starring on a popular TV show. I loved every episode. Thanks to the DVD release, now my kids and all my friends can enjoy this special TV show. I plan to buy a carton and use them for all upcoming birthdays and also Christmas gifts.",1142467200,9,398,4.391891891891892
2517821,5,B000EGDAF2,"Oh-blah-dee, Oh-blie-dah, Life Goes On!

I grew up with many family shows such as Little House on the Praire, the Waltons, and so forth.  But, Life Goes On will always be my favorite.

Life Goes On put realism and just a touch of grit into television as it attempted to broadcast to families the changing times, the new issues facing teenagers, and the plights of an American family constantly struggling to make do.

Life Goes On is the first television series to have a down-syndrome actor as one of its stars.  Chris Burke (Charles ""Corky"" Thacher) is simply wonderful.  You will see over the course of four seasons how his acting range really blossoms.  He was originally going to be the focal point of the show.

Life Goes On is about the Thachers...a semi-middle class family living in Glenbrook Illinois which is a suburb of Chicago.  It is the story of a hard-working family that faces one plight after another...just like life!

Drew Thacher (Bill Smitrovich) is the father who is working as a construction worker.  He's tired of ""just getting by"" with the hard physical labor and the small checks.  He plays a father who loves his children and is always trying to find a way to get ahead; to get on top of things.  His life-long dream is to be the owner of a restaurant.  Over the course of the first season we find out if he can achieve this dream or not...and if so, what are the costs?

Libby Thacher is wonderfully played by stage performer and Tony award winner, Patti Lupone.  She works for an advertising agency run by Jerry (who becomes a favorite character played by Ray Butenika).  Libby is tired of doing all of Jerry's dirty work...taking his clothes to the cleaners, washing his car, getting him coffee, etc.  She feels she can do more than this, but Jerry is stingy and tries to cut financial costs and corners wherever he can.

Paige is Drew's daughter from his first marriage.  She is out of high school, and a bit of a leaf blowing in the wind.  She doesn't know what she wants to do with her life.  The role of Paige is played first by Monique Lanier who has a softness and sweetness in the character.  She is replaced from the second season on by Tracey Needham.  Paige has a special relationship with Corky, and she has the usual big-sister/little-sister issues with Becca.  She also begins the show with an estranged relationship with Libby.

Corky is the oldest son who is suddenly moved from attending a special school to a public school, as he is high-functioning, and the Thachers feel he is entitled to a ""regular"" education as they attempt to mainstream him.  Corky finds himself the target of many high school taunts and practical jokes (particularly Russo).  Tyler Benchfield is, at first, Corky's only friend.  Tyler is a jock who has a special place in his heart for Corky, as we discover that Tyler has a brother with down-syndrome also.  Tyler attempts to protect Corky and to help him fit in.  Becca, the youngest daughter, is not thrilled at having Corky at her school, but quickly changes her tune.

Kellie Martin would soon take center stage in Life Goes On.  Her acting ability is tremendous, and the writers quickly discover that the meat of their story is in the character of Becca (Rebecca) Thacher.  She is a brilliant, straight ""A"" student with glasses and skinny legs who dreams of Tyler, her life-long crush.  She's feisty and has a knack for throwing out intelligent comebacks or quips to her parents or to those who try to put her down.  We quickly find that Becca is an intelligent girl with an even bigger heart.  Subsequent seasons will demonstrate this fact when she meets Jesse (Chad Lowe), a boy she quickly falls in love with, but discovers he is HIV+, which sets up one of the most powerful relationship dynamics in television history.

This is a show about real values.  This is a show about real problems...money, integrating into high school, issues facing the rearing of a down-syndrome child, broken dreams, etc.  You find as a viewer that you relate with the Thachers.  Their world is far from perfect, but the love is always there, and in the end, it's the most important glue to holding a family together.

The entire cast is wonderful.  I loved this show when it was on.  I was sorry to see it go.  Chad Lowe would later win a much deserved Emmy for his performance as Jesse McKenna as Life Goes On would tackle one of the biggest issues in society...AIDS and how it affects a high school boy; how he deals with the prejudices of those around him, and why a ""normal"" girl would want to have anything to do with him.

Life Goes On will touch your heart, make you laugh, and make you cry because there is a tenderness and sweetness behind the realism.  Life Goes On proved that family television can do both!",1141689600,44,4780,4.58913813459268
2517822,5,B000EGDAF2,"When I found out that LGO was finally coming to DVD I was super excited!  I had been going to websites about shows coming to DVD and I had been e-mailing everyone I could think of to tell them it would be a HUGE MISTAKE not to put LGO on DVD.

LGO and Kellie Martin especially (we are now the same age now which is super scary got me through those rough years in high school because she was just like me!!

I think I have seen every episode and I know them all by heart.. my favorites  Becca at the spring fling with her two dates ""Matt"" and ""Tyler""  also the episode with her and the prom on the night her mom goes into labor and ""Tyler"" kisses her..  and who could forget the episodes with Chad Lowe ""Jesse"" some of the best acting either one has ever done....",1140652800,7,762,4.046666666666667
2517823,5,B000EGDAF2,"Finally the greatest tv show is being released on dvd for purchase. I cannot wait to buy it! I have probably half the episodes of LGO on video, but I have watched them each atleast 50 times and my tapes are getting worn out.

This show is about a middle class family residing in Glenbrook, Il. The main character ""Corky"",played by Chris Burke, has Downs Syndrome yet manages to rise above his limitations and lead a pretty normal life. He goes to a regular high school, dates, works part time, and brings happiness to everyone. The family encounters other problems besides Corky's condition, but manages to get through due to their faith in God and love and commitment for each other.

Patty Lupone, the Broadway Star, plays Corky's mom. In many episodes she sings, what a treat!

 I think this first season was the best. My all time favorite episode is from the first season, the one where Corky develops a crush on the new girl in school ""Ginny"" played by Shannon Doherty. I also love the episode where Becca gets her first kiss.  I know Kellie Martin mentioned once that her favorite episode is from the first season and it's the one where her beloved ballet teacher has to move into a retirement home and can no longer teach ballet. Martin also said her all time favorite role was playing Becca on LGO.

  I hope this season sells really well so that all four seasons will be released and available for purchase. This is a show the entire family can watch together.

Thanks you so much, Warner Brothers, for releasing LGO. I hope this show impacts the next generation.

Thanks also, Chris Burke, for your determination and hard work. You brought joy and inspiration to us all. God Bless You.",1140048000,11,1695,4.601328903654485
2517824,4,B000EGDAF2,"I've got great memories of watching this show on Sundays night over dinner with my family.  They really don't make t.v. like this anymore, and that's a shame.  The Thatchers were a believable family, albeit a very unique one.

I do think the first season was a bit uneven, as the show struggled to become more than just a soapbox for accepting different people (i.e., Corky's Down Syndrome).  And they never could seem to figure out what to do with oldest daughter Paige (who was played by another actress in seasons 2-4).  But it's still engaging family drama that never gets TOO preachy.

The best part about the first season has to be Kellie Martin as Becca.  The part was smarter and better-written than any teenage role I can recall.  Martin just got better as the series went on; it's a shame she would only do one more series (the short-lived CHRISTY) before becoming the queen of t.v. movies throughout much of the 90's.

I hope that this set sells well so Warner will be able to release the remaining seasons of Life Goes On.",1139356800,64,1034,4.545945945945946
2517825,5,B000EGDAF2,"My second favorite family drama of all time (Our House ranks #1) is finally coming to DVD!  I watched this show religiously every Sunday night (back to back with America's Funniest Home Videos) when it originally aired.  Like the other vreviewer said, the only bad part is that the original theme will not be intact.  But hey, it's a small price to pay to have the show on DVD.  I urge all fans of this show to PLEASE buy this set despite the theme change.  There is a lot more to a show than just it's theme.  This show is very deserving to have all four seasons released.  I believe Warner Bros. also owns ""Our House,"" so hopefully if this does well they'll eventually feel comfortable with releasing ""Our House"" as well.  First Knots Landing, now Life Goes On.  Well done, Warner!

UPDATE;  Sitcoms Online has posted a review of the set and even has an audio clip of the new theme song.  However, the original theme song is still in tact in the pilot! :)  The original closing song is in tact in the pilot as well, and the original end theme is in tact in all the other episodes.  The new theme song is alright, but the DVD reviewer was right when they said it sounds more like it's for a teen show but still catchy. The only problem I have with the new theme song is that it sounds a little too today-ish.  But it's the episodes themselves that really count and that's all that matters.

If you'd like to read the review and listen to the audio files, just go to Sitcoms Online (with your standard [...] and .com after it).  Click on ""DVD Reviews"" in the side panel, and scroll down until you find ""Life Goes On.""  The reviews are in alphabetical order.",1139356800,11,1657,4.324675324675325

This set is going to contain six disc's and it's going to have audio comentary by Corky (Chriss Burke) on the pilot episode. The only bad thing about this set is the theme song Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da is going to be replaced by another song do to licenseing issues. Warner Bros. Says they had to make the change or not release the show. That's a bummer but at least we can see Life Goes On again (it's been a long time).",1139270400,13,479,4.217391304347826

2517838,5,B000EGDAF2,"""Life Goes On"" was one of my favorite TV-series of the 90's and now  I'm watching it again so many years later I still love it just as much as I used to! Though I followed the series faithfully when it was aired on TV, I must have missed a few episodes back than, for episodes like "" The babysitter"" ""Break a leg, mum' and a few others were new to me. On the other hand, the Pilot and ""Corky for president"" are episodes I still remember quite sharply and really enjoy watching again.

2517871,5,B000EGDAF2,"This is one of my all-time favorite shows...a family drama that wasn't afraid to take on tough issues. SUPERB cast. (Even Paige, the older sister whom other reviewers have criticized, found her place in later seasons when the role was taken over by Tracey Needham.) Watching season 1, it's striking how we got to see Kellie Martin's character grow from a girl into a young woman over the course of four seasons. The first season was great, and in my opinion it only got better in the later seasons. I HOPE The Powers That Be will see fit to release seasons 2-4 one of these days! Please?

(Oh and I agree, the ""replacement"" theme music is NO comparison to the wonderful original rendition of the cast led by Patti LuPone singing ""Ob La Di, Ob La Da"" -- but if that's the only way they can avoid copyright issues and get this show on DVD, I can accept it.)",1377907200,11,855,4.377358490566038

There IS closed captioning but the text content doesn't match up very well with the spoken dialog.  For someone with less than perfect hearing these are extremely annoying issues.

Please release seasons 2-4 of Life Goes On on DVD. It isn't fair to release Season 1 and then not do any of the others. Especially for all of us that love this show. I don't know how well it has sold or not, but there are a lot of people out there who would buy the rest of the seasons. Please do it.",1187308800,5,581,4.0

I wish there were a lot more television shows like this using people with real disabilities.  This show did a lot to break down barriers for people with disabilities, particularly people with Down Syndrome and other types of mental retardation.

2517924,5,B000EGDAF2,"Growing up I used to watch this show, nearly every Sunday night. I still remember trying to finish up last-minute stuff, have my shower and get ready for school the next day in time to watch ""Life Goes On"" (and on many occasions, ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" after that)

  Often I would be running late, and would watch ""Life Goes On"" in my parents bedroom, practically still dripping wet, wearing a bathrobe, with my hair wrapped up turban-style in a towel to air-dry as my dad ironed his work clothes, and I watched the show.

  I have LOVED ""Life Goes On"" for its entire run! It is a poignant and touching family drama, starring Bill Smitrovich and Patti LuPone as ""Drew"" (Smitrovich) and ""Libby"" (LuPone) Thatcher, a middle working-class couple, who are dealing with the issue of ""mainstreaming"" their 18 year old son, Charles ""Corky"" who has Downs Syndrome into a regular, public high school as a freshman, and all the challenges and trials, tribulations, and triumphs that go along with it.

  Drew and Libby have their hands full, raising Corky and their 2 other children, twenty-something Paige (Monique Lanier in Season 1, Tracey Needham in Season 2-4) who is Drew's child from a previous marriage, and 14 or 15 year old Rebecca ""Becca"" while trying to make ends meet on Drew's construction worker salary, and Libby's income as a secretary/clerical worker in an advertising agency.

  Towards the end of the first season, Drew buys a diner, and quits his back-breaking construction work to run the restaurant, and things start looking up for the Thatchers.

  Growing up I LOVED watching ""Life Goes On"", especially because of Kellie Martin, and Monique Lanier. Though I liked Tracey Needham, I was IMMENSELY disappointed when Monique left, and the role of Paige was recast with Tracey. Because up until then, I LOVED Paige best, and then Becca. After Monique left and Tracey assumed the role, it changed and I LOVED Becca best.

  This is a BEAUTIFUL series, and one of the many nostalgic highlights of my childhood and adolescence.

  When I think of my childhood and preteen years, I think of shows like ""Punky Brewster"", ""Life Goes On"", ""Perfect Strangers"", ""Who's the Boss?"", ""Head of the Class"" and many more!

  But ""Life Goes On"" (and a few very select others), had and still does have a very special place in my heart!

A word of caution...Corky's character is played by someone who is older then the High Schooler he plays.  Corky's character is also made to appear higher functioning than the actual actor and most Down Syndrome kids and adults.

She is now 46 years old, lives with me and has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's ---which doctors/researchers are discovering in Down Syndrome's who live into their 40' and 50's.

I have tried numerous things to engage Cathy Sue--in an effort to keep her mind as alert as possible.  Sadly, she seems to have lost interest in most of the things that she dearly loved.  The Dodgers; Cops TV show; arts/crafts and oldies music.

When I found this show on DVD--I immediately ordered the series for her---and she just perked right up!  She remembers the show, the theme song, the characters and of course, Corky Thacher!

In fact, whenever she sees Corky on her big screen TV------ she forgets that it's TV and tries to touch Corky on the screen.

I enjoy watching Cathy Sue---while she watches Corky.

I recommend this wonderful program to anyone with kids of any age......the show's story and characters present an ideal opportunity to teach children about ""special people"".

It goes without saying---anyone with a Down's adult who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's-----should try shaking up the memory cells and purchase this program.",1151884800,21,1224,5.044776119402985

It teaches without preaching, and the focus of the show is always on ""doing the right thing.""

2517934,5,B000EGDAF2,"Im trying to collect all the memorable 80's TV shows from when I was a kid. This is definetly one of the best shows of the 80's.

2517935,5,B000EGDAF2,"I think Corky is my favorite character. He's taught so many of us to look differently at people with handicaps; to not see them as people to pity, but to see them as individuals conquering life just like the rest of us. Corky was different, that's true. He had a handicap, that was true too. But he was bright, intelligent, and sensitive--in his own right--and his character reached through the television screen and taught the world so much about life and about living. The supporting cast members also offered great role models for our children and if you'd like to get back to wholesome television that doesn't call for clicking the mute button or covering young one's eyes, you'll want to get this season!",1149292800,3,709,4.725806451612903
2517936,5,B000EGDAF2,"I remember LIFE GOES ON so well.  I was an adult struggling with a young family, my oldest disabled (not down's but just as disabilitating) and my youngest, my baby girl, coming of age and having to suffer wearing glasses for the first time, like Becca.  I swear the writers of this program were looking over my shoulder to get their ideas.  I LOVED this show and was totally devoted to it.  This from an avid NBC junkie who hardly ever switched channels.  Come Sunday night, we went to ABC and sang along as the theme song came on.  It gave our family many things to talk about after the show.

Please remember that during this time LIFE GOES ON was cutting edge and very controversial.  Not only did they have a son with down's syndrome and mainstreaming was still pretty new, but later Becca deals with a boyfriend with HIV and then AIDS.  It was SO controversial, the last show where Robbie dies of AIDS was not shown by our local network (and by MANY local networks from what I was told) because of the AIDS story line.  To this VERY DAY I have never seen the last episode.  ABC lost me as a customer after that.

I actually cried when they announced the show had been canceled.  My son identified with Corky, and my daughter, who wanted to be a teenager at 9 years old, identified with Becca.  To me, they were family that lived in the Midwest and came to see me every week.  I marveled at the realism and the true to life struggles the family faced each week.

My biggest thanks for bringing this DVD out.  I will preorder every season, all of them this very second if you will promise to bring them all out on DVD.  A big thank you to the writers, the actors (especially those who played Corky and Becca) and ABC for putting on such a cutting edge program that made many uncomfortable.  Now a days, no one would bat an eye watching these episodes.",1149292800,11,1855,4.3246376811594205
2517937,5,B000EGDAF2,"This was my favorite show when I was in college.  I loved Corky.  Little did I know that one day in the not so distant future I would give birth to a child with Down Syndrome.  My husband gave this to me for Mother's Day.  We have really enjoyed watching Life Goes On with our children, ages 11, 9, and 6.  Of course, some of the episodes hit close to home since our oldest has Down Syndrome.  This show displays wonderful family values.  It's tough to find a show like this even with all the options on cable today.  I highly recommend it.",1148688000,8,540,4.174757281553398
2517938,5,B000EGDAF2,I've been waiting for this DVD collection since the last episode aired (which I still have on tape). This is absolutely positively my favorite television show of all time. This was the show that caught me at perfect age and really spoke to me as a kid. It was my moral compass and a huge part of the person I became. All parents should show this television show to their kids. It's amazing.,1147305600,3,390,4.3561643835616435
2517939,5,B000EGDAF2,"Family dramas had existed since the invention of television-but 'Life Goes On' really attempted to deal with real life.

14 years after the passage of laws requiring special education, this was the first series realistically examining a person with a disability as lead character that audiences intentionally were supposed to empathize with.

Nineteen year old Charles ""Corky"" Thatcher has Downs Syndrome (as does the actor Chris Burke who plays him). Many plots of this award-winning series involved Corky adjusting to being mainstreamed in a regular school after previously having attended a special school.

Younger sister Becca  (Kellie Martin-in her breakout role) loves her brother, but also wrestles with her own challenges of wanting to support family while wanting to fit in with her peers who don't take easily to the `weird'. Winning the affections of Tyler Benchfield (Tommy Puett) is her recurring goal throughout the 1989-1990 season.  She also gets an EXCELLENT `star' episode in ""Becca and the Underground Newspaper"" , learning the hard way that publishing everything and anything you find out without first doing fact-checking is irresponsible journalism. Tyler is admittedly hot for the era, but the writers wanted Becca to also be daring.

""Corky for President"" is a good episode because Corky runs for president---without realizing that the girl whom he sincerely had a crush on encouraged him to run to only toy with his emotions. She did not feel the same way about him. At the same time, it showed Corky seriously campaigning and sincerely believing that he could be president.

Another memorable episode is ""The Baby-sitter"" because Corky gets a job as a babysitter, taking care of children. This is important because people with disabilities ourselves are historically portrayed as children, needing other people to take care of us. Corky himself is considered responsible and capable.

""Ordinary Heroes"" is a pivotal episode because Drew decides to quit his construction business and instead open up a restaurant. The current owner of the property the Thatchers are interested in won't sell because of Corky's disability, but the Thatcher family restaurant ultimately comes into fruition.

Then, Corky is paired up with none other than Shannen Doherty herself when a teacher has students do a `marriage' project (""Corky's Crush"").He subsequently develops a crush on her-while she has the hots for another guy. I still get a kick out of this episode because both Kellie Martin and Doherty now look so different from how they once looked.

""Corky Rebels"" is an important episode because it communicates that some families smother their members with disabilities under the guise of protecting them They don't want to acknowledge us as being independent. Corky's `fight the power' act looks somewhat campy now, but ironically aired at a time when disability activists demanded greater freedoms for people with disabilities and passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

""The Return of Uncle Richard"" reminds us that those upcoming freedoms will not leave the world in a free for all. Drew Thatcher (Bill Smitrovitch) mends fences with his estranged brother Richard so Corky still will have a guardian if something bad were to happen to his parents.

I have a different disability and am a young adult in a much different era, but this series continues to address so many similar issues. It grows ever more relevant for me and other people with disabilities. Many of our experiences continue being reflected in the series scripts without being condescending, overdramatic, or disempowering.

Extras include commentary by both Chris Burke and the series creator Michael Braverman. During this season only, Paige Thatcher, Drew's daughter from a previous marriage, is played by Monique Lanier.  This series was good in it's time, but grows ever more cherished with age. It's a scathing indictment of current television that other series have yet to make a similar cultural impact, particularly concerning people with disabilities, our families, and friends.",1146960000,57,4082,5.308527131782946
2517940,5,B000EGDAF2,"I have waited for several years for Life Goes On to come out on DVD.  I kept thinking that with just about every other TV show released, it has to come out sometime.  It finally does in May 2006.

I ""discovered"" Life Goes On late in its last season on ABC.  I watched maybe the last six episodes on Sunday night.  I did not think I would like it at first, but it turned out I loved it.  After it was cancelled, I began watching reruns on the Family Channel, but sadly it was removed from the lineup shortly after.

Life Goes On tackles many issues without being political.  The characters are all very well developed and each one is allowed to be the star in certain episodes.  Sadly the show was advertised and perceived as a show ""about a boy with Down's Syndrome"".  Certainly it broke new ground with that and the character Corky was big in the show, but as the first season progressed, Kellie Martin's character Becca became the star.  Becca was a great character and Martin played her very well.  It is a worthwhile family drama that will be a good investment.  I can't wait to get it!",1144886400,11,1090,4.336633663366337
