6062211,5,B00G7A5VVK,"A real fun ""what if?"" movie. Gives you something to think about after it's over. An entertainment value beyond the run time.",1391040000,3,124,4.681818181818182
6062212,4,B00G7A5VVK,"If you are looking for big visual effects this is not your film. On the other hand if you're a fan of realistic post-apocalyptic themes with a human edge, this is for you. As usual Tom Sizemore does an excellent job of playing the military tough guy, but this time in the role of a general. There are also some good supporting actors.
If you've ever wondered how your neighborhood or subdivision would fare under difficult circumstances you will enjoy this story.",1390953600,19,463,4.658536585365853
6062213,1,B00G7A5VVK,Someone forgot to write scenario for this movie? There are three unconnected and underdeveloped story lines and a bunch of equally unconnected and undeveloped characters . All this mess is topped with lousy acting and sprinkled with poor quality video and audio.,1451865600,,262,5.261904761904762
6062214,4,B00G7A5VVK,"This is a decent ""end of the world as we know it"" movie.  To enjoy this movie you need to be in the frame of mind that you are watching a made for TV movie you might see on the History Channel or the Discovery Channel. It is a good low budget movie, but not a Hollywood Blockbuster film with Bruce Willis. I do think that it gives a realistic representation of a world where the grid has gone out and the problems people face. If you are a ""prepper"" you are sure to enjoy this movie.",1442793600,,483,3.979381443298969
6062215,1,B00G7A5VVK,"No mix of words could ever righteously convey how amateur and unwatchable this is, and without exaggeration I would put it somewhere between a college film project and a poorly produced Lifetime movie of the week.  The acting was tragic to the point of being literally laughable (and this comes from someone who occasionally enjoys a 'bad for the sake of bad' movie).  With the exception of Tom Sizemore, there wasn't a single shred of acting talent in the bunch.  Zero.  The script was a total joke, and plenty of others have commented on that, so I won't drive the point any further.  The direction and cinematography looked as if there was no visual goal or game plan of any kind, and whoever was in charge of sound mixing needs to go back to Freshman year AV.  There was so much mic/volume inconsistency that I eventually gave up and threw on the subtitles.  The most frustrating thing is that they absolutely wasted the opportunity to shed light on a topic that so many take for granted.  The sun isn't the only threat to our fragile electrical grid, and I'm sure many were drawn to this movie for that very reason.  The phrase gets thrown around a lot, but really, don't waste your time.",1442707200,2,1193,4.563380281690141

6062218,5,B00G7A5VVK,Really an entertaining movie for what was no doubt an independent effort. With the current talk of solar flares and EMP's it really is relevant. My wife and I thought the acting was very good. This is not a feel good movie. I think it speaks volumes in regard to human nature as well as being prepared for an incident like this. I would have liked to see this as a trilogy but it is was it is. It was a very good effort and gets the point across.,1438214400,,446,4.022471910112359
6062219,2,B00G7A5VVK,So much potential with this even on a low budget.  It's obvious no one really took the time to think it out a little more. The believable parts are overshadowed by the inconsistencies.,1437868800,,184,4.575757575757576

6062221,1,B00G7A5VVK,"What a waste of money. This seemed like a poor excuse for a college film project. The story was extremely weak and the acting was just as good. Special effects were non-existent! In one scene people are getting shot wit 50 caliber rounds and they limp away holding their leg (still intact and attached) and there is not a single drop of blood. They even state in the movie that it is the middle of winter and the harsh conditions will probably kill off most of the survivors, but there are leaves on the trees, people are sweating, and many are wearing short-sleeved shirts. I would pass on this stinker.",1428451200,,604,4.5

6062231,4,B00G7A5VVK,This movie surprised me.  It is an entertaining SHTF independent film that grabbed me.  I had to watch it twice to understand what happened and it was entertaining both times.,1420588800,,175,4.8
6062232,3,B00G7A5VVK,This movie did not live up to the story line implied by the previews. I was mildly entertaining to watch but if you are stickler for details you will probably be asking yourself why the characters do some of the things they do.

It is painful to watch, and is actually worse than the original (which was never officially released, but I watched). This is really not worth the time or money unfortunately. I had high hopes when I was waiting for it to get released, but I don't think anyone involved with the movie had ANY knowledge about prepping, otherwise it would of had some redeeming value. Move on, nothing to wee here.",1415750400,,460,4.554216867469879
6062237,5,B00G7A5VVK,This is a great story about a community after a societal collapse.  It explores many issues and treats people and circumstances in a realistic way.  The only unrealistic part is that the president of the united states is planning the nation's recovery and his response from a small bunker with a few people instead of the massive underground city that is actually at his disposal should this scenario actually play out.  A little more research would have addressed that only issue I had.  Otherwise a great movie and treatment of the subject.,1413936000,,542,4.858695652173913

6062248,1,B00G7A5VVK,"Wow, where to begin? You CAN make a good movie on a low budget....unfortunately this sophomoric attempt isn't one of them. An R44!?...are you kidding me? The President, his staff, family, and Secret Service bugging out to a remote bunker only need three SUVs? I guess the budget couldn't handle more.  I imagine times have been tough for Tom Sizemore for him to accept his role in this dog of a movie, which is a real pity because I have enjoyed his acting the past. Save your money....and spend it on some preps.",1408147200,,513,4.516129032258065
6062249,3,B00G7A5VVK,"The concept is excellent (take from Lights Out for the most part).  The unknown actors do a fine job.  It makes the movie seem realistic.  I find the insertion of Tom Sizemore to be a huge mistake.  His scenes were obviously shot very quickly and added as an afterthought to give this ""star power.""  Poor decision.  Sizemore is a very good actor, but he needs a good script.  This was not written that way.  That being said, it was a valiant first attempt.",1406764800,,456,4.409638554216867
6062250,3,B00G7A5VVK,"The worst part about it was trying to watch it on Amazon.  The movie freezes up every few minutes which just ruins the viewing.

6062253,3,B00G7A5VVK,"While the story could have been excellent it ended up being boring, and that surprised me greatly.

Im a huge fan of apocalypse stories overall and as such am willing to forgive quite a few things.  Something things I won't overlook include inconsistencies that shout in your face.

For instance, in this movie, we are introduced to a character who is supposedly Special Forces.  First off, the actor playing him had crap for military bearing.  Even retired someone who had achieved a position within the Special Forces would retain his military bearing.  Geeze, non-Special Forces retired military generally retain their bearing.  He would have never listed, to a neighbor he barely knew, the details of his stockpile.  I highly doubt he would have supported releasing someone who was, without a doubt, a threat to his community.  Additionally, he was one of the leaders of a community that was VERY poorly defended.  Is it realistic that he would allow that without question?  Not likely.

The concept of the housing development becoming a self-sustaining community was a great one and I do wish there had been more focus on the development of that community, how the members did and didn't work together.  For me, one of the attractions to disaster type movies is how relationship change and develop and while this movie did a decent job with it, it did miss a huge opportunity.

Personally, I didn't have a problem with the general ineptitude of the government.  What did bother me though was believing that a cabinet level politician would be unshaven on the first day of the disaster.

There were other things that were eyebrow raising but I don't want to give away too much of the plot.

Technically, it was shot fairly well but the music that was supposed to be background in several scenes totally took over the dialogue, making it difficult to hear the actors speaking.  Sound was inconsistent  I spent the entire movie with the remote in my hand turning the volume up, turning it downit took away from the experience of watching a movie.

So overall, it was an okay movie with some interesting concepts and scenarios.  Production quality could have been better; especially sound quality, but I understand budgets.

Ill look for more from this studio simply because Im a sucker for apocalypse movies.",1406419200,2,2310,4.884318766066838

6062256,1,B00G7A5VVK,I feel for Sizemore who has performed in many other good films. This was a disaster of a movie.,1405555200,,95,4.052631578947368
6062257,3,B00G7A5VVK,"This movie is a matter of perspective.  If you can combine all the wrong things to do in a SHTF scenario, and place it all in one movie, this would be that movie.  Now that being said, if you can learn from other peoples mistakes, this might not be a bad movie at all.  Just remember that it is a movie, and a low budget one at that.  Kudos to the team that made the movie.  I wish I would have seen it on Prime instead of spending money on it, but hey, all and all, I personally could not do what they did.

I felt like I was watching a Rod Serling presentation, but in color...

This is a story of human beings stripped of perceived power without the cruft of over exaggerated drama. It is a story of what could happen when the systems we depend on completely fail due to natural effects.

Get past your expectations as drilled into us by Hollywood and there is a gem to appreciate. (BTW: Not a huge Sizemore fan in general)",1404950400,,563,4.554455445544554
6062261,3,B00G7A5VVK,"I was a little disappointed, it seemed low budget.  I didn't like them using the soundtrack only during a few of the scenes, it appeared as though they didn't know what to write for the script.

Unfortunately it fell far short of my expectations. While some of the actors did a good job with a bad script it couldn't save this failed attempt of a movie. The flow of the movie from scene to scene was awful, and just seemed like it was a student project not a real attempt at making a quality movie about a plausible event.

6062267,2,B00G7A5VVK,"This seems more like a low budget made for TV movie, like you might see on the Syfy Channel, though I think they usually have better story lines on there. This was a waste of a talented actor in Tom Sizemore.",1398297600,,208,4.097560975609756
6062268,2,B00G7A5VVK,"Had a hard time staying interested as the story was very disjointed. I found that the only realistic character was the clown that gets booted from the community only to divulge all kinds of information to outsiders. The neighbor that lives across the street immediately gives up all of his information about his supplies with little concern for the consequences even though he is suppose to be a retired Green Beret. I understand that the movie was made on a very thin shoestring budget but had they taken the time to develop the characters a little more and spent less on trying to do the whole governmental conspiracy theory it may have been more palatable.
 I am giving it two stars, one for taking the time to try and make people aware of how fragile the just in time inventory can be ( all you need to do is watch the 24 hours prior to any natural disaster and you will see the worst of humanity). The other star is for giving people something to think about when it comes to their own preparedness.",1398297600,,1004,4.456521739130435

Sizemore did the best he could with what he had....and his delivery was fine....but his lines were terrible!  Unfortunately, he also had a minimal role in the movie and never really ""did"" anything. The other actors were hard to believe and very ""plastic"". I am not sure anyone at any age would enjoy this film. No depth of any character, minimal story development....my 12 year old son could have written and directed a better film!

For some reason they got a more recognizable actor (Tom Sizemore) to play a role and totally dropped the ball. The part of the president and his men was absolutely ridiculous. Bad bad acting.

We really looked forward to this, thinking that it might serve as an suitable and entertaining wake-up call for thousands of Americans about some of the hazards we face, but it is such a turn-off that it will merely become the laughingstock of late-night comedians.
We cannot imagine how Tom Sizemore, having turned in many very fine performances in major films, ever allowed himself to be drawn in to appearing in this farce. Sad, but perhaps he is a victim of changing fortunes in Hollywood.

Anyway, don't buy it, it should be available free, hidden in the depths of Youtube, within days or weeks.

6062283,5,B00G7A5VVK,"Great low budget movie. Its good to see a movie like this made and hopefully it will open some eyes. I received this movie on Tuesday after waiting a couple of weeks for it. It was well worth the wait and I decided to save it for Wednesday night after I got home from Ryans Steakhouse. For those of you who don't know they have Macaroni & Beef on the hot bar this night. The movie gets right to the point and I was happy to see some of my favorite firearms being used. However the one issue I had with the movie was the fact that the general and one of the cabinet members were carrying 9mm Glocks. Everyone knows .45acp is greater than 9mm and 1911 is greater than Glockon that note real chili has beans in it. I really liked seeing all the modern sporting rifles with standard 30rd clips and the shoulder thingy that goes up. If you want to buy one of these rifles after seeing the movie go to your local Walmart and ask for an Assault Rifle that has high capacity heat seeking armor piercing bullets and they will get you one right up. I also found the movie humorous when the only person that had food, ammo and guns stored up was a neckbeard. I think we all need to take a lesson from this guy. AnywayI answered a Craigslist ad for someone wanting to watch this movie so Im on my way over there tonight, he said he had a bunch of imitation crab meat to eat while we watch it.yum yum. Looking forward to Lights Out...hurry up and get this one done.",1392854400,2,1452,4.152482269503546

6062285,3,B00G7A5VVK,"Watched it this morning.  Idea behind it is great.  Surprised Hollywood hasn't swooped up this type of movie.  Acting and camera were what you would expect with a low budget film, so I didn't take that into my account in my review.  What got me was the character development and ending.  Very much a lack of character development with all characters. But the ending was the biggest kicker.  It was flat, anticlimactic, and dissapointing.  Hope they don't ruin the Lights Out movie they are working on.",1391385600,3,501,4.755813953488372
6062286,5,B00G7A5VVK,"I thought this Independent film was well written, directed, produced & made considering it's budget. The acting was also over all pretty good.

6062287,5,B00G7A5VVK,"Confirmation of why Indie movies are better than Hollywood ""blockbusters"". Movies require some kind of edginess, whether it is in the writing, acting or production and this one has it. Taken on face value, this version may lack the big stars that are often required to mask deficiencies in other areas but it delivers where it matters most and that is in the premise that this kind of scenario is not too far removed from our current reality.

I liked the movie and will watch it again and look forward to any other projects the producer has.",1391299200,9,542,4.587628865979381
6062288,2,B00G7A5VVK,"I wanted to like this movie.  I really did because we need more good movies in this genre.  (There are lots of bad ones out there.)  I watched it twice hoping I missed something.  Sadly, it didn't get better.

The biggest problem in this movie is that the screenwriters don't know what they want this movie to be or say.  It's not a drama.  It's not a science fiction flick.  It's not suspense.  It's not horror or action either.  The film is there without direction.  There is little flow from scene to scene.

At the end, you wonder what the screenwriters trying to tell us?  No overarching message is clear.  That they hate politicians?  (who doesn't)  That the military is bloodthirsty bullies?  (uhhhh)  That prepping is important?  (apparently, one upper middle class neighborhood got by without most of them doing so)  That men will plan and work while women cook and take care of the kids?  (maybe?)  Even the old stand-by of the triumph of good over evil isn't present.

The characters are weak and superficial and there is little development in their portrayal.  Our protagonist, in what should be his transformational moment as a leader, comes off as milquetoast with his dialogue.  Later, he becomes almost a dictator in dispensing justice refusing to listen to the concerns of others.  What was the point of introducing a former Special Forces guy as a character if his skills and expertise weren't used in the plot?  That's like bringing a machine gun to a deadly knife fight and then not using it.

As a viewer, you don't care about any of these characters because there is nothing at stake.  Relationships and dialogue between characters are forced.  Everything is flat and there's no tension building to a climax  Perhaps the only character that can be empathized with is Tom Sizemore's role as General Tate - but it's a clownish representation of a military officer.  Sizemore has lots of talent - it's likely he played the role he was given.",1391299200,5,1960,4.741071428571429

6062290,5,B00G7A5VVK,"Considering this DVD cost less than my ticket to WWZ and a soda, I'm glad I own it. This is a low budget movie with heart, and while I love Sizemore in any B flick - the no name folks in this movie bring a certain reality to the screen that is absent in the current generation of Hollywood recycling plant of ideas and people.

This is a popular (USA disaster crash) theme grounded in reality without the distractions of mega special effects that focus' on the human aspects of impending doom and survival afterwards. Very well done and leaves the viewers looking at each other and saying ""well gosh what would we do"" instead of ""how silly, that could never happen.""

Indie movies are where the next generation of inspired film makers will come from, and I'll support these guys and any other projects they kick out - because they've got the back and the drive. Good on them.

Sam Rami, Robert Tappert, and Bruce Campbell all went from shooting horror movies  in their backyard to directing and producing some of the biggest blockbusters this country has ever seen. I hope the same success for these guys.",1391299200,13,1105,4.565656565656566
