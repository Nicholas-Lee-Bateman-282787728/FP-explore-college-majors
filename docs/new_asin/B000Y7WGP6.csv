3012594,5,B000Y7WGP6,"If I wrote this review solely on its merits, I'd give ""the Kingdom"" a solid four star rating.  The acting and action is good and the storyline is gripping but it just doesn't place at the same level of an all-time classic war film like ""Black Hawk Down"" or ""the Battle of Algiers.""

The reason why I give it the coveted five stars is because this is the first, big budget Hollywood movie produced after September 11 that depicts a realistic US enemy, namely al-Qaeda.  For a variety of reasons, Hollywood has failed to do that up until now.  Instead, we have gotten movies with subtle and not-so-subtle anti-American messages like ""Syriana,"" ""Redacted,"" ""the Valley of Wolves,"" and the forthcoming ""Rendition."" In the case of ""the Sum of all Fears,"" Hollywood replaced the logical and plausible villain of Islamic terrorists with a ludicrous one, neo-Nazis.  I don't expect Hollywood to produce uniformly jingoistic movies like John Wayne's much-ridiculed ""Green Berets"" but the failure to produce at least several movies about terrorism where the enemy is plainly defined as what it is in reality --al-Qaeda-- is inexcusable.

That's why I found ""the Kingdom"" so refreshing.  The movie is a sort of reimagining of the horrific 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia.  As people familiar with that atrocity recall, the US did not get ""closure,"" some baddies were executed by the Saudis but the people --very likely the Iranians-- who pulled the strings got off scot free.

""The Kingdom"" takes this scenario and does a sort of ""what if the FBI had been able to get over to Saudi Arabia while the trail was still fresh and been able to actually get some of the major bad guys""? As such, it is one part police procedural, one part ""fish out of water,"" and one part, slam bang action thriller (the Iranians are replaced with al-Qaeda).  As such, I found it very satisfying.

The stars in the movie all do a good job and that includes the Saudi police officer who helps the FBI agents get their men.  The special effects are high quality and the realism is greatly enhanced by the fact that the film was shot in the United Arab Emirates.

The film is not perfect:

1.  As a man, I enjoy Jennifer Garner wearing a tight-fitting t-shirt a great deal, I just think that in real-life, she would have worn less flattering clothes given the Saudi sensibilities about women.

2.  The FBI agents come across as a little too insensitive to their hosts at time.

3.  I somehow doubt that the FBI agents would have been able to get into Saudi Arabia without the express permission of the US Embassy.

4.  The principles of ""evil marksmanship"" are in force. The bad guys sometimes seem to have a very hard time hitting things.

5.  The ""inexhaustible supply of ammunition"" rule is in effect.  Given the way that the heroes blast away on full automatic, they'd have to be changing and changing magazines in real-life.

6.  The terrorists seem to be able to put together a very sophisticated attack against the FBI team extremely rapidly.  Normally, terrorist attacks take a very long time to set up (September 11 incubated over several years).

But these are all minor quibbles.  I only hope that given the apparent success of ""the Kingdom,"" Hollywood makes a few more like it.  For example, why not do a film that shows the CIA and Special Forces teams in 2001 in Afghanistan bringing the Taliban down and killing a lot of al-Qaeda bad guys?  I bet that would be a very popular film. I know I'd see it.",1191715200,7,3489,4.670491803278688
3012595,4,B000Y7WGP6,"After a brief, graphic enhanced look at the history of ""The Kingdom"", a terrorist group attacks a Western housing complex in Saudi Arabia. The families are playing a game of softball in what they believe is a protected area, heavily guarded. But the terrorists disguise themselves as Saudi Police, get in, cause a lot of havoc and cost a lot of American lives. The State department, led by Attorney General Gideon Young (Danny Huston) is reluctant to send anyone in and FBI Director James Grace (Richard Jenkins) follows the edict. But Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) knows he has to get his team there yesterday; the longer they wait, the less chance they have of recovering any evidence. He meets with and manages to convince the Saudis it is in their best interest to allow the team into the country, onto their soil. Fleury takes Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), the FBI's munitions expert, Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), their intelligence expert and Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman), their internet and web guy. There, they meet Colonel Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), a member of the Saudi police, who has been personally charged by the Prince to care for the Americans, and his assistant Sergeant Haytham (Ali Sulman). On the ground, they face a number of restrictions until they are finally able to take a look and start to convince people they are serious about their investigation.

""The Kingdom"", directed by Peter Berg (a former TV actor who now directs TV and movies, ""Friday Night Lights"") and written by Matthew Michael Carnahan, is a surprisingly effective thriller. Combining a number of different styles of film, ""Kingdom"" works a large percentage of the time and manages to paint a portrait evocative of the problems we have in that part of the world. It isn't a perfect film, but what it gets right, it does well.

Despite a couple of heavy action moments, the film really strives to be a political thriller. And it succeeds. The opening moments, a graphical ""Complete Idiot's Guide"" to the history of the Kingdom, manage to quickly paint a portrait of the constant back and forth shaping the history, politics and landscape of this region. This is both a necessary and effective way to set up the environment the American FBI team will encounter when they arrive in Saudi Arabia. No one wants them to go there because they are very concerned about our relationship with the Saudis and the flow of oil from their country to ours. When they arrive, they are told they may walk through the crime scene, but not touch anything or remove anything. Of course, this will hamper their investigation, so it meets with some resistance. Once they arrive on the scene, Damon Schmidt (Jermey Piven), from the State Department drives up ready to intercept, and immediately begins to make arrangements for them to leave. He can't see any good from their visit, so he rushes them from one site to the next. As we watch all of this, it makes sense and further reinforces what we are learning about the history of the region and, more importantly, our involvement in the shaping of this history. Then, in the film's final moments, these previous scenes really pay off with a resonance you won't soon forget.

From the moment they arrive in Saudi Arabia, the American FBI team is escorted by Colonel Al Ghazi. There is a reason for this. The Americans are not safe and as much as the Saudis don't want them in their country, if they were harmed in the Kingdom, it would be disastrous. So the Colonel is a babysitter, restricting their every move.

During the course of their visit, the terrorists strike against the FBI team and this sets off a series of action packed events. The team races after the terrorists, chasing them in cars into an unsafe area, filled with people sympathetic to the cause of Abu Hams, the Bin Laden wannabee. Then, when they can drive no further, they chase the terrorists through buildings and continue the search.

These scenes are exciting and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The threat level and danger are constant and very raw and don't let up, reminding me of some of Michael Mann's work. Mann is one of the producers on this film and his influence is clear.

Jamie Foxx is good, but a bit one note. His one motivation is to find out who committed this crime and bring them to justice. After they arrive in Saudi Arabia, he naturally spends a lot of time with Colonel Al Ghazi, and as is dictated by films like this, they come to respect one another, forming a form of friendship, a bond.

Early in the film, as Fleury learns of the attack, he is at his son's school answering questions from the Kindergarten class. As he tries to get the right permissions to make the trip, we see a few interactions with his son, who is so darn cute and asks things like ""What did the bad men do?"" I think these scenes are meant to give Foxx's character more humanity, but they are way too Action Movie 101 to be successful. Every action film ever made has some variation of this type of scene.

Fleury's son may also be intended as a counterpoint to a character we meet later, Abu Hamza's granddaughter. But this doesn't exactly work. As the film progresses, the granddaughter actually becomes a reflection of, a counterpoint to, Janet Mayes, Jennifer Garner's character.

In fact, each of the characters is a bit one note. Jennifer Garner plays Janet Mayes, an FBI agent who has a personal stake in the attack; one of her mentors was killed. In Saudi Arabia, she looks as determined and grim as Foxx's character. She also must deal with the fact she is a woman, while operating in a country where women have few if any rights.

First of all, would anyone actually send Mayes to partake in such an investigation? Her involvement with one of the victims would seem to prejudice her and call her impartiality into question.

Chris Cooper is the Agent Who Has Seen It All, the munitions expert who wants, needs to get into a hole and dig around in the mud. He also laughs and shakes his head anytime someone says something that doesn't add up. He has the sort of ""Aw shucks"" attitude we generally see in Hollywood movie Country Folk. But he is smart as a whistle.

Jason Bateman's Adam Leavitt is the most original of the characters. During a briefing, he makes it abundantly clear that an FBI team should be in the Kingdom yesterday, yet when he is on the plane, he is a bit shocked to find himself headed into a dangerous part of the world. He doesn't want to be there and wants to get out of there as soon as possible.

Ashraf Barhom plays Colonel Al Ghazi. Initially, his character holds a lot of promise. He watches an interrogation of one of his men, clearly having trouble with the techniques being employed. He allows the interrogation to continue, to a certain point. Later, as he and Fleury start to build a relationship and bond, his character becomes a pretty stereotypical for this sort of film as well. Doesn't every action film have the gruff-by-the-book character that will eventually warm up the main characters and become an ally?

As stereotypical and one-note as the characters are, the film still works. It provides an interesting look at the situation in this part of the world, using a single event to provide an entry into the history, politics and people of ""The Kingdom"". And it has some fantastic action sequences.",1191628800,,7350,4.661265432098766
3012596,2,B000Y7WGP6,"This would have been a good action thriller except for the unsteady nauseating camera work, along the whole length of the movie,it spoiled it, you eventualy get sore eyes and feel sick, I am not sure what was the intention , it opened in Australia today,and that was a common complaint.",1191369600,,286,4.627450980392157
3012597,3,B000Y7WGP6,"Let's start with this:""The Kingdom"" is consistently involving,sets are filled with an enormous amount of realism and detail,and is a far cry from Peter Berg's debut in 'Very Bad Things"".There is one outstanding performance of mention from the Middle Eastern actor Ashraf Barhom (""Paradise Now"" and ""Syrian Bride"")as Colonel Al Ghazi who expertly portrays a sympathetic Saudi police officer who finds himself fixed between two completely irreconcilable  cultures. It is Colonel Al Ghazi's story and character that is of interest to me. Terrorists bombs kill scores of American oil workers and Arab families at a U.S. base in Al Ghazi's homeland. The character of Al Ghazi is the only truly fleshed-out character in Berg's film. Actor Barhom's face and voice  powerfully evoke a spiritual conviction positively arresting as he struggles to stand between both Americans and Saudis. I hope Barhom gets an Oscar nod. Berg has developed Al Ghazi and is good at  the group interactions.
Now...for the rest of the film and acting I am more reticent to say much for fear of the dreaded ""unhelpful marks"" that will fling forth;so I will leave with a set of pluses about ""The Kingdom"" and .....oh heck...I've got to say it...this film reminded me of Sly Stallone in ""Rambo"" trying to meet the sophistication of George Clooney in ""Syriana""-action in Arabia! Berg also has given no substance or distinction to his other characters that he has given to Al Ghazi...or could it be it that the American stars simply cannot measure up to their Middle Eastern counterpart? I found that the movie was uneven in what it was intended to be:an action story,a political thriller,a consciousness film or a dilemma of incompatible thinking. I'll take it as a great acting job by Barhom and one character and his conflict that will go to the Academy's attention! At least that is what I will remember from this film,not much else.
Pluses and minuses equals three stars for me;so it's OKAY,but not worth another trip back to the Middle East.",1191110400,,2013,4.967359050445104
3012598,4,B000Y7WGP6,"Many of the reviews I've read of THE KINGDOM comment on how appropriate or not it is to make what is essentially an action-thriller against the setting of modern terrorism.  The hidden implication of these criticisms is that ""it's not okay to make a movie showing a horrific act of terrorism, and these acts being avenged, because the current war on terror is so wrong.""  Oh, REEEAAAALLLLLYYYYY???

If I remember correctly, over the past few decades, there have been groups of Muslim terrorists who kill and maim innocent Americans and other ""foreigners"" with great glee.  Yet Hollywood has relished depicting our efforts to root out such criminals/terrorists/mass-murderers with disdain.  Now I'm the first to admit that war is an ugly thing, that many mistakes have been made in the latest war and that the goal of ""eliminating"" terrorism may be a stretch, to say the least.  But I also remember the huge truck bomb in Beirut, the USS Cole, and some attacks on the World Trade Center.  I think it's okay to show that a part of the American experience might include investigating acts of terrorism and then hunting down and destroying the perpetrators.

Films like JARHEAD, IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH, etc. tell us that we'd all be better off if we just brought the troops home.  Movies like UNITED 93 remind us that we were acted in our own land.  A movie like THE KINGDOM reminds us that terror against Americans can strike anywhere, and it dares to suggest that we can actually fight back.  I had no real problem with its ""politics""...aside from a tacked-on and silly ending that implied some moral equivalency between the terrorists and the FBI's efforts to hunt them down.

Okay, politics aside now.  How was the movie?  It was pretty darn good.  The acts of terror that start the film are credible and terrifying.  The FBI team that is more or less snuck into Saudi Arabia to investigate are a bit unlikely (of all the people they could have brought, was bring a woman the best choice?)  But our stars (Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) do intense work and take it all very seriously.  They spend a lot of time being frustrated at the red-tape that is constantly in their way.  But what I liked is that the movie showed them gradually winning the trust of a couple of Arab police men...men who are equally outraged at the destruction the terrorists have wrought.  There is nice interplay between the Americans and Saudis...occasionally it is a bit cliched and predictable...but it never teeters into the maudlin or God-forbid ""buddy comedy"" mode.  Because the action of the movie moves along briskly, there isn't really time for subtle characterization.  Foxx is the tough-talking leader (and the least convincing character, actually), Garner is the woman that all the Arabs are outraged at, Bateman is Jewish and a smart-mouth, so naturally he has some problems fitting in and Chris Cooper is Chris Cooper...which is a good thing...that guy is just so darn interesting to watch all the time.

Most of the movie is really just leading us to the final 30 minutes or so, when the little group of investigators falls under attack.  And holy smokes, is that stuff exciting.  It is super tense and hurtles along at breakneck speed.  With the jumpy hand-held camera work, fast editing, terrific sound editing and lots of bullets flying and bodies dropping...it gets your adreneline going.  Everything leading up to this has been entertaining and interesting, but it's the end of the movie where you get a great payoff.

Since this is a Hollywood production, the script does occasionally get predictable, and Jamie Farr has some scenes in which he relates with little kids that are really pretty silly.  Not because Farr can't talk to kids, but he just says stuff to them that no one in real life would.  So yes, like almost every movie ever made, we are being manipulated somewhat.  But for the most part, the movie does it successfully.  Does it exploit the war on terror simply to entertain?  There's nothing simple about that question...I WAS entertained...but I was also reminded of the grim fact that we need people fighting the war on terror.",1191110400,,4171,4.813202247191011
3012599,5,B000Y7WGP6,"Watching late night television over the last week or so has pretty much seen Jamie Foxx covering the circuit promoting The Kingdom, and frankly worrying me because of the hard sell.  Additionally, he mentioned on one of the shows that it was partly filmed in Arizona, which also worried me as the previews really made it appear to be the middle east.  In any case, I swallowed my preconceived notions and went to see it this evening.  Not a criticism, but when the movie opens in the middle east, Ashrof Barhom (Colonel Farish) should get top billing.  He is a spendid actor and gave a beautiful, understated performance which is not to take anything away from Jamie Foxx or the rest of the cast who were also quite good.  One more action/adventure film, and a new academy award category should be opened to compete The Kingdom with The Bourne Ultimatum, and Live Free or Die Hard, three, so far, exceedingly entertaining movies that certainly give you your money's worth.",1190937600,2,972,4.727810650887574
3012600,3,B000Y7WGP6,"I'm really not sure how I feel--or rather, how I should feel--about Peter Berg's ""The Kingdom."" It opens with a softball game in Saudi Arabia and ends with the assertion that war, hatred, and intolerance are much more complex than most would like to believe. Not only does this seem manipulative, it also seems like a message we've been given before. But when you stop and think about it, there are hardly any original messages left in war movies. They usually achieve one of two things: they either instill compassion by showing a clear divide between allies and enemies, or they prominently feature battle, blood, and death to drive home the point that enemies are more alike than different. I honestly don't know which category ""The Kingdom"" falls under; there were moments when I thought I knew, but as the scenes progressed, my mind kept changing. By the end, I was more confused than anything else.

The opening softball game takes place in a Saudi Arabian military compound, in which American soldiers are stationed along with their families. As the game continues, the compound is attack by Islamic extremists--dozens are gunned down, and dozens more fall victim to suicide bombers. In response, a special FBI task force is sent in with specific instructions to find the mastermind behind the attack and put him to justice. The Special Agents consist of: Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx), Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), and Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman). Every one of these characters is broadly developed, suggesting a misguided belief in clichs. Both Fleury and Mayes are gung ho and mad as hell because one of their colleagues was lost in the attack. Sykes' Southern drawl is second only to his ability to dig through mud. Leavitt is the timid, wisecracking one, serving no real purpose other than to be annoying.

They team up with Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), an officer of Saudi Arabia's military. As might be expected, there is some serious culture clash at play, especially since Al Ghazi doesn't speak fluent English. As might also be expected, Fleury and Al Ghazi become friends; I understand that such a thing is possible in real life, but I have a hard time believing that the makers of ""The Kingdom"" weren't relying on a convenient plot device. In a film like this, nothing much is gained from an international friendship. It exists only for cathartic reasons, giving the audience something to feel good about in the midst of a bad situation. In this case, a war between democracy and fundamentalism is being fought--this is obviously a lot to feel bad about.

But the relationship between Fleury and Al Ghazi unfairly plays against the negativity. There's no depth or meaning to their friendship; it's nothing but an excuse to be poignant and sentimental. To elaborate on this would give too much away, so let's just say that the ending reiterates the message that tolerance is a distant goal. This message has been firmly established in the minds of the movie going public, so firmly, in fact, that it's practically become a convention of war movies. And when such a message is paired with needlessly sappy imagery, I can't help but feel conned. Example: Mayes, a lollipop junky, offers one of her lollipops to a Saudi Arabian girl no more than seven years old. Something so melodramatic doesn't belong in a film like this.

Still, it would be too harsh to say that this film is a complete failure. Indeed, it has moments of effectiveness, such as inter cut shots of terrorists constructing homemade bombs. To watch this footage is to be reminded that such people actually exist, which helps to firmly ground the audience in reality. One can't help but wonder the thoughts going through their heads: Despite what they're brainwashed to believe, are they really ready to take their own lives? After all, they're human beings above all else--the terrorist ideology comes later.

If only ""The Kingdom"" could fully support such thought provoking material. This film tries so hard to be humanistic that it only becomes fatalistic, and this is bad because I knew that its heart was in the right place. Peter Berg shows promise as a filmmaker, especially since his projects are very character-oriented (""Friday Night Lights,"" for example). But something was missing from ""The Kingdom,"" something that prevented it from being a compelling drama. Even Jeremy Piven as an American ambassador to Saudi Arabia doesn't help things much, especially since his character is so briefly featured. I think what's missing is the willingness to be daring; a shootout occurs near the end of the film, and despite being violent, graphic, and difficult to watch, it felt restrained and incomplete. If a movie like this wants to send a clear, important message to its audience, then I'm afraid restraint is not going to work.",1190937600,,4855,4.937576499388005
3012601,2,B000Y7WGP6,"The Kingdom is a mediocre movie about a somewhat suspenseful and violent FBI mission to find the culprits of a terrorist attack on Americans in Saudi Arabia.

This film is a cross between a boring CSI episode and evening news videos of violence in the Middle East. The Hollywood hype about a great ending doesn't materialize in my opinion  The acting is not impressive, Jamie Fox and his Saudi counterpart speak low and mumble in some scenes, so you have to listen carefully to understand the dialog.

Our sad emotions about the brave Americans who lost their lives in the Middle East and on 9/11 (we lost a young serviceman from my city two weeks ago from a roadside bomb in Iraq, and several people from my city were killed on 9/11) won't allow us to completely dislike this film due to the revenge aspect of it, but this is not I movie I would recommend.",1190937600,2,857,4.480769230769231

Here in the real world, Saudi Arabia is ruled by a reactionary Islamic regime that is tied to a 7th century-style ""culture of the desert."" It has been a breeding ground for a variety of reasons for Islamic terrorists, including most of the 9/11 hijackers.

3012709,4,B000Y7WGP6,"I am naturally attracted to films that showcase how the world works especially in nations far away from the United States such as Saudi Arabia. This is where this film is based in and as you will find out by watching The Kingdom that Saudi Arabia works way differently than the United States. One unique aspect of this film versus all of its fellow action thriller films is that a backstory was developed as to how each character got to where they were prior to the film's events.

3012748,4,B000Y7WGP6,"I'll start off by saying get the DVD as the extras are well worth it. The behind-the-scenes look at various scenes from the viewpoint of each character was excellent as was the lengthy look at how the big action scenes were put together. Even better is the history lesson on Saudi Arabia that starts off the movie was expanded in the extras with an easy-to-follow timeline.

The movie itself is a well-crafted thriller that is very topical in that it encompasses the war on terror but told from the viewpoint of all sides and also as it takes place in a nation not under war but certainly the locus of much of what is going on in the Middle East. The twists are very good as is the process and how we get there.

The cast is first-rate right down to every extra in this. Special kudos to the two guys who play the main Arabian cops. Also, is Jamie Fox in a bad movie ever. I mean the guy really knows how to pick his roles and find ones that fit him perfectly. A big surprise is Jason Bateman playing against comedic type and showing, hey, this guy can act. I look forward to more Bateman in roles like this (and his asides in the extras are classic as well).

Lastly, I get the Friday Night Lights' Permian Football or Panthers T-shirts director Peter Berg wore in the extras but I was trying to figure out the New York Giants' one as I associate him with Texas because of the Friday Night Lights movie. Then I see he's from NYC. Got it.",1475971200,,1438,4.26007326007326

3012880,5,B000Y7WGP6,"Last time I saw Jamie Foxx was in Annie. This ain't that. The first two acts are almost documentary style, jerky, too much hand-held, walking through parallel disasters - Saudi Arabia where the good Saudis and bad Saudis are almost indistinguishable, and the State Department, which is run by idiots (we knew that).

Foxx plays Fleury, an FBI investigator who, when one of his friends is killed fights to go to Saudi Arabia with his small team to ""observe"" the investigation, with both hands tied behind their backs, while the Saudi's investigate a horrible bombing of an American oil worker baseball game with hundreds of dead and injured. The pace is slow, the frustration builds while they gradually gain some freedom to do their job and hunt the chief terrorist. It is a political disaster, no one wants the Americans there, not them, not us.

The guy who plays Faris, their Arab keeper, should get a statue, he is so good. Finally, in the 3rd act, as they are trying to get to the airport, being extracted (they don't want to leave) after a small insignificant victory, the film comes to life (Michael Mann was one of the producers and probably recognized they were in trouble). Foxx channels his inner Denzel/Jack Bauer and the third act takes off. The ending is about as existential as it gets, very satisfying. Considering that this is an 07 film, nearly ten years before Benghazi, there is a whole other dimension to watching it post-Benghazi. If I were the studio I would re-release it.  This is a much better film than The Hurt Locker, in my opinion. I can't comment on 13 Hours of Benghazi as I've not seen it yet.

I should mention Jennifer Garner, of whom I am NOT a fan. She does not embarrass herself here. She fits into the team and does a solid job, far better than Emily Blunt in Sciracha or whatever that film.

Foxx is terrific and I hope he gets a chance to do more work like this. He is entirely credible. There are tiny little moments of humor, really subtle, in the interplay between he and Faris, and his emotional arc from tragedy to tragedy is powerful, but never scenery chewing. Highly recommended with the proviso that the pacing of the first two acts may be a bit frustrating.",1460764800,3,2208,4.593908629441624

I was sad for the politics and difficulty of trying to solve problems with American standards in a Muslim country.  I think it is beautifully directed, and it flows easily from scene to scene.

3012941,5,B000Y7WGP6,"I though this was a great movie with good actors and solid plot.  The action builds and delivers, giving you that near-perfect blend of tension, dread and feel-good moments.  It also tells a narrative that isn't explored much in modern day ""war"" films.  The cinema is good, and edgy in all the right places.  I also appreciate the liberal use of AKM's/AK-74's as the characters' main fighting weapons.  In so many shows and movies, I see AK's flopped around and held away from the shoulder, as if you are EVER going to hit anything that way.  This movie shows proper shouldering and tactical technique amongst the use of most of the weapons in the movie.  The only other show I've seen that does the AK justice is Strikeback.

Good movie and worth the < $10 price tag",1425340800,,767,4.547445255474453

Yes, there are a few Hollywoodisms scattered here and there, but overall excellent.  I definitely will not call this a fun film. It is not.  It is disturbing and heart rending in some scenes.

3012962,5,B000Y7WGP6,"This is a film about an American oil company with housing for families (women, children, parents, etc.) living in a compound in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  It is allegedly loosely based on a real incident (very loosely). The housing complex is bombed by Islamic bad guys,  The movie starts off a little slow a the start, and then it picks up and never stops.  By about half way through the movie, the action is nonstop, and totally engrossing. The acting is great by Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman and the rest of the cast, but with a particularly impressive job done by Chris Cooper and the remarkable Ashraf Barhom (who recently starred in the tv series TYRANT).

Think Casablanca, think ""A Bridge Too Far"", think ""Taking of Pelham 1-2-3""--

but can't give it 5 stars--I just find Jamie Fox's deadpan style too bland--his delivery is just one-note for the most part...
Jennifer Garner and Chris Cooper are way better. Plus I love her grit and the fight in the apartment--and her compassion afterwards. Jason Bateman's fear after being captured is rivetingly true, and Piven who plays a Foreign Office aid is just good comic relief---
The true star (to me) is the Saudi police liaison paired with the FBI team---his disgust at the actions of a military superior speaks volumes at the ""way things work"" in the labyrinth of social and religious rules governing the way people live and work in today's Saudi Arabia...
I bought it because it is a ""go to"" movie--something I can watch and enjoy when I need to do ironing and there isn't anything else on...that is not really high praise to some people probably--but a movie that you don't grow tired of is something out of the ordinary...",1397779200,2,1183,4.770731707317073

3013058,4,B000Y7WGP6,"There's a depth of the subject matter, the culture, and the cultural differences that is rare in this genre.  Thoughtful character development with realistic & dimensional personalities.

My biggest complaints are the extensive and often unnecessary faux documentary-style hand-held work and the impatient editing.  Thankfully, the emo guitar ambient score is left for the most part until the end.  I'm not entirely sure what vibe they're trying to go for with it... maybe a lackadaisical, somber, exhausted tone.  Reflective of the emotions or the heat?  It's not terribly distracting as it was in the beginning of Lone Survivor.

While The Kingdom accurately shows the political difficulties of ever even being allowed to investigate, it somewhat side-steps the historical patterns of disinformation and inevitable ulterior finger-pointing that misdirect and obscure the true origins of much of this violence.  This can make it seem a touch nave when it does find uncompromised allies.  It's a movie, after all.

I thought the movie was great and gives insight as to why the mid-east issue is so hard to resolve. Pay close attention to the last minute of the movie, or you'll miss one of the key answers to the problem. Jamie Foxx, while I may differ with his views on the Zimmerman case I think it was a HORRIBLE TRADEGDY, A VERY COMPLEX issue, and a razor thin call --- that reasonable people with different live experiences could see differently. But NO DOUBT he continues to earn my respect for his acting ability. Ray earned him a well deserved Academy Award, Any Given Sunday - He was amazing, The Soloist should have won him another award, an unlike some actors who tend to play similar characters time and again his range is just incredible. Two of the next movies I'll see are White House Down and Django Unchained, just because he is those movies. Rent or buy The Kingdom, you won't be disappointed.",1377820800,,991,4.450549450549451

As a man who worked on many law enforcement investigations, I can tell you that this story not only shows one how investigators investigate, but also shows you  the frustrations of conducting some investigations.

3013084,5,B000Y7WGP6,"My first viewing of THE KINGDOM was in bits and pieces on a cable station. A friend suggested that I watch the film in its entirety. And so I did.
I found the film extremely informative through Jamie Fox's narrative. He is on a mission but finds it important to explain to the audience a short historical backvround to help us better understand his role. This was of great help to me as my knowledge of Saudi Arabia was the ""cliff note variety"". This short narrative in the beginning of the movie was short but very informative and helped me understand the significance and necessity of what was to come.
It was.an action movie were one does need to understand what was to come. I thought the introduction clever so we could separate this type of action from other action films that for the most part are interchangeable from one and anothers plot.
There is one scene which is violent (shooting) but very complex from a technical point of view. I kept rewinding to see were all the editiing took place. There were several characters (supposedly the.good guys)  each with a task that deemed.impossible to film without the use of many cameras focused on each actor. It really was done nicely without all the computer generated imagining. Im not a fan of gun play but this scene.really seemed to be thought out by the.director and others Im sure.
Jamie Fox was enjoyable to watch as well as to listen to (that early narrative that I found very informative).This is certainly not a one shot film. I surprisingly enjoyed a film that I thought was going to be repetitive of so many films on hard core action films. A good script and an interesting cast if I may add another thought or two.
I am just being reminded that some dvds do break that action scene down in their extras. Huh!",1375574400,,1777,4.553125
3013085,5,B000Y7WGP6,"GREAT movie!!  Jamie Foxx is the real deal in here.  He has a starring role but is truly not the only star.  I love the premise, writing, and action sequences.

There is a lot of violence in the movie and it is definitely not what many would call a ""feel good movie."" A lot of people who don't like this movie may not like it because of the violence and deaths and because it may remind them of the many frailties of people in this messed up world that we live in. I for one, whenever I see a movie like this I am grateful for the life I have and it makes me appreciate even more those that I call friends and family.

3013089,4,B000Y7WGP6,"This film shows a realistic account of the very real brutality and threat American citizens will and have faced living in Saudi Arabia. When a peaceful afternoon gathering of American families in a Saudi Arabian park for a picnic are ambushed and shot at randomly, the sheer impact of the attack which killed men, women, and children- sparks an international media storm. The FBI send a investigative team to Saudi Arabia to see the site of the attack and interview people who may be able to help them find the terrorists involved in the brutal killings. Aided by the Saudi police, the FBI team led by Janie Foxx's character must work hand in hand with Saudi police and government officials to find and apprehend those people responsible for the brutal attack. Neither the Americans or the Saudi police trust one another. But as their time together passes they begin to respect the values and lives of one another, and they soon take the focus off the lack of trust they have for each other and devote a more determined search for the terrorists who committed the horrible killings during the ambush. The detail of the Saudi people, their police and investigative strategy, their governmental policies toward American citizens are presented here in very convincing ways, and the result is extremely intense, and believable. There is plenty of action in this movie and it is executed superbly. I don't feel this movie is the next big 'Blackhawk Down' but it is above average, effective, often unique and refreshingly intense. stay with me.",1371772800,2,1538,4.896551724137931

3013102,5,B000Y7WGP6,"I disagree with Amazon's saying the KINGDOM script is 'so-so'. Like everything involved with this superb, unique film, it's sharp, tight, gritty and true to life and death in Saudi Land.

Start to finish, THE KINGDOM is tense, unpredictable, often painfully realistic. With massive frustration, clashing civilizations/beliefs, politics. It will change your understanding of what prompted and perpetuates the bloody war in the Mideast. Seldom do we get entertainment so insightful.

Acting and direction are superb, with real issues, natures and locations adding urgency and emotions to propel your experience. Get ready to tremble, get mad, sad, and truly appreciate our soldiers (but not Gov bureaucrats).

I've seen military action, been shot, got blood splattered on me, saw men die, learned about who are America's friends and enemies. This is a vivid portrait of what this war is like. No spoiler: It is awful; unclear, complex and horrific.

Not for children. Parts can even leave adults gasping.

ANOTHER amazing movie about cultural conflicts is WARRIORS OF THE RAINBOW; if you have BluRay, see their expanded version:

(I first bought the DVD, then went to BluRay. T'was well worth the higher price.

Subtitle dialogue is short and simple, understanding's easy - actions speak louder than words here. Short subtitles work well with stunning,
exciting visuals you've never seen before. You will be awed. Even the 'making of' section, is superb showing that the film crew faced in their production of such a unique movie. And an hour long, maybe more. It's very-well produced.

Its subject/message is very important to know, especially now. John Woo produced this unforgettable film, made in Taiwan where it actually took place. Just check it out; Hollywood can't get close to all it offers. (I've seen it 4-5 times; every time, better. I'm sure to see it again.)

Also, I am quite surprised: Amazon's Product Description of WOTR is misleading; they cite inter-tribal belief conflicts as the key element of the plot; not so (such was a much smaller part of the plot than the ceding of all tribes' lands to the Japanese as part of diplomacy in 1945)",1366675200,,2466,5.62533692722372

The movie also reinforces the stereotype that Arabs are maniacal killers that are hell bent on killing Americans. The truth is, the Arabs do not want Hollywood filth destroying their culture as it has done to the USA and Europe and are willing to take a stand when ignorant Ameritard culture invades their country (think jerry springer). It was refreshing to see the running michael moore lookalike doing a head over head when the jeep driver stiched him with the 16. The movie has some very good action scenes except that the RPG shots are really fake looking. The beginning of the movie gives a brief history of oil discovery in Arabia and mentions the 73 oil embargo. What it does not say is that Henry Kissenger engineered the 73 oil embargo in order to give the dollar petro backing since they had just broke from the gold standard in 71. They then engineered a fake war in 73 so that
the oil companies could say that the Arabs are punishing the USA for helping the Israelis. This was thoroughly discussed at Bilderberg during that year in Sweden. This is a good movie if you are a thinker,another movie that is recommended is ""Wag The Dog"".",1344816000,,1417,4.626984126984127

3013138,5,B000Y7WGP6,"A fast moving Iraq-War-era military action thriller.

An FBI team is sent to Saudi Arabia for a 5 day trip to investigate the head of a terrorist network who killed two FBI agents. Special Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) heads the team rounded off by a hand-picked team of professionals: Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), and Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman). On the Saudi side, Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom) who escorts the FBI team in Saudi completes the cast.

The film captures the explosive pressures, the reluctant Saudi-American ""cooperation"" and love-hate relationship, and plots that bubble behind the scenes very well. This is an environment where you cannot trust a whole lot of people, including the Americans who live down there. Fear weighs as heavy as the heat.

As the FBI team gets off the plane, we hope and pray that they have what it takes to complete the mission successfully. This is a country of fast moving SUVs with darkened windows and constant monitoring, and tailing, and non-stop 24 hour vigilance. And every object can be another bomb with fuse ticking.

The camera is a character in itself in this movie. As it cuts from one close shot to another we are drawn into the heart of intrigue. A car approaching... is it friendly or not? A truck passes in the other lane, in the other direction. Did it stop and make a U-turn? These are all the things that need to be watched closely. Security requires a healthy dose of insanity as well.

After the team walks into a hornet's nest of an ambush and fights its way out, we realize that this crew has what it takes; they are the best in what they do. As Washington bureaucrats push and shove for political brownie points (with Danny Huston as Attorney General), the FBI team down in Saudi bravely sets out to do what they were tasked to do: to find the head of the network who took the lives of two of their friends.

The State Dept rep Damon Schmidt (played by Entourage's Jeremy Piven) adds another level of complexity by his shallow efforts to manage and streamline the whole operation while shamelessly attempting to take full credit for its success.

In the end, the mission is accomplished but at a great human cost, and with lingering ambivalence about the worth of the whole exercise. Why? Because the head of the ""terror network"" turns out to be someone that you'd never associate with the word ""terror."" So goes the complexities of our new fiery world.

We're living in a very dangerous geopolitical fishbowl and this film underlines its nerve-wrecking realities with very agile camera work, non-stop action -- all filtered through a harsh bleached-out color palette. Recommended.",1325116800,,2694,4.790948275862069

3013147,5,B000Y7WGP6,"I have to admit I'm writing this in reaction to other reviews, both pro and con. I'd like EVERYBODY to see this film. To date, in my experience, this is the ONLY film that truly presents our basic conflict with the Middle East, and manages to do it as an explosively entertaining action film. Yet it is NOT, as others have suggested, ""about"" our actions in Iraq or Afghanistan-- it's called ""The Kingdom"" for a reason: it's about Saudi Arabia as a philisophical microcosm of the conflict. Here we have an ""ally"" who hates us as much as any of our declared enemies hates us, but through the weird perversions of history and economics, detailed in the beginning of the film, we have made them what they are, a land where over 5000 little boys can grow up to be princes. Just like Osama Bin Laden. And none of those in power want that to change any more than we do. And that's what leads to the basic conflict in the film: the faith-based politics of the Middle East versus the humanist-based politics of the West. In Berg's film, ""being a cop"" becomes the only common ground, carried to a fatalistic conclusion. I found the script, its execution, and especially the ending, to be nothing short of brilliant.",1306454400,,1205,4.532110091743119
3013148,3,B000Y7WGP6,"- but don't expect any in-depth look at the Middle East or Saudi Arabia.  This is an action-adventure gung-ho flag waver, and it's philosophy can best be summed up in the film's final admonition: ""Kill em all,"" and (presumably) adding, ""and let God sort em out.""  This is a propaganda call-to-arms in the ""war on terror."" Take it for what it's worth as an action movie.

That said, its attempt to be an over-the-top action flic backfires. The hand-held camera style is supposed to emphasize the you-are-there sensation, but it detracts from the action its supposed to depict.  As one reviewer said, it induces motion sickness for the first 10 minutes until your eyes adjust.  Likewise the often-mumbling, choppy dialogue: the purpose of dialogue is to speak to the audience, and trying to create some eavesdropping aura of ultra-reality compromises story continuity.  This is one of the major difficulties of realism vs. dramatic narrative - reality is just too messy for story-telling.  It needs structure, and so does this film.

Finally, for all its realism it does strain credibility at points.  An automatic-weapon firefight is just as likely (not) in downtown Houston as central Riyadh.  Jamie Foxx does good service with his Denzel Washington imitation; the other FBI characters are just cut-outs.  The post shoot-out scene of the female FBI agent passing a lollipop with blood-stained fingers to a native child is an eye-roller.

3013150,3,B000Y7WGP6,"Like The Hurt Locker, The Kingdom is about Americans in a foreign land, this time Saudi Arabia. After an innovative sequence retelling the tale of America's complicated relationship with Saudi Arabia, we witness an escalating series of suicide bomber attacks against an American oil company's housing compound.  The Kingdom never lets us forget that children's lives are at stake here, both American and Saudi, and that war exacts a terrible human cost.

Special Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) leads the charge to track down the terrorists responsible for the bombing.  He brings forensic examiner Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), intelligence analyst Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman), and bomb technician Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper) into Saudi Arabia by bending the rules of diplomacy and law.

What ensues is a boring investigation in which the American team is delayed at every turn.  There are issues with gender, challenges with the ruling monarchy, and good old government politics. Where The Hurt Locker was a knuckle-biting series of escalating mental and emotional challenges, The Kingdom is a slow drag through a frustrating series of roadblocks that, while they may be realistic, don't make for good storytelling.

After the good guys defeat the bad guys with a rote firefight, the American agents are ordered home - too easy, of course.  The real villains ambush our heroes as they depart and, after kidnapping poor Leavitt, helpfully lead the agents back to their lair and the man responsible for the bombing in the first place.

The most tender moments, and the best acting, are from the children and their fathers.  Foxx spends most of the movie angry, but he comes to life whenever he interacts with the kids.  Unfortunately, almost all of those interactions are to deliver the news about the death of the kid's father.

The Kingdom veers from trying to drive home the cultural differences of Saudi Arabia to a stereotypical terrorist plot complete with an attempted televised beheading.  When the same trope shows up in Syfy Channel's Sand Serpents, you know something's wrong.

The real story belongs to Colonel Faris al-Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), who straddles the fine line between doing his job and loyalty to his country. If The Kingdom gets something right, it's in portraying al-Ghazi as a hero, a soldier, and a father. And that's what The Kingdom is really about - the sins of the fathers visited upon their sons. I just wish it didn't take so long to make its point.",1296864000,2,2484,5.0440097799511
3013151,4,B000Y7WGP6,"I agree with other reviewers that this is a fantastic, non-stop action flick with never a dull moment.  Great story, finely drawn characters, and (most say no, I say yes) excellent script for an action movie.

While much is said about the talented Mr. Foxx, may I add how surprising and delightful Mr. Jason Bateman is turning out to be, not as the cute and boyish TV guy we are familiar with, but he is rapidly delevoping into a very charismatic and talented movie star/actor.  I was no huge fan of his but his screen presence is palpable.  So is that of Chris Cooper.  We know of course how magetic Garner and Foxx are.

Very engrossing flick from the talented Peter Berg.  Sadley talent does not negate naivete', for the take-home message here seems to ultimately be, simply this, just told in another (and insidious) way:  Why can't we all just get along so wars and terrorism can magically vanish if we just love one another.  And ***SPOILER ALERT MAY BE HERE:::****  in the end, the heroic efforts and motivations that propel the people who daily lay their lives on the line to try to protect all people, are equated with motivations of the actions of the bad guys.  Not so.  Mr. Peter Berg,  you made a really good movie, but your message is sadly uninformed to an almost child-like extent in this particular instance.

4 stars for a really good movie as entertainment, 1 star off for a message that is too naive to explain away.",1282348800,3,1436,4.536964980544747
3013152,5,B000Y7WGP6,"Despite the purposefully ambiguous ""kill them all"" message inserted into the script (more on that later), The Kingdom comes across as a very realistic action movie with delicate political and religious overtones.  Without extreme jingoism or political preaching, a picture of the Saudi Arabian kingdom - a possible metaphor for the Iraq war or Islam - is painted in which a culture clash between American FBI agents and oppositional Saudi officials is juxtaposed so that a common bond can be emotionally unearthed beneath the bloody rubble of a terrorist attack.

In a post-9/11 environment - a world that has since discovered the majority of the hijackers' were Saudi - the once strong bond between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia has weakened under tension.  After a brutal terrorist attack on ARAMCO civilians playing softball, several FBI agents - Ronald Fleurry (Foxx), Grant Sykes (Cooper), Janet Mayes (Garner), Adam Leavitt (Bateman) - are sent to the Middle East to cooperate with initially resistant local officials and find the responsible party in a small five-day window.  While clue hunting, respect between the various investigators is forged, as societal differences are overcome and eventually eschewed because of common bonds, similar foes, and shared emotions - particularly between FBI team lead Fleurry and Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Barhom).

From top to bottom this movie exudes realism.  The location is authentic; the debris smolders; the locals look confused, terrified, and angry.  The direction is crisp, keeping the viewer on the edge of the seat as soon as it is revealed the hunt is on for a terrorist explosives expert.  Action for the entire second half of the movie.  And the ending?  Woo, the ending is crazy.  A frenzy of gun-play with automatic fire ringing ears, the wet thwop of bodies receiving lead injections, and speaker-rumbling bass accompanying every bomb or RPG.

The script by Matthew Michael Carnahan is borderline genius.  How representatives of two foreign governments can come together so quickly, to bond so thoroughly, to display such shared emotion, all while suffering through nearly unspeakable blood and violence, and not feel forced or rushed, is incredibly complimentary for the script and actors who made the situations and relationships so believable.  While somewhat unbelievable at times, its flawless execution makes otherwise noticeable gaffs (Jennifer Garner's outfits in Saudi Arabia would have been frowned upon) disappear.

-----SPOILER (kinda)-----
I believe the phrase ""Kill them all"" spoken by the terrorist at the end is what he sees as proactive guidance in reference to his enemies, to kill them simply for who they are.  Conversely, I believe the phrase, when spoken by Jamie Foxx's character, is meant as a vow of revenge in the name of justice, to kill those who have already committed murders and atrocities.  In my view, the two are unequal, and serve as the primary reason for the tensions and dangers that currently exist.

3013153,5,B000Y7WGP6,"This is an out and out action film; my wife walked out after the first few minutes and didn't come back. I'll agree that it is violent but in the situations this film addresses, violence can and should be expected.

The film provides some interesting insights into life in the Middle East; although I've never been there, news reports and video clips over the past several years seem to confirm the use of violence as a negotiating tool. Life in the Middle East, and especially in Saudi Arabia, reflects a worldview that is diametrically opposed to Western thought.

The film is fast paced and moves toward an ending that even increases the pace of the action. As the film closes one is left with statements from both sides that indicate the struggle will continue; it is not just the individuals that are in opposition, but two opposing worldviews.

Historians who address this struggle are quick to point out the fact that the battle has been going on for centuries with greater or lesser intensity. It appears that the level of intensity has been increasing again for several years now.

Still, The Kingdom is a tightly written, well-directed, and highly explosive political action film. It doesn't have as much as action as, say, Hard Boiled or Face/Off, but it does give a very powerful message about terrorism and the negative perceptions about Islam and Muslims in general. This film doesn't disrespect Islam, but it does tell us about how people use religion as an excuse to get a point across.

3013168,4,B000Y7WGP6,"This film seemed interesting because it was set in Saudi Arabia and plays to the paranoia that most Americans have about the Middle East.  Jamie Fox, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are cast as FBI agents who are sent on a mission to discover who, exactly, attacked the American compound, killing innocent family members of oil executives.  Naturally they encounter obstacles as they get little cooperation from the Saudi government with the exception of a colonel, played by Ashraf Barhom, a family man himself with a sense of integrity and who really does his best to help the Americans.  That's the premise.

The film is full of those long chase and shoot-em-up scenes that are required in a modern geopolitical thriller such as this.  Perhaps they would have been more impressive in a theater, but they lose their effectiveness on a regular TV screen and I was soon bored with them.  The acting was adequate and what can be expected in a film like this but the most impressive performance was that of the Saudi Colonel whose humanity kept the film from falling into a formulaic good-guy - bad guy format.

Filmed in Arizona, the film did its best to recreate what Americans tend to think of as the Middle East. But why, then, was Jennifer Garner allowed to run around in bare arms and a bulletproof vest when while all other females in the cast were covered from head to toe in black burkhas?

I really shouldn't be reviewing this film because I'm just not into this type of a flick.  I therefore give it a mild recommendation as an action film set in an unusual location.  It didn't seem genuine to me but I know I'm not the target audience.",1248825600,,1662,4.622448979591836

3013176,4,B000Y7WGP6,"The Kingdom is a great film. Good story, good acting, & action packed. The movie is both visually & intellectually stimulating. Jamie Foxx, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner, & Chris Cooper, do an outstanding job portraying their FBI team characters. I only have one complaint: the cinematography is horrible! There is far too much ""lightning quick"" panning back & forth rapidly, fast closeups, very shaky hand held shots, and very fast cuts within scenes. It's as if they mounted a miniature camera on a fly, and had it fly and jump around the scene. If this is a new technique for films of this nature, I hope it is only a phase, and that it will soon fade away. The cinematography of Saving Private Ryan during the Omaha Beach landing was nowhere near what they do in The Kingdom (I could handle Private Ryan's cinematography). I'd like to be able to meet with director Peter Berg and ask him (in terms of cinematography), ""what the hell were you thinking?"" I'm assuming he was trying to convey chaos and urgency with the rapid camera movements and quick ever changing closeups thrown inbetween. All he did for me, was create a headache. The only thing that prevented me from turning off the film, was the film itself. So to sum up - Great film, bad cinematography.

3013178,3,B000Y7WGP6,"The powerful history of the United States' involvement in the Saudi Arabia flashes on the screen before the opening credits, creating a direct line from the past to the present day antagonism, and these moments are  the most affecting ones of this political thriller.  Jamie Foxx plays an FBI agent in charge of a small band of agents (Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Cris Cooper) investigating, without State Department approval, a Saudi bombing which has cost the lives of one of their friends and hundreds of civilians.  During the investigation, they are watched over by Saudi policeman, Faris Al Ghazi (Ashrof Barhom), a man assigned to control their every move in the spirit of protection.  Of course, this being a Hollywood thriller set in Saudi Arabia, the Americans take matters into their own hands to overcome bureaucracy and corruption and to pursue the villains.

Barhom plays his character with real humanity, and he steals every scene with his no-nonsense approach, tinged with idealism and hope for real justice.  The Americans all do competent acting jobs, although their roles seem too predictable given the plot.  The chase scenes are heart-stopping and somewhat over-the-top, but they keep this fast-paced flick moving from first moments to last.  The message driven home, that we are two peoples fighting and corrupting future generations, is laid over-the-top of what is an essentially go-blow-up-the-bad-guys plot. Nuances such as diplomacy, culture, and history are quickly lost in the gunfire.

Certainly, this film entertains the way the best in the genre does; however, it tries too hard at times and not hard enough at others.  I recommend this for a one-time viewing.

3013179,2,B000Y7WGP6,"The movie has many pluses, not the least of which is the set-up and the setting. The terrorist bombing of the Aramco compound in Saudi Arabia is certainly timely and plausible. The film opens with little documentary on the history of Aramco which sets the tone, but the history scene is without content, as is the film. The compound is bombed, but there is never any clear point made about who the bombers are or why they have targeted these residents. Instead the film focuses on issues of jurisdiction and bureaucracy, which could be made interesting, but here too we get nothing substantive. Every set-up simply pits one of the pugnacious FBI agents against his hapless guard who is attempting to carry out his duties. The American wants to be made an exception to every rule, seemingly in each instance totally ignorant of why rules exist or what customs are. The female agent, for example, insists on running around around in a tight t-shirt, as though she were too stupid to notice that every other woman in the country wears traditional garb. If you don't understand at the beginning of the film why the Saudis may want Americans out of the country, you certainly do at the end, although I don't think this is the film's intended message. The actors do a fine job of playing obnoxious, clueless cretins with a talent for forensics. Beyond that I see no differentiation in the acting. When the shooting starts, only the Saudis get killed, although the picture opens with lots of innocent Americans dying. There is lots of lashing out, temper tantrums, terribly crude language, which the Saudis rightly ask be curtailed, but in the end nothing whatever has been resolved. This is a classic of much ado about nothing.",1232841600,3,1721,4.778523489932886
3013180,3,B000Y7WGP6,"Peter Berg's The Kingdom does many things right but unfortunately it does many things wrong as well. As a political thriller/ police procedural it hits many of the right notes. It shows us that there are good people and bad people in all cultural situations.

The first two thirds of the film are quite good. A terrorist organization has attacked an American workers compound in Saudi Arabia and an elite FBI response team must get into the secretive country to find the criminals who planned the attack. The American team is led by Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) and includes a forensic expert (an underused Jennifer Garner); an intelligence expert (Jason Bateman) and an explosives expert(Chris Cooper). Once in country the team meets their Saudi counterparts  Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Ashrof Barhom) and Sergeant Haytham (Ali Suliman).
The two groups begin to build a relationship of trust that allows them to go after the terrorist leader and bomb maker, Abu Hamsa (Hezi Saddik).

Perhaps the geatest flaw with the film is that its last third becomes nothing more than an extended gun battle that wraps things up too easily for my tastes. The film ends on a note that the violence will continue as both sides are entrenched in a kill them all attitude. As stated Berg does any things right in this film but it could have been much better.

I viewed the HD disc that had excellent picture and sound. The special features included three deleted scenes in HD, an extended featurette on the car crash sequence, a detailed making of the film featurette, a timeline on events in the Middle East, and an excellent commentary by Berg.

The fight scene with Garner, Bateman, and the Saudi terrorist is as intense as anything ever captured on a film set.  Every time I watch this scene I'm pulled into the struggle.  My heart races, I get an adrenaline rush, and afterwards nearly cry. It's the intensity of the struggle for life at its barest form, devoid of explosions and special effects.

Ever seen The Witness? Harrision Ford finds himself in an Amish community, having to learn their ways and abide by their rules? You get a lot of that in The Kingdom, but it is done in very interesting and compelling ways.

As if mimicking stories from the headlines, the movie follows four FBI agents as they try to solve a number of terrorist actions in Saudi Arabia. They have five days but they're not allowed to work at night, they can't touch anything, especially Muslim bodies, and they have to be guarded at all times. The real story is how they overcome all of these restrictions and get the job done.

All of the performances are top-notch and believable. The story is well-crafted and tense. I actually watched it twice in one day and was just as drawn into it the second time as I was the first.

The biggest drawback to the movie is its name! We've got The Kingdom, The Kingdom of Heaven, the Forbidden Kingdom, and Indiana Jone's Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, to name a few.

3013191,5,B000Y7WGP6,"From its opening scenes, depicting the Kingdom of Saud and its turbulent modern history following the discovery of oil in its barren deserts, THE KINGDOM sets the table for a white-knuckling political/cultural thriller.  And director Peter Berg (so outstanding with 'Friday Night Lights') delivers a keeper, as an elite FBI team of investigators travels into the American compound in Riyadh to investigate the recent slaughter of numerous U.S. citizens--ostensibly perped by terrorists.  Berg successfully sets the pace, tone, and tension between the FBI team and their Saudi hosts, then moves the viewer full tilt into a hair-raising climactic action sequence that never takes its foot off the gas.

The cast is topnotch, headlined by Jamie Foxx as the FBI field commander.  Foxx is tough, no-nonsense, machismo, yet periodically lets down his guard to show a rippling of emotion and compassion.  Jennifer Garner plays the investigative team's forensics expert (and plays it convincingly), while FBI specialists Chris Cooper and Justin Bateman get to share the film's best lines.  Country crooner Tim McGraw is impressive in an extremely emotional cameo role, yet this cast is most enhanced by the performance of Ashraf Barhom.  Playing a Colonel in the Saudi national police--a Colonel in charge of the team's security--Barhom represents the contrast between his Arab culture and the West.  The tension is established from the onset, yet the story delves deep enough into Barhom's character to reveal a humane man with only the best, most honorable intentions.

This is a brutal, violent film--a film with an ending that will definitely raise eyebrows.  Yet when it comes to heart-pounding action, intrigue, and suspense--with a story that sprints to the finish line--THE KINGDOM is a thriller as good as it gets.

As The Kingdom moves along, Fleury and his crew find unlikely allies and traverse the local politics, leading up to an explosive finale.  With everything that The Kingdom does action-wise, it disappoints in it's script.

Send in the FBI... but this is the Hollywood FBI; Foxx spends a lot of his time looking cool in his shades, Cooper is the male agent who looks concerned all the time & Garner is the female agent who looks concerned all the time and Batemen plays his usual flippant character he's played since the 80's.  The political joke in reality and in the movie is the House of Saud would like to minimize the appearance of the U.S. & the West in Saudi Arabia although we still maintain corporate and military compounds in the country.  This of course inhibits our FBI team, but not enough to result in the inevitable Hollywood cliched ending.  You never really get a better understanding of the House of Saud, Western involvement in the Saudi Arabia or the common man's opinion towards either.  It's just cops & robbers in the Middle East.  There's no consistency in the model of weapons the FBI agents use and they look like people who've never been trained to hold weapons or work in a 3-4 person group (weird since Foxx was in ""Jarhead"").

I saw this on HBO yesterday. (I had never heard of it!) (I know I lead a sheltered life.)  To me it had the look and feel of a 'made for TV movie' (and I don't mean that in a bad way).  I thought it was a pilot for a new sort of FBI/CSI procedural series.  (Wishful thinking?)

I think it would be quite good though - just as that - as a TV series - hour long - doesn't need to be Jamie Foxx - although he was okay - doesn't need to be Jenifer Garner although she was fun - but Ashrof Barhom was fantastic - the guy was great - and so was Chris Cooper. (No one delivers a line like Chris Cooper!)

But really, couldn't this be a good TV series? Bring back (really they must!) Ashrof Barhom's character (with him playing it of course)(just write it as his death was faked) - put him on as an adviser to the team - defintely keep Chris Cooper's character (with Chris Cooper playing the role of course) - maybe he would be better as the leader of the team - fly them around the world as a special FBI team - punch up Janet Mayes - more cultural stuff - (with or without Jenifer Garner in the role - there are others I am sure who would be ok in the role but Jenifer Garner did a fine job as a sort of tough-guy Wonderwoman/Ripley(from Aliens)character) and we could see Adam Leavitt (with or without Bateman) be a lot more sophisitcated and involved with computers and wise-cracking.

Wouldn't a TV series with Chris Cooper and Ashrof Barhom be a smash hit - maybe they wouldn't be open to doing a TV series (movie careers and all that)but there really seems to be a lot of potential here for the small screen.

It could still be called The Kingdom - just send the team into assorted Mid-east countries with Ashrof Barhom's character as the guide and adviser.

With all CSIs rapidly self-destructing - there is really an opening for just this kind of series!

I think it would be good!

Since 9/11, the atmosphere in this closed country has completely changed.  America has always been Saudi's best friend, but since most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi, an uneasy tension has formed between the two peoples, especially inside the kingdom.  That said, this was a very entertaining action movie.  Peter Berg basically took a real life event, embellished it, and made it entertaining for an American audience.  His portrayal of ex-pats living in Saudi was fairly accurate, although we had much nicer housing than the Americans depicted in this movie.  The structure of the royal family was fairly true to life, as the princes control most of the day-to-day functions of Saudi society.  As for the gunfighting, until recently guns were almost never fired inside Saudi Arabia, they were simply used as a threat.  But when several terrorist attempts to attack certain facilites were shot down, blood was spilled between Saudis.  I cannot emphasize how shocking this was to Saudi life, mostly because their media is completely controlled by the royal government, but also because it showed them they were not immune to the threat of Al-Qaida and other extremist factions.  What this film is mostly valuable for is expressing the quantum change that has occured in Saudi society, where once they felt completely secure, now they realize they are vulnerable to the same threats we all are.",1215129600,22,1551,4.885496183206107

On the surface an ordinary political thriller, but among the strengths of its documentary style presentation is the utter confusion facing the agents when they arrive. Things aren't obvious and clear, and the chaos is far more realistic than many films because it reflects the confusion that would be met in reality when arriving in such a situation.

Other strengths include the clear depiction that not all Saudis support the terrorists, while at the same time there is obvious resentment against outsiders. The ending is bittersweet in the short run, but with the inevitability that the circle of terror will continue anyway as violence begets violence.

What I didn't like was that after more than an hour and a half of seeing heavily armed police and national guard everywhere, all of a sudden at the end it is just our American heroes and their Saudi ally who are left to follow the baddies into the heart of danger.

What can I say, go into this one with low expectations as I did, and you should find it a great way to kill 2 hours.  Yep there are some stock Hollywood cliches especially during the somewhat slowish first 1/3, but the fight scenes of the last 1/3 of the film makes it all worth it, despite their fairly egregious implausibility.

So suspend your considerable disbelief, and just kick back and enjoy the freeway chase, the neighborhood shootout and the apartment shootout especially the part featuring World Class Hot Babe Jennifer Garner putting a four inch blade into the back of some big burly A-rab's jihadi skull after he throws her around the room like a bag 'o potatoes.

Along the way, there are some vague jabs at insight: we see that the Washington DC political establishment is very much in cahoots with the Saudi royals and that the Saudi royals are an equally dubious bunch; that the American diplomatic corps has no shortage of greasy careerist slimeballs; that the average American and the average Saudi both view each other's governments and cultures with comparable amounts of distrust and xenophobia, probably well-deserved; that both countries are in bed with each other for the same bottom-line economic and military conveniences, etc.  All quite reasonable and salient points no doubt, hardly original of course---but as one noted film critic pointed out, this is sort of like the ""...For Dummies"" version of ""Syriana.""

In other words, the geopolitical backdrop is just a cool frame for all the state of the art bang-boom-bam boilerplate.  It's just loads of fun to watch the explosions and blood-splattering...I could watch the luscious Jennifer Garner running around in a snug and sweaty T-shirt with an automatic rifle in her hands dodging RPGs all day long!

With the exception of Chris Cooper and the two lead Saudi guys (Ali Suliman and Ashraf Barhom), none of these guys are first-rate actors...but that's ok, director Peter Berg is smart enough to mostly spare them any overly challenging thespian moments, with lots of cutaways and jump cuts and cool music and visual atmospherics to keep us entertained.  The script has an admirably low number of clunkers for an action movie, too---not exactly Ingmar Bergman, but very few schmaltzy cringe-inducing moments, even at the end.  Don't know where this film was shot, but it does an excellent job of conjuring up the sights and sounds of Saudi Arabia which is a fascinating planet all unto itself.",1204502400,2,2555,4.976525821596244

3013219,2,B000Y7WGP6,"Visceral as it may be, Peter Berg's ""The Kingdom"" employs an absurd premise: That a terrorist attack on American oil workers in Saudi Arabia would allow for a character-driven, small-ensemble hunt for the ringleader to ensue in the midst of crowded markets and impromptu prayer sessions.

Hogwash; such a thing would trigger a Saudi lock down so swift and fierce that said investigation would play out amidst deserted streets and silence. The remaining American workers and their families would be whisked ""out country"" in hours.

A grieving Tim McGraw, stumbling around in a base house near the bomb site two days after the deed? Please.

It'd be easier to suspend belief if Berg and screenwriter Matthew Michael Carnahan weren't so intent on imposing the facts of the US-Saudi relationship - true, but obvious and meant to impress - in the movie's opening credits. Or using title placards to identify characters, documentary-style. Or fixating on the supposed efficiency and forensic genius of an elite four-person FBI team, led by Jamie Foxx, who basically wears shades, growls and  plays cool until the half-hour gun battle right out of Michael Mann's playbook. A grainy film stock can't obscure a rudderless police procedural in which the bad guys finally intervene on behalf of the good ones so the movie can end in a rush of blood.

Foxx is Ronald Fleury, an FBI investigator whose team of snoops includes grizzled Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), a token, braver-than-thou female in Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner) and, yeah, comic relief in Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman). Levity? Get it? Nebbish whining from a geek in the wake of a terrorist attack?  Tastes like dry Strawberry Quik, especially when the geek becomes distressed damsel, and is saved twice from a beheading. Once by a faulty camera tripod.

You cannot imagine a more unlikely foursome. Fortunately, Carnahan's script provides a Saudi cop (Ashraf Barhom from ""Paradise Now"") whose ""rules"" forbid the FBI from doing much. ""The Kingdom"" has an interminable second act in which Fleury's gang seeks the identity of someone the audience has already met, through means that will not get them particularly close. Indeed, the team seems to fall short, until a bit of serendipitous violence - it can't be called anything else - drags our intrepids straight to the rocket-infested lair.

What's left? A meandering travelogue? ""The Kingdom"" knows some things about Saudi Arabia, and even has the sense to compare and contrast cultures, but it underlines these critiques in a preening, know-it-all way that Berg brings to his work. Berg's camera flits about the chaos before zeroing in, over and over, for that just-so line of poignancy - only he does it with varying shot widths, which, in its own way, is just as ridiculous as all those slap-dash, get-a-car-crash-from-12 angles films in the 1980s. Berg's mentor, Mann, falls into that trap occasionally - see ""Ali"" - but not like this.

And the less said about the coda of ""The Kingdom,"" the better. Enough to say that it's as self-conscious and a little bit sickening. Check out Berg's barely perceptible zoom on the movie's final image. Arrogant much?",1204416000,2,3160,5.049904030710173
3013220,4,B000Y7WGP6,"The camera should love its subjects in a film, and it does here. Hovering over shoulders, shooting through doorways, scoping around corners is what DP Mauro Fiore does best, and although it's overused (particularly in television commercials) here it succeeds in breaking down the 'fourth wall'. If you're a fan of Michael Mann (Collateral, The Insider, Heat), you'll recognize strategy of getting in tight and close on the principals. Mann is, in fact, one of the film's three producers. Director Peter Berg's camera gets close and stays close throughout the production that blends political thriller with action in a convincing, moving way. Berg also did a great job of interpreting writer Matthew Michael Carnahan's script.

Most commentators have made much of the action, which, in the last third of the film, ramps up appreciably and really gets the adrenaline pumping. However, what is most interesting in the movie was the workaday banter of professional crime investigators. Writer Matthew Michael Carnahan takes care of characters that are at times world weary, cynical, trenchant, earnest, and committed.

If the film has a weak point, it's the bad guy. 'Abu Hamza', a radical bomb maker and insurgent organizer, is the film's antagonist. He seems to represent the sum of all terrorist bad guys, and Jamie Foxx's Agent Fleury is left to ham-handedly inquire, ""Is this the work of Abu Hamza?"" For a script that's sophisticated in general, it's a let down that terrorist agency is represented by a single character, rather than contextualized as part of a diffuse, cellular organization all the more terrifying because of its decentralization.

The movie tries to explore the tenuous US-Saudi relationship but thankfully leaves it at a superficial exploration of conflicting state interests. In other words, we don't have to suffer through Jamie Foxx mounting any soapboxes about it. This was a wise move. Consider having to listen to a b-list actor like Robert Redford deliver WWO (World Weary Opines) in things like ""Spy Games"" or ""The Last Castle"" and you'll see what indulgent commentaries can do to a movie.

Considering the mainstream audience for which this film was intended, and its political subject matter, Carnahan/Berg could easily have been derailed into just such a jejune 'commentary' piece which would have gotten lost among the tremendous action of the final third of the film.

Jamie Foxx plays the American FBI investigative lead. Jason Bateman stands out surprisingly, which was a great surprise--ironic and glib, he's the obvious ""Gen X"" spokesman who provides entree into the team for the audience. Jennifer Garner (for whom I had no hopes) disappears into the background and does, I thought, a good job. It was a risk to cast her, I thought, because although she can be convincing physically, she could come off as The Pretty Girl, or the Pretty Girl Who's Tough and Smart if her lines aren't written well. Chris Cooper stars as the FBI bomb tech investigator. Cooper is used well in this role, which calls for  a ""crusty"" type, but neither Cooper nor his role offer any surprises: it's a workmanlike performance from a workmanlike role. Pay attention to Ashraf Barhom, who plays the Saudi protagonist, police colonel Faris al-Ghazi. I really liked him a lot, and would like to see him in productions that don't resemble what IMDB.com has as his latest role. Writer Carnahan sets up an uneasy and unfriendly relationship between the two investigative leads and develops it at a convincing pace.  This is a potrayal of the work that men do in trying circumstances, and succeeds on the back of its skilful characterization.

One quirk as a film fan: I always like good title design in a movie. When you think about ""old school"" titles, you often wonder what there was to design! The opening titles here blend stock footage, archival news reports and documentary work (you will recognize PBS/Frontline voice talent Will Lyman in voiceover) and bring the audience up to speed very quickly by exploring (in about sixty seconds) the history of the US-Saudi oil relationship. I thought that was really well done.

The art direction/production design is of uniformly high quality. Shot on location in Abu Dhabi, with much principal A unit photography done in Mesa, Arizona, the art and production design is totally believable. Sound design--crucial in action scenes--is also really well done here. AKs sound like AKs, and M-4s sound like M-4s.

The special features section of a well-produced DVD press can be a treat, or ""Film School in a Box"" as a friend puts it. Jason Bateman's commentary in the 'special features' is quite funny. I haven't watched Berg's director's commentary just yet.

Overall, this film is very entertaining, and certainly worth your viewing as a rental. I'd purchase it if Berg's commentary is good.",1204416000,,4848,5.070263488080301
3013221,4,B000Y7WGP6,"Why is it that the Middle East is such a hotbed for war, strife and death?

Simple.

Religion.

Look back into history. Religion is the main reason for so much hatred and death. It's at the heart of the Crusades, the witch trials and burnings, even in today's headlines with the terrorist attacks and other atrocities.

The bare bones basics of religion are control. It's a means to keep the masses in line. The other, the better aspect of religion is that it gives people something to believe in. It brings comfort to many people in their darkest hours.

Without something to believe, many people would just give up all hope.

It's a horrible fact that there are fanatics out there who believe that their religion is the only way, all other belief, no matter how benign, is wrong and those who practice it don't deserve to live.

These very same fanatics also believe that the end justifies the means. They don't care how much blood is shed as long as what they expect, what they demand, comes about. So, many of these terrorist leaders have their own agendas, and they use true believers as pawns, using their faith so that they will execute their orders, wrongly thinking that they are doing god's duty.

So, we have the movie the Kingdom. It's about terrorists and investigations, trying to get to the heart of what seems to be nothing more than senseless slaughter.

It starts out slow, and to be honest, it was quite heart breaking to see innocent people - mothers, children, families, mowed down by terrorists.

This brings up the question yet again... Why is there so much hate in the world? That's Why must people kill in the name of god, and then go on talking about god's mercy and peace?

You can't slaughter people and then preach about peace, it's just not possible.

After the terrorist attack takes place, FBI agents sent to Saudi Arabia in order to investigate it, since it took place inside an American workers compound.

At first, they're met with exceptional resistance. The local authorities don't want them there, the American government didn't sanction the mission. They quickly become targets.

It's slow at first, but the action builds to (pun intended) an explosive climax. The last twenty minutes are very intense. Hell, lets be honest, the last twenty minutes of the movie is the best part of it!

The movie does give the viewer a very brief glimpse into the culture of the Middle East, and even generates one of the most entertaining lines of the entire film in regards to Jennifer Garner's character!

I found that the cast had real chemistry. They all meshed well together. Jennifer Garner almost seems to be getting typecast playing a member of the FBI.

Although it seems that he is best known for his comedic roles, Jamie Fox once again shows that he can be a serious actor in this movie. He had real onscreen charisma.

Jason Bateman, having grown up on the small screen and is probably best recognized today for the role he played in Arrested Development plays one of the members of the team sent over to investigate. To me, his character seemed to be more for comic relief, but even though he was a welcome addition to the cast.

For me, one of the best parts of the movie was the relationship that developed into friendship between Jamie Foxes character and Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (portrayed by Ashraf Barhom). It showed that despite cultural differences, people can build trust and even friendship while learning to work together.

The disk has its usual commentary track with director Peter Berg that you can listen to while watching, 3 deleted scenes, 3 featurettes (constructing the freeway sequence, creating the kingdom & history of the kingdom: an interactive timeline).

Finally, the best bonus feature in my humble opinion was Character by Character: The apartment shootout that shows the last action sequence from the different characters point of view.

This movie was exceptionally well done, albeit a little slow at the start, and it's worth watching.

Because ""the FBI is the lead agency whenever US citizens are attacked abroad,"" as the film's opening helpfully informs us, Special Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) implores his bosses to let him take a team to the scene in order to investigate the crime - and the sooner, the better, as evidence starts to degrade after the first 36 hours.  Wary of the political ramification, his higher-ups resist, so Fleury circumvents the system with a little international blackmail.  Once Fleury and his team (Jennifer Garner as Janet Mayes, Chris Cooper as Grant Sykes, and Jason Bateman as Adam Leavitt) arrive in Saudi Arabia, the rest of the film alternates between diplomatically frustrated investigation and a suspenseful race to catch the terrorist mastermind behind the bombings before the team's five allotted days run out.

Aside from the initial suicide bombing scenes, the first third of the film moves at a snail's pace.  It's front-loaded with dialogue and very little action - just a lot of mind-numbing bureaucracy and miles of red tape.  Indeed, many of the deleted scenes featured on the DVD were obviously cut from this section of the film, while much of the end of the movie apparently remained intact.  Even with these changes, the opening scenes still tend to drag.

Once the action picks up, THE KINGDOM is a gut-wrenching ride.  The special effects are incredible, and the two major action sequences - a car wreck and a subsequent apartment shootout - will have you gripping the edge of your seat.  The realism, I think, makes the ""terror"" scenes much more painful and horrific to watch.  As I'm writing this, Google's headlines scream at me: ""The jihadi and the beheading plot,"" ""New Afghan suicide attack kills dozens,"" ""Death toll in Afghan suicide blast tops 100.""  THE KINGDOM may be a work of fiction, but the images are all too familiar.

In addition to the standard ""making of"" featurettes, the DVD has one really cool and unusual extra that makes it worth the price of a rental, even if you've already seen the movie in the theater.  You can replay the apartment shootout four times, viewing it from the different perspectives of the various groups of characters (Fleury and Al-Ghazi; Mayes; Leavitt; and Sykes and Haytham).  One action-packed scene, four vantage points.  It's one of the most inventive extras I've encountered in awhile.  Yay DVDs!

While the action sequences take center stage, the acting is superb as well - with the sole exception of Foxx, who mumbles his way through the movie.  Ashraf Barhom and Ali Suliman are excellent as the Saudi policemen who assist in the investigation, and I just wanted to squeeze Jason Bateman's baby cheeks by the end of the movie.  Jennifer Garner, in particular, kicked arse as Special Agent Janet Mayes (welcome back to the genre, Syd! - err, Jen). Personally, I think Congress ought to pass a resolution limiting her to action/adventure movies, at least until she hits 60.  When they're done breaking the whole steroids in baseball scandal, that is.

Aside from being a gripping action/adventure/suspense flick, THE KINGDOM also delivers a surprising message on the nature of war and peace - and the human condition.  Far from being another ""git the brownies,"" xenophobic, imperialist, neocon wet dream, the film's conclusion stresses that we aren't really so different after all, especially in our lust for revenge and our intolerance of the ""Other.""  War, violence, oppression - all are a never ending cycle, as old as humanity itself.  ""An eye for en eye"" isn't true justice; doubly so when neither side can remember who poked out whose eye first.  An unexpectedly progressive ""war on terra"" movie, perfect for hawks and doves alike.

Once the film was over, I turned to my husband and asked, ""A Department of Peace* doesn't seem so silly after all, does it?""  He the libertarian (small ""l"", thankyouverymuch) didn't bother arguing, as is his normal knee jerk reaction.  Hell, he couldn't even muster a bit of mockery for Kucinich's hippie idealism.  Given the vicious and oppressive nature of our species, a department devoted solely to studying and promoting peace, cooperation, and human rights and dignity is just what we need, I think.

And I suspect that he might finally think so, too.

3013229,4,B000Y7WGP6,"The movie starts sets out its stall right at the start, with the titles overlaying a potted history of Saudi so far, and how we came to the present time and the tenuous `alliance' between the US and Saudi.  From there we have a terrorist event which takes place in Riyadh, targeting Americans, so that the FBI feel the need to send a team, led by Jamie Foxx, and including an unlikely but strangely believable crew including Jennifer Garner (Alias, Elektra) and Jason Bateman (Arrested Develoment).  They have to work closely with the at first distant Saudi police Colonel whose job it is to protect them.
What follows is akin to any of a number of TV `procedural dramas', overlaid with the political backdrop of trying to function in the unique environment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  That is, until the last act of the movie, which then becomes a straight, but very effective, action movie.  Indeed, the action is some of the most thrilling seen for some time - while the hand held camera approach is somewhat annoying during the build up and political backdrop being established, once in the action scenes there is a visceral quality to events that really make you feel part of the action.  You can feel yourself ducking when the characters do, in effect!
Is it a politically aware movie spreading a message about Middle East relations?  Well, yes and no.  It is in most ways a straight forward thriller, done fairly well.  Indeed, once the action starts, you pretty well know how the rest of the movie is going to go.  However, the Saudis are not just presented as two dimensional bad guys, but a multi-tiered and multidimensional society, which is in itself an improvement on many other contemporary movies on a similar topic. And the final few minutes do espouse a level of political message not evident through the rest of the movie, allowing for some level of pondering and bar stool conversation after the movie has finished.

The man has talent, and I was amazed I hadn't heard any hype about how good this movie actually is.  why is that?  why the secrecy?  The movie is total entertainment.  Right away you see a realistic scene that makes you realize what its like to be there when this kind of crazy stuff actually becomes reality, and in these countries it surely is happening, even we know first hand after 9 11.  But the way they play it the movie is so totally believeable, no suspension of your brain's sense of reality, no hokey situations that just happen to happen so the story can move forward, none of that stuff you get turned off by, just a realistic situation that causes the FBI agents to be in the right place to be thrust into the center of the whirlpool! then, once the heat hits the fan. then it just gets better, really was exciting. I was really thrilled when a certain person really came through, not telling you so as not to ruin it but you'll see.

3013234,5,B000Y7WGP6,"I wish I could tell you the last words of ""The Kingdom"" before I wrote another word. Those last words tell a different story. But I am not allowed.

The opening credits are displayed against black and white clips, while a voice-over narrative describes the growing relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia before and after oil was discovered, a relationship going back to early last century. When the compound for American families of American oil business in Saudi Arabia is bombed and over 100 killed, a hand-picked crew of four FBI agents goes to investigate.

As often happens when reasonable people of unfriendly sides work together, friendships are forged, grudgingly then respectfully. That these bonds are set is a testament that men are men, not their trappings, not their national identity, not their religious beliefs, but their common respect for recognized brotherhood.

And what is this kingdom? Saudi Arabia? Islam? Oil power?  Brotherhood? Perhaps. I fully expected an action movie and that's what is delivered, but that is not the point. The searching for clues for the mastermind of the bombing, the interviewing, the struggle for more reach are just vehicles for a common bond. Two men, one American, one Saudi, both government officials, begin working together, not against each other to find evidence.

From this point on, whatever the viewer expects to happen doesn't. There is a frenzy of fighting in the zealots' own home turf, with apparently every apartment dweller privy to uzis (or their update) and those guns that launch little flying torpedoes. However, with the team of four Americans and two Saudis working together, the master bomb maker is discovered. But there are consequences.

It is not the conquest that the director goes for. It is the story itself, the characters, their relationship. In fact, it is amazing and productive that an action movie filled with violence can trumpet the glories that lie in men's hearts. ""The Kingdom"" is all that.",1202342400,7,1989,5.085889570552148
3013235,4,B000Y7WGP6,"""The kingdom"" is a film supported by a well built script, of beating actuality and brutal realism in all sense.

The initial sequence provides us of fundamental information around some items of necessary relevance to understand the complex of mixed interests in conflict.

A terrorist cell makes a coward attack over dozens of innocent people, this chain of events will lead to F.B.I. to make its appearance as a clash-force in order to detain and stop the future advances of this simple piece of a major complexity.

But when the film reaches its entire development there are just there are three problems; the first one has to do with the not well achieved edition process, which makes you turn the attention from certain details of first-order ; (Please notice that, at the moment of the hair raising sequence of the ambush on the highway; make a pause on your DVD and rewind it in slow motion; then check the previous moments before the attack, observe how is the state of the highway, but immediately after, we have another landscape totally different (even the illumination changes); the  second one has to do with the continuity of the narrative thread (For instance, once they arrive to Saudi Arabia, we simply ignore what's going behind political spheres and the way this delicate incident strikes the public opinion).

But the climax sequence is not only a deserved tribute to the famous film of Philip Noyce ""Game of patriots"" in a similar ambush in Bogot, superbly well made.

Those two defaults make I can't give the film five stars, despite of the fine performances, specially for the natural performance of the Saudi Colonel.

The final lines in which we read the same advise for every one of the parts in conflict, express with bitter realism that this battle is barely a bit of a problem still major, in what concerns to the attitude of both sides.

3013236,2,B000Y7WGP6,"Despite it's magnificent cast, scope and production, The Kingdom has one to many cliques for my taste--which can take a lot!

The film starts with a bang--literally as the opening scene is an attack on a western Saudi Arabian compound that kills hundreds of American families enjoying a baseball game. The FBI is notified about the attack but quickly learn they cannot send a team to investigate due to political reasons. This is no obstacle for an FBI agent (played by Jamie Fox) who in a matter of hours finds a skeleton in the closet of the Saudi ambassador and is able to blackmail him into letting him going in with a small team...a very small team--three other people played by Jenifer Garner, Chris Cooper, and Jason Bateman.

Once the team lands they are greeted by their ""babysitter"", a Saudi police officer whose sole responsibility is to protect them as well s make sure they mind their Ps and Qs. They start to befriend this Saudi officer and gradually all five of them form an unlikely team. As the investigation narrows (rather quite quickly actually) the pace speeds up, and makes the last 30 minutes of the film one non-stop car chase and action sequence which ends abruptly.

While the acting, production, stunts, effects, etc. were all good this was not enough to make up and balance with the bad things. The majority of the ""bad"" was with the story. I first and foremost found it extremely hard to accept the fact that a misfit team of four FBI agents come to a foreign country and find a mass murdering Bin Laden-wanabe within a matter of a week when we are informed half-way through that he is ""Like ghost"". This is Hollywood, thought and no criminal can escape it!
It was almost too simplistic for the scale of production and cast that it felt like I was being ripped-off. It was also filled with cliques: an elite FBI team going against orders and governments, a group of misfits with a sidekick solely in charge of providing the humor, an impossible-to-catch criminal, only a short amount of time to try, etc.

At the very end I felt the whole film was pointless, knowing there are just a thousand more willing men to take terrorist chief's place one he is gone. Fox, Garner, and Cooper giver great performances but sadly the script and story they had to work with was not so great. It came across as a mega-budget, clique-ridden, feeble attempt by Hollywood to be politically correct.",1202256000,,2409,4.647887323943662

3013238,4,B000Y7WGP6,"This is a very solid action yarn about a group of FBI agents sent to Saudi Arabia to investigate an horrific terrorist attack at an American oil-worker compound.  Despite the fact that the compound was carefully guarded, the terrorists manage to inflitrate it anyway, in a multi-pronged attack, including a suicide bomber, a humvee with a mounted machine gun, and a truck bomb.  At first, the Saudis do not want American help with the investigation, and the U.S. State Department opposes sending a team (Jeremy Piven plays a state department dweeb useful as comic relief).  But the FBI director pulls strings and manages to get a four person team sent over to observe the investigation.  At first, their minders prevent them from playing an active role in the investigation, but later the agents appeal to a Saudi prince and are given the green light to participate actively.  (By the way, the scene in which the Jamie Fox character convinces the prince to let them help is a crucial scene, and unfortunately it is a weak and unconvincing scene.)

The film is fair to the Saudis, depicting some Saudis who are religious zealots bent on murder and destruction, but others, also Muslims, who are horrified and appalled by such behavior.  Indeed, one of the most sympathetic characters in the movie is the Saudi policeman assigned as liason to the Americans.  He disapproves of the traditional Saudi investigative techniques (torture) and tries to the help the Americans as much as he can.

The film has a few false notes, but on the whole is very worth watching.  It is ably directed by Peter Berg, who was also one of the directors of ""Friday Night Lights,"" the excellent high school football film.  In fact, he uses the background music from the same artist, and it is a bit unnerving to hear that same music in this very different kind of film.  Technically, the HD presentation is excellent.

3013241,4,B000Y7WGP6,"I don't want to keep a potential viewer from watching the film as it really deserves a viewing, but personally I feel a bit as if the movie offers an ending just a bit too conveniently and neatly.

In reality terrorism, at least of the type displayed within the film, is a very messy and very complicated life.  Finding a bad guy is tough enough in your own back yard, but finding a bad guy on foreign soil, in a land where there are many followers of such a bad guy is not going to be something that would be delivered in such a neat little package.  If it was so neat and easy, we'd have captured or killed the bin Laden types a long time ago, rather than seeing several volunteers popping up to take the place of the Lieutenants that we have been able to take down.

The Kingdom presents fictional events and takes literary license and liberty with the levels of cooperation we might expect to see in solving an act of terrorism on hostile soil.  The actors here do a respectable job of presenting the story they've been given.  Jamie Foxx plays his role well, the always reliable and steady Chris Cooper does as well.  Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner do well enough in their roles too.

Some reviewers complain a bit that Garner seems to be in the movie only to offer up tears, but I think those reviewers are missing the point by a mile and aren't catching the little lessons of how life in the western world differs from life in the Muslim world, especially when it comes to treatment of women.

As noted in the title for this review, this is a solid film, though not spectacular.  Well worth viewing, with some interesting special features and extras available to enhance the experience (the various points of views of the climatic sequence in the film as an example).  See it if you have the opportunity but be forewarned that there are, as with any film really, some political messages hidden away within the film.  Not the type that beat one over the head in the manner of say an acceptance speech at the Academy Awards, but some messages none the less.

The OIL companies and the CAR companies want it that way and the lobbyist and the donations to campaigns help keep it that way.

It shows how our involvement started and how we continue it to protect what has become a national security interest since our cars and planes need the oil.

3013245,5,B000Y7WGP6,"The Kingdom is the kind of movie that will cause lots of debate and discussion. Is it pro or anti American? Pro or anti Arab? Is it a commentary on our current foreign policy in the Middle East? Is it a good action movie? I would say that the answers to the questions in order are:
neither, neither, no, and a resounding yes.

The Kingdom is no more than a very well-acted, well-directed, well-written movie that seems accurate on many levels. Jamie Foxx is a FBI forensics team leader whose good friend is killed in a terrorist attack against American employees in Saudi Arabia. After pushing some very touchy buttons in Washington, he and his team (comprising of Jennifer Garner, Chris Cooper, and Jeremy Bateman) head off to Saudi Arabia (the aforementioned Kingdom in the title) where they immediately run into red tape and restrictions.

Foxx's character relentlessly pushes the envelope of what he's allowed to do, and gradually gains the confidence of his Saudi minder and the government. All evidence points to a terrorist who identity is unknown, and the team hurdles toward an allout battle to try to capture the mastermind and prevent the execution of one of the FBI team members.

Director Peter Berg hits all the right notes in The Kingdom, allowing the story to speak for itself, and making political only in the nature of the sensitivities between the American and Saudi governemnt. The film isn't polemic. It doesn't take sides. It present a very realistic scenario in a fairly realistic way. Of course, there is Hollywood license taken with certain aspects of the investigation, and the script pulls out some standard cliches, but not enough to lessen the movie or overwhelm its impact.

At a U.S. base in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a terrorist attack leaves many involved at a weekend softball game/cookout dead or wounded. To add insult to injury, as the investigative team on site tries to put together what happened, a second bomb explodes leaving more devastation and the team dead.
In Washington, D.C., word returns to the main offices of the FBI. Close friend to one of the victims who was asked moments before the attack to come help, Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx). Fleury breaks the news to fellow terrorists' agents and then request to take a team in to look for clues. Denied due to bureaucratic maneuverings, Fleury goes beyond normal channels to influence both the U.S. government and the Saudi government to allow his team in. Granted 5 days, they set out for Riyadh.
Assigned to work with the team, or rather to watch over them, Col. Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom) is as interested in catching those responsible as Fleury. It was in the guise of his soldiers that the terrorists began the attack.  More red tape prevents Fleury and his team from doing what they want, but eventually they have the chance and when they do, the pieces of the puzzle begin to come together.
As the team tries to find the solution to the explosion, the same terrorists look at their arrival as another chance to strike a blow at the U.S. and the House of Saud. Preparations begin to launch a second attack via bomb at the team before they can leave. Which team will find the other first and accomplish their goal is what makes this movie a taut thriller that has you in its grip from beginning to end.
Foxx shows that he is a commanding force to be reckoned with on screen. He has substantial support in the actors that make up Fleury's team (Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman). And Barhom does an excellent job as the man in the middle, trying to remain loyal to his country and help his new friends at the same time.
With the Middle East the powder keg that it is, this movie is both controversial and perfectly timed for release.

2) Add that extra sense of realism and 'in your faceness' by kinda shaking the camera around on closeups of people and inanimate objects.

3) Actually that's about it. That's all it takes. You adhere to these two things, especially number 1, and you WILL create a movie that has a sense of moral significance to it, which will completely distract people from how mediocre the movie truly is.

--As usual, in a movie like this where there's a group of people who are seemingly close, there's this forced sense of friendship among the group of characters, where you see them in a very 'buddy buddy' type of environment. They take turns talking, going in order, and everyone gets a chance to contribute their completely meaningless, shallow piece of dialogue, with someone periodically adding in a joke, in an attempt to show how 'cool' and natural they all are with each other. Good job, I've seen more believable companionship between that ""group of friends"" they always show in the beginning of most teen horror movies.

3013253,3,B000Y7WGP6,"A good but slightly unbelievable film about a small group of FBI lead by Jamie Fox who investigate a terrorist bombing in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia which involved the loss of large number of american lives. They get a permission by the saudi empire for 3 days worth of investigations. The team intends to do a forensic investigation to try to hopefully
identify the perpetrators for the bombing. They are arrive at the bomb site and piece together that an ambulance had the explosive (Great how does that help find the culprit ?). They find some marbles at the bombsite (fantastic !). And they find a location from which the terrorists filmed the live event (which was sent to the press)(Good work guys !). So they do all this and are about to head back home as their time is up but lucky for them the bad guys decide to kill these guys but in the process, the Jamie Fox team tails out the terrorists, finds their hideout and saves one of their friends just in the nick of time escaping certain beheading . The action is great, the chase scenes are great, the free way crashes are well choreographed, but we've seen this done better in the Bourne Series. The Bourne movies have now kind of numbed me to car chases and explosions. It's all been done. But at the end, the story of Kingdom seems like a child's dream. Things just seem to be happening at the right time and in the right way for the FBI team to kill the terrorist bad guys. The Movie starts out in a lovely opening style with the whole middleast political background explained via collages of drawings interspersed with real footage. I loved that though.

Along comes the Michael Mann-produced thriller, The Kingdom that attempts to fuse the action film with a dose of political intrigue while asking the age-old question, why are we over there? With Mann as producer and Peter Berg directing, it's a pretty safe bet that this film won't be a complicated expose of the United States government's foreign policy a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Syriana-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000F7CMRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Syriana (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;but closer to a kinetic thrill-ride in the vein of Ridley Scott's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Hawk-Down-3-Disc-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B00008YLV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Hawk Down (3-Disc Deluxe Edition)</a>.

The Kingdom illustrates the point that we are losing the war in the Middle East like we lost the one in Vietnam because it is impossible to tell who the enemy are and who are our allies. At times, this film feels like a recruitment film for the FBI. Do yourself a favour and check out Syriana, which takes a much more complex, thought-provoking look at our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and why we are stuck in such a tricky political quagmire.

There are 11 minutes of deleted scenes that aren't put in any context and lumped together. They do flesh out some of the relationships between characters but were probably cut for reasons of timing and pacing.

""Character by Character: The Apartment Shootout"" allows you to see this action sequence from the point-of-view of each of the main characters which is kind of a nice touch.

""Constructing the Freeway Sequence"" takes us through how they planned out and then shot this scene. As you would imagine, a lot of work when into coordinating everything and making sure that it was pulled off successfully.

""The Making of The Kingdom"" is a 35-minute, eight-part making of featurette. We get to see Berg and Mann talk about the genesis of the film. We see how the cast and crew prepared for the film, like learning to make bombs and how to fire guns. This is a pretty detailed look at many aspects of the production and offers some insight into how a film of this scale is put together.

""History of The Kingdom: An Interactive Timeline"" is basically breaking down the timeline we see in the opening credits into a slideshow format. However, there is very little additional information which is a disappointment.

Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Peter Berg. He actually visited a U.S. compound, like the one depicted in the film, in Saudi Arabia. He says that they wanted to create realistic, visceral action sequences and actually had to tone down the carnage of the terrorist attack that opens the film. He also addresses the criticism leveled at him that he relies too much on hand-held camera shots. All in all, this is a fairly decent track.",1199923200,,3030,5.339622641509434

1. Whoever was shot died instantly because he was shot multiple times.

2. After a person was shot and dead, the camera focused on him for a very short time then it moved to another person/area. In reality, this is what a soldier does. If he spends too much time to focus on the person he just shot he might be shot by the enemy! However, this makes it's hard for the viewer to clearly see how a person died. I had to watch the movie 2 times before I could see all the details of the fighting scenes. For some people, this might be a turn-off.

The attack kills hundreds of civilian men, women and children, along with FBI agents which makes it personal for Foxx's team.

Foxx and crew struggle with cultural barriers and political red tape to get their job done...and the clock is ticking. They are given 5 days in the country to solve the crime before they will be sent home.

While the acting is believable, once the immediate impact of the movie wears off, you realize that some of the scenes and storyline are a real stretch. There are some death defying car crashes, shootouts that you only survive in a video game and quick ends to those that are in charge of the trouble. I mean, geez, if it's as easy as a CSI episode to catch a terrorist, let's send Jamie Fox or Marg Helgenberger over to capture Bin Laden.

3013279,4,B000Y7WGP6,"With U.S. troops still wading through the mess that is the Middle East ""conflict"", director Peter Berg decided to go topical with THE KINGDOM.

When a bomb explodes in a safe zone of U.S. soldiers and civilians, the FBI leaves its native soil and heads to Saudi Arabia.

The team is headed by Special Agent-in-Charge Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreamgirls/dp/B000O1799U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dreamgirls</a>). With him comes his three person team, agents Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jarhead/dp/B000DZIGDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jarhead</a>), Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smokin-Aces/dp/B000Q66Q7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smokin' Aces</a>) and the lovely/deadly Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner).

But once on Saudi sand the team quickly learns that they're being shuttered and kept uber-safe by a team of special police headed by Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paradise-Now/dp/B000E0OE44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paradise Now</a>).

Angered for being unable to get into the bomb site, the team eventually gets Colonel Ghazi to take them into his confidence. Discoveries are made. Material is excavated. But on the other side danger lurks for Fleury and his team. Bombers are aware of the FBI's arrival and want a high profile target. The agents are targeted and when an explosion rocks through their security and one of Fleury's team members is dragged away (obviously to be executed on tape later), Ghazi and Fleury join forces and form a bond neither thought possible (one between devout Muslim and a Christian).

Loaded with action but little plot, the main sequences occur after the kidnapping of the FBI agent. A series of chase scenes and gun battles culminate to form the final sections of the movie. Heading deep into jihadist territory, the audience is treated to some incredible shots where lives are won and lost on both sides. The ending commentary by Fleury (Foxx) and a Muslim child left behind is very telling as to what keeps conflict going from generation to generation.

Not being a huge fan of the action-over-plot films, I found myself making an exception here for two reasons. First were the action scenes intense enough to keep my hands clenched for many minutes. I hadn't realized how tense I was until my hands started aching. Second is how relevant this subject is to our current situation in the Persian Gulf. What exactly is the U.S. plan for the Middle East (plot)?

Needless to say, if you enjoy stories that have an actual point, you might not care for The Kingdom. But if you're one of those newfound movie lovers of style over substance, you'll enjoy it.",1199664000,,2901,5.992753623188406
3013280,4,B000Y7WGP6,"Jamie Foxx has moved into the A-list at Hollywood.  He's able to deliver drama (RAY, JARHEAD), comedy (THE JAMIE FOXX SHOW), and action (MIAMI VICE).  His role as FBI Special Agent Ronal Fleury in THE KINGDOM is going to further his drama and action acumen.

As Fleury, Foxx gets to descend into Saudi Arabian holdings like the unholy wrath of God - eventually.  There's a lot of red tape stringing him up at first.  But by the time he gets through it, he breaks out the big guns and the action couldn't be finer.  It could, however, be more believable at times.  But that's not what this film is about, nor should it be.  This is a high-octane thriller that's wired for violence and explosions.  That's why I bought the DVD and watched it, and I got what I paid for.

The movie opens up with an attack against US citizens in a restricted area in Saudi Arabia.  The events are carefully controlled and calculated to do the most harm.  Then the cameramen go to work and roll out some of the most intense chase scenes and gunplay I've seen in a while.  Maybe I'd just been away from that kind of all-out action for too long, but it really hit the spot.

The intercut between the devastation and Foxx's character delivering a speech in front of his young son's elementary school class is stark and carries a lot of emotional resonance.  Fleury's friend is giving his life protecting the very thing that Fleury is at the moment enjoying.

Afterwards, Fleury asks for permission to put an FBI investigation team on the ground in Saudi Arabia but gets politely refused at every turn.  He resorts to political brinksmanship and blackmail to get an audience with an influential Saudi Arabian who can make everything happen.  Then Fleury piles on even more blackmail.

All goes as I knew it would, and Fleury and his team fly to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  The eventual team-up of the American cop and the Saudi Arabian cop isn't a big surprise, but the friendship is built slowly and steadily, and I enjoyed watching it develop.  Ashraf Barhom is absolutely fantastic as the Saudi Arabian officer, Faris al-Ghazi.

The cat-and-mouse game that exists between the FBI team and the terrorists, and the FBI team and the Saudi Arabian military is played for all its worth.  Fleury's eventual winning over of the Saudi Arabian prince in charge of the investigation comes surprisingly quickly, but happens in a manner that was totally understandable.

Once the FBI team is unleashed, things really start to happen.  I enjoyed the CSI moments of Chris Cooper's Special Agent Grant Sykes displaying his demolitions knowledge when he unearths the actual vehicle that blew up in the protected compound.  And I liked the way that Fleury worked to constantly include al-Ghazi in every discovery the team made at the proper time, while giving the Saudi Arabian officer credit for the discovery as well.

The kidnapping of one of the FBI team members initiates the final action sequence of the film.  Those scenes are incredibly tense, and Director Peter Berg makes the most of them.  I felt like I was about to have an adrenaline meltdown waiting to see how the rescue attempt played out.

Jennifer Garner got a lot of attention initially in the movie for being a female in the Muslim culture.  However, except for a few scenes, that never really went anywhere.  Her character wasn't really needed, and I didn't know why someone as politically savvy as Fleury was would shoot himself in the foot like that.  But I also know that Hollywood likes to put women in films, so that was a given.

I expected Garner to break out some serious ALIAS or ELEKTRA moves at the end of the movie during the rescue attempt, but I was somewhat disappointed.  I also realized that not being a martial arts star was true to her character, though.  By that time, however, I was teetering on the edge of overwhelming anxiety about the fate of Jason Bateman's character, and I figured the team needed every edge they could get.

The political message at the end of the film kind of spoiled things for me.  In the end, nothing had been changed.  The body count in the struggle had gone up, but neither side is going to give up.  In fact, both sides have the same ideology, and that message ended up being something of a downer.

Overall, THE KINGDOM is a good thriller with plenty of action and tension.  I enjoyed it for the most part, liked the dialogue and the character building between Foxx and Barhom, and agonized - as I was supposed to - during the bullet-riddled climax.  Jamie Foxx is still on the move as a leading man and shows no signs of slowing down.",1199664000,3,4615,4.624846248462485
3013281,5,B000Y7WGP6,"O.k., I love Jamie Foxx - and Jennifer Garner - so I expected this to be what I was looking for. And it was, but also so much more.
The story in short: There has been a terrorist attack on an American compound in the Saudi Kingdom. A handful of FBI agents are sent over to search for clues. Although at first they have to learn to deal with the Saudi opposition, they succeed to win over the good guys and together they manage to solve the case.
This sounds very dry. Trust me, it isn't. The film will definitely keep you pinned to the edge of your seat for the 145 minutes.
The action is extremely well done. Of course there is a car chase, but I have never before seen one like this. And I'm usually not a fan of car chases either. This one had me though.
You all know Jennifer Garner has had a few lessons in how to fight, and she's showing off some good results, as does Jamie.
The movie's pace is terrific. It feels natural, never as if constructed.
The characters are well developed. Jamie, Jennifer and especially Chris Cooper use the little space they have perfectly to paint each individual. But also the Saudi military is portrayed in a credible way. Who wouldn't be mad when a foreign nation sends in his troops to solve your case? Add the differences in cultures and you've got a perfect clash. But good people can find a way out and here they do.
(Of course this is an action flick, not a documentary. I wouldn't go as far as to say that the terrorists are one-dimensional, but they have less space to develop depth as do the good guys.)
I will definitely be watching this one over and over again.
The HD DVD transfer is marvellous. Picture, depth, sound, all state of the art.
Specials include a history time line of the Saudi Kingdom which helps you understand the background to some of today's troubles.
The Apartment Shootout scene is awesome. It's intense, ultra violent, bloody, horrifying. They show it from 4 different perspectives. Makes you wish you never get into something like it.
Now that Warner switched to Bluray they say HD DVD is doomed. This one proves what it can contain. Get it!",1199577600,25,2113,4.420512820512821
3013282,4,B000Y7WGP6,"This movie was definitely better than I had expected.  Usually Hollywood has a hard time dealing realistically with terrorism.  They also seem to always cast the FBI as the typical profiler/serial killer chaser who likes to interfere with the local cops' investigations.  This time they give a different look at the FBI.  The plot definitely brings to mind the Khobar Tower bombing--check out former FBI Director Louis Freeh's book which touches on that investigation.

Anyway, back to the movie.  Good solid action, drama, and cultural perspective.  Also, the movie did not set out to make a political statement--seemed to be pretty fair.  Highly recommended for those with an interest in the Middle East, terrorism subjects and the FBI.

By the way, it is interesting to see that the director, Peter Berg is working on the film version of the book, ""Lone Survivor"" by former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell.  It makes me optimistic that it might be done well and true to the story.",1199491200,,977,4.938650306748467
3013283,1,B000Y7WGP6,"There are so many negatives on the lack of cinematography and one dimensional characters.  The topic of Saudi police and investigation of extremists was interesting and should have been developed more from the Saudi perspective rather than the loud mouthed and obnoxious stereotype Americans portrayed in this movie.

Positives:
 The intro describing the history of Saudi Arabia.

Negatives:
 1st: Horrendous camera work, actually got motion sickness and had to stop watching with a headache.  It was not an enjoyable viewing experience.  The camera angles kept shaking and zooming in and out, even when people were sitting in an office and having a conversation.  Too distracting.

 2nd: One dimensional characters.  The FBI team has a testosterone loaded and hot headed team leader, a redneck old timer, a whiny technical expert, and an emotional female ""cultural expert"".  Anyone with experience knows not to travel into an Arab country with an Israeli passport stamp, duh...  The female cultural experts knows everything about Arabs and Saudis but doesn't bring any head scarves, long sleeved shirts, or baggy clothing to be more conservative in dress in accordance to Saudi customs.  This movie's script should have better quality control for the ""common sense"" test.

 3rd: There are only two action scenes in the movie.  First is at the beginning with the attack on the oil workers.  The second is the final chase and shoot-out that lasts 30 minutes.  Unbelievable on how they happen by ""chance"" to catch and kill the mastermind immediately after an ambush while the Saudi police have failed for years to catch.

  Not all people have the ability to watch and enjoy movies with unsteady camera work and get motion sick.  It ruins the experience and from a business standpoint, limits the market one can sell to.

 I am trying to warn others about how bad this movie is, unlike  the commercials and reviews that I mistakenly listened to.  If you enjoyed this movie, then good for you.  If not, you have been warned to rent or borrow it first before buying.  It is not for everyone.",1199318400,15,2087,4.9854651162790695
3013294,4,B000Y7WGP6,"Movies focused on the Middle East as a theme seem to be all the rage for people in Hollywood. There have been several films that have tried to make essentially the same political statement over and over, such as ""President Bush is wrong"" or ""This current war is unjust"" or ""It's all about the oil"", examples of these sentiments would be the overtly political, dramatic films aimed at skewering the current administration or the war effort, such as; ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", ""Lions for Lambs"" (surprisingly written by the same writer as this film), or ""Syriana"". Few films these days seem to make any type of attempt to put a favorable light on the war effort or the Bush administration. A recent film release set in Saudi Arabia seemed to actually make an attempt to keep politics out of the film, or at least not focus on it, opting instead to merely show our government and its agencies trying to do the right thing by assisting others and showing the kind of jeopardy our soldiers face on a daily basis while doing their job. The film I am referring to is director Peter Berg's (""The Rundown"" and ""Friday Night Lights"") high-octane military thriller ""The Kingdom"", starring Jamie Foxx (""Collateral""), Jennifer Garner (""Daredevil""), and Chris Cooper (""Breach"").

""The Kingdom"" is the story of a team of FBI agents who are assigned to assist the Saudi Arabian government in solving a mass murder of both Saudi and American citizens, and bring the vicious killer responsible to justice before he strikes again. As the team begins their investigation they find themselves hampered by the limitations imposed by the Saudi government officials, and that of their own superiors who wish for them not to get too involved in the proceedings. But, through their sheer determination the team manages to break through these barriers, but just as they do, they find themselves as the newest targets for the very madman they are trying to stop.

I am very much impressed by the talent director Peter Berg has for crafting an extremely intense movie experience full of racial tension, wartime conflict, tense drama, and a little bit of political intrigue without resorting to the same old attack the President or the current war tactics used by so many other directors in Hollywood. It's also surprising just how realistic this movie is, and just how serious the subject matter is when compared to the somewhat lighter content in some of his previous films, primarily ""The Rundown"" and ""Friday Night Lights"". It's evident that Peter Berg has definitely come a long way as a filmmaker and his movies speak volumes to that sentiment, as does his ability to get A-list stars for each of his films from Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson (""The Rundown"") to Billy Bob Thornton (""Friday Night Lights"") to Oscar winner Jamie Foxx for ""The Kingdom"". This is one director whose films seem to attract some of the best talent in Hollywood, and have so far appeared to be worth watching.

The story for ""The Kingdom"" is a very tense, action-packed thrill ride that was very well-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan (""Lions For Lambs""). He has crafted an emotionally charged story that could have been ripped right from today's headlines, in fact according to director Peter Berg the film was based loosely on a story about a team of U.S. government agents attempting to assist in some sort of investigation in the Middle East and the hardships they faced in trying to do so. Kudos must also go to Matthew Michael Carnahan, along with director Peter Berg, in regards to resisting the temptation to include as much political leanings in this film as possible, opting instead to keep the focus on the U.S. agents trying to do the right thing, and leaving the politics out of the equation. However, Carnahan must have needed an outlet later on for his pent-up political thoughts that he didn't use in this film, thus releasing them via his overtly liberal script for 2007's ""Lions For Lambs"" starring Tom Cruise, Robert Redford, and Meryl Streep.

The actors were all very impressive in their individual roles, each cast member that comprised the main characters was fully prepared for their roles and it showed. They all went through training courses on how to properly hold and fire weapons, clearing rooms where hostiles may be present, and multiple other military tactics; all of this was done as a conscious effort on the part of the cast and the director to make this film as realistic as possible and to respect what the men and women of our armed forces must go through on a daily basis.

In the end, ""The Kingdom"" is a very well done military thriller that gives us a glimpse at what life is like for our soldiers, and for the people that are living in that region of the world. A very good movie that shouldn't be written off as being just another piece of anti-war propaganda, but as a movie that tries to show our people doing what's right even when their lives, and others we may not agree with, are at stake.

""The Kingdom"" is rated R for violence and language.",1199232000,2,5032,4.7715269804822045
3013295,2,B000Y7WGP6,"There are very few actors who make a movie a must see for me.  Jennifer Garner is one of them, so I added this movie to my must see list.  Unfortunately, she wasn't enough to save this movie.

When a terrorist attack takes place in a heavily guarded American compound in Saudi Arabia, Americans are incensed.  This is especially true for FBI agent Ronald Fluery (Jamie Foxx).  He wants nothing more then to fly over there and personally track down the men responsible.

Since Americans were involved, the FBI is the logical choice to lead the investigation even though it is on foreign soil.  Unfortunately, the Saudis aren't interested in American help.  Their government doesn't want to look weak in front of their people, so they refuse.  At first.  But a few well placed connections get Fluery and a team of crime scene investigators sent over there for five days.  The team consists of agents Janet Mayers (Jennifer Garner), Adam Leavitt (Justin Bateman), and Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper).

Upon landing, the team soon discovers that getting there was only half the battle.  The Saudis aren't willing to let them conduct any kind of investigation.  And the American consulate is more concern for the agents' safety then helping them accomplish their mission.  Will they be able to cut through the red tape?  Can they find the mastermind in just 5 days?

I will admit I was a little wary of seeing this movie because of the subject matter.  I wasn't sure if this would be a political hit piece or not.  Fortunately, I found it to be evenhanded and the last couple of minutes will definitely start a few conversations, which is always a good thing.

The acting was great, both from the well known American stars and the unknown Saudi actors.

That's where the good parts end, however.

I had some major issues with the stylistic approach the director made.  I get that handheld cameras are more ""realistic"" and are supposed to make us feel like we are really watching something.  All it does for me is annoy me and turn me off to a film.

Additionally, there are multiple quick cuts, sometimes showing us a character for just a few seconds.  Between these two problems, I found it way too difficult to follow the movie and I even felt sick a few times.

Unfortunately, the movie also has problems on the storytelling level.  Except for one of the Saudi characters, everyone else just felt like cardboard characters just doing their parts.  Granted, that might be because I had such a hard time following everything, but it was disappointing.

Not that the plot was really that great.  I thought the idea of a CSI meets thriller had promise.  However, plot points and characters seemed to disappear at random, which left me scratching my head.  And the movie is rather slow for a thriller.  The first part is slow as the team cuts through red tape in Washington and Saudi Arabia.  The action picks up in the last half hour.  However, I was so detached by this point, it really didn't grab me like it wanted to.

The movie was great for my Jennifer Garner fix.  Other then take, it was a real disappointment.",1199232000,2,3107,4.65377532228361
3013296,5,B000Y7WGP6,"First of all, this was not a flawless movie, so lets just get that out of the way.  There were logic holes the size of a Saudi oil field in plot and execution, and frankly, Jason Bateman was so annoying you kind of wished they wouldve been a few minutes LATE to his rescue.  So why 5 stars?

The final fight scene, thats why.  You can clearly see Michael Mann's hands all over that final scene, and to call it a scene doesnt do it justice.  Like most of his action sequences, they become less of a scene and more of an entire act.  I found myself holding my breath for much of it, and thats what a good action scene does, keep you on the edge of your seat...and it frankly redeemed whatever shortcomings this movie had.

Highly recommended...",1199232000,3,742,4.257142857142857
3013297,4,B000Y7WGP6,"The Kingdom is an interesting crime thriller, action movie that also packs a few surprises. I found the scenes in Saudi Arabia (even though I believe it wasn't actually filmed there) very interesting, it was intriguing to get a (fictional) glimpse into this exotic and still somewhat mysterious part of the world. I really enjoyed the documentary-style filmmaking, it gave the movie an amped-up edge.

For me, the best revelations of the movie came in the form of the two Saudi police officers who play central roles in the story. I believe that, for at least the captain, he had to learn english for his lines. Both men's performances were absolutely superb. Pure acting ability, they are so genuine & perfect in their roles, it was a total pleasure to watch them.

Jeremy Piven has a small-ish role in the movie, but as always I find him immensely entertaining. He gives another manic, high-strung performance, which he is so good at.

Jennifer Garner shows her athletic abilities once again in a no-holds barred fight scene, total wow - go Jennifer!!

Jamie Foxx & Chris Cooper never disappoint, they both have charm, talent and great screen presence, this movie is no exception.

Jason Bateman was one of my faves in this movie, he is hilarious in his role, and even pulls off the serious scenes with complete believability. I think his performance will elevate his acting career in many an eye...

On the down-side, I found the very beginning of the movie (after the initial incident that gets the ball rolling) to be underwhelming, flat and left blanks where the characters could have been built up a bit more. It needed a lot more meat to it, and had it had that, it would have enhanced the rest of the movie.

The director, Peter Berg, overall really impresses with this movie. I look forward to future films helmed by him.

The DVD extras of the movie were also quite interesting, especially the full-takes, actor by actor, of one of the big action scenes. The timeline is an interesting, informative read and the best part of the extras is the making of the freeway scene - definitely worth viewing after the show. Speaking of the freeway scene...

**a bit of a spoiler alert below**

My favorite part of the movie was the freeway scene - absolutely incredible, over-the-top action! It was amazing - the camera angles, the stunts, and it comes at you all of a sudden from left field, when the movie leads you to believe the story is winding down - it is actually hitting the turbo-jets - but because the turbo jets had also been engaged earlier in the show (twice, the second one also unexpected), you're not really expecting additional super-high octane thrills. At this point the movie really lets loose and we get down to some serious business...

Overall, this is definitely an entertaining, somewhat enlightening movie that is worth a view. Enjoy!

3013298,3,B000Y7WGP6,"Other reviewers have done a decent job summing up this film.  It has some good moments and as an action thriller the final half hour is great stuff.

But one of the things that annoyed me most about the film was that it resorted to too many standard Hollywood cliches.  And at times it painted with too broad a brush.

Take the four main characters.  Each is straight out of Hollywood's stock supply of cliched characters:

-the self-assured cocky commander who protects his people (Jamie Foxx)
-the good ole boy (Chris Cooper--who, after 'Breach,"" deserves better)
-the wise-cracker (Jason Bateman)
-the tough chick (Jennifer Garner)

Right from the beginning the director wants us to know that Jamie Foxx's character is a good guy, and so when we are introduced to him, he is at his son's school talking to a bunch of wide-eyed tykes.  Obviously he is a good guy, because he loves his son and little children, right?  And this is supposed to contrast with the terrorist leader who also loves his son, but shows it by making him watch a suicide bombing.

So then the film goes on and all of these stock characters pretty much do nothing.  I cannot remember Jason Bateman's character actually doing anything for the investigation.  All he does is tell jokes, whereas one agent asks questions, another digs for evidence of the bomb, and the third collects evidence from the bodies.  Why is he there at all?  Well, we find out that he's there simply to be the likable guy who gets taken hostage.  He's the token victim (whereas if any other member of the team had been taken hostage, presumably they would have killed all their assailants by themselves).

There's another cliche in the form of the State Department jerk.  The FBI must love this film, because their director is portrayed as heroic and their field officers are smart and brave, whereas every other government bureaucrat is a slimy dweeb.  The only honorable people in the US government are at the FBI, apparently.  And when the State Department guy shows up in Saudi Arabia he wears a bad suit, a bad tie, is unshaven and totally smarmy.  We're supposed to love the FBI agents and hate the State Department guy and the director wants no ambiguity about this.  It reminds me of Star Trek, where the bad people always have bad skin.

None of the American actors really puts in much effort.  Foxx just doesn't own this film like he has some others.  Jennifer Garner probably does the most with her character.  The only real standout is Ashraf Barhom as the Saudi police colonel, Faris al Ghazi.

The final action sequence is also a bit of a story-telling cheat.  Clearly the writer and director wanted a reason for the Americans to go all Rambo and save the day, but the way to get them to this point was rather cheap: the Americans get attacked, one of them gets taken hostage, and then the three remaining FBI agents turn into a rescue force that takes on dozens of terrorists more heavily armed than them--and on their own turf--and wins.  It's like the director was desperately searching for a reason to have a big firefight, even though it does not fit with the script.

I also found the ending of the film to be really odd.  After the FBI agents are portrayed as noble heroes, the last lines of dialogue essentially equate what they did with what the terrorists did.  For both, it was all about vengeance.  The never-ending circle of violence and all that.  This did not really fit the rest of the film.

It's too bad.  With a better director, this adequate film could have been much more interesting.",1199145600,20,3567,4.634768740031898
3013299,4,B000Y7WGP6,"2007's ""The Kingdom"" opens with a prologue sketching the US relationship with its ally the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a major source of both oil and Islamic radicalism.  The movie properly begins in a ""Little America"" housing compound in Saudi Arabia, where we become uncomfortably aware of an impending terrorist attack. The attack itself is horrific, killing dozens of Americans and Saudis, and seemingly involving members of the Saudi police guarding the compound.

FBI Special Agent Fleury (a steely-eyed Jamie Foxx) works a deal to get his Evidence Response Team into Saudi Arabia over State Department objections.  On the long flight over, we are introduced to Fleury's team: forensic expert Janet Mayes (a stalwart Jennifer Garner), explosives expert Grant Sykes (played with good-old-boy charm by Chris Cooper), and computer expert Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman).

Their escort on the ground is Saudi Police Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (an agonized and movie-stealing performance by Ashraf Barhoum) who has been directed to keep the team alive and get them out of Saudi Arabia as soon as media needs have been met.  However, Fleury and his team are here to solve the crime, and they gradually win the trust of COL Al Ghazi and his assistant Sergeant Haythem (Ali Suliman).  Together, they begin to track down the killer, a murderous local terrorist cell leader.

The atmosphere of the movie is brooding and intense, even claustrophic, as the team unravels the crime under a relentless sun, surrounded by Saudis of uncertain allegiance.  Their increasing success draws retaliation from the terrorists.  In a shocking freeway ambush, one of their number is kidnapped.  The survivors and COL Al Ghazi set off in hot pursuit, ending up in a dense urban neighborhood owned by the terrorists.  The ensuing gunfight is the payoff scene of the movie, a breathless sequence made even more intense by some superb cinimatography.

Director Peter Berg for the most part avoided the temptation to politicize the movie.  An awkward attempt to suggest that violence begats violence is undercut by the stark moral differences between the FBI Team and their Saudi Police allies, and the murderous terrorists.

The widescreen DVD includes deleted scenes that provide some useful exposition on how the team got into Saudi Arabia.  A separate feature breaks down the fast-moving climatic gunfight.  This movie is highly recommended as an intense and well crafted action thriller.",1199059200,,2458,5.216284987277354
3013300,3,B000Y7WGP6,"On the cover of THE KINGDOM DVD, it reads: ""A riveting, hold-your-breath ticking time-bomb of a movie."" some dude from maxim magazine.

I believe that he was the guy that they put up in the luxury hotel and gave him a few square meals when he came to see the film.

THE KINGDOM is not a bad movie, but to say it's a riveting, hold-your-breath ticking time-bomb is a tremendous exageration. Yes, like a time bomb... nothing happens until the last thirty minutes when it finally erupts, but that is where all the plot holes and problems with the film subside. The ticking time bomb... proves to be a dud.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed THE KINGDOM, to an extent, but it just falls right into a long list of movies that I've seen in the past few years that I've already forgotten. Once I'm done writing this review, THE KINGDOM will most likely never be talked about by me or many others.

The story revolves around a terrorist act against infadels in Saudi Arabia. A softball game on a military base. FBI agents are brought into the foreign country to help find the culprits. Yet, they are restrained and watched and trapped in a building at night, not allowed to gather evidence and not allowed to interview anyone without a Saudi witness hovering over their shoulder.

All of this, I found tremendously realistic and unsettling. This was some of the stuff that THE KINGDOM did right. You can feel the resentment of the Saudi's for us being there. They are more concerned and untrusting of us being there, then the deed inflicted by one of their own.

Yet, when the movie unfolds and they start actually making headway, zeroing in on the illusive terrorist that nobody can identify, everything goes predictably wrong. A reference to a man's severed and mangled hands being the hands of a bomb maker. A pointless attack on the FBI convoy as they are LEAVING THE COUNTRY which ends up being the ONLY REASON why they track the CULPRITS back to their hideout. A series of terrorist cliche's that seem to role out like a collection of headlines over the last 4 years. Hidden behind children and women. Videotaping an intended beheading. Terrorists firing RPGs willy nilly. An American giving a saudi child a sucker in the midst of a battle. All of which are true, but crammed into a twenty minute time period, seemed unrealistic, cliche' and predictable.

It's an okay movie, just forgettable... what movie were we talking about again?",1198972800,,2429,4.661214953271028

3013302,4,B000Y7WGP6,"This is an action packed film that lacks any originality and whose sole purpose seems to be to show a)The intolerance of Saudi Muslims b) the ignorance and dysfunctionality of our State Department c) Christians use profanity while Muslims do not d)not all Muslims are hate filled but there are a few who are rational.  The plot was really pretty thin, the characters not well developed,and  the objective of the movie seemed to be to get to the final gun battle.

There were a number of logical flaws and the first comes at the beginning of the film where it is daylight in Saudi Arabia and one hour later it is daylight in Washington D.C.  This doesn't detract from the film but it is indicative to the lack of attention to detail that seems to plague this film.  It does manage to show -- without actually stating the point -- that Christians are not allowed in Saudi Arabia and those that are necessary are barely tolerated and certainly restricted. The FBI sends a female agent to Saudi Arabia -- a country where women have no rights, who are not allowed to drive, who are expected to have their heads covered at all times, and a place where the men would not speak to a woman outside of their immediate family.  Yet the FBI sends her and the only purpose seemed to be was to get to the one point where she is denied access because she is a woman but at all other times she is treated like the men. Not logical but there it is! The gun battle is amazing because the number of rounds fired rivaled D Day.  It was like the old westerns where the six guns never ran out of ammo and never had to be reloaded. Of course the good guys have infallible aim while the bad guys -- who outnumber them and are more heavily armed -- can't hit the side of a barn with a cannon -- in this case rocket propelled grenades.  Then this gun battle takes place in a building which appears to be an empty apartment building because all of the rooms are empty except the one where the terrorist family is living.  This is not viewed as suspicious until it is too late.  Of course the ""good"" Muslim gets killed because this allowed the director and screen play to drive home the multi-cultural rapport between the FBI agent and the Muslim Officer.

So this is a heavily flawed film but I give it four stars because it is exciting and the gun battle -- flawed as it is -- will certainly get your adrenalin flowing.",1198713600,4,2393,4.34304932735426

3013316,4,B000Y7WGP6,"By the time I was coming to terms with the politics of ""The Kingdom,"" director Peter Berg launches into one of the biggest and best action sequences of 2007, which becomes the primary reason to see the film.  A quick primer in the history of Saudi Arabia in the past century is provided during the opening credits before shifting to a community of foreign oil workers and their families living in Riyadh that is hit by a two-fold terrorist attack.  FBI agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) wants to get his forensic team on site to investigate, but the Saudis insist on handling things themselves.  That situation changes (otherwise this is a totally different movie), and he heads there with pathologist Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), explosives expert Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), and computer geek Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman).  But once in Riyadh they find themselves being babysat by Colonel Al-Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), whose primary goal is not to actually assist the Americans in their investigation but rather to make sure they are not killed during the five days they are allowed to be in the Kingdom.  At least that is the line Al-Ghazi is spouting at the start of the film..

The hook for this movie is pretty good, with the terrorist attack and the need for vengeance.  But then most of this movie is about investigating the bombing, although to be more specific it would be trying to investigate the bombing since the FBI agents are put under such strictures by the Saudi police that they might as well go back home and check things out using a spy satellite.  However, the last act of ""The Kingdom"" is what justifies this movie, because there is a another terrorist attack and the quartet of Americans are right in the middle of it.  As a director Berg uses the documentary style that worked so well in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-Night-Lights/dp/B00005JNEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday Night Lights</a>,"" although for most of the film it seems an unnecessary approach.  Then we get to the big action sequences and discover Berg is totally in his element at this point.  The cast is certainly a unique combination of talent, and the strangest part is not Jason Bateman playing it straight, but watching Jennifer Garner fight and having to remind yourself that she is not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sidney-Bristow/dp/B000H5V8DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sidney Bristow</a>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elektra/dp/B0007P0Y7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elektra</a>) and to stop expecting her to dispatch people with dispatch.

Saudi Arabia is one of America's strongest allies in the Middle East, but this film makes it clear that if the country was not parked over all that oil we would want nothing to do with them.  The overly didactic ending echoes the infamous declaration associated with the ""Pogo"" comic strip, ""We have met the enemy and they is us,"" but I suspect the point is more about the ultimate limits of taking an eye for an eye.  Clearly there is some warning implicit in the resolution of this film, but how that translates into foreign policy or political support for any particular candidate is too difficult a job of connecting the dots to figure out.  Part of me is interested in seeing a movie like that which is just about trying to investigate a crime in a strange land under such strange circumstances, but I suspect it would be hard to come up with a better ending than the pedal to the metal action sequence that brings the extant version home.",1198713600,3,3634,5.317626527050611

This HD DVD / DVD combo is absolute marvel. The price is the same as any other HD DVD and the added benefit of having a SD DVD version to watch in your SUV, your portable player or bedrooms is a HUGE plus. I don't want to buy 5 version of the movie to watch it everywhere. Combos are good for consumer. Even Warner releases that come in combo flavor (SD DVD and HD DVD) cost the same as their inferior Blu-Ray versions. As a consumer, it is very important to say that because the PR campaigns from an inferior format will make unsuspecting customers think that there's somethign wrong with having more for the same money.

And also, this movie works perfectly on my 2 DVDs and 2 HD DVD players.. no problems whatsoever. I never actually had problems with combos too and very little people had any problems that were present were due to authoring problems or replication, but these are pretty rare anyways.

Okay, now when cleared that, I will say that The Kingdom is truly incredible. It touches up on today's situation with middle east, connections with Saudi Arabia and the slow fallout of the tight partnership since a lot of terrorist attacks originated or are linked to Saudi Arabia.

The Kingdom is about a team of FBI agents on a special mission to investigate an attack on US camp, but are faced with a whole lot of problems during their investigation. The movie extremely intense, action-packed and the performances of the actors are on par with their reputation, they do a very good job. When you are watching this movie you do feel like you are kind of watching a documentary and it will definitely make you yell ""Holy Sh**"" a couple of times during the movie's action sequences.

In other words, heavy on style, light on substance. One positive thing I will say, is that the film gives a decent look at how conflicted the Saudis are with each other, i.e. the modernists vs. the traditionalists.

Once upon a time, the government of Saudi Arabia granted permission for an American company to dig some exploratory holes around the country.  As luck would have it, instead of water they found oil, and lots of it, and so began the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco.)  This discovery and the resulting agreements for profit sharing gave the Saudi monarchy the wherewithal to purchase yachts with gold toilets and other such necessities, but also brought about the hatred of certain fundamentalists.

3. Middle of movie takes a while to get around to the point, establish relationships, sort through debris, find clues and create a speaking role for Jeremy Piven.
4. Ending rocks

Conclusion:

1. Somewhat political, but not overly so
2. Somewhat religious, but not overly so
3. Extremely moving at times, with characters from both sides freely showing their emotions
4. Well acted in most cases
5. Great beginning and end, but a little too much left in the middle
6. Recommended for those who like well-acted action movies with a political/religious slant and not much of a plot

I'm an Atheist and I think that about all religions but Islam is definitely the worst. At least Christians don't burn people at the stake anymore. Although they are still trying to destroy science.

Quran 2:39 ""But they who disbelieve, and deny Our revelations, such are rightful Peoples of the Fire. They will abide therein.""",1198022400,2,590,4.556603773584905
3013340,2,B000Y7WGP6,"The phrase ""war on terror"" has been so politicized in recent years that many people--especially here in The United States--use these words to bring up their own agendas from either side of the political spectrum. No matter we you stand on this delicate subject, one thing is for certain, The Kingdom is an American movie about an American revenge after all (let's get even soldier!) that seems one sided with cartoon-like heroes and a very superficial view of the present reality in the Middle East. It just doesn't portray the Arab World as it is, but rather as a hostile place where all its habitants are nothing but religion driven monsters that would gladly kill any American as soon as they see one. Not only the film has depicted people from either side with stereotypes, there is very little action--the beginning and the final battle, that's it--but draggy moments between them with bad performances, and finally ending with every conceivable clich you can imagine.

Brief Intro Story:
It is present day in a world after 9/11. An American gated community in Saudi Arabia is attacked by a series of car bombs, drive-by shootings and a suicide attack as they were playing baseball. The devastation is heartbreaking and many are dead. The FBI immediately receives the call and puts together a CSI-like investigating team led by Ronald Fleury (Jaime Fox) who lost a friend in the explosions. At first, officials from both countries denied American intervention, but after ""negotiating"" with some Arab officials in Washington DC., they finally got the green light to go to the hostile country. This revenge-driven team doesn't know that more surprises are coming their way in the Kingdom.

Review:
Director Peter Berg (The Rundown) gives us with the opening credits, a background information of the origin of this conflict between the Arab World and The West. Explaining with dates, video footage and visuals how this battle of evermore began which is quite interesting but a bit vague. After that, we get to see the attacks in Saudi Arabia which are pretty intense, and then the problems with this movie begin and multiply.

The Kingdom shifts now to our one-dimensional, cero chemistry FBI heroes. These four characters have virtually no personality nor charisma. Chris Copper is in this film! He is an excellent (Oscar winner) actor, probably the best, but gets very little screen time with funny one liners like ""So we are safe during the day uh?"" which is the best thing he said and you probably saw it in the trailer. Jamie Fox is another dull character that tries to ""act"" by giving overdramatic looks. Their motivations are clear, they experience culture shock while working, they engage the enemy but they are not believable. Neither the way Arab people behave--even the ones who are on the American side are very hostile.

Not only our actors are lame, but also the way the film drags with the unnecessary investigating moments--maybe we can call it CSI-Syriana. Finding clues, visiting witnesses, talking some more about how different the cultures are get old pretty fast. Finally Kingdom picks up a little bit with one final battle scene between our heroes and the terrorist--I'm not sure why this battle reminds me so much of those A-Team episodes. The clich ending is so predictable that left me speechless--also can we play a better soundtrack next time?

Let's give a bit of credit to Peter Berg. Even though, he copies the style from other filmmakers like Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Series) and the producer of this film, the almighty Michael Man (Heat, The Insider, Collateral, Miami Vice), he manages to give some good action moments. The gun battles and attacks to the American community are pretty intense and the drama is visible. The Arab World is seen with great detail (the actual location is Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates). He uses digital cameras with vivid colors. But the editing could have been better--removing some boring investigating scenes--to give more time for the action.

The Verdict:
I'm not sure if The Kingdom meant to be a propaganda film--many will believe that it is. One thing is for certain, the film plays much like an expensive Arabic CSI episode with eye candy cinematography and few battle sequences, but with boring performances by Jamie Fox, Jennifer Gartner, Jason Bateman and Chris Cooper. If you want to watch a film about present Middle East affairs, Syriana does the job quite nicely.",1197936000,3,4448,4.963758389261745
3013341,5,B000Y7WGP6,"This movie was awesome. But, I can't stand that it's a combo disc. Why should we have to pay more for the standard definition side of the disc? If they offered this movie on Blu-Ray I would have chose that route. But since Universal is only HD DVD there was no choice.",1197763200,4,268,4.173076923076923
3013342,5,B000Y7WGP6,"This movie is a beautiful and stunning rarity: a film where tough, competent, smart characters actually show real human emotions.

One of the investigators is kidnapped and nearly beheaded. He fights fiercely, taking a severe beating but saving his own life by delaying the filmed execution while he's subdued. When rescue arrives he fights his captors, while bound, with a dogged ferocity that leaves no doubt as to his action-hero cred. But in the moments when the blade is at his throat, there is no question that this man is terrified. After his rescue, one of his friends asks if he's all right. The hilarious and utterly truthful way he responds with an expression is one of the best-acted moments in the movie. And when the rest of the team moves in to confront the bad guys, he stays behind, sinking to the floor in quiet shock. A movie that doesn't show the tough action hero immediately grabbing a gun and rushing into battle without blinking gets my vote for something exceptional.

In an intense sequence near the beginning of the film, a young Saudi police officer (Sergeant Haytham) chases down terrorists machine-gunning civilian housing, rams their car, and kills both men in a shootout...a heroic task. In the confusion after the attack, Haytham is suspected of being involved, and a ham-headed General has him subjected to a brutal interrogation. He endures it as though it's something to be expected, but when you see him look at his colonel, Faris Al Ghazi (who is clearly troubled by the process) during the beating, there are tears in his eyes. Simple touches like this throughout the film take ordinary action-film standbys and normal action heroes, and elevates them into something more: believable, exceptional human beings.

When the FBI team receives word of a member killed in the attacks, Jennifer Garner's character starts crying. Throughout the film, she represents the best of tough female-agent norms (watch the fight when she rescues the kidnapped team member - dang!), but also portrays a woman with real female emotions.

There is real conflict and real friendship in the relationship the team, (Jamie Foxx's Fleury) develops with their Saudi ""watcher,"" Faris Al Ghazi, a man who turns out to be a very good cop, a warm friend, and a nuanced human being. Scenes of him and the FBI team leader bonding as they drive through traffic discussing such things as The Incredible Hulk ring true and let the audience in on the careful affection that develops between them.

Al Ghazi is a classically American character, a good cop partnering up with an outsider to solve a crime....an irony considering he's the main Saudi character. But we Americans have a long history of love for that character, and - why not put that to good use? One develops a deep affection for Faris, and surely that can't be a bad thing for millions of Americans to experience.

Faris speaks quietly of 100 people killed who had woken up with no idea they were going to die, and says that if they find those responsible, he doesn't want to question them. He wants to kill them. Fleury agrees, and another step towards a bond of friendship is formed.

The expected is consistently handled with unexpected care. In one scene Al Ghazi informs Fleury that Garner's character will be excluded from an upcoming audiences with the prince that night at the palace - no women allowed. Fleury responds by ordering him to tell her himself. The often brash cop's manner as he opens the conversation with a gently awkward inquiry as to how her hearing is faring after an explosion is a surprising touch.

Is this film politically and socially realistic? I doubt it. But let's face it, this is a Big Hollywood Action Movie. It's a buddy cop film set in Saudi Arabia. But it happens to show human warmth, friendship, and fragility amidst the beatings and gunfights. It shows cultural tensions gradually peel away as respect develops between the characters.

Any movie set in the middle east (or, most movies made in the past couple years!) can be seen as commentary on Iraq, and I can't help but see more of Iraq than Saudi Arabia in The Kingdom. But the Big Hollywood Action edict rescues this from being cloying, preachy political commentary. This utterly American style of filming is almost like a wash of fresh air in such a politicized environment.",1197676800,56,4341,4.831763122476447

Fantastic job Universal, keep em' coming!",1197590400,6,300,4.2105263157894735
3013344,5,B000Y7WGP6,"Wow!  I didn't expect much from this movie since it received such a mixed critical review.  I have to say this movie delivers in so many ways.  It gives you tense and brutally realistic action scene.  It shows you a glimpse of Saudi Arabia that is torn between religious tradition and modern liberalism.  It makes us question about our war with terrorism and our cultural difference that will continually makes us demonize each other.

This movie is not based on any true event.  So don't expect history lesson on fundamental Islamism.  This movie is not trying to resolve our complex and diabolical relationship with the Middle East.  This is a political action movie first.  It is meant to entertain us.  And if that's what you want?  You will not be disappointed.  From opening scene to the climatic ending, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat.  I don't know why I didn't hear more about this movie.  If you are fan of good action movie (action that is based on some realism, like Heat and Bourne series), than you'll love this.",1197244800,10,1037,4.590163934426229
3013345,5,B000Y7WGP6,"If you don't like America, think there is no terror threat, and believe that terrorists are just misunderstood, this is NOT the movie for you.

In Saudi Arabia on an American compound a massive coordinated suicide terror attack occurs. Many are killed, all in the name of religious extremism. A small contingency from the FBI goes to Saudi Arabia on a mission to find the plotters of the attack. And of course along the way, there are some very exciting action scenes. Jennifer Garner really kicks some terrorist back-side. Jamie Foxx is completely believable and superb in his role.

When I saw this in the theater, people actually cheered. It isn't like Redacted and other anti-American films out today. This is a pro-US film. Also, it shows the consequences of religious extremism and presents an inspiring idea of how the West and the Middle East can work together towards the common goal of peace.",1197072000,11,902,4.85064935064935
3013346,3,B000Y7WGP6,"Anyone who tells you this is ""Syriana for Dummies"" is clearly off his rocker. Both may be about BigSeriousThemes set in the middle east, but unlike its erudite counterpart, The Kingdom is two films in one: a straightforward FBI procedural, married to a pulse-pounding action thriller where the bad boys of terrorism are brought to book in a frantic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>&nbsp;style. The resulting mishmash may feel jarring to the vigilant but there's barely any time to mind it.

We set off with a credit roll through Saudi Arabian history, a punchy distillation of a hundred and fifty years. Before we know it, rabid explosions rip and set the chilling tone, never to let up right to the final clip. In fact it's a good 15 minutes before we calm just enough to meet our principal characters. More as thumbnails than elaborate portraits.

That's a happy band of FBI with Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman. Heroes, they flout State Department orders and arrive in Saudi Arabia with a derring-do attitude, only to receive a cold welcome from their inexpert and ill-equipped Arabian friends. An altogether too many scenes are spent on personal bugbears, but see, the Americans just know better, even without their fancy forensic techniques.

Countering this high nose, as best it can, is a captivating performance from Ashraf Barhoum as the Colonel charged with guarding, controlling and interpreting for these interlopers. Barhoum gradually forges something like a buddy-cop partnership with the main American agent. The film allows him some room, both as an individual and as a representative of his nation and the Arab world, to put across his point of view.

Frankly, this tense cultivation of a quick bond between these two exemplars of their respective cultures is the most enjoyable part of the minimal talk in the film. You won't miss the standard-issue camp humor from Hollywood.

And then comes the slick showdown. Blood bursting, gut wrenching action. Crowd pleasing, popcorn flinging mayhem. This bit is magnetic. There's a mildly mawkish moment when both sides leave a message about ""killing them all"", but whatever the critics say about the distraction of the hand-held ""Collateral""-style camerawork or the ultimate vacuity of the drama, I thoroughly enjoyed the escapism. I forgot all the weak points and thumped right along.

It's not a particularly memorable fare or anything--for meaningful documentation on the subject, consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Looming-Tower/dp/140013305X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Looming Tower</a>--but it does its job and does it with throbbing conviction.

3013347,4,B000Y7WGP6,"I've read a BBC review about ""The Kingdom,"" dubbing it ""Syriana Meets Black Hawk Down."" In whatever way you may describe this new Peter Berg film, it is obvious that the film tries to blend more than two elements in one story. Among them actions are most successful though the same cannot be said about its political ""Syriana"" aspect. The film tries to make a point as to American/Saudi Arabian politics in the Middle East, but I still am not sure what that really could be.

After a brief montage section introducing us to the US-Saudi Arabia history, ""The Kingdom"" starts with a series of bloody and violent scenes of terrorist attack in the American facility in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The film convincingly shows the horrible results of the attack, which may be painful for some to see. Then after some negotiation (or threat) with Saudi Arabia, one elite FBI team is allowed to fly to Saudi Arabia to investigate the case that killed its agents.

The team consists of Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. It is an unlikely scenario especially when you see Jennifer Garner's agent casually wears a pretty tight shirt there and the investigation part is not particularly interesting, but the interactions between American agents and Colonel Faris Al Ghazi of Saudi Arabian Police Force (effectively by Ashraf Barhom) almost make up for the lack of events and movement in the middle part of the story.

The film includes an extended battle scene in the street and building, which looks like that of ""Black Hawk Down."" Director Peter Berg uses a shaky camera to capture the confusion of the place, and while some may think it is successful in creating tension, you just may not like this method as detracting. Whichever way you may feel, the actions are effective, if slightly repetitious.

All in all ""The Kingdom"" is a successful thriller, but not entirely so with some sections that are simply too good to be true. Those parts, I'm afraid, might also have lessened the weight of its political messages.",1195430400,,2028,4.835734870317003

3013351,4,B000Y7WGP6,"Well despite the film ending with a false dichotomy, it was a pretty decent flick and I'm glad I saw it at the movies instead of waiting to rent it.  It's definitely worth renting or owning once it gets out if you like action type cop movies.

This was basically a action packed cop movie, complete with lots of good special effects, but set in the Land of Sand and Oil.

Because this movie treated the terrorists more realistically than a lot of  other movies, I liked that part of it.  The honest part.  Like the United 93 flick, it showed Islamo terrorists as they really are; out to kill infidels.  No apologies required.

I think more American's need to see movies like this one, not because I think we need to be brainwashed to hate terrorists, but because sometimes we forget that the terrorists (speaking of Islamic ones) are completely bent upon our destruction up to the point of brainwashing their own children to think that killing American's and other ""infidels""  is not only Godly, but will result in rewards in the after life.

Thus my comment about the false dichotomy,  and this is a slight spoiler so skip this if you don't want any details, at the end of the movie the film makers seem to imply that the FBI was no different in that they wanted to kill the terrorists for killing their friend.  Of course this is illogical, killing terrorists, while perhaps satisfying some feelings of revenge, is also a moral duty, no different from stopping other murderers.  Trying to imply that American's killing terrorists is anything close to being on the same level of morality as terrorists killing innocents is simply illogical, false, silly and perhaps damaging to our safety.

3247091,5,B000Y7WGP6,"If I wrote this review solely on its merits, I'd give ""the Kingdom"" a solid four star rating.  The acting and action is good and the storyline is gripping but it just doesn't place at the same level of an all-time classic war film like ""Black Hawk Down"" or ""the Battle of Algiers.""

The reason why I give it the coveted five stars is because this is the first, big budget Hollywood movie produced after September 11 that depicts a realistic US enemy, namely al-Qaeda.  For a variety of reasons, Hollywood has failed to do that up until now.  Instead, we have gotten movies with subtle and not-so-subtle anti-American messages like ""Syriana,"" ""Redacted,"" ""the Valley of Wolves,"" and the forthcoming ""Rendition."" In the case of ""the Sum of all Fears,"" Hollywood replaced the logical and plausible villain of Islamic terrorists with a ludicrous one, neo-Nazis.  I don't expect Hollywood to produce uniformly jingoistic movies like John Wayne's much-ridiculed ""Green Berets"" but the failure to produce at least several movies about terrorism where the enemy is plainly defined as what it is in reality --al-Qaeda-- is inexcusable.

That's why I found ""the Kingdom"" so refreshing.  The movie is a sort of reimagining of the horrific 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia.  As people familiar with that atrocity recall, the US did not get ""closure,"" some baddies were executed by the Saudis but the people --very likely the Iranians-- who pulled the strings got off scot free.

""The Kingdom"" takes this scenario and does a sort of ""what if the FBI had been able to get over to Saudi Arabia while the trail was still fresh and been able to actually get some of the major bad guys""? As such, it is one part police procedural, one part ""fish out of water,"" and one part, slam bang action thriller (the Iranians are replaced with al-Qaeda).  As such, I found it very satisfying.

The stars in the movie all do a good job and that includes the Saudi police officer who helps the FBI agents get their men.  The special effects are high quality and the realism is greatly enhanced by the fact that the film was shot in the United Arab Emirates.

The film is not perfect:

1.  As a man, I enjoy Jennifer Garner wearing a tight-fitting t-shirt a great deal, I just think that in real-life, she would have worn less flattering clothes given the Saudi sensibilities about women.

2.  The FBI agents come across as a little too insensitive to their hosts at time.

3.  I somehow doubt that the FBI agents would have been able to get into Saudi Arabia without the express permission of the US Embassy.

4.  The principles of ""evil marksmanship"" are in force. The bad guys sometimes seem to have a very hard time hitting things.

5.  The ""inexhaustible supply of ammunition"" rule is in effect.  Given the way that the heroes blast away on full automatic, they'd have to be changing and changing magazines in real-life.

6.  The terrorists seem to be able to put together a very sophisticated attack against the FBI team extremely rapidly.  Normally, terrorist attacks take a very long time to set up (September 11 incubated over several years).

But these are all minor quibbles.  I only hope that given the apparent success of ""the Kingdom,"" Hollywood makes a few more like it.  For example, why not do a film that shows the CIA and Special Forces teams in 2001 in Afghanistan bringing the Taliban down and killing a lot of al-Qaeda bad guys?  I bet that would be a very popular film. I know I'd see it.",1191715200,7,3489,4.670491803278688
3247092,4,B000Y7WGP6,"After a brief, graphic enhanced look at the history of ""The Kingdom"", a terrorist group attacks a Western housing complex in Saudi Arabia. The families are playing a game of softball in what they believe is a protected area, heavily guarded. But the terrorists disguise themselves as Saudi Police, get in, cause a lot of havoc and cost a lot of American lives. The State department, led by Attorney General Gideon Young (Danny Huston) is reluctant to send anyone in and FBI Director James Grace (Richard Jenkins) follows the edict. But Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) knows he has to get his team there yesterday; the longer they wait, the less chance they have of recovering any evidence. He meets with and manages to convince the Saudis it is in their best interest to allow the team into the country, onto their soil. Fleury takes Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), the FBI's munitions expert, Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), their intelligence expert and Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman), their internet and web guy. There, they meet Colonel Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), a member of the Saudi police, who has been personally charged by the Prince to care for the Americans, and his assistant Sergeant Haytham (Ali Sulman). On the ground, they face a number of restrictions until they are finally able to take a look and start to convince people they are serious about their investigation.

""The Kingdom"", directed by Peter Berg (a former TV actor who now directs TV and movies, ""Friday Night Lights"") and written by Matthew Michael Carnahan, is a surprisingly effective thriller. Combining a number of different styles of film, ""Kingdom"" works a large percentage of the time and manages to paint a portrait evocative of the problems we have in that part of the world. It isn't a perfect film, but what it gets right, it does well.

Despite a couple of heavy action moments, the film really strives to be a political thriller. And it succeeds. The opening moments, a graphical ""Complete Idiot's Guide"" to the history of the Kingdom, manage to quickly paint a portrait of the constant back and forth shaping the history, politics and landscape of this region. This is both a necessary and effective way to set up the environment the American FBI team will encounter when they arrive in Saudi Arabia. No one wants them to go there because they are very concerned about our relationship with the Saudis and the flow of oil from their country to ours. When they arrive, they are told they may walk through the crime scene, but not touch anything or remove anything. Of course, this will hamper their investigation, so it meets with some resistance. Once they arrive on the scene, Damon Schmidt (Jermey Piven), from the State Department drives up ready to intercept, and immediately begins to make arrangements for them to leave. He can't see any good from their visit, so he rushes them from one site to the next. As we watch all of this, it makes sense and further reinforces what we are learning about the history of the region and, more importantly, our involvement in the shaping of this history. Then, in the film's final moments, these previous scenes really pay off with a resonance you won't soon forget.

From the moment they arrive in Saudi Arabia, the American FBI team is escorted by Colonel Al Ghazi. There is a reason for this. The Americans are not safe and as much as the Saudis don't want them in their country, if they were harmed in the Kingdom, it would be disastrous. So the Colonel is a babysitter, restricting their every move.

During the course of their visit, the terrorists strike against the FBI team and this sets off a series of action packed events. The team races after the terrorists, chasing them in cars into an unsafe area, filled with people sympathetic to the cause of Abu Hams, the Bin Laden wannabee. Then, when they can drive no further, they chase the terrorists through buildings and continue the search.

These scenes are exciting and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The threat level and danger are constant and very raw and don't let up, reminding me of some of Michael Mann's work. Mann is one of the producers on this film and his influence is clear.

Jamie Foxx is good, but a bit one note. His one motivation is to find out who committed this crime and bring them to justice. After they arrive in Saudi Arabia, he naturally spends a lot of time with Colonel Al Ghazi, and as is dictated by films like this, they come to respect one another, forming a form of friendship, a bond.

Early in the film, as Fleury learns of the attack, he is at his son's school answering questions from the Kindergarten class. As he tries to get the right permissions to make the trip, we see a few interactions with his son, who is so darn cute and asks things like ""What did the bad men do?"" I think these scenes are meant to give Foxx's character more humanity, but they are way too Action Movie 101 to be successful. Every action film ever made has some variation of this type of scene.

Fleury's son may also be intended as a counterpoint to a character we meet later, Abu Hamza's granddaughter. But this doesn't exactly work. As the film progresses, the granddaughter actually becomes a reflection of, a counterpoint to, Janet Mayes, Jennifer Garner's character.

In fact, each of the characters is a bit one note. Jennifer Garner plays Janet Mayes, an FBI agent who has a personal stake in the attack; one of her mentors was killed. In Saudi Arabia, she looks as determined and grim as Foxx's character. She also must deal with the fact she is a woman, while operating in a country where women have few if any rights.

First of all, would anyone actually send Mayes to partake in such an investigation? Her involvement with one of the victims would seem to prejudice her and call her impartiality into question.

Chris Cooper is the Agent Who Has Seen It All, the munitions expert who wants, needs to get into a hole and dig around in the mud. He also laughs and shakes his head anytime someone says something that doesn't add up. He has the sort of ""Aw shucks"" attitude we generally see in Hollywood movie Country Folk. But he is smart as a whistle.

Jason Bateman's Adam Leavitt is the most original of the characters. During a briefing, he makes it abundantly clear that an FBI team should be in the Kingdom yesterday, yet when he is on the plane, he is a bit shocked to find himself headed into a dangerous part of the world. He doesn't want to be there and wants to get out of there as soon as possible.

Ashraf Barhom plays Colonel Al Ghazi. Initially, his character holds a lot of promise. He watches an interrogation of one of his men, clearly having trouble with the techniques being employed. He allows the interrogation to continue, to a certain point. Later, as he and Fleury start to build a relationship and bond, his character becomes a pretty stereotypical for this sort of film as well. Doesn't every action film have the gruff-by-the-book character that will eventually warm up the main characters and become an ally?

As stereotypical and one-note as the characters are, the film still works. It provides an interesting look at the situation in this part of the world, using a single event to provide an entry into the history, politics and people of ""The Kingdom"". And it has some fantastic action sequences.",1191628800,,7350,4.661265432098766
3247093,2,B000Y7WGP6,"This would have been a good action thriller except for the unsteady nauseating camera work, along the whole length of the movie,it spoiled it, you eventualy get sore eyes and feel sick, I am not sure what was the intention , it opened in Australia today,and that was a common complaint.",1191369600,,286,4.627450980392157
3247094,3,B000Y7WGP6,"Let's start with this:""The Kingdom"" is consistently involving,sets are filled with an enormous amount of realism and detail,and is a far cry from Peter Berg's debut in 'Very Bad Things"".There is one outstanding performance of mention from the Middle Eastern actor Ashraf Barhom (""Paradise Now"" and ""Syrian Bride"")as Colonel Al Ghazi who expertly portrays a sympathetic Saudi police officer who finds himself fixed between two completely irreconcilable  cultures. It is Colonel Al Ghazi's story and character that is of interest to me. Terrorists bombs kill scores of American oil workers and Arab families at a U.S. base in Al Ghazi's homeland. The character of Al Ghazi is the only truly fleshed-out character in Berg's film. Actor Barhom's face and voice  powerfully evoke a spiritual conviction positively arresting as he struggles to stand between both Americans and Saudis. I hope Barhom gets an Oscar nod. Berg has developed Al Ghazi and is good at  the group interactions.
Now...for the rest of the film and acting I am more reticent to say much for fear of the dreaded ""unhelpful marks"" that will fling forth;so I will leave with a set of pluses about ""The Kingdom"" and .....oh heck...I've got to say it...this film reminded me of Sly Stallone in ""Rambo"" trying to meet the sophistication of George Clooney in ""Syriana""-action in Arabia! Berg also has given no substance or distinction to his other characters that he has given to Al Ghazi...or could it be it that the American stars simply cannot measure up to their Middle Eastern counterpart? I found that the movie was uneven in what it was intended to be:an action story,a political thriller,a consciousness film or a dilemma of incompatible thinking. I'll take it as a great acting job by Barhom and one character and his conflict that will go to the Academy's attention! At least that is what I will remember from this film,not much else.
Pluses and minuses equals three stars for me;so it's OKAY,but not worth another trip back to the Middle East.",1191110400,,2013,4.967359050445104
3247095,4,B000Y7WGP6,"Many of the reviews I've read of THE KINGDOM comment on how appropriate or not it is to make what is essentially an action-thriller against the setting of modern terrorism.  The hidden implication of these criticisms is that ""it's not okay to make a movie showing a horrific act of terrorism, and these acts being avenged, because the current war on terror is so wrong.""  Oh, REEEAAAALLLLLYYYYY???

If I remember correctly, over the past few decades, there have been groups of Muslim terrorists who kill and maim innocent Americans and other ""foreigners"" with great glee.  Yet Hollywood has relished depicting our efforts to root out such criminals/terrorists/mass-murderers with disdain.  Now I'm the first to admit that war is an ugly thing, that many mistakes have been made in the latest war and that the goal of ""eliminating"" terrorism may be a stretch, to say the least.  But I also remember the huge truck bomb in Beirut, the USS Cole, and some attacks on the World Trade Center.  I think it's okay to show that a part of the American experience might include investigating acts of terrorism and then hunting down and destroying the perpetrators.

Films like JARHEAD, IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH, etc. tell us that we'd all be better off if we just brought the troops home.  Movies like UNITED 93 remind us that we were acted in our own land.  A movie like THE KINGDOM reminds us that terror against Americans can strike anywhere, and it dares to suggest that we can actually fight back.  I had no real problem with its ""politics""...aside from a tacked-on and silly ending that implied some moral equivalency between the terrorists and the FBI's efforts to hunt them down.

Okay, politics aside now.  How was the movie?  It was pretty darn good.  The acts of terror that start the film are credible and terrifying.  The FBI team that is more or less snuck into Saudi Arabia to investigate are a bit unlikely (of all the people they could have brought, was bring a woman the best choice?)  But our stars (Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) do intense work and take it all very seriously.  They spend a lot of time being frustrated at the red-tape that is constantly in their way.  But what I liked is that the movie showed them gradually winning the trust of a couple of Arab police men...men who are equally outraged at the destruction the terrorists have wrought.  There is nice interplay between the Americans and Saudis...occasionally it is a bit cliched and predictable...but it never teeters into the maudlin or God-forbid ""buddy comedy"" mode.  Because the action of the movie moves along briskly, there isn't really time for subtle characterization.  Foxx is the tough-talking leader (and the least convincing character, actually), Garner is the woman that all the Arabs are outraged at, Bateman is Jewish and a smart-mouth, so naturally he has some problems fitting in and Chris Cooper is Chris Cooper...which is a good thing...that guy is just so darn interesting to watch all the time.

Most of the movie is really just leading us to the final 30 minutes or so, when the little group of investigators falls under attack.  And holy smokes, is that stuff exciting.  It is super tense and hurtles along at breakneck speed.  With the jumpy hand-held camera work, fast editing, terrific sound editing and lots of bullets flying and bodies dropping...it gets your adreneline going.  Everything leading up to this has been entertaining and interesting, but it's the end of the movie where you get a great payoff.

Since this is a Hollywood production, the script does occasionally get predictable, and Jamie Farr has some scenes in which he relates with little kids that are really pretty silly.  Not because Farr can't talk to kids, but he just says stuff to them that no one in real life would.  So yes, like almost every movie ever made, we are being manipulated somewhat.  But for the most part, the movie does it successfully.  Does it exploit the war on terror simply to entertain?  There's nothing simple about that question...I WAS entertained...but I was also reminded of the grim fact that we need people fighting the war on terror.",1191110400,,4171,4.813202247191011
3247096,5,B000Y7WGP6,"Watching late night television over the last week or so has pretty much seen Jamie Foxx covering the circuit promoting The Kingdom, and frankly worrying me because of the hard sell.  Additionally, he mentioned on one of the shows that it was partly filmed in Arizona, which also worried me as the previews really made it appear to be the middle east.  In any case, I swallowed my preconceived notions and went to see it this evening.  Not a criticism, but when the movie opens in the middle east, Ashrof Barhom (Colonel Farish) should get top billing.  He is a spendid actor and gave a beautiful, understated performance which is not to take anything away from Jamie Foxx or the rest of the cast who were also quite good.  One more action/adventure film, and a new academy award category should be opened to compete The Kingdom with The Bourne Ultimatum, and Live Free or Die Hard, three, so far, exceedingly entertaining movies that certainly give you your money's worth.",1190937600,2,972,4.727810650887574
3247097,3,B000Y7WGP6,"I'm really not sure how I feel--or rather, how I should feel--about Peter Berg's ""The Kingdom."" It opens with a softball game in Saudi Arabia and ends with the assertion that war, hatred, and intolerance are much more complex than most would like to believe. Not only does this seem manipulative, it also seems like a message we've been given before. But when you stop and think about it, there are hardly any original messages left in war movies. They usually achieve one of two things: they either instill compassion by showing a clear divide between allies and enemies, or they prominently feature battle, blood, and death to drive home the point that enemies are more alike than different. I honestly don't know which category ""The Kingdom"" falls under; there were moments when I thought I knew, but as the scenes progressed, my mind kept changing. By the end, I was more confused than anything else.

The opening softball game takes place in a Saudi Arabian military compound, in which American soldiers are stationed along with their families. As the game continues, the compound is attack by Islamic extremists--dozens are gunned down, and dozens more fall victim to suicide bombers. In response, a special FBI task force is sent in with specific instructions to find the mastermind behind the attack and put him to justice. The Special Agents consist of: Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx), Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), and Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman). Every one of these characters is broadly developed, suggesting a misguided belief in clichs. Both Fleury and Mayes are gung ho and mad as hell because one of their colleagues was lost in the attack. Sykes' Southern drawl is second only to his ability to dig through mud. Leavitt is the timid, wisecracking one, serving no real purpose other than to be annoying.

They team up with Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), an officer of Saudi Arabia's military. As might be expected, there is some serious culture clash at play, especially since Al Ghazi doesn't speak fluent English. As might also be expected, Fleury and Al Ghazi become friends; I understand that such a thing is possible in real life, but I have a hard time believing that the makers of ""The Kingdom"" weren't relying on a convenient plot device. In a film like this, nothing much is gained from an international friendship. It exists only for cathartic reasons, giving the audience something to feel good about in the midst of a bad situation. In this case, a war between democracy and fundamentalism is being fought--this is obviously a lot to feel bad about.

But the relationship between Fleury and Al Ghazi unfairly plays against the negativity. There's no depth or meaning to their friendship; it's nothing but an excuse to be poignant and sentimental. To elaborate on this would give too much away, so let's just say that the ending reiterates the message that tolerance is a distant goal. This message has been firmly established in the minds of the movie going public, so firmly, in fact, that it's practically become a convention of war movies. And when such a message is paired with needlessly sappy imagery, I can't help but feel conned. Example: Mayes, a lollipop junky, offers one of her lollipops to a Saudi Arabian girl no more than seven years old. Something so melodramatic doesn't belong in a film like this.

Still, it would be too harsh to say that this film is a complete failure. Indeed, it has moments of effectiveness, such as inter cut shots of terrorists constructing homemade bombs. To watch this footage is to be reminded that such people actually exist, which helps to firmly ground the audience in reality. One can't help but wonder the thoughts going through their heads: Despite what they're brainwashed to believe, are they really ready to take their own lives? After all, they're human beings above all else--the terrorist ideology comes later.

If only ""The Kingdom"" could fully support such thought provoking material. This film tries so hard to be humanistic that it only becomes fatalistic, and this is bad because I knew that its heart was in the right place. Peter Berg shows promise as a filmmaker, especially since his projects are very character-oriented (""Friday Night Lights,"" for example). But something was missing from ""The Kingdom,"" something that prevented it from being a compelling drama. Even Jeremy Piven as an American ambassador to Saudi Arabia doesn't help things much, especially since his character is so briefly featured. I think what's missing is the willingness to be daring; a shootout occurs near the end of the film, and despite being violent, graphic, and difficult to watch, it felt restrained and incomplete. If a movie like this wants to send a clear, important message to its audience, then I'm afraid restraint is not going to work.",1190937600,,4855,4.937576499388005
3247098,2,B000Y7WGP6,"The Kingdom is a mediocre movie about a somewhat suspenseful and violent FBI mission to find the culprits of a terrorist attack on Americans in Saudi Arabia.

This film is a cross between a boring CSI episode and evening news videos of violence in the Middle East. The Hollywood hype about a great ending doesn't materialize in my opinion  The acting is not impressive, Jamie Fox and his Saudi counterpart speak low and mumble in some scenes, so you have to listen carefully to understand the dialog.

Our sad emotions about the brave Americans who lost their lives in the Middle East and on 9/11 (we lost a young serviceman from my city two weeks ago from a roadside bomb in Iraq, and several people from my city were killed on 9/11) won't allow us to completely dislike this film due to the revenge aspect of it, but this is not I movie I would recommend.",1190937600,2,857,4.480769230769231

The problem was with the voices, which sounded muddied to the point of being undecipherable at points under normal listening levels. Actually, I cranked up the sound slightly hoping it would improve.

3247245,4,B000Y7WGP6,"I'll start off by saying get the DVD as the extras are well worth it. The behind-the-scenes look at various scenes from the viewpoint of each character was excellent as was the lengthy look at how the big action scenes were put together. Even better is the history lesson on Saudi Arabia that starts off the movie was expanded in the extras with an easy-to-follow timeline.

The movie itself is a well-crafted thriller that is very topical in that it encompasses the war on terror but told from the viewpoint of all sides and also as it takes place in a nation not under war but certainly the locus of much of what is going on in the Middle East. The twists are very good as is the process and how we get there.

The cast is first-rate right down to every extra in this. Special kudos to the two guys who play the main Arabian cops. Also, is Jamie Fox in a bad movie ever. I mean the guy really knows how to pick his roles and find ones that fit him perfectly. A big surprise is Jason Bateman playing against comedic type and showing, hey, this guy can act. I look forward to more Bateman in roles like this (and his asides in the extras are classic as well).

Lastly, I get the Friday Night Lights' Permian Football or Panthers T-shirts director Peter Berg wore in the extras but I was trying to figure out the New York Giants' one as I associate him with Texas because of the Friday Night Lights movie. Then I see he's from NYC. Got it.",1475971200,,1438,4.26007326007326

3247377,5,B000Y7WGP6,"Last time I saw Jamie Foxx was in Annie. This ain't that. The first two acts are almost documentary style, jerky, too much hand-held, walking through parallel disasters - Saudi Arabia where the good Saudis and bad Saudis are almost indistinguishable, and the State Department, which is run by idiots (we knew that).

Foxx plays Fleury, an FBI investigator who, when one of his friends is killed fights to go to Saudi Arabia with his small team to ""observe"" the investigation, with both hands tied behind their backs, while the Saudi's investigate a horrible bombing of an American oil worker baseball game with hundreds of dead and injured. The pace is slow, the frustration builds while they gradually gain some freedom to do their job and hunt the chief terrorist. It is a political disaster, no one wants the Americans there, not them, not us.

The guy who plays Faris, their Arab keeper, should get a statue, he is so good. Finally, in the 3rd act, as they are trying to get to the airport, being extracted (they don't want to leave) after a small insignificant victory, the film comes to life (Michael Mann was one of the producers and probably recognized they were in trouble). Foxx channels his inner Denzel/Jack Bauer and the third act takes off. The ending is about as existential as it gets, very satisfying. Considering that this is an 07 film, nearly ten years before Benghazi, there is a whole other dimension to watching it post-Benghazi. If I were the studio I would re-release it.  This is a much better film than The Hurt Locker, in my opinion. I can't comment on 13 Hours of Benghazi as I've not seen it yet.

I should mention Jennifer Garner, of whom I am NOT a fan. She does not embarrass herself here. She fits into the team and does a solid job, far better than Emily Blunt in Sciracha or whatever that film.

Foxx is terrific and I hope he gets a chance to do more work like this. He is entirely credible. There are tiny little moments of humor, really subtle, in the interplay between he and Faris, and his emotional arc from tragedy to tragedy is powerful, but never scenery chewing. Highly recommended with the proviso that the pacing of the first two acts may be a bit frustrating.",1460764800,3,2208,4.593908629441624

It is the hard reality of our times, when Americans are living abroad and used to make a point, by radical groups.  I don't think there is a single bad performance in this movie.  I was sad for the politics and difficulty of trying to solve problems with American standards in a Muslim country.  I think it is beautifully directed, and it flows easily from scene to scene.

3247438,5,B000Y7WGP6,"I though this was a great movie with good actors and solid plot.  The action builds and delivers, giving you that near-perfect blend of tension, dread and feel-good moments.  It also tells a narrative that isn't explored much in modern day ""war"" films.  The cinema is good, and edgy in all the right places.  I also appreciate the liberal use of AKM's/AK-74's as the characters' main fighting weapons.  In so many shows and movies, I see AK's flopped around and held away from the shoulder, as if you are EVER going to hit anything that way.  This movie shows proper shouldering and tactical technique amongst the use of most of the weapons in the movie.  The only other show I've seen that does the AK justice is Strikeback.

It is allegedly loosely based on a real incident (very loosely). The housing complex is bombed by Islamic bad guys,  The movie starts off a little slow a the start, and then it picks up and never stops.  By about half way through the movie, the action is nonstop, and totally engrossing. The acting is great by Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman and the rest of the cast, but with a particularly impressive job done by Chris Cooper and the remarkable Ashraf Barhom (who recently starred in the tv series TYRANT).

Think Casablanca, think ""A Bridge Too Far"", think ""Taking of Pelham 1-2-3""--

but can't give it 5 stars--I just find Jamie Fox's deadpan style too bland--his delivery is just one-note for the most part...
Jennifer Garner and Chris Cooper are way better. Plus I love her grit and the fight in the apartment--and her compassion afterwards. Jason Bateman's fear after being captured is rivetingly true, and Piven who plays a Foreign Office aid is just good comic relief---
The true star (to me) is the Saudi police liaison paired with the FBI team---his disgust at the actions of a military superior speaks volumes at the ""way things work"" in the labyrinth of social and religious rules governing the way people live and work in today's Saudi Arabia...
I bought it because it is a ""go to"" movie--something I can watch and enjoy when I need to do ironing and there isn't anything else on...that is not really high praise to some people probably--but a movie that you don't grow tired of is something out of the ordinary...",1397779200,2,1183,4.770731707317073

3247555,4,B000Y7WGP6,"There's a depth of the subject matter, the culture, and the cultural differences that is rare in this genre.  Thoughtful character development with realistic & dimensional personalities.

My biggest complaints are the extensive and often unnecessary faux documentary-style hand-held work and the impatient editing.  Thankfully, the emo guitar ambient score is left for the most part until the end.  I'm not entirely sure what vibe they're trying to go for with it... maybe a lackadaisical, somber, exhausted tone.  Reflective of the emotions or the heat?  It's not terribly distracting as it was in the beginning of Lone Survivor.

While The Kingdom accurately shows the political difficulties of ever even being allowed to investigate, it somewhat side-steps the historical patterns of disinformation and inevitable ulterior finger-pointing that misdirect and obscure the true origins of much of this violence.  This can make it seem a touch nave when it does find uncompromised allies.  It's a movie, after all.

I thought the movie was great and gives insight as to why the mid-east issue is so hard to resolve. Pay close attention to the last minute of the movie, or you'll miss one of the key answers to the problem. Jamie Foxx, while I may differ with his views on the Zimmerman case I think it was a HORRIBLE TRADEGDY, A VERY COMPLEX issue, and a razor thin call --- that reasonable people with different live experiences could see differently. But NO DOUBT he continues to earn my respect for his acting ability. Ray earned him a well deserved Academy Award, Any Given Sunday - He was amazing, The Soloist should have won him another award, an unlike some actors who tend to play similar characters time and again his range is just incredible. Two of the next movies I'll see are White House Down and Django Unchained, just because he is those movies. Rent or buy The Kingdom, you won't be disappointed.",1377820800,,991,4.450549450549451

As a man who worked on many law enforcement investigations, I can tell you that this story not only shows one how investigators investigate, but also shows you  the frustrations of conducting some investigations.

3247581,5,B000Y7WGP6,"My first viewing of THE KINGDOM was in bits and pieces on a cable station. A friend suggested that I watch the film in its entirety. And so I did.
I found the film extremely informative through Jamie Fox's narrative. He is on a mission but finds it important to explain to the audience a short historical backvround to help us better understand his role. This was of great help to me as my knowledge of Saudi Arabia was the ""cliff note variety"". This short narrative in the beginning of the movie was short but very informative and helped me understand the significance and necessity of what was to come.
It was.an action movie were one does need to understand what was to come. I thought the introduction clever so we could separate this type of action from other action films that for the most part are interchangeable from one and anothers plot.
There is one scene which is violent (shooting) but very complex from a technical point of view. I kept rewinding to see were all the editiing took place. There were several characters (supposedly the.good guys)  each with a task that deemed.impossible to film without the use of many cameras focused on each actor. It really was done nicely without all the computer generated imagining. Im not a fan of gun play but this scene.really seemed to be thought out by the.director and others Im sure.
Jamie Fox was enjoyable to watch as well as to listen to (that early narrative that I found very informative).This is certainly not a one shot film. I surprisingly enjoyed a film that I thought was going to be repetitive of so many films on hard core action films. A good script and an interesting cast if I may add another thought or two.
I am just being reminded that some dvds do break that action scene down in their extras. Huh!",1375574400,,1777,4.553125
3247582,5,B000Y7WGP6,"GREAT movie!!  Jamie Foxx is the real deal in here.  He has a starring role but is truly not the only star.  I love the premise, writing, and action sequences.

There is a lot of violence in the movie and it is definitely not what many would call a ""feel good movie."" A lot of people who don't like this movie may not like it because of the violence and deaths and because it may remind them of the many frailties of people in this messed up world that we live in.

3247586,4,B000Y7WGP6,"This film shows a realistic account of the very real brutality and threat American citizens will and have faced living in Saudi Arabia. When a peaceful afternoon gathering of American families in a Saudi Arabian park for a picnic are ambushed and shot at randomly, the sheer impact of the attack which killed men, women, and children- sparks an international media storm. The FBI send a investigative team to Saudi Arabia to see the site of the attack and interview people who may be able to help them find the terrorists involved in the brutal killings. Aided by the Saudi police, the FBI team led by Janie Foxx's character must work hand in hand with Saudi police and government officials to find and apprehend those people responsible for the brutal attack. Neither the Americans or the Saudi police trust one another. But as their time together passes they begin to respect the values and lives of one another, and they soon take the focus off the lack of trust they have for each other and devote a more determined search for the terrorists who committed the horrible killings during the ambush. The detail of the Saudi people, their police and investigative strategy, their governmental policies toward American citizens are presented here in very convincing ways, and the result is extremely intense, and believable. There is plenty of action in this movie and it is executed superbly. I don't feel this movie is the next big 'Blackhawk Down' but it is above average, effective, often unique and refreshingly intense. stay with me.",1371772800,2,1538,4.896551724137931

3247599,5,B000Y7WGP6,"I disagree with Amazon's saying the KINGDOM script is 'so-so'. Like everything involved with this superb, unique film, it's sharp, tight, gritty and true to life and death in Saudi Land.

Start to finish, THE KINGDOM is tense, unpredictable, often painfully realistic. With massive frustration, clashing civilizations/beliefs, politics. It will change your understanding of what prompted and perpetuates the bloody war in the Mideast. Seldom do we get entertainment so insightful.

Acting and direction are superb, with real issues, natures and locations adding urgency and emotions to propel your experience. Get ready to tremble, get mad, sad, and truly appreciate our soldiers (but not Gov bureaucrats).

I've seen military action, been shot, got blood splattered on me, saw men die, learned about who are America's friends and enemies. This is a vivid portrait of what this war is like. No spoiler: It is awful; unclear, complex and horrific.

Not for children. Parts can even leave adults gasping.

ANOTHER amazing movie about cultural conflicts is WARRIORS OF THE RAINBOW; if you have BluRay, see their expanded version:

(I first bought the DVD, then went to BluRay. T'was well worth the higher price.

Subtitle dialogue is short and simple, understanding's easy - actions speak louder than words here. Short subtitles work well with stunning,
exciting visuals you've never seen before. You will be awed. Even the 'making of' section, is superb showing that the film crew faced in their production of such a unique movie. And an hour long, maybe more. It's very-well produced.

Its subject/message is very important to know, especially now. John Woo produced this unforgettable film, made in Taiwan where it actually took place. Just check it out; Hollywood can't get close to all it offers. (I've seen it 4-5 times; every time, better. I'm sure to see it again.)

Also, I am quite surprised: Amazon's Product Description of WOTR is misleading; they cite inter-tribal belief conflicts as the key element of the plot; not so (such was a much smaller part of the plot than the ceding of all tribes' lands to the Japanese as part of diplomacy in 1945)",1366675200,,2466,5.62533692722372

The movie also reinforces the stereotype that Arabs are maniacal killers that are hell bent on killing Americans. The truth is, the Arabs do not want Hollywood filth destroying their culture as it has done to the USA and Europe and are willing to take a stand when ignorant Ameritard culture invades their country (think jerry springer). It was refreshing to see the running michael moore lookalike doing a head over head when the jeep driver stiched him with the 16. The movie has some very good action scenes except that the RPG shots are really fake looking. The beginning of the movie gives a brief history of oil discovery in Arabia and mentions the 73 oil embargo. What it does not say is that Henry Kissenger engineered the 73 oil embargo in order to give the dollar petro backing since they had just broke from the gold standard in 71. They then engineered a fake war in 73 so that
the oil companies could say that the Arabs are punishing the USA for helping the Israelis. This was thoroughly discussed at Bilderberg during that year in Sweden. This is a good movie if you are a thinker,another movie that is recommended is ""Wag The Dog"".",1344816000,,1417,4.626984126984127

3247635,5,B000Y7WGP6,"A fast moving Iraq-War-era military action thriller.

An FBI team is sent to Saudi Arabia for a 5 day trip to investigate the head of a terrorist network who killed two FBI agents. Special Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) heads the team rounded off by a hand-picked team of professionals: Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), and Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman). On the Saudi side, Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom) who escorts the FBI team in Saudi completes the cast.

The film captures the explosive pressures, the reluctant Saudi-American ""cooperation"" and love-hate relationship, and plots that bubble behind the scenes very well. This is an environment where you cannot trust a whole lot of people, including the Americans who live down there. Fear weighs as heavy as the heat.

As the FBI team gets off the plane, we hope and pray that they have what it takes to complete the mission successfully. This is a country of fast moving SUVs with darkened windows and constant monitoring, and tailing, and non-stop 24 hour vigilance. And every object can be another bomb with fuse ticking.

The camera is a character in itself in this movie. As it cuts from one close shot to another we are drawn into the heart of intrigue. A car approaching... is it friendly or not? A truck passes in the other lane, in the other direction. Did it stop and make a U-turn? These are all the things that need to be watched closely. Security requires a healthy dose of insanity as well.

After the team walks into a hornet's nest of an ambush and fights its way out, we realize that this crew has what it takes; they are the best in what they do. As Washington bureaucrats push and shove for political brownie points (with Danny Huston as Attorney General), the FBI team down in Saudi bravely sets out to do what they were tasked to do: to find the head of the network who took the lives of two of their friends.

The State Dept rep Damon Schmidt (played by Entourage's Jeremy Piven) adds another level of complexity by his shallow efforts to manage and streamline the whole operation while shamelessly attempting to take full credit for its success.

In the end, the mission is accomplished but at a great human cost, and with lingering ambivalence about the worth of the whole exercise. Why? Because the head of the ""terror network"" turns out to be someone that you'd never associate with the word ""terror."" So goes the complexities of our new fiery world.

We're living in a very dangerous geopolitical fishbowl and this film underlines its nerve-wrecking realities with very agile camera work, non-stop action -- all filtered through a harsh bleached-out color palette. Recommended.",1325116800,,2694,4.790948275862069

3247644,5,B000Y7WGP6,"I have to admit I'm writing this in reaction to other reviews, both pro and con. I'd like EVERYBODY to see this film. To date, in my experience, this is the ONLY film that truly presents our basic conflict with the Middle East, and manages to do it as an explosively entertaining action film. Yet it is NOT, as others have suggested, ""about"" our actions in Iraq or Afghanistan-- it's called ""The Kingdom"" for a reason: it's about Saudi Arabia as a philisophical microcosm of the conflict. Here we have an ""ally"" who hates us as much as any of our declared enemies hates us, but through the weird perversions of history and economics, detailed in the beginning of the film, we have made them what they are, a land where over 5000 little boys can grow up to be princes. Just like Osama Bin Laden. And none of those in power want that to change any more than we do. And that's what leads to the basic conflict in the film: the faith-based politics of the Middle East versus the humanist-based politics of the West. In Berg's film, ""being a cop"" becomes the only common ground, carried to a fatalistic conclusion. I found the script, its execution, and especially the ending, to be nothing short of brilliant.",1306454400,,1205,4.532110091743119
3247645,3,B000Y7WGP6,"- but don't expect any in-depth look at the Middle East or Saudi Arabia.  This is an action-adventure gung-ho flag waver, and it's philosophy can best be summed up in the film's final admonition: ""Kill em all,"" and (presumably) adding, ""and let God sort em out.""  This is a propaganda call-to-arms in the ""war on terror."" Take it for what it's worth as an action movie.

That said, its attempt to be an over-the-top action flic backfires. The hand-held camera style is supposed to emphasize the you-are-there sensation, but it detracts from the action its supposed to depict.  As one reviewer said, it induces motion sickness for the first 10 minutes until your eyes adjust.  Likewise the often-mumbling, choppy dialogue: the purpose of dialogue is to speak to the audience, and trying to create some eavesdropping aura of ultra-reality compromises story continuity.  This is one of the major difficulties of realism vs. dramatic narrative - reality is just too messy for story-telling.  It needs structure, and so does this film.

Finally, for all its realism it does strain credibility at points.  An automatic-weapon firefight is just as likely (not) in downtown Houston as central Riyadh.  Jamie Foxx does good service with his Denzel Washington imitation; the other FBI characters are just cut-outs.  The post shoot-out scene of the female FBI agent passing a lollipop with blood-stained fingers to a native child is an eye-roller.

3247647,3,B000Y7WGP6,"Like The Hurt Locker, The Kingdom is about Americans in a foreign land, this time Saudi Arabia. After an innovative sequence retelling the tale of America's complicated relationship with Saudi Arabia, we witness an escalating series of suicide bomber attacks against an American oil company's housing compound.  The Kingdom never lets us forget that children's lives are at stake here, both American and Saudi, and that war exacts a terrible human cost.

Special Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) leads the charge to track down the terrorists responsible for the bombing.  He brings forensic examiner Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), intelligence analyst Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman), and bomb technician Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper) into Saudi Arabia by bending the rules of diplomacy and law.

What ensues is a boring investigation in which the American team is delayed at every turn.  There are issues with gender, challenges with the ruling monarchy, and good old government politics. Where The Hurt Locker was a knuckle-biting series of escalating mental and emotional challenges, The Kingdom is a slow drag through a frustrating series of roadblocks that, while they may be realistic, don't make for good storytelling.

After the good guys defeat the bad guys with a rote firefight, the American agents are ordered home - too easy, of course.  The real villains ambush our heroes as they depart and, after kidnapping poor Leavitt, helpfully lead the agents back to their lair and the man responsible for the bombing in the first place.

The most tender moments, and the best acting, are from the children and their fathers.  Foxx spends most of the movie angry, but he comes to life whenever he interacts with the kids.  Unfortunately, almost all of those interactions are to deliver the news about the death of the kid's father.

The Kingdom veers from trying to drive home the cultural differences of Saudi Arabia to a stereotypical terrorist plot complete with an attempted televised beheading.  When the same trope shows up in Syfy Channel's Sand Serpents, you know something's wrong.

The real story belongs to Colonel Faris al-Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), who straddles the fine line between doing his job and loyalty to his country. If The Kingdom gets something right, it's in portraying al-Ghazi as a hero, a soldier, and a father. And that's what The Kingdom is really about - the sins of the fathers visited upon their sons. I just wish it didn't take so long to make its point.",1296864000,2,2484,5.0440097799511
3247648,4,B000Y7WGP6,"I agree with other reviewers that this is a fantastic, non-stop action flick with never a dull moment.  Great story, finely drawn characters, and (most say no, I say yes) excellent script for an action movie.

While much is said about the talented Mr. Foxx, may I add how surprising and delightful Mr. Jason Bateman is turning out to be, not as the cute and boyish TV guy we are familiar with, but he is rapidly delevoping into a very charismatic and talented movie star/actor.  I was no huge fan of his but his screen presence is palpable.  So is that of Chris Cooper.  We know of course how magetic Garner and Foxx are.

Very engrossing flick from the talented Peter Berg.  Sadley talent does not negate naivete', for the take-home message here seems to ultimately be, simply this, just told in another (and insidious) way:  Why can't we all just get along so wars and terrorism can magically vanish if we just love one another.  And ***SPOILER ALERT MAY BE HERE:::****  in the end, the heroic efforts and motivations that propel the people who daily lay their lives on the line to try to protect all people, are equated with motivations of the actions of the bad guys.  Not so.  Mr. Peter Berg,  you made a really good movie, but your message is sadly uninformed to an almost child-like extent in this particular instance.

3247649,5,B000Y7WGP6,"Despite the purposefully ambiguous ""kill them all"" message inserted into the script (more on that later), The Kingdom comes across as a very realistic action movie with delicate political and religious overtones.  Without extreme jingoism or political preaching, a picture of the Saudi Arabian kingdom - a possible metaphor for the Iraq war or Islam - is painted in which a culture clash between American FBI agents and oppositional Saudi officials is juxtaposed so that a common bond can be emotionally unearthed beneath the bloody rubble of a terrorist attack.

In a post-9/11 environment - a world that has since discovered the majority of the hijackers' were Saudi - the once strong bond between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia has weakened under tension.  After a brutal terrorist attack on ARAMCO civilians playing softball, several FBI agents - Ronald Fleurry (Foxx), Grant Sykes (Cooper), Janet Mayes (Garner), Adam Leavitt (Bateman) - are sent to the Middle East to cooperate with initially resistant local officials and find the responsible party in a small five-day window.  While clue hunting, respect between the various investigators is forged, as societal differences are overcome and eventually eschewed because of common bonds, similar foes, and shared emotions - particularly between FBI team lead Fleurry and Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Barhom).

From top to bottom this movie exudes realism.  The location is authentic; the debris smolders; the locals look confused, terrified, and angry.  The direction is crisp, keeping the viewer on the edge of the seat as soon as it is revealed the hunt is on for a terrorist explosives expert.  Action for the entire second half of the movie.  And the ending?  Woo, the ending is crazy.  A frenzy of gun-play with automatic fire ringing ears, the wet thwop of bodies receiving lead injections, and speaker-rumbling bass accompanying every bomb or RPG.

The script by Matthew Michael Carnahan is borderline genius.  How representatives of two foreign governments can come together so quickly, to bond so thoroughly, to display such shared emotion, all while suffering through nearly unspeakable blood and violence, and not feel forced or rushed, is incredibly complimentary for the script and actors who made the situations and relationships so believable.  While somewhat unbelievable at times, its flawless execution makes otherwise noticeable gaffs (Jennifer Garner's outfits in Saudi Arabia would have been frowned upon) disappear.

-----SPOILER (kinda)-----
I believe the phrase ""Kill them all"" spoken by the terrorist at the end is what he sees as proactive guidance in reference to his enemies, to kill them simply for who they are.  Conversely, I believe the phrase, when spoken by Jamie Foxx's character, is meant as a vow of revenge in the name of justice, to kill those who have already committed murders and atrocities.  In my view, the two are unequal, and serve as the primary reason for the tensions and dangers that currently exist.

3247650,5,B000Y7WGP6,"This is an out and out action film; my wife walked out after the first few minutes and didn't come back. I'll agree that it is violent but in the situations this film addresses, violence can and should be expected.

The film provides some interesting insights into life in the Middle East; although I've never been there, news reports and video clips over the past several years seem to confirm the use of violence as a negotiating tool. Life in the Middle East, and especially in Saudi Arabia, reflects a worldview that is diametrically opposed to Western thought.

The film is fast paced and moves toward an ending that even increases the pace of the action. As the film closes one is left with statements from both sides that indicate the struggle will continue; it is not just the individuals that are in opposition, but two opposing worldviews.

Historians who address this struggle are quick to point out the fact that the battle has been going on for centuries with greater or lesser intensity. It appears that the level of intensity has been increasing again for several years now.

Still, The Kingdom is a tightly written, well-directed, and highly explosive political action film. It doesn't have as much as action as, say, Hard Boiled or Face/Off, but it does give a very powerful message about terrorism and the negative perceptions about Islam and Muslims in general. This film doesn't disrespect Islam, but it does tell us about how people use religion as an excuse to get a point across.

3247665,4,B000Y7WGP6,"This film seemed interesting because it was set in Saudi Arabia and plays to the paranoia that most Americans have about the Middle East.  Jamie Fox, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are cast as FBI agents who are sent on a mission to discover who, exactly, attacked the American compound, killing innocent family members of oil executives.  Naturally they encounter obstacles as they get little cooperation from the Saudi government with the exception of a colonel, played by Ashraf Barhom, a family man himself with a sense of integrity and who really does his best to help the Americans.  That's the premise.

The film is full of those long chase and shoot-em-up scenes that are required in a modern geopolitical thriller such as this.  Perhaps they would have been more impressive in a theater, but they lose their effectiveness on a regular TV screen and I was soon bored with them.  The acting was adequate and what can be expected in a film like this but the most impressive performance was that of the Saudi Colonel whose humanity kept the film from falling into a formulaic good-guy - bad guy format.

Filmed in Arizona, the film did its best to recreate what Americans tend to think of as the Middle East. But why, then, was Jennifer Garner allowed to run around in bare arms and a bulletproof vest when while all other females in the cast were covered from head to toe in black burkhas?

I really shouldn't be reviewing this film because I'm just not into this type of a flick.  I therefore give it a mild recommendation as an action film set in an unusual location.  It didn't seem genuine to me but I know I'm not the target audience.",1248825600,,1662,4.622448979591836

3247673,4,B000Y7WGP6,"The Kingdom is a great film. Good story, good acting, & action packed. The movie is both visually & intellectually stimulating. Jamie Foxx, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner, & Chris Cooper, do an outstanding job portraying their FBI team characters. I only have one complaint: the cinematography is horrible! There is far too much ""lightning quick"" panning back & forth rapidly, fast closeups, very shaky hand held shots, and very fast cuts within scenes. It's as if they mounted a miniature camera on a fly, and had it fly and jump around the scene. If this is a new technique for films of this nature, I hope it is only a phase, and that it will soon fade away. The cinematography of Saving Private Ryan during the Omaha Beach landing was nowhere near what they do in The Kingdom (I could handle Private Ryan's cinematography). I'd like to be able to meet with director Peter Berg and ask him (in terms of cinematography), ""what the hell were you thinking?"" I'm assuming he was trying to convey chaos and urgency with the rapid camera movements and quick ever changing closeups thrown inbetween. All he did for me, was create a headache. The only thing that prevented me from turning off the film, was the film itself. So to sum up - Great film, bad cinematography.

3247675,3,B000Y7WGP6,"The powerful history of the United States' involvement in the Saudi Arabia flashes on the screen before the opening credits, creating a direct line from the past to the present day antagonism, and these moments are  the most affecting ones of this political thriller.  Jamie Foxx plays an FBI agent in charge of a small band of agents (Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Cris Cooper) investigating, without State Department approval, a Saudi bombing which has cost the lives of one of their friends and hundreds of civilians.  During the investigation, they are watched over by Saudi policeman, Faris Al Ghazi (Ashrof Barhom), a man assigned to control their every move in the spirit of protection.  Of course, this being a Hollywood thriller set in Saudi Arabia, the Americans take matters into their own hands to overcome bureaucracy and corruption and to pursue the villains.

Barhom plays his character with real humanity, and he steals every scene with his no-nonsense approach, tinged with idealism and hope for real justice.  The Americans all do competent acting jobs, although their roles seem too predictable given the plot.  The chase scenes are heart-stopping and somewhat over-the-top, but they keep this fast-paced flick moving from first moments to last.  The message driven home, that we are two peoples fighting and corrupting future generations, is laid over-the-top of what is an essentially go-blow-up-the-bad-guys plot. Nuances such as diplomacy, culture, and history are quickly lost in the gunfire.

Certainly, this film entertains the way the best in the genre does; however, it tries too hard at times and not hard enough at others.  I recommend this for a one-time viewing.

3247676,2,B000Y7WGP6,"The movie has many pluses, not the least of which is the set-up and the setting. The terrorist bombing of the Aramco compound in Saudi Arabia is certainly timely and plausible. The film opens with little documentary on the history of Aramco which sets the tone, but the history scene is without content, as is the film. The compound is bombed, but there is never any clear point made about who the bombers are or why they have targeted these residents. Instead the film focuses on issues of jurisdiction and bureaucracy, which could be made interesting, but here too we get nothing substantive. Every set-up simply pits one of the pugnacious FBI agents against his hapless guard who is attempting to carry out his duties. The American wants to be made an exception to every rule, seemingly in each instance totally ignorant of why rules exist or what customs are. The female agent, for example, insists on running around around in a tight t-shirt, as though she were too stupid to notice that every other woman in the country wears traditional garb. If you don't understand at the beginning of the film why the Saudis may want Americans out of the country, you certainly do at the end, although I don't think this is the film's intended message. The actors do a fine job of playing obnoxious, clueless cretins with a talent for forensics. Beyond that I see no differentiation in the acting. When the shooting starts, only the Saudis get killed, although the picture opens with lots of innocent Americans dying. There is lots of lashing out, temper tantrums, terribly crude language, which the Saudis rightly ask be curtailed, but in the end nothing whatever has been resolved. This is a classic of much ado about nothing.",1232841600,3,1721,4.778523489932886
3247677,3,B000Y7WGP6,"Peter Berg's The Kingdom does many things right but unfortunately it does many things wrong as well. As a political thriller/ police procedural it hits many of the right notes. It shows us that there are good people and bad people in all cultural situations.

The first two thirds of the film are quite good. A terrorist organization has attacked an American workers compound in Saudi Arabia and an elite FBI response team must get into the secretive country to find the criminals who planned the attack. The American team is led by Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) and includes a forensic expert (an underused Jennifer Garner); an intelligence expert (Jason Bateman) and an explosives expert(Chris Cooper). Once in country the team meets their Saudi counterparts  Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Ashrof Barhom) and Sergeant Haytham (Ali Suliman).
The two groups begin to build a relationship of trust that allows them to go after the terrorist leader and bomb maker, Abu Hamsa (Hezi Saddik).

Perhaps the geatest flaw with the film is that its last third becomes nothing more than an extended gun battle that wraps things up too easily for my tastes. The film ends on a note that the violence will continue as both sides are entrenched in a kill them all attitude. As stated Berg does any things right in this film but it could have been much better.

I viewed the HD disc that had excellent picture and sound. The special features included three deleted scenes in HD, an extended featurette on the car crash sequence, a detailed making of the film featurette, a timeline on events in the Middle East, and an excellent commentary by Berg.

The Kingdom had the potential to be one of the best political thrillers of 2007 but unfortunately just missed its goal. The film is well worth a rental.",1231632000,,1779,4.7817589576547235

The fight scene with Garner, Bateman, and the Saudi terrorist is as intense as anything ever captured on a film set.  Every time I watch this scene I'm pulled into the struggle.  My heart races, I get an adrenaline rush, and afterwards nearly cry. It's the intensity of the struggle for life at its barest form, devoid of explosions and special effects.

Ever seen The Witness? Harrision Ford finds himself in an Amish community, having to learn their ways and abide by their rules? You get a lot of that in The Kingdom, but it is done in very interesting and compelling ways.

As if mimicking stories from the headlines, the movie follows four FBI agents as they try to solve a number of terrorist actions in Saudi Arabia. They have five days but they're not allowed to work at night, they can't touch anything, especially Muslim bodies, and they have to be guarded at all times. The real story is how they overcome all of these restrictions and get the job done.

All of the performances are top-notch and believable. The story is well-crafted and tense. I actually watched it twice in one day and was just as drawn into it the second time as I was the first.

The biggest drawback to the movie is its name! We've got The Kingdom, The Kingdom of Heaven, the Forbidden Kingdom, and Indiana Jone's Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, to name a few.

3247688,5,B000Y7WGP6,"From its opening scenes, depicting the Kingdom of Saud and its turbulent modern history following the discovery of oil in its barren deserts, THE KINGDOM sets the table for a white-knuckling political/cultural thriller.  And director Peter Berg (so outstanding with 'Friday Night Lights') delivers a keeper, as an elite FBI team of investigators travels into the American compound in Riyadh to investigate the recent slaughter of numerous U.S. citizens--ostensibly perped by terrorists.  Berg successfully sets the pace, tone, and tension between the FBI team and their Saudi hosts, then moves the viewer full tilt into a hair-raising climactic action sequence that never takes its foot off the gas.

The cast is topnotch, headlined by Jamie Foxx as the FBI field commander.  Foxx is tough, no-nonsense, machismo, yet periodically lets down his guard to show a rippling of emotion and compassion.  Jennifer Garner plays the investigative team's forensics expert (and plays it convincingly), while FBI specialists Chris Cooper and Justin Bateman get to share the film's best lines.  Country crooner Tim McGraw is impressive in an extremely emotional cameo role, yet this cast is most enhanced by the performance of Ashraf Barhom.  Playing a Colonel in the Saudi national police--a Colonel in charge of the team's security--Barhom represents the contrast between his Arab culture and the West.  The tension is established from the onset, yet the story delves deep enough into Barhom's character to reveal a humane man with only the best, most honorable intentions.

This is a brutal, violent film--a film with an ending that will definitely raise eyebrows.  Yet when it comes to heart-pounding action, intrigue, and suspense--with a story that sprints to the finish line--THE KINGDOM is a thriller as good as it gets.

As The Kingdom moves along, Fleury and his crew find unlikely allies and traverse the local politics, leading up to an explosive finale.  With everything that The Kingdom does action-wise, it disappoints in it's script.

Send in the FBI... but this is the Hollywood FBI; Foxx spends a lot of his time looking cool in his shades, Cooper is the male agent who looks concerned all the time & Garner is the female agent who looks concerned all the time and Batemen plays his usual flippant character he's played since the 80's.  The political joke in reality and in the movie is the House of Saud would like to minimize the appearance of the U.S. & the West in Saudi Arabia although we still maintain corporate and military compounds in the country.  This of course inhibits our FBI team, but not enough to result in the inevitable Hollywood cliched ending.  You never really get a better understanding of the House of Saud, Western involvement in the Saudi Arabia or the common man's opinion towards either.  It's just cops & robbers in the Middle East.  There's no consistency in the model of weapons the FBI agents use and they look like people who've never been trained to hold weapons or work in a 3-4 person group (weird since Foxx was in ""Jarhead"").

3247692,4,B000Y7WGP6,"CAUTION: This isn't really a (traditional) review - more like a speculative response - so if you are looking for another review you might want to just skip this. (Spoilers also.)

I saw this on HBO yesterday. (I had never heard of it!) (I know I lead a sheltered life.)  To me it had the look and feel of a 'made for TV movie' (and I don't mean that in a bad way).  I thought it was a pilot for a new sort of FBI/CSI procedural series.  (Wishful thinking?)

I think it would be quite good though - just as that - as a TV series - hour long - doesn't need to be Jamie Foxx - although he was okay - doesn't need to be Jenifer Garner although she was fun - but Ashrof Barhom was fantastic - the guy was great - and so was Chris Cooper. (No one delivers a line like Chris Cooper!)

But really, couldn't this be a good TV series? Bring back (really they must!) Ashrof Barhom's character (with him playing it of course)(just write it as his death was faked) - put him on as an adviser to the team - defintely keep Chris Cooper's character (with Chris Cooper playing the role of course) - maybe he would be better as the leader of the team - fly them around the world as a special FBI team - punch up Janet Mayes - more cultural stuff - (with or without Jenifer Garner in the role - there are others I am sure who would be ok in the role but Jenifer Garner did a fine job as a sort of tough-guy Wonderwoman/Ripley(from Aliens)character) and we could see Adam Leavitt (with or without Bateman) be a lot more sophisitcated and involved with computers and wise-cracking.

Wouldn't a TV series with Chris Cooper and Ashrof Barhom be a smash hit - maybe they wouldn't be open to doing a TV series (movie careers and all that)but there really seems to be a lot of potential here for the small screen.

It could still be called The Kingdom - just send the team into assorted Mid-east countries with Ashrof Barhom's character as the guide and adviser.

With all CSIs rapidly self-destructing - there is really an opening for just this kind of series!

I think it would be good!

3247696,4,B000Y7WGP6,"Let me start off by saying I grew up in an ARAMCO compound in Saudi Arabia since the age of 5, so this film hit pretty close to home for me and my family.  Since 9/11, the atmosphere in this closed country has completely changed.  America has always been Saudi's best friend, but since most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi, an uneasy tension has formed between the two peoples, especially inside the kingdom.  That said, this was a very entertaining action movie.  Peter Berg basically took a real life event, embellished it, and made it entertaining for an American audience.  His portrayal of ex-pats living in Saudi was fairly accurate, although we had much nicer housing than the Americans depicted in this movie.  The structure of the royal family was fairly true to life, as the princes control most of the day-to-day functions of Saudi society.  As for the gunfighting, until recently guns were almost never fired inside Saudi Arabia, they were simply used as a threat.  But when several terrorist attempts to attack certain facilites were shot down, blood was spilled between Saudis.  I cannot emphasize how shocking this was to Saudi life, mostly because their media is completely controlled by the royal government, but also because it showed them they were not immune to the threat of Al-Qaida and other extremist factions.  What this film is mostly valuable for is expressing the quantum change that has occured in Saudi society, where once they felt completely secure, now they realize they are vulnerable to the same threats we all are.",1215129600,22,1551,4.885496183206107

On the surface an ordinary political thriller, but among the strengths of its documentary style presentation is the utter confusion facing the agents when they arrive. Things aren't obvious and clear, and the chaos is far more realistic than many films because it reflects the confusion that would be met in reality when arriving in such a situation.

Other strengths include the clear depiction that not all Saudis support the terrorists, while at the same time there is obvious resentment against outsiders. The ending is bittersweet in the short run, but with the inevitability that the circle of terror will continue anyway as violence begets violence.

What I didn't like was that after more than an hour and a half of seeing heavily armed police and national guard everywhere, all of a sudden at the end it is just our American heroes and their Saudi ally who are left to follow the baddies into the heart of danger.

What can I say, go into this one with low expectations as I did, and you should find it a great way to kill 2 hours.  Yep there are some stock Hollywood cliches especially during the somewhat slowish first 1/3, but the fight scenes of the last 1/3 of the film makes it all worth it, despite their fairly egregious implausibility.

So suspend your considerable disbelief, and just kick back and enjoy the freeway chase, the neighborhood shootout and the apartment shootout especially the part featuring World Class Hot Babe Jennifer Garner putting a four inch blade into the back of some big burly A-rab's jihadi skull after he throws her around the room like a bag 'o potatoes.

Along the way, there are some vague jabs at insight: we see that the Washington DC political establishment is very much in cahoots with the Saudi royals and that the Saudi royals are an equally dubious bunch; that the American diplomatic corps has no shortage of greasy careerist slimeballs; that the average American and the average Saudi both view each other's governments and cultures with comparable amounts of distrust and xenophobia, probably well-deserved; that both countries are in bed with each other for the same bottom-line economic and military conveniences, etc.  All quite reasonable and salient points no doubt, hardly original of course---but as one noted film critic pointed out, this is sort of like the ""...For Dummies"" version of ""Syriana.""

In other words, the geopolitical backdrop is just a cool frame for all the state of the art bang-boom-bam boilerplate.  It's just loads of fun to watch the explosions and blood-splattering...I could watch the luscious Jennifer Garner running around in a snug and sweaty T-shirt with an automatic rifle in her hands dodging RPGs all day long!

With the exception of Chris Cooper and the two lead Saudi guys (Ali Suliman and Ashraf Barhom), none of these guys are first-rate actors...but that's ok, director Peter Berg is smart enough to mostly spare them any overly challenging thespian moments, with lots of cutaways and jump cuts and cool music and visual atmospherics to keep us entertained.  The script has an admirably low number of clunkers for an action movie, too---not exactly Ingmar Bergman, but very few schmaltzy cringe-inducing moments, even at the end.  Don't know where this film was shot, but it does an excellent job of conjuring up the sights and sounds of Saudi Arabia which is a fascinating planet all unto itself.",1204502400,2,2555,4.976525821596244

3247716,2,B000Y7WGP6,"Visceral as it may be, Peter Berg's ""The Kingdom"" employs an absurd premise: That a terrorist attack on American oil workers in Saudi Arabia would allow for a character-driven, small-ensemble hunt for the ringleader to ensue in the midst of crowded markets and impromptu prayer sessions.

Hogwash; such a thing would trigger a Saudi lock down so swift and fierce that said investigation would play out amidst deserted streets and silence. The remaining American workers and their families would be whisked ""out country"" in hours.

A grieving Tim McGraw, stumbling around in a base house near the bomb site two days after the deed? Please.

It'd be easier to suspend belief if Berg and screenwriter Matthew Michael Carnahan weren't so intent on imposing the facts of the US-Saudi relationship - true, but obvious and meant to impress - in the movie's opening credits. Or using title placards to identify characters, documentary-style. Or fixating on the supposed efficiency and forensic genius of an elite four-person FBI team, led by Jamie Foxx, who basically wears shades, growls and  plays cool until the half-hour gun battle right out of Michael Mann's playbook. A grainy film stock can't obscure a rudderless police procedural in which the bad guys finally intervene on behalf of the good ones so the movie can end in a rush of blood.

Foxx is Ronald Fleury, an FBI investigator whose team of snoops includes grizzled Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), a token, braver-than-thou female in Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner) and, yeah, comic relief in Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman). Levity? Get it? Nebbish whining from a geek in the wake of a terrorist attack?  Tastes like dry Strawberry Quik, especially when the geek becomes distressed damsel, and is saved twice from a beheading. Once by a faulty camera tripod.

You cannot imagine a more unlikely foursome. Fortunately, Carnahan's script provides a Saudi cop (Ashraf Barhom from ""Paradise Now"") whose ""rules"" forbid the FBI from doing much. ""The Kingdom"" has an interminable second act in which Fleury's gang seeks the identity of someone the audience has already met, through means that will not get them particularly close. Indeed, the team seems to fall short, until a bit of serendipitous violence - it can't be called anything else - drags our intrepids straight to the rocket-infested lair.

What's left? A meandering travelogue? ""The Kingdom"" knows some things about Saudi Arabia, and even has the sense to compare and contrast cultures, but it underlines these critiques in a preening, know-it-all way that Berg brings to his work. Berg's camera flits about the chaos before zeroing in, over and over, for that just-so line of poignancy - only he does it with varying shot widths, which, in its own way, is just as ridiculous as all those slap-dash, get-a-car-crash-from-12 angles films in the 1980s. Berg's mentor, Mann, falls into that trap occasionally - see ""Ali"" - but not like this.

And the less said about the coda of ""The Kingdom,"" the better. Enough to say that it's as self-conscious and a little bit sickening. Check out Berg's barely perceptible zoom on the movie's final image. Arrogant much?",1204416000,2,3160,5.049904030710173
3247717,4,B000Y7WGP6,"The camera should love its subjects in a film, and it does here. Hovering over shoulders, shooting through doorways, scoping around corners is what DP Mauro Fiore does best, and although it's overused (particularly in television commercials) here it succeeds in breaking down the 'fourth wall'. If you're a fan of Michael Mann (Collateral, The Insider, Heat), you'll recognize strategy of getting in tight and close on the principals. Mann is, in fact, one of the film's three producers. Director Peter Berg's camera gets close and stays close throughout the production that blends political thriller with action in a convincing, moving way. Berg also did a great job of interpreting writer Matthew Michael Carnahan's script.

Most commentators have made much of the action, which, in the last third of the film, ramps up appreciably and really gets the adrenaline pumping. However, what is most interesting in the movie was the workaday banter of professional crime investigators. Writer Matthew Michael Carnahan takes care of characters that are at times world weary, cynical, trenchant, earnest, and committed.

If the film has a weak point, it's the bad guy. 'Abu Hamza', a radical bomb maker and insurgent organizer, is the film's antagonist. He seems to represent the sum of all terrorist bad guys, and Jamie Foxx's Agent Fleury is left to ham-handedly inquire, ""Is this the work of Abu Hamza?"" For a script that's sophisticated in general, it's a let down that terrorist agency is represented by a single character, rather than contextualized as part of a diffuse, cellular organization all the more terrifying because of its decentralization.

The movie tries to explore the tenuous US-Saudi relationship but thankfully leaves it at a superficial exploration of conflicting state interests. In other words, we don't have to suffer through Jamie Foxx mounting any soapboxes about it. This was a wise move. Consider having to listen to a b-list actor like Robert Redford deliver WWO (World Weary Opines) in things like ""Spy Games"" or ""The Last Castle"" and you'll see what indulgent commentaries can do to a movie.

Considering the mainstream audience for which this film was intended, and its political subject matter, Carnahan/Berg could easily have been derailed into just such a jejune 'commentary' piece which would have gotten lost among the tremendous action of the final third of the film.

Jamie Foxx plays the American FBI investigative lead. Jason Bateman stands out surprisingly, which was a great surprise--ironic and glib, he's the obvious ""Gen X"" spokesman who provides entree into the team for the audience. Jennifer Garner (for whom I had no hopes) disappears into the background and does, I thought, a good job. It was a risk to cast her, I thought, because although she can be convincing physically, she could come off as The Pretty Girl, or the Pretty Girl Who's Tough and Smart if her lines aren't written well. Chris Cooper stars as the FBI bomb tech investigator. Cooper is used well in this role, which calls for  a ""crusty"" type, but neither Cooper nor his role offer any surprises: it's a workmanlike performance from a workmanlike role. Pay attention to Ashraf Barhom, who plays the Saudi protagonist, police colonel Faris al-Ghazi. I really liked him a lot, and would like to see him in productions that don't resemble what IMDB.com has as his latest role. Writer Carnahan sets up an uneasy and unfriendly relationship between the two investigative leads and develops it at a convincing pace.  This is a potrayal of the work that men do in trying circumstances, and succeeds on the back of its skilful characterization.

One quirk as a film fan: I always like good title design in a movie. When you think about ""old school"" titles, you often wonder what there was to design! The opening titles here blend stock footage, archival news reports and documentary work (you will recognize PBS/Frontline voice talent Will Lyman in voiceover) and bring the audience up to speed very quickly by exploring (in about sixty seconds) the history of the US-Saudi oil relationship. I thought that was really well done.

The art direction/production design is of uniformly high quality. Shot on location in Abu Dhabi, with much principal A unit photography done in Mesa, Arizona, the art and production design is totally believable. Sound design--crucial in action scenes--is also really well done here. AKs sound like AKs, and M-4s sound like M-4s.

The special features section of a well-produced DVD press can be a treat, or ""Film School in a Box"" as a friend puts it. Jason Bateman's commentary in the 'special features' is quite funny. I haven't watched Berg's director's commentary just yet.

Overall, this film is very entertaining, and certainly worth your viewing as a rental. I'd purchase it if Berg's commentary is good.",1204416000,,4848,5.070263488080301
3247718,4,B000Y7WGP6,"Why is it that the Middle East is such a hotbed for war, strife and death?

Simple.

Religion.

Look back into history. Religion is the main reason for so much hatred and death. It's at the heart of the Crusades, the witch trials and burnings, even in today's headlines with the terrorist attacks and other atrocities.

The bare bones basics of religion are control. It's a means to keep the masses in line. The other, the better aspect of religion is that it gives people something to believe in. It brings comfort to many people in their darkest hours.

Without something to believe, many people would just give up all hope.

It's a horrible fact that there are fanatics out there who believe that their religion is the only way, all other belief, no matter how benign, is wrong and those who practice it don't deserve to live.

These very same fanatics also believe that the end justifies the means. They don't care how much blood is shed as long as what they expect, what they demand, comes about. So, many of these terrorist leaders have their own agendas, and they use true believers as pawns, using their faith so that they will execute their orders, wrongly thinking that they are doing god's duty.

So, we have the movie the Kingdom. It's about terrorists and investigations, trying to get to the heart of what seems to be nothing more than senseless slaughter.

It starts out slow, and to be honest, it was quite heart breaking to see innocent people - mothers, children, families, mowed down by terrorists.

This brings up the question yet again... Why is there so much hate in the world? That's Why must people kill in the name of god, and then go on talking about god's mercy and peace?

You can't slaughter people and then preach about peace, it's just not possible.

After the terrorist attack takes place, FBI agents sent to Saudi Arabia in order to investigate it, since it took place inside an American workers compound.

At first, they're met with exceptional resistance. The local authorities don't want them there, the American government didn't sanction the mission. They quickly become targets.

It's slow at first, but the action builds to (pun intended) an explosive climax. The last twenty minutes are very intense. Hell, lets be honest, the last twenty minutes of the movie is the best part of it!

The movie does give the viewer a very brief glimpse into the culture of the Middle East, and even generates one of the most entertaining lines of the entire film in regards to Jennifer Garner's character!

I found that the cast had real chemistry. They all meshed well together. Jennifer Garner almost seems to be getting typecast playing a member of the FBI.

Although it seems that he is best known for his comedic roles, Jamie Fox once again shows that he can be a serious actor in this movie. He had real onscreen charisma.

Jason Bateman, having grown up on the small screen and is probably best recognized today for the role he played in Arrested Development plays one of the members of the team sent over to investigate. To me, his character seemed to be more for comic relief, but even though he was a welcome addition to the cast.

For me, one of the best parts of the movie was the relationship that developed into friendship between Jamie Foxes character and Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (portrayed by Ashraf Barhom). It showed that despite cultural differences, people can build trust and even friendship while learning to work together.

The disk has its usual commentary track with director Peter Berg that you can listen to while watching, 3 deleted scenes, 3 featurettes (constructing the freeway sequence, creating the kingdom & history of the kingdom: an interactive timeline).

Finally, the best bonus feature in my humble opinion was Character by Character: The apartment shootout that shows the last action sequence from the different characters point of view.

This movie was exceptionally well done, albeit a little slow at the start, and it's worth watching.

3247724,4,B000Y7WGP6,"THE KINGDOM opens with a bang - literally.  A group of Saudi Arabian terrorists attack an oil company's housing compound during a softball game, in what is obviously a highly planned and coordinated series of attacks.  Once the day is over, over 100 people are dead, with another 200+ injured.  While most are employees of the oil company and their families, first responders to the initial attack - including Saudi police forces, health care workers, and one FBI agent - are killed in a larger, secondary bombing.

Because ""the FBI is the lead agency whenever US citizens are attacked abroad,"" as the film's opening helpfully informs us, Special Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) implores his bosses to let him take a team to the scene in order to investigate the crime - and the sooner, the better, as evidence starts to degrade after the first 36 hours.  Wary of the political ramification, his higher-ups resist, so Fleury circumvents the system with a little international blackmail.  Once Fleury and his team (Jennifer Garner as Janet Mayes, Chris Cooper as Grant Sykes, and Jason Bateman as Adam Leavitt) arrive in Saudi Arabia, the rest of the film alternates between diplomatically frustrated investigation and a suspenseful race to catch the terrorist mastermind behind the bombings before the team's five allotted days run out.

Aside from the initial suicide bombing scenes, the first third of the film moves at a snail's pace.  It's front-loaded with dialogue and very little action - just a lot of mind-numbing bureaucracy and miles of red tape.  Indeed, many of the deleted scenes featured on the DVD were obviously cut from this section of the film, while much of the end of the movie apparently remained intact.  Even with these changes, the opening scenes still tend to drag.

Once the action picks up, THE KINGDOM is a gut-wrenching ride.  The special effects are incredible, and the two major action sequences - a car wreck and a subsequent apartment shootout - will have you gripping the edge of your seat.  The realism, I think, makes the ""terror"" scenes much more painful and horrific to watch.  As I'm writing this, Google's headlines scream at me: ""The jihadi and the beheading plot,"" ""New Afghan suicide attack kills dozens,"" ""Death toll in Afghan suicide blast tops 100.""  THE KINGDOM may be a work of fiction, but the images are all too familiar.

In addition to the standard ""making of"" featurettes, the DVD has one really cool and unusual extra that makes it worth the price of a rental, even if you've already seen the movie in the theater.  You can replay the apartment shootout four times, viewing it from the different perspectives of the various groups of characters (Fleury and Al-Ghazi; Mayes; Leavitt; and Sykes and Haytham).  One action-packed scene, four vantage points.  It's one of the most inventive extras I've encountered in awhile.  Yay DVDs!

While the action sequences take center stage, the acting is superb as well - with the sole exception of Foxx, who mumbles his way through the movie.  Ashraf Barhom and Ali Suliman are excellent as the Saudi policemen who assist in the investigation, and I just wanted to squeeze Jason Bateman's baby cheeks by the end of the movie.  Jennifer Garner, in particular, kicked arse as Special Agent Janet Mayes (welcome back to the genre, Syd! - err, Jen). Personally, I think Congress ought to pass a resolution limiting her to action/adventure movies, at least until she hits 60.  When they're done breaking the whole steroids in baseball scandal, that is.

Aside from being a gripping action/adventure/suspense flick, THE KINGDOM also delivers a surprising message on the nature of war and peace - and the human condition.  Far from being another ""git the brownies,"" xenophobic, imperialist, neocon wet dream, the film's conclusion stresses that we aren't really so different after all, especially in our lust for revenge and our intolerance of the ""Other.""  War, violence, oppression - all are a never ending cycle, as old as humanity itself.  ""An eye for en eye"" isn't true justice; doubly so when neither side can remember who poked out whose eye first.  An unexpectedly progressive ""war on terra"" movie, perfect for hawks and doves alike.

Once the film was over, I turned to my husband and asked, ""A Department of Peace* doesn't seem so silly after all, does it?""  He the libertarian (small ""l"", thankyouverymuch) didn't bother arguing, as is his normal knee jerk reaction.  Hell, he couldn't even muster a bit of mockery for Kucinich's hippie idealism.  Given the vicious and oppressive nature of our species, a department devoted solely to studying and promoting peace, cooperation, and human rights and dignity is just what we need, I think.

And I suspect that he might finally think so, too.

3247726,4,B000Y7WGP6,"The movie starts sets out its stall right at the start, with the titles overlaying a potted history of Saudi so far, and how we came to the present time and the tenuous `alliance' between the US and Saudi.  From there we have a terrorist event which takes place in Riyadh, targeting Americans, so that the FBI feel the need to send a team, led by Jamie Foxx, and including an unlikely but strangely believable crew including Jennifer Garner (Alias, Elektra) and Jason Bateman (Arrested Develoment).  They have to work closely with the at first distant Saudi police Colonel whose job it is to protect them.
What follows is akin to any of a number of TV `procedural dramas', overlaid with the political backdrop of trying to function in the unique environment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  That is, until the last act of the movie, which then becomes a straight, but very effective, action movie.  Indeed, the action is some of the most thrilling seen for some time - while the hand held camera approach is somewhat annoying during the build up and political backdrop being established, once in the action scenes there is a visceral quality to events that really make you feel part of the action.  You can feel yourself ducking when the characters do, in effect!
Is it a politically aware movie spreading a message about Middle East relations?  Well, yes and no.  It is in most ways a straight forward thriller, done fairly well.  Indeed, once the action starts, you pretty well know how the rest of the movie is going to go.  However, the Saudis are not just presented as two dimensional bad guys, but a multi-tiered and multidimensional society, which is in itself an improvement on many other contemporary movies on a similar topic. And the final few minutes do espouse a level of political message not evident through the rest of the movie, allowing for some level of pondering and bar stool conversation after the movie has finished.

The man has talent, and I was amazed I hadn't heard any hype about how good this movie actually is.  why is that?  why the secrecy?  The movie is total entertainment.  Right away you see a realistic scene that makes you realize what its like to be there when this kind of crazy stuff actually becomes reality, and in these countries it surely is happening, even we know first hand after 9 11.  But the way they play it the movie is so totally believeable, no suspension of your brain's sense of reality, no hokey situations that just happen to happen so the story can move forward, none of that stuff you get turned off by, just a realistic situation that causes the FBI agents to be in the right place to be thrust into the center of the whirlpool! then, once the heat hits the fan. then it just gets better, really was exciting. I was really thrilled when a certain person really came through, not telling you so as not to ruin it but you'll see.

3247731,5,B000Y7WGP6,"I wish I could tell you the last words of ""The Kingdom"" before I wrote another word. Those last words tell a different story. But I am not allowed.

The opening credits are displayed against black and white clips, while a voice-over narrative describes the growing relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia before and after oil was discovered, a relationship going back to early last century. When the compound for American families of American oil business in Saudi Arabia is bombed and over 100 killed, a hand-picked crew of four FBI agents goes to investigate.

As often happens when reasonable people of unfriendly sides work together, friendships are forged, grudgingly then respectfully. That these bonds are set is a testament that men are men, not their trappings, not their national identity, not their religious beliefs, but their common respect for recognized brotherhood.

And what is this kingdom? Saudi Arabia? Islam? Oil power?  Brotherhood? Perhaps. I fully expected an action movie and that's what is delivered, but that is not the point. The searching for clues for the mastermind of the bombing, the interviewing, the struggle for more reach are just vehicles for a common bond. Two men, one American, one Saudi, both government officials, begin working together, not against each other to find evidence.

From this point on, whatever the viewer expects to happen doesn't. There is a frenzy of fighting in the zealots' own home turf, with apparently every apartment dweller privy to uzis (or their update) and those guns that launch little flying torpedoes. However, with the team of four Americans and two Saudis working together, the master bomb maker is discovered. But there are consequences.

It is not the conquest that the director goes for. It is the story itself, the characters, their relationship. In fact, it is amazing and productive that an action movie filled with violence can trumpet the glories that lie in men's hearts. ""The Kingdom"" is all that.",1202342400,7,1989,5.085889570552148
3247732,4,B000Y7WGP6,"""The kingdom"" is a film supported by a well built script, of beating actuality and brutal realism in all sense.

The initial sequence provides us of fundamental information around some items of necessary relevance to understand the complex of mixed interests in conflict.

A terrorist cell makes a coward attack over dozens of innocent people, this chain of events will lead to F.B.I. to make its appearance as a clash-force in order to detain and stop the future advances of this simple piece of a major complexity.

But when the film reaches its entire development there are just there are three problems; the first one has to do with the not well achieved edition process, which makes you turn the attention from certain details of first-order ; (Please notice that, at the moment of the hair raising sequence of the ambush on the highway; make a pause on your DVD and rewind it in slow motion; then check the previous moments before the attack, observe how is the state of the highway, but immediately after, we have another landscape totally different (even the illumination changes); the  second one has to do with the continuity of the narrative thread (For instance, once they arrive to Saudi Arabia, we simply ignore what's going behind political spheres and the way this delicate incident strikes the public opinion).

But the climax sequence is not only a deserved tribute to the famous film of Philip Noyce ""Game of patriots"" in a similar ambush in Bogot, superbly well made.

Those two defaults make I can't give the film five stars, despite of the fine performances, specially for the natural performance of the Saudi Colonel.

The final lines in which we read the same advise for every one of the parts in conflict, express with bitter realism that this battle is barely a bit of a problem still major, in what concerns to the attitude of both sides.

3247733,2,B000Y7WGP6,"Despite it's magnificent cast, scope and production, The Kingdom has one to many cliques for my taste--which can take a lot!

The film starts with a bang--literally as the opening scene is an attack on a western Saudi Arabian compound that kills hundreds of American families enjoying a baseball game. The FBI is notified about the attack but quickly learn they cannot send a team to investigate due to political reasons. This is no obstacle for an FBI agent (played by Jamie Fox) who in a matter of hours finds a skeleton in the closet of the Saudi ambassador and is able to blackmail him into letting him going in with a small team...a very small team--three other people played by Jenifer Garner, Chris Cooper, and Jason Bateman.

Once the team lands they are greeted by their ""babysitter"", a Saudi police officer whose sole responsibility is to protect them as well s make sure they mind their Ps and Qs. They start to befriend this Saudi officer and gradually all five of them form an unlikely team. As the investigation narrows (rather quite quickly actually) the pace speeds up, and makes the last 30 minutes of the film one non-stop car chase and action sequence which ends abruptly.

While the acting, production, stunts, effects, etc. were all good this was not enough to make up and balance with the bad things. The majority of the ""bad"" was with the story. I first and foremost found it extremely hard to accept the fact that a misfit team of four FBI agents come to a foreign country and find a mass murdering Bin Laden-wanabe within a matter of a week when we are informed half-way through that he is ""Like ghost"". This is Hollywood, thought and no criminal can escape it!
It was almost too simplistic for the scale of production and cast that it felt like I was being ripped-off. It was also filled with cliques: an elite FBI team going against orders and governments, a group of misfits with a sidekick solely in charge of providing the humor, an impossible-to-catch criminal, only a short amount of time to try, etc.

At the very end I felt the whole film was pointless, knowing there are just a thousand more willing men to take terrorist chief's place one he is gone. Fox, Garner, and Cooper giver great performances but sadly the script and story they had to work with was not so great. It came across as a mega-budget, clique-ridden, feeble attempt by Hollywood to be politically correct.",1202256000,,2409,4.647887323943662

3247735,4,B000Y7WGP6,"This is a very solid action yarn about a group of FBI agents sent to Saudi Arabia to investigate an horrific terrorist attack at an American oil-worker compound.  Despite the fact that the compound was carefully guarded, the terrorists manage to inflitrate it anyway, in a multi-pronged attack, including a suicide bomber, a humvee with a mounted machine gun, and a truck bomb.  At first, the Saudis do not want American help with the investigation, and the U.S. State Department opposes sending a team (Jeremy Piven plays a state department dweeb useful as comic relief).  But the FBI director pulls strings and manages to get a four person team sent over to observe the investigation.  At first, their minders prevent them from playing an active role in the investigation, but later the agents appeal to a Saudi prince and are given the green light to participate actively.  (By the way, the scene in which the Jamie Fox character convinces the prince to let them help is a crucial scene, and unfortunately it is a weak and unconvincing scene.)

The film is fair to the Saudis, depicting some Saudis who are religious zealots bent on murder and destruction, but others, also Muslims, who are horrified and appalled by such behavior.  Indeed, one of the most sympathetic characters in the movie is the Saudi policeman assigned as liason to the Americans.  He disapproves of the traditional Saudi investigative techniques (torture) and tries to the help the Americans as much as he can.

The film has a few false notes, but on the whole is very worth watching.  It is ably directed by Peter Berg, who was also one of the directors of ""Friday Night Lights,"" the excellent high school football film.  In fact, he uses the background music from the same artist, and it is a bit unnerving to hear that same music in this very different kind of film.  Technically, the HD presentation is excellent.

3247738,4,B000Y7WGP6,"I don't want to keep a potential viewer from watching the film as it really deserves a viewing, but personally I feel a bit as if the movie offers an ending just a bit too conveniently and neatly.

In reality terrorism, at least of the type displayed within the film, is a very messy and very complicated life.  Finding a bad guy is tough enough in your own back yard, but finding a bad guy on foreign soil, in a land where there are many followers of such a bad guy is not going to be something that would be delivered in such a neat little package.  If it was so neat and easy, we'd have captured or killed the bin Laden types a long time ago, rather than seeing several volunteers popping up to take the place of the Lieutenants that we have been able to take down.

The Kingdom presents fictional events and takes literary license and liberty with the levels of cooperation we might expect to see in solving an act of terrorism on hostile soil.  The actors here do a respectable job of presenting the story they've been given.  Jamie Foxx plays his role well, the always reliable and steady Chris Cooper does as well.  Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner do well enough in their roles too.

Some reviewers complain a bit that Garner seems to be in the movie only to offer up tears, but I think those reviewers are missing the point by a mile and aren't catching the little lessons of how life in the western world differs from life in the Muslim world, especially when it comes to treatment of women.

As noted in the title for this review, this is a solid film, though not spectacular.  Well worth viewing, with some interesting special features and extras available to enhance the experience (the various points of views of the climatic sequence in the film as an example).  See it if you have the opportunity but be forewarned that there are, as with any film really, some political messages hidden away within the film.  Not the type that beat one over the head in the manner of say an acceptance speech at the Academy Awards, but some messages none the less.

The OIL companies and the CAR companies want it that way and the lobbyist and the donations to campaigns help keep it that way. But that aside this movie is an excellent look into the US involvement in Saudi Arabia. It shows the powder keg that everyone is involved in there and it is not in the least bit superficial about it. It shows how our involvement started and how we continue it to protect what has become a national security interest since our cars and planes need the oil.

Synopsis: After men disguised as Saudi Police attack and bomb a compound of Americans and kill hundreds, the FBI pressures the country into letting four FBI agents investigate the site. When it is obvious it will only be allowed with blinders they pressure the local police and develop a repoire and eventually find those responsible.

3247742,5,B000Y7WGP6,"The Kingdom is the kind of movie that will cause lots of debate and discussion. Is it pro or anti American? Pro or anti Arab? Is it a commentary on our current foreign policy in the Middle East? Is it a good action movie? I would say that the answers to the questions in order are:
neither, neither, no, and a resounding yes.

The Kingdom is no more than a very well-acted, well-directed, well-written movie that seems accurate on many levels. Jamie Foxx is a FBI forensics team leader whose good friend is killed in a terrorist attack against American employees in Saudi Arabia. After pushing some very touchy buttons in Washington, he and his team (comprising of Jennifer Garner, Chris Cooper, and Jeremy Bateman) head off to Saudi Arabia (the aforementioned Kingdom in the title) where they immediately run into red tape and restrictions.

Foxx's character relentlessly pushes the envelope of what he's allowed to do, and gradually gains the confidence of his Saudi minder and the government. All evidence points to a terrorist who identity is unknown, and the team hurdles toward an allout battle to try to capture the mastermind and prevent the execution of one of the FBI team members.

Director Peter Berg hits all the right notes in The Kingdom, allowing the story to speak for itself, and making political only in the nature of the sensitivities between the American and Saudi governemnt. The film isn't polemic. It doesn't take sides. It present a very realistic scenario in a fairly realistic way. Of course, there is Hollywood license taken with certain aspects of the investigation, and the script pulls out some standard cliches, but not enough to lessen the movie or overwhelm its impact.

At a U.S. base in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, a terrorist attack leaves many involved at a weekend softball game/cookout dead or wounded. To add insult to injury, as the investigative team on site tries to put together what happened, a second bomb explodes leaving more devastation and the team dead.
In Washington, D.C., word returns to the main offices of the FBI. Close friend to one of the victims who was asked moments before the attack to come help, Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx). Fleury breaks the news to fellow terrorists' agents and then request to take a team in to look for clues. Denied due to bureaucratic maneuverings, Fleury goes beyond normal channels to influence both the U.S. government and the Saudi government to allow his team in. Granted 5 days, they set out for Riyadh.
Assigned to work with the team, or rather to watch over them, Col. Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom) is as interested in catching those responsible as Fleury. It was in the guise of his soldiers that the terrorists began the attack.  More red tape prevents Fleury and his team from doing what they want, but eventually they have the chance and when they do, the pieces of the puzzle begin to come together.
As the team tries to find the solution to the explosion, the same terrorists look at their arrival as another chance to strike a blow at the U.S. and the House of Saud. Preparations begin to launch a second attack via bomb at the team before they can leave. Which team will find the other first and accomplish their goal is what makes this movie a taut thriller that has you in its grip from beginning to end.
Foxx shows that he is a commanding force to be reckoned with on screen. He has substantial support in the actors that make up Fleury's team (Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman). And Barhom does an excellent job as the man in the middle, trying to remain loyal to his country and help his new friends at the same time.
With the Middle East the powder keg that it is, this movie is both controversial and perfectly timed for release.

3247749,2,B000Y7WGP6,"How to fool viewers into thinking your movie is important:

1) Have your movie subject either be about a) a tragedy (possibly based on real world events, doesn't have to be though), or b) a bread and butter subject that deals with the human condition.

2) Add that extra sense of realism and 'in your faceness' by kinda shaking the camera around on closeups of people and inanimate objects.

3) Actually that's about it. That's all it takes. You adhere to these two things, especially number 1, and you WILL create a movie that has a sense of moral significance to it, which will completely distract people from how mediocre the movie truly is.

The action is great, the chase scenes are great, the free way crashes are well choreographed, but we've seen this done better in the Bourne Series. The Bourne movies have now kind of numbed me to car chases and explosions. It's all been done. But at the end, the story of Kingdom seems like a child's dream. Things just seem to be happening at the right time and in the right way for the FBI team to kill the terrorist bad guys. The Movie starts out in a lovely opening style with the whole middleast political background explained via collages of drawings interspersed with real footage. I loved that though.

Along comes the Michael Mann-produced thriller, The Kingdom that attempts to fuse the action film with a dose of political intrigue while asking the age-old question, why are we over there? With Mann as producer and Peter Berg directing, it's a pretty safe bet that this film won't be a complicated expose of the United States government's foreign policy a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Syriana-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000F7CMRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Syriana (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;but closer to a kinetic thrill-ride in the vein of Ridley Scott's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Hawk-Down-3-Disc-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B00008YLV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Hawk Down (3-Disc Deluxe Edition)</a>.

The Kingdom illustrates the point that we are losing the war in the Middle East like we lost the one in Vietnam because it is impossible to tell who the enemy are and who are our allies. At times, this film feels like a recruitment film for the FBI. Do yourself a favour and check out Syriana, which takes a much more complex, thought-provoking look at our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and why we are stuck in such a tricky political quagmire.

There are 11 minutes of deleted scenes that aren't put in any context and lumped together. They do flesh out some of the relationships between characters but were probably cut for reasons of timing and pacing.

""Character by Character: The Apartment Shootout"" allows you to see this action sequence from the point-of-view of each of the main characters which is kind of a nice touch.

""Constructing the Freeway Sequence"" takes us through how they planned out and then shot this scene. As you would imagine, a lot of work when into coordinating everything and making sure that it was pulled off successfully.

""The Making of The Kingdom"" is a 35-minute, eight-part making of featurette. We get to see Berg and Mann talk about the genesis of the film. We see how the cast and crew prepared for the film, like learning to make bombs and how to fire guns. This is a pretty detailed look at many aspects of the production and offers some insight into how a film of this scale is put together.

""History of The Kingdom: An Interactive Timeline"" is basically breaking down the timeline we see in the opening credits into a slideshow format. However, there is very little additional information which is a disappointment.

Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Peter Berg. He actually visited a U.S. compound, like the one depicted in the film, in Saudi Arabia. He says that they wanted to create realistic, visceral action sequences and actually had to tone down the carnage of the terrorist attack that opens the film. He also addresses the criticism leveled at him that he relies too much on hand-held camera shots. All in all, this is a fairly decent track.",1199923200,,3030,5.339622641509434

Characters aren't as fleshed out and 3D as they could be, esp Fox and his Saudi co-hort. You can tell who's going to buy the farm a mile away. For the most part, a cliched and underachieveing film. Too bad.",1199750400,3,416,4.56

1. Whoever was shot died instantly because he was shot multiple times.

2. After a person was shot and dead, the camera focused on him for a very short time then it moved to another person/area. In reality, this is what a soldier does. If he spends too much time to focus on the person he just shot he might be shot by the enemy! However, this makes it's hard for the viewer to clearly see how a person died. I had to watch the movie 2 times before I could see all the details of the fighting scenes. For some people, this might be a turn-off.

To me, it's still one of the 3 best thrillers/action movies of 2007. The other two are Transformers and AVPR (Alien versus Predator Requiem)",1199750400,,848,4.2875

An involved, modern day, sophisticated story; emotionally charged; suspenseful; fast paced and action packed; believable, great acting by great actors....What more can you ask for from a movie in an industry that seems to have forgotten how to deliver a great film?

Fan of the series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CSI-Las-Vegas/dp/B000UX6TIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CSI: Las Vegas</a>&nbsp;will love The Kingdom. A team of FBI agents led by Jamie Foxx is sent to Saudi Arabia to help with the investigation into an attack on a major US oil company's housing compound. The attack kills hundreds of civilian men, women and children, along with FBI agents which makes it personal for Foxx's team.

Foxx and crew struggle with cultural barriers and political red tape to get their job done...and the clock is ticking. They are given 5 days in the country to solve the crime before they will be sent home.

While the acting is believable, once the immediate impact of the movie wears off, you realize that some of the scenes and storyline are a real stretch. There are some death defying car crashes, shootouts that you only survive in a video game and quick ends to those that are in charge of the trouble. I mean, geez, if it's as easy as a CSI episode to catch a terrorist, let's send Jamie Fox or Marg Helgenberger over to capture Bin Laden.

3247776,4,B000Y7WGP6,"With U.S. troops still wading through the mess that is the Middle East ""conflict"", director Peter Berg decided to go topical with THE KINGDOM.

When a bomb explodes in a safe zone of U.S. soldiers and civilians, the FBI leaves its native soil and heads to Saudi Arabia.

The team is headed by Special Agent-in-Charge Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreamgirls/dp/B000O1799U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dreamgirls</a>). With him comes his three person team, agents Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jarhead/dp/B000DZIGDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jarhead</a>), Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smokin-Aces/dp/B000Q66Q7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smokin' Aces</a>) and the lovely/deadly Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner).

But once on Saudi sand the team quickly learns that they're being shuttered and kept uber-safe by a team of special police headed by Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paradise-Now/dp/B000E0OE44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paradise Now</a>).

Angered for being unable to get into the bomb site, the team eventually gets Colonel Ghazi to take them into his confidence. Discoveries are made. Material is excavated. But on the other side danger lurks for Fleury and his team. Bombers are aware of the FBI's arrival and want a high profile target. The agents are targeted and when an explosion rocks through their security and one of Fleury's team members is dragged away (obviously to be executed on tape later), Ghazi and Fleury join forces and form a bond neither thought possible (one between devout Muslim and a Christian).

Loaded with action but little plot, the main sequences occur after the kidnapping of the FBI agent. A series of chase scenes and gun battles culminate to form the final sections of the movie. Heading deep into jihadist territory, the audience is treated to some incredible shots where lives are won and lost on both sides. The ending commentary by Fleury (Foxx) and a Muslim child left behind is very telling as to what keeps conflict going from generation to generation.

Not being a huge fan of the action-over-plot films, I found myself making an exception here for two reasons. First were the action scenes intense enough to keep my hands clenched for many minutes. I hadn't realized how tense I was until my hands started aching. Second is how relevant this subject is to our current situation in the Persian Gulf. What exactly is the U.S. plan for the Middle East (plot)?

Needless to say, if you enjoy stories that have an actual point, you might not care for The Kingdom. But if you're one of those newfound movie lovers of style over substance, you'll enjoy it.",1199664000,,2901,5.992753623188406
3247777,4,B000Y7WGP6,"Jamie Foxx has moved into the A-list at Hollywood.  He's able to deliver drama (RAY, JARHEAD), comedy (THE JAMIE FOXX SHOW), and action (MIAMI VICE).  His role as FBI Special Agent Ronal Fleury in THE KINGDOM is going to further his drama and action acumen.

As Fleury, Foxx gets to descend into Saudi Arabian holdings like the unholy wrath of God - eventually.  There's a lot of red tape stringing him up at first.  But by the time he gets through it, he breaks out the big guns and the action couldn't be finer.  It could, however, be more believable at times.  But that's not what this film is about, nor should it be.  This is a high-octane thriller that's wired for violence and explosions.  That's why I bought the DVD and watched it, and I got what I paid for.

The movie opens up with an attack against US citizens in a restricted area in Saudi Arabia.  The events are carefully controlled and calculated to do the most harm.  Then the cameramen go to work and roll out some of the most intense chase scenes and gunplay I've seen in a while.  Maybe I'd just been away from that kind of all-out action for too long, but it really hit the spot.

The intercut between the devastation and Foxx's character delivering a speech in front of his young son's elementary school class is stark and carries a lot of emotional resonance.  Fleury's friend is giving his life protecting the very thing that Fleury is at the moment enjoying.

Afterwards, Fleury asks for permission to put an FBI investigation team on the ground in Saudi Arabia but gets politely refused at every turn.  He resorts to political brinksmanship and blackmail to get an audience with an influential Saudi Arabian who can make everything happen.  Then Fleury piles on even more blackmail.

All goes as I knew it would, and Fleury and his team fly to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  The eventual team-up of the American cop and the Saudi Arabian cop isn't a big surprise, but the friendship is built slowly and steadily, and I enjoyed watching it develop.  Ashraf Barhom is absolutely fantastic as the Saudi Arabian officer, Faris al-Ghazi.

The cat-and-mouse game that exists between the FBI team and the terrorists, and the FBI team and the Saudi Arabian military is played for all its worth.  Fleury's eventual winning over of the Saudi Arabian prince in charge of the investigation comes surprisingly quickly, but happens in a manner that was totally understandable.

Once the FBI team is unleashed, things really start to happen.  I enjoyed the CSI moments of Chris Cooper's Special Agent Grant Sykes displaying his demolitions knowledge when he unearths the actual vehicle that blew up in the protected compound.  And I liked the way that Fleury worked to constantly include al-Ghazi in every discovery the team made at the proper time, while giving the Saudi Arabian officer credit for the discovery as well.

The kidnapping of one of the FBI team members initiates the final action sequence of the film.  Those scenes are incredibly tense, and Director Peter Berg makes the most of them.  I felt like I was about to have an adrenaline meltdown waiting to see how the rescue attempt played out.

Jennifer Garner got a lot of attention initially in the movie for being a female in the Muslim culture.  However, except for a few scenes, that never really went anywhere.  Her character wasn't really needed, and I didn't know why someone as politically savvy as Fleury was would shoot himself in the foot like that.  But I also know that Hollywood likes to put women in films, so that was a given.

I expected Garner to break out some serious ALIAS or ELEKTRA moves at the end of the movie during the rescue attempt, but I was somewhat disappointed.  I also realized that not being a martial arts star was true to her character, though.  By that time, however, I was teetering on the edge of overwhelming anxiety about the fate of Jason Bateman's character, and I figured the team needed every edge they could get.

The political message at the end of the film kind of spoiled things for me.  In the end, nothing had been changed.  The body count in the struggle had gone up, but neither side is going to give up.  In fact, both sides have the same ideology, and that message ended up being something of a downer.

Overall, THE KINGDOM is a good thriller with plenty of action and tension.  I enjoyed it for the most part, liked the dialogue and the character building between Foxx and Barhom, and agonized - as I was supposed to - during the bullet-riddled climax.  Jamie Foxx is still on the move as a leading man and shows no signs of slowing down.",1199664000,3,4615,4.624846248462485
3247778,5,B000Y7WGP6,"O.k., I love Jamie Foxx - and Jennifer Garner - so I expected this to be what I was looking for. And it was, but also so much more.
The story in short: There has been a terrorist attack on an American compound in the Saudi Kingdom. A handful of FBI agents are sent over to search for clues. Although at first they have to learn to deal with the Saudi opposition, they succeed to win over the good guys and together they manage to solve the case.
This sounds very dry. Trust me, it isn't. The film will definitely keep you pinned to the edge of your seat for the 145 minutes.
The action is extremely well done. Of course there is a car chase, but I have never before seen one like this. And I'm usually not a fan of car chases either. This one had me though.
You all know Jennifer Garner has had a few lessons in how to fight, and she's showing off some good results, as does Jamie.
The movie's pace is terrific. It feels natural, never as if constructed.
The characters are well developed. Jamie, Jennifer and especially Chris Cooper use the little space they have perfectly to paint each individual. But also the Saudi military is portrayed in a credible way. Who wouldn't be mad when a foreign nation sends in his troops to solve your case? Add the differences in cultures and you've got a perfect clash. But good people can find a way out and here they do.
(Of course this is an action flick, not a documentary. I wouldn't go as far as to say that the terrorists are one-dimensional, but they have less space to develop depth as do the good guys.)
I will definitely be watching this one over and over again.
The HD DVD transfer is marvellous. Picture, depth, sound, all state of the art.
Specials include a history time line of the Saudi Kingdom which helps you understand the background to some of today's troubles.
The Apartment Shootout scene is awesome. It's intense, ultra violent, bloody, horrifying. They show it from 4 different perspectives. Makes you wish you never get into something like it.
Now that Warner switched to Bluray they say HD DVD is doomed. This one proves what it can contain. Get it!",1199577600,25,2113,4.420512820512821
3247779,4,B000Y7WGP6,"This movie was definitely better than I had expected.  Usually Hollywood has a hard time dealing realistically with terrorism.  They also seem to always cast the FBI as the typical profiler/serial killer chaser who likes to interfere with the local cops' investigations.  This time they give a different look at the FBI.  The plot definitely brings to mind the Khobar Tower bombing--check out former FBI Director Louis Freeh's book which touches on that investigation.

Anyway, back to the movie.  Good solid action, drama, and cultural perspective.  Also, the movie did not set out to make a political statement--seemed to be pretty fair.  Highly recommended for those with an interest in the Middle East, terrorism subjects and the FBI.

By the way, it is interesting to see that the director, Peter Berg is working on the film version of the book, ""Lone Survivor"" by former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell.  It makes me optimistic that it might be done well and true to the story.",1199491200,,977,4.938650306748467
3247780,1,B000Y7WGP6,"There are so many negatives on the lack of cinematography and one dimensional characters.  The topic of Saudi police and investigation of extremists was interesting and should have been developed more from the Saudi perspective rather than the loud mouthed and obnoxious stereotype Americans portrayed in this movie.

Positives:
 The intro describing the history of Saudi Arabia.

Negatives:
 1st: Horrendous camera work, actually got motion sickness and had to stop watching with a headache.  It was not an enjoyable viewing experience.  The camera angles kept shaking and zooming in and out, even when people were sitting in an office and having a conversation.  Too distracting.

 2nd: One dimensional characters.  The FBI team has a testosterone loaded and hot headed team leader, a redneck old timer, a whiny technical expert, and an emotional female ""cultural expert"".  Anyone with experience knows not to travel into an Arab country with an Israeli passport stamp, duh...  The female cultural experts knows everything about Arabs and Saudis but doesn't bring any head scarves, long sleeved shirts, or baggy clothing to be more conservative in dress in accordance to Saudi customs.  This movie's script should have better quality control for the ""common sense"" test.

 3rd: There are only two action scenes in the movie.  First is at the beginning with the attack on the oil workers.  The second is the final chase and shoot-out that lasts 30 minutes.  Unbelievable on how they happen by ""chance"" to catch and kill the mastermind immediately after an ambush while the Saudi police have failed for years to catch.

  Not all people have the ability to watch and enjoy movies with unsteady camera work and get motion sick.  It ruins the experience and from a business standpoint, limits the market one can sell to.

 I am trying to warn others about how bad this movie is, unlike  the commercials and reviews that I mistakenly listened to.  If you enjoyed this movie, then good for you.  If not, you have been warned to rent or borrow it first before buying.  It is not for everyone.",1199318400,15,2087,4.9854651162790695
3247791,4,B000Y7WGP6,"Movies focused on the Middle East as a theme seem to be all the rage for people in Hollywood. There have been several films that have tried to make essentially the same political statement over and over, such as ""President Bush is wrong"" or ""This current war is unjust"" or ""It's all about the oil"", examples of these sentiments would be the overtly political, dramatic films aimed at skewering the current administration or the war effort, such as; ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", ""Lions for Lambs"" (surprisingly written by the same writer as this film), or ""Syriana"". Few films these days seem to make any type of attempt to put a favorable light on the war effort or the Bush administration. A recent film release set in Saudi Arabia seemed to actually make an attempt to keep politics out of the film, or at least not focus on it, opting instead to merely show our government and its agencies trying to do the right thing by assisting others and showing the kind of jeopardy our soldiers face on a daily basis while doing their job. The film I am referring to is director Peter Berg's (""The Rundown"" and ""Friday Night Lights"") high-octane military thriller ""The Kingdom"", starring Jamie Foxx (""Collateral""), Jennifer Garner (""Daredevil""), and Chris Cooper (""Breach"").

""The Kingdom"" is the story of a team of FBI agents who are assigned to assist the Saudi Arabian government in solving a mass murder of both Saudi and American citizens, and bring the vicious killer responsible to justice before he strikes again. As the team begins their investigation they find themselves hampered by the limitations imposed by the Saudi government officials, and that of their own superiors who wish for them not to get too involved in the proceedings. But, through their sheer determination the team manages to break through these barriers, but just as they do, they find themselves as the newest targets for the very madman they are trying to stop.

I am very much impressed by the talent director Peter Berg has for crafting an extremely intense movie experience full of racial tension, wartime conflict, tense drama, and a little bit of political intrigue without resorting to the same old attack the President or the current war tactics used by so many other directors in Hollywood. It's also surprising just how realistic this movie is, and just how serious the subject matter is when compared to the somewhat lighter content in some of his previous films, primarily ""The Rundown"" and ""Friday Night Lights"". It's evident that Peter Berg has definitely come a long way as a filmmaker and his movies speak volumes to that sentiment, as does his ability to get A-list stars for each of his films from Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson (""The Rundown"") to Billy Bob Thornton (""Friday Night Lights"") to Oscar winner Jamie Foxx for ""The Kingdom"". This is one director whose films seem to attract some of the best talent in Hollywood, and have so far appeared to be worth watching.

The story for ""The Kingdom"" is a very tense, action-packed thrill ride that was very well-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan (""Lions For Lambs""). He has crafted an emotionally charged story that could have been ripped right from today's headlines, in fact according to director Peter Berg the film was based loosely on a story about a team of U.S. government agents attempting to assist in some sort of investigation in the Middle East and the hardships they faced in trying to do so. Kudos must also go to Matthew Michael Carnahan, along with director Peter Berg, in regards to resisting the temptation to include as much political leanings in this film as possible, opting instead to keep the focus on the U.S. agents trying to do the right thing, and leaving the politics out of the equation. However, Carnahan must have needed an outlet later on for his pent-up political thoughts that he didn't use in this film, thus releasing them via his overtly liberal script for 2007's ""Lions For Lambs"" starring Tom Cruise, Robert Redford, and Meryl Streep.

The actors were all very impressive in their individual roles, each cast member that comprised the main characters was fully prepared for their roles and it showed. They all went through training courses on how to properly hold and fire weapons, clearing rooms where hostiles may be present, and multiple other military tactics; all of this was done as a conscious effort on the part of the cast and the director to make this film as realistic as possible and to respect what the men and women of our armed forces must go through on a daily basis.

In the end, ""The Kingdom"" is a very well done military thriller that gives us a glimpse at what life is like for our soldiers, and for the people that are living in that region of the world. A very good movie that shouldn't be written off as being just another piece of anti-war propaganda, but as a movie that tries to show our people doing what's right even when their lives, and others we may not agree with, are at stake.

""The Kingdom"" is rated R for violence and language.",1199232000,2,5032,4.7715269804822045
3247792,2,B000Y7WGP6,"There are very few actors who make a movie a must see for me.  Jennifer Garner is one of them, so I added this movie to my must see list.  Unfortunately, she wasn't enough to save this movie.

When a terrorist attack takes place in a heavily guarded American compound in Saudi Arabia, Americans are incensed.  This is especially true for FBI agent Ronald Fluery (Jamie Foxx).  He wants nothing more then to fly over there and personally track down the men responsible.

Since Americans were involved, the FBI is the logical choice to lead the investigation even though it is on foreign soil.  Unfortunately, the Saudis aren't interested in American help.  Their government doesn't want to look weak in front of their people, so they refuse.  At first.  But a few well placed connections get Fluery and a team of crime scene investigators sent over there for five days.  The team consists of agents Janet Mayers (Jennifer Garner), Adam Leavitt (Justin Bateman), and Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper).

Upon landing, the team soon discovers that getting there was only half the battle.  The Saudis aren't willing to let them conduct any kind of investigation.  And the American consulate is more concern for the agents' safety then helping them accomplish their mission.  Will they be able to cut through the red tape?  Can they find the mastermind in just 5 days?

I will admit I was a little wary of seeing this movie because of the subject matter.  I wasn't sure if this would be a political hit piece or not.  Fortunately, I found it to be evenhanded and the last couple of minutes will definitely start a few conversations, which is always a good thing.

The acting was great, both from the well known American stars and the unknown Saudi actors.

That's where the good parts end, however.

I had some major issues with the stylistic approach the director made.  I get that handheld cameras are more ""realistic"" and are supposed to make us feel like we are really watching something.  All it does for me is annoy me and turn me off to a film.

Additionally, there are multiple quick cuts, sometimes showing us a character for just a few seconds.  Between these two problems, I found it way too difficult to follow the movie and I even felt sick a few times.

Unfortunately, the movie also has problems on the storytelling level.  Except for one of the Saudi characters, everyone else just felt like cardboard characters just doing their parts.  Granted, that might be because I had such a hard time following everything, but it was disappointing.

Not that the plot was really that great.  I thought the idea of a CSI meets thriller had promise.  However, plot points and characters seemed to disappear at random, which left me scratching my head.  And the movie is rather slow for a thriller.  The first part is slow as the team cuts through red tape in Washington and Saudi Arabia.  The action picks up in the last half hour.  However, I was so detached by this point, it really didn't grab me like it wanted to.

The movie was great for my Jennifer Garner fix.  Other then take, it was a real disappointment.",1199232000,2,3107,4.65377532228361

There were logic holes the size of a Saudi oil field in plot and execution, and frankly, Jason Bateman was so annoying you kind of wished they wouldve been a few minutes LATE to his rescue.  So why 5 stars?

The final fight scene, thats why.  You can clearly see Michael Mann's hands all over that final scene, and to call it a scene doesnt do it justice.  Like most of his action sequences, they become less of a scene and more of an entire act.  I found myself holding my breath for much of it, and thats what a good action scene does, keep you on the edge of your seat...and it frankly redeemed whatever shortcomings this movie had.

Highly recommended...",1199232000,3,742,4.257142857142857
3247794,4,B000Y7WGP6,"The Kingdom is an interesting crime thriller, action movie that also packs a few surprises. I found the scenes in Saudi Arabia (even though I believe it wasn't actually filmed there) very interesting, it was intriguing to get a (fictional) glimpse into this exotic and still somewhat mysterious part of the world. I really enjoyed the documentary-style filmmaking, it gave the movie an amped-up edge.

For me, the best revelations of the movie came in the form of the two Saudi police officers who play central roles in the story. I believe that, for at least the captain, he had to learn english for his lines. Both men's performances were absolutely superb. Pure acting ability, they are so genuine & perfect in their roles, it was a total pleasure to watch them.

Jeremy Piven has a small-ish role in the movie, but as always I find him immensely entertaining. He gives another manic, high-strung performance, which he is so good at.

Jennifer Garner shows her athletic abilities once again in a no-holds barred fight scene, total wow - go Jennifer!!

Jamie Foxx & Chris Cooper never disappoint, they both have charm, talent and great screen presence, this movie is no exception.

Jason Bateman was one of my faves in this movie, he is hilarious in his role, and even pulls off the serious scenes with complete believability. I think his performance will elevate his acting career in many an eye...

On the down-side, I found the very beginning of the movie (after the initial incident that gets the ball rolling) to be underwhelming, flat and left blanks where the characters could have been built up a bit more. It needed a lot more meat to it, and had it had that, it would have enhanced the rest of the movie.

The director, Peter Berg, overall really impresses with this movie. I look forward to future films helmed by him.

The DVD extras of the movie were also quite interesting, especially the full-takes, actor by actor, of one of the big action scenes. The timeline is an interesting, informative read and the best part of the extras is the making of the freeway scene - definitely worth viewing after the show. Speaking of the freeway scene...

**a bit of a spoiler alert below**

My favorite part of the movie was the freeway scene - absolutely incredible, over-the-top action! It was amazing - the camera angles, the stunts, and it comes at you all of a sudden from left field, when the movie leads you to believe the story is winding down - it is actually hitting the turbo-jets - but because the turbo jets had also been engaged earlier in the show (twice, the second one also unexpected), you're not really expecting additional super-high octane thrills.

3247795,3,B000Y7WGP6,"Other reviewers have done a decent job summing up this film.  It has some good moments and as an action thriller the final half hour is great stuff.

But one of the things that annoyed me most about the film was that it resorted to too many standard Hollywood cliches.  And at times it painted with too broad a brush.

Take the four main characters.  Each is straight out of Hollywood's stock supply of cliched characters:

-the self-assured cocky commander who protects his people (Jamie Foxx)
-the good ole boy (Chris Cooper--who, after 'Breach,"" deserves better)
-the wise-cracker (Jason Bateman)
-the tough chick (Jennifer Garner)

Right from the beginning the director wants us to know that Jamie Foxx's character is a good guy, and so when we are introduced to him, he is at his son's school talking to a bunch of wide-eyed tykes.  Obviously he is a good guy, because he loves his son and little children, right?  And this is supposed to contrast with the terrorist leader who also loves his son, but shows it by making him watch a suicide bombing.

So then the film goes on and all of these stock characters pretty much do nothing.  I cannot remember Jason Bateman's character actually doing anything for the investigation.  All he does is tell jokes, whereas one agent asks questions, another digs for evidence of the bomb, and the third collects evidence from the bodies.  Why is he there at all?  Well, we find out that he's there simply to be the likable guy who gets taken hostage.  He's the token victim (whereas if any other member of the team had been taken hostage, presumably they would have killed all their assailants by themselves).

There's another cliche in the form of the State Department jerk.  The FBI must love this film, because their director is portrayed as heroic and their field officers are smart and brave, whereas every other government bureaucrat is a slimy dweeb.  The only honorable people in the US government are at the FBI, apparently.  And when the State Department guy shows up in Saudi Arabia he wears a bad suit, a bad tie, is unshaven and totally smarmy.  We're supposed to love the FBI agents and hate the State Department guy and the director wants no ambiguity about this.  It reminds me of Star Trek, where the bad people always have bad skin.

None of the American actors really puts in much effort.  Foxx just doesn't own this film like he has some others.  Jennifer Garner probably does the most with her character.  The only real standout is Ashraf Barhom as the Saudi police colonel, Faris al Ghazi.

The final action sequence is also a bit of a story-telling cheat.  Clearly the writer and director wanted a reason for the Americans to go all Rambo and save the day, but the way to get them to this point was rather cheap: the Americans get attacked, one of them gets taken hostage, and then the three remaining FBI agents turn into a rescue force that takes on dozens of terrorists more heavily armed than them--and on their own turf--and wins.  It's like the director was desperately searching for a reason to have a big firefight, even though it does not fit with the script.

I also found the ending of the film to be really odd.  After the FBI agents are portrayed as noble heroes, the last lines of dialogue essentially equate what they did with what the terrorists did.  For both, it was all about vengeance.  The never-ending circle of violence and all that.  This did not really fit the rest of the film.

It's too bad.  With a better director, this adequate film could have been much more interesting.",1199145600,20,3567,4.634768740031898
3247796,4,B000Y7WGP6,"2007's ""The Kingdom"" opens with a prologue sketching the US relationship with its ally the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a major source of both oil and Islamic radicalism.  The movie properly begins in a ""Little America"" housing compound in Saudi Arabia, where we become uncomfortably aware of an impending terrorist attack. The attack itself is horrific, killing dozens of Americans and Saudis, and seemingly involving members of the Saudi police guarding the compound.

FBI Special Agent Fleury (a steely-eyed Jamie Foxx) works a deal to get his Evidence Response Team into Saudi Arabia over State Department objections.  On the long flight over, we are introduced to Fleury's team: forensic expert Janet Mayes (a stalwart Jennifer Garner), explosives expert Grant Sykes (played with good-old-boy charm by Chris Cooper), and computer expert Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman).

Their escort on the ground is Saudi Police Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (an agonized and movie-stealing performance by Ashraf Barhoum) who has been directed to keep the team alive and get them out of Saudi Arabia as soon as media needs have been met.  However, Fleury and his team are here to solve the crime, and they gradually win the trust of COL Al Ghazi and his assistant Sergeant Haythem (Ali Suliman).  Together, they begin to track down the killer, a murderous local terrorist cell leader.

The atmosphere of the movie is brooding and intense, even claustrophic, as the team unravels the crime under a relentless sun, surrounded by Saudis of uncertain allegiance.  Their increasing success draws retaliation from the terrorists.  In a shocking freeway ambush, one of their number is kidnapped.  The survivors and COL Al Ghazi set off in hot pursuit, ending up in a dense urban neighborhood owned by the terrorists.  The ensuing gunfight is the payoff scene of the movie, a breathless sequence made even more intense by some superb cinimatography.

Director Peter Berg for the most part avoided the temptation to politicize the movie.  An awkward attempt to suggest that violence begats violence is undercut by the stark moral differences between the FBI Team and their Saudi Police allies, and the murderous terrorists.

The widescreen DVD includes deleted scenes that provide some useful exposition on how the team got into Saudi Arabia.  A separate feature breaks down the fast-moving climatic gunfight.  This movie is highly recommended as an intense and well crafted action thriller.",1199059200,,2458,5.216284987277354
3247797,3,B000Y7WGP6,"On the cover of THE KINGDOM DVD, it reads: ""A riveting, hold-your-breath ticking time-bomb of a movie."" some dude from maxim magazine.

I believe that he was the guy that they put up in the luxury hotel and gave him a few square meals when he came to see the film.

THE KINGDOM is not a bad movie, but to say it's a riveting, hold-your-breath ticking time-bomb is a tremendous exageration. Yes, like a time bomb... nothing happens until the last thirty minutes when it finally erupts, but that is where all the plot holes and problems with the film subside. The ticking time bomb... proves to be a dud.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed THE KINGDOM, to an extent, but it just falls right into a long list of movies that I've seen in the past few years that I've already forgotten. Once I'm done writing this review, THE KINGDOM will most likely never be talked about by me or many others.

The story revolves around a terrorist act against infadels in Saudi Arabia. A softball game on a military base. FBI agents are brought into the foreign country to help find the culprits. Yet, they are restrained and watched and trapped in a building at night, not allowed to gather evidence and not allowed to interview anyone without a Saudi witness hovering over their shoulder.

All of this, I found tremendously realistic and unsettling. This was some of the stuff that THE KINGDOM did right. You can feel the resentment of the Saudi's for us being there. They are more concerned and untrusting of us being there, then the deed inflicted by one of their own.

Yet, when the movie unfolds and they start actually making headway, zeroing in on the illusive terrorist that nobody can identify, everything goes predictably wrong. A reference to a man's severed and mangled hands being the hands of a bomb maker. A pointless attack on the FBI convoy as they are LEAVING THE COUNTRY which ends up being the ONLY REASON why they track the CULPRITS back to their hideout. A series of terrorist cliche's that seem to role out like a collection of headlines over the last 4 years. Hidden behind children and women. Videotaping an intended beheading. Terrorists firing RPGs willy nilly. An American giving a saudi child a sucker in the midst of a battle. All of which are true, but crammed into a twenty minute time period, seemed unrealistic, cliche' and predictable.

It's an okay movie, just forgettable... what movie were we talking about again?",1198972800,,2429,4.661214953271028

3247799,4,B000Y7WGP6,"This is an action packed film that lacks any originality and whose sole purpose seems to be to show a)The intolerance of Saudi Muslims b) the ignorance and dysfunctionality of our State Department c) Christians use profanity while Muslims do not d)not all Muslims are hate filled but there are a few who are rational.  The plot was really pretty thin, the characters not well developed,and  the objective of the movie seemed to be to get to the final gun battle.

There were a number of logical flaws and the first comes at the beginning of the film where it is daylight in Saudi Arabia and one hour later it is daylight in Washington D.C.  This doesn't detract from the film but it is indicative to the lack of attention to detail that seems to plague this film.  It does manage to show -- without actually stating the point -- that Christians are not allowed in Saudi Arabia and those that are necessary are barely tolerated and certainly restricted. The FBI sends a female agent to Saudi Arabia -- a country where women have no rights, who are not allowed to drive, who are expected to have their heads covered at all times, and a place where the men would not speak to a woman outside of their immediate family.  Yet the FBI sends her and the only purpose seemed to be was to get to the one point where she is denied access because she is a woman but at all other times she is treated like the men. Not logical but there it is! The gun battle is amazing because the number of rounds fired rivaled D Day.  It was like the old westerns where the six guns never ran out of ammo and never had to be reloaded. Of course the good guys have infallible aim while the bad guys -- who outnumber them and are more heavily armed -- can't hit the side of a barn with a cannon -- in this case rocket propelled grenades.  Then this gun battle takes place in a building which appears to be an empty apartment building because all of the rooms are empty except the one where the terrorist family is living.  This is not viewed as suspicious until it is too late.  Of course the ""good"" Muslim gets killed because this allowed the director and screen play to drive home the multi-cultural rapport between the FBI agent and the Muslim Officer.

So this is a heavily flawed film but I give it four stars because it is exciting and the gun battle -- flawed as it is -- will certainly get your adrenalin flowing.",1198713600,4,2393,4.34304932735426

3247813,4,B000Y7WGP6,"By the time I was coming to terms with the politics of ""The Kingdom,"" director Peter Berg launches into one of the biggest and best action sequences of 2007, which becomes the primary reason to see the film.  A quick primer in the history of Saudi Arabia in the past century is provided during the opening credits before shifting to a community of foreign oil workers and their families living in Riyadh that is hit by a two-fold terrorist attack.  FBI agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) wants to get his forensic team on site to investigate, but the Saudis insist on handling things themselves.  That situation changes (otherwise this is a totally different movie), and he heads there with pathologist Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), explosives expert Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), and computer geek Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman).  But once in Riyadh they find themselves being babysat by Colonel Al-Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), whose primary goal is not to actually assist the Americans in their investigation but rather to make sure they are not killed during the five days they are allowed to be in the Kingdom.  At least that is the line Al-Ghazi is spouting at the start of the film..

The hook for this movie is pretty good, with the terrorist attack and the need for vengeance.  But then most of this movie is about investigating the bombing, although to be more specific it would be trying to investigate the bombing since the FBI agents are put under such strictures by the Saudi police that they might as well go back home and check things out using a spy satellite.  However, the last act of ""The Kingdom"" is what justifies this movie, because there is a another terrorist attack and the quartet of Americans are right in the middle of it.  As a director Berg uses the documentary style that worked so well in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-Night-Lights/dp/B00005JNEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday Night Lights</a>,"" although for most of the film it seems an unnecessary approach.  Then we get to the big action sequences and discover Berg is totally in his element at this point.  The cast is certainly a unique combination of talent, and the strangest part is not Jason Bateman playing it straight, but watching Jennifer Garner fight and having to remind yourself that she is not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sidney-Bristow/dp/B000H5V8DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sidney Bristow</a>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elektra/dp/B0007P0Y7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elektra</a>) and to stop expecting her to dispatch people with dispatch.

Saudi Arabia is one of America's strongest allies in the Middle East, but this film makes it clear that if the country was not parked over all that oil we would want nothing to do with them.  The overly didactic ending echoes the infamous declaration associated with the ""Pogo"" comic strip, ""We have met the enemy and they is us,"" but I suspect the point is more about the ultimate limits of taking an eye for an eye.  Clearly there is some warning implicit in the resolution of this film, but how that translates into foreign policy or political support for any particular candidate is too difficult a job of connecting the dots to figure out.  Part of me is interested in seeing a movie like that which is just about trying to investigate a crime in a strange land under such strange circumstances, but I suspect it would be hard to come up with a better ending than the pedal to the metal action sequence that brings the extant version home.",1198713600,3,3634,5.317626527050611

He wants to make it real and personal -- when you see someone being blown up or an army officer putting himself or herself on the line, he wants you to realize that's someone's friend, mother, father, brother, sister, or son.

So, you can watch this at a couple of different levels.  At one level it works as a CSI episode/action flick.  At another level it works as a meditation on Us vs. Them, and what that really means.  It's not too political, though the end is a little heavy-handed.

This HD DVD / DVD combo is absolute marvel. The price is the same as any other HD DVD and the added benefit of having a SD DVD version to watch in your SUV, your portable player or bedrooms is a HUGE plus. I don't want to buy 5 version of the movie to watch it everywhere. Combos are good for consumer. Even Warner releases that come in combo flavor (SD DVD and HD DVD) cost the same as their inferior Blu-Ray versions. As a consumer, it is very important to say that because the PR campaigns from an inferior format will make unsuspecting customers think that there's somethign wrong with having more for the same money.

And also, this movie works perfectly on my 2 DVDs and 2 HD DVD players.. no problems whatsoever. I never actually had problems with combos too and very little people had any problems that were present were due to authoring problems or replication, but these are pretty rare anyways.

Okay, now when cleared that, I will say that The Kingdom is truly incredible. It touches up on today's situation with middle east, connections with Saudi Arabia and the slow fallout of the tight partnership since a lot of terrorist attacks originated or are linked to Saudi Arabia.

The Kingdom is about a team of FBI agents on a special mission to investigate an attack on US camp, but are faced with a whole lot of problems during their investigation. The movie extremely intense, action-packed and the performances of the actors are on par with their reputation, they do a very good job. When you are watching this movie you do feel like you are kind of watching a documentary and it will definitely make you yell ""Holy Sh**"" a couple of times during the movie's action sequences.

The picture quality and audio are impeccible. You really start appreciating HD DVD when you see Jamie Foxx's face up close and see every pore, every little drop of sweat on his face or when you are surrounded by flying bullets and jaw-dropping sound of explosions.

interactive features are very nice.

In other words, heavy on style, light on substance. One positive thing I will say, is that the film gives a decent look at how conflicted the Saudis are with each other, i.e. the modernists vs. the traditionalists.

3247835,4,B000Y7WGP6,"Background:

Once upon a time, the government of Saudi Arabia granted permission for an American company to dig some exploratory holes around the country.  As luck would have it, instead of water they found oil, and lots of it, and so began the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco.)  This discovery and the resulting agreements for profit sharing gave the Saudi monarchy the wherewithal to purchase yachts with gold toilets and other such necessities, but also brought about the hatred of certain fundamentalists.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Terrorists attack the residential compound of an American oil company, killing many innocent people
2. FBI team of Jamie Foxx (team leader), Jennifer Garner (forensics), Chris Cooper (demolitions) and Jason Bateman (intel analyst) have five days to find out whodunit
3. Middle of movie takes a while to get around to the point, establish relationships, sort through debris, find clues and create a speaking role for Jeremy Piven.
4. Ending rocks

Conclusion:

1. Somewhat political, but not overly so
2. Somewhat religious, but not overly so
3. Extremely moving at times, with characters from both sides freely showing their emotions
4. Well acted in most cases
5. Great beginning and end, but a little too much left in the middle
6. Recommended for those who like well-acted action movies with a political/religious slant and not much of a plot

3247837,2,B000Y7WGP6,"The phrase ""war on terror"" has been so politicized in recent years that many people--especially here in The United States--use these words to bring up their own agendas from either side of the political spectrum. No matter we you stand on this delicate subject, one thing is for certain, The Kingdom is an American movie about an American revenge after all (let's get even soldier!) that seems one sided with cartoon-like heroes and a very superficial view of the present reality in the Middle East. It just doesn't portray the Arab World as it is, but rather as a hostile place where all its habitants are nothing but religion driven monsters that would gladly kill any American as soon as they see one. Not only the film has depicted people from either side with stereotypes, there is very little action--the beginning and the final battle, that's it--but draggy moments between them with bad performances, and finally ending with every conceivable clich you can imagine.

Brief Intro Story:
It is present day in a world after 9/11. An American gated community in Saudi Arabia is attacked by a series of car bombs, drive-by shootings and a suicide attack as they were playing baseball. The devastation is heartbreaking and many are dead. The FBI immediately receives the call and puts together a CSI-like investigating team led by Ronald Fleury (Jaime Fox) who lost a friend in the explosions. At first, officials from both countries denied American intervention, but after ""negotiating"" with some Arab officials in Washington DC., they finally got the green light to go to the hostile country. This revenge-driven team doesn't know that more surprises are coming their way in the Kingdom.

Director Peter Berg (The Rundown) gives us with the opening credits, a background information of the origin of this conflict between the Arab World and The West. Explaining with dates, video footage and visuals how this battle of evermore began which is quite interesting but a bit vague. After that, we get to see the attacks in Saudi Arabia which are pretty intense, and then the problems with this movie begin and multiply.

The Kingdom shifts now to our one-dimensional, cero chemistry FBI heroes. These four characters have virtually no personality nor charisma. Chris Copper is in this film! He is an excellent (Oscar winner) actor, probably the best, but gets very little screen time with funny one liners like ""So we are safe during the day uh?"" which is the best thing he said and you probably saw it in the trailer. Jamie Fox is another dull character that tries to ""act"" by giving overdramatic looks. Their motivations are clear, they experience culture shock while working, they engage the enemy but they are not believable. Neither the way Arab people behave--even the ones who are on the American side are very hostile.

Not only our actors are lame, but also the way the film drags with the unnecessary investigating moments--maybe we can call it CSI-Syriana. Finding clues, visiting witnesses, talking some more about how different the cultures are get old pretty fast. Finally Kingdom picks up a little bit with one final battle scene between our heroes and the terrorist--I'm not sure why this battle reminds me so much of those A-Team episodes. The clich ending is so predictable that left me speechless--also can we play a better soundtrack next time?

Let's give a bit of credit to Peter Berg. Even though, he copies the style from other filmmakers like Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Series) and the producer of this film, the almighty Michael Man (Heat, The Insider, Collateral, Miami Vice), he manages to give some good action moments. The gun battles and attacks to the American community are pretty intense and the drama is visible. The Arab World is seen with great detail (the actual location is Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates). He uses digital cameras with vivid colors. But the editing could have been better--removing some boring investigating scenes--to give more time for the action.

The Verdict:
I'm not sure if The Kingdom meant to be a propaganda film--many will believe that it is. One thing is for certain, the film plays much like an expensive Arabic CSI episode with eye candy cinematography and few battle sequences, but with boring performances by Jamie Fox, Jennifer Gartner, Jason Bateman and Chris Cooper. If you want to watch a film about present Middle East affairs, Syriana does the job quite nicely.",1197936000,3,4448,4.963758389261745

If they offered this movie on Blu-Ray I would have chose that route. But since Universal is only HD DVD there was no choice.",1197763200,4,268,4.173076923076923
3247839,5,B000Y7WGP6,"This movie is a beautiful and stunning rarity: a film where tough, competent, smart characters actually show real human emotions.

One of the investigators is kidnapped and nearly beheaded. He fights fiercely, taking a severe beating but saving his own life by delaying the filmed execution while he's subdued. When rescue arrives he fights his captors, while bound, with a dogged ferocity that leaves no doubt as to his action-hero cred. But in the moments when the blade is at his throat, there is no question that this man is terrified. After his rescue, one of his friends asks if he's all right. The hilarious and utterly truthful way he responds with an expression is one of the best-acted moments in the movie. And when the rest of the team moves in to confront the bad guys, he stays behind, sinking to the floor in quiet shock. A movie that doesn't show the tough action hero immediately grabbing a gun and rushing into battle without blinking gets my vote for something exceptional.

In an intense sequence near the beginning of the film, a young Saudi police officer (Sergeant Haytham) chases down terrorists machine-gunning civilian housing, rams their car, and kills both men in a shootout...a heroic task. In the confusion after the attack, Haytham is suspected of being involved, and a ham-headed General has him subjected to a brutal interrogation. He endures it as though it's something to be expected, but when you see him look at his colonel, Faris Al Ghazi (who is clearly troubled by the process) during the beating, there are tears in his eyes. Simple touches like this throughout the film take ordinary action-film standbys and normal action heroes, and elevates them into something more: believable, exceptional human beings.

When the FBI team receives word of a member killed in the attacks, Jennifer Garner's character starts crying. Throughout the film, she represents the best of tough female-agent norms (watch the fight when she rescues the kidnapped team member - dang!), but also portrays a woman with real female emotions.

There is real conflict and real friendship in the relationship the team, (Jamie Foxx's Fleury) develops with their Saudi ""watcher,"" Faris Al Ghazi, a man who turns out to be a very good cop, a warm friend, and a nuanced human being. Scenes of him and the FBI team leader bonding as they drive through traffic discussing such things as The Incredible Hulk ring true and let the audience in on the careful affection that develops between them.

Al Ghazi is a classically American character, a good cop partnering up with an outsider to solve a crime....an irony considering he's the main Saudi character. But we Americans have a long history of love for that character, and - why not put that to good use? One develops a deep affection for Faris, and surely that can't be a bad thing for millions of Americans to experience.

Faris speaks quietly of 100 people killed who had woken up with no idea they were going to die, and says that if they find those responsible, he doesn't want to question them. He wants to kill them. Fleury agrees, and another step towards a bond of friendship is formed.

The expected is consistently handled with unexpected care. In one scene Al Ghazi informs Fleury that Garner's character will be excluded from an upcoming audiences with the prince that night at the palace - no women allowed. Fleury responds by ordering him to tell her himself. The often brash cop's manner as he opens the conversation with a gently awkward inquiry as to how her hearing is faring after an explosion is a surprising touch.

Is this film politically and socially realistic? I doubt it. But let's face it, this is a Big Hollywood Action Movie. It's a buddy cop film set in Saudi Arabia. But it happens to show human warmth, friendship, and fragility amidst the beatings and gunfights. It shows cultural tensions gradually peel away as respect develops between the characters.

Any movie set in the middle east (or, most movies made in the past couple years!) can be seen as commentary on Iraq, and I can't help but see more of Iraq than Saudi Arabia in The Kingdom. But the Big Hollywood Action edict rescues this from being cloying, preachy political commentary. This utterly American style of filming is almost like a wash of fresh air in such a politicized environment.",1197676800,56,4341,4.831763122476447
3247840,5,B000Y7WGP6,"This movie was absolutely amazing.  At first I was like, man this going to be boring but then I started to really get into it.  The story was great and it was loaded with action near the end!  I highly recommend this film, and in HD DVD you cannot go wrong!  Fantastic job Universal, keep em' coming!",1197590400,6,300,4.2105263157894735
3247841,5,B000Y7WGP6,"Wow!  I didn't expect much from this movie since it received such a mixed critical review.  I have to say this movie delivers in so many ways.  It gives you tense and brutally realistic action scene.  It shows you a glimpse of Saudi Arabia that is torn between religious tradition and modern liberalism.  It makes us question about our war with terrorism and our cultural difference that will continually makes us demonize each other.

This movie is not based on any true event.  So don't expect history lesson on fundamental Islamism.  This movie is not trying to resolve our complex and diabolical relationship with the Middle East.  This is a political action movie first.  It is meant to entertain us.  And if that's what you want?  You will not be disappointed.  From opening scene to the climatic ending, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat.  I don't know why I didn't hear more about this movie.  If you are fan of good action movie (action that is based on some realism, like Heat and Bourne series), than you'll love this.",1197244800,10,1037,4.590163934426229
3247842,5,B000Y7WGP6,"If you don't like America, think there is no terror threat, and believe that terrorists are just misunderstood, this is NOT the movie for you.

In Saudi Arabia on an American compound a massive coordinated suicide terror attack occurs. Many are killed, all in the name of religious extremism. A small contingency from the FBI goes to Saudi Arabia on a mission to find the plotters of the attack. And of course along the way, there are some very exciting action scenes. Jennifer Garner really kicks some terrorist back-side. Jamie Foxx is completely believable and superb in his role.

When I saw this in the theater, people actually cheered. It isn't like Redacted and other anti-American films out today. This is a pro-US film. Also, it shows the consequences of religious extremism and presents an inspiring idea of how the West and the Middle East can work together towards the common goal of peace.",1197072000,11,902,4.85064935064935
3247843,3,B000Y7WGP6,"Anyone who tells you this is ""Syriana for Dummies"" is clearly off his rocker. Both may be about BigSeriousThemes set in the middle east, but unlike its erudite counterpart, The Kingdom is two films in one: a straightforward FBI procedural, married to a pulse-pounding action thriller where the bad boys of terrorism are brought to book in a frantic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>&nbsp;style. The resulting mishmash may feel jarring to the vigilant but there's barely any time to mind it.

We set off with a credit roll through Saudi Arabian history, a punchy distillation of a hundred and fifty years. Before we know it, rabid explosions rip and set the chilling tone, never to let up right to the final clip. In fact it's a good 15 minutes before we calm just enough to meet our principal characters. More as thumbnails than elaborate portraits.

That's a happy band of FBI with Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman. Heroes, they flout State Department orders and arrive in Saudi Arabia with a derring-do attitude, only to receive a cold welcome from their inexpert and ill-equipped Arabian friends. An altogether too many scenes are spent on personal bugbears, but see, the Americans just know better, even without their fancy forensic techniques.

Countering this high nose, as best it can, is a captivating performance from Ashraf Barhoum as the Colonel charged with guarding, controlling and interpreting for these interlopers. Barhoum gradually forges something like a buddy-cop partnership with the main American agent. The film allows him some room, both as an individual and as a representative of his nation and the Arab world, to put across his point of view.

Frankly, this tense cultivation of a quick bond between these two exemplars of their respective cultures is the most enjoyable part of the minimal talk in the film. You won't miss the standard-issue camp humor from Hollywood.

And then comes the slick showdown. Blood bursting, gut wrenching action. Crowd pleasing, popcorn flinging mayhem. This bit is magnetic. There's a mildly mawkish moment when both sides leave a message about ""killing them all"", but whatever the critics say about the distraction of the hand-held ""Collateral""-style camerawork or the ultimate vacuity of the drama, I thoroughly enjoyed the escapism. I forgot all the weak points and thumped right along.

It's not a particularly memorable fare or anything--for meaningful documentation on the subject, consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Looming-Tower/dp/140013305X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Looming Tower</a>--but it does its job and does it with throbbing conviction. Watch it life-size while it's still in theaters. Best popcorn money you'll spend this winter before the Christmas-y stuff shows up.",1195948800,,2931,5.741935483870968
3247844,4,B000Y7WGP6,"I've read a BBC review about ""The Kingdom,"" dubbing it ""Syriana Meets Black Hawk Down."" In whatever way you may describe this new Peter Berg film, it is obvious that the film tries to blend more than two elements in one story. Among them actions are most successful though the same cannot be said about its political ""Syriana"" aspect. The film tries to make a point as to American/Saudi Arabian politics in the Middle East, but I still am not sure what that really could be.

After a brief montage section introducing us to the US-Saudi Arabia history, ""The Kingdom"" starts with a series of bloody and violent scenes of terrorist attack in the American facility in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The film convincingly shows the horrible results of the attack, which may be painful for some to see. Then after some negotiation (or threat) with Saudi Arabia, one elite FBI team is allowed to fly to Saudi Arabia to investigate the case that killed its agents.

The team consists of Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. It is an unlikely scenario especially when you see Jennifer Garner's agent casually wears a pretty tight shirt there and the investigation part is not particularly interesting, but the interactions between American agents and Colonel Faris Al Ghazi of Saudi Arabian Police Force (effectively by Ashraf Barhom) almost make up for the lack of events and movement in the middle part of the story.

The film includes an extended battle scene in the street and building, which looks like that of ""Black Hawk Down."" Director Peter Berg uses a shaky camera to capture the confusion of the place, and while some may think it is successful in creating tension, you just may not like this method as detracting. Whichever way you may feel, the actions are effective, if slightly repetitious.

All in all ""The Kingdom"" is a successful thriller, but not entirely so with some sections that are simply too good to be true. Those parts, I'm afraid, might also have lessened the weight of its political messages.",1195430400,,2028,4.835734870317003

3247848,4,B000Y7WGP6,"Well despite the film ending with a false dichotomy, it was a pretty decent flick and I'm glad I saw it at the movies instead of waiting to rent it.  It's definitely worth renting or owning once it gets out if you like action type cop movies.

This was basically a action packed cop movie, complete with lots of good special effects, but set in the Land of Sand and Oil.

Because this movie treated the terrorists more realistically than a lot of  other movies, I liked that part of it.  The honest part.  Like the United 93 flick, it showed Islamo terrorists as they really are; out to kill infidels.  No apologies required.

I think more American's need to see movies like this one, not because I think we need to be brainwashed to hate terrorists, but because sometimes we forget that the terrorists (speaking of Islamic ones) are completely bent upon our destruction up to the point of brainwashing their own children to think that killing American's and other ""infidels""  is not only Godly, but will result in rewards in the after life.

Thus my comment about the false dichotomy,  and this is a slight spoiler so skip this if you don't want any details, at the end of the movie the film makers seem to imply that the FBI was no different in that they wanted to kill the terrorists for killing their friend.  Of course this is illogical, killing terrorists, while perhaps satisfying some feelings of revenge, is also a moral duty, no different from stopping other murderers.  Trying to imply that American's killing terrorists is anything close to being on the same level of morality as terrorists killing innocents is simply illogical, false, silly and perhaps damaging to our safety.

End of spoiler and rant.
