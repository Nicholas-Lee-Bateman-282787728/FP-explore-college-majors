1828492,3,B000087EZ0,was ok pretty much a B movie,1404172800,,28,3.142857142857143
1828493,1,B000087EZ0,"About 10 -15 minutes was all I could stand. You can keep changing the name, but the only one that fits is ""cheesy"".",1403308800,,115,4.043478260869565
1828494,5,B000087EZ0,"Hard to believe this movie got no review, its the best airplane movie i did see in the last 2 years, good story, good acting, can not be better, definality worth to watch.",1368921600,,171,4.212121212121212
1828495,4,B000087EZ0,"This is a good action movie, don't get confused, this is not a commercial airline with a plane full of panicked passangers, Not at all, is a small private plane with only 5 passangers, most of the trama happens on the ground, I would not said bad movie, but should not be advertised as a disaster movie.",1236384000,,303,4.333333333333333
1828496,3,B000087EZ0,"Was not unpleasant movie. Movie kept me on my seat the whole time, cute pilot, quite exciting.",1102464000,,94,4.588235294117647
1828509,1,B000087EZ0,"I was expecting a fun adventurous movie. Instead script was so boring that to my shock, they popped in pornography scene. Thankfully I caught my remote fast enough to fast forward to try to catch some redemption from the script to the movie. I was LAUGHING my head off, when they literally had a guy on the ground hear a report about a spider bite that happened to be from Australia. So he goes to the hospital and manages to catch the 'lead' on the only Australian in America :-) Seriously guys!???? To save the plane, he reminds ex-wife to 'be the plane'. I'M NOT JOKING! That was actually part of the script. Then, she had to repeat it a few times to try to save lives ...LOL :-) !????  With no engines, she flies into a sharper trajectory toward the ground to 'pull a space shuttle routine' to land the plane at top speed and only brakes on a 'state of the art' plane which had its manual control fail twice ...LOL????",1466985600,,922,4.329479768786127
1828510,4,B000087EZ0,"I  enjoyed this movie, though it doesn't really seem completely realistic. It's definitely watching, and for me - I watched it a 2nd time. It was intense, and made you feel like you were right there in the plane at times. Decent story line, good actors and keeps your interest.",1466553600,,277,4.54

1828516,1,B000087EZ0,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Simply ridiculous.,1453161600,,60,4.545454545454546
1828517,4,B000087EZ0,"Ok - don't let my stars fool you. There's no way with the star system to be sarcastic.  This was a really bad movie.... however, it is SO bad, you cannot stop watching it to the end.  I literally laughed out loud sometimes due to the bad acting and cliche plots/sub plots.  For example, the male lead is a former Air Force pilot (now an alcoholic of course) and another male character served with him.  The other guy keeps calling the lead ""Bird Dog"" throughout the movie.... even in more ""tender"" moments.  Will make you snort for sure.  This is a movie to watch when you truly have time to waste and/or are a bit loaded....",1451779200,,625,4.344827586206897
1828518,1,B000087EZ0,reviews on this movie are higher than it deserves. Waste of time unless you are totally ignorant to technology & aviation and even then it is poorly written.,1449878400,,157,4.642857142857143
