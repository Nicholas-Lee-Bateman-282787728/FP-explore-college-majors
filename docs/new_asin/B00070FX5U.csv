2198870,5,B00070FX5U,"This is among the coolest Arnold movies I've ever seen. It follows Doug Quaid, played by Ah-nold, a man who is obsessed with Mars. He is being decieved by a villainess named Lori who is pretending to be his wife. Soon, he finds out all sorts of things and is getting into fights involving guns, knives, fists, feet and even explosive weapons. There is a man on Mars, which he soon gets to, named Vilos Cohaggen, who is an evil tyrant and keeps all the air for Mars and its people to live on locked up and bottled. Doug soon finds out all sorts of things, meets his real wife, Melina, a beautiful woman who's also a warrior, then the challenge begins. Will Doug ever find out the truth about who or what he is? Will Vilos be stopped? Will Mars ever be livable again? Find out when you see this wonderful masterpiece. Oh, and I suggest you buy the special edition. Doug & Lori are my two favorite characters. Hero & villain, male & female. Done.",1135296000,,943,4.333333333333333
2198871,5,B00070FX5U,"...which isn't saying much.  We've had Red Planet, Mission To Mars and, er, some others.  Made when ""CGI"" wasn't in the modern film maker's lexicon, it contains the best latex-driven, gross-out puppetry that has yet to be bettered.  Watching this film really does reinforce the opinion that on-set effects are far more interesting to watch than a moving image on an Amiga.  The film's story is more twisty-turny than most late 80's actioners, and by the end you'll still have questions.  Which is what SF is all about.

The extras on this special edition are actually quite rubbish.  There's a documentary on the making of the film edited by a gibbon.  Someone says ""I ran to the office with the revised script"" and we cut to a shot of Arnie running in the film.  Someone says ""Paul Verhoven was making faces on set"" and we cut to a gurgling Arnie at the end of the film with his eyes popping out of his head.  This happens ALL THE TIME.  We obviously can't imagine what the interviewees are saying so we have to have brief visual descriptions.  Because we're thick.

The Arnie commentary is pretty bad.  It starts off pretty well but then degenerates into ""This is me pulling a bug out of my head.""  Presumably descriptions for blind people.  He obviously can't remember the film at all which is criminal considering he was paid more than I earn in a year to do it.  There's another commentary by two Germans which was panned by critics for being in German.  But they're Germans.  So they're going to talk German.  Do you see?

Excellent film.  Wasn't worth the wait for the special edition though.",1121385600,2,1599,4.595744680851064
2198872,5,B00070FX5U,"Paul Verhoeven's stylish non-stop action TOTAL RECALL is one of Arnold's better movies.  Featuring the now classic ""consider this a divorce"" scene, TOTAL RECALL bristles with electrical tension and brutally explicit action and violence.  Based on a short story by Philip Dick, the movie focuses on Arnie, whose memories have been wiped away and when he discovers that, it leads him to Mars and confrontations with nasty guys that want him dead.  Considering that this is a 1990 film, the special effects, set design, costuming, etc. are very impressive, as is the late Jerry Goldsmith's atmospheric score.

Arnie is Arnie, who has never made us think of him as a serious actor, but this is his kind of movie, and he is surrounded with some competent supporting performers:  Rachel Ticotin as Melina, his love from his previous life, who exudes a smoldering sensuality; the then lesser known Sharon Stone, who plays Arnie's ""wife"" with a mixture of flirtatious sexuality and out and out viciousness; the irrepressible Michael Ironside, the consummate villain chewing up the scenery; and Ronny Cox as the nasty Coalhagen, who is masterminding all the trouble on Mars to meet his own excessive needs.

This is one of those movies you can enjoy more than once, to savor the lush topography of Mars and Sharon Stone getting her just rewards.",1108339200,10,1336,4.995495495495495

Rate: 5

8/11: At first, I used to think that Total Recall was one of the greatest sci-fic pictures made that got overlooked. But now, I think it's a stupid picture that got overtly violent for no reason. Plus, the chase for Douglas Quaid is what slowed the pace down. Eventually, it becomes a boring tripe with very little going for it. What I liked the film the best are bits of creativity around the characters and the mystery in the identity and whether it's in reality or fantasy. Take them away, Total Recall basically has nothing going for it. Don't get me wrong: the vision of Total Recall is worth watching, and it doesn't look fake to me. Anyway, at least, it is better than The Fifth Element. Sharon Stone actually does well in Total Recall; that is as natural a performance as it could be, considering her long line of rubbish performances. All in all, I wish Paul Verhoeven spent more time in the creativity department but less on violence.",1055894400,,966,4.551724137931035

2198885,4,B00070FX5U,"This is one of Arnold's best. Take a great lineup of actors. Throw in a good story by Philip K. Dick (screenplay by Ronald Shussett, Dan O'Bannon, and Gary Goldman). Add a well-designed set that make you feel you are there. In addition, you have the makings for a pretty good movie. With a few exceptions, it is hard to tell the good guys from the bad and with several plot twists; it is hard to know if you should root for the good guy or the bad. A hint stick with Arnold and you cannot go wrong (Maybe.)

Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) a mild mannered construction worker, who is happily married to Lori (Sharon Stone), and seems extraordinarily attracted to life on Mars. Now Mars is settled and basically ran by a mining consortium. Moreover, the least Douglas can do is take a vacation there. Discouraged by his wife he decided to take a virtual trip there.

Oh no, something has gone wrong. It turns out that unknown to him he is not Douglas Quaid. He finds out that his whole history is a lie. Now people are out to kill him and he must find out who he is and why. If he escapes, the journey will take him to Mars to fulfill his or someone's destiny. Good or bad, we are along for the ride.",1509408000,13,1205,4.280701754385965

2198905,2,B00070FX5U,"Gruesome film follows futuristic construction laborer Doug Quaid as he decides to take a ""vacation""--an oddly prophetic concept (for the time) that involves people getting their time off only through implanted memories rather than through actual physical experience (as I said, this concept was quite prophetic)--but winds up getting his head mauled over by accident (or was it?) and discovers that his true life involves something much more complicated than that of a simple everyman construction worker, and that he may not be the man that he thought he was. Now on the run from those who would subdue him, Quaid ends up taking a cinematic journey into a nightmarish future world in which air (that's right, air to breathe!) is one of the most precious commodities of all.
Sickeningly graphic effects and an unusually over-the-top ""performance"" from everyone's favorite movie muscle man dampen what was initially a pretty good concept for a science fiction/thriller/adventure film. Tragically, Philip K. Dick (who was certainly a visionary even if he was never considered to be an author of literature, per se) never got to reap the cultural acclaim or financial awards that his work so richly deserved in his own time, and seeing how Hollywood actually began to treat his work in subsequent years is not really all that gratifying of a 'thank you,' at least not from my perspective. In any case, TOTAL RECALL doesn't represent Dick's work as a source. Rather, Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon created an original screenplay draft based upon Dick's original tale back in the 1970's, but of course the financing fell through before the picture could be made while the iron was still hot (back when it should have been made in the first place, before all these crazy producers had time to second guess their baser impulses). Dino De Laurentiis attempted to produce a big-budgeted cheapie of the script himself, with Bruce Beresford (helmer of such sci-fi classics as DRIVING MISS DAISY and CRIMES OF THE HEART) attached to direct! (I'll bet Shusett was sweating this deal for a brief period.) While the Heavens mercifully caused that version of this picture to collapse underneath its own misguided weight, brother to the machine David Cronenberg came aboard to write and direct the project himself--sounds like a match made in Heaven, right? WRONG! Cronenberg was always very specific about his stars, and when the backers threw up their stop signs when Cronenberg suggested the brilliant William Hurt to take the lead, the director of THE FLY promptly had his wings clipped by the studio henchmen (even though he had completed upwards of eleven drafts of his own screenplay version in under a year). When Shusett (who was not only acting as the creative developer of this movie but was also busily working on other script material for others at this time, such as the movie NICO, which ended up starring Steven Seagal) informed Cronenberg that the movie was supposed to be RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK GO TO MARS instead of some intellectual thriller (a la Philip K. Dick), Cronenberg quickly bowed out of the project (in his book ""Cronenberg on Cronenberg"", the director mentions that after he saw the version of this movie that was ultimately produced, he had witnessed such an altered version of his own vision that he then ""suffered a migraine just thinking about it, akin to a needle piercing his eye,"" and this adequately sums up every writer's working relationship with the Hollywood machine). Then, Schwarzenegger, who had been promptly looking into the unmade movie's potential development for many years, finally persuaded Carlco to pull the picture out of the development hell storm and finally put the wheels on a great vehicle for him (Schwarzenegger got this movie made--not Shusett--and as such, the star was able to virtually take over the movie's direction from this point forward). Now, Arnold did bring in the set upon writer Gary Goldman to help shape the movie's ultimate third act (wise move, considering), but he also, unfortunately, harangued Paul Verhoeven to act as the movie's director (based upon the Dutchman's previous chops, as housed in 1987's ROBOCOP) and solidified the movie's hyper-violent direction from there on out.
TOTAL RECALL, for me, is an overwhelmingly depressing and gloomy film, masquerading as a science fiction picture but ultimately showing its true colors to be that of a ridiculously violent action movie spectacle, a project that started in the mind and wound up in the toilet (bring your own bowl cleaner when you screen this one). Verhoeven was not the best choice for a director, in my humble opinion. Now, ironically enough, I thoroughly enjoyed Verhoeven's work on BASIC INSTINCT (believe it or not) but this time out I just felt like he was a city employee just standing around waiting for the others (who had already invested more of their lives in this project) to tell him when to head down into the sewers and fix something. There is the presence of Michael Ironside to further distract us from the attempts at seriousness (Ironside made it into the production only because Cronenberg had initially been attached as a director), imbecilic ""futuristic"" concepts that I believe were out of fashion before the movie went into production (a woman with three breasts? NO!), and a loud, frustratingly fast-paced script that had changed so many hands by the time that it went before the cameras as to make the actual screenwriting here feel nearly nonchalant in effect. I get what they were after here--take a thinking man's story idea and layer it up with so much action and so many gory special effects that maybe the audience won't notice that it's for thinking men--but in truth none of this really works for me. Watching this film is the equivalent of walking up a steep hill in the middle of a sticky summer. Its projected forecasts are at times chilling, but the movie is a virtual train wreck (and I hate using that phrase!). Watching Arnold remove an implanted ""booger"" from his nose using a metallic ugly-finder was more than I could take, and this is just one of the picture's misguided attempts at humor. Ultimately, Shusett never got to make his science fiction script into a genre worthy film because Arnold helped to transform the project into a routine actioner instead (although Shusett did seem happy to get the movie made even though his own vision for it barely came into play by the time it was produced), using the cinematic imagination of Verhoeven (a director whose sensibilities run towards the pornographic) to push through a project that is, in many ways, a cheat to the very audience that it had hoped to attract.
The picture and sound on the DVD are quite good, but the orange colors and muted backgrounds always appear a bit faded for my taste (maybe on Blu-Ray it looks better, but a great looking transfer can't save a pitiful film like this). Anyway, the 'making of' offered on this disc is obviously the best extra offered, as Shusett, Goldman, Verhoeven, Schwarzenegger, and others all go on about how the project originated, how several earlier production attempts had been abandoned, and how the movie finally ended up securing the financing from Carlco. This documentary feature is a blast to watch and is not nearly as depressing as the movie itself (and, then again, the documentary is only thirty minutes in length). There a host of problems with the final movie (including the acting, the effects work, the costumes, and even the rambunctious score by Jerry Goldsmith), but in the end what you need to know is that these filmmakers took a quality setup and unusual concept and turned them both into a steaming pot of gory futuristic soup. Even the presence of the then magnetic and beautiful Sharon Stone cannot compel me to up this stinker another star. No way, no how, uh uhn. D+ (the plus is for the documentary featurette)",1490140800,,7920,4.928892215568863

I enjoy Arnold and this movie is an embodiment of his career.

During that trip something goes amiss and Aw-node becomes Hauser, a killing machine.  During his Mars trip things mess up.  The sight of Aw-node's head and eyes bugging will stay with you forever.

I'm not going to bust on the special effects guys.  They had to make do with what was available to them at the time.  All in all, they did well.

Total Recall is about someone who isn't who they think they are until something goes amiss and Aw-node goes on a rock-m-sock-m rampage.  It's still worth watching.",1397260800,,784,4.649635036496351

The idea of the Hero being a dream man is a good one and works well. Sufficient number of laughs to keep it light, sufficient tension to keep the viewer sticking to the plot. The Star did his hi-jacks, not exactly a Tyrone Power or Doug Fairbanks (Sr. or Jr.), but uniquely adequate to the role. Supporting cast was good , handling the varied demands well, that is, chewing the carpet when that was required and melting into the background when the Star and featured players were ""on"".

If you don't get hung up on the technical errors in science, its a fun ride with a nice twist at the very end to keep the viewer guessing--was it all a dream or reality?  If gore or mutations turn you off, maybe you'd better pass on this.

2199059,4,B00070FX5U,"Philip K. Dick's singular mind gave us both Blade Runner and Total Recall. The stories share many truths, or half-truths, as the author would no doubt say with a half-smile. Blade Runner is based on the novel, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" while Total Recall derives from the short story, ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale."" But where Blade Runner is a sublime display of filmmaking perfection, Total Recall will forever be anchored as an Arnie adventure flick.

1982's Blade Runner is set in 2019, and we are treated to a smorgasbord of design innovations and near infinite layers of textual complexity courtesy of Ridley Scott's all-star team of designers led by futurist Syd Mead. Not just vehicles, mind you, but fashion and even urban planning. Despite Total Recall being made eight years later (1990) and set much further in the future (2084), everyone is still wearing outfits that were fashionable on Arsenio Hall. Weak, weak, baby.

Unfortunately, otherwise good actors like Ronny Cox are given shallow roles and much of the cast is saddled with wooden dialog. At least we expect that sort of thing from Schwarzenegger: ""Consider that a divorce!"" after offing wife Sharon Stone. Total Recall still manages to be a very good action flick, partly due to the special effects--probably one of the last sci-fi films to do largely without CGI. It also incorporates many of Dick's common themes on reality, even if the action is moving too fast to digest much of it. The gore gets a little silly here, too. And I hated the one-dimensional acting of Michael Ironside, but then again I always have.

Lots of extras on the DVD including many artistic and development bonuses, plus a director-star commentary whose combined Dutch and Austrian accents provide an extra interpreting challenge.

3.5 stars, bumped up because of the features on this Special Edition.",1365811200,2,1873,4.993589743589744
2199060,5,B00070FX5U,"It's like a nightmare out of Kafka: everything you can remember is false, and everything you think you know about your life is a lie. Such is the dilemma at the heart of ""Total Recall,"" which also has the honor of being one of the best movies Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever made. A lot of this comes from the plot, which is full of memorable twists and clever plotting -- not to mention the glorious depiction of a futuristic Mars.

Every night, Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger) is haunted by a dream of Mars and a strange woman (Rachel Ticotin). He even wants to visit Mars, but his wife Lori (Sharon Stone) is reluctant. After all, Mars is going through a nasty rebellion at the moment. On impulse, Quaid decides to go to Rekall, a company that implants false memories for entertainment, and selects a ""secret agent"" fantasy on Mars.

But things instantly go very wrong when he has a convulsive reaction, and ends up dumped in a taxi. As he tries to get home, his coworkers all try to kill him -- and at home, Lori also tries to murder him, revealing that their entire marriage is a false memory.

Quaid goes on the run, with only a cryptic message from his former self to guide him. But even if he can get to Mars and avoid being captured by Lori and the cops, he has to find the mysterious Melina (who turns out to be the lady from his dream). And as he seeks out the mysterious leader of the Resistance, Quaid finds that there may be things in his past he doesn't want to remember...

""Total Recall"" doesn't stick very closely to Philip K. Dick's original story, but it doesn't shame it either. The story is delightfully unpredictable from beginning to end -- while you might be able to figure out quickly that Quaid is remembering lost memories of Mars, most of the plot twists after that are genuinely shocking. And underlying everything is the haunting question: Is any of this real?

This is Paul Verhoeven back when he was good, and ""Total Recall"" displays him at his best -- lots of action-packed fight scenes, gruesomeness (the removal of the tracker up Arnold's nose is especially gross), and an underlying current of humor that keeps things from ever getting too grim ("" If things have gone wrong, I'm talking to myself and you don't have a wet towel around your head"").

And lest anyone forget it's a sci-fi movie, most of the action takes place on a delightfully sleazy Mars colony where mutants walk amongst the normal humans. Example: Quaid speaks to a three-breasted hooker at a bar. And there's a subplot about a mysterious set of alien machines that only comes to fruition late in the story.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of those actors that is normally pretty mediocre, but is amazing when he's got a good script and direction. He overflows with humor and charisma in this role (""Consider that a divorce!"") and he has excellent chemistry with Ticotin. This is a hero you can actually root for, but we're also constantly reminded that we don't know the real man.

""Total Recall"" is a like taking a rollercoaster ride, with lots of wild action and thrills -- as well as one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best performances ever. Definitely worth watching.",1365379200,,3170,4.618117229129663

2199078,5,B00070FX5U,"In this 1990 movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, an average construction worker who seems to have an obsession with Mars. He dreams about it and sees it on the news. Quaid decides to purchase a ""vacation"" from a company called Rekall that specializes in implanted memories. After all, why risk a real vacation when an implanted one will be perfect? Rekall then offers Quaid a deal he could not refuse. Why not vacation to Mars as someone else, perhaps a secret agent? Quaid agrees and proceeds with the memory implants. However, things seem to go horribly wrong with the procedure and Quaid is convinced he really is a secret agent. After that everyone around him, from his co-worker and even his wife, are out to get him.

In the days before CGI and digital effects, Total Recall stands as one of the last big budget special effects movie. The film from a technical standpoint is a real joy to watch with many well-coordinated action scenes to boot. As the movie goes on, the plot gets thicker and thicker and by the end of the movie, you really wonder about the reality of the adventure.

I found this to be an enjoyable film that fans of action, science fiction, and Schwarzenegger movies would probably enjoy. The film overall is quite violent so those that dislike that in movies should avoid this.

Along with the film, the DVD version has many bonus features that are equally interesting. The most notable of these is a very entertaining audio commentary track by Arnold Schwarzenegger and director Paul Verhoeven and a half-hour ""making-of"" feature.

All in all, I was pleased with my purchase of this DVD and found the film itself very entertaining.",1359763200,,1672,4.775086505190312
2199079,4,B00070FX5U,"Total Recall(1990) is a well made guilty pleasure. Douglas Quaid(Arnold Schwarzenegger) isn't sure if he's dreaming or he's really a secret agent on Mars. This film is loosely based on Philip K. Dick's mind bending science fiction story We Can Remember It For You Wholesale. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven directs and the avante garde, bombastic music score by Jerry Goldsmith is a classic. The film was attacked for its over the top violence. Verhoeven shows the messy consequences of shooting people with guns. The film has some dark humor, as well. Sharon Stone, Rachel Ticotin, Michael Ironside, and Ronny Cox co-star. Rob Bottin crafted some special make up effects such as human puppets exposed to the Martian atmosphere. The three breasted call girl is an homage to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Goldsmith's tour de force music cue for the climax was cut in half due to the bombastic sound effects and scenes of destruction. Total Recall mixes hard effects with early versions of CGI. An X-ray machine scans people for firearms. There was a Total Recall video game for the Nintendo.
Plans for a Total Recall sequel ended up as Steven Spielberg's Minority Report(2002). Arnold Schwarzenegger is decent as Quaid/Hauser. This film is packed with excess. We cheer as Quaid kills security guards working for the villain! Total Recall is more fast paced, wild and energetic than Blade Runner(1982, also based on a Philip K. Dick book).

So at the end of the movie, the screen turns white not black to show he was lobotomized. What will happen is foretold by the owner of Rekall when he sells Quaid on the idea of being a secret agent and later by the guy who says if he doesn't take the pill and wake up, he will end up lobotomized.

2199102,5,B00070FX5U,"It may be hard to believe if you weren't alive at the time, but 22 years ago -- before soulless remakes were a dime a dozen and blatant CGI cheapened blockbuster flicks -- Arnold Schwarzenegger ruled the world. Produced at the cusp of his pinnacle, ""Total Recall"" teamed the future-Governator with ""Robocop"" director Paul Verhoeven, proving to be a match made in heaven as the two forged absolute cinematic gold. Boasting a witty script based on a Philip K. Dick short, mind-boggling special effects and a relentless stream of humor and ultraviolence, ""Total Recall"" still makes for a fun ride after all of these years.

Set in the year 2084, our story revolves around a simple blue-collar worker, Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), who can't help but dream of the amber landscape of Mars. Even as his beautiful wife (a pre-""Basic Instinct"" Sharon Stone) lies next to him at night, he's off in outerspace fantasizing about a life in another world with another woman (Rachel Ticotin). Against advice from his friends, he embarks on a fantasy vacation to Mars that promises an implanted memory of interplanetary espionage and extramarital lust without all the fuss of space travel and infidelity. As you can imagine, he gets more than he bargained for when something goes horribly wrong in the process and he actually finds himself on Mars, being hunted down whilst trying to, in his words, ""give da people da air!""

""Total Recall"" is nothing if not entertainment taken to the extreme. Without all of the social commentary baggage of ""Robocop,"" Verhoeven is free to let his love for over-the-top action and jarring violence spill all over the place. From the opening scene to the opening credits, the film is a relentless rollercoaster ride. At the helm, of course, is Arnold Schwarzenegger who runs amuck through the scenery, spouting off just as many one-liners as he does bullets. Though perfectly able actors such as Richard Dreyfuss and Jeff Bridges were originally in the running for the role, it's hard to imagine the film with anyone but Arnold as Quaid. A good 50% of the film's charm is thanks in part to his performance.

Of course, one would be remiss if they didn't mention the absolutely stunning visual effects on hand. Thanks to legendary (but sadly MIA as of this writing) special effects guru Rob Bottin, there are sights in the film you aren't soon to forget, such as Arnold yanking a golf-ball sized tracking unit out of his nose and a female Martian who is, shall we say, well-equipped. Truly a time capsule of a bygone era, ""Total Recall"" pre-dates the CGI revolution brought on in later years by the likes of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" and ""Jurassic Park"" and yet looks every bit as stunning today as it did when it was first released. The phrase ""they don't make `em like they used to"" definitely applies here.

To put it simply, ""Total Recall"" is the last of its kind. It's hardly dated (aside from some bad fashion choices here and there) and its entertainment value has not waned one bit over the years. In this film, you have a truly iconic action star in his prime with a director at the top of his game, making for a true, blue action classic. Sure, it doesn't probe the depths of the psyche as much as it could, but there's so much going for it, it's easy to forgive the film its few shortcomings. Put simply, ""Total Recall"" is a film you'll likely recall for years to come.",1346198400,6,3402,4.7318718381112985

2199116,5,B00070FX5U,"We originally had this movie on VHS, and I had to break down and buy a replacement DVD. This is a favorite movie in our house. The only thing that might have kept it from being 5 stars is the scene near the end where Quaid and Malina are blown outside while the alien machine starts working. Their eyes bug out, their heads swell up, veins pop. And then when the oxygen is made, they both go back to normal with no damage. Even young kids know it's silly.

However, I so like the movie, the theme of fighting against a despotic overlord, the theme of just what is reality, and the just general action-packed story, that I can overlook that doofus ending. And I wasn't bothered by any special effects either, I thought most of them were really top-notch. Heck, I'm a fan of Classic Doctor Who and if you want to see cheesy special effects you need go no further than that. Some of the ""Total Recall"" special effects are fabulous and the Mars-scape, all modeling, is supurb. The taxi ""driver"" might not have turned out the way they wanted it to, but I think it's hilarious.

I much enjoyed ""Imaging Total Recall"". Ron Shusett explains how he optioned the story in 1974, long before Philip K. Dick was well-known. The 1st line of the story is: ""He awoke - and wanted Mars.""  Just how the movie starts! The writers did an excellent job of expanding that 23-page story into a full-length movie.

In the original story, Quaid was a Dagwood Bumstead timid accountant type, but Arnold Schwarzenegger really wanted to play in the movie. When you add Verhueven, known for more violent action films, Arnold makes a lot more sense.

The movie's outside scenes were filmed in Mexico City, Mexico, and the smog was so bad that they actually had to play scenes keeping it in mind. You just couldn't run very far in the foul air.

""Total Recall"" won a ""Special Achievement Academy Award"" for it's visual effects, so this movie was at the forefront of what could be done in 2000-2001.

2199117,4,B00070FX5U,"Terribly acted splatter gore projected over the canvas of an astonishingly bright, daring sci-fi premise. Director Paul Verhoeven is no stranger to this sort of conundrum, with Robocop immediately preceding this picture and Starship Troopers only a few years down the road, and he squeezes as much carnage and gunfire as he can from Phil Dick's brief initial concept. Oddly enough, it's those moments of unrestrained action and wanton violence that hold the whole thing together while the plot explains itself, expertly blending Verhoeven's knack for tongue-in-cheek parody and reckless self indulgence with Dick's outrageous ideas and cerebral plot twists. Merging the two creators' distinct sensibilities, which appear to be at odds from a distance, actually results in the creation of a unique third identity that's bigger and better than the sum of its parts. The flick's runaway success is in spite a horrible performance from Arnold Schwarzenegger at his most steroided, who grunts and growls in a hilarious near-English while the screenplay does its best to buck him like an untamed bronco.",1335916800,,1097,5.3468208092485545

If you pick a DVD with the name Schwarzenegger in bold letters at the top then you know that the talent level is very low, but it will be explosive and entertaining.  `Total Recall' is just that.  The acting and plotting and general storytelling aspects of this film are marginally successful, with moments of full blown ridiculousness, but the film is exciting in all the right areas and it maintains a level of cleverness that will keep you glued.  The graphics are top notch (if not a tad on the cheesy side at times) for the time period in which this was made, and the action sequences are all pretty fun.

2199124,5,B00070FX5U,"Science fiction is in many ways unpredictable. This film is a lot better than I remembered it. It plays on reality and virtuality, on recollection and fantasy, on what is true and what is maybe true or untrue. That game is at times surprising because there is no solution to a real illusion or a false reality.

Mars is a paradise for mining corporations that have total and free hands to do ,what they want, which means exploit those who work, do not control environmental conditions so that more and more mutants appear that are trapped in some zones where they can survive if they manage to bring in some income through gambling or prostitution. The new slaves of this future world, free slaves that can die by a simple decision of the boss of the planet, the boss of the main mining corporation: just cut their air and they die.

Beyond that it would be spoilers and spoilers, but what is interesting is that the danger this world is obliged to face is the greed for money of course but also for power of those who are supposed to manage the planet. The danger is not outside once again but inside, inside the system that uses free enterprise to be competitive, to the point we may wonder if these films are not speaking for public control of these natural resources.

And yet they are not because public control of natural resources remove any possible choice and competition and then corruption is dominant. We can note that this film does not show any political personnel and we can wonder if that is not a picture of sovietism, the good old but dead thanks God sovietism where the political personnel had full control of the economy of the country, which destroyed the system eventually because they maybe were good authoritarian of not tyrannical politicians but they were null economists.

The second element is that some extraterrestrials or aliens had come to the planet before terrestrial humans and had found and built the solution to produce oxygen and an atmosphere by melting the underground ice and breaking it up into gases, Oxygen and Hydrogen, but the most lucrative commerce on Mars is the sale of air, so you can imagine this alien invention and technology is banned. But once again the danger is not outside, in fact the solution and salvation are coming from these aliens.

Once again, many people considered in the 1980s these films were Cold War films justifying the capitalist system and encouraging all kinds of segregation. And today we are able to look at these films with different eyes. Of course they are entertaining films but their ideological meaning is more mixed, ambiguous and I would say that the main fink, traitor is a mutant, black what's more though the salvation comes from a strange mutant as the main leader and many others who finally find some courage to oppose the mining establishment.

It is this ambiguity that probably makes these films more durable than John Wayne's westerns that are all openly racist and segregative and in no way open to any criticism of the colonial system that ethnically cleansed the Indians to let a wild jungle take over that John Wayne tries to idealize and make shiny and bright, admirable in one word.

I love gangsters but I can't help it I prefer those who get them down, especially when the gangsters are on the side of the law: corruption, you say?

2199125,4,B00070FX5U,"I must have come across this film shortly after it was released, and I have watched it a few more times over the years - most recently, yesterday. I find it as entertaining as ever, but by now it has also acquired a retro quality, which imparts a peculiar touch of chic. I think that this is largely due to the lead actors being still fairly young there, but also the overall style of acting, which happens to be both old-school and over-the-top at the same time - they do not do it that way any longer. The combination of mechanical special effects (some of them quite impressive, some crude) with early CGI work also adds to the retro feel: in that respect the film marks the watershed between two technological eras, almost as if this were done intentionally.

I do not share the view that the plot is too schematic nor that it lacks originality. If anything, I find it rather advanced for a film that aspires only to entertain. One nontrivial aspect, which is often commented on, is that the storyline contains several indications that the whole Martian adventure could be a dream after all. Another, which I have not seen mentioned by anybody, is that the orthodox scheme of good triumphing over evil is strengthened in a most inventive way: the good is fictitious (Quaid never existed as a person; he is an implanted false memory), and yet it prevails over the real evil.

2199130,4,B00070FX5U,"Though I've read a fair bit of Philip K. Dick, whose short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"" was adapted by a whole mess of people for this 1990 Paul Verhoeven film, I've neither read this piece nor any others that have been adapted into film.  Strange, eh?  So I come at this, as I did on first seeing it new 20 years ago, knowing a bit about the basic ideas behind it and most of Dick's fiction, but without being able to comment too much on the work as an adaptation.  Perhaps that's for the best; I doubt Dick would have approved of any of his work being turned into an Arnie slugfest; then again, on a second viewing and watched carefully, there's definitely more than meets the eye.

First off, not surprisingly if you're familiar with the author at all, this is a story about identity and the nature of reality.  Douglas Quaid (Arnie) is a construction worker on Earth in 2048 who keeps having nightmares about Mars.  His wife Lori (Sharon Stone) worries about him and tries to keep his mind off these regular dreams, but to no avail.  Quaid decides to visit ""Rekall"", a company that provides dream vacations that can be implanted into your memories directly, giving a sensation every bit as real as if you'd actually taken the physical trip.  Or so they claim.  But something goes wrong as Quaid is strapped into the chair, waiting for his dream of being a secret agent on Mars to begin.  He starts convulsing and going nuts, and soon he is sedated and dropped in a cab to be sent home.  Now his real nightmare begins, as first his best friend from work (Robert Costanzo) tries to kill him, followed by his wife - who claims she's an agent sent to monitor him.  Turns out that Mr. Quaid really was an agent on Mars, and he's had his memory wiped and a new persona created by Cohagen, the director of the Mars colony, a ruthless dictator type played by (who else) Ronny Cox.  Soon Cohagen's chief henchman Richter (Michael Ironside) and a crew are out to bring Quaid in, and Quaid is on the run through the antiseptic city, and then on to the domes of Mars where he works to find out the secrets that Cohagen is trying to surpress.

Though the ""is this real or is it a dream"" theme does recur at various times in the film and is always an uneasy current running through most of the narrative, at heart Total Recall is a non-stop action/thriller, and a pretty solid one overall.  The ace supporting cast, which also includes Rachel Ticotin as an apparent former lover of the amnesiac Quaid on Mars and Mel Johnson Jr as a wisecracking cab driver, manages to outshine our hero on many occasions, which is fine as Arnold's physical presence isn't really as important here as it usually is.  This is clearly a role that could have been readily adapted for any number of actors (Patrick Swayze was one of those considered for it at one time), but Arnold's stardom helped get it made, and helped raise a budget that allowed for some fairly impressive sets and effects.  The look of the film is industrial and at times antiseptic, and in fact it may look pretty cheap if you're used to the high-gloss sheen of most new big-budget action films, but it serves Verhoeven's purpose of showing a future-world in which the have-nots still seemingly far outnumber the haves, and the lives of the lower classes aren't worth a hill of beans to the few ruthless men in charge.  There's less room for the director's typically satirical and jaundiced vision here, but it's certainly not missing.

Ultimately the big climactic last few sequences ring just a little hollow to me and the last scene in particular is just silly as hell.  But Arnold's last line and a few other touches here and there do help to remind us that we may be in a dream the whole time, and who would want to dream of saving the world in a prosaic, ordinary, believable way?

Another spectacularly good and original score by Jerry Goldsmith here; the man could practically do no wrong as far as I've been able to tell.  The ""making of/behind the scenes"" feature here is one of the better examples I've seen; this comes very, very close to being deserving of a ""5"" from me, but sometimes the flaws need as much recognition as the merits.  In any case, among Arnold's 5 or so best films I think, and I'm sure I'll return to it again in less than 20 years this time.",1277510400,,4334,4.458227848101266

2199134,4,B00070FX5U,"There are certain films that aim to entertain and try their very hardest to keep the audience entertained, if not on the edge of their seat, but rarely are they also capable of making the audience think.  This movie is fun from start to finish, but it also manages to keep you thinking about reality and the implications of the ideas presented in the movie.

Total Recall is certainly one of the better films to come from director Paul Verhoeven whose career I must say has its ups and down.  He's has RoboCop, which I also thought was a fun action/satire, but then films such as Starship Troopers had me far less impressed.  He is certainly better when adapting short stories in a satirical fashion than he is adapting professionally written stories and trying to satirize them like he did with Starship Troopers- Verhoeven's resulting film seeming more like an insult to its source material instead of an adaptation.

Total Recall movie is based on a short story by the late Philip K. Dick, who also wrote the stories behind Blade Runner, Minority Report, and A Scanner Darkly.  Unlike Blade Runner and Minority Report this is one of the more satirical approaches on sci-fi and it does have some good laughs among its fun sets and action, but like those two films it provides some of the best science-fiction imagery to date.

Of course, being released in 1990, what better male lead in an action film than Arnold Schwarzenegger?  Now, the future California Governor has never been the best actor, but he manages to find one of his stand-out roles in Douglass Quaid, a man who is under constant danger and isn't even capable of knowing whether the dangers he faces are real or not!

Tired with his life as a construction worker Douglass Quaid is set on having a vacation to Mars.  Only problem is he's a tad bit low on cash and his wife isn't very keen on taking a trip to the Martian surface- which is currently under a state of civil unrest and urban warfare between the mutants and the evil business leader, Vilos Cohaagon, who quite literally has an airtight grip over the citizens of Mars.  Since going to Mars is out of the question Quaid goes for the next best thing: fake memories.

After a visit to Rekall he has it arranged for him to be given a vacation to Mars from the perspective of a secret agent on a crucial mission.  This dream comes a bit too true as he is thrust into a fight for his life, never knowing whether or not what he is seeing is real or not.  The audience can't tell for that matter for there is enough evidence to support either option.

Total Recall is good escapist entertainment and is often quite funny in a black sort of way.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is charismatic in the lead and manages to deliver several good one-liners (other than the cheesy ""Screw you!"").  The art direction, special effects, costumes, make-up, and sets are all quite convincing and fun to look at and overall it is a film that always keeps your attention in some form or another.

It is second level sci-fi.

That being said, there is no question that the acting in this is far superior to b-flicks, from Arnie to Sharon Stone, who was in her prime when this was made.  They make this a better-than-average watch, but there is still no way I would want to watch this over and over as there aren't any interesting ideas in it.

2199151,4,B00070FX5U,"While ""Total Recall"" imagines a largely pessimistic future, as do similar 1980s sci-fi hallmarks ""Robocop"" and ""The Running Man"", the future here is far more inventive, opulent and painstakingly detailed. The script is witty and humorous, while the plot is dense and imaginative - the film moves in exciting, unexpected directions.

The cast is vastly more talented than those who supported Peter Weller in ""Robocop"". They all make their presence felt. Rachel Ticotin, Michael Ironside, Ronny Cox, and a young, incredibly sexy Sharon Stone, and even little-known character actor Dean Norris, provide enormous support to big Arnie in the role of his career.

Yes folks, this is Schwartznegger's greatest acting turn - he himself even admits as much in the documentary included on this DVD. He plays Douglas Quaid - the man who seeks his true identity, struggling for truth in a world full of robotic taxies and corporations that control even the air the common people breathe. Or is it all a just a dream...?

There's so much more to ""Total Recall"" - I can't explain it all here. Suffice to say that it came out in the cinema when I was only 12 and my dad (who had already seen it) insisted that I see it, despite its terrible violence. To him, the film's gratuitous violence was far surpassed by its intelligence and groundbreaking creativity. Looking back, I'd have to agree with the ol' man.

This is Paul Verhoeven's masterpeice. May he always be forgiven for future misfires such as ""Showgirls"".

Soon Quaid is being chased by a lot of people who want to kill him and he is no longer sure of who to trust, including his wife (Sharon Stone) and himself.

""Total Recall"" is a rarity among action films - a film with an intelligent, mind-bending script that is also filled with some incredible set pieces. It can be enjoyed for its story or if you prefer, you can just sit back and enjoy the mindless violence. Either way, it's a really great film. When this film was made, Schwarzenegger was at the height of his career, as was director Paul Verhoeven (who also directed ""Robocop"") and Stone was about to reach the height of hers (she would reach that two years later when she and Verhoeven again worked together on ""Basic Instinct""). Neither Schwarzenegger nor Stone has ever been accused of being a ""great"" actor, but that doesn't mean that they're not fun to watch, as is the case here. Arnie gets to deliver some great one-liners and kick butt, and as usual, Stone adds a certain trashy quality to the proceedings.

Paul Verhoeven is fast becoming one of my favourite directors and ""Total Recall"" has just become my second favourite of his films (after ""Starship Troopers""). Verhoeven has a reputation for delivering films with huge amounts of gratuitous, over-the-top violence and he does it again here (although, clearly some of the more violent scenes have been cut down to get a lower rating, since the violence seems kind of tame compared to the ""Robocop"" director's cut). As I said in my recent review of ""Robocop"", it is possible that these high levels of violence could upset some viewers.

2199168,4,B00070FX5U,"TOTAL RECALL is a flawed masterpiece, marred by multiple errors of aesthetic judgment and flat out absurd moments.  Nonetheless, it raises a host of wonderful questions, has a huge number of memorable moments, and is arguably Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film after the first two TERMINATOR movies.

Although the story doesn't stay especially true to the Philip K. Dick short story upon which the movie was based --""We Can Remember It For You At Wholesale"" -- it does contain the endless self-referentiality found in Dick's best stories and novels.  Construction Worker Douglas Quaid (it was Quail in the short story, but the studio thought it might be viewed as a slap at then-vice president Dan Quayle goes to a virtual reality company named Rekall that provides the imprintation of fake memories of holidays.  Having had persistent dreams of Marx, he wants a holiday to Mars.  After some prodding, he agrees to pay for some extras, namely, an adventure package, in which he will feature as the hero in an espionage tale featuring resistance fighters, alien artifacts, a brunette who looks like the one who has been featuring in his dreams, and will get to save the world.  But shortly after being placed in the equipment things start going wrong because it turns out he has already had false memories implanted.  He quickly finds himself chased by the authorities before going to Mars where he meets the brunette of his dreams and with the use of alien artifacts saves the world.  Or does he?  Any viewer will be wondering along the way whether any of this is real or whether this is just his virtual adventure holiday.  The film ends with Quaid wondering whether any of this truly was real or whether it was just the programming.  And we are given no answer.

TOTAL RECALL was one of the very last important science fiction films made before the advent of CGI.  It was one of the last to employ primarily miniatures and matte paintings rather than SCI.  Even BABYLON 5 only three years later on television would use crude CGI for most of its special effects visuals.  In this way TOTAL RECALL is the end of an era.  Only a year later TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY would be released.  Many of its greatest special effects were CGI.  So in two straight films Schwarzenegger helped close one chapter of SF history and opened another.

The problem with TOTAL RECALL is that there are just too many moments that don't quite work.  The inhabitants in the mutant section of underground Mars are just too comical self-indulgently mannered to contribute much to the film.  And the animatronic rebel leader Kuato, who is inextricably attached to the body of another person, is easily one of th emost ludicrous SF creations since the original THE FLY, where at the end of the film we see a fly with the head of a screaming David Hedison, as it is about to be eaten by a spider.  There are a host of terrible little lapses in judgment like this.  The most unfortunate might be the climax of the film, as Quaid has turned on generators that will oxygenate the atmosphere of Mars.  The ludicrousness comes not from the amazingly rapid creation of a breathable atmosphere for the planet, but from their completely ignoring the fact that the surface temperature of Mars is roughing that of Antarctica in the middle of winter.  The visuals of Arnold and his female friend as they roll on the surface of Mars has to be one of the silliest sights in the history of big budget films.  In real life they wouldn't have had to worry about air pressure; they would have frozen solid in only a few seconds.

All in all, this is both a truly rewarding and an immensely frustrating film to watch.  It contains both a host of truly remarkable and utterly horrid moments.  For me the good outweighs the bad and what we see in the end is a fascinating if undeniably flawed film.",1210464000,,3849,4.669139465875371

2199170,5,B00070FX5U,"What if you could have memories implanted?  What if the implanted memories were so real that you could not tell the difference between the implanted memories and reality?  What if you went to a place that implanted such memories and when you woke up, you discovered that you had lost your sense of reality and you no longer knew who you were?

Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a laborer living an apparent life of ease (and luxury - laborers must be paid really well in 2084) with his beautiful wife Lori (Sharon Stone).  Life is good for Douglas and Lori, until Douglas gets it into his head that he wants to take a trip to Mars.  Of course, Douglas is unable to go to Mars (Lori does not want to emigrate to Mars), so Douglas heads off to Rekall to get a brain implant.

Implanted memories are no big deal.  You go in, they put you under, you get an implanted memory, and you go home thinking you had a great time on Mars.  Douglas chose to be a spy and have a beautiful girlfriend.  Unfortunately, the friendly folks at Rekall discover that Douglas had already had an implant and their attempt to implant a new memory was creating problems in Douglas's brain.  However, the people at Rekall are able to cover up the problem and Douglas seems to walk away from Rekall without problems.

Unfortunately for Douglas, his wife is quite upset that Douglas went to Rekall.  So upset that she works Douglas over.  The next thing Douglas knows, a bunch of guys with really big guns are trying to blow him away and he is running for his life.

Douglas can only do one thing.  He heads for Mars and the answers to his questions.  Things on Mars get even more interesting.  A man with a dictator's power, Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox, ""Deliverance"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop""), controls Mars.  Quaid seems caught between mutants, Cohaagen and Cohaagen's henchmen, led by Richter (Michael Ironside, ""Scanners,"" ""Watchers,"" and ""Starship Troopers"").  Of course, Quaid's murderous wife is still running around.  Then there are the aliens.  You will have to watch.

This movie is filled with action and allows you enough time to wonder what is real and what is fantasy, nearly to the end of the movie.  I thought the special effects were quite good for 1990.  There are places where you can easily see that a set is a miniature, but other miniatures are beautiful and wonderfully meshed with full-sized sets.

Director Paul Verhoeven and a team of writers did a wonderful job of building on a 1966 Philip K. Dick short story, ""We Can Remember It for You.""  Even with some dated effects and styles, the movie still plays well, especially once the movie shifts to Mars.  I absolutely loved the action-packed ending, wondering just how Quaid was going to survive.  Fans of Philip K. Dick, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, Rachel Ticotin and science fiction movies have to see this excellent movie, one of Arnold's best.

2199171,5,B00070FX5U,"Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is uneasy.  Things are not right in the world.  Sure, he has a nice place to live, a decent job in construction, and a beautiful wife (Sharon Stone) -- but he has a feeling he is missing out on something, that there is something false about his life, and that his destiny is elsewhere, maybe on Mars.  He watches the news, reports of terrorist attacks, and reassurances of the government that everything is under control.  He dreams of walking the red soil with a woman who is not his wife.  Then, he hears about the company Rekall and their promise to deliver memories on demand, and takes advantage of their ""special agent"" package that will give him true to life memories of having been a secret agent on Mars, attached to a woman just like the one in his dreams.  The hijinks that ensue, when he apparently finds out that he really IS a secret agent from Mars, whose memories had been erased, are lots of fun.  What elevates the film above similar features like Running Man is that the action (which can get pretty violent) and adventure is tied to philosophical questions about the nature of memory and knowledge, and on the power of skepticism.

You don't need to imagine high-tech corporations capable of implanting memories to realize that memory is a dubious source of knowledge.  We remember selectively at best, and psychological experiments have shown that memories can be altered and manipulated.  One of the basic questions the film poses is whether Quaid should trust his memory and instincts or his reason.  He needs to consider which is more likely: that he is a secret agent whose memories have been erased to make him seem like a lowly construction worker or whether the memory implant he actually remembers having chosen and that would make him remember to have been a secret agent with a sleazy brunette girlfriend has simply kicked in and is malfunctioning.  Reason favors the simplest explanation; but Quaid of course goes with his gut.  Does he choose correctly?

The plot of the film, then centers around the basic philosophical question how can we know what we think we know.  It poses this question by means of a bizarre but entertaining science fiction scenario (drawn loosely from a story by Phillip K. Dick).  That the question is not merely academic for Paul Verhoeven, however, is suggested by how similar the news reports from Mars are to those that we hear (and were hearing even in 1990 when the film was released) from the middle East.  On Verhoeven's Mars, a group of rebels is fighting the governmental controls of society that are intended to secure its access to ""Tribinium ore"" -- a tremendous source of energy.  Because these rebels lack governmentally sanctioned legitimacy, their struggles to save their planet and way of life are labelled ""terrorism.""  The parallels are obvious.  The most significant brand of skepticism raised by this film is not the academic form that asks ""how can I know whether I am not dreaming"" but the very healthy and necessary political skepticism that asks ""how far can we trust the media to present the facts about our world in an unbiased way?""'  While Quaid may well be mistaken in his belief that he is really  a secret agent, he is certainly right to be troubled about the distortions regarding the Middle East (um, Mars, that is) that are presented by the popular media.  As with most of the best of his films (Starship Troopers, Robocop, Black Book), Paul Verhoeven presents a powerful critique of contemporary society under the guise of a lightweight entertaining popcorn flick.

However, this review will not be the typical recounting of cheesey special effects, and how the plot cannot be possible because of the time-space continuim. This is Sid the Elf baby! You know what that means? Thats right: It's turbo time! If we, Sid the Elf, are reviewing this film, chances are it is pretty sweet and really funny. In Total Recall, Arnold plays Douglas Quaid. This is one of the coolest parts in movie history. He is a good-natured guy who will, if you cross him, rip your arms off and beat you to death with them. He is an adventerous and somewhat discontented construction worker in 2084 who has a strange fixation with Mars and wants to vacation there. That would be like wanting to vacation in Detroit now. His wife, played by ""just starting to become hot"" Sharron Stone, does not want to do that vacation, oddly. So, Arnold decides to get a vacation memory of Mars implanted, which aparently you will be able to do. Yeah, awesome. So, it turns out that his life now, as a construction worker, is a memory implantation. He's actually a secret agent on Mars, fighting a dictator who sells oxygen to the citizens. And his wife is a double agent who tries to kill him. Was this a political comentary on where America is heading? Sid doesn't know, but he does know that this movie rocked. It was an awesome premise for a movie, and it actually was the perfect vehicle for Arnold. This flick had 35 soundboard lines. Yes, 35. That's good enough to break into the Arnold movie pantheon. We even thought Total Recall was in the same league as Predator.

You can't argue Arnold's prowess. His hillarious voice and rippling muscles have a magnitism that can't be touched. He is totally dominating Sid's reviews right now. Total Recall is too good to not give the Sid the Elf Seal of Approval, 5 stars, or Joe Bob's Drive-In Totals. So, here it goes:

2199176,5,B00070FX5U,"""Total Recall,"" (1990), a sci-fi action thriller set sometime in the future, stars Arnold Schwarzenegger.  It's based on ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale,"" a short story by the noted sci fi author Philip K. Dick, was penned for the screen by Ronald Shusett, and was directed by Paul Verhoeven.  It boasts a high-quality score by Jerry Goldsmith.  And it's as easy to like as its affable, hugely muscular star, who, we know, has gone far in real life, too.

The film's set in Mexico City future, and on the famously red planet, Mars, where they've found something worth mining, leading to its colonization from Earth.  Unfortunately, however, the planet has no atmosphere, thus no oxygen: all settlers and tourists must stay within an immense dome, and pay the local administration for air.  Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, supposedly an ordinary earthly construction worker, though married to the beauteous young Lori (Sharon Stone).  But Quaid is actually a recently brainwashed incarnation of Hauser, who was a big man on Mars as an administration spy.  Quaid dreams of the red planet, and is so strongly drawn back there that he goes to a firm called Rekall, that implants pleasant memories, of whatever virtual vacation a client might select, in the subject's brain.  But Quaid pays extra to virtually vacation as a spy, in cahoots with Melina, the sleazy-demure girl(Rachel Ticotin) he's chosen from the book.  Problems arise, and Quaid must beat it back to Mars.

Verhoeven is a good action director -- he also gave us ""Robocop--"" and he's got a down and dirty Dutch touch.  Sets are good: neither Mars, nor the city of the future, has too much of a cardboard look.  And, in fact, just when things look most spacey, we're wittily, abruptly brought down to earth by something that still looks a lot like present-day Mexico City, to those who know it, or a can of Pepsi, a neon ""lite"" beer sign, or a sidewalk newspaper vending machine selling ""Mars Today,"" in the familiar red logo of ""USA Today.""  The citizens of Mars' Venusville, and its physical appearance, are spicy hot hot hot.  The dialogue is witty -- Schwarzenegger gets off a couple of his famous one-liners, including ""Consider this a divorce.""  The plot's good, and quick, satisfyingly complex, and has quite a few witty moments, too.

Schwarzenegger receives strong backing from an athletic young Stone as his wife,and Latina Ticotin as the sleazy-demure other woman: they're quite likely the best parts either woman ever had.  The supporting players are solid.  That European hand of director Verhoeven is frequently evident.  There's a lot more blood, sweat, and spit than we're used to seeing in movies, and a closer look is taken, for example, at some dying goldfish, than we're accustomed to.  (Quite possibly, closer than we would prefer.)

Verhoeven, unhappily, lets his special effects get the best of him in the film's last few minutes: they have a ""Grand Guignol"" quality not to everyone's taste.  But it's an entertaining, interesting movie up until then.",1188518400,,3044,4.960552268244576

Nothing is as dated as the misguided futurism of yesterday. But that does not mean it is a bad movie, only one where some of the ""futuristic"" elements haven't aged all that well.

But the main thing about the film is of course the Big Question -- what of this, if any of it, is ""real"", what is imagined? Not that I want to sidestep that question, but has anybody ever considered the fact that this is a fricking _movie_? In other words, the whole thing is a fantasy, and those ""dream-implanting machines"" are just the fancy sci-fi analogue of a movie theater! The one who is getting false memories implanted is not Arnie's character, but the audience who is watching this (and tries to find out if it real or not), i.e. YOU.

Consider this movie a comment on the act of film-watching itself. That you ask questions about the reality of it all really only shows you are ignoring the obvious thing, the cinema/plasma/TFT screen in front of you.

Maybe that is a daring hypothesis, but then again&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starship-Troopers/dp/0767802659/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starship Troopers</a>&nbsp;and Verhoeven's other films are certainly not to be taken at face value either, so I guess suspecting that the director is trying to make an ironic statement here about his profession is not so far-fetched after all.

And within the reality of the movie, it is made quite clear that, once the technology to fake memories perfectly has been invented, you can _never_ again be sure of what is real and what isn't. And therefore, it does not make sense for Arnie's character to ask himself that. ""Your mind will not know the difference"", so what would be the point?

And ultimately, we cannot verify our ""real"" memories either. You may live now and have memories of what you did a week ago, but there is no way for you to go back to make sure you really did what you thought you did a week ago. So from that standpoint we are not in a better position than Arnie's character, except that we generally do not question the validity of our memory very much, even though means exist (hypnosis) to alter it just as effectively as with the (hopefully) fictional machine in this movie.",1185235200,,2713,5.126696832579186

A pretty good film that does manage to deal with Philip K. Dick's ideas regarding the nature of reality.  I never understood how the simple laborer had such a glamorous life before the action begins but it doesn't really ruin anything.  The action is good and the effects have stood up fairly well although CGI could improve some of the facial effects.  All in all this film stands up after time and is still fun to watch.",1156809600,10,1290,4.220408163265306

8044392,2,B00070FX5U,"Actually the plot wasn't all that bad - just typical fare for Arnold's starting career. It has its ups and downs - decent acting, good action - and then the ruining portion of filthy language and non-gratuitous violence. If you saw ""Running Man"" then you know where this flick is headed. Without the unnecessary trash language it could merit a 3****.  Just watch at your own risk - you may endure to the end or shutdown after the first 20 minutes.",1525564800,,447,4.518518518518518
