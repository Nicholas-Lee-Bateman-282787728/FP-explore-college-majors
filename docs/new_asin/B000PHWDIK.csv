8191605,5,B000PHWDIK,"This video features some of the most highly regarded athletes in Thoroughbred racing.  All familar names and faces, all at the top of their game, all with a remarkable talent for being able to ""read"" and understand a horse and know in split-second timing how to guide a horse to the winner's circle.  It was great to relive some of the peak moments in their careers as well as seeing, once again, the incredible horses that won the Kentucky Derby.  Jockeys are too often overlooked when people think of truly great athletes and this video gives them some of the credit they deserve.  I think anyone who appreciates Thoroughbred racing and the prestige of the Kentucky Derby, it's horses and their jockeys will enjoy having this as part of their video library.",1361491200,3,759,4.7272727272727275
8191606,1,B000PHWDIK,"Normally I am happy with my Amazon purchases, however, not this one. I bought and paid for a new copy and got a used, dirty - not even wrapped mess. The only thing good about it is the DVD did play. I sent an e-mail and got no response. If you buy and ppay for new - you should get new.",1360195200,,286,3.7049180327868854

8191610,4,B000PHWDIK,"A good - but very brief - documentary on the lives of professional jockeys. Just wish it had been a little longer ... maybe a good documentary series on PBS?

Also, nothing was said about the state of contemporary racing -- why are jockeys still required to keep such dangerously low weight? What about the over-breeding and the fact that thousands of TBs end up going to kill auctions? Where are the female jockeys? I didn't see a single one in this film yet they do work in the business and there are professional female jockeys out there.

A great film but would have been better had they discussed some of the real controversies around this zillion-dollar sport that kills so many horses and jockeys.",1207353600,10,704,4.624
8191611,5,B000PHWDIK,"The first Saturday in May is the celebration of American Thoroughbred racing, as the eyes of the world gazez upon the historic Twin Spires at Churchill Downs for the Kentucky Derby.

And what fans view are the finished products; perhaps not realizing that the maxiumum of 20 racers have made the grade from a total foal crop of 30,000-plus a mere three years before, with jockeys who have clawed their way to the top of the game while overcoming injuries and - for some - terrible personal demons, along with the trainers & owners, who spend years of blood, sweat and tears on trying to capture lightning in a jar for turf immortality.

The DVD is an insider's view into the real story of the road to the most famous two-minutes in sports, with the glory, sadness and frustration captured as it happens. The run for the roses has many stories and the documentary does an outstanding job in capturing those special - and, oftentimes, very personal - moments that make the path a long and winding road for those good enough to chase the dream.",1203033600,16,1041,4.591397849462366
