504444,4,6302725577,"THE BRAIN EATERS is another paranoia / conspiracy gem from the 1950s. It has the same basic premise as INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS or I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE, in that the aliens dwell among us, as us! This time, the insidious creatures are from deep in the earth, rather than from outer space. They're tiny parasites, looking for human hosts to control. Once they've latched onto the back of a victim's neck, he / she becomes an automaton of eeevil! Ed Nelson (NIGHT OF THE BLOOD BEAST, THE DEVIL'S PARTNER) plays the main scientist, and Leonard Nimoy (yep, mr. spock!) shows up as an aging, bearded mouthpiece for the invading menace. Classic stuff indeed...",1278460800,4,675,4.728813559322034

Five years ago or so, my wife and I were on our way to dinner. We were thinking about going to the Olive Garden, but decided we wanted to save money, so we went to Friendly's instead. Friendly's is not a restaurant known for expensive food, but after tip, our bill came to just shy of $50. We could have eaten at Olive Garden cheaper. Ever since, Friendly's has been our metric for whether we can afford to eat out. ""Is it cheaper than Friendly's?"". I mention this because I now have a new metric for bad in film. For the last two weeks, I have been asking ""Is it better than The Brain Eaters?"". (According to my spreadsheet, depressingly, I have seen seven movies--yes, seven--about which I can honestly answer that question ""no"".)

This ill-conceived mess involves a bunch of technologically-advanced slugs from the center of the earth who want to conquer humanity with a large glowing ball carried under the trenchcoat of one of their human thralls. Arrayed against them are a handful of square-jawed scientists, their cute-in-that-fifties-kinda-way ladyfriends, and some very confused lawmen.

While this is an obvious thematic father to such better, more recent films as Night of the Creeps and Slither, and has some archival value for that reason, to call this in any way a good movie would be vastly overstating the case. Everyone is overacting, the special effects are laughably crude, the direction leaves a great deal to be desired, the pacing is remarkably bad for a movie that lasts just an hour. There is nothing to recommend this movie at all. And yet somehow, maybe because of its brevity, or maybe because it is so bad without being as painful to watch as something like an Ulli Lommel or Uwe Boll film, it does have a certain silly charm to it that makes me not hate it completely, in the same way as does Amayo Uzo Phillips' The Python or the immortal (at least, as far as I'm concerned) Night of the Lepus. If you really want to put yourself through this, fortify yourself with alcohol first. I'm sure you'll have a much better time. *",1260403200,6,2093,4.651351351351352
504446,3,6302725577,"Supposedly The Brain Eaters was a loose and unauthorized adaptation of the classic science fiction novel The Puppet Masters by Robert A. Heinlein (Starship Troopers, Space Cadet, Friday), but when Heinlein threatened to sue, the producers settled by editing the film to change it sufficiently, resulting in releaseing a one hour movie.

It's about small invading alien parasites from outer space.  They attach themselves to the human spine and take over the human mind.  It has one of the more interesting space ships, though not shown in flight.  An investigator crawls into the spaceship through the hatch and into an interior tunnel that he follows without turning or backing up, and it leads him back out the same hatch.

The Brain Eaters has one of Leonard Nimoy's earliest appearances as an older scientist.  Later Nimoy played Mr. Spock on Star Trek, where the Puppet Masters idea was used again in the episode  ""Operation Annihilate!"" in which Spock is the victim/host of one of the parasites.",1130630400,5,1001,5.03030303030303

7830409,3,6302725577,"The Brain Eaters story has been reinterpreted many times over the years. Most notably Puppet Masters and The Faculty. The story is as eerie and classic as Body Snatchers and one of the best sci-fi premises to break through the 1950s craze for everything extraterrestrial. I am pretty sure that in this film the parasite invasion which is soon found to be from our own prehistoric beginnings is actually a metaphor for communism fears that ravaged the middle of the 20th century.  I don't normally get that deep into a films meaning because for me it takes a lot from the shear enjoyment of the story.

The Brain Eaters is cut and dry in its concept, showing a clear path to the end by exposing the enemy right from the beginning, leaving no real room for suspense or drama. The story moves more like propaganda than fiction thriller. The dialogue is your basic 50s arrogance of American triumphant over any and all threats. However simply from a nostalgic approach to appreciating all that came before The Brain Eaters is one of the best examples of Mans fears of the unknown and the growing threat of the new fields of scientific studies. If we explore to much into our world would we somehow destroy ourselves? This is still the burning question today, and The Brain Eaters is one of the first time we see those questions explored in science fiction writings spawn a b-movie craze that has spanned the decades since.",1431216000,2,1418,4.668

7830411,4,6302725577,"This film stars Edwin Nelson, Jack Hill, and one scene with Leonard Nimoy, playing an elderly Professor Cole. The film is not so bad, but ends before the action is actually concluded. It suffers from bad editing. A cone erupts out of the Earth, but for a long time people assume it came from outer space. But it came from the Earth's core, with insects from the carboniferous period. Parasites. Things are slowly revealed, but it is hard to keep track of who is who in the film. Though only 61 minutes long, it feels longer. It is only partly based on The Puppet Masters, by Heinlein, also it is an imitation of The Body Snatchers, by Jack Finney (also filmed repeatedly over the years). Typical enemy from within film. The cone at first is undefeatable, but then the parasites are electrocuted by a harpoon gun connecting a wire to high-tension wires. Meanwhile, police officers, telegraph operators, telephone exchange operators, etc., etc., are still controlled by the parasites when the movie ends, so it is left unfinished. Still not a bad film, though it got very bad reviews in several reference books on videos. I liked it, glad I saw it. I like to collect monster movies from the 1950s---they generally turn out to be better than expected. Yes, there are worse films than The Brain Eaters.",1398729600,6,1298,4.722466960352423
7830412,1,6302725577,"I ordered this after several emails to the parent company and the company assuring me that it was a Region 1 video. When I received it the video was for Region 2, Europe. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! This is a Sci Fi classic from the 50's.",1391385600,4,230,4.25
7830413,5,6302725577,"Surprisingly well acted, and it moves along at a good pace.  Very enjoyable for an old sci fi, if you like old black and white films",1376956800,3,132,4.076923076923077
7830414,3,6302725577,"The premise of this film is simple. A cone shaped object suddenly appears on Earth. Is it from outer space, as it is first thought? The answer is no. It is simply from our own planet, having come up from deep within the bowels of the earth.

The cone is inhabited by fuzzy little parasites. They hook themselves onto the neck of the nearest person and assume full control of that person. They have been lying in wait under the earth and are now poised to take over the world. Fortunately, there are a dedicated group of people who simply will not let this happen and are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice to ensure that mankind prevails.

This 1958 sci-fi flick is mildly entertaining, peppered with bad acting and a script loaded with turgid dialogue.  The special effects are primitive and crude, at best, in this campy curiosity of a film.  It is loosely based upon Robert A. Heinlein's book, ""The Puppet Masters"". In fact, Heinlein sued for plagiarism and won an out of court settlement, but refused to have a screen credit, as the film did not meet his standards.

Still, those who love sci-fi may derive some enjoyment from this film.  Moreover, Star Trek fans will, no doubt,  be intrigued by Leonard Nimoy's brief performance at the film's end, whereby, heavily bearded and looking like a prophet out of the Old Testament,  he tries to persuade others that a takeover by these parasites is a good thing.",1351123200,3,1417,4.64

Ok.  My bad.  I contacted the seller, and she was sure that the tape had been in the package, that I did a little further explanation.  I have the tape.  The guilty party will not be named because he is underage.",1325203200,,388,4.093333333333334
7830416,5,6302725577,"Roger Corman did more with less than anyone in 1950's. This off center, tilted little gem is scary even if the detractors refuse to admit it. These are people who would have looked through the lens instead of the view finder in 1958, but I guess it's comfortable to attack something from a distance. It can be hard to judge from the uneven shots but this looks like a 9 out of 10 and I think most people will appreciate the transfer. It comes with some cute AIP postcards but on first run, I wasn't able to get sound from the
extras and will have to try again.",1323043200,3,560,4.194444444444445
