Don't buy it singly as it is already on the 50 Combat Classics set, and of course Amazon doesn't list the titles of the movies in sets such as this - so I managed to double-up on my purchase.  Not happy Jan.",1393718400,,269,4.235294117647059

BUT, it is still worth seeing just for the historical aspect - 1943 - in the thick of the war which was still far from certain who'd win.",1184112000,2,292,4.528301886792453
