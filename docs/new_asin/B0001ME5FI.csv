8014624,5,B0001ME5FI,"This is one of my favorite flicks in this genre.  Lots of good looking hotties who aren't ashamed of showing off their ""assets.""  It's just a fun romp.  If you watch it, I KNOW you will remember the cart wash.  This ISN'T Oscar material.  But it's FUN and I liked the story.  This is one of those flicks I can watch many times and still get a good laugh, especially after a hard day at the office.",1423180800,,397,4.090909090909091
8014625,1,B0001ME5FI,To be honest I would not suggest this video for anyone - the acting was bad - simply not worth the money.,1381622400,,105,3.8181818181818183
8014626,4,B0001ME5FI,"Kind of like Caddy Shack meets Animal House, but on a lower budget. Very pretty girls. Fun to watch if not taken too seriously.",1323129600,3,127,4.333333333333333
8014627,1,B0001ME5FI,"I bought this movie based on the other reviews but apparently they have different tastes than I do. I sat bored to death through the show and my brother got up and left. It's because the actors were not natural, they appeared to be trying really hard to act stupid and sounded like they were reading cue cards. The T & A was mundane too, something like teens might want to see. The only way a person could enjoy this movie is to be so drunk they don't know what's going on, since I don't drink I didn't enjoy it. I would have given it about minus 10 stars but there was no setting to choose that. Save your money and buy something funny made by the National Lampoon guys or some other tried and tested studio.",1177113600,4,709,4.182481751824818
8014628,3,B0001ME5FI,"This is a movie you watch for the T&A.  Why did they bother with a story line?  The antics of the Bill & Ted like golfers are the best parts, especially the tall skinny one.  His energy and absurd behaviour make you wish the movie just followed them around until it was time to see Amy Baxter's(...), that's about every 10 minutes.  Which is great!
I would give Amy and the two golfing boneheads four and half stars.  The rest of it is good for getting up and going to the fridge.",1103673600,3,480,4.173913043478261
