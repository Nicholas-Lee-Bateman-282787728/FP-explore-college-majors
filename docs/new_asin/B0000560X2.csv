1395431,1,B0000560X2,"Cherry falls is another in a long list of teen horror movies which is trying to latch onto the success of Scream. This film is horror at it's worst, it has really bad diologe and the killing scenes are very tame. The story revolves around the town of Cherry falls were a serial killer is on the lose and is killing students at the local high school, and all the victims have one thing in common their all virgins. Jody Marken(Brittany Murphy)is the main character in the film and you guessed it is a virgin, she is the daughter of the towns sherrif Brent Marken(Michael Biehn)and decides not to wait around till the killer strikes again but instead to launch her own investigation to figure out the killer's identity and discovers a few twist on the way.",982627200,,754,4.510948905109489
1395432,4,B0000560X2,"Terror Tract...This is a quirky little horror-comedy that resignates somewhere just behind my heart...But that might be because I spent time on the set picking up cigarrette butts. And ever since those days, I have been inexplecibly running into Carmine Geovanazzio on a semi-regular basis, yet he has no idea who I am. And that's okay. ...
Carmine stars as one married girl's lover. They kill the husband and dump him into a lake directly across from the scene of all those ""Crocodile"" killings in what was originally titled TOBE HOOPER'S FLAT DOG. Both movies where shooting in the same place at the same time. I suggest a triple feature of CROCODILE, CHERRY FALLS, & Terror Tract...Just make sure you stretch the viewing over the course of about three years, so as to digest it all.
The main bulk of Terror Tract deals with John Ritter acting as a tour guide in a house tract. Each home comes with it's own horror story, the best dealing with a rabid monkey. This is a fast paced little film that means well. It's not exactly the type of thing I would pick up when breezing through the video store, but hey...It's got my name in the credits!!
Cherry Falls, on the other hand, is a movie I'd been waiting to see for awhile. Over the course of the last six months, I'd heard nothing but good things about this film from such reliable sources as Fangoria & gorepeergroup.com. I was surprised to see it headed straight for video, since it does weight in as one of the more enjoyable, most original slasher flicks that has come out in the wake of Scream. It's about a serial killer who has an appitite for gutting young Virgins. If you got a shark in the water...You don't go swimming. If your a young virgin and you don't want to die? I see a simple solution...See this MOVIE!!",982454400,13,1776,4.5186335403726705
1395433,5,B0000560X2,"Let me start off by saying that this movie compares to Body Bags, but is much more amusing. Terror Trace (odd title) starts off with a disgruntled realstate agent trying to sell houses in a seemingly nice neightbor-hood. However, everyhouse has a tale (3 stops to be exact). Each house holds disturbing stories. My favorite is the first. Next follows and tale of a killer monkey, named bobo..(sounds silly but very errie), and the third is about a masked killer. I loved all three stories but the first of the cheating couple was suspenseful. The acting is good and there is great amounts of gore. I highly recomend this movie..the ending is awesome..makes you think twice about life in the ""nice neightbor-hoods"".",981158400,,714,4.860655737704918

Sorry.  I just didn't think the movie was great enough to warrant that much background research.

The three tales all (kinda) center around a different house that Ritter (as a real estate agent) is showing to a newly married young couple.  Each house corresponds to a different tale of terror, one of them involving a jilted husband, another a jilted monkey, and the third an inexplicably psychic teen who has a direct line to a serial killer.  The connecting moments with Ritter's character wrap up with an equal amount of horror, a grotesque little tip of the cap that actually surpasses any of the three, unimpressive segments that came before it.

Not bad, and not so good.  You'd spend just as much time and be even more entertained if you just watched an episode of each of the TV shows listed above.  Although, you may not be quite as horrified.  Unless you can't stand Frankie Muniz.",1234742400,,1908,6.645161290322581

1395457,4,B0000560X2,"This DVD contains 2 more obscure Horror Films that never made it to the theatre.

Cherry Falls- starring Brittany Murphy & Jay Mohr

Plot- The town of Cherry Falls is shocked when a killer starts offing the teenage population, which happen to all be Virgins. When the students learn about the killers modus operandi, they throw a ''Pop Your Cherry Ball'' where the students can surrender their virginity. This movie is rare in the fact its usually the ones who are having the sex who are offed first, this time it's the virgins. This film was also recommended in Fangoria's '100 Horror Films youve never seen'. Overall, its a decent horror film with a different twist to it.

Terror Tract- starring John Ritter
Now this one was suprisiningly unique. This is a Creepshow like film, except it dosent have the cartoons with the stories.

Plot- A real estate agent is showing a couple around town who are looking to buy a home. Every home they go to seems to have some terrible murder that happened in it. John starts telling the creepy stories when he gets in the house and is showing them around.

Story One 'First House'- About a couple having an affair and some crazy husband or lover who finds them together. They put him in the lake but he ends up coming back. And a twist at the end. Pretty good story but not as scary as the other 2.

Story Two 'Second House'- Wow, this story was good and creepy, I sure wouldnt buy the house after hearing this one. Its about an evil monkey a little girl finds in her tree outside. Her dad lets her keep it in the house for a little bit but still has a feeling theres something wrong with the monkey when he starts biting him and throwing stuff at the dog. He finally gets fed up and wants the monkey out but the monkey won't leave and he starts trying all kinds of tricks to get him out, but the monkey keeps returning and the ending is brutal! This story makes me feel different about monkies now. Excellent story.

Story Three 'Third House'-  This story is about a teenager whos having premonitions of a murderer on the loose and seeing pyschic visions of the killings. Hes worried the killer will strike again and is getting feelings so he goes to some therapist lady to tell her. This story would have been great as a whole film. The 'killer' in this film is so scary. Hes called ''granny'' and wears a granny mask that is one of the most frightening masks ive ever seen a killer wear. Whenever he kills he says ' Dont worry, its only Granny!!' then he kills them with an ax or a knife.  This one was great.

Then the ending where Ritter has to make the sale of a home before the days up but the couple is so freaked out they don't want to buy a home now. The ending was a twist and it was funny at the same time.

4 stars for Terror Tract, Highly Recommended.",1152403200,6,2804,4.3320610687022905
1395458,5,B0000560X2,"My God, this movie had it all!

It had kick ass stories, kick ass characters, and hell, even a kick ass beginning! How many movies do you know had an exciting beginning? Well, this movie starts off with an incredibly cool scene involving a few animals eating each other viciously. You may think that is nothing special, but the gruesome way it is done will give you that special tingly feeling. You know, that feeling that says you're about to see something special. I will tell about the stories in the movie, but I won't mention the names.

The first story in this movie entitled ""Nightmare"" involves a woman having an affair behind her husband's back. The husband knew about it and plotted their deaths. Well, everything failed and he ended up dying. Everything went downhill from there. The story is actually pretty good and the acting is not bad. It is VERY well presented and much much better than other stories of the same variant. We all know what kind of ghost story this is, don't we? It's the classic adultery situation where people die, then come back for revenge. However, the way the story is told here is INCREDIBLE! I love the great suspense! And I gotta tell you guys, this story has a unique twist! It's not innovative when you compare it to other movies, but I can tell you that you probably never saw the version of this story like this!

The second story (Bobo) is about a father and his little girl. Naturally, he's wrapped around his daughter's finger and she daddy's little girl. One day, the little girl suddenly found a monkey in a red suit. She liked it and wanted to keep it. Being daddy's little girl, she gets what she wants. However, the father soon finds that he doesn't like the situation. Not only is his daughter suddenly liking him less and less, but there is something about the monkey that upsets him. The monkey seems to have a violent tendency and it also seems to have an adversion to him. This all swirls down to, obviously, obsession, and it was truly a beautiful sight. The ending is also unique, like the last story, but unfortunately, the last story's own twist dulled the twist in this story due to both of them being too similar. However, it is not similar in the way you might be thinking. Just watch and enjoy.

The third story (Come To Granny) is, in my opinion, the best of all. They truly did save the best for last! Unlike the other stories, this one is not in the same veins. It is VERY dark, but not just in the nature of all the gore, but because of also the personality changes you see within the main character. His ""psychic powers"" seemed to be consuming him at a rate he couldn't heal back. As the story progresses, you just can't help, but become enthralled with him. What is upsetting him so much? Well, he had been having visions lately. Visions of a killer named ""The Granny Killer"" (due to his granny mask) killing all of his victims. Because of those visions, he has been losing everything. Now he comes to a psychiatrist to tell his story and as time go on, you can't help but get the feeling that the story is heading in a direction that you just want to know. This is truly the best out of all three not only because of its uniqueness, but also because the kid is a great actor. The ending is excellent, but unfortunately, you can't help but guess what will happen. I'm very willing to bet that you'll guess the wrong ending too, but I have been surprised before, so who knows? Maybe you'll find that you're surprised. Whichever way, you will like the ending!

After all the stories are told, we are taken back to the realtor who's been telling the stories. It turns out there is an extra story to tell, but unfortunately, this is a pretty average one. You'll probably guess what will happen correctly. Still, it's an extra story, right? Now the realtor is a great actor, but the people looking to buy a house could probably be a little better. Otherwise, though, everything just screams ""classic campfire horror story"" at you. Everything goes crazy and I admit that it's somewhat corny, but you can't help but smile.

Looking back on the movie, I can see why some people might not like this movie. However, I am a former ex-horror fan. I have seen so many horror movies that I'm pretty much de-sensitized to all the gore. The reason I'm an ex-horror fan? Because horror movies nowadays suck. The last horror movie I saw was Darkness Falls and that movie was so bad that I just stopped watching horror movies. I have had enough and the only reason I came upon this movie was because of a bargain. I must say that I'm glad I did get it because it is GREAT! It has a good plot, plausible characters, and SPECTACULAR music! At least rent this movie and enjoy it yourself sometime at night!",1102291200,4,4756,4.4672036823935555
1395459,2,B0000560X2,"It's dawson creek meeting scary movie. I was wondering if this movie was a horror or a comedy. The acting is so bad, the killer is laughable in his/her disguisement. The dialogue is ridiculous. My opinion is : it's not derisive enough to be a great comedy and not serious enough to make you scared ! So what is it ? It's like the director wanted to make a comedy but his sense of humour wasn't good enough. Also it's so predictible. I knew who was the killer as soon as all the characters have been introduced (there is not enough possibilities indeed).SKIP THIS ONE !",1074816000,2,568,4.367924528301887
1395460,3,B0000560X2,"I managed to catch ""Cherry Falls"" on USA when it aired on Halloween 2001.  I thought it was great.  A horror film that throws the rules completely out the window.  We need more scary movies like this.  Here's a quick synopsis:  A killer is stalking and killing the teenagers of Cherry Falls, Virginia.  The common link between them all?  They were all virgins.  The students of CFHS decide the only way to live to stay off the hit list is to lose their innocence.  Cool notion, huh?  The performances were great.  Brittany Murphy was awesome in this completely underrated role.  Michael Biehn (""The Terminator,"" TV's ""Adeventure, Inc.""), as the town sheriff, gave a convincing performance of a good guy trying to right a wronged past.  Candy Clark (""American Graffiti"") does a good turn as Brittany Murphy's mom.  For those of you who like trivia, look for Jesse Bradford (""Swimfan"") and Clementine Ford (Cybill Shepherd's daughter, ""Bring It On"").  They have small parts.  This DVD is not uncut as I had hoped, but it is worth the buy for the double feature.  Check it out.  You just might see something you like.",1053388800,22,1114,4.7434554973821985
1395461,3,B0000560X2,"I bought this film as an impulse buy, as the shop I was buying it from had one of those two for one buys. The DVD I bought doesn't have Terror Tract on it, so I can't comment on that. I dunno why I keep watching ""teen flicks"", although so far, I enjoyed most of them. This wasn't one of my faves though. Too predictable, and I had a list of who I thought was the killer - and the person who was the killer was on the list. Normally I'm hopeless at guessing who the killers are. I wasn't keen on this film, mainly cos it was too much like Scream, I Know What You Did, etc. There wasn't enough suspense, or anything making me jump out my skin. And the director's different angle on the teen flick films - the victims are all virgins. Big wow! I'm safe :) The best bit was the last 15 minutes, and even that shocked me - an axe through the head, ouch!
Brittany Murphy was very good in this film, played the part brilliantly, and she's not your average, blonde, big tits American high school lead in these films. Spookily, she reminds me of a younger Angelina Jolie! She's got the looks off to a T.
Look for out the dad, played by Michael Biehn, who starred as the ""good guy"" in the first Terminator. Looks so different, but the eyes are the same.
Watching the 10 minutes of extras, which weren't even that good, was a bit boring and the directors and everyone else, kept describing the film as ""humorous"". Uh, I'm sorry, but where? Maybe I'm just too thick to notice the humour. It's a horror movie, I'm not exactly looking for humour in it :)
I wouldn't say I would watch this film again. Maybe again sometime. But if you want a scary teen flick, stick to the Scream triology.",1045267200,7,1674,4.201863354037267

Its along the lines of the recent teen horror stuff and is EASILY better than Valentine and maybe a tad better than I Know What You Did, however it falls shy of Scream (every movie pretty much does though).

1395478,5,B0000560X2,"Wow, I just got done watching this ""Frightmare Double Feature"" and I was very pleased..., I went against my better judgment and bought this DVD after reading some semi-positive reviews of both movies.  I was very pleasantly surprised!
I watched Terror Tract first, because I was sure it would be the more superfluous of the two movies (it's got John Ritter in it for God's sake).  But it actually turned out to be an anthology film (like Creepshow and Tales from the Crypt) with three very entertaining short stories interwoven by a disturbing wraparound sequence featuring Ritter trying to sell houses in a community that is not all that it appears to be.  Each story, including the wraparound-Ritter sequences, has a strong (sometimes familiar) story with a surprising, satisfying ending.  It's a fun movie...not really a fun as in ""comedy"", but it's a good, fun, vengeful-dead-husband-evil-monkey-psycho-granny-killer horror.
Cherry Falls was also a real treat.  It's a straight horror movie that borrows from about every recent Scream-esque film out there, and then adds some surprising twists to keep it fresh.  There's no annoying fake ""jump"" scares (well, maybe one), the killer's motives actually make sense, and the whole movie has an air of paranoia about it.  It really keeps you guessing as the script is very solid and the acting is all-around excellent.
Both movies are in anamorphic widescreen (with a surprisingly strong Dolby 2.0 audio track...the thunderstorm in the Terror Tract Evil-Monkey story sounds awesome) and are on the same side of the disc.

Now the only way to avoid becoming a victim of the mysterious killer is for the teenagers in town to have sex! This film is a fun send-up of the teen horror genre and is full of suspense, scares, violence, and humor. The acting is pretty decent and the story is original.
TERROR TRACT is a collection of three short stories about houses that have dark secrets and histories locked inside. The stories are told to a newlywed couple by a real estate agent who would just kill to make a deal on one of the houses. This film is both funny and scary at the same time. John Ritter does a good job as the slightly sinister real estate agent who has to sell a house in order to meet a certain 'deadline' that will have 'consequences' if he doesn't sell a house.

1395534,3,B0000560X2,"...I had read a positive review about Cherry Falls in Entertainment Weekly, but found it to be run-of-the-mill as far as horror and below par as far as humor (although STILL funnier than ""Scary Movie"").  I think this was released in theaters (it has an MPAA rating), but it feels like a cable TV movie.  It's not BAD, but you've been down this road before.  Uneven style (hard to tell what is supposed to be funny and what is supposed to be scary).  Two stars for this title.
Terror Tract, on the other hand, makes up for the weaknesses in Cherry Falls.  Although John Ritter is generally a turn-off to me in movies, his segues are brief and this film will suck you in and keep you (and I gotta admit, John Ritter as a cheesy real estate agent is perfect casting!).  More laugh-out-loud humor in this than Cherry Falls (which isn't much), but the stories are fairly interesting.  Reminded me of Creepshow from time to time.  The only problem I had was that I was looking for some moral to the three stories presented, in a sort of ""Twilight Zone"" kind of way (i.e., What was the point of the evil monkey?  Where was it from?  Why was it evil?).  4 stars for this title....
...which averages out to 3 stars for the DVD.",988070400,,1218,4.368888888888889
1395535,1,B0000560X2,"This was a horrible movie overall, and I think the only thing that made it even halfway watchable was John Ritter, who was funny, in a supposed scary movie.  The 3 stories in the film consist of a cheating wife who gets nixed by her husband, a killer crazy monkey, and a kid who sees thru a killer's victim's eyes, if that makes sense.  Anyhow, the third story was the only entertaining one, the first one had so many plot holes, I laughed the entire time...the second one was just moronic, I mean, come on, killer monkey?!  The third story was half decent, with some halfway decent acting.  Jasmine, played by Shonda Farr, made the movie complete, just because she's so beautiful and you can't help but keep your eyes glued on her, and all of that really helps pull you into the last story, where she becomes one of the victims.  This is one I would stay away from altogether, because the good elements hardly outweigh the bad, and the stories are so ridiculously written, you'll laugh more than you scream.",985996800,2,1008,4.516483516483516
1395536,5,B0000560X2,"I just wanted to say that firstly i REALLY enjoyed Cherry Falls, as this is the only exception to what most people would consider ""Crap BECAUSE it's a tv-movie"".  It is actually quite enjoyable.
Just a quick note though, i HATE the fact that EVERYONE compares horror movies to ""Scream"".  DUH!  Not all horror films are MEANT to be like scream.  Personally, i have grown to HATE scream due to the fact that people discredit ""legitimate"" slasher movies like I know what you did last summer, urban legend and now Cherry Falls, just because they've ""seen"" Scream and suddenly think that that's the holy grail of horror films.  GET A LIFE!
It makes me ill that people think just because they've seen scream they're suddenly a horror expert!  I see people hate Halloween H20 just because michael myers keeps coming back from the dead.  DUH!  he's michael myers.  Why don't you check out all the other sequels where he keeps coming back from the dead.  Although unrealistic, it IS warrented, and all you horror fan wannabe's out there that think otherwise can go jump for all i care.
As you can see, i am rather passionate on this issue.  If you wanna see some REAL horror movies, check out Black Christmas, The House On Sorority Row, Re-Animator>, The Hills Have Eyes, The Exorcist,  Hellraiser, Halloween, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Evil Dead, Night Of The Living Dead (and the rest of the Dead trilogy).  <b>ONLY THEN</b> can you even think about decently posting thoughts on horror flicks, rather than just stating ""Not as good as Scream"".

For fans of this movie, this is the ONLY Region 1 DVD available of Cherry Falls.
As far as features go, there aren't any! You simply select which film you want to watch.
I recommend Cherry Falls to fans of slasher films...but it is of note that this is NOT a gory slasher film.
This one plays more like a teen murder mystery than a standard slasher film!
It has humor and a likable cast and I highly recommend it!",1474588800,,517,4.128712871287129
7931513,5,B0000560X2,"In the small, fictional town of Cherry Falls, Virginia someone is going around killing off high school teens. The twist? They're only killing off teens who are virgins. This forgotten gem of a teen slasher opens with your ordinary teen slasher film scene with a couple out in the woods, having a romantic time with each other. Suddenly a raven-haired woman shows up and kills them both. An additional calling card of this killer is that they carve the word ""virgin"" into their victims as well.

As the body count rises, word quickly spreads around the town and around the school about the murders. One person in particular who is stricken with fear and anxiety about the events is Jody Marken, who's dealing with relationship issues and a virgin herself--putting herself on the hit-list. Her father, sheriff Brent Marken is at the head of the investigation as angry and fearful parents breathe down his neck for answers. In the heat of it all, it ends up being revealed that a dark secret from the town's past is the reason for all this happening. What is this mysterious secret that seemingly has the conscious of Cherry Falls in its very grasp? Why is this person targeting virgin teens? There's only one naughty way for these teens to ensure they're not the next victim and they'll have to take it to ensure their survival",1471996800,,1325,4.711206896551724

Reason why I'm giving it such a high rating is because the movie itself is done very well, though it had to be re-cut 5 times to get a R-rating, the original version was very brutal and bloody but we'll never get to see that thanks to MPAA  >:( this movie has always been my favorite horror film/teen slasher! I've seen the tv version, this (r-rated version) and hoping to see the directors cut on Blu-ray. I remember looking for this film on dvd like crazy now I finally own it :) If you love Brittany Murphy and the teen slasher flicks than this is definitely for you. Also this movie has a couple of funny scenes, but don't worry it doesn't take away from the horror rather it actually adds some character to the movie! Oh and Terror Tract was actually pretty good, its 3 different horror stories so it was interesting, super kool to watch with your friends.

7931516,4,B0000560X2,"Both of these films were surprisingly good, though on a low budget.
Cheery Falls takes the teen slasher story and turns it upside down, this time the killer is targeting virgins, but certainly has a back story and sinister hidden agenda. Britney Murphy had so much potential, it's very sad she never the real chance to truly show it.
Terror Tract was pretty good too, John Ritter plays a rental salesman on a dead line, with sinister consequences if they aren't met. He tells this couple a back story behind every house its sinister and tragic history, but the ending tops everything, so be prepared!",1390262400,,600,4.723809523809524
7931517,5,B0000560X2,"Hey it's The Scream Queen here, me and my friends were talking about Scary Movies (we have been a little extra cause of Halloween, and this one came up. We just finished watching it (I haven't seen it since it was on TV last summer; and I have to say.....it's not bad. Dark yes; but then I write a lot of Dark stories too...vampires to Dark Willow and such. But there's one thing I have to say, this isn't Really That much like Scream as much as its like Scream 3.....and another movie that I know has more of a cult following then it used too......one of my favorite flicks by the name.....of Sleepaway Camp. Sleepaway Camp; strange as it is....(and great as it is goes with the Original girl in this movie.....The one by the name of Laura Lee Sherman ( Now I won't get 2 graphic with her backstory cause I know that a lot of people who read my reviews would've seen this anyway.) Okay so for our comparison Angela is the quiet loner girl from Sleepaway Camp (and the funny thing is what's ticking most of the campers off in the movie, was the fact that she was giving them the silent treatment (Now me and my friends Actually find that funny; because if they don't like her anyway.....why would they care if Angela WASN'T talking to them?) Now this movie actually has a pretty similar plotline (and now that I've seen Sleepaway Camp again......it makes a lot of sense....although the ending is still...strange. Okay you ready? Steady? Let's go....Angela has this weird aunt.....Her face is painted up like Baby Jane's...although they don't explain why. Now Angela is the 1st born.....son in the family.....I know it's weird. But this lady wanted a girl so she dressed her up as one (and because it's a movie she ended up being a girl.....with......Well most people know how the rest of that goes...and the ending cuts off, but I still REALLY like it......and although I never saw it; I know Angela comes back in the 3rd movie. Now with Cherry Falls you have Brittany Murphy (in my FAVORITE role she played) as The Scream Queen of the flick. And she is One tough chick. Now I do have one large qualms with the flick....I like that Jay Mohr is the killer (Not Laura Lee Sherman come back 25 years later in the flick like you think) as Brittanys half brother...but the back story DIDN'T have to be THAT graphic; I mean look at Scream 3......we know the killer was Sydney's half brother....but we didn't hear the whole backstory in the most Graphic Detail they COULD do, and I know this was a U.S.A. network slasher flick, but it's also a made for TV movie (you know before it went to DVD, and there's a point you know? I did like how after the crazed son was like Norman Bates, then killed off....Brittany still got to be with her guy Kenny ( cause these 2 are a good couple thru out the movie.) And everyone was able to put the past behind them.....And I think That's why for a few seconds Brittany sees the Real Laura Lee Sherman across the street watching her....and there's no sequal.....cause that ends the movies point. Now in Scream 3 Sydney's half brother is crazy....and she had to kill him stabbing him Right in the heart with his LETHAL hunting knife (and I always liked this.....it also goes with the blood promise Ginger and Bridgette made in Ginger Snaps) Because Sydney's eyes welled with tears.....she holds his bleeding hand tight (interlocking her fingers with his as she holds his hand until he died. And I liked that, because it means if the situation would've been different...then they could've actually had a nice family and a nice life together.",1382054400,,3568,4.55054432348367
7931518,3,B0000560X2,"This DVD was okay.  We bought it for the Terror Tract with Jack Ritter.  We had seen part of the movie on TV.  This one was not exactly like the one we had seen.  Like I say, it was okay.",1357603200,,187,3.6
7931519,3,B0000560X2,"""Terror Tract"" is a horror anthology film which begins with a seemingly friendly but desperate real estate salesman named Bob Carter (played by John Ritter) attempting to persuade a young couple(portrayed by Allison Smith and David DeLuise) to buy one of the three houses he shows them. Carter becomes more and more nervous as he receives threatening calls from his mysterious, darkly voiced boss. As he tours the houses with the couple, he tells what happened to the previous owners; each one died horrifically.

The first of the three stories told in hindsight revolves around an unfaithful wife (Rachel York) who conspires to kill her husband but she constantly has nightmares involving his undead body returning. The plot and whole is-it-a-nightmare-or-not shtick is tiresome and predictable. This portion of the film is the most forgettable part.

The film improves with the next story, which features an honest father (Bryan Cranston) who appeases his spoiled daughter by allowing her to keep a monkey that appears in the backyard as a pet. Things turn ugly as the monkey appears to have a grudge against the father and violent tendencies. The house and the neighborhood descend into chaos in this bloody tale of madness. This story is more Twilight Zone than horror but it is fairly well done.

The final story is the best. It centers around a troubled teenager who claims he has premonitions in his sleep of the upcoming murders of a serial killer known as ""Granny."" He tells his skeptical therapist (Brenda Strong) and attempts to stop this murderer but is he psychic or the insane killer himself? This is a really intriguing, even thrilling slasher story with a few turns and reversal of fortunes. The serial killer is tall, wears a creepy old lady mask and refers to himself as ""Granny"" in a raspy voice. This segment might be nightmare fuel for some but it was, at the very least, a well done slasher story. In fact, this segment probably would have made a good slasher film by itself.

The film concludes with the resolution of the pushy Mr. Carter; it ends both comically and violently. Ritter provides a good comedic relief. This is an entertaining movie, much like three and a half&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tales-from-the-Crypt/dp/B001CT05SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tales from the Crypt</a>&nbsp;episodes melted into one another.

7931521,3,B0000560X2,"Cherry Falls had a unique storyline and is very funny. However, I wouldn't call it horror because all the gore is edited out of the film. Yes, the swearing is intact but the gore is cut out. I read in Fangoria's 101 Best Horror Movies You've Never Seen that the film was originally NC-17 and to be released in theaters yet something happened and it got sold to USA Network where it was butchered. Since one of the credits on the dvd is USA Network, I believe that this is the copy you see on tv with the language intact. It was a funny movie no doubt but i'd like to see the full, gore intact version. However, I don't see many people wanting it.

Terror Tract is a good movie. It has John Ritter as a house salesman who tells poetintal home owners about the horrors that happened there. It was a very good movie but I cant tell if it's edited because I was a made for tv film.

Overall, Cherry Falls is a funny movie with a unique story to tell. Even though it's edited, it may be the only way to see it. I know they have region 2 dvds of Cherry Falls but I don't know if those are edited for content. Terror Tract was a very good movie though.",1279756800,,1145,4.084444444444444
