8681228,1,B00O18L8WG,"very disappointed; this slide show had no narration or captions to explain what area was being shown, the slides were sometimes blurry or appeared to be like a painting rather than a photo?-it's hard to describe but the coloration looked fake. Many slides did not fill the entire screen.  The music choices were awful and annoying rather than adding to the landscapes shown. I didn't finish the thing and will probably throw it away.  This was one of several dvd's purchased after a brief visit to the southwest this past August.  My own photos of the Grand Canyon were superior to this. I would recommend ""Over Arizona"", Grand Canyon Serenade, and Arizona's Monuments as alternatives to this product.",1448064000,,701,4.923728813559322
