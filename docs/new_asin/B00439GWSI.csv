8414474,4,B00439GWSI,"Overall I am very happy with the DVD. The Sifu seems to know his stuff pretty well. I had to move away from my old wing chin school right after starting Chi Sao and this DVD has given me some training drills to perform with my partners.  The instruction is clear and techniques are shown from multiple angles. Could use a little more discussion on the footwork, but with pause and rewind it can still be determined.",1385251200,,415,4.3896103896103895
