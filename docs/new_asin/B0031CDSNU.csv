8386848,3,B0031CDSNU,A real basic sampler of videos already on their other dvd we one. Like The God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen on Christmas Live dvd. And videos fron their ice skating dvd christmas angel. And the videos that are on the other dvd are better quality clearer and better sound then this video. Only buy this if it's real cheap and you're a die hard Mannheim fan and won't to collect all of their stuff. There is no need to buy or see this of you already own their main releases.,1483142400,,467,4.2
