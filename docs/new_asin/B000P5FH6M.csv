8189042,5,B000P5FH6M,"I like the first 2 seasons of this show, as well as other seasons, however, these two seasons didn't make the kids look bratty like the later seasons but overall, this is a great show!",1400112000,,184,4.285714285714286
8189043,2,B000P5FH6M,"I actually totally hated this show and was disgusted that these kids have no reprocess ions for just awful behavior.
However, I bought the DVD as a gift and warning to a good friend who was overindulging her children.  I thought this horrible show would let her see herself, by looking at these other parents and having a ""ah ha"" moment.  It worked!
I really feel this show opened my friends eyes before she became ""one of them"".

Frankly, how the show had good ratings is beyond me.  All this DVD shows are a bunch of spoiled 12/13 year olds you just want to slap silly.  They are overindulged, as their unacceptable behavior (selfish, bitchy, inconsiderate...) gets rewarded by some insignificant and  ridiculously overpriced Sweet Sixteen parties

This is parenting at its worst.  Not one parent is seen challenging their child, or even asking for any respect or even civility at all.

The only reason I gave it two stars, is I personally found a healthy use for the tape (sadly).

I guess if you like to watch train wrecks, in a sick way you might enjoy this, as sort of  a black comedy.",1394755200,,1091,4.572164948453608

8189046,4,B000P5FH6M,"I can't believe the negative reviews about 'those kids'. It's their parents who are clueless. Except more power to the mom who shuts down her daughter's credit card for leaving town, and the parents who cancel a party to make a point about grades. Most of these parties are just parents enabling their kids at a higher level, (or re-living their own childhood) it's a great show to sit down with your own kids to watch and gently point out how most of these families deep down are very unhappy, how money can't buy happiness, and can't buy 'real' friends either. Be prepared to see a b-day present of an expensive car in pretty much every episode, but if you've instilled good values in your kids, it's just a fantasy-type of reality show.",1195171200,3,739,4.56390977443609
8189047,3,B000P5FH6M,"I got this DVD set for the same reason I pick up the trashy tabloids in the supermarket: to see how the other half lives- the half with  money :)
The parties are so outrageous, it's unbelievable.

However, It is really annoying watching these ungrateful brats spending all thier parents money, and the parents so stupidly going along with it.

It is not only the issue of money wasted either.
It is the total VICIOUSness of some of the girls that was such a turn off.

One in particular was a little orphan girl from Erie Pennsylvania, who was brought out of the ghetto only a year earlier by a rich couple with a big heart..
Well, this little girl was so rotten, you would of thought she was BORN with a silver spoon in her mouth. She totally treated her best friend like crap for no reason other than jealousy, because the girl tried on a dress, and talked to some boys, and got a little attention herself.

Well, the claws came out, and she dissed the friend SO bad at her party, and had the poor girl apologizing to HER...it made me sick!
I can stand to see them spend thier parents money, but a lot of these girls are just plain evil and hurtful little girls who need to be brought to a screeching halt, and will be someday.
I give it 3 stars for the entertainment value. These little tramps just aren't likable at all!",1186272000,4,1324,4.301204819277109
8189048,1,B000P5FH6M,"Personally, I don't understand why this show is so appealing. Who wants to see some dumb, bitchy, overindulged kid get everthing they for an insignificant birthday with no reprocussions. They could at least show a party gone bad or a parent snapping back at the kids. I guess that this is one of MTV's latest attempts to turn America's youth into stupid spoiled whores. If you find bitchy and often times slutty children entertaining or if you are an aspiring stupid spoiled whore, waste your money on this dvd.",1183593600,11,511,4.752808988764045
