3165464,1,B00005LC9J,"Seriously????? this is the worst movie I've seen in a while. The Int shots were too dark needed some more light. The EXT handheld and dolly shots were too fast and made me dizzy to watch. The spatial transitions of the scene were ridiculous they were wearing same clothing and at one point the old dude had a beard then later the lighting was super bright but I couldn't tell that anything had changed over time, except his beard, later he lost his hair but same clothes, same walk, same vocal pattern. His so called Gf was sleeping with the so called son of a Mandinga who died. This movie is not even about Mandinga's at all. It's not even about slavery. Its basically soft porn

So in my opinion the Adr is terrible. these are not africans they are like some mixed Italian/Ethiopian people who do not look like Africans at all. they are totally different culture which makes this movie a fake. YOu can tell that whoever produced it doesn't know anything. The ADR was off track and unauthentic. YOu could tell they were not in Louisiana probably in Malta,Italy or someplace in Spain, but not in swamp country Lousiana

everyone and their dog knows that Louisiana still has plantations. LOL on this movie not one time do we even see a royalty free ext shot of a plantation. Also major, major, super major important part of story was when the mandinga woman has the master's child.  OK guess what??? we never even see the baby. spatial transition to like 30 years later and he doesn't even look black and he is all talking badly about slaves. was that comedy?

i think this is like a student film that went wrong. NO... students would have known how to do this film. It's lik really terrible do not waste 1.99 like I did... but if you need to laugh or show this to film students who are in their 20's then its ok how not to shoot a film, lighting issues, etc.

I hate this movie and I think that it could have been a ok story but the director basically failed as a director and as a story teller. The DP failed and camera operator??? what I could have shot a better movie on my Iphone. LOl

total WASTE of money and time.",1331337600,15,2121,4.356962025316456

The Plantation owner involved with a women who really wants to be with his son. When the son comes home and meets the Pastor's daughter, he likes her. The end up getting married and she gets pregnant. When the baby is born he has very dark skin, the woman doesn't understand how this could happen.

3165476,3,B00005LC9J,"Yes, I know, why would I give this insignificant, offensive, and poorly made film---3 stars---I'll explain! In ""Mandinga"" (from 1976), we have another Italian-made Cult/Sexploitation entry from the very nasty 70's (an era of the Cinema that will probably never be repeated in offering this kind of fare). Capitalizing on its equally questionable and tasteless American counterpart---""Mandingo"" from a year earlier. ""Mandinga"" is even more over-the-top in reveling in the sociopathic torture and abuse of human-innocents (poor and helpless black slaves)!

When 'Rhonda' (Paola D'Egidio) makes the 'Hunter' plantation her home---she will unleash her sadistic lust of torture and pain on everyone that is ensnared in her vicious trap (master and slave alike). Ultimately, she will seduce the owner's son---but he too will grow tired of her depravities before---but no sooner will she get her ""just deserts!""

That pretty much sums it up! Now, here's the deal. Like so many of these perverse entries: the violence, acting, and dialogue (the dubbed voices are hilarious) was too comical/fake to really be taken seriously. Therefore, the so-called offensive elements are downplayed or softened somewhat (especially when compared to the ""Nazisploitation"" subgenre that, was also taking the grindhouse-circuit by storm around the same time). My real interest in these films (and I'm not a hypocrite for saying it), is for the opportunity they give us in displaying the female-sex in all its glory (nudity in films, whether its Art House/Exploitation is so much more honest and refreshing than the Hollywood variety and, one of the probable reasons as to why these films were so successful in the first place), provided its not abusive/intrusive to the participants involved (however, this might be a mute and ironic point when discussing ""transgressive"" Cinema). The two female leads in question here with FFN are, Paola D'Egidio and the very beautiful Maria Rosaria Riuzzi (from ""Sorbole...che romagnola"" 1976), but Paola D'Egidio had more screen-time (without clothes anyway). Some scenes would even be considered outright ""softcore"". And, believe it or not, there is a twist-ending that redeems this story on a somewhat positive note. However, we're still talking about Cult Cinema here; so this may be an irrelevant point I'm making. Nevertheless, worthy of the elements I described to all fans/collectors of this twisted, perverse, and unique subgenre of the Cinema.

The DVD picture and sound quality by Mutant Sorority Pictures is actually very good to excellent, the film has been digitally re-mastered (I've seen some really horrible prints of this film before). All regions, English (dubbed), no subtitles, FFN, NR 86 mins.

Love and Peace,

It takes place in Louisiana and utilizes the same dubbing as Italian westerns, mafia, etc films. No southern accents. African-Americans sound the same as whites.

In this film everyone has sex with everyone else. Slaves only have sex while standing and chained to a post. The film climaxes with a biracial foursome (two standing chained to a post) that had me scratching my head. Seriously?

The film includes some minor full frontal nudity, and plenty of topless scenes as it was clearly shown as a drive-in late feature.

A load of slaves are taken to some (unnamed) southern plantation, where they are beaten, abused, but remarkably healthy and sexually alluring. Add one perverse FEMALE slave owner (looking much like Gina Lolabrigitta on crack) with a yen for the legendary black sexuality; her elder brother prefers nubile slave girls; there is a mixed race baby in the bunch. The dialogue is halting and self-conscious. The sets appear to have been somewhere around Sicily or Abbruzia. The whole thing is justified by a brief and stilted homily in the final scene about ""the end of slavery"" when it seemed all the time the characters were having a helluva good time WITH slaves.

The spatial transitions of the scene were ridiculous they were wearing same clothing and at one point the old dude had a beard then later the lighting was super bright but I couldn't tell that anything had changed over time, except his beard, later he lost his hair but same clothes, same walk, same vocal pattern. His so called Gf was sleeping with the so called son of a Mandinga who died. This movie is not even about Mandinga's at all. It's not even about slavery. Its basically soft porn

So in my opinion the Adr is terrible. these are not africans they are like some mixed Italian/Ethiopian people who do not look like Africans at all. they are totally different culture which makes this movie a fake. YOu can tell that whoever produced it doesn't know anything. The ADR was off track and unauthentic. YOu could tell they were not in Louisiana probably in Malta,Italy or someplace in Spain, but not in swamp country Lousiana

everyone and their dog knows that Louisiana still has plantations. LOL on this movie not one time do we even see a royalty free ext shot of a plantation. Also major, major, super major important part of story was when the mandinga woman has the master's child.  OK guess what??? we never even see the baby. spatial transition to like 30 years later and he doesn't even look black and he is all talking badly about slaves. was that comedy?

i think this is like a student film that went wrong. NO... students would have known how to do this film. It's lik really terrible do not waste 1.99 like I did... but if you need to laugh or show this to film students who are in their 20's then its ok how not to shoot a film, lighting issues, etc.

3399973,3,B00005LC9J,"Yes, I know, why would I give this insignificant, offensive, and poorly made film---3 stars---I'll explain! In ""Mandinga"" (from 1976), we have another Italian-made Cult/Sexploitation entry from the very nasty 70's (an era of the Cinema that will probably never be repeated in offering this kind of fare). Capitalizing on its equally questionable and tasteless American counterpart---""Mandingo"" from a year earlier. ""Mandinga"" is even more over-the-top in reveling in the sociopathic torture and abuse of human-innocents (poor and helpless black slaves)!

When 'Rhonda' (Paola D'Egidio) makes the 'Hunter' plantation her home---she will unleash her sadistic lust of torture and pain on everyone that is ensnared in her vicious trap (master and slave alike). Ultimately, she will seduce the owner's son---but he too will grow tired of her depravities before---but no sooner will she get her ""just deserts!""

That pretty much sums it up! Now, here's the deal. Like so many of these perverse entries: the violence, acting, and dialogue (the dubbed voices are hilarious) was too comical/fake to really be taken seriously. Therefore, the so-called offensive elements are downplayed or softened somewhat (especially when compared to the ""Nazisploitation"" subgenre that, was also taking the grindhouse-circuit by storm around the same time). My real interest in these films (and I'm not a hypocrite for saying it), is for the opportunity they give us in displaying the female-sex in all its glory (nudity in films, whether its Art House/Exploitation is so much more honest and refreshing than the Hollywood variety and, one of the probable reasons as to why these films were so successful in the first place), provided its not abusive/intrusive to the participants involved (however, this might be a mute and ironic point when discussing ""transgressive"" Cinema). The two female leads in question here with FFN are, Paola D'Egidio and the very beautiful Maria Rosaria Riuzzi (from ""Sorbole...che romagnola"" 1976), but Paola D'Egidio had more screen-time (without clothes anyway). Some scenes would even be considered outright ""softcore"". And, believe it or not, there is a twist-ending that redeems this story on a somewhat positive note. However, we're still talking about Cult Cinema here; so this may be an irrelevant point I'm making. Nevertheless, worthy of the elements I described to all fans/collectors of this twisted, perverse, and unique subgenre of the Cinema.

The DVD picture and sound quality by Mutant Sorority Pictures is actually very good to excellent, the film has been digitally re-mastered (I've seen some really horrible prints of this film before). All regions, English (dubbed), no subtitles, FFN, NR 86 mins.

Love and Peace,

In this film everyone has sex with everyone else. Slaves only have sex while standing and chained to a post. The film climaxes with a biracial foursome (two standing chained to a post) that had me scratching my head. Seriously?

The film includes some minor full frontal nudity, and plenty of topless scenes as it was clearly shown as a drive-in late feature.

Add one perverse FEMALE slave owner (looking much like Gina Lolabrigitta on crack) with a yen for the legendary black sexuality; her elder brother prefers nubile slave girls; there is a mixed race baby in the bunch. The dialogue is halting and self-conscious. The sets appear to have been somewhere around Sicily or Abbruzia. The whole thing is justified by a brief and stilted homily in the final scene about ""the end of slavery"" when it seemed all the time the characters were having a helluva good time WITH slaves.
