6464291,5,B00L3ZB4F6,"All I have to say to those who feel like they are getting ""ripped off""... SHUT UP!!! When ""Eraserhead"" came to my local repertory theatre, it was THE cinematic experience that turned a young child previously hooked on ""The Terminator"" and ""Creepshow 2"" (rented by my father at the local 7-11) into a cinephile that would spend nights reading ""19XX's Annual Film and Movie Guide"", bending the pages of the films I knew I would see one day.
  ""Eraserhead"" came to town about once a year, and that day was BOOKED! It came to my town on the midnight of my 18th birthday... so I crammed as much drinking as I could before 11:45pm. As mad as my friends were at me for leaving the party, in my head it boiled down to, ""Eraserhead's playing... the end"". And once one of my Film Studies professors let me know that the film had actually been released on tape (at about the time VHS/BetaMax came out), my free time suddenly went from ""free time? no - I gotsta study!"" to ""free time? no - I gotsta scour through thousands of VHS tapes at pawn shops"".
  But now... you HEATHENS actually **complain** because the movie - with its odd lighting and wonky sound - that Criterion & Blu-Ray were MADE FOR - has come into existence. Meanwhile, I have a thought-induced-orgasm every time I see Eraserhead, Ms. 45, Videodrome, or any other movie I had spent decades looking for just sitting there, now free to be mine (on Blu-Ray!!!) for the mere exchange of money.
  If any of you are feeling ripped off, I think the new Schwarzenegger movie can be rented at 7-11... er, I mean bought at Wal Mart on July 22.",1405209600,23,1588,4.439862542955327

For me Eraserhead is still Lynch's best film. The surreal story, visuals, and sound all add up to the definition of ""Lynchian."" Nice to see it getting a Criterion release.",1404259200,31,702,5.324324324324325
6464293,4,B00L3ZB4F6,"If you are a David Lynch fan, this is a must see.  He unfurls what can only be described as a poetic, visual nightmare:  an inhibited man lives in a bleak, post-industrial landscape, amidst abandoned factories, cheap apartments, and living appliances.  He does not understand the people around him, even blundering into fatherhood with an equally clueless young lady whose mother may have a thing for him.  It is increasingly unclear what he is imagining and what is real, like the deformed singing lady somewhere inside his radiator to the sperm-like creature that is apparently his son; in one unforgettable scene, he is served a chicken that is kicking while emitting a black slurry.  For those who enjoy this kind of thing - and nothing is clearly explained, so it must be interpreted - this is a cult treat.  The acting, while occasionally amateurish, is also quite good.

As I enjoy interpreting stuff like this, I will offer mine here - ***spoiler alert***.  The man hates his surroundings and relationships so much that his way of coping is to go insane.  He is seeing what he is feeling inside, and is creating a fantasy world (eraserhead).  While hopeful that he might find some human contact, like the loose woman across the hall, he also feels complete disgust at the reality of physical intimacy, hence his perception of his child as a spermatozoid from himself.  As he slips further away from reality, the images become more bizarre and disturbing, until he is completely lost.

For an early directorial effort, the film is really striking and bold.  I can't say I enjoyed watching it again, but it is fun to see a talent like Lynch's in embryo - he adds plot and far more interesting characters to his later work, but the atmospherics are present in this.  I would recommend renting this rather than buying, unless, of course, you love this cult genre.",1404086400,8,1867,4.775700934579439
6464294,5,B00L3ZB4F6,"This movie was made as David Lynch's Thesis whilst he attended USC film school. I'm not sure how much more the Criterion Collection can add to the mix of the Eraserhead 2000 edition, except maybe the shorts Lynch made directly after this was made.
The story as a whole is made to be painfully slow and being filmed in black & white, gives it that true creepy feel Lynch so adeptly conveys in most of his films. He is very big on adding in to the background, subtle noise/sound, presented here as a continual hiss and industrial sound heard throughout the movie. This was also evident in his Elephant Man. Henry, the hero of this odd cinema extraordinaire, has the same quirks that Jack Nance used as his character presence in Blue Velvet, a Milquetoast bullied person, trying to survive in a beastly world. Come to think of it, this was Nance's character in Lynch's Dune. But I digress, if you like odd but interesting, this is definitely the movie for you. And I warn all else, This movie is NOT for everyone. Especially when it gets to the end of the movie (this is where you learn the reason for the title of the movie).

6464302,3,B00L3ZB4F6,"It would be trite to call this film surreal and crude to call it weird. It reminds me of an early Dali film attempt still half remembered. The symbolism is stark and interpreting it is a exercise in futility. Yet interpretation is tempting.
The lady in the radiator is false religion? The demented guy with the levers who controls what seem to be sperm is he God? The planet originating the sperm is it possibly the primordial earth? The deformed baby ( a lamb foetus?) is a symbol of an imperfect God or perhaps the fragility and sanctity of life?
The speculation is endless yet the legacy of this film is its stark photography. Black and white scenes of a dreary industrial wasteland remind me of the desolation of communist East Germany. The background in dismal grey shows a convincing alt reality of families that are not, food that lives, factories that exist yet produce nothing except questions. Was this film the incubus of Edward Scissor hands? Just a thought. Erase your head when viewing. I endured it because so many others have.",1495324800,2,1042,4.699453551912568

 But this is definitely the definitive version so far! The picture quality is great, and the sound is, too! The case and everything is very nice, just like all of the other criterion collection blu rays that I've purchased.

It's an abstract art film without being pretentious and while the pace is slow, it will keep your attention. A surreal, dark visual masterpiece.

6464312,5,B00L3ZB4F6,"Writer, director and producer David Lynch had already been experimenting in short films but with his first feature, Eraserhead, he showed the world of cinema a new way to see. After taking five years to complete with a release in 1977, Lynch took movie goers on a surreal and nocturnal odyssey of its character, the reserved and distant Henry (Jack Nance) as he struggles to come to terms with his newly born deformed baby. Inside this odd story is some of the most remarkable dream like imagery ever conceived. From the very bleak first frame, its oddness doesnt let you go until its some might say a hopeful finale that still doesnt come completely clear to the audience. Many could assume that the film thrives on how strange it is and Lynch himself has never been one to explain his work but weather that is the case or not, filmmaking would never be the same again. While it is routed in cult and almost horror like sensibilities, I don't think it would be out of line to place it with the pure art of Buuel, Fellini, Bergman or Kubrick. Lynch created another work that broke the mold of film just as those directors did and continued to do so with future works The Elephant Man (1980), Blue Velvet (1986) and Mulholland Drive (2001) that even took his American surrealism approach to new levels of maturity and authenticity. As someone who feels that films should be about moments of true feeling rather than consistent logic and meaning, Lynch without a doubt lifts the minds eye to a new sense of wonder. Eraserhead is not for everyone and will never have a fixed critical reputation but for Lynch and all of the great artists of cinema, its probably for the better.",1474329600,12,1674,4.60200668896321

While I can appreciate for a being an impressive technical achievement for its time I just could not enjoy this movie at all, it literally didn't nothing for me.. I spent most of the movie debating whether or not I even wanted to finish it. I made it to the end and felt blank. Part of me feels like maybe I just completely missed the meaning of the film and part of me feels like the reason Lynch won't talk about what the film means is because there isn't any and it's just a pointless abstract mess.",1472428800,2,737,4.507462686567164

From watching this film from the first time, I just really enjoyed the atmosphere of this movie.  At points it can be quite unsettling to watch and other times, it leaves you scratching your head.  But, what makes a great movie great is the journey that it can take you and the questions that it leaves you at the end.  This film is a piece that can be dissected in many ways which can lead to many discussions.  Overall, I really enjoyed the story that was told in this film.

6464333,5,B00L3ZB4F6,"A formidable debut. And one that still stands the test of time. Ultra creepy and still valid in today's society where we question birth more than ever. And more than that as well.... this film is about a lot of things it seems. I'll leave it to the viewer to digest it themselves. Eraserhead is a high mark in experimental film. We rarely see movies like this anymore with the same quality and pristine touch.

The bluray transfer and case is top notch work. Everything here looks so much better than it ever did. It's like seeing a new film. And the sound.... What an improvement overall. Everything sizzles in this rendition like never before. The extras are also top notch. All of Lynch's early shorts are a great bonus.! All in all one of Criterion's better packages. A high bitrate reveals a lot of finely tuned grain for those purists. I didn't see too many issues with compression artifacts like some Criterions have had a problem with. Highly Recommended.

Note: One thing to watch out for is the glitch during one scene where the film may fade out to black if you have the flawed version. Just send a note to Criterion and you should be able to fix it up. Look on the web for further instructions. Apparently, the glitch was in the master they used. New ones don't seem to be affected and you may not have to do anything in that case.",1440547200,,1343,4.455284552845528
6464334,4,B00L3ZB4F6,"Since its release in 1977, David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" has sparked many debates over its controversial content, imagery and symbolism. Many of them on what the story is all about. To one of its cast member Catherine E Coulson (future Log Lady in ""Twin Peaks""), this was a love story. But for David Lynch, he wanted people to each have their own interpretations, therefore making the story a mystery as intriguing as ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""Inland Empire"", whose secrets he has refused to reveal although people like Naomi Watts have given a very consistent explanation I share. As for ""Eraserhead"", I do believe what Jennifer Lynch has said, that this movie concerns her father's fear of fatherhood and that she was the monstrous alien in the main character's building as she had clubbed feet at her birth. Which is ironic as I've heard many people describing the birth and first taking care of their child in the same way, as if they had appeared on another planet. And considering the main character's haircut is similar to David Lynch's, I do see a connection between the author and his hero.

Now though Lynch has refused to let his daughter's sole interpretation hamper everyone's opinions, I also think this movie is to Lynch what ""The Blood of a Poet"" is to Jean Cocteau. The opportunity for Lynch to put on film the thematics and preoccupations that would invade his artwork and future films. The seductive neighbour lady in her apartment linked to society's criminal underworld (""Blue Velvet""), a horrifying creature that haunts the main character's life (Killer Bob in ""Twin Peaks"" and the tramp behind Virkie's in ""Mulholland Drive""), an unresolved mystery with red herrings, the incestuous family (""Twin Peaks"", ""Mulholland Drive""), sexual/psychological abuse (""Elephant Man"", ""Blue Velvet"", ""Twin Peaks"", etc.), the fifties design; in short everything that constitutes David Lynch's work. An embodiment of different genres of comedy, drama, and romance. Under tensions that people have compared to a horror movie due to the sound work and editing Lynch has made himself an expert.

But unlike ""Twin Peaks"", ""Mulholland Drive"", ""Rabbits"", and ""Inland Empire"", which I have adored, ""Eraserhead"" did not captivate me as much as I wished it could have. I felt the movie dragged in its middle and I wished that certain parts could have been trimmed, either in the apartment or after the Lady in the Radiator scene. Also, there were times I felt that Lynch had fallen too much in love with his imagery and was neglecting on his storyline; making it too much obscure when it could have been simpler, which is also what Lars von Trier did on his first movie.

Now of course this is my sole opinion on ""Eraserhead"". And for each viewer, different preferences for his kind of movies. But personally, I think the movie could have been shorter, lasting around fifty minutes instead of eighty-nine. As a short film rather than a feature length. And seriously, I wish Lynch had not asked Criterion to not separate his movie into chapters. As he had already done that for many of his movies because he wants people to enjoy them in one sitting, I think this kind of pressure is not the best way to motivate newcomers as it would make that first experience more difficult to enjoy, which is how my first viewing of his movie ""Elephant Man"" happened.

In conclusion, I think Lynch said in better words and images what he did in his short movie ""the Grandmother"", available in this Blu-Ray's bonuses, than what he did in ""Eraserhead"". The conflict of fatherhood where a family member escapes from his dysfunctional family into a private world he has access to. So if I were to watch that Blu-Ray, it would be for the cinematography, the sound work, the ambience, and the short movies Lynch did, especially ""the Grandmother"", whose plot I found easier to connect with and more direct.
Nevertheless, ""Eraserhead"" forewarned how David Lynch's revolutionary camera and storytelling would revolution cinema the same way as Lars von Trier's and Cocteau's, telling stories with more earth-grounded people, with real life preoccupations in a world filled with light and darkness, unlike this utopic, close-minded, and ignorant gruel certain Show business executives want the public to swallow and believe. When it deserves better than those TV shows that become redundant soaps, those intellectually lazy blockbuster movies, those degrading reality shows, and those scandal shows that appear either under the form of a talk show, or a court TV program. Stuff that always has to treat everyone as the lowest common denominator when they are and can be so much more.",1438819200,9,4650,4.98840206185567
6464335,2,B00L3ZB4F6,"Although I consider myself a fan of David Lynch's work for the most part, I've avoided this, his first feature for all these years.  Frankly, I'm not sure why.  Other that the photo of the title character, I knew little about the movie except that it is considered a cult classic, perhaps on the same level as ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" another film I didn't see until late in life.  So before reading any reviews or understanding much about the plot, I took a look.

Let's get this out of the way up front.  The movie isn't for everyone and that includes me.  The story is absurd and there are so many theories about what it's about that there evidently is no right answer.  So that in itself makes it hard to describe.  John Nance is Henry Spencer, the guy with the now popular (NBA & musicians) stacked flattop.  He's obviously a little weird, not only with his hair do but with that white pocket protector he wears in the hanky pocket on his suitcoat.  Come on dude, geeks wear those on their shirts.

The opening scene would suggest that Henry may be an alien.  And the baby that comes along a little later would seem to emphasize that point.  The baby mama, Mary X (Charlotte Stewart) is a bit of an oddball herself, as are her parents, Mr. X (Allen Joseph) and Mrs. X (Jeanne Bates) not to mention grandma (Jean Lange) who's kept hidden in the kitchen, unmoving with a ciggy is hanging from her lips.  So is this all a dream?  And if so, whose?

Henry's one room apartment is filled with piles of dirt, creepy crawly things and a bug eaten blanket.  What does it all mean? Evidently, Lynch doesn't know or at least isn't telling.  Yes, it is all stupid and not worth a lot of time thinking about it.  Yet, we do.  What is good about the film is the effort and production quality given the budget, actors and crew.  Lynch worked over 5 years to get this film out, so props, I guess, for that.  The camera work, lighting and especially the variety of interesting sound effects suggest Lynch has vision.

Having watched several interviews after the fact with Lynch and many of those involved, we know they had a good time making it and became a family-like unit.  Obviously more than Lynch was to his own wife, who he divorced midway through the production and their young daughter.  I suspect Henry has some Lynch-like qualities in his character and perhaps daughter Jennifer's clubfoot has some influence on the alien-looking infant.  The film is shot in black and white with significant blends of grey.  It is stark, ugly but according to Lynch, beautiful.  We clearly have a different understanding of those words.

This Criterion DVD package includes 6 short films Lynch made, some prior to this one.  The second disc contains a Lynch documentary which runs about 85 minutes and several other interviews with Lynch and cast and crew members over many years.  There is also an interesting booklet filled with photos and a long interview with Lynch.",1436659200,,2962,4.574144486692015

6464338,4,B00L3ZB4F6,"This movie deeply disturbed me, in a good way. The special effects are TREMENDOUS and really drive home the bizarre nature of this film, the first directed by David Lynch. It's tough to explain the plot and the point of David Lynch films, because so much is left to the viewer to decide for themselves. I like that. This film is like a surrealist painting; there's a lot going on under the surface, and it's up to you to figure out and decide what.

The movie is a horror film, and I WOULD NOT recommend this to younger viewers. I was disturbed by many of the grotesque images on screen.",1435104000,2,587,4.336363636363636

6464343,5,B00L3ZB4F6,I'm a big fan of Lynch's other works but somehow hadn't seen this one yet. The cinematography was the first thing that caught my eye. I'm not sure what this looked like at a midnight screening in the 70s but the Criterion Blu-Ray looks phenomenal here. The scenes look haunting and mysterious in black and white yet are remarkably clear for a film like this. Some of the images are really striking. The movie itself is funny in a disturbing kind of way. Similar to some of his later films but with less of a coherent story and more diving into the surrealism.

6464350,4,B00L3ZB4F6,"One thing found consistently in David Lynch films is people trying to figure out what is going on and what his movies really mean. If you like your movies linear, defined, and eventually everything tied together and explained then this movie isn't for you. This film will make you wonder what you've just seen and what it all means. Is it a dream? Is he slowly going crazy? Is it reality? So here comes what might be SPOILERS for you, so stop reading if you don't want any hints, ideas or guesses.
I think the movie is about a flawed god manipulating a sick world, with a look at the people caught in it. In the opening scene a being with goiters and lumps, shabbily dressed in a dilapidated shack works levers as he watches the world. Since gods create in their own image, the world is shabby, broken, shadowed. The people are wrecks, their behaviors strange and disjointed. They look like survivors of a nuclear war, definitely survivors of something apocalyptic. Now the movie gets really strange, since it wasn't strange enough yet.
So, having given you my basic interpretation of what I think is happening,  let's hit a few high points. Don't ignore the bare tree in Henry's room. Is it sculpture? Or maybe in a bare world you maintain bare plants. I've also wondered about a correlation to a well known apple tree in a lost garden. The woman in the radiator. Gods have angels, don't they? As far as the baby goes, mutants might well produce mutants. Or maybe it's a comment on parenthood. Or maybe a comment on children. Or maybe ... yeah, you get it. The whole 'get your head cut off and get turned into erasers' thing. Well, doesn't Henry's hair kind of look like an eraser sitting on top of his head? What does it mean? I don't know. Haven't got a clue. A comment on our basic value? How easily we are erased? How we are ultimately discarded by an industrial society that uses up every bit of us even after death? If you figure it out let me know. Then we have the woman across the hall. Temptation, fantasy, forbidden fruit. Or maybe she's there because Lynch like pretty women somewhere in his films. We may never know, since Lynch doesn't like to explain his films.
My views are debatable, which is what Lynch's movies are about. Debate and interpretation. He doesn't make it easy. Try and figure out Mulholland Drive. Ten viewings and extensive reading has got me kinda there. I think I have the basics.
Oh, and the Criterion offering is pretty good if you have an HDTV and a good sound system to take advantage of the Bluray and sound, not so good on older TVs but better than the old VHS offerings.",1423526400,20,2613,4.489495798319328

6464364,4,B00L3ZB4F6,"""Eraserhead"" more or less begins with a plot of sorts and then veers off into grotesque stream of conscious industrial nightmare imagery.  Those familiar with the work of director David Lynch realize that traditional narrative isn't not so much his forte rather it isn't really a concern of his.  Lynch has constructed a work that will horrify you and assault the senses.  He's abetted here by terrific black-and-white camerawork by Herbert Cardwell and Frederick Elmes, evocative sound design by Allen Splet, and haunting Fats Waller organ fills on the soundtrack.  This being his debut work you can see how it informs Lynch's later films like ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Mulholland Drive"". Certainly ""Eraserhead"" is not without its flaws but it resonates in your mind nonetheless.  An audacious first feature film from one of the most distinctive artists working in the film medium.  Lynch has stated that this film was inspired by the period he lived in Philadelphia while attending art school.  Having spent my whole life in the City of Brotherly Love I'm not sure he meant that statement in the perjorative sense or not.",1414281600,3,1116,5.032608695652174

This BluRay release completely blew me away (as in WOW).  The picture detail of the 4K scan along with the uncompressed score was incredible to experience.  Although I had seen the film one or two additional times on VHS since the early 80's, experiencing this BluRay version was like watching it for the first time.

6464368,5,B00L3ZB4F6,"Hopefully this is the last time I buy this film as I doubt another edition can possibly top this. Anyone who first comes into contact with the film is left with a certain unsettling feeling that life has the possibility of being beyond unique in ways that muster darkness so dark you will never find bottom. The initial theatre release probably passed within an arthouse crowd only with a smattering of last acid heads on planet. Sometime in the 1980's an inferior VHS copy surfaced finding favor with college crowds and cinema philes. The first DVD pressing probably used that VHS as source materials. Most of us waited until Lynch addressed ""the decent copy"" stigma that still fills the video store shelves to this day as it had good bonus features (some you see here) and other titles/essays/randoms/bookends served as companion pieces. I still have those few. The bigger question is, will all those faithful followers break out the coin for yet another edition? I can answer yes and guess the rest.
