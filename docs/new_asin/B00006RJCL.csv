1789529,4,B00006RJCL,"If you've never watched Mystery Science Theatre 3000, then you are missing out on one of the funniest television shows of all time.  This excellent four-disc set contains four episodes, as well as including the original movies that they were derived from.  DVD is a great format for this show; the episodes lose nothing on multiple viewings, and there are loads of jokes that aren't obvious until the third or fourth viewing.  One simply can't catch all of the pop culture references and comments the first time around, and subsequent viewings can turn a mildly amusing episode into an uproarious one.
Here are some short comments on each of the four episodes.
BLOODLUST:  Starring Robert ""The Brady Dad"" Reed in the tightest tee-shirt you're ever likely to see, this film has a bunch of young people running around an island inhabited by an enigmatic homicidal maniac.  In case you hadn't figured it out, it's the homicidal maniac who has the bloodlust.  Also on this disc is the short film: UNCLE JIM'S DAIRY FARM, ""the farm of secrets and lies"", where two city folks drop off their two annoying kids on their country relatives.  Poor kids.  Poor audience.
CATALINA CAPER:  It has Little Richard!  And precious little else.  A film that isn't sure whether it wants to be serious or funny.  I'd settle on ""funny"", except that none of the jokes are.  It's sort of like what you'd expect Gilligan's Island to be like if you crossed it with a bad episode of Dragnet and threw in some random musical numbers (and God help me, but I actually like some of the songs; I think I need help).  ""Join me in my Bath of Death!""
THE CREEPING TERROR:  You won't believe how bad this movie is.  If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I wouldn't have imagined that something like this could have been made.  Allegedly, during the production of this low-budget thriller, they accidentally dropped the sound equipment into a pond.  Anyone else would have said fair enough and taken this as a hint from above as to the quality of the film.  But, no, they go ahead anyway... without sound.  The majority of the talking scenes are completed by having a narrator tell us what the people are discussing.  You see characters' lips moving, but all you hear is the strange voice of the narrator imparting random information.  You couldn't make this sort of thing up.  There's a simply wonderful scene where one cop talks to another one about the joys of marriage and settling down.  The narrator, with all the subtlety of a slow-moving monster, takes great pains to point out exactly what lessons the cops are learning.  Unbelievable!
The monster itself is the epitome of all bad movie creatures.  It moves along at the slowest pace imaginable and relies on its victims to not only avoid running away but to actually pull themselves up into its mouth.  Strangely enough, most of the monster's dinners manage to show off a lot of leg during the process of being horribly devoured.  So much silliness in one film makes this an ideal candidate for MST3k, and this is one of their stronger efforts.
THE SKYDIVERS:  This movie is about skydivers - and nothing else.  People repeatedly throw themselves out of airplanes, and when they aren't actually skydiving, they're talking about skydiving, or drinking in skydiving themed bars.  There may have been some sort of plot, but I must have blinked and missed it.  Shame.  This episode comes with a short feature, WHY STUDY INDUSTRIAL ARTS.  A frankly disturbing look at why kids in the '50s should have signed up for their High School Industrial Arts class.  Lots of great opportunities for mocking, and the gang don't miss any.
Each of these discs contains the original, uncut, unMST3ked versions of the films on the flip side.  Approach these editions with extreme caution.",1039046400,37,3790,4.750382848392037
1789530,3,B00006RJCL,"Don't get me wrong, I love MST3K and I'm glad to have DVD copies, but that being said... Rhino is just rereleasing the stuff they already put out on VHS with no real extras. But all and all it's nice they finally put out a 4 in 1 boxed set.
Creeping Terror is worth the price of this DVD alone.",1038787200,,294,3.9166666666666665
1789531,5,B00006RJCL,"This has to be the best release of MST3K by Rhino, and I have a bunch (they didn't confuse Mike for Joel on the back cover). This set is definitely all about Mike, but one of the episodes does feature Joel. Right down to the packaging, they made it great.  The case has a pop-up book feel to it, as you can use a little pull tab to pull the original SOL across the top of the package, and in the center above the planet logo is a wheel you can turn to show funny comments from various characters.  Unfortunately, there aren't any bonus goodies--unless you count the trailers--but it's still a required piece of any devoted MiSTie's collection.  As with other Rhino DVDs in the collection, the flip side of the disc has the un-MiSTied version, for those masochists out there who enjoy bad, smelly cinema.
Catalina Caper has to be one of the stupidest films I have ever sat through, and its alternate title ""Never Steal Anything Wet"" should tell you all you need to know.  Short form:  a very painted napkin gets stolen from a pegboard museum, and the thieves are out to doublecross their patron by convincing him to buy their designer impostor!  But they LOSE the real thing--in a water-tight tube in the middle of the ocean, and now they have to retrieve it.  OOPSIE!  This is yet another of the obtuse beach movies the inhabitants of the SOL ripped on with great success.  Servo's ode to Creepy Girl will have your side hurting, and fans of Mork & Mindy will quickly recognize Exodor (Robert Donner) as the hapless klutz whose function in the film is to remain unnamed,unspeaking, and to do water-soaked pratfalls every time he's in the frame.  Be amazed when you see Little Richard's mercifully brief cameo...
Bloodlust is another hilarious sendup about a freak with a penchant for hunting--hunting PEOPLE, that is.  Brace yourself to see Robert Reed (yes, Mr. Brady) in the world's tightest t-shirt and sucking in his gut every time he knows the camera is on him.  Pay special attention to the continuity (or lack thereof), especially in the fight scene between one of the girls and one of the doctor's henchmen.  The ending makes you wish it could've come just a short 10 minutes into this smelly celluloid...
The Skydivers is another jumbled presentation from one of the SOL's favorite (using the term loosely) directors/writers/actors Coleman Francis.  People do actually jump out of planes; there's a dance scene with some strange unnamed, giant woman and the chick on skates looks on, and the mean bimbo sabotages some 'chutes.  What's it all about?  Who knows!?!?  This is one of the 3 Coleman Francis film-flams that was MiSTied.  Francis's Red Zone Cuba is also available on DVD from Rhino, but at this time, The Beast of Yucca Flats isn't.  HEY RHINO--hint, hint!
The Creeping Terror features almost no dialogue and a hilarious slow-moving monster who has a taste for necking couples.  Not really more to say....
Rhino did this set up just perfectly, and there is talk that more sets will be forthcoming.  Let's hope so!",1038700800,10,3032,4.7153700189753325
1789532,5,B00006RJCL,"First let me say that I've seen (and have on tape) every episode from the cable run, and all the KTMA (local UHF station in MN) episodes available...no, that doesn't make me special, just adds emphasis to this: Catalina Caper is my favorite episode. Just nudges Manos and several others. It's terrific. A thing of beauty. Just don't watch the uncut version unless you're a masochist.
The others in the set are definitely some stong eps - this isn't one great show and some filler. But Catalina Caper...Oh, Creepy Girl...",1035417600,12,520,4.788888888888889
1789533,5,B00006RJCL,"Thank you Rhino for finally getting us the box sets we've been clamoring for.  In this box set are the episodes ""Catalina Caper"", ""The Creeping Terror"", ""Bloodlust (with short- A Visit to Uncle Jim's Dairy Farm)"", and ""The Sky Divers (with short- Why Study Industrial Arts)"".
Catalina Caper:  1960's era beach movie with a plot that goes something like this: stolen scroll, lil' Richard singing, dancing, dancing, volleyball, dancing, scuba diving, & dancing.  Also appearing in this stink-burger was Lyle Waggoner, from the Carol Burnett show, as a scuba diving hood.  Servo's song to Creepy Girl is a classic.
The Creeping Terror:  Wow!  Can that monster creep!  Probably one of the most hilarious movie monsters ever.  An old woman with a motorized cart could easily get a way from this creature, and yet dozens of fit young folk get gobbled up by this overgrown shag carpet.  Apparently nobody ever figured out the concept of running away during the 50's.
Bloodlust:  Robert Reed (Mike Brady from the Brady Bunch) stars as a studly young man vacationing on a yacht with his friends.  He wears a T-shirt so tight you'd swear it was painted on.  The plot is basically a ripoff of the Most Dangerous Game.
The Sky Divers:  Another piece of flotsam from Coleman Francis.  With acting preformances so tepid that you wonder if the actors have a pulse.  Watch for the truly bizzare dance party with a woman of Amazonian proportions.  Also look for Petey the plane.
The Episodes I hope they release soon are ""Pod People, ""Angels Revenge"", ""The Puma Man"", ""Werewolf"", and ""Santa Claus Conquers The Martians""",1034726400,76,1602,4.899628252788104

1789566,4,B00006RJCL,"For the uninitiated, Mystery Science Theater 3000, also known as MST3K, was a television comedy series that ran from 1988 until 1999. Fans of this cult show clamor for the episodes and this is Volume One, featuring four cheese filled films with running commentary by the denizens of the Satellite of Love. Episodes include:

*Catalina Caper-a 1967 beach party comedy murder mystery movie starring Tommy Kirk.

*The Creeping Terror-the 1964 science fiction narrated film featuring a shag carpet as a monster and is often considered to be one of the worst films of all time.

*Bloodlust!-a 1961 thriller starring Robert Reed. This episode also features the educational short film Uncle Jim's Dairy Farm

*The Skydivers-a 1963 Coleman Francis film which  was once the lowest-rated film of all time on the Internet Movie Database. This episode also features the educational short film Why Study Industrial Arts?

1789568,4,B00006RJCL,"I bought this Mystery Science Theater 3000 DVD set in the Fall of 2002. It's out of print as of 2011. It had four random episodes from the Comedy Central era. The original, uncut versions of each film are included as extras.

Bloodlust!(1961): Robert Reed from The Brady Bunch stars in this Most Dangerous Game(1934) rip off made for the teenyboppers of the 1960's. An eccentric rich guy hunts men and women who stumble upon his island. June Kenny plays the film's blonde, sensual heroine. Watch as her height changes at random from shot to shot!

Catalina Caper(1967): This was one of the last of the 1960's Beach Party movies. It stars Tommy Kirk(Old Yeller, Son of Flubber) and Del Moore. The film pretends that it has a plot revolving around a stolen painting, but it's just an excuse to see nubile, sexy 20-something year old men and women dance on a beach to popular music. The 1967 version is included as an extra, but it's in worse shape than the MST3K version!

The Creeping Terror(1964): This is one of the worst horror movies ever made! It feels like a bad rip off of The Blob(1958). A police officer fights a giant extraterrestrial being that's snacking on human beings! The sound equipment fell in a lake and the director narrated over most of the movie! A clip of this film was shown in The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made(2004).

The Skydivers(1962): This is a dull drama with wooden acting, clunky dialouge, poor editing, and gags about coffee! The film's climax is one of the most shocking images that I have ever seen! The only redeeming factor is some riveting footage of people skydiving. The film's leading lady sports the kind of hairstyle that Marlo Thomas had on the TV show That Girl(1966-1971)!

One day, these MST3K episodes will be released on Blu Ray and/or DVD. This DVD set was released by Rhino and future DVD releases of MST3K will be released by Shout Factory.",1306972800,3,1888,4.640718562874252
1789569,4,B00006RJCL,"In The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Collection, Vol. 1, Tom Servo and friends are forced to endure the ""films"" Bloodlust, Catalina Caper, The Creeping Terror, and Skydivers, while making jokes about what is happening onscreen in these bad movies. Bloodlust and Skydivers are both so boring that not even the Mystery Science Theater gang can make them worth watching. However, Catalina Caper and The Creeping Terror are both so hilarious that they make this set worth it.",1294012800,,470,5.116883116883117
1789570,5,B00006RJCL,"I loved discovering this show when I was 14 when it aired at midnight on Comedy Central. I even had a T-shirt that I rocked in high school (no one got it!). Then they moved to Sci Fi, and the shift to Mike Nelson and the dumb mother Forrester skits were hard to accept. I had subsisted on 2 VHS tapes I saved that each had 4 episodes with Joel on them for several years before I got this box set as a birthday present.

Now, Skydivers is one of my favorite experiments! ""It seems they forgot to have something happen in this movie."" Love it! And the more times you watch, the more funnier they get. Catalina Caper - that is not up to par for Joel at all. Thanks for defending him! Creeping terror would've been bad even with direct sound! Great episode.

There are also two shorts - Industrial Arts and the Farm one. Those are GREAT! Anytime they get those old shorts, they are hilarious when they rip on them.

Hercules Unchained, It Conquered The World, and The Killer Shrews (all with Joel) remain my ultimate favorites. I wish these weren't so expensive - I want all of them!",1293062400,,1079,4.305418719211823
1789571,4,B00006RJCL,"I bought Volume 1, not having seen any of the episodes before my purchasing it.  Here's my thoughts:

CATALINA CAPER:  I gotta get this one out of the way first, it sucks.  Not just the movie (all the movies suck, its kinda the point) but the episode itself.  This episode ranks next to SWAMP DIAMONDS as the lousiest Joel episode I've seen.  The movie itself is odd because its kind of a comedy, though (obviously) a failure of a comedy, and MST3K didn't really do a lot of comedies.  Kids go out for a summer at the beach, some art gets stolen, lots of go-go dancing ensues.  Plenty to make fun of, but because its so early on in the shows history, the riffs come slowly and are rarely funny.  Outside of some witty comments about how white everyone in the movie is, the remarks are the kind you and your friends would be making yourselves if you were just watching the movie.  Servo's host segment about the creepy girl is the best part of the episode, and when a host segment is the show's best moment, that should tell you something.

SKYDIVERS:  The reason I bought this set.  I love love LOVE the wonderful RED ZONE CUBA.  Coleman Francis made such a weird movie and it made for such a great MST3K episode (one of my top 5, actually) that I just had to see the rest of his work.  SKYDIVERS definitely delivers.  This weird, inept drama of the crumbling marriage of two people who run a recreational skydiving business makes for such good MST.  And what is with the characters of Coleman Francis' movies all being shot from helicopters at the end?  I haven't seen BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS yet but I wouldn't be surprised if someone guns down Tor Johnson from a helicopter at the end.  At least in SKYDIVERS it instills the message that sleeping with people for acid doesn't pay.  Oddly enough, this movie is the only film I've seen that features a go-go dancing/skydiving viewing party.  Who knew people did that?  And that stereotypical Scotsmen attended such parties?  Every bit as great as RED ZONE CUBA and that one was totally awesome.

THE CREEPING TERROR:  Has to be seen to be believed.  I can't fathom how someone made this into a feature length film.  A bunch of people walking under a comforter, uh, I mean a space alien, slowly creeps around eating people for 80 minutes.  The thing is, the monster moves so slowly that its victims have to stay still for a long time to be eaten.  Which is weird, since the movie insists on showing this as point of view shots from the monster itself, meaning that they could have been approached a lot FASTER since the monster wasn't ON SCREEN!!!  But thats just the tip of the iceberg on this one.  Most of the movie is music and voice over work from a narrator, who literally says dialogue for some of the characters, but then other scenes have dialogue.  So confusing.  I think my favorite scenes were when a dozen troops were firing bullet after bullet at the monster but nothing happens, yet three minutes later they accidentally hit it with a car and kill it.

Also, like the last two movies, this one has random go-go dancing.  And its the worst dancing of the three.  Overall, a slow moving, repetitive movie (Like PRINCE OF SPACE).  It'd be boring if it wasn't so freakin' weird (Like PRINCE OF SPACE). As such, it just gets sillier and sillier (I found myself laughing out loud just at the movie) and Mike and the bots do a great job with all of it(Like PRINCE OF SPACE).  A very good episode (Like... well you get the idea).

BLOODLUST:  This movie is what happens if ""The Most Dangerous Game"" story featured the kids from Scooby Doo.  Not as totally weird as the other three movies (and no go-go dancing either, otherwise we'd have a themed box set), this is mostly just B-grade black and white horror with all the melodrama and over acting you'd expect.  Its also one of the few exploitation flicks of the era to really deliver on the promise inherent in the title!  Considering its from '61, I'm really surprised by just how GORY this flick is.  You'll see severed limbs, a man stuffing a human head, a guy get an arrow in his eye, another guy get one in his gut, a guy shooting a dude with an arrow, then pulling it out and cleaning the blood off, a man burning to death in acid (with several cuts to and away from the burning man so they can keep cutting back to his skin melting off), and a guy getting his wrists and neck impaled on spikes (complete with tons of spraying blood).  Again, this is from 1961, and its not Hammer flick.  Gory!  Its makes for a pretty good episode, not as good as SKYDIVERS or CREEPING TERROR but still a worthy candidate for DVD.  BTW, The short on farming that comes before the movie is flat out awesome.  Totally classic.

All in all, its a good set.  Sure, you'll only watch CATALINA CAPER once, but the other 3 are all worth repeat viewings.",1292803200,3,4841,4.425821064552661
1789572,4,B00006RJCL,"Let me get this out of the way.  I'm a Mike guy.  I find all the Mike episodes hilarious, but I can't stand Joel Hodgeson.  The guy seemed constantly baked or at least half asleep the whole time and I don't find prop comedy funny (Carrot Top anyone?).  That said the Mike episodes rank amongst the best of the Comedy Central era.  ""The Creeping Terror"" is almost hilarious enough on it's own with arguably the worst Monster in cinema history, with its carpet-like body and Hobbit feet, and the commentary is spot-on.  ""Bloodlust"" is a terrible ""The Most Dangerous Game"" rip-off with future Mr. Brady Robert Reed constantly sucking his gut in and the guys have a great time riffing it.  Even with ""Terror""'s god-awful creature, the movie can't compete with the sheer suckiness of Colman Francis's ""The Skydivers,"" a movie whose major plot point is coffee.  The editing and god-awful acting make the film unwatchable without Mike and the bots, so it's wonderful that they are along for the ride.  So if you're like me and want great Mike episodes and can tolerate at least one Joel episode in your collection, buy this Volume.  On a different note, the case itself is kinda cool, with a quote wheel and a rocket that you can make fly with a tug of a cord.",1250121600,,1253,4.57847533632287

Not since the ""Bullitt"" race sequence have I watched such a great chase which captures the imagination.

""Catalina Caper"" another great film in this set with excellent bands throughout including Little Richard singing ""At the party"".  Why this wasn't released as a single, I'll never know.

1789615,4,B00006RJCL,"MST3K Volume 1 features three episodes with Mike Nelson and one with the show's creator Joel Hodgson. Three of these are funny while one is pretty lousy.

-The Skydivers: Not very clear what this one is totally about, but there's a couple trying to keep their marriage together, even though they both cheated also there's plenty of skydiving footage, some dancing and a lot of bad dialogue. Good lines throughout this one, like Mike's ""Did the actors do their own skydiving?"" followed by Crow's ""No, the skydivers did their own acting"", near the end when one guy is chasing the villains and driving fairly cautiously Mike pops ""Whether chasing or being chased, remember drive defensively"" and finally Mike's comment on the lack of action ""Seems like they forgot to have things happen in this movie"". Great comments on the bad acting too as well as the horrible editing, like Crow's shot at a bad jump cut, ""Someone with attention deficit disorder edited this movie"" and Servo's quip about a skydiver falling way too fast out of the plane, ""Geez, the last 2000 feet are the quickest"". Great episode overall.

-The Creeping Terror: Some monster crash lands on earth, starts eating people and grows, but is nice enough to let the people he eats help him move along, as it's obvious that's what's happening. There's also a sherriff, his wife and his best friend trying to find the monster with the help of a proffesor of sorts and a branch of the military (seems like it's a broken branch, though). Loved the lines, ""Did anyone in the 50's ever think of running?"" as characters just stand there and let the monster eat them basically, when the monster tries to eat a couple of people in a car with the roof down, it looks like he's doing something well, nasty with the car, Mike's ""Well you see when a monster and a small car love each other very much"" and when the momster's done Servo says ""Well, that was a new twist on an old trick huh"", when the main guy tries to smash some spacship technology with the butt of a gun Mike comments ""Hey, there are bullets in the other end of that thing"". Loved this episode, so absurd and badly done.

-Bloodlust: This one has Robert Reed (The Dad from ""The Brady Bunch"") and three other teens/20 somethings finding an island that houses a man who likes to hunt things including people for sport. The comments about Reed holding his gut in are funny, especially Crow's ""Man, his shirt's so tight you can see his liver"". Other funny lines include when a drunk man sees the four people Mike quips ""All eight of 'em?"" in a drunk voice, when two of the teens? are exploring the mansion one of the henchmen comes into the room their hiding not very well in and as he's about to leave he turns around and Crow says ""When did I have teenagers installed?"", my favorite is at the end when the villain gets his throat and hands pierced against spikes on a wall Servo says ""Why this symbolism, did Christ hunt people on deserted islands?"". There are some dead spots in the film and in the quips, but this is a funny episode, just not as good as other ones they've done.

-Catalina Caper-Weird and pretty unfunny one here, something about a painting being stolen and some beach boys and girls try to find out who dunnit, I think. Not a lot of memorable lines here, but that's largely because the movie itself is a really bad comedy and Joel and the bots can only do so much. Skip this one unless you've seen other Joel episodes as this shouldn't be your first or even second or third introduction to him.

The extras include the original un-cut movies, but trying to sit through them with the commentary is hard enough, if you try to pay attention to the film itself that is. Also there are original trailers for every movie, but ""The Creeping Terror"".

Good set overall, just skip ""Catalina Caper"" again unless you've seen other Joel episodes beforehand.",1174780800,2,3878,4.564655172413793

And no extras, no interviews, no nothin' but 4 movies they did a long time ago? You can't convince me they had to pay that much for the rights to Catalina Caper, or any of these other stinkburgers. It may just be that the boys are trying to profit as much as they can, since the series is no more (many of them left it early to puruse individual careers, and were never heard from again--the medical term for this is the M*A*S*H Syndrome, btw).

1789619,5,B00006RJCL,"What better way is there to take movies with absolutely no plot, action, mood, tone, story, recognizable characters, make-up and decent color and make them watchable?  Well, MST3K did just that.

First in line is Bloodlust: Take four innocent people, put 'em on an island with a bored NRA wannabe and let 'em loose for him to hunt.  How could that be any better? . . . well, in a lot of ways, that's for sure.

Second comes Catalina Caper: Take a bunch of beach bums, add one map theft, a goofy screw up, a rich uncle, lip-synced songs and lots of booty shaking and what do you get? . . .  Seriously, what do you get, I have no idea.

Third comes the Creeping Terror: . . . enough said.

Finally comes The Skydivers: Once again, a bunch of booty shaking but topped with flesh flabbing as people jump from the sky for no apparent reason while a bunch of black clothing clad vigelantes decide to put acid in one of the parachutes for no apparent reason.  You see a theme going on here?  It's preceeded by a short about why you should study Industrial Arts.

Well, that's all I've got to say about this collection.  Add in the commentary and the movie breaks provided by the MST3K crew and these movies go from dreadful to watchable to downright hilarious.  Anybody who doesn't find fleshy and pastey teens playing with power tools, jumping from the sky, being eaten by a walking Chinese funeral precession, almost drowning and pulling leeches off of their flesh really needs to get out more.

1789620,5,B00006RJCL,"This is a surprisingly strong volume of MST3K episodes, a volume that appreciates after subsequent viewings.  It gets a bit of a bad rap because there is only *one* science fiction/monster film among the four, and that's Creeping Terror, although Bloodlust I suppose doesn't stray too much from the original premise of the show.  The volume hosts two films, Catalina Caper and Skydivers--although terrible and both share some good laughs--but nonetheless never really fit in with the MST3k concept.

Bloodlust - Mike episode.  Eccentric millionaire on an island hunting man for sport.  Although it starts off slow, there are some good laughs in this one about a third of the way through, especially at the expense of Robert Reed's ludicrous physique and speaking tone. Plus a cute little ""mistake""--when Servo says ""Now for some of my famous toe jelly"", you can hear one of the female members on the set (Mary Jo Piehl?  Mrs. Nelson?) laughing.  B+ episode.

Catalina Caper - Joel episode.  Riffing on an intentional comedy, no matter how unfunny it is, just doesn't work as well.  Not to say it isn't an enjoyable episode with some good laughs, such as the scene when the ""creepy girl"" brunnette comes out of the water onto the beach, and the protagonist is ogling her, and a stuck up blonde approaches said protagonist and asks, ""Are you coming or not?"", an eager-to-respond Crow looks at Joel and Joel just looks back and shakes his head...B/B- episode.

Creeping Terror - Mike.  The monster movie.  This is one of the funniest episodes in MST3k history.  The movie is so bad that you don't need Mike and the bots to prompt the laughs, but they have great fun with the Chinese New Year parade dragon that's gone on a rampage.  The monster, the narrator, the ""eating sequences"", the dancers that make the A/V club look cool, this one's a keeper.  A/A+.

Skydivers - Mike.  A film about skydivers and their passions--murder, adultery, coffee, frenetic dancing in front of moving planes, and of course, diving out of planes without proper inspecting their equipment.  This episode gets little love from Misties, but I think its an underrated classic.  The riffing starts off strong ""Someone with attention deficit disorder edited this movie!"", sputters in the middle, but ends strong.  B+/A-.",1142899200,6,2292,4.932114882506528

Usually, a good MST3K episode has one or at most two moments where I fall off my seat laughing; this one had at least a half-dozen.  You know the movie is boring when Mike and the 'bots have to invent a whole new subplot involving an imaginary talking plane named Petey to keep their attention up.

It's about a ufo that crash landed on earth and lets out a big alien that looks like.. well.... a bus covered in carpet. the peaple have to litterally climb in its mouth to be eaten. a good one in the collection.

bloodlust has really a BAD plot. in short peaple get stranded on an island with a madman who likes to hunt people and stuff them. mike did a great job with this one. mike said this movie would be suspenceful of it wasn't so unsuspenceful. this one also has some FALL ON THE FLOOR AND LAUGH TILL YOU CRY skits!!!! watch them for yourself.

The skydivers the least funny one in the group. never the less it is still funny. crow"" did the actors do their own skydiving"" mike ""no the skydivers did their own acting""

Like most cult sensations, this television series has an incredible knowledgeable fan base.  Yet, this fan base is somewhat comparable to the die hard Simpsons-ites I have met over the years.  That is, they tend to be very intelligent (somewhat nerdy), but always funny.  Once you open your mind to this series, you might be surprise about how erudite this show can be.

1789685,5,B00006RJCL,"In case you're new to the world of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" (MST3K for short, that what us fans - ""Misties"" - call it), this is the famous TV show where a silhouette of a man and two robots sitting in theater seats provide running commentary for some of the worst movies ever made. The ninety-minute episodes are also scattered with sketches and songs and amount to some of the smartest, most pop-culture savvy, side-splitting comedy ever made.
This is the first of the four-episode collections of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" offered from Rhino (previously they had only offered them in single DVD editions). It contains an interesting mix of movies: a science-fiction horror flick, a drama about skydivers, a 60s beach comedy, and a thriller on a tropical island. Three of the episodes come from the excellent sixth season, when Mike Nelson was the human host and the wisecracks and comments had become razor sharp and fast and furious. One episode comes from the second season, when the show had a more laid-back, friendly humor when Joel Hodgson was the host. Although this collection skews toward the later seasons, it is still a good general introduction to the show for newcomers, since most of the episodes are terrific. Fans who favor Joel Hodgson's style won't enjoy this as much as the second and third box set, but for most fans the inclusion of ""The Skydivers"" and ""The Creeping Terror"" make it a must-own.
Here's what you get:
BLOODLUST! Episode #607. A rip-off of ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" only with young college kids (one of whom is Robert Reed, future Brady Bunch dad!). The four dummies land on a jungle island to go exploring and become trapped by the rich but extremely wishy-washy maniac millionaire who owns the island. Apparently, he enjoys hunting down people to turn them into stuffed trophies. The film isn't really awful, just completely unoriginal and acted with total flatness. Robert Reed never seems more than mildly ""cheesed"" and ""fed up"" (to quote Mike and `Bots) with the life-threatening situation. But it's season six, and the show's writers couldn't do any wrong at this point, and the result is the usual hilarious romp.
CATALINA CAPER. Episode #204. This is the only Joel Hodgson episode in the collection, and it's an oddball entry in MST3K history: it's the only time the show took on an overt comedy. True, ""Catalina Caper,"" a teen 60s bikini beach comedy, isn't funny at all, but since it doesn't take itself seriously it becomes a tough target to make fun off. Joel and the `Bots have a good time with the lousy `prat-fall' comic, the awful musical numbers (one featuring Little Richard, waaaay out of his element), skinny Tommy Kirk, and the famous `creepy girl,' but this is a spotty episode and the weakest in this pack. Don't form your opinions of Joel's episodes based on this one.
THE CREEPING TERROR. Episode #606. This is a classic, and one of the worst films the MST3K team ever took on. A big shag carpet (oh, excuse me, I meant `alien') starts eating the citizens of a quiet California town; or at least it gets close enough to them so they can hoist themselves into its mouth. And why is the town so quiet? Because while making the film, someone accidentally kicked the sound equipment into a lake, so the whole movie has almost NO DIRECT SOUND. Yep, we instead have a narrator telling us what the characters are saying, doing, discussing, and so on. You have to see it (or hear it) to believe it! Mike and the `Bots unload on this one, and it's a scream. One of the funniest episodes ever.
THE SKYDIVERS. Episode #609. One of the most beloved of all MST3K episodes. Writer Paul Chaplin said of it: ""I don't want to criticize this movie. I'm too fond of the final result for our show...there's never been a better movie for our treatment."" I'll drink to that. This drama about the loves and losses of people working at a parachuting school is so weird, so bizarrely scripted, so awfully acted, filled with so many inexplicably wack-o characters, and shot with such stunning ineptitude that it positively amazes. The riffing from the hosts is some of the best, sharpest commentary they ever did. This is the first of three movies MST3K did from director Coleman Francis (who makes Ed Wood look like Orson Welles!). The second one, ""Red Zone Cuba"" is available on its own DVD. The third, ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" isn't out yet, and Rhino should really get this one on a future collection.
All four films are offered in ""non-MST3K"" versions on the flip side of their discs, which is a nice feature if you really want to see how much the show added to these awful films. ""Bloodlust"" and ""Catalina Caper"" are all right - although dull - on their own, but see how long you can sit through the other two without Mike and Robots before you tear your eyes out!
So there you have it, three of the most phenomenally funny episodes of MST3K, plus one of the most unusual. A great package for fans and newcomers alike! (Just watch out for acid in your parachute!)",1078099200,136,5018,4.684031710079275
1789686,5,B00006RJCL,"Interestingly enough, only one of the films here is actually a science fiction film. Here is a brief summery about each of the films mocked in this collection.
BLOODLUST-A modern-day (for 1961) re-telling of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" with teenagers. Two young couples on an ocean cruise make an unplanned stop when they come to an island. There they meet a British safari hunter and his own private army of obedient natives. They meet another couple there, and soon learn that thier host hunts not animals, but people. Although the commentary here is funny as always, I actually thought this was a pretty good movie on it's own, deserving of better than this type of mockery. But then again if it had never been picked up by MST3 I probably never would have found out about it.
CATALINA CAPER-Middle aged folks steal a piece of art from a museum and it's up to a group of beach bum teenagers to save the day. The film features not one but two rather obvious (and odeious) komic (not comic) relief characters: a dunder-headed thief (how'd a dope like him manage to steal the art without getting caught?) and a really clumsy F.B.I. agent who functions as a third-rate inspector Cluseou. (Well, O.K., the scene where he goes fishing and snags an unexpected catch was classic.) Still worth watching if only because of Mike and the 'bots and their ribbing.
THE CREEPING TERROR-The only science fiction film featured here, this one features little dialouge from the characters and mostly just from the narrator (go to imdb.com and look this film up, then click on trivia to see why this is) and has a lumbering alien that looks like a bunch of stitched-together carpets devouring people. In real life this monster couldn't catch any one capable of simply running away, since it, ahem, creeps along at about 4 miles per hour. The only reason it manages to eat so many people here is that nobody ever actually tries to run away, they just stand there and scream. (Perhaps they are the reletives of characters from 1980s slasher films who do dumb things like running up the stairs while trying to escape from the killer instead of out the door.) An easy movie to laugh at by itself, the commentary here is just icing on a cake.
SKYDIVERS-Pretty much what it says it's about. There is an evil plot that involves pouring acid into one of the parachutes. It's been awhile, so I don't remember much about this one.",1077062400,4,2401,4.665094339622642

The riffing is, as always, hilarious but the movie is horrendous. In addition the host segments rely on making fun of crow too much and that bothered me I guess. Of course by saying it's not agreat episode of mST I am saying that it is still darn funny, and funnier than many of the sitcoms on network tv. best line ""roger tower. Which way is the sky?""(2.5/5)
Catalina caper- This 60's beach movie romp feture Tommy Kirk and Lyle Waggoner, the plot involves a scroll stolen from a museum by a guy with a crayola hat. Also central to the plot are a group of young people (hereinafter the ""kids"")on vacation in Catalina. The crayola hat guy takes the scroll to his partners in crime a husband and wife who plan to copy the scroll then sell the copy to Dino Lacopolis a greek villain.

Anyway, the monster is opposed by a small-town sheriff, his deputy, a military man, and a scientist. They destroy the monsters but not before information is passed the the monsters' home planet.

1789688,4,B00006RJCL,"First of all, this is a fine and long overdue entry from Rhino. The price for these is steep, but if you're a MST fan, this is the best way to get them (aside from circulating the tapes, of course.)
The set features quirky, pop-up packaging that fits the nature of the series. The films themselves are fine selections - while none are ""Manos"" good, the set features a wide variety of genres. They're great for showing to someone who isn't familiar with the series:
Bloodlust: More in the Mad Scientist genre than anything else, ""Bloodlust"" features a crazed big game hunter/taxadermist who finds a group of Scoobyesque teens shipwrecked on his island. It's basically an hour-long setup for a 20 minute ""The Most Dangerous Game"" scene that never pays off. More enjoyable than the film itself is the preceding 15-minute short ""Uncle Jim's Dairy Farm"".
Catalina Caper: ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" meets ""Laugh-in"" in this kooky answer to 50s sexual repression. Probably the most fun film in the set, ""Catalina Caper"" features the hunt for a missing museum artwork, which quickly takes a backseat to vapid dance sequences. The brightest star is a guest spot by a young Little Richard - one which he surely denies today.
The Creeping Terror: Your standard Creature From Beyond Attacks Amorous Teens entry. The creature itself looks like a massive quilt, so viewers can never tell if he's devouring his victims or copulating with them. A campy b/w film made better by the SOL crew.
The Skydivers: Basically lots of skydiving footage woven together by an awkward plotline, ""The Skydivers"" features a mom-and-pop skydiving operation with numerous inexplicable love affairs going on. It's a really bad movie getting mocked really well - the best kind of MST.
A novel addition is the original set of films before they were MST3Ked, in case you want to have your own ""MST3K home version"", or just see them in their original format. Later volumes seem to have dropped this feature.
All said, this isn't going to be the last box set you'd ever want - it's called Volume 1 for a reason. With its wide variety of films, and the originals for home mockery however, it's a good sampling for the uninitiated, or just those nostalgiac for the glory days of Mystery Science Theater 3000.",1073779200,2,2261,4.829896907216495

However, Rhino is missing a great chance. First off, having acquired the rights to the movies, they feel compelled to include the original versions of all the movies on the other sides of the discs. That would be great as an extra, except that it limits the box sets to only four movies each. At that rate, the whole run will cost $1500-$2000! Moreover, there are no extras at all! How about more shorts? The Poopie? Making Ofs? Interviews? Commentary, for Chrissakes? Just look at The Simpsons box sets to see how it should be done. Oh, on top of all that, they're not starting at the beginning of Season One or even going in any chronological order at all. It's not even a Best Of based on anything. GRR!

""drama"" involving some skydivers, a love-triangle gone awry and lots of cups of coffee from the same guy who brought us Beast of Yucca Flats. A great selection for both the long-term MST3K fan or someone just wanting to check out the show for the first time. Catalina Caper is worth it alone, as this comes from the legendarily hilarious second season of the show; when you hear Tom Servo singing ""Creepy Girl"" you'll know why MST3K is possibly the funniest show ever to be on television.",1067904000,2,871,4.774834437086093
1789692,5,B00006RJCL,"If you want a prime example of what it means to be a ""cult classic"" television series, MST3K is it.  It even has a following that is very similar to Monty Python's Flying Circus.  The show is loved by so many people all over the country.  It was only a matter of time when we'd see some of these shows put into volume sets.  ""Mystery Science Theater 3000: Volume 1"" is an excellent set with some very funny shows.
Who would've thought that the perfect instruments of torture could be B movies?  Well, we quickly learn that this is possible with the show.  MST3K is all about a man (either Joel Hodgson or Mike Nelson) and his robots being forced to watch some of the worst movies ever created.  In the process, they wisecrack their way through every single one of them.  It is a talent to admire, as many of us can do the same thing; however, many of us cannot get the same hilarious results as these guys do.
The set includes the movies ""Bloodlust,"" ""Catalina Caper,"" ""The Creeping Terror,"" and ""The Skydivers.""  The best ones are ""Bloodlust"" and ""The Skydivers,"" as they are really lousy movies; meaning that the boys are able to come up with some hilarious lines and observations.  You also have the chance to see these films without the MST3K crew (why in the world would you want to subject yourself to that??!!).  Theatrical trailers for the movies are also available on the DVDs.
This is a wonderful show that is brilliantly clever and fresh.  It will always remain a favorite of mine, that's for sure.  ""Mystery Science Theater 3000: Volume 1"" is a treat to have and a joy to watch.  You'll be watching each episode over and over again.  A MUST for MST3K fans all around.",1063324800,3,1679,4.4769736842105265
1789693,4,B00006RJCL,"that really sums it up. These aren't the 4 best mst3k movies, but they'll still make you laugh.
Bloodlust stars Robert Reed(brady bunch dad) and not much else. Clincher is when the other guy gets refered to as the techie, and also complains that computer haven't been invented yet(the guy's a total nerd)
Sykdivers stars the sky in it's best performance yet.. and some people jumping out of planes. Once again the title of the film says it all. Don't expect a plot, just sky diveing. Somehow it's suppose to be a movie but feels more like a skydiving documentery. Clincher is the bar scene, which didn't fit into the moive.
Catalina Caper stars adults pretending to be kids, and of course creepy girl. Clincher is of course creepy girl song. It has a 60's Disney feel. yep it's lame.
The creeping Terror stars an alien with a long rug trailing behind it. This movie was so bad that before mst3k got it, it was overdubbed with a narrator, cause the acting is just that bad. Clincher is the dance scene. Ten minutes of a dance hall ends eventually with the creeping terror actually eating everyone, and not one person runs!! This is the best of the 4 movies.",1063324800,,1156,4.535885167464115
1789714,5,B00006RJCL,"MST3K is a kind of comedy that goes over well with people who know obscure underground culture like it was the current MTV pop-culture.  I find it hilarious and stimulating.
As for the episodes on this box, they are all classic depictions of what this show was all about.  If you've seen the show, you're a fan, unless you did not get it.  If not, that's too bad I must say.  The show really is brilliant.
The episodes here are mainly hosted by Mike with only one Joel episode.  The bots are super funny as always and the short about the summer farm trip is down right hysterical.
You owe it to yourself to check this out.  Even if you've never seen the show, I am sure you have sat through a movie in your own home and just made fun of it through the whole thing.  They just take the most self-entertaining concept and cleverly package it for all to enjoy.  So enjoy.",1059523200,3,868,4.25
1789715,5,B00006RJCL,"This is the first of the 4-episode collection sets, and it was a good hook for their other ones. Athought this is strangely the only one with the un-MSTed versions, you don't nessesarily need those (though ironicly, the worst movies ever made are now digitally mastered on DVDs...).
Anyway, on to the review section:
THE SKYDIVERS:
MADE BY: Coleman Francis (start snoring now)
If not the worst movie ever made, certainly the worst I've ever seen. Plot: Uh... there isn't one. If you must have one though, I guess you could say that it's ""the struggle to keep a make-shift sky diving school alive"", but even that's giving it too much credit. As this is part of the ""Coleman Francis Trilogy"", this should come as no suprise though. Continuity isn't there, niether is a script, nor is skydiving. To further add to this, you'll recognise the music from his other movies. Overall, this is just a horrible film that has no reason for existing. If I'd gone to see it in theaters, I'd've left 5 minutes in (maybe less).
MST3KED VERSION:
HOST: Mike
In my opinion, the funniest in the set. Even though this movie pretty much makes fun of itself, they find their ways to make it better. Every aspect of the film is mocked; the editing, acting, diolauge, and of course the film itself. The jokes come at a steady rate, and they are consistantly funny, provided you know the context (lots of past movie references, but those are in every episode). Simply stated, you have to experience it to find it funny, as with most things, it just can't be put into words. If I had a dollar for every time I laughed in this movie, I'd be able to pay off the national debt.
(I'll have to do them separately, I guess... I'll write those later.)",1051401600,,1717,4.541935483870968
1789716,5,B00006RJCL,"Whoever at Rhino decided to package these four MST episodes into one DVD collection did a really nice job, because they comprise an excellent cross-section of the show: one from the early years (I've said in other Amazon.com reviews that I think seasons 3 and 4 were probably the best of the show's entire run) plus some from the later Comedy Central years; bad horror films combined with a bad comedy film and one that's just, well, bad (how *would* you classify ""The Skydivers""? ""Drama"" doesn't seem like quite the right word.). If anything, the collection may be -- as one of the institutional reviews put it -- a little ""Mike-centric."" But the volume two collection balances this out by including two Joel-era episodes.
The magic of DVD technology brings many other interesting benefits to this collection, including complete, uncut versions of the original films without the benefit of ""Shadowrama"" technology. But the real value, of course, is far more in the MST riffing than in the films themselves. So pop up the popcorn and settle in for a long weekend of great entertainment. Even this many years after the show's final season, an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 is still really hard to beat.",1048464000,5,1211,4.883495145631068

I assume only Mistie fans will be reading this review anyway. I have to say the Creeping Terror is my fave out of this group. Truly horrifying, in the worst way, but also hysterical. I guess my favorite MST3Ks are when they watch old sci-fi.  Also there are no extras whatsoever on the DVDS. Clearly Rhino doesnt want to spend any more money than they have too since only fans would want to buy it and they would buy it regardless of any extra bonus material.

While these shows aren't quite the classics that volume 2 contains, there are still some wonderful moments here. The Little Richard song in Catalina Caper is a hilarious string of barbs and wisecracks that is, to me, the highlight of that episode. Skydivers is one of the few Roger Corman flicks that's actually watchable - with the mst3k gang helping. I've only made it through the Red Zone Cuba episode once, and I can actually sit through this one. The Creeping Terror is enjoyable just for watching the sheer lack of terror the movie inspires. About the weakest episode here was Bloodlust. Seeing a member of the Brady Bunch cast in that tight of a shirt is just about too much to bear....",1045094400,,940,4.808641975308642

Don't get me wrong, there's some good stuff here, but you'd think they'dve chosen some of their best stuff and I don't know who chose these but this is not their best stuff.  Good, but by no means among their best.  How 'bout 'Space Mutany', 'Leech Woman', 'Parts: The Clonus Horror', and 'Time Chasers?  Honestly, who chose these episodes?  Did they even bother to poll their fans?  I wouldn't recommend this OR tell anyone to save their money.  It was so-so.",1042675200,3,579,4.490384615384615

Secondly, the packaging is fun and stellar. I will enjoy collecting the rest of these volumes as they begin to hit the shelves. The discs are double-sided, with ""MST-ied"" versions on side A and the original films in tact on the B side. You'll probably never want to watch the B side, but it's still great to own and was probably a condition of securing the rights to reprint and make a mockery of these movies. The other feature is an original theatrical trailer included for each of the films.
Thirdly, the content. While these certainly aren't the classic episodes that are frequently mentioned in all of MST3K lore (nothing on here quite reaches the level of ""Manos, Hands of Fate"" or ""Mitchell""), they are absolutely hilarious and a must-own for any fan. For instance, in ""The Skydivers"", a man is offered a cup of coffee. He curtly replies, ""I like coffee."" MST3K host Mike Nelson casually quips, ""Thus we peer into the complexity of the character that is Joe.""

7972734,5,B00006RJCL,"""The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Collection"" volume one is a great set featuring three classic episodes and ""Bloodlust"". Three of the shows are Mike Nelson episodes, while Joel Hodgson is at the helm for the viewer favorite ""Catalina Caper"". This is a strong outing overall, though ""Bloodlust"" is (yet another) ""Most Dangerous Game"" knockoff that despite great riffing never fails to bore (although Robert Reed as the hero gets some laughs).

""Catalina Caper"" is not one of my favorite films, but has great jokes. I tend to like the ridiculous sci-fi films the most, but despite that the hilarious presence of Little Richard and Tommy Kirk in a light comedy-mystery-action picture about a ridiculous theft and parental scamming makes for mirthful mayhem. ""The Skydivers"" is a classic featuring some of the worst acting in the history of MST3K, mostly from Tony Cardoza, the auteur and star of the show. It's essentially a love triangle meets freefalling odyssey type of film (in a genre of one, I believe) that has the same high production values as ""Red Zone Cuba"", also starring Cardoza in another incoherent film featuring small planes. I actually think ""Red Zone Cuba"" is the better of the two movies, but you should check out both in their MST3K guise and compare for yourself.

Finally, this set features one of my favorites, ""The Creeping Terror"", the infamous giant carpet monster from space movie starring, directed, and produced by antisocial misfit Vic Savage (A. J. Nelson) at the Spahn Ranch (you know, where the Manson Family lived....) ""The Creeping Terror"" is an amazing film in any context: wholly narrated with some badly looped dialogue, terrible monsters and sets, and acting that would make Harold P. Warren blanch. It is absolutely perfect MST3K fodder and is worth the price of the set by itself.

Note that this set has now been released by Shout Factory and is available more cheaply in that packaging which has the bonus of numerous special features, which are particularly noteworthy on ""The Creeping Terror"" DVD. This is an outstanding MST3K set, and I recommend it without hesitation.",1441929600,,2114,5.017094017094017

7972737,5,B00006RJCL,"""The Creeping Terror,"" a terrible micro-budget 1964 movie produced, directed, and edited by its lead actor, Vic Savage, reaches depths of incoherence, cheapness, and cinematic incompetence worthy of Ed Wood. It's so unintentionally hilarious that it barely needs the MST3K treatment, but I'm happy to have it; Mike and the 'bots hit this one out of the ballpark with one of the show's funniest barrages of riffs, ever, and that's while barely acknowledging the director's undisguised foot and leg fetishism. This is an episode for the ages.

""The Skydivers"" (1963), the second film in the infamous Coleman Francis trilogy, is a bizarre melodrama about an extramarital affair that leads to murder, without anything actually happening onscreen. Like ""The Creeping Terror,"" it's a Mike-era masterpiece of savage riffing, but ""Skydivers"" reminds me more of a Daniel Clowes fever dream than of anything else in the history of cinema. It's unwatchable, but unmissable.

After that, the Joel-era episode ""Catalina Caper"" (1967) and season six's ""Bloodlust!"" (1959) are disappointing by comparison. ""Catalina Caper"" is a beach party crime comedy with the anodyne Tommy Kirk, a musical number by the high-as-a-kite Little Richard, and the unfunny pratfalls of Robert Donner and Jim Begg. ""Bloodlust!"" is Shaggy, Fred, Daphne and Velma in a ridiculous version of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" that substitutes shock effects (boiled heads, etc.) for suspense.",1428364800,,1444,5.441964285714286
