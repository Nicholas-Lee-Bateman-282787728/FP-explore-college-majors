5667879,5,B00BQXTCYK,"Comparisons to Vexed Series 1 are inevitable, and to my mind Series 2 comes out on top.

We started watching Vexed because of Lucy Punch (whom we loved in Doc Martin), but really her character in Vexed seemed kind of world-weary and with issues of her own.  On the other hand, Jack and George really offset each other to bring out the humor.  George's issues are more about her own sense of perfectionism, which works better for a comedy.  She manages to make Jack seem more of a lovable doofus whereas in Series 1 he sometimes seemed more like a jerk.  George and Jack get into some very funny situations, and it's really peripheral that they are solving crimes.  Toby Stephens and Miranda Raison have great chemistry.  I hope they work together again.

Both seasons are recommended, but Series 2 is the maraschino cherry and umbrella on the cocktail.",1370304000,8,852,4.671140939597316
5667880,5,B00BQXTCYK,"the accent is on humor in this series so you must go into it realizing that the humor comes in over any other aspect. it is hard to decide which episode is the funniest one here. there is the one with jack infiltrating a college clique of hard core lesbians in a woman studies program which is hilarious.  yet georgina's becoming a contestant on a top chef like show was equally funny. they also both have experiences in dating, all of which prove to be ultimately disastrous in a hilarious way.  georgina finds a gorgeous guy who is a martha stewart wannabee around the house and thus drives her crazy.  jack's choices are even funnier.  my favorite was the girlfriend who was much more macho than he was.  he pooh poohed this aspect for the whole episode but by the final scene is sinking deep into his bar stool in mortification.  priceless!  if you need a pick me up, this is the show to do it.

5667881,5,B00BQXTCYK,"FUNNY! London's NEW crime cops turn homicide into humor. Sarcasm abounds even around corpses. You'll LOVE them. Witty, this buxom blonde and arrogant stud keep laughs rolling like stand-ups. Uniquely bi-genre TV crime. LOL. As George says, ""SFETE"", smiles from ear to ear.

Toby Stephens plays DI Jack Armstrong (Jane Eyre), flirt, food-babe-manic cop who commonly borders on `jerk' or `slug.' His new partner is `George', DI Georgina Dixon (Miranda Raison- MI-5), foxy, intelligent, blonde, usually a step ahead of Jack. 2 more back from Series 1 are forensic Naz (Ronny Jhutti) and Caf&eacute;-Bar owner Tony (Roger Griffiths).
SDH SUBTITLES
for all hr-length episodes. Series One's excellence prompted this new series, but lead star Stephens has moved on to a new series scheduled for 2014.

Episode 1: Jack & George look at a salesman corpse found in a car trunk while he also hits on his new cop-partner. Oops. Then he's attracted to a sexy car saleswoman. She's suspect, like manager Dave (Christopher Fulford), receptionist, & a sales rival. Richard Numsden also guest stars.
...2: A library death sends the duo undercover in a post-genderism caper. Both find significant others. Scot Williams (Lillies) guest stars as Prof. Westlake.
...3: Demoted to Missing Persons thanks to Jack, the pair looks into missing attorney found dead leading the wayward duo to undercover work at a gym. Cop work & working out conflict. George's dad (Nick Dunning) appears in the first of 3 episodes.
...4: Cookery show contestant is found dead. Jack uses George's recipes to thrill his hot new gal. George goes undercover on TV to turn up the heat on a mur4der suspect. TV show host Chef Randell played by Brian McCardie.
...5: Headmaster stabbed by knitting needle. Can Jack knit together a case involving kids? Jack gets close with a hot knitting mom. George's parents' divorcing causes more diversion.
...6: Armed robbery at a jewelry but owner Poynter (Philip Davis- `Bleak House') wants no cops. Tony provides a lead. What's romantic? Bro's wedding? Diamonds? 615 e-date emails? Funny partner bickering to the end, but can it be the forever final of this great comedy-cop partnership?

I want more, even if it means new starring performers. Crime plots not as developed as some, but the humor makes this series delightful.
If you've not seen the first series, you'll want to. The female lead in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vexed/dp/B008KEQLZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vexed</a>, series one, is DI Kate Bishop (Lucy Punch). Just as murderously funny.",1367020800,3,2592,5.348039215686274
5667882,4,B00BQXTCYK,"If the first season brought you here, you will be delighted to know that Jack is as clueless and self-absorbed as ever (and we are the better for it).

But the second season opener threatens to take that away from us, as Jack seems more tame (though not too tame to turn a murder into a car-shopping opportunity)--though then the season settles down for all the outrageous quips and preposterous situations you watch this for, all in the name of British crime fighting.  So be patient.  After the slow season opener, you get five follow-on episodes of great fun.

Season two mixes up the show a bit--a new partner (Miranda Raison), who gets her share of screen time, and an occasional foray into situations other than murder.  And first episode aside, the season is stronger for her addition.  Raison is a more rounded character, and she hold her own on screen.

The rest of the fine ensemble cast is intact.  So if you loved the first season, there is twice as much to love here.  Enjoy!",1365292800,22,988,4.568181818181818

5667897,2,B00BQXTCYK,"A semi-comic detective series that seems to be aimed at young viewers more interested in sexual tension and romance than in an old-fashioned police procedural. The acting is good. The scripts bear no relation whatsoever to actual police work, and I guess I am just too old to be interested in the love life of two thirty-something detectives.

Don't take my word for it. Watch both seasons. You'll learn that Jack ""Toby Stephens"" can't carry the series by himself. In Season One he was a very funny D bag. But critical to making his character work was the presence of Lucy Punch to ridicule him....

Season Two, he's the same D bag but not nearly as funny and I think what's missing is Lucy's Character, ""Kate"" to make fun of all the stupid things he says and does..

The chemistry is just not there and I was very put off by George's constant put-downs of Jack.  I think it needs a more equal give and take.  Probably won't buy a Series 3, if there is one.",1372636800,3,316,4.131147540983607

5668011,3,B00BQXTCYK,"The first season of Vexed was awesome. The black humour was superb and the acting on target. Season two alas has lost something of that sparkle.

Lucy Punch has gone to be replaced by Miranda and her loss is keenly felt. Lucy's character was as brilliantly flawed in her own way as Toby's Jack. And she was also wonderfully strident in her criticism of Jack. But her replacement although some attempts are made to give her a set of flaws, ends up mostly just being a rather flat foil for her partner Jack's insensitive, sexist, racist (and just about everything else ist), barbs. This wouldn't be such a terrible thing save that the writers have also tamed Jack. He's in danger of losing his flamboyant boyish edginess to become just another detective with a jaundiced world view.

Still there are some good moments and if you skip the first episode it does get better. Also in season two there are six episodes instead of three which is a plus. There are no extras on the discs though save a few screenshots.

Overall it's a reasonable watch and I give it three stars. I'm not sure if I might have given it a little more save that it follows on from the truly wicked first season and my expectations were dashed a little.",1371168000,8,1222,4.495495495495495
5668012,3,B00BQXTCYK,"In 2012 I discovered this BBC detective series from Acorn Video because I loved their nine seasons of ""New Tricks"". The first season of Vexed was short  - just three hour-long episodes - and I really liked it. I wasn't as thrilled with the main male character (played by Toby Stephens) but enjoyed his distaff detective partner portrayed by actress Lucy Punch. As I noted in my review then, I learned that the series had been renewed and was looking forward to more of the same.
When I got Season Two - which now contains SIX episodes - I noted a new female face on the front of the package. This wasn't Ms. Punch.  But - what the heck - I started watching it anyway. The first episode was okay as we learned a little bit about Stephens new partner and how their relationship might work. But by the time we get to the second episode (which all revolves around character who have ""gender issues"", I was getting antsy. While the British treat sex themes more open than American broadcast channels (and I love a good dirty joke), the jokes seemed more appropriate for burlesque house. Think Benny Hill. Breast jokes, toilet jokes etc. This was not what Season One was about. They actually worked on cases you might care about. And Stephen's is even more over the top this time, while I just couldn't figure out Stephens' new partner, Georgina, (played by Miranda Raison).  I plodded through the rest of the season but it didn't improve much for me.
Now, I do see that other reviewers thought that this season was better and funnier. Remembering that humor  is subjective, I'll say that maybe to some, it was better. Not for me, however.  So, I can only offer the OBJECTIVE comment that Season Two is, well, different. You just might like it. But don't go looking for any crime cases to solve here. It's all about the ""detectives""
If there is a Season Three, I hope they recapture the feeling of the first one.
Unlike Season One, where there was a short ""making of"" feature, this time there is only a photo gallery as a bonus.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8572890,3,B00BQXTCYK,"Season 1 with Lucy Punch packed, well.... A punch. I have been a big fan of hers since Kingdom, Hot Fuzz, etc. Her comedic timingbis flawless. Have enjoyed Toby's career as well.  Was disappointed to see her character gone in season 2 but gave,l it a  fair chance. Watchable? Yes. In a tepid sort of way when one goes to a restaurant, has a few great meals, looks forward to returning under new management and food feels like day-old buffet. Miranda may be a good actress but the crispiness in reparte is lacking, less chemistry, meh... Perhaps writing has changed, but I doubt it. At the end of the day it is still the actors who need to pull off the silly, exaggerated plots and antics which are the foundation of this show. It is not a gritty police drama.",1521763200,,759,4.414285714285715
8572891,4,B00BQXTCYK,I think Miranda Raison had better rapport with Toby Stephens than Lucy Punch. I was intensely fascinated by her character. I wished they renewed it for a third season.,1496880000,,167,4.793103448275862
8572892,3,B00BQXTCYK,"Seasons 1 and 2:

 Show starts out great with clever, dry humor and excellent rapport between two quirky main characters.  Each successive episode goes downhill until we are watching a trite, unimaginative sitcom with the pathetic crutches of vulgarity, obscenity and cheap sex.  What began as an exceptional show becomes dull and stupid.

 Episode 1 of Season 1 is top notch, quality British wit and drama.  Watch it for sure, and then be ready to quit along the line.",1492992000,,469,4.860759493670886
