8152911,2,B000JRYOYC,"Watched this movie on Lifetime TV when I was sick with the flu and stuck in bed all day.  Pretty corny and terrible, and the women's fashion was unbearable. What I DID like was the version of ""Yellow Rose of Texas"" which kept playing intermittently throughout the movie. Wish I knew who the artist was.  Can't find it anywhere. Was hoping I would see it on this CD cover, but it's not worth buying it just to find out.",1377907200,,418,4.2784810126582276
8152912,4,B000JRYOYC,The DVD is just fine considering it was used and takes you way back to the big hair and big oil and big cars and big accents that are slowly disappearing in big cities inTexas.,1355616000,,176,4.057142857142857
