4329202,5,B004CWLRL8,"We enjoyed very much. Good acting and great scenery much better than a lot of the stuff we see on our tv in the
States",1358726400,,118,3.76
4329203,5,B004CWLRL8,"This series is excellent. Once you get over the the subtitles issue. Henning Mankell's story telling is superb.
This Wallander Series is frankly better than the Masterpiece ones.",1352073600,,178,5.392857142857143
4329204,5,B004CWLRL8,"I've seen all of these and have thoroughly enjoyed the acting, character development, and the stories. I've read some of the books and found these DVDs have enhanced my appreciation of the books.",1345852800,2,195,4.9393939393939394
4329205,5,B004CWLRL8,"Here is what I wrote for other films in this series; it holds true for these too.

I love the author Henning Mankell and very much enjoyed Kenneth Branaugh's film versions of some of Mankell's mysteries. Just recently, I obtained these Swedish films of Mankell stories. I highly recommend them to anyone who enjoys well done mysteries and who does not have a thing about subtitles.",1304899200,2,381,4.7727272727272725
4329206,5,B004CWLRL8,"I can't get enough of this Wallander series.  Love everthing about it.  The actors are ""real"" and the locations are breath-taking.  I much prefer the Swedish version to the British one, although I also watch Branaugh as well.  I just wish the Swedish versions would come out in region I format quicker.  I know some cast members will change in future editions, but Krister Henriksson is the absolute best Wallander ever! I look forward to more of him.",1303430400,22,451,4.730769230769231
4329207,5,B004CWLRL8,"everything is perfect, the plots, casting, scenery, music and photography- a feast for a real film lover of mysteries and film noir. Each segment is different and often echoes real life of the cast... for example of Joanna's battle with depression. I can not say enough of this entire series and eagerly await to see the next series.. although Joanna, Ola and Angela will be gone from the original cast. Brannagh's interpretation and series is much inferior in comparison.",1302739200,11,472,4.987341772151899
4329208,5,B004CWLRL8,"The Wallander series, starring Krister Henriksen, is simply first - rate.  Though not taken directly from any of Menkel's novels, each episode is well written and directed and superbly acted.  This is television as it should be.",1302134400,16,228,5.135135135135135
4329209,5,B004CWLRL8,"The last four episodes of Season One are excellent.  ""The Secret"" and ""The Black King"" are my favorites along with ""Mastermind"" earlier from the season.  Several main characters in these episodes deal with demons from their past.  I have yet to watch Seasons Two & Three, but the already known absence of a few of the main actors/characters from Season One will be sorely missed.

Spoiler alert--One thing though is to make sure and watch them in sequencial order. I skipped over the middle two episodes to watch ""The Secret"" and wish I had not.  Very sad and disturbing way to end the first season.",1420761600,2,599,4.666666666666667
4329210,4,B004CWLRL8,"As advertised, good product, just wish they had an option for English sound track.",1416268800,,82,4.928571428571429
4329211,5,B004CWLRL8,This is basic DVD information. The region 1 release of the first season of the original Swedish Wallander was done in installment sets. This is the 4th and final set of Season 1.,1413763200,,178,4.424242424242424
4329212,5,B004CWLRL8,"Watched all 32episodes an want to start,and watch them all again,Wallander joins my hero list to stand level with Frost!!!",1410652800,,122,5.15
4329213,5,B004CWLRL8,great series,1409184000,,12,5.5
4329214,4,B004CWLRL8,"By better, I mean that what's-his-name in that British version just does not cut it.  And that is that. period.",1399939200,,111,4.55
4329215,5,B004CWLRL8,This series is absolutely excellent. I would recommend it to anyone that likes detective mysteries as long as you don't mind the subtitles. Fantastic purchase!,1398297600,,159,5.4
4329216,5,B004CWLRL8,Great Series. Enjoyed it very much,1397952000,,34,4.833333333333333
4329217,5,B004CWLRL8,Sorry Kenneth Branaugh- this Wallender is by far the best- you play him too dour- this Swede is so good you forget he's acting. Alas Amazin carries only this one season (13 episodes- each one superb). More please!,1392768000,,213,4.631578947368421
4329218,3,B004CWLRL8,"This set of episodes seems to have begun the slide into the Hollywood style more and more... Especially ""The Secret"", but without giving away spoilers, there were gaping holes in the plot throughout and decidedly uncop-like behaviors that suddenly appear in the characters. Too bad... 3.5 stars",1377648000,,294,5.276595744680851
4329219,5,B004CWLRL8,"I love this series, but for some reason the third DVD out of the 3 in this pack will not play the last chapter of the first show. The DVD player just locks up and freezes. Tried two DVD players and a MacBook with same results.

I returned the first package and got a replacement and the same problem occurred in the same place.

Both the problem DVDs have visible damage on the silver pressing, below the acrylic outer surface. It must be a production fault.

I returned the second pack and gave up.",1375660800,4,499,4.287234042553192
4329220,5,B004CWLRL8,I have followed the exciting and sometimes grim adventures of Wallander and his daughter in all the shows and continue to enjoy this fascinating portrayal of Swedish society. As a Danish-American I am familiar with much of the scenery in Southwestern Sweden and can relate to many of the events.,1373587200,,295,4.92
4329221,5,B004CWLRL8,"actors,scenes,story and direction are all superb...cant wait for more,we have begun watching other Scando films as well,Danish too are beaut",1372636800,,140,6.05
4329222,5,B004CWLRL8,"If you like police stories, detectives that solves crimes.
Wallander is one of the best.
If you like the Swedish style of detectives, Wallander and Beck, is the way to go.",1371600000,,171,4.548387096774194
4329223,5,B004CWLRL8,And as luck would have it they are making a few more here in  2013 oh boy can't wait. All are good. This ver is great.,1365638400,,118,3.5384615384615383
4329224,5,B004CWLRL8,"I was somewhat concerned that the quality of the DVD might be poor but it was excellent.  The episodes were high quality as well and while I'm a fan of Kenneth Branaugh, I enjoy these programs produced in Sweden, in Swedish, better than the English language episodes.",1364083200,2,267,4.680851063829787
4329225,5,B004CWLRL8,"My favorite series. I will watch this over and over. The direction of this series is excellent. The characters become real, so needless to say, the acting is superb. The photography is remarkable. The best I have seen in a foreign film. The subtitles are not a problem. The sound and film quality pose no problems at all.
The item was well packaged and arrived in several days. I have ordered others as gifts. I wish everyone who likes ""who done its"" will purchase this entire series for the good price.
Enjoy",1363910400,,509,4.543478260869565
4329226,5,B004CWLRL8,I've come to love the Swedish Mysteries/Procedurals.  They are on the whole grittier and more believable than the typical US product.,1362009600,,133,5.333333333333333
4329227,5,B004CWLRL8,Hated to have this series end and may have to go back to Netflix to re-view season two. Have to get my hands on season3!!!,1360022400,,122,3.92
4329228,5,B004CWLRL8,this is as good as it gets.  I think this is one of the best detective police series I have ever seen.  Swedish version with subtitles.  I did not enjoy the English production anywhere near as well.,1359590400,,198,4.297297297297297
8423666,5,B004CWLRL8,The first season is outstanding.  All the episodes are good.,1520985600,,60,5.0
8423667,5,B004CWLRL8,"What a great show! Love the writing, love the acting. Even dealt with subtitles and did not miss a thing! Wish there had been a 4th season....",1510099200,,142,4.296296296296297
8423668,5,B004CWLRL8,"Really pretty good even with the subtitles, but kinda dark, not many light moods in these.",1484611200,,90,4.6875
8423669,5,B004CWLRL8,So happy to have all of season 1 great series,1478908800,,45,3.6
8423670,5,B004CWLRL8,Excellent production,1477958400,,20,9.5
8423671,5,B004CWLRL8,"This is one of the best-written cop/detective series ever.  If you are into Scandinavian travel or culture, you'll love this.  We've actually visited Ystad, Sweden, where this was filmed, and stayed in the police station building (which was a train station but is now converted to a B&B).",1477267200,,288,4.979166666666667
8423672,5,B004CWLRL8,"Though the British version with Kenneth Branaugh was okay, the later one with Swedish performers and dialogue was better.

Why?  Things tend to get lost in translation, and it seemed that the British version was Anglicized somehow, despite being filmed on location in Sweden.  Also the story seems more substantial, and Wallander a stronger character emotionally than as played in the older version.  We needed the subtitles in either version anyway.

But best of all, the awful theme music that was in the British version is refreshingly absent in the Swedish one.",1448928000,,565,5.0978260869565215
8423673,5,B004CWLRL8,I love this Swedish Wallander,1447804800,,29,5.0
8423674,5,B004CWLRL8,"Well worth reading the subtitles, I am an avid Mankell/Wallendar fan. Like the fact that these episodes do not follow the books, that was done by the BBC on PBS. So these are new",1440460800,,178,4.264705882352941
8423675,5,B004CWLRL8,"Excellent production, acting, setting, all top caliber.",1420761600,,55,7.0
