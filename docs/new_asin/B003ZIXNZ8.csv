8410384,1,B003ZIXNZ8,"The Cursed (Joel Bender, 2010)

You are The Cursed, if you unsuspectingly rent this looking for anything approaching a decent movie. Let me guess: you got sucked in by a couple of names that may have been big in the early nineties, James Marshall (Twin Peaks) and Costas Mandylor (Picket Fences), as well as Louis Mandylor, little brother of Costas, last seen by anything approaching a crowd in My Big Fat Greek Wedding. I warn you, folks, Louis Mandylor's name on a movie is like other big-name siblings like Frank Stallone, Clint Howard, or the ever-popular Joe Estevez. You see that name, and you should flee screaming in terror.

Plot: Denny White (Kickboxer 4's Brad Thornton) is headed back to the old homestead to get away from the big city and concentrate on writing a book about local folklore. He hooks up with his old pal Bill (Marshall) for a place to stay. While doing research he runs into hot librarian Sara (Rush Hour 3's Francesca Cecil), and the two of them strike up a relationship. But not long after Denny came to town, something started killing the local livestock, and Sheriff Lloyd (Louis Mandylor) and his retired-sheriff older brother Jimmy (Costas) think those two things may be related...

Of course they are, in the insanely-twisted-around goofy way common to horror movies like this. You probably knew that from reading the jacket copy. (If you didn't, sorry, but come on, you've seen more than three horror films in your life, right?) I'm not saying that treading the well-worn paths of the horror genre automatically means there's no life left in a movie; it can be done enjoyably time and again, and has been on a number of occasions recently (The House of the Devil springs to mind immediately). But anything that could have possibly made this enjoyable is leached out by a cast that ranges from competent-on-their-best-day (and this was no one's best day; ah, James Marshall, what I wouldn't give to see you in another movie as good as Gladiator) to flat-out awful, Bender directs like a guy whose biggest previous job was Sweet Valley High: The TV Series (and surprise, surprise, it was), Martin Watson was writing his first script and it shows... you get the idea. There is very, very little to recommend this other than to say ""it's better than the recent It's Alive remake"". Which ain't saying much. *",1363824000,,2340,4.787128712871287

8410386,3,B003ZIXNZ8,"Although ""The Cursed"" was shot in 2007 it wasn't released until early 2010 on Syfy.

THE PLOT: A writer (Brad Thornton) comes to a small Tennessee town to complete a book and strange things start happening - animals and people mysteriously disappear or are slaughtered. He hooks up with a good-looking librarian (Francesca Cecil) and they trace the problem to a satanic curse from the post-Civil War era. Meanwhile the sheriff (Louis Mandylor) is at his wits end trying to figure out what's going on and increasingly suspects the writer's involvement.

Although this is a low-budget, independent film it's considerably better than Syfy's usual fare, e.g. ""Gatorade vs. Mega-Cleavage."" How so? For one, it maintains a serious vibe, which is important in an age when most mystery/horror films belong in the comedy section. Secondly, the film creates a mysterious ambiance throughout, akin to ""The Fog"" but with a Stephen King plot minus the cartoony characters.

Speaking of the atmosphere, I really liked how you can hear the distinctive Eastern forest sounds, like the crickets and peepers, etc. I realize it's odd to point this out but the movie did this better than any that I can remember. The film was shot in McMinnville, Tennessee, by the way (and it's nice to see a film of this ilk shot somewhere other than Bulgaria, Romania or British Columbia).

Another positive is the monster's appearance, particularly when it opens its mouth (when it's closed it doesn't look very impressive).

Negatives include too much obvious dubbing and plot elements that simply don't make sense (why would the killer of the demon become the monster? And how would the old black guy know this with any certainty?); in addition, I disapprove of two important people biting the dust and the very end is lame.

FINAL WORD: Although it's nothing to get overly excited about, ""The Cursed"" is effective for a TV horror film. The filmmakers and actors take the material seriously and the film evokes a cool creepy atmosphere, but the negatives cited above force me to give it a fairly mediocre rating or ""almost good"".

8410387,3,B003ZIXNZ8,"The plot is a little sketchy in this made-for-TV movie; there are some real gaps. The ""supernatural"" killer is fairly typical, although the blurriness and darkness that surround him is a nice touch. The acting is overdone a tad, especially by the actor who plays the sheriff. To be honest, the best part of the movie is Brad Thornton. The man's a pretty good actor, has a great sensitive face, and a great body. He's the best part of the movie, especially for those 10 or 15 seconds (twice) near the end of the film when he is shirtless. No, I obviously have no shame!
