6383983,5,B00JPFTS2M,"The storyline had a lot of issues that are going on in the world today with families. Some folks may be a little scared of issues like molestation, prescription drug abuse,  falling out of love with your spouse, child abuse,  jealousy and hatred in the family and other things that happens in the family that people don't want to talk about. BRAVO LIFETIME. I really think if they made this a movie for theaters it would've been a cult classic.  It reminded me of the movie ""Soul Food"". You must have this movie in your collection. I will be buying it myself. My 80 y/o mother loved it and that's saying a lot coming from her. Thnx for reading my review and be blessed.",1405123200,45,669,4.379032258064516
6383984,1,B00JPFTS2M,"One of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while.  Someone was evidently trying to set a record for the number of dysfunctional issues and problems shoved into a single script.  Every screaming match was met with ever diminishing returns and by the end of the movie, given how many screaming matches there were, the return was basically nonexistent.  Some of the arguing became comical, which I doubt was the effect the director was going for.  I have read some viewers praised the acting in this muckfest.  I hate to break it to you, but being asked to do little more than scream and act like a$%h*&%s is not that demanding.  And Whoopi Goldberg can do a better job of faking a death than that.  That was pitiful.",1404950400,,718,4.476923076923077
6383985,3,B00JPFTS2M,"""There's a whole lot of mess I have to clean up before I go."" Viola (Goldberg) is the matriarch of a family that has fallen apart. Her kids all hate each other, the husband has found a new woman and no one likes her anymore. After a health scare she is given news that changes her life. On the verge of death she decides it time to fix her family before it's too late. I will start with...yes this is a Lifetime movie, I am a guy, I actually did enjoy it. That said though it was a little too sappy for me. I think, like most movies lately, when another movie that is about the same thing comes out comparisons begin. This one is very much like August Osage County in plot and theme. While this movie was good and worth seeing August was so much better. Seeing that one first may have affected how I felt about this one but August had deeper relationships and just felt like a more complete movie. It may have been because it was a made-for-TV movie but this felt really thin compared to the other one. All that said though the movie is good and if you haven't seen August then you may like this more then I did. Overall, a good movie worth seeing but once again a movie suffers from being too identical to a recent movie. I give this a B-.",1402531200,,1240,4.128099173553719
6383986,4,B00JPFTS2M,I love this movie because it showed many issues families today and in the past are going through.  It also speaks of the love and grace a mother has for her family no matter how they behave. I recommend this movie to whoever wishes to see a great family emotional film.,1401148800,10,269,4.2745098039215685
6383987,5,B00JPFTS2M,"I don't know why this did not come to the movies, it has a great cast.  This is a story any mother would love.  I am a true Terry McMillian fan. I have read all her books and watch all the movies that where made from her books, I can relate to all of them.  I am buying this movie for myself and for my mom.  I have watched it 3 times already.  Great movie,  great story line.  A must see!!! My husband also enjoyed it and agrees with me, should have came to the movies.  I am glad I don't have to wait to order it.",1398902400,24,515,3.7476635514018692
6383988,5,B00JPFTS2M,"I watched this movie on Lifetime. After my sister told me it was going to air, I kept checking the tv listings to see if the date was showing on the menu yet. I couldn't wait to set my dvr.

The Lifetime movie: A Day Late and a Dollar Short is based on the 2001 novel by Terry McMillan. I have read some of her work, but I didn't read this book. That did not stop me from wanting to watch the movie. The books I've read had humor so I expected to laugh as I watched this movie and I did laugh. I also had to shake my head at the choices some of the characters made. This movie certainly shows that nobody is perfect. It also shows how one person's imperfections can destroy another person's life. There was one part that made me angry and also made me want to cry. I usually can see that type of thing coming in a movie or book but I was so shocked.

What Paris (Anika Noni Rose) and Shanice (Shanice Banton) were going through. What Viola (Whoopi Goldberg) had to put up with. All of the issues being dealt with. The dysfunction. The mistakes. The hard lessons. The ending. This was an emotional movie viewing experience.

Great cast: Whoopi Goldberg, Ving Rhames, Anika Noni Rose, Mekhi Phifer, Kimberly Elise, Tichina Arnold and Lyriq Bent are all highly skilled actors. I wasn't familiar with the younger actors, but they did a good job. I'd like to see Shanice Banton more often.",1398038400,28,1384,4.315384615384615

6384627,5,B00JPFTS2M,So my roommate introduced me to this movie this past Summer. And I have watched this about 5x's (that is how much I love this movie). To the creator and Mastermind of this film thank you! This film has opened my eyes to a lot of things that go on within African American Families that are left unsaid.  In this film Whoopi played the mother who had realized that she had made some poor decision making as both a mother and a wife. Throughout the film she finds out that she don't have much longer to live so she tries to bring her children together so that she can tell them at once but as usual that did not happen. Moreover I LOVED LOVED LOVED this film and I encourage families to watch this movie. It can possibly help a dying family.,1413244800,12,738,4.197183098591549
6384628,4,B00JPFTS2M,Of course the book is much better....but the movie was great!,1413158400,,61,4.636363636363637
6384629,5,B00JPFTS2M,Love this movie.  It is funny and so what sad.  Overall very good movie.,1413072000,,72,4.071428571428571
6384630,5,B00JPFTS2M,This movie should have made it to the big screens... It was based on some real issues within family's. I absolutely loved it from beginning to the end!!! Great story line & great actors.,1413072000,,186,4.5
6384631,5,B00JPFTS2M,I laughed and cried.  I never cared for Whoopi as an actress but she did well as well as fellow cast members.  I have loaned this out to others and they  loved it as well.,1413072000,2,171,3.8285714285714287
6384632,5,B00JPFTS2M,"I'm a big fan of Whoopi, but not necessarily some of the movies or movie rolls that she has catered to over the years.  For sure, Whoopi is naturally funny--but I simply adore what she can do on a serious note (i.e., ""Law and Order: Criminal Intent"" episode.  I've seen this episode twice--and I still shudder at Whoopi's performance.).  Comedians like Whoopi, Robin & Richard are the perfect poster children for heavy (bone marrow) drama.  Kudos to Terry McMillan--and welcome back!  The characters are well thought out; the script is intelligent, smartly funnycomplex, but clear.  The letter reading scene is heart-wrenching and most effective.  Bravo and thank you to Tichina, Anika, Kimberly and Mekhiand Ving!  I do hope Miss McMillan can find her way to do the sequel of ""Waiting to Exhale.""  Because, Terrygirrrrl, you know you can work a conversation between characters.",1412899200,10,878,5.083916083916084

6384674,4,B00JPFTS2M,"Great movie that chronicles family relationship dynamics. Both Ving Rhames and Whoopi Goldberg give great performances and the supporting cast is quite strong too. The relationships are real, not contrived or ""made for Hollywood"". They represent a typical American family and prove that ""life"" happens to everyone. Emotions range from Oscar-winning funny to believably horrific. If one of the characters doesn't appear to represent you or someone in your family...check again!",1409788800,3,476,5.71830985915493

6384710,5,B00JPFTS2M,"This was a movie based on the book by the same title by Terry McMillan, and for the most part, it stuck to it.  Whoopi's character has a husband who has moved on from her to a younger woman with kids, her daughters are at each other's throats, and her son can't seem to keep it together long enough to stay out of jail.  All she want to do is make them come together long enough to settle their issues, because she feels like the next asthma attack will kill her.  In the end, they did come together,but not until all Hell breaks loose.  Sometimes, things must fall apart before they can be put back together again, and this movie proves it.  Wonderful cast and easily identifiable, totally loved it!!!",1407196800,26,702,4.369230769230769
6384711,5,B00JPFTS2M,"Excellent movie!  I admit, I started it with doubt, but this movie sends the message that family is important no matter how disfunction alfa milt may be. I highly recommend this movie!",1406937600,7,184,4.75

6384714,1,B00JPFTS2M,"Ugh, I was surprised at just how bad this movie was, given the fact that Whoopi Goldberg (one of my favorites) played the lead character.  There are (barely) plausible moments in this over-dramatized, mostly implausible, overly-contentious dram-edy? (it never quite gets there), but they are too few and far between to do anything for the overall movie itself.  Worst of all, at the very end of the show, it goes suddenly saccharine as everyone sits in a circle in a far-fetched ""happy ending"".  Save your money and watch an old gem like ""Kingdom Come"" again, because I think that's what they were trying to do with this one, and it missed the mark.",1405728000,,649,4.725663716814159
