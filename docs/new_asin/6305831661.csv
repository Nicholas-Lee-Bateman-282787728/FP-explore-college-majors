When I got older and met my first great love (who I'm actually dating now :))  it was the closest a movie has ever come for me personally to reenacting how we met, how we started to talk, how we slowly but surely started to fall in love. It's so easy to relate to. And it's really funny so it's not absolute torture for a guy to sit through.

1083758,4,6305831661,"Let's say that a rom com is like a cake. You have the cake--which in this case would be the romance between Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Julia Stiles--Mm mm-Cake! Then you have the frosting--the comic relief with Rosario Dawson, Ashton Kutcher, Henry Winkler, Lucie Arnaz, Jimmy Kimmel, Adam Corolla, and Shawn Hatosy. Then you have a file. Something baked into the cake to give it a little dramatic tension. Some edge. The darkness to offset the light. Here the file would be Zak Orth as an adult film auteur and his protegee, Cyrus, played by Selma Blair. But is this the file, or is it just more frosting? This subplot is so silly and ludicrous that sometimes it is hard to tell.

As the film starts the three college friends, Al, Monk, and Eddie, are in their favorite dive. Monk is pontificating, boy does he ever pontificate. For an adult film ""actor"" he acts like he thinks he is a regular Orson Welles or something. Eddie wants to get in the biz so Monk issues a challenge: sleep with freshman Lana (Rosario Dawson) and Monk will get Eddie an audition. Al (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) wonders where he will sleep. Monk points out another freshman. Imogen (Julia Stiles). Is this the film's version of meet cute?

I will say at this point that Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Julia Stiles were both very attractive people, but Julia hadn't really hit her stride acting-wise. She is too cerebral. She is a smart girl who will soon take time out to graduate from college, but at this phase of her illustrious career she is too much in her head. She thinks too much to just act--to just react to the other actors. And Prinze, well no one is going to mistake him for the next Olivier, that's for sure. He mostly just looks confused. He's good at that. Director Kris Isacsson doesn't do them any favors having them look directly in the camera and talk about their childhoods. He even has them address each other as the kids they once were. One is grown up, but everyone else in the flashback is young. Woody make it work in Annie Hall, but here not so much. One other thing is that they have zero chemistry together, though you might not notice since Prinze is so darn charming and Stiles has such flamboyant style.

Imogen: That kiss belongs in a box, so I can show my grand kids one day.

She liked cakes, but they were cheap cakes she buys in convenience stores. The Mm-mm-cakes. Was this product placement? And if she was a spoiled rich brat who summered in France, and he was the son of a chef who wanted to be a chef himself, why did they go nuts over cheap store bought cakes? If a rom com is like a cake, then The icing on this cake was also cheap store bought frosting--full of chemicals and too much processed white sugar.

Shawn Hatosy as Eddie was subtle as a rodeo clown. Rosario Dawson was an under utilized resource. Ashton Kutcher played a Jim Morrison clone who was so pretentious that he actually called himself Jim Morrison. Zak Orth as adult film auteur Monk Jablonski was totally ludicrous. This whole adult film subplot, supposed to spice things up, was just a silly distraction. Actually, Selma Blair as Monk's protegee Cyrus, displayed a rather dark intensity that was quite intriguing, but it never went anywhere. Monk actually said things like ""I'm not good with open wounds. You were always my Lancelot, I was just never your king."" No, really. That is an actual line of dialogue. I'm serious.

The Bottom Line is that Down to You is not a very good movie. But like the cheap cake they both share a love for, I liked it anyway.

1083759,4,6305831661,"Everyone I know who has seen this tells me I'm kind of stupid for liking it, but I can't help it.  I mean, I actually think it was one of the better romantic comedies (teen oriented of course) of the early 00's.  Remember when Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles were famous?  I do to, and I kind of miss that (well, I miss Stiles, not Prinze Jr.).

I actually think that this movie is somewhat unique.  Told from multiple angles by having both Stiles and Prinze Jr.'s characters narrate, the film is far more colorful than most in this genre.  I'm still baffled that this made so many `Worst of the Decade' lists.  I mean, this is no where near as bad as some of the dreck that comes out of Hollywood.  Narrating their college romance, Prinze Jr. and Stiles play Al and Imogen, two very different yet very compatible (opposites do attract) `pretty people'.

I don't understand those who say that there is no plot.  The plot is the relationship, nothing more nothing less.

I think that, while corny at times, the script is fun and fresh and isn't something you see in every film of this nature.  Both Stiles and Prinze Jr. are charismatic and they have fun with each other and with the scenes.  They aren't the only ones having fun here.  The entire cast does well here.  Sure, it doesn't always come together as crisply as one may want (yes, I know that some scenes leave questions unanswered) but in the end it doesn't really seem to matter too much.

And I loved the ending.

1083761,5,6305831661,"Ok, so this movie is far from a work of art. At best it's a cheesy high school chick flick. Maybe it just came out at a time I could completely relate to the story (broke up with my high-school boyfriend) but I still love this movie even today. In fact, last year I asked my sister for the DVD for my bday, and I love it just as much.

Imagine played by Julia Stiles, whom I love is an indepent girl who falls for Alfred played by Prinze Jr. His innocence is adorable, and their story is cute, and magical. It's a very typical college experience for the most part. They break-up only to later re-unite.

Watching this movie for ""Prinz"" and ""Stiles"" is counterproductive.  Not only have the actors ""failed to make the best"" of the script, the script was written from the viewpoint of the super-rich Hollywood elite who live lives with zero financial consequences.  Thus, we watch as young adults walk out on culinary school, muse about becoming ""singer-songwriters"", and ""stop paying attention"" to their college plans.  Much like the ""Friends"" genre that this movie shamelessly imitates, this is a ""time porn"" piece, where the characters have little else to do besides ""mature romantically"" and ""find themselves"".  A movie for history's circular file.",1111017600,2,777,5.336065573770492
1083796,3,6305831661,"""Down to You"" is a romantic comedy that insists on substituting style for substance at key moments in the proceedings. It wants to take a cute approach to a serious relationship, as Al (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) and Imogen (Julia Stiles) do a retroactive post mortem on their relationship. The problem, as they both confide to the audience, is that they were too young when they met each other, implying that if only the timing was right the relationship would be right. The tagline for this film was ""A new comedy about giving first love a second chance,"" which goes beyond the boundaries of either description or foreshadowing enough to warrant losing a star on the rating on that basis alone.

 Al and Imogen meet at a bar and click immediately, which seems to be more of a surprise to him than to her. She has sworn off dating so can enjoy her college experience, but she is not about to let a rule make her pass on Al who she considers to be cute. He has some strange dorm friends (Selma Blair, Shawn Hatosy, Zak Orth and Rosario Dawson) who want him to swear off on Imogen, but he manages to ignore them most of the time. Meanwhile, the damage caused by his famous chef father (Henry Winkler in a nice turn, with Lucy Arnaz as his wife) does not seem to be too bad since he has the family cooking gene, but we have to wait a long time in this movie for him to grow up enough to be almost good enough for her.

 Director-writer Kris Isacsson has two personable performers but never really does right by them. She is the more serious of the pair (it will be a long time before Stiles is ever the flighty one in a romantic comedy; it takes a Jason Bourne to get her to back down in a film), and he never really succeeds in bridging the gap to the point where we believe these two have a real chance. Al is just not in her league. The problem is that ultimately this is not a cute film about a serious relationship but a cute film about a cute relationship, and that can be fraught with danger, especially when songs get used to cover up the problems. When the character of Monk in this film becomes the voice of reason, you know the train has left the tracks.",1091318400,8,2157,4.279411764705882
1083797,1,6305831661,"I'm making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon, due to the utter vileness of this movie.  I saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it, and then a friend purchased the DVD and convinced me to give it a second chance...  all in all, this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that I will never get back.

The performances are thin and uneven, the plot is inconsistent, and the dialogue sounds like it was pulled from fortune cookies made by the cast of Friends.  To be fair, this movie does face several major obstacles.  It has the misfortune to depend on the ""acting"" of glorified Ken doll Freddie Prinze, Jr. and the vastly overrated Julia Stiles, and in addition to trying to rise above these challenges, it also attempts to survive the intrusion of Ashton Kutcher.  It fails on all counts.

I do not hate the whole romantic comedy genre; nor do I hate the ""teen"" movie sub-genre, under which some would place ""Down to You.""  (In fact, ""Can't Hardly Wait"" is one of my favorite movies.)  I simply hate BAD movies, and this movie is a true abomination.  If you enjoy the experience of wanting to drill into your own skull, then by all means, buy this DVD.  If, however, you value your sanity, then please do not make the same mistake I did; stay far, FAR away from this movie.",1077148800,6,1330,4.387755102040816
1083798,2,6305831661,"Funny that most movies with Freddie Prinze, Jr. aren't very good. In this one, he plays college student Al, who falls in love with fellow student Imogen (yup, that really IS a name) alias Julia Stiles. Al definitely thinks that Imogen is the love of his life, but soon nothing is as happy as it used to be, especially when Imogen cheats on Al with a reincarnation of Jim Morrison (Ashton Kutcher). But...surprise, surprise...the movie still has a happy ending.
""Down To You"" is not a desastrous movie, but it's really nothing that you'd like to see more than once. The story is old and shapeless, the jokes are not funny and the dialogues are flat and not very smart. The cast, however, doesn't make the movie any better. Julia Stiles was in better roles already, Freddie Prinze, Jr. is acting like a piece of wood and Ashton Kutcher's part is simply bad. Not to mention the supporting actors like Selma Blair and Zak Orth.

1083799,5,6305831661,"This is the perfect romance film to watch as a couple, to remember your first love and reminisce about the good and the bad times. It starts off with Freddie Prinz Jnr (Al) and Julia Stiles (Imogen) narrating between flashbacks.
Julia Stiles is one of the best young actresses of the moment, and her & Freddie Prinz Jnr make a great couple. Selma Blair, Shawn Hatosy and Zak Orth also star, along with a permanently stoned Ashton Kutcher, who apparently looks like Jim Morrison from The Doors.
The scene where Imogen sings/dances to Al is the best, and it shows what the whole film is about - despite the fact that Al gets embarrassed as he's a sophomore dating a freshman.
Imogen & Al are very different people and show that opposites can attract. She likes painting and he likes to cook. Al's friends aren't happy that Al & Imogen are practically turning into an old married couple before their eyes, already having a pregnancy scare barely a year into their relationship. You know this relationship is doomed from the start of the film, due to them being different & pressure from their friends.
The narration between the flashback scenes does break the film up, and the first time I watched this film, it really annoyed me, but it also shows the film from Al & Imogen's point of view.
There's a classic line in this, which is Imogen's fear: ""One day we'll pass each other on the street and have that artificial conversation"".
The ending is great, and the Billie Myers song sums up the whole film.
This film is a must-see for Julia Stiles/Freddie Prinz Jnr fans, or to see as a couple, or to watch alone, simply to reminisce and not get embarrassed when you start crying.
Extras include the theatrical trailer; TV spots; cast & crew interviews; on the set; and Billie Myer's ""It All Comes Down To You"" music video.",1063584000,7,1817,4.593846153846154

1083801,2,6305831661,"On another web site (which I won't mention here, though those who know me at all can guess which one I mean), I wrote a glowing review of this film, when of course I was in my formative and naiive years of film criticism, calling it the best teenage romance film I'd seen in years. A few nights ago I saw it again, and whew, I must've been out of my mind! Because, without proper analysis and proper depth, this film does indeed seem tricky, even enveloping. But, on a second viewing, I saw that it was nothing but tacky teenage romance mondure.
Freddie Prinze Jr plays the son of a famous tv chef who meets and soon falls in love with a college student, played by Julia Stiles. The film then shows the expansion, unraveling, and coming-to-terms sections of their relationships, while each has their own group of friends to nibble at their ears.
To be fair, the acting wasn't terrible to stand, and indeed Stiles is a competant enough actress to follow along with what she goes through. But Prinze, as well as other cast members, are never convincing enough to pull through the compost of script material that has been given to them. In fact, I wish I could give this film a 1.5 (not a 1, only because of Stiles and maybe a couple of scenes with Winkler).",1053043200,,1255,4.413793103448276

i enjoyed this movie every much because it's a feel good movie about first falling in love. it's also more down to earth, more real life than some other cheesey love movies. but this movie just doesn't deal with love, it deals with friendships and growing in life as a person. Shawn Hatosy is freaking awsome in this movie. i also like Monk. just a very feel good movie.

I was completely taken aback by the superb level of acting by both Julia Stiles and Freddie Prinze Jr. I am not usually a fan of romance movies because they are almost all exactly the same.

1083822,2,6305831661,"THE STORY:
Freddy Prinze Jr. (She's All That, Summer Catch, etc) and Julia Stiles (Ten Things I Hate About You, Save the Last Dance, O, etc.) play Al and Imogen who through a series of flashbacks and weird cut-aways recount their on-again/off-again romance.  Overall, deep down inside the story is probably pretty nice - IF YOU CAN TOLERATE THE STORYTELLING TO THE VERY END.
In sum, the countless flashbacks and seemingly pointless cut-aways will leave you confused, frustrated and ultimately very bored!!!  I personally stopped watching the movie about 40 minutes into the rental.  My fianc managed to make it to the end but even she said the movie ""was not that good"" and ""was not worth the rental"" (well, it's a paraphrase as a little more colorful language was used) citing the same reasons (confusing jumps from scene-to-scene, etc).
Overall, I think this movie suffers from the ""promising story, BAD execution"" syndrome.
THE DVD Features:
A little sparse on DVD special features the DVD also includes these:
1. Billy Myers ""It All Came Down To You"" music video:  An alright feature, but not alone worth the DVD
2. A ""making of the music video"" special:  a 45 second video set to the song.  45 seconds???  Geez, what was the point???
3. Trailers for two other movies, ""She's All That"" (starring male lead Freddie Prinze Jr.) and ""Ten Things I Hate About You"" (starring female lead Julia Stiles).
THE VERDICT:
In all, it's safe for me to say that if you've never seen this you're probably better off saving your money and renting/buying some better movies to watch (such as the two other movies featured in the trailers section).  In all, unless you don't mind the non-sensical storytelling you're off probably - most definitely - better off spending your time and money on another movie.
Apparently, I wasn't the only who felt this way about the movie as I remember it not lasting more than a month in the theatres before it was yanked when it first came out.

Even Freddie Prinze, Jr, who I was prepared to hate, did a remarkable job.  The film reminded me of how I felt watching Sixteen Candles for the first time.  Some of the reviews criticize the use of the peripheral players in this movie, who lead unrealistic lives as porn actors and directors, tv chefs, radio dj's, professional artists, etc.  However, I have to disagree.  To me, these outlandish characters painted a surreal landscape for two basically well-adjusted and likeable leads to carry on a classic love tale.

The story takes place in college, which I find more entertaining than an average High School movie. The first half hour of the movie was kind of strange to me. I mean, a roommate that is a porno movie director and a dad who is a famous cook( played by Henry Winkler) is not your usual dialogue in this kind of movie. Which made me love this even more! I am crazy about romantic comedies and this is BY FAR(so far) the best one I have seen. After you get introduced to the Very Different characters, you find that this movie is incredibly well-written and really sweet and entertaining. i also happened to laugh a lot more than a typical teen comedy.

Freddie Prinze has had the same sweetheart role in every one of his movies - so I'm starting to look for something different from him... Julia Stiles impressed me - as she has now played the ugly girl (10 Things I Hate About You) and the beautiful girl, and each she seems to let her character show.  Henry Winkler as Chef Ray was a bit over-the-top, but it worked. The script itself was interesting - although quite predictable (aside from the shampoo-drinking incident).  Being so, it had periods where it dragged.  It was obviously written to appeal to the teenage audience, and I'm going to venture that it was drawn up the night after the box-office reviews from ""She's All That"" reached Isaacson's (writer/director) ears.
Overall, it was a pretty good movie.  The actors worked well with the script, although the format was a bit off - the way that it was told from the point of view of Prinze ""looking back"" on his first love, didn't really work with the ending, as it would have seemed that Prinze had never seen this girl again in the way he was telling the story.

Despite all the main characters' struggles, it seems like nothing dramatic or exciting happens.

I hated this movie.  It was boring, unfunny, and immature.  I thought the acting was second-rate(at best) and the plot could have used a LOT of help. But overall the most annoying thing about the whole affair was how utterly unrealistic the whole thing was.  For one, they have unprotected sex about 300 times!  Did she really think that she could do that WITHOUT getting pregnant?  Give me a break.  And who drinks a bottle of shampoo to get over a lost love?  That's not romantic, that's just plain sick.

Selma Blair, Henry Winkler and the 'Jim Morrison' guy were refreshing, but other than that, it was painful to watch.  The plot would suddenly jump periods of time for no reason. Freddie Prinze was awful.  There was absolutely no reason to care what happened.  The story was extremely detached and I would have left in a second if i had a ride home.

I know that everyone has their own preferences, but I find it difficult to see how ""Down to You"" can be described as a funny and romantic comedy, especially when the last half of the movie is filled with sadness and betrayal.
THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE.
Freddie Prinze Jr. plays a guy (the movie was so bad I didn't even care to remember their names) who meets and falls in love with Julia Stiles, for what reasons I'll never know. In the beginning it's puppy love, sex, sex, and more sex, all without any real love or any noticable passion between them. (However I must admit that the acting was decent; the fault lies with whomever created these empty, shallow characters.)
The middle-end of the story is where the movie becomes excruciatingly horrible. Julia Stiles has major mood swings for no reason and takes all of this terrible, raging anger out on her innocent, unsuspecting boyfriend. She pretty much treats her wonderful boyfriend like crap. And let me tell you, I searched and searched for a LOGICAL reason why Julia Stiles would do this to Freddie by mentally running back through the previous events of the movie, but I found nothing. Freddie was a saint to her the entire time. To top it all off, she SLEEPS with another guy. The ultimate betrayal.
This is not my idea of a light-hearted, whimsical, romantic comedy that emphasizes the deep and heart-felt facets of true love. This movie was a depressing, pointless, and disturbing portrayal of how some people can acually fool themselves into believing that they can still trust their girlfriend or boyfriend after they've treated them like crap and then boinked someone else.
I guess the title of the movie means, ""When it all comes Down To You, I guess you're not worth it so I'm going to treat you like garbage and then cheat on you.""
If you hated this movie but appreciate real romantic comedies, I suggest ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Only You.""",970617600,7,1971,4.699421965317919

I remembered my sister talking about, so I assumed it was another chick flick.  I got it anyways since I had seen the other movies.  Boy was I wrong in my assumption.
The movie starts off as your typical boy meets girl movie, but moves on into something that anyone who even knows what love is can relate to.  The movie gets into what most relationships are really all about.  With the two main charcters talking about the small things each other does that they like, to them discussing their vices, to the pregnancy scare, and the small lovers quarrels, this movie depicts a more realistic relationship very well.
I was very surprised with my own reaction to this movie.  I thought it was going to be just like all the other chick flicks my girlfriend has drug me off to see about a girl having a baby in Wal-Mart or something.

Back when this film was  first released, I was forced into seeing it with a female family member.  I  expected the worst.  It had Freddie Prinze, Jr. in it.  The commercials for  it seemed to imply that it was geared towards the teen set.  I really  wasn't expecting to like this film.  Boy, was I surprised!
This film  ended up becoming one of my favorite romantic comedies.  The story itself,  about the evolving of Alfred and Imogen's relationship, was so well written  and unpredictable.  It wasn't one of those films where you could predict  each plot twist twenty minutes before it happened.
The cast is above par  for movies of this genre.  Stiles and Prinze do a good job in their lead  roles.  Selma Blair and the actor who played Alfred's  ""artsy-fartsy"" porn actor friend were also entertaining.  Film  and TV legend Henry Winkler added a lot of gusto to the film in the  supporting role of Alfred's Emeril-esque dad as well.
Guys, if you want a  good date movie to watch with your girlfriend that won't leave you  squirming, this is the one to get.  I highly recommend it!",968889600,,1131,4.585858585858586
1084092,4,6305831661,"In reading some of the other reviews, it seems very much that this is a film that people either love or hate.  At first glance, it is very much the  boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy and girl date, boy and girl break up,  boy and girl get back together and the world is wonderful place kind of  story.  It's a teen flick so yes, it's going to be predictable.  Predictable, however, does not have to mean bad or boring.  There was a  great deal of emotional undertone to the story.  It's about college love,  which anyone who's been there knows isn't easy.  The timing always seems to  be wrong in one way or another.  Like many other films, this one does not  gloss over that part.  It very honestly, I think, shows the kinds of  problems that can evolve.  Granted, I don't have any porn star turned rich  lecturer friends, and I know no one who drank shampoo after a breakup, but  there is definitely some measure of reality and honesty to this picture.  Yes they end up together in the end (and no, that's not giving away the  ending) but it wasn't an easy road nor is there an implication that it is  going to be.  Love isn't easy.  It never has been.  If it were easy, the  feelings wouldn't have any meaning and this world would be a very dark  place.  This film captures that essence.
If you're asking for a plot  that has twists and turns, something that is action packed, then don't see  this film.  It moves a little slowly and it is difficult to ascertain where  some of the characters are coming from.  But if you've been in love, if you  are in love, if you've had your heart broken or broken someone else's, even  if you want to fall in love, see this film.  It reminds all of us that  there is hope and that you can never completely give up on anybody.  One  day, you might just be surprised.",968716800,,1808,4.236686390532545

1084096,5,6305831661,"Most of the time I tend to shy away from romance movies simply because they often are so cloying it makes me sick or they are completely  unrealistic. This film is neither of those.
The movie is presented as a  story told by Imogen (Julia Stiles) and Al (Freddie Prinz, Jr.) about how  they met and fell in love. It begins at a local college bar with Al talking  with his friends Monk (a recently discovered porn star) and Hicks. Monk  challenges Hicks to ""hook up"" with a freshman to prove to Monk he  has what it takes to also be a porn star. This bet displaces Al for the  night who, is instructed to sleep ""with that freshman"" pointing  to Imogen. Al wonders over to her and strikes up a conversation ultimatly  leading to their romance.
The film locations are overall pretty good.  Locations and scenary compliment the movie very nicely. The park seems to  be the most recurring location for filming including Al's walks with Monk  and the first kiss Al and Imogen share in a beautifully shot scene lit by  the moon.
Casting is excellent. It is interesting to watch the evolution  of Al's friends which runs along side the developement of his relationship  with Imogen. There is even an X-Files cameo (The Satanic Substitute Teacher  from Season 1 if anyone cares to know).
The soundtrack is an excellent  ecclectic mix, but I am kind of disappointed some songs such as the one in  the bar prior to Dee Lite's ""Groove is in the Heart"" and GooGoo  Dolls' ""Black Balloon"" never made it onto the CD but the tracks  that did are very well representing of the movie's musical theme.",966643200,2,1582,4.522968197879859

Anyway, this is not like any of Freddie's previous  projects- it does not have a man with a hook, another man with a hook, has  no planes, and does not have Usher. Most people compare DOWN TO YOU to  SHE'S ALL THAT, but the two are nothing alike.  If you are looking for a  comedy/romance, do NOT get DOWN TO YOU. I did not laugh once the entire  movie!

I don't  feel they showed enough to give us a clear picture of their feelings. I  would've liked to see more of what was going on in their relationship.

1084168,1,6305831661,"""Down To You"" is a new teen film by our ""good teenage friends"" over at Miramax starring Freddie Prinze Jr. (is his carrer  just going to be teen movies after the other?) and Julia Stiles.
Freddie  plays Al, a college student. He wants to be a chef like his dad (Henry  Winker), but ends up working on his famous television show. His roommates,  are a diffrent story. One is a porn star (Zak Orth) and the other one is  not a chick magnet but wants all the chicks he can get (Shawn Hatosy). All  Al wants is love, but his two other roommates don't agree with him. Julia  plays Imogen (yeah, I don't know how to pronounce it either). She is a  freshman in college and dosen't want to have a romance, but ends up falling  for Al. The rest of the film is just the trouble and tribulations that Al  and Imogen go through during their relationship.
The plot is predictible,  I found out what was gonna happen since the opening scene with Al at the  coffee shop. The film also has some pretty bad acting (Selma Blair as a  pornstar, I don't think so). The film only attracts to teenage girls, so if  you're not female, ages 8 - 17, you're gonna hate this film.
The DVD  contains a nice anamorphic widescreen transfer, good surrounding Dolby  Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, and some not-so-worthy extras (the  behind-the-scenes at the music video lasts 30 seconds while the  behind-the-scenes at the film lasts 1 minute). The extras are mostly what  you find on VHS, but the transfer make up for what lacks on this DVD.

Yes ofcourse there is cursing but very  little, barely actually. usually parents won't want to see our movies, but  this is a mom and daughter movie. These types of movies only come around  every once in a while. It has a good story line and I'd tell you but I  don't want to ruin it. Considering I didn't see that movie just becuz some  hot actor was in it I would definetly give it TWO THUMBS UP!! If you're  into a good love story this is for you.

I, though finding this movie an insult to my intelligence, am a fan of some 'romantic comedies'.  10 Things I Hate About You was a lot of fun to watch because of the actors  and their great talent (the sript was pretty bad, though the plot was ok).  Julia had my respect.  So did Freddie, even though he doesn't have to do  much acting.... ever!  I said 'Yea!' to the team up and 'Yea!' to the  cute preview, but then reality set in with the opening sceen.  Classic  narration.  It was so badly written that even I began to feel sorry for the  actors as they rattled on and on with lines that would be better ad-libed!  Then the 'plot' (ha ha, like there was one) proceded into the traditional =  boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl (for no reason but he got two  hugs) and proceds to live a happy college life with girl (sex, parties,  more narration, sex, parties, etc...).  And all the while we are being  tortured with details of 'interesting' lives, how they are unique (white,  upperclass, and privilaged) with many acceptable talents.  The parents are  annoying older people who just don't get the details (join the club) but  know enough to give the necessary advice to stear their baby in the right  direction.  So we come to the fourth and most predictable part of this  monumental motion picture = boy loses girl, in a surprising real way; sort  of.  All over blown and under acted to make this overdramtic goo of flat  gray, do I dare call it, conflict.  Whoopie.  Guess what happens next  folks?  I'm not going to write it, all I can say is 'DUH!

1084171,2,6305831661,"First of all I'm guessing a lot of teens have no idea what my heading means. ""Annie Hall"" is a Woody Allen film that was made in 1977 and won the ""Best Picture"" Oscar that year. It was a romantic comedy about a man (Allen) shifting through certain moments of his relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). They used flashbacks,fast fowards, and even animation! Kris Isacsson this film's director is so clearly not only a fan of ""Annie Hall"", but HAS to be a Woody Allen fan as well. There's no other way one could explain this film. It's the same thing only done with a teen twist to it. Both films take place one year after their relationships fell through. Both use flashbacks, fast fowards, and the characters are able to comment on past experinces as we (the viewer) watch the scene happen. This was used in ""Annie Hall"" as well. This movie is about Freddie Prince Jr. trying to figure out what went wrong with his relationship. In the first 45 minutes I liked what I saw. I thought Julia Stiles and Freddie made a good couple. It was a ""cute"" movie showing teen love. After about an hour the movie now tries to become this profound movie about love. Give me a break! The ideas in this movie are mindless. It's a pretenious showing of the hardships of teen love. Awwww, stop, my heart is breaking here! If you really want to watch a great romantic comedy I suggest watching ""Annie Hall"". It's the quintessential romantic comedy of all time. And if you don't believe me watch it and see.

I thought I'd give it a shot because Julie was in it, and I enjoy  watching high school type movies. This wasn't your typical high school  movie though. It was more towards the late teens/early twenties crowd.  Julie plays Imogen, a Freshman at the local college that's studying to be  an Artist. Freddie plays Al, also a student at the college, that wants to  be a world famous chef, like his father (played by Henry Winkler). Al's  father has his own cooking show on TV (just think Emeril Lagasse). His  father has plans for him and Al to have their own father-son show, but Al  wants to work his way from the bottom up. The main focus of the movie was  concentrated on Imogen and Al's relationship of course. The movie has some  great characters in it, like Al's father, his best friend that's in the  porn industry, and a wanna be Jim Morrison. I thought the story was good,  and the directing as well. I liked how both Al and Imogen were both telling  the story. The only part that I didn't like about the movie was when Imogen  ruined their relationship by......well not to spoil it for you, but you  should watch it.

However, let's start off with  the positive aspects of the film: I like the fact that we have finally  reached beyond the ""high school"" settings and into the college  crowd. I also like the fact that we see a little more emotion in the lead  characters, as they are faced with some of life's biggest challenges. But I  must admit that the negatives far outweigh the positives. The story  flounders frequently between being your typical 'teen' flick, a romantic  comedy and a serious drama with social issues. It's hard to really tell  whose side to take. Prinze Jr. and Stiles are good in their roles, but with  very little to do they seem almost decent to be in another movie. Even the  supporting cast lacks depth...Selma Blair and Shawn Hatosy are basically  used only as eye candy and seem almost inserted into slow points of the  film to keep you from falling asleep.

They meet the boy's parents although i must say that the fonz Henry Winkler is amusing as a chef.
Written and Directed by first timer Kirs Isacsson tries to make something new about this tired genre and smart and funny. But Ultimately is just cliche after cliche. Their is nothing original to the story. Sure Freddie Prinze Jr. is handsome as always but he is just like every other character he has played a pretty boy falling in love. If he dosn't break out of this genre he will be stereotyped as a high school teen idol. Or if you want to the male version of Meg Ryan. Who is always bright and sunny but will never break out of light romances. But it is Julia Stiles who is the better of the two leads.  She is sunny shows some emotional ranges and is very attractive.
When you get down to it the only people who will enjoy it will be 15 year old girls who love these kinds of movies. To be fair their is nothing wrong with this movie it had some funny parts mainly with Selma Blair who is a sex crazed attic. Other than that it is predictible and mindless.

Luckily, I ended up renting it and loved every minute of it! As it says on the video-cover, ""Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Julia Stiles shine!"" After seeing it, I took the movie to be about two very mature human-beings having a very mature relationship around friends who were anything but mature. The ending, by the way, is wonderful, I love Barry White! (You'll have to see it to get it...)
I felt a little bad for Selma Blair's acting r&eacute;sum&eacute;, though. She plays a highly promiscuous porn-star.
Julia Stiles is always amazing, so it was no surprise that she was great in this film. Her acting abilities are incredible.
Freddie Prinze surprised me. I'm not one of those screaming fans of his, and never really liked the ""teen-ie"" type movies he was doing, so I was quite pleased to discover that this wasn't just a teen-flick.
I'd say, in the beginning, before I saw it, it seemed like a movie that would attract tons of ""first-date"" couples. You know the ones: 5th graders-through-Freshmans in High School.
But after seeing it, I think that college couples and young-couples in their 20's might benefit more from seeing ""Down To You"".
It gives you a more realistic idea of what makes a relationship work than most of the romantic comedies today do.
This is a really sweet movie. But not too sweet. Guys will like it, too. :)",963705600,,1406,4.673387096774194
1084242,3,6305831661,"This cookie cutter romantic comedy is a lot like cotton candy.  It is sweet and fluffy with almost no substance.  It is so syrupy in fact; that you have to be careful you don't go into diabetic shock.
Writer/Director  Kris Isaacson tries very hard to make this the perfect schmaltzy romantic  comedy.  He tries to copy Woody Allen's first person multiple narrative  technique from the perspectives of the two lovers, but unfortunately, his  writing isn't strong enough to make this technique effective.  In the first  part of the film, he tries to depict the perfect college romance.  In the  second part, he tries to portray the jilted lovelorn guy pathetically  drifting with his life bereft of meaning.  The ending; well I'm sure you  can figure it out.
Unfortunately, all this accomplishes is to create a  perfectly trite story with characters so clich&eacute; they belong in a soft drink  commercial.  This is why I rated this film a perfect 5/10: perfectly  average.
The acting was better than the direction.  Julia Stiles was the  stronger of the two leads.  She was adorable as the misty eyed lover and  actually showed some emotional range as the relationship got into trouble.  Freddie Prinze, Jr. seems to be determined to become a male Meg Ryan, not  daring to venture beyond the safety of light romantic comedy.  He was  adequate in his presentation of the smitten smurf, but his languid  character was such an emotional lightweight that a strong breeze would have  blown him away.
I would recommend this as a good date movie for never  married audiences under 25.  It has some funny and charming moments and  won't overtax anyone with complex characters and abstruse plotlines.  If  you are young or young at heart, you'll probably enjoy it.",963705600,,1755,4.8805460750853245
1084243,5,6305831661,"First of all, if you're anything over 35 or so you probably won't like this movie.  As for the modern-day teenagers or those twenty-somethings, there is a very good chance that this movie will remind you of yourself and  significant other.  This is a very personal, yet socially relevant film for  today's youth.  These trials and tribulations are extremely prevailent in  so many relationships.  ""Down to You"" is a great movie to share  with someone you care about.",963446400,,466,4.884615384615385

Well, I am not a big Freddie Prince Jr. fan, really i've, seen ""I know what you did last summer"" that was, good Julia  Stiles is a good actress, ""10 Things I Hate About You"" was, good  if you got a boyfriend or girlfriend have them watch this movie with you,  will like this movie!",963360000,,377,4.28169014084507

7896408,2,6305831661,"Considering I do like Freddie Prinze, and find a lot of his movies pretty funny, this movie was very lacking. The narration by him and Julia Stiles about their sides of the romance was weak at best. They also usually co-star him with some pretty good looking actresses but Stiles just isn't in that category, she's just not very attractive. But she didn't kill the movie, although I just couldn't picture them ever being together, the story was simply pretty bad. Stiles needs to be cast with less attractive guys like Heath Ledger because she's an ok actress but not a heart throb and not cute. The movie moves slowly and it's really hard to believe that after they break up that Prinze would be lonely and can't find a woman. The part where he drinks shampoo is ridiculous and the ending....ugh. She's All That, Head Over Heals, Summer Catch, Boys and Girls, are all much better movies for Freddie Prinze fans than this weak attempt.",1503446400,,935,4.63855421686747
