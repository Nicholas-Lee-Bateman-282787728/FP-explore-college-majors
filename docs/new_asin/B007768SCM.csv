However the English language subtitles and translation on this issue of the movie are so lousy that they render the film unwatchable & meaningless, crushing most of the nuance, ideas & questions created by the actors & director.

It was a very sloppy subtitling job and the company that issued this DVD should be embarrassed.",1456531200,,412,5.044117647058823
8511562,5,B007768SCM,"The essay in the booklet is excellent.  The author points to a shot where a charcater is shot by shotgun, off-screen, at the end of a shot that moves through several rooms, as if in a semi-circle, from murder-victim to murderer.  The murderer has no motive, so the shooting is quite shocking.",1439596800,,292,4.596153846153846
