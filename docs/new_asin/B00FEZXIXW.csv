5985959,4,B00FEZXIXW,Not a deep movie but time filling entertainment. The ending really stinks. It's like they ran out of film before they were through. I'd like to have seen some closure.,1462147200,,167,4.6

8615039,5,B00FEZXIXW,Really enjoyed the awkward internal struggle that they never really needed to bring up. You could feel the passion somehow. Loved it. Would hope for a sequel or really any similar projects. Bo Burnham especially worked well in this setting,1511654400,,239,5.0
8615040,4,B00FEZXIXW,"One part The Apartment, one part 1980's sex comedy, and a smattering of real drama. Very nicely done.

Acting was decent, camerawork also, and the dialog felt natural (possibly excluding one character, but I think that stiffness was intentional).",1485648000,,246,5.3076923076923075

8615046,2,B00FEZXIXW,"The emphasis on object rape con dumbs which inflict severe psychological trauma beyond what was demonstrated prevents this film from rising to a three star rating.  The story line, photography, and production kept it above a one star rating.",1471910400,,241,5.17948717948718
