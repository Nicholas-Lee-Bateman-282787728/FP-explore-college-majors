937621,5,6304872429,This is a touching show about how the angels bring 2 brothers closer in understanding each other and how much they really mean to each other. This happens due to a series of events. Tess and Monica at their best! This is a  tape I will watch anytime of the year. Makes you stop and think of your  relationships with family members and how sometimes we don't communicate  well enough to let them know how we feel. This tape will bring you  entertainment and a lesson on how to accept someone even tho they are  different and not make them feel like a burden.,925862400,12,557,4.3173076923076925
937750,5,6304872429,this episode is about looking with the heart not with our eyes because they can deceive us. Monica is blind for most of the episode which helps her with her assignment. A man who has a wealthy grandfather comes to a community to get it cleaned up so it could be sold. In the meantime there is a shooting where one person is killed and one is wounded which causes him to be blind. Monica has to get the people to look beyond their environment to see what is possible.,1330387200,2,466,4.188888888888889
937751,4,6304872429,"This is all about faith and hope.  It could be called ""A Walk to Remember"" at Christmas only with a different ending.  She does not die!  There was a beautiful nativity scene at the church where we saw a stained glass window of Jesus all in blue.  The outdoor decorations in the neighborhood where this family lives are tasteful.  Susan was given a""Mary"" angel which was fantastic.  She's been sick for awhile and it is now cancer.  When someone you love gets sick, it's hard.  Susie's cancer is as bad as it can get.  The doctors have experimented on her with new and different drugs, but nothing seems to help.  She is gradually deminishing day by day.  The husband is appealing as he grieves for his dying wife and suffered more (""I just don't feel anything any more"" like Zach) than he can take.  He tells her ""It's not my fault that your cancer is terminal"" but he refuses to tell the young son and daughter how bad their mother's condition is.  Things change.

They must live in Chicago, as they to their summer home in Michigan for the holidays.  I know the Mathers who have one and my son goes there every August and every Christmas.  Susie is getting weaker and weaker so he goes to the Greenville Inn to drink and get drunk where he heard a song about ""a brand new start.""  One of the women, his old girlfriend Karen, tried to get him to spend the night as they danced in the roadhouse: to relieve his frustrations.  He did not yield to temptation.

There in Maxwell was a beautiful church and one woman wore a blue flowered dress almost exactly like the one I wore to Jeff's wedding in Chicago.  Susie is blessed to have an expensive house in which to return to die.  She has lots of medicine bottles; but is very ill even though the tests all come back ""good.""  The doctor thinks it is a false result and tried a new drug.  It works!

There are several flashbacks to the time they were romancing and she was a professional singer in New York, a beautiful blonde who wore flashy red, blue or black outfits.  He popped the question in New York City.  At the time, she is pregnant with another man's baby; he had died in a motorcycle accident.  She has the baby after they are married, named Lucy Austin, but it dies.  Lucy is that little angel up in Heaven looking down on her mother now in this crisis and near death.

There is a blue moon there on Lake Michigan as they go to pick up old Gus, after Karen called to say that he is in a nursing home and she cannot take care of him on Christmas.  Susie is so afraid that her children will remember her ""sick"" not like the lovely star on the stage in New York.  They have planned a big party for the 23rd to take place in the large room with the grand piano, and Gus moves in as an overnight guest.  They tell the kids to call him Uncle Gus.  Actually Gus had died on the 22nd and his spirit is the healing guide God sent to them for Susie and the daughter who fell and hit her head.  He barely touched her face and hair and she is alright.

Sometimes, we question God's love.  Susie says ""You loved me most when it mattered the most to me (when she was having another man's child)""  She thinks that God is punishing her again for this deed, as he did when Lucy died.  But now, God has sent Gus to them as an angel in disguise.  He is adopted for the night of the party and everyone loves him.  On Christmas morning, Susie's spirit leaves  her earthly body, but she is reincarnated according to Gus' prophecy (to the children -- he had told them that she would be okay on Christmas) and is  young again.  The husband had already called the ambulance and told the children that their mom had died when she appeared healthy and beautiful again.  It was a miracle, a Christmas miracle in today's time and place when we need them desperately.

It was a tear jerker but worth each and every tear shed.  These were wealthy people with the finest of everything, doctors, hospitals, homes, friends, family.  The ending was just out of this world.  I wish I could have such a miracle in my life.  Don't listen to Betsy Pickle, a dull, frustrated obese person who finds fault in everything and every movie she reviews for the daily newspaper.  She was wrong about this one as so many others.  It was wonderful, marvelous, fantastic.  Go see it to lift your spirits and to make Christmas worthwhile this year.  This is THE Christmas movie for 2006.",1165104000,,4396,4.323529411764706

937753,5,6304872429,"All I can say after watching this video is WoW!!!
This would have to show Touched By an Angel at its finest! The acting is superb in both epsidoes, and the storyline, as always holds a feel-good and important message, and I would reccommend seeing this for any Touched fans, and even those who aren't!
This 2 episode tape features the excellent episodes, 'The Face of God' and 'Netherlands'. The first episode, 'The Face of God' deals with the moral issues of genetics, whilst the second episode, 'Netherlands' deals with the tough issue of terrorism. Both issues are dealt with extremely well in these episodes, and make this video a MUST SEE.
As always, the Touched by an Angel cast, crew and writers have provided inspirational and uplifting episodes. Well acted all round, with great storylines, and an even greater message and meaning, there is something for everyone to get out of these 2 amazing episodes.",1064361600,7,912,4.852564102564102
937754,5,6304872429,"If this won't move you to tears, I'm not sure anything will. I'm not a huge Touched By An Angel fan, but these are two episodes that I just love. Wayne (played by Randy Travis) is the callous older brother of a handicapped boy named Joey. Through these episodes, we see Wayne come to love and accept his brother, and God, more and more. Wonderful performances, especially from the guy that plays Joey (whose name I unfortunately can't remember at the moment). Definitely a worthy addition to your Christmas collection. Two thumbs up :)",1004313600,14,535,4.702127659574468

937756,5,6304872429,"""Touched by an Angel,"" an on-going CBS miracle drama, has touched the lives of numerous human beings and given the world renewed hope through one simple message: ""God loves you.""
This  entertaining, emotional, and enthralling series can also be beneficial to  parents as an excellent teaching tool for their children.  Each epsiode  easily captures the attention of its viewers; grown-ups and kids alike can  share in the angelic, yet very human characters of Monica (Roma Downey),  Tess (Della Reese), and Andrew (John Dye).
I wasn't an immense fan of  ""Touched by an Angel"" when a friend introduced the episode  ""Amazing Grace"" to my family.  My mom was slightly skeptical to  begin with, and my brothers were entirely disinterested.  Our friend  insisted that we give it a chance, however, and by the time it was over we  all had a new outlook on prejudice and the difference between looking with  our eyes and looking with our hearts.
Every lesson that ""Touched by  an Angel"" teaches is worth learning...and I have that on very high  authority!",961200000,5,1048,4.936781609195402
