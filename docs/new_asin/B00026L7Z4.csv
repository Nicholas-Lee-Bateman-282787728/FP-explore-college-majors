8023013,3,B00026L7Z4,This DVD story concentrates on the historical aspects of the revival -- but totally ignores the supernatural aspect and the miracles.,1526256000,,133,5.380952380952381
8023014,4,B00026L7Z4,Documentary of the 1904 Welsh revival under Evan Roberts. Early 1900s saw interest in religion and church influence on daily lives. There were so many poor at the turn of the century it was inevitable. The most interesting points were the songs sung in the film by Huw Priday. Beautiful sound. Could have had a bit more drama and less documentary feel would have improved it.,1483920000,,375,4.696969696969697

8023017,4,B00026L7Z4,"A wonderful documentary that stirs my spirit to hunger and thirst after God.  What it lacks in production value, it more than makes up in anointing: emotional and spiritual impact.",1346025600,,180,5.0
8023018,5,B00026L7Z4,"I love this documentary! I love God and this sets me ablaze anew. What Evan Roberts saw and did is what we need today. The video (DVD) is well done, and brings you close to the moment. Much of the dialog is in the words of Evan himself or his contemporaries and the current narrators do a good job of bringing you onto the scene. I can watch it over and over.",1290211200,5,359,4.0
8023019,4,B00026L7Z4,This is an informative video. It could be a little more exciting the way it was presented.,1258848000,,90,4.352941176470588

Anointed.
What more can I say?
ANOINTED!

Great gift for those who Love the LORD JESUS!

PLEASE see this documentary...if you have ever wanted to know just how much GOD will draw near to someone who tries to get closer to HIM and how much GOD can and Will change a society when asked in faith by HIS Children who seek HIM in HOLINESS ...
This is actually the story of Evan Roberts part in the revival more so than the actual revival.  So a better title may be: Evan Roberts a Key Figure of the 1904 Revival. Still much is covered about the revival. MANY factors which contributed to the Revial are given,and how it was an ochestrated moving of THE HOLY SPIRIT on various people of GOD is fascinating to see.

Evan Roberts life is INSPIRING. Your heart will burn with the HOLY Desire to be ever ever ever closer to Our Wonderful Loving FATHER...and for HIM to Come Down Here and REVIVE this land too!!!

My children, those I loan it to, and I have watched this DVD many times, will continue to do so,until JESUS comes again or the DVD gives out. :) At which time I'll need to get another.",1238544000,15,1106,4.323671497584541
8023021,5,B00026L7Z4,This was very informative and it moved my heart to see such a devoted young man desiring to walk in obedience to God.,1200182400,6,117,4.130434782608695
