7801350,5,1930034555,My 2 year old loves this dvd. He is learning prayers too. I accidentally broke the first one we had for years. However I am so pleased to find it on Amazon and much cheaper.,1519516800,,173,3.9714285714285715
7801351,3,1930034555,"I think the video is very cute, and I love hearing the different languages. The sound quality/volume seems to fade in and out. It reduces enjoyment when the sound is inconsistent.",1503792000,,179,4.806451612903226
7801352,5,1930034555,Very bright and colorful perfect for young children,1482451200,,51,5.5
7801353,1,1930034555,"This video is just WEIRD.  Yes, it gives several prayers in several different languages.  But... the images they show during the prayers are beyond bizarre.  A toy bunny.  Random statues.  A toy of Noah's Ark.  Creepy dolls.  A lava lamp.  A bobble-head Jesus.  Other very random objects and pictures.  It's like a bad acid trip.  Stay away.  No, wait...actually you should buy it just to see that I'm not exaggerating.",1453075200,,419,4.828571428571428
7801354,5,1930034555,"This is a very inspiring gift for any young child that is older for Baptism , or recieving first holy communion and I believe a must for teaching Catholic prayers for the faithfull to young children all inspiring and my grand daughter loves the upbeat and rejoice song ""give God the glory glory and Holy baby your the one!!!!",1417478400,,325,4.52542372881356
7801355,5,1930034555,"Our daughter just loves this DVD and asks for ""Holy Baby."" It is helping her to learn the sign of the cross and other prayers. I wish there were more songs on this DVD (there's about four)....otherwise, great product.",1383436800,,217,4.589743589743589
7801356,3,1930034555,"My son liked this more when he was younger, he is 15 months now and he loses interest half way through.  Also, I saw this on EWTN the other day and wish I could have just DVR'd it instead.  It is a good alternative to Baby Einstein, though, and great for babies under one.  I bought Part Two recently, and that is one of his favorite DVDs.  I recommend that one more for an older baby.",1254528000,,385,4.026315789473684
