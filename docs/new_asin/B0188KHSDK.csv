8741724,1,B0188KHSDK,"This hodge podge is apparently a rip off of a prior DVD, Yardbirds 1966-1968 / The Lost Tapes, but in this reissue, the producers didn't have the brains to proof read the back cover, which discusses the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.  There are very few ""live"" performances here.  And all of the performances here are available (with better fidelity I think) on the DVDs Having A Rave Up, Beat Beat Beat and the Story of the Yardbirds.  Too bad.  A nice DVD might have been made of what actual live footage is available, much of which has turned up on YouTube.",1481760000,,553,4.445544554455446

The sound is excellent, the picture is pretty good. Some performances are black and white and others in color. On the back of the box the 12 songs listed is what you get. All 12 are from different venues. At the bottom of the back of the box it says Nitty Gritty Dirt Band 1989 live performance, I have no idea what they are talking about or they are really mixed up. On the front of the box at the top it list 5 songs and many more. The only one on the disc is Train kept A Rollin. This is the Yardbirds with Jimmy Page. All the performances are from the 1960s. I think Jimmy Page is in all of the songs although several of the earliest performances where they all have short hair I cant tell if its Jimmy Page. In several of the songs Jimmy Page looks just like he does in Led Zeppelin, clothes and all.",1466640000,,824,4.061349693251533
