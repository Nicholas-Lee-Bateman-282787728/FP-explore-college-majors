4897727,5,B005VU9KW8,"This show/ BluRay is just like COPS but the Fireman version. It shows the guys out on fires,rescues, stuff like that and does Not show them how they really are at the Firehouse playing video games,eating,watching too much TV, and poking fun of each other for about 16 hours of the day!! So stop being a wus and buy this BluRay already!!! And why is this show still Not on the Air??",1338508800,5,381,4.305555555555555
