944983,2,6304872542,"...it really isn't very good.  Believe it or not, I'm actually a huge fan of season 22. But ""Timelash"" sticks out like nothing else. It's mostly the plot which is at fault - to be blunt, it's very weak, filled with dull action being extended beyond any sense of proper pacing. There might just be enough story to fill one 45 minute episode, but with two it's simply a sleep-inducer. Things are not helped by the faceless characters and the bad acting on the part of everyone save Colin Baker and perhaps Nicola Bryant and Paul Darrow. And let's not forget the substandard (and for DW no less!) production values either - I suppose from some standpoints they are amusing enough to keep the viewer awake. On the plus side, it's not very hard to understand. But I would definitely recommend any of the other season 22 stories on tape or DVD first, especially ""Vengenace on Varos"" or ""Revelation of the Daleks.""",923529600,3,907,4.598765432098766
944984,4,6304872542,"Let me start by saying that this story gets an undeserved bad rap from fans.  These fans, however, tend to make very good arguments.  They tend to say that Baker is bad, the plot is paper thin, the Borad comes back from  the dead one too many times, Herbert is annoying, Peri has nothing to do,  and on and on and......you get the idea.
All I have to say is...I liked  it anyway.  My opinion might be slightly biased because I can't see fit to  dislike anything Paul Darrow is in(Avon in Blake's 7, note my e-mail  address), even if he is playing Tekker a bit OTT. In continuing, I'm going  to put a bit of a spoiler in here, so if you haven't seen this story, I  would suggest you stop reading.
Anyway, my favourite part of this story  has to be the whole idea of Herbert being H.G. Wells, and how in reflecting  on the story, you can see the parallel's to Wells's 'The Time Machine'.  There is the whole futuristic society controlled by outside forces that  seems a bit similar, the Doctor Who character Vena and the Wells character  Weena, the Time Machine and the TARDIS, and most obviously the Morlocks who  are protrayed in both stories as evil underground dwellers.
As for the  Doctor Who part of the plot, see the first paragraph. This story has  obviously rubbed some people the wrong way, but I have always thought of it  as one of the better efforts from the Colin Baker era.",918000000,5,1386,4.364705882352941
944985,3,6304872542,This story has been smashed to bits by fans however I enjoyed it.  The  effects are decent but that does not make up for the weak plot.  Still a  decent video!  END,908409600,,164,4.0
7880174,2,6304872542,"I wish i could literally give this movie, or more direct the creators of this episode a legion of lashes.  I shouldn't be all too harsh though.  The episode does have its entertaining moments.  If your thinking about purchasing this episode i won't give too much away.  Colin Baker does a good job considering the circumstances and there is an interesting cameo of HG Wells.  That was one of the few highlights of the flic.  If your a die hard fan of The Doc, a pure bred Whovian, and or a true timelord, you'll find that this episode will entertain you.  A non-enthusiast of DW probably won't appreciate it very much.

7880175,2,6304872542,"Dr. Who fans are FUNNY people. They remind me of a but from Douglas Adams where Man proves that Black is White and goes on to get killed on the next Zebra Crossing.
If a story is massively popular, beautifully made, exciting, polished and spectacular, (Earthshock and Resurrection of the Daleks spring to mind) they will spend 20 years picking them to pieces tp PROVE that they are not nearly as perfect as everyone says and will finally convicne themselves that they were really just ""glossy, pointless, style over substance and full of holes"". They will never realise these arguments are pretty shaky (Um...ALL DR.WHO plots are pretty pointless and full of holes, even the ones with NO style! Pyramids of Mars, Robots of Death...what was the POINT of four episodes of being being strangled by killer robots/robot Mummies? Where was the SUBSTANCE in a mad alien demigod/mad scientist making the robots/mummies kill everyone?).
And yet...and this is the really OUTRAGEOUS bit...when a story is totally inept, incompetent, embarrassingly acted, directed and made, just one of the absolute worst, like Invasion of the Dinosaurs or this story, Time Lash, you will find Dr. Who fans giving it four stars and raving about how it was refreshingly different, innovative, filled with entertainment and basically defending it to the hilt. So, is this Timelash Substance without any Style?
Erm....NO! The truth is, Invasion of the Dinosaurs was not a masterpiece let down by dodgy FX, it was a better than average story that was let down very badly by terrible FX. It's fun to watch but you have to suspend your incredulity a LOT! It will never equal the quality of an Earthshock or Robots of Death in a pink fit! And neither will this.
Time lash is a very poor example of the series from the era of Colin Baker who was a pretty poor Doctor in many ways. BUT...I agree it has its moments. H G Wells is an inspired idea and well played...there's some good dialog and characterisation in the TARDIS. The plot has a bit of an old fashioned, harmless sense of fun and adventure that was largely absent during season 22. Small mercies! And Colin does have a certain appeal, it just takes a while to realise that behind the superficial over-acting, and ill-mannered pain in the neck persona, the Sixth Doctor's a nice guy putting up a bit of a front. Nice one.
It's not even in the same city as the same ball park as the best of 80s Who, but for cheap fun, it's passable. There are bits which are truly painful though, and Paul Darrow's campy, why-did-I-even-bother performance is, sadly, one of them. Bottom line, for true Baker fans only, coz this is not classic, not even close.",1081382400,,2665,4.733333333333333
7880176,1,6304872542,"Warning!!  If you are a novice or just starting your Doctor Who video/dvd collection, do not get Timelash! This is an appaling story. Badly written, badly directed, bad production, bad sets, bad acting and characters, bad everything!! The only redeeming value of this story is Paul Darrow and H.G. Wells in the story. But those are good drops in an ocean of turgid polluted stinking water! If I could give negative stars, it would be about -3. Doctor Who is a fun and imaginative series worthy of it's 26 year reign, but this is the bottom of pile. The tape probably has more value as a paperweight!",1037491200,3,599,4.598130841121495
7880177,3,6304872542,This is an Ok epidsode with the 6th Doctor and Peri.  Peri was good The Doctor had some good lines here and there.  But the acting from some of the actors was well....bad.  Only get this one if you are going to get the whole season.,1015804800,,232,4.0
7880178,4,6304872542,"As a Doctor Who fan, I am well aware of Timelash's ""bottom of the septic tank"" reputation in the show's history.  However, I've seen it many times without getting queasy in the brainpan.  And while it has its drawbacks, it isn't all that bad.
The story involves the Doctor and Peri's visit to Karfel, a planet first visited in an untelevised adventure by the Third Doctor, Jo, and Mike Yates.  There, they face the Borad, a brutal dictator in command of the title machine, a time corridor apparatus that sends those enemies, mostly imagined, to Scotland in 1179.
The Borad, a half Karfelon/half Morlox mutant, is one of the most imaginative villains I've seen in Who, with a chilling voice to match.  If anything, his explanation of his plight is one of the most interesting things in the whole story.
There are many events from the novelization that didn't make it to the televised story due to time and budget limits.  One was where the Doctor tossed a stake dipped in M80, hurled it at a Morlox creature, where it mutated into an amalgam of animal and wood tissue.  The other was a scene where Mykros and the Doctor discover that the Borad had made twenty-four clones of himself. A pity that one of those scenes couldn't have been used instead of the opening five minutes in Episode 1 of the Doctor and Peri arguing in the TARDIS.
Also missing is the Doctor's explanation of how the TARDIS survived the bendalypse warhead.  It involves use of the timeslip used to produce an afterimage and how the missile hit the image after the TARDIS returned to Karfel.  All we get here is, ""I'll explain someday.""
The one drawback is the sets, which seem too drab and claustrophobic.  As this was the penultimate story of Season 22, with more of the budget allocated to Revelation Of The Daleks, I suppose that was excusable.
What also sinks Timelash are the supporting characters, most of whom are unappealing or uninteresting.  JeanAnne Crowley as Vena and David Chandler as Herbert are exceptions.
Theres a scene where the Sixth Doctor smashes a portait of his third self to help Peri.  I felt a bit chagrined at this callous bit of destruction, as Jon Pertwee is my favorite Doctor Who.
Apart from Blake Seven's Paul Darrow as the weaselly Maylin Tekker, there's Steven Mackintosh as the ill-fated Gazak, who has appeared in one of the Cadfael episodes, starred in Lady Audley's Secret, Our Mutual Friend, A Dark Adapted Eye, and best known to American audiences as Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels' Winston.
Not a classic, to be sure, but not an absolute stinker.",997747200,8,2563,4.7114093959731544
7880179,2,6304872542,"This episode is one of the worst episode of Colin Baker's era! The time lash is full of tinsel, the androids are dumb, the borad is a lame bad guy! The costumes are OK , but for the aliens and the dinosaurs on the  planet itself!  One thing that good is they brought aboard H.G Wells for an  adventure with the Doctor! Other that is this a very easy episode to  forget in the series! Buy this if you need to have every video of the  series or of Colin Baker! For fans of the series ""Blake's 7"" Paul  Darrow guest stars as Tekker (the Borad's henchman)!",956188800,,552,4.11214953271028
7880180,1,6304872542,"Well, it's almost useless here to jump in at this point with my one star!  I think I'd give it half a star if I could!  ""Timelash"" is worth defending only for approximately a tenth of its bulk.  And everyone here is  already defending that tenth like mad!
It's clearly not a zero star  situation.  There is value.  It's slight entertainment to say the least,  though.  All the criticisms are available elsewhere on the net -- it  doesn't need to be said very loudly here, but... ""Timelash"" did  suck.
(Exceedingly poor production values combine with very badly acted  dozens of characters, miserable editting, and a story so unsatisfying it's  worth comparing to Baywatch.)
And I hope the Skarasen ate the Borad  immediately upon arrival in 1888.
To the unitiated, I'll make it as  plain as I can:  This is NOT the place to start one's Dr. Who videos  collection... ""Timelash"" is merely the least of the greatest tv  show of all time... For the sake of the health of public opinion, if you're  looking to enjoy this era of Doctor Who, please try on ""Revelation of  the Daleks"", ""The Caves of Androzani"", ""Vengeance on  Varos"", or ""Attack of the Cybermen"" first instead.",933552000,3,1169,4.688118811881188
