7420671,1,B014RD1ZEA,"Just wanted to say that I LOVE this series; however, if you purchase each season individually you only pay $50 bucks (and 3 out of 4 are blue ray)... if you buy the Complete Seasons 1 - 4 set, it's almost $70 used and over $100.00 new. Really? So why would I pay an extra $20.00 - $50.00 + more for all of them in a set? Do the math Amazon!",1471824000,,340,3.8028169014084505

8731651,5,B014RD1ZEA,"This series is extremely difficult to analyze because it is so unreal that it sounds untrue though we know it is particularly true, with a few mistakes.

The first mistake is that it is the government that has devised a way of taking control of everyone and every possible misdemeanor or crime, terrorist or not. It is private businesses, big private corporations plus some public services that have taken control of all communication between and among people. It is not so much for finding who is going to commit a crime, but rather in order to manipulate people into doing anything that will serve the interests of the private corporations or public services. These interests might be commercial to sell goods, or ideological to sell ideas that have nothing to do with truth or even reality but everything to do with reproducing and perpetuating a certain system of ideas that enables the people in power to remain there, be they CEOs, religious pundits or politicians.

The second mistake is that terrorist acts and attacks are not interesting as such to anyone, but people in power, particularly politicians, need these terrorist attacks to consolidate their security discourse that take control of the minds of people. At the same time, it enables the state to have strong security and investigating or intelligence services to prevent these terrorist attacks and thus to increase their prestige in society. Politicians are thus divided between an official public discourse about controlling terrorism and at the same time the need of such attacks or at least projects of attacks that could be thwarted to justify their power. This is rather clearly said here and there in a fuzzy way, centered on a female Secretary of Defense and a male Senator responsible for some security committee in the Senate, who are at least not very clear about their interest and are totally blind, deaf and oblivious of the interests of the people.

The third element that is underscored is the role of social networks that are in no way social but are in all possible ways blinding and manipulative. And thats where the load carried by the camel brings the camel down. These networks, within the net neutrality approach, are preaching the absolute freedom of expression stated by the first amendment of the US constitution. It is today, in 2017, and next year, in 2018, that the Senate, hence the government is requiring all big firms, companies and businesses dealing with social networks to control fake news and other manipulative free expression. The government is asking, requesting, demanding on the side of some Senators a full and effective censorship, that can only be implemented by a program that will ban all discourses that would contain some words like S** or F*** or S***. Not to speak of course of words like racism, communism, socialism, anarchism, race, black (why not, but of course not and never white), supremacy, segregation, discrimination, and many others. This is absurd since sentences like it is important to segregate nuclear molecules from non-nuclear molecules could be banned the same way as segregation between r***s brings violence down.

This US federal government is asking for what is practiced in China and many other countries, what is the law in France and other European countries where it is forbidden to establish any ethnic statistics since these are considered as racist and racism is a crime, banned as such in all public expression, meaning any expression in front of a third person who may report it: it could be your husband, or your children. We are not in science fiction. In France such facts are real and common. Any member of any family is supposed to do what any citizen is supposed to do: report something considered as criminal by the law: a son can come to the police and say My father, said yesterday all b****s are dark in their intentions and criminals by definition. This is obviously racist and the son is accepted even as a witness in a French court against a real crime that could follow such a private declaration in the family home. The Senate of the US is totally misled. Against fake news there is only one weapon: the truth but the truth is not always very fascinating, or agreeable, or simply flattering, I mean it does not flatter the basest instincts of man and women, of children too.

In the 1960s in France one popular joke was: In what country does the Hilton Hotel has room 171 next to room 48? The answer being Poland of course, Warsaw exactly, I have always wondered if this joke was anti-Polish or anti-American since the Hilton Hotel is an American chain. All ethnic jokes are of the same type. They might be of bad taste or even gross, but they exist all over the globe changing from one country to the next. One of these is the Parisian joke that makes a Parisian answer an American tourist who says: In America we have the longest rivers, the highest skyscrapers, the most comfortable hotels, etc. the following wise crack: For sure, but in Paris we have the fattest fleas in our hotels since they are feeding of the fattest tourists, that is to say American tourists. I have heard that one so often that after a while it is not funny anymore. And what about Who in a street fight has brought his electric razor? Dont tell me you do not know that one. And this How many . [often Irishmen but it could be anyone] are needed to change an electric bulb?

This series goes a lot that way but opposes a machine that is under the control of the state  but is it really?  to a samaritan that is under the control of some ambitious fascist people from private corporations. That is not what menaces our countries, nor by the way the alleged manipulation the Russians would have done in the US during the latest presidential campaign. What is at stake is that a campaign for the control of social networks comes today from the state and first of all from the Senate. They are trying to impose onto private corporations and the Internet the control  and we mean censorship  of free expression on their platforms.

The series is extremely interesting because of the great imagination it demonstrates. This imagination is probably a little bit trite and you will recognize many elements that have already been used in many other novels, short stories, films or series. It is what I could call composite imagination, but it is packed with action, violence, crimes, vicious and sordid perverts, though any sex is practically never shown. As an entertainment from 12 years of age onward, this series is good. As a work of the mind, a creative work of human imagination it is good though not that phenomenally creative. Too many special effects and not enough human depth. But the super bad ones hiding on the ninth (apocalyptic) floor of a mental institution is really a good idea: to desire becoming the next shadow and invisible Hitler you have to be deranged and you have to live in a permanent mental institution with no furlough or leave.

At the end of the fourth season, the cleaning up of Augeas stables is practically finished and suspense is suspended. It is only a few more episode to clean up the pigsty of the American political system based on corruption, authoritarianism and even soft everyday dictatorship.

8731652,5,B014RD1ZEA,I liked this series so much that I bought Seasons 1-4 for my brother and sister-in-law who also loved it.,1494115200,,105,4.3
8731653,3,B014RD1ZEA,"I actually purchased all 5 seasons individually for the better price as a gift for my wife.

Unfortunately, my TV broke and I had to watch on CBS dot com. I watched until CBS started showing only clips. I missed at least 2 1/2 seasons. I am so grateful that the series came out on Netflix and now thru Amazon. I was able to watch the entire series, including the 5th season, which I also purchased.

I loved this show. It is almost a modern day version of some of the old film noirs from the 30s and 40s. The series demonstrated in a very creative way what happens when something that was created to be beneficial to humans, can be used as a weapon in the wrong hands.

The cast was phenomenal. Jim Caviezel certainly proved that one can play other characters after playing Jesus and do them well.  Michael Emerson is an extraordinary good actor whose character had many subtle layers. Kevin Chapman is another brilliant actor whose character walked a thin line between being a bad cop and a good cop, and even used his badness to bring about a good outcome. Sarah Shahi's character proved that women can be beautiful and feminine, yet also be strong and capable of defending themselves in a heartbeat. Amy Acker's character was someone else who transformed over the course of the series. She kept the viewers in suspense until the end.
 Last but not least, Taraji Henson's character was that of a truly professional cop who also had compassion for those she dealt with, especially when it came to John Reese. There were many times, when she could have just followed the iron clad rules and locked Reese up, her character, above all was one who showed that computers are wonderful tools, but sometimes, what is needed is the ability to look beyond the surface and apply human compassion and wisdom.

My only somewhat negative view is when watching some of the special features, esp where Denise The was there. Every time someone mentioned her killing off one of the characters, she would get this sickly laugh going. I got the impression that she was a man-hater who was working to get Shaw and Root into a series of their own, not that it would be bad to have a spin off, but please, you do not have to kill off the stars of the show to do it.
This show will resonate for generations to come because of the world we are living in.",1476576000,,2567,4.905529953917051
