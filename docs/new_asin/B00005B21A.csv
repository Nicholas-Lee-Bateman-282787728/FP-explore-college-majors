1420112,5,B00005B21A,"My 13 month old son has seen every Baby Einstein video and loves the whole series.  He is especially fond of this one, because he is starting to be able to name the animals himself.(Okay, he calls kittys ""Meow,meow,meow"" but you get the idea  :)  It's a wonderful video for interaction, (Point to the screen and name the animals) or for some quiet time.",993340800,,353,4.484375
1420113,5,B00005B21A,My two year old has been a baby einstein fan pretty much since birth and this is definitely the best one yet! When the children start singing Old Macdonald my dauthter is singing along and never tires of it! Great job Julie Clark!!!,992217600,2,232,4.4186046511627906
1420114,5,B00005B21A,"My 6-month baby has been enjoying ""Baby Mozart"" since she was 4-month old. When I saw this video came out, I figured it should be just as good.  Haley laughs and smiles throughout the entire video; she especially likes the scenes with the puppets.  The quality of the video is great; the animals footages were excellently done.  There were even some clips of really interesting-looking bugs.  This video also teaches some words while relating them to real animals.  Occassionaly when it's hard to settle Haley down for feeding time, this video (and ""Baby Mozart"") was able to capture her attention so meal time can be more enjoyable.  Highly recommended.",992217600,3,654,4.954128440366972
1420115,5,B00005B21A,"I have bought almost all of Baby Einstein vedios, and this one is by far the best.  My two year old was facinated with it from beginning to end, probably the most entertaining 30 minutes for both of us.  What's really special about this vedio, is the quality of the animal photography, comparable to National Geographic style. And the abundance of different species protrayed with each animal; for cats alone, there were probably 10 different cats/kittens doing different cat things.  There is even cute little dog trick to spice up the presentation.  The puppet shows were short and smart and sweet, and toys in these animal forms were used between takes to strengthen the association and keeps it interesting for little minds.  I can't say enough about it, this is a definate must-have for children of all ages (including those with the child at heart) can enjoy on a magnitude level.",990144000,8,886,4.841059602649007

I thought it would give her a little entertainment for the long ride while hopefully being educational.  Fast forward two years, and she still enjoys it.  The footage of animals playing, running, hiding, eating, etc. is still enthralling to her, and we talk about how they live and what they do.  The puppet characters are cute, and she enjoys watching their antics too.  I highly recommend Baby Einstein products to anyone with small children.  With the success of this purchase, I subsequently bought five or six more of the Baby Einstein videos and couldn't be happier.",1364256000,4,725,4.76

1420211,5,B00005B21A,I mistakenly gave this vendor a negative review and I'd like to retract that.  Unfortunately I was working too fast when ordering and neglected to read what was available when I ordered this DVD.  It was my own fault that the DVD arrived without its jacket and in a paper sleeve; if I'd read further I would have been informed of this.  The DVD works fine and I'm very sorry that my first report was printed.  I would certainly order from this vendor again.,1345507200,,457,4.404761904761905

1420214,5,B00005B21A,The movie is entertaining for young children. It features several animals and keeps their attention. Lots of color and action. It is my nephew's favorite movie.,1322956800,,160,5.1923076923076925
1420215,5,B00005B21A,"This particular DVD teaches little ones about animals they are bound to encounter in the neighborhood, the farm, the river, etc. The DVD contains video images of animals as well as amusing puppets and interesting toys in action. There is no narrative to this DVD per se; it's simply an introduction to animals and corresponding words for each (the words are spelled out, so when you see an image of a cat, the word 'cat' appears on the screen and is pronounced outloud).

What I like:

--The DVD holds my 5-month old daughter's attention and, at times, even makes her giggle (she likes some of the puppets). This, in turn, allows me to catch up on chores without feeling guilty because I know she is exposed to something interesting and educational.
--The music, which is classical; the images, which I described in a previous paragraph; and, most of all, the fact the DVD plays in Spanish and French (besides English, of course). I speak Spanish to my daughter at home but constantly struggle to find  quality written or visual material for her, so this is truly a life saver. If you are interested in introducing your little one to a foreign language, this could be a good way to start, I think.
--A rather large variety of animals are introduced, which is wonderful if you are intested in expanding baby's experience of the natural world beyond 'doggy' and 'kitty.'

My hat's off to Baby Einstein. They are expensive but there's no denying they know what they're doing.",1290556800,,1472,4.715953307392996
1420216,1,B00005B21A,"This review is for those people who have never seen a baby Einstein DVD and wonder whether their baby would like it. Let me tell you, when I turned it on, I could not believe that such crap can have great reviews of 4.5 stars and I still don't understand why everyone raves about these.  It looks like someone high on something made this DVD with whatever they had near them, such as toys on strings, cheap plastic toys, then some real images of animals and a few shots of babies. I did not find the bug section of this DVD very appealing, maybe because I can't stand bugs of any kind. My baby (9.5 month girl) did not show any interest in this DVD at all, except for a minute when they were signing Old McDonald had a farm, a tune she recognized. We have not exposed her to TV all that much and perhaps she is not used to it, but from a parent's perspective, I did not find the DVD engaging at all. On another hand, a Classical Baby collection of DVD from HBO, I found sooo much better.  They had animation throughout and classical music on the background. If you live in NYC like I do, I suggest renting these from the library first (Queens public library has a huge selection of Baby Einstein and Classical baby dvds) just to make sure your baby like it.  I guess for those babies who have been exposed to TV since 3 months, they will watch anything on TV and maybe that's why they beg for these DVDs as someone wrote to be played for them. I am sorry if my post offends anyone whose baby loves this, but I am just sharing my experience and opinion.  I think I should have watched it first somewhere before purchasing a bunch of these, but I could not have imagines that it could be so terrible.",1289001600,3,1698,4.2153846153846155

1420233,1,B00005B21A,"Parents please be aware that the fact is The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under two be kept away from screen media. These products are claiming benefits that are utterly unfounded.

Also know that many studies show that the more television children under five watch the less likely they are to engage in creative play. (DVDS being basically the same thing).

 Dimitri Christakis the director of the Child Health Institute at the University of Washington quoted in the book Parenting Inc, states: ""Based on the research I have done there is reason to believe these products (DVDs for babies and toddlers) have a deleterious  (negative) effect on the developing mind"" , ""TV, DVDS and video games condition the developing brain to expect a very high, unnatural level of input. Real life by comparison becomes boring"".

Another quote, again from Parenting Inc."" ""There is no research to show that watching a screen is beneficial to a baby in any way, educational or otherwise. If anything it may be putting babies at risk"" ""A two dimensional screen can never replace a real environment, rich in all five senses. Holistic play is what  develops the all the pathways to the brain."" Alvin Poussaint, child psychiatrist  and director of the Media Center of Judge Baker's Children Center in Boston.

Please think twice about buying DVDS for a baby or toddler. Do the research, it's not a good idea. Stick to the old fashioned toys that engage kids in creative play - blocks, balls etc.",1253750400,16,1503,4.936507936507937

1420235,5,B00005B21A,"We absolutely love this Baby Einstein DVD. My mother-in-law had bought a box set of Baby Einstein DVD's for my first daughter. She really wasn't interested in any of the movies except Neighborhood Animals and World Animals. She would watch them over and over again. They kept her interest no matter how many times she watched. She actually liked watching them until she was pushing 4 years old. My second daughter, who is now 16 months, has had no interest in watching anything on TV. She is also a baby that does not talk much and tends to be rather quiet. We still had the Baby Einstein DVD's so we tried some. She absolutely loves the Neighborhood Animals and World Animals. It is the only thing she has ever watched on TV. She gets so excited when we turn it on and she 'talks' to the animals on the TV, imitates sounds, and is now trying to say the animal names. She loves the DVD so much she actually will bring us the remote and point to the TV or she'll bring us the DVD box to tell us she wants to watch. The movie has great music, simple graphics, and adorable puppets. I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a toddler.",1250380800,,1139,4.352112676056338

Disney offers refund after furor over Baby Einstein DVDs
Chris Ayres in Los Angeles

Millions of American parents who bought Disney educational DVDs in the hope that they would supercharge their children's brains are being offered a refund amid claims by researchers that watching any kind of television may be harmful to the under-twos.

Disney continues to defend its bestselling Baby Einstein DVD range but is now offering money back on up to four DVDs returned per US household. The move comes after a parents' group threatened to sue the company. Critics are now demanding that Disney should offer a similar deal in the UK, where Baby Einstein's Baby Mozart Music Festival is the topselling DVD in Amazon's Childcare & Parenting section.

Launched in 1997, Baby Einstein DVDs quickly became a marketing sensation. Parents could suddenly congratulate themselves on exposing their little ones to everything from classical music to Romantic poetry.

When it was first released, the packaging of one Baby Einstein DVD, entitled Baby Wordsworth, designed for children as young as 1, advised parents that it could ""foster the development of your toddler's speech and language skills"".

  * `Technology for toddlers' risks screen-addiction

  * DVDs are a baby brain-drain

Many academics took the opposite view. One study, published by The Journal of Pediatrics and conducted by researchers at the University of Washington, concluded that for every hour per day spent watching baby DVDs, infants understood on average six to eight fewer words than children who did not watch television. One researcher, Dimitri Christakis, concluded that ""the evidence is mounting that [baby-targeted DVDs] are of no value and may in fact be harmful"".

It is thought that Disney generates about $200million (125million) a year in sales from its Baby Einstein division, which it acquired in 2001. Criticism of Baby Einstein has become vocal, however, largely thanks to an organisation in Boston called the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC).

""Parents need honest information,"" said Susan Linn, the co-founder of the CCFC, when she filed a complaint in 2006 with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleging that Disney was engaging in ""false and deceptive advertising"" through its Baby Einstein packaging.

Although the FTC brought no action against it, Disney toned down its marketing. Then came its offer of a refund, amid talk of the CCFC preparing a class-action lawsuit. On the Baby Einstein website yesterday, Susan McLain, the general manager, accused the CCFC of seeking to ""twist and spin a simple customer satisfaction action into a false admission of guilt"".

No Einstein in Your Crib? Get a Refund
By TAMAR LEWIN

Parent alert: the Walt Disney Company is now offering refunds for all those ""Baby Einstein"" videos that did not make children into geniuses.

They may have been a great electronic baby sitter, but the unusual refunds appear to be a tacit admission that they did not increase infant intellect.

""We see it as an acknowledgment by the leading baby video company that baby videos are not educational, and we hope other baby media companies will follow suit by offering refunds,"" said Susan Linn, director of Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, which has been pushing the issue for years.

Baby Einstein, founded in 1997, was one of the earliest players in what became a huge electronic media market for babies and toddlers. Acquired by Disney in 2001, the company expanded to a full line of books, toys, flashcards and apparel, along with DVDs including ""Baby Mozart,"" ""Baby Shakespeare"" and ""Baby Galileo.""

The videos -- simple productions featuring music, puppets, bright colors, and not many words -- became a staple of baby life: According to a 2003 study, a third of all American babies from 6 months to 2 years old had at least one ""Baby Einstein"" video.

Despite their ubiquity, and the fact that many babies are transfixed by the videos, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no screen time at all for children under 2.

In 2006, Ms. Linn's group went to the Federal Trade Commission to complain about the educational claims made by Disney and another company, Brainy Baby. As a result, the companies dropped the word ""educational"" from their marketing. But the group didn't think that was enough.

""Disney was never held accountable, and parents were never given any compensation. So we shared our information and research with a team of public health lawyers,"" Ms. Linn said.

Last year, lawyers threatened a class-action lawsuit for unfair and deceptive practices unless Disney agreed to refund the full purchase price to all who bought the videos since 2004. ""The Walt Disney Company's entire Baby Einstein marketing regime is based on express and implied claims that their videos are educational and beneficial for early childhood development,"" a letter from the lawyers said, calling those claims ""false because research shows that television viewing is potentially harmful for very young children.""

The letter cited estimates from The Washington Post and Business Week that Baby Einstein controlled 90 percent of the baby media market, and sold $200 million worth of products annually.

The letter also described studies showing that television exposure at ages 1 through 3 is associated with attention problems at age 7.

In response, the Baby Einstein company will refund $15.99 for up to four ""Baby Einstein"" DVDs per household, bought between June 5, 2004, and Sept. 5, 2009, and returned to the company.

Lawyers in the matter refused to comment on the settlement.

Last month, Baby Einstein announced the new refunds -- or ""enhanced consumer satisfaction guarantee"" -- but made no mention of the lawyers' demands.

""Fostering parent-child interaction always has and always will come first at The Baby Einstein Company, and we know that there is an ongoing discussion about how that interaction is best promoted,"" Susan McLain, vice president and general manager, said in the statement. ""We remain committed to providing a wide range of options to help parents create the most engaging and enriching experience for themselves and their babies.""

The founder and president of Brainy Baby, Dennis Fedoruk, said in an e-mail message that he was unaware of Baby Einstein's refund announcement and could not offer further comment.

An outside public relations representative for Baby Einstein said there was nothing new about the refund offer.

""We've had a customer satisfaction guarantee for a long time,"" she said, referring a reporter to the company Web site. However, Baby Einstein's general ""money-back"" guarantee is only valid for 60 days from purchase and requires a receipt.

In contrast, the current offer, allowing parents to exchange their video for a different title, receive a discount coupon, or get $15.99 each for up to four returned DVDs, requires no receipt, and extends until next March 10.

""When attention got focused on this issue a few years ago, a lot of companies became more cautious about what they claimed,"" said Vicky Rideout, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""But even if the word `education' isn't there, there's a clear implication of educational benefits in a lot of the marketing.""

The Baby Einstein Web site, for example, still describes its videos with phrases like ""reinforces number recognition using simple patterns"" or ""introduces circles, ovals, triangles, squares and rectangles.""

""My impression is that parents really believe these videos are good for their children, or at the very least, not really bad for them,"" Ms. Rideout said. ""To me, the most important thing is reminding parents that getting down on the floor to play with children is the most educational thing they can do.""",1214611200,6,7935,5.2075471698113205
1420255,5,B00005B21A,My daughter says that my 3 year old grandson absolutely adores Baby Einstein videos.  This was one I sent to a friend with a 2 year old baby girl and she reported that the baby enjoyed naming all the animals. It keeps their interest--even if it might be a tad boring and repititious for adults.,1208995200,,294,4.345454545454546
1420256,3,B00005B21A,"If you're going to buy a children's video, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child.  I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.

Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to BABIES.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely NOT for babies' brains!

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1200355200,,1925,4.928792569659443

There was not much speaking or much music (especially in the beginning).

Of particular interest to and approval from me is the use of Classical music, although played on glockenspiels and electronic synthesizers (not the original instruments the music was written for) is excellent, in exposing young children to music of substance and quality while going with a story line about domestic animals.  Music of Beethoven, Rimsky-Korsakov and Domenico Scarlatti are represented, as well as other composers I cannot recall at the moment.

The scene shifts frequently: appropriate for a young child.  The music serves the visuals, and is effective.

It covers interesting information about each animal, like cows having 4 stomachs or penguins being birds that cannot fly.. etc And besides the traditional groupings of house animals, animals in the water, etc.. it covers more interesting groupings, like "" animals with furry faces, animals with stripes and dots, unusual animals, the animal alphabet..etc"" It is simply the best and caters to all ages.

1420389,1,B00005B21A,"I received this as a gift and regret opening the box because now I cannot return it.  This video is no different from the other kinds of television that hinder child development.  If you really want to help your children, read to them, take them for a walk to point out neighborhood animals or have your children play with blocks and other fun toys.  Children need to develop their spatial skills and eye-hand coordination -- watching television will not help your children at all.
If you need to take a shower, buy an extra Graco exersaucer and put it in the bathroom.  Your child, like mine, will play while you can have a few minutes to yourself -- and you can keep an eye on her.  If you need longer periods of time, join a playgroup or sign up for a mommy's day out program.  Your children will benefit from interacting with other children and perhaps even develop friendships while you get a chunk of time to run errands or perhaps take a much-needed nap.
The American Association of Pediatrics recommends NO television for children age 2 or younger.  See AAP's website [...] for more details on why television is bad for your child.",1076976000,11,1139,4.553921568627451

I have to mark this one down a little, as it is not as well put together as earlier ones like Baby Mozart and Baby van Gogh.
The footage of the animals is excellent, and very educational in helping children learn to identify neighbourhood animals as well as other animals.  (I have cows and horses, but no otters in my neighbourhood.)  The sequences with the swan and ducks in water are outstanding.
I didn't like the beginning with the cow with wings, even though it was a cute puppet.  My son asked me what it was, and why the cow had wings, and is now on the lookout for flying pink cows.
He identifies with the naughty mice who throw food around, and advises the mommy mouse to give them a time-out.
The Pavlov puppet skits between animals are too long and monotonous, and the little skits with the other puppets are sometimes confusing, like when the frog is barking, and then quacks, which makes the duck bark instead of quack.  The puppetry is also a little below the usual standard.

He does seem to like the children singing ""Old McDonald's Farm.""
I, however, have a few issues with this video.  I have to wonder if young children/toddlers find it confusing when Pavlov the Dog makes cow, cat, pig, etc. sounds.  My son is learning which animals make which sounds, but here's this dog mooing and oinking and meowing.  I also have to wonder if it is a good idea to show toddlers the clip of the mice having a food fight.  I have a hard enough time getting my son to keep his food on his tray!  My final gripe is: why include the otter?  Why not a fish as an example of an animal on the river?  Certainly more familiar to youngsters, I would think.

We really enjoy the Baby Know-It-All series for carla, our 9 month old, and Zaboomafoo for Devon, our 2 year old.",1011052800,,461,4.411764705882353
1420457,5,B00005B21A,"My son (10 months) and my niece (14 months) both love this video.  (They love World Animals as well.)  They both sit through it, and will come crawling/walking when they hear the intro music.  I think it's very educational, and good entertainment too.  And the flash cards are a great way to follow up after watching the DVD!",1009756800,2,325,4.551724137931035
1420458,5,B00005B21A,"My son has been watching the Baby Einstein series since he was about 6 weeks old. We have been playing music for him and dancing with him since he has been born.  He has been walking for 2 months and is quite the dancer!  He adores this video.  He is also very fond of the other videos in the series.  I can put it on and he will be entertained for the full length of the film.  He will ask for it to be played again (he says ""mo"" and points to the TV).  The second time around he will start to loose his concentration, but when he hears something familiar he runs to the TV to catch the scene.
We especially love the Old McDonald sequence.  It has a great beat and he loves to dance and sing along!
I don't (think) that this video drags along nor that the dog is boring (my son loves the dog and laughs at him).  I also think the children in the film are very cute and add to the content.",1008979200,,889,3.9273743016759775
1420459,5,B00005B21A,"My 19-month old son loves the Baby Dolittle Neighborhood Animals DVD.  After a couple of viewings he began saying the animal names that he did not already know.  He laughs, jumps, and dances to the video.  He also now predicts the next scenes in the video.  Overall, it is entertaining and a good learning tool for him.  Lastly, it is bearable for the parents, and since we don't have to rewind, it makes it easy to watch over and over.",1008633600,,436,4.4
1420480,5,B00005B21A,"My daughter loved Baby Dolittle Neighborhood Animals and World Animals from the time she was 14 months to about 22 months.  She loved the puppets and the real life pictures really held her attention.  Learned a lot about animals and these videos really helped her to recognize a lot of different animals.
She didn't seem as interested in this video as much as the Baby Bach and Baby Mozart videos before 14 months.  She would get bored with the real life video parts until she was a little older.  But as she got closer to 1 and 1/2 she started to lose interest in the Baby Bach and Baby Mozart videos and started to like the Baby Dolittle ones the most.",1006214400,10,654,4.380165289256198
1420481,4,B00005B21A,My daughter is 19 months old and this is consistently one of her favorite videos.  It's been a great tool for helping her identify and learn the names and sounds of a variety of animals.  And she likes to twirl to the music.  It's always a treat to watch it together.,1004054400,,267,4.196078431372549
1420482,5,B00005B21A,"I expected this video to be as good as Baby Mozart, and I wasn't disappointed. It's a little more advanced than Baby Mozart and encourages reading of simple animal words (dog, cat, etc.) My grandchildren like the animals, both real and toy.  They especially liked the puppets.  I would recommend it for children 2-5 yrs.",1002758400,6,320,4.8
1420483,5,B00005B21A,"We used the baby Bach and baby Mozart videos when our 7 month old was younger and she loves them, but Neighborhood Animals is her all time favorite.  She sits in her walker and watches the animals and even tries to talk to them.  She gets excited when the pupets/animals make sounds and loves the music. She smiles and starts making her little baby sounds everytime she see Pavlov the dog.  We used to put her in her swing and let her watch Bach or Mozart while we get ready for work in the A.M.  But with this video she got so excited in the swing that we had to put her on the floor or in her walker!  Even though the age recommendations are 1 yr to 4 yr I highly recommend it for younger babies.  I took the video over to the sitters and she said all the kids liked it and watched intently.  (the ages are 8mth, 7mth, 5mth and 2 years!)  I'm not a big fan of sitting my daughter in front of the TV; however, when both parents work and you need to buy a little time in the morning this is the greatest!  I hope your children love it as much as my daughter does!",1002585600,65,1063,4.0

1420485,5,B00005B21A,"I'm not a big fan of TV for my kids--I have two: a two year-old and an eight month-old--but I must say I approve of the Baby Einstein series.  And the Doolittle video is great.  The music is calming and soothing to both kids, and it doesn't annoy me.  We actually sit down together to watch this video.  We have plenty of time to chat about what we see together, too.  Both kids love it!",999820800,3,387,4.1066666666666665
1420486,5,B00005B21A,"My 20 month old loves this video, as he does the others in this series.  Each night at bedtime, I allow him to watch one of the tapes - the music and animation tend to calm him and the muppets and animals stimulate his language development.  Baby Dolittle is one of his favorites!  Whomever did the research in producing these videos is indeed an Einstein!",998265600,4,356,4.446153846153846
1420487,5,B00005B21A,"Now that my little boy is learning about animals I thought this would be a good introduction for him.  I was right he will watch it all the way through, he is not one for sitting for very long.  The animals scenes are very well shot and it has taught him about bugs and otters as well as his favorites like the dog, ducks and cats.  I recommend this video for one year and up.  It is fun!",997747200,3,388,3.9358974358974357
1420488,5,B00005B21A,"Definitely the cutest and innovative video so far! My 1 1/2 year old loves it (and it doesn't annoy me either!) It features animals & the usual puppets, plus it holds attention, as with the rest of the series! I recommend this one!",996451200,3,231,4.395348837209302
