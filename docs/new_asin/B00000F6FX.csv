1203925,4,B00000F6FX,"Enjoyed seeing the movie Sweet Lorraine. It brought back memories when I was a kid staying in the Heiden Hotel (Sweet Lorraine). Now that the Heiden Hotel has burnt down, I can still have fond memories of still seeing the hotel whenever I watch Sweet Lorraine. The main charactors, Lillian & Sam were true to life and wished they could have saved the Sweet Lorraine.",1214697600,2,366,4.6461538461538465
1203926,1,B00000F6FX,"I've just found joy....I'm as happy as a baby boy...Finally! I have waited for a decade and a half for this film to get a digital release. I've written letters to Angelika...all without response. And here it is...with a completely inappropriate cover! Don't let the bad cover put you off. This is a great film. It pays homage to the end an era that is sadly no longer around. (I know this for sure...a few years ago, I went on a pilgrimage to the location of filming, The Heiden Hotel. Even then, it was in very sad shape. I recently read that it was sold and I have no doubt that it will be razed.)

But here, on film, the Heiden lives on as the wonderful Hotel Lorraine. Directed by the son-in-law of the Heiden's owners, Sweet Lorraine celebrates the final season of a decades old Catskill resort. It hosts a gaggle of future stars before they became regular faces on shows like The Sopranos, Sex and the City, and Remember When as well as the wonderful Maureen Stapleton as hotelkeeper, Lillian Garber.

Perhaps the best reason to view this film is that it captures summer...starting with the anticipation of Memorial Day and Molly's eagerness to join the family business to the somberness of Labor Day and the developer's final offer. It overflows with affection for the era and for the subject. If you have a sweet spot for summer vacations and nostalgia, this is the film for you.

I've seen Sweet Lorraine over 50 times and I've worn out 3 vhs tapes. I've shown it to my high school students in Japan. I've ripped the theme song and put it on my iPod. OK...so maybe you won't go as far over the top as I did, but you'll be happy you spent the summer at Sweet Lorraine.

I ADDED A NEW REVIEW AFTER RECEIVING THIS DVD WHICH AMAZON HAS SINCE DELETED. THIS DVD HAS BEEN MASTERED SO POORLY IT QUALIFIES AS THE WORST DVD I'VE EVER SEEN. MY OLD WORN VHS COPIES LOOK AND SOUND BETTER THAN THIS DVD. THE PICTURE HAS BEEN MASTERED WITH A VERY OVEREXPOSED, HARSH APPEARANCE. THE AUDIO, ADDITIONALLY, HAS BEEN MASTERED WITH A VERY HEAVY TREBLE EMPHASIS WHICH GIVES IT AN ANNOYING BRASSY QUALITY. AS MUCH AS I LOVE THIS FILM, MY ADVICE TO ANYONE WOULD BE TO BUY A USED VHS COPY AND

AVOID THIS DVD.",1174953600,12,2193,4.431761786600497
1203927,2,B00000F6FX,"This is one of those rare gems - a vast ensemble cast of excellent performers, all creating individual, and quite believable characters in a bittersweet story of the last days of a summer hotel.  Maureen Stapleton is outstanding as she always was, but the rest of the cast is not to be forgotten either.  There's no action as such, except for a great scene of a baseball game, because the film is well focused on characterization. Who needs noise and action in every film?  This should be on DVD!  You won't regret watching this one if you care about people. Rates 5 stars (even though Amazon only registers 2 - I gave it 5!  Must be a technical glitch.). See it.",1159660800,7,663,4.446280991735537
1203928,1,B00000F6FX,"The final season of a Catskill hotel that has seen its best days provides the framework for this film, featuring Maureen Stapleton as the owner who must decide whether or not to sell, Trini Alvarado as her granddaughter who wishes to soldier on as a partner, and a raft of others performing as employees of the hotel whose activities comprise numerous subplots. The work is highly episodic, but most scenes are permitted to pass with virtually no development, leading to a rather downbeat feeling in the viewer, with the significance of reminiscence for the players being largely unappreciated; an entirely unfocussed exercise.",1107993600,,627,5.1568627450980395
1203929,1,B00000F6FX,"Halfway through ""Sweet Lorraine,"" I found myself muttering ""Sweet Jesus - who thought there was a movie here?"" It looks like the cast simply found a Catskills resort that would let them shoot on location in return for renting out some rooms, and the cast tried to improvise a story (and not successfully). An embarrassment for everyone involved.",1028678400,,345,4.9655172413793105

7907115,2,B00000F6FX,"The picture quality is poor.  It appears to have been recorded from an EP VHS copy.  The picture is so poor that it is difficult to even identify faces.  The movie itself has always been one I enjoyed, but did not have a copy on DVD.  The poor quality picture takes the enjoyment out of watching it.",1399161600,,299,4.192982456140351
7907116,5,B00000F6FX,"Having grown up in the Catskills and experienced everything from the highest class resorts like Grossinger's to the lowest bungalow colony, I can attest to the reality of this movie.  It has all the period and emotional pieces down to perfection.  The downbeat ending can be seen as a eulogy for a period past its prime and since long gone.  DIRTY DANCING was typical Hollywood gloss: FOOTLOOSE set in a different world.  This movie presents how it really was.  Heartwarming, nostalgic and historical.",1388275200,3,501,4.9879518072289155
7907117,5,B00000F6FX,"If you ever stayed (or had older relatives) who stayed in the old resorts of the Catskill area of New York state.... you'll love this film.  A sweet fictional story about the family members and young people who keep an aging, traditional Jewish family resort going for one last summer.  This is the rare movie that I recalled viewing almost two decades ago and finally found on DVD.  Well worth the purchase price.",1368057600,5,414,4.6438356164383565
7907118,5,B00000F6FX,I love this movie and wanted a good copy of it. It is rather hard to find. I have a VHS tape that had become unplayable. This product was stated to be in very good condition and indeed it was. It played perfectly. I am very happy with this purchase.,1359676800,2,249,4.0
7907119,3,B00000F6FX,"This movie is a good story, especially if you like the Catskill Mountains in New York and its storied hotel history, or grew up there.  But be warned, it is very very sad in the ending.",1284249600,,185,4.138888888888889
7907120,5,B00000F6FX,"Sweet, real, and engaging.  If there were movie justice, this film would have far more attention than the artificial ""Catskill"" story, DIRTY DANCING.  Buy it before it disappears and be a real movie maven.",1281830400,,205,5.0

Anyone, like myself, who remembers the borscht belt era in the Catskills will really enjoy this film. I loved it and have seen many times over.  It's authentic and realistic to the core!  I treasure it and own my own copy of the film. i remember the Heiden Hotel (The Lorraine) in South Fallsburg, NY, and will always remember it very dearly and have this movie if i want to ""go back and visit"".
