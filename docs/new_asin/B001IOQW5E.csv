8311211,4,B001IOQW5E,"Nanaka 6/17 is an interesting anime that I feel many people will overlook. Which is not surprising given the generic plot descriptions and rather simple premise. However what I personally like most about Nanaka is one part nostalgia from watching it when I was younger, and two parts intrigue. Nanaka 6/17 starts off in a generic fashion, however it quickly becomes aparent that this show has a slightly more darker tone than most would expect...
This is a story about the anxieties of being young and knowing nothing, and the fears of responsibility while growing up... Nanaka 6/17 is by no means perfect, and it isn't for everyone, but it has this odd relatability to it... You understand the problems, and the reasons for why they exist. You understand the miscommunication and turmoil even if it can be a bit bizzare.

It's hard to explain my feelings about this show...

I had forgotten about this show for the longest time, until  suddenly, almost out of nowhere, I remembered it, and I realized how much I liked this show, and how desperate I was to rewatch it.
Rewatching the show now, years later, made me realize that the show itself is rather forgettable, but also it somehow still manages to keep a powerful message at its core... It's not the funniest anime, nor is it the darkest... but it's still something worth a watch if you're looking for a forgotten gem.",1522454400,,1374,4.716666666666667

8311213,5,B001IOQW5E,"I just finished watching this show and I loved it . I didn't think I'd like it but after watching the first episode I was hooked . Nanaka 17 is an unliked loner who suffers a mental trauma then reverts to her 6 year old self who thinks she has physically grown older from a magic wish. Nanaka 6 is so adorable everyone loves her except the girls in her class who think she's acting to get the boys to like her. Nanaka's character draws you in theres plenty of laughs and tugs on your heartstrings. You won't be disappointed with this series. I just wish there was more of it , I liked it that much.",1272585600,5,598,4.119658119658119
8311214,5,B001IOQW5E,"I THINK THIS SERIE IS FUNNY,I REALLY ENJOY IT. THIS ANIME IS ABOUT THE MEANING OF GROWING UP. NANAKA JUST TRY TO RUN AWAY FROM HERSELF BY STUDY SO HARD, SHE TRY TO GROW UP FAST BUT THE REAL POINT IS... WHY?",1231804800,,206,3.9285714285714284
8311215,3,B001IOQW5E,"I've seen the premis for this anime a number of times but mostly in American movies and TV. The 1st episode is a bit slow to get going but after that things do improve. This could turn into gushy & annoying or things could get better as the series progresses. It was good enough to make me want to see more but only ""just"".",1151971200,,323,4.0625
8311216,3,B001IOQW5E,"Nanaka and Nenji have known each other for most of their young 17-year old lives. They were best friends up until the time they entered high school. At that time Nanaka became a bit of a goody-two-shoes, who left all her childish ways behind to focus on her academics at the expense of any sort of social life. Nenji, on the other hand, became a disrespectful thug. He's always dressed sloppily and he always seems to be getting into fights. As far as Nanaka can see, Nenji's life is going nowhere and she never wastes an opportunity to tell him her opinion, which infuriates Nenji to no end. When she slips down some rain-soaked stairs in the midst of a heated argument and is knocked unconscious, Nenji fears the worst. When she comes to in the hospital, Nanaka does not recall the accident. Worse yet, she has reverted to her 6 year old self, having no memories of her life after that! The only rationalization this little girl can come up with is a memory of imitating her anime idol Magical Domiko and wishing herself to transform into an adult. She believes this wish succeeded, thereby explaining her situation. It's up to Nenji to help her continue her life at school until she reverts back to normal...if that ever happens. But it's not going to be easy. Surely everyone will notice the abrupt personality change in Nanaka who overnight goes from cold and haughty college aspirant to childish Magical Domiko fan! And what will happen when she challenges Amemiya, a piano prodigy, at her usual role of playing at choir recitals. Nanaka actually thinks she can use magic to play. And it seems like Amemiya has a crush on Nenji!

This first volume of Nanaka was decent but nothing great. It seems a little more heartfelt than other anime of this ilk. You can really sense the bond and love between Nenji and Nanaka. Amemiya seems like an interesting character but too much of a shojo whiny heroine. A gangbanger rival of Nenji and his samurai wanna-be sister injects an unwelcome dose of cliche into the show which would best be left out. Hopefully, this series is short because I can tell over time the sweetness could drain out, leaving only annoying little girl child voices echoing in your head.",1148860800,3,2205,4.653846153846154
