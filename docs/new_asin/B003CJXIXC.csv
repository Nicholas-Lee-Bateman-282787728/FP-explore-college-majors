8394301,1,B003CJXIXC,"My wife picked up a used copy at blockbuster for 99 cents and I don't think that was a very good deal.

I feel bad saying this, because I try to say something positve about all artists who put themselves on the line to create something, but the screenplay is truly awful. I found the writing appallingly undisciplined and amateurish, and after walking into the room and watching a couple of scenes, my wife groaned, ""the dialogue is so terrible!"" and she walked out.

I did watch the film until the end, and I would give Chaz Palimenteri's and Linda Fiorino's performances each a solid 3 to 4 stars.

Why did this film ever get made? It makes me suspicious of indie films in general, and makes me not want to go to the sundance festival, ever.

But maybe the point is to give new writers a chance to grow, and maybe this writer, over time, will get better. But that doesn't mean you shuld watch this movie.",1311033600,,906,4.375

1 Disc Widescreen Edition, 104 Minutes running time, being released on June 29, 2010

""Once More With Feeling"" was directed by Jeff Lipsky and written by Gina O'Brien. It stars Chazz Palminteri as Frank Gregorio, a psychiatrist and big-time family man who is re-introduced into music through the world of karaoke after a patient's mentioning of it. His boyhood dream of becoming a professional vocalist comes back alive amidst his Italian-American family members each having their own issues.

His oldest daughter, Lana played by Drea de Matteo is having a mid-life crisis feeling old with personal image and contemplating plastic surgery to fix all her minor imperfections. Linda Fiorentino plays Lydia who is a lounge singer. Frank's youngest daughter is getting ready for her wedding and just had braces put on which makes all of her dialogue come out funny. The granddaughter's antics and honesty drive everyone crazy, Frank's wife is becoming very worried about his new goals, and his father is getting on in years.

Frank becomes fixated on the idea of singing for his youngest daughter's wedding and starts hitting karaoke bars and walking around with his granddaughter's singing machine that she received as a gift for her birthday. Eventually he even tries karaoke therapy with an older woman patient who has refused to speak for eight weeks. It goes beyond the wedding when he hears talk of a big singing contest and since Lydia spends more time with him and Frank's family takes notice.

Chazz Palminteri gives an earnest performance, though not a passionate one which is surprising given how inspired he is supposed to be by his reawakening to music again. Palminteri is most often saved for stock characters due to his look and line delivery, so it is refreshing to see him in a lead role.

However, the most interesting actor to watch would be Drea de Matteo. She has a cell phone almost attached to her ear at all times which results in a chance meeting with a police officer leaving her contemplating the idea of an affair which she quickly nixes after suspecting her father of infidelity. She has the most energy out of everyone in the cast.

This movie is ok, but it's a lackluster story of emotional growth of each member of a family going on their personal journey, some of which are more interesting than others.
