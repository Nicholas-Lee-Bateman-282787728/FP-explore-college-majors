350167,5,6301697758,"This Good Cop vs Bad Cop thriller is very good, Richard Gere shows his nasty side as a corrupt police officer that will do anything to keep his life from becoming complicated, he has racketering operatons & money laundering operations, & can for the right price arrange murders & cover it up very nicely, he is also a womanizer that somehow manages to have a married life that looks on the surface pretty normal,that is until Garcia, a newly promoted Internal Affairs officer begins investigating Gere's partner on an unrelated incident, feeling threatened, Gere begins to complicate things thus giving Garcia suspicion about Gere's involvement with certain shady individuals, when guilt begins to get the best of Gere's partner, he is killed in a setup orchestrated by Gere, Garcia sensing that Gere had it done begins to investigate deeper, thus beginning a cat & mouse game between the two, Gere fully aware of Garcia's determination begins a series of distractions, one involving Garcia's wife who has a meeting with Gere who is pretending to be Garcia's boss, knowing that he is being watched, Gere gives Garcia the illusion that it is an affair, & completly makes Garcia question his wife's loyalty, thus distacting him from his investigation, when Garcia learns the truth, he goes after Gere with everything he has got, although the ending is somewhat out there, this is a good police thriller that is at times terrifying to think about, the possibilities of police officers leading this kind of life is scary & Gere is very convincing as the twisted cop, as is Garcia as the determined investigator who vows to bring Gere down. If you like good police drama, this is highly recommended!!",1005264000,10,1695,4.93006993006993
350168,4,6301697758,"INTERNAL AFFAIRS IS RICHARD GERE'S BEST MOVIE!  And it might be Andy Garcia's best movie, too!  There are a ton of good subplots, lots of good character actors, plenty of realism including Gere as handsome cop Dennis Peck being able to get any woman he wants--and all at the same time!--and good music, too!
  But Richard Gere as a villain is what makes this movie sizzle, and this is the best I've ever seen him, with a full range of emotions from hate to lust to humor, and the only Richard Gere movie worth watching twice!

350169,1,6301697758,what a mess of a film.and how times has Richard Gere and countless other Actors done this Played out role? Andy Garcia is pretty good in this film but the film on a whole is one big cliche.nothing worth watching more than  once and that's a bit of a reach.a Pure EGO Flick.,952732800,2,273,4.150943396226415
350170,5,6301697758,"This crime story needs one to suspend belief and that's not hard given the quality of acting and general shooting of the film. Richard Gere fits the bad cop womanizer role perfectly as does Andy Garcia the obsessive good  cop. The story is far fetched - a bright, yet insane junior officer of the  LAPD manipulates the force for his own gain, and gets away with it untill a  new Internal Affairs cop comes after him. Yet, the story has some truth to  it and it's thread which is worked into the script well enough to make one  sit back and be excited about the outcome. Good direction and good  supporting roles. DVD reproduction is also good.",944784000,7,643,4.452991452991453
350171,5,6301697758,"INTERNAL AFFAIRS is the story of a fight : the fight of a young member of the cops of the cops' team against a rotten member of the LAPD. Andy ""RAMON"" Garcia is hispanic, cold, married to a beautiful member  of the artistic world of L.A. and dedicated to his job. Richard  ""DENNIS"" Gere, on the contrary, is a cop with no morals at all,  living with his two ex-wives and six children in the same house and  enjoying the fortune he has illegally made during his spare time.
You  soon understand that there is a second fight going on, the one Ramon has to  carry on against himself. And the description of Ramon's stress is  curiously the most interesting aspect of INTERNAL AFFAIRS. Dennis will  become the broken mirror into which Ramon looks at himself. The image that  Richard ""Dennis"" Gere reflects in the direction of Andy Garcia is  vicious ; it's the image of an anglo-american living an hispanic way of  life with his entire family around him. Hard to swallow for a Ramon without  any single child !
So Ramon will go through a terrible night during which  all the temptations will pass before his eyes ; jealousy, sex, intemperance  and so on. The high point of this night is reached when he slaps his wife  screaming in his mother tongue, in spanish. At this moment, one understands  that INTERNAL AFFAIRS is also the story of a man who has to kill a part of  himself in order to survive in the world he has chosen to live in.
Don't  be afraid ! Mike Figgis' INTERNAL AFFAIRS is in the first place a wonderful  cop movie with Richard Gere in the best role of his career and lot of  action too. This movie is clearly one of the best of the genre of the  90's.
A DVD for your library.

350376,5,6301697758,"This film is filled with violence.  It is about police corruption, money laundering, and tax evasion.  Dennis Peck, played by Richard Gere, is an evil, corrupt cop, a murderer, a liar, and a womanizer.  Raymond Avila, played by Andy Garcia, is a member of the Internal Affairs Division and is investigating Dennis Peck.  Both Gere and Garcia give brilliant performances.  Likewise, the supporting  cast is outstanding.

350560,1,6301697758,"Always enjoyed Richard Gere movies for the most part and when I seen this movie I thought for sure it would be another classic I had missed(only 31 so I missed some of these growing up).  The cast was strong, I did a small amount of research before watching and the reviews were high so I was expecting something very good. WOW, was I wrong. This movie was dull, and unrealistic as can be. Gere is just to clean cut and white collar looking for me to see him as a beat cop driving around and being curropt, I thought if you switched his role with Garcia it would have fit them slightly better. Maybe a cop or a IA agent could enjoy this but even then it was just so phony. Garcia beats the hell outta Gere nothing happens, Garcia punches his wife and knocks her over a table in a crowded restaurant and no mention of it afterwards. Really?  I mean come on clearly he would have been in trouble with the force right?  The supporting cast outside of Gere and Garcia gave weak performances at best. Just so many scenes that felt incredibly forced and unbelievable. Still a must own movie if your just a huge Richard Gere fan and collecting his films but for the casual Blu Ray collector who just wanted to add a variety of great movies to your collection , you should watch this before you buy it.",1464220800,,1294,4.273469387755102

350619,5,6301697758,"Richard Gere is not an actor who has taken many chances with his career. It's a quality that propelled him to stardom. Internal Affairs marks a very significant departure from Gere's well-rehearsed mannerisms that seem to be his signature in every film. Not here. Gere has always played a character who, despite being flawed, had a heart. Internal Affairs is all about art. Gere goes out on a limb to become a very sinister bad guy, who is not only deliciously diabolical, but quite endearing, in a twisted sort of way. This is not your mother's Richard Gere film. Here, Mr. Gere is bad to the bone. He plays one of the most evil characters on celluloid, and you can't get enough of him. It's a shame he never took this to his other films. He would have amassed a large body of quality work. This is Gere's masterpiece.",1441756800,,819,4.503355704697986

The subject here (police corruption) is banal, but it gains extra value and weight by Figgis' atmospheric direction and, especially, by Richard Gere's powerful performance in perhaps his most atypical role (and as far as I know, his only truly villainous one).

350794,3,6301697758,"Cop flicks make for good cinema. There are a lot of ways to play them and here, with the good cop vs. bad cop scenario, having been done well in flicks like ""Training Day"" and ""Narc"" you figure you're on solid ground. Mmmmm....not so much.

Here's the scoop. Raymond Avilla (Andy Garcia) is new in I.A.D. working with a female partner Amy Wallace (Laurie Metcalf). While investigating a a case involving some curious details with a questionable cop, another cop, Dennis Peck (Richard Gere) comes into focus. They start looking into him and things start to smell really bad. The deeper they go the worse things look and everyone starts getting strung out.

This isn't a bad watch by any means but it all could have been much better. What's happening here is Gere's character. He's the ultimate slimeball. He's the kind of cop who puts more bad guys in jail because he's a short putt from being one of them. He's a womanizer who has been though a few wives, more than a few kids and has a big rice bowl to cover each month. But he seems to be able to figure how A.I.D will come after him and does what he needs to beat them to it. The Andy Garcia character might not be much different but he's going after bad cops as opposed to criminals. It's kind of fun watching him lose control and the verbal sparring between him and gere is pretty cool.

There are a few problems here. The first is Laurie Metcalf's character Amy Wallace. She's the veteran in the department but Garcia takes charge of her in little time. Another is director Mike Figgis. He has quite a few feature films under his belt but only a couple are of any note. He just can't seem to rise above the fray and this project is no different. His camera seemed to be in the wrong place more than a few times. A couple of times he two people conducting a conversation in front of other people they instinctively would have had in private. Stuff like that irked me.

Like I said, this is a decent enough watch but it will make you want to see the myriad other similar movies that were so much better.",1430784000,,2057,4.362924281984334

The movie is no doubt very true in parts and that makes for interesting entertainment.

Despite the his more experienced partner (Nancy Travis) it's Andy's character who has the wisdom and foresight to realize that he's just scraped the tip of the iceberg of a big-money, multi-player scam with 'well respected cop', Richard Gere at the top.  I give it four stars for its complex characters, unanticipated plot turns and excellent suspense throughout. Garcia is great, Gere is surprising as a slimy bad guy and Travis goes along for the ride, not questioning her younger subordinate: If you're one who is hawkish about 'gender-bias', then yes Travis gets the short end of the rope, mostly as a compliant partner to her younger, less experienced, male partner.",1379376000,,950,5.006329113924051

351273,3,6301697758,"This is a film where Richard Gere plays a villain through and through.  He clearly takes advantage of Andy Garcia who is basically a naive person who is entering Internal Affairs to investigate other police.  Richard Gere kills several people and seems to get away with it using his badge.  He also sets Andy Garcia up by getting into his mind and indicating to Garcia that his wife, Nancy Travis is sleeping around.  Even implying that she has slept with Gere.  Unfortunately, Andy Garcia does believe that his marriage is in trouble and this causes Garcia character to become completely unhinged at some points.

Richard Gere is portrayed as an excellent police officer who is also a family man with a wife, Annabelle Sciorri, some ex wives and eight children with one on the way.  This is basically a cover for his dealings with drug dealers and thugs.

The ending of this movie is just a little to pat and conventional and there is really no suspense to the end.  The performances are good but the script is weak in my opinion.  The film as a whole is just okay.

One thing that I thought about while watching this movie.  Garcia struck Nancy Travis in front of a crowd of people and knocked her down and yet in the end, without any apologies or counselling, they seem to be still together.",1366329600,2,1294,4.554112554112554
351324,3,6301697758,"This was an interesting movie that lost its way somewhere after the first half of the movie. What could have been a pretty good storyline deevolved into a mano y mano fight between the two leads. It just did not make sense.

Pooor writing plagued the production. Why would Gere's character kill the killer right next to him when he would only have needed to shoot the guy right from his location. That would have made the subsequent flight of the accomplice moot. Any real life cop would have known this.

Then there was the love triangle which I felt was overplayed. What did intrigue me was the domestic violence that Garcia exhibited to his wife. Hiting a woman is always looked at negatively in American cinema. Yet Garcia smacks his wife to the floor in front of witnesses. This is a rarity in movies and I liked being surprised by the reality of the scene. By the way, how did Dennis Peck get Avile's panties? That is something that is still on my mind.

Peck's character is tough and macho. There is no woman he can't seduce and it is this movie that put me in awe of Richard Gere. I have always been in awe of him since American Gigolo.

The movie had good ideas yet it lost its way and could not recover. Arch campbell of Washington, DC hated this film and from the ending I have to say I agree with him. However, the basic premise made sense. A man like Dennis Peck could exist in LA before the advent of ubiquitous video cameras. Dennis Peck is a real life Laurence Powell when it comes to brutality and corruption.

Buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed. I liked Raymond Aviles's partner, too. My namesake played the role of his partner with aplomb. I'm proud to be the 41st person to rate this DVD.

Like gere's character, Dennis Peck could have been scarier. I mean he was corrupt but then even Garcia's character to me was not all that likable of a person either. So Dennis as a bad guy comes up short in my book. The action could have been better. I know it's not an action film but I feel if they added a chase scene or more gun fights it may have added to the movie.

351332,5,6301697758,"I believe this film is Richard Gere's finest performance. At first glance it seems a good cop bad cop film; however, it seems to me at least to be much more an exploration of evil vs. sterility. Graham Greene's Brighton Rock came to mind. Yes Gere's character Dennis Peck is corrupt murderous and evil but his pursuers are worse--each of them represents a sterile modernity. Garcia and his partner have no children--and that to me is the core of the film--they each are tied into a yuppie culture of malignant exhibitionism (the art gallery is the perfect metaphor) In Brighton Rock Pinkie is as deadly as  Peck but Greene saves his real condemnation for his putatively virtuous pursuer Ida. In some ways this film is even better than Brighton Rock which is saying something since the theme of fertility vs sterility or corruption vs modernity, pregnant throughout the film  is announced powerfully at the end. Greene's great  book  announces its cognate moral anthropology at the start  uses religion as the dominant trope which perhaps is vaguer these days. Andy Garcia and the rest of the cast  are excellent. Like  Brighton Rock this film is a  representation, no a diagnosis of the ruling pathology of our  times. Greene had it right in the thirties Internal Affairs reminds us that things have only gotten worse.

Indeed Peck is involved in any number of dubious or downright criminal activities. He is also devious, a womaniser, and a clever manipulator, and he starts to turn his attention on Avila. ""Internal Affairs"" is a character study at it's finest. There are few movies out there that can compare to this one and that can be attributed to the director, Mike Figgis.

And the predictable happens- all us stupid boys/men in the audience are drawn in as we identify with the ""good guy"".

This is Internal Affairs in a nutshell. The plot is incredibly primitive, based on the macho competition between Garcia and Gere's characters. Nothing interesting happens, it's all totally predictable. If you want to prevent your brain from atrophy due to contamination, avoid this movie.

351391,2,6301697758,"After reading all of the other reviews of this film and all of the praise heaped on it, I have to wonder, are we all watching the same movie?  ""Internal Affairs"" is a weird film with so many preposterous premises that it could almost be a dark comedy if it was not for all of the mental and physical cruelty going on. As ridiculous as the plot is, you can see the end, and about everything in between, coming at you a mile away.

Raymond Avilla (Andy Garcia) is an officer in the LAPD in the Internal Affairs Division. In one of his first assignments, Garcia and his partner Amy Wallace (Laurie Metcalf) are investigating officer Van Stretch (William Baldwin). Avilla also suspects Stretch's partner, Dennis Peck (Richard Gere), since he finds it hard to believe that Stretch's partner would be blind to his illegal activity. He also believes that Stretch does not have the intelligence or the independence to be pulling off all of the drug dealing on his own.

Peck is supporting several ex-wives, his current pregnant wife, and eight children - on a policeman's salary?. He's also sleeping with just about every woman that becomes his target of opportunity, including his own partner's wife. Metcalf's character is the only woman in this film not being sexually targeted and/or abused by Peck. However, this film attributes this more to her sexual orientation than to the possibility that she might actually have standards. Also, Peck is so involved in so many blatant dirty dealings that Frank Drebbin of Police Squad would have had to be chief of Internal Affairs to not notice what's been going on up to this point, especially given Peck's high rolling lifestyle and his harem. Peck is a politician extraordinaire, and his picture should be next to the phrase ""quid pro quo"" in the dictionary. This has kept him out of the line of fire of the other regular cops on the force. Whenever Peck calls in a favor, his cop friends don't seem to mind that the favors often involve felonies.  Peck is also ultra-psychotic and murders his so-called best friend and partner, the unfortunate officer Stretch, to keep him from talking to internal affairs and exposing Peck's comfy criminal arrangements.

I have to wonder why such a good actor as Richard Gere would have taken on such a two-dimensional role as Dennis Peck. Peck seems to have taken on the profession of rogue cop more because he enjoys performing acts of violence, murder, and mayhem than the reason that he gives in the film - that he would do anything to support his kids. What does shooting Laurie Metcalf's character with a smile on his face have to do with supporting his kids? What does all of the mental cruelty that he generously portions out and treating every woman that he meets as a piece of meat got to do with supporting his kids?

Andy Garcia and Laurie Metcalf seemed rather wooden in their performances. In fact, it seems that only the villains in this film seem to come alive on screen. I get the feeling that all of the lead actors and actresses in this film just did not have proper direction during their performances on top of a script that does not make sense. This film has no brilliant twists, no lessons learned, and no complex characters. The only thing the viewer will get out of this movie is the need to take a long cleansing shower afterwards after having been exposed to the worst behavior humanity has to offer.",1159574400,6,3403,4.672787979966611

351436,3,6301697758,"I mainly saw this film because of beautiful, talented, brilliant, sensitive Laurie Metcalf.  For me, she captures the film.

The film itself is mediocre and has more violence than necessary esp. when the main character, Raymond Avila, who is played by Andy Garcia and Amy Wallace, who's brilliantly portrayed by Laurie, discover a psychopath in their mist.

Andy Garcia is all right, good, but not great and as the film goes on, he becomes the anti-hero of the film as his overconfidence and desire for revenge against Dennis Peck grows and becomes arrogance and buries any good intentions he may have had in the beginning.

This development is well illustrated in a scene where Ray and Amy are investigating Office Van Stretch, who is suspected of being on drugs and battering his wife, Penny.  Amy calmly tells Van Stretch of the possible consequences of failing to seek help, including suspension and firing.  Ray add in a comment also.

Van Stretch is belligerent and argues that he has no problems.  Amy remains courteous while being firm and doesn't become belligerent back while Raymond glares at Van Stretch and scolds, *Did you hear what I just said?!* as if Van Stretch were an errant schoolchild, then Ray puts a fist under his chin and leans forward, continuing to glare at Van Stretch icily and with contempt.

Meanwhile, Amy makes notes in her file and continues to speak to Van Stretch with respect, politeness, and professionalism, despite having to take disciplinary action against Van Stretch.

Ray later discovers that Dennis is having an affair with his wife, Kathleen, and publicly shouts at Kathleen in a restaurant, then goes after Dennis in what then becomes less about fighting crime for the good of society and more and more about a personal vendetta and showing Dennis up and as Penny astutely points out, ""nailing"" what Ray considers the ""bad guys"" in the LAPD.

It's interesting, because despite Raymond's talk about fighting corrupt officers and about Dennis's wrongdoings, by the end of the film, Ray, in a series of vindictive acts and growing arrogance, ends up sinking almost to villain Dennis' level and this plays right into Dennis's hands, which Ray is oblivious to.

Richard Gere is rather mediocre in playing psychopath villain Dennis Peck, who's killing other cops, becoming sexually involved with other men's wives, and later tries to kill poor Amy.  Dennis is able to twist Raymond into a pretzel and manipulate Ray quite easily without Ray's even realizing it.  Dennis does a masterful job in dragging Raymond down with him by the end of the film.

I guess it's fitting that Laurie plays Amy Wallace, since Amy is the most interesting character in the entire film and is the film's true hero.

She's unapolegetically lesbian, scrappy and gritty, yet has a sensitive side and turns out to be a good listener, esp. when she's talking to Penny Van Stretch, who is being battered by her abusive husband (who later gets killed by Peck).  Penny becomes clearly upset and tells Garcia's character and Amy to ""back off.""  Amy wisely does, but touches her arm in a silent message that she cares about her.

There's also one funny scene where Raymond often works late and his wife, Kathleen, goes into a jealous tizzy and starts accusing him of cheating with Amy right when he's on the phone with Amy and Amy overhears Kathleen scream about how he's *&%^-ing his ""little girlfriend"" at work. Amy's profoundly embarrassed, but gamely carries on the business call with Raymond as if she didn't hear Kathleen's conniption.

There's another telling scene where after Raymond sees Kathleen with Dennis and is furious, Ray heads back into the office and Amy is on the phone.  Ray's so unglued that he unprofessionally lifts up his chair and smashes it to the floor in a rage, startling everyone in the office and scaring Amy.  Amy, despite being rattled, doesn't let Ray's immature outburst derail her from her work and continues on her call.

I found myself rooting for Amy near the end when she gets shot by Officer Peck and is rushed to the hospital, bleeding profusely and possibly unable to walk again.

Amy is one of the few non-stereotypical portrayals of gay people; I like that she isn't portrayed as a stereotypical ""butch"" with a crew cut and boxy suit; Amy is a real woman who could be your daughter, friend, sister, co-worker, neighbor, or even mother. We need more characters like Amy Wallace; she's a real tribute to the gay and lesbian community.

So by the end, Dennis is the villian; Raymond Avila is the anti-hero; and Amy is the true hero of this film.",1103587200,2,4599,4.842911877394636

There was no emotion in his character until the end, and even then it was mild.  Gere was awful as the ""villain"".  He's obviously progressed immensely as an actor.

Gere is actually at first tickled that he's under investigation (thru his young partner Billy Baldwin) because he controls so much of his life. Multiple women/wives all living together, lots of kids, drug money, police power. But when Garcia of Internal Affairs starts getting too close Gere actually sets up a seduction of his wife that looks like one thing, is another thing and leads up to a very erotic, emotional scene between Garcia and his wife. Laurie metlcalf also plays a lesbian cop who Garcia briefly butts heads with as they team up. The nice thing about this movie is how everyone makes sense as a character and no one is entirely comfortable with the other characters. Loyalty is shown as a natural growth and betrayal a likely outcome. Very mature, strong film from gere, who makes an effort it seems to choose characters that have an internalworld going on that the watcher has to fathom about as he slowly lets possibilities, concepts slip out of what the motivations may be. Garcia is fantastic too. An incredible actor himself who chooses movies that allow his sublte, slightly repressed intensity to boil to the surface.

Maybe it's the change of pace; one probably gets tired of being the hero in film after film; but they clearly seem to revel in the opportunity of playing a straight-up jerk once in a while.  In ""Internal Affairs"", we have Richard Gere coming down off his movie idol pedestal and giving a devastating performance as Dennis Peck, a cop who gives corruption a whole new definition.  This guy makes Satan look like a boy scout.  He carries on a brazen affair with his partner's wife; arranges to have his partner whacked when the police department's internal affairs bureau begins investigating his partner's extracurricular activities a little too closely and his partner is about to implicate him in the mess; agrees to execute a wealthy businessman's elderly parents who are taking too long to die so that he can come into his inheritance (meanwhile seducing the businessman's wife as part of his fee for service); and tries  to seduce the wife of Raymond Avila, the internal affairs cop played by Andy Garcia, when Avila starts to suspect that Peck isn't the poster-boy cop his precinct command has made him out to be.  The movie tries to show us what Peck thinks is his softer side; he's a devoted father to his offspring, but we can see that to Peck his children are nothing but trophies; he's still in his thirties but he already has 8 by three former wives and his fourth wife is expecting his ninth.  Peck's children are extensions of himself; his wives are baby-making machines, and his partners and co-workers are pawns to be used for his own nefarious purposes.  When Avila realizes that Peck has tried to destroy him as a cop and as a man by attempting to seduce his wife, the battle lines are drawn; Avila, of course, will be Peck's nemesis, but it's fascinating to watch each of them try to bring the other down.  There are excellent performances by the supporting cast, particularly Nancy Travis as Avila's wife; Laurie Metcalf as Amy Wallace, Avila's partner who proves she's a tough a cop as any man, and William Baldwin as Van Stretch, Peck's hapless and ultimately gutless partner, brave enough to beat up on his wife but not strong enough to stand up to Peck and the venality he represents.  Peck is one of the more intriguing anti-heroes on film; just when we think he's hit rock bottom, he takes a shovel and starts to dig himself in even deeper; he sees Avila's decency as a weakness he can manipulate just as he has played and destroyed everyone who crosses him.  Some people, especially those who don't like to see law enforcement portrayed in a negative light, are going to be offended by this movie, but the film doesn't tar all policemen with the same brush; it's a fascinating and disturbing voyage into the mind of one very bad cop.",1026864000,31,2860,4.632411067193676
351442,5,6301697758,"This film is called ""Internal Affairs"" based on Andy Garcia's character Raymond Avilar, his IAB affiliation within the LAPD, and his investigation of corrupt cop Dennis Peck (Richard Gere). Then again, is it?  I think it's a very spicy double entendre as well, in reference to the steamy sexual undercurrent that spices this Police thriller.

The mind games that go on between Gere and Garcia are intense,  and thoroughly entertaining. Gere plays street cop Dennis Peck, a ruthless manipulator of his co-workers to better his own self interests, and of women for his voracious carnal needs. Despite being on his 4th marriage with kids all over, and one on the way from wife #4,  played by Annabella Sciorra, he takes who he wants to bed, when he wants. Other mens wives are his favorite score of all, and he beds all his conquests concurrently.  Garcia's Raymond Avilar, is investigating  Peck to see exactly how he is affording all the wives and kids on a cops salary.  He and partner Laurie Metcalf, an admitted lesbian he is partners with, uncover Peck's secret passel of lucrative  corruption.  It becomes their shared ambition to bust Peck.

Again, this is an extremely sexy movie, and having leads like Garcia and Gere don't make it too difficult to pull off. Raymond is married to the very beautiful Kathleen (Nancy Travis), and theirs is obviously a very passionate marriage. There are strong elements of jealousy mixed into their relationship, and Peck plays upon that in a great scene where he faces off with Raymond  outside the Division headquarters. Gere's deliciously vicious Peck starts talking about ""Wives"",  namely Raymonds. Peck  had previously told Raymond that this was a taboo subject when Raymond questioned him about his partner Van Stretch's (William Baldwin) wife, who Peck of course, is sleeping with.  However,  he has fun getting Raymond riled up as he reveals what he knows about Kathleen, and surmising that she is bored and may be looking for ""strange"", a Peck term for infidelity. Peck explicitly tells Raymond, HE will be mentoring Kathleen sexually, very soon.  This haunts Raymond, and there are interesting camera vignettes where Raymond flashes to thoughts of Peck and his wife together when he's been drinking as Peck has driven him to do.  Director Mike Figgis is especially adept in creating a nightmarish experience for Raymond that we can feel while viewing it.

I personally love this film, and think it has enough of everything to really keep you thoroughly engrossed throughout. The most outstanding thing about it is the chemistry between all the leads. These characters feel very real, and work beautifully together. There is a terrific noir mood with the innate evilness that Gere brings to the screen so convincingly.  This is enhanced by Garcia and Travis' roles which are smolderingly full of a heated sexual ambience.  Although it's a sexy police thriller like Paul Verhoeven's ""Basic Instinct"", ""Internal Affairs"" has a more simmering quality, and it's less obvious in it's agenda.

This movie is one to watch with the one you love, be sure to keep a fire extinguisher nearby for the subsequent sizzle. It's truly one of the best crime dramas ever lensed, because it goes beyond that to the personal and ""Internal Affairs"" between the characters. That's why I think the title refers to more than just the most feared division of the police department.",1012780800,44,3405,4.991150442477876
