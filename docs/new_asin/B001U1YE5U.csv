My daughter loves it and, unlike a lot of children's music, I don't mind listening to it and even forget to turn it off after she falls asleep.  The DVD is very simple but keeps my daughter entertained as she rocks along.",1287100800,,389,4.22972972972973
8342626,5,B001U1YE5U,"My wife heard about these shows around town, here in San Diego, from other Moms. She went with our almost 2 year old daughter and she loved the songs the band would play. We bought the DVD and they are very catchy and entertaining for adults because the songs are tailored to be from the child's point of view, like ""Sippy Cup"", where the child thinks that they will not need a sippy cup when they are older, but that might not be true because Mommy still has a sippy cup and goes to Starbucks to fill'er up.
Also seems much better than many shows on TV. My daughter just stares at Sesame street, Barney or Curious George, but gets up and dances and sings to this DVD. Not sure how old is too old to enjoy the DVD because we only have the one child so far, but I think it is a must buy! Plus we are getting rid of our cable and going with OTA TV.",1268697600,,846,4.011834319526627
