6454727,1,B00KZJX81E,"Wow!.  I have been into bigfoot since the age of 7 (I am now 42) and this has to be the worst thing I have seen.  There are good ""bad"" movies and then there is this.  I am hoping that the editor was drunk when they were finalizing this film.  Editing was REALLY bad.  Bigfoot takes a swipe at someone and totally misses by like 3 feet but yet the next thing you see is this guy on the ground with his neck slashed.  The dialogue was awful.  The acting was abysmal.  I was really hoping for a decent bigfoot movie but this was a total let down.  I guess I will keep waiting.",1410480000,4,573,3.956140350877193
6454728,3,B00KZJX81E,"First the better parts - C. Thomas Howell, the Bigfoot costumes, and a decent acting job by Holt Boggs as the sheriff.  It is simply a Bigfoot action film, but it has a shaky storyline, not a whole lot of plot, unnecessary sex and nude scenes and some bad special effects.  Especially a early scene with a camper getting his throat ripped that looked really phoney.  The editing was very poorly done and questions are tossed out to you and never answered like - what was that baby business all about?  Never referred to again.  Judd Nelson picked up a paycheck for doing nothing.  The movie is listed as being 94 minutes long and it is obviously about 20 minutes shorter -- it may have been because there wasn't enough good scenes to put in.  As I said the editing was pretty bad and that can really effect a movie.  The storyline is that there are a couple of dozen Big foot living outside of Boggy Creek and they attack couples, kill the men and kidnap and rape the women.  When they kidnap the sheriff's daughter he has to acknowledge their existence and set out to get his daughter back.  Again folks, please stop comparing a movie to the book - if you enjoyed a book the movie will never measure up to it.  Most of the time the only thing they have in common is the name.  I haven't read the book and probably never will so it is the movie I review not the book.  With all the bad stuff about the movie I guess I would call this a 2 1/2 stars, not a three.",1410134400,2,1461,4.212230215827338
6454729,1,B00KZJX81E,"I really liked the Bigfoot Wars novels by Eric Brown. Unfortunately, this movie did not seem to have one single part of the novels in it, other than Bigfoot.  The acting was horrible.  The special effects could have been done better by the worst competitors on Faceoff. The neck wound on the main camper was atrocious. I looked as fake as it actually was. There wasn't even any attention to detail on the Sheriff's Department's uniforms. The name badge was on the wrong side and the patches were not held down very well. A 17 round Glock changed into a different gun that only fired 4 rounds before the slide locked back. (This is after the actor described his gun as holding 17 rounds.)  Not even C. Thomas Howell could save any part of this horrible movie.  I do not write reviews very often, but felt others needed a warning to stay away from this movie.  How Eric Brown could even want his name associated with this crap boggles my mind.",1409961600,3,941,4.47953216374269
6454730,1,B00KZJX81E,"This movie is NOT a campy horror flick destined to be a classic - it's a DISASTER.  If you need any proof look no further than the tweets by C. Thomas Howell on Sept 2nd...

""Tommy sends his apologies - #BigfootWars had post production issues. He hasn't seen it yet but has heard bad things about how it came out.""

and

""Tommy recommends not buying #BigfootWars - sorry to anybody who purchased in advance. Post production problems, he's heard. @holtboggs""

Unfortunately I did purchase it in advance.  Yes, the production values are atrocious, but that's the least of its problems.  It's just NOT a good movie.  It's not a campy joy ride (I love campy joy rides, I bought this movie expecting at worst just that), it's a horribly written, horribly put together, mess of a film that can't even be called a movie (to add insult to injury the description of this movie states it is 94 minutes in length when in truth it clocks in under 75 mins).  I could explain at length everything that is wrong with this film but it wouldn't be worth your time.  It's just so bad - and not in a good way!  I did laugh when I could clearly see the bare neck of one of the actors wearing a bigfoot suit when he was shot from behind but that was the only moment of entertainment I had.

If you enjoyed the novels by Eric S. Brown (which I did) don't expect to see anything familiar here.  The filmmakers have said a lot that this movie is a ""prequel"" to those books but it's actually a completely unrelated story that has nothing to do with the books.  Another review called it a film school project gone horribly wrong - but that's an insult to film students.  It almost seems like the filmmakers had to make a movie or their rights were gonna expire so they shot this over a 1 week period and churned it out.  Eric S. Brown should feel utterly devastated that he trusted this director with his book.  The only thing I can say for this guy is he must be an amazing salesmen because he talked a lot of people into working for him for presumably little compensation.  Holt Boggs is a natural actor and does his best with what he's got to work with.  And the name actors (both C. Thomas Howell and Judd Nelson) seem like they were fully committed to the material at the time of filming.  They all do a good job.  But that doesn't in any way make it an enjoyable, let alone watchable, film.

Anybody who writes a positive review of this film is either: (A) a person who's bar is so low you'd do well to completely disregard their opinion.  OR (B) a person who is a friend or family member of the filmmakers attempting some dishonest damage control.  In either case you'd be wise to look at any positive comments with a healthy level of skepticism and steer clear of this one.",1409875200,10,2755,4.3359375
6454731,1,B00KZJX81E,Seen this at a local theater. Why was there the need for the sexual scenes at the beginning?  Added nothing to the story. Ruined the movie and several people left before bigfoot really showed up. I enjoyed the books in the series but this movie hardly resembled the book at all. Is a real shame.,1409875200,3,295,4.363636363636363
6454732,4,B00KZJX81E,"An emotionally haunted sheriff tries to save his daughter, and his town, from a mythical beast that has become a reality. The bodies pile up in this man vs. beast horror/thriller. Despite the obvious problems like sound and editing, I genuinely liked this movie. It is going on my campy horror shelf along with Bruce Campbell classics like 'The Evil Dead', and 'Ticks', 'Yeti', 'Sabor Tooth' etc. to watch on margarita night. Everyone should have a campy horror shelf for margarita night, right? Let's be real though, the four stars are for the actors and I love some of the original, humorous dialogue. Sound and editing need a kick in the butt! There was actually a scene where the sheriff's V.O. started while the girl was still screaming in the BigFoot cave. My granny could've fixed that blunder, as well as the distracting lawn mower buzz during many of the scenes. Hopefully sound will at least clean up their mess before this goes to Netflix and/or SciFi channel. Do I regret my purchase? Absolutely not! The Sheriff played by Holt Boggs was solid acting, and I loved C.Thomas Howell's character. All the 3 sheriffs did a great job and the Zeke and Granny character with too many kids were amusing. It is a shame editing and sound obviously shut the door with some super size cheese balls and fell asleep!!! I did like the creatures. One of them resembles a mountain man we have living here in the Blue Ridge Mountains (honest). A few problems, but I think it has enough good going for it to become a campy horror classic like 'The Evil Dead'. I'm sure Bruce Campbell still squirms a bit if he watches that film sober.",1409875200,3,1626,4.629757785467128
6454733,1,B00KZJX81E,Not worth even one star! No subtitles or Closed Captioned and the audio is hard-to-hear. Movie seems to be to show the clothes being ripped of pretty young young women.  I'm should be disappointed that the movie is only 72 minutes but I shut it off after 15 minutes.  Wish I get my money refunded---please do not waste your time or cash.,1409788800,5,337,4.419354838709677
6454734,1,B00KZJX81E,"I had high hopes for this movie, as it was filmed in my county. After seeing the hype online and on facebook, I supported it. When I received it and sat down to watch it, I had to turn it off as I have a small child and it is not kid friendly. It looks like something a bunch of high school kids with a camcorder made. What a ripoff for $18. I hope I can get a refund.",1409788800,3,368,3.670886075949367
6454735,1,B00KZJX81E,"This does not even qualify as a movie.  It's more like a film school project...gone very wrong.  The movie clocks in at a ""massive"" 70 minutes and is filled with a bunch of bad acting and very little bigfoot.  This turd is chock full of bad...acting, writing, directing, make-up.  And the bigfoot suit...my goodness...it looks like they may have pulled the old suit from the ""6 Million Dollar Man"" out of mothballs.  On second thought...nah...this was much worse.

I feel bad for Eric S. Brown, his books were fun to read.  If he was complicit in this travesty, then shame on him.",1409616000,2,580,4.627450980392157
6454746,1,B00KZJX81E,Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.  The dialog was terrible.  The plot nonsensical.  And the acting was worse than that!  Don't rent this movie.,1438732800,,150,4.88

6454749,3,B00KZJX81E,"I've written a lot of bigfoot movie reviews and this one actually surprised me. I did not read the ""Bigfoot Wars"" series so maybe that is why there is a lot of disappointment. The acting is above average for this type of flick, the movie moves at a good pace and the blood flows decently and the creatures looks range from good to ""the budget was spread a little too thin."" There are better bigfoot movies out there and there are a ton of worse ones. A bigfoot tribe are kidnapping women and killing off men in the town of Boggy Creek (no relation to the previous Boggy Creek movies.)

A welcome addition to your collection and you could do a lot worse with 72 minutes of your life.",1426291200,,682,4.286821705426356

6454754,1,B00KZJX81E,This movie is subpar. The visuals are okay and the Bigfoot suits look pretty good but the sound in the movie is just awful. There are plot holes throughtout the film but then again what do you honestly expect from a movie called Bigfoot Wars. I heard the book that this film is based off of is much better so I recommend you use your money to buy the book and skip the movie.,1419811200,,375,4.081081081081081

I love bad movies, I really do. I own 3 copies of ""Manos Hands of Fate"", I rushed out and picked up the ""Leprechaun"" Box set....I've seen ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" on the big screen. Cheezy horror is something I turn to often, and cherish.

This is not cheesy horror, this is just awful. Poor acting, poor production values, poor F/X.....and the ultimate sin...it's DULL. If you like bad movies like I do....you may be tempted to give this movie a try....DON'T!!!

It just has the right amount of campy effect with out going full blast digital or or so bad that it looks cheap.

Things would be absent one scene and present once more in the next.  I sincerely think someone apologized to someone who had supposedly died in one scene, sans the actual death scene itself, and then that person was present later on.  Do yourself a favor and pick up the ""movie version"" of Eric S. Brown's Bigfoot Wars series, it's savage bigfoot action with better writing.  Seriously.

But, the movie did keep me entertained for awhile, so I say it was a slightly average movie of its kind, for whatever that's worth. Hey, it's a bigfoot movie, and there are only so many ways to rate them, and this one was better than some I've seen because I continued to watch the entire thing, and believe me, there are many which I've stopped and deleted from my Watchlist after only 10 minutes into it.  I rated this 2 stars because C.
