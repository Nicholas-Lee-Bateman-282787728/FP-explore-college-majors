119850,4,0790746387,"This movie is an often ignored part of Humphrey Bogart's movie career. After all, this is the guy who was in The Maltese Falcon, Key Largo, The Treasure of Sierra Madre and The Caine Mutiny just to name a few highlights. Some people might have trouble adjusting to the rather silly mood of this film. However, you will probably enjoy it more if you know what you're coming into.
Bogart plays a New York gambler with mob ties who always wears gloves and has a weakness for cheesecake. When his favorite baker is murdered, he sets out to discover whodunit and in the process uncovers a Nazi plot for terrorism.
But, to tell the truth, I wasn't interested in this movie for the plot. It was the cast that interested me. Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre and Judith Anderson play the Nazi villains and who can think of a better bad guy line-up? All of them are excellent although I had a bit of trouble accepting that small-framed Lorre as the strong-arm of the group.
Bogart is particularly amusing when he tries to bluff his way through a Nazi meeting when he has no idea what is going on and his knowledge of German is limited to two words! In fact, the entire cast seems to be enjoying themselves and as a result, the audience enjoys the movie even more.
While this is not a masterpiece, it is certainly enjoying for what it is: an action/comedy with propaganda elements that just happens to have some of the greatest actors of the time. The double talk is fast and funny, the plot doesn't make much sense but the script throws everything but the kitchen sink at you so you don't really notice.
Verdict:
You will like it: If you are a rabid Veidt, Lorre, Bogart or Anderson fan. If you want a fast, funny way to spend an evening.
You will not like it: If you expecting another Casablanca. If you are overly choosey about ""serious"" plots.
Enjoy!",1044316800,31,1836,4.467261904761905
119851,5,0790746387,"A nice change of pace for Bogie--still a shady character (with a soft spot for his Mom [Jane Darwell, who gets ""a feelin'"" that something isn't quite right, and sets Bogie on the case] and his favorite cheesecake, baked in the old neighborhood), but willing to take on the Nazis after they murder the baker....
As others have noted, the ""double-talk"" sequence with Bogie and Demerest is priceless, and director Sherman keeps the pace quick and snappy.
An overlooked gem in Bogie's films, and one you should check out!",977011200,8,517,4.820224719101123
119852,4,0790746387,"Humphrey Bogart stars as ""Gloves"" Donahue, who looks into the murder of a family friend, and the investigation gets him involved with a mysterious nightclub singer (Kaaren Verne), the art world, and Fifth  Columnists (people in the US helping the Nazis during WWII).  There's a lot  of action and humour along the way as Gloves discovers that things aren't  what they seem.  This isn't a typical Bogart film from this time period,  and it's a nice change of pace.  Bogart is supported by a terrific cast.  Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre, and Judith Anderson are properly menacing as the  Fifth Columnists, while Frank McHugh, Jackie Gleason, and especially  William Demarest are a lot of fun as Bogart's boys.  The double talk  sequence as Bogart and Demarest try to pass themselves off as Nazi  sympathizers at a Fifth Column meeting is hilarious and memorable.  I liked  this film and I thought it was great that humour could be used in a film  about an otherwise serious subject at a time when the world was at war.",963619200,8,1013,4.735632183908046

119962,5,0790746387,"Bogie didn't do too many of them comic thrillers. This highly entertaining 1941 picture, ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT, posits that he maybe should've done more. On the other hand this film was released a few days removed from the attack on Pearl Harbor, and common sense dictated that folks after the b0mbing were probably less inclined to take in the lighthearted wartime intrigue.

Interestingly, this is another film that George Raft turned down that Bogie picked up. In this one Humphrey Bogart once more parades his tough guy screen persona, him with the tattered rep and the surprising code of honor. This time he tacks on a catch phrase: ""How about that?"" Alfred ""Gloves"" Donahue (Bogie), shady New Yorker, dwells on the outskirts of respectability. He's a professional gambler, although he's been heard to mention that he's a promoter as well. He loves his mother (Jane Darwell) and he loves the cheesecake he's eaten for ten years from Miller's Home Bakery, but he's perfectly at ease hobnobbing with them underworld types.

Gloves' busybody mom catapults us to the meat of the narrative. She coaxes her son to investigate the vanished proprietor of Miller's Home Bakery, a shop that abuts her residence. Gloves and his henchmen's nosing around uncovers a ring of Nazi saboteurs and a plot to sink an American battleship. It all takes place in one eventful day and night, and maybe that's why the title. Somewhere along the way, Gloves ends up being framed for murder and has to go on the lam.

Know that there's enough dramatic heft onscreen that you never do dismiss the story as pure shenanigans. Having said that, the roster is chock-full of Damon Runyonesque characters. Jackie Gleason and Phil Silvers get bit parts but they're barely on camera. Instead William Demarest and Frank McHugh provide the film's best comic relief moments as Bogie's minions. As the morose ""Sunshine,"" Demarest pratfalls with good-natured abandon. McHugh is ""Barney,"" Gloves' driver who throughout the film tries to wheedle for some time off on account of that he just got married. But the funniest bit probably involves Bogie himself whose character, accompanied by Sunshine, sneaks into the saboteurs' secret lair. Gloves is mistaken for a collaborator and is asked to present a sit rep in front of the Fifth Columnists. Gloves, wracking his brain, decides to engage in befuddling double-speak and is soon joined by Sunshine. It's funnier than how I'm describing it.

Peter Lorre contributes his unique flourishes as the cold-hearted killer, Pepi, one of the saboteurs and also a piano player at the club. Conrad Veidt plays the master spy Franz Ebbing whose side job of auctioneer is solid enough that Gloves ends up bidding on (and winning) a fancy Louis XV desk. Kaaren Verne makes you wonder which side she's on as that sultry nightclub canary Leda Hamilton.

Normal in this era were films that carried that whiff of propaganda, and ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT isn't that different, albeit the more lighthearted tone. My patriotic bell often gets rung whenever I watch these old-timey movies in which the homeland goons demonstrate that they're on the level when it really counts. I've talked about the comedy bits but I have to mention how action-packed this film is. Set pieces that play witness to spates of fisticuffs (and slapstick) include a nightclub, a toy warehouse, an auction house, Central Park, and the saboteurs' secret lair(s). It's enough to keep a patriotic underworld figure's knuckles soaked in buckets of ice.

One tip for would-be Nazi saboteurs: Maybe you shouldn't keep a portrait of der Fhrer hanging on the wall. That's sort of a dead giveaway.",1373932800,,3654,4.991789819376026
119963,5,0790746387,Humphrey looks healthy and happy and is quietly fascinating as usual.

119974,5,0790746387,"Look, I'm a sucker for a Humphrey Bogart flick.  So, you'll need to take these comments in that spirit.

This is one of the more obscure Bogart flicks that came out fairly soon after we entered World War II.  Consequently, its subjects, spies and fifth columnists, may not have been met with excessive popularity at the time.  So, that would at least partially account for its relative obscurity.

Bogart is a gangster in the film (no surprise). Bogart's character describes himself as a promoter.  In any event, one quickly gets informed that he's a gangster (gambler) with a heart of gold.  He loves his mom.  He loves the people in his neighborhood.  He loves cheesecake, and it's the cheesecake (you know, cream cheese, crust, and so on) that gets him involved in fighting a ring of Nazi spies.

Yes, it is a bit of wartime propaganda, but it is pleasantly assembled wartime propaganda with great character actors (Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre, and Jackie Gleason), a fast moving script, and, of course, Bogart.",1364256000,,1012,4.8313953488372094

119978,5,0790746387,"I'm not sure many people think of Humphrey Bogart as a comedian, but if you think about it Bogart's turn as Charley Alnutt in The African Queen is absolutely oozing with comedic charm. The crabby old guy facade dissolves as he romances Katherine Hepburn. Ditto for his odd romance with Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina. In fact, there is plenty of comedy in his movies.
This film is a crazy fruit salad that was no doubt inspired by the national fervor that was fed by WWII and  anti nazi sentiment. Warner Brothers, which produced this film, flooded the homefront with plenty of movies that took on the Nazis and the Japanese Empire. The thing that distinguishes this movie is that it is played for laughs. Bogart plays an Irish/American gangster named Gloves Donovan. He inadvertently falls into an Axis plot to mess with NYC and blow things up. It all starts with cheesecake made by his mother's neighbor who turns up murdered. Supported by his gang of thugs which include William Demerest, Frank McHugh, Jackie Gleason, and Phil Silvers, he battles the bad guys and attempts to thwart their efforts to flatten out NYC. Along the way, he takes on the slick nazi mastermind Ebbing (Conrad Veidt) and his nazi associates which include Pepi (Peter Lorre), Madame (Judith Anderson), and Steindorff (Martin Kosleck). For a little romantic interest, Lida Hamilton (Kaaren Verne) is thrown into the mix. In the end, Gloves calls in the reserves (which are his fellow hoods) to thwart the Nazis. The whole thing culminates with Ebbing being blown up. Talk about patriotism. Even gangsters are stand up guys when it comes to keeping the world safe for democracy.
Now all of this may sound dreadful when Veidt gets blown to kingdom come, but this is such a goofy script that is so well done that it works. Bogart is hysterical. In fact, even the bad guys who play this serious are funny.
The best thing about this movie was seeing Bogart do slapstick and flexing his comedic chops. As a bonus, its fun watching Silvers and Gleason do their thing. Ten years down the road the new medium of TV would make them household names.",1359417600,,2110,4.733695652173913
119979,5,0790746387,"My first impression of ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT, besides it being like no other film starring Humphrey Bogart, is that the Firesign Theatre may have gotten inspiration from it for their classic ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nick-Danger-Third-Eye/dp/B0026OIBNG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nick Danger, Third Eye</a>"" record album side. The opening scene is styled like a screwball comedy: rapid snappy dialogue from a group of New Yawk fellas spending time at a favorite eatery, arguing over the sort of trivia that helps pass the hours. Once this sequence ends, line delivery slows to a more standard pace.

Coming off the success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MALTESE-FALCON/dp/B001EC0OQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MALTESE FALCON</a>, Bogey, now a star of the first rank, appears confident in this at times comic spy thriller. He plays 'Gloves' Donahue, a Broadway bon vivant who's describes himsef as a ""promoter."" We get the impression that Gloves is a high stakes gambler with a knack for winning (and getting in hot water) who has around him a coterie of hangers-on, chief of whom seems to be ""Sunshine"" (Demarest). They're a group more comfortable with street slang and double talk than with proper English.

Donahue's thick-brogued Irish mom (Darwell) often interrupts his day with hunches about friends in trouble, paranoias that prove correct. In this story, she lures her son from an unseen Yankees game with news that his favorite cheesecake baker has disappeared. The audience are let in on this mystery before anybody in the film and we watch as Gloves, with help from his crew, gets deeply involved in exposing a large group of Fifth Columnists with sabotage on their agenda.

One of the picture's best scenes has a mob of patriotic guys bustin' in on a big cell meeting and bustin' heads with pipes and bats. Another involves an explosion (watch for it!), but throughout, Gloves and the boys keep things exciting. Lorre as evil henchman Pepe is a standout as is Veidt as the main villain. Kudos to Anderson's ice cold Prussian villainess. (Love that gorgeous dark beaded gown she wears!) I skip through Verne's two nightclub numbers, but wouldn't if they were better songs. (No hits here!)

Overall however, it's great entertainment. Can't recommend this one too highly.

119980,3,0790746387,"No question, no question at all, at least cinematically, Humphrey Bogart did not like Nazis. In the United States or abroad. And he was willing to do something about it, cinematically. We all know and loved his dashing role as Rick, the owner of Rick's American Caf, in Casablanca, where he got off the dime and decided that the love interests of three little people in this wicked old world were not ""worth a hill of beans"" compared to lining up, lining up gratis as it turned out, against the Nazis (and their Vichy French sympathizers) and helping freedom-fighter Victor Lazlo out of a jam. Ditto when some second level free-fighter gets dinged in Vichy French Martinique and, he, Captain Harry Morgan this time, has to get off another dime and help the good old cause. Of course there love interest Lauren Bacall as a wayward fellow traveler made that decision so much easier.

Now to the film under review, a lesser film, and obviously one released (December 2, 1941) before the Americans went into World War II big time, All Through The Night, and Mister Bogart's efforts to derail the German ""fifth columnists"" (real enough) infesting New York City and other American locales. Bogart, as ""sportsman"" (I am being nice) Gloves Donohue, the toast of Broadway is incensed when the guy who delivers his thrice daily cheesecake is mysteriously murdered. And when another ""colleague"" from the entertainment business is offed and he is the ""fall guy,"" patsy, he determinedly decides to get to the bottom of these cases.

And at the bottom is that a Nazi spy ring that is planning, planning assiduously a big time event, in New York Harbor. Naturally, after much rigmarole Gloves saves the day but not before taking care of that ring, and its nefarious leader, Ebbing (played by Conrad Veidt, last seen as a German Major at the Casablanca airfield very dead from a Rick bullet after trying to stop Victor Lazlo from doing his anti-Nazi business. Of course, the surprise in all of this rather long film given the rather simple task, is that it is played half-way for laugh.

Gloves Donohue, unlike Bogie portrayals of hardened criminals like Duke Mantee in Petrified Forest or Roy `The Boy"" in High Sierra is strictly out of some second-rate Damon Runyon hi-jinx episode. So there is plenty of slapstick, and wistful colorful New York language, to accompany this ferreting out of `fifth columnists"" in our midst. Frankly I liked his grittily determined efforts as Rick and Captain Morgan better (and the female company provided a little better as well, although Leda, his love interest here and in a jam as well, could sing a torch tune, no question.) Like I say though chalk up one Humphrey Bogart as a guy that Nazis (and on the run hoods, who like to slap girls around, like Johnny Rico in Key Largo) should stay away from, very far away.",1341705600,,2838,4.764227642276423
119981,3,0790746387,"It was the early 40s and the German threat was real. The movie portrays the German spies trying to disrupt America. Fair enough. I did not care for the too frequent, ""witty"" dialogue. Much of the same cast as Casablanca but not even close to the quality of story or film. If you are a Bogart fan you'll want to see it to say that you saw it, but that is about all.",1338163200,,364,4.0
119982,4,0790746387,"This is sort of a strange movie in a lot of ways. Shot around the same time as Casablanca which came at the right time to revamp Humphrey Bogart's screen image of the perennial second lead that was usually a thug with a gun (often with comedic undertones), this movie is neither a comedy or a drama. If I have to label it anything, it would be as a dramady.
The plot is simple yet convoluted if that paradox makes any sense. The premise is that Bogart's character is a hood named Gloves Donovan. Gloves has a soft spot for his mama and the cheesecake from a local bakery that she always serves him when he stops by to visit. One day the cheesecake isn't delivered, the German baker disappears, and Gloves' mother implores him to look into the matter. As any good son would do, Gloves gets involved in what turns out to be the murder of the baker. From this point things go all out ballistic.  Turns out that a group of fifth columnists are responsible for the murder and Gloves is on their trail like a hyper cat going after a pack of rats. Aiding Gloves in his hunt are his gang members which include William Demarest, Phil Silvers, and a youngish Jackie Gleason. As I previously stated, this movie has plenty of comedic moments. The nazis and their posse are headed up by the always engaging and dynamic Conrad Viedt, Judith Anderson, and Peter Lorre. Since no good WB picture would be cast without a love interest, Kaaren Verne plays an unbelievably gorgeous pawn that the nazis are using.
As the story evolves, Bogart & Company pursue the bad guy nazis and try to get the dope on what they are planning.  Underneath all the sleuthing is a plot  that has potential ramifications pre-dating 9/11. While quite a lot of the shtick in the movie makes fun of the Hitler gang and does it well, there is the underlying reality that the nazis weren't really funny at all but really quite threatening.
This movie gives Bogart a chance to do some comedy and gives an inkling of what he could and would go on to do in The African Queen. He does some great and really absurd double talk in a scene that takes place at a secretive nazi meeting. Bogart's Gloves Donovan is ultimately a thug with a heart of gold. As for the rest of the cast, they are terrific. It was fun to watch Gleason and Silvers in their small parts early in their film careers. Conrad Viedt is as always superb and manages to pull off his strictly serious role despite the mayhem that Bogart creates.
The reason I am recommending this movie is that it is oddly well done and even with a ridiculously complicated plot, it is easy to buy into because it is interesting and has a good cast. It is also an easy way to watch a lot of popular and good actors of the era play off one another.",1334448000,,2747,4.361328125
119983,5,0790746387,"""All through the Night"" is my favorite Bogart movie. It setting is the NYC, NY during WWII. The common American citizens and Bogart are going up against Nazi Spies and Saboteurs in NYC NY. The enemy thinks that American's are weak, fearful, and lazy. Bogart and the average American Joes show them how wrong they are. This film combines drama, action, and comic relief. A great supporting cast with the likes of Phil Silvers and a very young Jackie Gleason are some examples. This is a patriotic film from that period. I love it and I think you will too.",1324857600,2,554,4.55
119994,3,0790746387,"Released five days before Pearl Harbour, this movie's jokey tone and somewhat light take on foreign saboteurs didn't sit well with audiences once America entered World War Two. Still, this is a jolly and involving comic-drama that sometimes seems way, way ahead of its time in its combination of action and comedy.

Bogart, on the cusp of superstardom (High Sierra and The Maltese Falcon came out earlier in 1941, while Across the Pacific and Casablanca would be out within the following 13 months), plays ""Gloves"" Donahue, a loveable gang leader in New York. He's from the Damon Runyon school of loveable gangsters, and comes complete with a loveable, interfering Irish mother played by Jane Darwell, who'd recently won an Oscar for playing Ma Joad in The Grapes of Wrath.

Gloves and his men stumble across a Nazi spy ring, and soon only Bogart and the daughter of a concentration-camp prisoner stand between New York and Nazi saboteurs, partially because the police are idiots. Boy, are the police idiots.

It's all played breezily and, if you've watched a lot of classic television, you'll note that a lot of supporting actors would go on to rewarding television careers, most notably Jackie Gleason (The Honeymooners), Phil Silvers (Sgt. Bilko) and William Demarest (the grandfather in My Three Sons). Peter Lorre and Conrad Veidt -- both of whom would reteam with Bogart in Casablanca -- and Dame Judith Anderson round out a surprisingly high-powered cast.

119996,4,0790746387,"This is one of the largely-undiscovered gems from Humphrey Bogart's 1940's output.  ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT is an insanely enjoyable adventure-comedy which should have a larger profile, as it truly is one of Bogie's best from the period.

When the supplier of his beloved cheesecake is snuffed out by forces unknown, New York bookie Gloves Donahue (Bogart) and his associates head off on the trail of justice, eventually stumbling across a nest of Nazi spies operating ""in plain sight"" by using a high-class auction house as their cover.  Teaming up with nightclub singer Leda Hamilton (Kaaren Verne), a young lady who knows much more than she's willing to spill, Gloves and his friends go undercover as new Nazis in an attempt to destroy them from within...and learn exactly what they are plotting in New York.

The supporting cast is first-rate.  Many of the ""usual suspects"" from the Bogie films of the 1940's are here, including Peter Lorre (playing yet another sinister Nazi henchman).  Judith Anderson essentially reprises her wicked Mrs. Danvers from the previous year's ""Rebecca"" (but this time she wears a *sparkly* black dress); nontheless she is still absolutely delicious.  In lots of aspects this is the perfect double-feature companion for ""Casablanca"".

Directed by Vincent Sherman

Humphrey Bogart plays Gloves Donahue, a rough-and-ready but essentially decent New York gambler. The Runyonesque plot gets moving when Gloves tries to find out what's holding up his favorite restaurant's daily shipment of cheesecake. Paying a call on the bakery, Gloves stumbles into a Nazi spy ring, masterminded by Conrad Veidt. Mixed up in all this is nightclub singer Kaaren Verne, whose loyalties are in question in her early scenes but who turns out to be as true-blue as the patriotic Gloves. Combining a quick wit with quicker fists, Gloves and his ""mob"" thwart the Nazis before they're able to skip the country. The cast is a movie buff's dream, ranging from Jane Darwell as Bogart's mom to Peter Lorre as a cynical Nazi flunky to William Demarest, Frank McHugh, Phil Silvers and Jackie Gleason as Bogie's favorite cohorts.

The heavies are amazing. Conrad Veidt is wonderful as the Nazi spy trying to blow up a ship in New York's harbor. Mr. Veidt was such an elegant figure in everything he did. Judith Anderson is seen as the mysterious assistant to Mr. Veidt's character. Ms. Anderson had a way about her that she dominates the scenes in which she appears. Peter Lorre does a lot with his small piano player role, Pepi.

A great movie with a fabulous script!

Speciial footnote -- George Raft and Olivia de Havilland were originally assigned to the film in 1941, but Raft turned the role down. As with High Sierra (1941) and The Maltese Falcon (1941), Humphrey Bogart benefited from Raft's refusals -- and a legend was born!

119999,4,0790746387,"The reviews of this one have been mixed, so I thought I would add my two cents on the positive side.  Like a number of other reviewers, I only recently stumbled on this film having never even heard of it before.  Usually, a film being this obscure despite such a great cast means trouble and I can understand how it doesn't work for some people.  The Runyonesque opening does grate a bit with the spy thriller the movie evolves into.  But I enjoyed it immensely.  It has that early WW II, we're all in this together boys -- petty gangsters or not! -- feel.

It probably helps that I'm a big William Demarest fan.  Probably best known for playing Uncle Charlie on the ""My Three Sons"" sit-com, Demarest had a fine film career as comic actor.  He was a regular in the great Preston Sturges films of the 1940s.  It's good to see him here in a similar role.  The presence of the young Phil Silvers and Jackie Gleason is also a plus.  Although the dialog in their scenes could have been better, you can still see hints of their later TV stardom.  I was also impressed with Kaaren Verne as the female lead.  She's very attractive and gives an adequate performance.  I'm surprised that she didn't have a better career.  Fun trivia note:  She was later married briefly to Peter Lorre, who also appears in this film.

Finally, the print is really first rate.  Kudos to Warner Brothers for doing a good job with this unjustly neglected film.",1281139200,3,1430,4.455598455598456

1941 was one of the most hectic years for the US. The depression was over and an age of prosperity had begun. The United States industry was richer than ever before and Franklin D Roosevelt had secured the USA as the greatest superpower on earth, and in December of 1941 the US entered WWII after Japanese forces bombed Pearl Harbour.
1941 was a great year for Hollywood too and every major studio easily managed to release a new picture every week. Cinemas would hardly have enough room to show all the films made and some of the great films only lasted a few days in theatres to make way for new ones. Stars were getting more freedom from their contracts and many studios scrapped the idea of forcing their actors into movies they didn't want to do. Biopics were the favourite genre at the time, but in the 40's the most major films were the propaganda films. Almost every film that came out had a star in it, and almost every one of those films showcased America's greatness, beauty and freedom. Whether it was a hard hitting war film, a musical drama or an espionage thriller, propaganda films were everywhere and immensely popular.

Synopsis

Gloves Donahue (Humphrey Bogart) is the kindest gangster around. He gives money to his friends, he's loyal to his neighbourhood and he stays in touch with his mum, and when Gloves doesn't get the proper cheesecake from Charlies Restaurant (supplied by Mr Miller's bakery for over 10 years), he gets angry.
Gloves is told Mr Miller (Ludwig Stossel) did not deliver his cheesecake. For now Gloves decides not to worry about it but is later contacted by his mother (Jane Darwell) and urged to come to Miller's Bakery quick. Gloves is told that Mr Miller hasn't been in all day and his mum has a feeling that something is wrong (and when she's got a feeling, she's got a feeling!).
Gloves finds Miller's body and is approached later by a mysterious woman named Leda Hamilton (Kaaren Verne) who inquires about Miller but before Gloves has time to question her she leaves.

Ma Donahue follows her to the Duchess Club, but starts disrupting customers so the club's owner Marty Callahan (Barton MacLane) calls Gloves to pick her up. As Gloves goes to pick up his mum he sees Leda performing on stage with her accompanist, Pepi (Peter Lorre). As he tries to talk to Leda, Pepi interrupts and begins to take Leda away so Gloves grabs his arm. A bouncer at the club, Joe Denning (Edward Brophy) orders Gloves out of the club and follows Pepi and Leda into the back room where he is shot and killed by Pepi.

Gloves is accused of the murder and Pepi takes Leda away with him. With the police after him, Gloves and his men Sunshine (William Demarest) and Barney (Frank McHugh) get a new car and begin following Pepi, where they are led to a toy warehouse.
While investigating the warehouse Sunshine is kidnapped and Gloves is almost killed. Gloves goes to the elevator to pursue Sunshine's kidnapper but discovers nothing but walls and he can't detect the false wall.
Gloves decides to enter the building next door, an antique auctioning society led by Mr Ebbing (Conrad Veidt). Gloves begins interrogating Ebbing and his assistant, Madame (Judith Anderson), but is knocked out by Leda as she and Pepi enter the room through the false wall leading to the warehouse.

Leda later enters the room where both Sunshine and Gloves are tied up and she frees them before leaving once more without any explanation. Gloves and Sunshine discover that Ebbing is the leader of a secret Nazi Organization. Gloves and Sunshine intend to stop Ebbing by acquiring a book containing a list of the group's members. Gloves is shocked to find that Miller and Leda were both working with them and escapes the building taking her with him.

As Gloves attempts to go to the police station, Leda reveals to him that she is working for the Nazis so that they may free her father and that Miller was killed by Pepi for not co-operating with the Nazis. Leda also reveals to Gloves that the Nazis are having a major meeting that night and that Gloves has to stop it.

The Nazis catch up to Gloves and recover the books that Gloves took, but as they are escorting Leda and him from the building the police come to arrest Gloves. Ebbing and the other Nazis leave, telling the police that Gloves was trying to escape and they simply held him there.

The police don't believe Gloves and Leda's story but agree to go with them to search the auctioning house and find all the Nazi rooms abandoned and boxed up. Gloves escapes from the police and returns to his gang at their safe house just as they are being raided by Marty Callahan and his gang for supposedly killing Joe Denning. Gloves explains the problem to Callahan and they all decide to join forces to assault the Nazi stronghold.

Pepi bails Leda out of Prison by Pepi and is subsequently kidnapped, so while Callahan and most of Gloves gang search for recruits, Gloves, Sunshine and Barney follow Pepi to the new Nazi hide out, a toy shop.

Gloves and Sunshine infiltrate the meeting and discover that the Nazis are planning to blow up a battleship in the New York harbour that night. Pepi sees the two men and goes to tell Ebbing just as he is interrogating Leda. As Ebbing confronts Gloves a crowd of gangsters enter the building and defeat the Nazi's in a huge brawl. Ebbing and Pepi manage to escape and Ebbing decides that they will carry out the plans alone. Pepi refuses to embark on a suicide mission so is shot to death by Ebbing who then makes his way to the docks.

Gloves eventually tracks down Ebbing and kills Ebbing during a climactic battle on Ebbings boat, which explodes with him still in it. Gloves name is cleared and he is commended for his work. Gloves starts a relationship with Leda and everything is calm, but then Ma walks in with another concern about the milkman, and when she's got a feeling, she's got a feeling!

Review

`All Through the Night' is a hard hitting, fast paced gangster film, but it is not your average gangster film because these gangsters aren't fighting the cops, they're fighting Nazis! Of course it is propaganda, but this film is a lot of fun and has so many great actors in it you just can't help but get into the picture. Vincent Sherman is great with comedy and his directing talent is nothing short of fantastic.

Making Of

All Through the Night was made in 1941 which was during WWII, but before the USA entered into the war. All Through the Night was made for the war effort, to showcase how great America is, even the gangsters are patriots!
This was the 3rd film that was offered to Humphrey Bogart after George Raft declined the roles (the first being High Sierra of 1941, the second The Maltese Falcon of 1941 and later Casablanca of 1942). Olivia DeHavilland was also offered a role in the film but declined. The film was one of the first major films directed by Vincent Sherman, who had originally been an actor on the stage and even understudying for Claude Rains.
Sherman got many contracted actors in supporting roles and many comedians for the roles of the gangsters.
`All Through the Night' was released on the 2nd of December, 1941: 5 days before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. Suddenly the war became a very serious thing and simple pro-America films wouldn't do. Comedies were out and especially when they were comedies about the war. Another reason it was unpopular was that it depicted the threat of Nazis and after pearl harbour US citizens were far more concerned about the Japanese aggressors then the Nazis in Europe. The film lasted only a few weeks before it went back to the shelves on the Warner Bros lot. After Bogart's success in `Casablanca' 91942 with Claude Rains), Warner's re-released the film in the hopes that wartime comedies were back in. The re-release was a huge success and audiences flocked to the film.

Cast & Crew

Vincent Sherman, the director: Vincent Sherman was a Jew born in Vienna in 1906 and became an actor on the Broadway stage in his teens after escaping a tormented childhood. Sherman worked as an understudy for character actor Claude Rains who helped give him his first directing role on a play in 1933. Sherman moved to films in 1939 where he directed `The Return of Dr X' (1939 with Humphrey Bogart) and was contracted by Warner Bros in 1940. Sherman made a few films in his career including his first major film, Saturday's Children (1940 with John Garfield, Claude Rains and George Tobias) where Rains actually had to help him with his directing as he felt uneasy telling his former superior what to do. Sherman's films included `Mr Skeffington' (1944 with Bette Davis, Claude Rains in an Academy Award nominated performance and Jerome Cowan), `The Adventures of Don Juan' (1948 with Errol Flynn and Alan Hale) and `Affair in Trinidad' (1952 with Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth). In the early 1950's Warner Bros fired him after federal agents began investigating him. Sherman was put on trial for communist acts and supporting communism by the House of Un-American Activities. Sherman denied the allegations but like many other actors, directors and writers during that time, was blacklisted for the remainder of his life from Hollywood. His name meant nothing to Hollywood anymore who refused to accept him, he went to prison for a year and was put under constant surveillance for the rest of his life. With his career in ruins because of the allegations of the government and the non-cooperative of Hollywood executives, Sherman went on to direct a few TV shows. Sherman passed away in 2006 aged 99.

Humphrey Bogart as Gloves Donahue: Humphrey Bogart was born on Christmas day 1899 and began regular stage performances in 1922. Bogart became friends with actors Spencer Tracy and Leslie Howard while on the stage and it was thanks to Howard that he landed a role in his first major film, `The Petrified Forest' (1936 with Bette Davis and Leslie Howard). Bogart was so grateful he named his daughter Leslie in commemoration. Even though he had a huge success in `The Petrified Forest', Bogie was signed into a contract as a supporting player and appeared in many great classics (so many I will not list the numerous actors and directors in which he worked with). Between 1936 and 1940 he appeared in `Bullets or Ballots', `San Quentin', `Dead End', `Crime School', `The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse', `Angels with Dirty Faces', `Dark Victory', `The Roaring Twenties', `The Return of Dr X', `Brother Orchid' and `They Drive By Night'. Bogie had 2 big breaks in 1941 and both were turn downs by actor George Raft. These films were Raoul Walsh's `High Sierra' (with Ida Lupino, Henry Travers and Jerome Cowan) and John Huston's `The Maltese Falcon' (1941 with Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre). After that he had considerable success in (again so many memorable classics that I cannot go into detail) `Across the Pacific', `Casablanca', `Action in the North Atlantic', `Sahara', `Passage to Marseille' and `To Have and Have Not' where he met his wife, fellow actor Lauren Bacall. Bogart then appeared in numerous films like `The Big Sleep', `Dead Reckoning', `Dark Passage', `The Treasure of the Sierra Madre', `Key Largo', `Knock on Any Door', `In A Lonely Place', `The Enforcer', `Sirocco' and `The African Queen' for which he won an academy award for best actor (1951). After that role he stopped appearing so frequently in films but many of his films were still the blockbusters people expected from a Bogart film. Bogart became seriously ill in 1952 and continued to suffer throat cancer for the rest of his life. Bogart and his wife campaigned against Hollywood Blacklisting and led a parade of stars along Sunset Blvd in 1952 in protest to the House of Un-American Activities. His later films include John Huston's `Beat the Devil' (1953 with Robert Morley and Peter Lorre), `The Caine Mutiny' (1954 with Van Johnson, Fred MacMurray and Jose Ferrer), Billy Wilder's `Sabrina' (1954 with Audrey Hepburn, William Holden and John Williams), Joseph L Mankiewicz's `The Barefoot Contessa' (1954 with Ava Gardner and Edmond O'Brien), Michael Curtiz's `We're No Angels' (1955 with Basil Rathbone and Peter Ustinov) and William Wyler's `The Desperate Hours' (1955 with Fredric March). Humphrey Bogart died shortly after his last film `The Harder They Fall' (1956 with Rod Steiger). He was only 57.
Conrad Veidt as Ebbing: Conrad Veidt was a very small actor when he played Cesare (1920's `The Cabinet of Dr Caligari'), and it made his career in Germany. After the film he continued to act in Germany, and his fame rose to the point that when Universal Studios hired a German expressionist director (Paul Leni) to create a film for them, he chose Conrad as his lead. The film was The Man Who Laughs, 1928. After the Man Who Laughs Veidt stayed in Hollywood, and saw the move as a blessing, a way to get away from hyperinflation and political wars, and acted in many films, eventually landing a contract with Warner Bros. Veidt was a staunch anti-Nazi since before he even left Germany, and there were even attempts at his life by Gestapo agents, yet during World War II he always played the Nazi, sometimes comically like in 1941's All Through the Night. Veidt's most famous role is that of Major Strasser in 1942's Casablanca. Casablanca was Veidt's last film before he died of a heart attack while playing golf with Arthur Field (a Hollywood executive) and his physician, Dr Bergman. Conrad's legacy is still apparent today in Batman's The Joker, which was modelled off of Veidt's portrayal in The Man Who Laughs.

Jane Darwell as Ma Donahue: Jane Darwell was born in 1879 in Missouri. She made her stage debut when she was 33 and her first film when she was 40. She moved into sound films very easily and was typecast in kindly, motherly roles. In 1939 she had her first important role in `The Rains Came' (1939 with Tyrone Power, Myrna Loy and Henry Travers) and in Victor Fleming's `Gone With the Wind' (1939 with Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh and Olivia DeHavilland). Darwell won an academy award in 1940 for her role in `The Grapes of Wrath' (1940 directed by John Ford with Henry Fonda and John Carradine) and furthered her career with roles in William A Wellman's `The Ox Bow Incident' 91943 with Henry Fonda, Dana Andrews and Anthony Quinn) and in John Ford's `My Darling Clementine' (1947 with Henry Fonda and Walter Brennan). Darwell was about to retire in 1957 when John Ford convinced her to continue and act in his next film, which she did. The film was John Ford's `The Last Hurrah' (1958 with Spencer Tracy, Wallace Ford, Basil Rathbone and John Carradine). She retired at the age of 80 in 1959 but came out of retirement twice for an episode of `The Alfred Hitchcock Hour' directed by Norman Lloyd in 1962 and for her performance as the Bird Lady in `Mary Poppins' (1964 with Julie Andrews and Dick van Dyke), where walt Disney himself visited her house and pleaded with her to do the film as he couldn't picture the film without her. Darwell died in 1967 of a heart attack. She was 87.

Peter Lorre as Pepi: Peter Lorre was born in Austria in 1904. Lorre ran away from home and pursued an acting career in Germany at a young age. As a young man he became a student of Sigmund Freud but ultimately abandoned medicine in the 1920's. He remained unknown until director Fritz Lang cast him in `M' (1931) as a psychopathic child killer. Lorre continued to appear in German films until the Nazi's came to power and he moved to Paris. Lorre then appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's `The Man Who Knew Too Much' (1934) and made his Hollywood debut in Karl Freund's `Mad Love' (1935 with Colin Clive). Lorre moved back to Paris after `mad Love' and appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's `Secret Agent' (1936 with John Gielgud). After the success of `Secret Agent', Lorre moved to Hollywood and was sought after by Fox Studios. During his time at Fox, Lorre made 8 `Mr Moto' films, where he played an Asian detective. The series was hugely popular and Lorre's distinct voice and face was imitated many times (most notably in Looney Tunes cartoons). Lorre became a very famous personality in Hollywood and on radio and in 1941 appeared in John Huston's `The Maltese Falcon' (1941 with Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor and Sydney Greenstreet). Lorre's other films included `All Through the Night' (1941 with Humphrey Bogart and Conrad Veidt), `Invisible Agent' (1942 with Sir Cedric Hardwicke), Michael Curtiz's `Casablanca' (1942 with Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt and Claude Rains), Frank Capra's `Arsenic & Old Lace' (1944 with Cary Grant, Jack Carson and Raymond Massey), Michael Curtiz's `Passage to Marseille' (1944 with Humphrey Bogart, Sydney Greenstreet and Claude Rains) and a series of films between 1944 and 1947 where he teamed up with actor Sydney Greenstreet. This film duo was very popular and both men became firm friends. It was Peter Lorre who convinced Humphrey Bogart to marry Lauren Bacall. Bogart was concerned about their age differences and Lorre simply told him that, ""Five good years are better than none!"" In 1948 Lorre had to appear at the House of Un-American Activities to testify. Lorre was interviewed by investigators and asked to name anyone suspicious he had met since coming to the US. He responded a week later by giving them a complete list of everyone he knew. In 1951 Lorre directed, wrote and acted in his own film `Der Verlorene' which was a huge success in Germany. Lorre appeared a lot less as a villain in the 1950's due to the fact that he was a lot heavier after his visit to Germany. Lorre, in his later life, appeared in John Huston's `Beat the Devil' (1953 with Humphrey Bogart and Robert Morley), Walt Disney's '20,000 leagues Under the Sea' (1954 with Kirk Douglas and James Mason), Michael Todd's `Around the World in 80 days' (1956 with David Niven and 40 other stars) and Rouben Mamoulian's `Silk Stockings' (1957 with Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse). In 1957 he attended the funeral of fellow horror actor Bela Lugosi and after seeing his body in his trademark Dracula cape, Lorre leaned over to Vincent price and asked, "" Do you think we should drive a stake through his heart just in case?"" Lorre worked with famous directors Irwin Allen (The Towering Inferno) and Roger Corman 3 times each for Allen in `The Story of mankind' (1957 with Ronald Colman, Vincent Price, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and John Carradine), `Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea' (1961 with Walter Pidgeon, Joan Fontaine and Henry Daniell) and `Five Weeks in a Balloon' (1962 with Red Buttons and Sir Cedric Hardwicke). He worked for Corman in 3 horror-comedies where he improvised many of his hilarious lines (some that caught co-stars so off guard you can see their reactions on screen). These were `Tales of Terror' (1962 with Vincent Price and Basil Rathbone), Edgar Allen Poe's `The Raven' (1963 with Vincent Price, Boris Karloff and Jack Nicholson) and `The Comedy of Terrors' (1963 with Boris Karloff, Vincent Price, Basil Rathbone and Joe E Brown). Lorre's last film was the Jerry Lewis comedy `The Patsy' (1964 with Jerry Lewis, Everett Sloane, Keenan Wynn and George Raft). He died in 1964 of a stroke.
Jackie Gleason as Starchy: Jackie Gleason was born in 1916 and became a comedian in his youth. Jackie performed in carnivals and became a bar keeper in New York until he got work in the 1940's in films. In 1951 he starred as Ralph Kramden in 7 `Cavalcade of Stars' episodes and landed himself his own TV series with this character. The TV series was called `The Honeymooners' (1955-1956) and ran for 39 episodes. The Honeymooners storyline lasted many more TV series where Gleason reprised his role as Kramden in all 78 episodes of `The Jackie Gleason Show' (1952-1957), 3 episodes of `Jackie Gleason and the American Scene Magazine' (1962-1966), and all 82 episodes of `The Jackie Gleason Show' (1966-1970). He also appeared as Ralph Kramden in 3 films. Apart from Ralph Kramden, Jackie Gleason also appeared in `The Hustler' (1961 with Paul Newman and George C Scott) and in his later years as Sheriff Buford T Justice in all 3 Smokey and the Bandit films. He died in 1987 of liver cancer.

Phil Silvers as Waiter: Phil Silvers was born in 1911 and began acting in his 20's. Silvers had an unimportant career until he won a Tony in 1952. After he won his first Tony award he was given his own comedy TV show (The Phil Silvers Show 1955-1959) playing Sgt Bilko. Silvers also appeared in `It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' (1963 with Spencer Tracy, Mickey Rooney and Terry-Thomas) and in his later career appeared in a memorable episode of `Kolchak: The Night Stalker' (1974-1975). Silvers died in 1985 after a lengthy film and TV career.
Wallace Ford as Spats Hunter: Wallace Ford was born as Samuel Jones in 1898 in England, and separated from his parents from a young age. Samuel lived in a strict, dictatorial orphanage and was transferred to the Toronto branch of the orphanage when he was 7. After that he lived with 17 foster families, the last of which being a farming family that used him as a slave. Samuel escaped the farming house when he was 11 and joined a vaudeville group called the Winnipeg Kiddies, in which he stayed in until 1914. Samuel took his name in honour of his friend called Wallace Ford, who was crushed to death by a railroad car. The two had `hoboed' their way into the USA across the trains and the Samuel (now Wallace Ford) managed to get work in theatrical groups and eventually in Broadway. Ford found work in Hollywood alongside Joan Crawford in `Possessed' (1931). Ford never played the leading man, but always played the wise-cracking, friendly faced character, and eventually landed supporting roles in 13 John Ford films. In the mid 1930's Wallace began a search for his birth parents, a search which drew world headlines. Ford found his birth parents and returned to Hollywood in 1936. Ford became a leading actor for a string of B pictures between 1940 and 1950, and returned as an A-list supporting actor as stocky, grizzled old timers in many westerns, political dramas and his last film in 1965 as Old Pa in `A Patch of Blue' (1965, with Sidney Poitier). Ford died in 1966 a few months after his lifelong partner, Martha Harworth died.

Barton MacLane as Marty Callahan: Barton MacLane was born in 1902 on Christmas day and started out as a musician. He published many of his works and played the violin, guitar and piano. MacLane became synonymous with the `heavy' good guy, the tough detective or cop who knows nothing but the law. MacLane was the epitome of the law that it was common slang for criminals to say to cops when they were caught, ""Don't give me that Barton MacLane."" MacLane appeared in mainly gangster films in William Keighley's `G Men' (1935 with James Cagney), William Keighley's `Bullets or Ballots' 91936 with Edward G Robinson and Humphrey Bogart), Fritz Lang's `You Only Live Once' (1937 with Henry Fonda, Jerome Cowan and Sylvia Sidney), `San Quentin' (1937 with Pat O'Brien, Humphrey Bogart and Ann Sheridan), Raoul Walsh's `High Sierra' (1941 with Humphrey Bogart, Joan Leslie, Ida Lupino, Henry Hull, Henry Travers and Jerome Cowan) and he appeared in 6 Torchy Blane films between 1937 and 1939 as Detective Lieutenant Steve MacBride. MacLane also had a few considerable roles in non-gangster films (though not necessarily against his typecast of detective) such as his roles as Detective Lieutenant Dundy in John Huston's crime drama `The Maltese Falcon' (1941 with Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Jerome Cowan and Elisha Cook Jr), John Canty in William Keighley's `The Prince and the Pauper' (1937 with Errol Flynn, Claude Rains and Henry Stephenson), Inspector Walgreen in the Universal Horror `The Mummy's Ghost' (1944 with Lon Chaney Jr, George Zucco, Frank Reicher and John Carradine), McCormick in John Huston's epic `The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' (1948 with Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston in an Academy Award winning performance and Tim Holt), General Hap Arnold, USAAF in `The Glenn Miller Story' (1954 with June Allyson, James Stewart, George Tobias and Louis Armstrong) and Police Commissioner Green in Frank Capra's `Pocketful of Miracles' (1961 with Glenn Ford, Bette Davis and Edward Everett Horton). MacLane stated in an interview that he enjoyed being typecast as a detective saying, ""You get so used to it you end up representing the law everywhere you go."" MacLane had a steady career up until his death in 1969. MacLane is perhaps best remembered for his role as General Peterson in the TV series `I Dream of Jeannie' (1965-1970).

THE DVD

The DVD I have is a slim cased Warner Bros DVD. It is region 1, meaning it won't play in most Australian DVD players and is not available in Australia. The special features include a commentary by the director Vincent Sherman and Humphrey Bogart biographer Eric Lax. The special features also include Warner Night at the Movies just like many other Warner Bros classic DVD's. Warner Night at the Movies includes a vintage newsreel, a popular Joe Doakes comedy short (So You Want to Give up Smoking?), a cartoon (Lights Fantastic) and 2 trailers (one for `All Through the Night'). The DVD also includes a short documentary about character actors, the supporting actors who helped make the classics what they are today. The documentary is called `Call the Usual Suspects: The Craft of the Character Actor'.

The story line is good and the acting is really good. Lots of laughs in it, even while it is full of drama. Americans vs. Nazis and of course, the Americans win.....",1275696000,,328,4.466666666666667
120002,2,0790746387,"There are no really bad Bogart movies (except maybe ""The Oklahoma Kid""), but ""All Through the Night"" certainly doesn't make it into his top 50. The film was the last of 4 films he did in 1941, and released on December 2, just prior to Pearl Harbor. ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""High Sierra"" were released earlier that year, and ""Casablanca"" would be released almost a year later. But don't even dream of comparing ""All Through the Night"" with these classics. It ranks more on a level with such forgettable Bogie films as ""The Wagons Roll at Night"" (1941) - the bevy of B films that Warner produced in the late 30s and early 40s to rehabilitate Bogart's character. Up until that point, Bogart had been the villain, often playing second fiddle to Warner's big time stars Jimmy Cagney and Edward G Robinson. But gangster films were being squeezed by the Hays Code and Robinson, Cagney, and Bogart were being slowly transformed to keep their box office cache.

To Bogart's good fortune, George Raft had turned down the leading roles in ""High Sierra"" and ""The Maltese Falcon"", as well as ""All Through the Night"". Though Raft was probably right about this film, he was deadly wrong about the other two, and Bogart's career took off while Raft's career floundered.

Bogart shares the screen with Peter Lorre and Conrad Veidt, both of whom would appear with him in ""Casablanca"" a few months later. Veidt was one of the best known German silent screen stars, appearing in ""The Cabinet of Dr Caligari"" (1920) among other classics. An anti-Nazi married to a Jew, Veidt fled Germany in 1933 when Hitler took power. He moved to England and then the US in 1940 where, ironically, he played the Nazi in several films such as ""Nazi Agent"" (1942) and ""Above Suspicion"" (1943). Veidt died of a heart attack in 1943. ""All Through the Night"" is one of his last films.

Peter Lorre was an international film star after his frightening portrayal of a child killer in ""M"" (1931). Like Veidt, Lorre was anti-Nazi and fled Germany in 1933. He was famed for his Mr. Moto series (1937 - 1939), and shared screen credits with Bogart in ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941), ""Casablanca"" (1942), and ""Passage to Marseille"" (1944).

The film is notable for the supporting cast which includes two later giants of TV who show glimmers of their later greatness - Jackie Gleason and Phil Silvers (aka ""Bilko"").

Also present is William Demarest who went on to TV fame as Uncle Charley in ""My Three Sons"" (1965 - 1972).  Other cast members include Barton MacLane playing a heavy (what else is new?) and Frank McHugh playing the amusing side kick. McHugh's chubby face appeared in more than 100 films including ""The Roaring Twenties"" (1939), ""Virginia City"" (1940), and ""Mighty Joe Young"" (1949). In the 50s he turned to TV where he appeared in dozens of shows, remembered best as Willie from ""The Bing Crosby Show"" (1964-5).

The great Jane Darwell is completed wasted in this film as Bogart's Irish mother. Darwell is best remembered as Grandma Joad in ""The Grapes of Wrath"" for which she received the Oscar. But this was one of nearly 200 films in which she appeared, and she made major contributions to films such as ""GWTW"" (1939), and with Henry Fonda in ""Jesse James"" (1939), ""The Ox Bow Incident"" (1943), and ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946).

Vincent Sherman directs. The film begins as a fast paced comedy and shortly turns into a spy movie, but the transition is awkward and attempts to maintain the comedy are not successful. Although he was a busy director and worked on dozens of films (""Mr. Skeffington"", ""Adventures of Don Juan""), his work was relatively undistinguished. Indeed, parts of ""All Through the Night"" clearly lag. Sherman was investigated by HUAC which ended his film career and he made the transition to TV where he worked on series such as ""The Waltons"", ""Baretta"" and ""77 Sunset Strip"".

As part of the pre WW2 Hollywood propaganda, the film has some interest. The Warner Brothers hated the Germans, and they put out several pre-War films warning about the menace (e.g., ""Confessions of a Nazi Spy"" in 1939). What is very interesting is that Bogart discovers that the heroine's father is in a ""concentration camp"" named Dachau. For such info to be appearing in a Hollywood film in 1941 is strange indeed when many claim to have had no knowledge of concentration camps.

1941 was still not a year for much anti-German or pro-American film. ""Sergeant York"" and Michael Curtiz' ""Dive Bomber"" were the only major films that year with any kind of war message. But 1942 was a standout year, with Cagney's ""Yankee Doddle Dandy"" (Best Actor), ""Wake Island"", the ""49th Parallel"" (aka ""The Invaders""), ""To Be or Not To Be"", and ""Mrs. Miniver"" (Best Picture). 1943 would see ""Casablanca"" (Best Picture), ""Watch on the Rhine"" (Best Actor), ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" (Best Supporting Actress), ""The Ox Bow Incident"", ""In Which we Serve"" and ""Forever and a Day.""

Some people recommend this film as an example of Bogart's comedy skills. Personally, I don't see it. Most of the comedy is supplied by Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason, and Frank McHugh, and Bogart is the straight man. There is a scene at a Nazi spy meeting in which Bogart attempts comedy, but it is awkward. Bogart was in several other films that were light hearted (e.g., ""Sabrina"", ""Swing Your Lady"", ""We're No Angels"") but he never did really well in these, and he's clearly better suited to the gangster films of the 30s and the detective films of the 40s and 50s.",1269043200,7,5496,4.780821917808219
120003,5,0790746387,"This must be one of ""Bogies"" unknown movies.

120004,3,0790746387,"It is very hard to mix humor into a plot involving Nazi spies in New York City.  Yet that is what was attempted here, mostly without success. ""All Through the Night"" has its moments with Humphrey Bogart as a big city gambler trying to crack a nefarious crew led by Conrad Veidt. There is lots of sharp dialog, banter 'twixt Bogey and his pals, a fine supporting cast and some tense moments. Watch for cameos with Jackie Gleason and Phil Silvers. The transfer to DVD is also very well done but in the end the mix does not gel. This was the very next movie after ""Casablanca"" for both HB and CV.  Perhaps they missed the discipline imposed on that set by helmer Michael Curtiz, a tough taskmaster. It's always interesting to remind ourselves that the stiff-necked Veidt was actually a British citizen in his final years.",1249776000,,818,4.557823129251701

120006,3,0790746387,"Bogart was in good form as a racketeer, who comes up against Nazi spies, headed by Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre, and Judith Anderson, and prefers patriotism to the profits of crime...

Several things seriously frightened the film's success... It was released very shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, a bad time for portraying a quasi-realistic spy tale in a laughable manner...

The film also suffered from an overt case of ""cuteness"" in its dialog, with such lines as ' Say, there's more here than meets the FBI.,' being uttered all too frequently by Bogart and his comic retinue which included Frank McHugh, William Demarest, Jackie Gleason, and Phil Silvers...

Another weak point in the film was completely unbelievable ""cliffhanger"" ending which found Veidt driving a speedboat loaded with explosives toward a battleship...

In spite of these minor irritants, the film did give Bogart a chance to do some very creditable comedy work and on the whole it still entertains...",1232755200,,981,5.1125

First of all, it's basically a comedy & that makes it an unusual vehicle for Bogey. He does have the ability to pull it off though it's not his forte. The film takes place during WWII; Bogey is a bit of a shady character attempting to stop the saboteurs of the Third Reich operating in the U.S.A. The movie has its dramatic moments but it's really plain old entertainment. Phil Silvers has a small role, Jackie Gleason has a smaller one. There aren't any bonus features, however, but the DVD quality is excellent. Enjoy Bogey in a different type of movie, there's a chance you might realize he could do other things other than being a tough guy.",1198108800,2,760,4.359154929577465

120009,4,0790746387,"""All Through the Night"" is a 1942 Warner Brother's production starring Humphrey Bogart in one of the first films he made once his status as a superstar was established after ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""High Sierra"". The film starts as a comedy but quickly develops into a thriller in the vein of ""The Thirty Nine Steps"". The director, Vincent Sherman, in his own words, borrowed from Hitchcock but neither the comedy nor the suspense really come off. The film is well made but  drawn out.

Bogart plays Gloves Donahoe, heading a gang along Broadway who stumble across fifth columnists. Bogart is miscast as a Damon Runyan character although he is still entertaining. His henchman, such as William Demarest and Frank McHugh, are too heavy handed, lacking the whimsical touch necessary to be funny. Phil Silvers and Jackie Gleason are there too. Vincent Sherman, in the worthwhile commentary attached to the film, explains that both comedians were handed to him so he suggested they provide some material for themselves. Neither make much impression in their small roles. The film is filled with a great supporting cast such as Jane Darwell as Bogart's Irish mother, Peter Lorre as one of the Germans, Judith Anderson acting sinister and Conrad Veidt as their leader. All are excellent as usual but let down by the weak material. The film is really a B film elevated to A budget because Bogart was the lead. The leading lady is Kaaren Verne who looks like Alice Faye. Her part is pure cliche. Sherman's commentary is accompanied by the Bogart biographer, Eric Lax, who always bombards the viewer with endless biographical facts about the players. At least here, he is slowed down because of the interpolation of Sherman.

The print of the film is first rate and there is an excellent documentary on character players although I would dispute the inclusion of Lorre and Veidt who were both major stars before reaching Hollywood and commanded more respect than being mere character actors. There is also another episode of Warner's Night at the Movies which includes a Joe McDoak's short on giving up smoking. The script cynically skirts the addictive nature of nicotine although the implication is clearly there. The newsreel focuses on the war and the cartoon is an unusual surreal number looking at the billboards on Broadway - very creative and amusing. Finally, there is a trailer for ""Gentlemen Jim"", one of Errol Flynn's best films, if you can cope with the Irish blarney.

As part of the Bogart Signature Collection Volume Two, the DVD is good value but you may not want to buy it on its own.",1163894400,7,2594,4.875283446712018
120010,4,0790746387,"Nazi fifth columnists, led by sinister, sadistic Peter Lorre as Pepi, are infiltrating a city, and big-time gambler Humphrey Bogart is there to weed them out. When a popular baker is found murdered, Bogart investigates. He's led to a warehouse and discovers a room filled with Nazi paraphernalia and a book that explains what happened to the baker (he also gets a lot of help from Kaaren Verne, who has been forced to play along with the Nazis). In a fiery climax, while a motorboat packed with explosives is being directed toward a battleship to blow it up, Bogart takes control, sees Lorre get killed, and then steers the boat away from the ship before diving overboard to safety. He gets a hero's welcome, of course, and Verne. Lorre is excellent as the evil Pepi, killing at will and at another point smashing the fingers of a guy after losing his temper. There are a couple too many chase scenes, so that the picture seems to go on too long - probably too long by 10 minutes. Seeing Nazi fifth columnists meet their doom, however, was just what 1942 audiences wanted. Incidentally, Jackie Gleason and Phil Silvers make appearances in small roles.

Consider the 1942 release...the war was at it's peak. Then there's Bogie, playing a likeable gangster who makes good with rival gangsters to beat up a Nazi infiltration in NYC. Add tons of humor and the beautiful Kaaren Verne, and you have a delightful mix of suspense, angst, intrigue and American triumph (as well as a cute love story). It may not be a great film, but I think it's my favorite Bogie film, if only because it's so much fun to watch. Where's the DVD? UPDATE: The Humphrey Bogart Vol 2 includes this fine film, and the resolution and presentation is crystal clear. ""Let's knock those heels back on their axis...""",1088812800,6,860,4.8175675675675675
120012,4,0790746387,"ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT is an interesting World War II movie starring Humphrey Bogart as a New York gambler who becomes suspicious of a gang of Nazi spies after the baker of his favorite cheese cakes is murdered. The film's plot may seem too simplistic but the strong cast and occasional crackling dialogue help to make it enjoyable. Above all it is the cast which lifts this movie out of the B category.
Suspense is built around a Nazi plan to sink a large American battleship close to New York City in order to cause widespread panic. Conrad Veidt is the head Nazi spy and his cheif henchman is Peter Lorre. Kaaren Verne is an unwilling accomplice whose father is being detained by the Nazis in Germany. She is also a cabaret singer and Bogart is trying to rescue her from the clutches of the bad guys. The strong supporting cast includes Jane Darwell, Frank McHugh, Judith Anderson, William Demarest, Jackie Gleason, Phil Silvers and Barton MacLane.
In terms of Bogart's filmography this movie falls between THE MALTESE FALCON and CASABLANCA. The film's ending may seem highly improbable but the patriotic message is unmistakeable and suitable for the times.",1084924800,,1159,4.8291457286432165
