4911145,5,B005ZMBDYA,"Fantastic hidden gem that dives into the mediocrity of modern life and the struggles we all face to find ourselves. The characters in the film are very relatable, and I really like how the film depicts marriage in a realistic but not overhanded way, as is typical in dramas.

Note: the film is not ""starring"" Alia Shawkat and Kelli Garner as mentioned in the description. Both of them only make very minor appearances.",1435536000,,418,4.726027397260274
4911146,4,B005ZMBDYA,"Perhaps a 4-star rating is a bit of a stretch, but sort of necessary in this case to take away from the more negative tone of the reviews submitted here on amazon so far.  It's a 3.5.  This is a drama just so you know, NOT a comedy.

It's about a man who's so confused over the important choices he's made concerning his career and family -and the choices he wants to make in the future- that he eventually gets caught up in a lie with his boss.  He doesn't want to go into work one day (despite making an effort to arrive to the parking lot) so what does he do?  He does what we're all guilty of from time to time- lying.  However none of us ever lied like THIS crazy guy did.  He actually says his baby daughter died, however he feels so guilty about it, he wants nothing to do with the sympathetic people in his life willing to be there for him during this ""tough time"" so he sort of ignores their apologies.

Of course it's completely outrageous that anyone would say a lie to *this* extent.  Even at your very angriest you wouldn't say such an enormous lie knowing the consequences FAR outweigh whatever emotions you're feeling at the moment.  But... for the sake of a compelling movie storyline, why not?

Well unfortunately it's not a compelling storyline, despite the fact that it most certainly could (and should) have been.  It's rather ordinary and wanders aimlessly most of the time.  The man has a friend who prefers to live his days on the beach experiencing total freedom.  As this friend explains, his lie-telling friend made these family and career decisions, so you sort of have to stand by them.  Perhaps the most memorable character is the guys boss, who gets agitated very easily when people make excuses not to come into work.

I also love the segment when the man shares a song he wrote with his wife, and... his wife visibly HATES it but you know, since she's his wife, she's like ""Oh wow, that's a great song!  Has a great beat!  You have real talent sweetie!"" so as not to damage his self-esteem.  Yeah... let's be honest about that song- it has a great beat and not much else.  Bad vocals (and a HORRIBLE attempt at hitting the high notes- my goodness that was one rough moment... two moments actually), generic guitar riff, and it repeats like mad.  Bad song, haha.

My favorite part is definitely the ending when the man finally gets caught up in the lie so it comes back to haunt him.  You know, it's such an incredible lie you already *knew* this moment of storytelling was coming, though admittedly it's revealed in a really nice outburst of emotions that I consider pretty awesome.  I totally expected... well, don't want to spoil it.  The wife's facial expressions are BEYOND fantastic- they are entirely believable.  She's in total disbelief.  If it wasn't for the emotional explanation that takes place during the final 20 minutes, I'd have given this film a 2-star rating.

Overall, expect an unorganized and lackluster storyline to dominate most of the film, but the actual aspect that matters most (the lie) is worth sticking with it.",1370908800,,3073,4.548269581056466
4911147,4,B005ZMBDYA,"This item was purchased via Amazon for my nephew as a Christmas present.  The DVD was delivered on scheduled and is being enjoyed by my nephew. It was a special request by him as he loves this film and wanted a copy for himself.

4911148,4,B005ZMBDYA,movie about the power of love to forgive and adapt.  These characters are not all that original but the situation is.  We see a loving happy couple coping with impossible career dilemmas.  I enjoyed the fact that you have no idea how it will resolve because deep down they share common values and goals.,1335744000,,303,4.574074074074074
4911149,2,B005ZMBDYA,"the plot is well summarized by other review and so i'll only talk about how i feel about this movie-this is a very awkward movie. many scenes in the movie are kind of awkward. i guess i can sympathize with the main characters and their life and pressures, but that does not take any awkwardness away. my wife thinks this is one of the worst movies she has seen this year. i feel it isn't that bad but not really worth the money DVD, unless you watch movie to find out the meaning of being an adult and being alive instead of just to get some entertainment...",1330473600,,558,4.224299065420561
4911150,3,B005ZMBDYA,"Or maybe just irritating.  This is one of those organic couples having some silly existential crisis. The guy does not want to go to work anymore so he makes up a horrible lie about his kid, and his wife eventually finds out about it.  They also have a stoner friend who lives out of camper on a beach parking lot.  Self-indulgent twits.",1328832000,,337,4.403225806451613
4911151,5,B005ZMBDYA,"I saw The Lie at Sundance last year, and it was by far the best film I saw there.  It is a deceptively simple premise - a guy lies about the death of his baby in order to avoid going into work because he's feeling beat down and depressed about the state of his life.  Director Joshua Leonard riffs on this idea (from a short story by T.C. Boyle) like a jazz musician to create a story about ambition, love, and what truly matters in life.
The acting is all-around fantastic.  Leonard, Jess Wexler, and Mark Webber in particular build three-dimensional characters that you fall in love with, even as they stumble about the business of being adults.  And the supporting cast provides hilarious moments of weirdness and wisdom.
Like Sideways or Humpday, this is a film that revels in the small moments of life and reminds us why human beings are worth loving, despite the bad actions we sometimes take.  It is laugh-out-loud funny, while at the same time deeply emotional.  I definitely anticipate multiple viewings.",1326672000,10,1013,4.694915254237288

I liked how he recognized something was missing in his life, and his decision to do something about it.  I just hope it works out for them.",1457308800,,313,4.166666666666667

8489848,5,B005ZMBDYA,"This movie had an innovative storyline about how a small lie born out of frustration with life and circumstances can turn into a life changing moment.  I can really see this happening. The people who gave this a bad review haven't lived long enough to know how crazy life can get and how for so many of us, life did not turn out at all how we planned it to when we were young.  A fantastic movie for people who are at that certain age when you either have to settle for what life has given you, or have the courage to change it for the better.",1519862400,,543,4.065420560747664
8489849,4,B005ZMBDYA,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Related to the protagonist a great deal.  I've stood almost exactly where he stood.  I didn't tell the same lie he did, but I do relate to the lengths he went because he literally couldn't face another day at his soul-killing job.  I understand he had a family to support, which I didn't at the time, or at least not to the degree he did, but some things just aren't worth putting up with.  Life's too short.  Peter from Office Space had it right.  And what a boss to work for, eh?  Abusive much?  Though he did seem to care at the end.  But yeah, I've so been there.  And never going back.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494806400,,1675,4.4506578947368425
