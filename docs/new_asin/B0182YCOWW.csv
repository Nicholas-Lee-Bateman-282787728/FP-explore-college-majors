7539003,5,B0182YCOWW,"Good, very mystical..... Priests, Alien encounter, premonitions, mysterious stranger being seen over decades helping others who they think is Christ... watched it twice in one go.",1458259200,,179,5.923076923076923
7539004,1,B0182YCOWW,I would give it a negative star review if I could.,1458000000,,50,3.6363636363636362
7539005,1,B0182YCOWW,"A bunch of regular guys get together and decide to make a movie for a couple of hundred bucks over the weekend is what this movies appears to be. They use some reference to the Phoenix Lights as bait to get suckers to watch this non-movie. No plot, no effects and I was not even able to follow what the movie was supposed to be about, just some guys fooling around with some cameras. This film makes the blair witch project look like gone with the wind.",1456876800,4,453,4.218390804597701
7539016,3,B0182YCOWW,It was just okay. Not what I thought is was going to be.,1479168000,,56,3.3846153846153846
7539017,3,B0182YCOWW,"For some reason I liked it. It was quirky, at times it made no sense. I guess that is part of why I liked it. I tried to find symbolism where there might not have been any. So that part was kind of fun. I'm a Christian and found some parts of this creepy",1479081600,,254,3.7222222222222223
7539018,3,B0182YCOWW,"Ok [SPOILERS], it doesnt deserve 3 stars, but im being kind.  I slept thru parts, and still figured out that somehow these 2 strange priests [Michael, and Daniel ..hmmm] both troubled  & some guy named Jimmy and  the Alien /Jesus, [new age dude] share a connection..kind of.
Still never found out what great thing the priest named Michael did to save the world. It ended with some cute little black children running... and carrying papers????
Anyway,
It could have been done an hour cause I never figured out how his almost affair  with a lone choir member fits in. Or Jimmy's stalking if the Jesus/Alien guy until he meets an asian girl he lost years before ..

Oh Jimmy knew Alien/Jesus in viet nam too I think.
And Alien/Jesus gets injured and heals himself.
That scene is a blur cause I slept thru how he got injured. Awoke to him standing half naked in the desert. Oh well. They needed someone to be eye candy I guess.
Jimmy was old, the priest, a priest.
There now u can save 4 dollars. Or rent it if u have insomnia.
Sorry to the real Jesus, you'd make a better story.",1478822400,2,1075,4.409090909090909

7539020,1,B0182YCOWW,"Where to begin, couldn't watch more than 60 seconds in a row. If there was a zero or a minus one, than I'd have given it that. What a complete waste of bandwidth and storage space. Save yourself some time and don't even click it",1478044800,2,228,4.088888888888889
7539021,4,B0182YCOWW,"Different movie with jumps in time, easy to get lost if you are distracted, however character development and story line end winning the day.",1477699200,,141,4.916666666666667
7539022,4,B0182YCOWW,"A fair movie at best.  I never quite got the connection with the ""man"" and the lights.  Maybe I wasn't paying attention.  He did seem to know Jesus.",1477612800,,148,4.214285714285714
7539023,3,B0182YCOWW,"Angel, Jesus, or ET? One part Close Encounters of the Third Kind and one part X files. Kind of slow story probably could have been made in 1 hour. Somewhat predictable ending. Had some short side stories that really was unneccesary, like the theft of the box, the guy pulling a gun on the Priest because he thought he was having an affair with his wife.",1477267200,,353,4.363636363636363
7539024,5,B0182YCOWW,This movie is a must watch for anyone who has ever looked up and wondered. The movie blew my mind!,1476576000,,98,3.95
7539025,2,B0182YCOWW,Literally made me fall asleep a couple of times.,1475884800,,48,4.444444444444445
7539026,1,B0182YCOWW,"promises of a plot never develop. secrets never revealed. a bunch of hype with no actual meaning, spiritual or otherwise. On the plus side, it could be used as a cure for insomnia. Amazon made me give it 1 star, which is 1 more than it deserved.",1472774400,,245,4.23404255319149
7539027,1,B0182YCOWW,Did not like!,1471392000,,13,3.6666666666666665

7539029,5,B0182YCOWW,movie was kind  of  believable,1470009600,,30,4.8
7539030,3,B0182YCOWW,I give it 3 stars for an interesting movie without any star power and a low budget but still nicely done.,1470009600,,105,4.0476190476190474
7539031,3,B0182YCOWW,"Some good acting. Looked like they had a good budget and made the best of multiple takes to let that acting shine. And then the budget ran out. I know it has the religious undertones, but that is not my focus. It was shot very well (until the end). The director took great pleasure in plagiarizing Fellini to a great extent. Too much in many scenes. I know Tarantino did it too, but with finesse. This director did it blatantly. A little better rewrite would not have hurt.",1469145600,,473,4.386363636363637
7539032,3,B0182YCOWW,"Lacks in continuity and flow of plot....a bit disconnected. Interesting concepts, the again, known.",1467676800,,99,6.142857142857143
7539033,3,B0182YCOWW,"at first i was interested by the ""lights phenomenon"", very soon into the film i became very concerned (well not ""pain in the chest concerned"", but ""oh crap i mighta just invited some Mormons into my home"" concerned), but the movie line stayed just north of the ""preachy"".  i absolutely believe that something was amiss in the desert that night.  these stories are more of an attempt to ""document"" the weirdness that came about.
i don't feel like a better more educated human after having watched this, but at the same time i am kinda glad i did.
the point of my review is (i hope) that if this film means something to you---you are gonna get a lot out of it, but if you get bored easy and fruit-flies have a greater intellect and attention span---you should skip it!  you can always rewatch a jackass movie, or some cartoons---",1466899200,,827,4.5
7539034,4,B0182YCOWW,"No I can't say it was a very good movie, dragged on, was too long in some parts, boring at times, slow....but as the movie begins to move along, if you have an open and willing heart, as you stay along with the journey, like in life, in its mysteries and messages given to us, you will in the end understand the message in the end.....",1466812800,2,335,4.090909090909091

8741250,1,B0182YCOWW,"No! Nice try, but urine filled jars is just that and not art. And this was not art nor entertaining. It was confused, wondering, bable, and in most cases incoherent. It like looking at modern performance art it makes you feel sad and embarrassed for the strange creatures connected with the project. I thought it had a bud of an idea or story for a moment or two then it went to lala land on a jet plane. Most likely it will make as much money as a gender studies graduate does in a lifetime which ain't much.",1511568000,,509,4.204081632653061

8741252,4,B0182YCOWW,"This isn't a movie to have friends over to watch, but it was worthwhile watching. Very good use of lighting and camera angles.",1505865600,,126,4.521739130434782

8741255,1,B0182YCOWW,"This is now literally the worst movie I have ever seen. This would be an F if it were simply a high school film project. The acting is terrible, the writing is awkward, there is no sense of cohesion to the story, or even a story for that matter. At many times I had to wonder if it had been edited wrong, since it seemed to be a series of random scenes with no apparent relation to one another, except for the same actors being in a few of them. At one point we are in Mexico and everyone is speaking Spanish. No subtitles, no voice over, no explanation as to why we are suddenly in Mexico. Many of the scenes don't seem to have any purpose at all other than to add time to the movie. I am a connoisseur of bad movies, but this is a case where, if I met the people who made it, I would look them in the eyes and suggest that they consider another line of work.",1495411200,,860,3.9482758620689653

8741257,1,B0182YCOWW,"Anytime I spend an inordinate about of time looking at scenery, people walking, characters breathing and making complex facial reactions as the camera lingers, I know I am looking at a bad movie. There is no story here, not even a suggestive insight.",1481500800,,250,4.837209302325581
8741258,5,B0182YCOWW,Better than expected!,1480896000,,21,6.333333333333333
8741259,1,B0182YCOWW,"This movie is a long hot mess. I didn't know what was going on half the time, and I didn't care. How do you make a movie this bad? It's a real art form. Bad acting, terrible script, pointless events, disconnection after disconnection. Words fail me. AVOID! BEWARE! DO NOT WATCH! DO NOT SPEAK OF THIS MOVIE! IT'S NOT A MOVIE; IT'S A PUNISHMENT FOR BORED PEOPLE. HAVE I DIED AND GONE TO HELL?",1479168000,,390,4.283783783783784
