It's worth buying! Oh yeah, buy Kid Buu - Saiyan Pride too! It's
the first of the Kid Buu DVDs. I'll write a review for that too.
More reviews to come for the Kid Buu series!",1034726400,2,360,4.013888888888889
1712010,5,B000066737,My favorite saga of all time. Goku and Vegeta have loured Kid Buu to the kai planet. Playing rock paper and scissors they decide who will fight him. Im not going to give away all the great goodies. Im just going to say that the fight between goku and  buu is the greatest fight ever. The plan that vegeta comes up with is an amazing one. This saga is the greatest saga and should be on everyone list for buying. Its also the end of DBZ so all the DBZ fans out there should definately be trying to get this set.,1084665600,5,510,4.0495049504950495
1712011,5,B000066737,"Okay, to begin: if you like DBZ and you don't mind spending money, get this. It's five discs and they all come in individual cases, each labeled nicely and look cool.
The DVDs:
1. Kid Buu- Regression
This one's okay, kind of boring at times
Three episodes
2. Kid Buu- Saiyan Pride
This is when the good fights start
Three episodes
3. Kid Buu- Vegita's Plea
This one's cool, good fights and not too boring
Three episodes
4. Kid Buu- The Price Of Victory
This is prolly the best of the DVD's because it's a huge relief and you get to see an old technique at it's best
Three episodes
5. Kid Buu- A New Begining
The first episode of this sucks. The other three are a lot better though and you get to see Goku fight someone new...kind of. I won't give it away but Goku has a new friend. And Chi-chi gets mad at him-again.
Four episodes
With a total of 16 episodes, this is a great saga to own.
The extras are okay, nothing that exciting.
It's kinda funny to watch in Japanesse because the voices are so...odd. And it's cool that it's uncut because unlike when it's on Cartoon Network, they actually show blood and things like that. I really like how it's on DVD because you can skip the begining song which is really annoying. Also, you can skip to any episode and any part of the episode you want with the chapter selection thing. There is one thing I didn't like about seeing it uncut and that was Goku's..yeah. Gross. The sound quality is pretty nice, stereo on english but Mono in Japaneese, I think. I recomend this to any DBZ fan over 12. If you buy it, enjoy.",1079654400,17,1561,4.294915254237288
1712012,5,B000066737,"It's a great dvd, Lots of fighting and action scenes, comprehendible, well done, and full of hot anime.",1074988800,2,103,4.777777777777778
1712013,5,B000066737,"The Kid Buu Saga is mainly hear to showcase the final round between Goku, Vegeta, and the weak Kid Buu. While Kid Buu is rather weak compared to the other Buu's, Vegeta and Goku are weaker too. This keeps the action pretty intense and the ending (in the second to last DVD I mean) really suprised me. The final DVD is pretty nice and we get to see what happens ten years later. (I will not spoil anything.)
Anyway, the point is that this box set is really a great collection to have and watching the big fight uncut is a really great thing too. Enjoy it.",1072742400,12,554,4.186915887850467
1712014,5,B000066737,"DBZ was really falling there. There was alot of useless nonsence and alot of playing around with enemies. These battles are for real. Although Kid Buu does play around with the Z warriors a little because he is stupid, we do get to see Goku in action as SSJ3. The series really does a great job here with the music. Every scene has the music perfectly timed and it completely blows away the japanese version which has no music except a few times. Also, the focus is on Goku and Vegeta. Krillin and Piccolo have gotten really annoying in the past saga or so. They always state the obvious like saying, ""Goku just powered up!(while krillin shakes in disbelief like he does for everything)"".
As for the boxed set, mehhh. 60 bucks is pretty good deal on all the kid buu dvds. The best thing though(besides the stupid ending) is that the battles really pick up. Although it has gotten a bit stupid with 500,000,000 power levels, Akira does a good job of animating the battles like they are the best in the universe. Still... Watch the first saga and see Goku and Vegeta both use their best techniques. The ground shakes and flys everywhere. They had power levels of 15,000. With a power level of 500,000,000 a single ki blast should wipe out the entire planet but instead it leaves a small crater and some dust. I know that sounds stupid but it is the truth, the power levels have gone out of control and are just stupidly high now. Just get this boxed set if you want to see the last of the good battles.",1072137600,3,1500,4.418772563176895
1712015,5,B000066737,"After about the 80 episode reign of Majin Buu it all comes to an end. i am not going to tell you how buu is killed , but you probably already know. Goku fights Buu as a super saiyan 3 and is putting up a good fight. Vegeta, being only a super saiyan 2, is no match for Kid Buu. THIS PART IS UNBELIEVABLE: Vegeta finally admits he will never be as strong as goku and lets him fight Majin Buu first. After Buu is killed 2 obvious people become friends after a 230 some episode fight.",1068336000,2,481,3.9690721649484537
1712016,4,B000066737,This dvd includes the finale to dbz. A must have for hardcore fans! I plan to get this as soon as it comes out! The only reason I rated it 4-star was because the batles stink. The only reason a none-hardcore fan should buy this is because of the final showdown of Buu and Goku. The price should be a bit lower though. I am still getting this!,1064188800,2,342,4.044117647058823
1712017,5,B000066737,"This DVD is perhaps the best DVD I have seen of DBZ. The fight sequences are well-choreographed and the story intriguing. The animation is great and the repetitive animations (the ones where the same few frames are shown again and again to symbolize length) are at a minimum. The sound, at least on the english audio, fits well. Also, there is quite a bit of stuff that will be cut out, making the purchase worthwhile. I have not yet seen the Japanese version yet, but I would buy this just for the english version.",1038355200,2,515,4.48936170212766
1712018,5,B000066737,"Majin Buu mutates into a monster not seen in serveral millenia, and Vegeta and Goku are the only warriors who are able to stop him. But once they have got back all their friends from inside Buu, it seems as though the battle may end sooner than anyone could have hoped. That is until Buu mutates into his original form, his power is unrivalled, and the first victim is earth itself. But who gives ... about that sort of stuff, if you want that read amazons review, heres the point of view of a fan of the saga. Who is yet to hear, speak or know of the end of this saga, the final one in the epic series of Dragonball Z.
In this DVD you will see the following:
 The origins of Majin Buu,
 Gokus magnificent transformation to Super Saiyen 3,
 Buus transformation to Kid Buu,
 Kid Buus awesome power,
 Destruction of Countless planets,
 Goku and Vegetas Sacrifice,
 Unbelievable action.
I refuse to tell you guys the plot, because to be quite honest its not fair to any of you. These episodes are yet to be shown anywhere, in DVD quality and English Dialogue, and they are something not any DBZ fan will want to miss.
The Dragonball series just seems to get better and better in all aspects, music, story, dialogue, action, animation, you name it and this DVD is a great showcase of that. We could ask for more episodes but we can get them, just buy the next DVD title Kid Buu- Saiyen Pride. Trust me its worth it. Especially if your a Vegeta Fan",1038182400,11,1443,4.342007434944238

Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,254,4.3125
7962033,4,B000066737,"This is a great saga that completes the story of Goku's adventures in DragonBall Z.  This gets a four star ranking ONLY because the last dvd is kind of pointless and I didn't like it.  However, the final showdown between the original Buu, known as Kid Buu, is as good as you get.  It is an epic climax and thrilling finishing showdown in the stories of DragonBall Z.  You need the battle dvd's for this saga, because I am certain they will glue you to your seat rooting for Goku and Vegeta to save the universe.

  The final saga begins inside scary Buu's mind, where the Z fighters rip, all of those absorbed by buu, from  his body.  When Vegeta rips out fat Buu a transformation begins.  Despite getting smaller in size, Buu is getting far stronger in power, which is shocking to Vegeta and Goku.  The biggest surprise comes from the new Kid Buu, when it immediately destroys the Earth itself.  Goku and Vegeta are only able to escape by a split second, while grabbing, Dende, Hercule, and Bee.  Kibito Kai quickly comes and teleports them back to the planet of the kais, but Kid Buu too has learned to teleport and he comes after them to the planet of the Kais.

  Goku and Vegeta decide to fight Buu individually instead of refusing to defeat it.  This plan backfires when Goku is unable to stay super saiyan three for very long leaving everyone to the mercy of Buu.  The saiyan prince devises one last genious plan to get rid of Buu once and for all, but it will require time.  Vegeta plans to have Goku unleash the Spirit Bomb to finish off Buu.  Stalling Kid Buu does not prove easy as Vegeta is quickly pummled and Hercule is attacked but survives thanks to the expulsion of fat Buu from Kid Buu's body.

  Vegeta and Goku need more energy to finish the Spirit Bomb but selfishness prevents it until the most unexpected entity steps in to save Goku and give him the energy he needs.  Just as before, Buu is one step ahead of the Z Fighters and cannot be stopped; or can it?  Does this saga end with the death of our heroes or with them escaping unharmed?  Like I said, Buu proves to be beyond everything the Z Fighters thought it would be, which keeps you wondering if Buu really will win...... It's time for you to find out!!",1375401600,,2234,4.374695863746958
7962034,5,B000066737,"During the battle, Buu changes once again. This gives Goku and Vegeta the time to escape and rethink their strategy. They run to the world of the Kais. When they arrive, Shin explains the origin and transformation of the monster. Buu has become more powerful and is hunting down the 2 Saiyans. When he finds them, what will happen? Will they fend him off, or will they die?",1355875200,,373,4.5
7962035,5,B000066737,"The Kid Buu Saga is probably my favorite of all the Dragonball Z sagas. Very good battles, superb action.",1244851200,,105,4.578947368421052

7962037,5,B000066737,The original Majin Buu has form known as Kid Buu it maybe smaller but more powerful. It has destroyed planet Earth. Goku and Vegta escape into the other dymention just in time they are on the land of the Kai's Their is where Goku is fighting Kid Buu They used nameks dragon balls to wish planet earth back along with the people. Goku needs their energy to make a full spirit bomb if they can just raise their hands.,1132358400,2,415,4.265822784810126
7962038,5,B000066737,"The Kid Buu Saga wraps up the Dragon Ball Z series, but leaves enough of an opening that will eventually be filled in with GT.

What happens here is that Goku and Vegeta have escaped from Super Buu after releasing Fat Buu from within.  They pull out the Z Warriors trapped within and watch as Buu regreces back into his origional form.  In it's first act Buu blows up planet earth, with Goku and Vegeta bairly escaping taking with them Mr. Satan and Dendee.  They arrive on the Kai Planet, now grief stricken that they were unable to save Gohan and the others.  They lure Kid Buu back to the Kai Planet for the final showdown where the two battle, but not in fusion.  By utilizing the Namekian Dragon Balls, as well as Mr. Satans fame they finally put an end the threat of Majin Buu, but not before one final wish is made.

Overall this wraps up the Dragon Ball Z series as well as the Majin Buu Saga.  The battles are intense and it is truely a close call.  However the series goes out with a bang, and leaves an opening for a future series (GT).",1107561600,16,1047,4.247474747474747
