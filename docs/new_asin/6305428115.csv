1034214,5,6305428115,"How did I manage to overlook this fabulous movie in 1998?
Yesterday, when friends of mine talked about ""electronic surveillance"", they mentioned ""Enemy of the State"" with

 Will Smith as labor attorney Robert Dean,
 Gene Hackman as former spy-in-hiding Edward Lyle, and
 Jon Voight as ""bad guy... better ... bad politician"" Thomas Brian Reynolds, plus
 cameo appearances by Jason Robards (Congressman Phillip Hammersley), and Gabriel Byrne (Brill).
What an awesome movie!!

Most interestingly, though it is almost 20 years old, this movie may be even more relevant today than it was then, 19 years ago.
The basic plot of the movie is
Politician Thomas Reynolds  (Jon Voight) wants to convince Congressman Phillip Hamersley (Jason Robards) to vote for giving the NSA even more rights to watch and record US citizens. Hammersley is a principled, old values, old style, old type, old politician, who isn't buying, ""... I am talking about my constituents being out of work. National security is not the only thing going on in this country...""
When Reynolds  realizes the talks are going nowhere he has Hammersley killed.

These events take place in a park where they are being recorded by a hidden camera set up to record migrating geese. The ""bird watcher"" is a former political activist who realizes that his life is in danger as soon as he watches the video. On the run, he runs into former college buddy Robert Dean (Will Smith) and manages to drop the recording into  Dean's shopping bag, before he gets killed.
As soon as Thomas Reynolds  (Jon Voight)'s team figures out that probably Dean has the tape, Dean (Will Smith) becomes the target of Reynold's hunt. In contrast to his former college buddy, the bird watcher, Dean is completely naive. He does not know what the pursuers want and becomes a stand-in for all naive Americans who say ""this can't be happening to me. ""

[Hint: since Dean never saw the recording he doesn't know that  his son grabbed it out of the shopping bag]

I am not a dedicated Will Smith fan. Still, without hesitation I will declare this one of his finest performances. Dean's mindset is, ""I have not done anything wrong, I am upstanding, law-abiding citizen, so why is this happening to me?""  The actor delivers this concept and state of mind beautifully.

All of us can recognize a brother, a father, an uncle, who argues like Smith's character that ""this can't happening"" and ""everybody is paranoid."" .

Finally, Dean tracks down former spy-in-hiding Edward Lyle (Gene Hackman) whose  gives Robert Dean a crash course in, ""You ARE a target. You have something they want.""
People die, buildings get blown up, lives get unhinged, not even phone calls from pay-phones are safe.
Wake up everybody who has a smart phone - you are being tracked.

As mentioned, this movie is almost twenty years old and it might be outdated, were it not for the fine performances.
Jason Robards' Congressman Phillip Hammersley is like the politician all of us would like to vote for. Which makes his death personal. Jon Voight's  Thomas Reynolds is the politician all of us fear. Gene Hackman is the good spy who got caught in between scenarios, his cat is amazing (love her),  Regina King is (Will Smith's) Robert Dean's clever wife who fears the NSA;  even her dog is clever. Jack Black convinces in a not funny role. Personally,  I always like to see more of Gabriel Byrne; however, in this movie we don't get see him more than few minutes.

Fabulous movie!  If you don't believe that everybody spies on everybody (which I do) it's time to watch this one.

1034440,5,6305428115,"This is an excellent conspiracy movie; all the elements and personalities are included.

Thomas Brian Reynolds (Jon Voight), politically inclined and imbedded in the government, is desperate to have a bill passed to allow better surveillance of the indigenous population. This will further his stunted career.

To speed up the process he finds it necessary to dispatch a congressman impeding its passage. Unfortunately, the deed is inadvertently recorded.

The recording is transferred to a floppy disk.  The disk gets transferred to a lawyer Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) who does not know he has it. The story gets complicated and overlaps with other stories at this point.

Needless to say, everyone is out to get everyone and Tomas has no clue as to what is going on. Standard clich&eacute;s and all the standard faux pass. And no one stays in the car.

Half the fun in the movie is kibitzing with such statements is look behind you and don't go there.",1495238400,,959,4.925465838509317

I got the original (1999?) 132 minute version which is billed as ""wide-screen"" which it is on the old TV. On the flat screen the picture doesn't get to full screen size.

1034923,5,6305428115,"What a prescient movie this was. There is no doubt in my mind that this movie foretold things we could never have dreamed of back in 1998. I remember seeing this movie in theatres when it was originally released and I realized how close we could be at the time. Little did I (Or We) know at the time how we were a the threshold of a ""Big Brother"" society. Snowden's words were prescient and I'm certain that he himself has seen this film. I'm glad now that he alerted us to the intrusiveness of the NSA. As evil an organization this side of the CIA and FBI!

This movie shows how the governments of the world can spy on every day Americans with impunity and get away with it. All it takes is a corrupt man and his cadre to subvert the constitution of the USA. All in the guise of a training exercise they dupe an entire batch of young kids into believing they are just going through the motions. I find it hard to believe that none of them would come to the conclusion that something was wrong or out of place. Also, in Patriot Games this technology is touched on (Satellites & Video Surveillance) but the unrealistic element of this film is that using a satellite to track someone fleeing from operatives would be impractical and quite expensive. I doubt Voight's character would have been able to authorize all of that alone.

The irony of the movie hit me on the other night when I saw that Jon Voight's character (Thomas Brian Reynolds) DOB was September 11! I've not seen the film since it debut in theatres so that fact escaped me at the time. But when I saw it on DVD it blew me away. Will Smith's naivet really irked me. The fact that he would not realize that a phone call from a pay phone could not be traced shocked me. But at least when people see this film today they will realize that all of the technology shown in the film does exist in real life and if anything is far more advanced than what we saw in 1998 just like the technology shown in Enemy of the State is light years ahead of what was shown in the 1974 film: The Conversation.

Will Smith plays an attorney whose life is taken from him by corrupt NSA officers acting outside of the law. He was unwittingly given a tape by a former friend from college who was running for his life. This tape leads to his life being turned upside down and he must search for answers with the help of Gene Hackman's character.

I really liked this movie and I will not go into too much detail as others have done a far better job of that than I have. The DVD is a great production and all of the characters work well together and have chemistry galore; this, coupled with fantastic scenic locations in DC (My Town) bring an enjoyable air to the film (More On That Later). I give this film Five Stars and highly recommend it.

The locations were fantastic. The house Will Smith lives on is not ""2811 Sutton Street"" but in reality is 2811 O Street. I've seen it several times when walking in the neighborhood. The interior of the house may or may not have been used in the film although it does look a bit like what would be the interior when Smith enters to explain his situation to his wife. I brought up images of the street on Google Maps and the house was exactly the same when I typed 2811 O Street NW Washington, DC! This scene is at the 46:34 to 46:44 point in the DVD.

Buy this on DVD and you won't be disappointed. I'm the 513th person to rate this at Five Stars and the 724th to review it in all.

1035680,4,6305428115,"The DVD itself is Widescreen with subtitles, but that is about it.  Certainly, nothing fancy or anything to get excited about.

I'm giving this 4 starts, but this movie might even be worth of between 4 and 4.5 stars.  I don't think it is 5-star, but it is very good.

This is a movie, but like many movies that have come and gone, I think it tells the truth of what can or is going on.  Oh sure, it's just a movie, but many times the truth is given or shared in plain sight in this way because ""it's just a movie"".  Sure, some of the technology might, I say MIGHT, be exaggerated in the movie, but we know now (mid 2016) that some of this technology, if not 100%, absolutely exists and can be done.  So, the things we see being done are possible and done.  Again, many will say ""I have nothing to hide."", but the right to privacy or to live free doesn't mean a man or woman that covets those things are doing anything wrong.  Furthermore, just because you might not have anything to hide or be doing anything unlawful, illegal, or immoral doesn't mean you should be tracked like a dog.

The movie has some good action scenes and even humor, but in my mind the movie is food for thought and should give one pause about our real world, especially when the director of U.S. national intelligence, James Clapper, clearly lied in March 2013 during the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing when asked whether the government collected data on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans.  Clapper said ""no,"" or at least ""not wittingly."" and had a clear tell that showed he was lying.  Furthermore. we now know that he was lying from all of the Edward Snowden documentation that has been leaked and other things that have came out.

Therefore, all of that said, see the movie and keep in mind that the fictional movie is far more real than fantasy and not purely ""entertainment"".",1464307200,,1874,4.46041055718475

The other hero, attorney Robert Dean, is not really a hero, since he gets Brill in trouble; also buying legally-dubious intelligence
product to further his client's cases.

This movie, in my view, has not been watched by the demographic that would most resonate with it: the American middle-class.

If you watched this when it first came out, it might be worth watching again.  I appreciated the movie much more the second time I watched it... just a few weeks ago.  I saw it when it came out and would have given it maybe two stars then.  In light of the exposure of the NSA's information-gathering scandal, this movie is more relevant now than when it came out.

1037285,2,6305428115,"It's a wildly unfocused movie about a guy unwittingly drawn into an espionage case involving the government:  he has something important, he doesn't know it's important, he doesn't know who thinks it is important, and he's bewildered by their attempts to get the item.  The film works very well when it draws us into this world of technological surveillance and espionage.  Some of the action sequences are very intense, and I found the general premise to be very interesting.

However, there are problems.  For one, the CONSTANT comedic relief is both unfunny and distracting.  It feels like the director wants to take a break every 3 or 4 minutes so everyone can have a laugh and not get too worked up.  This is a mistake in my view.  Furthermore, there is a dip in the tension and action of the movie roughly halfway through that is never really recovered from.

Breaking Bad, Rome, the Wire, etc. have now presented to us a new form of enjoyment - slow immersive character development and complex plot have replaced the usual 2 hour dramatic narrative form, at least for this viewer.

This film covers territory frequently traversed by Alfred Hitchcock, namely that of ""the wrong man"" being placed in jeopardy without any plausible explanation. Brilliantly played, Will Smith is that man. This film runs at a breakneck pace as the NSA pursues Smith for something he unwittingly has been handed. Smith eventually becomes teamed with Gene Hackman who plays former NSA operative on the lamb. Hackman's character here seems based on his character from Francis Ford Coppola's THE CONVERSATION. Gene Hackman is very good at what he does and he steals this film in the process. The pace is frenetic with the latest high tech surveillance devises including satellite GPS systems tracking Smith and Hackman's every move. The climax is riveting.

My background is similar to Gene Hackman's character's, so the movie has always struck a chord with me.

The only over the top technology is the floor by floor tracking inside;  otherwise, it is all NOW and even you can buy everything but the satellite.

See it to know what all the NSA spying is all about.  It is all here, including the Hackman character's electric generator to get him off that gird (a throw away moment) and the use of cell phones to track, too.  No need to stop to try not to believe it;  as Hackman says, ""that was 20 years ago.""  His character is dead-on old spies: ""I loved the Agency;  I loved the work.

but Gene Hackman and Jon Voight definitely steal the show in this film
Excellent Directing by the Great Tony scott and excellent written screenplay aswell
i have the Extended unrated version on DVD with extra 10mins of footage
sadly thou this blu-ray only has the Theatrical version
it would've been Great if both versions were on this blu-ray then
you just choose which version you want to watch
i prefer the Unrated version myself the story makes more sense
of course all the extras from the DVD are on this blu-ray anyway
but no unrated cut very unfortunate
unless there will be another blu-ray re-issue of the film which there hasn't been in many years now
then there's no point buying i think it's a waste of money
unless you fine watching the Theatrical version it's up to you then buy it.

1) Power off your cell phone & pull the battery, when not in use (GPS & Cell Tower location tracking).
2) Toss mud over your license plates (ex. Minneapolis cops are using license plate readers on some of their Police Cruisers). We not only know where you are, but also where you go. The REPO MAN in Minneapolis has asked for tracking data on some license plates. Secure your ride before it gets repossessed.
3) Pay with cash. MC & VISA & the rest can have their financial records grabbed by the feds. ... The billing records are theirs, not yours!
4) Consider having a hammer close by your desktop, or laptop. Just in case the guys in the black helicopters arrive, you may be able to smash your hard drives before they break your door down.
5) On second thought, don't bother. Your ISP has already passed on all of your eMails, uploads & downloads to the feds.
6) When pulling money from an ATM, smile into the camera. It'll be proof that you weren't at the frat house during the alleged rape (Duke La Cross rape case). See, some good occasionally comes of the Surveillance Society!

So, not only is Big Brother watching you, your tax dollars are  paying him to do so. ...

I saw it twice back in November 1998 in the theater and later purchased the video and, eventually, DVD. The story is riveting from the first scene with Jason Robards and Jon Voight through to its shoot 'em up conclusion.

1039496,3,6305428115,"""Enemy of the State"" is an entertaining, fast-paced movie with high production values and  a fine cast.  There are times, though, when the story telegraphs its punches.
NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.

In the first scene, during which a senator portrayed by the late Jason Robards gets into a  squabble with a gang of surveillance (NSA) men, we know he isn't going to come out of this scene alive.  As it turns out, the murder of the senator occurring near a lake has been photographed by an ""environmental"" camera.  A young technician later removes the film cartridge and sees what has been photographed.  The gang finds out about it and is after him.  While he is trying to elude them he comes across Will Smith, an attorney whom he previously knew.  He slips the film into Will Smith's shopping bag and takes off.  At that instant I said, ""This guy will be dead within two minutes of screen time.""  Sure, enough.  Later when Smith goes to the apartment of a woman who may have some important information, we see him approaching her apartment door.  At that point  I said, ""We know what he is going to find in there, don't we?""  Sure enough -- another stiff.

We don't see much of Gene Hackman for the first hour and twenty minutes of the movie and as fine as Will Smith's performance is, Hackman's portrayal of a surveillance expert from the old days really brightens up the picture with his great screen presence and good humor.  Smith and Hackman fall in together and, as it turns out out, Hackman is  better at the surveillance game than the NSA guys are. Jon Voight is excellent as the lead NSA heavy.  After several chases and a few explosions, the  film comes to an exciting finish.

This film shares certain similarities  with an earlier picture, ""The Conversation"" (1974), which was directed by Francis Ford Coppola.  He twisted Paramount's arm to release this picture before he directed ""The Godfather Part II.""  Both pictures deal with the subject of surveillance and both starred Gene Hackman and Hackman's surveillance laboratory actually resembles that shown in the earlier film, although with lots more fancy equipment, of course.  The earlier film is arguably Gene Hackman's finest screen role and is a film with considerably greater depth than ""Enemy of the State."".",1371772800,,2290,4.79539641943734

1039693,4,6305428115,"I generally do not write summaries and opinions on the acting and plot, that has been done by a great many others already.  I focus strictly on the quality of the transfer of the Standard Def version to Blu Ray.  I will say that while this is an older film focusing on govt corruption and wiretapping as well as a U.S. citizens right to privacy, the movie stays relevant and has legs. I do have the standard def version but this is not a side by side comparison.

The audio is the star in terms of disc quality.  There is a big difference for any movie between lossless and lossy audio, a transparency that only lossless audio can provide.  On this Blu Ray, it is lossless PCM 5.1.  The audio's levels are nicely set, and if you have a decent surround system, this movie would be considered Demo worthy for showing off your home theater's audio capabilities.  There is much use of all the front and rear surrounds with a goodly amount of panning between the front and rear stages as well as the discreet channeling of foley fx to both the front and rear surrounds.  Your LFE channel does come into play but not overly.  The audio of the standard def version also had excellent surround usage and, thus, I give credit to the original audio editors and mixers.

The video transfer of this softly focused and color muted film presents very good contrast, a touch better than the Standard Def version but I do not believe that it is because of remastering.  The bit rate is certainly higher but not a whole lot; it generally averaged between the mid teens and the mid twenties and that higher bit rate accounts for the somewhat better video.  There was minimal film grain, no artifacting or imaging issues.  Never the less, I do not believe that you will see a night and day difference between the video of the Standard Def and BluRay versions.  If you do not already have the film, certainly go for it on Blu Ray but if  you do have the Standard Def version, don't expect a whole lot of difference.

The extras consisted of some deleted scenes however there was no 'play all' button so each time a deleted scene was done, you had to go back to the menu, bring up the 'extras', go to the 'Deleted Scenes', find the next scene and select.  What a pain in the butt!  No commentary but there was a short 'making of' of the climatic gunfight.

Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

We have viewed this DVD over and over and it still keeps us entertained. We are proud owners of this DVD and are very happy to have this DVD in our collection. This is a great thriller and will keep you guessing.. Many twist and turns.

We don't have cable so, we have a DVD collection with great movies like this and stream crackle and Netflix through our Roku which we love. So this makes for great T.V. time the way we want it.. We don't have to pay an arm and leg for T.V. now because we cut the cord on cable. So when we find great movies like this, we like to watch them over and over and we enjoy them and never get tired of watching this movie. This is a very under rated movie.

So if you are looking for a great movie this is it. This shows you what has been going on for a long time.. look around you today... Get your pop corn, tea, ice water healthy drink ready and sit back and watch this exciting but true thriller.

The characters all do and excellent job.. The plot and scenery are great. As far as the wife's acting, how do you expect a wife to act in circumstances like this.. I think Regina King played her role well! As she said ""Who watches the watchers""?!

You will not be disappointed. By the way, when was the last time you read our Constitution, federalist papers, Declaration of Independence, etc.. Read them again even if you read them in school read them again and think. (Also read a book called 1984 by George Orwell.) This should make you think and give you some insight. Watch this movie and think.. Because this movie will make you think.

This movie is way under rated. Oh, I know I already said that, but it is the truth, this is a great movie that should have hit big..

Enjoy!",1341187200,2,1943,4.165333333333334

That one powerful person could ruin a life so extensively in such a short period of time is a streach.

1040436,4,6305428115,"In today's surveillance society films like `Enemy of the State' can make for thought provoking viewing at times and coupled with a fairly decent storyline this is a good way to spend a couple of hours. This follows a Washington attorney (played by Will Smith) who inadvertently get possession of a video containing a political assassination. A NSA team is set up to discredit him and to track down the tape and pretty soon things take a sinister turn, with bugs, tracking devices, stopped credit cards, smear campaigns and more and pretty soon he is way out of his depth. Fortunately he has a contact who is adept in counter surveillance (who he previously bought information from for his legal cases) who is able to assist him in regaining his life and levelling the playing filed with the NSA spooks who are on his tail. Whilst some of the technology and surveillance ideas in this film seem a little far fetched, I am sure some of these techniques are used and even some more we aren't even aware of. You start to contemplate the level of surveillance and privacy in society as more infringements start to unfold throughout the film, not bad for an action flick. The acting is pretty good from all involved and Gene Hackman is excellent and steals the film from Smith, but to be honest the supporting cast is so good that this has worthy performances from all involved. This moves at a fast pace and is directed well, with a real sense of action and also disquiet at the roving satellites that spin overhead. This is a good action film and raises some interesting issues about privacy in modern society and it is well worth a look at some point.

However, I learned many years ago that, if one is to enjoy that genre, one must accept whatever conspiracy the creators want us to believe in. Whether Martians, former KGB agents, escaped Nazi's, Presidents of the United States or Church leaders, it is all the same to me, so long as they make it dramatically credible. Dramatic sense is not empirical sense.
This suspension of reality which marks my approach, enabled me to find considerable pleasure in this decade old film. With an inventory of terrific technological tools, the bad guys are able to keep tabs on the good guys as well as perform all sorts of evil deeds. Will Smith does a good job as the central good guy as does Jon Voight as the central bad guy.

Recently I was shopping for some DVD's here on Amazon and this movie came up on my recommended list.  So I bought a copy and watched it.  This movie really freaked me out watching it now in a post 9/11 world.  The measures taken by those in power to get what they wanted - ""The Telecommunications, Security, and Privacy Act"" and dead on similarities of the powers enacted by the ""The Patriot Act"" should be a wakeup call for everyone.  To quote the chairman at the beginning of the movie:  ""Invasion of privacy is more like it"", and he goes on to state: ""This bill is not the first step to the surveillance of society, IT IS the surveillance of society""... Of course the government bad guy played by Voight says: ""It's just liberal hysteria""  The chairman had the good sense to say: ""I am not going to sit in congress and pass a bill that allows the government to point a camera and microphone at anything they darn well please!""

All this is in the opening scenes of this movie.  Now I would have given the movie 5 stars, but some of the things are a stretch as far as capabilities and things happening which I won't go into in this review.  In this post 9/11 world I feel this movie is dead on relevant and the abilities and power the government has given itself by playing on our fears is unprecedented. This movie should scare and provoke some thought about what we have and are doing to our society today and just what does freedom really mean.  This was a ho-hum movie that has become a great movie due to the turn of world events and apparent level of manipulation and terrorizing of society that is happening today.

1040710,5,6305428115,"This film took a little time to take off in the beginning, but it was necessary to stage the action that would come later.

The movie opens with a powerful politician, played by John Voight, killing another politician who refuses to support a bill that would allow spying into people's lives to protect the country. That killing is caught on tape and the tape falls into the hands of a researcher who then slips the tape into a shopping bag carried by Will Smith's character.

From there the action takes off at a breathtaking pace. The parts are flawlessly acted - John Voight is the perfect embodiment of the stereotypical evil politician, Will Smith is the helpless victim, and Gene Hackman is the brilliant strategist who pulls the entire film together. I won't say more as I wouldn't want to spoil the suspense.

The thing about this movie is it seems so terrifyingly real. They show throughout the film, the tracking systems used (satellites and high end computer programs).

If you haven't seen Enemy of the State yet, please do. It's a wonderfully done conspiracy/chase thriller with stellar acting from Hackman and Smith, a perfectly tuned score, and morose, paranoid overtones that enhance the work as a whole.

1040811,4,6305428115,"ENEMY OF THE STATE is flashy, big budget, adrenalin-pumping cinema as only director Tony Scott and producer Jerry Bruckheimer can concoct. It's raucously entertaining and most certainly a strident rallying film for the conspiracy theorists. Now I don't know just how accurate the movie is in terms of the technology depicted (I'd say fairly accurate) or of the dubious lengths to which our government will stoop to achieve its ends, but, certainly, the sincere and bravura acting of the high powered cast lends this over the top film an element of plausibility.

Several SPOILERS here: When a nature photographer (Jason Lee) accidentally tapes the cold-blooded murder of a high profile congressman, it sets off a chain of events which horrifyingly affects and endangers Washington, D.C. attorney Robert Dean (Will Smith). When a corrupt, high ranking agent of the National Security Agency comes to believe that Dean has in his possession evidence which will incriminate him, he and his henchmen turn Dean's universe instantly topsy turvy; as a result of their manipulations, Robert Dean is summarily fired from his law firm, framed in the newspaper, accused of having an affair with an ex-flame and current informant, and stripped of his finances. Even his cell phone stops functioning. He is bugged six ways from Sunday and is reduced to running for his life clad in his undies. It's hard work evading these determined people as Dean is easily pinpointed by the NSA's use of aerial surveillance and sundry tracking devices. But Dean receives unexpected aid from an enigmatic ex-intelligence agent (Gene Hackman, again acting with ferocity) as he tries desperately to stay one step ahead of his powerful, omnipresent pursuers and somehow salvage the remnants of his life.

You have to hand it to Scott and Bruckheimer, when they get together (DEJA VU, CRIMSON TIDE, TOP GUN), their enthusiasm knows no bounds. This rapidly paced hi-tech thriller/chase film takes Hitchcock's innocent man on the run premise and inserts its own brand of polished action sequences and well-executed stunts/fx. There's no questioning it's slickness. It's also enhanced by the solid performances of everyman Will Smith, the surly Gene Hackman, and the villainous Jon Voight. Regina King, Jamie Kennedy, Jack Black, and Lisa Bonet (still sexy) all contribute nicely in supporting roles.

ENEMY OF THE STATE is a cautionary fable which raises the issue of national security and of our government's constant need to gather intel for our own protection, but juxtaposed against that is the violation incurred to our civil rights, and, how, depending on the man, certain moral lines are easier to cross in pursuit of the big picture. As someone said, ""Absolute power corrupts absolutely."" This film would have us believe that, with the application of space satellite imagery, super dedicated cameras, various transmitters and taps, our government can now have access to our privacy at a moment's whim. The sobering thing here is that the frighteningly detailed surveillance technology shown in this film - which would make J. Edgar Hoover cream in his dress - is, no doubt, in existence and is probably in steady use - for our own good, of course. Sucks for us and the so-called American way of life. I'm sure, somewhere, George Orwell is saying, ""See - I told you.""",1166918400,2,3339,5.122935779816514

Will Smith is on a roll...has been on a big screen roll ever since Bad Boys (1995). It seems that he always plays the same character: confident, smart talking, tough, funny. But the redundancy works...every time. It worked in Enemy of the State too.

Like a lot of other Will Smith movies (""Independence Day"", ""Men in Black"", ""I, Robot"", ""Hitch""), Enemy of the State is a thoroughly entertaining movie that keeps you in your seat. It's got a great story with some great actors.

And post 9/11, the subject of government surveillance is even more on topic. Can anyone say, ""The Patriot Act""?

1040921,3,6305428115,"MOVIE: Enemy of The State is another one of Jerry Bruckheimer's mid 90's action extravaganzas. He reunites with Tony Scott to bring us this action flick about government coverups and how technology is used to basically track every aspect of your life. The movie is about a lawyer who is unwillingly thrown into a wild cat and mouse chase. A congressman is murdered near a reservoir where research is done on migratory geese. So, unknowingly, the whole thing is caught on tape and ends up in the hands of a nerdy and young Jason Lee. He realizes what he has in his possession and during a foot chase he bumps into his old friend played by Will Smith and secretly drops the tape in his bag. Now Will Smith's character is thrown into a world of espionage without knowing why he is being hunted. He meets up with Brill, played by Gene Hackman, an ex NSA agent who ends up helping him. Hackman basically plays a reincarnation of his character in Coppola's The Conversation. The movie is directed at a fast pace by Tony Scott, and it's an overall entertaining action flick. I felt the movie tried to be smarter than it actually was and that the characters were very plain and boring.

ACTING: I didn't like Hackman in this role, but Will Smith brought some life into the movie. For people who haven't seen the movie in awhile you should check it out to recognize some young faces including Jack Black, Jake Busey, Jaimie Kennedy, Seth Green, and the of course the previously mentioned Jason Lee.

VIDEO: The great thing about the recent releases of Con Air, Crimson Tide, and Enemy Of The State are the new anamorphic transfers of the films. They are greatly appreciated and are so much better than the old ones. The quality of the transfer has not improved greatly in terms of picture quality, but there is a noticeable difference.

AUDIO: As for sound we get a very dull Dolby 5.1 mix. All the dialogue is usually center heavy, and rarely does action actually envelope you from the surround speakers. The track is the same from the old release, so it's not the best. There are some scenes with helicopters and some big explosions that utilize the surround speakers well, but overall it's a very dull mix.

SPECIAL FEATURES: The ""making of"" featurette was actually more extensive than I was expecting. They talk more about the gadgets used in the film versus the actual movie, but overall I found it to be interesting. All the interviews were done back during the making of the movie and it was a pretty extensive behind the scenes for what the movie is. One thing I found extremely interesting was that they talked about a scene where Will Smith is chased by cars in an underground tunnel in his bathrobe. In reality, the cars didn't fit into the tunnel so they had do take the cars apart and weld them back together in the tunnel. The entire scene was maybe a minute long! I just found it interesting that all that work was done for maybe a blip of action. Anyway, the next featurette is basically some on set footage. Overall the two featurettes do justice for what this movie is.

BOTTOM LINE: I got confused whether this was indeed an ""extended"" cut of the film or not. The cover you see on places like Amazon is not the cover that you actually get. The cover of the film is actually labeled ""Special Edition"", but the menu does indeed say ""Unrated Extended Edition"". So, I am thoroughly confused. I didn't notice anything noticeably new, and the running times listed are identical between the old disc and the new one. Still, the upgrade is worth it.",1148256000,78,3551,4.56828885400314

Not to mention countless errors both in editing and directing.  On to the plot, the entire American government is evil (it can happen), mind you are villains are Jon Voight, who I can swallow as a villain, but Jamie Kennedy, Jack Black, Barry Pepper, Jake Busey and Seth Green?!

1040927,4,6305428115,"Despite the fact that we both like Gene Hackman and Will Smith, my wife and I put off seeing this movie for along time, thinking that it was probably going to be just another run-of-the mill Jerry Bruckheimer action flick, all of which get to be a bit overblown and ""samey"" after awhile (IMO Crimson Tide, and the spoof, ConAir, are his best films)...but what would otherwise just have been another pretty good action/suspense film, took on an eerie resonance in the post 9/11 era--the legislation that the Jon Voigt character was willing to kill to get passed had more than a faint aroma of ""The Patriot Act""-- and I'm surprised that more reviewers haven't mentioned that.

As far as the ""lack of substance"" that some reviewers mention, that is entirely subjective, and I do not agree with it. As far as reviewers who talk about this not being as good as 1974's The Conversation, get a clue that elements of this movie are conscious homages to that earlier (and IMO, badly dated, and overrated) movie--one of the things that's fun about Bruckheimer's movies is that they are full of homages to earlier suspense/action flicks, esp. those that influenced him. Also, folks, get a clue to the fact that the Will Smith character's ""dumbness"" and naivety, is part of the point of this movie: his ignorance of technology, and his over-reliance on other people for information, put him at the mercy of the ""heavies"" in this movie, and left him wide open to the crisis in which he found himself embroiled. As an aside, along the lines of the eerie resonance of this movie in the wake of 9/11, it gave my wife and I a bit of a chill down our spines when Gene Hackman's character revealed by ""hacking"" into the NSA computer that the Jon Voigt character's birthday was ""9/11""--an eerie coincidence three years before 9/11/01.",1107648000,59,1814,4.70440251572327

Cast:  Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Regina King, Loren Dean, Jake Busey, Barry Pepper.
Running Time:  127 minutes.
Rated R for violence and language.
Another producer Jerry Bruckheimer/director Tony Scott thrill ride without substance, this time pitting family man lawyer Robert Clayton Dean (played by Will Smith in a ho-hum performance) against a technologically-driven government.  Not knowing that the trivial meeting with an old friend would cause him so much trouble, Dean gets sucked into a conspiracy case involving a rogue National Security Agent (Jon Voight) who killed a United States congressman because he accidentally received a video tape with footage of the murder.  With incredible surveillance techniques and technology, Voight is able to track all of the lawyer's moves and keep tabs on him.
Our hero's life is turned upside down until he meets up with a stealthy former NSA active named Brill (played very well by Gene Hackman).  With the assistance of Brill, Dean attacks the government head on and must learn the truth in order to save his life.  Director Tony Scott brilliantly uses the camera to portray his views, jolting the characters through a series of incredible chase scenes, rip-roaring explosions, and intense firearm combat, but ultimately ""Enemy of the State"" focuses solely on the unbridled advances in special effects abilities that it keeps the audience from understanding the story and getting involved with the characters.  Smith is only adequate in his first major ""dramatic"" role, while Hackman and Voight pick up some of the slack in their devilishly effective parts.

You really get deep into it.
Will Smith is startlingly good in his best performance since Six Degrees Of Seperation - if only he would turn in these great performances in credible, interesting films more often, and is well supported by a strong cast that includes Gene Hackman, Jamie Kennedy and Jack Black amongst others.

1041039,2,6305428115,"This is supposed to be a thriller.  OK, whatever...the viewer obviously knows that Will Smith will emerge from this harrowing adventure more or less intact, so there really isn't any tension created by putting his character in peril.  Therefore, the only tension & suspense the producers of this film can hope to create comes from playing on the audience's sense of paranoia.  ""Oh my god, what if the government really IS watching my every word & deed?""  thinks the audience.  Oh my god, this could actually be happening!  All you have to do is read some of the reviews here and you will see that paranoia is a major factor in this film's appeal.
All I could think of as I watched this film is, give me a break.  One rogue NSA bureaucrat, supported by a handfull of computer geeks, and they are supposed to be able to conduct an operation this vast?  Are you kidding me?  Has anyone ever heard of information overload?  I don't doubt that a good deal of this technology exists, but let's get real folks --- if the NSA was really conducting surveillance on this scale, the amount of raw data the agency would have to sift through simply boggles the mind.  The NSA would have to employ half the population of the USA to spy on the other half.  If the NSA's surveillance is this bush-league, most of us could commit all manner of security breaches and never get caught!  Ironically, I found myself feeling more secure about not being scrutinized by the government after having seen this film.
As to the film itself --- sure, all the chase scenes were gripping, the camera angles were great, blah blah blah.  The production values in this movie are top-notch, but so what?  Bruckheimer & Tony Scott can do movies like this in their sleep, so it's no big deal.  The same can be said for Jon Voight & Gene Hackman, who pretty much phone it in with their roles.  From a production standpoint, this movie is indistinguishable from the hundreds of other so-called thrillers that the Hollywood machine has churned out over the last few years.  Ho hum.

Step by step he starts to understand what happened and to uncover the big scheme...our hero succeeds after going through an ordeal (miraculously saving his life time and again) and returns to normal life. This is more or less the story line of ""Enemy of the state"" and can be also attributed to many other movies. ""The Pelican Brief"", ""Bourne Identity"", ""the Net"" ""No way out"" would be naming just a few.
By scaring you with all the ways the government can monitor the little citizen's behaviour (or supposedly monitor - it is hard to believe they can do all that is portrayed) the movie is also trying to make a statement about privacy. This is spoon fed to your mouth by having the privacy law as one of the political issues of the movie.",1054512000,,1800,4.628125
1041170,5,6305428115,"The film pulls no punches. This has to be close to the finest film Will Smith has ever made, and it's hard to see why it didn't do a lot better at the box office.
If anything, its even more relevant than the day it was released. None of the technology is fictional, (despite some comments) it's all in deployment right now.
Ironically, since the enactment of the Patriot act in the USA, and the second act more recently, this film has assumed a quite weirdly prophetic status. Many comments recently made about the changing character about America (See Tim Robbins recent address to the National Press club) are very to the point here and can't be ignored. It's so easy to see that people like Jerry Falwell are now coming very close to issuing the kind of frightening rhetoric seen in this film - art has met the horizon of reality all too quickly.
Perhaps though, the film's single most biting comment is on the nature of the lobby system and the problem of the separation of judicial and executive powers in the USA, which if anything is far more malefidious and dangerous than what the film depicts.
But, sufficient to say, all this is nothing compared with Hackmans gem of a performance of terse and cranky sainthood. He excels at the hero - putting everything into his character.  This only gives the film more authenticity and a really hard edge.
I just can't fault this movie. The ending is so good, it's impossible really, but there can be no end of sofas being thumped way out there in suburbia and enthusiastic whoops. There's no doubt this film absolutely deserves such.",1051056000,13,1582,4.609929078014185
1041171,4,6305428115,"if you are a fan of the movie 'the conversation' then you will love this for novelty value if nothing else. i haven't seen much with will smith and i was worried this was going to be somekind of men in black thing. it is in fact, very serious though. good acting all around, the list of actors is ridicolous: will smith, gene hackman, john voight, seth green, jack black, jamie kennedy, lisa bonet, scott caan, jason robards, jason lee, theres more. i recoginzed 2 guys from the sopranos (dont know their names), one of which was also in goodfellas.  the story is full of action. its certainly silly at times, the technology used in this wire-tapping drama is just ridicolous but its a lot of fun.
gene hackman im convinced now is the best actor of all time. the conversation is my favorite movie ever and one which i believe is also highly underrated.  the conversation revolved around gene hackmans character who is a professional (also legal and legit) wire tapper.  he plays the same role in this movie, and there are other conversation parallels: at one point a file photo of hackmans character is shown, and immediately i recognized it as a photo from the conversation.  he works in a similar area: an unerground/basement, caged in fortress/shop. if anything this character is harry caul(hackman in the conversation) times 10: he is even more paranoid as shown during smiths first exchange with him, he works through about 10 other people and 10 levels, never getting his hands dirty.  but will smith gets into such a bunch of trouble that you start to wonder how can possibly bail him out....hackman of course.  its also interesting how hackman isn't even introduced until almost half way thru the movie. then only for a few minutes; he disappears again.  then he finally returns to really kick...  i think vin diesel is cool, i love fast and the furious and XXX and to me gene hackman is just as much of an untouchable badass, just in a much different (and probably less hip) way.
tony scott directed this, he is an excellent director known for great films like true romance.  funny, there is a similar situation with a similar outcome (shoot out where everyone dies except the main character, will smith in this case) in this movie.
if you love the conversation as i do, you wish there was more to see. this is as close as your going to get and its quite impressive.  a huge cast of stars, great acting, and fun script and exciting, visual directing.  near perfect.",1047168000,,2474,4.638443935926773

1041173,1,6305428115,"I'll be brief.  Enemy of the State is a good action flick with a lousy transfer to DVD.  If you have a standard television stop reading this review now:  you won't notice what I'm talking about.  If you are running a 16:9 TV then read on.
Like many before, this supposedly ""wide screen"" version is nothing of the sort.  The DVD is encoded in a standard 4:3 image, with black bars matting the top and bottom.  In other words, this is a non-anamorphic transfer.  What that means is that the image you are seeing is lower resolution than a standard NTSC TV signal because of the fewer vertical lines present.  On a 16:9 TV the image looks ""squished"" shorter and ""stretched"" longer.  Most 16:9 TV's have a mode that can re-stretch the image to achieve the proper aspect ratio.  The problem there is now the horizontal lines are clearly visible throughout the film.
I wish studios would stop the absurd practice of releasing ""matted"" widescreen transfers, and only call a DVD ""Widescreen"" if the transfer is anamorphic.  But as long as they're doing it, hopefully enough people will protest to get the studio's attention.",1029283200,41,1116,4.701030927835052
1041174,4,6305428115,"Robert Clayton Dean is a D.C. lawyer who's about to get some kind of twisted Christmas present from an old friend of college: a tape, which reveals a political assassination. Dean doesn't know he has it, but the people ivolved in the murder do know. And they are prepared for anything in order to get back that type, even if that means destroying Dean's life. But Dean isn't willing to let that happen, even if he doesn't know why they want to destroy them.
What we got here is an intelligent film directed by Tony Scott and for my taste, the best of his career. But that's just my opinion. I was a little skeptical at first, because I didn't think Will Smith could deliver a dramatic performance, but he surprised me, and I am sure I wasn't the only one. Of course, Gene Hackman, Jason Lee, Jon Voight, Barry Pepper, Jack Black, Seth Green, Jamie Kennedy, Scott Caan, Tom Sizemore and Gabriel Byrne have their good things, too. It's an awesome cast in my opinion and they all do their job better than one would expect. I can only complaint about the little screen time Gabriel Byrne has, but it's really ok. And Tom Sizemore, wow, he's great in this one as an italian mobster and who, in my opinion, has the greatest line in the film.
Note that I only give this film 4 stars, but that's because of the DVD edition. It is so lame when it could have been so great. The film gets 5 stars, not the DVD.
Maybe the technology shown in the movie is a little overwhelming and for those who are not into the state of the art electronic devices, this film may seem too far-fetched. The music is superb and the main theme is really a beautiful music piece that really grabs the essence of this movie, which is, in my opinion, the end of privacy. How your actions, even in the privacy of your bedroom, your computer, phone calls, e-mail... everything, can be tapped just to ensure national security. Of course, it's a step beyond, but definately, very plausible.
What's more important to you? Privacy or safety? And if it is indeed safety, how do we know that the people monitoring us aren't using that power for selfish purposes, like depicted in this film. Are we willing to give up our privacy just to feel safe? And how safe would you feel knowing that someone is watching you or listening to everyword that comes out of your mouth? ""Only privacy that's left is inside your head and maybe that's enough"" one of the characters says. And after September 11, after many of us lost that sense of security, I am quite sure that this would be an interesting debate. To paraphrase another of the characters, ""when buildings start blowing up, people priorities tend to change"". He's got a point there. But who's there to tell which person is trustworthy enough for me to trust him my privacy, my life?
As Larry King says in the last line of the film: ""how do we draw the line between protection of National Security, obviously the government's need to obtain intelligence data, and the protection of civil liberties, particularly the sanctity of my home? You've got no right to come into my home"".",1028073600,2,3082,4.505357142857143
1041175,4,6305428115,"Will Smith is Robert Clayton Dean, a young yet prominent labor attorney in the DC area who suddenly finds his well ordered life going to hell.  Unknown to him, he's accidentally received a video disc implicating the Deputy Director of Operations of the NSA (Jon Voight) in the suspicious death of an influential senator - a disc passed to him moments before its owner's untimely death.  Unable to locate the disc, the wicked Dep decides to take Dean's life to pieces - finding much in Smith's character that isn't as ordered as it appears.  In fact, Dean's adventures as a labor lawyer frequently have him run up against organized crime bosses, including one played by Tom Sizemore.  Worse, to get his information, Smith relies on a shadowy figure named Brill, a man he's never met.  Instead, he maintains contact with Brill through a former lover (Lisa Bonet).  Drawing a line between Smith and Bonet using their ban accounts, the NSA wreck his personal life and implicate him in embezzlement.  On the run from the super-secret NSA with its satellites and its surveillance gear, with nowhere to turn, Dean's only hope is to find the mysterious Brill himself, learn the secret driving his pursuers and hope to fund some way to put his life back together.
Not a lot in ""Enemy"" makes sense, but it's fast and, with Will Smith, often funny.  He's got a flip sense of humor that saves the movie that otherwise has few surprises.  Gene Hackman enters the scene as the shadowy Brill running, and he never stops.  Brill is essentially paranoia incarnate - though by the time we've met him, we know enough about the Government's surveillance methods to empathize with his fears.  Jon Voight plays the latest in a long line of heavies (he was the evil lawyer in ""Rainmaker"") but otherwise never connects as a villain.  But the real star of the flick is the direction, which is fast and coherent at the same time.  Otherwise, the flick pays lip service to Hollywood's need for an apparent message (beware nig government's intrusion on your privacy) without making the movie deep enough for you to care.

1041178,4,6305428115,"Enemy of the State may be the best thriller about an innocent man on the run since the movie version of Mission: Impossible. Admittedly, such movies are largely the same story told over and over again with differing interpretations, but director Tony Scott's retelling is one of the most innovative.
These movies almost always revolve around a man caught in the grips of some paranoid government agency. This time, it's the audience that needs to be paranoid, because if such a situation ever happens in real life, we are all up the creek. What makes this one so creepy is the fact that some of the technology depicted actually exists.
The affable Will Smith plays a Washington, DC attorney named Robert Dean. The character is somewhat prone to getting himself into hot water, and when he bumps into an old school chum, he gets some information a federal agency will literally kill to get back. To compound the problem, Dean doesn't even know he possesses such dangerous information. Even when it becomes apparent that some group is after him, as well as his family and friends, he is at first clueless as to what they want and then totally unaware of where what they want is. He's got a definite problem.
The people out to get him work for the Federal Information Agency, which has managed to link together all of our telecommunications technology. They can tap any type of digital telephone and pager at will. They can instantly pull up records on any citizen. They have installed video cameras everywhere and can tap into most private security cameras. If necessary, they can follow people almost anywhere by calling up any of hundred of satellites spinning around Earth. The agency is truly a nightmare come true.
What Dean doesn't know he has is a videotape of a murder. The agency has dispatched an uncooperative Congressman and made it look like an accident. The scene was unwittingly recorded by Dean's old friend, who, realizing what he has and being chased by the bad guys, slips it to Dean moments before his own death.
All of this is done at break neck speed. The movie starts with a bang, and they keep coming until it's over. There is some very fancy camera work and lots of well done special effects. The music is innovative, with a full orchestra playing melodically against an intense electronic theme.
Will Smith seems to be able to do anything. He has been a TV star. He remains a very successful singer. He's starred in two huge hits, Men in Black and Independence Day. This summer he plays in Wild, Wild West. In Enemy of the State, however, the limits of his acting range are more apparent. It's not because this is any more serious than his other films, but because he is playing against two acting giants, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight. Voight is truly menacing as Thomas Reynolds, the man in the agency behind the murder. Hackman is superb as Edward Lyle, the technological master who is Dean's one chance of survival. Not only have these two been making movies since before Smith was born, they both received Academy award nominations when they were about his age. I do like Smith a great deal, and it is possible that he will turn out to be a late bloomer, much like Clint Eastwood and Harrison Ford, who both seemed one- dimensional until they were nearly forty.",1016841600,7,3288,4.680483592400691

1041281,3,6305428115,"'Enemy Of The State' is a mostly enjoyable exercise in 'North By Northwest' Lite.  Will Smith is the professional who becomes an innocent on the run from both the bad guys and the Law.  The novelty in this case is that both are the same - and when the axis of evil has the resources of the State behind it, the odds are fairly stacked against its enemies.  Of course, like Cary Grant in Hitchcock's film, Smith isn't really innocent - though essentially decent and a loving father, he is complacent, arrogant, politically apathetic, and has cheated on his wife.  He has an Oedipal problem to work through, having to put a bossy wife-mother in her place and supercede a father figure (Brill).  The subsequent peril he undergoes is a purgatorial chastening, a test he must take to prove himself an adequate, trustworthy family man again.  Anything that gets in the way - be it the Mob who threaten his client, or the woman he had the affair with - must be removed.  It is good to remember this dubiously punitive aspect of the film whenever anyone talks about its liberal paranoia.
I nearly fell off my chair laughing when I read that certain critics who should know better took the film's 'politics' of paranoia seriously: some even suggesting a family resemblance to Coppola's 'The Conversation' (Gene Hackman plays a similar character in both films), one of the most difficult films in American cinema.  'Enemy' is not difficult or ambiguious or doubting - it knows exactly what it stands for.  Unlike Hitchcock, who used his camera to implicate the viewer in his matrices of voyeurism, Scott's camera stands outside the various weapons of surveillance of the film, uncovering, rather than spying; clarifying, rather than obscuring.  Unlike Coppola's film, we know from the start who the enemy is and what his weapons are - it's merely a matter of being vigilant and getting rid of him.  Yeah right.
Tony Scott is no more interested in political paranoia than he was in flag-waving or militarism in 'Top Gun'.  Both narratives give him a structure within which he can practise his vision of Total Cinema.  So the best bits of 'Enemy' are the chases - the splattersome pursuit of Jason Lee; the whole hotel sequence with Hackman, as Smith is sought by increasingly hysterical Feds; and the tunnel run - even if these are more Keystone than Keaton.  It is less interesting when people make speeches about privacy, the 'surveillance society' and the connections between the telecommunications industry (whoops!) and the military-industrial-complex (or whatever it is).  If I want to know about politics or threats to my civil liberties or Establishment fascism in the US, I'll go to a newspaper, NOT Hollywood.  Still, in the 'light' of 'recent events', 'Enemy' has a lot more bite than it used to, with references to both US-backed Afghans and pretzels.",1013385600,2,2852,4.8615702479338845
1041282,4,6305428115,"Enemy of the State is a prescient look at the critical balance between national security and personal freedom.  Released in 1998, the plot could be taken from today's headlines.  In response to terrorist actions and threats, legislation is introduced allowing government extremely wide latitude in surveillance and curtailing personal privacy.  Key members of the government itself, however, are sociopaths--totally amoral in the pursuit of their own ambitions.  Sound familiar?  It's a tale we've heard all too often.  Director Tony Scott plays to the audience's distrust of authority rather than their fear of terrorism--perhaps if the movie were made today it would have a different slant.  But government has seemingly gotten no purer, and officials are keen to grab exactly those rights that this movie is concerned with.
As for the rest, Will Smith and Gene Hackman turn in terrific performances.  The action is continuously thrilling, although excessive in the number and length of chase scenes.  Although occasionally we have to suspend our disbelief, the climax of the movie provides a payoff so clever that we are happy to do so. The music, by former Yes guitarist Tevor Rabin and a collaborator, suits the action well but doesn't particularly stand out significantly.

The scenes on how evil the National Security Agency can be and how they track down Will Smith's character. They appear to be their own Crime Family as they end up killing each other in the end.
I saw this movie when it first came out in theatres and it completely blew my mind. The thought that the Government or the NSA, could not only be the NSA but its officers had the chance to take on not only their own idenity but the face of anything they wanted - in fact when the two NSA officers first came to Smith's house, they introduced themselves as the DC Police and even produced badges.
Even the way they tried to scare the Senator and ended up killing him when he told the Deputy NSA Communications Director, Jon Voight, that he wasn't going to vote his way.
And the DC Mafia makes a scary adding to the movie, as the NSA uses Smith's character as a lawyer for serious goofed up Mobsters (as in the first scene when the mobster and Smith are talking) and Hackman's character is giving Smith the tapes of Sizemore and his friends at a party, and Smith threatned to use it against him.
The FBI are in the movie for laughs though as saying ""Geez, he doesn't look Italian"" as Smith made his way out of the Sizemore's restaurant and the old man gave the agents' the finger and they took a picture of the shocked Smith.

Enemy of the State, by David Marconi.  Buena Vista Pictures,1998.
Reviewed by SSgt Creston Patrick Bailey
 In the age of post Cold War hoopla, the call to down size not only the military, but our nations Intelligence capabilities, occurs at our own risk.  While the Soviet Union is no longer a ""Super Power"", there are still enemies that would seek to destroy the United States of America.  It is in time such at this that David Marconi sets his film Enemy of the State.  In this fictional work, Marconi portrays the constant battle between the needs of national security and the civil liberties of United States citizens.  This battle is depicted by the need for the National Security Agency's need to collect Signals and Communications Intelligence (Sigint and Comint) at the expense of privacy of United States personnel.  The plot of the film is an attempt by power hungry individuals in the government to pass a bill that would allow for monitoring of telecommunications traffic of United States citizens.  A politician, who is killed by those who support it, opposes the bill.  The course of the film brings in an unsuspecting citizen who unknowingly acquires evidence of the murder.  Robert Dean, portrayed by Will Smith, has his life turned upside down by the National Security Agency in an attempt to retrieve the evidence he unwittingly possess.  Ultimately Dean is able to outwit the National Security Agency and escape their massive technological means and foil their plans to subvert the privacy of United States Citizens.  While the plot makes for a mediocre film, at best, it is the authors, and producer's ability to pray on the viewer's fear of `big brother' that keeps the movie interesting.  According to director Tony Scott the United States Intelligence Community possesses technology that can reach in and dominate the lives of the American public.  Images of real-time sub-one meter resolution streaming imagery from orbiting satellites, and computer nerds tasking satellites on a moments notice are served up to scare an unwitting audience.  The use of formerly secret code words offers credibility to the film in the eyes of an uneducated public.  While all of these images and ideas may sell a movie, and make it appear that the United States Intelligence Community is somehow omniscient, it is pure fantasy.  Not only does the author portray the abilities of the United States Intelligence Community falsely, he also fails to mention the illegality of the actions used by the National Security Agency in the film.  The most obvious of these oversights is United States Signals Intelligence Directive 18, that makes virtually every action in the film illegal.  However, if the goal of the writer is to scare public, he succeeds.  While the film does succeed in entertaining the public with high tech gadgets and suspenseful moments, it does so at the expense of the United States Intelligence Community.  The films primary motive appears not to entertain, but to propose an agenda.  That agenda seems not to be educating the public on what the United States Intelligence Community does to protect the nation, but that `Big brother' is watching, and that the United States Intelligence Community is here to destroy your freedoms, not to ensure them.",991008000,4,3316,5.044036697247706

Case in point:Independence Day and Men in Black. Both good movies, but not much of a stretch for Smith. Here, he is quite darned good as a DC labor laywer set up by an agency of the government, headed by Jon Voight. It turns out Smith is carrying a piece of evidence that will expose Voight as the murderer of a famous congressman.
Will Smith's life is thrown in disarray; his wife thinks he is cheating on her with his ex-girlfriend, he's been fired, and now his only hope is a recluse played by Gene Hackman. Together only can they clear Smith's name and bring down Voight's character. The action scenes are quite good, and the sound from this DVD will blow your socks off during the explosions. The best part though is about basic privacy. There are satellites looking down on us all the time, how the government can hack our computers and listen in our phone calls in the name of national security. Some very serious questions are raised in this enjoyable action thriller.",983318400,,1132,4.5

While innocently purchasing a Christmas gift for his wife, he unknowingly recieves a film capturing the images of the assination of a senior U.S. senator by high-ranking officers of the National Security Agency... and they want it back!
Government goons, under the direction of a top Agency official (Jon Voight) destroy his life using tracking devices, video cameras, the press, and even satelites to get what they want.  Former NSA operative Brill (Gene Hackman) reluctantly attempts to help, without getting killed himself.  Throw in quite a few action scenes, great graphic effects, and a suprise ending to boot, and you have an instant hit!
Will Smith usually brings his own brand of silly humor to his characters, but this is not the case in Enemy of the State.  His role as a quick thinking attorney is well-played and believable... as the movie progresses, his character begins to take on some of the traits of James Bond (with some assistance from Gene Hackman).

Will Smith is a lawyer who gets involved in something by accident.  His friend from school drops something into his bag without telling Smith that it is an important government tape that could get him killed.  The friend meets his demise and Smith is stuck with the tape.  The plot ensues that the government is out to get the tape back and Smith doesn't know.

1041523,4,6305428115,"Its great to see Hackman reprise his operative character from ""The conversation"".
The point of this film as to how far along we are towards ""1984"" and ""Big Brother"" is perhaps indicated by our lack of alarm about it. Its interesting what the situational awareness the Feds can gain by having an emittor on the Will Smith character, its instructive conceptually as to how you could steer yourself and other units to intercept or stay close without getting too close. But this technology is shown to collapse when the sensors are not ""cheating"" by the emittor and have to use line-of-sight collection means to stay in contact with their prey in a cluttered urban environment. If you watch the film conceptually as a demonstration of military and possibly totalitarean technology its worth 4 stars. If you watch it for entertainment and plausibility it lacks realism since if the corrupt Feds wanted the Will Smith character's tape they would have barged in, killed him and made it look like something else. Of course there would be no film and chase then.
We should reject violently these ""reality"" TV shows where such totalitarean surveillance means are taken in jest like its a mere popularity contest: if you become an ""enemy of the state"" your getting voted to be ""banished"" might not be a laughing matter.",970444800,,1308,4.869955156950673

Nobody will feel safe, not even in the comfort of  their own home, after watching this film. The chemistry between Gene  Hackman and Will Smith works out really well. Smith most of all, surprised  me in a very pleasant way because I never had seen him act before (Yes, I  haven't seen MIB yet, shame on me) and he really lives his role.

Maybe it was because I thought it was a team of Will Smith and Gene Hackman and I couldn't imagine the  chemistry for the two as actors but I didn't watch it.
After watching it,  here are a few words and sentences that describes my feelings of this  movie:
Simply Awesome!
As you can see, I really enjoyed this movie.  It's very good!  From start to beginning, your attention will be focused on  this movie!  Tech people and those who wonder about privacy issues will  definitely love this movie.  It's all good!&#63728; Will Smith was  truly wonderful in this film.  The ending was very well done.  Gene Hackman  did a wonderful job as well.  The chemistry as actors between the two  worked well.  It was also nice to see Lisa Bonet in this film.  I haven't  seen her since The Cosby Show and shows during that time.  John Voight  plays a very well done evil political figure.
The video of this film is  very good.  The audio is very good as well!  It's one of the things that  kept my attention was the sounds and to hear my subwoofer go boom quite  frequently!
As for the extra's, you get a few of them.  It was pretty  cool to see the featurettes, the trailer and trailers for other movie.  The  only thing is the featurettes are too short and for a movie this  big...there had to be deleted scenes right?  Anyway, I wish they included  the deleted scenes and much more to the extra's but nevertheless, they did  include really cool featurettes.
Again, this movie is brilliant!  So, you  read the reviews...Buy it!  Highly recommended!",959385600,2,1650,4.434343434343434
1041639,4,6305428115,"If you are interested in Conspiracy Theory styled movie this is a very  good choice. In an interesting twist Hollywood actually makes the Senator  with a conscious a Republican. Can the apocalypse be far behind?
Still  this is probabbly Wil Smith's best acting to date, if for no other reason  than he doesn't get to rely on his smart mouth. It was refreshing to see  that Wil Smith can effectively play with aplomb a character who isn't  constantly mouthing off to everyone and showing his wit.
Gene Hackman  does an admirable job.
All told a very good movie.
The DVD is pretty  basic, but all right all in all.",959299200,,612,4.5504587155963305

I won't get into it too deep as to not give away the plot, but  the storyline is tight. After watching this movie I wonder if the things  they showed really can be done....well not ""IF They Can? "" ..but  ""Are they Done"". It starts of kinda slow but once the action  starts thats it. Gene also was good in this and gave this movie the serious  side to it, while will made the comedy. Regina King played a small role as  the wife. This movie shows u how far technology has come and how easy it is  to find out someones background. Overall I would not sleep on this movie.

For Gene Hackman  fans, he also plays a good really good part as a secret agent in hiding  that helps Will Smith get rid of his ""stalkers"". For Seth Green  fans, he plays as one of Will's ""stalkers"". He and his partners  track him down where ever he is with satelight views, trackers, and lots of  other high tech stuff. I guess to sum it all up, this is a pretty good  movie. I would recommend it every person that like high action movies.",955324800,,721,4.257352941176471
1041644,5,6305428115,"as one of our honorable reviewers has mentioned, there are some technical discrepencies involved in this movie.  like the '3d rotational' computer engine.  and the lack of forensic evidence on the senator's body.  and the  magical ability of gene hackman's character to do just about anything he  wants to electronics in the back seat of his el-camino.  but i don't mind;  if life has taught me anything, it's that screenwriters don't often have  the firmest grasp on science.
then again, oftentimes movies written with  gaps in scientific understanding are the most enjoyable.  if you get caught  up in the diodes and antennas of the props, you miss the premise, which is,  'what if the gob'ment really WAS plotting against us?' - and on that  premise, this movie does well.
factual discrepencies aside, this was a  good screenplay.  it was gripping and engaging; we are presented with a  real-life situation that follows it's cinimagraphic tangent to fruition.  the actors give fantastic performances - especially the leads.  it is shot  in a manner that adds to the paranoid atmosphere of the film; presumably  it's what Tony Scott and Jerry Bruckhimer had in mind.
all those things  sum to make a good movie.  being an EECS geek from Gen-X, i particularly  like the interaction between the younger characters in the film.  Will  Smith, as i say, has his first gig not playing himself, and he comes off  well.
anyway, i enjoyed this film enough to buy it (my disc does not have  any defects, although my friend's first one did) and i think you will, too.",954201600,4,1557,4.821292775665399

Not to  mention the fact that there is no way that there are cameras everywhere!  By the way, satellites are retasked in a matter of HOURS, not seconds.

1041828,5,6305428115,"This movie is a great buy for both Will Smith fans, and conspiracy theorists.  This is an action movie that keeps moving, keeps you interested, and brings up some important social issues.",942105600,3,187,4.84375
1041829,5,6305428115,"IT IS VERY RARE THAT YOU FIND A CAST LIKE WILL SMITH, REGINA KING AND GENE HACKMAN.  THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE, WILL, REGINA, AND LISA BONNET MADE THE MOVIE REALISTIC. THEIR ROLE IN SUCH A ACTION PACKED MOVIE MADE IT MOST  REALISTIC.  WILL'S PERFECT WORLD WENT UP IN SMOKE JUST LIKE THAT BUT HE  SHOWD US THAT WITH DETERMINATION AND THE RIGHT CONTACTS HE COULD PROVE  HIMSELF.  TOO BAD LISA HAD TO DIE, SHE PLAYED A GOOD ROLE.",940636800,,423,4.291139240506329
1041830,4,6305428115,"The critics weren't fair to this one.  It is one of the best looking, best acted, most well written action/suspense films I've ever seen.  Yes, it has the obvious car crashes, high speed and on foot chases, shootouts, and  explosions, but this movie uses basic intelligence as its main driving  force. The other action movie cliches that I just mentioned are used very  wisely and sometimes very funny.  This is one of the most well thought out  action movies I've ever seen, and I highly recomend it.",938736000,,501,4.689655172413793
1041907,3,6305428115,"I found the action dissapointing and the way they presented the technology used just wasn't convincing. That is poor for a film so hyped up on technology. Hackman did a good performance, within the limits he had. Smith  floated on his name.  Have to mention that the first copy I got from  Amacon.com didn't work and when I told them they sent me a new copy the  same day with express mail! No extra cost. Two thumbs up for Amazon.com!",935020800,,435,4.4
1041908,2,6305428115,"Again, Jerry Bruckenheimer makes the believable unbelievably over-dramatized, i.e. Con Air, Armageddon, etc.  Why is this guy still making movies?  Too many people with little intelligence think that his  movies are good.  Why?",934416000,,227,5.787878787878788

1041910,5,6305428115,I saw this Movie in the Theater - twice - and was extremely impressed.  I would like to know how this movie transferred to DVD?  In particular Sound and Video quality.  I was under the impression this was the place to review  the quality of the DVD - since this is the place to buy it.  Thanks,932601600,,293,4.0701754385964914
1041911,4,6305428115,"Enemy of the State was an awesome movie.  Will Smith and Gene Hackman were excellent together. What I really liked about the movie was that most of the minor characters have been in other popular movies recently.  I seemed  to recognize almost everybody.  Especially Jamie Kennedy from Scream, and  Seth Green (who was not even in the credits) who has done many movies  recently like Austin Powers 1&2 and Can't Hardly Wait.  It was also  good to see that Gene Hackman was not the only veteran actor in this movie.  Jon Voight played his usual villain role and did an amazing job, as usual.  Overall, Enemy of the State keeps you interested from start to finish.  A  must see for action/suspense movie fans.",931651200,,707,4.658536585365853

1042053,4,6305428115,"Will Smith does it again! After watching this movie I wanted to shut the blinds, turn off the computer, unplug my phone and live like a hermit!

I recommend anyone who wants to see an exceptional movie with  a lot of action to buy Enemy of the State.",929577600,,261,4.019230769230769
1042055,1,6305428115,A Very long and boring movie to say the least. It is way too confusing and has enough story for 3 movies.  It gets too frantic sometimes and the end was all mess and kept me way too confused.  Not enough explaining.  Good  acting though (which is what saves it) but there is way to much empty space  in between.,929491200,2,311,4.116666666666666
1042056,5,6305428115,I don't care what those other people are saying about Will Smith playing the same exact part and having no range of acting talents.  This movie was outstanding.  I have already bought it and have watched it about five times  and have yet to get bored with it.  All other supporting characters give  terrific performances.  I was thrilled with this movie from beginning to  end and I believe that anyone who loves a great action film that keeps you  on the edge of your seat needs to at least rent the movie.,929232000,,507,4.434782608695652

7889803,5,6305428115,My favorite Will Smith movie.  A senator is murdered in a park and it is listed as accidental but a wild life camera across the river captures the murder. Unknown to Smith the chip with the murder on it is put in his shopping bag.  He is chased by the government trying to get/destroy the chip.  The movie has great special effects and it is really scary to think the government might have the capability to do a lot of the things portrayed in the movie.  The movie is suspenseful and has another of my favorite actors in it -- Gene Hackman.  There is not a dull moment in this movie.,1525910400,,584,4.225225225225225
