8239626,5,B0010Z9WG2,"The Dialogue Collection examines not only the seemingly staid and, at times, droll mechanics of screenwriting, but also the subtle nuance that is critical to film success--commercially and philosophically.  The necessary sojourn each writer makes both from within and without defines the boundaries of the screenplay, and ultimately the story.  The templates that each writer has studied and ""metabolized"" are discussed and explored in detail, whether Ordinary People or Fight Club.  Overall, The Dialogue collection lends credence that all film begins with logos, the word.",1302393600,,574,5.729411764705882
