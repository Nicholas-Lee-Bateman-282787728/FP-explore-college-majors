8135637,4,B000H0MN80,"Quaint little thriller about the perils of cloning.  Back in the 1990s when this was filmed, it was a simpler time with simpler problems it seems.  Anyway, the main reason I got it was for Elizabeth Perkins and she doesn't disappoint.  Nice on-location filming in the pac-NW area adds to the charm.  Since it was made for TV, it clocks in a little under 90 mins which makes for a taut little thriller.  Bonus - check out their idea of how the internet -- specifically queries for info from the web -- will work in the near future.  Good fun!",1474848000,,541,4.36

8135641,3,B000H0MN80,"This made for tv-type movie works surprisingly well. The actors all know their lines. Some of the action is a little stilted but mostly the dialogue is good. The lead characters are sincere and believable. The initial premise is not what one expects as the story unfolds and there is a neat twist at the end. The subject matter is very relevant to our early 21st century thoughts on cloning and includes many moral issues, including that of ruthless corporations hungry for profit. Only downside is the organs in lab tanks that are rather too obviously fake. I'd watch it again.",1257292800,3,578,4.732673267326732
