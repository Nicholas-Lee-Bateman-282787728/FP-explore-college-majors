2241684,2,B0007TKGLM,"Okay, the serial itself is a hoot.  A fairly early entry with a feel that talkies have finally arrived -- although it was made in the mid-30s.  But what can we do about Alpha?  Sure, they make offerings such as these available, when no one else will, but absolutely no effort is made with respect to quality.  A grainy, noisy copy of the series was used, and what's with the cropping?  You know something's up when the title disappears from the top of the screen.  Our hero, and dastardly villains, often have their heads lopped off.  I'm not asking for letterbox quality -- not even pan and scan -- but can't you at least get the top and bottom of the frame on the screen?  Oh well.  If you can pick up a copy for about $5, it's worth it.  But remember, you've been warned.",1122854400,51,774,4.275862068965517
2241685,2,B0007TKGLM,"The last of a race of super geniuses (William Boyd) lives in a hidden city in the jungles of Africa.  He decides that he wants to rule the world and sends out a ray that causes flooding, tidal waves and other ecological disasters.  A strapping young scientist (Kane Richmond) figures out where the signal is coming from and leads an expedition to Africa to put a stop to it.  They come across ""giants"" (African natives who are enlarged by the evil ruler's machines, becoming mindless zombies), ""spider men"" (African natives who are turned into white men by a serum that Kane Richmond's character calls one of the greatest inventions ever) and treachery both from within their group and from others they meet.  Naturally, there is a kindly scientist, and naturally he has a beautiful daughter who longs to run off into the sunset with Kane Richmond's character.  The evil ruler has a bodybuilder henchman who spends much of the story running around in the jungle, periodically stopping to use his belt radio (he kneels down and pushes a grounding rod into the earth, then pulls a microphone off the radio box and says ""Appollon listening!"").  All in all, an unusual mix of science fiction and jungle action, with numerous racist comments that would definitely arouse angry comments today.  The acting was almost always over the top, even for a movie serial.  I bought it because I'm a Kane Richmond fan, and I watched it all the way through more out of fascination that they were able to get away with this stuff than anything else.  Definitely different.",1117756800,9,1554,4.790262172284645
8051432,1,B0007TKGLM,"Although I am a fan of 1930's film, this would not be a reason to make that statement. It will be up for sale.",1468972800,,110,3.625
8051433,5,B0007TKGLM,I love to watch the old serials although the were made before i was born.  its fun to watch the fight scenes and seeing the wooden sets smashed to little pieces,1458259200,,160,4.161290322580645
8051434,4,B0007TKGLM,Back in the day a serial accompanied every movie at the theater. They usually lasted 12 or 15 weeks. This was an enjoyable one.,1391558400,,127,4.333333333333333
8051435,5,B0007TKGLM,"Not only do I like rewatching this,Kids love this and the other old serials I have. Instead of hanging out with computers,I actually saw some out running around using there minds,creating their own eps.of some of these.",1389830400,,219,4.945945945945946
8051436,4,B0007TKGLM,"One of those ""so bad it's good"" films. An atrociously made and politically incorrect serial that nevertheless will hold your attention. Black natives are turned white, then whoop around with glee. Other short natives are stretched into 7-foot giants, then given lobotomies so they simply grunt, stagger around and obey commands. An assistant to the bad guy prances around in a spangly, tight-fitting costume, while another, a hunchback, speaks like a Shakesperian actor. A native queen speaks like Lupe Velez and is generally disagreeable. The heroine screams about every minute or so. I bought the cheap Alpha copy before I knew a better one exsisted. I saw that one streaming and it might be marginally better, but not enough to pay more money for. In any case, this serial is worth buying for the fun factor, just don't spend too much on it.",1379289600,,844,4.909090909090909
8051437,4,B0007TKGLM,"i love old ""b"" movies and serials.  this serial seems like it looks into the future with all the gadgets the villians possess.  the acting is bad but lots of the effects are great. television, wireless walkie talkies, and a stun gun. thats pretty impressive for a 1935 picture.",1190592000,,277,4.63265306122449
8051438,1,B0007TKGLM,"This very inexpensive release was made from an extremely chopped-up print, making it nearly unwatchable. The serial itself is a hoot - and is much better served by another release, priced higher and worth the difference.",1171843200,13,220,5.138888888888889
8051439,3,B0007TKGLM,"This wacky, seemingly endless movie (the entire original is 3+ hours long) is a series of chases through tunnels and jungles, w/ dozens of fights tossed in! We've got the sinister Zolok, who is creating an army of giant zombies in his mountain lair! How? By using his brain-destroying machine and his enlarger of course! There's Bruce Gordon, electrical engineer and adventurer, out to stop Zolok's evil plot! We also get Queen Rhama (who is actually pretty hot), seductress and slave-trader, who wants an army of giants of her own! Then there's Butterfield, who is seeking his own fortune, at everyone elses expense! There's even an arabian sultan and his army! Not to mention the tribe of white african natives, turned white by Dr. Manuse, a scientist w/ a freeze-gun and a beautiful daughter! Whew! I didn't even mention the muscle-man or the hunchback! LC is a lot of fun in places, but tends to drag on... and on! Queen Rhama really is a hottie though!...",1157673600,,960,4.789156626506024
8051440,4,B0007TKGLM,"The serial is as I remembered it. It was well done for a B-serial. William ""Stage"" Boyd played the crazied ruler of the Lost City to perfection. The print used to make the DVD was indeed a good copy and the sound is good. This actor is not to be confused with William Hopalong Cassidy Boyd.
