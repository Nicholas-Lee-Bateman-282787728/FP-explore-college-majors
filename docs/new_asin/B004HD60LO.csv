8429467,5,B004HD60LO,"I have been a carpenter for two and half decades,only two of those years did I work on commercial townhouse framing jobs.
I was completely astounded that there was a method to cut birdsmouth cuts easily and accurately with a slightly modified existing power saw.
I'm not alone in cutting each and every common rafter one at a time as I was taught that way by some outstanding framing Carpenters I worked under and with. This guys mathematical equations are easy to comprehend,and easily can be transferred to the job site.
I can only wish now ,that I had lived in Cali when their housing boom happened and learned his techniques decades ago.
I'm actively seeking his book or books or more seminars,I feel all young Carpenters should be exposed to his methods ,I for one am glad to have seen his show on Amazon prime,and hope Amazon shows more carpentry related presentations",1440288000,,874,4.718954248366013

8429471,3,B004HD60LO,Will Holladay is pretty good at doing what he does and certainly has a knack for explaining his moves to any mixed audience.  The quality of the film was a JOKE though.  I know that its more about the subject material than the aesthetics of the filming...but this was just gratuitously crappy.  It was hard to see even what the hell was going on everytime they would zoom in.,1334707200,5,375,4.405797101449275
