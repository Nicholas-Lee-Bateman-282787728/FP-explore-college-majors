4556472,2,B000U9X1YI,"Wow, this was fairly bad. Actually, it was one of those movies that was so bad, it was funny. The script and score reminded me of a t.v. mystery show from the 80's...think Magnum P.I. Amazon has it listed as a 2015 movie. My guess is that is when they added it as a rental option. After looking it up, I learned that this movie is a Lifetime movie from 2005. Rent it, if you just can't get enough of Lifetime and Hallmark movies.",1451174400,4,429,4.119047619047619
4556473,2,B000U9X1YI,A poorly made and acted movie more suited to people who like poorly made and acted Lifetime tv movies.,1449619200,,102,4.421052631578948

4556475,3,B000U9X1YI,"Allison Conner (played by Sarah Lancaster) is a beautiful young secretarial assistant accompanying her boss to an electronic technology conference. While she is out jogging she meets Philip Lauder (Mark Humphrey), the boss of the main company in the field that is organizing the conference. Allison's boss has been trying to get an interview with Lauder without success. Lauder is immediately infatuated with Allison, seduces her and marries her. Allison finds however that Lauder's first wife Monique mysteriously disappeared or died, and Allison becomes suspicious of her husband's behaviour when she is confined to their estate. Also, right at the opening of the film, we see a young computer operator being deliberately mowed down by a hit-and-run driver: this too might have something to do with Lauder's commercial empire, though Allison has no knowledge of this at this time. This is an enjoyable thriller with a couple of unexpected twists. The film was directed by Philippe Gagnon.",1348963200,3,990,5.312101910828026
4556476,4,B000U9X1YI,"This is a good, not too exciting, suspenseful film in which a young secretary meets a man while jogging. The two are attracted to each other. She soon finds out that he is very secretive and strong-willed, but he is a multi-billionaire with body guards. There is a whirlwind romance and the two marry despite her knowing little about him.

 She discovers that he was married twice previously. She was not told about one marriage that lasted about a week. The two divorced just before their business, which he kept, soared and is now worth forty billion dollars. She had been told about a wife who was kidnapped and killed, but now the death looks very suspicious, like murder. She finds out that there have been lots of murders. All are related to the business in some way. She comes across a set of papers hidden by the murdered wife. They tell about the many murders. She is convinced that her husband arranged the deaths. She is contacted by an FBI agent who tells her that her husband was involved with the murders. She meets with the killed wife's lawyer - the prior wife went to him to arrange a divorce - who advises her to be very careful. Both of these people are murdered. Is her husband a murderer? If not, who did the killings and why?",1297296000,8,1247,4.464912280701754
4556477,3,B000U9X1YI,NOT 2015 as listed but 2005. If the leading man wasn't hot I'm not sure I would have watched this all the way through. It's ok but that's all.,1505260800,,142,3.9310344827586206

4556487,5,B000U9X1YI,"An average moviegoer would usually never watch an indie film, but I am an open-minded Millennial and love to test out new items such as movies. Initially, I was attracted to this film because of its main cast member Sarah Lancaster. She was a key component of Chuck's success on NBC and is an underrated actress in my opinion. When you watch this film, I think you'll feel the same way. Hopefully you give this indie film a chance and view it because it will surely stick in your memory long after watching!",1496361600,2,507,4.462365591397849

4556495,4,B000U9X1YI,I thought that this movie was worth watching...it held my interest with a suspenseful plot. A beautiful secretary falls for a billionaire but knows little about him. She finds papers from his previous dead wife that might implicate him in murder. If you enjoy suspense films than this is right up your alley!,1484006400,2,308,4.830188679245283

4556502,4,B000U9X1YI,"Decent story line in a lower budget film. Prettily filmed. Good acting by all the main characters. A red herring worked (for me).
Young woman meets, falls in love with billionaire (a Tom Cruise type). She begins to suspect him of nefarious deeds. Trail of blood. Twist ending. Good enough to watch on a Sunday afternoon.",1477785600,2,320,4.732142857142857

4556529,4,B000U9X1YI,It is a good movie but not an edge of your seat kind of movie. Allison is on a business trip with her boss. While her boss goes off to a meeting she decides to go jogging where she meets Phillip who sweeps her off her feet and they soon marry. Not long after they marry she's told that she can't go anywhere alone and must always have a bodyguard with her. She finds out about his two previous wives where one was kidnapped and murdered and she becomes suspicious of her new husband. Phillip is a software mogul and at the beginning of the movie you see a young computer genius get run down by a hit and run driver. She starts searching the mansion and finds some clues to his first wife and then tries to get away. The ending isn't what you'd expect with it's twist you never saw coming.,1455580800,3,788,4.1568627450980395

8456148,5,B000U9X1YI,"This movie played from beginning to end like a Lifetime movie. It was predictable, but enjoyable with suspense, throughout. I felt the husband was (spoiler) innocent from the get go. I've seen this type of movie many times over and the plot usually goes in the same direction, ending with the same results. I gave it five stars, because Sarah Lancaster portrayed a believable character, one not out to gain anything but love from the man she met under supposedly innocent and fateful circumstances.",1518480000,,498,4.940476190476191

The main characters had no chemistry and the character development was poor.  I gave it two stars only for the interesting part in the middle, but overall it really deserves one star.  There are many other decent suspense movies to watch.  Don't waste your time.",1506988800,2,424,4.739726027397261
8456153,4,B000U9X1YI,"Enjoyed this one a lot!

8456155,4,B000U9X1YI,"I love Sarah Lancaster. She has a very good body shape, great looking face and I felt she's really sexy in this movie. The scheme of love and romance is good in this movie and the suspense was not so surprised. I think that is the reason why this movie is not high ranking. But I like it overall.
