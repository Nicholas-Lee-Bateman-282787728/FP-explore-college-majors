8319588,5,B001LRLSWU,"Best wakeboarding film to date. The music, Randall's story, cinematography, locations, everything is perfect! If you haven't seen it watch it even though it's a little older. At least watch both of Randall's sections if you can't watch the entire thing.",1409011200,,253,5.195121951219512
8319589,5,B001LRLSWU,You will love the soundtrack. I used to have it in high school but lost it when I moved. Purchased it again just for the soundtrack. Tricks performed are cool but they're way more developed today.,1400803200,,196,4.472222222222222
8319590,5,B001LRLSWU,This DVD is amazing. The cinematography and soundtrack are out of control. One of the most beautiful and well put together films I have ever seen.,1267574400,,146,4.653846153846154
