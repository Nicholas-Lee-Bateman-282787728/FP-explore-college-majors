8054063,5,B0007YMW46,"I have literally had to tie-up some of my viewing guests before showings of ""The Comfort of Strangers.""  I am spending this space for my feelings about that one film from this collection.

I have been a fan of this glorious waltz through deranged minds and innocents since first seeing it aboard Naval Air Station Diego Garcia (in the middle of the Indian Ocean).  After the films conclusion, when an audience of hardened Military Pilots (and Crews) disperse in silence (some in tears), it's a sure bet that the film has some kind of film magic in it.

Since Natasha Richardson's dealth this past year, it has been almost impossible to find a copy of this film unless you were willing to mortgage your home to pay for it.  Rupert Everet has the perfect blend of handsome masculinity mixed with innocence, that makes men and women both (even STR8 Military men) stop for a moment and want to touch.  Helen Mirren can tear your heart out with such smoothness that you won't even notice it gone until you fall over clutching your chest and notice the emptiness.  Christopher Walken is the quintessential carrier of the essence of Evil, hidden behind Dupioni Silks and a crude swaveness that can break down the human spirit with a flick of a hand.

Incorporate all above and then, add Venice as the backprop.  The mist, the twinkle of light upon the waters of the canals. The mixture of fear and inexaustible curiosity of the younger couple (Richardson and Everet) with the lifestyle of the more mature couple (Mirren and Walken) behind the stark stone facade of their sumptious mansion overlooking the canals.

Slow and deliberate in it's plot-building, the storyline makes a quick turn directly into depraved madness.

One of the most impressionistic bombarments of my own senses.  Will I ever get over it?  I doubt I will...",1258243200,4,1822,4.764331210191083
