2299736,5,B0009LS9Y4,"I have a 4 year-old that gets really scared and anxious when we talk about dangerous situations.  However, these are discussions we need to have with him.  A friend suggested The Safe Side:  Stranger Safety as a fun way to give him the information to keep himself safe.  I seemed really, really cheesy and really early-2000s and I wasn't sure my kids would be that into it but we gave it a try.

There is SO much good information in this video.  It teaches kids ways to know how to interact with strangers, ""kinda knows"" (people your kids interact with but that aren't family...), as well as ""Safe Side Adults"" (parents).  It empowers kids to feel like they can say no and how to get help when they need it.  But, it is presented in a really fun way that kept my children's interest.  I showed it to my 4 year old and his 2 year old brother.  Neither boy was scared by it, both were able to verbalize what they had learned about staying safe, and both keep asking to watch it again.",1467590400,3,982,4.288043478260869

I am so thankful to have these meaningful and relevant resources to present to our students.

2299742,5,B0009LS9Y4,"I purchased this video for our 4 year old. I was a little apprehensive about whether it would be appropriate and if he would understand. I wanted something that wouldn't overdo it and make him think he shouldn't talk to anyone. He LOVES this video and has asked to watch it every day since we received it. Be sure to sit with your child and watch it together. There's a point in the video where they recommend pausing the video to talk about what was just taught. The video clearly defines three categories of people: your ""safe side adult"", ""kinda knows"" and ""don't knows"". The Safe Side Chick is a little goofy, but this video is meant to target children. Great Introduction to stranger safety.",1463097600,2,696,4.576

2299758,5,B0009LS9Y4,I can't recommend this video enough!  My kids love it and I am so very grateful for it!  Our kids watch it about every 6 months to remind ourselves how to make wise choices to keep safe.  I love the part where safe side super chick very easily picks up this little boy who is a black belt in karate.  Some of our kids think there strength will protect them from adults and that illustration was helpful for them to have a more realistic view of their abilities.  I would recommend this video for all kids aged 3-12.,1447891200,,515,4.214285714285714

2299761,4,B0009LS9Y4,Great video for very young children. Gets their attention from the start. I wanted a video about stranger danger but this goes over all kinds of danger & safety issues. Havent made it all the way through yet because its soooo long to watch w young child (hes 4). I had the old VHS version that i actually liked better. My daughters elementary school showed that one to the whole school! Overall a good buy though,1441497600,,412,4.434210526315789

2299763,5,B0009LS9Y4,Great tips that are understandable to kids. I would start around 5-years of age. I don't think a 4-year old can totally understand. The video touches on real life situations and doesn't just focus on strangers since most abuse happens with a person the child knows. Excellent resource for educators and parents!,1439337600,,311,5.0

Every parent we have shared this with has gone and bought it for themselves. It may come off as a little cheesy in places for adults but the kids relate to it and take the message to heart. We especially like the fact that the content is to the point and gives kids ""permission"" to scream if they feel endangered and encourages them to trust their instinct.",1432425600,,512,4.457446808510638

After an incident with my oldest daughter in a mall where she was almost abducted at age 3, I immediately bought this DVD.

My daughter, now 7 and my 4 year old son regularly watch this DVD because they love it. I love it because the message of safety and how to determine who their safe side adults are is being repeatedly ingrained in their minds.
There's no such thing as them watching a DVD too many times when it's this one. Safety for my children is a top priority and this video is the best!",1425686400,,569,4.2592592592592595

2299797,5,B0009LS9Y4,"From the first moment I tried to talk to my little girl about stranger safety at age 3, she has been frightened and resistant to listening.  You might think I have been tactless or used overly scary language, but honestly...I  have been as gentle and age appropriate as possible.  Even if I just said something like, ""not all strangers are good guys, even if they act that way,"" she would go into a tailspin, cry and cover her ears.  She was really freaked out by the idea that some people are truly bad and not as they appear.  She is now 5, and attending preschool, and stranger safety is just so important.  She loves people and is so trusting.  What to do?!

 I saw this video at our local library and thought I would try it, even though my daughter insisted she didn't want to see it.  I finally convinced her that it wasn't scary.  There was a bit of hesitancy as the movie started, but soon we were watching it together--and laughing out loud!  After it was over, my daughter was ready to watch it again.  The information was really excellent and treats children as capable, intelligent people.  I only wish it had explored the possibility of strangers posing as law or other trusted professionals.  Otherwise, it's pretty close to perfect:  great info, watchable and really funny.  This is something I want to own.",1414627200,,1322,4.5574468085106385
2299798,5,B0009LS9Y4,"I used this for a Cub Scout Meeting on Keeping Safe for 2nd grade Wolf Scout boys and it was perfect.  While I know many people use this for younger kids, it turned out to be perfect for a bunch of 6-7-8 year old boys.  They were old enough to entirely appreciate the message and  enjoyed the humor without finding it too silly or over the top.  Had they been much older, they might think it was lame; younger and they wouldn't digest all of the important information and distinctions.  One thing we added to the presentation was the discussion of having a safe password for the ""kinda know"" people in case parents actually do designate an alternative person not on the child's regular list. A Cub Scout endorsed policy that has been proven effective. We also did some role playing afterwards of things a person might say to try to get a child to reveal personal information on the phone or through the door.  Great fun!

Also, while some people complained about the quality of the DVD, mine was perfect.",1413331200,,1004,4.513812154696133

Plus it makes it so easy to really make your kids understand that people that may hurt them don't necessarily look like bad guys.  It also includes tips that at the time, I might not have thought to tell the kids--like the fact that adults should only ask other adults for help (i.e., ""little girl, can you help me find my lost dog?"" is not ok).  I remember spending a lot of time asking the kids to be quiet when they were small, but another important point is teaching your kids WHEN to yell.  As in yelling for HELP!  I love the classifications of a safe side adult, a don't know and a kinda know.  We used these techniques for years and the older kids were excited that we started using it for their little brother.",1409097600,4,882,4.147058823529412

I wasn't even sure my daughter could discern the subject matter among the silly stuff.  But there wasn't anything else out there so I bought it and watched it with my daughter and tried to emphasize the important details as we watched.  Then she watched it herself, several times, because she liked it.  Well, this DVD might have saved her life.  At a birthday party in a busy, public place, I dropped her off for 20 minutes (with 12 other moms there) before I returned and a stranger tried to coax her away from the group!!  She didn't even mention it until days later (!) and when she did, she did it so casually that I had to stop and say, ""WHAT?!"" and have her repeat it.  She told me ""I did what Safe Side Super Chick said..."" and she followed the advice.  I was stunned, to say the least.  And we both love Safe Side Super Chick :) .",1401062400,,976,4.176470588235294

It is very easy to understand, and a little silly, but for both of those reasons it was great for my preschoolers.  They had some questions, but for the most part, the video helped them learn what they need to know about staying safe without wallowing in terror about all of the bad things that could happen to you.

The actress who lead the lessons is brilliant.  Again, very silly, but brilliant.  The bright colors and sounds help kids decode the lessons and really commit them to memory.  The songs and tips are catchy and stuck with my kids and me, so that we can remember what to do to stay safe when we are out in public together.

It gave us some new terminology to use too in reference to strangers, a ""don't know"", a ""kind of know"" and a ""safe side adult"" that also gave us more to discuss as a family. We also used it as a practice and tested my son's new safety skills (like not opening the door unless we were with him even if he recognizes the person at the door).

An older man waved at her when we were out to lunch the other day and she turned to me to say ""it's okay to wave back, because I'm with you, right Mom?""  This question would never have come without Safe Side Super Chick!

It's definitely goofy and silly, it's not one of those clever Pixar shows with layers of meaning where the adults can have a giggle, too.  But it keeps kids' attention, they enjoy it and they come away with a practical understanding of grouping adults based on a familiar color-coded schema:  Green (safe side adults), Yellow (Kinda Knows) and Red (don't knows).

Its hard to find the right words without scaring your children, but this did a great job - mostly by using terms and phrases that kids can remember.  It was also incredibly silly at times, with a good balance between that and the more serious discussion of how children should (or should not) interact with people they don't know.  It was a good length for small children, as well - just long enough to keep their attention, but not so long that they got bored.  (This was a class of very active 5 and 6 year olds!)

I watched this video myself before I allowed my kids to see it -- just in case.

The thrust of the video is a prioritization of trust.  At the top of the pyramid are ""Safe Side Adults"" -- the people (up to four) that your children can implicitly trust to take care of them no matter what.  In our family, it is me, my wife, mother-in-law, and babysitter.  Not even sister-in-law is in the list, because it has to be short; kids need to be able to remember it.

There is one point of confusion.  Children learn to shout ""Stranger"" and point when there is a problem.  But this video asserts you should never use the term (in spite of the title).

The narrative is a little disjointed and the categories are a little blurry.  But our kids (ages 3 and 7) get the idea and have latched onto it.  It is an engaging video and the kids REQUEST to watch it, and have done so repeatedly.  That's okay with me!",1364256000,,1083,4.189320388349515

Our children (Currently 5 & 4 but started watching this video at ages 4 & 3.) have already identified potential threats while we have been out in public.

This video has spurred many discussions about safety and how they should act around people they're not familiar with and situations that may be threatening.  It categorizes people to children in an understandable way (""The Safe Adults"","" Don't Knows"", ""Kinda-Knows"").  It also introduces boundaries and personal space and how a child should be aware of their own personal space & boundaries.

2299934,4,B0009LS9Y4,"Well worth the money (which is 1/2 the price of a brick and mortar store... excluding the $5 bin!).  My 6 yr old son watched the video once and got the message.  The video starts off a bit slow and corny and my son (who is very fidgety to begin with) showed little interest.  But within 5 minutes, he was hooked.  The fast motion scene where the little dog is chasing Safe Side Super Chick had him rolling around on the couch in fits of laughter.  As mentioned by others, the green/yellow/red clothing to signify the safety level is really effective.  We only watched the video twice and he understands the significance of the words ""stranger danger - red shirt"".  I am very satisfied with this purchase.

2299944,5,B0009LS9Y4,This DVD was awesome. I had been looking for a video or book that could teach my daughter more than just to be cautious around people that she does not know. I wanted her to begin to have skills to discern when a situation is safe and unsafe and to have some skills to know what to do. My 4 year year old daughter found it to be entertaining but also learned some valuable skills. We are going to watch the video at least once a week over the next few months to make sure that she has fully grasped all of the concepts. I would recommend this video.,1339804800,,549,4.045871559633028
2299945,5,B0009LS9Y4,"This isn't a topic that I am really anxious to talk about with my kids.  I want my children to be inquisitive and friendly.  I don't want them to be afraid of people.  On the other hand I also want them to be safe.  I want them to be confident and self-aware.  The only way to ensure that they are, though, is to teach them.
I decided it was time to talk to my 3 year-old daughter about ""stranger danger"" when she told me that the UPS guy and the grocery store cashier were her ""friends.""  Every kid is different, but RockstarGirl seems to learn best from TV.  (Don't ask me why; I was SO against kids watching TV before I had any.)  So I did a lot of research and came up with the Safe Side DVDs.

Mom's Review: ***** Love it!  Covers all the important topics in easy-to-understand language while being fun and engaging.
RocketGirl's (age 3.5yo) Review: *****  Had to stop the DVD several times to explain terms and concepts.  Kind of freaked her out a little bit in the beginning, but she totally loved SafeSide SuperChick and after the first few minutes didn't want the DVD to stop!  RocketGirl since has asked to watch this no less than a dozen times. I let her watch it 5 times the first day (literally! at her request) and twice the next day. She LOVES SuperChick and has demonstrated absolute retention - and freaking out fellow Kmart customers - by screaming, ""Mommy, is that a STRANGER? He is a DON't KNOW! Don't talk to him, mommy!"" (To give her credit, dude was super-creepy.)

Target age: 4y+

The Characters:
(1) SafeSide SuperChick is zany and informative.  She builds confidence by demonstrating scenarios that could be frightening in a way that is educational and empowering without being intimidating or scary.
(2) SafeSide Adult - Three people (in addition to Mom & Dad) who love you unconditionally and would do ANYTHING to keep you safe.
(3) Don't Knows - People you've never seen before.
(4) Kinda Knows - Dentist, teacher, soccer coach, cashier, mailman, lifeguard, cashier, grocer, other kids parents, etc.  Anyone you kind-of know but who isn't your SafeSide Adult.

SafeSide Hot Tips:
(1) Know who your SafeSide Adults are.  Ask your parents to give you a list of three additional people you can trust in their absence.
(2) Never go out of sight of your SafeSide adult.  If you can see them they can see you.
(3) Never answer the door.  Don't go near the door without your SafeSide Adult.  If someone comes to the door, quietly run to your SafeSide adult and tell them.
(4) Don't speak to anyone you don't know unless your SafeSide adult is with you.  Never give any information about yourself to someone you don't know - like your name or phone number or address.
(5) Think and be aware of tricks.  An adult would NEVER ask a kid for help.  Yell and run away.  Find your SafeSide Adult.
(6) Don't let anyone in your SafeSide circle - about 10 steps.  Always be aware of who is in your circle.  If an adult you don't know tries to get into your SafeSide circle, run away to your SafeSide adult.
(7) Never go anywhere with a Kinda-Know without your SafeSide adult.  Tell them ""I don't go anywhere without asking my mom and dad.  I have to go ask!""  Then RUN and ask.
(8) If you are separated from your SafeSide adult find a WOMAN with kids or someone who works there.  If someone you don't know (or even kind of know) tries to talk to you or tell you to come with them without your SafeSide adult, run away and scream ""This isn't my Dad!"" or Mom.  Use your loudest voice.  It's ok to yell and kick.

Most kids who get abused or hurt don't get abused by strangers- they get abused by what this video calls ""kinda-knows."" This DVD does a superb job of Showing kids AND PARENTS some of those scenarios and how to stay safe in very clear, but nonscary ways.  My own son used to beg to watch this weekly!

The DVD will seem hokey to older kids- that might just be why they should watch it too.  I know too many tweens and teens who could have avoided much heartache had they known how to be proactive in some of these scenarios.",1334448000,,629,4.0894308943089435

It is so well done that even my 2 & 1/2 year old daughter will now point out to me dangerous stranger situations when we are at a restaurant or shopping.  For example, if she sees a child without an adult nearby, she will say ""that girl doesn't have her 'Safe Side' adult.""  Now that is an effective message!",1332201600,2,635,4.223140495867769

We went to the libary and took out several DVD's and videos and they weren't at all what we were looking for. This one was excellent. It kept him captured in all the action and engaged him to ask questions. We watch it every few days as a family to practice his safety. He never tires of watching it and when we go to the store he will tell me the people that are ""Don't Knows."" He still talks to parents of kids he thinks he knows, but he is working on it.

As a mom who worries about the safety of her child, I've been looking for books and videos that are age appropriate, informative, easy to remember, & fun to learn from but, also isn't too lame for a NYC child. I discovered all this from The Safe Side, a DVD created by John Walsh (of America's Most Wanted) and Julie Clark (founder of Baby Einstein) that teaches about stranger safety. This educational and informative DVD is for ages 4 and up and is my daughter's & my all time favorite video. I like that my daughter knows what to do when someone tries to talk to her and her Safe Side Adult (that's me & her dad) is not with her. This video teaches children what to yell if someone tries to grab them and how to tell the difference between people you kinda know and people you don't know. It also features Safe Side Superchick to get the message across.

She does not meet a stranger, and while that's nice in some situations, it's sometimes a little scary because she will talk to anyone who pays the least little attention. My second grader watched the video again in a guidance class at school. Over the summer, she insisted we check it out from the library for her little sister, who's about to start Kindergarten. We recently took it on a trip, and they watched it several times in the car. Even my middle school kid, who saw it years ago, picked up a few things. My youngest has been repeating the tips, and all three of my kids have asked questions.

I am pleased because the ideas in this video are presented in a fun fashion so children think it is a treat to watch: ""Movie time!"" We can laugh at the funny things that happen in the video, but at the same time I am able to ask questions like, ""What should the little girl do in that situation?"" ""What would you do if a stranger knocked on your door?"" etc. and the child can take away important information and generalize it to his/her life.",1311292800,,671,4.333333333333333
2299970,1,B0009LS9Y4,"As the founder of a national organization that deals with missing and exploited children that is two years senior to the National Center, I find it remarkable that John Walsh promotes a video about stranger danger in 2005, when one year later Nancy McBride publishes an article stating the concept of stranger danger is not effective [The National Center article may be found by Googling ""Stranger Danger""]
Despite the fact that John Walsh continually attempts to cloak himself in a Robert Stack/Elliot Ness grandeur, the only reason his son was kidnapped was because his wife left him alone in a crowded department store, while she went off to do shopping. And for that, the Walshes have become multi-millionaires and authorities on abducted children. No one should discount the pain of a murdered child, but neither should those who have contributed to the death be rewarded and revered. Neither the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children nor John Walsh have ever found a stranger-abducted child, living or dead.

The fact of the matter is that there are extremely few stranger abductions of children, and when there are, we hear about them on the news. Most of the photographing and fingerprinting events are simply scare tactics to be able for those involved in the missing children racket to raise money. Ernie Allen, the CEO of NCMEC took home $1,344,567 in salary in 2008 and in 2006 and 2007, Walsh, took more than $76,572 from contributions to pay for his medical bills. [The St. Petersburg Times article detailing these facts may be found by Googling ""Ernie Allen"" salary]. It seems like at least some of that money could have gone to pay for a full-time case worker. But it didn't and it won't. NCMEC totally botched the Elizabeth Smart case, where both she and her abductor were a quarter of a mile away across open terrain, watching the search.

But Walsh and the National Center have become iconic, immune to criticism or public scrutiny.",1307059200,8,1964,4.912650602409639

I love this video because it opens the door for communication about these issues with children in a fun, silly way that kids love. My girls still like watching the video just for the fun of it (but they still learn safety along the way!).

It lets kids know what to do in situations that could be scary for the adults in their lives. I don't want my children to live in fear, but I want to empower them to make wise decisions. When they're little, they need to know how to stay safe, but not necessarily the ""why"". This video gives kids tools & guidelines in a format they love.

(It's also really funny and they will laugh at the silliness while they are soaking in the important info.)  It teaches them great terms such as ""a don't know"" - used instead of ""stranger"".  Kids sometimes don't understand that strangers can be people who look nice and friendly, but they know exactly what it means to ""not know someone"".  The terms and definitions don't leave any gray area in their mind.  I think all kids should see this!",1277510400,,583,4.452830188679245
2299996,3,B0009LS9Y4,"My kids were entertained by this video.  It worked well as an intro to some discussions about safety.  It was a little confusing and annoying...  But I did like that it didn't make strangers sound too horribly frightening.  I wanted to talk to my kids about staying safe without making them feel like everyone is out to get them, and this video does accomplish that.",1276041600,,366,4.584615384615384
2299997,5,B0009LS9Y4,Awesome video! Keeps my kids interested while at the same time teaching them stranger danger! Excellent movie.,1276041600,,110,5.529411764705882
2299998,5,B0009LS9Y4,Wonderful video for your children.  My 5 year old grandaughter watches it over and over and over again and I watch it with her. She has been watching it since she was 3. With the problems in today's world it is good to have this video if you have young children. It teaches them who is looking out for them and who is a not and who they should be very careful of. I would highly recommend this video for all parents with young children.,1274400000,,436,4.129411764705883
2299999,5,B0009LS9Y4,"""Stranger Safety"" is a well-designed program that teaches children (I would say ages 5-12) how to avoid dangerous situations with people they are not very familiar with and/or are completely unfamiliar with. I liked that the program uses certain identifying words to describe these people, that is instead of referring to these people as ""strangers"", the terms ""don't knows"" and ""kinda knows"" are used instead. This makes a lot of sense as many young children really don't comprehend who/what strangers are.

The narrator is an adorable (read= kid friendly) lady who depending on the message she's sending, dresses either in green (safe situations), yellow (cautionary situations), and red (dangerous situations). Through re-enactments, children are taught how to always remain with Safe Side Adults (people they trust such as mom, dad, grandparents, teachers) and how to handle situations that may put them at risk. These scenarios make it clear what is to be expected and how to cope. For example, let's say a child has accidentally become separated from his/her Safe Side Adult, what is the child to do? According to the program, the child is to approach an adult (e.g. a mom) with children and ask for help, or when feeling unsafe (e.g. being approached by a Don't Know), to yell loudly and run away.

The tricky situation is when a child is approached by a Kinda Knows type - e.g. a coach, an acquaintance of mom or dad, basically people the child recognizes and is somewhat familiar with, but is not on the Safe Side Adult list. The program makes it clear what the child should not do - that is NOT to follow this Kinda Know types when he/she approaches the child and asks the child to follow.

I truly felt the program addressed some major safety concerns regarding strangers and after pre-viewing it, I felt confident enough to watch it again with my child and discuss the concerns with her. The total running time is about 42 minutes. The show may address a serious issue, but it does so in a fun and lighthearted way so as not to scare children off. Highly recommended.",1272240000,,2079,4.817927170868347
2300000,5,B0009LS9Y4,This product is really good and explains the stranger concept very nicely and at a level that kids understand.,1272067200,,110,4.842105263157895
2300011,5,B0009LS9Y4,"I love this - it's really goofy, but not stupid-goofy.  My 4-year-old daughter really took to it and after watching it a few times, seems to understand the principles.  This presented practical ideas and wisdom without being scary.  I'd say this needs to be shown in schools repeatedly.",1269907200,,286,4.916666666666667
2300012,5,B0009LS9Y4,"We bought this when my daughter was 4.  I was not sure how to get this very important message across without scaring her.  But this DVD has helped immensely!  We have watched it many times.  We watch it together.  We discuss while we watch.  We practice what we've both learned.  The more we have watched, the more confidence she has gained about what to do in the case of a stranger.  I have recommended this to my brother for his daughter and my cousin for her son.  It is never too early to start ""stranger danger"".  This DVD makes it easy to talk about and helps children understand who a stranger is in a comfortable way.  I cannot say enough about it.  My daughter is older now and we still watch it just to keep aware.",1267228800,,725,4.25
2300013,5,B0009LS9Y4,"I *hate* this video; it's filled with constant interruptions and annoying sound effects.  My four-year-old, however, LOVES it!

2300016,5,B0009LS9Y4,"As soon as we were done watching this, my daughter wanted to watch it again.  I would highly recommend this video because it's honest, not scary and definitely silly.  It also gave me guidelines to set up some family rules.  We'll be watching this a lot as we raise our family.",1258934400,,277,4.392156862745098
2300017,5,B0009LS9Y4,Super DVD.  I recommend it to every parent with little ones.  I thought the show was kind of corny but the kids loved it and the points really stuck with my kids now 5 and 3.  They love to watch the show over and over and talk about safety points and review who their safe side adults are.  I realize what I thought was corny was exactly what makes the movie appealing to the kids and helps them remember all the right things.  Every parent should own this and play it frequently.,1258761600,,480,4.173913043478261
2300018,5,B0009LS9Y4,I am very happy with this product and have recommended it to friends.  My children really have taken to the message.,1258416000,,116,4.523809523809524

He loves this DVD and asks to watch it all the time.  Now when we're out he's always making sure he's close to his ""safe-side adult"".  It's everything the description says it is and it's not too annoying to watch as an adult (you know how it is). I highly recommend this to kids of all ages.",1256083200,,458,4.101123595505618
2300020,4,B0009LS9Y4,"They arrived quickly and in great condition.  The kids have been entertained by the videos and not scared.

2300021,5,B0009LS9Y4,"I'm very glad we bought this. Realistic situations shown with how children should deal with them. It also lays out a ""plan"" for your family to establish 3-4 ""safe side adults"" so your children don't have to individually assess whether someone is safe or not. Everyone should have this.",1251676800,,285,4.836734693877551
2300022,5,B0009LS9Y4,"My children (7 & 4) really liked this DVD and asked to watch it again.  Entertaining yes, but more importantly it addresses the topic w/o being overly threatening.  It's a good starting point for young children and parents.",1251676800,,223,4.842105263157895

2300025,3,B0009LS9Y4,"We just received this video today. Though much of the information is excellent, I am turned off by the obnoxiousness.  I was hoping the Julie Clark would have more of a narrative role because of her soothing voice.  The host was just a bit too wacky for me and my four year old said, ""she is very silly isn't she.""  I can appreciate that the creators of this video wanted to make it 'fun' for children, my concern, however, is that a lot of the information could be missed because of all the added distractions.",1243814400,,511,4.3578947368421055
2300026,1,B0009LS9Y4,It's a very disappointing DVD. I had high expectations because it was produced by John Walsh. My son asked me to turn it off because it was to loud. Unfortunately there are no other product out there. The only really nice one I found was the Berenstains Stranger book. I can highly recommend it.,1243382400,2,295,4.481481481481482
2300027,5,B0009LS9Y4,"I don't usually bother to write reviews, but as a mom of three, I wanted other moms to know this video is a great one. It handles a very serious subject matter in such an age appropriate manner. My 9 year old still loves it and will watch it with my 6 and 3 year old. It covers the scary stuff that is hard to explain to your kids in a great way! My kids think it is so funny and learn at the same time. They watch it over and over so the stuff sticks. Make sure to watch it with your kids!",1242345600,,490,3.7211538461538463

The product was received shortly after I ordered it on Amazon. Good deal for the content contained in the Stranger Safety video.",1242259200,,199,4.882352941176471
2300029,5,B0009LS9Y4,The message is so clear and my kids really got it! Now when we are out they can tell me who someone is what to do. The video is really simple but that's the best way to explain things to kids. I saw a lot of the reviews complained about the music. I didn't think it was that bad and it makes it so much easier for parents to help their kids be safe.,1242086400,,349,3.72972972972973
2300030,1,B0009LS9Y4,"A really bad DVD. It's too loud and my son was just requesting to turn of  the sound. It was confusing and to much unrelated actions. I am very disappointed, I thought with John Walsh as a co producer it would be more informative and educational. I was looking for a child appropriate product that would help me to educate my kids without scaring them. It was a waste of money. The only useful product I found is The Berensteins STRANGER book.",1240185600,4,443,4.402439024390244
2300031,5,B0009LS9Y4,"I loved this video for my daughter. I had tried previously to explain the concept of strangers and I just ended up terrifying her instead.

2300032,5,B0009LS9Y4,"This DVD is fun & brilliant. The days of saying just 'Don't talk to strangers' are over.  It categorizes all people children run into on a daily basis and teaches them to think of these people as one of 3 categories. So, the child learns to identify the person's category, then they know how to react. I learned so much as a parent.  I love that they also go over the fact that just because we may 'know' someone, doesn't mean that we do what they say, you always ask your 'safe side adult'. Big thanks to the creators!",1239753600,,519,4.232323232323233

My son, 6, recited the tips given after only watching it once.  The video offers great information and tips and isn't scary at all!  It is something that we will watch over and over!",1239321600,,322,4.333333333333333
2300034,5,B0009LS9Y4,I have a 5 and 9yr old and this keeps both of their attention. It is not a corny ol' video. Fast moving and colorful and tons of GREAT information. Definitely worth showing every kid you know!!,1238803200,,193,4.243243243243243
2300035,5,B0009LS9Y4,"I bought this video for my 5 year old daughter.  She watches it almost daily.  We have watched it with her and answered any questions she had.  She automatically follows the advice given on this video everytime we encounter a ""Don't Know"".  She is also aware of other kids around her and says things like, ""Hey where is that little girl's safe side adult?!"".  I think this is the best thing you could do for your young kid.  The content is hysterical for them to watch but is something they can relate to and put to work in their everyday life.  It also helps you as a parent/grandparent/aunt/uncle realize how to tackle this scary subject without making the kids scared of everyday situations.",1237939200,,694,4.59349593495935

It got the point across without being scary. I recommend this video.",1236297600,,312,4.473684210526316
2300037,5,B0009LS9Y4,We just got it yesterday and watched it right away. My 2 girls 4 and 6 years-old loved it! They've asked to watch it over and over again.  I've wanted to discuss being safe around strangers with my kids and this has helped alot. I recommend this video for any parent or child caregiver.,1235606400,,286,4.296296296296297
2300038,5,B0009LS9Y4,"Even though this DVD came out several years ago, it is still a fantastic and relevent teaching aide.  It is one of the few I've seen that also addresses ""kinda knows"" - people like neighbors, parents friends, etc who aren't complete strangers but who you still shouldn't necessarily trust.

My 4 year old was entertained and asks to watch this over and over. Great to see that you don't need animation, big budgets, or name brand characters to teach and entertain kids.

1/3/12 Update: My son is now 7 years old and still finds this video fun and entertaining. We had this in our car for months and for a while it was the go-to video to keep him entertained during car rides. Then last week we had the unfortunate experience having to test our knowledge of these tips first hand. My son was out in our driveway when a strange van pulled up to him and a man called over to him to ask 'have you seen a dog running around the neighborhood?'.  Luckily, I heard/saw this exchange through our screen door and ran outside. As soon as I went out, the man saw me and drove away. But I was glad that my son used his understanding of strangers vs safe side adults to stay away and not engage or converse with the man. We took the opportunity to re-play this DVD and had another conversation about strangers.

Oh, and I did report the incident to the police, and we were lucky that it turned out to be a non-issue.  But it was still scary at the time and I was so happy to have a resource on hand to help explain to my son why this behavior was dangerous.",1235347200,,1543,4.267123287671233
2300039,5,B0009LS9Y4,"I bought this for my 5 year old. I didn't want to talk to her about strangers and scare her. She has watched this many times and loves it. She learned so much the first time. It relates the danger of strangers, as don't knows and kinda knows in an entertainging and non-scary way. It lets her know there are scary people out there who would hurt here without SCARING her!

Truly knowing how dangerous some people are have made us very protective (not to say that any other parent is less protective).  I have purchased this for EVERY family I know.

This movie draws your child in and catches their attention.  The specific ideas about ""Kinda knows"", ""Don't knows"", etc. are easy for children to understand.  John Walsh gives the children a serious lesson without being scary which is very hard to do.  Nobody want's thier child to be petrified that they are going to be kidnapped.  This movie could actually prevent a kidnapping without scarring your child for life.

Please buy it for every parent you know.",1232755200,,748,4.641221374045801

They loved it and watched it over and over.  Long story short - the next week at Disney World I ran to the restroom while my boys and their cousins were with their dad and other family.  In an instant they were separated.  My 5 year old son holding his 7 year old cousins hand got separated from the rest of the family.  My son would not let the older cousins hand go, would not let him wander any more, instantly walked to ""Amanda"" (a lady with small kids) and said, ""I've lost my family can you help us?""  Amanda did help - she kept them right there hoping the family would retrace their steps - they did, they reunited and by the time I got there the boys were sitting on a fence in 'time out' for wandering away - while my son was also being praised for following the 'safe side' rules.  I just think it's a ""God-thing"" that I felt so strongly that they saw this video before we went.  Every parent should show their child this video.  My boys are 5 and 3 and they love it - it is such a difficult thing to teach without terrifying kids - this video does it in a fun way that sticks in their little memories.  Thank you a million times over for making this video.  I'm buying multiple copies (one for the cousins too) right now.",1231372800,,1393,4.065934065934066

The cover for our video is a bit different than the one featured (and more expensive), so perhaps ours was re-mastered after the complaints of the sound from other reviewers. Ours had no technical issues at all. The quality of the acting was superb, and the content couldn't be beat. This is hilarious, educational, and does a better job of informing kids about safety issues in thirty minutes than I think I've done in YEARS of trying to talk to my children about such issues. If we could afford it, I'd purchase this DVD for every family we know. Yes, it is that good. And we so appreciate this coming out of the heartache of John Walsh.

Now that he is going on 3 1/2, this is one of his favorite dvds.  I wavered over buying this because I didn't want to make him fearful of people, but when I realized he liked to say hello to EVERYONE he saw, I was worried he would not hesitate to go off with someone if they had something he liked (truck, toy, candy, etc.)

Now he understands so many of the concepts and likes to repeat them to his younger sisters who think this is just another fun dvd to watch, like Elmo.

Given how much emphasis parents place on learning the alphabet and numbers and other basic building blocks for success, knowing how to protect oneself is even more important for children.  I'm glad I got this DVD.",1229904000,,836,4.326923076923077

Initially she didn't want to watch it, but about 5 minutes in, she said, ""I love this movie!"" She was eager to talk to me about it - the video really helped her understand who she can trust and who she can't.

The way dangerous situations are depicted are great - realistically, but not scary (I didn't want her to be terrorized, thinking all strangers were out to hurt her).

The main character is a little overboard, but I'm the mom, not the kid!

There is nothing scary for children in this, the entire film is upbeat, the terms are easily learned and remembered.

It gave me an opportunity to talk about strangers and being safe and give him different ideas on how strangers can approach him and what to do and who is a stranger and who is not.

Umm,...well,..I guess they can look like anybody...""You mean like Grandma?""  Well, no,...ummm, I mean I guess they could...

I wasn't doing a good job of explaining stranger danger to my three year old twins.  I find it very difficult to explain to my children (without being graphic) why some people are not okay for them to talk to or go with.  They do not understand the concept and I have ended up frightening them of something they can't comprehend.

Stranger Safety allows the parent to designate a ""Safe"" person or people in their child's life, such as the parents, grandparents etc.  Other people (even the ones the kids ""Kinda' Know"") have to be ""screened"" by their 'safe"" person.  This removes any confusion a child may have about who is okay to associate with.  For example, it would not be okay to take a ride from the neighbor if the child's ""safe"" person has not okayed it first.  I find that much easier for a kid to understand.
Put together by John Walsh (from America's Most Wanted) and Julie Clark (of Baby Mozart fame) the movie uses a silly character to talk to kids about the people around them in a clear and concise way that has my kids (even my know-it-all nine year old) riveted to the screen.  It is not at all scary, which was important to me.  I would recommend taking a moment with your child to watch with them and make sure they know who the safe people in their lives are and to personalize it so they know what to do or say in certain situations.
A wonderful, easy way to capture kids attention to talk to them about a very serious subject.",1200614400,,1742,4.523961661341853

They make the whole ""stranger-danger"" concept easy to understand by calling strangers ""don't knows""... much easier for kids to understand and remember. The whole video is packed with scenarios from every day life like getting seperated from your ""safe side adult"" when you're in a busy place, or what to do when someone knocks on the door and you can't find your safe side adult.

My daughter is 6 years old and it did not catch her attention (much to my surprise)!  I just didn't like this video.

2300078,5,B0009LS9Y4,"When I'd first seen this video, I thought it would be a great way to help my very friendly 5 year old learn a bit about 'stranger danger' without scaring her.  Having been big fans of the 'Baby Einstein' series, it gave me confidence that the video would be informative and entertaining; it is.  Safe Side Superchick is silly, but with a serious topic like this, a little levity seems to help keep the focus on the educational aspect, without scaring small ones.

One really great thing that has come out of putting this video in our home repertoire is that my 5 year old asks me questions from time to time about things that she's seen in the program.  It lets me know that she's thinking about what she's watching, and that her 5 year old brain is learning that there is a need to be safe, but without being frightened.

The only downside that we've experienced is that the DVD itself has always been 'difficult' for our DVD player to read.  Sometimes it takes a really long time for the DVD to 'read'; there are times we give up and move on to another video to watch.  I don't know if this is indicative of this particular DVD, but it's something to note.

I would recommend this video to friends, without question.  It brings to light some potentially scary situations, but in a way that a young mind can absorb, without fear.",1197504000,,1330,4.418032786885246

2300080,1,B0009LS9Y4,"I purchased 3 of these videos based on positive reviews as potential Christmas gifts for young nieces, nephews, and family friends. . . I will be sending them back.  There are 3 main problems with this DVD that killed it as a high quality tool that I would give to friends and family.

1.  Bad writing.  Super Safe chick in my opinion is ""Super annoying chick"".  The jokes and gags are not well thought out and do not flow well.  It's dis-jointed and honestly, not very humorous.  Most quality children's productions find a way to be funny or at least tolerable both to adults and children (ie. Pixar films, Sponge Bob).  This DVD left me thinking ""What the hell is this!?"" from the 1st scene all the way to the end.  It's annoying and not funny at the same time.  The sort of thing that makes you feel embarrassed for the people on screen.

2.  Bad production.  Camera work, sound quality, and music are not good.  This video feels very ""thrown together"".

3.  Bad post-production.  Special effects are not executed well, sound effects suck, audio mixing is not good, graphics are not good, editing does not flow well.

Those 3 things killed it.  This DVD was a very good concept, and the scenario scenes are quite good.  The child actors and normal adult actors  did an excellent job at illustrating some real-world situations.  The techniques and protocols being taught are great, and the organization of the material into 3 easily understood categories is great (safe adults, strangers, and people you kindof know).

The crafting of this excellent educational content into a DVD product is abysmal.  There is lots of room for someone with some talent to present the material in a decent way.  Until then, stranger safety protocol in my family will have to be taught the old-fashioned way.",1196726400,15,1792,4.7216828478964405

She clearly and succinctly explains each dangerous scenario and totally holds my daughter's attention (and that is quite a feat!)  The video shows some pretty scary situations, but somehow manages to do it without evoking fear.  It is action-packed and fast-paced.  Your child will get the message of how to be aware of stranger danger without even knowing it!  I would never have thought this topic could be so entertaining, but they certainly have combined the right elements to create a great tool for introducing this topic to children.

It was very difficult for her to explain that even people we know can hurt us, because she didn't want him to distrust everyone.  After this video, that all changed.

When my older son turned 4, I borrowed the DVD back from my sister-in-law and my son has learned whom he can trust and whom he cannot.  I knew the DVD worked when we were at the park and he was about 20 feet from me and a woman who was pushing her child on the swing next to my son asked him what his name was, and he replied, ""I'm sorry, I can't tell you because I don't know you.""  The other mother was so impressed that she came up to me and asked where he learned that, and I told her about this DVD.  IT REALLY WORKS!!

2300093,4,B0009LS9Y4,"After watching the advert on TV my son wanted me to purchase this DVD and I thought it was a good idea too. The amazon price was a bit higher than what was on the manufacturer's website. But amazon was giving free shipping on this item which is why I bought it.
It is a very fast paced show, my son found it funny and it seemed nicely planned, at first. But as a parent, I think it would have been better if the producers paid more attention to getting the message across rather than being funny. I suppose the intention was not to make it scary for the kids or too serious, but sometimes, they could have toned down the funny parts a bit to emphasize to kids that it is NOT funny when it comes to dealing with strangers/people who can hurt them. Some important scenes, like when the strangers are trying to talk to the kids or take them away, were paused and interjected with little reminders and questions by the safe side chick, which breaks the child's attention and distracts them from the main scene. Several times, I had to draw my son's attention to what was happening BEFORE the safe side chick interrupted because things happen so quickly, he can't seem to keep pace.
This DVD might be too aggressive or upbeat for some kids, who don't like all the background noises, too much fast music and loud/too much fast talking. But it is well worth sitting with the child and watching it if you can, as it is a very helpful DVD and the kids are going to learn from it one way or the other. The concept is excellent for this DVD and I do hope they have a newer version in time to come. I have no regrets with this purchase.",1188432000,,1624,4.258899676375404

My older daughter is 8 but is so outgoing and friendly that she has no unwariness towards any stranger at all - she is more than happy to talk to anyone about herself.  I got this video to try and help explain stranger safety without scaring her.  It is very a informational movie - but the approach is taken in a goofy-humorous kind of way - something that my daughter definately related to better than my constant questioning if she knew what a stranger was and to always watch her surroundings.  I plan on showing it to her every once in awhile as a reminder (she is just way too friendly sometimes) and will be showing it to my younger daughter once I feel she is old enough to understand the message.

It was also nice to share with his other care takers (preschool and grandparents).  They can carry over the topic of stranger safety and understand the parenting info we are teaching our son.  It was totally worth the money.  I have suggested it to other parents with 4-6 year olds.,1183593600,,418,4.434210526315789

The girl acted like a lunatic (and a very messy one) most of the time, managing to get food all over her face every time she ate anything - GROSS.  It may help with strangers, but it's stone age manners.  My girls (10 and 12) did laugh once in a while and watch the whole thing, but I didn't have to tell them twice to put it back in the library bag to return it.  I'm Very Glad I didn't buy it!

The main character is awesome and zippy and the video moves at a quick pace while keeping things simple. They go back over points and reinforce definitions. My three year old understood it, and asked to watch it two more times. And he isn't a good movie watcher. He wants to watch things about cars or explosions and this held his interest.",1182988800,,499,4.376344086021505

They are now openly repeating the video, stating ""Grandma is my Safe Side Adult"" or ""That man over there is a Don't Know.""  The actor in this video is really talented - I'm surprised she doesn't have her own show (maybe she does?) because she could give The Wiggles, etc. a run for their money.",1181865600,,559,4.346153846153846

It covers all the safety issues in a way that is very appealing to kids.  My five year old has watched it three times and we only received it yesterday!  It's important for a child to want to watch this dvd and see it several times to really understand the concepts. He wants to show it to all his friends. Even my one year old was interested and danced to the theme song. I was impressed that it covers things that I have heard from the kids I work with such as kids thinking that they can just ""punch and kick the bad guy"" if someone approaches them, and covers what to do if people such as a child's coach or neighbor (""kinda know's"")tries to get them to go somewhere with them. Also, kids are told to yell, ""This is not my Mom (or Dad)!"", if someone tries to grab them. This is so important because abductors can just tell bystanders that the child is having a tantrum if the child yells ""no"" or ""stop"" and carry them out. I wish this video were shown in schools so every child could see it. This product will save lives.",1180742400,2,1150,4.120535714285714

We have talked and talked with her about strangers and going with strangers and how strangers can hurt you etc and she still will walk up to a perfect stranger with no fear.  You can imagine our concern knowing that she is going to start school (I mean, let's face it, it's not at all difficult to walk into a school yard and take a child especially when school lets out).  This video has finally helped us.  It teaches them about ""don't knows"" in a non scary and non threatening manner.  The main character of the video does a great job of being silly and childlike while delivering a very serious message.

2300117,5,B0009LS9Y4,I ordered the Stranger Safety DVD not knowing if my children would take an interest because they only like to look at animated movies. I was very suprised to see that they took a liking to the DVD. They thought it was funny and love to watch it over and over. They learned alot about being safe.  My children's ages are 4yrs old and 3yrs old. I highly recommend this DVD.,1180483200,,371,4.225352112676056

2300119,5,B0009LS9Y4,My son loves Stranger Safety.  They advertised it on the missing persons show and my 6 yearold didn't know there was strangers though I have explained them to him many times.  I also got I Am Not a Target(teaches detours and physical force to get away).  The two go realy good together.  With the recent attempted abduction of a 11 yearold in her back yard in a small town In colorado I sent these dvd's to the babysitter.  She thought they were great for the kids ranging from 1 1/2 to 12 years of age.  My son begs to watch these two over and over and is actually practicing the things they teach.,1180051200,,599,4.256637168141593
2300120,4,B0009LS9Y4,"I've purchased this item three times-once for my daughter, once for my nephews, and once for a co-worker's children.  All the children really enjoy and love the Safe Side Super Chick...she's funny, energetic, and quite goofy and silly.  However, she is serious about being safe and the children really appear to listen to her, while being thoroughly entertained.  She tackles many things, like not opening the front door when an adult is present, and for children not to trust an aquaintence of the family to take them anywhere unless approved directly by a parent.  They also show a good, broad, representation of people who may want to hurt/abduct children:  men and women, black and white, elderly and young, etc...so there is no sterotyping of a predator.  Safe Side Super Chick also vividly addresses how a child skilled in martial arts, is no match for an adult predetor, and this is so important since so many young children are entralled and disillusion by such shows like ""The Power Rangers"".  This deserved 4 and a half stars, but I did not have that selection.  The only reason why I did not give this a 5 star review is because it makes it sound like a child's parent or grandparent would never hurt them, and we know that many children are molested by a parent.  I'm not saying that the video should have tried to tackle that issue too(that would be for another video address an incest issue), but Safe Side Super Chick should not have been so adamant about a parent never harming a child.  Regardless, I strongly recommend this for anyone with children from 2 on up.  It is important to watch it with the younger children so you can emphasize certain things.",1179964800,2,1672,4.691780821917808

This video teaches about Safe Side Adults, Kinda Knows, and Don't Knows.  Excellent!  The video is funny and my kids love to watch it.  Right now they want to watch it at least once per day.  I say yes because I figure that by repetition my kids will learn all of the principles.  We are also able to say, ""Remember what Safe Side Superchick says?""  in certain situations to reinforce what they are learning.  Definitely worth the money.",1179446400,,607,4.348214285714286
2300122,5,B0009LS9Y4,"I love this video. It has really helped open discussions about safety with our kids.

2300123,5,B0009LS9Y4,"This program was very well written and produced, and I found myself laughing out loud several times! The Safe Side Super Chick presented serious material in an extremely funny and capturing way. Some kids may need to watch this several times, as my 5 year-old son actually said he thought he should have helped the woman find her ""lost kitten!"" We only watched it once and obviously need to keep watching it to refresh his memory! But I know this is going to be an excellent tool in teaching him who is safe, and who isn't. AND, it's something that I won't mind watching over and over either, unlike a lot of children's DVDs!",1179273600,,625,4.491228070175438

Despite what I taught, he would talk to strangers in public places and even attempted to wander away from home unsupervised.  This DVD really helped reinforce the importance of stranger safety, without making it scary.  It has opened up new discussion with my son, as now he asks questions about being safe with both people he knows and doesn't know.  I now feel more confident that with his knowledge, he will be safer with strangers, kind-of knows, and relatives/friends.  It's a valuable resources for any pre-schooler's family.",1179014400,,651,5.046728971962617

It is a difficult concept for young children to internalize and this video uses language kids connect with and understand. Best of all, the video demonstrates a variety of situations and shows why they are ""not safe"". It provides parents with opportunities to pause the video so they can elaborate or review with their children. Although the concept of ""strangers"" can be scary for kids, this video is appropriate for the very young.

2300128,4,B0009LS9Y4,"Obviously a great message, if you can hear it with all the sound effects and craziness going on. I don't think the kids got much information out of it. There was so much going on in the movie with gorillas, clowns, and giant dogs that its hard to get the message across. I gave it 3 stars  because its the only safety video I have seen and it does teach a little but it could have been much better.

4/2/12 ** This movie does grow on you. It became one of kids' favorite things to watch. While it may annoy adults, the kids find it funny, informative, and entertaining. I have to upgrade it to 4 stars for that :)",1178496000,11,613,4.1

It breaks down people into ""Don't Knows"", ""Kinda Knows"", and ""Safe Side Adults"".  My kids immediately wanted to quiz me on the adults they saw and what category they would fit into.  This video is very entertaining, not just for the kids, but my husband and I watched too.  It was funny, and the segments were none to long - as to hold the attention of preschool/school age kids.  I loved it, and I am so glad that I bought it.  It might just make a difference someday....",1178496000,,634,4.305084745762712

This DVD is fantastic.  My 3 1/2 year old has watched it maybe 10 times and completely ""gets"" the message of the video.  The back of the DVD case says it's for 5-8 year olds, but younger children can learn a lot from this movie.

Yes, it's corny.  Yes, it's silly.  Yes, it's somewhat face-pace.  SafeSide Superchick is goofy when appropriate, serious when needed.  I think the mix of funny/serious keeps it interesting while getting the important message across.

Apparently there's some Safe Side badges in the DVD case.  I didn't know that, and I didn't pull them out right away to give to my son.  Use common sense...if your child would be distracted by stickers, then save them for later!

I would suggest anyone & everyone view this video with their children.  The message is a life-saver & it's presented in a kid-friendly way that's entertaining & non-threatening while still getting the very serious message across!",1175990400,2,1169,4.77

It is a disappointment to me that Julie Clark allowed this to be in one of her videos--especially because she has daughters.

However, the video comes with stickers and upon first viewing his only concern was paying attention for the signal that he could earn a sticker.

We also talk about the video when the doorbell rings and I remind him that only adults answer the door.  I think this is a very important DVD and a must have for any toddlers.

I bought the video mainly for my 5 year old --- now that she is in kindergarten and getting involved in more things away from home, I realized I had really been remiss on this topic.  Well, both kids LOVE it and beg to watch it over and over.

As other reviewers have noted, the video is funny and entertaining, thus really capturing the attention of both of my children.  I watch the video with them, and I pause it during role plays to make them answer ""what should she do"" before Super Chick or John tell us the answer.  They love shouting out the answers.  The video came with 3 ""Safe Side"" green badge stickers, and my DD was thrilled to earn hers by answering all the questions correctly.",1172275200,,833,4.335483870967742

This DVD filled in the holes beautifully.  Instead of approaching the concept of ""strangers,"" the idea is ""Don't Knows"" and ""Kinda Knows.""  I thought it was BRILLIANT!  My son picked up the new approach immediately and I'm much more secure that he'll know when he's in a potentially dangerous situation and has some tools for how to get himself out of it.

For the parent, I recommend the book ""Protecting the Gift"".  As kids get older, they want a bit more freedom.  Help them to be safe by educating yourself and them.  It's not scary.  It actually reduces worry because you know how to protect them and you know they have some important skills to protect themselves.

They covered a lot of information and used great examples.  My kids are 5 and 6 and really enjoyed it.  My one child asks to see it over and over again.  Now when we are out in public they point out who is a 'don't know' and what you should do when one is near.  I think they are grasping the concept as much as they can for their age level.

Well, after watching this DVD they have been great and they even ask every now and them to be tested so I can give them one of the stickers that comes with the DVD.

The DVD is all played out by people not cartoons, so I think kids will have a realistic view of what to do if any of the situations presented occurs in reality. Also, this dvd is very funny - so kids are not groaning when you ask them to watch and they don't lose interest in the first few minutes. Further, for me it presented discussion points for situations I had not considered, and also to check my kids understanding.

Good Job !! Yesterday we were at the bank and a Man said hello to her and she told him ""I can not tell you my name because I do not know you"" ...  later that day we were at the park and a lady told me that my Daughter told her the same thing...

2300165,5,B0009LS9Y4,"As my little family was watching t.v. one night, my 5 year old daughter said that she had petted a puppy that morning before entering school.  I was terrified!!!  Especially because she takes the school bus and we are not there to protect her. This was reported to the principal, and he said that they would ask the teachers to talk to the little ones about strangers.  Even though we always talk to our kids about this topic, it goes to show that you have to drill it into them not matter what.

My wife and I decided to get this video and we sat down with my daughter and my 10 year old son to watch it.  My dughter started crying because we explained who John Walsh was and what unfortunate events lead to this video.  She was terrified of the idea of being kidnapped and never seeing her big brother, mami, and papi, ever again.  In my opinion, it's good to instill the right kind of fear in kids.  Two days later, what both my kids learned, was reinforced in an innocent situation.

My kids and I take martial arts and there was an important meeting all parents had to attend at a near-by restaurant.  There was adult supervision at the school, but our meeting ran a bit late.  A parent that had a teenage son taking class that night asked me if I wanted her son to bring my kids over to the restaurant...I said why not.  What I did not realize was that I had not told my kids that it was O.K. for them to get a ride from young man, who we know, train with, and play with almost every day.

Well, as it turns out, my kids also taught me a lesson as well.  The teenager had a problem getting my kids into his car.  ""MOM...they won't get into the car..,"" he said as he called his mom back not knowing what to do.  I was proud of both of my kids for doing the right thing.  Even if they knew him, they realized that they only,""kind of know him,"" as the video puts it.

This video is a great tool to keep your little ones safe.  This is especially so if you reinforce it over and over.

I highly recommend it for all Daycare Centers, Pre & Elementary Schools.  It is so much more than just saying ""stranger danger"".  It lets you know that, although everyone is not a ""don't know"", there are also ""kinda knows"".

Not only does it offer guidance but helps begin that difficult discuss of safety in today's world.

2300189,4,B0009LS9Y4,"Thanks for making this wonderful video which delivers an important message in a humerous non threatening manner.
I do feel the production is almost too fast and wordy at times. As a 43 year old mother of a five year old I had trouble keeping track of the  various rules regarding the different types of strangers. I wonder if a youngster could be so busy trying to remember what the video said to do or not do that a child does not listen to that instinctive gut feeling that signals something is not right in a potentially harmful situation with an adult.

I remember as an 11 year old in the 1970's visiting my grandparents in Florida. I developed a semi crush on the 20 something son of neighboring retiree's. He had long hair and looked like a mixture of David Cassidy  and Jimmy Page. My ideal male at the time,(I still like that look),yet when he got me alone and asked me to meet him somewhere remote later that day the hair on the back of my neck actually stood up like you read in books and I clearly and forcefully said,""No Way.""I wonder if I had seen the video if I would have been so busy trying to label him as a,"" don't know,"" or a,""kinda know."" that I would not have listened to my instincts. Of course a relatively sophisticated 11 year old is different than a toddler or young school age child who probably have not  fully developed certain instincts yet.

My only reccomendation is a slightly slower paced less stimulating video for younger children or children with processing delays .

2300192,4,B0009LS9Y4,"I purchased this video after reading all the excellent reviews of it.  Overall, I agree that the content is good and it is one of the few videos even available that cover this difficult topic, so for that alone it deserves 4 stars.  It provides a very good foundation for me to expand on the topic in coversations afterward.  However I feel there are a few things they could have done to make this even better:

1) It does a good job of tackling a tough topic without being frightening, but the pace is a little too fast and it is almost too silly at times, at least for the younger crowd (my kids are 3 and 4).  My kids seemed to pick up too much on the goofiness instead of the message (my son would start running around doing karate kicks after that segment).  It just means it may take several viewings and more explanation from parents for the message to really sink in.

2) I think the video stops short of covering everything necessary to make it a 5-star video for me - specifically what to do when your child gets into an uncomfortable situation with a ""sorta know"".  It does a great job of explaining how to AVOID these situations (not getting into a car with your coach, not keeping secrets with your dad's buddy, etc.) however I wish it had taken it a step further and said what to do if he/she should find him/herself in an uncomfortable situation despite precautions.  For instance, explain there are parts of the body that are never OK to be touched, that secrets regarding these areas are never OK, and that they should trust their instincts and if it feels wrong, say no and tell your safe-side adult.

If that type of information is important to you, don't expect to get it from this video.  Once again it is a great starting off point, but I recommend supplementing this video with books such as ""Your Body Belongs to You"" or ""The Right Touch"" (for the younger kids).",1156464000,31,1886,4.406340057636887

It reinforced everything I had already said to him and more.  I titled this review 'finally' because finally there is a video out there that talks about the dangers of people you KIND OF KNOW and not just STRANGERS because we as parents know that sometimes teachers, coaches, friends' parents, etc. have been known to do things to kids, and kids need to know when a certain situation is not appropriate for a kid and an adult which this DVD teaches.  John Walsh the guy off of America's Most Wanted helped make this dvd and that was something I didn't know until I watched it.  That made it even better in my opinion because of what happened with his son.  This is a great DVD.  It puts things in kids terms that they can understand.  Like I said previously, for an adult it will be very corny, but the message is WONDERFUL!  I also have a 3 year old and he wasn't interested, but he also isn't in the same kind of situations a school age kid would be in as far as being around other adults.  He stays by me, but this dvd will be there for him when he is a little older and in those type of situations. Please buy this DVD!  This could save your child's life!

My 7yo son not only learned but enjoyed this film, we would stop the movie and discuss points and he would easily be able to explain what were always kind of abstract concepts i.e. strangers vs. ""kinda knows"" and respecting authority vs. appropriate adult behavior.

My kids now understand not to open the door by themselves when the doorbell rings, something they have done in the past before they saw the video! I think it was my own issue that I found it difficult to explain to my kids that adults can hurt them. This video does that for me very well. I hate the fact that we have no choice but to quash our children's innocence and trust of others, but I definitely understand the need for the lessons taught in this video.

I have given this as a gift several times because I think the concept is excellent and there is nothing else I am aware of that parents can use to help us keep our kids safe.

2300207,2,B0009LS9Y4,I was expecting to get an informational video that would teach my child how to deal with dangerous situations with strangers.  I think the film does some of that but I feel there is just too much goofiness going on that detracts from the serious subject.  I would have preferred to see more situations that would teach my child what to do if a certain person comes up to them.  There were quite a few of these in the film but then they seemed to more like asides rather than the main purpose of the film.  One example of this is a tiny dog that is used as an example not to pet because you do not know how the dog will react - this is used as some form of analogy to not speak to strangers because you do not know what they might do.  Then quite suddenly the dog is just enlarged dramatically but it is still the same innocuous looking dog.  It just did not make sense to me and I am not sure if my child who loves animals got the drift either.  Anyways I think the film is okay and it does help - something is better than nothing I suppose.,1152921600,3,1041,4.024271844660194

This child-friendly movie was the ticket!  We watched it together the first time so I could reinforce important points and answer questions.  I'm very surprised at how much of the info he has retained.  No doubt it's due to the creators' approach to the subject.

2300211,5,B0009LS9Y4,"I got the movie for my 2 year old and 3.5 year old and they love it.  So do I.  They call it the 'Gorilla Movie' because gorillas show up throughout the movie.  A great way to draw their interest and the novelty has not worn off.

I wondered if my kids were actually learning anything and the answer is a definite yes!  My 3.5 year old can define and name her Safe Side adults.  When we're driving home from school she points out kids who don't have a safe side adult with them.  She is getting used to the terminology for ""kind a knows"" and ""Don't knows"" and we make it a game when we're out figure out who fits into which category.  The safety message is beyond my 2 year old but he loves the movie and will eventually pick up onthe message.

Safe Side Super Chick is very engaging and enjoyable to watch. There is humor throughout for kids and adults.  This is a 'fun' movie to watch.  Kudos to the creators for coming up with a way to handle a tough topic in a nonscary, matter-of-fact, easy to understand way.

The film is based on a 3 color theme (green (safe), yellow(caution) and red (danger)) and the 3 phrases to describe other people, (safe side adult, kinda know, and don't know).  The themes repeat throughout the numerous examples which show different situations children may find themselves in, how to handle each situation and/or how to avoid it altogether.

The DVD comes with the same safe side badges used throughout the movie.

My kids also love the music video on the DVD.

For the reviewer who had sound/volume problems. It must have been your DVD.  There is one scene in the movie where Safe Side Super Chick is ignoring the doorbell which keeps getting louder and louder until it drowns her out but that was on purpose and the only time there was a sound issue.

I would highly recommend a copy of this movie for any adults (grandparents for example) who spend time with or may watch your children so all the adults can use the same terminology and ideas.",1152316800,2,1979,4.3901098901098905
2300212,5,B0009LS9Y4,"Another tour de force film from Austrian auteur Hans Zeilinger (""Wie F'r Eine Aktive,"" ""Tragf'higen!""), this is an absolute aesthetic delight.

Zeilinger paints--with shadows and light--a cinematic landscape that is stark, melancholy, and yet hides a deeper warmth behind every image and every character. Using the camera lens as the ""eye of God,"" Zeilinger focuses on the absurd in a way that only members of the Austrian filmmaking community seem to have adopted. It is a Dogma 95 for the new age!

""The Safe Side - Stranger Safety"" is both a morality play and a frightening glimpse of the world we may someday be facing. The ""Stranger"" in Zeilinger's world not only offers candy to children metaphorically, but quite literally too, in a disturbing montage that is reminiscent of his earliest films.

While this may not be Zeilinger's best work, it certainly sees the filmmaker back in top form, and his brilliant cautionary tale has the perfect blend of gripping action, haunting melodies, despair, and fart jokes.

Kudos, Hans! Kudos!",1152230400,,1038,5.088235294117647

Now when we go out somewhere, she will point out ""don't knows"" and ""kinda knows"" and will tell me what she would do in different situtations.

But, after having the children watch the video several times in the car (where they have total focus and concentration), I found I didn't need to install fear of potential ""bad guys"" in them but have them learn to DISTINGUISH between ""safe"", ""kinda known"" people, and ""people we don't know"" .. and i saw the results immediately.  She then proceeded to point out the difference in people we ran into in a regular day, and would ask what category the people fell in if she wasn't sure.

The reputation of the two developers of this video goes without needing ellaboration, but I think they did an expected fantastic job.

The only slight drawback is I thought it was a tad ""silly"" but now see the point can be gotten across without having to brainwash your children into being super-careful kids, but kids that can be ""on the safe side""....

The only real issue has to do with the post production.  The dialogue sound is way too low.  So you have to turn up the volume only to get blasted by the effects.  Not good when little ones are trying to learn.

Annoyingly, the DVD intro can't be bypassed (we play this a lot, give us a break) and the menus can't be accessed during movie playing.

I am SO GLAD I bought this movie.  It is NOT scary, which was important to me.  It gets the message across without scaring the kids.  My 4 year old has really started to grasp the topic, and knows who his ""Safe-side adults"" are, and even tells me ""She is really nice, but she's still just a ""Kinda-know"", huh mom?!""  My 2 year old is too young to grasp the concept, but still really enjoys watching it, and she will start to understand over time.

We havn't really noticed the sound changes, we just love the movie, and since I wasn't expecting much from the quality, I was pleasently supprised at how well put-together I though this movie is.

When used with parent-child descussions & teaching, this movie is one of the best resources I've found that addresses the safety and street-smarts of out children.  It should be a part of EVERY family video library.

My husband and I asked him questions and he still didn't understand it too well.  The movie is based on 3 situations, green, yellow and red.  Green is safe, yellow is kind of safe and red is not safe.  Examples of situations are shown.  There are 3 types of people, safe side adults (people you can go with like mom and dad), kinda knows like teachers (not go with without your safe side adult's permission) and don't knows which are complete strangers (run and yell and tell an adult).  These types of people are shown in different situations.  Good guidelines but could be hard for a child to understand.  I think this movie is more appropriate for a child around age 7 or 8 and over.  Before that age, just stick to telling your child don't talk to strangers.",1143331200,,917,4.329411764705882

I had my 3 1/2 year old son run away from me at McDonalds, so I brought him back to the play area and asked him if he had his safe side adult with him and he said ""no"", then I asked him if he was grabbed by someone in McDonalds would they be a ""don't know"" and he said ""yes"", then I said what would you do? He then SCREAMED at the top of his lungs, ""YOU ARE NOT MY MOM, YOU ARE NOT MY DAD!"".

He is an extremely friendly and outgoing little boy so I have constantly struggled with how to explain these safety issues to him without taking away from his personality. Yes this video is goofy. Yes, when I first watched it I thought ""Oh my gosh, how corny"". But the facts are 1) this video is made for KIDS not ADULTS and kids actually like corny stuff! And 2) Your kids will get the message that Safety Chick is trying to get through to them...even with all the crazy sound effect and goofy gags. That is the most important part. My son was quite distracted the first time we watched it. He kept getting up and walking off. I was so afraid he wasn't listening but then later on in the day he started talking about ""Super Chick"" and asking me questions about what he had seen. Bingo! He was listening after all! We watched the film again this morning and we will probably watch it at least once a week so that all the tips sink in and he is able to react instinctively if (heaven forbid) he is  actually ever approached by someone wanting to harm him. The points made in this DVD are excellent and I love that the whole theme of the film is to empower kids. It makes them feel like they aren't helpless. They can take charge of the situation to keep theirselves safe. My son loved practicing screaming ""THIS IS NOT MY MOM!! THIS IS NOT MY DAD!!"" He even through in an extra ""THIS IS NOT MY BROTHER!"" just for practice! :)

Unfortuantely, I do have to agree with the quality of the DVD. The sound effects are very loud and they do sometimes drown out what Super Chick is saying. I don't mind all the sound effects because I think they do help hold the kids attention but they just don't seem to be proportionate (sound wise) to the dialoge.

These same ""tough"" boys were so disappointed to find that I was just kidding - they really wanted to watch the movie again!

My son has asked to watch it several times at home.  I heard another boy ask his dad to buy it on his way out the door.

Both of my children are, if not relieved, then grateful to know their ""Safe Side Adults"".

While there are some moments on the DVD that are very silly and over children's heads (a Greg Brady/Johnny Bravo scene, for instance...I assume they put that in there to entertain parents?), the overall message is a very good one.  My daughter really likes it and understood the differences between a ""don't know"", a ""kinda know"" and a safe person right away.

The Safe Side has got ALL my kids - even my ""no fear"" kid - using the catch phrases and reminding us of the safety rules. It is the best tool for Kid Safety I have seen! Now we go to the park or walk into a restaurant and the kids are quietly discussing the ""Don't Knows"" and the ""Kinda Knows"".

He has watched it at least 50 times in the first week we have owned it. This video is entertaining, and ""Safe Side Super Chick"" is very funny but full of great information. I wasn't sure how much my son was picking up; I thought maybe some of it would get embedded in his brain through constant watching and laughing. I was pleasantly surprised when a solicitor came to the door, and my son, who usually rushes to the door, stopped and waited for me! And when I opened the door and spoke to the person through the storm door, my son yelled, ""I don't know you!"" from behind my legs! We've had some great discussions since we got this DVD, and I intend to show it to my daughter's 4th grade girl scout troop.

However, last week, while he was out for a walk with the babysitter (and of course running ahead of her!), a car pulled up to ask for directions.  My son immediately ran back to the babysitter.  After the car pulled away, he said ""you are my safe side adult, right?""  I was impressed that, because of the repetition of the tape, he immediately did the right thing, something that all of our ""little talks"" about safety had not accomplished!

There is no Video or book that will take the place of a parents supervision and teaching...

I feel it is worth it to take every offer of help I can get on helping to keep my children and your safe.

Yes this is a corny video... My 2 boys still ask to watch it from time to time and they rememner what to do and what a stanger is when asked I just pray they remember if they ever are put in a bad situation...

I have all of Julie Clarks Baby E vids and feel that they helped both my children learn and get ahead of their age levels.

They did a fantastic job to make a serious subject fun and attention grabbing for kids. My four year old son and I watched it together and this video had his undivided attention, which is difficult for him to do because he usually sits for a second and then he's off. I do have to agree with some of the reviews about the sound, some parts seemed louder than others, however, I think adjusting the volume a few times throughout the video is a small price to pay considering the alternative of not informing your child of today's world.

The main character, SafeSide SuperChick, is played by a charming actress named Angela Shelton who has shared her own story of child abuse in a documentary called ""Searching for Angela Shelton.""  Her story in this documentary and her concern for kids, enough to be in the SafeSide DVD, fill me with admiration for her.

If you have kids, you MUST get this DVD.  It explains all of the safety concepts that can be intimidating and downright scary to explain to kids.  This DVD does it in a fun, easy-to-remember, and entertaining way.  Buy it!  Your kids are worth it.",1135728000,5,719,4.469230769230769

We are big fans of Julie Clark's Einstein series and respect John Walsh's work as well. I was looking forward to lots of sample situations that would help my daughter to envision the reality of dangerous situations. While the DVD did offer some samples, we found the loud and fast format distracting. We felt it compromised the content. Plus, like another reviewer pointed out, there were some sound-quality issues. The DVD fluctuates from loud to soft and you have to keep adjusting the volume. This was very surprising given the quality of the Einstein products. The DVD was designed to be contemporary and humorous but we felt it was too flashy and overstimulating. While it was a bit disapointing, it was good for our daughter to see that she shouldn't answer the door without her safe adult around and that she should be aware of the ""don't knows"" who are approaching her personal space (Personal space was a concept we hadn't discussed with her). Additionally, it was helpful that the ""don't know"" who needed help finding a kitty was an affable woman who challenged the stereotype of what children see as a dangerous stranger.",1135555200,17,1227,4.738317757009346

My 4 year old daughter is a little social butterfly and while I'm thrilled at her self-assurance and the ease in which she makes friends, it horrifies me to think that a preditor could take advantage of her open and friendly nature.

We got this as an early Christmas present and have already watched it together several times. She is beginning to understand the difference between ""safe side adults"", ""kinda-knows"" and ""don't-knows""-things I have tried to explain to her before, but this format makes it much easier to comprehend. Now when we are out in public, I can see her little brain working, trying to decide who is safe to talk to and who isn't. And parents, take heart: it's not obnoxious! Your children will undoubtedly want to watch it over and over again, so it's nice to have something you won't want to throw in the fire.

I loved this DVD so much, I've ordered one for my nephews and one for my daughter's preschool. Kudos to John Walsh and Julie Clark. Their efforts will help save many children and may even allow them to stay children a little bit longer.

Well, in reality, it was, but that ended up being almost better that way.  My child got a chance to hear it all again from somebody else and therefore validating what I had been saying.  We had already practiced yelling ""this isn't my mom/dad"" but watching Safe Side Super Chick tell us to do the same thing was wonderful reinforcement.  It's great to discuss these things, and great to act them out, but watching it being done added another element.

The Safe Side Super Chick is funny and silly, but never overboard so that it detracted from the seriousness of the subject.  We laughed a little while watching this, which served to diffuse the scariness.  I think that the way people are categorized as ""safe side adults"", ""don't knows"", or ""kinda knows"" is an excellent guideline for children to use to make good decisions.  The ""kinda knows"" seems to be the hardest category of people to explain to children, and often it made me feel like the paranoid mom to be saying ""Yes, our neighbor is nice to say Hi to, but do we REALLY know them?""  This dvd did an excellent job of going over those ""kinda knows"", such as your coach, your dad's friend, your neighbor, the person you regularly see at the store, and it never once sounded paranoid!

The only drawback to this series is that I wish it (or a subsequent title) would have addressed the subject of trusting your instincts and getting away from situations that ""feel"" wrong.  Also, a little more in the way of sample situations would have helped.  But overall, this is an excellent program.",1132185600,38,1676,4.587248322147651
2300293,5,B0009LS9Y4,"My kids love this DVD.  My 7.5 year old enjoyed it and it reenforced things she had already been taught.  My 4 year old LOVES it and likes practicing yelling ""Help! That's not my Mom/Dad!""  It also gave me ideas of how to phrase things for her that she can relate to the show.  The fact they actually love it and watch it over and over is half the battle.  It also gives clear, concise, non-threatening instructions that they understand and can follow.",1132099200,3,452,4.397590361445783

2300295,5,B0009LS9Y4,This video is exceptionally well done and totally geared towards children. My kids loved it and wanted to watch it over and over - laughed out loud at several spots when appopriate. It was exactly what I expected from such a great team like John Walsh and Julie Clark. I recommend every child see this video to learn about safety!!,1128297600,,331,4.533333333333333
2300296,5,B0009LS9Y4,"My 4yr old grandson really likes this video.  He even asks to watch it.  We ask him who his safe-side adults are quite often and he remembers.  At his age it's the reminders that will keep him on his toes and hopefully he'll remember what the video taught him when, and if, it's ever necessary.",1128038400,2,294,4.3090909090909095
2300297,5,B0009LS9Y4,"I bought this video mainly for my fearless 7 year old who has never met a stranger - everyone is a friend in her eyes. I have 2 girls - 7 and 4. This movie is enjoyable and educational - something that the whole family can watch, laugh at, and learn from. Safe Side Superchick categorizes people into 3 groups - for example, mom and dad are on your safe side, strangers are ""don't knows"" and coaches and neighbors are ""kinda knows"". For most, the term stranger takes on the connotation of some leering mean-looking guy. I've been struggling with a different term to use and they coined it perfectly! ""Don't knows"" are simply people you don't know. They are people you want to stay away from because as Safe Side Superchick says ""they may hurt you"". There are no over the top scare tactics - just hilarious skits that teach amazing lessons that kids will learn from.

Skit: Just because you are a black belt in karate doesn't mean you can take down a don't know!

Skit: Don't tell anyone your name unless your safe side buddy is with you and says it's ok.

Skit: Don't answer the door unless your safe side buddy is right next to you.

Skit: If you are lost, find a store employee or a woman with kids to help you.

Skit: Don't let a don't know into your safety circle.

Skit: If a don't know asks you for help run! (can you help me find my kitten?)

Skit: If a don't know tries to take you yell ""you aren't my mom!"" or ""you aren't my dad!""

There are so many other great skits - these were the ones I could remember off the top of my head.

This is such a wonderful resource and should be mandatory watching in every school and service group - brownies, boy scouts, etc. Do yourself and your family a favor and get this video!",1127779200,4,1726,4.253822629969419
2300298,5,B0009LS9Y4,"This video is great because it teaches very important lessons in fun and non threatening ways.  It has catchy tunes that my son and I sing together and encourages participation.  If a child loves a video he will watch it over and over, much to many parents irritation.  This video however, is one that you want your child to watch over and over and remember well and Safe Side does just that.  We love Safe Side Super Chick!",1127606400,,424,4.397435897435898
2300299,5,B0009LS9Y4,"I bought this DVD for my own family and for my child's preschool.  It is excellent.  It educates children about potential problems in a non-threatening way.  The school used it during ""Safety Week"" and it got great reviews.  After watching this two times, my child could identify ""don't knows and kinda knows"" from safe-side adults.  This could literally save a child's life.",1127606400,2,375,4.983870967741935
2300300,5,B0009LS9Y4,"My 4-1/2 year old daughter, my husband, and I watched this video together the first time.  It is excellent in how it breaks down what a stranger is and isn't in a fun way with a gripping delivery for the children.  The actress who plays the SAFE-SIDE SUPERCHICK is quite endearing.

I knew when it was produced by Julie Aigner-Clark of the 'Baby Einstein' fame, and John Walsh of 'America's Most Wanted' that it would be high quality.  Except for the fact that the volume was not consistent throughout (hence having to lower and raise the volume control), it does not disappoint in any way.  I was really impressed with the topics that were brought out into the open (such as personal space, someone asking their name, etc...) and the actual examples to take the abstract concept and make it concrete for children.

This video has the ability to get the point across, especially in the 'gray' area of strangers about people our children know, such as a teacher, coach, neighbor, but are not on their SAFE-SIDE ADULT list (they are called KINDA KNOWS).  The obvious stranger is the DON'T KNOW, and then those adults who are entrusted by us to pick up our child from school, etc., are SAFE SIDE ADULTS.

Each of these types of adults are hilarously described by the SAFE-SIDE SUPERCHICK who wears GREEN when it is safe, YELLOW when one needs to be cautious, and RED when it is Not safe.  It is entertaining and brings home good points without scaring the children.

Being an educator, child-care provider, and mom, I have first-hand awareness of the dangers and harm that befall our little ones.  My greatest concern in this day and age is for my daughter to be protected from harm and to be safe from any predators.  She has taken a couple of self-defense classes, which teach what to do if grabbed, but interestingly, the concepts about safety in the class and this video are amazingly similar.

I consider this an investment in my daughter's safety, along helpful hints for children and parents alike.  I am excited to add this to our DVD collection, and it will definitely be a birthday present for some of her friends!",1127520000,,2121,4.651474530831099
2300301,5,B0009LS9Y4,My daughter absolutely loved it. So did all the neighbor kids with ages ranging from 6 to 15. There was immediate discussions of safety adults and wide variety of other important safety issues.-- Highly recommended.,1127433600,2,215,5.171428571428572
2300302,5,B0009LS9Y4,"This was excellent.  At first I thought it was kind of loud and hyper, but that turned out to be a good thing because it held my son's interest.  It doesn't just cover stranger safety, it also gives tips for how to deal with all those ""kinda knows"" -- people like coaches, teachers, parents' friends, etc.  Since most abusers are known to children, this was an important feature.

Now I'm hoping they'll do one for older kids on internet safety!",1127260800,2,445,4.525
2300303,5,B0009LS9Y4,"First the bad news.... this DVD has some sound issues.  Sometimes Super Safe Chick is speaking but the instrumental music is drowning her out.  We found ourselves constantly raising and lowering the volume since things are happening so fast in the movie.  It may just be a defect in our particular DVD.... we will check into it.

Now the good news! This is an EXCELLENT movie to teach kids about protecting themselves from strangers.  Super Safe Chick (SSC)is VERY VERY funny!  My dd actually wants to dress up as her for Halloween. So many clever things in this dvd..like when SSC is in certain situations she wears clothing that is either Green (in safe situations), Amber (in cautious ones) and Red (in danger type situations).  She teaches the kids about the 3 types of people in their lives (""Safe Side Adults"" - mom, dad, and others whom mom and dad have given their trust,  ""Kinda Knows"" - family friends, neighbors, coaches, teachers,  and ""Don't Knows"" - anyone not in the other 2 categories)

The movie shows certain situations - ie standing in line at the ice cream truck - SSC is in her red outfit,  hanging at home she is in her green outfit until the doorbell rings... her outfit turns red and she is upset because she knows she shouldn't answer the door without her Safe Side Adult present.  The doorbell keeps ringing and getting louder and she gets louder herself saying ""Some people hate hearing the doorbell ring and they want to answer it - but I won't!  My Safe Side Adult is not here""...then her mom appears and they open the door together and she is back in her green outfit. VERY CLEVER!!!

She practices with the kids yelling ""This is not my Mom, This is not my Dad"" - so of course my kids were shouting it for about 30 minutes at the top of their lungs.  But it opened up a wonderful discussion.  We made our list of Safe Side Adults and people who fell into the other category.  The movie is VERY quick - things happen quickly so while my 3 yr old LOVED watching it....she got minimal out of it except what to yell and not to open the door or follow people looking for animals.  But my 9 year old asked us questions for about an hour afterwards.  I would think children ages 5-12 would get the most out of it.  But adults will find it perfect for opening conversations - and very funny even though a very serious topic.",1126569600,151,2346,4.436915887850467
2300304,5,B0009LS9Y4,"This video is a must have for kids and parents.  Any child that that has the ability to open any outside doors to their home should watch this video.  The safety tips are great and they get the message across in such a way that it does not scare or alarm.  In fact, the video is extremely funny.  I even enjoy watching it and have learned as much as my daughter about stranger safety.  This video could not have been done any better.  My 4 year frequently requests to watch it over and over again.  I'm going to give the video as a gift to all of my daughter's friends (and family too).

This is the best! All adults go into 3 categories - Safe Side Adults, Kinda Knows and Don't Knows. I have always been looking for a way to explain that you can't trust people you do know like the coach, neighbors, mom and dad's boss, etc. This DVD explains the Kinda Knows very well with great role playing! Supersafe Chick does a great job being silly, but explains the information very clearly. The end of the movie tells the kids to write down a list of Super Safe Adults with mom and dad.

My 4 year old daughter has watched it at least 20 times in the last 3 or 4 days, and walks around quoting the movie ""Help, this is not my mom, help, this is not my dad"", which is what it teaches should a stranger attempt to lure your child away.  In the past I've tried explaining strangers to her and why we don't leave with one, etc., but she never got it.  This video did the trick somehow!  I have no doubt this video will ultimately save a childs life out there.  I would not let the day go by without ordering this for your little one.  It may save their life.  I also recommend buying a copy for your childs daycare or school.  THANK YOU Julie Clark and John Walsh.",1124668800,10,822,4.030864197530864
