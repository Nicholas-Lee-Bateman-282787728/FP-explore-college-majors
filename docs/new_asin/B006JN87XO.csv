Don't give Turner/CN a reason to try and milk fans for the most cash they can. This is worse than unicorns. This show is so awesome, like an animated Big Lebowski in episodic shenanigans.

4994624,3,B006JN87XO,"I will not give this a one-star review, simply because I love the show too much, but this collection is simply ridiculous.
This DVD has 12 episodes on it. The entire season one has 12 episodes as well.
So, why isn't this a full-season set, which would not require CN, Warner Home Video, or Tuner to put in ANY extra effort whatsoever and would make fans much more happy and be less confusing to the casual consumer?
Simple. They want you to rebuy the episodes again when they do eventually come out with one. I've already bought all of these episodes through iTunes, I've pre-ordered this DVD, and I'm going to buy them again when they come out as a season set. I'm doing it because I love the show, and I would rather speak with my dollars and tell them I want more RS releases than hold out and get nothing.
Still, it's very silly that we have to put up with this crap. Makes me wish so hard that Shout Factory had a deal with CN. They've done fantastically at releasing Nicktoons and MST3K, but as long as Warner Home Video exists (the rest of time) this will never happen.

The humor in the early shows is such that adults will greatly enjoy, while the sci-fi incursions into the Seinfeld-type plots are sure to keep the kiddies tuned in, whether 4 or 14. I love watching this show with my teenaged girls and my four-year-old son.

4994658,5,B006JN87XO,"What is going on here? I just read the top one-star review with comments and I am amused and bewildered by the immaturity. What is the deal with twentysomethings being so uptight that random episodes are included on one DVD? I mean, isn't that how seasonal episodes are aired on Cartoon Network anyway after their premiere? In other words, watching this DVD is just like watching ""Regular Show"" non-chronological/out-of-order reruns, which I would think that a total ""RS"" nut would enjoy just fine. Listen, if you don't have OCD, do have kids, and don't have cable, this DVD is just fine. My kids (9 and 5) love it and are actually creeped out by some episodes which is the reaction that I and the creators want, and I love it so much that I actually loiter in my own living room, flashing in my mind to significant and insignificant memories of my youth that are triggered by cultural references to the past. Good price here- we paid a bit more, and it is totally worth it. Here's the episodes:

1. The Power
2. Just Set Up the Chairs
3. Death Punchies
4. Grilled Cheese Deluxe
5. Mordecai and the Rigbys
6. Rage Against the TV
7. This is My Jam
8. The Night Owl
9. Over the Top
10. Prank Callers
11. Brain Erasers
12. A Bunch of Baby Ducks

Duggy: The Regular Show is,simply put,the best cartoon I've seen in a long while.

This gets them into plenty of trouble with their boss Benson and also into other,more outrageous and surrealistic trouble. The Regular Show is not a kids cartoon.

4994694,3,B006JN87XO,"This is my first review that Ive left on Amazon.  Let me first say that I don't mind that the DVD is not a complete season. I think its a great mix of episodes.  For the price, I cant complain, except for one thing.

There apparently is a manufacturing error with this DVD.  I got my first one on Tuesday and was playing it in my XBOX 360.  When I got to Rage Against the TV is started fine, but at around the 3 minute mark the picture will freeze and the XBOX 360 will say it cant read the disc.  Ok, so maybe it was my 360.  I tried it on my sons, same thing.  I then tried it on my daughters, same thing.  Finally, I tried it at my friends house and same thing.  All other DVDs that we have work fine in our XBOX 360s. If I play the movie on my computer or my PS3 it will work fine.  I tried it on two standalone DVD players, one worked and the other didnt.

So I got a replacement from Amazon.  The replacement came super fast and that was appreciated.  I just tried the DVD and the exact same problem happens at the exact same spot. I don't want to get a refund because I want the DVD, but I really hope this is addressed in the future.

So warning, if you watch DVDs on a XBOX 360, there is a very good chance that the Rage Against the TV episode will not work properly.",1333670400,6,1276,3.891472868217054
4994695,3,B006JN87XO,"They say that ""Regular Show"" ""is anything but"".  If you've seen at least a few episodes of this rather unusual series, you'd understand why.  This Cartoon Network series centers around two best buddies: Rigby, a street-smart raccoon, and Mordecai, a 6-foot blue jay.  They work as groundskeepers at a local park where they prefer to hang out unless they're being pushed around by their boss Benson (a hot-headed candy dispenser ?!).  With other characters like Pops, Skips, Margaret, Muscle Man and High-Five Ghost, this cartoon can start out typical, until it goes off the wall.  Twelve episodes are randomly chosen from the the first two seasons including:

""The Power"" - The two friends come across a magic synthesizer and it grants them their wildest wishes, until they accidentally send Skips to the moon.

""Grilled Cheese Deluxe"" - Seeing that astronauts get cutsies in the line for a grilled cheese sandwich restaurant, the duo fib that they're astronauts, too.  Then the trouble starts as they go out on a real mission in space.

""Mordecai and the Rigbys"" - Our crazy pair attempt to perform a song at open mic night, and what better way to get some advice is from their future selves !

""Brain Eraser"" - After seeing Pops au naturel, a mortified Mordecai desperately tries to get rid of the image in his head by the use of a bizarre video tape.

A special feature is an animated short entitled ""Rah-Ha Ringtone"" where the guys try to pitch a hit song they just came up with.  Funny that short became an actual ringtone that you can download off of the Cartoon Network website.

So if you like a cartoon that is seemingly average, go see this series.  Plus, new episodes are still airing on Cartoon Network weekly.  ""YEEEEAUUUUHHH !!!!""",1333497600,2,1744,4.766666666666667
4994696,4,B006JN87XO,this is all right but it would be way better if this show had whole season releases. I'd buy those in a heartbeat.,1333497600,,114,4.0
4994697,3,B006JN87XO,"Hopefully if you're reading this, you're familiar with the greatness that is ""Regular Show."" If you're not, then I'll do my best to introduce it to you. ""Regular Show"" is a cartoon on Cartoon Network that airs on Monday nights at 8:15/7:15c. It follows Mordecai and Rigby, a blue jay and a raccoon who are both 23-years-old, and the endless amount of hijinks they get into in and around the park they work at. The great thing is that the show is much more adult oriented than it may appear. Think ""Rocko's Modern Life"" or the first season of ""Ren & Stimpy."" There are countless references to movies (The Karate Kid, Over the Top, Logan's Run), video games (Pac-Man), TV shows (""Power Rangers""), and music (Rage Against the Machine and its repetitive use of 80s music) and mature language (""How the H are we going to fix this S?"" and the word ""crap"" being said so often) that are bound to go over the heads of a younger audience. It's like one of the best instances of a wolf in sheep's clothing except this time you're rooting for the wolf.

Regular Show: The Slack Pack DVD has the exact same format as the Adventure Time: My Two Favorite People DVD; 12 episodes along with one special feature. While it is incredibly disappointing that a full season of ""Regular Show"" hasn't yet been released (in due time, hopefully), let's enjoy what we do have at our disposal and see what The Slack Pack has to offer.

One of the things I noticed while watching the Adventure Time: My Two Favorite People DVD is that the episodes were really glitchy at times. It tends to only affect the video, but it occurred on several different episodes spread throughout the DVD. On Regular Show: The Slack Pack DVD, it happens right in the very first episode on at least three separate occasions. It's as if part of the bottom of the frame of the previous scene sticks around for the next one. This occurs in at least two of the episodes on the DVD.

Reception hasn't been so hot for the My Two Favorite People and It Came From the Nightosphere ""Adventure Time"" DVDs (mostly because fans grew impatient for a full season release), but the cover art on the case for each disc is pretty outstanding. The lineart is very slick and the detail on the My Two Favorite People case is fairly intricate and extremely appealing to the eye. Regular Show: The Slack Pack case art in comparison is sloppy. The logo and text are pixelated and the artwork seems to be of poor quality. The artwork on the back is the same way. Every line on this case looks like it was drawn in MS Paint. It's pretty atrocious overall.

The set contains six episodes from season one (""The Power,"" ""Just Set Up the Chairs,"" ""Death Punchies,"" ""Grilled Cheese Deluxe,"" ""Prank Callers,"" and ""Mordecai and the Rigbys"") and six from season two (""Rage Against the TV,"" ""Brain Eraser,"" ""This Is My Jam,"" ""Over the Top,"" ""The Night Owl,"" and ""A Bunch of Baby Ducks""). This is kind of an odd choice, especially since season one IS only 12 episodes anyway. Why would you split it up and leave off gems like ""Free Cake"" and ""Rigby's Body""? It's a pretty great introduction to the series, but a disc like this should be made for fans of an existing franchise to begin with. ""A Bunch of Baby Ducks"" is the episode I show to people to try and make them a fan since that's the one that convinced me how fantastic the show really is. So it is nice to see that on the disc.

Regular Show: The Slack Pack is kind of a letdown with its poor artwork and odd episode selection. Its lack of special features doesn't help matters either. Its $9.99 selling price isn't too shabby though and the Rah-Ha Ringtone special feature (which also happens to be my current ringtone) is enjoyable despite being so short. While The Slack Pack does leave a lot to be desired, it's the only thing we've got to enjoy until a proper full season release is announced by Cartoon Network.

One final note: The show itself deserves five stars. The three stars are for the mediocre release. Regular Show: The Slack Pack DVD will be available in retail stores and online shopping outlets starting this Tuesday, April 3rd.",1333238400,2,4120,4.516085790884718

4994699,1,B006JN87XO,"Go away cartoon network. No one likes you anymore. Hell, I can find all the regular show, adventure time and any other show i want online for free..... I find the only reason to buy a cartoon dvd is to get the WHOLE season. Not this hodge podge. Come out with the whole season of shows and people will actually buy them. Even if season 1 and 2 together was like 30-40 dollars I would buy them. Stop being so greedy Turner/Cartoon Network. Otherwise I'll just watch online forever and you won't ever get my money, and from the looks of things, The majority of the fanbase agrees with me. Like you guys don't have enough money or something. You basically have the young adult to adult market monopolized with CN and then Adult swim. Whats you're problem?",1332806400,10,752,4.456521739130435
4994700,2,B006JN87XO,"I have run into too many dvd sets (that aren't an entire season, blu-rays w/ digital copies (that won't play on iTunes) & individual dvds (that the season gets released as an entire set) to be taken for a ride again. There is definitely a reason this is entitled a Slack Pack. They have slacked off again with putting a whole season on the dvd. All the episodes from Season 1 together are shorter than some movies! C'mon Man!

I have all the episodes on iTunes & on my DVR but it would be nice to have a set that I could play in the kids car dvd player. Until they decide to release an entire season at once or the box set or whatever (just as long as it makes consumer sense & not screw consumer sense) I will make due with the episodes on my iPad.
They better not release them on flixster or anything cloudy. I can manage my own cloud after i receive a physical copy",1331078400,10,868,4.105882352941176
4994701,5,B006JN87XO,"I suppose the next cartoon to do the same random collection thing will be ""The Amazing World of Gumball,"" keeping in step with Adventure Time and Regular Show.

Be that as it may, this is probably THE funniest cartoon on TV right now. In 11 minutes they manage to get in slacker humnor and typically bend time and space in each adventure. Watching this, you see the true potential of animation to both entertain and teach. That's the sly thing about this show, it's funny and wierd but has some good morals in it as well.
