1784885,5,B00006LPB4,"In Infernal Serpent, Morse (John Thaw) finds himself dealing with corruption of all forms in high places. Both Morse and Lewis (Kevin Whately) are warned off the case when their investigations ruffle the feathers of some high-ranking people. Luckily, both Morse and Lewis are not averse to carrying on their investigations on the sly, and the deeper they dig, the more disturbing the details that emerge.

The supporting roles are credibly cast here - there's the Oxford master and his wife, a seemingly benign couple with some dark secrets; their daughter who seems emotionally fragile; the young family friend who comes over for a visit but seems to harbor an agenda of her own; and, a young child whose innocence is forever lost. This is another winner in the Morse series. It is slow-going at times, but Morse and Lewis' investigative methods are always meticulous and though the outcome is not quite what either would have expected, let's just say justice is served in the end.

Have enjoyed all of them.  The first time when shown on PBS televsion...and now at my lesiure.... John Thaw was a great actor and is sadly missed. If you enjoy good a mystery with a little humor this is the way to go.  Collect the series of Inspector Morse with his Sargent Lewis.

The Inspector Lewis series is also well done.",1275091200,,383,4.291666666666667
1784888,5,B00006LPB4,"I don't know quite what it is, but watching Morse in action is worth many times what's currently playing in any movie theatre. Morse and Lewis continue to entertain as they go about unraveling murder and mayhem in Oxford, England. I have watched these episodes many times over the years and always marvel at the scenery, script, personalities and fine actors. I bought this particular collection for a relative over the holidays with the hope of passing on the pleasure I have found in watching Morse. They are expensive, comparatively speaking, but worth every penny!",1264723200,5,568,4.989473684210527

1784890,5,B00006LPB4,"What's not to love about Inspector Morse!  He is his own man and is an interesting character study in general.  He does crossword puzzles, likes his 'pints', doesn't suffer fools, neither the pedestrian kind nor the fellow police kind.  His faithful partner Lewis is always at his side, although there are times when Lewis get's aggravated with him, they nonetheless, have a close relationship and Morse depends on him more than he ever admits.

I've seen him age in this wonderful series and was deeply saddened by not only his passing in the final episode of the series, but also his passing in reality!  I will always be a fan of both John Thaw and Inpector Morse.",1238025600,9,667,4.666666666666667
1784891,4,B00006LPB4,"When a highly regarded environmentalist is mugged and then dies of a heart attack, just before he was to speak at Oxford, Morse and Sgt. Lewis enter the case.  Morse, who graduated from Oxford, is comfortable dealing with the dons and, in this case, the Master of one of the colleges.  Master Matthew Copley-Barnes had been on his way to the debate when he witnessed the mugging.  Copley-Barnes is arrogant, cruel to his wife and daughter, and he elicits no sympathy as he runs the college with an iron fist.

Among the many (sometimes gratuitous) complications is the fact that Mick McGovern,  the young man arrested for the mugging/murder has been having a gay relationship with one of the music conductors, who himself is behaving strangely, even with Morse, whom he knows.  Copley-Barnes's daughter Imogen has had more than one breakdown, and she is having one during most of this episode.  Imogen's childhood companion has returned for a visit, staying with the Copley-Barneses, though she heartily dislikes the Master.  Now a journalist, she is doing an investigative story on the Master.  If these complications are not enough to challenge the viewer, there are accusations of child abuse involving at least four people, and evidence that the college is covering up for the environmental disasters (and cancer) associated with a chemical company, a major donor to the college.

Beautifully acted, as always, by John Thaw (Inspector Morse) and Kevin Whately (Sgt. Lewis), the supporting cast is especially memorable for its eccentric mannerisms and odd behavior.  With one exception, none of the characters are likable, and stereotypes abound.  Only Pearce Quigley, playing Mick McGovern, manages to infuse his role with sympathy, becoming one of the few ""round"" characters in the episode.  The music--in this case, primarily choral music--is gorgeous, providing ""heavenly"" contrasts to the tawdry activities of some of the characters, and the photography, as always is outstanding.

One of the more complex Morse mysteries, this one has so many red herrings that it is  often difficult to see where the mystery is going and to identify the true villains.  Late in the episode, another death takes place, and the writers play with the viewer here by suggesting that one person is a killer so they can set up a grand finale and a surprise twist.  Fun to watch, like all the Morse mysteries, this one is less focused than some, filled with inflammatory subplots and a large number of characters so over-the-top that the viewer cares little about them.  n Mary Whipple",1186617600,3,2571,5.066508313539193
1784892,4,B00006LPB4,"Throughout this installment, Mozart piano sonatas, in particular the Turkish K 331, provide the background music. There is a large cast of characters and when we eliminate those who appear for color only, we are still left with several, who all participate in the tale one way or another.  We have two murders, adultery, homosexuality, corporate irregularities and cover ups.  Even Superintendent Rennie, filling in for Chief Superintendent Strange, who is on holiday, is gotten to as he unwittingly suggests Morse should withdraw and go on holiday.  Lewis is obsessed with the first post-mortem, which annoys Morse but yields important results.  It requires serious concentration to follow this intricate plot and you may wish to view it a second time to catch all the details.  The entry is strengthened by the appearance of Geoffrey Palmer in a major role.",1181865600,5,859,5.151079136690647
1784893,4,B00006LPB4,"These are the major passions of the curmudgeonly, stubborn, impulsive Inspector Morse or the Thames Valley PD. Surprising how many killings occur in the stately old town of Oxford! How fortunate we are to have the wonderfully cerebral novels of Colin Dexter to rely on, and his brilliant creation, the sometimes-wrong but always dedicated Morse. It's always interesting to witness the sometimes truculent interaction between the confirmed bachelor Morse and his protege, the married-with-kids, by-the-book Welshman, Lewis. Morse does not suffer fools, and though many have mistaken Lewis for a country bumpkin or naif, he is the stabilizing influence and the voice of reason in the duo. So often Morse leaps to conclusions only to be reined in by the steady Lewis.

There are many fine British detective series: Touch of Frost, Cracker, Wire in the Blood, Midsomer, etc., but Morse is at the top.

One question: I don't own any of the DVD's. They are always too expensive. Why is that? The only time I've ever watched them is when they are on PBS. I keep hoping for the price of a used set on Amazon to get down to maybe $25 US, but they're always twice that. Such a shame.",1154649600,10,1173,4.801980198019802
1784894,5,B00006LPB4,"This story covers a multitude of sins, as it deals with sexual abuse of children, corporate greed, blackmail, and homosexuality among other things.  The plot involves an intersection of issues related to possible environmental hazards, corporate efforts to suppress information regarding those hazards, and the attempts of those who have been victimized by sexual abuse to take revenge against the perpetrator. All these issues surface only after Morse investigates the death of a professor, a death which
ironically is attributed to natural causes (a heart attack).  Morse once more demonstrates the ""thinking man"" approach to detection, reaching conclusions based upon analysis of clues (childhood photographs) which might be overlooked by less sagacious investigators.  The performances are first rate, and the manner in which the story unfolds maintains interest throughout.",1086307200,22,878,5.790697674418604

(ITV used ""series"" instead of ""seasons"".) The last two episodes are the beginning, in the same order, of the ITV Series 5. I think the middle four episodes are some of the best of ""Inspector Morse"" EVER!

[Note: You don't want to confuse the six ""Collection Sets"" with a newer run of ""Inspector Morse"" DVD's, called simply ""Sets"". There are eleven ""Sets"", called ""Inspector Morse Set One"", and so on. Each ""Set"" has only three episodes on three discs.]

The Infernal Serpent - first aired January 1990

THE INFERNAL SERPENT:
A young man is forced into a car. He's protesting he won't do ""it"", but it doesn't look like he has any choice. Later, it's raining hard as people leave a Beaufort College debate late at night. One of them, Dr. Julian Dear, is attacked. His colleague, Headmaster Matthew Copley-Barnes, shows up just in time to see the the apparent assailant's face, we know it's the young man forced into the car. Dr. Dear dies, making it murder, and Morse and Lewis are stumped.

The next day, celebrated journalist Sylvia Maxton arrives at the Headmaster's house. After her father died, when just a girl, she moved in with Blanche and Matthew Copley-Barnes. But something is wrong with this homecoming. She hasn't been in contact for a long 17 years. The air crackles with pent animosity - but why? It's an umbrella and a photograph that help solve the mysteries.

Trivia: This episode was written by Alma Cullen based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. The episode title is from ""Paradise Lost"" by John Milton.

THE SINS OF THE FATHERS:
A man finishes typing a letter in his office. He scrunches up the carbon paper, throwing it away, and then burns another letter in an ashtray. The next we see of him, it's his dead body, found the next day by a worker. Lewis rushes into Morse's office exclaiming, ""You'll never believe this, Sir. We have to visit a brewery!""

They troop over to the Radford Brewery, a proud old name in the brewing business. Charles Radford tells them that his brother, the recently deceased Trevor Radford, had been working late on a ""defense document"". Farmers was bidding to take over the family-held brewery, and Trevor was against it. The police discover that the newly used carbon paper was of a letter dated 1986, four years before. Stranger still, when Morse goes to tell Trevor's wife there's bad news, she looks at him and asks, ""Someone died? Is it Charles?"" Now why would she worry first about Charles instead of Trevor?

This story is a Greek tragedy, told with excellent acting, both understated and in-your-face.

Trivia: This episode was written by Jeremy Burnham based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Using an electric typewriter and carbon paper dates it. But that's the only thing that does, for it's a timeless tale of rotten family dynamics and secrets passed from parent to son.

DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION:
Chief Superintendent Strange (consistently marvelous performances by James Grout) is beside himself. There's been two similar brutal murders, and the police have no leads whatsoever. Now, the viewer knows who the killer is. Sort of. He wears old black leather gloves, drives a stickshift, keeps duct tape in his glove compartment, and plays the Cole Porter songs, ""You Do Something to Me"" and ""Why Can't You Behave"" while stalking his prey. Creepy.

Persistence pays off, though, when Morse and Lewis discover that both women had one thing in common, a car dealership owned by the too-slick Jeremy Boynton. Morse is so sure that Boynton's the murderer, he risks his career on harassing the dealer, and, at one point, Lewis says he just can't follow him there. Boy, this is a great episode.

Trivia: This episode is written by Anthony Minghella based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. In ""The Story of Morse"", a 50 minute documentary special, Kevin Whately says, ""If we'd got on like a house on fire as characters, it would have made it dull and flat.""

MASONIC MYSTERIES:
Morse drives Beryl Newsome to the full dress rehearsal of the Oxford amateur production of ""The Magic Flute"", where they're both in the chorus. Morse wants to get to know her better, but she's sharp with him, saying, ""I've just had enough of men for the moment."" Unfortunately, a fellow thespian, Sandra, is eavesdropping.

After getting in their costumes, Beryl is called away for a phone call. At the same time, the dresser sends Morse back because he's missing his medallion, part of his costume. While Morse is backstage getting his medallion, Beryl is finding out that there's no one on the phone. ""Hello? Hello? Is anyone there?"" You're getting a bad feeling about this.

Sure enough, not only is Beryl stabbed to death while holding the phone, but Morse is the one to find her. In his shock, he actually picks up the knife. Naturally, Sandra is only too happy to tell the police that Morse appeared to be forcing his attentions on Beryl.

To his anger, Morse is pulled off the case and is a suspect. Remember Morse's Law from ""The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn""? There's always a 50/50 chance that the man who found the body, did the deed. Lewis, however, is still on the case, working with Chief Inspector Bottomly. Bottomly talks to a very uncomfortable Lewis, ""Look Lewis... What's his, um, sex life been all these years? And, people do sometimes, suddenly, if they're disgruntled or humiliated, perhaps ... (pregnant pause) He drinks a lot, doesn't he?""

Who is framing Morse? Is it a nemesis from the past? Because soon another person close to Morse is killed.

Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell based on the characters created by Colin Dexter.

SECOND TIME AROUND:
Charlie Hillian is retiring from the Thames Valley CID and writing a book. They give him a big send-off party and Charlie drinks too much. Chief Inspector Patrick Dawson used to be at Thames Valley. He and his wife came from London to see Charlie off into retirement. They take Charlie home after the party, and settle him on the couch before leaving for their hotel.

The next morning, Mrs. Keelan, Charlie's housekeeper, finds Charlie on the floor, dead, a window broken and the desk rifled. Morse and Lewis are on the case, but Dawson begs to be allowed to help, knowing it's not his jurisdiction. What can Morse do but say ""Yes"" - everybody is furious that one of their own, and a popular one at that, was struck down.

It looks like this is not a simple burglary gone wrong. The only thing missing is the chapter of Charlie's book that covered an unsolved murder from years before. There are numerous suspects, and this well-told tale has a surprise and a little heartbreak that I didn't see coming.

Trivia: This episode was written by Daniel Boyle, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. This episode has a lovely small part for Sam Kelly, who plays Walter Majors, Charlie's ghostwriter, with metaphysical rumpledness.

In ""The Story of Morse"", a 50 minute documentary special, John Thaw says this about his character, Morse: ""The puzzle of solving a murder is what sort of drives him on. And when that's gone and he's solved that particular clue, then he's back to reality. And he doesn't like the reality of it. I think that's probably why he drinks. More than most.""

FAT CHANCE:
Back to Oxford college for this episode. Victoria, her arm in a sling, is sitting for her Divinity Examination. She is dressed in a cleric's black robe as a political statement. She is a member of The PAX Group, headed by Hilary Dobson, a group working towards women's ordination in the Church of England. In the middle of her exam, Veronica stands up, obviously unwell, and falls to the floor dead.

She's been poisoned, and the first question for Morse and Lewis is, how was she poisoned? She took communion just before the test, administered by a chaplain and priest virulently opposed to the goals of the PAX Group. The priest, Jeffry, rifled her room while she was at the exam.

But a Morse murder can't be that simple! PAX runs a hostel for young women, where Victoria was counselor to the troubled and overweight Dinah. Dinah has gone into hiding. She had been taking part in the trial of an experimental weight-loss supplement at a local fat farm. Mr. Gold, odious owner of the spa, asks his pet scientist, Hank, ""You say the fat woman's on the loose again?"" Hank: ""Who listens to fat women? Especially when they have no evidence.""

Trivia: ""Fat Chance"" was written by Alma Cullen, based on characters created by Colin Dexter. This episode seems ahead of it's time, with it's commentary on body image.
