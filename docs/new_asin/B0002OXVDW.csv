2111411,5,B0002OXVDW,"When it comes to sheer cinematic joy, nothing can compare to the glorious MGM musicals, and this new Warner boxed set of all three magnificent THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! films is truly the most exciting DVD release of the year.

Each of the THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! films is a special viewing experience, assembled with cleverness, style and panache. They make for irresistable viewing.

As if the great compilations weren't enough, there's a bonus disc with over five hours of extras! Vintage documentaries and TV specials are mixed with some more recent material, and a great assortment of additional outtake musical numbers make for an unbeatable package.

These new DVD transfers are quite spectacular. These films have never looked so great. The quality is astounding, better than ever before on video. The colors jump off the screen at you, and how wonderful to have them enhanced for widescreen on my big 16x9 monitor. The images are spectacular. Obviously with the clips being drawn from over 200 films, some are not as breathtaking as others, but overall I was knocked out. The sound is also very, very impressive.

The glory of Garland, Astaire, Kelly, & Co. live on in this magnificent boxed set.

WARNING: Be prepared to spend several days going through the material which has been meticulously and creatively assembled. You'll love it....and you'll end up watching parts over and over again!

A superb job by Warner Bros. all the way around. Gets my vote for DVD of the year.",1093478400,17,1480,4.995934959349594
2111412,5,B0002OXVDW,"What can you say? A wonderful retrospective of the great MGM musicals.  Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire and many other hosts talk about their lives at MGM in the golden age of Musicals.  I have been waiting years for this one to come out.  Also included are volumes 2 and 3, but the original ""That's Entertainment"" is worth the price of admission.  On a scale of 1-5 this definatly rates a 6.",1093132800,12,388,4.347222222222222
2111413,5,B0002OXVDW,"When Jack Haley, Jr., decided to create the first volume in this documentary franchise, it was a colossal gamble: movie nostalgia wasn't much followed in 1974.  Now, of course, we look about us and see that Haley started something big.  And in this box set all three of the TE documentaries are available for a single reasonable price.  ""You can wait around and hope,"" says Frank Sinatra in one of his introductory spiels, ""but I tell ya, you'll never see the like of this again.""

The same could be said of almost every clip in ""That's Entertainment,"" first of these compilations of MGM musical highlights, ranging from an achingly bad chorus-girl number from the ""Broadway Melody of 1930"" (the first all-sound musical) to numbers from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Singin-in-the-Rain-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00006DEF9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Singin' in the Rain (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and the climactic ballet from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-American-in-Paris-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B001BHI0JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An American in Paris (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.  In between, the movie hits dozens of high spots in the 40-odd-year history of MGM as *the* studio for musicals--and also delivers a few surprises, like Jimmy Stewart and Clark Gable doing turns in the genre (surprisingly, not too shabbily).  Energetic Busby Berkeley ensembles, black-and-white set-pieces from the '30's, a romantic duo by Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, every type of musical number is represented, with narrative material by Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Bing Crosby, Debbie Reynolds, Elizabeth Taylor, Peter Lawford, Mickey Rooney, Jimmy Stewart, Donald O'Connor, Liza Minnelli, and Sinatra.

In Part 2, filmed two years later, the entertainment theme is expanded upon with scenes featuring Clark Gable, the Marx Brothers, Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan, W. C. Fields in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/David-Copperfield-1935/dp/B000GRUQK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">David Copperfield (1935)</a>, Tracy and Hepburn singly and together, the ""Thin Man"" series, and Roddy McDowell in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lassie-Come-Home/dp/B000294U5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lassie Come Home</a>, as well as new introductory scenes filmed in Paris and musical tributes to such great names as Sinatra, Maurice Chevalier, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Band-Wagon-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0007YXPKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Band Wagon (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.  Narration is provided by Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly (the latter still spry enough to hoof lightly at 75), and Kelly gets his wish, as expressed in the first film, that they might dance together again.

Part 3 was released in 1994 as part of MGM's 70th-anniversary celebration and features narration by Gene Kelly (who basically tells the history of musicals from 1929-34), Cyd Charisse (a tribute to Kelly), Debbie Reynolds (the ""glamorous women"" of the studio and the Latin craze of the '40's), Mickey Rooney (on his dear friend Judy Garland), Ann Miller (on Astaire), Esther Williams, June Allyson, and Howard Keel (on the new technologies of the '50's).  While a few of Williams's scenes appeared in the previous two chapters, there are also numerous sequences that were cut from the final prints of movies, including an impressive nighttime number from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Harvey-Girls/dp/B00005Y71M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Harvey Girls</a>&nbsp;and two numbers that were filmed for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie-Get-Your-Gun/dp/B00003CWLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie Get Your Gun</a>&nbsp;with Judy Garland in the role that later became Betty Hutton's.

Besides these, a fourth DVD includes three short documentaries about MGM and its films.  Two of them are basically studio events and not particularly interesting unless you're into celebrity-watching, though the third, ""Behind the Scenes,"" which was filmed for the premiere of Part 3, includes interesting interview material with the movie's narrators, director, editor, and producers, including reminiscences of L. B. Mayer (most of them liked him, except Kelly) and Judy Garland, their experiences at MGM, and how musicals might be done again.  But I think they might just as well have put this material on the disc with the movie itself, omitted the other two shorts entirely, and included&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/That-s-Dancing/dp/B00005JNIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">That's Dancing!</a>&nbsp;in the set instead.  This much being said, however, the movies themselves are great nostalgic fun.  Whether you're an old buff looking to enjoy a few favorites without having to keep changing the video, or a novice wondering what all the fuss was about and what films might best serve as the foundation of your collection, this set should definitely be on your shelf.",1034467200,,5219,6.815315315315315

FILM FACT: The title of the film derives from the anthem song ""That's Entertainment!"" by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz, which was introduced in the 1953 M-G-M musical, The Band Wagon. The title is usually expressed with an exclamation mark, but it is also correct to refer to it without the exclamation mark.  The opening title sequence of Thats Entertainment, Part 2 was designed by Saul Bass, and pays homage to the range and style of title sequences produced between the 1930s and early 1950s.

Thats Entertainment! Cast: Fred Astaire, Bing Crosby, Gene Kelly. Peter Lawford, Liza Minnelli, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, Mickey Rooney, Frank Sinatra, James Stewart, Elizabeth Taylor. Plus you have many other stars appearing, with many clips from M-G-M films.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: The three editions of Thats Entertainment that make up this package constitute the single greatest collection of magical musical moments in the history of the genre. No, its not comprehensive. It represents only impressive numbers from about thirty-five years of M-G-M films, but sadly no Al Jolson, no Ruby Keeler, no Shirley Temple, or Betty Grable, and due to the depth of talent and the seemingly endless archives of available material, some excellent stuff has of necessity been overlooked. As documentaries, the films also have their faults. There are errors in the narration, and some artistic decisions have been made about adjusting some of the images for modern audiences that should make purists blanch. Still, with entertainment the key word, the films all deliver on that notion in spades.

Thats Entertainment! [1974] The documentary that started it all in 1974 deserved every bit of the tremendous success it gleaned. Reminding the world of its past musical glory, M-G-Ms Thats Entertainment picked the most tantalizing morsels from the M-G-M musical basket and presented them in a loving and wondrous showcase hosted by a group of performers all associated with M-G-M in one way or another. Some segments showcased specific performers and the M-G-M big three: Judy Garland, Fred Astaire, and Gene Kelly along with the one-of-a-kind Esther Williams. Others showcased non-singing stars trying to sing or the move to widescreen, stereophonic spectacles. And some sequences were merely a hodgepodge of numbers without much of a unifying theme.

Clearly the standout star of the first Thats Entertainment was Judy Garland. She had two sequences devoted to her gifts and a solo showcase and also a segment devoted to her teen musicals with Mickey Rooney, and also jumped off the screen in excerpts from her black-and-white years Dear Mr. Gable and Singin in the Rain to her Technicolor star vehicles On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe from The Harvey Girls. Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire likewise earned a lions share of the credit for outstanding moments from their careers which were sprinkled throughout the film. And performers that might have been largely forgotten by 1974, but like Eleanor Powell in a sizzling tap-off with Astaire to Begin the Beguine or June Allyson in a couple of numbers, also got their spotlight moments.

Purists have sometimes been bothered by the careful editing jobs done on almost all of the numbers in order to meet time limitations, but I was bothered much more by the tendency to turn Academy ratio films into widescreen ones on a number of occasions. When the spectacularly elephantine A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody number from The Great Ziegfeld is introduced, narrator Frank Sinatra mentions that if the number could be filmed today, it might look something like this at which time the telecine camera zooms in to increase the width of the picture by trimming off the top and bottom of the image. If it were only for that one number, I might have seen the point, but time after time, this happens. The entire Show Boat sequence is compromised in this way, some heads get lopped off in the process, and some numbers like On the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe, The Varsity Drag, the Broadway Ballet or An American in Paris Ballet begin in the 4:3 aspect ratio and during the number expand ridiculously into widescreen with the careful directorial compositions thrown out the window. The attempts to do this have been done subtly, but for those of us who know the original films by heart; these changes almost amount to sacrilege.

Thats Entertainment, Part 2 [1976] Two years later, after the enormous reception to the by the powers that be at M-G-M decided on a sequel. Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire were brought in to host the film and narrate all the segments. Seeing the two veteran performers reunited in some simple dance routines thirty years after their only on-screen pairing in Ziegfeld Follies is definitely a treat, but the film has the distinct feeling of been there-done that about it. Efforts have been made to extend the theme of the film from being just musical numbers to include comedy bits with the Marx Brothers, famous lines from M-G-M films. Especially Greta Garbos I want to be alone or Franchot Tones I want to run barefoot through your hair, and a segment on the Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn partnership, but the segments are rudimentarily put together and often fall flat.

Whats worse, the film is much too loaded with Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire numbers. The men were undeniable geniuses at their craft, but the almost relentless parade of their numbers made the film very Astaire-Kelly top heavy to the detriment of the rest of the film. In fact, at one point, Gene actually says in his narration, Here you are again, Fred. That speaks volumes about the films poor overall concept and execution. And once again, Academy ratio production numbers are violated by being forced into a widescreen frame. No matter how much we might have wanted them to be widescreen films, Annie Get Your Gun, Girl Crazy, Easter Parade, the 1934 version of The Merry Widow, and the Cypress Garden finale of Easy to Love aren't and showing them as such violates the integrity of the cinematography in each one of those film.

Thats Entertainment III! [1994] The original Thats Entertainment may have the lions share of classic M-G-M musical moments, but Thats Entertainment III works overtime with the footage it has left at its disposal. Twenty years after the original film was released, the original premise is resumed by having great M-G-M stars of the past return to the studio to host segments on a variety of topics. Esther Williams and Lena Horne narrate clips of their work at the studio. Gene Kelly briefs us about the early talkie years while June Allyson talks about the studios efforts to find budding talents and build them into stars. Debbie Reynolds discusses the glamour mill at the studio intent on making its fabulous line-up of leading ladies look their best. Cyd Charisse pays homage to Gene Kelly, Ann Miller praises Fred Astaires career, while Mickey Rooney does the same with his beloved Judy Garland. Finally Howard Keel takes us into the widescreen, stereophonic last years of the MGM musical.

What makes these segments special this time around, however, is that unseen and at the time, was the outtakes and behind-the-scenes footage is woven into the fabric of the picture. The frame frequently splits so we can see, for example, how Eleanor Powells complex Fascinatin Rhythm number was filmed in a single take for Lady Be Good or how two different versions of Fred Astaires I Wanna Be a Dancin Man from The Belle of New York were filmed though only Freds new costume gives it away. Otherwise, he mirrors himself step for step and gesture for gesture. We see an unused barnyard version of A Lady Loves from Debbie Reynolds, with I Love Melvin and four outtakes of Judy Garland numbers, all of which are highlights of the film. We even get to hear Ava Gardners singing voice, rather than Annette Warrens dubbing, paired with her image in Show Boat and see two incarnations of Two Faced Woman, one an intriguing mix of dancing chorines and the other a Joan Crawford dud from Torch Song. Their love for the studio and the pride in their accomplishments come through every last frame of this third film. Thats Entertainment III may not have the best numbers, but these elderly veterans, many in the twilight years of their careers when these bridging sequences were filmed, add a real poignancy to the project that makes it for me in many ways the most enjoyable of the three features.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Thats Entertainment!: The 1080p transfers handle the tremendous array of different aspect ratios, film stocks, and colour processes with variable success. Much of the black and white footage looks overly grainy, not surprising with some of the early talkies but less understandable when dealing with later black and white movies like Girl Crazy or It Happened in Brooklyn. Any time a films original 4:3 aspect ratio is violated by zooming in on the image, the sharpness is compromised and the grain structure becomes far more noticeable. On the other hand, we have footage from Take Me Out to the Ballgame, The Barkleys of Broadway, especially with Ginger Rogers blood-red fingernails sear the screen, also The Toast of New Orleans, Meet Me in St. Louis, High Society, and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers looks astonishing enough to make those films instant must-haves on Blu-ray. Seeing faded, blurry clips from the films in the various bonus features also on the disc makes it obvious that much work went into making the clips in the main feature look as good as possible.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Thats Entertainment, Part 2: Again, clarity and sharpness varies from clip to clip, and once again, the zooming in on the images with Academy ratios softens the picture and magnifies the grain structure. Overall, the quality of the clips seems a bit lacklustre in comparison to the other two films, and there are fewer clips that really impress in this feature in terms of high definition sharpness and dimensionality. The few that did it for me included Steppin Out With My Baby from Easter Parade, I Like Myself from Its Always Fair Weather, and I Remember It Well from Gigi. Once again, the VistaVision image of High Society is very impressive though Frank Sinatras checked coat is riddled with moir patterns.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Thats Entertainment III!: For the most part, this films footage fares the best from beginning to end in high definition. The host sequences as well as almost all of the black and white clips have a sharpness and sheen that are lacking in the two previous pictures. The lack of a perfect video score is attributed almost entirely to the annoying zooming in on the 4:3 aspect ratio images for widescreen presentation which, especially in the cases of the introductory Bring on the Beautiful Ladies from Ziegfeld Follies and Cyd Charisses Two-Faced Woman outtake, look near-disastrous. On the other hand, one look at Carmen Mirandas wildly vivid umbrella headdress from Nancy Goes to Rio will let you know how gorgeous these M-G-M musicals are going to look in high definition once Warner Bros. begins producing them.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  All three films are in the impressive awesome 5.1 Dolby TrueHD Master Audio track must deal with a tremendous variance of audio quality from the tinniest and hissiest early talkies to the magnificently surging orchestras for the more recent musicals as well as the orchestras that play the scores for each of the documentaries. Though deep bass is lacking throughout most of each disc, many of the recording sessions for these musicals had different audio stems recorded from separately placed microphones that could be fashioned into stereo surround elements to enhance the listening experience, and they're surprisingly effective. Thats Entertainment III! features audio levels that seem just the slightest bit soft compared to the volume levels of the other two films.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

That's Entertainment! [1974]:

Special Feature: Introduction by Turner Classic Movies Host Robert Osborne [1080p] [4:45]

Special Feature: Just One More Time [1974] [8:45] Many Hollywood stars are reconvening at the M-G-M Studio, the filming site for many of their most famous movies, to discuss M-G-M movie musical history for the film That's Entertainment! [1974]. In 1972, M-G-M's worldwide production head Daniel Melnick assigned a team of editors, researchers and lab technicians to pour over the many musicals from the studio's vaults to compile this retrospective under the guidance of producer/director Jack Haley Jr.. They will not only need their technical expertise, but also their memories of what the great M-G-M musicals meant and mean to the public movie going audience. At the time when these movies were being made, M-G-M had more stars under contract than all of the other major Hollywood studios combined. The studio was not averse to taking risks, showcasing big name non-musical stars in musical numbers, or giving an unknown talent a break. It could take these risks because of the financial resources available. The lavishness of such musicals are very unlikely to be ever seen again in future film productions.

Special Feature: Thats Entertainment!: 50 Years of M-G-M [1974] [66:00] Television special publicising the film featuring George Hamilton and his then wife Alana interviewing Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Donald OConnor, Johnny Weissmuller, and Liza Minnelli. There is also 8 minutes of clips from the film.

Special Feature: M-G-Ms 25th Anniversary Luncheon Newsreel [4:3] [10:30] This is the complete newsreel coverage of the grand silver anniversary luncheon which is only excerpted in the film.

That's Entertainment! Part 2 [1976]:

Special Feature: Introduction by Turner Classic Movies Host Robert Osborne [1080p] [4:00]

Special Feature: The Lion Roars Again [1975] This short film is a chronicle of the 1975 International Press Conclave hosted by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer over two days in May 1975. The event was used to preview several upcoming M-G-M feature films. After opening remarks by studio vice-president 'Daniel Melnick', the press gets a tour of a set that will be used in the film set of Logan's Run [1976], meeting the producer and wardrobe designers. Gene Kelly introduces them to That's Entertainment, Part II [1976] and several others who will be in the film including Fred Astaire, Eleanor Powell and many others. The film focuses on other films currently in production including Sweet Revenge [1976] starring Stockard Channing, The Sunshine Boys [1975], The Hearts of the West [1975] with Jeff Bridges and The Wind and the Lion [1975] with Sean Connery and Candice Bergen.

Special Feature: The Masters Behind the Musicals [2004] [37:00] This feature is an all too brief overview of the men and women behind the scenes who tirelessly worked to give the M-G-M musicals their magic. Included in this documentary are interviews with various M-G-M stars about the lots producers, musical conductors and arrangers, choreographers, and directors, many of whom are worthy of their own documentaries.

Special Feature: A Mike Douglas Show [excerpt] [1976] [21:00] Finds the affable talk show host at M-G-M interviewing Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Hermes Pan, Debbie Reynolds, Nanette Fabray, Ann Miller, and Janis Paige about their work at the studio.

Theatrical Trailer [1976] [3:45] The Original Theatrical Trailer.

That's Entertainment III! [1994]:

Special Feature: Introduction by Turner Classic Movies Host Robert Osborne [1080p] [3:30]

Special Feature: Thats Entertainment III: Behind the Screen [1994] [53:00] The documentary is the best supplementary documentary in the package as the producers and the directors of the film discuss working with each of the star hosts and then the hosts themselves relive memories of their work at the studio which are not rehashes of what they say in the film but rather comments brimming with information and opinions about other studio personnel.

Special Feature: The Musical Outtake Jukebox [49:00] Musical Outtake Jukebox has more than a Dozen Delightful Numbers left on the Cutting-Room Floor, now liberated From the Studio Vault. Features seventeen musical outtakes from an assortment of M-G-M musicals. Three of the outtakes are the complete versions of numbers which are shortened in the actual feature: The Lock Step, A Lady Loves, and Mister Monotony. The other outtakes feature such stars as Judy Garland, Bert Lahr and Marjorie Main, Jane Powell, Mario Lanza and Kathryn Grayson, Lena Horne, and Frank Sinatra. Selections can be chosen individually or watched all at once.

Theatrical Trailer [1994] [1:30] The Original Theatrical Trailer.

Finally, Thats Entertainment! [The Complete Collection] [3 Blu-ray Disc Set] makes a most welcome debut onto the Blu-ray format. The films are pure entertainment featuring an assortment of talent which the world will likely never see again. Now all we require is that Warner Bros starts a systematic schedule of high definition releases of many of the classics contained in excerpt form on these excellent discs. Ever since I saw these Three films released originally in the cinema, I have loved them ever since and gives you so much of a wealth of classic M-G-M films that is loved by people of all ages and have wished they would release all these films on the Blu-ray format, as this is the best way to view all the contents. But of course the video clips shown of past classic M-G-M films, especially the awesome colourful musicals, that I hope in time the ones that everyone wants released will soon get the best Blu-ray treatment, as these old classic M-G-M films should be preserved for our future generation. Very Highly Recommended!

Often they are very impressive, looking like they were filmed yesterday.  I am left wondering if this is some rip-off company that produced these.  Surely MGM would not be proud of this offering.

I'm keeping both because if an atom bomb drops on my collection I hope at least one copy will survive.  I saw Part I (not called that, of course) in the great Ziegfeld Theater, I think it was, in September 1974, a few months after it opened, and have never gotten over the thrill of that movie collection.  The second had a different director and was comparatively poor, but TE III has great stuff, including an unbelievable sequence of how a ""traveling"" tap dance number is filmed.

2111578,5,B0002OXVDW,"I was unaware of the previous release in blu-ray for these films until after I had watched the new release. I see that the previous version got some poor reviews. I have watched the films over the last 24 hours, and find these versions to be stunning. The clips from original; Techniciolor are richly colored, and extremely well done, at least in my opinion. Original Technicolor films take on new life when carefully restored. I do not know if the is a new 4K transfer, but suspect it is.  Warner has been doing wonders with the MGM musicals. Some of the Black & white films are a bit grainy, but still beautiful. Color films not Tecnicolor are also very fine, just not what can be done with Technicolor. The only problem I saw was a couple of spots where the sound did not match the lip movement. Just a small problem, probably because of the reprocessing of the soundtracks which are otherwise excellent, and seemed to be mostly in the old Black & white clips.
There are some excellent extras as well. On the third disc are several alternate & deleted scenes which I am glad to see are atill in superior condition. Wouldn't it be nice if warner & othet studioS would insert these scenes whenever they still exist in a film, using brachimg, so those that want to see them would be able to see all of the original film before they were cut for time or some other reason, and not the truncated version.",1353542400,10,1402,4.455252918287938

Stars like Elizabeth Taylor, Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Liza Minelli, Fred Astaire and many more are the host of this 3-Part-""Movie"" which contains several Musical scenes from the MGM Musicals from their beginning sound era and we hear and see a early version of the world famous ""Singing in the rain"", performed by Ukelele Ike, to Judy Garlands versions to Gene Kelly's.

We also see alternate camera angle /behind the Scenes of Eleanor Powell amazing tap dancing ""Broadway Rhythm"" (which is in my mind very interesting).

Ok, I have seen those critics who owned before the laser disc. Myself I never had the Laser Disc but I'm very happy with this ""That's Entertainment""-Set.

Sound of course is english and contains english subtitles!!!

For Fans of MGM musicals its a must have it!!!

Blu-Ray Disc is Codefree!!!

Alternate there is also available a 6-CD-Box-Set with the songs incl. Overture/End-Title, alternative/extented versions like ""Swinging Mr. Mendelsohn"" of Judy Garland from ""Everybody Sings"" and on Disc 6 which is fulloaded with alternate / rare outtakes like Jane Powell for ""The Student Prince"" (her part got later Ann Blyth).",1325030400,3,1175,5.09375

I'm starting to wonder if these films even though they were theatrical releases were originally shot with video tape because the blu rays higher quality seems to betray the low video quality.
However I may downgrade this and get the DVD set instead and give this box set to an enemy because you sure wouldn't offload this on a friend.
Oh by the way, why did I purchase this you may ask, after so many previous warnings here, well I was in hope that Warner had recalled and fixed it by now, alas no such luck, maybe they can't fix it because it was shot with video tape.
Anyway buy the DVD set, I'm going to.",1309737600,13,672,4.217054263565892
2111588,5,B0002OXVDW,"Even though I've always loved the ""That's Entertainment"" movies, I held off getting the bluray versions of the films because the reviews here say that the image quality is about the same as the DVD release. Finally, a third party seller had this set at a price I couldn't resist, so I went ahead and ordered it anyway. I'm glad I did.

I have a hidef projection system with a ten foot screen. I have watched the DVDs on it and I just watched the blurays. No contest. The bluray looks phenomenal. The thing that the reviewers here seem to be reacting to is the way the film was put together in the first place. Faced with a bunch of different sources and aspect ratios, the editors who assembled this compilation did their best to make the transition from clip to clip as smooth as possible. The image goes from widescreen to Academy format, and even shifts formats subtly within clips. Some clips are blown up and cropped, which is certainly not the best way to watch a movie, but in the context of ""That's Entertainment"" it isn't annoying. It fact, it works fine for the wide spectrum of clips presented in this film

Let me make this clear... Seeing the musical numbers and short sequences here in a reformatted aspect ratio certainly isn't a replacement for seeing the whole film in the proper aspect ratio. But on bluray, we haven't been given many MGM musicals to choose from. ""American in Paris"" ""Wizard of Oz"" and ""South Pacific"" are stunning, but there are a lot more titles that deserve release.

Several reviews mention excessive film grain. This is an artifact of the original film element, not the video transfer. I prefer grain to digital smearing filters. Also, at the time these films were made, the studios hadn't begun their film restoration programs, so some clips, in particular one of the Esther Williams swimming numbers and the clips from ""The Wizard of Oz"" have slight registration problems between the three Technicolor negatives. This is the way the clips looked on original release. I suppose they could have gone in and reedited and reformatted the clips, but that would involve rebuilding the movies from scratch.

Any project of the size and scope of the ""That's Entertainment"" movies is going to involve certain sacrifices. These sacrifices were made when the films were assembled. It isn't fair to blame the fine bluray transfer for things that weren't a part of the digitization process. If you like these films and want the ultimate MGM sampler film, this is it. Don't hesitate because of the negative reviews.",1308873600,19,2543,4.759637188208616

2111594,4,B0002OXVDW,"I know what you're thinking...who would want to watch the 'standard' version of a movie when they can watch the 'original widescreen?'  Well, i've found that to be true in every case...except for all three That's Entertainment movies.  Luckily, these discs are double-sided, with the widescreen on one side and the standard on the other.

Typically, a 'standard' or 'full-screen' version of a film is obtained by taking the original widescreen presentation, zooming in on the center of the image, and eliminating the sides to make it fill up the screen on an old-school 4:3 CRT television.  If you're a movie buff, then you know how annoying that practice is, as you lose picture information off to the sides, and sometimes on the top.

But in this ONE instance, i strenuously recommend watching the 'standard' version side for all the movies.  The reason is this...the vast majority of these old musicals that are showcased on this box set were originally shot with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 (4:3).  That was the old screen standard of most movies up until the 1950's, when little by little, more movies began to switch over to filming in widescreen ratios.  It's also why televisions were that same size ratio (4:3) for more than 50 years.  They were just matching the movie studios' frame ratio at that time.

When the studios came out with VHS/DVD versions of their movies, they were often released in the 'standard' or 'full-screen' versions as described above.  So, the standard version is basically changing a new movie to fit on an old TV.  But with the widescreen versions of That's Entertainment, they're doing the opposite.  They've changed an old movie to fit on a new TV.  Many of the shots in the widescreen version of these films were cropped on the top or bottom to change the shape of the image to fit on a newer, widescreen TV.  There are many scenes where the image is cut off right at the top of somebody's head, so it will fill up a widescreen TV.  Often times, there's a lot of extra stuff going on there that the DVD has now cut out of the image, just to conform with the standards of newer TV's.  Often times, the picture was zoomed in so much that it felt really crowded, with no deep visual field for the context of the scene in the movie.

That said, it DOES mean that any genuine widescreen images will appear with letterboxes on all 4 sides of the image.  But if you are a film buff, and want to see the clips of these old films as they were intended to be seen, do yourself and watch the 'standard' side of the disc.  If you don't you'll end up watching some very doctored cut ups from scenes.

So, my advice?  Watch all three movies in their STANDARD definition cases, so you can take advantage of seeing the ENTIRE movie, as the directors intended them.

I hope i was able to help some folks.",1268006400,19,2824,4.537549407114624
2111595,2,B0002OXVDW,"What a disappointment.  I specifically purchased this set because I wanted to revisit That's Entertainment in Hi-fidelity, but the quality turned out to be that of a poorly performing DVD.  What's the matter with Warner Bros.?

2111596,5,B0002OXVDW,"At barely 30, I remember when this came on TV. I was in a foreign city, suppose to be site-seeing, and I couldn't stop watching it. Of course this is well out of my generation, but I do have an interest in nostalgia, and it's such a great glimpse into the past when entertainment was pure, simple, and honest. I highly recommend this, young or old. In fact, I sent it to my grandma to have her watch it first.",1255564800,,409,4.125
2111607,4,B0002OXVDW,"I am glad I was able to purchase this set.

Each of the three original feature movies is on a two sided DVD, with standard and widescreen sides, an option I really appreciate. The quality was excellent. Yes, I see that someone commented on sudden color changes, but either that copy was somehow damaged in manufacture or the reviewer's DVD player wasn't ""happy"" with the DVD. I've seen DVDs play better on one machine than on another... I've heard records do the same. Anytime something is being read by spinning it past the object that reads it (needle; laser; whatever), there can be differences in how the disc is read. I find this happens with DVDs that have subtitles and/or language choices more than with those that read the same every time, and these do have 3 language choices for subtitles. The only ""color changes"" are the switching from B&W movies to color ones when I view them.

Perhaps the most special moment is when Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire dance together while ""hosting"" Part 2. Both had mentioned how special it was to dance together briefly that one time before. It was so very special to see them dance together one more time, to see those great dancers side by side, and seeing the enjoyment and mutual respect.

Dances/scenes are rarely shown in their entirety due to time constraints, but most are excellent montage types or are edited so well that it takes a moment to realize that verse 2 or the bridge was cut. Thankfully, the entire ""Singin' in the Rain"" by Gene Kelly is in the 1st one. Part 2 also has come comedians, and another scene shown in its entirety is the Groucho Marx and his steamer trunk in the tiny ship cabin.",1254528000,,1656,4.569023569023569
2111608,5,B0002OXVDW,"I bought the collection in HD. Of course the older black & white movie scenes aren't transferred to HD. But, all in all, I liked them. Anyone who lived in this era will enjoy the singers, dancers and the simple stories. The title tells it all. THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT. I bought mine through Amazon too. The sad part is the fact most of the stars of the films shown, are now deceased.
Of course it is motion picture history that will never be repeated.

Time watching it changed my mind. Terrible transfer to HD. Grainy and too disappointed to watch them again. I have ordered the Blu-Ray but notice that comments made for this version is also bad. If I get it this week and if it is bad, they both go back to Warners. There is no reason that these sets are sloppily done. They should be picture perfect. But, the HD isn't. If Warners could restore the Chaplin movies to perfect quality, where did they go wrong here?

The Blu-Ray isn't any better than the HD version. From a studio that restored Charlie Chaplain and the studio that restored all of the early James Bond features, this is a disappointment. These three features are Hollywood's Musical history. I am sure the new head of Warner's DVDs can redo them as they should be done.

Dance lessons, voice coaches, acting lessons, fashion advice and make-up sessions were offered.  The first movie highlights nostalgia, the second includes non-musical films and the third uses the perspective of film restorers and researchers (still fun).

Idealy, what would unfortunatly prove too costly, some one should 'snip out' the the documentary's clips of ""Singing In The Rain"", ""Wizard Of Oz"", and all of the hundred or so original movie clips and insert the new remastered clips from the digitaly restored movies. I have many of these and they are certainly much better, cleaner and vibrant than the documentary's clips, and that's on standard DVD! Maybe some day.

2111685,5,B0002OXVDW,"This combines a group of movie clips that both the musical lover AND those who things musicals are ""dumb"" will enjoy. The clips where the musical stars are doing what they do best is the best of the best; the clips where the actors are attempting to sing is some of the best compilation footage out there today, and a real laugh! It provides a glipse into what was one of the great motion picture studios in the history of Hollywood (California), and a tribute to those people who created the foundation for a medium that sometimes gets lost in trying spread a message. This collection pays homage to a time when movies weren't out to change the world, but to make the world a better place if even for only a few hours at a time.

For years, this has been something that people had wanted on DVD, but it took almost 25 years for this to make it into DVD format, and with that, the print is excellent. However, don't be worried that your DVD player is in the wrong mode (widescreen or 4:3): it is how the movie was shot. Remember: there was a time when widescreen did not exist, and this shows us what happens when you widen the screen for more picture AND more sound.

Some of the greatest stars ever to grace a movie screen are in this collection: Elizabeth Taylor, Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Judy Garland (known as the biggest star MGM created by historians), Mickey Rooney (truly one of the film industry's finest actors), Lena Horne, Ava Gardner, Jimmy (James) Stewart, Liza Minelli, Clark Gable and so many others. The moments with Clark Gable trying to sing and dance make you glad he decided not to do it anymore; it was wartime (World War II), and many of the folks were off fighting the war.

Growing up, the movies this collection features in its clips were films that were only seen on television in showcases like ""The Million Dollar Movie"" and such, with black-and-white televisions at first, then color sets. Because MGM did their best to make sure this collection was thorough and complete, when a movie is in widescreen (Cinescope), it is presented that way ... unlike that of the modern day pan-and-scan film edits we see on TV today.

If you have young children, I believe this is a bit of history in Hollywood that even they will enjoy, especially if they enjoy more of the standard, mellower music of our times. The songs that were introduced by these films are now considered standards, and have stood the test of time, unlike so much of what we hear today. Though we've progressed in so many ways, the phrase, ""They don't write 'em like that anymore"" really does apply to the music in these clips.

In a day and age when Hollywood is rediscovering the power of the movie musical, perhaps the directors and producers, as well as cinemetographers, can look to these films as something that has endured a test of time, and was proven effective in helping the world when it was so much in need of cheering-up. Remember the old song: ""Forget your troubles, c'mon get happy ... "" This film collection will make even the crabbiest person smile, if for only a little while.

For more historical information on MGM, and the rise and near collapse of the studio, I recommend the series, ""When the Lion Roared"" --- you and your kids can learn a lot for it.",1182816000,9,3266,4.517766497461929

The high points for me are `That's Entertainment! 3', including its selection of out-takes such as Garland's `Mr Monotony' and the wry and illuminating commentary from Esther Williams and Lena Horne. There is also a great documentary on the making of `That's Entertainment! 3' that focuses on the talents behind the screen such as the choreographers, composers and arrangers - people who are often overlooked in favour of the stars. There are some great comments, such as the one by Ann Miller who points out how callous Busby Berkeley was for making her carry on tapping when she had a bleeding blister.

2111716,4,B0002OXVDW,"Upon its release ""That's Entertainment!"" became the biggest and brightest money maker of 1974...and it's no wonder. For a little over two hours one had the enchanted experience of being teleported to a world just this side of over the rainbow. Here is a cornucopia of magical scenes and snippets from MGM's most magnificent musicals. Directed with adroit - if self congratulatory - wit and concision by Jack Haley Jr. (son of Oz's Tin Man), ""That's Entertainment!"" is the sort of blindingly spellbinding extravaganza that reinforces MGM's once galvanic mottos of ""art for art's sake"" and ""more stars than there are in heaven."" At its gala premiere Jack Haley Sr. was heard declaring, ""This isn't nostalgia. This is art."" Rightly so, by 1974 the MGM musical had been dead for some time and the studio itself was on the verge of a restructuring that would ultimately reduce its holdings to garage sale status. But at least in this film such forgotten treasures were resurrected from oblivion to their rightful place in film history. Variety gave ""That's Entertainment!"" a glowing review, trumpeting, ""That while many may ponder the future of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, no one can deny that it's had one heck of a past!""
Naturally, MGM just had to have a sequel. Two years later ""That's Entertainment II"" came out. But David Melnick's follow up was decidedly a let down on several levels. First, it removed the star cameos that so poignantly buttressed the original's vintage clips. Second, it presented the footage in a seemingly hap-hazard chronology. And finally, it interrupted the musical performances with a showcase from some of the studio's non-musical performers in a string of disjointed word play that neither enhanced the memory of their original performances or the film experience that was to be had. Though not nearly as successful as its predecessor, ""That's Entertainment II"" was nevertheless a box office titan.
In 1994 MGM once again revisited its vaults for ""That's Entertainment III"" the final installment in the series. But by now the experience was vaguely beginning to resemble grave robbing. The new film's primary selling feature was that, in addition to showcasing another round of classic performances, it also dug deep into the coffers of outtakes for a series of deleted musical numbers which, until 1994, had either never or rarely been seen. Despite these innovations the final installment to the trilogy was the one most poorly received. It's the original that continues dazzle us all and it's the original that remains the cornerstone of this newly minted DVD box set.
Warner's DVD transfers of all three ""That's Entertainment!"" films is a welcomed delight. After years of viewing parts one and two with poorly mastered vintage clips, these newly minted discs appear to have been the benefactors of some digital restoration. Beginning with the original film, there is a decide lack of grain and grit on this transfer that is most becoming. Colors (during the Technicolor clips) are vibrant, rich and deep. B&W images are very crisp, nicely balanced, with an often stunning gray scale and superior attention to fine details. There is only the slightest amount of edge enhancement for a picture that is very smooth. The audio has been remixed and remastered to stereo for all three films. Part II seems to suffer from slightly lower contrast levels overall, but the same review for Part I applies. The most outstanding example of digital mastering comes in Part III - a marvelously vibrant array of clips remastered (as they were for the theatrical engagement) in high def that positively glows off the screen. The audio is 5.1 surround and is remarkably aggressive throughout.
Extras include a bonus disc of musical outtakes and extras, audio only catalogue of songs and dances, the original footage of the LA premiere with all of the old time musical stars in attendance and a series of short subjects that collectively perform like a documentary on the series. There are also the original theatrical trailers for each film to be had. In the immortal words of George Gershwin...""who could ask for anything more?""",1109980800,3,4137,5.067448680351906

Indeed, the individual who emphasized the particularly woeful job done on Part 2 is right on the money; and the pan-and-scan side of the disc is even worse than the widescreen (those who rave about the great digital transfers should have either their eyes or their heads examined -- preferably both).

It's a great way of introducing your children or grandchildren to REAL entertainment and not the junk that's out now. Makes one yearn to see almost all of the films featured in their full length versions.  While not all the numbers are winners, most of them are wonderful.  The grand daddy of them all is the first one, my favorite.  The other two have their wonderful moments as well.  I like the concept of the first and third installments the best.  Glad that so many are coming out on DVD next year....but we also need the following..SUMMER STOCK; BARKLEYS OF BROADWAY; IT'S ALWAYS FAIR WEATHER; THE PIRATE; BELLE OF NEW YORK; YOLANDA AND THE THEIF and the underated but delightful MEET ME IN LAS VEGAS.  Are you listening you people at Warners?? These films deserve to be seen by all musical lovers.  They were filmed so that you can actually see the dance numbers straight forward with none of the kinentic and quick editing i. E CHICAGO and MOULIN ROUGE.",1100131200,9,1044,4.723756906077348
2111723,4,B0002OXVDW,"Magnificent excerpts that made up the three MGM films, from 1974, 1976 and 1994, show how great the MGM stable of stars was.  The three skimpy program booklets, however, identify only the titles of the musical numbers and not the films from which they came.  For that you have to go to an on-screen display.

As an author of a book on Jimmy Durante and enthusiastic fan of his, I was hoping to find on the 4th DVD disc the two musical numbers Durante made for THE ZIEGFELD FOLLIES (1946)and then dropped before release.  But no such luck.  Do these clips still exist somewhere in the vaults?  In any case there is an outtake from THIS TIME FOR KEEPS (1947) with Durante singing a bedtime song, ""Little Big Shot,"" to cute little Sharon McManus.

The bonus disc of outtakes contains 16 clips, the most interesting possibly being Lena Horne singing ""You Got Looks"" and ""You Won't Forget Me,"" outtakes from MEET ME IN LAS VEGAS (1956) and DUCHESS OF IDAHO (1950) respectively.  There are no printed program notes but there is a complete on-screen list of credits.

The color on all 4 discs is very good and the use of widescreen where appropriate is much appreciated.",1099526400,6,1163,4.606796116504855

I delight at the extras as well, but most have been released before. The That's Entertainment Three release on VHS had the same extras on there and I wish there were some new things.

The three spectacular compilations built around the legacy and incomparable magic of the MGM musicals are given stellar treatment in this new DVD set, meticulously remastered with gorgeous, bold colors that jump off the screen, amazing surround sound..and beautifully packaged.

Add to that, an astounding bonus disc, bursting with amazing content including 16 outtake musical numbers, a slew of documentaries, both vintage and new, and other rarities that make this set easily qualify for the DVD of the year....

2111726,3,B0002OXVDW,"It's high time these films were brought to us in DVD, but the quick-and-dirty (often very dirty) transfers really take the bloom off the rose. The aspect ratio issue was handled well, but that's about the best we can say for these third-rate transfers.

Material like this deserves proper restoration for its DVD release. Instead, we get color shifts, heavy grain, overwhelming amounts of negative dirt, mars, and scratches. We are even treated to scribed cue marks on the transfer print of show #2. To see changeover cues on a 2004 digital transfer represents the height of ""who cares"" sloppiness.

Perhaps some day down the road, this material will be given the ""Criterion treatment"" that it deserves. Meanwhile, we'll have to enjoy it through all the obvious deficiencies of this carelessly-made edition.",1099094400,14,807,5.106060606060606
2111727,5,B0002OXVDW,"The biggest extra of all - all three ""That's Entertainment"" films are presented in two versions.

Side A of each disc has the widescreen version, as shown in theaters, for the rich people with 16:9 widescreen television sets.

Side B is in the ""Standard Version"", ""presented in a format preserving the multiple aspect rations of its original theatrical exhibition"", for us poor people with old fashioned 4:3 television sets.

Which means that, on an 4:3 TV, non-widescreen clips, presented on side A either in reduced size, with black bars at the top, bottom, AND both sides, or widescreen with the top and bottom of the picture cut off, can be viewed on side B full screen (no black bars) and yet widescreen films on side B are in the correct widescreen aspect ration (with black bars at top and bottom).

So us poor people should now watch the B sides, and, when we all get rich and get our widescreen television sets, we can switch to the A sides at no additional expense.",1098662400,11,975,4.618497109826589

The packaging is normal (cardboard box,plastic cases, single sheet insert) but the movies themselves are gorgeous! the colors are vibrant which shows off a lot of what went into making the films & the sound has been given a Dolby Digital 5.1 upgraded.

2111729,4,B0002OXVDW,"These films introduced me to Astaire, Kelly, and the brilliance of MGM musicals, and I am beyond grateful. So, of course, I wanted the DVD's to be as remarkable as the dances and songs that inspired such joy.

Unfortunately, the black and white segments in this transfer are very grainy, and the Technicolor segments -- which were so vibrant on film -- are pale, while the color shifts noticibly. I watched the discs on two different players and two different TVs, and the results were the same.

This is in contrast to the laserdiscs of these films, which though they bled a bit, were far less grainy, far more vibrant, and color-consistent.

These three films are the best chronicle of Hollywood's great musicals (leaving out only the amazing, spectacular, you-have-to-see-them-to-believe-them Nicholas Brothers, who were under contract to rival Paramount) and since DVD will be the format on which they will live forever, I wish they had received better care.",1098230400,6,962,5.037735849056604

I didn't even realize there was more extras on the B side including almost an hour of deleted songs. I just spent the past weekend watching the entire series. I never saw Part 3 before and it was just as impressive as the first two. What a great holiday gift this will be for anybody who loves all the great musicals from the past.

2111732,5,B0002OXVDW,"As a fan of the MGM musicals, I have always loved all three THAT'S ENTERAINMENT! films, especially the first (because it started the resurgence in love for these films), and the third (because it was so innovative and creative in taking us behind the scenes). I've owned them on VHS, I've owned them on LASER DISC, but this new Warner DVD boxed set puts everything that has come before it to shame!

The new 16x9 widescreen transfers are stunning! The colors jump off the screen and the clarity is dazzling.

The 5.1 surround sound is equally amazing. It envelops you!

Best of all is the incredible assemblage of extras Warner has brought forth for the bonus disc TREASURES FROM THE VAULT. You get amazing documentaries (many not seen in years or brand new), vintage TV specials, and 17 additional OUTTAKE MUSICAL NUMBERS that were not included in the original MGM features. What a treat!

It's obvious this package was put together with a great deal of care and passion. Long live the MGM musical, and thanks to this DVD set, that mantra can be a reality!",1097539200,57,1057,4.666666666666667
2111733,4,B0002OXVDW,"Upon its release ""That's Entertainment!"" became the biggest and brightest money maker of 1974...and it's no wonder. For a little over two hours one had the enchanted experience of being teleported to a world just this side of over the rainbow. Here is a cornucopia of magical scenes and snippets from MGM's most magnificent musicals. Directed with adroit - if self congratulatory - wit and concision by Jack Haley Jr. (son of Oz's Tin Man), ""That's Entertainment!"" is the sort of blindingly spellbinding extravaganza that reinforces MGM's once galvanic mottos of ""art for art's sake"" and ""more stars than there are in heaven.""  At its gala premiere Jack Haley Sr. was heard declaring, ""This isn't nostalgia. This is art."" Rightly so, by 1974 the MGM musical had been dead for some time and the studio itself was on the verge of a restructuring that would ultimately reduce its holdings to garage sale status. But at least in this film such forgotten treasures were resurrected from oblivion to their rightful place in film history. Variety gave ""That's Entertainment!"" a glowing review, trumpeting, ""That while many may ponder the future of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, no one can deny that it's had one heck of a past!""

Naturally, MGM just had to have a sequel. Two years later ""That's Entertainment II"" came out. But David Melnick's follow up was decidedly a let down on several levels. First, it removed the star cameos that so poignantly buttressed the original's vintage clips. Second, it presented the footage in a seemingly hap-hazard chronology. And finally, it interrupted the musical performances with a showcase from some of the studio's non-musical performers in a string of disjointed word play that neither enhanced the memory of their original performances or the film experience that was to be had. Though not nearly as successful as its predecessor, ""That's Entertainment II"" was nevertheless a box office titan.

In 1994 MGM once again revisited its vaults for ""That's Entertainment III"" the final installment in the series. But by now the experience was vaguely beginning to resemble grave robbing. The new film's primary selling feature was that, in addition to showcasing another round of classic performances, it also dug deep into the coffers of outtakes for a series of deleted musical numbers which, until 1994, had either never or rarely been seen. Despite these innovations the final installment to the trilogy was the one most poorly received. It's the original that continues dazzle us all and it's the original that remains the cornerstone of this newly minted DVD box set.

Warner's DVD transfers of all three ""That's Entertainment!"" films is a welcomed delight. After years of viewing parts one and two with poorly mastered vintage clips, these newly minted discs appear to have been the benefactors of some digital restoration. Beginning with the original film, there is a decide lack of grain and grit on this transfer that is most becoming. Colors (during the Technicolor clips) are vibrant, rich and deep. B&W images are very crisp, nicely balanced, with an often stunning gray scale and superior attention to fine details. There is only the slightest amount of edge enhancement for a picture that is very smooth. The audio has been remixed and remastered to stereo for all three films. Part II seems to suffer from slightly lower contrast levels overall, but the same review for Part I applies. The most outstanding example of digital mastering comes in Part III - a marvelously vibrant array of clips remastered (as they were for the theatrical engagement) in high def that positively glows off the screen. The audio is 5.1 surround and is remarkably aggressive throughout.

Extras include a bonus disc of musical outtakes and extras, audio only catalogue of songs and dances, the original footage of the LA premiere with all of the old time musical stars in attendance and a series of short subjects that collectively perform like a documentary on the series. There are also the original theatrical trailers for each film to be had. In the immortal words of George Gershwin...""who could ask for anything more?""",1096934400,184,4142,5.067448680351906
2111734,5,B0002OXVDW,"While this trilogy of MGM musical tribute films have been available on VHS as a boxed set, the sheer quantity of unforgettable musical highlights showcased make them 'naturals' for DVD, with the format's superior 'search' accessibility, and improved picture and sound quality. There should be a 'warning label', though; these movies MAY cause you to start singing and dancing, and turn you into a musical 'junkie'!

Each film, besides offering a spectacular array of showstoppers, has a style uniquely it's own; the first, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! (1974), is the glossiest, with an array of 'guest stars' introducing clips (Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Elizabeth Taylor, Kelly, Astaire, Jimmy Stewart, and more) that is matchless; the second, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT, PART II (1976), provides a last opportunity to see hosts Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly do a bit of singing and dancing together, and expands the 'musical' format to include montages of classic comedy, and tributes to Tracy and Hepburn, and other 'non-musical' MGM stars; the oft-overlooked THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! III (1994) eschews the 'soft-focus' approach of it's predecessors, adding a 'behind-the-scenes' look at the demanding work of creating 'classic' routines, and an unflinching acknowledgement of the prejudices of the era, to the mix of musical highlights.

My only quibble is that the musical output of the other major Hollywood studios tends to be downplayed, particularly in THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT!, implying that MGM had the 'corner' on the market. Certainly, the Warner collection of Busby Berkeley spectaculars of the 30s, YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, and the Doris Day musicals, Fox, with Shirley Temple, Alice Faye, and Betty Grable, Columbia (Rita Hayworth), Paramount (Bing Crosby and Bob Hope), and, most significantly, RKO's classic series of Astaire and Rogers vehicles, all deserve as much recognition and credit for their input to the genre of 'classic' musicals. In terms of sheer 'star power' and overall quality, however, MGM was unmatched.

Whether you grew up loving musicals, or were introduced to the genre through recent films like CHICAGO or MOULIN ROUGE!, this collection of highlights should be essential viewing!",1095897600,139,2191,5.4955489614243325

Such a wonderful compilation of well known movies and more obscure work by the same stars, with intelligent commentary and, in the third film, behind-the-scenes footage that is a pleasure to see. This collection is uniformly respectful and loving towards these movies and the people who made them, and should be regarded as a tip sheet for other movies to watch, rather than a documentary. The third movie is really the only one that ever touches on unsavory practices in Hollywood, with Lena Horne briefly discussing racism, and allusions elsewhere to the poor treatment of Judy Garland.",1504051200,2,708,5.008474576271187
