607048,5,6303248497,"Season 2 of Transformers Animated continues with the story of Optimus, Bumblebee, Bulkhead and Prowl in 22nd Century Detroit, and their interactions with the humans Isaac Sumdac and his daughter Sari as they work together to fight the Decepticons - well, Isaac's a little too trusting for his own good, and unwittingly aids Megatron.  Towards the end of the season we also learn that Sari is not fully human.  In all, it's a very well written show, not just for kids.

My only complaint is with Hasbro, and the fact that even though the series ended in 2009, they have yet to release the final season, year 3 on DVD!",1362528000,,616,4.581818181818182

607052,5,6303248497,Transformers animated Season 2 is awesome! Megatron is finally completely functional again and out for vengence against the Autobots. The Autobots have to clean up the city and their image after a devastating battle with Megatron. The Allspark has been blown to pieces and the race is on to find all the shards. This season has plenty of compelling storylines with interesting plots and a great thrill ride of action all around. A fan favorite is introduced in the Constructicons who keep the G1 influence with the same witty attitude. Blackarachnia returns for another round as does one of the coolest looking animated characters in Bounty Hunter Lockdown. Season 2 is just as good as the first with some new characters and schemes by the Decepticon leader Megatron while his counterpart Optimus Prime really grasps the leadership role and the hero quality of the Autobots. Bottom line Transformers Animated Season 2 is a 10 out of 10 DVD experience that transformer fans of all ages will enjoy. I highly recommend Transformers Animated Season 2 to all transformer fans out there. Transformers Rule!!!,1328054400,4,1102,5.06043956043956

607055,5,6303248497,"I really like Transformers, a lot! I was there at the dawn of the G1 Series, and have seen almost every other (Japanese) Transformer series that followed, including the very bad attempts at adapting a few of these series for the U.S. Though none of these series were on par with even the slowest/silliest G1 Episodes! Beast Wars, & Transformers: Armada were fun, for the most part and had some of the ""spirit"" of the G1 series, but weren't quite there. Now we have the newest series: Transformers Animated. I saw some of the early designs for the ""new"" versions of the classic characters at the San Diego ComicCon a few years ago, and thought that they might be a little too cartoony, but they still looked kind of cool. Although, I still cannot stand Optimus Prime with a mouth!!! Anyway, I started watching this series with my nephews, and found myself really enjoying the stories (simple as they are), and the animation as well. The first season is good, and the second season is a bit better. So, if you haven't watched any of this series, please give it a try. You might enjoy it more than you think you would!",1246060800,12,1115,4.524752475247524
607056,4,6303248497,"The first season annoyed due to the human enemies and not enough robot action. The second season introduces the Elite Guard, which is pretty awesome in itself. There is even an episode that develops Bumblebee's and Bulkhead's background, which I thought was nice.

The characters all have personality, whether Autobot, Decepticon, or human. This series has action, comedy, and some drama.
I do not wish to spoil anything, but this series is a great series and keeps improving as it goes along. (The third season has also started, so do not miss it!)",1238716800,,549,4.903225806451613

In the end of Dark Awakening Optimus Prime orders the Autobot army to return to Cybertron, and heads towards a supernova to destroy the Quintisons.

The Quintisons pretty much oblitrate Primes space craft, and as you can see Optimus Prime nearly is blown away to pieces(missing half his face and missing an arm, etc..).

Now, in the Return of Optimus Prime when the two human space explorers/scientists find Optimus Prime, they find him completly restored as if the battle with the Quintisons never happend.

607155,4,6303248497,"After watching G.I.Joe cartoons from the same era, I was fully expecting to be disappointed watching my favorite cartoon as a child, the Transformers.
Imagine my surprise when I watched this first DVD! I was amazed at the quality of the dialogue and how well the animation holds up. Granted, there are numerous continuity errors, and there are numerous occasions where the animation is rushed. These flaws are obvious but don't really subtract from the whole package, nostalgic as it is.
If you watched this show as a child, you're going to enjoy them again with this DVD. Don't listen to the detractors about the extra sound effects as they're not noticeable in the least.
However, I would recommend that you save a little bit more and buy the Season 1 boxset.",1044144000,7,761,4.7727272727272725

607157,2,6303248497,"PICTURE QUALITY (2/5 STARS)
The overall image quality has definetly been improved: brighter colours, sharp images and heavy remastering (scratch removal, ect.) but WHAT HAVE THEY DONE?? They really made some devastating mistakes! Some scenes are played in reverse (i.e. the infamous Ironhide transformation scene from 'Heavy Metal War'), some visual heat-, smoke- and fire-effects are just missing!! And there is this mistake-documentation which should show the people what errors the original film masters had and that they have been corrected... they found the errors, but forgot(?) to correct many of them.
Sharpness and colour of the image deserve 5 STARS, but in fact of the errors 2 STARS is the proper rating!
SOUND QUALITY (2/5 STARS)
Generally the sound is very clear and free of hiss/crackles but WHAT HAVE THEY DONE...AGAIN?? They have remixed the soundtrack to Dolby Digital 5.1, initially that sounds brilliant but to reach this goal Rhino added some really strange&stupid soundeffects. Ok, the explosions have a great *boom* but gunfire sounds like children toy guns.
The Dolby Stereo soundtrack is another mess, some episodes have the new 5.1 remix simply downmixed to stereo, but others have the original soundtrack with no added effects. I believe every fan of the series demands at least an option to hear the original sountrack!
First a disappointment then you (have to) get used to it. Nothing more and nothing less.
EXTRAS (1/5 STARS)
No Extras included. You have to buy the Season 1 Box Set containing a fourth disc with all the extras. To match the Amazon-rating there is a 1-star rating because of the non-existent zero-star rating option.
SPECIAL/UNIQUE ON THIS DVD RELEASE:
- all new transfer from the original 35mm negative
- Dolby Digital 5.1 remix & Dolby Stereo
COMMENT:
I am a great fan of Transformers G1 and I would have loved to see the TFs in its original form, without remastering mistakes and additional soundeffects.
As a Transfan I also bought the UK boxset of season 1 which contains a lot of other worthy extras. The picture quality is not so sharp and brilliant but there are NO MISTAKES and errors. The soundtrack is the 5.1 remix from this US boxset. I highly recommend buying both editions or if you are not sure, just buy the UK Region 2 boxset if your DVD player is PAL-compatible!",1031097600,11,2328,4.956521739130435
607158,3,6303248497,"At least Rhino have decided to release Transformers on Dvd.
Here we have the first 5 episodes of the first season shown in 1984-85.
The Transformers live on the planet Cybertron. The Autobots(Good) are automobile transformers which espape on a ship to seek new sources of power. They are followed by the evil Decepticons plane transformers who wants the power to control the galaxy. Their ship crashes on the Earth and 4,000 millions years after the robots are activated and given the auto and plane presence.
The Decepticons plans to get all the Earth power resources to made cubicals of energy and return to Cybertron to control the galaxy which the Autobots must impide in order to protect Earth and all humankind.
The Dvd transfer is ok but the sound despite is Dolby 5.1 sounds a bit scratchy sometimes and fades also.
There isn't any subtitle or caption nor a Spanish audio track avaliable on the Dvd so that's why I give only 3 stars of 5.
Resuming a good title based on a classic cartoon of the mid 80's with no extras  nor subtitles.

To battle this threat, Prime must team up with his oldest enemy, Galvatron, and the two leaders must retrieve a metal which is resistant to the infection. The metal can then be used to help Optimus reclaim the Matrix. Only it is now possessed by an infected Rodimus Prime.

607232,5,6303248497,"Many moons ago, the powers that be decided to revamp the Transformers line by killing off many of the original characters, while introducing new ones, in Transformers The Movie.  Unfortunately it backfired, mostly because they killed off one of the favorite characters, Optimus Prime.
This 2-part series seeks to remedy that mistake.  Optimus Primes' body is found floating in Space towards the sun, when it is hijacked by scientists who plan to use it as a weapon by implanting it with a highly infectious Virus that makes living beings hate and destroy (everything).  Failing to do this, the virus is accidentally spread across Earth.  ....  The mood while watching this is very heightened due to the Virus, which is spread simply by touch.  This mini-movie stars Optimus Prime, Rodimus Prime, Wreck-Gar, Sky-Lynx, Spike, and shows the transformation of Bumblebee to Goldbug.
The Animation is fairly good, considering it was made for television.  It is of much higher quality than the series at that time, but not nearly as good as the Movie.  Clearly some parts were rushed, but overall the animation was better than average (it reminds me of original Transformers series before the movie).
The sound is as can be expected.  All the original voices are there, from Bumblebee to Sky-Lynx, and the everlasting Peter Cullen returning as Optimus Prime.

607241,5,6303248497,"This is a great video watch for those who were disappointed with Optimus Prime's deaths in Transformers the movie and in the TF episode "" Dark Awakening."" This is the sequel to the TF movie. If you saw the film you have to see this video! The year was 1987,The producers of the show Marvel/ Sunbow productions decided they had made a mistake by killing the main character off the genre and dismissing him. Fan backlash was so popular, the Transformers lost popularity, The Movie did poorly in the Box office, and the ratings on the T.V. show had dropped immensly. In an effort to save the Transformers franchise this two-part episode was created to correct that mistake. Unfortunely, at that time the Return of Optimus Prime did not save the franchise as expected but it did save the a-lot of Transformers fans from disappointment. Those who remember the show on Television know how good it was to see Optimus Prime back and to see him intract with Season 3 characters like Rodimus Prime, Kup,Blurr, Galvatron, and Sky Lynx. It was a real treat. The animation and story was much better then the usual material from most of Season 3! To anyone who grew up in the 1980s this is a can't miss video to add to your collection and to your childhood memories! The voice talents where also cool! Peter Cullen, Frank Walker, Dan GilveZman, Jack Angel, Dick Guatier, and B. J. Ward who played the character Jessica Morgan.

Two evil scientists use optimus` shell to lure the decepticons and autobots so they can be infected with a desease called the spores. A quentisson is brought over to repair the shell because hes the only hope. THe spores spreads and just about everyone gets it. AS optimus goes into the matrix his body is covered in an alloy to prevent him from getting the spores. He eventually uses the matrix to get rid of the spores. I've loved these episodes because they bring back my favorite autobot of all OPTIMUS PRIME. These episodes are very simular to the episode with the rust plauge. That was about the decpticons finding an old autobot colony which destroyed itself with its oun secreate weapon which caused robots to rust. Unfortunatly, the machine activated and killed the colony. After the hologram told them this the decticons take it back to earth and use it on auto bot headquarters. Superion eventually destroys it and the rust is cured by i think wrachet. It resembled a bee which wings opened causeing the plauge. The episode i just metioned is what this tape reminded me of. Both r stories where a plauge causes proublems.

These feelings were confirmed by  the movie. If the writers  wanted a good ending to this movie, they would have had Megatron dying  instead of Optimus, instead they let Optimus die and let the drama between  the Autobots and Deceptocons go on and on. Now for this tape, I thought  Optimus was going to be revived to kick Galvatron's butt, but instead he is  revived only to stop a plague that is infecting the autobots and  deceptocons. The animation wasn't close to the Movie, and just the fact  that Optimus had to go to Galvatron for help, was the nail in the coffin.  These guys were enemies, not friends.

The two-part ""Return of Optimus Prime"" episode not only  brought back one of the fan-favorite original Transformers, but featured  the never-thought-of slugfest between the two Primes: Rodimus and Optimus.  For those of you who don't know the background for this story, here's the  idea in a nutshell:  Optimus's body was placed in a shp and launched into  space.  The ship was about to collide with the sun when his body was  rescued by two human scientists, one of whom has a mad-on for ALL  Transformers due to an accident caused by Prime and Megatron.  The  scientists were testing a prototype metal that could withstand even the  heat of the sun from up close and personal.  However, they also discover a  spore that causes widespread hate and anger.  After a minor accident  involving the Autobot/Decepticon battle and a scientist's daughter, the  father and the transformer-hater lure the autobots into a trap, with  Prime's body as bait, and infect them with the ""Hate Plague.""  But, the plague infects the Decepticons, the humans, even the Quintessons'  lackeys the Sharticons.  Even Rodimus gets infected.  With only a few  remaining transforemers untainted by the spores, there's only one option:  revive Optimus and find a cure.  A quintesson reluctantly revives Optimus  and uses the heat-proof alloy to make him impervious to the spores and a  battle royale follows for the matrix.  the best part of this is not only  Optimus's return to leadership duty, but the playing of ""The  Touch"" by Stan Rush from the Movie.

But now Sunbow and Kid Rhino are releasing this classic in the United States. And they're available here at Amazon.com!  <--- web site plug :-) Volume two of the series in this set features two  classic - however incompatible - episodes. A couple of brief nitpicky  issues... 1) This volume combines a season two pre-film episode with a  season three post-film episode... it's a tad unsettling to myself as a  pre-film G1 fanatic to see two COMPLETELY different casts on back-to-back  episodes, as a harsh reminder to the fact that with the exception of  Starscream, EVERY ONE of my favorite characters were killed in the movie.  But at least Kup is there, and you gotta love Kup. 2) ""Dark  Awakening"" may be a prequel to the excellent ""Return of Optimus  Prime"" 2-parter, but this episode is about the worst-written and most  poorly-executed episode in the series. More on that in the  synopsis...""The Search for Alpha Trion"" gives a rare peek at the  more human element of the Transformers. We learn that even Optimus Prime's,  Inferno's and Ironhide's hearts are not impervious to the heartwarming  nature of female autobots, and we also learn a key element in the story of  Prime's Origin. It seems that male and female autobots are programmed to  co-exist, and even ""desire"" each other! Talk about your character  twist, but it was pulled off well. And Alpha Trion, with his long life,  experience and wisdom well-worn by his uniform and robot beard, is quite  possibly the coolest-looking Autobot we've ever seen.""Dark  Awakening"" takes place after the TF Movie. While escaping from the  chase of the increasingly-insane Galvatron, the crew of an autobot shuttle  (Rodimus, Kup, Arcee, Daniel and others) stumble upon the memorial ship  built to house the honored bodies of those Autobots who died in the great  war, and they discover the Oprimus Prime, somehow or another, has been  resurrected to life. Naturally, since this takes place after the movie, the  characters are almost completely different. But as a sweet bit of  continuity, we are honorably reminded of some of our old autobot heroes as  young Daniel Witwicky reads off their names from holding chambers in the  spacecruiser. Prime's dead-bot-walking chassis is definitely spooky, and  when Daniel turned to see Prime's mangled body standing amidst a bolt of  lightning, this fan's heart skipped a beat! My only two complaints are 1)  as a Prime-fan, Prime's screams of pain and inner torment seemed unfitting  for such a legendary transformer. One could argue that this was the nature  of Prime's brainwashing by the Quintessons. Nevertheless it was painful to  this Prime-fan to see my childhood hero's dignity bruised so  greatly. Grimlock also seems dumber in this episode than ever before (even  before the much-needed memory upgrades!) QUINTESSONS!  ME GRIMLOCK THUMP  QUINTESSONS! ARGH! .... Oh the humanity, what HAVE they done to Grimlock's  dialogue? :-)Considering the fact that this is Transformers we're talking  about, it's hard to give it any less than a five-star rating, however I  guess I'll take fan's license and dock the video one star for some nitpicky  points. Nevertheless, I recommend this video highly for your TF collection.  These are two pivotal episodes in the life of our favorite robots!

The  animation is lower quality and most of the voices have changed. Although  lacking in these areas it is Transformers so it really doesnt matter.
