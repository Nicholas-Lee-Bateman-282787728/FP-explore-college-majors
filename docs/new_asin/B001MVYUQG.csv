This is a well done movie made for TV that is good for the whole family. It has drama, comedy, horror, and a mix of just good old sentimentality.",1234137600,,344,7.82051282051282
3701569,5,B001MVYUQG,The Librarian series is MUST SEE TV at its best.  When the video wasteland is filled with reality shows I look forward each year when Flynn goes off on another adventure.  And there so many entertaining and informative possibilities with this series they MUST go on and on and on.  I'd like to see more books if the movies are going to stop.  And I'd like to see more of the Library maybe even with compulation books about the Library and Flynn written by readers.  To the powers that be...Don't Drop the ball on this.  Give the PEOPLE what they want....for once.,1234051200,,563,4.470588235294118
3701570,5,B001MVYUQG,I love The Librarian! All of them! Hope they can come up with more ideas for more movies!,1233446400,,89,4.0
3701571,5,B001MVYUQG,"I stumbled on the second Librarian movie by accident one night and after watching it was very impressed. When I heard the 3rd movie being advertised on tv I couldn't wait to see it. Afterward I ordered 1 & 2 so I could watch them over and over. To me, they're a wonderful mix of Indiana Jones & Davinci Code. Noah Wyle is a superb actor (I'm an ER fan) and he brings much charisma to his role. I've always loved Jane Curtin and Bob Newhart and these 3 together are a magical team. I'm pre-ordering Curse of the Judas Chalice so I can have the set at my disposal for frequent viewing. All 3 are entertainment at its best!",1231891200,,620,4.175

This one didn't seem to have the spirit of the first 2 movies, however it was a refreshing change to get out of the jungles and such and into the swamps filled with pirate ships, vampires, tombs, amulets and the full intention of making 100 more sequels.",1231286400,5,523,4.336734693877551
3701573,5,B001MVYUQG,"This is the third of the ""Librarian"" TV movies with Noah Wyle and I think they keep improving each time out.  With all the vampire movies and books out there right now, it must have seemed only natural to pit Flynn against the undead and it did not disappoint! Action, humor and mystery in good combination. Bob Newhart and Jane Curtain were excellent as always and Excaliber had a very nice scene. That sword has definitely become a character in itself! The only downer is that I kept hearing that this was the final one and I'm really hoping that either I heard wrong or they change their mind! Great production values and good FX but these movies are definitely story and character-driven.  Make more please!!",1230422400,39,712,4.642857142857143
3701574,4,B001MVYUQG,"- An outraged Flynn Carsen (on having his tuxedo shirt ripped during a sword duel): ""This is rented!""
- His evil (yet urbane) opponent: ""Of course it is.""

It's always a guilty pleasure catching up with the Librarian, whose job is to guard history's secret relics and treasures, some of these magical in nature and all stowed away in the hidden chambers of the Metropolitan Library of New York. Flynn Carsen is sort of like a modern-day Indiana Jones, except that he's awkward and plenty nerdy. But Flynn does keep his wits about him, and, after years of holding down the Librarian gig, he now boasts experience and smidgens of confidence. This current Librarian may fumble about some, but it's always fun seeing how he'll get out of whatever scrape.

The more things change... The movie opens with Flynn at a posh event applying the finishing touches to his tuxedo. He then navigates down a stairway,  sips champagne, and then does a spit take with the champagne. Which goes to show that, even after all this time, Flynn Carsen is still refreshingly hapless. But, after this latest escapade, which climaxes in a sword fight, Flynn Carsen is officially burnt out (his girlfriend dumping him has something to do with it). Back at the library, by virtue of sheer grousing, he gets himself some time off and ends up flying to New Orleans, all gigged out in bow tie and panama hat. So, as they say in the Big Easy, laissez les bon temps roullez.

Or not. The holiday rapidly turns into a desperate relic hunt, with Flynn taking on ex-KGB agents, voodoo magic, and the undead. Along the way, he partners up with a mysterious chanteuse to rescue a kidnapped scientist. The relic in question is the rumored Judas Chalice, of which origin dates back to Judas Iscariot and his 30 pieces of silver. The chalice reeks of malice but holds the brew that is true - that is, if you're a vampire in need of resurrecting. And, since those ex-KGB agents have unearthed the coffin of Vlad Dracul, you can see where this is going.

What I like best about TNT's Librarian series is that it's not at all pretentious. It wallows in its unabashed cheesiness and farce, even as it hunkers down with a pretty good adventure story. THE LIBRARIAN: CURSE OF THE JUDAS CHALICE is the third in the series, and it doesn't disappoint its fans. Hokey fun, mythical artifacts, indecipherable manuscripts, supernatural villains, and a likable, nebbish, talky hero (even the bad guys complain of his always talking in paragraphs). By now, Noah Wyle's got his part down cold. The neat thing about his character is that he can do something heroic but, then, subsequently have the rug pulled out from under him. And, when this happens, he's so damn good-natured about it.

Flynn has had a hard time keeping his lady loves. First Nicole (Sonya Walger), then Emily Davenport (Gabrielle Anwar). This time out, Wyle's romantic interest is exotic Stana Katic, who plays bluesy singer Simone Renoir with femme fatale nuances. Maybe she's a keeper. Or not. Meanwhile, Jane Curtin and Bob Newhart (at his stammering best) are again solidly on board as the museum directors.

I never thought I'd ever say this, but I had a better time with THE LIBRARIAN: CURSE OF THE JUDAS CHALICE than with that last Indiana Jones flick. This movie, like its predecessors (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Librarian-Quest-for-the-Spear/dp/B0009NSCRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Librarian - Quest for the Spear</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Librarian-Return-to-King-Solomon-s-Mines/dp/B000IJ7A24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Librarian  - Return to King Solomon's Mines</a>) are tongue-in-cheek throwbacks to those high adventure pictures churned out back in the 1930s, '40s and '50s. I don't think I'm reaching that much when I say that even the score here is rousing enough that it actually reminded me of those Errol Flynn swashbucklers. But, of course, Flynn Carsen is no Errol Flynn. Errol doesn't know the Dewey Decimal System.",1229299200,102,4067,5.198473282442748

3701656,5,B001MVYUQG,"The 3rd of 3 Made for TV movies that easily could have been a theater release.

I liked the movie. A few years ago when we still had Cable TV, I caught a few episodes of the TV Series ""The Librarians"" and recently bought the first 2 seasons to watch when I stumbled across the 3 movies. I opted to purchase the movies and have now watched the last of the 3 movies with the family and we all enjoyed it. I am glad that I will watch the movies first because it adds a lot of backstory to the Library and the characters. It's sort of like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Romancing the stone but I think it is better.

Jane Curtain & Bob Newhart reprise their roles and Flynn ends up in New Orleans searching for the Judas Chalice, and falls in love with a french singer who turns out to be a vampire (Stana Katic of Castle fame). I liked the movie a lot and am now looking forward to the rest of the series (Seasons 1, 2 and 3). We also learn more about the library and how it came to be.",1485216000,2,981,3.9494949494949494

3701750,5,B001MVYUQG,It is hard to find a family show that the family can watch that is enjoyable to both adults and children alike. This is one of those shows. The librarian uses his intellectual power to search for magical items that have real world historical significance. This has inspired my child to learn about King Arthur and many other historical things. This action/adventure story full of action without being plagued by violence and while the storylines are a bit far fetched the story seams together well and is interesting and fun. A cross between Indiana Jones and Sherlock Holmes.,1467763200,,576,4.887755102040816

3701818,3,B001MVYUQG,"I watched this movie for Kate Beckett's actress playing a (spoiler!) vampire with a heavy french accent, and I was not disappointed in that regard. It was hilarious and she was adorable. This movie, however, is heavy-handed and rife with racial stereotypes. The main character also gets dumped by a long term girlfriend, meets a new girl like a week later maximum, and over the course of three days falls so deeply in love that he offers to spend eternity with her. Uh-huh. Sure. Also, like, they wrote her out so awkwardly at the end? Are we really not done with vampire sun suicides? She couldn't just run off and join a travelling choir quartet or something? Nope, she was a loose end, can't have those hanging around. Ugh. Also, the special effects are rather hokey and dated, but I suppose that can't be helped. Still, a moderately enjoyable ride. And the Librarian series is beloved for its cheesiness, after all.",1447718400,,919,4.714285714285714

I rarely write reviews for movies I rent/purchase, since everyone's taste is different. But this was awful. The story seeks to have an ""Indiana Jones"" vibe. It falls flat. Storyline is awful.

3701895,3,B001MVYUQG,"After the second Librarian movie went some strange places, I fully prepared myself for more craziness in The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice.  Sadly, this third made for TV movie went even further afield.

The movie opens with Flynn Carsen (Noah Wyle) on another life and death quest to save the world.  This time, hes in London at an auction bidding on an antique vase.  What he really wants is inside it, however, The Philosophers Stone.  While he succeeds at this mission, it costs him his current girlfriend.  Fed up, he goes on a rant when he gets home, and Judson and Charlene (Bob Newhart and Jane Curtin) suggest he take some of his unused vacation time.

However, after a couple of days, he finds himself growing bored.  After being encouraged to follow his dreams, he dreams of a beautiful woman in New Orleans.  Inspired to go visit the city, he actually finds her singing in a lounge in the city and learns her name is Simone (Stana Katic).  However, when people start chasing them, he hears a story of the Judas chalice and its connection to Judas Iscariot who some believe to be the first vampire.  Is any of it true?  Can he find it if it is?

Yes, you read that right.  This one involves yet another weird history for a Biblical character.  Somehow, this one just went too far for me.  If they had kept it about Vampires and not brought any connection into the Bible into it, I probably would have gone along with it.  However, this strange connection just made me uneasy and I couldn't quite enjoy it as a result.

Which is a shame because it is filled with the same fun as the first two films.  There are laughs and quips and action as Flynn once again must battle the forces of evil to save the world.  The plot has some great twists to it and really does have good entertainment to it, if you can get past the part of the premise I couldn't accept.

The effects are better than the previous film, although they still aren't completely up to big screen standards.  Then again, this is a made for TV budget, so that can be understood and forgiven.

The acting is pretty good as well.  I had a bit of trouble with Stana Katics heavy accent early on, but as the movie went along I was able to understand her better.  While the rest of the cast was great, I especially enjoyed seeing her in this since the next year, she went on to star as Kate Beckett in Castle, as show I still absolutely love.

So if you don't have the hang up I do with the premise, you will enjoy The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice.  There is some entertainment here; I just couldn't completely get past the premise.",1435104000,2,2616,4.373443983402489

3702022,1,B001MVYUQG,"I really don't understand the hype.  And, I am not exaggerating one bit. This movie is definite 70s or 80s television fare with its choppy (insert a commercial break) editing, fuzzy, washed out cinematography, and VERY hackneyed, predictable, and corny writing and sets. For instance, how many times have we seen a sword fight by two opponents in tuxedos down the steps of a museum as they banter back and forth nonsensically? A big yawn, folks. I expected to get more entertainment value for my bucks since I paid to see an Amazon movie. As it stands, any old A-Team, Tales From The Crypt, Moonlighting, or McGyver episode, with the accompanying film quality degradation, would be preferable. Even a free You Tube movie beats this!

3702027,4,B001MVYUQG,"The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice is the last of the Librarian (movie) trilogy.  (After that came the television series.)  In Judas Chalice, Flynn has been dumped by his most recent girlfriend.  Let's hear it: aaahhhh.  He takes a long needed vacation and ends up in The Big Easy where he meets Canadian hottie, Stana Katic as a vampire cum jazz singer, Simone.

The Judas Chalice, it is said, has the ability to revive Count Vlad and create serious bad ju-ju and mojo for the rest of the world.  Of course, Flynn won't have that.  His girl du jour, Simone, exposes herself to Flynn as a vampire created by Vlad.  She had been the keeper of a piece of the puzzle which would lead to the cup.  Guess what?  There's pirates, too!  Yes, good ole Jean Lafitte has the chalice in his treasure chest onboard his ship in Morgan's Bay.

Directed by Jonathan Frakes, these are campy movies with fun action, great zingers of one liners and pretty decent acting.  It's suitable for the entire family and should make a family movie night well worthwhile.",1419552000,2,1050,4.580645161290323

The fact I have now purchased all three movies and am committed to the series tells you my opinion. The reason I have pushed this to five stars is that I am a solid fan of Stana Katic.

Just like the ex Dr. Kildare Richard Chamberlain also good looking & nice doing his Indiana Jones impersonation in the Alan Quartermaine movies. Well it's 2014 & Mr. Wyle is the star of the hugely popular TNT series Falling Skies. Sooooo you might want to rewatch the 3 Librarian movies before the debut of the new series Sunday Dec 7th. on TNT. And yes Noah Wyle produces & has a recurring role in the new series.

Not as good as the second movie -- moved in a disjointed way between topics and incidents without much of a unifying theme.

Finally Flynn has the last bid of f1,000,000. Sold to Flynn. Charlene faints to the floor. Upon paying the bid, Flynn breaks the vase and finds the Philosopher's Stone inside. Ivan wants the stone and attempts to kill Flynn for it. How will Flynn get out of this?
  Well, back at the Metropolitan Public Library, Flynn gets a talking to from Charlene. The amount is way to high to pay, but then is shown another another secret large part of the library. it contains Noah's Ark and the Fountain of Youth.

3702115,5,B001MVYUQG,"I thoroughly enjoyed the entire librarian series, and as always, the disc that I purchased through Amazon. Worked as it should. I had no problems with it. The price, the quality and the shipping were all top-notch. There were 3 movies and the librarian series, and even though they were originally made for TV. They are pretty well done, if you enjoy the Raiders of the lost Ark series or Indiana Jones whichever one you would like to call it, you'll enjoy this. Although this movie and the 2 others that go with it are in the same category as Indiana Jones they are very different. This is the 3rd of the 3 movies the last one that they made. I do recommend that you purchase at least the librarian the spear of destiny because this movie is based as a continuation of that one. The 3 movies are the spear of destiny, King Solomon's mines, curse of the Judas chalice in that order. And yes I recommend this movie, I truly recommend that you watch the other 2, 1st. That way you will have the continuity feel the only complaint that I have is that they never made any more.",1399248000,,1073,4.343283582089552

3702118,4,B001MVYUQG,"Noah Wylie, Bob Newhart, Jane Curtin, and Stana Katic make this a very enjoyable, light-hearted adventure film.  There are two more films in this series, only Wylie, Curtin, and Newhart reprise their roles.",1397433600,,206,5.242424242424242

3702120,5,B001MVYUQG,"Of the three ""The Librarian"" movies, this one is my favorite.  It has quite a twist at the end, but I won't divulge that for those who have never seen the movie.  A little bit of romance, gothic and adventure mixed together. Recommended.",1393632000,,237,4.488372093023256
3702121,5,B001MVYUQG,"I saw all three librarian movies when they were first shown on TV. I always wanted to have all three in my DVD collection. This was my last one to find. Funny, lighthearted movies.",1393632000,,180,4.323529411764706
3702122,5,B001MVYUQG,Purchasing this movie completed the set for me. I have enjoyed it immensely. Would recommend it to anyone who likes Indiana Jones or the short lived Relic series.,1393459200,,162,4.821428571428571
3702123,5,B001MVYUQG,It's nice to have the whole series when I want to have my own marathon. love this series and wish they would make more movies! A nice quirky side to the Indiana Jones movies!,1392422400,,174,4.147058823529412
3702124,5,B001MVYUQG,"The cast, Noah Wyle, Stana Katic, Bob Newhart, and Jane Curtain, is funny and attractive, and the story is a delightful romp in spooky dark places in New Orleans, running away from bungling Russian agents and a demon who want the chalice to turn their army into zombies who never die! And, Stana Katic is so lovely, it hurts to look at her (presently playing tv series Castle).  She turns out to be a 400-year old benevolent vampire who helps to find the judas chalice for bob Newhart's museum.",1392422400,,494,4.550561797752809

3702126,5,B001MVYUQG,A charming little DVD with a great story and characters. Similar to the Indiana Jones films without the whip and the hat. Stunning Stana Katic (TVs Castle) is the lovely lady in distress in this film with Noah Wylie as the librarian. Fun for all ages with great settings and tongue-in-cheek humor. My librarian daughter has tried to collect all of these.,1392163200,,354,4.725806451612903
3702127,5,B001MVYUQG,"I have all 3 Librarian movies and wish there were more.

These are really fun to watch.  Enough of thrill, expectation, and suspense to keep you wondering ""What is Next?"".

There is almost no violence and when there is some it is almost comical.

I think the only dull part is the Librarian always knows the answer, never has to think about the solution or hesitate for the answer.

But he does end up in enough trouble you wonder how will he get out of this one.

I like it.",1391817600,,475,4.222222222222222

3702130,5,B001MVYUQG,This movie is the third movie. I like the movie because it has a light and dark side mixture. Not a big budget production but a good family movie. Would recommend this movie to watch and purchase.,1391299200,,196,4.324324324324325
3702131,5,B001MVYUQG,"I have seen this many times on the TV but just had to purchase the DVD. The scenery in New Orleans, the music that she sings and the underlying love story are just great. Of, course good wins out at the end but also you learn sometimes the love story.",1391299200,,251,4.04
3702132,5,B001MVYUQG,Noah Wyle is a funny guy and does a good job here as well as the others.  I've liked seeing Bob Newhart in the series as well.  His deadpan deliveries are fun and play nicely to Wyle's character.  Enjoy!,1391040000,,203,4.153846153846154
3702133,5,B001MVYUQG,This is a great movie to watch if you are fascinated with historical facts with a comedy twist with other forms of make believe creatures that make this an wonderful film for the entire family,1390780800,,192,4.514285714285714
3702134,5,B001MVYUQG,"The only thing wrong with this movie is that there are no more in this series.  I love all ""The Librarian"" movies and I wish they would do more of them.  In this the librarian once more has to retrieve a legendary object and return it to the library. In the course of his quest he meets a real vampire and Vlad the Impaler himself! (If you don't know, Vlad was the insperation for Dracula! In fact he was called Dracula.) Once again he has to overcome any number of difficulties to win the object he's after.

3702138,5,B001MVYUQG,"We love these movies.  Yes, the characters aren't deep, but they're not supposed to be, as it's a comedic action movie.  Very engaging, excellent pacing, and enjoyable characters that you quickly enjoy and want to find out what happens to them next.",1388707200,,249,4.904761904761905

3702141,5,B001MVYUQG,"Once more the Librarian is on the move.  This is my personal favorite of the three movies.  I love the location, the story line, and the characters, especially his new love interest, she is so coo!  Fun, exciting, thrilling, great humor and overall just a nice movie to watch any time!  A great purchase!!!",1388188800,,306,4.611111111111111
3702142,5,B001MVYUQG,"A fun movie for those who love to be entertained. The third in the series, it is probably the best of the three. The Librarian is tricked into going on vacation in New Orleans where he trips over a case involving - vampires! Now he must try to track down the Judas Chalice before they can! I'm not one to care what extras are on a DVD so I can't give any details. The playback is great however. Buy, watch, enjoy!",1387929600,,413,4.111111111111111

3702146,4,B001MVYUQG,"I'm from New Orleans so I always get a kick out of movies and tv shows that mangle my city. You have to laugh, it's Hollywood. Aside from some obvious flaws in New Orleans geography, it was still fun. I was a little thrown by the whole vampire angle but hey why not? You watch a movie to take yourself out of reality, this does that. It campy fun, until it breaks your heart near the end.",1383782400,,388,4.0519480519480515
3702147,5,B001MVYUQG,This movie was great as were the other 2.  I hope one day that they will make more.  Great Innovative Action.,1382918400,,109,4.142857142857143

3702150,4,B001MVYUQG,"Third instalment of The Librarian TV movie franchise.  Noah Wylie is a semi-naive, over educated new Librarian charged with guarding lore and artifacts like Excalber and the Ark of the Covenant.

This movie deals with the cup used by Judas at the Last Supper and is set primarily in New Orleans.  Things start to get interesting with the addition of a guardian, other seekers of the cup and a good dose of the supernatural.

Well worth the watching, as are the first two films.",1381017600,,477,4.642857142857143
3702151,5,B001MVYUQG,I like the different twists in the story.  The action is great and well executed.  So glad I have all of them and wish they made more but Bob Newhart was getting a little too old to continue and no one could take His place.,1380672000,,223,3.933333333333333

3702158,5,B001MVYUQG,Funny and Noah Wylie does a good job and so does Bob Newhart.  These are my kind of movies to watch,1377734400,,99,3.7142857142857144
3702159,3,B001MVYUQG,"The movie was OK, but a sexy good vampire vs. the bad vampires, really?  Even in a fantasy vehicle like this that seems a bit out there.  Newhart and Wiley are funny together in New Orleans, one of the better moments of the film in my opinion.

A caution for parents of younger family members who may want to watch this because of Stana Katic.  It is about vampires with accompanying violence. Another cautionary note for parents; they always had Stana's chest partially exposed either with low cut or unbuttoned tops even in this made for TV movie. Her dress in this movie was so tight you could see her reach down and pull it up just to be able to run in the action scenes.  I couldn't help but wonder how many takes it took in those scenes to get one where her dress actually stayed up and covered her that they could show.

I viewed this only to see Stana in an early venture that I was able to watch.  She definitely can sing which is another amazing GOD given talent she has been blessed with.  The character role allowed her to show some skills especially in the tender close up scenes.  I especially enjoyed her final scene, that is the Stana we all became enamored with in Castle.

Stana is a beautiful young lady, I like her acting very much, her talent is abundant and is a real throw back to the actresses of the 40's and early 50's who projected the emotions and feelings with a pose of posture a facial expression or a line said in a particular manner.  She can do the same (like she did in the first season of Castle), but today's Hollywood wants the female leads to swear like porn stars, speak with regular vulgarity, and expose body parts to the world.  No young lady should be made to do that just to work.  Stana is way to talented to have to do that, but it doesn't seem to matter to those in charge that her younger fans especially the young girls who idolize her watch and listen to what she says, what she does, and what she wears.  They don't care about them.

I pray that Stana or someone close to her will realize very soon how talented she really is and stop all this other nonsense and provide scripts and vehicles for her to really stretch and use the talent she has been blessed with.  Stana is so much better than what she has had to work in thus far in her film career.

I look forward to the time when I can view a movie with Stana in the female lead and enjoy the film and her character where I won't feel like I need a shower after sitting through it because of all the filth the movie industry throws at the viewing public today.

The entire librarian series seems well-produced, with likeable characters. Little cursing (of the vocabulary type), and family friendly entertainment.

If you like Indiana Jones type of adventure stories but with a light humorous touch to the story, these movies are for you. These were all made for tv movies and the level of production sophistication is surprising. The story, the scenes and the stunts are much better than you would expect in a low budget film (not perfect but many steps above most made for tv movies).

3702205,4,B001MVYUQG,"Firstly, although lower budget than the Indianna Jones films of the same type of storyboard it is not chintzy or distracting from the movie.

The hero is interesting and entertaining in what appears to be the last of the trilogy, as he portrays life's effects upon us all.

He needs a vacation from saving the world after his girlfriends disasterous telephone timing - something we've probably all done without being privelaged to be aware on the day.

Vacation obtained after the temper tantrum many of us might wish we could throw at work the poor man finds there is actually no way he can escape either work or love, even while on vacation.

One could say that workwise his cup runneth over while the his love life returned with something of a bite, working its way towards poingnancy.

The writers did a good job with this, there's everything from voodoo to vampires woven into the storyline, but well woven. The special effects are above average for this type of film, the acting varies from deadpan to hilarious but is consistently of better than average quality - and New Orleans is always an excellent backdrop.

I've now purchased the other two in the series - no, they're not Indiana Jones but for some they're possibly even more enjoyable, for the rest of us they're simply excellent entertainment and great for a quiet evening when a more action orientated family film is desirable.",1324771200,,1394,4.763485477178423
3702206,4,B001MVYUQG,This movie was not as good as the last two but it still had its merits. I thought it was a sad ending. And that perhaps the damsel could have been around to help the librarian.,1318636800,,176,3.9166666666666665
3702207,5,B001MVYUQG,"If you enjoyed Indiana Jones, you'll love The Librarian, too. He's witty, nerdy, at times accident prone, and he's Noah Wyle. With Bob Newhart and Jane Curtain rounding out the cast, the fun multiplies; and Stana Katic was great as Flynn Carsen's vampire love interest! The other two ""Librarian"" movies: ""Quest for the Spear"" and ""Return to King Solomon's Mines"" are great, but personally, I think ""Curse of the Judas Chalice"" is the best of the three! It has everything you could possibly want on a boring TV night: Action! Romance! Vampires! Humor! Cheese! All in all, it's wonderfully fun, light entertainment not to be taken seriously, and minus all the blood and gore that's already out there in almost everything else.",1314230400,,724,4.942622950819672
3702208,5,B001MVYUQG,"A friend of mine recommended this TV movie as the best of the series of 3 about ""The Librarian,"" a fantasy adventure that makes me almost wish such magical wonders did really lurk behind the card catalog files and closed doors at the New York Public Library!  Being a big fan of ""Castle"" star Stana Katic also made this film a must-see for me, and her remarkably different character in this (and her surprising good singing voice in a sultry and haunting ballad) add even more to my appreciation.  Some people compare this to the Indiana Jones movies or the H. Rider Haggard movies, but this is really different enough in its own quirky way to stand alone on its own merits.  With good comedic touches by veterans Bob Newhart and Jane Curtin that add to the fun but never overwhelm, spoofs without being campy and is scary enough to make you worry about the main characters.  I would love to see more like this one!",1312243200,,915,4.493975903614458
3702209,5,B001MVYUQG,"I was in the very beginning of this movie in the first two scenes. The movie was filmed in New Orleans. I had so much fun with my other cast members, Noah and the crew. Enjoy the show all!",1311465600,,188,3.8461538461538463
3702210,4,B001MVYUQG,"The third entry in the Librarian franchise in many ways lives up to the standards set by the first two. There is an interesting and exciting story with great action, great characterization, and wonderful touches of humor. The romantic element is also present. Stana Katic absolutely burns out the pixels on the widescreen. She was perfectly cast. Bob Newhart and Jane Curtin are great supporting characters.

But in a number of respects this was a disappointment. First, the introduction of fantasy creatures (vampires) takes the series in an undesirable direction. I understand that vampires have been all the rage for the last few years but I think the move to horror elements is a mistake. I had similar misgivings about aliens being introduced into the Indiana Jones series - it just doesn't feel right. I think the ghosts seen in Return to King Solomon's Mines is about as far in the direction of fantasy creatures as this series should go.

Second, this film doesn't involve the same amount of globetrotting as the first two. All the action is in New Orleans. There is an opening scene in London but it probably wasn't filmed there. Each succeeding film in this series seems to do less and less location shooting. Maybe the budgets are too tight?

Additionally, the extras were fairly lame. The deleted scenes are more properly described as deleted lines.

But maybe that's just me. Despite the above, I enjoyed the film and look forward to future entries in the series. Recommended for fans of fantasy adventure.",1296604800,,1519,4.898832684824903

3702213,4,B001MVYUQG,"This movie definitely keeps the franchise strong.  As always, the characters are good and well developed.  The acting is just as good as any other movie I see.  You don't notice that you are watching a made-for-TV movie until except for a couple fade-outs where you think ""I'll bet there was a commercial break right here.""  But that is a very small gripe and it's really not that noticeable.

If they make a 4th installment I'll be watching that one too.  This is just a great modern-day adventure series.",1284076800,,506,4.629213483146067
3702214,5,B001MVYUQG,"Delivered in good condition and promptly.  This is the third movie in ""The Librarian"" series.  I own all three now.  The librarian has become a little bored with his job and decides to take a vacation in New Orleans where he meets a female vampire.  She's a good vampire and together they stop an evil vampire from controlling the world.  The added comedy in these action movies is really cute.  I purchased the 2nd and the 3rd movies of the series from amazon.com  I am always satisfied with my purchases.  Anytime my friend says she is trying to find something, I suggest amazon.com. I always find what I need from there.  It's gotten to be an ongoing joke.  ""I want to find....""  Just go to amazon.com",1282953600,,704,4.507936507936508
3702215,5,B001MVYUQG,"You wouldn't think Noah Wylie could carry a comedy-adventure series, but you'd be wrong, because he has. Not only that, the series manages to be fun and exciting, without gratuitous violence, sex, or swearing. The casting is excellent, with Bob Newhart and Jane Curtain in wonderfully understated roles, and the plots are interesting. Yes, the movies are low budget, but so what? Exercise your imagination! Remember Buckaroo Banzai? Now there was a low budget adventure film! As far as the third Librarian episode is concerned, the story may not be quite as strong as the first, but the characterization of the main characters is gradually deepening, and I think over time many more people will realize how strong this series is becoming. The third film is obviously setting up a fourth, and my intuition says that may be the last, but I hope not -- keep them coming! The bottom line here is that all three Librarian movies are wonderful escapist family entertainment. That's to be treasured these days.",1282089600,,1003,4.940828402366864
3702216,2,B001MVYUQG,"Sad to say,this DVD is a big waste of time. Noah Wiley tries to be quirky and charming but fails miserably because he doesn't balance these traits with any personal strength and authority. Echoing at different times James Bond, Indiana Jones and Harry Potter his character seems weak , derivative and unsympathetic. The plot has lots of holes and tries to do too much without sufficiently building suspense. The other characters seem even shallower than the Librarian.(Makes me really appreciate the old B-movies. )  The story takes some childish turns with the writers wanting us to believe that a magic sword (Excalibur) is the Librarian's ""best friend"".( Yuh). Not charming in the least. Avoid this.",1277683200,,702,5.104347826086957

3702227,5,B001MVYUQG,"With today's vampire-mania, this third installation in the Librarian saga is perfectly positioned for success.  Noah Wyle (as Flynn Carson) and company (Bob Newhart as Judson and Jane Curtin as Charlene) are on the track, this time, of, not the Holy Grail, but its opposite number, the Judas Chalice, which, as Flynn learns, was instrumental in the creation of the very first vampire, its original owner Judas Iscariot--and has the power to create more of them with no nonsense about biting necks.  But Flynn is approaching burnout after battling evil in some 35 forms and losing several girlfriends to his hectic and unpredictable lifestyle.  When he finally resigns himself to the job, he finds that he isn't the only one in search of the Chalice: a former KGB officer (Dikran Tulaine), assisted by a handicapped college professor (Bruce Davison) who turns out to be a lot more than he seems, wants it to help him restore Russia to her former glory by assembling an undead and unkillable army of vamps.  Deciphering a string of clues in post-Katrina New Orleans and teaming up with a seductive Creole chanteuse (Stana Katic) who also isn't telling everything she knows, Flynn finds himself once again up to his ears in danger and learning some things about himself and the Library (particularly Judson, who may well be just as immortal as any bloodsucker not alive) that he never suspected before.  Jonathan Frakes of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" directs with a fine hand for pacing and the effects, as always, are top-notch.  Those who, like myself, enjoyed the two previous chapters in this franchise must definitely not miss this one.",1263427200,,1643,4.956363636363636

I bought them looking for something a little different, with action, that could be seen by my then 10 year old son.  I like Noah Wyle so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I thought they would be a kind of watered down Indiana Jones.  Boy, was I wrong.  They stand alone in the terrific entertainment department.

Although not the biggest fan of Bob Newhart and Jane Curtin, I have to admit they did a fantastic job.  They've also brought in good actors that you don't see a lot of these days, like Gabrielle Anway, Robert Foxworth, Kyle MacLachlan, and Bruce Davidson.  No, it's not realistic, although they contain a lot of interesting historical information and references.  It's pure escapism and lots of fun.

My son loves all three, although the third is his favorite.  There really isn't anything a kid can't see.

3702245,1,B001MVYUQG,My family didn't like this movie. It isn't for the family and was a bit gross. Just not as enjoyable as the other movies in this series.,1242864000,4,136,4.074074074074074

3702248,5,B001MVYUQG,"Enjoyed it very much.  None are as good as the first one.  But I would buy a fourth one, if one comes out.  Like to see it with the cast of the first Librarian.",1240963200,,160,3.6470588235294117
3702249,4,B001MVYUQG,"I liked the first movie, loved the second and this one was just as good. This series is not to be taken seriously - just a movie that you can whack in the DVD player, have a laugh and smile.

While the leading lady didn't have the chemistry that I felt Noah Wyles had with Gabrielle Anwar, the story flows good and contains lots of action out in the field, but still with enough background that you're not left wondering.

A good adventure story and far better than Indy 4.",1240617600,,473,4.2444444444444445
3702250,4,B001MVYUQG,"I am a great fan of this series! I enjoy the light hearted , humorous, adventures. This 3rd adventure; when I first watched it I felt it was the weakest of all - alittle too silly. However with a second viewing I enjoyed the movie quiet abit! I would of course recommend the movie, Noah Wyle is the same and I really enjoy Bob Newhart and Jayne Curtin.",1240012800,5,352,4.1911764705882355
3702251,5,B001MVYUQG,"I love the entire 'Librarian' series and this was no exception!  I was also happy with the price as when new movies come out in the stores, if you don't get them within the first WEEK, you end up paying too much.  This is a movie I will watch over and over again!",1239580800,,263,3.943396226415094
3702252,4,B001MVYUQG,"This movie is actually the third installment in a series, and Flynn, the main character, is a librarian who goes on missions collecting rare and historic relics for the Metropolitan Library of New York. The library has a secret amazing basement filled with treasures from all over the world, and getting a glimpse of its wonders really adds to the fun of the show.

Flynn's character works well because he knows so much and adds pieces to the story through his random factual interludes and references. The Librarian's vast knowledge and love of information really brings the whole story together. He kind of teaches you, and the action and suspense are almost like extras. I doubt that all of the things he says are true, but they sure captured my attention and made me want to know more.

I liked the idea of the Judas Chalice having a vampiric history. Definitely a good twist in the plot. I am not usually into the vampire thing, but it was fun and suspenseful and not the boring, same-old stuff we're used to when it comes to those creatures of the night. I also liked the little love story between Flynn and Simone. It had its own little twist as well.

Bob Newhart is loveable as kooky Judson, and Jane Curtin is also good in her nerdy role. Noah Wyle really surprised me, though. He's funny and nerdy-hot and an action hero all at once. It's Indiana Jones-esque. I think Wyle makes the perfect Librarian. I definitely want to see the rest of the series now. I hope they make many more. Definitely recommended.

Keep in mind this is a made for TV series.",1239580800,8,1561,4.544483985765124
3702253,2,B001MVYUQG,"This episode was a bit of a stretch, like they were really trying too hard.  The storyline was just too weak to really hold my interest.  The special effects were not up to the standard of the first two movies.  All in all a disappointing effort.",1239235200,3,246,4.304347826086956

3702258,4,B001MVYUQG,I purchased this DVD for my mom (she loves the librarian series) and she said that she really enjoyed the story and had no disappointments whatsoever. Mom was most impressed by the way that it was packaged - she said that she could have driven the car over it and it wouldn't have damaged it in anyway.,1238544000,,302,4.315789473684211

3702261,3,B001MVYUQG,The movie is entertaining but lacks the depth of a big production movie. I have seen better made for TV movies.,1238198400,2,111,4.333333333333333
3702262,5,B001MVYUQG,"This movie is perfect for families with children who are a little older.  It is a movie that has a little bit for everyone.  The premise of the show works with standing myths and legends and brings them to life through an Indiana Jones-type character called Flynn Carson played by Noah Wyle.  The story blends reality with legends and includes just enough true history for the audience to suspend disbelief.  The sci-fi portion of the movie is well done with 80's-type visual effects.

Overall, a cool  movie and nice escape from reality!",1238112000,,538,4.793478260869565
3702263,4,B001MVYUQG,The movie is a great family movie. I like the way there is a continuation of the story line into the third installment. You really have to pay attention to the small bits of information released of where and when the Librarian came from.,1238025600,,237,4.409090909090909

3702266,5,B001MVYUQG,"The Librarian: Curse of the Judas Chalice - Noah Wyle is perfect for the role.  He is light hearted enough to be ""The Librarian"". The stoy is pure fantasy and there is nothing wrong with that.  I found the love of his life being a Vampire (no give away here) to be perfect for him. Both are alone in a world they can never truely be a part of. Bob Newhart is great as always. The story itself follows a smooth path from start to finish with no ""forced"" scenes or endings.  Not the best in the series but one of the more enjoyable. Can't wait until the next one comes out. If they are smart they will ride this franchise all the way!",1236816000,,632,4.080645161290323
3702267,1,B001MVYUQG,"This movie is either a low budget production meant to make money or a made-for-TV movie's DVD release meant to make more money. In either case we have sophomoric acting & a disjointed script with attempts at light humor. Or was it satire? No matter, hard to tell because it failed at both. Green screen generated backdrops were obviously low budget as shown by a total of two or three CG effects - blurry fast people and dying sparkly, already dead people. Both effects seen in countless other fantasy movies the past 8 years. The movie is also one improbable event after another including a librarian whose brain contains a data base the size of the Library of Congress. On the positive side: a pretty good ending where for the first time there was some emotive acting.",1236038400,6,770,4.627737226277373
3702268,3,B001MVYUQG,"I was mystified by the YRV rating on this TV movie.

Sort of pulp fiction for television this has a certain charm about it spoit only by the joins.

A bit of judicious editing would not have gone amiss.

If you yearn for a bit of yesteryear  with Errol Flynn or Tyrone Power in swashbuckling tales then this is for you.

A harmless bit of fun. Enjoy.",1235347200,2,350,4.164179104477612
3702269,4,B001MVYUQG,"I've enjoyed all three installments of this series, the ""Curse of the Judas Chalice"" may well be the best of the three.

The Librarian series is Indiana Jones Lite, and that's just fine. There is plenty of humor and other elements to interest adults, and action and 'cool factor' for kids to enjoy ... or vice versa. LOL

The one thing the Librarian might want to work on, though, is hiding his trail. Where ever he's heading, the bad guys always show up just behind him, and occasionally even beat him there!

These movies are worthwhile if, for no other reason, to see what may turn out to be some of Bob Newhart's final roles.",1234742400,18,629,4.452173913043478
