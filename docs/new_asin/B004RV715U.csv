4461736,1,B004RV715U,"First off, I'd seen a similar video that was used for training purposes. I bought this for ""training value"" in hopes of helping new recruits along.
This has almost NO training value whatsoever, save for a few clips. Most (90+%) of this garbage is 1980's era poor/ grainy/ VHS copied- copied - copied footage from SE Asia. Their are a lot of still pics from there thrown in as well.
This is just sick and disgusting. The commentary and 80's metal thrown in is just wrong on so many levels.
I'm going to use about 9 mins. (out of 6 DVD's) total and throw this trash in the trash.
Save your $$$.",1372464000,7,592,4.294642857142857

4461740,1,B004RV715U,"Beware! I saw the first DVD in this series when it came out in VHS. This is truly toxic. Like another viewer pointed out, this not only shows a countless number of deaths as they happen (not many ""aftermaths""), one after the other after the other, in very rapid succession. Most clips only last a few seconds and the commentary is always ""very humourous"", in very ""good"" taste: ""Ow, that guy won't be eating any more buritos!"" ""We'd like to say this woman was unharmed, but we'd be lying!"" That type of thing.
The main reason I call this toxic is that once I started watching it, I couldn't stop. I even watched some of these ""exciting"" deaths several times. By the time I was finished, over two hours had passed, and I had watched litterally hundreds of deaths, all the while encouraged to watch more by the ""witty"" commentary.
If you value your sanity: please avoid at all cost. This should actually be... ""Banned by Amazon"", if you ask me.",1326844800,11,942,4.514619883040936
4461741,5,B004RV715U,"Does what it says on the cover which i fully respect. Some crook footage here which is all real and amazing. The narritive is black humor at its best with some insensitivity thrown in. Most of the scenes are aftermath footage but some are shown as they happen, do not eat dinner while viewing.",1316822400,14,293,4.444444444444445

8439317,4,B004RV715U,"I made it through the first two DVDs in this series and it wasn't to hard unlike other people have said elsewhere. I actually ""enjoyed"" the experience if that's possible! The shock- value was through the roof! Also, I thought the music added to the series. It wasn't death metal like in traces of death but added a touch of ""brutality"" to the proceedings in its own way even though it was industrial/ dance music! Loved it!",1425254400,,423,4.5064935064935066

8439321,5,B004RV715U,I thought this series was better then traces of death and was a lot cheaper... The narration was also done better. It's a kick butt film and will watch tons more..

8439322,1,B004RV715U,"Offensive. Disturbing. Disgusting. I watched this years ago along with faces of death and it desensitized me for many years. I felt I had seen something truly wrong and I felt sick with myself for watching these filthy movies. Be careful what you seek, you may just find it in all it's morbid glory..",1394668800,3,300,4.574074074074074
8439323,1,B004RV715U,"This was a pointless series that showed hardly any footage unavailable elsewhere on the web.

I 'get' shows like COPS and World's Wildest Police Videos, for example, but there was nothing to recommend about this series.

There is also a very obvious bias towards non-American footage which must be easier to get hold of than that of American incidents.

I find it genuinely offensive that American deaths cannot be compiled into a series, but film showing traffic accidents in third world countries? go right ahead.

Just slightly racist in execution (no pun intended) if not in intent.

If you are sometimes a sucker for wanting to see something that 'pushes the envelope' so to speak, like me, not to watch poor people getting killed or to watch a deranged individual blow his brains out on a motorway, but just to get the uncensored/unsanitised version of a news story, then you are in my opinion going to regret buying this.

Like a decent horror film, I occasionally try a series that I think might be genuinely interesting. This is not that kind of TV show.

I am against banning anything (anything involving adults) such as in news footage, but I could not see any redeeming aspect to this show.

Who wants to see the OJ Simpson crime scene in all the gory detail, just as one example?

Brain Damage Films, as the company who put out this dubious stuff, needs to change its title to No Brainer Rubbish.

This is bottom-feeding stuff.",1385769600,2,1440,4.701195219123506
