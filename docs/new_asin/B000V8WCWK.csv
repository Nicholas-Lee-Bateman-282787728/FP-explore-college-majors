8217307,4,B000V8WCWK,"Here's the director who seems to be untouched by recent fads - this film might as well have been made 30 years ago. Though it's typically French, it's hard to find clear analogies - maybe late Claude Sautet comes to mind. It's a romantic story told half-voice, with pauses and omissions. Music (Argentine tangos) plays an important part in the film. Briz's style is often called minimalistic but it's not a very apt description. It's rather deliberately subdued, unadorned and devoid of ostentatious effects, as if it wishes to remain unnoticed. Briz lets his story to unfold slowly, relying mostly on mise-en-scene and the chemistry between the two leads whose awkward silence is often more eloquent than words.",1388361600,,712,5.0423728813559325
