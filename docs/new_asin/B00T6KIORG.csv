7001609,5,B00T6KIORG,The best dysfunctional show ever hope it's on forever! I own all the other seasons,1452211200,,82,4.533333333333333
7001610,1,B00T6KIORG,"This season just makes me mad. There really isn't one good episode. The characters are like different people now. Dennis is like a psycho mastermind manipulating everyone every episode, Mac has become brain dead, Frank is senile, it's just not funny. They just reference all their old jokes at this point and anything new is completely random and lazy. Love the first 7 seasons but they're going downhill fast.",1452124800,3,410,4.956521739130435
7001611,5,B00T6KIORG,"The show is fantastic as always.  However, Fox's laziness when it comes to physical media these days is aggravating.  Prior to last season, Fox was releasing It's Always Sunny on Blu-ray until they abruptly stopped and went to releasing bare bones dvd releases.  So I own season 1-4 on dvd, 5-8 on blu-ray, and 9-10 on dvd.  Luckily, we are actually getting a real dvd because Fox releases most of their titles these days through DVD-R on demand releases (check The Killing, Louie, Bob's Burgers, Man Seeking Woman, etc.).  Very few Fox owned shows see the light of day on Blu-ray these days, which is a shame for collector's/fans of some of their properties.  With season 10, Fox has gotten even lazier and released the season censored like how it was aired on TV.  Season 9 had a few f-bombs/nudity that was uncensored on the dvd yet everything is bleeped out this season.  I understand physical media doesn't sell like it did 5 years ago, but how in the world does Archer get a Blu-ray release every single year yet hit shows like this get the shaft?  Aside from my rant, this season is great and deserves better!  I don't understand why Fox offers a DVD-R on demand service, but not a BR-R on demand service?",1451952000,25,1212,4.569444444444445
7001612,5,B00T6KIORG,"Good season but why did they stop making blu rays of the sunny seasons? They did 5-8 in bluray then ONLY dvd for 9-10. As a physical copy buyer, we are collectors and side by side it's a peeve on any collectors shelf. Also sunny looked great on bluray. I don't understand why in 2016, they'd only release a dvd. However, I give this a 5 because it's one of the best shows on tv.",1451952000,8,378,4.053333333333334
7001613,5,B00T6KIORG,There is nothing on TV like this show--I love all of the characters and the actors!  I hope this show continues for a long time! I have been a fan since season 1 and every season is amazing!!,1451088000,2,191,4.026315789473684

7001651,3,B00T6KIORG,"The characters are true to form in this season, however the jokes are getting tired and feel replayed.

7001654,4,B00T6KIORG,"I love SUNNY, and this is the first time I've had to give one of their discs fewer than five stars.  However, there are fewer shows than in the average year, and the ONLY supplemental material is a brief blooper real.  Why were there no Commentary tracks?

I just heard that IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA is going to go through Season 12 to Seasons 13 and 14.  Let's hope that future discs are not as light in content as this one!",1459641600,5,434,4.2560975609756095

7001668,3,B00T6KIORG,"If you're looking at buying Season 10, presumably you're enough of a fan that you don't need a review of the show itself. In the unlikely event you're just getting into the show, start around season 3 (when they started hitting their stride) or earlier; this is such a character-driven show that a lot of this would be lost.

Content-wise, though, the DVD is quite a letdown compared to previous seasons. We still have a cute thematic menu screen (they've always been nicely done), and there is a short gag reel, but... that's it. After being spoiled by tons of commentary and extras that range from amusing to bizarre for the past several years, I ordered this without looking close and was disappointed by the dearth of bonus features.",1454889600,16,737,4.713178294573644
7001669,5,B00T6KIORG,"I hope they make 10 more seasons, love this show and own every season",1454803200,,69,4.0
7001670,5,B00T6KIORG,Great! Thanks,1454716800,,13,6.0
7001671,1,B00T6KIORG,"The only reason I spend money on physical copies these days (ever really) is for commentaries. Some are really hit or miss, but Sunny has always been amazing with there commentaries. Dr. Drew is a blast to listen to with the guys, and the in-character commentaries for Lethal Weapon 5-6 are hilarious. I most certainly won't be buying this season, or any others that can't even be bothered to include the amazingness that are cast commentaries.",1454284800,2,444,4.855263157894737
7001672,1,B00T6KIORG,"I don't know what has happened to this show. First 8 were unbelievable and without question the best comedy show in tv history, they had me laughing at 98% of the episodes, but now it's become recycling old material time and time again with nothing new. Sure there are funny parts, but it seems as if they have run out of material and are unable to come up with anything new. I love this show beyond comprehension, I have the first 8 seasons on dvd and watch them constantly, but something horrible has happened since season 9. I get that the characters are evolving into much more psychotic versions of themselves, after all that's what Rob has stated he wanted for the characters to spiral out of control, but it just seems so forced and phoned in. Very disappointing.",1454112000,,770,4.546762589928058
7001673,5,B00T6KIORG,Have never watched a single episode on T.V. Have every season on DVD and not one is disappointing. Laugh my ass off every single episode. Talented crew all around. Keep up the excellent work.,1453939200,,191,4.647058823529412
7001674,4,B00T6KIORG,"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is my favorite show of all time. I own all the previous seasons on DVD.
On their 10th anniversary, this season is one of the funniest so far, which is difficult for many shows to pull off.
However, this DVD is by far their worst... Usually by the time the DVD set comes out, I've seen each episode at least ten times, and very much look forward to the special features of the DVD, especially the episode commentaries. Season 10 has none. Season 10 has one decent gag reel, and that is all, very lackluster in special features. If you already have the episodes somewhere, don't bother buying the DVD.",1453248000,4,633,4.51304347826087
7001675,3,B00T6KIORG,"Okay. I loved this season, probably the best by far. But the bonus features are just LAZY. I would've loved to see how they worked ""Charlie Work"" behind the scenes, see how they celebrated 10 seasons and I certainly would've loved to hear Rob, Glenn and Charlie's commentary on certain episodes.. Like, ""Charlie Work"", ""The Gang Goes on Family Fight"" and The Gang Beats Boggs"". Really a let down but I enjoy the episodes. 3/5 for me.",1452556800,5,433,4.636363636363637
