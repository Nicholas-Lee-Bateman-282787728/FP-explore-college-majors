3971419,5,B002R3CQDC,"In the words of John Lennon....""Well, well, well...."" It's not really a surprise that this film was chosen to open the Berlin Porn Festival in 2009 and the audiences filled three theatres; or that The Band was also nominated for the 2010 Feminist Porn Awards in Toronto. To finally see this film was a definite treat for the senses. Set in Melbourne, Australia, this film has it all, an engaging plot, characters we can relate to and/or have fantasised about, a variety of very hot real sex scenes that are sure to suit a wide range of tastes, and a few surprises along the way. The cast, including Amy Carter, Anthea Eaton, Rupert Owen, Butch Midway, Jimstar and Brianna Heart make this film a definite treat for the voyeurists at heart. I look forward to seeing more of Anna Brownfield's work,including her latest film premiering at the Melbourne International Film Festival, ""Making it Handmade.""",1279411200,15,899,4.8441558441558445
3971420,5,B002R3CQDC,"the band is an excellent presentation of the trials and tribulations of the independent music industry.  what i like about it, and something that is not done enough, is the blend of drama and hardcore scenes.  this is definately not a ""porn"" movie without a plot or acting.  this is a well-done, nicely blended slice of life, showing all that it should.  enjoyable acting and well edits, make this movie view smoothly.  i highly recommend this movie if you like independent film, independent music and aren't offended by the human body.  definately not a disney flick.  if you've seen ""9 songs"" and liked it, this is very similar.",1269993600,20,630,4.777777777777778
3971421,5,B002R3CQDC,"how i wish Anna was an American, alas she's not! this film is bold and brilliant. More American film companies should follow the standard she set. It takes you into the world of "" rising stars "" in the rock genre but also, shows the trappings and downfalls along the way. the main character ( Amy Cater ) is perfect in this role. i've read another review and it talks of sex and blah blah blah, the movie makes a point of incorporating sex in a natural surrounding so it fits and most of all it works. so what if it shows bit's and pieces of "" taboo body parts "" but the film industry and the idiots who rate movies are dinosaurs. a director actor or audience does not need someone to impose their will upon us anymore. Puritans? yet they blink not one eye at the gore and horror and depiction of murder, and death , etc, etc, etc, on the infamous silver screen  i hope Anna Brownfield continues to make more movies that "" shock the world "" i praise her and the whole cast for the down to earth real life movie that they all participated in. Anna and her cast have "" grown up "" hopefully the rest of the world will catch up!
this movie deserves a 5 star rating on it's own merit! Obviously it's not a film for children to watch. that's way to political to even remark on, needless to say this movie rocks! i highly recommend it! to take the final curtain call on this review i say "" bravo and encore "" to all involved in this film",1264377600,9,1430,4.125448028673835
3971422,1,B002R3CQDC,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE.  ACTING WAS NOT GOOD, SEXUAL SCENES TOO STRONG, LEAVING NOTHING TO THE IMAGINATION.",1402963200,2,121,5.05
3971423,3,B002R3CQDC,"This movie is the only medium-core porn I've ever seen.  Plot, dialogue and acting is on par with a softcore porn, but some scenes are very explicit.  Not what I expected based on movie reviews.",1395187200,2,194,4.514285714285714
3971424,1,B002R3CQDC,I was hoping for a more realistic behind the scenes take on the movie with some good punk music so a little disappointing.,1395187200,,122,4.3478260869565215
3971425,5,B002R3CQDC,This is a very adult film.  It does tell a story about the adventures of a rock band but the story seems to be an excuse to show the sexual episodes a rock band might experience.  It is a close-up view of one erect penis after another spewing semen.  So be forewarned if such fare upsets you.,1376611200,7,292,4.087719298245614
3971426,5,B002R3CQDC,"In some parts of the movie I thought it is a porno, because it has lots of nudity, with explicit sex.",1371168000,3,101,3.857142857142857
3971427,1,B002R3CQDC,"It would have got less, but I have to give it credit for the time I feel asleep during it. I might have missed something good, so I'm giving it a little credit for that. Save your money, I wish I did on this one",1371168000,,211,3.7111111111111112
3971428,5,B002R3CQDC,"Excellent the was good , but when I bot the film there was to much hardcore sex in the film .",1328572800,,93,3.4761904761904763
3971429,5,B002R3CQDC,"Shocking! Bizarre! Funny! A great cast of hilarious characters in a wild, insane, off the wall movie. If you've ever delivered pizzas you can relate to this film.",1323561600,,162,4.821428571428571
3971430,2,B002R3CQDC,"I must apologize to anybody that found this film enjoyable, first of all.  But this is an honest opinion.  I saw a few screenshots of this movie before I bought it, the story sounded pretty good and it was based around music, which is always good, and an all girl band, another plus.  But after getting this film, I quickly was disgusted with it and refuse to watch it again.  I am far from squeamish, but this film really raises the bar on ""disgusting"" and puts it at a whole new level.  From highly detailed scenes of men masterbating, for whatever the reason, I just simply found stomach-turning and completely unnecessary.  The girl on girl scenes are pretty nice, but it has a plot that is very hard to follow and its vulgarity makes the overall scene not worth getting, not even worth renting.  Stay away from this film unless you are into that sort of stuff.",1295654400,,865,4.471337579617835
3971431,2,B002R3CQDC,"If you like movies with lesbian and gay sex scenes, then this is your movie.  I was expecting the explicit scenes, but the story line and the above scenes could have been improved",1286150400,4,179,4.424242424242424

8378345,5,B002R3CQDC,"It's wonderful to see something this ""caliente"" (like fire) come from Australia.  The movie was obviously made with the utmost care.  Superb acting.  Some parts of the film are very amusing.
Definitely worth every penny.  (Not for prudes)",1497830400,,238,5.184210526315789
8378346,4,B002R3CQDC,"It has a storyline. never mind the warning label. It's not that explicit. If you love the rock and roll lifestyle, you will like this movie. get some popcorn and chips.",1477267200,,168,4.451612903225806
8378347,2,B002R3CQDC,"Lots of very graphic content.  It's porn masquerading as an indie flick.  The main girl is not that hot.  It's barely watchable, coming from a guy who likes both porn and indie ;)",1476057600,2,179,4.363636363636363
8378348,4,B002R3CQDC,got it on time. the movie kind of weird and alot of sexual stuff but its okay. i gave it to my friend..he liked it.,1469923200,,115,3.64
