2772287,3,B000NNUWZM,"Fear is violent, it keeps you interested til the end when Mark Wahlberg gets what he deserves. The second movie 'The Watcher' makes you not want to watch it a second time. The character played by James Spader is dull. And the third film 'Raising Cain' turned me off simply because I can't stand watching a movie where one actor plays several different roles. This movie remined me of people who go around talking to themselves.",1318118400,,427,4.631578947368421
2772288,4,B000NNUWZM,"This DVD is a 3-movie pack containing ""Fear"" & ""The Watcher"" on one DVD and ""Raising Cain"" on the other. Although all three are older movies, the quality of the DVD transfer is pretty decent [not outstanding] and all three are also R-rated.

In ""Fear"" Reese Witherspoon plays a naive teen who falls head over heels with Mark Wahlberg's troubled adolescent and soon realises that Mr Perfect may not be so perfect after all. It is a well-told tale of teen love, and dangerous obsession.

In ""The Watcher"", James Spader plays a retired FBI agent Joel Campbell who is haunted by a past case where a serial killer caused his lover's death. The serial killer David Allen is played [not very credibly] by Keanu Reeves who refuses to let Joel rest and follows him to Chicago where he continues his grisly 'work', sending pictures of intended victims, and forcing Joel back on the case. Marisa Tomei plays Joel's shrink, though her role is quite small here. The real star is Spader - his anguish over the past and his determination to put an end to Allen's killing spree shines through in every frame.

""Raising Cain"" is directed by Brian de Palma and focuses on John Lithgow, a respected psychologist who harbors a dark secret from his past [having to do with his father] and how his multiple personalities affect his sanity - resulting in a macabre plot to relive his father's sinister experiments on children. John Lithgow's performance alone makes this a worthwhile viewing experience.

All in all, I'd recommend this DVD set to fans of psychological and suspense thrillers.",1228348800,6,1569,4.8
