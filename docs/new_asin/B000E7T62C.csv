8106954,3,B000E7T62C,"while i am a big fan of peter paddon, i didn't like this video overly much. would have enjoyed it more if it included more practical information about getting into an altered state. however, for the subject matter, he definitely knows what he's talking about.",1378252800,,259,4.777777777777778
8106955,5,B000E7T62C,"awesome, very inspiring, and works like a charm, i like, the teacher, he seems very focused and knowlidgeable, thumbs up",1354060800,,120,5.05
8106956,3,B000E7T62C,"Okay, the goods first. The thing that saved my review from a 1 star is because I like how Peter explained in detail what to expect if you were to try and get involved in ""seeing the sight"". The lectures were very helpful as well, and I enjoyed his dorky sense of humor. Yet this gets a 3/5 (actually more likely 2*and a half/5) because this DVD put me to sleep. Peter did not move or walk around to make your eyes adjust or give it any candy by showing pictures or examples which made me bored. And he was profusely sweating from the very beginning of the DVD right to the end. I'm not sure if that bothers you, but it distracted me from paying attention to what he was saying. He looked a tad-bit uncomfortable too. I was like, ""Will somebody give this guy a glass of water? Or a fan?!"" in my head.
Anyways, Good lecture. I enjoyed Peter's information very much. But I believe the DVD was much less worth $15.",1325116800,2,910,4.2057142857142855
8106957,5,B000E7T62C,"Peter Paddon is a contemporary Cunning Man with many years' experience in the occult world: a plethora of experience that spans the Egyptian mysteries, ceremonial magick, Alexandrian Wicca, and for several years, Traditional Witchcraft. ""The Sight: Getting It, Using It, Dealing With It"" is a taped lecture that has much to offer both novice practitioners as well as those with more experience in occult matters. This video correctly aligns the cultivation of psychic skill with skills in detecting and manipulating energies, and gives exercises to train one's ability to do just that. But as with all his videos, Peter Paddon's lectures range widely and you will hear him also speak about more advanced topics, such as aspecting Deity, concluding with a demonstration.

My wife and I both have years in the Craft, and we very much enjoyed and benefitted from this DVD. We also have shown it to our public group meeting, where it was popular and very well received. As with all of Peter Paddon's videos, there is enough information that you will want to watch it several times.",1299628800,3,1077,4.983333333333333
8106958,5,B000E7T62C,"My experience with Peter Paddon's work is that he provides an atmosphere of comfort and authenticity no matter what the subject.  A gifted teacher, Peter provides the comfortable environment that we all need when we are learning something new.  This is the real deal, folks.  It's a group of  people in a live class learning right along with you. The lights are hot, the room is full and everyone is working. If you were expecting a Disney production, look elsewhere and good luck to you.  I'll take Peter's work any day of the week. Thanks to this DVD, I have the opportunity to learn with a real group of people who are physically far away, but spiritually close.",1238889600,3,665,4.601694915254237
8106959,5,B000E7T62C,"This is an awesome DVD and well worth the money if you are looking for real relevant tools to help you along your path. You pop in the DVD and feel like you are part of a class of regular people, just like you, there to learn a technique to use in your own way, perhaps with your own group.  The information is presented well and orderly both in explanation and demonstration. Everything worth having takes work and you have to be willing to practice the techniques and find what works best for you to succeed. Peter Paddon provides the foundation to build on. Considering what others charge for a class along these lines, the price of the DVD is well worth it.",1203984000,7,661,4.373983739837398
8106960,4,B000E7T62C,"The Sight by Peter Paddon is a very educational look at what the sight is and how to use it.  I found the classroom setting of the video beneficial.  Watching the students perform the steps and seeing their reactions was very interesting.  I would recommend watching this class with a partner so you can walk through the steps as Peter is explaining them.  The Sight is not an easy thing to explain and takes practice to learn.  Peter's video is very informative and if the steps he teaches are followed and practiced, you will get results.  Thanks.",1203984000,14,549,4.608247422680412
8106961,1,B000E7T62C,"The worst video you can imagine....
I would suggest NOT buying this, or you will be disappointed!

I cannot believe this man would charge $30, or even $5 for this horrible home video.
This terribly made video is a man telling a class of 15 or so people to put their hands close together to feel the energy. Then he gets them to look across the room, and try to see someone's aura. He just says blur your eyes and try to see it. Now you've just read the whole lesson...you don't need to buy it, lol.

In the second half of the movie, he calls on a spirit and pretends it has entered his body. I believe this is possible for people to do, but I'm pretty darn sure he hasn't done this in the video. There is no purpose for this, as this 'entity' has no relevant knowledge to offer!",1203811200,9,778,4.1118421052631575
8106962,4,B000E7T62C,Peter Paddon gives an abundance of information in this 2 1/2 hour video.  He is from England but now lives in California.  Peter is very articulate and just explains what he has experienced and researched in a very understandable manner.  Very educational.,1197072000,7,256,5.0476190476190474
