2627520,5,B000H5U67A,"After reading the negative review by ""The Truth Hurts"", I was initially reluctant to make this purchase.  Having said that, I went ahead and took a chance, and I'm glad I did.  This is an excellent collection of films at a very low price.  There are a few things you should be aware of before making the purchase, though.

The films are not all of the same genre.  Of the four films, two of them (Shogun's Ninja and Shogun's Shadow) fall under the matial arts category, and are reminiscent of ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" and ""Shadow Hunters"".  The other two, ""Shogun's Samurai"" and ""Sword of Vengence"" are historical dramas more in the vein of ""The Seven Samurai"" and ""Chusingura"".  In fact, ""Sword of Vengence"" is a variation of the same story as ""Chusingura"", another retelling of the 47 ronin.  The latter two fims are more plot driven and feature far less action.  This is just fine by me, as I enjoy both types of samurai film.

Another thing you should know is that Sonny Chiba is not actually the star of any of these films.  He plays a supporting role in all of them.  So die hard Sonny Chiba fans may be disappointed.

All and all, this is an excellent purchase for fans of Japanese cinema, especially considering the price.  Most Japanese films cost a premium (check out the price being asked for any Kurosawa or Lone Wolf and Cub film), so to get four excellent films for the price of one is a steal.

I don't know anything about the distribution company that sells this, and frankly I don't care.  I can tell you that the sound and picture quality of all of these films is excellent.  There are absolutely no issues there at all.  There is an issue with the misleading marketing of these as ""Sonny Chiba films"" which I've already discussed, and for that this collection should be deducted one, maybe even two stars, but I'm going to go ahead and award it five to offset the unjustified one-star review.

Highly recommended!",1163808000,58,1927,4.533333333333333
2627521,1,B000H5U67A,"the movies get 5-stars but the company 1-star.
no matter how they try to justify their poor quality releases, the buying public are finally catching on that anything released by Brentwood, BCI Eclipse, Deimos (etc.) is going to be a poor effort. they lie about the version(s) on the DVD(s) -- substitute ""TV"" version(s) instead of the ""Theatrical"" version(s), call something ""Widescreen"" when it's a hack-job cutting off foreign subtitles on an English dub print, or just horrible DVD transfers and/or encoding errors. (yet always blames it on ""the source material"" which is just a weak cop-out)
so, what are they doing over there at BCI to better their image? well, how about taking movies already released, movies with excellent quality, encoded perfectly, and re-packaging them as THEIRS!? well, that's what you are getting with this box set. these movies were already released by ADNESS. a company who i am guessing is now out-of-business, whose owner decided to become part of the (new?) management at BCI.
this 'budget' re-pack includes the following titles:

- Shogun's Samurai (Yagy ichizoku no inb/The Yagyu Conspiracy) (1978)
- Shogun's Shadow (Shgun Iemitsu no ranshin - Gekitotsu/Geki Totsu: The Insanity of Emperor Iemitsu Gekitosu) (1989)
- Swords of Vengeance (Ako-jo danzetsu/The Fall of Ako Castle) (1978)
- Shogun's Ninja (Ninja bugeicho momochi Sandayu) (1982)

for those of you who didn't buy the Adness versions, this is a good buy for you. just know you are supporting a company who doesn't care about these movies, or you the customer.",1158537600,27,1558,5.154150197628459

8136627,4,B000H5U67A,"I've seen three out of the four in this collection and I must say it has been worth it. The three so far, ""Shogun's Shadow,"" ""Swords of Vengeance,"" and ""Shogun's Samurai,"" are all story driven as opposed to the 'The Samurai Collection.' The stories are very character driven with twisting plots and sub-plots. Despite being older movies, the famous Japanese attention to detail is present and is a delight to the eye. The sets are very well done with clothing that match each setting.

The acting is also very good. While the battles do not contain the realism that is now achieved with special effects, they work just as well as anything Kurosawa did in his early days. Of the three, one uses the embarrassing flying leaps that eventually has come to plague good martial arts movies. But in this case it is done very, very sparingly. Therefore it does not kill the film's credibility.

'The Swords of Vengeance'  is the telling of the 47 samurai, but under much more believable terms than Hollywood's embarrassing and silly remake. ""Shogun's Samurai,"" tells the tale of the Yagyu's conspiracy to instill Iemitsu as Shogun. Not favored by the dying Shogun as his successor, the Yagyu clan concocts and pulls off a conspiracy that includes assassination and enough deceit to have made Gen. George Custer feel proud.

""Shogun's Shadow,"" rounds out the tale. Iemitsu is sick and dying. He spends his days in the castle being attended to by his favorite concubine, getting drunk on sake and dispensing cruel governance. Far away his eldest son is being brought to Edo under his order to attend the ceremony marking his passage from childhood to manhood and to be groomed for the Shogunate. But forces are bent on stopping this from happening.

In all, these three have been very good viewing and I recommend them for those fans of Japanese cinema, culture, and samurai legends.",1420070400,,1873,4.840625

The costuming and sets are brilliant, the acting makes be believe, and the violence is believable out of necessity but not unnecessarily gory.  The palace intrigues and plots are satisfying.  Very good side-love for fans of the great Kurosawa.",1304035200,,281,5.2

8136632,4,B000H5U67A,"Of the four movies, only two directly involve the shogun, and while Sonny Chiba is in all four, he is more a supporting actor, than the lead, in all. The titles attached to the movies in this release don't make sense either, but fortunately, the English translation of the Japanese titles appears next to the marketing titles. That said, this is a nice set of four movies.

The two strongest movies are Swords of Vengeance and Shogun's Samurai, which not surprisingly, were directed by Kinji Fukasaku, and starred Kinnosuke Yorozuya.

The strongest movie of this set is Swords of Vengeance: Fall of Ako Castle (Ako-Jo Danzetsu).  It is a re-telling of the tale of the 47 Ronin.  Although this version is less detailed than other versions, it hits the highlights and essence of the story.  It's well told, well acted, and, the one major deviation from other versions: this one has a great action packed ending.

Shogun's Samurai: The Yagyu Clan Conspiracy is a detailed movie you need to really pay attention to follow what's going on, and it's also a good story, with lots of intrigue.  It's an all around good movie, but what makes this movie a treat is you get to see Sonny Chiba portray Yagyu Jubei.

Shogun's Shadow: Attack! Shogun Iemitsu is Crazy (Shogun Iemitsu no rasi-Gekitotsuo) is a long hyped-up version of a typical Sonny Chiba televison show from the 1970's and 1980's.  If you've never seen Kage No Gundan, or the Yagyu television series, this is kind of what it was like, but 26 episodes packed into 2 hours.

Shogun's Ninja (Ninja Bugeicho Momochi Sandayu) is an okay movie, typical Japanese period piece revenge film, and looks like it was a showcase for Hiroyuki Sanada, action star.  I don't think he showed his capabilities in this movie, but I think he matured into one of the best actors in Japan, and by the time he winds own his career, he will be acknowledged as one of the great dramatic actors of Japanese cinema.",1269129600,3,1941,4.696165191740413
8136633,4,B000H5U67A,I'm a new Chiba fan and I only want to buy box sets since it's cheaper and easier that way.  I'm happy with this set even though Chiba's not the star.  As others have said the picture and sound are very good.  Heck the box itself is better than I thought it would be.  This is a solid buy for your collection and it couldn't hurt to add Chiba's Samurai collection too.,1182729600,,368,4.069444444444445
8136634,4,B000H5U67A,"The Shogun Collection is a bit schizophrenic.

Two of the movies are great historical epic Samurai films from one of Japan's all-time great directors, Kinji Fukasaku.  These movies are Shogun's Samurai, and Swords of Vengeance.  Expertly directed, very well written, and brought to life by some fantastic actors, both of these movies belong in every Samurai movie fan's collection.

The other two movies are cheesy (by design) 80's action flicks where Samurais and Ninjas can perform superhuman acts (leap tall buildings in a single bound type stuff).  They're passable as entertainment as long as you turn your brain off (although Shogun's Shadow does have it's moments - there is the basis of a good script, it just gets overpowered by too much cheese).

The only thing that all four of the movies have in common are supporting roles for Sonny Chiba - who is particularly good in Shogun's Samurai!

The transfers for ALL FOUR of these movies are brilliant!  Beautiful anamorphic widescreen, original Japanese language soundtrack with English subtitles - these are some great DVD's!  BCI Eclipse has been licensing many different movies and TV series recently, and paying attention to quality.  Their licensing deal here with Adness continues that trend.  They've come a long way from the ""Public Domain"" specialists that they used to be (although they still do that as well).

In the end, this set is worth buying for the two Kinji Fukasaku films alone - you can watch the others or, as some have done, sell them on ebay.",1180137600,13,1523,4.976284584980237
