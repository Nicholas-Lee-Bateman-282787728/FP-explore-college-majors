1237209,5,B00000JQUA,"Finally viewed this in Blu-Ray and the transfer preserves 2:20 70mm print that was originally shown in a roadshow engagement. As much as I liked Scorsese's ""Last Temptation of Christ"" but mixed Gibson's ""Passion Of The Christ"", this version by maverick director Nicholas Ray still stands out and Hunter is superb as Jesus with Robert Ryan magnetic as John The Baptist even eclipsing Charlton Heston's portrayal in ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"".  Also Harry Guardino and Rip Torn are also impressive as Barrabas and Judas Iscariot.  A film to own next to ""Ben Hur"" and ""The Ten Commandments"".",1520726400,,592,5.030612244897959

1237215,5,B00000JQUA,"At my first attempt of viewing this movie almost didn't happen; allow me to explain.  When I first loaded the CD nothing happened, so I repeated my actions.  The second time a message flashed across the, ""This CD can not be played"" Again I ejected the CD and started over again and this time the movie started.  I guess its true what they say; ""The third time's a charm.""  The movie was the best that I have ever seen.  Jeffrey Hunter was an exact likeness of Christ and an amazing actor. A movie about the life and time of Jesus from his birth until his resurrection is recommended as a must see movie that I know I will view over and over again, I feel compelled to recommend this movie to family and friends. Wonderful movie experience.",1519430400,2,739,4.364963503649635

1237217,4,B00000JQUA,"The one thing I did not like about this movie...Robert Ryan, played a weak John the Baptist. When you study the book of John, He spoke strong and with a BOISTEROUS voice...and  people would come to attention when he spoke....The Forerunner...telling the people about the Messiah who's sandals,he's not fit to wear..""REPENT, FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND."" John spoke this with boldness. Also, read, (Mt. 3:7-8). Now, Micheal York, played an excellent John the Baptist.  Now this changes nothing about  Robert Ryan's acting. and all of the great movie he performed in. .He was a superb actor in the business...and saw most of his movies...And I continue to watch his movies this day.",1518393600,,689,4.922413793103448

1237219,5,B00000JQUA,I love this movie it really tells the story of Jesus from the being to the end as the Bible would read. It is the most realistic movie I have seen about the Bible. I can't say that I did not like anything in this movie It really keeps your attention and is really well done.,1517097600,,274,3.9107142857142856
1237220,5,B00000JQUA,"This DVD was bought for my Mother who is a very strong Christian and loves our Lord Jesus Christ. She had a stroke so I wanted to lift her spirits. These kind of movies used to come on TV but we are in another generation now and so many people are hurting and have never been introduced to Jesus Christ who could turn their lives around for the good. So yes, this DVD was very enjoyable",1517011200,,386,4.092105263157895

1237243,3,B00000JQUA,"Note: I saw this picture in High Definition via XFinity On Demand.

Often confused with the superior Biblical epic Cecil B. DeMille's The King Of Kings, this first film version in colour about the life of the Saviour of the world is not very good, in spite of another rich score from Miklos Rozsa (fresh off his Academy Award winning success with Ben-Hur: A Tale Of The Christ), a historically accurate opening, and a Citizen Kane of an uncredited narrator.

Most of the film's flaws have to do with the historical inaccuracy of events as found in The Holy Bible, and Antiquities Of The Jews; to detail them 'woild be nothing but to waste night, day, and time.' Another reason is its omission of key Biblical events, most of them being heard in voice-over, which does a disservice to the church-going and non-church going viewer. Another major flaw is the inconsistency in using King James and modern English, which is like being pulled in two directions. Choose a pattern, and stick to it. Fortunately, the Lord's Prayer is recited in King James English. Another thing I did not like was the omission of the words 'If it be possible' when Yeshua saith, 'Let this cup pass from Me.' It maketh Him human and not at all the only begotten Son of God.

There arw some good things to be found here, though. As i mentioned in my opening statement, the epic score is provided by Academy Award winner Miklos Rozsa, and to that end, the film opens with a shot of Roman soldiers marching to Jerusalem (a shot very similar to the opening of Ben-Hur: A Tale Of The Christ; i do not know if that was intentional, but it was very nice, and there are subtle echoes of his score to the aforementioned film in this picture, which is again a nice touch). Another thing i liked was the screenwriter making Barabbas the leader of the Jewish revolt, which is entirely plausible, given that he was in prison for a certain insurrection made in the city and for murder; less plausible however, is Judas' following him and defending Yeshua to Judas, only to bewray Him without a second thought or on-screen reason given, as it is seen in Cecil B. DeMille's The King Of Kings. I also liked the sympathetic roles of Procula and the fictitious Lucius. And having Charles Foster Kane as the narrator was a nice touch as well. Hence, the three star rating.

See it only once as a rental, and forget about it.",1498521600,,2378,4.549065420560748

1237291,1,B00000JQUA,This movie did not take the test of time very well at all. I'm cutting it a lot of Slack given that it was released in 1961 but the source material it came from the Bible was not followed as it should have been. There are far too many Liberties taken and far too much artistic leeway. If you want a movie about the life of Christ and are interested in an older one you might want to consider Jesus of Nazareth instead. That is much closer to biblically accurate.,1487203200,3,462,4.144444444444445

1237375,5,B00000JQUA,"I saw King of Kings in its initial release in theaters while growing up but at the time felt it was a weak followup to Ben Hur, MGM's Road Show extravaganza featuring reserved seating.  Jeffrey Hunter seemed mis-cast as Jesus and Robert Ryan, popular in film noir of the times, was a real stretch as John The Baptist.  Still the years have been kind to this huge production made in Spain by Samuel Bronston (famous for El Cid, 55 Days at Peking and The Fall of the Roman Empire among others).  The film was shot in 70mm Super Techirama and Technicolor and looks as good today on a blu-ray disc as it did when first released over fifty years ago.  In this time when Hollywood went for glamour and excess with a touch of religion framed around fight scenes with a cast of thousands and scantily-clad dancers and hinted sexual overtones, today's films seem to prefer a more realistic tone and look using subdued color, especially when there is use of CGI (computer-generated images).  This 1960's version of King of Kings seems now a very fine film and one that deserves to be in any collection as a representative of the big budget, widescreen films with a cast of thousands of the times.",1463529600,13,1186,4.549295774647887

1237443,5,B00000JQUA,"This 1961 film is the most accurate protrayal of the latter portion of the life of Jesus Christ. Jeffrey Hunter's performance as Christ is superb! Often critized as ""I was a Teenage Jesus"", by the athesistic socialist left, the film is a big budget well made religious epic. Hunter gives a memorable and very accurate rendition of the Beatitudes while on the Sermon on the Mount, and the sequences of Christ's miracles are simple in their cinematic technique, but very effective. The film must be witnessed in it's original 2:35.1 widescreen aspect ratio. Only in that form can the film be fully  appreciated along with it's 5.1 Dobly Digital soundtrack. A tremedous film that not only shows the correct historical record of Christ's teachings, but also Christ's compassion and love that would eventually change the world and give birth to Christianity.",1433289600,,853,5.049645390070922

1237471,5,B00000JQUA,"Yes, there are many different versions of the Gospel story. From Jesus of Nazareth to The SON of GOD, to name a few. Are they all not about our risen Savior? Jesus Christ, the ONLY BEGOTTEN SON GOD. Wonderful Counselor. Prince of Peace. The Great I AM. It doesn't matter which one is better, as long as we get the true meaning, the meaning God wants us to understand and except about HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON____ that HE died for the sins of the world. For everyone. No one, not the worst of persons can escape the Love of Christ Jesus. How high, how deep, how long, how wide is the pure Love of Christ? The whole entire universe can't contain His Love____ because it is infinite. When Heaven and Earth are long since past, HE WILL LAST. Because He is the ONLY One Worthy. Won't you give the King of the Universe a try? He won't bite, I promise. Anyway, concerning this SPECTACULAR moving picture__ stunning, darling, absolutely stunning. The acting of this early 60's film doesn't need CGI to make you cry. It is touching, moving, powerful and wonderfully made. I truly believe that they reserved this Gospel Story for only television programming around Easter for a reason. Believe me my loves, I looked far and wide for this movie on DVD or Blue-Ray___ near impossible to find. I CAN NOT own it physically. Otherwise I would have paid a pretty penny just to own a broken copy of the VHS. I couldn't find it ANYWHERE. It would be a miracle from God for me to find a possible used copy of the DVD. I don't think it even exists on Blue-Ray. Has this 1960's masterpiece been forgotten? My honest advise: buy this digital HD copy from Amazon, watch it over and over until it makes you cry. Feel the goosebumps travel up your spine. Feel the overwhelming power of the Love-filled Savor. His un-dieing love love for a dieing world who has rejected and forgotten Him. Observe His pain on the Cross. REJOICE IN HIS RESURRECTION. For He lives in the Heart that accepts Him still this day. He has been around before the world was even a twinkle in God's eye....

The production scenes depicting the locality along with the costumes are awesome. The detail that was included. This shows the artistry in a era of non CGA effects.

I don't mind an embellished story, so the extra plot lines as discussed by other reviewers don't bother me.  However, when it comes to the portion of the story pertaining to Jesus, I was expecting a truer following of the New Testament.  Instead, much ""poetic license"" is employed - ultimately more than I can tolerate.  I didn't even get through the whole movie before turning it off.

The costumes and photography were the best !
I don;t think they will ever out do this movie. Even Mel Gibson's Passion of Christ
was very compelling, I still think some Director can go into more detail and show more of the Miracles and the times
Jesus was a boy, the missing years and even the time Jesus kicked out the money ex-changers in the Temple which was a violation. Jesus
was very respectful of the Temple and he even made a whip of cords to drive the violators out.",1425081600,5,647,4.2682926829268295

In this superb and deeply moving, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), monumental, big-screen presentation depicting the life of Jesus - THE Anointed Christ, the humble Carpenter from Nazareth is absolutely magnificent.

Within this enthralling epic - a stupendous Samuel Bronston Production which was made in the latter years of Hollywood's 'Golden Age of Cinema' - MGM Studios, reverentially pulled out all of the stop's in it's abundant provision of prop's, costuming and cinematography, in addition too, staffing an enormous cast which ranged in the hundreds. And, for good measure, plenty of extra's on the set. And, as a bonus, handsome Actor - Jeffrey Hunter stared, in the lead role of Jesus, the: KING OF KINGS. Jesus - the Promised Messiah, Who came... but because He didn't behave according to man's preconceived assumptions of how a King should act, He was utterly betrayed and rejected. And further despised, by those who couldn't control and were jealous of Him (See Isaiah 53). Resulting in His having been unjustly crucified for daring to defy tradition, pride and the status quo. And consequently, He - for three days was supposedly silenced, by: Death, hell and the grave. But Jesus, being the KING OF KINGS, had them all fooled. Because in accordance to His Divine Mission and pre-determined plan, He triumphantly arose from the dead. And is now..., eternally victorious! And to validate this miraculous deed, both - His chosen Apostles and a multitude of witnesses, have given numerous accounts of His glorious Resurrection and wondrous Ascension, back into Heaven. Jesus, the KING OF KINGS - a mortal Man. A Divine God. A modest, village, Carpenter. A renowned and brilliant, Teacher. And, a Jewish Rabbi - who was both, beloved and hated. There is no middle ground with this Man/God, the KING OF KINGS! This color, 1962, single-disc, DVD is compelling, mesmerizing, riveting, spiritually and historically accurate and very, emotionally engaging. What little, theatrical license was taken, is very appropriate and in conjunction with the story's theme and content. This spiritual epic is a 'must see and have' for every Christian. And, from a secular stand-point, if you're into gripping, movie drama's, then this captivating film is for you. It comes to it's audience in spoken English and French, complete with subtitles in English, French and Spanish. And it has a remastered soundtrak in 5.1 Dolby Digital and the Special Features, include: Premier newsreels, a theatrical trailer, a vintage documentary 'The Camera's Window of the World' and an all new, digital transfer and interactive menus. Filmed in 70MM super technirama technicolor, this - as per the pages of the Holy Bible, is an epic biographical depiction of the life of Jesus, Who was..., is and forevermore... will be, the KING OF KINGS! This powerful drama is educational, historically revealing, spiritually enlightening, very entertaining and overall inspiring. Combined, it is a magnificent, motion picture - masterpiece! A classic film and a treasured keepsake for any movie collection. Nina Kish",1422835200,2,3354,5.271028037383178

1237585,3,B00000JQUA,"For that reason, God has given you a king of kings.

He is not a king of men but a king of word and deed.

He can only be recognized by kings.

Twenty four kings will recognize him as the King of Kings.

(Doors are slamming outside now.  At night, people seem determined to remind me that it isn't the Sabbath and I owe my neighbors a turn around the neighborhood once in a while.  I've seen signs of a neighborhood watch program, but I don't think I've met any of them.  In any case, I prefer to ramble in my own eccentric fashion.)

Only kings are qualified to recognize the King of Kings and it has to be the whole 24, so I don't worry about the power and reach of any antichrist who can bring no more than ten kings to the table.  The other 14 kings are more than sufficient to cover all 12 gates of Israel.

Can anyone tell me who is speaking to the kings of the Earth at this time?

What is the word of The Supreme and Most Magnificent Antichrist to his ten kings?

I have explained to you before that he is shy.

He is too shy to even sit at his keyboard and lay out his agenda.  He is too shy to write out his orders to his kings and post them in the gates.

By the time he gets his act together, it will be too little and too late.

eleven kings are gathered, he will be forced to play his hand.

Twelve kings can control all the gates of Israel.

There are 12 kings of the day and 12 kings of the night.

Every one of those 24 kings knows who he is.  He came down from heaven crowned with the knowledge of it.

As I recall, that leaves only John as a potential additional witness of the kingdom of heaven.  The humans present in the scene described are primarily the 24 kings, Christ, and John.  So, if John is the first of the two witnesses of Revelation, the other is one of the 24 kings.  That would be the first of the 24 kings to throw his crown to Jesus.  Or would it be the last to hold out?

In any case, that king will function as a witness, not a king.

The imperfect leadership of the world will be complete with 23 kings.

Twenty three is the number of creation.

I'm just waiting for some action from the kings.

I want to read their words here and there.

I want to see their laws posted in the gates.

Great inspiration around Easter season, and when you're watching it, you know you're watching more than a movie, you're partaking in an event.

1237629,5,B00000JQUA,"I like the movie very much. Jeffery was outstanding as Christ, young, eyes seemed to look into your soul. Scripture was spoken throughout the film, a very positive film.",1396828800,,169,4.862068965517241
1237630,5,B00000JQUA,For a movie of it's time it is well done with great acting. The only draw back for me personally is the movie is lengthy and I never finished watching it. I guess according on Amazon prime free there is an allotted time frame so it kicked over to a pay mode about two thirds of the way through the movie.,1396742400,,304,4.0
1237631,5,B00000JQUA,"The title; King of kings' is found in three places in the Book of Revelation (chapt. 15, verse 3; chapt. 17, verse 14 and in chapt. 19 verse 16) and refers to the supreme name (title) given to the Lord Jesus Christ.

In this film about Jesus, Jeffrey Hunter, a matinee idol of the 1950s plays the title role. King of Kings' features Hunter's performance is reserved and reverent. He is able to evoke a connection to him largely due to his eyes and his visage. He is surrounded by some fine actors in strong performances.
Frank Thring who plays a sniveling and cowardly Herod Antipas.  Robert Ryan is fiery as John the Baptist. Siobhan McKenna evokes love as Mary of Nazareth. Ron Randell plays Lucius, a faithful soldier who is touched by Jesus' teachings. Hurd Hatfield is convincing Roman loyalist Pontius Pilate. Brigid Bazlen plays a lascivious and wicked Salome. Harry Guardino gives a rebellious spin to Jesus Barabbas, And, Rip Torn plays the confused and traitorous Judas Iscariot.

The film looks wonderful, borrowing many of the sets used in Ben Hur and has the same musical composer, the oscar-winning Miklos Rosza. The film begins with orson Welles narrating the fall of Judea and the conquest of and enslavement by Rome. While the film does focus on the ministry of Jesus much time is given to the zealot rebels led by Jesus Barabbas. This does water down the tale of Jesus. At times, it feels like an ancient Jewish drama. One does get a full view and feeling of the Jewish world at the time.

What one does take away from the film is Hunter's interpretation of the Jesus. His physical appearance and photogenic looks help the film convey a sense of magnetism. His best scene is The Sermon on the Mount which required thousands of extras. Compared to that scene, the Crucifixion is too short and lacks the strength of other filmatic take son the same scene. The Resurrection does evoke a tear largely due to the music, lighting and reaction of Carmen Silva as Mary Magdalene (whom Jesus refers to in the film as Magdalena).

This film portrayal of Jesus was the best until Robert Powell bested it in Jesus of Nazareth. There is no comparison to the other filmatic portrayals which pale or are too fictional. I always watch this at Easter and encourage others to do so.",1396656000,,2282,4.666666666666667

1237636,4,B00000JQUA,"One of the movie's strongest points is the historical background it gives, especially in its portrayal of Rome's conquest of Judea. Also, the role of Mary is well acted and beautifully presented. Jeffrey Hunter does a sincere and compelling characterization of Christ. But I thought the movie was a little too long on battle scenes and a little too short on showing people's motivations. By way of contrast, the Son of God movie delves into the motives of Judas and of Peter. King of Kings abbreviated the calling of Peter too much. This movie is well worth watching, but I think Son of God and The Passion of the Christ are both superior films.",1396137600,,645,4.666666666666667

1237666,4,B00000JQUA,"I liked this film.  For the most part, it seemed to follow the Bible.  I thought it interesting that the film depicted Barrabas sympathetically.

1237679,5,B00000JQUA,"Many are not aware of the history of this movie. Before King of Kings the face of Christ had never been shown in Hollywood. You had profiles, shadows, distant or even back shots, like in Ben-Hur, but NEVER was His face clearly shown. Well aware of that fact, director Nicolas Ray ""insisted"" on Jeffrey Hunter because of his piercing blue eyes. He insisted that for him to direct this picture that Jeffrey Hunter ""must"" play Christ. It is said that Jeffrey Hunter absolutely immersed himself in the role. He stayed in his tent continuously and when he exited he always remained in character....essentially he ""became"" Christ for the filming of this movie. When you watch this you will understand just how important this total dedication was! The movie is, and remains my favorite about the life of Jesus Christ. I find Jeffrey Hunter's performance quite ""mesmerizing""!!!!!!! The musical score is outstanding and adds beauty and majesty to every scene as needed; and they found thee perfect narrator in Orson Wells. This movie is a MUST-have !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1392681600,21,1057,5.011363636363637

1237696,1,B00000JQUA,"If you don't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and aren't saved, then you may enjoy this film; though the dialog is insipid and the acting mostly uninspired. The film is quite lovely visually and has a very good musical score, though the lack of budget shows painfully at times. Most of Jesus' miracles are referred to rather than shown, and, when the Romans first march into Jerusalem, it looks like a one-horse town. You really only see the temple. Robert Ryan is ridiculously miscast as John the Baptist and hardly shows any emotion at all. He looks like he'd rather be off having lunch.
 The real problem is for those of us who believe in and worship the Son of the Living God. What scripture there is in this film is woefully inaccurate. God's Word is twisted, deleted, or added-to. Satan is the Great Deceiver and used twisted scripture when he tempted Jesus in the wilderness. Since this movie does the same it also qualifies as blasphemy. In addition, there are a lot of wholly fictional scenes concerning Jesus' travels and ministry. In summation, this film is a perversion of the Gospels and should definitely be avoided by believers.",1389312000,5,1143,4.715

1237720,4,B00000JQUA,"This is my favorite Jesus movie even though it may not be historically accurate.  I first saw this film by myself as a ten year old and have been taken by it ever since.  This epic, as other spectaculars in this time period as Ben Hur, El Cid, The Fall of The Roman Empire, and Quo Vadis filmed in Technicolor, is fantastic when placed in the ""Blue Ray"" machine
.
Although the story is a heavily edited blending of the canonical gospels, the actor selection is exceptional along with a fantastic score.  Jeffery Hunter has always been a favorite and plays the main character very well.  However, his and Rip Torn's blue eyes are foreign in this part of the world.  Even though this epic was filmed in Spain, many of the scenes are very similar to the Holy Land treeless landscape.

After seeing this film many times now I realize that it is sterile of Jewish religious intervention unlike others that have followed it.  The absence of the High Priest and Sanhedrin interaction during the judgment of Jesus the Nazarene is noted. It is a story without malice even toward the Romans?",1385596800,,1081,4.569948186528498

1237722,5,B00000JQUA,Classic! Classic! What can you say about these epics from the near end of Hollywoods golden age!  Great classic movie for all!  Probably something younger folks will watch when they begin to enjoy classic entertainment and start searching out classics like this!,1385251200,,262,5.214285714285714
1237723,5,B00000JQUA,"Often, old Biblical epics are rather cheesy with over-dramatic acting, and they aren't always 100% accurate in their retelling of the stories.  King of Kings, however, is a true classic, well worth watching, buying, and rewatching.  As an acting teacher, I have often been bothered by the namby-pamby portrayals most actors give for Jesus.  The Bible portrays Jesus as a kind and loving man but one whose love and value for the truth can also make him very staunch and volatile.  This actor seems to hit the nail right on the head (unintended carpentry reference).  He is a man in every sense of the word, and the love shines through him without leaving him effeminate.

In addition to the excellent actors, I also enjoy the narration in this epic.  They include wonderful background historical information that is supplemental to the the information found in the Bible.  While I'm not a historian, what I know of the history of that time period confirms all that they say.  For example, they tell about when and how the Romans gained political dominance in Judea, and it makes a lot of the Biblical information make more sense.  I just really enjoy everything about this movie, and I find it superior to most modern retellings of the same stories.",1384300800,,1248,4.789719626168225

1237731,5,B00000JQUA,"Jeffrey Hunter gave what is surely my favorite portrayal of Jesus.  His interpretation has an unassuming awe that it needs, and his eyes are strikingly intense and effective for the role (their color aside).  Also enjoyed acting by Robert Ryan as John The Baptist, Harry Guardino as Barrabas, and Gregoire Aslan as Herod.  The narration is excellent, as you would imagine Orson Welles could give (although uncredited).  All these years later, it stands as a well-told classic from Jesus' birth to death!",1381881600,,503,5.097560975609756
1237732,3,B00000JQUA,"I felt as though there was too much energy put on filming Herod Antipas and the zealots rather than on Jesus' life... And Mary sometimes weirded me out a little bit, her acting was a little off-putting.",1381708800,,202,4.486486486486487

1237734,5,B00000JQUA,Story follows the Biblical story. Presented in a way that shows Jesus as a human and yet as God . Musical score outstanding.,1380240000,,124,4.434782608695652
1237735,3,B00000JQUA,"Lots of fiction thrown in about Barabbas and Judas, I guess to make the movie more exciting but I just found it distracting. There were several scenes in which Herod, Pontius Pilate and Caiaphas were socializing together, which was weird . Also do you really think Jesus being a Jewish person had blue eyes? I thought the acting was good and in general the parts of the story which were based on the Biblical account were done satisfactorily, but about half of the movie was pure fiction.",1379808000,,488,4.620689655172414

1237755,5,B00000JQUA,"""King of Kings"" is a movie that should be viewed all during the year and not only at Easter. It has alot of the actors that were popular when I was growing up. King of Kings can compete with the best of biblical movies, i.e., The Ten Commandments, The Greatest Story Ever Told, and The Bible.

I remember Jeffrey Hunter mostly from ""The Searchers"" with John Wayne and Harry Guardino from ""Dirty Harry"" with Clint Eastwood.  I remember Rip Torn from mostly from ""Men In Black"" with Will Smith & Tommy Lee Jones.

1237760,3,B00000JQUA,"I am interested in the Bible and the life of Christ, so I thought I would enjoy this movie.  It is a 50 plus year old movie that is a little too much Hollywood, and a little too little of Bible.  But, that is just my opinion.",1373932800,,225,3.765957446808511

1237770,4,B00000JQUA,"I'll play this movie sometimes for nostalgic reasons:  I remember watching it as a young child.

As a youngster, it never occurred to me that Jesus was highly unlikely to resemble the blue-eyed Jeffrey Hunter.  Oh well:  sometimes I just get in a mood for a big, Hollywood spectacle that doesn't make me work too hard.",1372291200,,318,4.625

1237784,2,B00000JQUA,"There are a few good scenes, but it seems to have been written by someone who only had a vague idea of what the Bible says about Jesus. Sticking more closely to the Bible story would have been much more dramatic, and interesting. Acting and directing are very week much of the time also.",1371772800,2,287,4.333333333333333

1237786,5,B00000JQUA,This movie was made during the age of the Hollywood blockbusters.  It is definitely worth seeing again if you saw it when it first came out or seeing it for the first time.,1371772800,,172,4.212121212121212
1237787,4,B00000JQUA,"This film is a classic but it misleads people into believing Jesus is just like them. He was not, blue eyed or light haired, and his name was Yeshua, which as such he never heard the word Jesus. That name is a ""Christian"" nickname. Jesus was a Jew!

The historical (documented) portions of the movie were portrayed in a manner which was true to all the evidence know, other than scenes being cut to expedite the ""flow"" of the movie. Which is understandable. I would have given five stars except for the lack of accuracy with the persona.",1371686400,,537,4.479591836734694
1237788,4,B00000JQUA,"A good panoramic display with many, richly displayed scenes in this movie. Loved many parts and hated the scourging of Christ and the shallow people who persecuted Him.

1237790,4,B00000JQUA,"This version of the life of Christ takes dramatic license in many instances but makes all the stops through the gospels. The sermon on the mount scene is very broad and sweeping with 1000's of extras. Jeremy Hunter's stern portal of Jesus is effective although I could have used a few smiles, at least in the beginning. There are many other great performances by those who played Salome, Pilate, John the Baptist, and many others. Orson Wells narrates. This is a must see for fans of bible flicks. As a teaching tool probably a good start for a pre-teen.",1371686400,,554,4.606060606060606
1237801,5,B00000JQUA,"A beautiful, beautiful movie.  I remember the first time I saw this; I was about 7, and the whole gathered to watch it.  It was around Easter.  I remember developing a HUGE crush on Jeffrey Hunter set the time, yes, even at that tender age.  Being so young, though, it was difficult for me to separate the actor from the character and feeling very badly about having a crush on our precious Lord and Savior!",1371427200,,407,4.386666666666667
1237802,5,B00000JQUA,I've seen this movie for the first time when I was just a little girt. I was amazed at how Jesus healed people and was extremely kind to people. All the other miracles he performed was awesome! To this day...I wish I was born back then just so I could meet him and possibly be a follower. That would be the ultimate experience.

1237834,4,B00000JQUA,My wife and I both have enjoyed watching this movie. The actors do a fine job of making their characters come to life.

In this one, you just see John praying while his captor's henchmen prepare to dispatch him.  That part was still in the film.  The lost part was probably an 8-10 second section, at best, but I have to wonder what else has been cut to squeeze the length of this classic down.  What a shame, for us purists.  The best I can say is that it's a very clean version, and better than the rental films companies send you.",1369353600,2,636,4.163934426229508

1237839,4,B00000JQUA,"While several films have covered the subject from different perspectives, this film tells the story and doesn't bog down.  The story is evenly paced and never gets boring.  The Technirama Cinematography is outstanding and the BluRay rendition of the image is superb.  While the ""Greatest Story Ever Told"" is a good retelling of the life of Christ, it is painfully slow and becomes tedious to watch.  The more recent ""Passion of the Christ"" only recounts the events leading up to the Crucification an I must say it is brutal.  I don't see how parents can subject their young children to this particular film.

The ""King of Kings"" is presented in such a fashion that it is suitable for the entire family and it gives a balanced look at Jesus and his times.",1369008000,,754,4.674242424242424

1237855,2,B00000JQUA,"King of Kings is the generally well reguarded film of the life of Jesus.  I did not like this film-for one reason only,-this movie took liberties with The Bibles Story of Christ.  The Bible story is called the greatest story ever told-so why make any changes?  Worse, the changes lessen the life Jesus led.  If a viewer wants to find the truth about Christ, then the Bible should be read.",1367971200,2,388,4.5

The restoration is fantastic.  Just amazing color and picture quality.  I do appreciate the efforts of the film makers, but the film is just a bit dated as far as the editing goes.  Well, what do you expect?  After all it is over 50 years old.
The film moves along very slow, probably as it should.  However, it's just too slow for me.

I'll sum it up this way:  Blu-ray quality = 5/5 but the movie = 2/5.",1367884800,,519,3.923076923076923

1237863,4,B00000JQUA,This movie was fairly well directed. The movie kept sort of close to how it is written in the bible.,1366588800,,100,4.05
1237864,5,B00000JQUA,This 2009 DVD version of the King of Kings is the best of all the DVD's of this movie.  The picture quality is absolutely stunning and vibrantly clear. It seems they must have remastered the movie because all the other versions of DVD's and VHS's on this movie were not as clear as this and the sound faded in and out at different times throughout the movie.  The remastered soundtrack is fantastic.  The sound is full and strong.  The Special Features offered on this DVD: Soundtrack remastered in Dobly Digital 5.1; Vintage Documentary - The Camera's Window Of The World (short on preparing for the Sermon On The Mount taping); Premiere Newsreels; Theatrical Trailer.  Widescreen Version with 2.35.1 aspect ratio fits my TV up to 3/4 of the TV screen (not letterbox) which is great.  You won't be disappointed!,1366243200,2,812,4.805755395683454

1237866,5,B00000JQUA,"I bought this movie because it was one of my most favorite films of Jesus when I was growing up. It is not very close to the Bible, but not so far that it is a concern. I was surprised of how colorful this film was until I saw it on Blu-ray. The subplot of Barabas was always an interesting twist to this film, to me seems creative and worked (though the association with Judas is not in the bible).

It makes the story of Jesus come alive like no other film I've seen. Jesus and the characters around Him are alive and real and you can really get into the story. My favorite parts really revolve around how the roman solider comes to realize that the Jewish Messiah is for him as well. Although there are other ""Jesus movies"" as I like to call them out there, I think this one is most complete and informative all w/o taking creative license too far, a must watch for all! One caution is that there are a few scenes of violence that may be disturbing because of their suddenness.

1237936,4,B00000JQUA,"King of Kings is a 1961 Biblical epic on the life of Christ directed by Nicholas Ray, produced by Samuel Bronston and starring Jeffrey Hunter in the leading role.

Phillip Yordan's screenplay is brief, concise and to the point. Prior to this time, the figure of Jesus Christ was often placed in the background as a re-occuring theme like in The Robe or Ben-Hur. Of course in King of Kings,  Jesus is the main character but other characters like Pilate, Herod Antipas, Barrabas, Judas Iscariot and Lucius, {The centurion} are given equal amount of screentime to flesh out their personal motives. Eventually, every character meets up with the Messiah at some point. And like all good movies of this genre, the evil pagans look more interesting in their exotic garb than the Jews in their Protestant virtues and sackcloth.

Samuel Bronston's production was a much less expensive project than Sam Zimbalist's Ben-Hur  (the obviously plastic Roman armor bugged me) but otherwise, the sets are handsome enough and do not detract from the substance of the story.

Jeffrey Hunter (Jesus Christ) does his best with what is perhaps the world's most difficult role. He is well-supported by a group of truly outstanding performances mainly by the members of the royal families (Hurt Hatfield, Viveca Lindfords, Frank Thring, Rita Gam and Brigid Bazlen) and Siobhan McKenna who gives the definite screen version of the sweet, humble, kindly Virgin Mary.

Miklos Rozsa's music is blazing with bright, rich, magnificent melodies like Ben-Hur and should have recieved an oscar nomination.

All in all, this is a fine Biblical epic from the Old Hollywood, made with good care and judgement.

1. Robert Ryan as John the Baptist: Why not Hattie McDaniel? Or Billy Barty? Or Lucille Ball? If it's outrageously bad casting we're aiming for, just ask me.
2. Orson Welles' ponderous (and curiously 'uncredited') narration: NARRATION? Whatever for?!
3. The meandering, languorous pace with which we proceed to experience the life and times of our Lord Jesus: Put me to sleep! Could not stay with it! Perhaps the most important story ever told, and this was the best they could do?
4. Nicholas Ray as director: No, no, no, no, no!
Still I say, '(The Public Life of) Jesus of Nazareth' and the original 'King of Kings', even in its somewhat creaky silent film format, are much to be preferred!",1350864000,8,914,4.613496932515337

The music by Miklos Rozsa is amazing and sets the tone for the entire film. As with any film adaptation of the bible, this also has some serious flaws. The role of St John the Baptist is played unconvincingly by Robert Ryan. Much of the scripture has been altered so some of them make little sense. Jeffrey Hunter looks way to young to play Jesus and his clear blue eyes look strange. Even so, I do recommend this film.

1237966,5,B00000JQUA,"Thanks in part to several poignant scenes throughout ""King of Kings"" -- but thanks far more importantly to the majestic, spiritually uplifting film score music by the inimitable MIKLOS ROZSA -- this devout (half-Jewish-on-his-mother's-side) agnostic was ""miraculously transformed"" into a devout Christian for at least the entire length of this historically accurate (or, more likely, fictitious -- who cares!) representation of the life of Jesus Christ.

Rozsa's enticingly beautiful, easily identifiable scores have rendered many a below-average film worthy of repeat visitations: e.g., ""Green Fire,"" ""Valley of the Kings,"" ""All the Brothers Were Valiant,"" ""Sodom and Gomorrah,"" ""The V.I.P.s,"" etc.

In fact, to a dyed-in-the-wool Rozsa aficionado like myself, the music alone is often the predominant, if not the sole, reason for watching a movie repeatedly featuring this much beloved, world-renowned composer.",1334793600,2,913,5.909090909090909

1237969,5,B00000JQUA,"I remember seeing this film on its first release, and I was struck with how many people that I knew that DIDN'T go to see it.  To this day I always wonder: ""What were they afraid of?""  Of course I was a much younger man, and younger men don't always go for these types of stories.  I was always a bit more open-minded when it came to things religious and must say that after many decades of viewing the film never has lost its impact.  Jeffrey Hunter is superb as the Christ, and the supporting roles are all well acted and defined.  I feel this is as close as anything to a complete tale, though Ben Hur has always been a favorite as well.  This is not something that people take lightly, and sentiments range - in my experience - from okay to Are-You-Kidding?
To see this film transferred to Blu-Ray is a real treat.  The format has not aged at all, and I still think it to be one of the best available.  This film is a perfect fit for any of the Christian Holy Days, but probably Easter will take top billing.  The music that emphasizes so much of the film is soaring and grand, in the tradition of the great Miklos Rosa.  There is nothing here that will offend any Christian, or anyone who might find this of historical value in understanding the era.  It is a true family film, though the real young ones should be cautioned about the violence inherent in the telling of this tale.  Fortunately it is nothing close to what we see today.  Overall this film has always had a special place for me in the stories which have endured the years so well.",1327881600,7,1551,4.27054794520548

I am not a religious person. But this film remains great even if you put aside it's religious aspects, and watch it jusk like you would appreciate any other good story.
It's a film with the pace and scope that only the big screen classics of the 50's and 60's can deliver.
As for the transfer, I can only say that this Blu-ray has one of the most perfect - if not 'the' most perfect - transfer I've ever seen.
This movie was photographed in Technirama, a large negative format that ensured a very high definition picture. The anamorphic widescreen DVD already delivered remarkable image and sound quality. On this blu-ray, however, the improvement is fabulous.
Everything is crystal clear. Facial features, skin wrinkles, textures on fabrics and clothes are all there, astonishingly detailed.
The colors are vibrant and contrast is balanced.
I watch my blu-rays on a Full-HD projector throwing image onto a 120 inch screen. And I say not ev'ry blu-ray transfer do so well at that screen size. But this one does.
Sound is also perfect. Both dialog and music are mesmerizing. That can be easily perceived during the Overture and Exit music, when we are able to enjoy the magnificent score by Miklos Rosza.
The only reason I gave 4 stars out of 5 is because of the poor bonus contents and cheap presentation of the product.
This film deserved more in-depth extras. And, as a collector, I would wish for at least a two disc digipack case.
Maybe someday, they will decide to deliver this classic in a ""Collector's Edition"".
Until that day, this edition is the one to go with.

1237985,4,B00000JQUA,"Although Nicholas Ray's film on the life of Christ has its flaws, it is easily the best of the motion pictures made on the life of Christ. True, not exactly a ringing endorsement but far superior to the likes of the ponderous over reverent GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD, the kinky S&M PASSION OF THE CHRIST or the unbearable pretentious simplicity of GOSPEL ACCORDING TO SAINT MATTHEW. Ray's approach is to present the story in a straight forward manner that never allows the spectacle to dwarf the purity of the story. There are three cinematographers credited so I don't know who should get credit for some of the excellent compositions, it's not consistent. Neither is the acting which is all over the map. Jeffrey Hunter, while terribly miscast as Jesus, is adequate (and more than that when delivering the sermon on the mount). Ron Randell as a Roman soldier and Viveca Lindfors as Pilate's wife are quite good. Not surprising since they have the more complex characters in the film but Brigid Bazlen as Salome is simply awful and Harry Guardino as Barabbas is as out of place here as Harvey Keitel was in LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. Also starring Robert Ryan, Rip Torn, Rita Gam, Hurd Hatfield, Frank Thring and Siobhan McKenna. Miklos Rozsa delivers one of his best scores.

1238011,3,B00000JQUA,"To start, we have Mr. Hunter, clearly a non-Jew, playing the King of the Jews.  Oddly, that is the norm for such films.  Next up, as if the gospel story isn't exciting enough, countless rabbit trails are introduced, most of them entirely manufactured by the writers, while others are the offspring of pure legend.  With so few Christians actually reading scripture to authenticate what they watch on TV or film, the silver screen takes over as the ""real"" truth, leaving unwary watchers to be deceived with a great sense of detail.

Having adequately said ""viewer beware,"" I admit this movie is one of Hollywood's biblical masterpieces, from a reverently haunting musical score to a literal cast of thousands to flesh out the crowd scenes.  The feel of the story is one of religious devotion, albeit a definite novel more so than a gospel-truth replica of scripture.

I reluctantly recommend King of Kings, but regret the decision to glitz it up with highly unnecessary literary ""license.""",1307750400,5,988,4.957575757575758
1238012,4,B00000JQUA,"The film:

Maybe I've been spoiled by more modern versions of the story, such as Mel Gibson's ""Passion,"" or ""The Last Temptation."" But this particular version of the Christ story is kind of bloodless. Christ's teachings are not particularly well represented, and many key moments (water into wine, overturning the money tables) are either skipped, or told in dialogue from the perspective of others. Lots of time is spent on Herod Antipas for some reason, with little overall effect. Hurd Hatfield is not particularly good as an effete Pontius Pilate, either. Jeff Hunter is pretty good as Jesus, when he gets anything to say or do, that is. I guess my main problem with this film is that we never get to know Jesus the human being. There is very little flavor to this Jesus. The music is nice - it provides most of the actual emotion which is present.

The Blu-Ray:

Any problems I have with the film do not affect what is a truly splendid Blu-Ray from an A/V perspective. The 70mm ""Cinerama"" film is presented in a lovely 1080p transfer. Detail is very, very good. Colors are rock solid and vibrant. Black levels are inky and stable. Motion is handled well. Intrusive DNR or edge enhancement seem absent. There is a decent sheen of very fine film grain. This probably looks just as good as the recent ""Ten Commandments,"" and is better in some respects, as that film was hampered by some obvious optical compositing effects.

The audio is just as nice. The musical score, probably the highlight of the movie, is lush. Dialogue is crisp and clear. Fight scenes bristle with surround sounds. Overall, very nice.

Extras are sadly lacking. Basically, we get about 7 minutes worth of ""vintage"" features. The trailer is unrestored. Two newsreels of premiere events are snoozers. A vintage feature talking about filming looks as if it were transferred from VHS. This movie is really crying out for a commentary track or a contemporary feature telling us about the making of, situating it in context. But we get nothing.

Conclusion:

For the price, this is a nice A/V treat for your HD system. As a representation of 70mm film preservation, it can't be beat. But the movie is just middling in my book, and the extras are abysmal. So I'd call it a qualified recommendation, but only at a discount price.",1307491200,4,2297,4.741854636591479

The picture and sound quality are very good and I am glad Warner's have looked after this classic from the early 1960's

The film has a very mixed bag of actors from Jeffrey Hunter (Captain Christopher Pike, Star Trek pilot / The Menagerie), Robert Ryan (mainly in westerns), Rip Torn, Royal Dano and narration by Orson Wells.

I love most of the music by Miklos Rozsa but was rather shocked to see the high price for the CD now out of print.

Anyway, some very good news, it is available as a digital download from that large firms music store named after a piece of fruit for a very good price (all 43 tracks from the 2 CD album).

1238016,5,B00000JQUA,"I saw this movie when it was brand new on my 12th birthday. I loved it then and I love it now. For me, everything about it works. One of the most dynamic elements is Jeffrey Hunter who looks and feels like Jesus. I've gotten really tired of seeing scrawny actors playing a man who was a carpenter and undoubtedly had a strong physique. Jeffrey Hunter played the character very reverently and he really seemed to be living the role. His Sermon on the Mount, while taking some liberties with the account from the Bible, was wonderful.

Additional cast members also played their roles very, very well. Irish actress Sobhian McKenna is a wonderful mother Mary. She has a very nice dialogue with another wonderful actress, Carmen Sevilla who plays Mary Magdalene. Mary Magdalene tells mother Mary that she is a great sinner. Mother Mary calmly replies, ""Who will share my table."" Ron Randell also plays a wonderful character, the Roman Soldier Lucius who first persecutes the Jews, under orders, and ultimately recognizes the truth of Jesus and His mission. Rip Torn is very good as the conflicted Judas. Australian actor, Frank Thring, is great as the weak ruler Harod. Hurt Hatfield does a splendid job as Pontius Pilate. Robert Ryan is noteworthy as the pious John the Baptist. Other movies about the life of Jesus have portrayed John the Baptist as a ranting and raving fanatic. I have never pictured him that way and this movie doesn't either.

The cinematography and art direction are excellent and there are wonderful sets that really help to create the impression of ancient Israel. I don't know who did the voice-over for the devil in the temptation scene but it sounded like Ray Milland.

Probably the best element in the movie, to me, is the magnificent score by Miklos Rozsa, who was well-known for scoring such wonderful epics as Ben Hur and El Cid. The score here is wonderfully reverential and really conveys the feelings of power, majesty, joy and sorrow.

I've seen this movie many times and I am not at all bothered by some of the things that other people have criticized it for. If I had made it, I would be very, very proud of it. I find it wonderfully inspiring and uplifting.",1304208000,3,2192,4.715404699738904

Bronston's epics were certainly impressive and this one is no exception.  Director Nicholas Ray had a hard time with it, but his handling of the Jesus myth is both provocative and satisfying.  He wisely avoids typical Hollywood piety in favor of wide-ranging historical politics.  Bronston meddled with the editing, to the detriment of some performances, but the film remains elegantly visual, imaginative and intelligent.

Jeffrey Hunter, who plays Jesus, is just right for the intelligence and sensitivity of the role, and the character of Jesus is shown with great reverence. Star Trek fans will remember Hunter as Captain Christoper Pike in ""The Cage"". The character of Barabbas is emphasized more in this film than in the Bible, and the actress playing Herod's daughter is memorable, though that character is also briefly mentioned in Scripture.  It's not a film with a high budget, but the scenes are tastefully done with beautiful sets which look much like the Bible times they portray, and the wardrobe is quite authentic too. The film was made in wide screen (like Ben Hur but on a much lower budget), which adds something to the visual appeal. This DVD is of good quality with fine sound and picture, although there is little bonus material except for a trailer and some advertising.

1238074,5,B00000JQUA,"I think a previous reviewer fails to comprehend the importance of deeply understanding how the Jewish world in which Jesus lived and the Roman occupation the inhabitants of Judea endured are to really appreciating the message Jesus came to give us. I refer specifically to the expectation that the Jewish people had that Jesus deliver them from the Romans using his power in their physical world when Jesus was about delivering humanity from sin to everlasting life in an eternal unseen world. I recall the part where Jesus comes to visit John the Baptist informing Lucius that he has come to free John. Baffled, Lucius asks Jesus just how he plans to free John outside the prison walls. Jesus replied that he plans to free John WITHIN the prison walls. I also would suggest to any reviewer who might be similarly critical that they read Jim Bishop's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-Christ-Died/dp/B0002NQ2AM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day Christ Died</a>. This book originally published in 1957 and again  released in 1991 gives the reader an indepth look at the life of Jesus Christ, the man, as he struggled between the human and divine side of his persona.  I think if this reviewer would read that he or she would understand why this was incorporated into this film.

The film itself is phenomenal. I have been watching it since it first came out in 1961, almost on an annual basis, for years only on television. I was so happy when I finally was able to purchase a video of it and now I am buying a DVD.  They just do not make movies like this anymore. I have seen a number of actors attempt to play Jesus but none with the depth of passion that Jeffrey Hunter did in this movie. The scene where John the Baptist meets Jesus in the river, looking him in the eye and realizing that he has no sin and thus no need to be baptized; the scene were John the Baptist is reaching up his hand to touch the hand of Jesus from outside the prison cell where John is confined; the scenes of the miracles that Jesus performed; the Sermon on the Mount; and the Passion and Crucifixtion of our Lord Jesus Christ.

ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS: AFTER THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST, HE NOT ONLY REUNITES WITH HIS DISCIPLES BUT HE ALSO IS SEEN IN THE VILLAGE WHERE HE GOES ABOUT PERFORMING MORE MIRACLES.

AS A CONSUMER I ABSOLUTELY RESENT THIS SORT OF THING. WHEN I BUY A COPY OF A MOVIE I EXPECT TO BUY THE VERSION I SAW. MOVIES THAT WERE PRODUCED IN DECADES PAST WERE PRETTY TAMED COMPARED TO WHAT WE SEE TODAY. YET THE MOVIES TODAY CONTAIN ALOT MORE FILTH THAN ANYTHING WE SAW AT THAT TIME.

1238077,4,B00000JQUA,"This film has received its unfair share of criticism over the decades. The MGM offering was snubbed at the Academy Awards.  The only Golden Globe nomination was for the score. The acting talents of Jeffrey Hunter were unappreciated. The mockery continued when the film was taunted as ""The Teenage Jesus.""

The film related the familiar story of the birth of Jesus and the three years of his ministry leading to his crucifixion.  It had as well the backstory of the times-the Roman occupation, the Jewish resistance fighters, a religious system steeped in tradition and ceremony, and the emergence of a new way of religious thought and practice.

Hungarian composer, Miklos Rozsa, created a score both classical and stirring to the soul. The Spanish cinematography by Manuel Berenguer, Franz Planer and Milton Krasner added the color of life to this two thousand year old story.

Orson Welles did the narration penned by Ray Bradbury. Robert Ryan gave a subtle yet powerful portrayal of John the Baptist, cousin of Jesus. John paid the ultimate price for preaching the truth-arrested, imprisoned, and beheaded.

The most underscored performance was given by Ron Randell as Lucius, the Roman Centurion.  His presence from the beginning to the end added a continuity element. Lucius gradually became a believer in Jesus.

Of course, you have the assortment of men and women who were ruled by their passion and ambition-Pontius Pilate, Herod Antipas, Barabbas, Herodias, Salome, Judas Iscariot, and Caiaphas.  These characters were tragic yet essential to what would unfold.

Going back to Jeffrey Hunter's performance, he brought a youth and vigor to Jesus which has lasted for the generation who saw this film as children.

Rebel Barabbas is freed and becomes the first man for whom Jesus dies. Like other movies from the period, there is no blood in battle scenes. It seems strange. There is no humor unless you count the perverse glee of Herodias when she is given the head of John the Baptist.

1238105,5,B00000JQUA,"I  thought George Stevens' impeccably crafted and literate THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD (1965) was the finest life of Jesus Christ on film.  Then I took another look recently at director Nicholas Ray's KING OF KINGS (1961) and changed my mind.  I don't know what the best life of Jesus is, but KING OF KINGS has a charismatic and sympathetic Christ (Jeffrey Hunter in the performance of his career), a great John the Baptist (Robert Ryan), the definitive Salome's dance (luscious Brigid Bazlen) and the ultimate Sermon on the Mount (with 7,000 extras on a Spanish hillside), a striking Last Supper with disciples sitting at a Y-shaped bench, a strong Crucifixion, and a reverent Resurrection.  At 171 minutes (including ten minutes of Miklos Rozsa music), Samuel Bronston's production seems the ideal length to tell the story of Christ.  The screenplay is by Oscar winner Philip Yordan.

I have often had trouble with Ron Randell as the Roman Lucius; he is a major character here and only a cameo in other Biblical epics.  Same with Harry Guardino as Barabbas.  They are, in actuality, the second and third most important characters in Ray's film.  But both actors are magnificent.  Lucius lets us inside the Roman power circle to understand the Roman way of thinking, so it is nice to have his role be big.  And Barabbas answers the question a lot of viewers may ponder, namely who was this convicted killer whom the crowd chose to live while Jesus died.

The movie, narrated by Orson Welles, starts the story with Pompey in Judea in 63 B.C.  This helps give us information on what Judea was like in the several decades before Jesus was born.  Among a superb supporting cast are Siobhan McKenna as Mary, Royal Dano as Peter, Hurd Hatfield as Pontius Pilate, Viveca Lindfors as Herod Antipas' mistress, Frank Thring as Herod Antipas, and many more.  The sets and costumes are gloriously colorful; what was the Academy thinking when they were not nominated for Oscars in 1961, along with no cast mermbers or screenplay?  Rozsa's music is glorious.  And the movie is presented on DVD in about a 2.2 ratio for 70mm Super Technirama.

KING OF KINGS is powerful, intelligent, colorful, and reverent.  I think Jesus himself would be impressed by it.",1177027200,12,2243,4.83989501312336
1238106,4,B00000JQUA,"This film of course is now somewhat obscure considering all that has been done since the time of the film on the life of Christ. Jeffery Hunter is the most handsome Christ you will ever see on screen. The apostles are all clean cut. The movie features very colorful clothing to catch the eye. A great musical score by Miklos Roza, which is a particular favorite of classical music fans to request on the radio even today! The Gospel is rather compressed and the ministry of Christ in particular. However, that is not to say it is ineffective. The Sermon on the Mount scene is actually an encapsulated all comprehensive review of Christian philosophical points boiled down to one mass meeting. The movie is not adherent to Bible events and contains a lot of fiction, especially with respect to the activity of the aristocracy and the romans. It tries to tell several stories, such as Barabbas, a Roman Officer, Mary the mother of Christ, John the Baptist and definitely has the most beautiful Salome you will ever see dance on screen. The taking of the cross, the whipping, the death, are all handled very delicately. Not too much blood or grief. Jeffery Hunter is seen after the Easter rising and is shown symbolically at the end very well with the apostles gathered on the beach and his shadow overwhelms them as he tells them to depart to preach the Gospel and they leave 2 by 2. A really effective scene for a movie so entrenched in 50s culture.  Having seen this movie as a child in the sixties and seeing it again now in this century, I think it should not be too criticized with our 20/20 perception now. Back then it was after all a different time and culture, one that does not exist today and should be viewed perhaps in a nostalgic way, worth a viewing, but don't depend on it for filling you in on Biblical truth.",1175299200,12,1824,4.527272727272727

1238108,3,B00000JQUA,"Nicholas Ray did really a poor job in this movie; with all the extras, and money they spent in costumes and fabulous stages... I don't want to put down the film completely because it is still worth watching, specially for those who've been in the closet the last 20 years or so.

The dialogues are bad, not just because there's no talent in their writing but because (and specially) they left out the Gospel words (who can write better than God Himself?). Besides, the author of this film conceived other scenes than can be assumed to have happened but are not part of the Gospel story (it wasn't interesting enough for Hollywood?). Well, definitely they've made the movie less interesting, more boring, clumsy, childish, almost ridiculous. And I still say 'watch it', yes.

I didn't like the casting either. Hunter as Jesus? So, so. Why? Because he may look fine, but the acting is in line with the whole movie, poor.

One thing I'd like to give credit to: Ryan's casting as John the Baptist. He does it superbly. He's just a great actor, simple as that.

It is sad to say that such a superproduction (another Samuel Bronston production with Spanish locations) that tells the greatest story ever has failed this way.

...but, still, have the little ones watch it.",1166659200,4,1264,4.701357466063349
1238109,5,B00000JQUA,"Other film reviewers have characterized Nicholas Ray as primarily a strong director of film noir and other dramatic creations that focused on the individual's psyche. Many of his films attained cult status, many were relatively low budget, i.e., In A Lonely Place, On Dangerous Ground, etc. This film is quite different from them. The screenwriter, Philip Yordan, wrote many hard-hitting dramas spanning three decades, and this screenplay continued his excellence in realistic, spare dialogue. There are no long-winded speeches in this film, and it achieved its purpose largely because of the way Ray directed it.

Yordan collaborated with Nicholas Ray on a few other films, and the two of them have fashioned, in King Of Kings, a similar dramatic structure taking place two thousand years ago. If one is a sensitive person, he or she will automatically be drawn to this film. Nicholas Ray had a definite romantic streak in his soul, which was amply delineated in King Of Kings' many scenes that can be viewed over and over. Pick virtually any scene in the movie, and you will not be able to stop yourself from feeling Ray's sensitivity portrayed in these bibilical characters. However, it is not just the screenplay and direction, but the overall production itself, that make this film truly memorable. I think that you have to be in the mood for the film's length, and it is a far cry from the visually stimulating films you see these days, ones in which the quick cut is the rule. Not for Nicholas Ray, though, and the viewer has plenty of opportunities to study the film's characters, since Ray's camera spends just the right amount of time on each of the characters' faces for us to feel their emotions. The characters' movements are key to appreciating the film; there was no other director who could convey feeling through movement.

The acting is uniformly excellent, aided by Yordan's realistic dialogue. Several reviewers have lauded Jeffrey Hunter's Jesus, which is deserved, while Robert Ryan demonstrated the range to accomplish the role of John the Baptist with great authority. Unfortunately, his role was typically short in that it left Ryan devotees again Jonesing for more of him in the picture. This was a sad state that Ryan seemed to experience in too many of his films.

King Of Kings' use of 70 mm Technirama wasn't lost on this DVD, which brings to true light imaginative sets, colorful costumes that one actually notices when watching the film. Orson Welles provided the stirring narration penned by Ray Bradbury. The reason that Welles allegedly dissassociated himself from the film must be viewed in the context of the film's background circumstances. The film was cut and pasted by Producer Samuel Bronston, and characters were deleted in the final editing phase. One can actually see British actor, Anthony Steele, in the background for a few seconds when Jesus arrives in Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. I would love to have seen the unexpurgated version of the film.

The acting is superb from all cast members; Hurd Hatfield's performance was called over the top by an Internet reviewer, an absurd statement. His performance was perfect in my opinion. Also, Rip Torn, quite appropriate, Frank Thring, complicated portrait, Harry Guardino *ignore the New York accent, Bridget Bazlen, Rita Gam, Viveca Lindfors, Siobhann McKenna, all well done, Lindfors and McKenna very affecting as their sensitivity, character actor, Royal Dano, emaciated but convincing in his cowardice, Ron Randell, Australian actor who should have had better success in Hollywood, Guy Rolphe and George Coulouris (their roles seem clearly to have been shortened, especially Coulouris).

I second the motion of 99 percent of the reviewers of this movie, i.e., those who liked and appreciated the film. It is a must-see, must own, particularly if you have a high definition widescreen television. The colors and cinematography, coupled with the continuously engaging score, are amazing. Some of the scenes were so gorgeously re-created that they brought back memories I had seeing the film in the theater when it came out in 1961.

1238134,5,B00000JQUA,"For all its low reputation, Samuel Bronston's much-mocked King of Kings is easily the best and most intelligent of the `devotional' versions of the life of Christ, largely because it sets Jesus as a historical figure and, to a degree, a victim of history and politics in troubled times. More importantly, it manages to do it without being as relentlessly dreary and one-note as George Stevens' The Greatest Story Ever Told, which becomes more of an endurance test with each passing year. Even the vigorously-staged battle scenes serve a real dramatic purpose, pitting Barabbas' Davidic warrior would-be Messiah against Jesus' spiritual deliverer (""I am fire, he is water - how can we ever meet?"") that is many ways the real conflict of the film: the fight between material pragmatism (the Romans, Herod, Barabbas) and spiritual idealism (Jesus and his followers). Even Caiphas is given a very modern reading, not as a black-hearted villain but as an unpopular Roman-appointed religious leader who genuinely cares for his flock, fearing that Jesus' popularity could be used by the Romans to start a Holocaust that will destroy his people.

There's much imagination at work too: while Jeffrey Hunter's Messiah suffers from MGM's insistence on redubbing the part in more `masterful' tones, he proactively interacts with the crowd in the Sermon on the Mount, played almost like a press conference, while the Last Supper takes its visual design not from Da Vinci but from the CND's peace symbol. The casting IS variable - Robert Ryan's John the Baptist, Hurd Hatfield's Pontius Pilate, Harry Guardino's Barabbas, Ron Randell's centurion, Guy Rolfe's Caiphas and Gregoire Aslan and the great Frank Thring as Herod Sr. and Jr. are fine, but Rip Torn is surprisingly awkward as an otherwise well-conceived Judas Iscariot doomed by compromise, Royal Dano's Simon Peter is a better idea on paper than onscreen (particularly when given dialog) and Siobhan McKenna's eminently punchable misty-eyed Mary is a tad too Oirish Catlic for my tastes. Yet despite its weaknesses and the virtual sidelining of Jesus for much of the running time - this is more a film about His times and His effect on those around Him than His life - it's never less than totally involving, and often genuinely moving.

Despite reputedly losing interest in post-production, Nicholas Ray's direction is excellent, his mastery of the wide screen making great use of the 70mm format and showing real inspiration in his handling of some of the miracles, scenes greatly enhanced by Miklos Rozsa's superlative score. Even Ray Bradbury's poetic narration, beautifully delivered by Orson Welles, originally intended as a quick fix to paper over the cracks in the narrative, genuinely adds to the film's complex political picture of an occupied territory. Not that some of the cracks aren't still visible, as in the meaningful exchange of looks on the Temple steps between Jesus and Richard Johnson (whose constantly changing part - one day a freed gladiator, the next an Arab, the next a Romanized Jew - was otherwise totally deleted). But they're minor complaints in an extraordinary epic that achieves more of its ambitions than its given credit for.

Incidentally, how on earth did they get the obscene graffiti on the barracks walls past the censors in 1961? Less obvious on the DVD copy, you can't miss it on the 70mm prints!

Warner's DVD is a beautiful transfer and, unlike MGM/UA's slightly cropped laserdisc issue, in the correct aspect ratio. Extras are thin, though - a teaser trailer and brief newsreel footage.",1145318400,13,3578,5.111111111111111
1238135,5,B00000JQUA,"I am an agnostic and usually have no interest in Biblical movies. So why does this film move me so much? I guess Nicholas Ray's excellent direction, Jeffery Hunter's sensitive portrayal of Jesus, and Miklos Rosza's haunting and unforgettable music are the reason.

Ray's depiction of Jesus as a political figure makes him much more real to a non-spiritual person like me - as does Hunter's excellent acting. My favourite scene is when John The Baptist meets Jesus for the first time and realises he's with the Messiah - this scene has no dialogue but still is incredibly affecting thanks to excellent widescreen close-ups of Robert Ryan's and Hunter's eyes meeting.

1238140,4,B00000JQUA,"""King of Kings"" is somewhat tame compared to many other films on the life of Jesus, but is still nevertheless well worth watching. It does not have the grandeur and visual beauty of the George Stevens ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" (1965),  or the intensity of the silent Cecil B. DeMille ""King of Kings"" (1927) that it is supposed to be based on, but it is always reverential towards its subject matter, even if at a rather slow pace. Many of the events told in the Gospels are simply read, rather than depicted, and this job goes to a Roman named Lucius (well played by Ron Randell), and the magnificent voice of Orson Welles as narrator. There is also a fair amount of extraneous material in trying to describe the political climate of the time, and to expand on the life of Jesus.

Jeffrey Hunter, an underrated actor during his short lifetime and handful of films, is a handsome Jesus, with crystal blue eyes, and is very effective in the temptation in the desert, and the Sermon on the Mount. His youthful good looks made some people nickname this film ""I Was a Teenage Jesus,"" even though Hunter was in his mid 30s at the time. Others in the cast are Siobhan McKenna as Mary, Harry Guardino as Barrabas, Rip Torn as Judas, and Hurd Hatfield as Pontius Pilate. Robert Ryan makes a good, grizzled John the Baptist, and of all the film Salomes, Brigid Bazlen is the best. Her voluptuous seduction of a drunken, lascivious Herod (Frank Thring) is terrific storytelling and quite believable.

Directed by Nicholas Ray, the film has a grand score by Miklos Rozsa, and the cinematography, shot on location in Spain, is by Manuel Berenguer. In my extensive ""Jesus"" film collection, this is the one I play the least, but it has value in many of its performances, and as a comparison to other films of this theme.

One reviewer (who's piece is titled ""YOU FUNDAMENTALISTS MAKE ME SICK"") made a statement critical of people who objected to the film's deviations from traditional scripture. I admire the film's attempt to provide some historical backdrop, but it should be kept to just that: not corny, unfounded speculations or unnecessary plot filler. I don't object on any spiritual grounds (I'm an atheist); I just don't think this creative scriptwriting is very effective. The invented dialogue between Lucias, Pilate, and Jesus during the trial is just plain dumb. The scene where the Romans find evidence that the Zealots are making weapons: idiotic. At the same time, it is interesting to note that this film casts Judas Iscariot as being in league with the Zealots. It is this one small detail that makes this film worth seeing from a film historian's standpoint as this idea has made it's way into quite a few other movies about Jesus since (including ""Jesus Of Nazareth"" and ""The Last Temptation Of Christ""). What's behind this? There is a very popular theory that ""Iscariot"" is actually a copyist's error and should probably read ""Sicariot."" The theory maintains that ""Iscariot"" is probably not a surname. However, ""Judas Sicariot"" would translate as ""Judas the terrorist"" (from ""Sicaii,"" a faction of the Zealots who carried out political assassinations - hence Harvey Keitel's portrayal of the character in ""The Last Temptation Of Christ""). The film's attempt to bridge the gap between the Biblical and the Historical Jesus is admirable. Unfortunately, in 1961, there wasn't as much information to assist literary criticism on Scripture as there is today (especially after the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are still undergoing publication to this day). Therefore, many of the augmented passages of this film only serve to make an already long film longer. Hollywood - that's all I have to say. This film is a relic from a genre that has (hopefully) spent itself. The DVD has some nice extras. Rent it, don't buy.",1104192000,6,2463,4.980582524271845
1238154,5,B00000JQUA,"Okay, I will admit there are some stunning films about Christ. But this is my personal favorite. It is not accurate in costume or perhaps in the events per se, but visually it is stunning, grand and beautifully acted. Jeffrey Hunter also looked great as the annointed one and played the part with great sensitivity.

Whether you are a Christian or even believe the story of the Christ, this is still a wonderful story and one that has endured for many centuries. This is a beautiful film in any book.

1238155,5,B00000JQUA,"I first saw the King of Kings as a young girl on the big screen where everything seems to translate better, for example; those close-ups of Hunter's piercing blue eyes but since I have become a more 'mature, well-read person' this rendition of the life of Christ is pretty heavy handed with Roman history, for example, Tiberius never had a daughter as portrayed by Viveca Lindfors. The Romans were invited in to settle a dispute/civil war that had been ensuing over the appointment of High Priest and this underscores what a long bloody graveyard Israel has been for sometime. BUT the absolute beauty, 50% of the movie is the score written by the genius Miklos Rozsa and though the Zefferelli masterpiece ""Jesus of Nazareth"" is a far more intelligent portrayal, the King of Kings carries great emotional weight for me personally. I highly recommend it. It still holds itw own desite its shortcomings.",1082419200,5,900,4.888888888888889
1238156,4,B00000JQUA,"The 1961 remake of ""King of Kings"" (it was originally a 1927 silent film) is the most political of the Hollywood epics on the life of Jesus, a genre that would include ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" and ""Jesus of Nazareth"" but not ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" or ""The Passion of the Christ.""  By ""political"" I mean that Jesus is born into what is clearly a political world.  The film begins with Pompey the Great, the Roman conqueror of Israel, profaning the Temple.  The Jews are presented as an enslaved people, put to work in quarries to produce the stone for Roman monuments, making it seem like we are covering the same ground as ""The Ten Commandments.""  Herod the Great is presented as being an Arab who is installed as the ""King of the Jews"" and who crucifies hundreds of his rebellious subjects.
Pilate (Hurd Hatfield) is apparently married to the daughter of the Emperor Tiberius, and therefore has aspirations of becoming the next Caesar.  Pilate and Herod Antipas (Frank Thring), along with their wives, apparently eat dinner together every night.  ""King of Kings"" also has the distinction of having the biggest battle scene in a movie about Jesus as the men of Barabbas (Harry Guardino), pointedly called patriots and not zealots, attack a column of Roman centurions.  At one point Pilate asks, ""How many men does he have?""  The centurion replies, ""God, Jesus or Barabbas?""  ""Barabbas,"" answers Pilate.  The Jews are clearly a political problem for the Roman procurator, who is offended that Jerusalem is bedecked with statues of the Roman gods.
When I watched this film again today it seemed clear to me that screenwriter Philip Yordan is not happy with the story found in the Gospels and keeps creating new scenes.  John the Baptist (Robert Ryan) goes to see Mary (Siobhan McKenna) and Jesus goes to visit John in prison (so much for the rather sobering idea that the only time these two cousins ever met was when John baptized Jesus).  John argues for Jesus to go to Jerusalem at the start of his ministry, and when Jesus chooses a different path, John goes instead, making it really easy for Herod Atipas to arrest him.  Meanwhile, Mary is overly resistant to her son beginning his ministry; no doubt this is intended to be foreshadowing of the death of Jesus, but it does reflect poorly on her faith (compared this to the powerful portrayal of Mary in Mel Gibson's film or the serene faith of the mother of Jesus in ""Jesus of Nazareth"").
In many ways this film does not trust Jeffrey Hunter with the role of Jesus that he is playing.  Many of the miracles are done with heavenly music playing and often Orson Welles narration (written by an uncredited Ray Bradbury) takes great pains to tell us what we are seeing (Welles has a curious habit of pronouncing all of the letters if the word ""apostle"").  I do not think Jesus says anything before he saves the adulteress with the wonderful first stone criteria.  But then this film does a complete about face and lets Hunter do what I think is the longest segment in one of these films concerning the Sermon on the Mount.
Ultimately, this is the pivotal scene of ""King of Kings.""  The key thing is that this is a Jesus who comes down from the Mount to walk amongst the people and talk more directly to them.  Hunter does have a few good moments, where he clearly comes across as trying to persuade the multitude to be righteous instead of just preaching platitudes.  This is a Jesus who is trying to relate, which results in a curious juxtaposition of a Sixties ""cool"" Jesus and a political climate reflecting a Fifties ""Cold War"" mentality.
This film was produced at the start of the Sixties, so Jesus is not really being portrayed as a hippie, but the long hair is certainly there.  Hunter's natural stare has an inherent element of rebuke in it, so it is not like this Jesus is any type of hippie.  The attempt at a more naturalistic delivery by Jesus does work at times during the Sermon, and it is the one scene that justifies watching this epic.  Hunter's performance also stands out in comparison to those of his disciplines, where neither Royal Dano as Peter or a young Rip Torn as Judas distinguish themselves in any way; Pilate and Herod Antipas are the two most interesting characters in the film, set up because for this film the crucifixion of Jesus is clearly a political act.
It was explained to me once how each of the four Gospels has a different perspective on the life of Jesus and essentially a different purpose.  In looking at the major films made about the life of Jesus you can probably make a similar claim.  Of those films, ""King of Kings"" with its heavy political themes becomes the easiest one to so label.",1081641600,10,4700,4.634939759036144
1238157,5,B00000JQUA,I love this movie. Interesting backstory told as well. Jeffrey Hunter did a great job playing our Lord. The sermon on the mount scene was brilliantly done. Narration by the unbilled Orson Welles himself. What's not to love about this movie?,1080518400,5,240,4.878048780487805
1238158,4,B00000JQUA,"I have never seen this film before.  My favorite is JESUS OF NAZARETH (1977).  I am just about to sit down (with popcorn) and enjoy King of Kings starring Jeffery Hunter as ""Jesus"".  You may recall Jeffery Hunter on VHS video or a syndicated television special of the never-before-seen Star Trek pilot, THE CAGE.  Here is my review: Narrated by Orson Welles.  The film begins with some 33 years before Jesus was born.  Caesar overtaking a kingdom.  Finding the scrolls that Moses had written laying atop a valuable piece of metal.  Caesar appointing Herod, and then Joseph the carpenter and Mary finding a place for Jesus the baby to be easily born.  I was impressed with this version.  Easy to follow and easy to watch.  Still in this 2 hours and 50 minutes film, so many important details and miracles of Jesus were not filmed.  I'm sure that Jesus did not wear a zippered red jacket and there were no buttons in the back of clothing back then, but that's Hollywood.  Don't let this distract you from enjoying this fine movie.  This is a good film for children to watch.  There is no nudity, no offensive things and no medical procedures that will be said here.  But as always, the Crucifixion is hard to watch.  This version does include when Jesus was arisen and visiting his diciples though not filmed in detail.  Movie includes Overture, Intermission, Entr'acte, End Music.",1079395200,3,1379,4.698744769874477
1238169,4,B00000JQUA,"Samuel Bronston's production of ""King of Kings"" is a generally satisfying ""epic"" based on the life of Jesus. Not as elaborate as 1965's ""The Greatest Story Ever Told,"" but not as boring either.
Directed by Nicholas Ray, the auteur behind ""Rebel Without A Cause"" and ""Johnny Guitar,"" it was controversial at the time of its 1961 release with some critics finding it blasphemous (the very characteristic that would likely earn it praise today), apparently because the miracles are presented with a certain subtlety, a quality not generally associated with a genre mastered by Cecil B. DeMille. This is not a thorough adaptation of the Gospels, and far below the standards of the later ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" but it is respectful and generally well-done.
The late Jeffrey Hunter makes for a very charismatic Jesus. Then 33 years-old, the same age as Jesus at the crucifixion, Hunter gives a sincere performance, one that didn't warrant the ""Teenage Jesus"" charge popular at the time. The unjustified pans his performance received did seem to have a negative impact on his career, with the actor turning to TV as the star of the Jack Webb produced ""Temple Houston"" only a year or two later). Robert Ryan, usually cast as psychotics and killers, gives some appropriate muscle to John the Baptist.
Orson Welles narrates from a script to which Ray Bradbury contributed. Miklos Rosza's score is superb and inspiring, the best thing about the film.",1077840000,10,1437,5.01673640167364
1238170,5,B00000JQUA,"One of many intriguing acts filmed by Cecil B. DeMille in his 1927 classic, THE KING OF KINGS, begins when Mary of Magdala makes a vivid entrance aboard her chariot pulled by a team of exotic zebras!  The seductive temptress exits her chauffeured, zebra-drawn ride to confront the One who has been disrupting her business in the world's oldest profession.  Mary's meeting does not turn out as intended, however.  At this divine appointment, she suddenly  finds herself in the very presence of God Himself veiled in human flesh named Jesus Christ.  Her Maker who has known her all her life -- who created her within her mother's womb -- now looks upon her, disappointed in what she has become.  When the Magdalene looks into the eyes of Christ and the face of God, an extraordinary transformation proceeds.  His countenance locks onto her soul.  The piercing stare of Jesus cuts through her fragile facade like x-ray vision, seeing into the deepest recesses of her heart and into the very essence of her being.  Mary's soul is laid bare, and the shame of her wickedness is exposed.  She realizes that without a Savior she is lost and undone.  Although condemnation may be expected, forgiveness and rehabilitation are offered.  Witness then the awesome power of God's merciful love as it overcomes Mary with a never-before-experienced sense of hope and peace.  ""Be thou clean!"" her Deliverer and Exorcist demands.  Next, a shocking spectacle unfolds.  The impressive special effects employed in this scene supply a riveting sequence of ghostly and ghastly demons being cast out of Mary.  One evil spirit after another is identified and expelled:  Lust! Greed! Pride! Gluttony! Indolence! Envy! Anger!  (Although, the Biblical reference cited in Luke 8:2 does concur that seven demons were cast out, the actual sins associated with them are not revealed but are left to DeMille's creative license, suggesting them to be the famous Seven Deadly Sins.)  The remarkable deliverance and exorcism of Mary Magdalene is one of the most amazing re-enactments ever recorded on film.  Immediately, modesty and renewed purity overwhelm Mary, causing her to cover her body as she repents from her former life of rebellion.  Though her sins were as staining as scarlet, the sin-destroying blood of Christ washes them all away whiter than snow.  She is now a follower of Christ.  Mary of Magdala encountered God!

Sadly, there are so many elements that are fictional, they are not found in either scripture nor any historical sources. The large scale attack led by Barabas against the romans, Jesus' visiting of John the Baptist in Prison, are just a few of the things that have been fictionalized. Even the portrayal of the political landscape of the time is so inaccurate. The whole movie is so very theatrical in its presentation that it just lacks a sense of realism.

1238173,4,B00000JQUA,"As soneone who grew up in the era of the widescreen, epic Biblical dramas, I am pleased that the DVD process preserves the quality of the original negatives and soundtracks.  KING OF KINGS looks and sounds terrific.  In the linear notes to the CD of the exciting Miklos Rozsa score, it states that, when completed, ""this film was a mess.""  There was no structure, just a lot of disjointed footage.  So a narrator was used to tie scenes together.  Thankfully that narrator was Orson Welles, who adds a wonderful, if originally unplanned, quality.  Today the narrator would probably be James Earl Jones.  Because of the fictional character of the Roman officer, Lucius, played by Ron Randell, who is supposed to represent the Gentile world's reaction to Jesus, time is lost for more intimate scenes between Jesus and his Disciples. This lack gives us, therefore, only a cursury view of Jesus.  As far as history is concerned, there is one glaring mistake.  In the beginning, Herod's son, Herod Antipas, is seen taking his father's throne.  In reality, Antipas's brother, another of Herod's sons, took the throne for ten years.  Antipas was never more than the ruler of Galilee.  The ""trial before Pilate"" scene also lacks emotion depth, as it takes place among only three participants: Jesus, Pilate and Lucius; where are the famous crowds? Martin Scorsese did a more complete attempt at an intimate look at the life of Jesus with THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST.  KING OF KINGS also seems to me to have a bright and shinning look to it and makes the ancient world seem less dirty and dingy than it probably was.  In the end, however, if we are talking about simple preservation of motion picture history, then the telecine and audio artists who created this DVD are to be applauded.",1062201600,3,1779,4.809210526315789

1238176,3,B00000JQUA,"In 1960 during production, reporters mockingly referred to KING OF KINGS as ""I Was A Teenage Jesus"" -- a reference to its star, blue-eyed heart throb Jeffrey Hunter.  According to scripture, Jesus never went more than 130 miles from his birthplace, never wrote a book, never led an army and never held office, yet He's impacted our culture, calendar and history more than anyone.
This nice-looking widescreen feature has the proverbial cast of thousands as well as Robert Ryan and Rip Torn. Miklos Rosa created the stirring, memorable score.  An uncredited Orson Welles delivers the near poetic narration said to have been written by Ray Bradbury (also uncredited).
In King of Kings, Nicholas Ray -- who several years earlier directed ""Rebel Without A Cause"" -- honors a different kind of rebel -- one with a cosmic cause.",1048464000,5,822,4.992700729927007
1238177,3,B00000JQUA,"Every so often, perhaps about once a year or so, I get in a mood to watch Epics. I dig through my collection and haul out gems like ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Cleopatra"", ""The Ten Commandments"" and the like, and devour them one after another like candy. ""King of Kings"" is one of the Epics that I never saw until recently, when my Epic mania drove me to purchase the DVD. I had heard so much about Jeff Hunter's Jesus, I just had to see it. After seeing the wonderful Max von Sydow, and even the enigmatic portrayal of Jesus in ""Ben-Hur"", I thought Hunter fell quite a bit short in filling Jesus' sandals.
Now, to be fair, I had also just recently viewed ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"", which may account for how disappointed I was with ""King of Kings"". ""TGSET"" was, in every sense, an Epic, while this film has a more condensed feel. Even though ""King of Kings"" qualifies as an Epic, it just didn't carry through on the Epic scale of other Bible Epics.
I have to say that I found Hunter's Jesus to be somewhat stiff, and almost an incidental character at times. The Jesus here is not an approachable figure, and radiates little warmth. Because he is so stiff throughout, when Hunter shows his grief and fear in the Garden, it looked as if Jesus was having a heart attack! The big miracles associated with Jesus are not shown either (walking on water, feeding the people, water into wine, etc.). Even the raising of Lazarus goes unmentioned, which just makes this Jesus look less... well, miraculous.

But Hunter is not the only poor casting choice here. Robert Ryan is great in almost everything, but his John the Baptist just doesn't seem to work. He seems miscast here, especially when compared with Charlton Heston in ""TGSET"". And, as is the want of Hollywood writers, Barabbas goes from being an incidental figure in the Christ story to becoming a leader of a Judean revolt against Rome in ""King of Kings"". While the battles he leads are spectacular, the whole Barabbas sub-plot took too much of the focus off of Jesus, and the film would have been better without it.
Don't get me wrong. There are some very good scenes, and the film is quite watchable. The Sermon on the Mount in perhaps the defining moment of the film, with some seven thousand extras filling the screen. Jesus wanders amongst the crowd on the hillside, answering individual questions put to him by the people. This was easily the best version of the Sermon I've yet seen.
A camera mounted to the top of the cross as it is raised gives a new dimension to the moment, and was something I do not believe had been done before, or attempted since. The camera placed high above Herod and others in the palace is also interesting.
I also liked how Jesus cured the sick. In a succession of shots, we see Jesus' shadow on the wall, the shadow of his hand approaching the figure he wishes to help. When his shadow touches the person, they slowly realize they are cured of their ailments. This was probably the most original way to show Jesus at work in any film I am currently aware of, and it worked very well.
Another plus is the reserved narration of the great Orsen Welles. While a more prevalent Welles would have been nice, he is nonetheless very effective in his duty as narrator. His casting here is somewhat of a redemption for Welles, who thought he would star as Christ in his own film version, a project that was sadly forever shelved because of the backlash over his opus to greed, ""Citizen Kane"".
Overall, this is a rather condensed and fairly inaccurate take on the life of Jesus. Despite some great moments, ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" is the better of the two, should you need to choose between them. To prove the point, let's take a scene that is in both films; the crowd wanting to stone Mary Magdeline. Hands down, ""TGSET"" is more poetic, more poignant, and more effective. The identical moment in the Hunter film is treated almost as an afterthought, the Hunter Jesus having little or no power over the crowd when he says, ""Let he who is without sin cast the first stone."" Max von Sydow, by comparison, really shames the crowd with his reading of the classic line. von Sydow holds a stone out to the mob, slowly sweeping his arm in a wide semi-circle to take in all those gathered around. Hunter thrusts the stone at individuals in no particular order, almost daring them to take it. Adding the Barabbas subplot highlights the fundamental difference between both films; one is more focused on highlights and action that occurred during the life of Christ, and the other on unraveling the mystery that surrounded the man who led the life of Christ.

""TGSET"" is far and away the superior film in just about every way one could imagine, but for a pure white conservative Christian viewer, ""King of Kings"" is probably the perfect version of the Jesus character and his life story. Even more so than Max von Sydow, and far more so than the fairly realistic portrayal of the Savior in ""Jesus of Nazareth"", the Jesus here is most decidedly the European take on the character (white, blonde, blue-eyed, no accent, etc.). As such, the Falwell crowd will not find their ideal threatened with ""King of Kings"". Even the crucifixion is surprisingly bloodless, so this may be the best version for the kiddies to watch. For grown-ups, although ""TGSET"" is much slower, it is also much more rewarding.",1048377600,7,5369,4.597497393117831

In fact, the first few minutes of the film will make you wonder if you are watching the right movie, as it reviews the Roman invasion of Judea.  The Romans, the family of Herod, the Sanhedrin and Barabbas with his Zealots all play roles in the trajedy.
Samuel Bronston, a producer whose production center was located outside of Madrid, envisioned a shorter movie along the artistic lines of ""The Gospel According to St. Matthew,"" simple and reverent.  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer saw the movie as a threat to its' current blockbuster hit, ""Ben-Hur.""  Bronston needed some additional financial backing and MGM stepped in, so that the release could be delayed until after ""Ben-Hur"" was finished with its' usual one year playing engagement.  At the same time, the tremendous audience response to the spectacle of ""Ben-Hur"" convinced MGM to expand the film and make it more spectacular.  At least an additional 45 minutes was tacked on the planned running time.
I find the film a great success.  By giving us the political milieu, it provides us a different slant on the well-known story and invokes interest with sub-plots.
Jeffrey Hunter took a lot of unnecessary abuse for his portrayal.  This was the first portrayal of Jesus by an actor who was around the same age as Christ during the events, but he was criticized as too young (???).  His piercing blue eyes added a sharp edge to his appearance, making him symbolically stand out as unique.  He depicted an accessible Jesus.  This was certainly in evidence during the Sermon on the Mount scene.  In no other movie, I feel, does Jesus come down off the lofty pedestal and talk directly to you.  The Sermon on the Mount scene starts with the Beatitudes but becomes a conversation between the audience and Jesus, at times, questioning Him directly on who He really is.  Here, Jesus becomes human, and it is thanks to Jeffrey Hunter's heartfelt performance.  To contrast the human element is some of the most incredibly moving miracles ever filmed, establishing his Divinity.  The healing of the crippled boy never fails to elicit a tear.
The other performances are just as good.  The political and action sequences around the sacred story are interesting and exciting.  The sets and the photography are appropriate for the spectacle but not terribly overdone.  And, last but not least, is Miklos Rozsa's incredible music score, one of his best.
Although lambasted when it first appeared during the media backlash against spectacles (although the audience disproved the critics by making this one of the best grossing films of the year), this film gains in reputation as the years move on.  One of my personal favorites!  We need this on DVD!",1033257600,59,2767,4.920258620689655

1238207,2,B00000JQUA,"KING OF KINGS IS FUN JUST TO LOOK AT JEFFREY HUNTER AS JESUS CHRIST!!!  Unfortunately, the critics displayed their conventional bias against goodlooking actors and blamed Hunter for KING OF KINGS being such a weak movie--it's too long and boring--and then Hunter's career went into a gradual tailspin that was accelerated by his then wife Sandy Bartlett's decision not to allow him to stay on as the Captain of the Enterprise after his appearance in the first Star Trek pilot, and then Hunter stumbled through a series of terrible movies like DIMENSION 5,
and SERGENT O'FARRELL OF THE NAVY with Bob Hope, and by 1969 Hunter was dead.
  But if you want to see Jeffrey Hunter's unusual combination of all American good looks and acting ability see him in STAR TREK's ""The Cage,"" or in KING OF KINGS.  Yes, KING OF KINGS is a slow, boring movie, but it's still a lot of fun JUST TO LOOK AT JEFFREY HUNTER AS JESUS CHRIST!!!

There is nothing wrong with representing Jesus as a beautiful man, though Hunter's piercing blue eyes and blonde hair were blasted by many critics and were a factor in keeping this film from being taken seriously. After all, a movie communicates its message visually and one look at Hunter in this role evokes perfectly the physical image of Jesus that millions of the faithful, influenced by Renaissance paintings, have formed in their minds. Though I agree that the Barrabas subplot is distracting, the film is well-paced, reverent, and moving.  It is Nick Ray's ""Rebel WITH a Cause.""",1020211200,2,681,5.126126126126126

1238210,4,B00000JQUA,"""King of Kings"", directed by Nicholas Ray (""Rebel Without a Cause""), is an underrated film that is marked by some dazzling cinematic moments (Pompey's desecration of the Temple, the death of Herod, and an extended Sermon on the Mount).  Miklos Rozsa (""Ben Hur"") is responsible for the moving score and Orson Welles provides some tasteful narration at the film's beginning.  Jeffery Hunter delivers an adequate portrayal of Jesus although the cynical critics at the time savaged his performance. Robert Ryan and Siobhan McKenna are too old to play John the Baptist and Mary respectively and Royal Dano is ridiculously miscast as Peter.  However, film buffs will delight to see a young (and thin) Rip Torn as Judas Iscariot and Harry Guardino as Barabbas.  Fans of Nicholas Ray should see this film as should students of epic cinema.  As a portrayal of Jesus' life and mission, ""King of Kings"" falls far short of ""Jesus of Nazareth"".  However, ""King of Kings"" was made for the large screen and I think that lovers of the cinema will appreciate its strengths and overlook its faults.",1009756800,12,1080,4.939226519337017
1238211,4,B00000JQUA,"Game Over is by far the most heartfelt testimony to the fact that selling drugs is not the answer.  The documentary tells the tale of three Harlem Drug-lords that have since become legends to their culture.  In the '80's these three Rich Porter, Alpo, and AZIE sold drugs and lived a life that was unmatched by any of those that were in that world at that time.  They had a parking garage filled with a fleet European automobiles- BMW's AUDI's, Porshces',Merecedes Benz,SAAB's, Honda Ninja's, the list goes on. They would drive through the streets of Harlem with thousands of dollars in the trunk handing money to those that asked. They partied hard and did all of this at the age of 16!!!!  Of course greed sets in like in any good drama the fun ends and pain begins, the kidnapping of a little boy would change all of their lives. If you know of anyone that would like to sell drugs or think that it is fun and games, you need to have them watch this video.  Reality will set in very quickly they will realize that the drug game is played for keeps.  This is the true story behind the soon to be released ""PAID IN FULL"" Roc-a-fella films.

1238212,3,B00000JQUA,"With all the memories that I have of viewing this film (on television) each Holy Week in the 1960s, it remains a popcorn and Milk Duds guilty pleasure in which I annually indulge. Most baby boomers would love to have this one on their shelves, though, be forewarned - if one has not viewed it for a time, the elements of accuracy, adherence to scriptural texts, and power are nothing like what we imagined they were as kids.
This film has been scripted, rather oddly, to focus on the story of the Roman conquest of Palestine - certainly a relevant area to the general plot, but so overly staged that it takes away from Jesus's message... though perhaps that is providential, since little of Jesus's words or mission come through anyway. There are few miracles or parables shown, no fathomable reason for Jesus's arrest, and the odd device of an omnipresent Roman soldier (who goes from leading the slaughter of infants in Bethlehem to eventually serving as the silent Jesus's defence attorney) who recounts such deeds as are reported about Jesus, but which are seldom shown.
Handsome, youthful Hunter (who makes one marvel that the racial mix of Galilee included the English and Irish) seems very remote, and, except for the Sermon on the Mount sequence, silent. One wonders if he knows what he is about. It became highly irritating that Jesus's mother Mary seems the only one, including the Son of God, who knew ""where it was at,"" and she assumes the role of prophet, knowing before Jesus does that he is about to be crucified. For unfathomable reasons, some of Jesus' most memorable words from Scripture are uttered by the character of Mary.
Unlike in, for example, the glorious Zeffirelli ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" acting is of poor quality in this film, and the supporting characters seem more like Sunday-school posters than people responding to the highly challenging message of the gospel. (Though whether Jesus has any notion of this himself is doubtful.) The scenery, battle scenes, and score are so intense as to be occasionally overwhelming, but the dialogue and characterisation are shallow.
This enduring favourite is poorly acted and scripted, theologically deficient, and far from a powerful theatrical experience. But it is enjoyable, and one hardly knows one's mind is filling in the blanks with the parts of the tale that are left out. Pass me some more popcorn!",997833600,4,2375,4.91044776119403
1238213,3,B00000JQUA,"This is one of the many movies made about the earthly ministry of Jesus. There are many good elements to this film. The Scriptural accuracy is pretty good. There were some scenes that do not portray Jesus correctly.
For example, Jesus visits Mary before going to Jerusalem here. He said he would mend the chair later and Mary said they chair will never be mended. The movie inadvertantly made Jesus a liar in that scene because he was either hiding the truth from Mary (not possible because she knew from the angel who foretold his birth that he would die for sins and because Christ himself repeatedly told those around him that he would die and rise again) or intentionally was trying to mislead her.
But these problems are forgiven given that the movie as a whole is (when it relates to Jesus) generally in harmony with Scripture. I just wish that there was a Jesus movie that portrays his betrayal by Judas according to Scriptural truth and not artistic monkeying.
A lot of time is spent on inventing a back story to Barabbas and his dealing with Judas and how he and Jesus cross paths now and then.
There are some historical inaccuracies here, too. In the movie Pilate is called the son in law to Tiberius. Not true. He was an equestrian rank who was recommended to the post by the Senator Sejanus who was later executed by Tiberius for treason and conspiracy.
The acting here is a little stilted. At times it seems they were more focused on creating an ethereal effect than on establishing human connection. It's an understandable mistake, but it detracts from the life of Jesus who was really a man (as regards to his earthly nature) who connected with people and yet was still God.
If you're debating on whether to get this movie, go ahead and get it. It's worth watching. I've watched it several times and own it. Just don't derive your theology from it.",996192000,4,1863,4.580838323353293
1238214,3,B00000JQUA,"'King of Kings' features Jeffrey Hunter's finest performance, as a young, dynamic Jesus of Nazareth, and his intrerpretation, open and earnest, is the best part of a movie both uneven and flawed.
Produced by many of the people responsible for 'Ben Hur', the film utilizes some of the same sets, actors (Frank Thring appears in major roles in both films), and composer (Miklos Rozsa, whose score for 'King of Kings' was one of his finest). The cast was fleshed out by respected actors (Robert Ryan is too old but charismatic as John the Baptist, Siobhan McKenna is a glowing Mary, Brigid Bazlen, a deliciously wicked and oversexed Salome, Harry Guardino, an 'over-the-top' Barabbas, a VERY young Rip Torn scores as Judas). While the cast didn't have the 'star power' of 'Ben Hur', or many other Christian epics, the actors, by and large, perform credibly in their roles, particularly Hurd Hatfield and Viveca Lindfors, as Pilate and his wife, Claudia, and Ron Randell as Tribune Lucius.
The film was a MUCH less expensive project than 'Ben Hur'; the budget restraints show most glaringly in recreating Jesus' ministry (most of Christ's miracles are only referred to, not shown), and extras casting (Spanish townspeople, overdubbed with some truly RIPE dialogue!).
The film works best when focusing on Jesus; unfortunately, it veers off into distracting subplots about Barabbas and the zealots, and the decadence of Herod's court. These stories consume a LOT of screen time, and damage the overall impact of the film.
Yet rising above all this is Jeffrey Hunter's interpretation of the Savior. Easily the most audience-friendly of all the actors who have assailed the role, Hunter took a lot of flack for his 'matinee idol' good looks, and piercing blue eyes, but his kindness, his sincerity, and the complete believability with which he delivers Christ's words overcome any qualms about his appearance! The Sermon on the Mount is a film high point, and magnificent; the Crucifixion and Resurrection have the kind of power that can bring a lump to your throat, even after repeated viewings!
While 'King of Kings' lacks the big names and budget of 'The Greatest Story Ever Told', or the emotional core of 'Jesus of Nazareth' or 'The Last Temptation of Christ', in Jeffrey Hunter, the film presents possibly the most compassionate of all screen Messiahs, and makes this film a MUST for the holidays, and your collection!",970876800,96,2416,5.0425
