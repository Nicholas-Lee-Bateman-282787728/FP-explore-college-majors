And seriously under rated.",1486252800,,157,5.5
8473544,5,B005HS0G5E,I am being taught by her right now and I love this collection,1428105600,,61,3.769230769230769
8473545,5,B005HS0G5E,"Amar Gamal is an excellent dance instructor. She literally teaches all the moves for a dance and then performs the dance she has been teaching. I love her gradual teaching technique, smile and style. This is not a typical bellydance instructional and I may not perform this dance for my husband, but I feel learning these dance steps can improve confidence and coordination. This dance DVD is more for someone who actually wants to perform a dance in public. Beautiful and fun.",1411776000,,477,4.829268292682927
8473546,3,B005HS0G5E,"The choreography is awesome, as is Amar! BUT, what's missing is the building block approach that was provided in her ""Mastering the Dance"" DVD ... So, here, you learn section 1, then 2, then 3, then 4 ... up to 14 sections I think! But at no point do we get to review/practice **all previous sections with each new section being learned (like we did in Mastering the Dance).** That repetition and reenforcement are key, at least for me! ... In MTD, by the time we get to the end, we really have it down, because we've had the chance to let each piece build on the other. Here, we are given each individual section on its own (a lot of them!!!) and then BAM ... the whole choreography! : / I'm writing this in hopes that with future DVDs, Amar will help us to string the beads together like she did in MTD ... It really makes a difference, esp.  w/ such Fun & Beautiful choreography! Thank you!!!",1407888000,3,895,4.295857988165681
8473547,5,B005HS0G5E,"Amar is an amazing instructor.  Her ability to impart knowledge is stellar.

She is very thorough with this choreography beginning with the warm up.  She demonstrates a few of the moves that may require refreshing.  Ample practice is allowed.  She then demonstrates each combination and allows ample practice.  Modifications are also demonstrated as well.  This is followed by a run-through of the entire choreography and then a performance in costume.  Wow she is so lovely.  This choreography is for mid intermediate and advanced intermediate dancers. Amazon has the cd with the music and the entire cd is SLAMMIN!  If you are looking for a new fun choreography that is not grueling to learn - just get this.  This choreo lends itself to improv as well.  Just get it.

I really like the choreography itself. Great for shows, restaurant, etc. Beautiful piece of music used from Samy Farag. I have her other dvd and this one is great too. Both top notch! Thanks for another wonderful dvd--looking forward to the next one!",1341446400,5,398,5.045454545454546
