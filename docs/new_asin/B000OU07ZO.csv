8186680,1,B000OU07ZO,PLEASE DO NOT ORDER THE PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!!!! The movie is only 25 min. long. Then there is about 45 min. of behind the scenes footage that shows nothing but extended scenes of clips from the movie. The movie is about a mad who kills women. Shooting them mostly There is no plot. That is it. I'M SERIOUS!!!!! When we do see him killing the women the effect are horrible. The scenes of the dead bodies. You can see the actors breathing and eyes moving. I can not believe Amazon wants to sell it for $17.00. It isn't worth $0.07. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT IS NOT REALLY A MOVIE. By the way. Whenever you see a DVD cover like the one pictured. You know it is nothing like the movie.,1286323200,5,687,4.172932330827067
