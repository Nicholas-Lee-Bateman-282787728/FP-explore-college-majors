3005349,2,B000XSKDMY,"First I want to make sure I congratulate these guys for even making a movie. I love bad movies, especially ones of the horror comedy genre. It must have been fun to actually make one. HOWEVER....This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The two or three offbeat jokes that were worthy of a chuckle, the obscure ""Sandlot"" references, and the fanny pack song on the end were the only decent parts of the entire feature. Saying that this was a low budget movie is a vast understatement. The other thing that really disappointed me was that there are some pictures on the cover which display some pretty promising zombie makeup. Don't be fooled like captain stupid here, because the effects are ridiculous looking, even for a lowbudget movie. Not even the blood looked real, which is so ridiculous because it really isn't hard to make realistic looking blood for real cheap. For whatever reason, the dvd itself seemed to be of pretty bad quality as well, as the brightness would frequently go dull on and off throughout the movie. Overall, I feel like an idiot for buying this movie, and I just pray someone else is stupid enough to buy it when I sell it online. Please save yourself the 75 odd minutes or so and crochet a sweater for your cat, or something equally exhilarating.",1203811200,3,1301,4.587982832618025
3005350,4,B000XSKDMY,"If you're a fan of horror comedies, then you'll like Die And Let Live.  Justin Channell is definitely an up and coming filmmaker, his first film, Raising The Stakes is great and this one takes it to the next level!  Mixing horror with Kevin Smith-esque dialogue, Justin manages to blend the two together beautifully.  The story of two losers, one of whom desperately wants to date a long time crush, only to have everything thrown into a cocked hat by the rising of the dead, is both gory and funny...if you didn't think that was possible, then you have to check this out!

While it's a low budget movie, and not perfect, when you consider the budget, you'll be amazed at the quality of the feature.  Justin, Josh Lively and Zane Crosby may be the next generation of Smith, Jay and Silent Bob for the horror genre!",1199232000,5,814,4.510204081632653

8229360,5,B000XSKDMY,"I've been a fan of this indie comedy since it first came out on DVD. The Amazon Prime streaming version is the best it's ever looked! It's kind of like if a teenage Kevin Smith made a zombie movie with his buddies in high school, but it's got a much looser comedy tone. It's really funny and gory! Highly recommended!",1521158400,,317,4.3
8229361,3,B000XSKDMY,"If you can get past the amateur acting and bad special effects this is a pretty cute movie, even funny. You can make a drinking game out of every time you see and evil dead shirt. Also Rappy McRapperson is on the soundtrack!",1518134400,,224,4.232558139534884

8229363,1,B000XSKDMY,"The writing wasn't the worst I've seen here but it was just awful. A couple of the many kids had the beginning of some talent for acting in the future maybe but the rest were just horrible. Then they added stupid gross things like spitting in a man's coffee, slow mo vomiting all I guess they thought was funny. Add that to bad production, direction and cinematography and you got one crappie piece of junk.",1511827200,,407,4.44
8229364,4,B000XSKDMY,"I own this movie as a DVD, but was thrilled to see it make an appearance on Amazon streaming! Comical and endearing, this zombie romp is good for an evening of laughs. Even more impressive, Die and Let Live was created by a talented group of high school students. Not high school student can say that they've created and started in a full length film before ever graduating! Good job, guys.",1505952000,,390,4.507042253521127
8229365,3,B000XSKDMY,"For a bunch of kids with minimal technical skill capacity/or money - the script and story was funny, witty and in the same vein as Shaun of the Dead. Very well done practical effects. I was a little saddened by the ending, but otherwise, totally worth watching.",1503014400,,261,4.574468085106383
8229366,1,B000XSKDMY,"In Fairmont, WV, Frumcorp Pharmaceuticals Medical Testing Facility has let out virus infected people. The virus kills and reanimates people (zombies). However the story really centers on a couple of guys sporting stupid dialogue the whole film thinking themselves witty. The zombies are low budget with what appears to be bright red paint. They didn't even walk convincingly. It appears the film was going for camp value and thought boring inane dialogue with some old punkish sounding music would create a cult following. Two minutes of a guy putting on PF Flyers and similar filler didn't make it for me.

Good Luck.

8229367,2,B000XSKDMY,"Die and Let Live (2006)
 It is amazing how much fun people can have making a Zombie movie with almost no money at all.  Die and Let Live has very low production values-that means crappy sound, bad make up, episodes of dark film and so on.  It does have a whole bunch of kids (most of the characters are supposed to be high school kids) having a ball making a movie.  Their exuberance shows and makes this entertaining.
 The story actually depressed me.  Just when we think the blundering teens seem to get their social lives sorted out in the midst of a Zombie outbreak, (SPOILER ALERT) everybody dies and the credits come up.  But up until that moment, they had me.
 The acting I would rate at the level of a junior college drama department.  Better than a lot of Zombie flicks but mostly because the actors really throw themselves into the effort.  The writing however lacks originality and the directing seems to be mere camera work.  That is, point the camera and let the actors do what they will.  They either improved chunks of the screen dialog or they shot only a single take of some scenes.  The gushing blood looks and acts like something light and bright, something along the lines of Cool-Aid.  The film will not scare anyone.
 The close knit cast and crew in several cases are the same people.  Actors also do the make up.  Two of the principal actors and the director did a total re-write after production started, which often either leads to or reveals trouble with a project.
 Director Justin Channell worked on a few similar productions, with some of the same people.  Cast members Josh Lively, Zane Crosby and Sarah Bauer also worked on a few similar low budget horror films.  Thus far, none have broken into the big time.  Josh Lively was only 19 when he made this as was the director Justin Channell.  Good kids with a lot of energy.
 This poorly made, slap dash two brain film has the young enthusiastic cast to give it what redemption it deserves.  It lasts a quick one hour and 15 minutes.  It has no rating but should get a P
G-13, no naked people but lots of more or less comic people eating.
 Lloyd Kaufman of Troma Pictures has a cameo which he hams up.
 They made this film in Fairmont West Virginia, a town mentioned often in the excellent Science Fiction books in the 1632 series.
 I think hip young slackers will like this more than the general public.  I found it harmless fun but not very serious.",1421366400,,2430,4.471526195899772
8229368,2,B000XSKDMY,Not a very good movie.  It was billed as similar to Shaun of the Dead.  Not even close.  Pretty dumb actually,1350604800,,109,4.095238095238095
8229369,4,B000XSKDMY,"i thought it was funny and fresh.  i actually laughed out loud a couple of times too.  the music was cute also.

ok critics who think zombie movies should be acadamy award winning affairs, set your phasars on low budget indy.  that way you won't annoy the rest of us with your criticisms, and won't scare off people looking for a good zombie movie.

i think a lot of people will really enjoy this. i know i did.  twice so far.",1310342400,4,426,4.197530864197531
