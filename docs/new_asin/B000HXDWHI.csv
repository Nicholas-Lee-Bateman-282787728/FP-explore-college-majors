2647761,3,B000HXDWHI,"Stayed up late, caught movie on late night t.v. and it was kind of bad. Like one of those B movies you watch only if you can't sleep. However, it did give me some laughs, especially the crazy woman. She was nuts! That chick needed some help. As someone had mentioned before, this movie is not one of the best- in fact it's just teetering over mediocre, but if you happen to catch it don't forget the remote.",1182038400,2,407,4.230769230769231
2647762,4,B000HXDWHI,"Just when I thought that the days of trashy Lifetime movies were behind me and all Lifetime had left were trite, inspirational stories featuring soundtracks by Martine McBride, I happened to catch this little gem that restored my faith.

In Love Thy Neighbor, Alexandra Paul plays a suburban mom whose house is broken into while her husband is away on business. Paul is home alone with her daughter and their family dog is killed during the robbery. Traumatized by PTSD, Paul's husband moves his family into a Stepford Wife-style gated community complete with 24/7 security. Things are looking up, especially when they meet their overly friendly, and somewhat nosy neighbor. The neighbor has a daughter around the same age, and the two girls will attend the same school. Paul's husband confides to the neighbor the real reason behind their move, and when he has to go away on business again, he asks her to look out for his wife. Little does he know the woman is crazy.

Oh Lifetime. This movie was classically bad. The crazy neighbor goes total Fatal Attraction, even going so far as to leave a note, ""You'll wind up like your dog. Ruff Ruff."" And wait, it gets better. Turns out she's an abusive wife who beat her ex-husband and in the tradition of the (Alleged) Texas Cheerleader Murdering Mom, frames Paul's daughter as a drug abuser when her own child doesn't make the soccer team. Needless to say, this film is trash. But the very best kind. If you liked the movie Mother, May I Sleep With Danger and any of the other Lifetime movies starring Tori Spelling circa 1995, you will have a great time with Love Thy Neighbor. But if you fancy yourself a connoisseur of ""good"" films, you can't say you weren't warned.",1177027200,10,1716,4.6976744186046515

2647790,3,B000HXDWHI,"Plagued by flashbacks of a violent home invasion, Laura Benson(Alexandra Paul) is on the brink of a nervous breakdown. Looking for a fresh start, she and her husband sell their house and relocate to a seemingly idyllic gated community, but little do the Bensons know, evil not only dwells in the neighborhood...it lives next door.

As strange and terrifying events unfold, Laura doesn't know whether her sinisterly sweet neighbor is to blame, if she's been targeted for revenge...or if she's losing her mind.",1390780800,2,508,5.120481927710843

2647795,1,B000HXDWHI,"They sent me the wrong movie and then when I contacted them, they said it was the movie I ordered.  It was the wrong movie.  It was called love they neighbor, but it was not the right actors in it and it was entirely the wrong movie.  I did not bother to send it back because I just did not want to go through all that trouble.
And you also have to wait a long time to get the movie.",1279584000,,383,3.7625

2647797,2,B000HXDWHI,"My wife caught part of this movie on TV and wanted to see the whole thing,
so I bought it.

While the acting is okay and the plot is not really silly and does not have
people doing anything really stupid, it just seems to go on auto-pilot from
the very beginning.

There was not a single surprising or interesting twist.  I have seen episodes
of Law and Order with more suspense and surprise than this movie.

As I was watching this, I thought of ""The Absolutely Positively True Story of
the Texas Cheerleader Killing Mom"" (or something like that); another
story of psycho suburban mothers that I thought was considerably more
entertaining than this.

I'm pretty sure this was a made for TV movie.  If you really want to see it,
just record it when it is on.",1193443200,4,758,4.41726618705036
8142070,4,B000HXDWHI,"Made for TV which originally aired in 2006, this one does have a script where the writers weren't paying attention to what they'd written into dialogue early in the film, it isn't even trying to have the audience guessing as to if the neighbour is someone to be concerned about or if there is an alternative answer (such as maybe the mother is in fact nuts and it's all in her head, or perhaps even the daughter blames her mother for something and is leaving notes, chopping up the cat and other things to freak her out).  No the movie Love Thy Neighbor just has the woman next door is a nutjob angle, and runs with that.  Our viewing experience therefore is a journey or her plans, what will she get up to, to get revenge on her new neighbour who dared not to do the right neighborly thing and make her daughter quit the soccer team at her new school, because her own daughter didn't make the cut (and if you don't make it in your first year, you'll never make it in however many years of high school there are left, for some reason no one asked her to elaborate on)?

Surprisingly though  this is actually quite a fun movie. Shannon Lawson, the actress who plays Jannis Rivers does a brilliant friendly at first, but once the charade is dropped, crazy woman.  A movie like this (and Lifetime has done a heap with this plot) works or doesn't work with the crazy woman character.  Lawson is believable as someone you'd find in the suburbs (although her character needed a bit of explanation on how she afforded to live in this rich gated community but that's not the actress' fault), she was a bit overweight, not a supermodel, she looked like someone who could live next door to you.

Alexandra Paul plays the mother, this is actually probably one of her better acting performances.  Sure she's been bad in a lot of stuff, but this one she manages to fight putting on the fake smile in sad, terrifying and other scenes she shouldn't before the director yelled cut.  This one, she does what she needs to for the role.  Ksenia Solo as the daughter, has some distracting makeup on the whole film, that make her eyes almost glow blue, but plays the teen daughter in this situation quite well.

The film starts off with one of those annoying scenes where the dog (Fred) is barking, and the mother keeps yelling at it to shut up.  Seriously you're dog's barking, it's doing so for a reason.  The father works for or owns some sort of rival to Boeing plane manufacturer that is about to get a huge contract, which explains how they can move to a gated community, with at least four security guards, with patrol cars on duty at all times.  The house has either bullet or bomb proof windows, I forget which but it seemed over the top when mentioned and yet those windows can be broken like a regular window towards the end of the film.  There are also cats (well at least one) there that are black when alive, but can change to orange when hacked up.  I never understood why a family that is so rich why they didn't just move to a hotel for a week (even rent the whole floor and security guards to sit outside the door) rather than the dad risk the huge contract and come home early because his wife isn't coping being alone.

End scene spoilers - The daughter's leg/knee is smashed repeatedly with a metal fire poker or something like that, presumably so she can't play soccer anymore, yet can run all the way to the front gate.  Yet once the danger is over, her leg is so bad that she gets two ambulances in a convoy with two police cars all with sirens and lights on presumably to block intersections so she can get to the hospital even quicker because her injury is so bad.  What kind of school would drop a student from a team because someone made a phone call claiming they were on drugs?  Sure don't let them play in games while waiting on results from a test maybe, if the school is worried about losing ladder points, but no one is going to act like the principal or whatever that guy was.  Then when he gets the call about the coach sleeping around, even more ridiculous when he's known him for 20 years.",1509408000,,4106,4.376315789473685
8142071,1,B000HXDWHI,"There nothing to anticipate in this movie. No twists or suspense. Waste of rental money on this. The neighbor reveals her intentions early on and that's that. Nothing else to it, and it isn't even thrilling.",1498262400,,207,4.777777777777778
