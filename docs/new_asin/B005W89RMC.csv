8487849,5,B005W89RMC,"Last year a friend and I took a heritage train ride.  We had planned on doing so again this year, but it seemed to be placed on hold because of the CP strike.  I picked this up as a gift.  For anybody who likes trains, their history, the sound of them, etc, this would make a great gift.  This is a lovely stretch of railroad and to be able to do it on a vintage train is heaven.  This DVD will help a person remember the trip or plan one in the future.",1339027200,,453,3.827956989247312
