8534633,5,B00925TBKE,"Take a group of teenagers from many Arab countries and mix them in with a group of Israeli teenagers.  Form an orchestra and see what happens.  This is an amazing and terrific story about what can happen when people actually talk to each other and learn about each other.

For anyone interested in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this is a must-see film.  For anyone else, this is a heartwarming film that starts to restore a person's faith in humanity.

Great music, too!",1400025600,,474,4.802469135802469
8534634,5,B00925TBKE,"This is a very important documentary about a wonderful experiment in international relations.  The orchestra created by Daniel Barenboim and Edward Said brings together Arab and Jewish young people, who blend well in making beautiful music.  The first disc provides the background for the orchestra and clips of various concerts.  The second disc is a full-blown concert a few years later.",1375401600,5,389,5.344262295081967
