8050029,3,B0007OP1SA,"I picked this up because the only film I had seen featuring luscious Allison Hayes was Attack of the 50 ft. woman. Lust To Kill is surprisingly enjoyable. A standard low budget western with a tried and true plot that was already old hat when it was made. (two old friends who end up on different sides of the law) No big stars, but familiar faces for the time with Tough-guy Don Megowan and the capable Jim Davis of Dallas fame. Miss Hayes is easy on the eyes and exhibits a hard as a diamond female toughness much like Jane Russell. Well worth watching. The video transfer is fine and sound quality excellent.",1219536000,11,610,4.407079646017699
