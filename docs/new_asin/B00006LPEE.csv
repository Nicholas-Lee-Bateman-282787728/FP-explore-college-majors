7972165,4,B00006LPEE,"This is a very enjoyable production, providing the feel of a performance in an intimate theatre, in a period style, accompanied by an orchestra on period instruments. The stars of the performance are Mikael Samuelson, who makes a lively and engaging Figaro, the mezzo-soprano Sylvia Lindenstrand whose performance as the Countess is wonderfully moving and beautifully sung, Georgina Resick as Susanna, who also sings beautifully, and Ann Christine Biel as a suitably boyish Cherubino. Per Arne Wahlgren is less impressive as the Count, especially given his rather nasal upper register. The production is very well acted, and I found the sets attractive. The recording and video quality are adequate, but the story is very easy to follow with the help of the subtitles (in English). If you like your Mozart performed by a large modern orchestra, and sung like Wagner, then this version is not for you. But if you appreciate a performance closer to those of Mozart's time this is a good bet, and fantastic value at $3.75 from Amazon.",1424304000,,1031,5.035087719298246
7972166,4,B00006LPEE,"This Swedish 1980's performance of one of the world's favorite operas illustrates that a traditional production, well-sung, capably acted, and staged with some sense of what the composer and librettist had in mind, never fails to be a pleasure, no matter how often you have seen the opera before.
Granted, the Drottningholm presentation is not as slick as you will see at the Met and other major houses, nor does it have big-name stars, but it is quite enjoyable to watch. The singing is excellent and the acting convincing. It is refreshing to see a Cherubino who really looks and acts like an oversexed teen-ager, sometimes annoyingly so (just as teen-agers can be in real life).
Best of all, this production doesn't get in the way of the music. The characters act as one might expect in a farcical situation, leaving the social and sexual innuendos to the viewer's imagination. And the pacing is good; the performance never drags, as operas heavy on recitative, like this one, can do.
To someone who has never seen Le Nozze di Figaro before, I would recommend this performance as a good place to start.",1365292800,,1105,4.790575916230367
7972167,4,B00006LPEE,"There are many recordings of this opera. However,  more than often, stage director makes this opera a comedy play with too much acting with not much music.  It is an opera not a comic play. Some production provide good music, but quite inadequate staging. This DVD, having recorded at one of the two Baroque theaters still in existence (the other is the Castle Theatre in Chesky Krumlov, Czech republic), holds a good balance between tasteful music and good staging. This very good balance makes this DVD quite unique among many. I should also point out that the Count, Countess, Figaro are all at the age of in the 20's, and Cherubino is around 15, Barbarina is around 13.  There is no writing about it on the score, except for the fact that the singer's age of Barbarina was 12 for the premiere production with Mozart, but if you study the score deeply, this is the age setting most consistent with what is going on stage.  The director of this production has succeeded to conform to this view.  If you compare with other productions, you can see the superiority of this production over others. This should be one in your collection if you like this opera very much. TKO",1339891200,,1172,4.615384615384615
7972168,4,B00006LPEE,"Another reviewer has commented in a very negative way about this performance but I beg to disagree.  Figaro is an opera that I know very well being able to sing through the whole work practically from memory.  I cannot find any place in the performance that the ""orchestra breaks down completely"" as noted in another review.  The performance is only a few notches below the most charming Figaro available which is the wonderful Glydebourne performance with Cotrubas, Von Stade, te Kanawa and Luxon.  In a few cases the Drottinghom is superior to the Glyndbourne:  Biel is more boyish looking than Von Stade and is more subtle.  Lindeband is more convincing than Te Kanawa both in appearance, acting and in singing.  Of course,  Te Kanawa sounds wonderful but she takes a while to warm up and frequently flattens on high notes.  The video quality of the Drottingholm shows its age but it is a small price to pay for a lovely, unpretentious performance.  After seeing the garbage that many modern directors devise for their stagings (with their infernal ""sub-texts"" and trashy sets along with resale shop costumes)it is always refreshing to get back to the innocent charm of these Swedish performances.  You can't go wrong with this DVD.",1202774400,8,1235,4.917874396135265
7972169,1,B00006LPEE,"This is the only one of the Ostman/Drotningholm Mozart DVD's I have been disappointed with.

The problem is not in the singing, which is up to Drotningholm standards (that is, no stars, but fine ensemble and good, usually youthful singers), nor is it the somewhat fuzzy picture.  The problem lies in the production, which does not fully utilize the theatre's baroque stage and scenery, but even more so in the Count, who fails either to enlist sympathy, or to impress with his authority; I simply cannot believe in an 18th century aristocrat who appears in his shirtsleeves at almost all times, and with his hair undressed.  Not least when all the other characters are well ""in period.""  He simply grates every time he appears, and looks as if Christopher Lambert had strayed in from ""Graystoke.""  What were they thinking?

For a very good ""Figaro,"" well-rehearsed, well sung and well staged, go to the Glyndebourne performance under Haitink - it's superb.",1170374400,,956,4.94375
7972170,1,B00006LPEE,"This version of Mozart's Le nozze di figaro was a spirited try but not meet up to my exact standards. The bad things were: the count was the most god-awful excuse for a count I have ever seen. Ryan Seacrest could be a better count than him! Another problem was the mediocre and less than pleasing orchestra. If you want to see an example of this listen to them bumle there way through the countesses ""Dove sono."" Also the minor characters needed some fine-tuning. Don Basilio was very displeasing in ""In quegli anni."" I won't buy a Figaro unless it has this aria in it! For goodness sakes this aria is not that tolling vocally! Also they made Don Curzio a little more comfortable. Mozart wanted him to be a stuttering little worm! But amoung the bad are also the good. Cherubino was probably the best I have seen (besides Fredricka Von Stade.) Doctor Bartolo and Marcellina were perfectly cast. But Marcellina didn't hold her own in her duet with Susanna but showed a brilliantly stunning ""Il capro e la capretta."" Speaking of Susanna she was another very uplifting person in this pretty bad performance as was Figaro. The Countess was stunning and gave ""Dove sono"" a new sort of pathetic-ness that I had never seen before (plus she is the reason I gave this DVD 4 stars.) But she still didn't beat Kiri te Kanawa in my book. Overall lousy but the little things are what makes this DVD special.",1146614400,6,1394,4.557768924302789
7972171,5,B00006LPEE,"Of the seven opera DVD's I own, this one is my favorite.  It's a gem, as one of the early operas shown on TV (1981).  This is a highly entertaining performance of Figaro.  Right from the opening scene, soprano Georgina Resick is able to portray to perfection the innocent, enthusiastic bride-to-be, Susanna, with an extraordinary vocal sweetness.  The tone of her ""Guarda un po'..."" at the beginning of act 1 is memorable.  I listened one more time to some of the famous 1955 Erich Kleiber recording for comparison.  While the superiority of the

Vienna Philharmonic was apparent in orchestration, Resick's tone compared quite favorably to Hilde Gueden's Susanna, whose voice seemed lighter, with little humor, and not as playful.  Resick's voice is resonant, yet tender and bubbling.  I don't think it's fair to compare the marvelous Cesare Siepi to another bass, but Mikael Samuelson is quite competent as

Figaro.  He portrays a humorous, not-too-bright Figaro with just the right amount of jealousy and concern.  He must deal with the arrogant Count Almaviva, performed sternly by Per-Arne Wahlgren.  Cherubino, the adolescent page, is performed admirably by Ann Christine Biel.  In fact, she plays the boy so well that it's easy to forget this is a woman performing.

Sylvia Lindenstrand brings a degree of tragedy in her portrayl  of Contessa Almaviva, and shines with her ""Porgi amor..."" aria.  Lindenstrand appropriately appears both vulnerable and dignified at the same time.  Technically, regarding the picture, I wondered a bit about the fuzziness on occasion, but realized that the camera was focused on the performer intended by the cameraman, and that performer was very sharply in focus. Perhaps the camera lens was opened wider than is typical is more current operas on DVD, due to lighting that wasn't as bright.  At the beginning, I felt as though the camera were hand held, but this quickly improved and was fine afterwards.

Although I noticed in another review that the level of sound was inadequate, I found it to be ample, and I enjoy the sound fairly loud in listening to an opera.

Since The Marriage of Figaro is above all an amazing collection of duets, trios, and quartets, it is important that the performers interact well.  I felt that the interactions were superb, especially in ones duets performed by Figaro and Susanna.

For the price of any opera, I think it would be difficult to find another one as enjoyable.  At the price of this one, it's a steal!",1124755200,9,2487,4.966101694915254
7972172,2,B00006LPEE,"I very much enjoyed these same forces in the recently-released DVD of Die Zauberflote, and so was quite excited to see this production.  Unfortunately, this is a major disappointment.
First the positive: The production itelf is actually quite wonderful - theatrical and intimate, with charming sets and fantastic acting.  The singers (several of the same ones as in the excellent Zauberflote) for the most part, possess light, attractive voices, and throw some much-welcomed gusto into their roles.  So I give it two stars for the acting and stage directions alone.
What takes this peformance out of the running, however, is the orchestral playing, and the conducting of Arnold Ostmann.  Ostmann flies through the score at breakneck speeds.  I have nothing against fast tempos in principal - when done successfully, the ""light and fast"" approach can be quite exciting in Mozart, as Gardiner and others have shown.  However, Ostmann is fast in the extreme, and the orchestra (on 18th century ""period"" instruments) simply is not up to the task.  Ensemble is scrappy throughout, and at several points breaks down altogether.  The basic sound of the string section is scrawny, undernourished and out of tune.  Balances between strings and winds are all over the place resulting in some important musical lines being inaudible.  Often, the orchestra falls grossly out of synch with the singers.  In some choice spots, they manage to fall out of synch with the the singers at the same time as they experience a major breakdown in ensemble, resulting in moments of total confusion and cacophony.  Such moments actually might have been funny, had I not just paid $$ for this.  As things were, I was not amused.
Technically, the DVD itself is also a mess.  As in the production of Zauberflote, the picture is grainy and fuzzy with insufficient contrast between light and dark and streaking problems.  I can live with that, but the sound presents a major problem as the recording level is extremely low, more so than on Zauberflote.  Even when routed through my hi-fi system into two large, full range speakers, I had to turn the volume nob up way past normal, and boost the bass and treble to get anything like a resonable fullness of sound.  Even then, I was never able to obtain a satisfying level of sonic impact.
I noticed that this production was recorded in 1981 - towards the beginning of the ""historically informed performance"" age.  I believe that this has a lot to do with the dismal state of the orchestral playing.  These same forces recorded Zauberflote 8 years later, in 1989, and the orchestral playing, while not world class, is much more secure than here, and the production is a delight.
In a way, it is a shame, because as I mentioned above, the stage direction and acting is top-notch.  If this production had possessed anything close to competant musical execution, it would easily be one of the better Figaros on video.  As it is, viewers looking for a good Figaro on DVD would do better with the Lyon Opera production on Kultur, which boasts excellent picture and sound quality, a young, attractive cast with strong singing and acting skills, well-conceived sets and stage-direction, and an alert , full sounding accompaniment from the Lyon Opera Orchestra.
Take a pass on this one...",1038960000,48,3298,4.9276672694394215
