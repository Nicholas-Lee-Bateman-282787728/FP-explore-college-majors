202951,1,1930004540,"I had recently ordered the Money Masters DVD and very much enjoyed it.  So as I was searching Amazon, I came upon the ""Rothschilds's Choice"" DVD.  I sat through the first 20 minutes of this DVD and realized it was nothing but a religious nut job ranting on about the Elders of Zion.  Quote after quote of the Old and New Testaments trying to show that Obama is the Pharaoh and even the anit-christ.  If I was wanting to list to this kind of crap, I would have turning the television over to the 700 club, listen to the old dude talk about the rapture or stuck in a video on Adolf Hitler.  Where I was at fault was that I did not do my research on just who Texe Marrs was and what his views were. I have no problem with whatever anybody's views are but I thought this video would go into more detail about the conspiracy of the Rothschilds. But all it is a just a lot of preaching and  why all the Jews are out to get us.  I love conspiracy theories because it can and make us all think about how the world works, but I get enough of what this DVD had to offer from going to church every Sunday.",1321660800,10,1094,4.037037037037037
202952,5,1930004540,"People should watch this video so they can understand just how badly that these Rothschild are manipulating their country, between them and this fellow Zbigniew Brzezinski who is a man more dangerous to mankind than any other living person today a CFR-member, Arch-Trilateral Commissionist, Bilderberger. He has been the evil spirit behind 5 US presidents, including Obama - and he is obsessed with but one thought: The US is to dominate a communist one world state.",1311379200,9,466,5.144736842105263
202953,1,1930004540,"I was expecting some data and some serious thoughts. But all I found is and complete idiot saying totally random things, with an irritating self-made profecy tone. His racism and stupid ideas will lead even stupider people to believe in him, which is unbelievable.

Obama is a communist? Being a homossexual makes you the devil? Texe Marrs you are probably the stupidest person I have ever seen. Go waste your time on something else!",1301529600,10,433,4.851351351351352
202954,1,1930004540,"If you are a thinking human who searches out real information and doesn't take all the information thrust at you for face value... leave this DVD alone. It's poorly put together and makes connections where there really aren't any. Doesn't direct you to any information that you can look at for yourself and verify his findings.

The bottom line is. Pictures can be photoshopped so photos with officials who are doing things can and do get faked. So his pictures can only be taken with a grain of salt.

Texe Marr is a Religious Zealot and I don't support any people who are god nut jobs. Not scientologists, not christians NO ONE. He'd of made a much better case for me if he would have left out his constant ""Satan hides everywhere"" and ""We as christian""

It's just typical in this country. No the black man couldn't possibly have been raised well, gone to school, set up his life to be a qualified politician on his OWN, no a sinister power hungry organization did it.

I'm disgusted with this documentary on SO many levels",1298505600,20,1025,4.554347826086956
202955,5,1930004540,"I agree that the detractors of this amazing video either have not seen it, don't have an open mind or are deliberate plants from the other side.  They say there are no facts?  The video is saturated with facts--facts galore!  I also like the subtle way Texe brings out the hidden occult symbolism in the imagery he chooses.  And, folks, don't be put off by accusations that it is Anti-Semitic.  The targets Texe is after are the ""Synagogue of Satan,"" the Illuminati Khazar Jews who are the originators, movers and shakers behind the New World Order that we unfortunates will have to live in and that our children will inherit as slaves.  As for the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, get a copy and read it through.  I think you will agree that the world we live in is mirrored in this infamous blueprint regardless of who authored it.  The perpetrators laid their plans right on the table for all to see.

America, substitute an hour of this informative bonanza for the usual hour of sit-com/sports on the boob tube and wake up!  Then get active and do something about it.  The country you save may well be your own!",1296345600,43,1123,4.50990099009901
202956,1,1930004540,"I give this one star because I can't choose any lower.  I was expecting a documentary with facts but what I got was accusations and photo-shopped pictures.  A complete waste of time and money.  The man that created this has a racist, Anti-semantic problem.  He raves on and on in an irritating voice without saying anything of any value.  At the end, you know that he hates Obama, black people and Jews.",1289865600,16,403,4.541666666666667
202957,5,1930004540,Many different sources are investigating the u.s. government. 25 years ago i would not thought it possible that our government was so corrupt. boy was i wrong.

202958,1,1930004540,"This report presents Jewish people as criminals just for the fact of being Jews  through demagogy; it's arguments are poor and lacks of reliable information, blames a whole nation (Jewish nation) for the crimes committed by a small group, the Rothschild.",1280275200,19,254,5.195121951219512
202959,5,1930004540,"Well worth watching !!!!  Do not let the 1 star reviewers sway you from this video as they are probably Zionist supporters. Tex made this video for the typical Six pack jack, which is probably why some people think it is shallow. It shows many important links that help you fill in the puzzle and would be an excellent video to give out to any sheeple that appear to be waking up. Shows how the media, in a very short time ""Psyoped"" the public by turning Barry into a Rock Start type CULT ICON that the sheeple are willing to die for. Clearly shows the stranglehold that Israel has on Washington. Again, very well done and definitely worth the investment.",1273881600,14,655,4.458333333333333
202960,1,1930004540,"I am embarrassed to have purchased this masterpiece of misinformation, whose zealous reliance on such antiquated propaganda as the Protocols of Zion adds nothing of substance to his preachy Christian ""Satan is in the Shadows"" and every Jew is his errand boy diatribe. Perhaps a minor point, but his grossly errant and nearly illiterate use of the English language is a joke, which is the only comic relief to be found in this sorry waste of time. If you like delusional preaching and high opera stupidity or you simply hate the Jewish race but want a rationale to match your bigotry, this is the dvd for you.",1272240000,27,608,4.691588785046729
202961,5,1930004540,"I myself, have seen this DVD a couple of times. And I must say: Texe Marrs has done a great job! On this DVD, Texe has everything explained in detail! I can't understand why some people call courageous researchers as Texe Marrs ""conspiracy-nuts"" The only thing we hear from them is ""It is not true"" and that's all we need to believe, that Texe is a ""antisemite."" When we however will be willing, to follow in his footsteps, (by reading his news articles, watching his videos, reading his books, material from others wich he is editing too), we will discover that he is right time and again. Because he is telling us about wht will happen, befre it will happen! And he has proven himself again and again as a truthteller. So, also his newest video is true to the last point! Higly recommended!!",1271462400,13,793,4.513888888888889
202962,2,1930004540,"Okay, I love ALL the Alex Jones films, but the people that made this seem anti-semitic. LET ME BE CLEAR it is not anti-semitic to point out that the Rothschild's have incredible control of world affairs and if they didn't want Obama as president he wouldn't be. HOWEVER in this film they seem to use the fact that people are jewish as empirical evidence that they are evil. I would watch this on YouTube and not buy it since there is useful information in here but I wouldn't give them my money. ALSO THEY QUOTE FROM THE PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION WHICH IS MIDDLE AGES PROPAGANDA!!!",1270166400,16,587,4.444444444444445

202964,5,1930004540,In the first half hour of the film you feel every thing is skocking but minute after minute you start to see things clearly.....and even when you try to tie things you normally hear in your life you see that its all true....but the film lacks the solution and thats what i was aiting for in the film.....thats why when i didn't find it in the end of the film i was disappointed....but also the film still deserve Five Satrs.,1262995200,11,424,4.3125
202965,1,1930004540,"I was looking up for materials on the Rothschild family and I came across this video. I decided to watch it even though it looked like a paranoid conspiracy piece, because people gave it 4/5 stars and I like to keep an open mind.

However I am quite disappointed after watching this.

Marrs tends to link totally irrelevant points. As one example, Marrs states that Rothschild have sinister intentins in Chicago because 1. They have some businesses in Chicago and 2. Chicago has a postcode of 60606 3. Chicago is home of badass gangsters, dodgy stock brokers and Satanic rituals 4. There were newspaper articles from the Prohibition Era which advised that Jewish Gangsters were as bad, or badder, than Al Capone's boys.

The whole video continues with ridiculous proofs like this - Barrack Obama looks like Tutankhamun; Barrack Obama used the term ""remake the world"" which is apparently what many jewish revolutionaries have said; A photo that shows Brian Williams from ABC slightly bowing his head which apparently means that he considers Barrack Obama as royalty.

You may ask how Marrs can present such statements as truths. Well he uses some clever film making and scripting. He will make the Rothschilds seem omnipresent by saying that the have businesses in France, Great Britain, United States, and Asia, without ever mentioning how big or small these businesses are (while saying this he has a picture of Evelyn Rothschild in the background holding gold bars to make these businesses seem big and wealthy).

A common thing that conspiracists will say is ""How can you let the world governments and corporations fool you."" Well if there are people that are fooled by this video, I have little doubt that governments and corporations could do a much better job.",1262563200,37,1766,4.952702702702703
202966,5,1930004540,"If everyone in the world was suddenly willing to donate a few hours of their busily scheduled sitcom-watching time, to watching documentaries like this and Alex Jones' Endgame DVD instead, the problems of the world would decrease by 95% within one year's time (my own estimation).  If people would rather believe in some manufactured fantasy of how the world works then, the outcome of events will be so horrendous I don't actually have any words to describe it.  Much has been written on that at length already anyways.  The ""powers that be"" think that you are no better than cattle, which is why they have no pangs of conscience in allowing hundreds of millions of people to starve to death.  The same people who brought the world Chairman Mao and Josef Stalin are still in control behind the scenes today.  This documentary blows the lid off of the politically-empowered mafioso characters who the world has entrusted to handle today's economic and world events.  Incredible in it's credibility, it isn't enough that one person sees this expose, it should be recommended to and seen by all.",1258502400,60,1093,4.881081081081081
202967,5,1930004540,"May I, as a foreigner and friend of the United States, suggest that the FBI look into that DVD:
a/ Does it constitute the usual communist propaganda of presenting rich people and bankers as enemies of the people?
b/ Large orders from some European, Eastern and Arab contries would obviously serve as anti-American propaganda.
I forgot: is the FBI still a communist organization bent on destroying the rights of the States and the citizens?",1253232000,18,439,4.945945945945946
202968,1,1930004540,"This type of hateful, conspiracy theory, anti-semitic garbage is just the kind of mental junk food that the Obama hating / Glenn Beck loving ""Birther"" crowds feed on. I love the praises of ""facts"" people claim on their reviews. I'm sure that if you asked any one of those ""positive"" reviewers where they get their ""news"" and information, each and everyone would answer ""FOX"". That's really all that needs to be said...

As far as Texe Marrs goes, or more as far as his (and this junk's) followers go, I wonder if they also believe (as does Marrs):

(1997) ""Our children are being stealthily indoctrinated into the new faith... The Mattel Toy Co. has introduced its new 'Goddess of the Sun' Barbie doll. Is this the Whore of Babylon spirit, alive and with us today?"";

Or if (August 1997) ""The International Version of the Bible is a feminist book for the New Age"";

Or my personal favorite: (Feb 2008) ""America is a psycopathic nation"" from his show titled ""The Rise of the Illuminati Psychopaths and The Savage Horror of America's Coming Gloom"".

The bottom line is that anything produced by the likes of Marrs, Fred Phelps, Thomas Robb, etc., belongs in the trash heap for which it was made.",1252368000,26,1193,4.688995215311005
202969,5,1930004540,"First off you can't have a closed predetermined mindset before viewing this well put together documentary. Since our history books aren't reliable, its times to let loose them preconcieved ideas.
Growing up in a public school, being taught that if you desire to be president someday it could happen. Watching this vidoe, yeah right!, The elite chooses who they want in office.
This video is thoroughly researched and Texe presents articles from newspaper clips to show you first hand what is being written about Obama, through out the states and in other countries.
He shows you covers of big named magazines like Newsweek, Time Magazine, Ebony, Vibe.... So why are they putting Obama on the front of the magazines and comparing him to former presidents like Lincoln, and FDR?
theres pics on this video where they try to make Obama out to be like Jesus Christ.
there is is alot of emphasis put on Ernesto Guevara, known to us as Che, why was his picture being posted right next to Obama's pic during his campaign. That's right there is a sublingual message. Its so much to take in at once you have to watch it over and over to digest what your seeing. You will see how the masons, communist, socialist, Jews, The Mob are all apart of this evil plan to change and remake the world. Don't they realise there secret agenda is fullfilling Bible prohecy?
Don't let one poor review stop you from viewing this vidoe.
this documentary is not against the Jews, it paints a visual picture of the truth, if you can't handle the truth and love to live in a lie, believing propaganda, than this video is just going to overwhelm you... you can't say that you weren't warned. Its one of them vidoes you don't wanna leave the room to use the restroom, so... are you ready....the truth hurts!",1252195200,18,1775,4.6380952380952385
