8469000,5,B000CQQIX0,"This is a great film which presents in a nutshell paintings and architecture of the 18th century. It might be too short and easy for an art (or art history) class, but it works well in a history or literature class.",1320019200,,215,4.2682926829268295
8469001,3,B000CQQIX0,"It's a short dvd which creates ""awareness"" about Baroque, Rococo and Neo Classicsm. Baroque is only mentioned as the previous step of Rococo and Neo Classicsm is introduced as the next step. Other than that, there are some fine examples of Rococo style. At the end of the documentary, it arouses interest in you to search for more to learn more. From that perspective it is a nice study. But in order to be able to say that you learned what Rococo is all about through this dvd, well, it's too short.",1219881600,,500,4.445652173913044
