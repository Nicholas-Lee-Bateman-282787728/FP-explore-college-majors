674596,5,6303522653,"THE TOMB OF LIGEIA is the definitive of Roger Corman's eight Edgar Allan Poe film adaptations. This is the best. The first thing that impresses the viewer is the innovative cinematography by Arthur Grant. It is stark yet hauntingly beautiful. The opening scene at Ligeia's burial is an impressive piece of filmmaking. It immediately draws the viewer into this tale of obsession where images are presented in such a way leaving one uncertain as to what was actually observed. Roger Corman directs these scenes with an emotional fervor entirely different from his other Poe tales juxtaposing quick editing, insightfully ambiguous dialog and penetrating camera movements creating a truly unique experience. There is something very erotic in a more mature sense about this whole film. There is no notion of carnal lust present in any of the images yet the viewer can feel a sense of stirring of the passionate emotions between the two principal characters, Verden Fell and Lady Rowena Trevanion. Vincent Price is truly brilliant as Verden Fell, husband of the late Lady Ligeia Fell. He plays this elusive and enigmatic character with complete conviction and confidence. Elizabeth Shepherd is equally brilliant as the curious and interested Lady Rowena as she exudes an aura of repressed burning sexuality. This is all conveyed by a mere hand gesture, a look or the ever-slightest touch or just the utterance of some seemingly unimportant words. Price tends to be oblivious to these very subtle advances in an almost asexual trance of consciousness yet he still conveys a sense of yearning for a passion perhaps lost or just lying dormant. Corman's directorial abilities are so acute in this film that the viewer really has no direct insight to where he is going with this intriguing and engaging story, yet when the tale concludes it all becomes apparent and quite logical.  Equally important is Roger Corman, the producer. Robert Towne's screenplay is filled with incredibly intelligent, witty, amusing and crisp dialogue. Vincent Price and Elizabeth Shepherd did wonders with Towne's use of language making the characters' eccentricities and frailties startlingly real. Editor Alfred Cox made use of well timed and trimmed cuts to heighten and enhance certain plot elements putting the viewer off balance yet increasing the viewer's awareness of the narrative. Cinematographer Arthur Grant and art designer Colin Southcott combined to make indelible images that are so simple and economic in design yet convey a strange and beautifully haunting setting that entices the viewers' intellectual curiosity in an emotional response. Even composer Ken Jones' score is economical in its construction yet it is very effective. It just seems to flow with the images waiting for the viewer to make an intellectual connection that again elicits an emotional response. I waited patiently for a DVD widescreen version of THE TOMB OF LIGEIA and I was not disappointed. Roger Corman's audio commentary is a bit sparse but still insightful as to how he approached this film. AN EVENING OF EDGAR ALLEN POE, looking as though it was probably shot on videotape, is a tour de force for Vincent Price as he single handedly gives very dramatic and theatrical renditions of Poe's ""The Tell-Tale Heart,"" ""The Cask of Amontillado,"" ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" and ""The Sphinx."" Vincent Price is riveting and demonstrates his unique presence and prowess for presenting these versions of Poe's stories with compelling histrionics. I had never seen AN EVENING OF EDGAR ALLEN POE and was quite surprised to see just how talented Vincent Price really was.",1106697600,11,3622,5.191452991452992
674597,5,6303522653,"This review is for 'An Evening of Edgar Allan Poe.'  If you're a Price fan, it will add to your collection, but if you're a Poe fan who felt that the Corman/Price movies failed to do the master justice, this is one gem that stands out as an exception.  It's the only Poe-worthy adaptation I've seen.  What a voice, what a presence!  Price is associated with campy, tongue-in-cheek 'horror' movies that amuse more than frighten, but you can't watch this without wishing he could have done more serious work.  This isn't satirical or or self-conscious, and doesn't poke fun at Poe's morbidity at all.  It's a fantastic piece.  I haven't watched the Tomb of Ligeia yet, but the DVD is worth the price for 'An Evening of Edgar Allan Poe' alone.  The picture quality and sound are lacking--it obviously wasn't considered the main attraction, but it should have been.  I've bought every Price/Poe movie on DVD that I know of, and this one was the best, without a doubt.  It's the only one I felt strongly enough about to review.",1103328000,9,1022,4.627777777777778
674598,4,6303522653,"This movie is surprisingly enough, a rather faithful adaptation of the Edgar Allen Poe story: Ligeia.  Ligeia is one of the most haunting and shadowy stories Poe ever wrote.  I rate it as the best story he ever wrote.  His description of the Lady Ligeia still haunts me still.  She is the ideal woman, and the most frightening of engenues!

This film captures all of the ambience of the story.  A little bit of the Poe story: The Black Cat is thrown in for good measure (it adds to the plot nicely); and you basically have a man desperately trying to divorce his dead wife!  Enter the Lady Rowena, and the fun begins.  The whole endeavor reeks of Gothic decay.  There are no flimsy sets and the dialogue is sparse and mysterious until the end.  I always enjoy a movie better when it is shot in actual locations and houses.  It transports you to a place of shadowy reality from which you may or may not wish to escape.

I shant give away the ending; but needless to say, it is one of the most macabre of film history.  If you find the powers and mysteries of the mortal will intriguing, you shall be genuinely entranced and horrified by this film.  Read the story first, by Poe, then be horrified by twists and turns of the movie version.  You'll be glad you did.

674599,4,6303522653,"MGM supplies a double dose of Price and Poe with this Midnight Movies release of The Tomb of Ligeia (1965) and An Evening of Edgar Allan Poe (1970).  The Tomb of Ligeia, directed by Roger Corman, was his last of the popular Poe series of films, and Corman certainly went out in style.  Opting for shooting on location rather than use of soundstages, the production here is lavish and infinitely enjoyable.

The story centers on Verden Fell (Vincent Price), who lives in a run down abbey, with his wife, Ligeia, buried within the grounds.  But is she actually dead?  It was said her will was so strong, her desire to live so palpable, that maybe she didn't really pass.  Elizabeth Sheppard also stars as Lady Rowena Trevanion, a woman who has a chance meeting with Verden, and soon finds herself enthralled with the man, despite his peculiarities, like his aversion to sunlight, his living in an abandoned abbey, etc.  They are soon married, and then the weirdness really begins.  Strange dreams, a black cat, Verden mysteriously disappearing in the night, and a sense that Verden's deceased wife, while not around in a physical sense, is somewhere in the abbey...maybe everywhere in the abbey, as her presence seems to permeated the structure, and it doesn't seem like she's too happy about Verden getting re-married...so what's the secret behind Verden's strange behavior?  Is Ligeia really dead?  What is the menacing presence lurking within the abbey, intent on haunting Lady Rowena?

As I've said, this is a really wonderful production full of rich, beautiful location shots.  The decrepit abbey is provides a wonderful backdrop to this truly creepy story, and the minimal number of characters really helps to keep things tight and focused.  Price, one of my favorite actors, does a wonderful job, and seeing him apply his craft is always a treat.  Elizabeth Sheppard certainly manages to hold her own, sharing much screen time with price.  What I found really interesting was the lack of physical horror within the film, and how the film avoided the luridness of some of the other Corman/Poe productions, seeming to stay more along the lines of the source material.  Credit must be given to the write of the screenplay, Robert Towne, who later wrote the Nicholson/Polanski classic Chinatown (1974).  A real nice adaptation with loads of atmosphere and a nice way for Corman to finish the Poe series with this eighth and final adaptation.

The second feature on this disc, An Evening with Edgar Allan Poe, isn't a theatrically released feature, but a made for TV movie starring Vincent Price.  It's comprised of four vignettes, including the more popular Poe stories, The Tell Tale Heart, The Sphinx, The Cask of Amontillado, and The Pit and the Pendulum..Price is the only one throughout the entire feature, sometimes acting in a manner of relating a tale within character in the story, sometimes acting out the different characters within the stories.  It's a very personal affair, and all tales follow the original stories very closely, something that wasn't necessarily true of the theatrical Poe features produced by Roger Corman starring Price.  As far as I can tell, Corman had nothing to do with this production, but it was produced by American International, the same company that produced the Corman/Poe films.  This feature runs 53 minutes.  Since it was shot for television on video tape, the quality isn't all that great, but, if you are a fan of Price and/or Poe's works, then this will be a real treat for you.  Price really sinks his teeth into the roles, relating each tale with flourish they so richly deserve.

The print provided for The Tomb of Ligeia looks really beautiful, presented in wide screen.  The special features include two, separate audio commentary tracks, one with Roger Corman, and another with star Elizabeth Sheppard.  There is also a theatrical trailer for the film.  An Evening with Edgar Allan Poe is in full screen format since it was a feature made for television, and does have subtitles, which came in useful as the audio, while decent, was a bit weak at points.

674600,3,6303522653,"You can't go too wrong with a pair of Vincent Price horror movies, especially based on Poe stories; as this double feature demonstrates, however, you may not do completely well either.  This pair of movies is not bad, but is not overly impressive.
The Tomb of Ligeia is a rather standard entry in the Corman/Price/Poe series.  Vincent Price is a man whose first wife has died but apparently come back in the form of a cat.  Although rather morbid and occasionally violent, he somehow wins the heart of the local beauty and marries her; the spirit of his first wife, however still haunts his home and occasionally controls Price's mind. For a series often filled with good movies (such as the Raven or the Masque of the Red Death), this one only stands out in its averageness.
An Evening of Edgar Allan Poe, however, is more interesting.  A showcase for Vincent Price, it has him telling four different Poe stories.  Many viewers may be put off by the lack of action; this film is little more than Price on a stage by himself delivering monologues.  Price, however, does a great job with his narrations.  Reading Poe can often be difficult due to his dated language and style, but Price brings these stories to life.
As stated before, this is not a bad pair of movies, but it is just a high three-star feature at best.  You will not be wasting your time watching them, but you will not be rushing to rewatch them either.",1068163200,17,1419,4.559055118110236
674601,5,6303522653,"""The Tomb Of Ligeia"" was the last time Roger Corman would direct Vincent Price in a movie adaptation of an Edgar Allan Poe story.  Vincent stars as Verden Fell, whose willful wife has just died.  Her will to live was so strong that not even death could put an end to her.  This moody movie is beautifully filmed, with the details of the decaying abbey and cemetery, as well as the vivid colors of the interior shots, benefiting greatly from the new DVD transfer.  However, I found this costume horror film to be heavy on atmosphere and light on scares.  The action didn't really pick up until the fiery climax.

""An Evening Of Edgar Allan Poe,"" originally shot on videotape for television in 1970, is officially released at last.  Given the source material, the images are clear, and the sound is good.  Vincent Price delivers a powerful, one man performance of four Poe stories.

""The Tell Tale Heart"" starts the evening off on a strong note.  Vincent gets more and more animated in relating how he planned to murder the old man he was looking after, how he dismembered the body in a tub to catch all the blood, and how he carefully hid the body parts.  Of course, when the police come to investigate the complaint of hearing a scream in the night, Vincent loses his composure and reveals everything,  because he hears the incessant beating of the old man's heart!

""The Sphinx"" is a comical piece, in which Vincent sees a gigantic monster in his telescope, which turns out to be a moth caught in a spider's web.

""The Cask Of Amontillado"" finds Vincent at his jovial best.  He happily relates how he led his drunken friend through the dank catacombs to show him his latest wine purchase.  Instead of sharing some drinks, he quickly chains his friend to the wall and then slowly seals him up alive, brick by brick.

""The Pit And The Pendulum"" features an amazing performance by Vincent Price.  In the span of twenty minutes, Vincent relates the terrible tortures inflicted on him by the Spanish Inquisition with chilling detail and fiery conviction.  For all fans of Vincent Price, this DVD is an essential purchase.",1063411200,51,2117,4.657681940700809
674602,4,6303522653,"""The Tomb of Ligeia"" is, I'm sure, the draw of the two. Before I bought this DVD, I didn't know what was to be expected from something called ""An Evening with Edgar Allen Poe"", and Amazon offered no explanation. Well, get ready. This is a filming of Vincent Price's one-man show that went around the country, featuring his rendition of ""The Tell-Tale Heart"", ""The Sphinx"", ""The Cask of Amontillado"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum"". It's intense and quite wonderful. As hammy as he's been in other films, there is a riveting conviction to present Poe as it should be. It's definitely worth a look. ""The Tomb of Ligeia"" is Corman's last Poe film, which he considers among his best.  I found it to have a bit more center and plot than most of his other Poe adaptations. There's a fine, unsettling performance from Elizabeth Shepperd, playing dual roles. I'm a fan of early Poe films by Corman; here, he's developed style and intelligence. I thought the earlier mindless ones (Matheson script) were more fun. But this is definitely worth a look. Screenplay by Robert Towne (""Chinatown""). I was most impressed with Price's one-man show. It's pretty much of a one mood (crazy) presentation, but I can't really say that it's hammy. Imagine ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" done alone on stage... (with no props or set). It's quite frightening, and, here, Price was much in tune with his material. A real tour de force.  It's a performance that is up there with Rathbone or Olivier.",1062115200,12,1467,4.7265625
674603,4,6303522653,"On the one side we have the superb ""Tomb of Ligeia"" and on the flip side there's the lackluster ""Evening of Edgar Allan Poe"". ""Ligeia"" is one of my favorite Poe/Price/Corman films and is presented letterbox in a beautiful print. Lushly filmed on location with marvelous photography, it tells of a reclusive baron (Price) with a weird eye problem that makes him ultrasensitive to light. He has recently buried his beautiful wife Ligeia who had a strange hold over him. He meets the Lady Rowena who is bizarrely smitten with him and they marry. Rowena soon discovers things are not what she hoped when the spirit of Ligeia makes herself very well known---particularly in the form of the late Ligeia's black cat. Elizabeth Shepherd is wonderful (and provides audio commentary on this disc) as both Rowena and Ligeia. She's probably the best female costar Price ever had (next to Hazel Court). Price is at his moody best as the baron so Shepherd had her hands full. The sets of ""Ligeia"" are something to behold. Expansive and foreboding, they seem to swallow the cast allowing the feeling of gloom and emptiness full range. But what is with the sound on these recent releases? I kept having to turn it up and down to hear a lot of the dialogue. And the dialogue (by Robert Towne) in ""Ligeia"" is important. Not only is it literate but it's written to provide a lot of clues as to what's going on.  Nevertheless, ""Ligeia"" alone is worth the price of the DVD. Now, ""Evening With EAP"" is another matter. Done by AIP vets Samuel Z.Arkoff and James H.Nicholson, it's a one-man-show of Price doing four Poe tales first person. It's poorly reproduced in picture quality and tedious to sit through. But, if you're a diehard Price fan, it is a rare chance to see Price going solo in tour-de-force style. Plus it's only around 56 minutes in length and there's nothing wrong with the sound. Price is crystal clear and loud. He's probably the best interpreter of Poe there ever was. But my bet rests with ""Ligeia"". My Poe cycle on DVD is now complete.",1061942400,6,2034,4.65

For the last of his cycle of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations, Roger Corman asked screenwriter Robert Towne [Chinatown] to turn Poes story Ligeia into another vehicle for Vincent Price, who once again plays a man so haunted by his past that he is unable to function in the present.

In this case the past comes in the form of his now-deceased first wife Ligeia, who casts a long shadow over an ill-advised second marriage to a woman who resembles her [Elizabeth Shepherd], particularly when he becomes convinced that Ligeias spirit is returning to him in the form of a black cat. But is this actually a delusion on his part?

Although the doom-laden narrative and Vincent Prices tormented performance had become well established ingredients in the Roger Corman Edgar Allan Poe cycle, the film looks strikingly different from the earlier films, with much of it taking place in broad daylight, and shot in actual English locations (notably Stonehenge and Norfolks Castle Acre Priory) instead of Hollywood sets.

FILM FACT: Roger Corman was initially reluctant to use Vincent Price in the lead role, being worried he was too old for a character that was 25 to 30 years old; his preference was for Richard Chamberlain. Roger Corman ended up giving Vincent Price a wig and using more make up on him than usual to make him look younger but that Price's casting still ""did change the orientation of the film quite a bit. Filming started at Shepperton Studios on 29 June 1964. Roger Corman gave Martin Scorsese permission to use a clip from the film in Mean Streets.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE TOMB OF LIGEIA [1964] was the seventh and last film in the AIP ""Poe cycle"" of collaborations between low-budget producer/director Roger Corman and actor Vincent Price in creating loose adaptations of the writings of Edgar Allan Poe. While earlier entries in the series, which started with The Fall of the House of Usher [1960], were marked by the creative use of sound stages and matte paintings to create an atmosphere of gloom, and by an equally creative license in expanding the source material to feature length, The Tomb of Ligeia is notable for staying quite close to the Edgar Allan Poe's original story ""Ligeia,"" and for shooting several of its major sequences outside in bright sunlight.

The plot sadly shuffles around the basic elements of the rest of the Roger Corman Edgar Allan Poe films, like a love from beyond the tomb, possession, the doom and gloom obsessed husband, the pretty innocent bride driven around the bend by such obsessions, the gloomy Gothic mansion, sinister black cats, a neurotic and cowering Vincent Price suffering from hyper-acuteness of the senses, and everything going up in flames at the end. However, the lack of much connecting logic makes it an uninspired rehash. But the the English location shooting makes some sort of welcome relief from the usual fog-laden sets of the earlier Roger Corman films, which I really miss from this particular film. But this film THE TOMB OF LIGEIA definitely has the look and closer link to a Hammer Horror Film that inspired Roger Cormans Poe series in the first place. However, Roger Corman and his cast hardly seem to be doing much more than playing a game of hide-and-seek with the Gothic ruins. Vincent Prices usual clipped, overwrought enunciated delivery is just very stilted and just okay and not his usual panache style of acting we have come to expect from a Roger Corman film. Which is very present with the scene where Elizabeth Shepherd is hypnotized and possessed by Ligeia is given a good jolt of horror. Yet sadly, the film is only so good, as the dialogue is very flowery, the pace slow, nothing much ever happens and when it does it is never properly explained, but maybe Roger Corman was very restricted in having to make the film in England and not in his usual studio settings with his previous films.

The script for THE TOMB OF LIGEIA and was by Robert Towne, who had earlier written the ultra-low-budget film Last Woman on Earth [1960] for Roger Corman. The script for The Tomb of Ligeia was subtle and cerebral compared to earlier examples in the series such as those by Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont. The Tomb of Ligeia had a sense of realism finally intruded upon the Edgar Allan Poe series and not only because the tale was staged in natural surroundings, but because the script constantly questions the Gothic precepts which previous films had taken for granted. What Robert Towne attempted was a genuine ghost story...a real tale of the supernatural like in the 1940s.""

THE TOMB OF LIGEIA was the 2nd film in the Edgar Allan Poe series to be filmed in England. The previous entry was The Masque of the Red Death [1964] that had been shot with very inventive use of colour, by cinematographer Nicolas Roeg. Alas, the inventiveness and innovation of THE TOMB OF LIGEIA runs out of steam before the final reel is finished, and Roger Corman again to save money falls back on his usual stock film ending, especially relying on the over the top fiery climax (which recycles footage from his previous Edgar Allan Poe films). Vincent Price later said, ""I have been singed many times and while making THE TOMB OF LIGEIA in which the whole set was sprayed with liquid rubber, someone lit a cigarette and the whole thing went up in flames. But as with The Haunted Palace film, Vincent was quoted as saying that Roger Corman is a fire fiend as well as a firebug.""

As a post script on the history of this film, in the book by Vincent Price entitled The Art of Fear Denis Meikle Vincent Price is quoted and who also took some of the credit for the unusual look of the gothic horror picture THE TOMB OF LIGEIA which was very vaguely based on an idea that Roger Corman and Vincent price had once. Vincent Price said, I had always wanted to do a picture in a ruin, but actually using the ruin as an actual place, with real furniture in it and the ruin around it, which I thought would be very effective. This is sort of what happened when he adapted to THE TOMB OF LIGEIA which I think was the best one we ever did."" The actual shooting location was at the ruins of Swaffham Priory in the county of Norfolk in East Anglia. Sadly the film was panned by the critics, by saying, More Poe, but no get up and go about sums up THE TOMB OF LIGEIA is a tedious and talky addition to American International's series of Gothic Horror based tales by the 19th century US author. Most fans of Roger Corman's Edgar Allan Poe franchise have tended to disagree with this assessment over the years, feeling that the macabre romance and implied perversities of THE TOMB OF LIGEIA provide a fitting end to the capper of this Gothic Horror franchise series.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Once again Arrow Video brings us this Blu-ray release in the usual quality presentation of a 1080p encoded ColorScope image and also an equally impressive 2.35:1 aspect ratio presentation. The high-definition transfer has been taken from a pre-existing master which is very much present in this Blu-ray release, as I feel it does not quite have the atmospheric light and shade of the previous Roger Corman gothic horror films, meaning the image is very bland and flat looking. Also there are the occasional traces of light fading and occasionally tiny specks and light scratches that are quite easy to spot. There are no traces of compromising grain or sharpening adjustments and overall the image stability was also good. To sum it all up, it is obvious that The Tomb of Ligeia could of looked so much better, and I felt it was only a slightly pleasing presentation that I feel Arrow Video could of worked on the negative so much more to give it a much better presentation with a much more depth of colour like their previous Blu-ray release of THE HAUNTED PALACE, as I felt it looked the colours were too pastel in appearance, but despite this slightly negative review, it was still an enjoyment watching this film.

Generally speaking, the audio presentation has a lot of depth and clarity and is very good. The dialogue is very stable and easy to listen to. There was occasionally some extremely mild background hiss that made its presence felt, but overall it does not affect clarity and sharpness when the actors speak or the very atmospheric music in the background.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Director and Producer Roger Corman: Here we get the dark silky voice of Roger Corman, who tells us this was his 2nd Poe Picture to be made in the United Kingdom and a total departure from all his previous Poe Pictures. Roger also talks about Edgar Allan Poe himself and how was like Freud and getting all psychological with his writings, and the unconscious mind, and that is why Poe film Roger wanted to go in a different direction, that is why he decided to do a lot of the shooting with outdoor location schedules and especially in Norfolk that Roger really liked. One interesting fact Roger tells us is that they used a lot of make-up on Vincent price, to make him look much younger for a more romantic role in the film, because when they made the film sometime in 1964, Vincent Price was really starting to look his age, and also added some diffusion on the lenses were used, like they normally use for female actresses in a film. Once again Vincent Price gets a lot of praise from Roger and feels that Vincent never got the praise he deserved throughout his acting career. Roger also praised the background artist drawings at the start of the film and also praises the actor Derek Francis, who he felt was totally ideal for the part of the local squire. Roger then turns his attention about the scenes where Vincent eyes are sensitive to light, which this affliction happens in several of the other Poe films, and Roger cannot explain how this situation came about. Roger then makes comments about the interior shots in the Shepperton Studios and really enjoyed working there, and he was in equal praise with all the English actors that he really enjoyed working with. Roger also makes a comment about Vincent Price had a lot of dignity and felt he would give him full carte blanch in exploiting his character in the film, to make the viewer feel Vincent has a lot of power, especially with shooting from the ground upwards. Roger also really praises the English crew most highly, compared to a Hollywood crew and feels the English crew was far more superior to the Hollywood crew and were technically excellent, and in some cases were much more better and more accommodating with a slower pace of filming, and Roger found having the tea breaks at 11:00am and 4:00pm and felt it was a very civilised attitude, but the downside is not a lot of work is done, compared the Hollywood work is done at a much faster pace. Roger also talks about the part in the film where Vincent and Elizabeth go on their Honeymoon and talks about Paul Mayersberg being like a Second Unit in wanting to insert extra footage that Roger wanted to be inserted in the film and to break up the film to give it more scope and also mentions that the two actors in those particular scenes are friends of Paul Mayersberg. When we get to the dream sequence in the film, Roger praises the English Editor Alfred Cox, who he felt that Roger and Alfred worked really well together. Roger informs us that the British Fire Department spoke to him and said that they understand that your work is having lots of fires in your films and they would not allow him to a have a really full scale fire, because of previously the burning of the ceilings in other previous Roger films and you see the flames only go so high in this film. And so ends another interesting audio commentary with Roger Corman, who is always a joy to listen to. But the last word goes to Edgar Allan Poe, where at the end of the film, the Poe words appear in saying, The boundaries which divide life from death are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends and where the other begins? which sort of up sums up everything relating to this Edgar Allan Poe film.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by star Elizabeth Shepherd: As you know Elizabeth was the main character actress in the film THE TOMB OF LIGEIA and here we get to hear Elizabeth talk about the first scene in the film where the casket is being laid in front of the headstone, and basically informs us where the location shots were filmed in Norfolk. But before I go any further I want to comment on this particular audio commentary and I am very annoyed as Elizabeth sounds like she was recorded in a bathroom, as it has very bad acoustics and the recording level is so low I had to crank up the volume really high and then it was still a problem and was a very unprofessional presentation, also you hear a male voice with Elizabeth who is a friend of Roger Corman, but you do not find out who he is. When you see Elizabeth as Ligeia in the coffin, it was the last day of shooting and it was very sunny and it hurt Elizabeths eyes, but managed to last long enough to finish the filming. Also Elizabeth talks about the black cat on the tomb stone, but when Vincent appears for the first time to Elizabeth, the black cat ran away and they could never find it and sadly the owner of the cat never found it. Elizabeth talks about the scene in the kitchen with Vincent and especially where the cat attacks her and scratches her face, well this was done by a false paw that had hollow claws, so that fake blood could end up on Elizabeths face. Anyway there is of course more audio commentary from Elizabeth, especially explaining different scenes in the film, but the sound was so difficult to listen to because of the really bad recording, to the point that sometimes you could not hear what was being said, that I finally gave up and it has been the most ghastly terrible audio commentary I have ever experienced and to my mind would have been best to never ever been included as an extra and should have been left on the cutting room floor, as it was a complete waste of time and I cannot understand why Arrow Video thought it should be included on this otherwise excellent Blu-ray release.

Special Feature: All-new interview with crew member/co-writer/production assistant Paul Maysberg [2014] [1080p] [1.85:1] [24:25] Paul Maysberg was the future screenwriter for Nicolas Roeg and Nagisa Oshima and originally started out as Roger Cormans assistant, and this meant doing a bit of everything, including uncredited script rewrites. The interview as recorded on the 30th September, 2014. Paul Maysberg starts by saying that Roger Corman is a better than average Director and is also a brilliant producer in making films, but then Paul contradicts himself by saying that Roger Corman is not really a producer, but more like an investor, mainly in the people involved with each film Roger shoots, especially anyone who has a spark of talent, as well as being a genius, but especially, Roger Corman is enthusiastic about people who loves the movies. Paul Maysberg also informs us that Roger Corman only likes to make any films he shoots as cheap as possible, and because when Roger Corman was in full flow in making his films in Hollywood, he found it was getting more expensive to shoot any films and decided to change direction and shoot some of his new films in England, and Roger Corman made a deal with Nat Cohen to make the film The Masque of the Red Death and because it was a massive success decided to make the film THE TOMB OF LIGEIA again in England. Paul Maysberg also informs us that he did a lot of behind-the-scenes work for Joseph Losey in promoting his films and also doing the screenwriting, and in the process and was asked to do an interview with Roger Corman, and because Paul Maysberg had seen most of Roger Corman films, which he informed Roger Corman, and was very surprised and impressed with this information, decided there and then to hire Paul Maysberg to get involved in the film THE TOMB OF LIGEIA and asked Paul to look at the script to see if there were any improvements that Roger Corman, especially as the film was being shot in England and wanted to give to give the film an English slant, especially with all the English spellings, but unfortunately because it was originally a Robert Towne script, he had quite a dominance over Roger Corman and because Paul felt he could not make any drastic changes in how he felt it could be improved 100%, and that is why sadly THE TOMB OF LIGEIA was not a great success, and unfortunately Roger Corman could not see the wood for the trees so to speak, especially with the anomalies with the script, pertaining into making it more like a Gothic Horror film like the previous Roger Corman films, but at least it did have the burning of the building at the end of the film. As always Roger Corman hated spending excess money and was reluctant to employ a Casting Director, so he asked Paul Maysberg if he knew any English actors that could appear in the film and that are how you have all the English actors appearing in the film. With the part in the film where Vincent Price gest married to the leading actress, Roger Corman wanted some extra footage shot relating to the honeymoon, and as Roger Corman had to go to America Roger gave Paul a free hand to go out and do some extra filming, so with a camera, two extra Panavision lenses and two enthusiastic film friends to help him, they first made a trip to Stonehenge and then onto Cornwall and we find out that the two people who were the honeymoon couple being filmed, were friends of Paul and when Roger Corman finally saw the results of the filming he was totally ecstatic with the results. Paul Maysberg moves on and talks about the business of using the black cat in the film and he knew of this lady who lived in a nearby village who had a black cat, but when they tried to film it, it kept running away because it was really scared, so they hired a cat wrangler who could try and train this particular cat, but the cat was having none of it, so they gave up on that cat, so all in all they just had to use some of the shots they did have of the cat, especially where sometimes it did not run away. By the way, near the end of the film where Vincent Price is strangling the cat, they were actually Roger Cormans hands, but on the first take Roger had his modern watch on, so the final shoot is the one they used in the film. Near the end of Paul Maysbergs interview he commented on the film, saying he felt it was a very strange film, especially the outside shoot with the manicured lawns and the Ligeia headstone, so making the film have some strange anomalies, especially the storyline, and also tended to look like a modern film, mixed in with other periods, especially the interior studio shots. Paul also again talks about Roger Corman and his rule on making a film and a book he uses as his Bible so to speak, and is by Joseph Campbell and is entitled The Hero With A Thousand Faces. When the film THE TOMB OF LIGEIA was finally finished, Roger was keen to make another Poe film that was based on the poem Annabel Lee and asked Paul to draft out a screenplay, but for some unknown reason Roger Corman decided to stop making anymore Poe films, as he felt they were going out of fashion, but despite this let down, Paul still stayed a good long term friend to Roger Corman. And at that point we come to the end of this delightful and very informative and insightful interview with Paul Maysberg is well worth a view.

Special Feature: All-new interview with first assistant director David Tringham [2014] [1080p] [1.85:1] [8:12] The first assistant director talks about the culture shock of working with a fast-moving American director and fast moving cats, and his concern about the studio catching fire. The interview as recorded on the 26th September, 2014. David Tringham had never heard anything about the film THE TOMB OF LIGEIA, but suddenly out of the blue David got this particular phone call to come and work on the film, as usually people are asked to come in for an interview first to see if they are suitable. With this particular shoot it was only a 10 days schedule at the most, as Roger Corman is renowned for working very fast and he literally runs from one set to another and David had a right job keeping up with him, which David really liked this set up, as previous Directors he has worked for were too methodical and very restrictive. David also really enjoyed working on this film, and especially working the fantastic and professional Vincent Price, because David found him very funny and you could talk to him about anything, whereas David said Roger Corman was very remote person and tended to keep his distance. David also talks about the business of filming, especially with the erratic black cat and again even with the cat wrangler trying to train the cat, but again it was a hopeless situation and again they were only able to get certain shots of the black cat they could use in the film. David also goes into great deal about the film set, especially when Roger wanted to set it ablaze and trying to set up the use of a crane and how difficult it was to again get it all set up, especially with Roger Corman asking very erratically to have the camera in different positions, but because of difficult logistics, Roger Corman scrapped the idea in the end. Despite this being a very short interview, it was still really fascinating to hear Davids anecdotes on working on the Roger Corman film and well worth a view.

Special Feature: All-new interview with clapper loader Bob Jordan [2014] [1080p] [1.85:1] [7:38] Bob Jordan the clapper loader talks about the camera crew, shooting in widescreen on a low budget, working with Vincent price and revisiting the main location a few years later. The interview as recorded on the 7th October, 2014. Bob Jordan starts off his interview by saying that at the start of his career he met Arthur Grant B.S.C. who was a British cinematographer who worked at the Bray Studios, that was located in Windsor, West Berkshire, which came about because Bob Jordan because he was working at the time at Danzeiger Studios, which was a former engine testing factory in Elstree, working on his first film and eventually became a very good friend to Arthur Grant that lasted 15 years, and Bob also became Arthurs regular focus puller and that is how eventually he ended up working on the film THE TOMB OF LIGEIA, which was also the first time he had worked with a Panavision lens, which also had another lens that went on top of that one to give you a squeezed image, that is of course un-squeezed when the film is projected., but you have to be very careful when framing the image, as otherwise you can get a lot of technical framing issues, because the camera was not a reflex camera, unlike the modern film cameras today. When Bob made the Roger Corman film he was 22 years of age and was enamoured by the star presence of all the actors, especially Vincent Price, because he said that Vincent Price was a very impressive and charming delightful person. Bob Jordan recalls a very funny situation where all the crew were made to go on a coach trip for a location shoot in Norfolk, because the production Company would not pay out for individual travelling expenses, but Bob felt this was going to be a big problem, as the place was very isolated to be able to ship back the days shooting to have the film processed, luckily Bobs wife followed them with their car to the location shoot, so when the film had to be sent for processing, the wife was able to get to the Swaffham Railway Station and send the film back by Red Star service on the train to the film processing laboratory. When it came to the setting the film set ablaze, Bob said that when they used the Evo Stik solution on all the surfaces, the fire was very controllable, but you got very serious side effects with lots of toxic fumes and with the last shoot it got very dangerous and they all only got out in time, as the fire got out of control, and was a very scary situation. Bob recalls that three or four years later he made a return trip with his wife for a holiday to Norfolk and the location of the shoot and walked into the local pub that everyone on the film visited, and he overheard the locals talking about the Roger Corman film and was very impressed about their experiences on being involved with the film. Again this was a really fascinating, but sadly short interview, but despite this, it was a joy to hear Bob Jordans experiences, especially working on the Roger Corman film.

Special Feature: All-new interview with composer Kenneth V. Jones [2014] [1080p] [1.85:1] [6:16] The composer of the music talks about the technical challenges, including writing a theme and variations for the cat, and scoring the fiery climax. The interview as recorded on the 11th March, 2014. Here once again is another fascinating interview by a very brilliant composer of the film THE TOMB OF LIGEIA and Kenneth recounts with interest, that he was given full responsibility on composing the music score for the film and Kenneth was actually approved by Roger Corman, who also had great faith in Kenneth in producing a music score that went so well with the film, that Roger complimented on what a good job he did for enhancing the films performance. Kenneth tells us he wanted Roger Corman there in the editing suite to advise when the music should appear in the film, but instead he had help from the film editor, as Roger Corman had to go back to America, but even with the help of the film editor, it was a really difficult process. But Kenneth was really more interested when he should enhance the film and wanted to concentrate on the music score where there were scenes with the black cat, as he felt the black cat was a very important part of the film. When Roger Corman finally saw the finished film, he congratulated Kenneth on doing a grand job and really enhancing his film, especially Kenneth had to do five long gruelling recording sessions, but despite this, Roger Corman was more than pleased with the results, and of course Kenneth V. Jones felt very honoured to have worked on a Roger Corman film and especially the music score used for the final part of the film where the whole of the film set was set ablaze. Here again, this was a very short interview, but despite this, it was still a very interesting one.

Theatrical Trailer [1965] [1080i] [2.35:1] [2:28] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film of THE TOMB OF LIGEIA and it is a superb presentation, with totally excellent dramatic audio presentation, so making you want to see the film even more. But sadly it is let down with a very poor image quality.

PLUS: Beautiful Printed Reversible Blu-ray Cover sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by the Twins of Evil [Created by Luke Insect and Paul].

BONUS: Beautiful Printed Collectors 24 page booklet containing new writing by Julian Upton entitled THE LAST OF THE CORMAN-POES: EXCAVATING THE TOMB OF LIGEIA. Plus CREW; CAST; ABOUT THE TRANSFER; PRODUCTION CREDITS and SPECIAL THANKS. You also get some brilliant illustrated artistic illustrations with original black-and-white rare production stills.

Finally, I am a massive fan of the Roger Corman films, but I felt THE TOMB OF LIGEIA has been a slight let down, and I also felt Vincent Price was not as menacing enough as in the previous Roger Corman films and Roger Corman just didn't give me that scary factor which I love about his previous Gothic Horror films. But still despite this, Roger Corman did his best and I am still glad I have added this Arrow Video Blu-ray to me ever increasing Vincent Price Film Collection.

674902,5,6303522653,"Throughout the 1960's, Roger Corman was churning out adaptations of some of Edgar Allan Poe's stories much to the delight of many Poe aficionados. Ultimately, he would team up with Vincent Price for the 7th time and Robert Towne (Chinatown and Mission: Impossible) for the last in the series, which was just as thrilling as the first. There's Vincent Price as a character of mystery, an air of dreadful things permeating the atmosphere (The Sleeping Beauty reference being one of them.), an alluring and relatable supporting character caught up in the midst of the whole situation and an epic climax that involves the use of dramatics and/or fire that would end with the death of a character or two.

674978,5,6303522653,I have always enjoyed the suspense stories of Poe and movies of Hitchcock.  This was extraordinarily good rendering of the Poe stories.  Today's (so called) suspense movies are nothing but blood and guts splattered all over the screen leaving absolutely NOTHING to the imagination of the viewer.  These movies allow one to exercise his/her mind and imagination,1413849600,,360,5.280701754385965
674979,5,6303522653,"One of the later--and more overlooked--entries in the Price-Corman-Poe franchise, this is one of the best films in the series, in my opinion.  This is due in no small part to Price's unusually restrained and subtle performance, and an excellent double-role performance by Elizabeth Shepherd.  The film also contains mostly exterior shooting on an authentic Medieval Abbey and the ruins that surround it, which is unique from the other Corman-Poe pictures, shot almost entirely indoors.  The result is a wonderful film, with that unmistakable Poe air that Price and Corman so vividly captured for Gothic fans.

675115,4,6303522653,"This MGM Midnight Movies dual package of The Tomb of Ligeia (1965) and An Evening of Edgar Allan Poe (1970) should satisfy Vincent Price fans. The Tomb of Ligeia is the last film directed by Roger Corman and starring Vincent price in a film adaptation of an Edgar Allen Poe tale. The movie tells the tale Verden Fell (Vincent Price) who pines away for his late-wife, Ligeia who is buried on the family estate grounds.  Verden fell is fighting the notion that his wife refused to accept death he falls for the Lady Rowena Trevanion.  Rowena becomes smitten and the two eventually marry.  This is to the chagrin of the spirit of Ligeia.  Verden is losing control of his senses as it soon becomes evident that Ligeia is not resting at peace.  This is not one of Corman's best films but Vincent price carries it off.

The second feature on this disc, An Evening with Edgar Allan Poe is a made-for-TV stage production.  The brilliant Vincent Price is a one-man tour-de-force as he recites and performs four popular more Poe stories, The Tell Tale Heart, The Sphinx, The Cask of Amontillado, and The Pit and the Pendulum.  There are times that Price does ham it up but then again this is a Roger Corman production of Poe literature starring Price.  Vincent Price is mesmerizing and quite good in this production.

You will enjoy these two features.",1381449600,6,1342,4.648305084745763
675206,5,6303522653,"If you are looking for films that venerate Edgar Allan Poe then look no further.  These two offerings come from schlockmeisters Roger Corman and Samuel Z. Arkoff but they are anything but schlock.  There seems to be an affinity for the material and they are presented lovingly to their target audience.
""The Tomb of Ligeia"" is helmed by Corman and it is believed to be his favorite of the Poe adaptations he personally directed.  Working from a script adapted by Robert Towne (""Chinatown"") Corman achieves the requisite mood in this haunting tale of obsession and possible possession.  Vincent Price gives an appropriately understated turn as the mournful Verdon, widower of the late Ligeia.  The real surprise is Elizabeth Shepherd who does double duty as Rowena, the new wife of the haunted Verdon, as well as Ligeia.  Shepherd runs the gamut of emotions of a woman who loves a husband who may be in love with his tragic past.  This is a high water mark for all involved and not to be missed.  Five stars.
The setting for ""An Evening of Edgar Allan Poe"" is a television sound stage with the requisite props and stage dressings and narrator Vincent Price appropriately made up for each of the four tales he tells.  Personally, I would have ditched the props and makeup and ditto for the split screen effects that were all the rage in the late Sixties and let Price do his readings before a live audience.  Regardless, this is an excellent document of an actor whose performance has you at the edge of your seat.  High points are Price's rendering of ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum"".  Price pulls out all stops in these tales of murder, insanity, and torture and I could feel the hair on my arms standing up.  Literally.  I remember seeing this on late night television when I was a teenager and I never forgot it but now it has more of a visceral impact.  Five stars.",1377907200,5,1889,4.63063063063063

675210,5,6303522653,"Roger Corman returns to direct the last in his series of Edgar Allen Poe adaptations, a Gothic ghost story entitled THE TOMB OF LIGEIA from 1964. Vincent Price stars as the reclusive Verden Fell, a man haunted by the memory of his recently deceased wife. Verden is stricken by the beautiful Lady Rowena one day when he encounters her by Ligeia's grave. The two quickly marry, but Ligeia's restless spirit refuses to allow them a moment's happiness. THE TOMB OF LIGEIA possesses all of the Gothic grandeur and elegant set design of Corman's earlier productions, along with the same wonderful sense of style and creepy atmosphere as well. Vincent Price is quite enjoyable as Verden Fell, reigning in a solid performance that capitalizes on the actor's own peculiar eccentricities once again. Elizabeth Shepherd is the most impressive of all in her dual roles as both Rowena and her ethereal counterpart, Ligeia. The actress truly transforms into each persona and loses herself in the characters. The growing mystery and suspense reach their peak as a suspicious Rowena discovers her husband's hidden chamber within their estate. Has Ligeia's spirit truly been restored, or is something far more sinister at foot? Fans of traditional Gothic Horror can do no better than THE TOMB OF LIGEIA.

The great Vincent Price performs four of Edgar Allan Poe's classic tales of terror in a one-man show entitled AN EVENING OF EDGAR ALLAN POE, produced by Samuel Z. Arkoff and directed by Kenneth Johnson for American International Pictures. Unlike the Roger Corman productions from decades past, AN EVENING OF EDGAR ALLAN POE is a theatrical and literal interpretation of Poe's original prose in which Price rehearses the lines of one or more characters with great care and enthusiasm. Here, Price is given the opportunity to fully explore his range as an actor in taking on the various roles with a separate and unique cadence for each character. He transforms from the raving lunatic in The Tell-Tale Heart to a far more sinister and sophisticated villain in The Cask of Amontillado. The sets are surprisingly well-dressed for such a small stage performance, which lends a wonderful mood and atmosphere to the entire production. Overall, this is a great little collection for Poe and Price fans, alike.

675212,5,6303522653,"Tomb of Ligeia is one of the most lavish of Roger Corman's Poe movies and utilizes all of the sets from the previous Poe films.

Vincent Price's look in this film inspired the look David McCallum sported 25 years later in The Haunting of Morella.

Ligeia and Morella share many story points, all involving goth girls that don't quite stay dead and seem to possess some beautiful young thing (either a new girlfriend or a daughter) that has the attention of our sickly protagonist, the dead goth chick's husband.

Ligeia is also the name of the lost beloved in the poem The Raven.

The protagonist in both films suffers from a nervous system shutdown that makes noises too loud, sensation too sharp and food too harsh.

I like both movies.

An Evening of Edgar Allan Poe is less of a movie than a one-man stage show starring Vincent Price reading aloud a few tales of Poe. Truly stunning and a surprise treat on this Midnight Movies set.

MGM had a good thing going here with the inexpensive double feature (though today's out-of-print prices are embarrassing), but gave it up for the much pricer Archives Collection. Sigh.",1352505600,,1122,4.6938775510204085

Apart from the qualities of the film, there is a great director's commentary by Corman, as well as another commentary by the lead actress - Great stuff!!

675329,4,6303522653,"""The Tomb of Ligeia"" is a slow-paced yet highly atmospheric adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's ""Ligeia"", starring Vincent Price as the tormented and not quite stable Verden Fell, who is haunted by the spirit of his deceased first wife, and whose second marriage to beautiful Rowena (Elizabeth Shepherd) is similarly haunted by this spirit. Fell is reminded again and again (and hence his torment and inability to move on) by his late wife's disembodied voice that she will live on even after death and she will always remain his wife. The story is highly steeped in atmosphere, and is both a horror story and psychological drama as viewers witness Fell's descent into madness.

What makes this worthwhile in the classic canon of horror movies is the excellent acting by both Price and Shepherd (in a dual role) as well as the outdoor shots (which was uncommon for horror movies back then) amidst the scenic English countryside. It is slow going though and no real scares- more of sinister atmosphere that is effectively conveyed.

""An Evening of Edgar Allan Poe"" is a retelling of four Poe stories starring Vincent Price - in ""The Tell Tale Heart"", ""The Sphinx"", ""The Cask of Amontillado"", and ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" (my favorite of the four).

675331,5,6303522653,"The other reviews of THE TOMB OF LIGEIA on this site are so sensitively and intelligently written that I hesitate to add anything. I agree totally with their views and wish to weigh in on this project only to add support to what was probably an unappreciated film when it was released, at least in the midwest where it often appeared on a double-bill or on a triple-bill at the drive-in. This film belonged in an art house, and perhaps some art houses still in existence today could present a retrospective for urbane audiences. It clearly is not a film for groping teenagers and cigarettes-in-the-sleeve Joe Six-Pack types at the drive-in.

Most of the Poe films were given superb treatment by the economical but skillful Roger Corman. What an interesting director. I do wish a good DVD could be made available of one of his 1950s small-budget but well-written projects THE UNDEAD. One of the few films to put the witches' sabbath on the screen, complete with soul trading with Satan, it is cleverly combined with a time travel theme. In fact, I once showed this film to science-fiction students when teaching a film course emphasizing time travel. Another of his films that I showed to the same students was FRANKENSTEIN UNBOUND. It is an interesting take on the time-travel theme -- bringing in the well-known Frankenstein story as seen by a time traveler from the future.  Not only do we see Mary Shelley in this film, author of the original story, but we likewise are treated to brief characterizations of the famous poets Lord Byron and Percy Shelley (before he marries Miss Godwin and makes her Mrs. Shelley).

Like MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH, and perhaps THE HAUNTED PALACE, which is more H. P. Lovecraft than Poe, THE TOMB OF LIGEIA is a work of subtle poetry on the screen. The scene where Vincent Price's Shakespearean voice provides a narrative from Poe, as written by the talented Robert Towne, is mesmerizing. I am referring, of course, to the scene where Rowena follows the evil black cat up the stairs of the bell tower in the abbey (for the rest of the film, the cat chases or torments her). Price as the admittedly morose but intellectual resident of the half-ruined abbey reminds us of our own memories and the ultimate futility of trying to recall, intact, the actual content of those dream-like memories. The voice-over is compelling and one of the greatest examples of poetry transferred to the motion picture screen.

This DVD belongs in the collection not only of lovers of the Poe series, as I am, but to serious fans of intelligent films in general. . . as well as to teachers and professors who teach Poe literature. What is amazing to me, if I may be allowed a segue, is that female Chinese students and teachers alike find Poe to be so frightening and disturbing. One teacher in Anshan, China, even asked me why Poe wrote such material. When I showed THE TOMB OF LIGEIA to Chinese students recently, I was almost astounded to discover, after the showing in a small auditorium when I was discussing what we had just seen, that one young lady was trembling visibly. I tried to be sympathetic while, at the same time, concealing (successfully, I hope) my amazement. If this early-sixties film is so frightening, what would be their reaction to a film like THE EVIL DEAD, a film lacking any subtlety whatsoever?

Elizabeth Shepherd is, at least for me, an unknown actress, yet she accomplishes what is almost the impossible -- keeping pace with the actor of all actors, the theatrical and stalwart (if occasionally hammy) Vincent Price. She is eerie as the ghostly raven-haired Ligeia, who speaks very little on-screen; as the red-haired aristocratic Rowena, she is sophisticated and three-dimensional --  not a shrinking violet heroine but a woman with her own complications and superior intelligence. She even tells her solicitor companion, who obviously carries a torch for her, that one may not like someone to whom one is drawn. She admits that one must not necessarily be in love with the man one marries. Why she is attracted to the Byronic and clearly learned Verden Fell is not really clear to us, any more than it is clear to her. She becomes caught up in a situation that is beyond her comprehension; considering the extent of her intelligence, this seems to be quite incredible. Yet with Poe, the incredible is often made credible. She is facing supernatural elements that are not made even partially clear until the end when the servant, placed in an extremely awkward position of trying to be gracious to the new bride while remaining loyal to his master and employer, explains the power of the dead woman to still possess the living.  Maybe it is not revealing too much to state that Price does not portray, as he does in MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH and THE HAUNTED PALACE ( half of the time, anyway) a menacing figure; he is a victim, not a victimizer. He is the tragic figure at the center of a gothic mystery, like the mysterious master of the estate in JANE EYRE. In fact, this Poe story, as presented by Mr. Corman, could have been penned by one of the immensely talented Bronte sisters during the height of the Romantic Age in England. Like tragic figures as written by such luminaries as Oscar Wilde, he clearly has a secret that cannot be revealed to the other characters until the end. As for the black cat, I am a lover of cats, but this has to be the most evil feline creature ever shown on the screen.

AN EVENING OF EDGAR ALLAN POE is pure theatre, with Mr. Price exhibiting his considerable talents in a one-man show. This is not a motion picture, of course, and the visual presentation is quite fuzzy; however, this is a work that should be required viewing by literature students studying Poe and other authors who gave us such classic masterpieces. That it is included on a DVD with THE TOMB OF LIGEIA is an inspired decision.  This is authentic Poe, and Price gives us a compelling presentation of written literature on the screen. Anyone doubting the genius of this actor need only watch this performance and follow the original text. It is no surprise, therefore, that Price, an art expert as well as a man of the theatre (and a witty person when guesting on talk and game shows), considered this to be his greatest performance.

Congratulations to all involved in this masterful example of the extent to which talented artists can excel.",1258588800,,6391,4.703306523681859
675332,5,6303522653,"Me being only fifteen years old, you would not expect I would be a fan of old movies. Well, I am. I'm a fan of almost everything from Lon Chaney in the Phantom of the Opera to these films: the Tomb of Ligeia and An Evening of Edgar Allan Poe.

I must voice how very well put together the Tomb of Ligeia was.
The film is about a man named Verden Fell (Vincent Price), whose wife Ligeia(Elizabeth Shepherd), passed away, but he feels her will to cling to life, even after she looses it. Some months later, he meets the Lady Rowena (Also played by Elizabeth Shepherd) after she meets with a riding accident. She breaks off her engagement with Christopher Gough (Played by John Westbrook), a prosecuting lawyer, and marries Verden. After their honeymoon around Europe, Rowena and Verden return home. Rowena feels the presence of Ligeia stalking her and seeking to destroy her, and Verden disappears at night with no explanation of where he had been... what is going on in Verden Fell's abbey. What hidden horrors await Rowena? Can she help her husband let go of the memory of his Ligeia? Or will Ligeia never set her husband free from her control?

I applaud Vincent in his performance as Verden Fell. Everyone in this movie was an English actor except for Vincent. I admire his ability to fit in with a bunch of English actors, which is something few American actors can do. I praise Elizabeth Shepherd for her ability to play both the parts of Lady Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine AND Ligeia, and her being so young (She was only twenty eight when she played this part! Holy crap!). Above all, I was extremely impressed by John Westbrook's performance as Christopher Gough. He's a freaking amazing actor! I feel I must include him for his brilliant acting, since hardly anyone has heard of him and notice his amazing ability to assume the character of the role he is playing. Plus, I love his deep, sensuous, mellifluous voice. It's sad that this was the biggest film role he was ever in. He deserved so many more roles in movies than he actually got. If you have seen Masque of the Red Death, he was the man in red, though not credited in his performance (Which I think he should have been!!!!). I fear I must stick John Westbrook at the very top of my list as one of my favorite actors of all time, Vincent Price being the second of my favorites. The rest of the actors I think were very well cast. I felt the scenery in the Tomb of Ligeia was absolutely beautiful, all filmed in southern England (I think...).

Now, An Evening of Edgar Allan Poe, I thought was very brilliantly put together. It must have taken Vincent hours to memorize those stories, but an actor of his ability I think can accomplish it. I loved the way he acted out every word he spoke, with such emotion, dread, fear, and despair, as in the case of the Pit and the Pendulum and the Tell Tale Heart.

Above all, both of these movies were amazing. I now have my favorite movie of all time decided: The Tomb of Ligeia. Yeah, that's right, I loved it that much.

Love,

675333,2,6303522653,"The Tomb of Ligeia (Roger Corman, 1964)

Roger Corman, according to IMDB's trivia section, considered this the most exciting of his series of Poe adaptations. I'd have to disagree, as I let this one sit for a couple of months before getting round to reviewing it, and I found that I'd forgotten it almost entirely, and had to go back and watch it again. It;s not bad, but it doesn't sick in the mind the way some of the other Poe adaptations from this series do.

Plot: Verden Fell (Vincent Price) was once married to a lovely woman named Ligeia (Damien: Omen II' Elizabeth Shepherd). Ligeia died, however, and after an appropriate time, Fell gets engaged to Lady Rowena Trevanion, the daughter of a local landowner. There's one minor problem: Fell is still obsessed with Ligeia, and Rowena just happens to be her spitting image. He comes to believe that the spirit of Ligeia may be possessing his new bride. Or is her spirit actually in that cat who's been hanging around?

Corman's potboiler style of direction combined with the acting talents of both Price and Shepherd make this interesting and watchable; it's not something you should avoid. But it's empty calories, and you'll be hungry again in an hour. ** ",1248739200,2,1214,4.739336492890995

675335,4,6303522653,"This DVD represents the most and least elaborate of the American International Poe series, but also two of its very best efforts.  ""The Tomb of Ligeia,"" the last of the classic series (meaning the teaming of Vincent Price with director Roger Corman) is also the most unusual.  Shot in England, it capitalizes on exterior locations rather than the series' usual claustrophobic soundstage settings.  It also features Price at his most Byronic, made up and bewigged to look as young and dashing as possible, and he responds by keeping his character's madness well controlled.  Sultry-voiced Elizabeth Shepherd plays two of Price's wives, one dead and one alive, with the latter being threatened by possession by the former.  Abetted by cinematographer Arthur Grant, a Hammer Films regular, Director Corman established a dream-like atmosphere from the first scene (which is spoiled somewhat by a redundant bona fide dream sequence).  The literate script by Robert Towne fuses in elements of other Poe stories, such as ""The Black Cat"" and even ""The Fall of the House of Usher.""  But the overall influence here seems not so much Poe as Hitchcock.  If ""The Masque of the Red Death,"" the Poe film that directly preceeded ""Ligeia,"" is something of an homage to Ingmar Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal,"" then this can be seen as Corman's take on ""Vertigo.""  Even some of the individual shots, such as the one in which the alive Shepherd visits Price unnanounced, appearing to him as a vision stepping out of the light, are reminiscent of Hitchcock's masterpiece.  Only the seemingly obligatory conflagration finale sends it straight back into typical Corman-land.

Also in this set is an hour-long television special called ""An Evening With Edgar Allan Poe,"" which for years was something of a lost production, fondly remembered by those of us who first saw it in syndication, but seeming to exist nowhere on tape or disc.  It features Vincent Price in solo recitations of four Poe tales -- ""The Sphinx,"" ""The Cask of Amantillado,"" ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum.""  ""The Sphinx"" is one of Poe's rather whimsical short-short stories, and is treated by Price with the appropriate ironic humor, and ""Amantillado"" and ""Heart"" are good treatments of the stories.  The real gem, though, is ""Pendulum.""  In narrating the terrors of solitary confinement in complete darkness (this is the original Poe story, not the completely fabricated storyline of the 1961 film), Price works himself into such a state of intense terror that the result is electrifying.  It may well be his best recorded performance, ever.",1186790400,5,2606,5.096470588235294

675337,5,6303522653,"""The Tomb of Ligeia"" was the last of Roger Corman's eight Edgar Allen Poe adaptations, and he went all out. Instead of the usual cheap studio setting (although these were used for all the interior scenes), this movie had breathtaking photography of the English countryside, as well as a creepy graveyard. I consider ""The Tomb of Ligeia"" to be one of Corman's very best, if not his finest, Poe adaptation. It has wonderful performances from the entire cast, great cinematography, and haunting music composed and conducted by Kenneth V. Jones.

Vincent Price is Verdan Fell, a depressed man who's wife Ligeia has recently died and been buried. But at the funeral he remembers her final words: ""Man need not kneel before the angels, nor lie in death forever save for the weakness of his feeble will."" She was so strongwilled, in fact, that her spirit still lives, and Verdan is still controlled by her. But when he meets beautiful Rowena (Elizabeth Shephard), his life is forever changed. She feels sorry for Verdan but also loves him and over time she teaches him how to smile and be happy again. They marry, but as soon as they arrive at his castle for the honeymoon, Rowena senses evil in the place.

Over time Verdan drifts further and further away from his new bride, as his dead wife's control over him becomes stronger and more frightening. Ligeia seems to manifest herself as a black cat which always seems to be attacking poor Rowena. Eventually, Rowena discovers a secret room in the castle and finds Ligeia's body, but she may already be too late to break her control over Verdan...

I didn't realize until the ending that Elizabeth Shephard actually had a dual role, playing both Ligeia and Rowena. Now that is talent! Once again, Vincent Price gave another outstanding performance, taking his character from depressed to happy and then to homicidal! If ever there was a Poe adaptation by Corman that would make Poe rise up from his grave an cheer, ""The Tomb of Ligeia"" is it. The dvd has a sharp and clear image quality and the sound quality is awesome. Bonus features include the original theatrical trailer and two commentaries, one by Corman and the other by Elizabeth Shephard.

On the other side of the dvd is ""An Evening of Edgar Allen Poe"", a made-for-tv movie where Vincent Price gives a one-man show, narrating and acting in four different adaptations (no other actors were involved!): ""The Tell Tale Heart"" (one of my favorites from Poe), ""The Sphinx"", ""The Cask of Amontillado"", and ""The Pit and the Pendulum"". Price was a bit stagey but you can tell he loved being the center of attention. Roger Corman had little or nothing to do with ""An Evening of Edgar Allen Poe"", and it shows. I think it'd be best enjoyed by ""hardcore"" fans of Edgar Allen Poe. No bonus features are included for ""An Evening of Edgar Allen Poe"" except for subtitles, which come in handy as the sound quality is rather poor. Overall, this dvd is highly recommended just for adding ""The Tomb of Ligeia"" to your collection.",1115337600,23,3015,4.7371428571428575
7849598,3,6303522653,".... An Evening with Edgar Allan Poe  Was a very pleasant surprise ...  originally a made for TV special, It is a one-man show with Vincent Price doing  interpretive readings of classic Poe short stories .... Even though its duration is a little less than an hour it would be a must see for any Vincent Price !!!  The Tomb of Ligeli  A slow moving but very atmospheric and well acted adaptation of the Poe classic ...  as for the product itself the only reason I didn't give it five stars was the two-sided DVD ... Not a fan of this form of  packaging  ..  maybe because it was a made for TV presentation the video quality of the second presentation is a notch below the movie ...  outside of these complaints,still,like I mentioned before, a must see for Vincent Price fans ...  if you're willing to purchase a two sided disk !!!",1525305600,,830,4.359477124183006

But as a fright film this plays more like a Dark Shadows episode than his other works based on  E A Poe, which included some real shocks. A bit slow at times!",1516924800,,259,4.395833333333333

It has the ""feel"" of these films that started in 1960 with ""House of Usher"" -- if you liked the others, so this one goes.  The partner video is interesting:  Price reading four Poe classics, bringing them to life as he can do so well.  Double, Double:  Poe himself done twice, in movie and in spoken word.",1504224000,,408,4.315789473684211
