2747948,5,B000MTOSB6,I really enjoy this kickboxing workout.  It gets my heart rate flying and I sweat like crazy.  Danny Sullivan is very enthusiastic about his workout and following it is easy.,1209340800,,174,4.766666666666667
2747949,4,B000MTOSB6,"This workout is so much fun! I was worried at first when I watched the dvd's before doing them because there's a lot of repetition. But, it doesn't get boring. This is something anyone can do. If you're a beginner when it comes to cardio exercise you may have to do a little and work up to finishing a workout. I'd consider myself intermediate and I am really breathing!
The only reason I didn't give this dvd set five stars is because you don't really know how long the workouts are except for the 20min workout. The other three dvds don't tell you how long they are.
If you want to get in shape fast, buy this!",1204070400,,612,4.239316239316239
2747950,5,B000MTOSB6,I bought this video for my husband because he likes to workout on his punching bag and was looking for a good video to help him get the most out of his workouts.  He likes the fact that real kickboxing moves are used.  He is very pleased with the video. I know he is getting an awesome workout because he is out of breath and sweating like crazy by the time he is done.  He is already in pretty good shape and has been working out on a bag for several years.  I would highly recommend this video for beginners and those who are more advanced.,1203638400,2,542,4.084905660377358
2747951,4,B000MTOSB6,"If you like cardio/real kickboxing, the kind you would take at a martial arts school for over $80 - $100 bucks a month, then you will love these workout DVD's.  It's the same style of instruction you would get from taking a group class at a martial arts school.  If you have the will power to do your own work out at home, then buy these DVD's, you will save tons of money. The only down fall is you will need to buy the boxing equipment if you don't already own it.  You need a boxing bag (stand up preferably, works best for this type of training), gloves and wraps. Upside is you can obtain these items at your local WALMART style discount store.  Overall great workout!!!!",1202860800,4,676,4.299212598425197
2747952,2,B000MTOSB6,"I didn't find the video to be as high energy as I hoped. There is too much time inbetween moves. The voice of the person instructing the sequence of moves during the workout is very irritating - I wish that wasn't on the workout at all! It makes it very hard to listen to.
It's a good workout but not what I expected.",1202860800,,317,4.0476190476190474
2747953,3,B000MTOSB6,"I've been taking kickboxing classes at various gyms and martial arts studios for many years now so I really appreciate kickboxing combinations that are challenging. Real Kickboxing Bag workout offers these types of combinations. Also, I like the format that the workouts are in. They are arranged in 2 min rounds. So, for 2 mins, you can work at your own pace doing the different combinations (which is good for both advanced and beginner kickboxers). However, only the intermediate and advanced workouts are worth using again and again. So, for the price, I'm not happy with the amount of actual instruction contained in this set.",1202428800,10,631,5.019047619047619
2747954,5,B000MTOSB6,"This has to be one of the most unique and effective At-Home Fitness Videos/DVDs!!! It is fun and challenging and I'm seeing the results quicker than I thought.

Danny Sullivan is the instructor of this workout.  I believe this is his first workout video, but I think we'll be seeing a lot from him.  I've read that he is owner & head instructor of OC Kickboxing and Martial Arts in Irvine and he created the first Real Kickboxing workout at home, on a bag! It's seriously the best workout I've ever done at home. The only drawback is that you need to purchase the bag and equipment to do the workout. The bundle includes:

Set of 4 DVD's - 5 workouts,Instructional Workout,Beginning Workout,Intermediate Workout,Advanced Workout,20 Minute Workout

Heavy Duty Freestanding Punching Bag ,Boxing Gloves, Hand Wraps , and Jump Rope

The 5 Workouts are very easy to follow for beginners, yet very fluid for those who pick things up quickly & are more advanced.

The Instructional Workout - This focuses on the basics of kickboxing, how to wrap your hands, teaches the main punches, kicks, etc.

Each of the workouts start off with skip/jump roping to get your heart pumping and to get your blood flowing throughout your body. Sometimes I do it without a jump rope and either jog in place or jump in place.

After the 2 minutes of jump roping, Danny guides you through a warm-up/stretch phase. This isn't your typical warm-up. Like any at-home fitness program you can go at your own pace, but Danny incorporates some awesome stretches and warm-up moves to really get you pumping. Not only do you prepare your body for the Workout, but you are already sweating and burning calories during the warm up!

Each bag workout is separated into rounds. It starts from easy combinations & gets a bit more challenging as the rounds progress. After each 2 minute round, there is a 10-30 second ""blitz"" round. Not only does Danny encourage you as you workout, but there is also a ""call"" that guides you on the moves. So, if you are uncoordinated like me, you can hear the ""jab"", ""cross"", ""hooks"", so you know what the next moves and combinations are. As you get better and improve, then you can wean yourself from having to keep your eye on the TV, you can listen to the calls & concentrate more on your form than on the TV screen.

Danny ends the bag workout with the cool down and abs. He introduces some different stretches & a very kick-*** abs workout. He also works on your core, which a lot of workouts forget to do.

I've never been as satisfied with an at-home workout system as I am with the Real Kickboxing workout. The music is great, a nice blend of music that makes it fun to work out to. You have the opportunity to workout at your own level and you can challenge yourself by kicking harder or faster and punching stronger.

I give this product 5*****!",1172016000,24,2849,4.584645669291339
8172216,5,B000MTOSB6,"I purchased this DVD set two years ago and used it obsessively to get into shape for my wedding in 2009.  I really love this set because of I am the kind of person who needs variety and the structure of a timed workout.  That being said, I really hope Danny Sullivan and the OC Kickboxing crew make a new up-to-date video with new workouts.  There's only so many times you can do the same DVD and routines.  Help me Danny Sullivan, you're my only hope!",1306627200,,452,4.22093023255814
8172217,5,B000MTOSB6,"Don't be intimidated by the high kick on the cover art; that's for show.  Full body coordination with combinations of low round house kick, jabs cross, hook, uppercut, knees, and straight push licks.  Great cardio workouts!!!",1268006400,,225,5.222222222222222
8172218,5,B000MTOSB6,"Danny has created a good, very well organized workout.  The techniques are solid and the combinations become progressively more complex with each building on the last.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good cardio and conditioning workout.",1258502400,,260,5.166666666666667
8172219,2,B000MTOSB6,"For someone who is in advanced kickboxing classes, these DVDs, particularly the advanced, were just way too slow.  Too much instruction and not enough kick time.",1257897600,,161,5.1923076923076925
8172220,1,B000MTOSB6,"As another reviewer noted, the production is cheesy.  However, as a martial artist with 20 years experience and a certified personal trainer with a specialty in biomechanics, I can also say that I would never allow my clients/students to perform these techniques.  Many are just a sprained wrist waiting to happen.  The technique combinations are poorly conceived, and the calorie burn is not that significant (tested with a top HR monitor) for anyone in average shape.  I only wish that I could rate the item lower.",1249516800,7,516,4.965116279069767
8172221,5,B000MTOSB6,"I ordered these because I used to take a kickboxing class years ago and eventually taught the class after a few years.  I have the equipment at home, but after having a child 3 years ago, I needed the extra motivation, but didn't want to go take another class somewhere.  I was surprised when I actually found this bag workout on Amazon.  I tried out the beginner workout yesterday and it is incredibly similar (almost identical) to the class I taught.  It is as tough as kickboxing should be and I was so pleased with that.  Kickboxing is an absolute calorie shredder and even this beginner workout had me sweating like crazy!  What I love about these videos is that they are bag workouts and not TaeBo.  The voice calling out the moves is a little weird, but it's also helpful so that you don't have to look at the TV to see what's next.  It's a tough workout, but totally worth it in my opinion.",1244160000,,898,4.367469879518072
8172222,5,B000MTOSB6,"When I decided to take the plunge and make a serious effort to get in shape, I also decided to spend a little extra money and buy these DVDs. What a great decision it was! I used to kickbox a long time ago, so I knew the basic moves, but these DVDs allowed me to refresh my memory and slowly work back up to my former pace. The instructional video is great for beginners who need to know how to do this, and the beginner's video builds on this info.

But the intermediate video is where it really takes off. Straight from the warm up on, you will be sweating and working your whole body. The advanced is great, too - it's well explained enough that I can do it if I'm feeling ambitious, or I can wait until I'm a little more fit.

I also really love Danny Sullivan. He's not a pretty girl with perfect hair and makeup telling you to sweat. He's just this normal, enthusiastic guy who is really into kickboxing. His attitude helps me stay motivated!

I highly rec Realing Kickboxing. I know it's a bit pricy, but it's worth every penny. In four months, I've lost almost 45 pounds!",1240704000,,1079,4.253658536585366
8172223,5,B000MTOSB6,"This is a great workout.  You warm up before, and do a great ab workout at the end of the bag workout session.  Make sure you have wrist wraps- those help out alot when you are punching.  We do this workout on a hanging heavy bag versus a standup bag and it still works great!",1231891200,,276,3.981818181818182
8172224,5,B000MTOSB6,"I have been using this dvd as a total newcomer to kickboxing. I've found the instruction to be very clear, easy to understand and keep pace with as Danny goes over an instruction more than once before continuing, and uses a ""caller"" to guide you through the moves before you make them.
This workout can be as cautious or full on as you want to make it, it's a total kit of instruction, and with Danny's positive high energy attitude you really feel like you can do whatever he directs.
In addition, I have always maintained a high level of fitness and still find I'm getting a thorough workout, so anyone worrying about it not being high intensity enough, FORGET IT!

8172225,4,B000MTOSB6,"This item was out of stock on Amazon so I ordered this directly from the seller. DO NOT DO THIS. They are a nightmare to work with. They take almost 3 weeks to send the item, have phantom customer service (you get a generic order operator that handles many other companies and has no way to contact the seller other than submitting an order). Their website didn't work for submitting orders or inquiries. You'll have a much better experience if you order from Amazon. The PRODUCT is great however. I like how the trainer keeps the workouts balanced for all limbs and core. This is a complete workout. The readily apparent downside with watching a DVD instead of having a real trainer is you don't have time to wipe the sweat out of your eyes and you can't pause the DVD with boxing gloves on. The other is that at some point you're going to want new routines. Some of the warmups and cooldowns in this series are duplicates from other discs. But, overall this is one of the best workouts you'll ever get.",1221782400,,1004,4.461956521739131
