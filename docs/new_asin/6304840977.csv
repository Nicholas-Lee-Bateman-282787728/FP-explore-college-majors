7878683,4,6304840977,I bought this movie for my grandmother and she loved it. We watched it today and she was excited and pointed out every movie and concert she went to that was in this movie. Great movie!,1452643200,,185,4.166666666666667
7878684,5,6304840977,"The life and career of the most remarkable performer in the history of rock and roll, Elvis Presley, is examined in this video. Using photos, vintage film footage and interviews with those who knew and worked with him, this documentary gives a portrait of Elvis the Man, as well as Elvis the Entertainer.",1341964800,,304,4.754716981132075
7878685,1,6304840977,"This has to be one of the worst DVDs about Elvis I have ever seen.  The movie clips and actually footage of Elvis are good, but nothing new and can be seen elsewhere. The worst part is the fake Elvis voice-over! I consider myself a huge Elvis fan and more than half of the information is incorrect and extremely misleading. Elvis would have never said those things. This is a poorly produced DVD that looks as if it were edited in someone's garage.  I am sorry I purchased it and hope to save you some money. I would give a 0 star if available.....",1324857600,2,548,4.259615384615385
7878686,1,6304840977,"Ladies and gentlemen, the winner for worst Elvis documentary ever made is......(drum roll)...""Elvis: The Complete Story""! (no applause heard) If you are an absolute completest, you will be forced to get this (at least it's cheap). Otherwise, run from this dvd like a scared little girl. It is partially narrated by a guy trying, and failing, to sound like Elvis. It is a film straight out of the worst tabloids. It takes considerable liberties with a little thing I like to call REALITY! It sets up Elvis as the naive country hick mammas boy stumbling through the greatest career in showbiz history like Forrest Gump. His mother as the loud overbearing pill popping alcoholic who is always fighting with his drunk, skirt chasing father. Elvis' manager, Col. Tom Parker is painted as the vile, evil villain who robs Elvis blind and blackmails him with revealling the sorted ""truth"" of his mothers death to the public. You will wonder how Elvis managed to become the greatest superstar of all time with his manager doing everything in his power to destroy Elvis' career.

This miserable excuse for a documentary goes from ridiculous to horrible. If you are very knowledgeable of the story of Elvis' life, you might find this funny. If you aren't, it is a terrible misguiding thing to watch. I must own close to fifty shows on Elvis, and this is the absolute worst due to the alterations or exaggerations of the truth. Elvis wasn't perfect, but the info presented here is simply wrong, facts are mixed up or reality is scewed to paint an ugly picture. His legacy deserves more respect.

Do yourself a favor, go elsewhere. The rare footage mentioned in other reviews is available lots of other places. The Sinatra Show is available on dvd in its entirety here at Amazon, footage from Elvis in Concert is available with sound, on the ""Elvis the Great Performances"" box set, or volume one of that set sold alone and sub titled ""Center Stage"". The movie trailers are also available on a dvd themselves. Contact me if you want to know where to find any footage you think is on this dvd.

This dvd does not deserve a single star rating, unfortunately that's as low as we can go. Amazon needs to offer a ""turkey"" option.",1174262400,3,2210,4.72020725388601
7878687,2,6304840977,"There's a lot of rare footage in this film, the only problem is that it has an overdub of someone saying Elvis quotes all through the documentary and the guys trying to sound like Elvis and he fails. If we got more rare footage and removed the annoying impersonator overdub, this would be a nice movie for your collection. It does however mark the first time that anything from Elvis in Concert appeared on DVD (even though there's no audio). Nice addition to an Elvis collection but not something you'll watch often.",1004313600,9,517,4.630434782608695
7878688,2,6304840977,"I'm quite dissapointed about this dvd. It is like a dull B movie compared to other rockumentaries. Even though the film actually shows trailers or scenes from all his 33 movies, the ""substance"" of this film comes  from gossip or second hand info from books published long ago. Other than  that, nothing new. The voice over is done by a second hand rate  impersonator that seems like he's doing a parody of Elvis. It would be  better that there were other dvds from Elvis like Elvis On Tour or films  like Blue Hawaii, Flaming Star, Fun in Acapulco or Girls, Girls, Girls.  Don't waste your money...",951868800,39,598,4.59433962264151
