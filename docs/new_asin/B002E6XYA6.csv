3915735,5,B002E6XYA6,"This truly is a great movie.  My whole family enjoyed this movie, although we all got teary eyed at the end.  It's refreshing to see a movie about how life isn't perfect and is painful sometimes, but we have a choice to trust in the Lord.",1288137600,2,238,4.1521739130434785
3915736,5,B002E6XYA6,"Our family loved this movie! What a precious movie; extremely moving and encouraging. While it discussed deep topics, it was well written so that even younger ones can watch it and appreciate it. My 5, 8, 11, and 15  year olds watched this; as well as my husband and I. We were all moved; great movie!",1279584000,5,301,4.375
3915737,4,B002E6XYA6,"I was in high school, a year older than Amy, during the time all this was going on.  One of my best friends was good friends with her.  A few people from my church went on the mission trip with her to Africa.  I don't remember Tyler or Jordan, but I do remember meeting Amy a few times and the sense of hope she had and how upbeat she was about all that was going on in her life and the faith she had.  She had a kindness about her, and a beautiful smile.  God used her to basically start a revival in our high school.  Kids all over the school were touched by her.  I remember going to visit her at the hospital once with my friend, and the room was just packed with cards and things.  And the high school really did have things hanging up all over the walls with ""get well Amy"".  I also attended her bible study group at school.  I do not remember it being at six in the morning, though.  She was an inspiration to people all over this town.  God was shown through her life.",1278979200,13,976,4.0
3915738,5,B002E6XYA6,"I was surprised this was such a good movie for an independent film. Because it is a true story , it has a real message for today's culture.  I would recommend this movie to any family who desires to increase their faith.",1267833600,6,220,4.238095238095238

8366908,1,B002E6XYA6,"I am sorry to say that I did not enjoy this movie. The story was great and the message in the film was terrific. But the reason I am giving a one star is because the movie is of the worst quality. I have seen bad acting before this has to be one of the worst. I couldn't stand the actress who played Amy. She looked like she was trying to hard. The actor for Jordon was worse and the actress for Ariel made me want to run out of the room. I REALLY wish I liked this movie, but I just can't. I wish someone would make another movie of the story of Amy Newhouse with better quality and better actors. The story in this movie is GREAT. But, the movie itself needs ALOT of work.",1420243200,,674,3.927007299270073
8366909,4,B002E6XYA6,"This was a bit of a roller coaster ride. Amy was such a sweetheart, the all-American girl. While the kids around her wandered through their lives without purpose, Amy knows what she wants to do. Unfortunately cancer intervenes and the peppy little encourager of all others finds herself in the position of needing some encouragement. This had a nice subtheme about interacting with kids who are loners. The acting was decent, allowing us to get emotionally involved in the threat to Amy's life. Definitely worth watching.",1360108800,,521,5.069767441860465
8366910,5,B002E6XYA6,"This has a wonderful message ~ based on a true story.
We would highly recommend it to all our friends.",1357689600,,102,4.15
8366911,5,B002E6XYA6,Boy!  what can I say but as a man the tears flowed from my eyes watching this movie.  I too lost a child from cancer and this movie was heart breaking and inspirational.,1350604800,,169,4.090909090909091
8366912,4,B002E6XYA6,"The presence Of God in Amy's testimony is the important part of this movie. It WILL bolster faith in God and evoke a high level of worthfulness in one's life, if it is dedicated to serving God. Acting was above par in the roles of Amy and the young agnostic she befriends. The rest, passable except for the two doctors who were terrible. You would think that the two characters who were so visible in the crisis in Amy's life would be more credible - no way! Production sequencing lacked as scenes seemed to keep repeating themselves. Thank God the message and strength of Amy's faith shown through and resulted in a faith strengthening vehicle. Anyone facing cancer should watch it!",1346025600,,683,4.652892561983471
8366913,5,B002E6XYA6,"Faith Based Filming has come a long way toward taking their place alongside typical Hollywood flicks. It is shown to be a lower budget production from viewing the bonus behind the scenes material, where cast double as filming assistants but the job gets done, and done well. In this case it tells a TRUE story, perhaps somewhat altered to get years down to minutes, but the drama is certainly encapsulated. It is the story of Amy Newhouse, her battle with cancer, the ups and downs, and the faith and hope that she was able to not only keep herself, but pass along to others during the ordeal.

What a perfect choice it was to cast Anne Underwood as Amy. She is joy personified. Her bubbly personality is contagious right off the screen. She is only the first of truly believable characters in this film. Another that must be mentioned is Paul Willis playing a teen with punk hair. I'm a retired teacher, and believe me when I say these two were honestly teen-realistic. I've taught hundreds like them.

Bradley Dorsey as Tyler is the love angle in Amy's life. He looks the part (so young) of a lovesick teen boy until you see Behind the Scenes and see him as director (also writer, producer, editor, and who knows what else. There is a wait, but in Dec 2012, his new film is to be released which he does many roles again including lead, joined by Della Reese and Michael Gross. There's a step up.

While this is definitely faith based, it is not Christianity in your face, unless you take the role of Amy to heart, which you should, because she was a teenage on-fire Christian and planning for the mission field. God had a different story in mind. Watch this film and see it revealed. Well done Mr. Dorsey, cast and crew.

No subtitles, perhaps the only flaw.
It has a commentary option in the bonus stuff.
