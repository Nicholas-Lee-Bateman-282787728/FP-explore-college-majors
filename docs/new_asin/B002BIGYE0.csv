8361416,4,B002BIGYE0,"Wendy Froud is an excellent instructor on the mechanics of doll design, however the camera shots are poorly planned as her hands are far too often blocking the work she is doing. Her method of costume designing for dolls is somewhat crude, but justified as these are simply ""demos."" Wendy has a more ""intuitive"" approach to design that might frustrate someone wanting everything explained step by step.",1396051200,3,402,5.014925373134329
8361417,5,B002BIGYE0,"I found this tutorial to be clear and concise. A great follow up to Wendy Frouds create a fairy figure, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1393027200,,128,4.375

 My house is to hot right now, but I just ordered a air conditioner.",1373414400,2,272,3.7719298245614037
8361419,5,B002BIGYE0,"GREAT SERVICE, DELIVERY AND OVER-ALL A WONDERFUL DVD, OR SHOULD I SAY ""DVD'S"" YOU CAN LEARN SOOO MUCH!! PERFECT FOR A BEGINNER OR EVEN SOMEONE ADVANCED (LIKE ME) WHO JUST WANTS TO LEARN MORE TRICKS AND DIFFERENT STYLES FROM THE EXPERTS!! I WILL BE BACK FOR MORE!!",1366848000,3,263,4.617021276595745
8361420,5,B002BIGYE0,"This dvd gives you all the trade secrets of acclaimed sculpture artist Wendy Froud! Though you should probably invest in her first dvd, which covers the basics of custom doll making,  this is a hands on tutorial on how to sculpt character's like a pro! My designes and figures started coming out so much better after learning Wendy's trade secrets in sculpting, technique, and painting and clothing. The video is crisp and professionally filmed. I don't know what that other reviewer is talking about, I was able to follow along and see everything just fine. I cannot recommend this enough and I certainly hope they make more with Mrs. Froud!",1312070400,,642,4.836363636363636
8361421,2,B002BIGYE0,"Though a very informative DVD, the production could have been much better for the cost of the product.  The biggest complaint I have would have is the filming of Wendy Froud's work was done over her left shoulder, she is left handed.  Basically, many details she preformed were blocked by her hand.",1305504000,3,298,4.711538461538462
