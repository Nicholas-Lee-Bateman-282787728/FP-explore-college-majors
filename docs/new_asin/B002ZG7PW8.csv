4018297,4,B002ZG7PW8,"This is a great series of a crime doctor.  Well acted and interesting.  Corpses tell the story here, but it is all done in good taste.  The series is actually done by two different groups of actors.  I would start with Series One.

This is not playable on USA format DVD players.
There are some great European detective series and many other films that are only watchable on European format playable DVD's. (PAL)

I finally bought an all region DVD player for $113 delivered and it did the trick.  With this type of player one can watch any DVD and also watch PAL formatted Silent Witness, Inspector Montalbano and Wallander, both great series with sub-titles.  There are many series that are available only in Europe (See AMAZON United Kingdom).  Remember: You are buying in British Pounds!  The good news is that you pay no VAT Tax shipping to the USA and this normally more than pays for shipping charges.  Your bank will also charhge you 3% for converting EURO to US Dollars.

Bottom line:  If you want to watch some great crime dramas, you won't go wrong with sampling SILENT WITNESS, WALLANDER and our favorite, INSPECTOR MONTALBANO.  I would start with the beginning shows of each series and see which you prefer.  They require some viewing continuity for them to make solid sense.  For instance, don't buy and watch #4 before you buy and view #1 of each title.  Watch them in turn!  It makes for better viewing.",1358294400,7,1419,4.653225806451613
4018298,3,B002ZG7PW8,"The plots are barely interesting. [The Norwegian series, Beck, (later series only in PAL but even better; early ones in area 1 -- U.S./Canada) is far, far better. The acting is superb and the scripts truly original, no formulaic ones]

In the series 1 and 2 Amanda Burton is only in the first of four episodes. Her (helpers, two men, take over ad forensic pathologists and they are really good. The first episode wad distinguished by poor directing, as if the whole company was in a rehearsal.

In series 3 and 4, Amanda Burton stands out as someone who has been directed badly. She is all inappropriate smiling, undulating, willowy, moving body and especially head moves moves, with chin juts, tips to the side, as if she is attempting to play a saint. She lacks many appropriate, 'normal person' reactions in favor of an inexplicably  'mature, withholding, secretive persona. And, given the extremity of this sort of sterotype,  we are not given a personal explanation for who she thinks she is. The first episode was interesting in that it included her past, a father who (I think) was killed, a policeman in Northern Ireland during 'the troubles'. She has to find out if it was he, among three policeman suspects, who murdered some other people. And it wad her personal involvement that carried it through despite the woodenish production.

In this set of 3 and 4 her 'indicating' and, again, her consistently annoying acting choices, unrelieved by a sharp director (the other actors were fine) for her or by her not having taken a perceptible method acting class will keep me from buying more of this series.

(The series was done in 1998. It should be looked at in that context, probably. These days protagonists are more complicated, either show their past reasons for how they behave as they do or have character flaws which make them seem more human.",1354924800,3,1859,4.79375

8384798,1,B002ZG7PW8,"Well, I love the series--I hate the idea that Americans are allowed to buy them but are not allowed to change the region from 1 to 2.  I could scan down a list of countries with the first two series but thereafter there is no choice.  Why sell to America if we can't watch it?  Then we have to pay postage to return it!",1428969600,,319,3.953125
