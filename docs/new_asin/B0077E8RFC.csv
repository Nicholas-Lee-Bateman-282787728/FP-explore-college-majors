5060619,5,B0077E8RFC,"'Bullhead' is one of those films that you will either love or hate. Not to do with the acting, perhaps to do with the subtitles, but moreover to do with the fact that it is a long, dark, foreign indie film that doesn't stray too far from the path of cow farming and the mafia that can sometimes go with that.

But, to miss out on viewing this masterpiece, to not witness what has to be one of the most incredible, passionately heartbreaking, violently stoic movies of the past decade is to have let something breathtaking avoid your gaze.

The film opens with a spoken warning that, basically, things long since buried have a way to still come back and bite you in the ass! Our lead actor, a domineering brute of a cattle farmer Jacky Vanmarsenille (played by a pumped-up-for-the-role Mattias Schoenaerts) is hooked on all manner of drugs. Why, we don't know quite yet, but nevertheless he is a force to be reckoned with - for others and himself. It turns out he is using Androstederm to fatten his cows. It fattens the animals in 8 weeks, not 10 weeks and after injected half an hour later is out of their system. It also adds 10% fat to their body weight! Jacky also uses it in small doses.

It turns out that in Belgium there is such a thing as the Hormone Mafia Underworld, which deals in such acts as this with other farmers. But why is Jacky so angry when he makes all this money, well, that is shown in a 20 year flashback to being a young boy; and the cruel, painful victim of a mentally-challenged older boy. An act that went unpunished at the time, it changed Jacky's life forever and put him instantly on the path of self-destruction.

Having taken growth hormones since being a little boy, we see how he views women, sex, gives out beatings and keeps injecting himself day in day out. His harrowing ordeal back all those years ago is hard, so very tough to watch (as a man), but suddenly explains everything as we progress.

His young friend at the time, Dieterick is now a distant adult friend of his, but out of nowhere he finds out that when he goes to do a new cow drugging deal, there is his old friend - worryingly involved in the whole thing. Now he's taking more, just to get by. Such high profile drugs as Sustanon, Mestanolone and Methyltestosterone which is making him think less and act more (hence the title of the film).

There are brutal scenes of a nightclub beating, a REAL cow gets cut open and has her calf removed (you simply couldn't fake that, for as the knife cuts the cow moans and flinches), and soon Jacky is visiting the long-lost never-had woman he could have had in his life. And so, as we get to the finale of this incredible film, Jacky is ploughed on as many drugs as he can inject and digest and takes on the world in one last stand.

The director, in the special features behind-the-scenes tells the young boy who plays the Young Dieterick in the flim that Jacky's spirit will come back and inherit the body of him in 'Bullhead 2.' The boy never flinches and says, ""I'll still be playing the role, yes?"" To which the director sarcastically responds with, Yes, ... but ten years from now!"" We can only hope. We can only hope.",1340150400,14,3170,4.399317406143345
5060620,4,B0077E8RFC,"Of maybe the last fifty films I have seen Bullhead has the most powerful opening. The first two minutes are the director's tiket to ensure you switch off the rest of the world as you dive into Bullhead.  The subtitles take a bit of getting used to which is my qualm with the film but then I doubt the director made the film for an international audience alone. What I enjoyed most was it's unabashed fits of power. There will be a couple of scenes that are very intense and this will hold you in stead but at other times, you'll be waiting for characters to get a move on. Bullhead was nominated for the foreign film oscar and got the head for nomination ahead of films like ""The Skin I LIve In""  (to me the best foreign language film of 2011) so you can imagine that it has just the right amount of AMMO to get you.

The good - Great story, intriguing central character, powerful opening
The not so good - The subtitles and the translation renders the film a little bleak. Wish it was a little more evolved.
Overall - A strong film you won't forget for years.",1332201600,2,1060,4.263681592039801
5060621,4,B0077E8RFC,"""Bullhead"" (2011 release from Belgium; 128 min.) brings the story of Jacky Vanmarsenille who raises cattle on his family farm in Flanders, Belgium (close to the language border with French-speaking Wallonia). The movie begins with Jacky becoming involved with the so-called ""hormone maffia"". Soon thereafter we get a second parallel story line into the movie, which starts off with some traumatic events for Jacky taking place 20 years ago when he was 12-13 years old and which cause Jacky to have trouble developing relationships with women. The first hour of the movie edvelops rather slowly, developing the characters and bringing context to the overall movie, but it sets the stage for a very intense second hour of the movie, in which it all comes together. I wish I could say more of the plot line but it really would spoil some of the surprises in the movie, so you'll just have to trust me when I say that you will be at the edge of your seat as the movie goes down to its conclusion.

Several thoughts and comments: (1) Matthias Schoenaerts does an incredible job in the title role of the movie. A very physical presence and performance. (2) Even though this is a ""Flemish"" movie, about one-third of the movie actually takes place in and around French-speaking Liege. I mention this as the contrast between Flanders and Wallonia is an important element of the movie. (3) This movie is not for the faint of heart: there are a number of violent and bloody scenes thoughout the movie. (4) If you can handle the violence and brutality, you are in for a treat as this movie is very well done, showing once again that you don't need $250 million (the reported budget of the upcoming Disney movie ""John Carter"") to produce an engaging and entertaining (if rough and tough) movie.

Last but not least, I am a native Belgian (although now a long-time resident of the US) and I couldn't help but feel some pride to see that a ""little"" country like Belgium can produce such a quality movie once in a while. The movie is nominated for Best Foreign Film Oscar, and I guess I'll find out later tonight if it won. No, this movie is not for everyone, but if you do like foreign and indie movies, I can assure you that you'll appreciate and enjoy ""Bullhead"". Highly recommended!",1330214400,24,2270,4.644278606965174
5060622,4,B0077E8RFC,"Bullhead is the story of Jacky Vanmarsenille (Matthias Schoenaerts) a cattle farmer. He along with his business partners inject their cows with steroids and hormones to achieve the results they desire. The problem is the only thing Jacky injects more than his cows is himself as he's got some sort of chemical compound coursing through his veins at all times. Things begin to go south when Jacky makes a deal to distribute his cows to a well-known yet crooked meat trader. A federal agent is killed amongst their negotiations as Jacky is dragged into the investigation and his disturbing past comes bubbling to the surface.

Matthias Schoenaerts' performance is the first thing that will win you over. The reason why he shoots up so frequently along with what he injects himself with has this really breathtaking explanation. Schoenaerts has a short fuse the entire film and you never know when he's going to explode. That's the beauty of his performance. He's so dangerous yet you can't help but feel sympathy for the guy. Schoenaerts is a ferocious powerhouse that chews you up and spits you out like the most devastating hurricane imaginable.

Bullhead features some incredibly impressive cinematography. Belgium has never looked so beautiful. Those shots of the sky and the clouds that populate every inch of it and those lush moments of taking in the countryside speak volumes. Something as simple as grass blowing in the wind is made to look like this grand accomplishment thanks to how the film was shot. It was interesting to see characters that were out of frame become out of focus and or blurred in some way; whether they were approaching somebody in frame or walking away. It was a masterful touch.

The Belgian drama has a unique sense of perspective, as well. The dizzying staircase sequence near the end of the film is the best example. It kind of goes hand in hand with the cinematography though; a brilliant looking film is even better with distinguishing shots. Speaking of unique, the entire film is one of the more original experiences to grace the silver screen in quite some time. Bullhead does draw comparisons to films like Drive and even Bronson, but the mafia and mobster kind of storyline is presented in this rough, grainy, meaty, and intense package that hasn't been done before. Bronson is actually a really great comparison. Matthias Schoenaerts put on 59 pounds of muscle for Bullhead and Tom Hardy put on 42 pounds of muscle for Bronson. While the two films are almost nothing alike when it comes to their storylines, they're extremely similar at their core.

Bullhead is an extremely intense piece of cinema that includes a fairly bloody and hard hitting elevator sequence that rivals that infamous scene from Drive. With an incredible performance from Matthias Schoenaerts, gorgeous camera work, and a huge injection of originality, Bullhead should not be missed by anyone especially those who are looking for something different when it comes to movies. This comes highly recommended for those who enjoyed Animal Kingdom, A Prophet, Drive, and/or Bronson.",1329523200,37,3091,4.996116504854369

5060628,5,B0077E8RFC,"This film is a masterpiece at depicting the long-term, systemic, destructive impact of trauma on a human being's life.  It captures inescapable shock and horror and the price children pay for being powerless and helpless.  It is a study of a man trying to manage the unmanageable through coping strategies that heal nothing.  The silent suffering he endures moment to moment, his isolation, despair and hopelessness are barely contained.  Matthias portrays a man who lives with loss so great that it penetrates to the very depths of his soul where the real damage is done.  His performance is leveling.  He lives with the knowledge that he will never be whole.  I feel I have been waiting for a movie that could go there - full circle - to the point of no return.  A film that would so skillfully and gracefully dare to give a face to the walking mortally wounded.

5060702,5,B0077E8RFC,"It was a brutal movie, but really an excellent one. I did not expect the plot to be like that. It surprised me in a good way. It is a story of a boy/man who was attacked and brutalized by a boy who himself was mentally sick. The injury was so extensive that in order to function as a man he would have to take hormones the rest of his life. Twenty years later, he is challenged by the effects of the hormones, what they do to him, and how the simply fact he is lonely and still pines for the same girl he got attacked for. He is feared, and he is respected. He belongs to the family who deals with selling meat, but the meat or rather cows are injected with hormones. There is additional story there, a criminal that intertwines with main's character and in the end it decides about his whole life. Matthias Schoenaert is excellent as Jacky. He is bulky, strong, penancing, but at the same time tender, hurt, and caring. His face says everything. Each emotion is there, his body adds to it, the pain, the harshness of hormones, the struggle and the void in his life.

Jacky, the main character, is literally a testosterone freak, an accident waiting to happen.  He is as hyped up as the cows he injects with hormone as part of his mafia hormone operation.  The saddest part of this movie is that he is no different then the cows.  He has muscles in all the wrong places (literally) and is just grotesque.

On an ordinary day decades before, the deranged son of a mafia boss severely mangles a boy, taking away any future chance for that boy to ever become a potent man.  So Jacky is a wounded child trapped in a crippled man's body and will never reach his full potential.  It is a violent world.  Jacky plays his part all too well.

But Jacky is not the only one stranded in the veil of the past.  Those who bore witness to the child' struggles after the devastating attack will never escape the guilt and the anger of that day.

One way or another, Bullhead never hesitates.  The acting is brilliant and our heart breaks...for Jacky.",1443830400,5,1163,4.348837209302325

The viewer continually feels sorry for Jacky for the majority of the film due to what has happened to him in the past and the victim of circumstance that he has become. Under normal circumstances he would be viewed as a bully but not here. I highly recommend this movie.

I will be eagerly anticipating the next film from Roskam. I recently watched The Drop and very much enjoyed that as well but not as much as Bullhead. There is a similar tension throughout both films but Bullhead seems to develop the depth of the main character much more.

5060750,5,B0077E8RFC,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Matthias Schoenaert is brilliant in portraying an emotionally tortured cattle farmer caught up in a real scandal called the Belgian Steroid Mafia. Every thing about the picture is authentic to include an actual ""Belgian Blue"" cattle farm in Flanders. Schoenaert speaks both Flemish and French in the movie. I've heard him speak English with a New York accent in a different movie. He's terrific. What is especially amazing is how we root for the Jacky, main character, even though he is a criminal. There is nothing glamorous here. Only a few scenes were filmed on a set. The location is bleak, rural ... Well, it's farmland. It's so well done.",1433030400,,693,4.735537190082645

Here he plays a man who was terribly injured as a boy and carries the physical injury and the psychic trauma into adulthood. As a result of the injury he lives an existence that is essentially solitary without partner or children. The problem with the movie is that the author felt obliged to draw an analogy between the traumatized/solitary  man and the bulls on the family farm. The man injects the animals with dangerous/illegal hormones in order to grow them for market. He injects himself with the same substances to grow himself and cope with his emotional pain. For me, the scriptwriter was not skilled enough to interweave the crime story and the psychological drama successfully.

5060754,5,B0077E8RFC,"This whole film was tense. It was wound tight like a guitar string and I didn't know when it would snap, whip back, and cut my face open.

This is Jacky's story. There are other characters but I was focused like a laser on Jacky. I found this movie after loving Schoenaerts in Rust & Bone. He blew me away in that movie but in this one he obliterated me. Jacky is a cow farmer who is constantly  injecting himself with steroids and hormones. the cows are injected too and this movie has quite a bit about the shady dealings that go on behind the scenes in the cow farming business. That was surprising. Anyway, Jacky is constantly pumped full of chemicals and whatnot. Have you ever heard of 'roid rage? Times that by a thousand. Jacky is like being surrounded by a million grenades...you know they're going to go off and what it happens, watch out.

There are flashbacks to Jacky's childhood that hint they will reveal his obsession with steroids and his very screwed up interactions with women. Many people have said the beginning of this film is slow. It was, I guess, but for me it was a slow burn that I knew would end up setting the characters' world on fire. When Jacky's past trauma is revealed...shocking doesn't quite cover it. Shocking doesn't cover it at all. It's so violent and traumatic to watch.

I thought that would be it but the movie kept going, I kept watching, and that wire snapped and definitely cut me open. I'm not sure a movie ending has ever made my chest hurt as much as this one did. Schoenaerts broke my heart. Absolutely broke it.

When I review movies I try not to give too much of them away, so I just give my impressions, feelings, and emotions while watching. This film was a revelation about the cruelty of children, the loss of innocence, the nature of violence and how it takes root and grows. I always want to watch it again but I'm also scared to have my emotions played so skillfully. I'll tell you one thing, watch it because it's worth it.",1415664000,13,1983,4.421917808219178

His buddy from his childhood turns out to be a whistle blower for the cops, theres a dead undercover cop and Jacky gets mixed up in the whole thing. At the end the friend tells him the truth and he runs off and hopes to get the girl but she is scared by him and calls the cops. In the end he shoots himself with a batch of testosterone and brawls with the cops who end up killing him.

5060761,4,B0077E8RFC,"""Wow""..that's how I felt when this movie wrapped up.  Not necessarily ""wow that was great"" or ""wow that was bad""...just ""wow"".

First off, this is yet another depressing-as-heck look at life and the harsh twists and turns it can smack folks with (one ""folk"" in particular in this movie).  The folks in this flick getting smacked by life also just happen to be everyday Belgians  who earn a living raising cattle and livestock, but who are also involved in the trade and use of growth hormones for the cattle they're raising.  Seems like a boring enough setup for a story, but this one STILL plays out with big impact as written and directed by Michal R. Roskam, and acted by the predominantly Flemish cast.  I'm not sure I've EVER seen an uplifting or hopeful movie come out of Belgium.  There are a few goofy comedies (like Iedereen Beroemd - Everybody's Famous) that aren't too depressing, but for the most part, the prominent flicks from Belgium are gritty, in-your-face, and emotionally taxing.  This pretty much fits the same mold.

Don't want to go into the plot, as it has been amply described in other reviews, but I wanted to give any folks considering this movie a little help to decide whether it's worth renting (I wouldn't consider buying this just because I'm not sure I'd want to watch it multiple times...it's just too much of a bummer, though for me, a bummer worth watching at least once).

Some pluses:

** Cinematography
As I've seen in a few other Belgian movies, the landscape almost plays a supporting character.  Long shots of farm fields and morning mist punctuate scene transitions and very much add to the mood of the film.  Everything just seems so ""real-life"" and the filming captures it wonderfully.

** Performances
Matthias Schoenaerts, the lead, is awesome as a steroid-addicted, broken shell of a man (as least what he thinks a man is supposed to be), heavily shaped by a childhood tragedy and struggling to get by day-to-day.  He IS the majority of the weight of the movie.  But, the rest of the supporting actors are all solid as well and there are no weak performances to detract from the rest of the story.

** Plot
Who would have thought an interesting enough story line could be developed around tragedy and growth hormone peddling Belgian ranchers?  I personally preferred the way the plot wasn't clear at first.  The viewer is allowed to do a little guess work regarding who is who and how the different elements in the story all relate.

Some negatives:

** It's just so dang heavy
The whole mood, the story, the performances.  MAN, there's nothing that puts a smile on your face in the whole movie.  And there's not supposed to be, so if you realize that going in, hopefully it's less of a negative.

** Story flow
It's a little hard to follow at first, starting in supposed present-day and then flashing back  at odd times to the main character's youth.  It all comes together later in the story (mostly), but it's a little odd at first.

So, 3.5 stars with a round-up to 4.  Worth watching for fans of storytelling and cinema (I think), but maybe not a great Friday night popcorn flick for forgetting your troubles.  Well...that being said, you might might actually be counting your blessings after watching this.",1391558400,2,3259,4.708480565371024

5060764,5,B0077E8RFC,"I caught a trailer for the this recently and thought it looked interesting, but to be honest I wasn't expecting much, it turns out I was wrong. This is an excellent film. It's a Belgian film that tells the story of Jacky, a man with a troubled past who is now involved with illegal meat trading (that doesn't sound like much, but it does make for an interesting story). He is always pumped up on steroids and is very violent, in fact it's fair to say that he's not a very likeable character.

It's says a lot for the actor and the story that through the course of the film he gets under your skin. You learn about why he became the way he is. In many ways it's an understated film, a character study of Jacky.

The surrounding cast also do a good job in what is essentially a grim tale, there's some nice visual moments as well, although like the film overall these are done in a subtle, unassuming manner. It's a hard film to pin down, it's a tale of a man and the consequences of his choices, it's not exciting, but it is very interesting and most importantly watchable.",1380326400,,1072,4.275862068965517

Roskam's feature debut film ""Bullhead"" (""Rundskop"") a crime drama, but I think it would be more accurate to call the Belgian film a character study. The film's tension comes less from the plot that is sometimes hard to follow, than from the exceptional performance of the star Matthias Schoenaerts as Jacky Vanmarsenille, a young cattle farmer making a deal involving growth hormones.

The shady deal results in a chain reaction of events including a murder of a police officer investigating illegal use of hormones, and Jacky's reunion with his childhood friend Diederik (Jeroen Perceval). As the film slowly (very slowly) unfolds, secrets about Jacky's past still traumatizing him will be revealed.

The narrative is complicated with a few flashbacks (where a very painful thing happens to a young boy), but the presence of Matthias Schoenaerts as Jacky almost makes us forget that. He is the driving force of the film throughout, as we come to understand what he has lost but still yearns for. The film was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film (but lost to ""A Separation"") and that is not surprising.

But the unnecessarily complex narrative structure including subplots about a police detective, and some uninspired moments involving the police investigation are so disappointing. Frankly I don't see the point of telling a story (itself a good one) in this confusing way. Or have I missed something?

What you will not miss is the powerhouse acting from Matthias Schoenaerts. His unpredictable character itself is well worth your watching.",1358985600,3,1592,5.182879377431907

It's well made and engrossing, with an emphasis on the feelings of the main character; the crime-drama/suspense genre attributes give the film a sense of plot aka direction, but are just a catalyst used to keep the film from being monotonous and meandering.  The film doesn't overpower anyone with its tone, it isn't a in-yo-face account of desperation, it doesn't bleed with urgency, but I did watch this entire thing and didn't hate it or feel any nagging sense that I could be doing something better with my time, which is more than I could say for SHAME (2012), INCEPTION and SHUTTER ISLAND (2011) and AVATAR (2010).",1355184000,,640,4.756756756756757

5060777,1,B0077E8RFC,"I don't get the 4 and 5 star reviews.  This film is neither ""intense"" nor ""powerful"".  In the beginning of the film, our protagonist lightly slaps around a guy who owes money.  Nothing happens after that until about hour later into the film, when he beats a guy into a coma because he cut in on a girl he was trying to make time with in a night club.  Those are the only two times he demonstrates his roid rage.

Actually, he plays a rather shy, stupid guy throughout the film.  He is never on the explosive edge.

And there is a really big problem with the plot:  The Belgian ""Mafia"" are suppose to be interested in the cattle market?  One kilo of white powder will produce more profit than the entire cattle market of Belgium.  Why not have the Belgian Mafia interested in cornering the grain market, or the ball bearing market, or the stolen car market?  These too are all high exposure risks and extremely low profit enterprises.  It's like a couple of screenwriters said ""How can we build a story around a cattle farmer who takes steroids?  I know -- let's add the Mafia, and give the guy a traumatic childhood experience!""  Good grief, they didn't ask each other ""Is there money in the cattle market?""  NO!

And there is one more problem: The little blond 12 yr old girl love interest, grows up as a dark brunette, looking nothing like her younger counter part.  It's like having a tall blond Dutch girl grow up to be a short dark haired Italian.  When this woman's character is made clear in the film, you will say ""They couldn't find a tall blond actress in all of Belgium?""

Schoenaerts' is Oscar material and the plot about his chilhood traumatic experience and aggressiveness in his adulthood is quite moving and scary respectively. For a moment, I thought Schoenaerts was not really acting but being himself. The movie also shows a bit of local culture, far from being a tourist board ad, and differences between the Wallonian and the Flemish people (the movie is in both French and the Limburgish language). However, there is also a meat hormones mafia plot that I did not like very much because I found it to be distracting. On the whole, an excellent film that teaches a lot of main stream films that big budgets and highly paid, attractive actors do not necessarily make a good movie.",1345248000,,752,4.837209302325581

5060783,4,B0077E8RFC,"Now and then a film comes along that is totally out of left field. So much so it might take the viewer some time to get his footing while watching. For me, this was such a film.

Here's the scoop. Jacky had a tragic incident in his past. He's a cattle farmer in Belgium and is constantly injecting himself with hormones and steroids. He also illegally pumps up his cattle. He's in on a deal involving high tech cattle hormones. A detective gets killed during the investigation and things begin to unravel. Add to this the fact that he has come across a woman tied to his past tragedy and he's in for some heavy soul searching.

This is not your usual crime thriller. Some of the bad guys are bad guys. Some of the good guys are good guys. But some occupy the fuzzy world in between. Such as Jacky himself. He's a thick, brutish guy who can kill you with his bare hands, but when you learn of his past, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to hate him. When he crosses paths with the woman tied to his past, his attempts to try and hook up with her are pitiful. As he notes of himself: All he's known all his life are animals. He cannot interact well with people. The end to all of this is fitting but it will break your heart.

I would need to see it again because some of the finer plot points got past me. I can't say if it was me or the way it was handled but I need a second viewing. That aside, it's remarkable that this is director Michael Roskam's first feature length film. He has a deft touch and mixes beauty and ugliness to drive home the sense of being trapped. Matthias Schoenaerts, as Jacky, has a lot of credits under his belt. He uses that experience here to create a truly memorable character. I can't say there was anyone on screen that didn't do a good job.

Foreign films aren't everyone's cup of tea, but if you're all predisposed to them, this is a real winner.",1344816000,2,1887,4.233333333333333
5060784,3,B0077E8RFC,"Many foreign films seem to often lose something in translation. Either the language barrier or the difference in lifestyles make them hard to follow along and relate to. But on occasion even those items can be leapt over and a solid story can be told and understood. Such is the case here.

Jacky is a beef farmer whose cattle are filled with growth hormones to increase their size and value. He makes a deal with an unscrupulous veterinarian to supply beef to a Flemish trader who is currently under investigation. When a federal inspector is murdered and it looks like this Flemish buyer is involved, Jacky wants out. But there is too much at stake for them to lose his product.

Good enough for one story but there is another going on as well underneath. A henchman for the Flemish gangster is Diedrik, a friend of Jacky's 20 years earlier. The two don't acknowledge one another in the gangster's presence but there is something going on. It seems that something happened 20 years ago that made them part ways and has had a lasting effect on Jacky, something that Diedrik wants to make up for.

This movie works on a number of levels. To begin with while taking place in a rather dull colored area, the look of the film is marvelous. Shots are well placed and the feel of what life is like in Belgium where it takes place comes through clearly. The acting, while in a language different than mine, is so well done that you sense every nuance each actor is trying to explore and offer each viewer. The story is one that draws you in from the start but slowly unravels to reveal all the secrets that began 20 years ago.

Midway through the film a flashback sequence relates just what it was that happened back when. It is painful to watch and chilling as well. To say that what happened will be something that sticks with all the characters involved is to simplify it. If you are at all squeamish it will bother you, not because of the visuals (which are nearly non-existent) but because your mind can create something worse than they could have shown.

Foreign films get a bad rep with the casual moviegoer. This is sad because stories can be the same all over the world, giving us things to contemplate and enjoy. If you love movies, get over the idea that you have to read the film and notice that you're getting the visual as well. Truth be told when you witness a foreign film you probably pay more attention because of the sub titles. You have to focus on the screen and not let yourself be distracted by texts, crying babies or someone who wants to talk during the movie. If you've never tried watching a foreign film then give this one a chance. You'll find its more enjoyable than you would think.",1344470400,3,2707,4.482758620689655

It's an interesting movie, if only for the twist, but I felt it wasn't expanded upon enough. It could have been better.

5060788,5,B0077E8RFC,"The powerful Belgian film Bullhead received a well-deserved nomination for Bet Foreign Film. Ostensibly about the Belgian underworld, specifically its involvement in the distribution of illegal growth hormones for livestock, the film is much more than just a gangster opus. The film has a number of violent scenes, one involving the main character's traumatic childhood experience that is, quite literally, almost unwatchable. yet this scene is absolutely essential to understand the development (both physical and emotional) of Jacky, the main character. The obvious parallel - that Jacky too must take hormones, and does so to excess - is only one if the subtexts of this unforgettable film. In the role of Jacky as an adult, Matthias Schoenaerts gives and absolutely stunning performance. He is an animal in both the physical sense (the hormones have, in a sense, ""made"" him into a bull) and an emotional sense (his desire for love but his inability to give or take it). Like some of his famous predecessors (for example, De Niro in Raging Bull and Bale in The Mechanic and Fighter), Schoenaerts physically transformed himself into the bulked-up protagonist. But, as with De Niro and Bale, his performance goes far deeper than the physical transformation - his eyes are dead, and you feel as if he has lost his sold as a result of that childhood trauma. The tragedy is that through no fault of his own he has become the man he is today, heading toward what basically is his inevitable destiny. It is a haunting performance, and you'll want to also check out the interview with Schoenaerts to see how he physically and emotionally prepared for the role.

5060790,3,B0077E8RFC,"After seeing the trailer I was anticipating this film like no other. I'm well versed in foreign cinema, but I haven't seen that many modern films from Belgium. I had heard mixed reviews which is usually a good sign, by that I mean the art crowd may applaud it, while the mainstream crowd may detest it. I like to think I'm somewhere in between the art and mainstream crowd.

From the very beginning the lead actor is absolutely mesmerizing. His mannerisms, physical appearance, and the way in which he seems to chew liquid is astounding and a sight to behold. However, here in lies the problem with the film. Instead of focusing the film on the main lead and creating a film that's an absolute character study, the film is muddled with too many side characters, too many plots and too many scenes without the main character. The film is like a hybrid between a character a study and a police procedural, except the character study far outweighs the other in both meaning and content. Had the writer/director focused more on the incredible lead character and cut the fat off of other characters, I imagine the film would have been much better.

In the end, Bullhead is still a good movie. The cinematography is solid, as well as the acting. No other actor comes close to the lead, and you begin to cherish every scene he is in, and grow tired of those he's not. There's nothing groundbreaking about the story, and it's often weighed down by unnecessary scenes/side plots. Still, the film has a lot of original elements, and is worth seeing once.

If the success of the Academy Award nomination for Bullhead can help shed light on the Belgium film industry, I will anticipate what their filmmakers can come out with next.",1341273600,3,1719,4.6480263157894735

theres alot of gr8 scenery shots here and gr8 camera work. off focus shots and run on shots are almost artistic. some scenes can be a little disturbing like the scene of a real bull giving birth (getting its stomach cut to take out the baby) cant fake that, and another scene where theres a porn scene shown on tv for about 5 sec(most i ever seen a movie show). there are times where i felt the way jackie felt. most of the time he's trying to win the affections of an old childhood crush, but at the same time holds back because of his past. characters like gosling in 'drive' and hardy in 'bronson' are almost similar to jackie in this film. if you enjoyed their characters, bullhead will win u over if u give it a chance. might take at least 2 viewings to fully get the film.",1340841600,3,1322,4.127906976744186

Nominated this past year for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (from Belgium), BULLHEAD centers around a brutish cattle farmer (Matthias Schoenaerts), reliant on steroids and hormones, whose dark past comes back to slam him in the face when he begins negotiating a crooked deal with a notorious Mafia boss.  The murder of a cop, and the farmer's sudden need for revenge against those who wronged him long ago, catapult events to a shocking finish.

Directed by Michael R. Roskam, BULLHEAD is a compelling drama with several surprising twists and a couple of disturbing scenes. Schoenaerts delivers a haunting performance as the tortured hero whose life was destroyed in childhood, and the rest of the cast is also excellent.

The picture is in Dutch and French with English subtitles.

The DVD from Image Entertainment is filled with extras, including a ""Making of"" featurette, interviews with director Roskam and Schoenaerts and an early short film by Roskam,  The set also includes a special collector's booklet with an introduction by director Michael Mann.
