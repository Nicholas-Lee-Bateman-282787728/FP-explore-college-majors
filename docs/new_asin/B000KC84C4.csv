8155493,5,B000KC84C4,Great quality and perfect for anyone wanting to learn some good basic self defense.,1455667200,,83,5.0

8155495,5,B000KC84C4,"Basically there are four instructions showing how they would respond to different situations using their specific martial/combative systems. The combatants are as follows: 1) a Kali combatant (whose responses are, honestly, not really practical from both a legal and applicative perspective. Legally I doubt the knife techniques he shows would stand up well in a court of law; while from an applications angle one would need to be seriously good to apply them). 2: A Krav Maga Kravist (good techniques that can work well in many cases). 3) A Wing Chun artist (nice chap and the techniques are good, and more importantly he tries to be realistic and, compared to the Kali chap, sane). 4) A guy who made his own style called FAST (this guy alone is worth the price of the DVD since he addresses an often overlooked part of self-defense, which is how to deal with the huge surge of adrenalin that comes with a confrontation).
I highly recommend the DVD.",1334534400,4,950,4.798780487804878
8155496,5,B000KC84C4,"I liked this dvd because it took different situations and showed how to defend four different ways. No one style is better, they were just different",1269475200,,148,4.730769230769231
8155497,5,B000KC84C4,Extreme self defense is the perfect title for this DVD.  I have never learned so much in so many varying ways of defense in one sitting that I have with this DVD.  The Israeli Krav Maga style is devistating and it is one of the reasons why they do so well every year in the championships.  I recommend this for all those who are concerned with self defense.,1246320000,,357,4.220588235294118
8155498,4,B000KC84C4,"The concept is cool w/ 4 different styles doing demo's against the same attacks. Each brought an interesting angle to the picture. I like how Bill Kipp added the psychological aspects into play but the high point was Tuhon Leo Gaje(Pekiti Tirsia Kali).

Out of all the styles shown, Kali was the truest to combat form. It is a military art and it shows. True combat has no rules or limitations. He shows this by demonstrating how all the movement in Kali is based on the blade. We cannot truly know what a confrontation will bring but most assaults have involved weapons. While most of the techniques shown by the others were good, Tuhon Gaje tried to show just how ""extreme"" combat can be, which i think was the whole point of the DVD.

Also, there is some good bonus material by all of them.",1225756800,2,793,4.462068965517242
8155499,3,B000KC84C4,"The DVD is worth buying for Bill Kipp's segment alone (which I would rate as at least four, if not five stars.  Mr. Kipp's segment has techniques that are ""believable"" and could be performed by most people without years of practice.  I liked certain aspects of other segments of the DVD but found them to be too complicated to execute if your not interested in martial arts.",1224806400,,374,4.567164179104478
8155500,3,B000KC84C4,"If someone edited out everything except Bill Kipp's FAST Defense stuff, maybe I would given this 5 stars.  Although the production value is high, and the overall premise (let's see how 4 different styles deal with the same set of attacks) is pretty good, some of the attacks are hokey at best.  Some of the voice over ""facts"" are somebody's strong, yet unbacked up opinions at best.

The Combat Krav Maga is Ok, but some things seems didn't strike me as being highly effective for ordinary citizens with little or no athletic skills.  The guy is a military monster... of coarse it works for him.  Decent though.

The Wing Chun stuff was a step below the Krav Maga, and way below Bill Kipp's FAST Defense stuff.  The guy hits so fast and repeatedly to the face with his fist, that the speed takes away from the power.  And, if he did have enough power at each punch, he would be likely to bust his hand on the guys jaw bone.  I did like some of the guy's practical (just give him your wallet and don't fight it) stuff, but his fighting moves didn't seem heavy-duty and crude enough to work in the savageness of real fighting.

The Kali knife fighter old man was a COMPLETE AND TOTAL JOKE!  This guy actually advises and shows you how to murder someone if they throw a punch at you or point their finger in your face.  How irresponsible and stupid of him.  He slices and stabs other people for simple assault threats.  That's murder buddy... good luck spending the rest of your life in prison!  Otherwise, he spends most of his time wrapping this poor dude up into a pretzel.  The joint locks and holds are so complex and detailed, not even he can remember and explain what he did just a second ago.  This guy, and his system are complete junk for citizen self-defense.

Now, Bill Kipp's FAST Defense.  This was worth the price of the DVD alone.  I wish the whole thing was of Bill's stuff.  All the other guys wasted my time.  At least they served to highlight crappy martial arts trying to be self-defense against the EFFECTIVE self-defense of FAST Defense.  Bill's advice is dead-on solid, and his physical movements are simple and effective.  Even overweight grandmom can do this stuff!  Very pragmatic and responsible advice and moves.

As the founder and senior professor of VITAL Self-Defense, and the co-host of the Self-Defense Show podcast, I feel I have a degree of expertise that allows me to comment on this DVD with some merit.

Bottom Line: Buy this DVD for Bill Kipp's FAST Defense, but use the DVD's menu to only play his stuff, and skip the other ones... they are pretty much crap.  (Maybe watch the Krav Maga if you really want to)",1185494400,10,2648,4.517894736842106
