6069311,3,B00GB0ORJ8,"Frankly speaking, I thought a movie with this subject matter would be much funnier and would be a lot more witty. This movie focuses on three popular high school girls from different cliques vying for the title of Prom Queen, and in order to win, who all go after the biggest accessory trending, a G.B.F., or Gay Best Friend.  The subject matter would lend itself to a witty and hysterical film, however it seems that this movie misses the point all-together and instead we get a largely watered down script with hammy dialogue and rather predictable jokes.  The actors are all well cast but are given almost nothing to do.

Considering this is from the writer of ""Jawbreakers"" I am very disappointed in the overall  quality of the script...",1391472000,2,741,4.72093023255814

This is a comedy that takes you back to the 16 candles John Hughes days when smart comedies were around that you loved to watch but can't find anymore. The casting was so spot on attractive people with real problems done in a satirical way that does not dumb down the audience.  A real gay comedy that is big budget not cheap looking and has some nice messages.

6069384,5,B00GB0ORJ8,"Just finished watching ""GBF"" released by Vertical Entertainment.
For those readers who might not have any idea what ""GBF"" stands for - it means ""Gay Best Friend.""
""GBF"" is a wicked little comedy about social status in high school and how far three girls will go to obatin the brass ring in order to be the QUEEN of the social order.
But lurking underneath of the facades that Fawcett, Caprice, and Shely present to the enclosed little world of their high school are real young girls who are struggling with their own secrets, fearful that if they make the wrong step, or show just how smart that they are, that they will be ostricized by their peers.
Into this mix is Tanner and Brent, best friends and equally closeted young men.  Brent has decided to come out of the closet by announcing he's gay in order to become the social accessory of the queens of the cliche.  Only Brent accidetnly sets Tanner up to be outed and is jealous when Tanner becomes the most popular guy in school over night.
Perhaps one of the most comical scenes in this movie is when Brent and his Mom are having a """"movie"" night and are watching ""Brokeback Mountain.
Everyone grows in this movie and come while the applecart does get upset, it rightens itself and everyone is more comfortable with theimselves in the end, and they are no longer hiding.
A fun movie.
Highly Recommended!

6069401,4,B00GB0ORJ8,"So here I was thinking that this would be some puffy, bubblegum cute kind of predictable movie. I was right and loved every minute of it! Sometimes you just need to shut down the brain and have a few laughs. 2 friends, both gay, one wants to come out and the other doesn't so what happens when the reverse happens...here is that story. On top of that, you have the girls from the top clicks in school who all want that very trendy ""GBF"" (gay best friend). The 2 boys in question are perfect, the girls are perfect and my favorite has to be Megan Mullaley as Brent's mother, he thinks she doesn't know...but she does. The movie night is very funny. Michael J. Willet is terrific as Tanner. There are the usual lessons and everyone learns them but really just have some good times with the wit. Definitely not cerebral and there is a kiss between Brent and Tanner if that bothers you, otherwise it is a lot of fun.",1417305600,,912,4.3391812865497075

6069432,1,B00GB0ORJ8,Oh! Here we go again. Another gay movie about  same sex partners being  not allowed to go to the Prom. We have seen it all before. This film does have a young and enthusiastic cast and there  are  good performances  from most of them.  There are the usual problems with the  script. Many of the cast look too old to  be  students at  High School. There are  also the usual  clichs with the casting. Have one Asian and one African-American  in the  main cast  just to satisfy  people who think that  there are too many  Caucasians  and not enough  coloured people. Why weren't there more. varied  races in the cast? Let's face it . Do Caucasians make up the majority of  students in  High Schools in Los Angeles? A more multi-racial and  coloured cast  would seem more natural. The casting in the film truly discriminates in this respect. Everyone on the cast are good looking  and look like they come from  wealthy families. Not a true  representation of  the  American population. If this were a British film  then it would have been  more realistic. This film is  just a fluffy  fantasy .,1405296000,,1090,4.505208333333333
6069433,5,B00GB0ORJ8,"I loved the film just like an old John Hughes film.  Very entertaining, a feel good ending.  I would buy again.  This is not ""to Kill a Mockingbird"" for drama but it is a good entertainment.  I'm going to show my adult daughter and the grandkids.  It is good for teaching to accept and love yourself for being yourself.",1403740800,,319,4.338983050847458
6069434,4,B00GB0ORJ8,"Such a fun and funny movie ! Loved it. Actors were really talented and very good looking. Especially the male ones ;) Wonderful jokes and a great story line. The movie's message really came across and is so intelligently awesome!
So why did I only give 4 stars then?! Because I USED to be a mormon (I am gay), and even though I am not a member anymore, I still feel like to defend the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints. The movie gives a totally wrong impression on the church's stand on gays and the whole ""love your neighbour"" - acpect. Even though they are really conservative, they still love and respect everyone no matter what sexuality they have and what they eat or drink. So one star less, because the producers didn't do a good research-job on the mormons' tolerance.
But still 4 STARS, because it was sooooooo hiliarious and super funny. And a great movie for both straights and gays :D Sexy and funny !!!!",1403568000,,927,4.458823529411765
6069435,4,B00GB0ORJ8,"Reminded me of the great teen flicks of the 80's and 90's.  This cast and crew showed up to make a good film.  So rare to see a good film in this sub genre, but on occasion we get a little gem like this.",1403395200,,203,3.590909090909091

6069442,2,B00GB0ORJ8,"On the positive side a lot of money, time and effort have gone into this production. Quite a polished performance by one and all  on both sides of the camera, particularly the costume and make-up departments. The plot is fairly run of the mill teenager bitchy campy gay type stuff you will have heard a million times over in any teenager fluff film. I endured watching most of it with a 14 year old niece who found it funny so I suppose the production company hit the mark there. I think the over the top campy brother of Ugly Betty is the star  and if he isn't he could be.

On the negative side  if you have a grey hair on your head or a brain that works then you would be advised to remain clear of this. It is not for anyone outside the very narrow world of teenagers. Rich teenagers. Rich spoilt obnoxious girly teenagers and standard campy gay teenagers. Im surprised that the characters aren't wearing boards around their necks stating Idiot one Clever one racist one or closeted one just in case the audience gets a bit confused. They do dress them differently so you can tell them apart.

You could endure it if you don't pay for it and you really have nothing else to watch. There are quite a few gay themed serious films which fall flat as well.",1399593600,,1256,4.327659574468085
6069443,2,B00GB0ORJ8,"This movie has a few isolated good moments, but it's mostly an unfunny and painfully predictable comedy about gay teen angst.

It will appeal mainly to very young people who are very much like the characters in it - silly, bitchy, superficial and not overburdened with intelligence - or to older people and others who wish they WERE like those characters (I assume its writer and director are in that group).

It does NOT have the more universal appeal of a genuinely great movie like Clueless, to which some reviewers have compared it. And it definitely is NOT one of the best gay movies ever made.

So if you're an insecure gay teen and wish more than anything that you were popular, or if you find such characters appealing, you may love this movie; but if you're older and have wider interests you'll probably be as bored by it as I was.

6069444,4,B00GB0ORJ8,"Yes another gay comedy from America and it is actually rather good. Meet Tanner (Michael J. Willet) he is in the closet as is his best mate Brent Van Camp (Paul Iacono). They are students at North Gateway High - the only school in America that does not have an `out' gay. This poses a problem for the fashionista Queen biatches who rule the school and who have all learnt that the latest must have fashion accessory and statement of social coolness is a G.B.F. Yes a gay best friend.

As luck would have it the new `Guydar' app is not too far away and as well as helping guys hook up it also allows GBF recruiters to track down their nearest potential recruit. Well as you can guess it is not long before Tanner is outed but with consequences both expected - such as homophobia and unexpected - a totally new cool bunch of friends. And I am glad to say hilarity does ensue.

This also tries to take some issues seriously that includes stereotypes, fashion slaves, faith and friendship. The laughs are not constant but there is more than enough to keep your interest. Everyone does a good job in the acting department and Brent's mum is played beautifully by Megan Mullally (`Will and Grace and `30 Rock'). There is no bedroom stuff to worry about and it runs for just over an hour and a half. This is light hearted fun that will not reveal anything new but should raise a smile - recommended.",1398902400,6,1392,4.412451361867705

However, it does of heart and the fact that it doesn't take itself to seriously makes it fun to watch! Their are some really fun cameos that genre fans will pick up on. When I was in High School the movie ""Jawbreaker"" came out and was panned by critics. That did not stop me and my friends from obsessing over every campy line in the movie. Not only do the two films share a director but they also share the same teen flick spirit! I'm sure that their are many teenagers in my town that go to the same performing arts school I went to that are obsessing over this movie. They are going to like it because it's relevant. I actually came out because it made me popular...even though I was actually gay, so I guess I like it becauses it's nostalgic. I really enjoyed the costumes and wardrobe. They were current yet exaggerated and great to watch! Because that's what I do I guess I have an eye for that. But every viewer will enjoy the colors and silhouettes even if they don't realize it!

6069469,5,B00GB0ORJ8,"I enjoy light comedies and gay indie films, but lower my expectations a little when it comes to teen comedies, so I was absolutely delighted that the screenwriter, director, and cast hit this out of the park.

I actually turned the closed captioning on so I wouldn't miss a word of the fast-paced banter and all the crazy-fun slang words. The script and actors bring nuance to characters that are often otherwise just stereotypes.

There are so many hilarious lines and scenes, but perhaps the best was when one of the just-out gay teens sits down with his overcaring Mom (played flawlessly by Megan Mullally, Karen from ""Will and Grace""), who's rented a bunch of the most inappropriate gay movies to watch while newly out and/or with your mom (""Milk,"" ""Boys Don't Cry,"" ""Shortbus,"" and ""Brokeback Mountain""), as evidenced by the numerous outtakes played over the end credits where the actor playing opposite Megan can't stop bursting out laughing at Megan's deadpan reaction commentary to the sex scene in Brokeback.

One of the best gay indie comedies I've ever seen, and if I knew any gay teens I'd buy them a copy -- while a farce, there's a lot of good stuff about self-identity and self esteem (but never devolving into preaching) in this R-rated comedy. If you enjoy light comedies, give this one a try.",1394755200,,1310,4.787610619469026
6069470,4,B00GB0ORJ8,"This movie is surprisingly fun and clever, with a new twist to the discussion about homosexuality: as it has become more accepted, have homosexuals become objectified? Is the ""gay best friend"" the latest trend?

Unfortunately, the writers took the easy road in attaching fundamental religious a bit too vigorously, including many factual inaccuracies about Mormons.

While this movie does go over the top too often, it is largely an enjoyable ride.",1394668800,,448,5.295774647887324
6069471,5,B00GB0ORJ8,"We were doing comedy night and were very surprised...this is a good movie. It offers more than just a teen flick, enjoy for what it is.",1394582400,,135,4.230769230769231
6069472,4,B00GB0ORJ8,"I don't usually enjoy movies with a bunch and about teeny boopers, however I found this very entertaining. I found the portrayal of the Mormon kids a bit of stretch, but I did have some friends I used to hang out with that were a lot like Slay's boyfriend.",1394496000,2,256,4.244897959183674
6069473,5,B00GB0ORJ8,Very enjoyable. Good comedy with a great message. Would have loved to see in the movie theatre but not shown in Boston yet!!,1394496000,,124,4.434782608695652
6069474,5,B00GB0ORJ8,Love it!!! Laughed the whole time!  It manages to offend pretty much everyone and still be hilarious. That's a fine art!,1394409600,,120,4.714285714285714
6069475,5,B00GB0ORJ8,The critics were right: it's definitely like a modern day Clueless. It was adorable and fabulous and laugh-out-loud hilarious. I loved it!,1393718400,,138,5.318181818181818
6069486,4,B00GB0ORJ8,This is a great afternoon watch.  There isn't anything ground breaking about this - but is has some great lines - a cute cast - and it's a fun watch.,1393632000,,149,3.966666666666667
6069487,5,B00GB0ORJ8,Finally a gay themed movie that doesn't leave you depressed at the end.  It was a funny fun film to watch,1393632000,,105,4.0

6069489,5,B00GB0ORJ8,The movie was hilarious and was really kool that they did an LGBT movie. I would love to see more movies like this.,1393200000,,115,4.043478260869565
6069490,5,B00GB0ORJ8,"This movie was downright HILARIOUS!!!! It is like the gay version of Mean Girls. If you are looking for a movie to watch with your girlfriends, GBF, or Bf this comedy should be your first pick!!",1393113600,,194,4.416666666666667
6069491,5,B00GB0ORJ8,"No one is going to go into this looking for the next Oscar worthy performance, but in the likes of ""She's the Man"" and ""Easy A"", ""GBF provides an incredibly fun, and devilishly campy, romp through the eyes of a snarky young man as he navigates the crazy and often times hilarious bumps of high school, while battling the social classes. The catch with this particular movie, is that instead of a quirky, upbeat female lead, we are introduce to a gay male instead; which was enough for me pick it up in a heartbeat.

The best part about the movie is that it doesn't try too hard to be something it's not, and what it does try to be, it flawlessly achieves. too often gays are relegated to the sidelines as the sassy coworkers/friends of the female lead, or a completely tragic asexual character. However you feel about cliche over exaggerated high school movies, one cannot deny that it is refreshing to see a young gay male in a movie act...well...normal?

Without getting too winded, I will just say that I loved watching this movie and feeling like I could easily classify it with the likes of ""Mean Girls"" ""Clueless"" ""Bring it On"" and all those other really fun chick flicks.",1392854400,,1178,4.55188679245283
6069492,2,B00GB0ORJ8,"NOT at all as funny as it appears to be. Bad acting, painful to watch at times! Don't waste you time and money on this one!",1392768000,2,123,3.769230769230769
6069493,5,B00GB0ORJ8,"I had no idea this movie existed until I ran across it during a recent Amazon k-hole.  I added it to my watchlist and streamed it the day it was available.

If you ask me for criticisms of the movie I could go on for days.  The acting is okay but not awesome.  The story is shallow and predictable with weird developments that may have been the result of less than stellar editing.  The characters are thin and one-dimensional.  The portrayals of gays, Mormons, blacks, and every minority group are stereotypical to the point of being offensive.  The make-up artists did a horrible job trying to make these characters look like high school students (the girls were crusty and one of the boys was dolled up like Jerri Blank from Strangers With Candy).  The list could go on.  So I can't figure out why this movie worked, but it is definitely one of the most adorable movies I have seen in a long time.

There are great one-liners.  The scene with Megan Mullally watching and commenting on Broke Back Mountain is one of the best.  ""Oh, Heath, it's freezing.  Swallow your pride and go in the tent.  Well, I guess necessity is the mother of invention.""

Ultimately, my advice is WATCH THIS MOVIE!  You probably won't find anything redeeming in it, but you will definitely enjoy it.",1392768000,5,1278,4.563876651982379

6069495,2,B00GB0ORJ8,"It had dead air awkward moments and it wasn't as funny as the previews made it out to be, the gbf was super annoying and whoever was in charge of makeup needs to be burned alive. Or was this a low budget film",1392681600,,208,3.86046511627907
6069526,5,B00GB0ORJ8,"This is one of the best movies ever in my opinion.  I never understood the whole obsession with Mean Girls, I enjoyed the film but never to the extent of seemingly everyone else, so it might just be my opinion but this is so much better.  Better than Clueless in my opinion as well.  Watching the trailer I was nervous because it looked like it was going to promote a lot of stereotypes, but in fact it only promotes the fact that not everyone is the same, and even though that's the case we all deserve to be equal. Love this movie, hilarious, sweet, and inspiring. A++, it's exactly what the youth of america needs to see, that acceptance is the answer and ignorance gets you nowhere.",1392508800,,686,4.3858267716535435
6069527,5,B00GB0ORJ8,"I expected so much from this movie with all the good reviews out there! And most of us had to wait almost a year to get to see the movie, but it's really worth it once you see it.
""GBF"" becomes an instant teen classic like Mean Girls and Clueless (like it says on the cover), the script is full of awesome lines that will become as classic as the ones from the two teen classics I mentioned. The cast is really great, everyone plays well their role, and even if it GBF becomes goofy at times, they know how to be sensitive to all the gay kids that are out there, this movie is just more than just stereotypes (the film has the typical high school kids: the popular girls, the non-popular kids, the outsiders, the homophobes...), it's about accepting yourself! Although it's a little predictable, the movie still makes you laugh with so many pop culture mentions, and probably if you're only a teen/young adult you will understand the jokes of the movies.
I honestly don't care about the clothes the characters wear on a movie or TV shows, but the clothes worn on GBF are awesome; everybody's outfits are great, and I bet they will become as classic as the ones from Clueless! Darren Stein directed an amazing film, and it's really worth all the wait. Even straight people will enjoy it! Give it a try without judging it! I had a great time and I see myself watching it over and over again.",1392422400,5,1389,4.408560311284047
6069528,5,B00GB0ORJ8,I am a 19 year old gay boy so anything gay is of course going to attract my attention. I thought this looked like some under the budget film made that you would see in the 5 dollar bin at wal-mart or something. I was so surprised by how much I actually fell in love with the movie. The movie plays out like a mean girls more centered on Damian instead of Cady. It's funny and perfect for gay and straight people.

6069534,4,B00GB0ORJ8,"GBF stands for 'Gay Best Friend', and among the girls at the seemingly affluent suburbanesque high school featured in this movie, a GBF is the 'new fashion accessory.' Three of them all vie for the attentions of newly outed Tanner, while his also gay friend Brent, initially stays in the closet, but eventually comes out himself and becomes a semi-rival. This film pokes fun at every high school stereotype, and in that sense may offend some, as it is a kind of post-politically-correct that seems to have become fashionable lately. It's mostly trite fun, but because of the subject matter, does become heartfelt and carries that off well enough. It's good-hearted and cute.",1391644800,2,674,4.9734513274336285
