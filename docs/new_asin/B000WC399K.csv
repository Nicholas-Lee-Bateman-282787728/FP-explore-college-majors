8222518,2,B000WC399K,"I watched this movie in hopes of understanding the Cuban slavery revolt.  The presentation is focused on the beautiful Cecilia, a beautiful mulatto, sought by various white men (mainly as a mistress) and mulatto men as well.  Cecilia is determined to marry a white man and she finds that possibility in Leonardio (the young son of a extremely wealthy plantation owner).

The Pimentia is a mulatto, who truly loves Cecilia (flaws and all) and is the leader in the planning of the rebellion.  He uses Cecilia to deliver a message.  Unfortunately, neither know that it is discovered and that the Cuban leadership knows the critical details for revolt.  As a result, there is much bloodshed of all participants.

My problem is that the acting by Cecilia, Leonardio and several other main characters are exceedingly poor to the point of ruining the scenes.  Cecilia's very light but the make-up to make her lighter is poor and she is much to old (mid 30's) to be an attractive partner to a teenage young man.  Likewise, Leonardio's make-up is so overdone in an attempt to make him a very light Caucasian, he appears as a vampire!  Additionally, when scenes show his neck and chest exposed, he is much darker and the make-up ends at the top of the neck (and he is never seen wearing a hat to protect from the harsh equatorial sun).  Several other people have similar make-up dysfunction.

The storyline didn't really mesh either.  Cecilia's part in the rebellion other than her delivering the message really isn't strategic or important to the history of rebellion (in fact, it is secondary to the love story).

I love history and historical fiction.  This film failed to convey the story in an accurate or intriguing matter. Adding to this that most of the acting was the caliber of a small-town, community production, it ran out of gas way before it finished.  It was made in 1980, so I understand that the level of sophistication wasn't up to today's standards or that it was done on a small budget wasn't really an issue for me.  In fact, the plantation scenery was beautiful (not the slavery, of course), though most of sets were obviously created. A better written script is essential to a good movie.

If you must find a DVD on Cuban history, this shouldn't be your first choice.",1385251200,,2280,4.729113924050633
