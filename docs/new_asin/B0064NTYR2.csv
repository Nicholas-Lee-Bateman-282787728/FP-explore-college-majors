8492665,5,B0064NTYR2,"This is a vivid and wonderful documentary about the early days of Nebraska football. Not many people know that before they were the Cornhuskers, the Nebraska football team went by various other nicknames, including bugeaters. The movie uses actors to recreate games, people, and events from the past. The 65 minute running time flies by fast; interspersed are informative interviews with Nebraska football historians, including Mike Babcock. A must see for any football fan.",1351987200,,474,5.418918918918919
8492666,5,B0064NTYR2,This film was very entertaining and informative. I especially enjoyed the music and game recreations. A lot of the information about Dr. George Flippin had me reeling. The Kansas coach played by Keith Homan was hillarious. I highly recommend this movie!,1346025600,,253,5.195121951219512
