1432720,5,B00005JKL8,"Behind Enemy Lines is an awesome war/action film! Its a great film period! Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman are a great team/cast for this movie! They are both awesome actors! This film had a good plot! This film ,while watching it, makes you feel like you are there. All through the movie you are rigth there with Burnett(Wilson) feeling his pain,joy,ect.and also Admiral Reigart's(Hackman).Tracker(Maskov) was also a good actor as the ""bad guy"".The graphics in this movie were totaly awesome!! I watched this in theaters 5 times and am in the process of buying it! I mean its just nonstop action! And fun! Personally I give this film 5 stars. Actors-great! Plot-great! Graphics-Great! Ect.-Great!
P.S. Owen Wilson is cute!",1012089600,5,720,5.0588235294117645
1432721,5,B00005JKL8,"While I am no qualified movie critic, I felt compelled to write on this one. Things that appealed to me were that we place too much trust as a country in politicians and that Gene Hackman's character was willing to place his career on the line to save one of his men.  In today's military, I believe the serviceman justifiably don't have faith to be saved, esp. if it is not politically expedient.  Remember Somalia.  It is so sad to realize the again that politics plays such a role in the waste of the lives of our fathers, brothers and sons. It was awesome to realize this was based on a true story.",1011484800,6,602,4.3097345132743365

1432853,3,B00005JKL8,I have to admit that the casting of Owen Wilson as the lead in this.  I thought was an odd choice.  They could have have gotten a lot of actors for that role that would have been better then him.  I always think of him as being this goofy character like in Wedding Crashers.  But he is very good in this.  This was my favorite role of his.  Until a few years ago when I thought he was even better in No Escape.  He is very good in action movies.  He plays a  U.S.  Pilot  who gets shot down in Bosnia.  Then watches his co-pilot get executed and is on the run until he can get rescued.  Gene Hackman is his Commanding Officer who goes to all stops to get him rescued.  Including going against orders.  When it seems like everybody just thinks the Pilot is expendable.,1478217600,,767,4.122448979591836

My wife is not a fan of Owen Wilson or Gene Hackman, but watched it with fascination if, at first, reluctance.

This film demonstrates the folly of allowing other or United Nations to control our military personnel.  It is also a tale of both loyalty and betrayal on several levels, from personal to international.",1467676800,,571,4.927083333333333

1433331,4,B00005JKL8,"This is a movie of metaphorical flip-flops.  Maybe they aren't so metaphorical as one might think if you don't know some of the backgrounds of the actors.

Owen Wilson plays Navy LT Chris Burnett, an F-16 Super Hornet pilot is shot down in Bosnia.  Gene Hackman, his commanding officer directs him to a safe area for extraction.  Thirteen years earlier Hackman, playing an Air Force pilot, was in the same predicament when he was shot down in an EB-66 over North Vietnam.

There are some rather awesome shipboard scenes which are definitely far more realistic than this ""based on a true story"" movie.  Hackman and Wilson make for a good team.  This was one movie Owen Wilson did that wasn't that bad.",1422316800,2,700,4.688524590163935

1433333,5,B00005JKL8,"BEHIND ENEMY LINES looks as though it was made with all good intentions. I really wanted to like and enjoy it. Because the character motivations were never deeply explored it lacked the essence of what could have made it a good old fashioned stand-up-and-cheer movie. It moved at a lethargic pace. If the character motivations were explored in depth, lethargy would have been replaced with viewer concern and interest and it would have been a much more entertaining film. Only the confrontation between Joaquim de Almeida as Admiral Piquet and Gene Hackman as Admiral Reigart gave this film some character based emotional fiber and substance that it sorely needed. I also thought this made the Hollywood theatrics at the end of the movie were just too unbelievable and out of place. Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman and David Keith do their best with what script they are given. Actualy Joaquim de Almeida, a very underated actor, came out the most memorable and believable.",1421625600,,967,4.9753086419753085

But the film presents itself as being a quasi-historical account, and they are not even close: About the only thing the real event had in common with the Hollywood account is that a plane was shot down in Bosnia. The rest was make-believe. The language in the mouth of Owen Wilson was so awful that the real pilot ended up suing the producers for defamation of character (settled out of court). The technical details are also glaringly off: the pilot says he ejected at Mach 3. There is no navy fighter jet in the US arsenal capable of mach 3 (top speed of the f-18 is mach 1.8). So Hollywood cons us again. Oh, and the Muslims are our friends in this one--Isn't that nice?",1419206400,,909,4.515151515151516

A score of four should for movies that, although not great, are solidly good and have moments of greatness. BEL had no moments of greatness, but did have a rather weak and predictable plot.

1433643,5,B00005JKL8,"BEHIND ENEMY LINES looks as though it was made with all good intentions. I really wanted to like and enjoy it. Because the character motivations were never deeply explored it lacked the essence of what could have made it a good old fashioned stand-up-and-cheer movie. It moved at a lethargic pace. If the character motivations were explored in depth, lethargy would have been replaced with viewer concern and interest and it would have been a much more entertaining film. Only the confrontation between Joaquim de Almeida as Admiral Piquet and Gene Hackman as Admiral Reigart gave this film some character based emotional fiber and substance that it sorely needed. I also thought this made the Hollywood theatrics at the end of the movie were just too unbelievable and out of place. Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman and David Keith do their best with what script they are given. Actualy Joaquim de Almeida, a very underated actor, came out the most memorable and believable. I found THE THIN RED LINE to be a deep film, very ethereal in nature and liberating as it is disturbing. Director Terrence Malick focuses on the conflict at Guadalcanal from ground up and showing empathy and apathy along the way. Nick Nolte's performance as an over the hill Lieutenant Colonel trying to impress a very shallow and aloof Brigadier Geneneral (John Travolta) is moving. THE THIN RED LINE is a devastating film.",1380240000,,1392,4.927659574468085

What a waste of time

Nice premise - 4 Seals jump out of plane for a mission
Before the rest of the team can jump, the mission is aborted
So these 4 guys are left on their own

Could have been great

1433801,3,B00005JKL8,"There is something about `Behind Enemy Lines' that feels slightly off from intention, and I'm struggling to put my finger on it.  From a technical standpoint the film is very well done, and despite some unrealistic moments, the script is also well thought out and nicely handled by director John Moore.  The action sequences have a nice balance of gloss and grit to create a realistic yet entertaining effect, and even the acting is nicely done.  Owen Wilson is not the type of actor you'd initially attribute to `serious cinema', especially since he can't seem to do anything but mug the camera for laughs (he often seems so insincere to me, which occasionally works, like in 'Zoolander' where it benefited his character), but he actually does a really good job here, handling a conventional character in an unconventional way.  I think another reviewer said it best when he said that Wilson played this character like he were an average Joe; an every-man sort of man and that really plays to the advantage of the film.  And yet, with a film that is this serious in tone and subject there is something off that makes it feel cheap.  Not in that `poorly made' fashion, since it certainly isn't poorly made, and not even in that Michael Bay `dumb action movie' fashion since it isn't really dumb (except that ending, which is so banal and unrealistic I couldn't help but bow my head in my hands in surrender).  Maybe there is something about Wilson himself that is hard to take seriously, but at the end of the day there is an air of clich&eacute;d summer blockbuster syndrome that corrodes the core of this film and makes it less than desired.  It is palatable, but also a tad forgettable and when all is said and done this is not a movie that will stay with me.  This is a tricky genre with me though, and I am not ashamed to admit that I often dislike major players in this genre (I found `Saving Private Ryan' expertly directed yet fundamentally stupid, and `Black Hawk Down' is an infectiously stirring pot of empty characters) so take my review with a grain of salt.  It's just my personal perception, but there are many who feel otherwise, and you may be one of them.",1312502400,,2173,4.59173126614987

He survived for six days by eating leaves, grass and ants, and avoiding Serb patrols while trying to contact Magic, NATO's airborne command center. He evaded capture and was rescued on June 8, by U.S. Marines of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit based on the USS Kearsarge.

The film Behind Enemy Lines is loosely based on his story. Although he gave it a positive rating on the movie review television show Hot Or Not, he attempted to sue the movie company in 2002 for making the film without his permission. O'Grady authored two books along with Michael French and Jeff Coplon detailing his experiences of being shot down over Bosnia and his eventual rescue -- Return with Honor and Basher Five-Two (O'Grady's call sign).

The incident was later depicted on the documentary television program Situation Critical in episode #5 ""Downed Pilot"", and ""Escape! - Escape From Bosnia: The Scott O'Grady Story"" on the History Channel.""

1433815,5,B00005JKL8,"Behind Enemy Lines is a good action movie. The story is about a flight navigator(Owen Wilson) looking more than a usual recon pilot mission. One day while flying over a certain war torn area, his plane gets shot down and suddenly life turns upside down while he tries to get back to his ship. You'll get to see Owen Wilson perform in not the usual romantic-comedy kind of roles and Gene Hackman is at his usual best as Owen's commanding officer - dealing with politics to get Owen out of his situation. Best to watch the movie to know more.
The video quality of the Blu ray is razor sharp with a 1080p transfer. Certain scenes such as the ship's cafeteria where the pilots have their meal is pretty detailed. When the scene shifts to enemy territory, overall look is cloudy and overcast, but that does not dampen the image quality. The Audio quality is something really different. Behind Enemy Lines bluray comes with an rocking DTS HD MA 5.1 soundtrack that will definitely put your surround system to test. Whether its the flying jet scenes or the explosive rigged sequences in war torn Bosnia, the audio never lets you down. All in all, an enjoyable experience.",1277510400,12,1164,4.628019323671498
1433816,4,B00005JKL8,"For whatever reasons, the civil war in Bosnia (1992-95), and the horrific practice of ethnic cleansing, has largely slipped into the folds of history, and seems not to be mentioned much today.  Behind Enemy Lines (2001), is one of the few mainstream films set during this period of conflict.  It involves a Navy F-18 shot down while on a routine reconnaissance mission.  The film does a good job of capturing the cold pure fear of being under fire, and the shock of suddenly being blasted out of the sky, and plunging to the earth, to face a desperate fight for survival.

Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) is a flight navigator, aboard the carrier USS Carl Vinson, on patrol in the Adriatic Sea.  With two weeks to go before his tour is up, Burnett's commanding officer, Admiral Leslie Reigart (Gene Hackman), orders pilot Jeremy Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht) and Burnett on a routine patrol over Bosnia.

The F-18 enter the `no-fly' zone, and unknowingly photographs a mass grave site.  General Lokar (Olek Krupa), the local army commander, orders a missile strike, and surface to air missiles bring the Navy fighter down, deep in enemy territory.  The crew ejects, and parachutes to safety, but the enemy is close behind.  An injured Stackhouse is quickly captured, and then executed.

Free for the moment, a shaken Burnett contacts base, and then attempts to evade capture and reach his pickup point.  Scanning the countryside searching for him, are the army, and Lokar's personal expediter Sasha (Vladimir Mashkov).  Back at command, politics and red tape, get in the way of a speedy recovery.  It's a gritty and desperate journey for Lt. Burnett, who runs headlong into the results of ethnic cleansing, when he falls into a muddy mass grave.  This is the film's most poignant moment, and while the brutality and suffering of the people is certainly a part of what the film is about, it is soon overshadowed by typical Hollywood style heroics.

Under first time director John Moore, Behind Enemy Lines starts out quite strongly, establishing a tense and desperate situation, but the level of reality soon becomes a casualty of political factors on both sides.  The Bosnian army employing an assassin seems a bit much, as is their clever use of the media to misdirect the UN command.  The obstacles placed in the way of Burnett's rescue, hype up the level of drama, and eventually cause the Admiral mount up and get personally involved.  All the stops are pulled out in the final act, as any sense of realism falls away.

Burnett, who has been climbing mountains and cross-crossing the countryside, somehow has enough spring in his step to take down Sasha.  The Admiral personally leads a rescue mission, as a group of choppers come in with guns blazing to engage the enemy, while Burnett dodges fire, recovers the evidence, and makes a death defying leap for freedom.  It's spectacular, flag-waving overkill, that serves to diminish what could have been an excellent film, with an important message.

Despite the hyped up ending, Behind Enemy Lines is definitely worth seeing, for the grim realistic aspects, and an impressive gutty performance by Owen Wilson.  Gene Hackman's performance as a by the book commander, who takes matters into his own hands, is textbook Hackman, and probably exactly what the writers wanted.

The bonus features include two commentary tracks, one with director John Moore and editor Martin Smith, and a second with co-producers Wyck Godfrey and John Davis.  Between the two tracks, you get some awareness of the production issues involved in shooting on a carrier and on location, and how negotiations with the military was also factor.",1274400000,,3666,4.970491803278689

1433853,4,B00005JKL8,"Navy pilot Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) is bored out of his mind. All he ever does is run exercises or fly routine reconnaissance missions for a war he doesn't even truly understand. Until one day when he and his co-pilot, Stackhouse, are shot down by two surface-to-air missiles over Serbia. After parachuting down, Burnett begins to walk up a hill to try and get a better signal on his radio. As he nears the top of the hill, he notices that Stackhouse is being questioned by a Serbian rebel army. When the Serbs are through questioning Stackhouse, the hunt for Burnett begins. Lost in unfamiliar territory, Burnett runs for his life from the Serbs trying to get to an open area to be rescued. But what Burnett doesn't know is the politics that are being played out behind the scenes.  Because the two pilots flew into a no fly zone, the navy can not just go in and rescue their men unless they want to cause a full blown war. Hopefully Burnett will be able to survive long enough for the red tape to be cut, and the Navy can send in the marines to rescue him.

""Behind Enemy Lines"" can be way over the top, but it really brings back the memories of the good 80's action movies where you left behind your brain and loved to believe that a man in a red head band could single handedly bring down Vietnam, North Korea, or the whole darn continent of Asia if he wanted to. Or when a man with bare feet could take down a terrorist group with witty lines inside a sky scraper. Or even when the governor of California came back through time to destroy the man that would destroy the future that hasn't been created yet. Ok sure it's nowhere near as good as Rambo, Die Hard, or Terminator, but it is a lot of fun. While those movies are great, there are always parts where you can pick them apart and say ""Oh come on"". ""Behind Enemy Lines"" is filled with a lot of cool scenes, and some tense moments. From the mine field, to the fight in a war torn city (a tank inside a building blowing the crap out of things), and to the final moments with a sniper honing down upon Burnett, the movie never really lets up. There were so many things though that I could tell you was wrong, but why really? When it comes down to action films, as long as they aren't trying to be very realistic (like Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down), you just have to sit back, grab the popcorn, turn up the volume, and watch the crazy explosions, the blazing guns, and all the crazy car chase or dog fight scenes.

While I like the ""Behind Enemy Lines"", it's definitely not the best movie out there, but it is a very fun action movie. It's close to a 3.5 stars than a 4 star, but hey, I gotta help it out some. Definitely recommend for the action fans. And definitely on Blu. Heard it has incredible video and superb audio.

P.S. - Definitely the best part of the movie to me was the scene where the 2 SAMS were chasing down the F-15. That was some cool stuff there.",1243296000,3,2940,4.263440860215054

When he's being shot at hundreds of times, and goes through a minefield, he wouldn't have made it. It's called shrapnel.

Even forgetting about shrapnel, the darn explosions hit him directly half a dozen times and he keeps running.

If I can manage to find an HDMI-DVI cable that works in 1080p I might post another comment in here so stay tuned. A few scenes were awesome in high definition especially the ones where the F-18 is being pursued by a couple of SAMS (surface to air missiles.) The audio quality on the other hand was outstanding!

The scenes are so well photographed that they actually add some reality to what otherwise would be to over the top. That and Hackman's and Wilson's performances are great.

1433862,5,B00005JKL8,"Last week, including the weekend, I watched three great war action movies on television, namely:

1) 'Black Hawk Down', starring Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana;

2) 'Behind Enemy Lines', starring Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman;

3) 'Tears of the Sun', starring Bruce Willis, Monica Bellucci, Tom Skerritt;

The first movie was based on an actual event that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia on the African continent in October 1993 during the Clinton presidency.

The second movie was apparently a fictional adaptation of an actual event that supposedly took place during the Bosnia-Serbia conflict.

The third movie was more of a fictional account that had the starvation-ravaged Nigeria caught in an ethnic civil war as a background setting.

In the war action movie, 'Behind Enemy Lines', a US Navy navigator, Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) was cajoled by his commanding officer, Admiral Leslie Reigart (Gene Hackman) to take on one last reconnaisance flight from an aircraft carrier on the Adriatic Sea.

He was assigned to accompany a navy pilot, Lt. Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht), who would fly over the supposedly southern part of Bosnia. The action supposedly took place during the tail-end of the Bosnia-Serbia conflict.

The recon flight deliberately went off course, after Chris had apparently spotted something unusual on the ground. Pictures were captured by the plane's video camera, but he did not realise that there were unseen forces on the ground that did not want the world to see those pictures.

The plane was eventually shot down by a surface-to-air (SAM) missile. However, both the pilot & his navigator parachuted just in time. The extensive evasive actions by the pilot & the plane formed the initial action sequences of the movie - exciting, but somehow unbelievable.

The pilot was captured & executed on the landed spot, while Chris, who had witnessed the gruesome event, managed to escape into the woods.

The rest of the movie traced his own battle of wits as he outsmarted as well as out-manuevred his enemies on the ground to get help from his commanding officer, who unwittingly founded that his intended rescue operation was apparently hamstrung by political wrangling at the top of his chain of command.

There was this funny guy in the sports track suit who played the determined sniper, who was assigned by enemy forces to track down Chris, locate the crash site & retrieve the damaging video pictures.

It was quite fun, actually for a change, to watch Owen Wilson, with his crooked nose, playing a serious & sober character in the movie. I had seen in other movies where he was often seen to be a mischievous, playful, 'trouble maker', like in 'I Spy', 'Shanghai Noon', 'Shanghai Knights', 'Starsky & Hutch', 'Wedding Crashers', just to name a few.

Gene Hackman, one of my favourite actors, seemed to have an understated role, but I simply love his character in the movie. At the risk of his own career, he eventually took personal command & led the successful rescue attempt (""Let's go & get our boy back!""). He was ultimately relinguished of the command of the battle group, & reassigned to a desk job in Washington, but chose to retire from service, in honour of his men.

Sometimes, a man just has to do what he needs to do, even at the risk of his own personal future. To me, this is leadership, taking personal responsibility.

The final segment of the movie exhibited the spectacular rescue attempt of the downed navigator.

Our hero, during the very last few moments of being rescued, ran for cover from the blazing guns of the pursuing enemy forces, halted half-way, back-tracked, made one final attempt to search for, retrieved the video cartridge from the plane's crash site, & then leaped into the air over the cliff hanger & into the receiving arms of a marine, dangling on a tight rope from the rescue helicopter. Wow! that was really cool!

He wanted the world to see the damaging video, so that his pilot friend did not die in vain. That was his greatest defining moment in the movie, which I certainly enjoyed watching.

My end analysis: despite some minor technical flaws in the story, this is still another good war action movie to watch!

To sum up all the three war action movies in the foregoing posts, I want to take this opportunity to share with readers a dedication statement I had learned - & remembered - since my secondary school days. It came from Sir Winston Churchill, the wartime British Prime Minister:

""Never in the field of human conflict, have so many owed so much to so few.""

So, dear readers, please go & watch the three foregoing war action movies. You will be delighted.",1196121600,,4653,4.862025316455696

1433907,2,B00005JKL8,"Behind Enemy Lines brings to the screen the story of a downed US F-18 navigator who is trying to get himself rescued by friendly (to him) forces somewhere in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina in the 1990's.
The film starts off very well with a James Bondish beginning and continues so, up until about 15 minutes into the movie; from then on it's downhill all the way to the end as the propaganda kicks in.
The good things first:
1) The cinematography is AMAZING.  The way the camera rolls in and out of the scenes is highly original and highly enjoyable.  More such cinematography would be greatly appreciated.
2) The music is really good (!), adding to the overall enjoyment.
3) It provides for some GREAT scenery with snow-covered hills and mountains and great shots of cliffs and the sea.
4) The special effects are first-class.  A decent budget and professional work have produced realistic and entertaining special effects.
5) Aircraft carriers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, personnel carriers, are all there.
6) The acting is commendable.  Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman, Vladimir Mashkov and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!
On the negative side now:
1) It's the same old/usual cliches involving one of Hollywood's favorite villains/scapegoats: the Serbs  (surprisingly there were no Russians, though there was a Russian actor, or Germans in this one...).  Can we not find something more original than the USUAL crazy/deranged/dangerous Serb or Russian ""boogieman"" (or the USUAL German/Nazi ""bad guy"" cliche for that matter), together with the leading to the USUAL need to be rescued by the benevolent Anglo-Americans?  Is that too much to ask?  Why aren't the Turks or the Israelis ever the villains or even the Dutch, the Georgians or the Estonians?
2) Is there really any chance of an American Admiral going out on a limb for one man when his career is on the line, or even more important when his actions might re-ignite a war? Really!
3) What's the point of distorting the truth by demonizing the Serbs when in the War Serbs, Croats and Muslims all did what everybody does in a war?  Oh, I forgot; the Serbs have to be the baddies while the Muslims are the poor victims...  Have mercy on us, please!
4) To call the ending ""predictable"" is quite the understatement.
The point is that excluding this movie's one-sided and biased approach, allows for a very enjoyable film.
The problem is that it's that same one-sided and biased approach that prevents the thinking viewer from enjoying the show!

1433908,2,B00005JKL8,"I ask you! What US Navy pilot and navigator would stray from their assigned flight plan, especially, if it were an international no-fly zone? Answer: Not one.

If you were on the run being chased by an army trying to kill you, would you stop and sit on the concrete levee of a reservoir in plain sight? An idiot like that deserves to get killed.

What trained serviceman would come out blazing holding his firearm sideways in his hand like a drug dealer instead of with both hands and squarely in front of him? Sly Stallone, Arnold, Will Smith

Who could survive running straight back into enemy fire to retrieve a CD-ROM? Trip a maze of land minds & out run the blasts? What admiral & captain of an aircraft carrier would go along on a recsue mission? Answer: Not one

Why did the Bosnian tanks not fire at the escape helicopters? Was it just me or did some of the Bosnians look like a toy army in the final explosion?

1433909,1,B00005JKL8,"I am shocked at the star rating given to this movie. It seems most viewers based their recommendation soley on action (which wasn't great) and not a bit of facts (in which this movie was sorely lacking).

I spent two years as an aid worker in the Balkans after the Bosnian war and the NATO siege of Serbia and Kosovo. I went to see this film expecting to get at least a shred of credibility. I should have known better. What I saw, to my extreme disapointment, was the usual Hollywood pander, presenting a fictionalized account of true events as recycled media fare: the Serbs were the only bad guys, everyone else was victimized, no other ethnic group committed any war crimes. Rubbish! I worked with hundreds of Serbs were innocent victims in this tragic civil war. Outside the town where I worked in Bosnia, there was a ""concentration camp"" where Croats jailed other Croats who refused to fight against the Muslims! Does that say anything about the insanity of this war? For Hollywood to present such a stereotypical, one-sided aspect of the situation is irresponsible and poor judgement-- for some people, this may be one of the only movies they about the Bosnian war, and they will walk away thinking they know the whole story.

If you want to see an outstanding war movie as well as a more accurate representation of what happend in Bosnia, check out the movie ""Savior"" with Dennis Quaid. At least they try to present all sides of the story, rather than doing a gross injustice to a complex war as in ""Behind Enemy Lines.""",1179360000,28,1528,4.634686346863469

1433911,4,B00005JKL8,"From the very first scene you know that this film is going to showcase Owen Wilson being Owen Wilson.  I happen to enjoy his mixture of arrogant playboy with being insecure and endearing, and ever-flippant.  He mastered this in film successes like Shanghai Knights, Shanghai Noon (both with Jackie Chan), and I Spy (with Eddie Murphy).

As to whether this is ""based on a true story,"" it is true that the real U.S. F-16 pilot (Scott O'Grady) who was shot down in Bosnia in 1995, sued 20th Century Fox in 2002 for ""invasion of privacy.""  The irony to that is that his chief complaints were that they got the story wrong and portrayed him in ways that were unlike him.  Owen Wilson (named Chris Burnett in BEL) cussed throughout the film and makes a blatantly stupid decision upon being shot down.  O'Grady maintains that he did not act that way.

Aside from that reputation-protection, this film is one more great Owen Wilson flic, that will not only keep you smirking, but this one will make you feel like your finger is in a wall socket until the end.

Why not a 5 star?  Hollywood needs to learn that we viewers roll our eyes whenever they show us Mr. Hero getting shot at by a gazillion bad guys, and not one bullet hits our main man.  (To see a satirical look at the absurdity of this, see Arnold in The Last Action Hero.) BEL even has tanks shooting at our evasive star scampering away on foot.  Come on, a scratch on the cheek doesn't make those scenes realistic.  And the scene where he decides to go ahead and trip every booby-trap wire to ruin the day of his obviously-going-to-be-killed followers, was ridiculous.

Yes, the worst was the final scene.  Enemy tanks, rocket-launchers, machine guns all ablaze at goin'-Owen, and not one frickin' bullet hits him.  Ok, even if I can accept that, why did not one bullet hit the three Marine helicopters who just kept dusting the enemy chumps who were shooting away?  And his leap off the cliff (with one arm having just been shot) to grab the foot of some dangling Marine on a rope was a bit too much to believe.  And I couldn't swallow how Gene Hackman relaxed upon the ""success"" of now having their man ""safe.""  Off they fly into the sunset, with our invinsible hero, holding on for his not-bored-anymore life. Oh well, enjoy.

I agree with the reviewer who noted the poor character development of anyone but Owen Wilson.  Even Gene Hackman comes off quite wooden.  The internal military conflict comes through that guy who played the latin-lover spy in Clear And Present Danger.  In this flic, I felt like flicking him off the screen, he was so blah and annoying.  And who the heck was he, anyway?

Hey, you'll get to see Owen Wilson's nose without enough make-up to cover the deformity from his previous breaks.

Somehow, I can't forget the image from Shanghai Noon where he is dreaming of having his ear nibbled by a sexy saloon babe, only to wake up to the reality of being buried up to his neck in desert sand and a vulture is doing the nibbling.  Behind Enemy Lines gives him a similar wake-up call.",1174521600,2,3061,4.530054644808743

The sniper definitely should've had him when he was sitting out in the open though - I mean, c'mon!  But the case goes on until the end, which almost, Almost ruined the movie for me.  I haven't seen any one person escape a hailstorm of gunfire like that untouched in quite some time.  Not even ONE bullet home in the arm or something?  In addition, it's highly unlikely that the captain of an AC carrier will fly in to the rescute in an armed Huey.  Oh well.

I was pleased that the movie combined a bit of political intrigue with generally realistic military action to yield a very enjoyable movie. There are a few moments where the movie is unbelievable, but those moments are few enough to get you to the end.

Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) and his friend and partner Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht) are flying a routine mission over Bosnia. They fly into territory into which they are not permitted. During their flight they see something on the ground that causes them to take a closer look. Using their new digital image recording system they take high-speed pictures of an area that incriminates Serbians in aggression towards Bosnians. The Serbians shoot down the F-18 with SAMs, later blaming the incident on rebel Bosnians.

Once the plane is shot down the two vulnerable pilots are quickly found by Serbian forces. Stackhouse is quickly executed, causing Burnett to yell in anguish and anger, which was a serious mistake because Stackhouse's executioner hears Burnett, and the chase is on.

This movie is all about the chase. Burnett runs for his life, trying to reach an extraction point. The Serbian executioner that murdered Stackhouse chases Burnett almost to the end of the film. During the chase there are several incidents that were very creative, though incredible in their coincidence. One example happens when Burnett has a large group of Serbians on his heels. The chase is being watched from Burnett's aircraft carrier, the Carl Vinson. When Burnett trips and falls according to the infrared image, the anxious crew of the Carl Vinson are sure he is dead, yet the chasing Serbians miraculously do not find him. You'll have to watch the movie to see why.

Burnett tries continually to make his way to the rendezvous point for extraction, and is continuously stymied. Eventually the Serbians convince NATO that Burnett has been killed by the rebels, and the Carl Vinson prepares to head for home. But, as we all know, Burnett is still trying to get out. I will not spoil the ending, which is the one portion of the movie that is really over-the-top, reminiscent of James Bond.

While the movie contains flaws in how the action is portrayed, for entertainment and patriotism it is a good bet, particularly if you enjoy military action movies.

The only question I have is whether this film is worth purchasing in Blu-Ray.  The price of the standard DVD version is significantly less than the Blu-Ray version, and I do not believe the Blu-Ray version has enough difference in video quality to justify the price difference.  My recommendation is to either wait until the price of the Blu-Ray version decreases or just buy the DVD version.

And hasn't Gene Hackman pretty much cornered the market playing cranky commanders?  But who cares:  BEHIND ENEMY LINES would work even if the leads were Henry Gibson and Larry the Cable Guy.

This film--with its contrived plot about an American pilot getting shot down over war-torn Bosnia--works through its visuals.  Video telling a story is the essence of cinema, and director John Moore succeeds masterully via a breathless array of action scenes.  But it's not just ""action"":  cinematographer Brandan Galvin delivers the action and suspense from countless angles and wrap-around shots; the slowing down, then ratcheting up of the film speed gives this movie an X-Box look.  And it's all grand fun.

The cat-and-mouse aspect of this film--as Wilson's character runs for his life under ominous grey skies--is perfected by the cold-blooded performance of Vladimir Mashkov.  The chainsmoking, sweatpant-wearing Russian actor is the perfect predator.  To top it all off, director Moore even takes a potshot or two at politically correct international posturing; that makes BEHIND ENEMY LINES even more fun.  Come to think of it, Larry the Cable Guy would look real good dodging semi-automatic gunfire.

When Burnett trips and falls according to the infrared image, the anxious crew of the Carl Vinson are sure he is dead, yet the chasing Serbians miraculously do not find him. You'll have to watch the movie to see why.

Burnett tries continually to make his way to the rendezvous point for extraction, and is continuously stymied. Eventually the Serbians convince NATO that Burnett has been killed by the rebels, and the Carl Vinson prepares to head for home. But, as we all know, Burnett is still trying to get out. I'll not spoil the ending, which is the one portion of the movie that is really over-the-top, reminiscent of James Bond.

While the movie contains flaws in how the action is portrayed, for entertainment and patriotism it is a good bet, particularly if you enjoy military action movies.",1156896000,,2479,4.963855421686747

I caught the end of this film on a cable channel and it was forever imprinted in my memory. After watching the film again from beginning to end it's become one of my favorite ""war"" type of films, realistic, dark and gritty.

 If you like Owen Wilson be prepared for a shock. In many films he is cast in comedic roles as in the Jackie Chan films, Zoolander and The Wedding Crashers but this film shows the true depth of his abilities as a serious actor. This by far is my favorite Owen Wison film.",1155859200,2,638,4.444444444444445

1433953,3,B00005JKL8,"Take one standard action film involving Americans, add in a new baddie for them to triumph over, and have the baddies act atrociously and brutally, then let the good guys be victorious in the end.

That about sums up Behind Enemy Lines.  It has reasonable special effects, a plot that is simple and oh so seen before, and a square jawed handsome hero (although, looking at Wilson's nose, not that handsome).  One thing is certain, though. As long as there is conflict in the world, there will be a Hollywood movie to glorify it and vilify the enemy.  And just who were the enemy? The Bosnians? The Serbs? The Croats? The film didn't seem very certain itself and neither was I, even at the end.

As for the movie, the opening scenes are the most rewarding. Once the movie passes into its middle it becomes a bit dull and the ending, as others have observed, is more like a Rambo film and gets quite farcical.

Sadly it just paints everyone as the baddies and only looks for the emotion of cheering 'our guys' on rather than feeling anything for the real people or real country. Saviour may be bleak and depressing as a film but my god it is easier to stomach at times than this was. If you want things going bang then it should do you but you'd best try to switch off your brain, morals and heart before you start watching it.",1149984000,,1325,4.387755102040816

Historical? No way! The only plane shot down was a single-seat US Air Force F-16 pioted by Capt McBrien (sp?) while on combat air patrol (CAP), no cameras. Some naval F-14s carried film-loaded cameras in pods, but most of the imagery pin-pointing mass graves came from U-2s and satellites (and good coordination with French peacekeepers on the ground). So, this movie was fiction. It could have conveyed a better message, a better review of the decay of the former Yugoslavia and the dominant role of Serbian forces.

Maybe the problem is that the film already seems dated- the music, the lightning fast camera shifts, even the setting in war-torn Bosnia- it just did not manage to retain its relevance in the same way that Black Hawk Down did.

It was strange to see Owen Wilson in a serious role because I'm used to him playing somewhat smarmy characters, but he carried it off quite well. And Gene Hackman was good as the admiral torn by the duty to the soldier under his command and the orders he received from higher up.

But I never could quite figure out what was going on-- why the superiors kept ordering Hackman away from rescuing the kid, and what was really going on. Again, the jerky camera angles and rapid fire music were distracting. It was also hard keeping up with all the subtitles-- okay, I understand having enemy soldiers speak in a foreign language to add reality to the situation, but having to read subtitles on the small screen is a pain in the neck, especially when you're also following weird camera shots and a disjointed plot.

1433979,4,B00005JKL8,"I just chanced upon this wonderful war-based adventure-thriler last night. As it title has already said,the movie is about a young US navy navigator who struggles for survival after his fighter plane was shot down in war-torn Bosnia.

Here,Owen Wilson plays Chris Burnett,the navigator who has to flee from the local soldiers,dart behind trees and play dead. It was quite a thrill as you watched him running up and down,hanging for his dear life. However,in the second half of the movie,you began to feel for Burnett as he struggles to seek help from the US navy army via his little sensory phone (or whatever signal that you call it).You also began to to feel the various obstacles he faced as he struggles to survive inthe cold,alone in a total foreign land,with the lack of machinery weapons and tools. It sure wasn't easy for Burnett,with his enemies hot on his heels,with a very stoic,determined hitman,eager to have Burnett dead.

Gene Hackman's portrayal of a commander is also convincing as he pledges to save Burnett's life,going against the rules and orders of his superiors.

It was endrearing to see Owen Wilson in a serious role,where he plays the navigator Burnett. After all,the actor's recent roles in recent years were mostly based on the comedy genre (READ: Shanghai Knights,The Wedding Crashers,Starsky&Hutch).Watching BEHIND ENEMY LINES has allow me to give credits to Wilson as an actor. After all,he did a pretty good job in a convincing portrayal as Chris Burnett,whose auick-witted thinking saves the day,as he struggles for survival in a war torn area,behind enemy lines.",1131408000,2,1596,5.083969465648855
1433980,4,B00005JKL8,"I read many reviews where people were saying the movie is wrong, that it's not truthful and so on. To all those people I want to say: it's really beyond politics, it's just an action movie don't take it as a political tract. I'm from Russia and once one of our famous movie directors said on TV he didn't like ""Saving Private Ryan"" because this film tells the whole world americans were the only ones who won the WW2. That it seems like other nations didn't take part in the war at all. Hearing this I wanted to reply: wake up, moron, 'Ryan' is not about nations it's about personalities.

Noone actually shows himself at his best in a war. Everyone was killing each other - serbs, albanians, UN-forces... Like always there are no rights or wrongs here - everyone's to blame. Don't say it's easy for me to speak sitting far away from countries that once formed Yugoslavia - Russia is doing very wrong things now in Chechnia so we are to blame too.

But I don't think we need to carry these discussions over to the cinema. I repeat: this is only a movie and it sets rules by itself. And as a movie (not life) it's nearly perfect - pilot shot down behind enemy lines tries to escape from the cutthroates that chase him. Brave pilot, noble commanding officer, proud civilian helpers, cunning villains - what else do you need for an excellent action film?! Plus awesome special effects (the scene when the fighter jet is shot down is just frantic), beautiful landscapes, good actors... If you like war-action movies this one is yours indeed.

By the way bonus features have some extended scenes and they are gorier than they are in the film. Possibly it'd be better if they could make it to the final cut but the ratings you know... Anyway you can watch them no matter what.",1126310400,2,1770,4.473684210526316

The action throughout the whole movie was great, despite probably being unrealistic, but I don't really care about that sort of thing in most movies, because..they're movies. Watch this for the action and the pretty well-done cinematography. Not the plot or character development. There's plenty of action, shooting, and violence for action buffs out there.

1433983,3,B00005JKL8,"If a flick has at least one killer scene, is it worth it?

If the answer is affirmative, then saddle up the F-18 and let's whip and drive those nasty Serbian wranglers, pardner: ""Behind Enemy Lines"" delivers the goods in spades, with a side order of NATO-inspired multilateral lunacy and diplomatic dastardliness.

Lots of military hardware---Hueys, F-18 fighter jets, Harriers, Migs, old main Soviet battle tanks, APCs, tac-nukes, shrikes, even sharpened sticks---on display, front and center, Soldier? Check!

Aforementioned military hardware blowing sh*it up? Check!

Gimlet-eyed growling Gene Hackman (playing Gene Hackman playing crusty U.S. Admiral Leslie ""Don't you dare call me Leslie"" Reigart) glowering over consoles and translucent aircraft carrier command center battle maps full of useless blinky lights? Roger that, Captain!

Grim-faced Serbian assassins in track suits with scope-kitted hunting rifles? Renegade Serbian filthy McNasties turning a blind eye to their henchmen doing a little extracurricular ethnic cleansing? Check and double-check!

And then there are the killer scenes: ""Behind Enemy Lines"" has more than just one, particularly the brutal dogfight at the outset which duplicitously sets the flick up as if it's going to go down the ""blow sh*t up good"" hillbilly rock-and-roll good times, when in fact director John Moore is realling faking y'all out---he's really interested in an icy cold little game of Cat & Mouse.

Mouse, in this case, is hotshot U.S. flyboy Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson, who is the Zen Master of the quirky downbeat thing and a strange---but workable---choice as an action hero), who would kill or die for a little action. On Christmas Day 1995 he gets it, flying a solo mission over Bosnia that gets his nifty F-18 cowpied into a field, courtesy of a little vintage Soviet AK-AK and a little righteous indignation.

Next thing you know, Lt. Burnett is running for his life across the dead-of-winter Bosnian hellscape, hunting for a way out even as a track-suited Serb assassin hunts for him. Good times!

Now: ""Behind Enemy Lines"" was supposedly based on the reluctant adventures of USAF flier Scott O'Grady, who got shot down in Bosnia. Having gotten back Stateside, O'Grady later observed that he was ""one scared little Bunny"", making me wonder whether Air Force issue (along with the service pistol and compass) included a nice set of pink panties and a backup pair of Depends. Yuk. O'Grady also sued 20th Century Fox for slandering his good name: in his court brief, the dude complained he hadn't cussed and never disobeyed orders. Dork.

Anyway, let's bring it back to the flick: ""Behind Enemy Lines"" is crisp to behold, and follows Wilson on his little trek through a Balkan hellhole: Wilson does what he has to do like a champ. Hackman does his Hackman thing, biting back on that need to b*tchslap a twerpy NATO counterpart and growling every few minutes about ""getting his boys back"". It's all great cornball hokum: the Duke would approve.

And at its spit-shined core is a truly killer scene, one that sets it apart from and above the usual whack-a-mole-with-a-tacnuke fare of this sort: Wilson's flyboy has to literally crawl across a drainage ditch of corpses to escape his hunters.

It's a deft, brutal scene, beautifully illustrated and gorgeously paced. You'll see. It's done with a minimum of exposition, and zero fanfare, but it gets the brutality and horror of the Balkans across, this horrific little Valley of Death where genocide has been raised to the level of national sport. Why watch the game with a few buds and brews when you could be out digging a mass grave?

At any rate, you get Wilson all a-twitter, Hackman glowering and growling and swinging that swagger-stick, lots of sh*t blowing up, and a dastardly, filthy, downright mean assassin---plus a football launched from the catapult-shuttle of a US aircraft carrier.

It doesn't get much better than that.

So...No one movie can be a 100% reality, OK? It is true for ANY movie, as well as for this one. What is important in ANY movie is:  A MESSAGE !

Message of this movie is clear and artistically perfectly made, no matter if some CHETNIKS (and their allies - in former Yugoslavia, or in USA) would like to hear or see it (this message or this movie, doesn't matter). Because this movie is about battle against evil of FASCISM, no matter who represent it (in this movie is pictured serbian side of fascism 1992-1995, that commited far more attrocities in former Yugoslavia, but there were also other sides as well...)

This is Owen Wilson's best movie if you ask me.  Gene Hackman was a perfect captain and still can act very well at his age.  The historic parts in here are in the start of the movie in which it shows Yugosliva soldiers a long time ago. In the middle of te movie Owen Wilson is being chased by the soldiers and fallas into mud with all these dead bodies.  The soldiers see the bodies but do not see him.  when they are looking at the dead bodies the director shows a flashback of when the soldiers killed the muslims a long time ago.  Those were historic scenes.  This movie had wonderful camera angles and great directing.  When Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman are talking on the radio with eachother their expressions on their face are great and the special effects on this film just blew me away.  Wow how blessed we are to have all this new technology so we can make great special effects.  I liked the special feautures on this dvd.  My favorite special feauture was the commentary by the director and the editor.  I went to deleted scences and they talked about why they took some of those scenes out.  Wow the director even said this movie was origanally going to be rated R because of the graphic violence in the scenes that they deleted.  On the special feautures you can go behind the scenes of the movie and watch tthe Minority Report trailer.  The airplanes in this movie were really sweet and when Owen and his buddy are fixing to crash into a bunch of trees it is just so cool.

The shots on the deck of the aircraft carrier and of Owen Wilson on the top of a small hill were eye-pleasing.

But the director seemed determined to trump character developments by his visual styles, maybe being afraid that too much of the former would have diluted the latter. The ""killer"" was virtually portrayed as a cardboard monster whose only goal in life was to kill and hate. The movie also felt kind of choppy, being more of a series of separate scenes rather than a smooth development of plot. The screenplay was weak as well: perfunctory and thin.

Well, you can if you use a lousy script.  Where this film falls to pieces is in the script, message and character development departments.  The film came off as a blatant feature-length enlistment commercial for the Navy/Air Force, replete with the rock-video style shots and jarring action-footage.  But....it gets worse, the plot features a main character who wants to resign from the Navy because he hasn't had the opportunity to fly combat missions.  Although I imagine that this could be a problem in real life for these highly trained professionals Owen's character comes off to me as chillingly shallow even though he plays it well.

It gets even worse, the two main characters are men who find no problems in ""free-jacking"" or going ""off-mission"".  Now, I appreciate the fact that society needs people like these at times as much as it needs people who obey orders well.  My problem is that the film mindlessly glorifies these character traits as somehow noble and heroic without CLEARLY revealing the complex repercussions that often occur as a result of these types of activities.

1434055,4,B00005JKL8,"""Behind Enemy Lines"" is a great example of the action film that is so fast-paced, so visually dazzling, and so tense that the viewer doesn't have much time to think about the film itself.  Owen Wilson plays  battle-untested Navy navigator Chris Burnett who, while on a reconnaissance mission, is shot down over Bosnia.  Although both Burnett and his pilot escape alive, it quickly becomes clear they are in extreme danger.  While commanding officer Admiral Reigart (Gene Hackman) begins plans for a rescue mission, he is hampered by those in command over him.
While the premise itself is formulaic - we've all seen this scenario many, many times - the tight pacing serves the movie well, as the viewer is thrust from one suspenseful scene to another, with barely time to breathe between each.  The cinematography supplies a gorgeous texture that contrasts powerfully with the destruction Burnett must both witness and turn from to save his life.  Both symbolic of the theme and visually powerful is the enormous statue of the Virgin Mary that Burnett parachutes past, her face beautiful on one side, blown away on the other.  Upon seeing this early in the movie, you know that this action film will have its message.
This thriller provides great, tense escapism, with people, buildings, and trucks blowing up or being shot to pieces every few minutes.  The suspense is aided by several original scenes, such as the heat-sensing satellite images being watched aboard the aircraft by carrier personnel.  They can see Burnett being approached but can't understand why his pursuers walk right by him. Unfortunately, if you stop to long to consider things that happen, and how people react, you'll run right smack into implausibilities, clichs, and just plain stupidity.
I was torn about how many stars to give this film. I was riveted throughout despite its over-simplification and relative predictability.  The strongest feature of this film is its ability to draw the viewer into the plot and keep him there.  Just don't think too much about it afterward.  Four stars if you want to get lost in an action thriller, three stars if you want something more.",1075507200,14,2152,4.997198879551821

A lot of action is contained in this movie that keeps the audiences interested.  However, the plot could have been more in depth.  Despite its fairly accurate events, many unanswered question still remain that the writers never revealed.  Most scenes have been done before by many other film producers.  The computer effects are at its prime, remaining realistic-looking, that keep audiences amazed.  Its sound effects from the weapons offer a more intense experience to the action theme.  Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson are unfortunately not at their best in their careers, though their personas are credible.  However, not much demand went through their characters, which is mostly the plot's fault.  ""Behind Enemy Lines"" is great for those curious to what happened.

From there it's admiral Gene Hackman looking tough and uttering inanities (ordering his crew to ""triangulate"" Owen Wilson's location seconds after Wilson told him where he was located; or ordering ""intel"" to tell him who was chasing Wilson moments after Wilson told him he was being chased by Serbs).

Usually whenever this movie is on HBO, I watch this part and then turn something else on.  The rest of the movie really sucks.  And I, personally, am getting tired of Gene Hackman playing the same roles over and over.
Basically, the flight sequence is probably the coolest air scene ever in a movie.  Top Gun can't even compete really.  The fireball is hokey, but overall the sequence is done pretty well.  The rest of the movie is boring.  Nothing to do with flying at all.  It's one man versus an entire army, and guess who wins?

1434060,4,B00005JKL8,"I was concerned that this movie would either be influenced by the continued backlash from Viet Nam or would be so incredibly over-the-top as to be completely unbelievable.  I was pleased that the movie combined a bit of political intrigue with generally realistic military action to yield a very enjoyable movie.  There are a few moments where the movie is unbelievable, but those moments are few enough to get you to the end.
Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) and his friend and partner Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht) are flying a routine mission over Bosnia.  They fly into territory into which they are not permitted.  During their flight they see something on the ground that causes them to take a closer look.  Using their new digital image recording system they take high-speed pictures of an area that incriminates Serbians in aggression towards Bosnians.  The Serbians shoot down the F-18 with SAMs, later blaming the incident on rebel Bosnians.
Once the plane is shot down the two vulnerable pilots are quickly found by Serbian forces.  Stackhouse is quickly executed, causing Burnett to yell in anguish and anger, which of course was a serious mistake because Stackhouse's executioner hears Burnett, and the chase is on.
This movie is all about the chase.  Burnett runs for his life, trying to reach an extraction point.  The Serbian executioner that murdered Stackhouse chases Burnett almost to the end of the film.  During the chase there are several incidents that were very creative, though incredible in their coincidence.  One example happens when Burnett has a large group of Serbians on his heels.  The chase is being watched from Burnett's aircraft carrier, the Carl Vinson.  When Burnett trips and falls according to the infrared image, the anxious crew of the Carl Vinson are sure he is dead, yet the chasing Serbians miraculously do not find him.  You'll have to watch the movie to see why.
Burnett tries continually to make his way to the rendezvous point for extraction, and is continuously stymied.  Eventually the Serbians convince NATO that Burnett has been killed by the rebels, and the Carl Vinson prepares to head for home.  But, as we all know, Burnett is still trying to get out.  I'll not spoil the ending, which is the one portion of the movie that is really over-the-top, more reminiscent of James Bond than the military.
While the movie contains flaws in how the action is portrayed, for entertainment and patriotism it is a good bet, particularly if you enjoy military action movies.",1064880000,4,2514,4.9618138424821
1434061,4,B00005JKL8,"This film has some of the best flight sequences I have ever seen. The cinematography is superb, and one gets a glimpse into the speed a pilot experiences as he tries to outmaneuver an oncoming missile; it also shows the ""nuts and bolts"" of the ejection seat process, which I found fascinating.
Having fairly low expectations for this film, I was amazed at how entertaining and visually stunning it actually is, and am surprised it did not receive greater success in its theatrical release.
It takes place in Bosnia during an imaginary time, with US forces under NATO command, and though fiction, it uses captions at the end, telling the audience what happened to the characters, as if it were a true story.
Filmed on the USS Carl Vinson, and in Slovakia, with the beauty of the Carpathian mountains as a backdrop for the horror of a war zone, director John Moore keeps the pace of this film constantly pumping. Though some characters are somewhat cartoonish, and the script at times silly, much of the acting is good. Gene Hackman can always be depended upon for a solid performance, and Owen Wilson does well as the main protagonist, who starts out as being a rather shallow, whiny fellow, and grows with his extreme experience, as he plays a cat and mouse chase with a Serbian ""tracker"", played by Russian actor Vladimir Maskov. Gabriel Macht is excellent in the smaller part of the fighter pilot Stackhouse.
Yes, there are times the plot is contrived and not altogether believable, but this is more than made up for by the dazzling cinematography by Brandan Galvin, a fine score by Don Davis, and astounding visual and sound effects...and if you like jets and choppers the way I do, you are guaranteed to like this film.",1064880000,12,1723,4.7275747508305646

It really is an epic; a tale of how willpower can survive men of the highest caliber in the most serious and severe conditions. It's Christmas: everyone is in a good mood. But one proud man stands up to the captain: he's had enough of the damn navy: shouting, dying, crying: why should he do it? He tells Gene Hackman, playing the role of the captain. He's upset, and ridicules him bigtime. He sends the pilot and his best buddy to fly recon over Bosnia, now named Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the militia see them and shoot them down. They're the real Milosovich crew. It's a cat and mouse chase: and to cut a long story short, the young pilot's friend gets shot before his own eyes. The pilot runs for miles: through railway stations, explosions, death pits and assassins. People think he's dead. But he gets home safely.
I'll give this video four or even five stars, and as a fictional thing, it really brings home how the military deals with real war situations.",1055980800,3,1110,4.527363184079602

1434085,3,B00005JKL8,"I didn't really like this movies and I teeter back and forth from giving it 3 stars or the 2 that it probably is more deserving of.
First let me say that this is NOT really a WAR MOVIE. It's more an action movie that is set in a war zone and has some combat.
My first gripe is that I was really distracted by the use of the camera in this film. They tried to do too much fancy stufdf with the camera and it was disorientating to me. This is very noticable in the beggining when they are about to be shot down and I DID NOT LIKE IT! It was annoying... I mean just let me WATCH the movie.
My second problem is that the movie professed itself to be a war movie while it was not. This is no ""saving private ryan"" or ""enemy at the gates"". The plot isn't particularly intriguing and the action in the movie isn't terribley great either. There is a cool battle at the end, though a bit unbelievable and a bit over-dramatized (and plus how none of the americans died is beyond me).
I just didn't find very much to like about the movie and too many things to complain about. I rented it on PPV and am not in a rush to see it again. It wasn't completely bad, but it wouldnt be up for an oscar either. This is the kind of movie you rent when there is nothing else good at the video store or that you watch when you are really bored or don't plan to pay much attnetion to anyhow.",1052179200,,1367,3.9745454545454546
1434086,2,B00005JKL8,"The marketing for this film hardly touched on one of the key story elements of a movie like this: the enemy.  Commercials and trailers show the bad guys in balaclavas with AK-47s and define them as the enemy.
The point?  Here we have a good chance to make a Hollywood film and touch on the Bosnian war.  Instead we get a waste of everyone's time, including the always-great Gene Hackman.  You can't fault him when he has a shoddy script and an overall lame effort around him.
During the Bosnian war a US pilot is shot down after discovering illegal movement and activity by the Bosnian Serb army during a cease fire.  The pilot and co-pilot get shot down and parachute out.  The co-pilot is discovered by the ""evil"" Bosnian Serbs and then...executed.  Right.  I guess it's because the Serbs are just bad guys.  They're portrayed as no less than an evil crew who like hunting people down and killing them.  No flattery here as we get every cliche in the book.
Since the story isn't going to make sense, at least we get some good effort by Hackman and Owen Wilson, who isn't too bad for the ""hero"".  With that nose at least he's somewhat believable as a weary soldier.
The film delivers some more of the now very tired action techniques of showing flying missles and bullets and planes and cars that look well executed but become utterly boring and unexciting because of their recycled feel.  I would have liked to have seen a more delicate treatment of matters in the film, turning out a better story about civil war and intervening powers, but we're left with your typical jingoist trash that provides a short cut to thinking without even being escapist fun.",1047168000,6,1658,4.583050847457627

1434088,3,B00005JKL8,"Actually, it's about 3.5 stars; they really need a .5 option here, don't they?  Anyway, I have to admit, I didn't expect this movie to be so great.  I rented it on hopes that it would be good, and it didn't let me down.  Owen Wilson may be one of the most underrated actors in today's distressing 'teen idol' movie business.  And Gene Hackman proves once again why he's such a dominant force in film.
Wilson stars as Lt. Chris Burnett, a fighter pilot on his way out of the force.  Then on a simple routine flight, him and his partner Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht) cross into territory they shouldn't have been near; which makes things take a turn for the worst.  Wilson ends up on the run, alone, from the Russians who want him dead.  Meanwhile, Adm. Leslie Reigart (Hackman) is forced to put many lives in danger for just one.  It's an awesome action movie that holds your attention throughout, even if the plot seems to be a little dull (which it's really not).  It ranks right up there with ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Patriot"" as one of the best military/war movies one can view.  Wilson is great; he handles the action perfectly, and he even chips in some good comedy towards the beginning of the movie.
Also, this is not the first time Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson have teamed up.  In the same year (2001), both starred in the hilarious hit comedy ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", a movie that has quite a different style than that of this one.  Grant it, I don't think they'll turn out to be the Ben Affleck/Matt Damon of the 00's, but they do work wonders together.
In seeing this film, you won't be disappointed with it.  Although ""Behind Enemy Lines"" does not have the blood and guts/guns-in-your-face of ""Saving Private Ryan"" or even ""The Thin Red Line"", it's still a good action thriller you souldn't miss.",1044403200,3,1810,4.532307692307692
1434089,3,B00005JKL8,"In ""Behind Enemy Lines"", Owen Wilson stars as Lt. Chris Burnett, a Naval Aviator shot down in Bosnia and on the run from the murderous, genocidal Bosnia army.  Gene Hackman is his supperior/father figure, Adm. Leslie Reigart.  Hackman guides and comforts Wilson as he attempts to make his way to a safe landing zone where he can be picked up and flown to safety.  Along the way, Wilson's character discovers that Muslims are still being slaughtered by the Bosnian Army in the so-called DMZ.  Besides the army looking for him, Wilson must also escape from the lethal sniper known only as ""The Tracker"", who isn't much of a shot and is easily fooled.  The film itself is ludicrus.  There is no way that any of this could possibly happen.  But that does not stop it from being entertaining.
What makes this film work is the utter determination of it's stars to take it seriously.  They say their lines with absolute conviction, not going through the motions or hamming it up.  With a plot like this, hammy acting, which admittedly has it's place in implausible action films, would have ruined it.  These actors believe in what they're saying and doing.  And it actually adds drama to a film that would have none if the actors didn't at least TRY to convey seriousness.  Casting Wilson and Hackman was briliant, as was the casting of David Keith as Reigarts top aide.  These men will not let the movie collapse around them.  Keith never met a bad line he couldn't deliver with utter conviction.  These three make the dramatic scenes work.  Wilson seems appropriately disoriented as a pilot who wanted action in his missions but wasn't prepared for it.  He's clumsy on the ground and not thinking straight most of the time.  He conveys this well.  It is now my belief that it is impossible for Gene Hackman to give a bad performance.  He is at least good in everything he does.  While he is only good here, he's still a commanding presence.
The action scenes are also well made.  The downing of the plane is one of the best made jet action sequences since ""Top Gun"".  It is exciting and tense, and it is a testament to the director's ability.  Wilson's journey through a ruined Bosnia also has some excellent action scenes, such as the attack on the city of Haj, and a harrowing moment in a mine field, in which the director shows some flair.  I won't give away the secrets of the totally absurd final actions scene, but say what you will about realisim, it's fun and exciting.
The film, upon release in late 2001, was criticized for being too rah-rah American, for being jingoistic.  That is unfair.  Why must the US being successful militarliy always be called Jingoistic?  Is it because NATO wants to keep the American's from succeeding?  I will say it is rah-rah American, but not so awful that it's jingoistic.  There's no real message in this movie, other than genocide is bad and america's military will kick you butt.

Owen Wilson's performance was OK at best, but the action scences were INTENSE, and the plot twists kept me on the edge of my seat. While all that was great, the best part of the movie was by far it's audio side. The sound of explosions, jet engines, and bullets flying was amazing, and the music is more than just the standard heavy metal guitar solo: it actually has good music, music that I would want to listen to more than once. However, even though this was a great movie, it is a great movie ONCE. It's just one of those movies where it's the greatest thing in the world the first time, but makes you want to projectile vomit the second. But that's just my opinion.

Director Moore even has the grace to slyly insert a piece of dialogue criticizing Hackman for risking the peace process and thousands of Bosnian lives for the sake of one American flyboy. And a tip of the hat to casting, which has a real find in the Bosnian sniper hunting Owen Wilson. In a seriously underwritten part, this actor manages to make the sniper character a convincing human being, which is no mean feat. Another special mention for animation--the effects are seamless. I never once got the impression that I was watching computer graphics and/or miniatures. Cinematography, stunts, wardrobe, and makeup are all first-rate. In general, the technical credits are flawless. Next time, Hollywood, give John Moore a crack at an excellent script and you might have another ""Training Day"" on your hands.

Wilson's casually glib performance in the lead makes this obvious war propaganda so much easier to swallow, his self-effacing humour and lazy swagger all going against the square-cut, on-target caricatures we have gotten used to in this genre. Hackman is less successful at shaking off the shackles of expectation from his role, giving a performance that is an easy spin-off of his far superior turn in Crimson Tide.

There is a final scene with intense action and the movie tends to keep you on the edge of your seat.

The sad not is the plot, which lacks of any originality and sometimes seems quite unrealistic (a whole army shoots at Owen Wilson and they all miss the mark?) but the action scenes above the average give it some interest.
On the technical side the Dolby Digital and, especially, the DTS track are very good and they really challenge your home theatre thanks to the big explosions provided by the context. The video quality is faultless too, though sometimes colours tend to be a little bit too washy.

He just plays himself in every role he's done. In interviews he's the first to admit that he doesn't have much acting talent. I mean the guy was a English major in college. For him becoming a high-paid actor was probably never on the forecast back in the minimum-wage earning days.

1434164,4,B00005JKL8,"Don't watch this expecting anything more than an action-packed, melodramatic, shallow, attention-holding, rootin'-tootin', flag-wavin', cheesey, cat-and-mouse, shoot 'em up.  You'll be disappointed.  This is no Jane Austin adaptation.  Or We Were Soldiers for that matter.  There's not much serious drama going on here.  Look elsewhere.
Owen Wilson plays a Naval fighter plane's navigator.  His performance is not Oscar-worthy, but more than adequate.  He was funny and convincing.  (I don't understand all the protests over the choice of him to play this character in these reviews.  Who would they rather have?  Stallone?)  He and his pilot are shot down during a routine reconnaisance mission over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Gene Hackman plays the Admiral and commander of their carrier, and is handcuffed by NATO politics while trying to rescue his boys.  The race is on to extract Wilson before he's caught by the... uh, Bosnians--err, no wait.. the Serbians--uh... whatever, the bad guys.
I was pleasantly surprised by this films entertainment value.  Yes, it's a bit of a Navy commercial, but it's done well and looks great.  It's very fast-paced and loaded with thrills.  It held my attention throughout.  The special effects were impressive, albeit rather cheesey in their implementation.  Like a whole battalion shooting at a one running man and never hitting him.  But it's spirit and thrills makes up for that type of deus ex machina convention.  The effects sequence where their plane was being chased by a surface-to-air missile was nearly as good as can be done.
The picture and audio quality of the DVD are top notch.  I've listened with only the DTS audio on, but I'm sure you'll find the other options done well also. The extras are a little spare, offering commentary, a short ""featurette"", and a couple trailers.
Overall I give this a 4 because it succeeds at entertaining, which is too infrequent of a quality in movies.",1037318400,8,1935,5.157556270096463

On a mission, these two fly beyond the allowed flight space, discover military activity and are shot down. After that, the intrigue ends, and the suspenseful monotonous chase begins as Wilson flees from the Serb army in order to rendez-vous with his squadron. This story seems almost plausible, except for the too frequent narrow escapes, and the numerous lapses in judgment on the part of Wilson's character. For example - surviving running through a mine field, not being shot by an entire army, hiding under dead bodies, and my personal favorite - while wearing black, Wilson stops for a break on a white concrete slope, fully aware of the army chasing him. In fact, about half hour into the movie, I found myself rooting for the sniper - in the sheer hope that he would kill Wilson and the movie would end.",1031356800,13,1152,4.731343283582089

1434172,4,B00005JKL8,"This is a very entertaining and visually pleasing film, one that will capture your interest and propel it along for the almost two hours of the movie. Yet it is really just an escape movie that happened to be released in the aftermath of the 911 events, and so capitalized on the pent-up feelings of patriotism everyone was experiencing at the time. As a thinly disguised although highly fictionalized representation of an actual case of an American flier rescued after evading the Serbs for several days during the Bosnian police action, this might have made some sense.
Yet the depiction of the Serb ground forces as brutal and conscienceless bogeymen is a bit overdone and not very accurate; most of the Serbs treated downed American fliers with consideration and in a very friendly manner. Of course, had this been depicted as part of the Kosovo effort, the scenes depicting the Serbs might have been more accurate. As it stands, however, the story is hardly representative of the reality on the ground during the Bosnian campaign.

Still, taken at face value as action entertainment, the movie isn't half-bad. Yet as anything like serious drama it has too many implausible elements and too many coincidences to hold water. So, while this is no ""to Hell And Back', it is an exciting escapist excursion you will enjoy watching. The scenes filmed on the carrier are especially graphic and well done, and the shots of the planes coming off the deck are breath taking.
So too the aerial photography is very well choreographed and accomplished, and the action shots of the plane being engaged by ground batteries fairly realistic in its technical details. The cast is quite good, with Owen Wilson playing the downed flier and Gene Hackman the Carrier skipper who is trying to get him back.

What made this movie more apealing was during the time of it's release, when many Americans just needed to be away from the real world for a couple hours.
The story takes place in the Balkans where a routine recon flight is taking place. The pilot and his ""Wizzo"" (weapons intelligents officer) decided to investigate some activity in the no fly zone. To their horror they are shot down and now the Wizzo (Owen Wilson) must track through hostile territory to reach a safe zone where he can be rescued.

Although there are several very corny lines by Gene Hackman the movie has generally a very good plot.  If you enjoy watching Owen Wilson this is a great movie.,1029110400,2,584,4.523809523809524
1434195,2,B00005JKL8,"**1/2 In the opening scene of ""Behind Enemy Lines,"" Navy pilot Chris Burnett and his flight buddy - affectionately known as ""Stackhouse"" - indulge in a little pre-flight gallows humor as they recall various famous rock performers who have met their ends in plane crashes.  Is it any surprise, then, that these two jocular jocks will face the prospect of a similar fate before too many more scenes have played themselves out?
Indeed, it turns out that, not long afterwards, both Burnett and Stackhouse are shot down by the Serbians while flying a reconnaissance mission over what is supposed to be a de-militarized zone in Bosnia.  Only Burnett survives and he is forced to hot foot it over miles of difficult and unfamiliar terrain while being pursued by sniper forces bent on his annihilation.  Gene Hackman co-stars as Burnett's hardnosed - but actually soft-hearted - commanding officer who is forced to decide between keeping the terms of a fragile NATO-imposed peace agreement, thereby leaving Burnett to fend for himself in the wild, or saying to hell with the treaty and rescuing one of his own men as his gut instincts tell him to do.
If ""Behind Enemy Lines"" turns out to be a fairly decent action picture, it is attributable almost entirely to the likeability factor emanating, as always, from actor Owen Wilson.  With his Average Joe persona, Wilson takes Burnett out of the realm of superhero and makes him a character we can identify with - this despite the fact that the number of hairbreadth escapes that Burnett manages to pull off strain our credulity far beyond the breaking point.  Wilson is also aided by the flashy visual technique employed by director John Moore, which helps to cover up the fact that the screenplay has really very little character development taking place under its action-movie surface.  We might also object to the fact that the script never even attempts to come to terms with the complex nature of the Bosnian conflict, choosing instead to reduce the issue to as simplistic a sociopolitical level as possible.  The film also suffers from a sort of built-in monotony factor, endemic to most man-on-the-run narratives.  This is especially aggravated - as it is in this film - when the chase is taking place in a foreign country with very few of the people our hero encounters able to communicate with him much beyond simple phrases and gestures.
The cinematography does a tremendous job capturing the stark beauty of the film's bleak, wintertime setting.  Unfortunately, the adrenaline-pumping rock music soundtrack tends to not only undercut the sense of realism created by the photography, but to cheapen the serious and tragic real life events that define the film's historical context.  Perhaps the bitter war in Bosnia is simply too recent and too fresh in our minds to serve as an excuse for yet another rah-rah tale of American ingenuity and virtue.

Before I decided to rent ""Behind Enemy Lines"" , I'd thought to myself : ""Eran , the summer is upon us , it's a very hot and dry evening , what could be better than watching a good action movie ? "" . Was I right ! This film gave me exactly what I'd wanted - pure , well-done , often mindless action - but it has more to it .
Significance -
------------
Despite its nature , one must not assume this motion picture has no purpose , not by a long shot . My friends , this movie , as its name implies , takes in hand the very serious matter of a soldier that is caught in hostile territory and is counting on his government to come for the rescue . As one might predict , things do not develop smoothly , and our fallen hero has to wander around for quite sometime , because of political considerations .
This story has been told more than once in previous films , having ""First Blood - Part II"" as being the most famous , as far as I can remember : The U.S. government decided to leave Rambo behind at the rendezvous point on account of  , again , political reasons .
However , these occurrences are not just fiction and exist in reality as well , even in Israel ; Two years ago , in the early days of the second Intifada , the Palestinians , in ""Yosef Grave"" in the vicinity of Nablus, seriously wounded and surrounded a young Israeli soldier, named Madhat Yousef . I remember hearing the advancement of the Israeli endeavors in ""doing something and bringing him safely home"" . These efforts proved unsuccessful because the Palestinians wouldn't let the I.D.F evacuate him peacefully ...
I was afraid that all the kind of things you generally see in the above movies would become a harsh reality . As a nation , we didn't want to believe that the political agenda - of not wanting to escalate the conflict that was re-emerging , once again , by an engagement of a full-time military rescue mission -would prevail . Nevertheless , in reality bad things happen , and Yousef was left to die .
The Israeli government allegedly decided he was expendable , as both Rambo and this movie's pilot ; the inhuman consideration of cost versus utility indicated the price tag that would assure his rescue was too high ... I recall I couldn't believe it was happening : it was all like a bad dream I wanted to wake up from .
I believe these kind of desicions and impotent actions are sins and brutal-irresponsible betrayals . ""Behind Enemy Lines"" points at the same direction , and goes the whole nine yards : it preaches that the men directly in charge must do everything , including disregarding superior commanders' and political leaders' direct orders to realize one of the Rangers' honorable mottos of ""Never leaving behind a fallen comrade , no matter the odds or the enemy"".
This is the main message of this film . Personally , I like this message , but don't know if it can really stand the test of reality . In Israel it didn't , hopefully for the last time . I assume one cannot judge a field commander since the price is so high as the film demonstrates eventually .
In the end , I do hope this story would give some food for thought to persons that could find themselves in similar situations in the future to come . If the film has managed to accomplish such end , it has surely been a lot more than the ordinary action flick .
The plot -
----------
At the first 15 minutes the movie touches the delicate issue of the frustration and boredom the American soldiers around the world go through being the police officers of the world , yet not engaging real combat or meaningful actions most of the time . The rest of the movie is dedicated to showing the severe consequences of such feelings .
Our hero is a Navy navigator (Owen Wilson) that during a regular flight patrol above Bosnia , decides to investigate suspected activity outside the course of his original mission (the consequence of the above feelings). This deviation comes with a grave punishment when his plane is targeted and hit by enemy's missiles .
The attempts to dodge the missiles are fantastic - there has been a while since I was so tensed and thrilled - in matters of photographing , sound and maneuvers - this is one of the top performances Hollywood has orchestrated in years .
The two are hit , manage to abort , but the enemy catches the pilot . That leaves our hero all alone and on the run . On his way we witness some of the atrocities that land had to bear through the horrible war a few years ago . As mentioned , the rescue missions are delayed again and again , due to the region's political agenda , bringing in the extra value I discussed earlier .
In the end , Gene Hackman , the Carrier's admiral , takes matters into his own hands , to come up with a impressive finale .
The cast -
----------
Owen Wilson , as the young navigator , is not the typical macho man you'd expect and that was a surprise to me too . Rather , he's an ordinary likeable fellow , with the knowledge of survival techniques and great amount of luck ... Look , he's not acting that different from the way he acted in ""Shanghais Noon"" , I don't suppose he really can . I think it is this that makes the story more appealing than the familiar ""run and hide"" type of films .
Gene Hackman , long after his prime , gives a good portrayal of his character's inability and powerlessness at first , then his pains and dilemmas , and ultimately his resolution of doubts and action .
The DVD -
---------
The quality of the picture is obvious and great as always .
as for the extra material , it's worthless : they have put in all the editor's cut scenes of the bloody and gory images you really wouldn't want to see . This abortion made the film a PG-13 in my opinion .
=================================================================
In all , this movie is a living proof that action films can stand for something , rather than only violence and carnage .",1027209600,8,5927,4.33963963963964

If one is to join the NAVY expecting that bullets, will chose to avoid them due to their degree of expressed patriotism, they should chose a Hollywood career instead!
A rescue operation is supposed to be a 'brains first-muscles second' business, the result of a combination of careful planning and daring attitude. The ""Admiral"" made a point there when he ""grilled"" the navigator about drills, but the rest of the movie including his choice of sending a demoralized personnel into a holiday mission, not assigning a liaison officer in the NATO rescue mission, and so-on and so-forth reveal his own incompetence. The gung-ho decision of the pilots to fly over the neutral zone completes the picture.
Thank God this is NOT a real story and these people are NOT real NAVY officers!
I would feel more safe and proud as an American having a cynical but sharp group of people to fight for this country than a reckless but ""patriotic"" bunch, with good looks and loads of testosterone who count on Hollywood bias to have them wining unnecessary battles.

1434220,3,B00005JKL8,"In 1998, with ""Saving Private Ryan,"" Steven Spielberg raised the bar for all that would follow in the genre of ""War"" films (just as his colleague, George Lucas, had done some years earlier for Science Fiction with the original ""Star Wars"").  Spielberg put the reality into war on the silver screen, and since then nothing less has been acceptable.  Not to say that ""reality"" alone makes for a successful film; other elements must be factored in, and in the final analysis, each film will succeed or fail on it's own individual merits, reality aside.  One that does succeed, and for a number of reasons, is ""Behind Enemy Lines,"" directed by John Moore, which delivers that expected reality, but offers a lot more along the way, as well.
On a Christmas Day routine recon flight over Bosnia, Navy pilot Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht), and his navigator, Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson), notice some activity in one of the ""demilitarized"" zones (which also happens to be a ""no-flight"" zone), and summarily take it upon themselves to investigate.  Their efforts immediately cause more than a little consternation in certain quarters, however, and very quickly their mission goes south with dire results.  Having seen (and photographed, no less) things not meant for their eyes, they find themselves on the wrong end of hostile missile, and their plane goes down.
Having ejected in time, Burnett finds himself on the ground, alone, and in hostile territory.  He manages to call in his position, but due to the muddled and convoluted politics of the moment, Admiral Leslie Reigart (Gene Hackman) is prevented from sending help in straight away, which leaves Burnett for a time to his own devices for survival in unknown terrain while in harm's way.  But Burnett, a seven year veteran, is determined to make it, and to make this mission mean something-- which it will, if only he can get the proof of what he's seen back safely.  And that means beating the enemy at their own game, and on their turf.
Initially, Moore's film seems destined to become just one more of the brutally realistic and action packed war stories that have evolved since Spielberg's ""Ryan,"" albeit a good one, from all indications early on.  The story is solid and there's plenty of action, all of which is carried off nicely by star Owen Wilson, but by the half-way point there's nothing much that sets it apart from the usual action/drama survival film.  It plays out, in fact, like a cross between ""Enemy At the Gates"" and ""Black Hawk Down.""  Then something happens-- and it takes a turn that kicks it up a notch and takes it beyond anything those other films offered and/or delivered.
Once the action surrounding Burnett's dilemma is established, Moore sharpens his focus on the more personal aspects of the story, and it suddenly becomes more than just a quest for survival; it becomes the study of a man on a mission, a man with a goal and a purpose, an individual against whom the odds are decidedly stacked.  And by infusing that decisive human element into the story, it elevates the film to a higher level and achieves the kind of success never realized by either of the aforementioned films, in part because of their failure to effect that very same level of human drama that sets this film apart.
As Burnett, Owen Wilson is very effective, turning in a performance that is quite natural and affecting.  Wilson has something of a quirky appearance and a rather mesmerizing tone and manner of speaking that gives him a charismatic screen presence and makes him extremely accessible and convincing.  He manages to avoid the trappings of the stereotypical ""fly-boy"" character, checking his ego and machismo at the door, and it makes Burnett very real and believable.  It also makes the development of his character-- his actions, reactions and attitudes-- convincing as the story progresses, as well as lending credibility to the overall film.
Hackman, on the other hand, falls directly into stereotype with his portrayal of Reigart; this is a character we've seen time and time again in just about every war film to come down the pike.  But to his credit, Hackman does it extremely well, which is the beauty of watching an actor of his caliber perform.  He's the consummate professional, and even when covering familiar ground, he has the ability to make it seem fresh and, most importantly, entertaining.  Hackman is a gifted actor with a tremendous range; this character-- by it's inherent nature-- simply has nothing to offer by way of a challenge.  Reigart is merely a character that serves a purpose, and Hackman realizes that intent to the fullest.
The supporting cast includes Charles Mark Whitfield (Rodway), Joaquim de Almeida (Piquet), David Keith (O'Malley), Olek Krupa (Lokar), Vladimir Mashkov (Tracker) and Marko Igonda (Bazda).  A film that offers some insights into politics, as well as the human condition, it manages to be thought provoking while delivering some terrific action, drama and solid entertainment.  Worthy to be called one of ""Ryan's "" more successful offspring, ""Behind Enemy Lines"" is the watermelon of war films; it takes some doing to get through the rind, but once you get to the good part, it's pretty sweet, and more than worth the effort.  And that's the magic of the movies.",1025481600,12,5280,4.915635545556805

Owen Wilson's acting is sad. Not only is the character he plays the stereotypical ""frustrated navy pilot trying to be a hot shot daredevil who turns out to be a hero in the end,"" but his portrayl of the character only helps to emphasize why you hate those characters. And up until now, I did not think I could dislike any character Gene Hackman played, but this movie proved me wrong. Though I say so with no discredit to Hackman as the primary disease in this movie was the script itself.
There are a couple unique tactics the director takes with it, such as sudden pause frames and slow-motion takes. And the special efforts are of course great. But nothing could have saved this script. Overall, it's a very lackluster attempt, and I only gave it a two stars instead of one because Hollywood has done worse.

With great performances by the two leading men, Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson, Behind Enemy Lines is a good movie that keeps you interested throughout and makes you feel like you're a part of it.
John Moore does a fairly nice job as director.  There wasn't really anything spectacular done.  It was a pretty basic form, but I'm not complaining.  It worked.
The action sequences were a bit unbelievable, and that is why I give this film only four stars.  Also, I don't think the scenes were produced all that well and cleanly.  I've definitely seen better.  But to me, the action was only a sideshow to what the movie was really about.  It wasn't about people getting shot up and killed; it was about survival and how one man will stop at nothing and use his brain instead of weaponry to get himself out of a sticky situation. 4 Stars",1023580800,6,1089,4.41

1434298,4,B00005JKL8,"After having seen a ton of war movies in the past few years, I went into ""Behind Enemy Lines"" with very few expectations. However, to my surprise, the movie was thrilling from start to finish! The feeling of desperation and fear behind enemy lines is felt throughout the whole escapade, and the movie launches from one scene to the next with hardly time for the viewer to catch his breath. Owen Wilson, who produced arguably mixed performances in laughable movies (pun unintended) such as Shanghai Noon and Zoolander, actually does a credible job delivering the pulsating action right to your doorstep. You truly feel for him, and any attempts to empathize with his plight only serve to intensify the fear. Director John Moore is on top form, and cleverly uses Gene Hackman as a mirror to illustrate the war that is concurrently taking place within the confines of the political arena. Hackman, who is superb as Wilson's commanding officer, exposes the true irony of the society that we live in. Many a time, as we have seen throughout history, mankind will typically do what is best for their own selfish cause, rather than what is necessary to preserve human life and ensure justice. In their attempt at justification, the powers-that-would-be claim that the needs of one should be sacrificed for the needs of many. This is none more so apparent than when politics is concerned, and Hackman constantly wages a moral battle between disobeying direct orders and sacrificing a man's life.
While the action sequences, populated with spectacular explosions, are both stunning and enjoyable, hard-nosed critics will still be able to find minor faults with the movie. But as a viewer with pure entertainment in mind, the intense action and gripping drama make this one movie not to be missed!",1023148800,5,1787,4.96
1434299,3,B00005JKL8,"OK, this is a typical American-made military movie.  Yes, I can say that, because I AM an American.  There are lots of explosions, bullets flying everywhere, etc., and it's all based on a true story!
It's really not bad.  Owen Wilson is spot on as a Navy flier fed up with milk runs and police duty.  He's turned in his resignation and is just clocking time till his service is up.  On a recon mission, he and his pilot spot unusual activity ""off the beaten path"" in territory that is supposed to be off limits. Their plane gets shot down as they do an unauthorized flyover, getting them caught ""Behind Enemy Lines.""  The plot follows Owen's character, the sole survivor, as he tries to reach a safe rescue spot.  As these kind of movies go, it's very watchable.
Well, there were a few places where you think, ""No way is anybody going to go through all that and walk away.""  Hollywood bad guys never can shoot worth a darn.  I thought the ending in particular was way over the top, but what the heck.  I'm not sorry we rented it.",1022976000,6,1029,4.368421052631579
1434300,2,B00005JKL8,"""Behind Enemy Lines"" is exactly the kind of film that I will not spare harsh words for. After all, was I not made to sit for two hours watching a work so devoid of passion, truth and entertainment value? The film is predictable down to the very last detail. It is a work processed straight out of the Hollywood Money Making Machine with no touch of humanity anywhere to be found. I think it would be more appropriately titled ""Run Owen, Run! (Brought to you by Coca-Cola, Chevrolet and Ice Cube.)"" If you've seen the film you know exactly what I'm talking about.
If you must know, the plot involves Owen Wilson as Chris Burnett, a Navy lieutenant running away from his Serbian foes. Gene Hackman is Admiral Reigart, the one trying to pick Burnett up and bring him back home. The trouble is, a peace treaty was recently signed between America and those chasing Burnett, so if Admiral Reigart dares and goes after him, his entire command is at stake. War is a complex subject, and a good war film should never be able to be summarized in three sentences. But this isn't a good war film, and I just did it, didn't I?
I probably don't need to tell you how unrealistic this whole affair is. Am I supposed to believe that with an entire section of the Serbian army on his tail, Burnett gets out completely unscathed? Are these guys really such bad shots that out of all of them, not one can even hit Burnett in the leg? With the carelessness Burnett shows, he's pretty damn lucky that Hollywood ""magic"" can pull him out of a jam whenever he needs. I say Burnett is careless, let me elaborate. If I were in his position, and had a chance to escape by blending in with the opponent, there is no way I would take off a ski mask that was concealing my identity (even if I did get rewarded by hearing that triumphant music in the background).
I am also sick of directors coming into Hollywood, placing a bunch of radical camera tricks in their film and thinking that makes them Orson Welles. POV, 360 degree rotation, Slow-Motion (one of the inventions the film world would be a better place without), lightning-quick montages, it's all here, and ALL the time. Director John Moore never gives it a rest. English should be a required course in film school so directors can forget about the lenses and the camera speeds for at least a minute and focus on the point they're trying to get across.
Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman do their worst in this film. Owen Wilson is a generally good actor who somehow lets all his acting skills go to waste and create a completely bland, stupid character. And Gene Hackman? It would be a huge understatement to call him a fantastic actor who's had some classic performances, but he is scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one. I can safely say that this is one of the worst performances of his fruitful career, and I am in shock that such a smart actor as him would choose such an empty project. However, Gene Hackman at his worst is better than Ben Affleck trying his hardest. The one reason ""Behind Enemy Lines"" is on a level slightly above dreck like ""Pearl Harbor"" is because it is graced with his presence.
""Behind Enemy Lines"" is the kind of film built to [bring] in money, and maybe grab a few awards along the way. Unfortunately, this is becoming the norm for war movies these days, but trust me, people aren't being fooled. If you want a surge of post 9/11 patriotism or inspiration, save your nine bucks and rent something with real emotion like ""Casablanca"" or ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington""; something that aims to do more than nab the top spot at the weekend box office.",1022889600,5,3612,4.474242424242425

Although not completely accurate, it was still a great action film that kept me interested the entire time. (And after all, Hollywood's first priority was never accuracy, was it?) I thought the acting from Gene Hackman was wonderful, and Owen Wilson did a great job, as well.

Really, it was worth that just to hear Hackman yell ""What the...is the problem???""  I also loved the landscape: creepy and desolate and more like a character in the movie than just a background.
One thing that baffled me: during the mass grave scene, there's a flashback (in black and white) of the mass killings, and right in the middle of it there's a tiny 2 or 3-second segment that came directly from the movie ""The Savior"" (great movie)when the main female character is about to be murdered.

1434304,4,B00005JKL8,"This film gets very high marks for technical excellence for a war story with good action footage, but the story is so contrived and unbelievable that the film plays more like a fantasy adventure than a realistic war film.  We are asked to swallow so many events that just wouldn't happen that the film loses a good deal of credibility.
Who could possibly believe that the U.S. would sit still while N.A.T.O. dictated that we must not attempt the rescue of a downed pilot becaue it might upset the peace process in Bosnia?  That is utter nonsense.  And are we to believe that an entire platoon of soldiers with automatic weapons all firing simultaneously could not hit the constantly dodging Burnett?  Not likely.  There are numerous other plot contrivances that require extraordinary suspension of disbelief, but most of them are critical plot elements so I will refrain from possible spoilers.
John Moore is a rookie director that does a terrific job with the technical elements of the film.  He presents a very realistic look and feel in the carrier scenes and the air combat scene is first rate.  Actually, all the action sequences are outstanding, no doubt in large part due to the work of twenty year stunt veteran Steve Davison (""End of Days"", ""Batman and Robin""), who was the second unit director and stunt coordinator.  This film also blends stunt photography seamlessly with visual effects to produce extremely realistic action scenes.  However, when it comes to managing the screenplay, Moore seems to just assume that the writers are the best judge of how the plot is presented, or he doesn't connect with the concepts plot and character believability.
This is Owen Wilson's first film in the lead and while he does a good job, he just isn't serious action-hero material.  Wilson projects a naturally sarcastic, smart aleck personality that works in some of the scenes in this film, but when it gets to the macho action sequences, he just can't carry it.  He was terrific in Shanghai Noon, where the action was all tongue-in-cheek.  In that film, his wisecracking humor was a perfect fit.  However, this film gives him little opportunity to display his fabulous comedic talents and he is adrift trying to play the survivor.
Gene Hackman plays a supporting role and as always gives us a solid performance as Admiral Reigart.  I can't keep track of how many military movies (mostly naval) David Keith has been in since ""An Officer and A Gentleman"".  He must be on only one call list.  He always gives a credible performance in these roles and this one is no different.  Joaquim de Almeida is dreadful as Admiral Piquet of N.A.T.O. command.

Behind Enemy Lines is just average military thriller movie starring Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman and a pretty good ensemble cast.  The story of the movie is pretty simple.  Owen Wilson is a Navy pilot/navigator assigned on the aircraft carrier U.S.S Carl Vinson captained by Gene Hackman.  The carrier is deployed to support the NATO effort in the Bosnia conflict.  During a recon mission, Owen and his pilot stray into the DMZ and discover the Bosnian Serbs covering up a mass grave.  After being discovered, the Serbs deploy Surface to Air missiles and shoot down the F-18.
When the F-18 flies over the Bosnian, they fire up several SAM's to shoot down the plane.  What follows next is some of the best action film sequences I have even seen.  The F-18 is being pursued by 2 SAM's that eventually end up getting the plane which requires the pilot and navigator to eject and land in enemy territory.  While on the ground, the movie gets interesting as Owen Wilson is pursed by rebel Serbian forces and a trained killer as he tries to make to one of the safe zones for extraction.
In one of the lighter parts of this movie, Owen Wilson is rescued by a bunch of Croat Muslims as he is being chased by the Serb sniper.  One of the guys is an Elvis impersonator while the other young guy in the back is an Ice Cube fan.  As he's sitting in the back of the pickup truck, this young Croat is admiring his 9mm sidearm.  Turns out this guy is big fan of hip-hop and rap and start rapping.  It's pretty funny, but I guess you just have to see it.
Everything eventually ends well and the rescue team does come and get him making this a fun joyful ride.  The special effects are great and you must watch this movie with your volume cranked up.  This is a great movie to show off your receivers and speakers.",1020556800,6,1875,4.378612716763006

This movie combined many of the new directing techniques that have been evolving in the last few years. They contribute to the energy and (I'm assuming) the realism of some action scenes, which are pretty spectacular in this movie.  The plot had enough twists to make it unique and interesting compared to many of the past ""find the lost soldier"" films over the years.  It added some depth to the story.
Granted the bad guys couldn't shoot straight, but they didn't have too many clear opportunities (until the end), and John Wayne got famous battling gunmen who apparently lost all motor skills upon drawing their weapons.  The ending belonged in a James Bond film, all we needed was a babe pulling him into the helicopter.  I was pleased enough with the rest of the movie to overlook that.",1020470400,,1171,4.715686274509804

Just fake. Owen wilson was very disapointing and hackman just didn't seem as good, didn't put in much effort~",1020470400,6,282,4.549019607843137
1434346,5,B00005JKL8,"Remember the news item a few years ago about an American Air Force pilot who was shot down over Bosnia and eventually rescued?  Well, this is NOT his story.  The only similarity is the concept.  That said, you can relax and enjoy this film for what it is - a wartime rescue thriller.
Starring Owen Wilson as Chris Burnett, a navy pilot in Bosnia and Gene Hackman as the seasoned Admiral Reigart who has to report to a French NATO commander, this film was directed by the young Tim Moore, known for directing SEGA commercials.  No wonder it has such intense and non-stop high energy.
Gene Hackman's performance shines as he is constantly torn between doing what he thinks is right and following orders and adds a very human dimension to the film - so much so that it actually brought tears to my eyes.  I also was kept at the edge of my seat by the constant tension as the pilot first watches his partner being executed and then is the object of a chase by what looks like the entire Serbian army.  The technical effects are outstanding and I felt the pilot's fear, panic and quick decisions as he dodges a wide variety of explosive devices and bullets.  Of course it's preposterous.  But the film moves so quickly and things happen so fast that I had no time to ponder the actual reality of what was going on.  Instead, I was drawn right into the film and felt I was right by his side as he ran for his life.
Yes, the outcome is predictable.  And the ending, which will leave people thinking this was a true story, is deceptive.  Forget about historical accuracy.  And forget about reality.  Just think of this of an escape film with a large enough budget to make the experience an exaggerated version of real life.",1020384000,7,1715,4.440894568690096
1434366,3,B00005JKL8,"This above average military-techno-action thriller and recruitment tool was entertaining stuff. By combining small elements of ""Top Gun"", ""Bat 21"", and even ""The Terminator"", and ""True Lies"", this movie aimed for a demographic bullseye for the studio's target audience of the moment, and fully aware of that demographic's limited attention span, wrapped up the digital/celluloid action in something less than 2 hours. Always dependable Gene Hackman was excellent as the hard bitten and frustrated Admiral Riegart.  I especially liked the fresh face of Owen Wilson as a recalcitrant Navy officer/mouse locked in a game of survival with a pack of ruthless Balkan cats. I still don't exactly know who the enemy/insurgents were supposed to be, was it the Serbs, Bosnians, Croats, or Muslims?  Everyone seemed to play interchangeable roles. In the end, I guess it really didn't make much difference as the point of the excercise was keep it entertaining and keep it moving along. I don't know where they shot the location photography for this movie either but they made me believe it could be the heart of the former Yugoslavia. But the point of the exercise was to celebrate and demonstrate America's superior position as the world's greatest military force and rescuer of hapless pilots. Some of the awesome special effects strained credulity, but nevertheless, the movie as a whole succeeded in providing tantalizing insights into various intellegence gathering techniques at our country's disposal. The predictable ending had just the right amount of pop-corn selling, testesterone elevating elements to make any red-blooded American boy want to sign up for duty.

Some interesting cinematography (with an obvious influence from _Saving Private Ryan_, esp. apparent when Serbians unload on Burnett/Owen Wilson after he sees them shoot his pilot & in some of more extreme violence; check out extra scenes for more of that, since was toned down a bit to achieve PG-13 rating) and excellent special effects (to whit, SAM chase scene).  Wilson shows some breadth here by playing an uncharacteristic (up to this point) role of action hero:  although his portrayal has an everyman quality that separates it from the typical straight testosterone variety (which is a GOOD  thing!).

Although it was filmed in Slovakia and NOT in the Balkans, it does convey the barbarism of the Balkan war. The DVD contains deleted explicit scenes, which should had been left in the film and not cut, and tacked on in the extras section, because the additional footage, shows  more realism of the evil situation and the atrocities done by the Serbs. The biggest drawback is the believability factor of the main character: his clean shaven look,  and the lack of portrayal  of someone who is truly trying to survive against all odds. The special affects are very good and the use of actual Soviet equipment (borrowed from the Slovak army I suppose) of the type supplied to the Serbian army gives the film  additional credibility to the location, but they do not compensate enough, as the utilization of the  main character undermines the film.  The ending is somewhat comical and very unrealistic, and that also impairs the film, which is too bad as the US Navy cooperated in the making of this film.

1434374,2,B00005JKL8,"During the opening credits of `Behind Enemy Lines"", I felt like I was watching a super slick recruitment ad for the United States Navy - the kind that seems to say that war used to be hell, but now it's fun. It turns out that first time director John Moore is an award-winning TV commercial director. His arsenal of flash filmy techniques is impressive, but it's not enough to save the movie from its banal, cartoon-like script.
Burnett [Owen Wilson] is among about a thousand pilots stuck on an aircraft carrier not far from the war front. Bored and frustrated by a conflict he doesn't understand, he decides to turn in his resignation. His superior officer, Admiral Reigert [Gene Hackman], is miffed by Burnett's decision and decides to pay him back by sending him on a routine mission on Christmas Day. Flying over a demilitarized zone, Burnett photographs something he wasn't supposed to see. In retaliation, Bosnian forces shoot the plane down. Reigert mounts a rescue mission, which is hampered by NATO commanders, who are negotiating a withdrawal from the war. Burnett is left on his own to escape, all the while being pursued by a vicious Bosnian sniper.
The hero goes from one bad situation to another. He's often saved only because this is one of those movies in which a hundred bad guys couldn't collectively hit the side of a barn door. The movie really does play like video game. Every time Burnett escapes a situation, he simply moves on the next game level. Consequently, there's never any genuine emotion, just a series of adrenaline rushes.
Wilson tries hard, but he can't overcome the fact that his character is so shallow, he might as well be the roadrunner from the famous old cartoons. Ironically, Wilson is himself an award-winning scriptwriter. Hackman has little to do except look gruff but fatherly and speak in old Hollywood cliches that are supposed to sound meaningful.
""Behind Enemy Lines"" does succeed in the action department. The sequence where the jet is shot down is spectacular. A great deal of attention is paid to details in these scenes. Too bad the filmmakers forgot to pay attention to the script. [Note: In defense of the director, the studio allegedly forced him to edit his original ""R"" rated cut down to a ""PG-13"" version. It would be interesting to see if more than just some violent images wound up on the cutting room floor.]",1019952000,6,2372,4.801955990220049

1434417,4,B00005JKL8,"I just picked up this film on DVD having never seen it before.  I wanted to initiallly but missed it in the theaters.  But anyway, I was pleasantly surprised.  This military action drama had elements of the movies Top Gun, Sniper, and Rambo.  As most should know, that the jist of this movie is that Owen Wilson plays a navigator on a two-seat F/A-18 Super Hornet and he and his pilot are shot down on a Christmas photo-recon mission over Bosnia.  The missile evading scene is pretty intense.  You haven't seen jet manuevers like that since Top Gun.
Now then the USS Carl Vinson gets the word that one of their planes have been shot down.  The problem is that the war is supposed to be over due to a peace treaty.  To send in a rescue mission and risk confrontation with the Serbs after the treaty would nullify the treaty and extend the war causing even more suffering.  So Gene Hackman's character is prohibited from launching a rescue mission.
For those that have seen Hackman's 1988 film Bat*21, might recognize some similarities in how the Carrier tells Owen to move from place to place for pick-up that never comes.  (In Bat*21, Hackamn played a Colonel that was shot down in 'Nam in which he used an overlay of a golf course on the map in plotting his movements).
One of the Serbs pursuing Wilson is a guy with an axe to grind.  He carries a high-powered sniper rifle, and we get scenes similar to Tom Berenger's 1993 film Sniper.  Wilson runs from him and gets shot at quite often.
The film concludes on a high frozen mountain where one of the ejection seats landed.  Wilson uses this seat as bait to get the sniper guy out in the open.  Wilson suddenly jumps up out of a snow bank and they fight to the death with shades of a Rambo scene.  However, the whole Serb army comes rolling in with armor suport and a platoon or two of infantry.  However by his time, Hackman has 3 loaded gunship helicopters on the way and they provide close air support against the Serbs.  Very fun scene with cool visuals and sounds.
This movie uses some very unique camera tricks.  There's several flashback scenes and they use reused footage, but from differnet angles and speeds.  It is very cool.
The picture and sound on the DVD is extraordinary.  The picture is very clean and sharp with great blacks and shadow definiton.  The sound, while not as good as Super-Bit titles, is very well mixed.  In action scenes, the bullets whiz by your head and explosions shake it.
This movie is a good showcase for Russian military equipment.  At first the F-18 is shot down by an Sa-13 Gopher SAM system.  The Serbs also have a couple of actual T-72s and several BMP-1s.  This movie was made with full cooperation with the US Navy including military supervisors.  So this movie is pretty much technically accurate.

I kept hoping the bad guys would kill the aviator and put me out of my misery watching this turkey. Cinematography, lighting and locations were excellent, but the plot was absurd and the script went from one bizzare farce ( like being able to hear bullets coming when you are the target ) to another ( like the bad guys killing the pilot instead of using him as a hostage ).  Then there was the memorable scene where the bad guys were standing within 4 feet of the hero in a flat muddy area, but could not find him.  Perhaps the worst was the hero hiding under snow / ice for 15 min and jumping out just at the right moment to off the main bad guy. Maybe our boy had a periscope - that would be no more improbable than the rest of this waste of film.  Gene Hackman usually indicates a worth-the-money movie.

The amount of extras disapointed me. There were supposedly approximately 8 extended or deleted scenes. The amount of new material between all of them probably amounted to around 2 minutes. Most of the ""extra"" scenes were actually in the movie, but they call it extra because small parts were cut out to get the movie an R rating.

It struck me as a little odd as to why Serbian soldiers were planting trees to the backdrop of erie back tingling music. As most people are familiar with the atrocities that the Serbs committed during their reign of carnage and mayhem, then you probably guesed why the soldiers were planting trees.
Another aspect of the movie that I liked was the portrayal of the immense difficulties that existed between American and Allied NATO forces in how operations were to be carried out against the Serbs. However, I believe that more information could have been given about the relationship between the French and American Admiral.
Although the ending was predictable and somewhat gungho, I feel it was a proper ending. When Hackman joined the Marine team in it's extraction of the downed navigator, it really displayed the humanness of the American Admiral.

1434454,3,B00005JKL8,"""Behind Enemy Lines"" (2001)
Behind Enemy Lines was a movie I went to see purely because nothing else was on. I'd seen almost every movie that was playing and even though I really didn't want to, I went along to see Behind Enemy Lines. There were a lot of reasons I expected to highly dislike this film. I thought it would be just a bunch of mindless excuses for explosions with bad performances (mostly because I don't like Owen Wilson very much) and a way over-long running time. But to my utter surprise, I enjoyed almost every moment of this thrill ride.
The main reason Behind Enemy Lines works with its story-line is because it runs two stories at the same time and keeps us enthralled through both of them. The movie has a tendency to leave us in the Owen Wilson-getting-chased-by-baddies' most exciting scenes and change over to the less adrenaline charged but still interesting Gene Hackman-chasing-down-Owen-Wilson's-whereabouts' story. This leaves us hanging on the edge of our seats for more action and gives the movie way more intrigue.
The other thing that gives Behind Enemy Lines a kick in the right direction is the stylistic camera-work in the film. We get all kinds of different shots for all kinds of different action sequences. The hand-held camera work is very effective and makes the movie seem more war-like. The cinematography is neat in the way it can show endless styles to shoot scenes within the first hour but find plenty more to finish off the movie. It really shows how cinematography and shooting styles are advancing to new levels these days.
Of course, there is nothing more I enjoyed this movie for more than its entertainment value and action sequences. The action scenes are breathtaking and sometimes a little far-fetched but they are amazingly stylish and work into the movies plot in many ways. I especially enjoyed the first major action sequence in which Owen Wilson and a flight buddy dodge, dive and ditch the missiles that the baddies', the Somalians, are sending from the ground. This action sequence is fabulously original and uses a lot of visual and special techniques to get the overall result of one of the tensest scenes of 2001.
Unfortunately, the movie does have its problems. If you're looking for a movie with 3 dimensional characters, a plausible story and a lot of believable scenes that come from the heart, then I don't recommend this movie. The barely 1 dimensional ""heroic"" characters (especially Wilson's character) aren't likeable at the start. Um, Owen, are you completely blind or just stupid? He has just had his plane blown up, fallen through trees, and landed on unknown territory which contains some very dangerous people who were trying to kill him and his fly buddy about 5 minutes ago, and Wilson's character is able to crack smiles and make a joke?...  This movie needs lessons in being more plausible, because this movie got a right kick in the pants for that one scene.
... On the subject of lines and quotes, beware for the cheese that comes out of Gene Hackman's mouth in this film. The lines are not atrocious, but they aren't believable or easy to take seriously either.
This is one big package with the title ACTION BLOCKBUSTER stamped all over it. I guess you know what that means these days, in short: lots of adventure, lots of fun, but reasonably dumb.

Great character development for the protagonist, a young sassy airman who puts in for a discharge in the beginning of the movie. Gene Hackman's character is complex and realistic as well, caught between the modern political details of war and the simple commitment to keeping his troops safe. I felt that this movie dealt very well with a lot of the issues and emotions behind the conflict in Kosovo. Two scenes especially bring home what was at stake during these events-when the young airman evades capture by blending in with bodies in a mass grave, and when he is with the Bosnians in Hac (sp?), a town under siege by Milosevic's forces. This is a great modern war movie, and I'd readily recommend it to anyone who's interested in movies about history, the military, or good-old-fashioned exciting action films.",1018224000,,961,4.865853658536586

It also draws you in. I was not bored for a second. And I bore easily, especially in war and action movies. Thankfully, this film is the right combination between action and plot.

1434457,3,B00005JKL8,"Well, we ended up seeing this movie because 'Ocean's Eleven' was sold
  out. So we didn't go in with too many expectations, which ensured that
  we didn't end up disappointed.
  The basic plot is this : Owen Wilson's character, a disillusioned Navy
  pilot who wants to quit, strays into the enemy territory and is shot
  down. He loses his partner, and must now reach the enemy lines for
  his commanding officer (Gene Hackman) to try and save him.
  The rest of the movie is about the game of cat and mouse that ensues
  as our hero's pursued by two foes : the forces of the enemy, as well
  a mercenary employed by them. Also, rescue plans are repeatedly
  thwarted by 'complicated international policies'  and 'navy decorum'.
  Plus points - Owen Wilson's performance. He brings a likeability to
  his character that makes you root for him (even if he seems to do
  some rather silly things at times!). Gene Hackman's good, too - but
  given his calibre and experience, he can do these roles in his sleep.
  There's also some great camerawork and a few good action sequences.
  Minuses - The Bosnian situation seems to be treated rather superficially,
  and the enemy are almost caricature like 'bad guys'. Also, there are
  several sequences which stretch credibility a fair bit, eg the way the
  man on the run keeps dashing off in broad daylight and nothing ever
  happens to him; similarly a senior office like Hackman's character going
  off in person with the rescue team.

Owen Wilson plays a cocky, but always loveable, jet piolt who's never seen action and who's tired of it all.  Gene Hackman doesn't sweat at all playing his caption in charge.  One day Owen goes on a survey flight and treds of course and snaps a few pictures on a group of ""people"" getting rid of corpeses; the people shoot him down....and now he's behind enemy lines and on the run from the enemy.  All in all it's a good mindless fun popcorn guzzuling flick.
If this sounds like your bag then don't wait to buy it if your sceptical then rent it.
A great plus on the DVD is the DTS track and this DVD is a must if you want to showoff your sound system.  The track is great and shows off some impressive bass from the missle envaison part....if anything....this is the reason to own this DVD.",1017360000,6,972,4.260869565217392
1434461,4,B00005JKL8,"I was pleasantly surprised when I walked out of this movie .  I enjoyed it immensely. My sentiments was share by my 11 year old nephew . It did not try to be something it was not.  It is a war movie and that is what it was filmed as.
The movie itself was film quite well with it's use of special effects and scenery  with some of the beautiful landscape of the county used for plot line purposes.
I also enjoyed the fact that they did not try to put a romance in a war movie were it did not belong
All in all this was a great movie and will enjoy watching it over and over",1017014400,,572,3.830508474576271
1434462,2,B00005JKL8,"This movie had every chance to succeed: A great trailer; Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman; a John and Jim Thomas (Predator, Executive Decision) script; a budget of $40 mil.  But for all this, the whole is decidedly less than the sum of it's parts. What happened?
Well for one thing, Owen Wilson was all but wasted in his role as Lt. Barnett.  No chances to utilize the deft comic touch he's displayed in Shanghai Noon and Zoolander.  All he had to do in this film was run from guys shooting at him, and while he does that effectively, what's the point?  I wish that he had been given the freedom to do more with the role.
Meanwhile Gene Hackman essentially reprises the same role that he had in Crimson Tide, then as a sub captain, now a ship admiral.  Though it is a role his fills well, it's not as interesting anymore.  Also, ""Enemy Lines"" strains plausibility more than even the most unbelievable flag-waving war film...the scene where he hides in a graveyard of corpses with the enemy literally walking over him was especially ludicrous.
And I found myself annoyed by much of director John Moore's camera work.  Obviously he's yet another commercial director, based on the frenetic herky-jerky camera work on display here.  Can't these guys just hold the camera still and let the action unfold, as opposed to trying to create the action with a bunch of quick cuts and shaky shots?
I really wanted this movie to be good, and just because it's better than most of the mediocrity released last year, that's still no excuse.  It could've been much more.
Perhaps the true test of a movie's worth: I will not be buying this one when it is available on DVD.",1016496000,2,1651,4.569491525423729
1434463,5,B00005JKL8,"This movie rocked! The whole disinchanted Navy Pilot, gets a lesson in the value of being, an American , and a member of the Armed Forces works well.  Owen Wilson's character grows up fast, and in war-torn Bosnia he has no choice.  Gene Hackman turns in another fine performance, as Wilson's CO.  The part where he starts talking to Wilson over the radio to get his pilot to calm down, and collect himself works well.  Being in the military I wouldn't have moved during the daytime, and if I could help it would have tried to avoid that booby trapped area.  Look past that stuff, sit back, and take a military action adventure ride Hollywood Style!",1015545600,6,648,4.551724137931035
