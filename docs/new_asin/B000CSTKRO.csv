8102045,1,B000CSTKRO,It never did hold my attention. The description of the film made it more interesting than it actually was.,1259280000,,106,4.631578947368421
8102046,1,B000CSTKRO,"The only parts I enjoyed were views of Shanghai, The Bund, Pudong as it reminded me of my trip there.  If the idea of the film was to convey that there's an element of lawlessness and aimlessness in Shanghai, then yes, that was achieved.  You can always sense some danger in Shanghai.  But I mean, you can't even feel sorry for these people!! I judge a film by how much it keeps me awake...unfortunately, both my husband and I nodded off a few times during the film.  Sad, as most indi films have been well worth my time...and don't mistake my ""name"" to think I don't watch serious films - I've seen my fair share.",1172188800,,614,4.3130434782608695
8102047,4,B000CSTKRO,"Based on a novel by Mian Mian (the actress who plays Casper) called We Are Panic, which is now banned by the communist Chinese Government. This feature gives us a glimpse into the lives of 4 Shanghai teenagers, who are part of the current 'lost generation' of Chinese kids, brought about by China's one child policy. They experiment with drugs and sexuality in an explicit but not voyeuristic manner. The first half of the film centres around an HIV panic in a group of clubbing friends, but then spreads out into other 'panics' amongst the group of friends. The film is not directed in the conventional sense as it is shot in a documentary style, giving it a visceral gritty feeling of reality, following the 'lost' teenagers through the seedy streets of late night Shanghai. This being an independent feature, showing the true reality of Shanghai, not usually seen in Chinese films that and as a result got only a few viewings within China. Best described as a Chinese Larry Clark film, with gritty and dark subject matter with little not shown off screen.",1148083200,9,1058,4.755434782608695
