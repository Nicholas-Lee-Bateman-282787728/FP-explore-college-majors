My only question and hope now is, will there be a series box set? I want to buy them all so I imagine that would save us all some money. Maybe in time for Christmas!",1311811200,6,429,3.6739130434782608

4535835,5,B0053O8AFK,A must own for Boy Meets World fans!,1457395200,,36,3.625
4535836,4,B0053O8AFK,"Sooner or later, all shows come to an end.  Sometimes, the show has lost enough fans that no one cares.  And sometimes, fans are heartbroken to hear their favorite show is ending.  (And sometimes, a show gets both of those reactions.)  I seem to remember not being too upset when it was announced that season 7 of Boy Meets World would be the final season, but having rewatched it now, I find that there is still much to enjoy this season.

This season finds the gang still in college, and Cory Matthews (Ben Savage) and his fiance Topanga Lawrence (Danielle Fishel) still reeling from the revelation at the end of season six that Topangas parents are getting a divorce.  Topanga isn't sure she believes in love, as a result.  Their relationship being on pause is even affecting their best friends, Shawn Hunter (Rider Strong) and Angela Moore (Trina McGee-Davis).  And while Cory and Topanga are able to get their relationship back on track, it actually takes Angelas father to help that couple along.

There is a wedding this season, and it happens about a third of the way through the season, leaving us plenty of time to watch Cory and Topanga settle into their new lives as a married couple.  Meanwhile, the gang plays musical roommates early on before Rachel (Maitland Ward) takes a new job as an RA and Cory and Shawns older brothers Eric (Will Friedle) and Jack (Matthew Lawrence) take on jobs working in the student union while preparing to graduate from college.

Which just leaves us with the adults.  While Mr. Feeney (William Daniels) is still in most episodes, we actually see less of Corys family than we used to.  Alan (William Russ), Amy (Betsy Randle), and Morgan (Lindsay Ridgeway) do pop up in many episodes, although the baby brother born last season is almost completely forgotten.  (No wonder I didn't remember he existed until he popped up as a teen on Girl Meets World.)

A couple of my favorite episodes revolve around the older Matthews however.  When Cory and Topanga arrive back from their honeymoon, they realize they have no place to live, and Alan absolutely refuses to help them.  The lesson at the end of that is wonderful and still rings true today.

And thats what I found while watching this show.  Even in season 7, this show could still pack in the laughs along with some good lessons about life and whats really important.  There are several episodes that made me tear up at times.  Its a great balance.

Of course, there are the reasons I was tiring of the show by the end.  Some of the characters are completely over the top.  Yes, Im looking at Eric as the worst culprit.  At the same time, he can still make me laugh.  Cory is also more likely to overreact than he used to be, which is saying something.  In both cases, it is the way the characters were written.  The cast is still doing good work, but the show was becoming a bit broad.

Plus theres the fact that a coming of age comedy has to end as the characters get older, and with some of the characters graduating college and getting married, the time had definitely come for everyone to move on.

It was also very interesting watching this season having seen what the original creator has done with the characters on the current spin-off/follow up Girl Meets World.  There is an episode that flashes forward to the future and, of course, theres how they leave the characters.  Both give fairly accurate glimpses of what theyve done with the characters the few times theyve appeared on the new show.

Speaking of the show ending, be prepared for tears as you watch those lost couple of episodes.  Its always hard to say goodbye to characters you love, and this is really no exception.

This season consisted of 23 episodes, including the two part season finale.  All of them are preserved here in full-frame and stereo sound, their native presentation.  There is nothing in the way of extras, which isn't a surprise since there hasn't been anything in the way of extras since season 2.

It was definitely time for Boy Meets World to end after season 7, but there are still laughs and great moments with these characters we love.  If you are a fan, youll be happy to relive these moments over and over again.",1456099200,,4208,4.612382234185733

4535891,5,B0053O8AFK,"Season Seven of Boy Meets World definitely feels like an ending of a series and something different than the previous six years, but that isn't a bad thing. In this season, we have Corey and Topanga struggling to be married and the gang seemingly splitting off in two different directions at the end as characters who were added from Season 5-7 went one way in life, while the core of Corey, Topanga, Shawn, and Eric went in another. While these final two-three episodes really got to me (possibly because Im a sensitive little marshmallow), the life lessons that made Boy Meets World what many people love, are missing in action.

While I understand that the group was growing up, it really seems like the adults were pushed in the background and the main characters were told to figure it out. It just kind of gave the sense that the show was ending and that no one had anything to teach the kids anymore. With that said, the episodes will still satisfy BMW junkies like me and millions of others. It just wasn't the same show that I grew up loving.

With that said, parting is in fact, such sweet sorrow.",1435449600,,1107,4.53

Watch it without the fear of any inappropriate language issues or subject matter that might be offensive to any audience.

I'm not saying I don't like how the show ended, because I did like the final few episodes. But I really am not a huge fan of the final season as a whole. 75% of the episodes are great and I do like them a lot, but there are a few episodes that you really just wonder what they were thinking and why they even made them. You can tell they were just running out of things to make episodes about and just deicded to make them up as they go. But still, it doesn't really take away from how great this show was. It takes away a little bit based on a view of ONLY THIS season, but not the show as a whole and the ending is pretty good. All in all, 3.5 stars, but I went with 4 because the show itself is great and there are some pretty good episodes in this final season.

4536453,4,B0053O8AFK,"Boy Meets World as a show was great. I enjoyed growing up along with it and I still enjoy watching it now. The first four or five seasons were really wonderful and things went slightly downhill after that. This final season didn't seem to have quite the same magic as the earlier ones but it didn't suck by any means. It was still very enjoyable but you could tell things weren't working as well as before. A lot of the story lines seem awkward or forced and many of the characters acted a little bit out of character in certain situations. In many ways there seemed to be a lot of more serious-toned episodes this season but they always felt very strange and often interweaved with the wackiness and more sit-com style they usually do all in the same episode. This often left you with an awkward feeling while watching. Overall I still recommend it though, especially if you're rounding out your collection. Despite it's pitfalls it's still better than most of the stuff out there. I am glad they ended it after this season though. It would have been a shame to drag it on like so many shows do today.",1323388800,,1102,4.46039603960396

I couldn't get enough of Cory, Shaun, Eric & the rest of the gang. I've been buying the season sets (thanks Lionsgate :) and still love it as much as I did when I was a kid. The final season is a little more wild & crazy than the rest of the series, but I think it makes the show a lot more fun to watch, especially Eric. Many great moments from the series happen in this season, in my opinion. ""The War Part I"" and ""Seven The Hard Way (Part II)"" are fantastic episodes. The series finale is great as well. The ending gets me every time!

I hope someday in the future they do a reunion episode or something. I'd love to see what the gang would be doing now. :)",1322092800,4,792,3.981132075471698

I know I saved these with the intention of watching them with my little sister once she turned 10 and now we are slowly getting through the seasons and learning the life lessons in almost every single episode. This show has had a huge impact on how many people of our generation turned into kind, compassionate human beings.

This show has some of the greatest and funniest moments on tv and I cannot express the awesomeness of it.
In regards to Season 7, this, in my opinion, is one of the funniest seasons. Also, it is the most heartfelt, especially for those who know the show and the characters well.
Again, thank you Lionsgate for these long awaited releases, and thank you Boy Meets World for great memories :)",1317772800,3,617,4.421052631578948
4536504,5,B0053O8AFK,"Boy Meets World has enjoyed an odd home release run. After 3 seasons released several years ago, there was a lengthy hiatus until September 2010 when those same seasons were re-released by Lionsgate. The company quickly followed that release up with the rest of the seasons in about a one-year period.

Season 7 was not as universally beloved as seasons 2-5, which are generally viewed as the series' high point. The season picks up from the cliffhanger ending of season 6 where Cory and Topanga postponed their wedding after Topanga's parents broke up. Now the cover of this season sort of gives away that eventually Cory and Topanga did get married, but the lead up is pretty interesting. After the wedding episode, the rest of the season deals with them getting adjusted to married life. It ends with a 2-episode clip show that wraps up all of the characters' stories by giving them all futures to pursue, some with more development than others. The Cory-Topanga wedding was a ridiculously important moment in ABC's TGIF lineup back when this show was first airing, and it's still a great moment all these years later.

Shawn went through a lot of character development through the series, and in this season, we really see him working through his various issues. Eric hit his all-time low in terms of intelligence in this season, but he still has some fantastic moments that show he's not really as dumb as he acts. He also has one of the best lines said to him by Angela's father: ""Matthews! You are a disgrace to this university, this country, and humanity in general!"" This prompted his reaction, ""Wow."" It's clear the cast is enjoying themselves, and in the end of the day, this season is just plain fun and a good way to end the show's run. Finally, the last scene in the old John Williams High School classroom set with Mr. Feeny is emotionally charged and brilliantly executed, a perfect ending to the last episode.

[EDIT: Based on information I received, and after checking that information, I need to note that a minor scene is removed from this set. Apparently it was censored after its initial run and never re-aired. It's detailed in one of the comments below if you're interested. Thanks to J. LaFollette for pointing that out to me!]

PACKAGING
The set is stylistically identical to the other Lionsgate releases. The color scheme in the background of the cover is used along the rest of the insert minus the confetti. Consistent with the other releases, the spine has a picture of Cory from this time period. Specifically, it's the same image that appears on the cover. Lined up, these sets look very nice next to one another. The back cover has a basic write-up and four screen shots, including one with the whole main cast. The discs continue the trend of the last 6 releases by featuring Cory, Topanga, and Shawn on discs 1, 2, and 3, respectively. I will note that the case is one of those Eco-cases which are more likely to damage the insert because of the obnoxious holes in it, so if you're buying from a store, inspect the package to make sure it's not punctured.

MENUS
Basically the same we've been seeing with the Boy Meets World releases since season 4, the menu uses the cover's color scheme and has a play all and episode selection option on each disc. The background music is still the season 4 title theme, which is weird. As a note, that was the theme used for seasons 1-4 when this show had a Disney Channel run in the early 2000s, so it's identifiable as associated with the show, but it's still an odd choice given that the seasons 5-7 music is readily available. No complaints; it's just a strange choice.

VIDEO
The video quality of this show is pretty good from beginning to end. This season was viewed using a standard DVD player with component cables, and the picture quality is as good as or better than other shows of this era.

SOUND
This set has a standard stereo mix. There are no other audio tracks like commentaries, so what you see is what you get. Most of the audio is in the middle, but there is some decent use of panning.

EXTRAS
Like seasons 4-6, this set has no extras to speak of. The episodes are completely uncut, though that's not an extra. I reviewed seasons 5 and 6 and pointed out that the lack of extras is a reasonable trade-off for finally having this series, but it's still worth mentioning that there aren't any bonuses here.

For those who need it, this season is closed captioned according to the specifications on the back of the case.

I'll end this by thanking Lionsgate for finally getting this show released in its entirety. It's taken far too long overall, but Lionsgate did a great job of pushing these sets out. While the absence of extras is a little annoying (at least include an interview or something!), I still have to recommend this set. If you've been collecting these DVDs, there is no reason to skip the final season. Further, since the whole series is available, now's the best time for TGIF kids to introduce their kids to this show so that a whole new generation can enjoy it. This is a great set and I wholeheartedly recommend it.",1317686400,38,5123,4.607456140350878

I would definitely recommend this show for adults and young adults alike I seriously enjoyed it and sincerely wish that TV comedy shows based around families were as good as this today. If they were, I have a feeling that many families would be better off after drawing from the wonderful examples of how to BE a healthy family.",1485907200,,718,4.653543307086614
