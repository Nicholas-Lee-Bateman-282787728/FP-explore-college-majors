6424893,1,B00KGA8DCQ,"Wow, talk about evolution failing. These dvd's used to be great buys. The 2003, 2005, and 2007 dvd's were excellent. The extra's included such awesome features as clinching quarters, where the entire 4th quarter of clinching games of every playoff series were available. This 2014 version is a sham. The extra's are worthless. The main product is so low budget, I'm shocked the NBA allowed their trademark to be used. There is CLEARLY a new company in charge of putting these Championship dvd's out, and quite frankly...they suck.",1406937600,38,530,5.034090909090909
6424894,2,B00KGA8DCQ,"As a Spurs fan, I was very excited to get my hands on this Blu-ray. However, I see little effort from the NBA when putting this package together. The main video is almost entirely close ups with most scenes in slow motion. You cannot see any of the action from the plays when viewing this terribly edited video.

Even more disappointing is that they gloss over each series with minimal substance. The NBA has put no thought or depth into the Spurs run for their fifth title. Ahmad Rashd's narration makes this DVD as dull as possibly can be. Although, the poor writing he had to read may be to blame. There is absolutely no build up or drama to get excited about. Watch some of the Lakers DVDs or even the older Spurs DVDs and you can see how much better they were produced than this garbage.

To top it all off, the extras were crap; short rehashes of previous videos. The ""Big Three's"" time is close to an end; the NBA could have put more into their history and shown great plays from over the years... something. Zero effort on the NBA's part hear. As a footnote, the sound was lacking. You do not hear the roar of the crowd or any of the Ooh and Aah moments from game play throughout the different series; Just commentators and the narration.

Conclusion: you are better off watching fan mini movies on YouTube, such as ""Spurs Tribute - The Beautiful Game"". It is a sad day when a multi-billion dollar industry with millions of dollars worth of equipment (and EXCLUSIVE FOOTAGE) at their disposal are out classed by fanboys on YouTube. Not worth $10 let alone the $19.99 sale price.",1406678400,52,1586,4.462068965517242
6424895,4,B00KGA8DCQ,"Great DVD just as all 5 of them have been! The Finals coverage was SUPERB! I only wish they would go through each playoff series game by game the same way as they do the Finals games. I'll watch this over and over again just like the others which I watched 2 times each awaiting this one. I gave it 4 stars, because the Bonus features are slim. If I was in charge, it would have the 4th quarter and OT of Game 6 vs. the Thunder, and Game 4 vs the Mavericks, plus Top 10 plays of the year, the Finals, the Big 3, and Leonard's Top 10 plays as well.

6424926,2,B00KGA8DCQ,"given the high level of absolutely superb basketball played by the Spurs during the entire 2014 playoffs, the ~1 hour of video shown on this DVD is a farce and frankly a rip-off.

Although I watched the playoff I wanted to re-live the beautiful sport and sportsmanship displayed by the San Antonio Spurs.....

This DVD did not provide that and I was thoroughly disappointed and frankly disgusted! another example of why the NBA is losing viewers and fans ( I pay for NFL and soccer paks on satellite; not NBA)",1410048000,3,509,4.644444444444445

Very disappointed in the general lack of quality & content of this DVD.
The so-called bonus features are merely 3-4 minute clips of interviews which do not really provide any real, extra insight to the Spurs team/players.
I also have the 03, 05, 07 Championship DVDs and this one is by far the worst. I definitely miss the ""clinching quarters"" from 2003 the most.
And, yes, most of the clips are already used by online mini-movies / music videos.

Instead i get this sorry ass excuse of a dvd. Youtube has far better footage made by fans! many many things suck about It first of all the WBs dramtic and exciting narrition changed from the past spurs dvds i loved is gone and replaced with a cheap generic company i i never heard of worst of all  they got spurs hater amad rashad narrating instead who sounds like hes just reading from a damm script that alone makes this entire docu as boring as possible since thier is zero conviction in his boring voice pretty much all the footage was reused and gives a very rushed through vibe through out. Key footage from all rounds are not even shown like Diaws key three in game 4 vs dallas or blairs ejection all of the 2nd round vs portland, Duncuns amazing and dramtic shot that put away okc.

Love my Spurs, love this chip, but this championship movie is really below average compared to the ones before. In the ones before the narration of the whole journey was just better, better interviews, better footage, more fitting scenes and quotes.

I so hope they make a 30 for 30 documentary of this championship journey because what the NBA has done is really not on par with what I've seen of them before.

You could have easily just put the Finals mini movies together and would have had better results. Really disappointed in this one, hope next season we get a better one because of course we will repeat. #GoSpursGo #ChaseforSeis",1409011200,3,777,4.7835820895522385

6424942,4,B00KGA8DCQ,"I have to chime in here.  I see all the reviews that disapprove of this product (I agree for the most part).  And the bonus features are certainly lacking without a doubt.  So while I agree, I want to come at a different angle.  This DVD should have been made for the hard core Spurs fan, since we all know that the Spurs are not the kind of team that the public follows.  Who else is going to buy this?  With that in mind, they really failed to capture why this championship was so special to the Spurs & to the fans (their target audience).  Follow the timeline.  2007 - 4th Championship!  2008 - WCF, but Manu has a bad ankle.  2009 - out in the first round for the first time & Manu out with an ankle.  2010 - swept by the Suns.  Looks like the end of Timmy as he cannot defend the pick & roll anymore.  2011 - lost to 8th seeded Memphis as the #1 seed.  I honestly took 2 bottles & poured them on the ground after this thinking that it was a great run & that it was time to look back & enjoy the past so we wouldn't have to look at our bleak future.  2012 - Spurs are back!  but a crushing loss to OKC after winning 20 in a row.  2013 - we all know what happened.  So while the DVD starts in 2013, the story really starts earlier.  That's why this championship was so sweet.  We never thought they'd get here again.

As for this DVD, a lot of missed moments, especially during the playoffs.  Dejuan Blair, Fish getting crushed on a pick for the Manu 3, Diaw's 26 in Game 6 against OKC.  But most of all I can't believe that they didn't show the pivotal turning point of the entire playoffs in my mind.  There's always pivotal moments in every Championship run.  99 - Memorial Day Miracle.  2003 - Steve Kerr's 4 3's in Dallas, Game 6.  2005 - Horry's Game 5 4th quarter & OT.  2007 - Horry's hip check.  This video didn't include this year's pivotal moment,  Cory Joseph's dunk on Serge Ibaka in the garbage time of Game 4 of the WCF.  Major ommission.  I really thought OKC & Ibaka were in the Spurs heads until that play.  Things really changed after that.

Aside from that, I think that they did a poor job of showing how much of a landslide the Finals were.  That's another reason this was so sweet.  I didn't mind the different angles & shots.  I felt that we were getting something we couldn't get on Youtube.  I just felt like the narrative didn't capture what Spurs fans really felt.  Perhaps they should have hired a Spurs fan or 2 as consultants.

So why 4 stars?  Because having a mediocre championship DVD beats what happened in 2013.  The fact that there's a championship to celebrate requires at least 4 stars.  But other than that, this DVD wasn't great, although the championship itself was.  Like others, I'd rate the videos in this order: 2003, 2005, 1999, 2014 & 2007.",1408579200,,2792,4.216318785578748

6424944,3,B00KGA8DCQ,"I thought the Blu-ray video was ok, but I feel like I saw better and more interesting content on YouTube.  Doesn't seem like much effort was put into compiling the video.  I bought this to remember the Spurs after the Big 3 are all retired and what they've accomplished together.  Narration and content were uninspiring, unlike the Spurs who's drive and determination brought them another championship.  I hope somebody else puts together a more fitting Blu-ray  compilation to document their teamwork, leadership, and commitment to the game.",1408233600,,542,5.183908045977011
6424945,2,B00KGA8DCQ,"As a huge Spurs fan, I have to admit this DVD was a disappointment. The DVD had a very rushed look/feeling to it. It was very lazily produced--packaging and feature-- and much of the footage was reused. The DVD did not cover the amount of detail and insight that I know Spurs fans deserved to have seen in such an anticipated feature. Key game notes, such a Kawhi's clutch defensive play on Westbrook that sealed the series, went unmentioned and much of the Finals footage had already been used in the mini-movies that you could see on YouTube.

I can recall a good amount of special features on all of the other Spurs DVDs, including the ""clinching quarters"", player features, post game/series analysis, and even some instructional material (shooting techniques, etc.).

In the 2014 DVD, it was so watered down and there was only just a small, bland box-full of things just listed out, without a care for page design.

Overall, the passion for storytelling and attention to detail was just not there, and the creativity in the production was almost nonexistent.

From a purist like me, it was just underwhelming and a clear contest from the level of production quality for the previous DVDs. I haven't the slightest doubt in my mind that any avid Spurs fan with a passion for the game, and a knack for filmmaking could put together a better feature for the fans than what this turned out to be.",1408147200,5,1395,4.681632653061224

I would give a second star for getting Greg Poppovich to give a short insight into his view on this year's championship run but even that was short.

6424953,1,B00KGA8DCQ,"As a Spurs fan, I consider myself fortunate to even be able to compare one Championship DVD to another. The Spurs have had championships videos spanning 3 different home video formats (VHS,DVD,Blu-Ray). And the quality of each of these videos have ranged from really great, to truly awful.

The zenith of these videos was reached in 2003, where the DVD was packed with bonus features, my favorite of which were the clinching fourth quarters of each playoff round. The run time of this DVD was a whopping 195 minutes. Keep in mind, the first four Spurs championship videos were produced by Warner Home Video.

The 2005 video only had the clinching fourth quarter for Game 7 of the NBA Finals, but was loaded with other features, and player profiles, totaling to a run time of 200 minutes. However the season retrospective was very well done, and led to perhaps the Spurs most dramatic Finals win.

The 2007 video (run time 104 minutes) didn't feature any of the clinching fourth quarters, was pretty vanilla, but did feature recaps of the first 3 championships, and profiles of several players. The bonus features still totaled in the double digits, and was still satisfying, despite not including a Spurs fans most cherished special feature.

This brings us to the 2014 championship DVD/Blu-Ray. The producer for this video was the generically named ""Team Marketing"". The run time for this pathetic excuse of a commemorative video is a paltry 75 minutes. The voice-over for the season retrospective was done by Amad Rashad, who speaks as though he is ordering an appetizer from the menu at his local Chilis. He fails to capture one iota of one of the drama of one of the great redemption stories in the history of the NBA. As for the handful of bonus features included, most of them are simply features that were done earlier in the season, and just dumped onto this DVD to extend the run time. It seems absolutely no effort was put into this. What is most maddening is the wasted space on the Blu-Ray that could have been filled to the brim with the two ""The Beautiful Game"" features, and the ""From The Ashes"" feature that brought chills and tears to die-hard Spurs fans. The NBA should be ashamed to have their name on the box. And this company called ""Team Marketing"" should consider going into another line of business.",1407456000,36,2323,4.742574257425742
6424954,1,B00KGA8DCQ,"Went into this with low expectations based on other reviews, but this was actually worse than I'd been expecting. Absolutely zero effort has been put into this DVD, and 56 minutes is nowhere near enough time to cover a fantastic season. None of the games are put into any real context, and Game 6 versus the Thunder - one of the greatest wins in Spurs history - is completely overlooked as merely a routine overtime victory. The extras are appalling, and are a complete waste of time. Seriously, just 75 minutes' worth of content on a Blu-Ray disc that could hold well over four hours? The NBA should be embarrassed by this.",1407283200,8,624,4.580357142857143

The fact the bench was one of the main reason the team had the best record in the regular season.
The defense that Kawhi played on Lebron was out of this world.
The play of Boris & Patty gave them
How Manu came into game 5 with the team down in the 1st & turn the whole team around.
After the 3's & the dunk over little Boshie, the game was OVER!!!!",1407196800,28,863,3.897727272727273

6424957,3,B00KGA8DCQ,"I'm excited for the Spurs revenge win against the Heat and the journey was long and awesome to witness, but this DVD felt like the NBA didn't put the same amount of effort into the whole DVD. The film itself is short in length and not in depth as i would have hoped. The spurs had a great season in comparison to previous years, yet the video only spent 12 minutes discussing the season. I'm not sure that I'm disappointed because of the great YouTube videos,",1407024000,12,459,4.348837209302325
