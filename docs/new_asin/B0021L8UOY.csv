3832493,3,B0021L8UOY,"AWAY WE GO could very easily have been an unbearable, clich&eacute;d-packed indie film, were it not for the two extremely winning lead performances from John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph.  The film is just PACKED with those kinds of quirky, funny-but-hiding-real-inner-pain characters that good actors enjoy chewing into, even as they come across as completely unbelievable as recognizable human beings.

Here's just one example:  Allison Janney, who is a terrific performer, smart & funny, plays a mother and wife.  Her husband (Jim Gaffigan) clearly doesn't interest her (not that he tries) and her kids are sources of contempt for her...as though they have grown up with personalities that she did nothing to shape or mold.  She is quick with loud-mouth, witty remarks...but she is clearly seething with anger over how her life has turned out, her marriage to a man who makes her practically physically ill and her do-nothing, chubby kids.  We laugh at her, and we are disgusted by her.  But she's TOO MUCH to really be believable.  Yes, I know it's possible someone like her exists in real life, but she is not recognizable as a type of person most of us would  know.  I've seen plenty of characters like her in movies...but none in real-life.

Burt (Krasinski) and Verona (Rudolph) visit Janney and her family when they realize that they need to find a place to settle down and be a family.  Verona, long orphaned, is pregnant and mostly alone in the world, except for her long-time boyfriend. She's an illustrator who could work anywhere. Burt has a bigger family, but his parents (Catherine O'Hara and Jeff Daniels) have just decided that they are going to make that long-dreamed-of move to Antwerp, Belgium...just in time to miss the birth of their grandchild.  No other family lives nearby...so Burt, whose insurance work could be done anywhere, feels he and his girl and soon-to-be daughter need to find a new city / climate to all home.  While they live in a very cold location and in a house that could be a shack...it's not just the physical location that's important.  Burt & Verona clearly feel somewhat lost with the responsibility they will soon face, and they are looking for an EXAMPLE to live near, a family to emulate.

The first family they try out is Janney's in Phoenix. (She's Verona's former boss from years before.)  Her anger is like poison, and Burt & Verona move on.  They briefly visit Verona's only sister in Tucson, before heading to Madison, Wisconsin to visit Burt's cousin and her family.  The cousin (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is looney, and Burt & Verona flee in fear.  And so it goes, through more families.

It's a movie about a journey, whether to various spots in North America or to a place of maturity and acceptance.  It is an admirable movie, in that it recognizes that starting a family is a sometimes daunting prospect...something worthy of contemplation and discussion.  But it also is quick to show us that all the intelligence, planning and love in the world don't guarantee success or happiness.  Thus, we get that most beloved of all ""indie movie vibes""...the funny but bittersweet vibe.

Director Sam Mendes (AMERICAN BEAUTY & REVOLUTIONARY ROAD) is a ""master"" at exposing the seething, angry unhappiness underneath the exterior of suburban, upper-class American life...whether in the `50s, `90s or today.  I put ""master"" in quotes, because his characters are becoming an archetype now...and to me, too often an archetype that doesn't ring true.  I VERY much enjoyed BEAUTY and I liked a lot of ROAD (and AWAY WE GO)...but it occurs to me, now that Mendes has a body of work, that he is only interested in looking at a type that I believe doesn't really exist all that much.  Couples in which both spouses are super smart AND super witty (how many couples do you know like that?).  And in which their every witty comment both hides and exposes their loathing of their spouse, their boredom with their lives and their feeling of superiority.  Again, I don't really know many people like that.  I consider myself middle-class, suburban-dwelling, married with kids and even fairly smart and occasionally witty.  Yet somehow, I am not filled with secret loathing for those like me. I don't hate my wife and regret my kids.  I don't yearn to live in Paris or to ""be free.""  So, I simply don't relate to many of Mendes' characters, but I don't feel that moment of ""ah ha...that's a lot like so-and-so.""  I  don't ask for characters like that when I watch STAR TREK or TRANSFORMERS...but when I see a film that is clearly attempting to hold a mirror up to reality, I want to feel that mirror is catching something relatable, and not just Hollywood's idea of the lives the rest of us lead.

But as a source of wonder and laughter, you should certainly enjoy the performance of Maggie Gyllenhaal, as a wife and mother (and trust-fund baby) who decorates the ""family bedroom"" with seahorses, because in the world of seahorses, the males give birth.  She also abhors strollers, because ""why would I want to push my babies away from me?""  I laughed and was creeped-out at the same time.  Good stuff.  (I was also glad to see Paul Schneider of LARS AND THE REAL GIRL and ALL THE REAL GIRLS...even though his part was underwritten.)

As I said at the beginning, all of this would be simply too much to stand for a full-length movie, were it not for the no-nonsense but sweet performances of Krasinski & Rudolph.  Krasinski (Jim from ""The Office"") brings the same loose charm and uptight fear that he brings to his TV performance.  He has hangdog good looks and a dry delivery.  But best of all, he is an actor unafraid of showing good, old-fashioned LOVE for his girl.  We can see how Burt loves Verona...how even when he's miffed at her, his love doesn't even quaver.  And Rudolph is terrific, alternating between fear and joy.  Toughness & softness.  And best of all, the two have real chemistry.  Some have said that Rudolph's performance is ""a revelation"" after her sketch work on Saturday Night Live...but if you look at many of her performances on that show, it should be no surprise that she is a natural at UNDERSTANDING and inhabiting a character...be it crazy Donatello Versace or Verona.

Although there is much to be bothered about in this film, Mendes' brisk direction (he's a good director who is interested in things I don't see the way he does) and especially the two stars make this a low-key charmer that I can recommend for adult audiences.",1245715200,6,6490,4.7757847533632285
3832494,4,B0021L8UOY,"The first time I saw the trailer for ""Away We Go"", the new film from director Sam Mendes, I laughed. A lot. When the director's name was revealed, my mouth dropped open.

I am not a huge fan of Mendes' last film ""Revolutionary Road"", starring Kate Winslett (who is married to Mendes) and Leonardo DiCaprio. But if you are a loyal reader, you already know this and there is no point in rehashing this.  Can I just say what a miserable experience it was to watch two people argue for two hours?

After I saw the trailer, I decided that Mendes decided to follow up an emotionally draining film like ""Revolutionary Road"" with this light hearted, contemporary, lower budget comedy to provide a change of pace, both for him and his audience. Now the only thing that would complete the package is for Mendes to give us each a free ticket to this new film, to provide us with a break from his emotionally draining film. To compensate us for the lost time and money, both of which were robbed from us.

Since that wasn't going to happen, I bought a ticket on my own.

Burt Farlander (John Krasinski, TV's ""The Office), an insurance salesman, and Verona De Tessant (Maya Rudolph, TV's ""Saturday Night Live""), an illustrator for medical textbooks, live in a ramshackle house near his parents. Mom (Catherine O'Hara), who seems to want to have the baby for Verona, and dad (Jeff Daniels) announce they are finally moving to Belgium for two years. It is the realization of a lifelong dream and they leave next month. The problem is the baby is due in three months; they will miss the birth of their grandson. But they are blissfully unaware. Shocked, Burt and Verona decide to visit their other family and friends, crisscrossing the continent, to find a place to live. Their first stop is in Arizona, where they visit Verona's old boss Lily (Allison Janney) and her husband Lowell (Jim Gaffigan), parents of two teens who will most definitely need a lot of therapy as adults, new fixtures at the Greyhound races in Arizona. They escape and travel to visit Verona's sister, Grace (Carmen Egojo) who works at a fancy resort. Continuing their travels, they visit people across the country, including LN (Maggie Gyllenhaal), an old family friend of Burt's and now has become the ultimate Earth Mother. Later they visit two old college friends in Montreal who have a happy life adopting children. But each of these people has problems, some more overt than others, and Burt and Verona continue to look for a new place to live, to nest, to set up their new family home.

Written by Dave Eggars (one of the founders of McSweeneys, working on his first screenplay) and Vendela Vida (an author also working on her first screenplay), the film tells the story of two people who are deeply in love and willing to face any obstacle life throws in their way. Some of these obstacles happen to contain very funny moments, poking sticks at some of the things many people hold dear. When these moments of laughter happen, they seem more genuine than a lot of comedies. And a lot of the credit for this lies in the screenplay. Sure, the story may seem a bit forced, but the journey Burt and Verona take seems completely natural because we have already learned a lot about these two characters and we can believe they would make these decisions.

Burt and Verona are each happy with their flexible jobs because they allow them time to do what they want when they want. This freedom allows them to live in a ramshackle house they call home. Burt suddenly decides he wants to take up whittling, so he can teach it to their new baby. They are basically two young people who don't have a lot of commitments and can live in a pretty free manner. When they learn there is a baby on the way, they decide they have to make some changes and one of those is to set up some roots, to raise their child. So they embark on this journey, traveling to different parts of the country, visiting family and friends to see where they might be able to set up a new house.

Another key factor in the success of ""Away We Go"" are the performances by John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph. Both are so natural, they almost seem to disappear into their roles, helping us forget we are watching two people in a film.

Maya Rudolph, last seen on ""Saturday Night Live"" doing impersonations of people like Oprah and Michele Obama, proves she has the acting chops to become a major star. She's always been funny, but in this film, she plays a very real person. I hesitate to say she is the ""straight man"" in the film, but Verona seems very believable and natural and she is the dramatic center of the story. Rudolph seems to melt into the role and often helps us forget we are watching an actress playing a role. It is a very good performance.

And Rudolph's character grounds the film. She and Burt are the dramatic center. This is necessary to help the film remain balanced because everyone they visit is crazy, funny and pretty broad. If everyone were too crazy, the story would resemble a bad sitcom.

John Krasinski plays Burt and does an equally fine job of making Burt seem real, human and interesting. Burt is funnier, a little more comedic, allowing Krasinski to interject some humor into the role. But this fits their relationship because Burt is less mature than Verona. She is naturally more serious and grounding.

As a pair, they are great, complementing each other. This only helps make their relationship see all the more natural.

And all of this ""natural"" helps to balance the craziness introduced by the colorful supporting characters.

First up? Catherine O'Hara and Jeff Daniels play Burt's mom and dad. Verona seems a little weary of them and as soon as they arrive at their house for dinner, we see why. Mom immediately sits Verona down and places her head on the tummy of the pregnant woman. She seems reluctant to move and would be happy to have her ear permanently attached to Verona's stomach.

Later, the couple travels to Arizona to make two stops. First, they visit Verona's old boss, Lily (Allison Janney) and her husband, Lowell (Jim Gaffigan) and their two kids. Janney is way over the top, but hilarious and it works. There is no way these two should have kids because they are so phenomenally screwed up themselves.

They next pay a visit to Grace (Carmen Egojo), Verona's sister. This segment is more balanced and thoughtful, helping to fill in information about Verona's family, giving her more depth.

The next stop is in Ann Arbor where they visit LN (Maggie Gyllenhaal), Burt's sort-of relative, a college professor who has become the ultimate Earth mother. It's funny stuff.

As ""Away We Go"" progresses, and we watch Burt and Verona progressing from one couple to the next, the story becomes episodic, almost like we are reading chapters in a book. In ""Go"", this technique works. As the young couple enter various tornadoes of emotion and activity, it seems only natural they will want to escape, will want to move on. It is also natural that we will want to do the same, so the episodic nature of the film gives us a quick jolt of laughter or drama and then a brief respite as the characters move on to their next destination.

""Away We Go"" works extremely well because Mendes seems to stand back, letting the story and characters go where they would naturally go. He doesn't meddle too much and this allows the actors to be natural, to make their characters believable and human. Gee. What a concept.",1245715200,7,7475,4.619442351168048
3832495,4,B0021L8UOY,"The ramshackle tone and episodic structure of this 2009 road dramedy doesn't scream Sam Mendes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Beauty/dp/B00003CWL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Beauty</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revolutionary-Road/dp/B0016Q2D66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revolutionary Road</a>) to me, but his filmmaking style becomes more discerning as the journey of the two protagonists deepens emotionally with each succeeding stop in their journey. Written by married authors and first-time screenwriters Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida (he owns ""826 Valencia"", the pirate store/writing workshop in San Francisco), the storyline focuses on Burt and Verona, a pair of thirty-somethings who seem to recognize their lost years of relative aimlessness are about to close with the birth of a baby. They look to be living comfortably (he's a bellowing insurance salesman, she's a medical reference illustrator) albeit in a rundown home close to his parents in Denver. When Burt's self-absorbed parents announce abruptly that they are moving to Antwerp before Verona's due date, the young couple recognizes an opportunity to travel cross-country to find a place they can settle down and start to develop roots.

Burt and Verona first journey to Phoenix and visit her former boss Lily, an acid-tongued harridan, and her defeated husband Lowell. One can only assume Lily has changed considerably since working with Verona, as I'm not clear why they would be drawn to such an unfiltered, alcoholic mess of a wife and mother. The couple immediately move on to nearby Tucson where Verona's younger sister Grace lives, and through their mutual memories of their deceased parents, we begin to understand Verona's hesitancy to marry. Burt and Verona then move on to Madison to meet his childhood friend Ellen, who has transformed into a smarmy New Age narcissist under the guise of a college professor who dubs herself ""LN"". The polarizing effect of her parenting skills pushes the young couple to Montreal where they reunite with seemingly contented college friends Tom and Munch, who have a rainbow tribe of children but slowly reveal a deep sense of melancholy over their existence. Their next-to-last stop is Miami to visit Burt's brother Courtney. His wife just left him, and he can't build the courage to tell his young daughter.

Relatable performances are crucial to this sort of character-driven venture, and fortunately, the leads score on that front. John Krasinski, Jim on the US version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Office/dp/B0024FAD9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Office</a>, is constantly upbeat as Burt, but he brings subtle shades of poignancy and resignation to avoid coming across as obnoxious. As Verona, Maya Rudolph makes a strong career transition from SNL sketch comic to straight actress, bringing a counterbalance of gravity and insecurity to the relationship. In the absence of manufactured friction, their comfortable interplay holds our interest while their journey evolves with unexpected turns until they find a deeper level of commitment on a trampoline. Surrounding them is a stellar cast of scene-stealers: a shrewish Catherine O'Hara and an avuncular Jeff Daniels as Burt's clueless parents, Allison Janney superbly inappropriate as Lily, comedian Jim Gaffigan looking forlorn and medicated as Lowell and Maggie Gyllenhaal hilariously hateful as LN, especially as she explains her progressive views on nursing and avoiding strollers. Comparatively subtle work comes from Carmen Ejogo as supportive sister Grace, Chris Messina and Melanie Lynskey quietly agonizing as the Montreal couple, and Paul Schneider as Courtney. It's good to see Mendes pull off a film that isn't defined as much by dark characters and polished production values. The change has really done him good.",1245196800,2,3954,5.935087719298245
3832496,5,B0021L8UOY,"Like all road pictures, AWAY WE GO is about a couple in their early thirties trying to discover themselves (and what kind of home and family they want to create for themselves) through a round of visits in the sixth month of the pregnancy.  I've never been a huge fan of Dave Eggers, but the script that he wrote with Vendela Vida is a brilliant one.  The structure of the film is simple:  Burt (THE OFFICE's Jim Krasinski) and Verona (SNL's Maya Rudolph) have moved to a small, cold house entirely so that they can live near Burt's parents.  But after learning that they will be moving to Antwerp a month before their baby is due, they realize that they don't need to live any longer in a town where they have no friends and, now, no relatives.  They plan a long trip that will see them visiting friends and relatives in a number of locations, including Scottsdale, Tucson, Montreal, and Miami.  They see people whose lives they would like to emulate and those they would not.

And along the way hilarity ensues.  The scenes between Burt and Verona are frequently hysterical, though when they are meeting their friends or relatives they tend to become ""straight men"" and the humor shifts over to the others.  Although several people are absolutely outstanding, two actors deserve special mention.  First, Allison Janney is absolutely hysterical as Verona's former boss in Chicago (more about Chicago in a second).  She is, putting it simply, a nightmare of a mother.  But in the most hysterical of ways.  (Now on Chicago.  Verona mentions working in Chicago and she is shown to be a medical illustrator.  This is not unconnected with Chicago; in fact, there is a direct correlation between medical illustration and Chicago, since the most important medical illustration program is at the University of Illinois at Chicago Medical School.  Odds are that if someone has studied medical illustration, they did it there.)  The second actor who stands out is Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays a college professor and old friend of Burt who and the embracer of more fringe and nutzoid ideas than one can imagine.  Her ideas, and those of her husband, are so absurd that given gentle, placid Burt can take no more.

But the major kudos have to go to Krasinski and Rudolph, who manage to create two characters we come to like a great deal and who we very much hope will come to understand precisely what they and where they want to have it.  This is an especially enjoyable film given the overwhelming amount of special effects fare at this time of the year.  This is an intelligent film that also manages to be very, very funny.  It is currently in somewhat limited release, but when you get a chance to see it, do so.",1244851200,56,2707,4.678646934460888
3832497,4,B0021L8UOY,"This was a different kind of road trip film. This movie thrives not on the main characters, but its fantastic supporting cast. As lead characters and expectant parents Burt and Verona travel across the country, trying to find a place to raise their family, their travels bring them face to face with their friends and family, and force them to contemplate their future as parents. It forces them to view life as adults, possibly for the first time.

I've been waiting a few months for this one. As it began, I thought that I wouldn't enjoy the film, but it really wins you over as it progresses. The glue to the movie is Alexi Murdoch's wonderful soundtrack. The songs are inserted in timely fashion throughout, and where they are inserted, they punctuate every scene. Sam Mendes (who I am a fan of) makes great use of every note from every song in this film.

There are elements of this movie that are probably best appreciated by parents, but it's one all adults could enjoy. It's not a must-see, but it's definitely worth seeing.",1244851200,4,1032,4.633879781420765
3832498,3,B0021L8UOY,"While infinitely more uplifting than his previous film, Sam Mendes' Away We Go doesn't exactly offer the complexities or dramatic discoveries one might expect from the accomplished director. It does, however, feature impressive performances from both leads, as well as a wide array of entertainingly bizarre depictions of the numerous disgruntled and eccentric people they encounter. The humor is subtle and often dry, but cleverly culled from the relatable unpredictability of life's many misadventures - plus the frequent bouts of unexpected vulgarity and foul language help to keep this quirky dramedy from souring during its more serious reflections.

Soon-to-be parents Burt Farlander (John Krasinski) and Verona De Tessant (Maya Rudolph) decide to travel across the country in an attempt to find the perfect place to start their family - fueled by Burt's parents' impulsive decision to move to Antwerp for two years. Visiting friends and relatives in Phoenix, Madison, Miami, and Montreal, Burt and Verona share in the triumphs and heartbreaks of others' lives and soon realize that ""home"" isn't about location at all.

Sticking considerably to offbeat conversations such as seahorse infatuations, the inevitable decimation of Tucson by the heat or the evils of ""separation, sugar and strollers,"" Away We Go isn't afraid to tackle a plot executed almost entirely by dialogue. It's quirky and humorous, but very deadpan, leaving the viewer with little more than the memory of some sardonically vulgar and idiosyncratic exchanges. A battle to be the most peculiar human beings exists as a contest between everyone except for Burt and Verona, and is practically the center of the plot. The other portion is devoted to doubt, unfairness and uncertainty for the wellbeing of their child, present mainly in Verona the pessimist (trying hard not to adopt the ""everything's already broken"" attitude), forcing Burt to play it positive.

The couple is encountering a midlife crisis, unsure of where to turn for support and guidance for raising a baby. It's not until they witness the extreme bizarreness of Verona's ex-boss, the selfish spontaneity of Burt's parents and the dilemma faced by his brother that they realize nothing is absolute and that their love and devotion will have to be sufficient. Away We Go is well mapped out, careful to humor without going overboard, but regularly the melancholy, sad music breaks up the funniness of chaotic everyday life. In their cross-country misadventures, Burt and Verona witness the extremes of whimsicality; the laughs follow easily from such abnormal characters, but no new ground is covered. By the conclusion, Away We Go is a simple comedy with nothing unique enough to separate it from the pack.

3832764,5,B0021L8UOY,"This movie is beautiful and brilliant, and the soundtrack makes it absolute perfection. Alexi Murdoch's songs perfectly complement the movie's wistful contemplation for home and family. The songs keep the movie mellow and thoughtful when the action of the story might be upsetting or life-altering for some of the secondary characters. The story moves along at an unhurried pace, but the changes in locale keep the viewer's interest as the movie moves from one vignette to another, with different groups of family and friends at each stop. I guess this is a romantic comedy, but it plays as more of a comedy than a romance, with Krasinski and Rudolph's easy comfortable chemistry drawing us in to their story as it progresses across North America and through the lives of their nearest and dearest. An excellent date-night movie, but even better for a married couple or group of friends. The writing is witty but doesn't seem overly aware of itself as witty, which adds to the charm. It leaves us wondering, if we could live anywhere, near anyone, where would we go, and why? Did I mention the music? Because the music is amazing.",1452384000,,1130,4.860103626943006

Burt and Veronica seem quite content leading a seemingly quiet life when surprise! They find out Veronica is pregnant. They live close to Burt's parents who inform them a few months before the birth that they are moving to another country. So the couple decides that they will take a road trip to find the support system that they think they need. They visit friends and family trying to find 'their place' leads them through families of dysfunction and different types of heartbreak for various reasons.

It's a quiet, quirky film with an often subtle humour. Mia Rudolph and John Krasinski are two of my favorites and I felt that they really worked well together. The both brought a unique honesty to the characters.

I don't know why this movie isn't more widely known, but I guess it's just not your typical blockbuster.  It's not slow and depressing the way some independent movies can tend to be, but neither is it a fast paced roller coaster.  It's just good.  It's just really good.

In this film, Verona gets pregnant and her boyfriend, Burt go across the country to find the perfect place to raise their unborn child. Along the way, they meet some very kooky friends and their long-lost family members. This film is directed by Sam Mendes who usually directs hard-hitting dramas so it was a nice surprise that he took on this project that he is so unique and offbeat. Away We Go is one film I will enjoy over and over again, I highly recommend it!",1343001600,,682,4.508064516129032
3833481,3,B0021L8UOY,"I am a fan of good comedies and independent smaller movies that are not about action and flashy special effects (which I also enjoy) but about looking closely at the characters, exploring the lives and desires of the ordinary people, and finding kindness, love, and gentle humor in every day situations. I like to follow the sympathetic characters on the journey of self-discovery and in search for the perfect place for them to live - just like the couple in Sam Mendes' comedy ""Away We Go"" 2009). Burt (John Krasinski) and Verona (Maya Rudolph) are 30-something educated, independent, intelligent, and what is quite unusual in the modern movies, truly loving each other unmarried couple who have been together for years and expecting their first child. The movie takes them on the road trip all around America. They leave Denver after having found out that Burt's cheerful and self-absorbed parents (Catherine O'Hara and Jeff Daniels) who live close by will be moving out of country to spend two years in Antwerp, Belgium and wont'be present at their grandchild's birth.

Burt and Verona will be visiting friends and relatives in Phoenix, Tucson, Madison, Montreal, and Miami trying to find the perfect place to raise their daughter and to be with the soul-mates. Sounds like a perfect independent comedy and fun, and I was ready to love it. After I finished watching, I see that it was supposed to be funny and touching, personal and realistic, subtle and offbeat, and it sure was at times but it did not completely succeed for me. I think it tried too hard. I found some of the characters not realistic and funny but obnoxious over the top cardboard figures, and some jokes felt awkward. The film looks nice - Sam Mendes has a good eye for American beauty and he brings it it in every film he has made, and Away We Go is not en exception.

Two main characters, expecting parents Burt and Verona as played by John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph are believable and likable even if not always interesting. There is a story behind Verona's constant refusal to get married even though Burt keeps insisting and she is in love with him and sees him as her soul-mate. I assume it has to do with the death of her parents and the memories of the true happiness and closeness she and her younger sister had with them. Even if there is more than decade since they are gone, she still copes with their absence from her life. I read that Dave Eggers, the writer of the script, was 21 and living in Lake Forest, Illinois when he lost both his parents to cancer five weeks apart, leaving Eggers to raise his 8-year-old brother, Christopher. I think that he wrote the script that caught Mendes's attention coming to terms with his own past and his loss.

The best, the most moving scenes of the film are these where Verona opens up and recalls the scene of pure happiness from her childhood. Another memorable scene for me was the ending of the film. Some can see it as melodramatic but I think it was an appropriate and fitting end to the journey in search for Home. Away we Go is not a bad movie but as the rather short road movie, it is abrupt and inconsistent - some characters that we meet and their stories are quite interesting but we don't have time enough to learn about them because away we go to the next destination of Burt's and Verona's journey.

3833574,5,B0021L8UOY,"I love romantic comedies, but with some trepidation I decided to watch this one because, to me, Maya Rudolph has always and only been the class clown on Saturday Night Live. To be sure, she's a talented class clown, but I was afraid this movie would be heavy on the comedy and light on the romance side of the equation. I was delightfully surprised and impressed with Maya's heart-warming performance. I think the last time I felt this surprised about a woman in a romantic comedy was with the young Liza Minnelli in The Sterile Cuckoo (which, actually, was a romance with tragic overtones). John Krasinski turns in a great performance, too. Actually, all of the actors are great.

Verona (Rudolph) and Burt (Krasinski) are made out to be the outliers in this story, but actually they are the most grounded of all the characters. The comedy is largely derived from the quirks of the characters that Verona and Burt interact with, though Burt adds a few endearing and comical quirks of his own. Since Verona is Maya Rudolph, I expected her character to be the most humorous, but in fact she is the most serious and introspective character in the bunch. Rudolph brings depth to her role, her character evinces a sense of quiet but deeply felt love, understated joy and passion, mixed with doubt, sadness, and vulnerability. Seeing Rudolph in this movie, I felt that she wasted far too much of her time and talent on Saturday Night Live. Krasinski's performance is equal to Rudolph's. Burt brings the yang to Verona's yin. While he is not immune to noticing the charms of other women, he convincingly portrays a man who is absolutely devoted to his woman, without being needy, controlling, or over-protective. It's rare and refreshing to see a man like this in a movie (the husband in Fargo comes to mind, too).

I have found that many of the good romantic comedies are lacking in the chemistry department. For example, Date Night is a wonderful romantic comedy, but there's not much chemistry between Steve Carell and Tina Fey. I make allowances for that, because I know how hard it is to generate that feeling of chemistry when there are so many comic elements. In my book, Date Night deserves four stars. But I'm giving five stars to Away We Go because it's a good romantic comedy AND it's got good chemistry between Verona and Burt. I feel like I could fall in love with Verona, and love and laughter makes for some pretty good chemistry. :-)",1335744000,2,2443,4.6923076923076925
3833575,4,B0021L8UOY,"Away You Go should not be as likable as it is. The dialogue is overly-written, desperately punchy. The indie soundtrack is too convenient: Golden Brown, the ditty you remember from the slow-mo finale of Brad Pitt's brutal fist-drawn ballet in Snatch is recycled during a painful dinner conversation. The direction, while colorful and efficient, lacks the panache of say, Road to Perdition or American Beauty, each neurotic couple emerging laboriously for examination, each sensual or disarming flaw exposed in soft close-up. Worse yet, Big Old Screen Clogging White Titles jump in now and then to chop things up. Generally, the whole film is droll and at times infuriatingly languid. At yet, Away We Go's whist manages to elevate everything. The 21st century American dream--perfected parenthood--is exquisitely satirized.
 Once things get going, you realize that every frame manages poignancy in some manner as the ever-stalwart couple (a fat and frolicsome Maya Rudolph and plucky, indefatigable John Krazinski) travel onward toward another intriguing relationship example. Sam Mendes' attitude toward the material seemingly improves at the midpoint. Or perhaps it is simply that road enlivens all. The secondary characters reveal themselves as shockingly insightful, thanks to a beautiful script by Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida.
 Reliably glum albino Jim Gaffigan makes a hilariously apocalyptic and timely rant about Phoenix--and the rest of the world's--water evaporating. Elsewhere, Maggie Gyllanhal is disturbingly plausible as a deranged New Wave mother, first seen breast-feeding a baby and a mortified redhead boy simultaneously. Chris Massina delivers an unsettling anecdote concerning the reason for his adoptions as his wife slowly oscillates on a pole in a strip club.
 Through the film, the dynamic duo at the center react with a convincing amount of cynicism, awe, and, during their time with Gyllanhal--undeniable disgust. Still, sometimes things get so awkward we aren't sure these characters actually knew one another before filming began. There is so much distance, obscurity and oddness at work that we are detached. It doesn't help that all is shot in subdued tones. And yet, the film is recommendable for its wise dialogue and pitch-perfect performances.",1333929600,2,2277,5.537356321839081
3833576,5,B0021L8UOY,"This movie simply perfect as an indie-style odyssey that first seems to have only a surface meaning but then delves into more complex human emotions. Each stage in the couple's journey is slightly like a different lesson, but they really knit together to form one woven view of life--American life, perhaps, but of the life and joys and issues and sadness people face every day in their lives and families. From the zany to the touching and the heartfelt, Away We Go is more about a couple searching around for a place/support system to have their baby. It's an unflinching, completely honest, exploration and examination of the roads in life, and the roads that lead us home.
I didn't want to give away any specifics, really, but this movie is absolutely excellent. It's in the same realm as Garden State. I think it's a perfectly made, quiet, unassuming and yet/therefore powerful odyssey that really, in the end, tells us something about life.",1330041600,2,946,4.845679012345679

3833579,5,B0021L8UOY,"In ""Away We Go"", young couple Burt and Verona, played by John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph, travel around the U.S. and Canada trying to pick a place to raise their soon-to-arrive first child. As Burt and Verona visit friends and relatives all around the continent, trying to decide which family they want to live near (they're really trying to pick out who their emotional support system will be in the immediate years to come), they see eye-opening and often hilarious examples of how exactly they don't want to raise their own children.

Sam Mendes directs a strong script by Dave Eggars and Vendela Vida, resulting in a film rich with laughs and smarts that will provide a perfectly enjoyable evening of home viewing.  If you like sharp writing and ensemble casts rich with small but memorable supporting roles (watch for Catherine O'Hara, Jeff Daniels, and Alison Janney), you can't go wrong here.

""Away We Go"" looked and sounded fine on the standard DVD I watched, which also included an engaging commentary track by the director and writers and a couple of short but interesting ""behind the scenes"" featurettes.",1321401600,,1116,4.925531914893617

3833581,5,B0021L8UOY,"The decision to have a child is probably no more fraught today than it ever has been. But young people now have so many choices - to delay children, space them and even forego them. ""Away We Go"" is a sweet and funny look at the worries and concerns that today's 30-somethings have when faced with having a child. John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph play a couple who unexpectedly find themselves expecting. Hoping to lean on their gadabout parents for housing and emotional support, they find themselves rebuffed. They embark on a cross-country search to find the right place to settle down. The journey puts them into contact with many parental types - from the airily abusive, to the hyper-granola, to the super-committed. And, along the way, they find themselves - as people, as a couple and as prospective parents. The craft of the movie ensures that that potentially gut-loosing clich actually fits and makes sense.

""Away We Go"" is smartly written, funny and poignant. It brought back memories of the days when my wife and I were at the other end of our childbearing years, wondering and worrying what kind  of parents we would be.",1316736000,2,1133,4.775510204081633

But this page is not only about the movie, but the disc and format it is presented in. As long as you don't get a cracked version, the DVD will present the movie in a way that does it justice. My suggestion would be to insert the disc in a clean and functioning player of DVDs, not a Beta Tape or VHS player, as these will not showcase the glory of the film contained on the digital disc. Don't break it like my mom did. It is not a CD, keep in mind and it should not be used as a frisbee. My mom understood ""Away We Go"" as documentary on the toilet factories in Bangladesh and subsequently broke the disc (thinking it was manufactured to spy on American citizens to get the scoop on bathroom usage and competitions) and flushed it down the loo.

3833628,4,B0021L8UOY,"`Away We Go' is a nice little film from Sam Mendes that manages to be both funny and poignant. This follows a couple, Burt and Verona, who are about to have a baby and who are looking for a place to bring it up and settle down as a family. They travel around various places in America and visit assorted friends in their search for a place to call home. This has great performances from the two lead actors and they have a great on-screen chemistry together. I found myself laughing out loud many times throughout and this is definitely one of those films with a quirky, kooky edge to it. This also has a indie film feel to it, which only adds to it overall and it also has a great soundtrack which adds to certain scenes and compliments it perfectly. Burt and Verona feel confused and lost in their lives and it is only by travelling around that they realise that others feel the same way they do and have their own individual issues and crosses to bear. This leads up to a satisfying conclusion and although it is a little predictable, it leaves a warm glow. This is an inoffensive, feel good movie and there is nothing wrong with that; I enjoyed it more than I thought I would and recommend it for a chilled out evening in.

John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph are a couple who are expecting and decide to search for the perfect place to bring up the child. So begins the road trip......
I thought this was easily one of the better movies that I have seen together, simply because the theme although familiar is remarkably fresh. The writing is by Dave Eggers and the movie cast are all superb performers.

3833630,5,B0021L8UOY,"I've been wanting to see this movie since the preview first aired, and I wasn't disappointed. I liked this movie (based on a Dave Egger's work) a great deal, because it reminded me (a little) about my own relationship.

At the beginning of this quirky movie, a couple -- Verona (a medical illustrator, played by Maya Rudolph) and Burt (an insurance futures salesman, played by John Krasinski) find out they're expecting a baby. The two leave their Chicago home to move closer to Burt's parents, for help raising the child.

Unexpectedly, Burt's parents decide to move oversea to Europe, and rent out their house, leaving Burt and Verona in the lurch without grandparents. Instead of getting upset -- the couple sees it as an opportunity to visit friends in different locations and decide the best place to raise their baby. They movie chronicles their journeys on train and plane to locations in America and Canada. Most of their friends are odd -- but the highlight was the hilarious Maggie Gyllenhaal's portrayal of a crazy young mother living off of a trust fund, and raising her children in an unconventional way.

Rudolph and Krasinski were believable as a couple, with a real chemistry and spark between the two, and a secret language that only couples speak to one another.

I'm surprised some reviewers feels the couple has a superiority complex, when the opposite is at play (in my opinion). At the beginning of the movie, Ruldoph asks (loosely quoted) Burt, ""Are we messed up"" Because they were living in a house, without heat and duck-taped plastic windows. Burt says,""No, honey we aren't messed up."" And Verona says, ""Yes, honey. I think we're messed up."" Burt also dropped out of college, and feels insecure when selling insurance to older men who have more money and more education than he does.

Anyway, I thought this movie was well worth watching. Although, slow moving, it pays off in the end",1291420800,,1910,4.846625766871166

Now that generation's children are crossing America attempting to find the best place to raise their expectant child. A young couple (Burt and Verona)live in a shack so they could be near his parents. (Her parents are dead.) They are expecting a child and find out that the parents are leaving. Since their jobs do not tie them to any location, they opt to go across America to visit family and friends in an attempt to find a suitable place to raise their girl.

The people are off beat and are certainly not people you want to raise kids around. They have to reject family and friend offers. Sometimes the parting is nice, sometimes not. The movie has sexual situations and bad language, but not just for the sake of having it. Burt has the propensity of using words incorrectly, i.e. he calls someone who carves wood a ""cobbler."" When they visit his parents we find out his dad has the same problem with word usage. The movie is clever, witty, funny, and has a heartwarming happy ending, even though they dragged it out.

3833685,3,B0021L8UOY,"The Social Review:

I first must disclose that I have a bit of a crush on Maya Rudolph. I think it's primarily because she's funny. I tend to like funny women, so that may taint this review.

Anyway, one of the things that really irked me about this movie was the fact that conveniently her parents are both dead. I say conveniently because we've seen this same song & dance with another biracial actress recently, Rashida Jones. They killed her parents off in I Love You, Man, which is kind of a big deal in a movie about a wedding. Hell, the bride's father typically pays for the wedding, right? The Root, briefly touched on this whitewashing in their article, Rashida Jones & The Hollywood Shuffle.

I feel race shouldn't be the issue in movies, but it should exist. They conveniently killed off her family for the sake of the movie. Both Rashida & Maya's race were the giant elephant in the room to me. At least in Away We Go, they did have a character ask if the baby would be Black in passing. Also, they gave Maya's character a sister in the form of Carmen Ejogo, but she was in and out of the movie in a blink. Plus, her skin seemed to be lighter than I had ever seen it and the character was supposed to be living in Arizona.

I guess I was just hoping for a slightly more diverse cast since one of the leads happened to be biracial. Black actors need some love, too. lol

The Entertainment Review:

It was weird watching the trailers & seeing the movie posters leading up to actually watching the film. Going into it, I really wasn't sure if this thing was a comedy or drama. I know the two leads are known for comedy, but the trailers left me with the impression that the movie was a drama with funny moments. It turned out to be a pretty straightforward comedy.

I saw it as a more realistic and funny Dumb & Dumber. I compare it to that movie because both of the lead characters seemed pretty vapid to me. I know the characters of Dumb & Dumber were full of life, but they were empty headed. These two leads seemed just as empty headed. Why are they living in an shack without heat? Why are they so concerned that his parents are going on a vacation? The soon to be grandparents weren't the sharpest pencils in the box, themselves. A couple in their early to mid-thirties that's expecting their first child decides to live like this? If they have the money to zig-zag across the country, why didn't they use this money for a decent place to live? Why does Maya not want to marry John, but feel he's good enough to be the father to her child? I wanted to shake the hell out of both Maya & John's characters at times.

The road trip that you witness throughout the rest of the movie is pretty funny, but the first couple they visit kind of steals the film. I never laughed harder than when Allison Janney & Jim Gaffigan's characters were on screen. Think Al & Peg Bundy uncensored with Peg on speed & Al drunk.

Overall it was a very entertaining movie, with a pretty dumb ending. When you see the ending the first thing you will say to yourself is probably, ""Why didn't they do that in the first place?""",1283644800,,3115,4.311111111111111

3833687,4,B0021L8UOY,"AWAY WE GO is an entertaining, funny film that offers some very fine actors little vignettes of character studies that makes this otherwise rather predictable story well worth the viewing.  Starting at the top, the film was deftly written by Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida and directed by the pro, Sam Mendes.  The story is rather simple: a young pregnant but not married couple Burt (John Krasinski) and Verona (Maya Rudolph) live in Chicago, too near parents (Catherine O'Hara and Jeff Daniels) and under the influence of Verona's wildly mad boss (Allison Janney), so when the idea of finding a place to raise a perfect family arises they are off and running to Montreal (where they visit the very bizarre couple Maggie Gyllenhaal and Josh Hamilton, steeped in the far out reaches of 'being natural' in everything), progressing on to Miami where they encounter the apparently happy family (but painfully bruised parents Chris Messina and Melanie Lynskey), and on to Tucson - searching for just the right place to be a family.  The hilarity of the situations they encounter is balanced by the realities of relationship building, making for a fine balance  of a story that could have been just another silly adventure.  It has some very strong acting and deals with current topics in a way that few films take the opportunity to address, and that alone is another reason to spend an evening with the Farlander's search for perfection!

It's about a love that is one feels and cannot and should not put into words. An experience that is so often fleeting, but will most certainly be remembered.

3833689,4,B0021L8UOY,"This was an entertaining movie about a young couple, in their 30's who find they are expecting a baby and set out to find a place to live and begin their family.  The acting was superb, with John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph playing the lead roles.  Allison Janney played the part of a ditsy friend down in Phoenix that was absolutely hilarious, a far cry from her sophisticated, in-control persona on The West Wing.  Another friend in Madison played by Maggie Gyllenhaal as a spacey, new-age mom also had us laughing.  The movie was one of their self discovery and getting a taste of what life might be like in a variety of different places in the U.S. and Canada.

I thought their self doubts and questioning of their lives and values was a good contrast to the many funny scenes in the movie.  I also liked the wardrobe for the characters. I really had to laugh at some of the mismatched outfits Burt showed up in, kind of like you'd expect a lot of guys to dress if they didn't have a lot of input from women, and Verona didn't seem like the type to be particularly concerned about wardrobe.

This was what I call a ""slice of life"" type of movie in that it explores a lot of situations and has a lot of entertaining moments but doesn't end up with a big finale or resolution.  It wasn't one of my favorite movies or anything but was very entertaining.",1280016000,,1353,4.362549800796812
3833690,4,B0021L8UOY,"Cleverly written, directed by Mendes in a way that shows he understands how to let the audience get the punchline in literate humor, with just enough slapstick -- verbal and otherwise -- to appeal to those who prefer their movies as entertainment you don't have to think too much about, Away We Go is a well-constructed diversion.

But if you do want to think too much you can see it as the product of two writers -- Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida -- who are exemplars of Gen X, the gang that would rather write about some guy writing a blog about running with the bulls, than write about running with the bulls. (Don't get me wrong -- the main characters' travels don't take them to Pamplona. That was just a general ""for example"" from your humble reviewer here.)

The over-the-top, exagerated characters that the main characters meet in their travels serve to let the mobile lovers -- one pregnant, one a ""nice guy"" -- appear to be above the boring and mundane things of life while living lives of the mind and of love. And as other reviewers have pointed out, they do seem to be in love -- a state that predisposes them to be sympathetic to some of those they meet who may be having personal problems, or are just not such a great fit in society.

But by the end I was wondering if the main characters themselves were such a great fit...

SPOILER ALERT!!!

...as they eventually wind up right back where they started, if not geographically, then certainly psychologically and emotionally, with only each other as support. This of course is right out of the lives of Eggers and Vida, two intensely private people who have done a quite remarkable job in keeping the gossip sites like Gawker and TMZ at a distance from themselves and their own lives. In the framework of the movie, the two main characters alone together at the end works as love triumphant. But if the real world were really completely full of such buffoons and misfits as those we've seen them visit in their travels, we'd all wind up being Romeos and Juliets. Some of us have, but many of us haven't. If you haven't and you look for yourself in Away We Go, I'm afraid you'll wind up looking into a funhouse mirror.

I am such a fan of the charm and style that John Krasinski brings to his performances and in this movie, most everyone would agree when Verona (Maya Rudolf) and her character's sister say how lucky she, Verona, is, as they look across the place at John. ""I know"", she says. Maya Rudolf is terrific, too, in this movie.  I loved it.

I have only one quibble with it and that is in its very last line, actually. I thought that one line really weakened and diminished the entire movie that had gone before it.

3833774,4,B0021L8UOY,"Months ago, I saw Away We Go in the movie theater and thought that it was cute and humorous in the way that made me smirk but not laugh out loud. I decided to watch the film again with my girlfriend who had not seen it. I am so thrilled that I did! Whatever I thought was lacking in my first viewing, I was able to better understand the second time I saw it.

The plot is simple. Burt (John Krasinski) and his girlfriend Verona (Maya Rudolph) are two thirty-somethings who believe that they have never exactly gotten their lives together. When Verona finds that she is pregnant, all of their insecurities are brought into the foreground. The couple believes that they cannot raise the child alone and therefore decide to travel across the country (and into Canada) to find a place near family or friends that feels like home to them. With each stop on their trip, Burt and Verona come to realize that there is no such thing as normalcy and that the best family is one that you make yourself.

I found the plot to be pretty predictable but that did not stop me from enjoying the film. Krasinski and Rudolph fit their characters perfectly! Their vignettes in various cities spotlight Jeff Daniels, Alison Janney, Jim Gaffigan, and Maggie Gyllenhaal each of whom do and exceptional job in depicting various views on parenthood. Though this film is not laugh out loud funny, I definitely giggled numerous times and smiled for almost the entire two hours. It is tender in all the ways a good movie should be. It shares many of the same themes that Juno does: pregnancy is not the end of the earth, in fact, it can help you find yourself and those you love.

A film about an expecting couple who tour the country looking for a place to settle down when they have their child, examining different types of parents as they go, Away We Go is not only notable for being one of the only movies I can think of that actually depicts a loving couple who don't either break up or get murdered by the third act, but also for the tenderness and love that Krasinski and Rudolph bring to their characters; not every sequence in Away We Go works, but it's a very sweet and likable film.

3833846,3,B0021L8UOY,"3.5 stars. Being a fan of Sam Mendes after ""American Beauty"" and ""Revolutionary Road"" I wanted to love this movie, but was left somewhat disappointed. It is a sweet movie with two main characters who are very realistic and likeable. While some movies have a nice balance of comedy and drama, this movie didn't feel like it succeeded fully with either.

Maya Rudolph (Saturday Night Live) and John Krasinski (The Office) star as a young couple who lack direction but have a baby on the way. After Burt (Krasinski) and Verona (Rudolph) find out his parents are moving to Europe for a couple years, they suddenly have no ties to where they currently live. Off they go in search of a new home, traveling to cities across the U.S. and Canada where they have friends, relatives, or other acquaintances. In each case the people they thought they knew turn out to be different than what they expected. The mother (played hilariously by Allison Janney) of a family in Phoenix turns out to be very crass and embarrassing. Friends in Montreal at first appear to have everything with a loving family with adopted children; soon Burt and Verona realize they too have their own problems.

It's clear Burt and Verona really love each other and make a cute couple who are easy to like. Anyone can sympathize with their concern that they might be failures, especially those who are making their first big steps in life. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what I found disappointing about the movie. The ending was sweet, the acting was good, and many of the characters were interesting because of how outrageous they were. Maybe too outrageous. Yes, everyone has encountered some people who are a bit strange, but the people Burt and Verona encounter all seem to be either crazy or pitiable. There are funny moments - especially one involving a stroller - but I wouldn't label this a comedy. At the same time it wasn't as heavy a drama as ""Revolutionary Road"".

Perhaps if we had more background on Burt and Verona or less skipping around from one group of friends/relatives to another, then the movie could've felt more consistent. I think the most promising section was when they were visiting his brother whose wife had left him. Burt showed some genuine emotion and his brother's situation led to the young couple confronting what things were really important to them.",1263340800,,2350,4.783251231527093

3833848,3,B0021L8UOY,"AWAY WE GO isn't a great movie but it is certainly entertaining. The story revolves around a thirty-something couple who are about to have their first child. When things don't go as planned, they decide to pull stakes and look for a new home. In its own way, AWAY WE GO reminded me of the Little Prince, who went from planet to planet, meeting strange new people. This couple's search unearths the odd, kind, bizarre, tragic, and confused, who unknowingly show the couple how normal they really are.

There are moments in AWAY WE GO that are very funny, and a few that are sad or touching. Most of the dialog is above average. All of the actors are credible and competent. Maya Rudolph, of SNL fame, is actually very good. The only other feature I've seen her in was Idiocracy, where she seemed to be playing a character more suited to Saturday Night Live. Here, she shows that she can play real characters instead of just caricatures.

The overall pacing of AWAY WE GO is a little slow, but it is still worth watching. I'd be reluctant to watch it twice, but I would if I had to. Three times is probably out of the question.  RECOMMENDED.",1262304000,6,1139,4.466346153846154

It doesn't look like they will ever get married, even as their daughter is just 3 months from coming to term. Verona cannot bring herself to marrying after the death of her parents. Burt is a real nice guy, just like Jim in The Office, but his parents are self-absorbed idiots who decide to relocate to Belgium just one month before their grand daughter's birth. This sends Burt and Verona on an odsessy to seek out a ""home"" for themselves. They feel the absence of family and seek out old ""friends"" and Verona's sister. They are looking for something throughout this movie: a sense of belonging and of home. The various loonies and tragic figures they meet along the way make this movie a bit of a commentary on modern life and all the accommodations people make to get along. This extra dimension is something I would expect from Dave Eggers, the co-writer of this script. His energy and outlook are extraordinary. I am a great admirer of his now that I've read a number of his books and understand his phenomenal outlook on ""the Word."" If literature has a future in America, he's it.

Why is it they cannot seem to make a movie for adults anymore without everyone spouting foul language left and right?  It's not funny, it's not intelligent or witty writing, it's simply lazy.  And for a female writer to descend to the same locker-room level as the ""boys"" is pathetic.  This movie could have and should have been so much better than this!

Lots of good laughs and fun in the goofy characters.  Then the last few minutes do in fact sneak up and floor you and left my wife and myself weeping during the credits.  And, it's not because of a twist, or false sentimentality, or, God forbid, a ""Love Story"" type ending.  Instead, we get a truly artful conclusion that elicits all kinds of emotions, as would a really well-crafted poem, heartfelt, but subtle and not at all manipulative.  John Krasinski gives a fine performance, but the real gem here, of course, is Maya Rudolph.  This is as good, wide-ranging, and skillful as any performance I've seen in a film in a few years.

3833992,4,B0021L8UOY,"Away We Go has good laughs, some serious drama at points, a few rather poignant moments--and great acting as well! The plot flows at a good pace; I was never bored although they could have edited out a couple of minutes here and there to make the story tighter and the action even better. The cinematography and the choreography are particularly strong which enhances the effect of this movie; and the script is very good. The casting is also quite good; these actors have you believing that they are the people they portray and that's grand.

When the film starts, we quickly meet Burt Farlander (John Krasinski) and his lover Verona (Maya Rudolph) who are expecting their first child. Although they are in their thirties they just aren't quite sure just how to properly raise their unborn daughter so that she will have the perfect childhood. Of course, this provides the reason for the young couple to travel all over the nation--and even Montreal--to find the picture perfect place to raise their soon to be born child. They could have stayed where they were but after Burt's parents Gloria (Catherine O'Hara) and Jerry (Jeff Daniels) drop the bombshell that they are selfishly going to live in Belgium for the next two years Burt and Verona really want to get out of there and explore.

And wow, how their trip yields funny and rather unexpected results! This may seem as if I'm giving too much away; but I assure you that I'm leaving out plenty so that you can enjoy this film. Suffice it to say that they meet other parents they thought they knew but who, in actuality, really don't have it together after all although one couple does seem to be pretty much ""on the ball."" Look for incredible performances by Allison Janney as Lili; Maggie Gyllenhaal as ""LN"" and Josh Hamilton as Roderick, ""LN's"" life partner. Chris Messina plays their Canadian friend Tom Garnett perfectly while Melanie Lynskey does a great job of playing Tom's wife Munch. Catherine O'Hara and Jeff Daniels are somewhat underutilized as Burt's parents and that's a disappointment but the rest of the casting works so well that I can pretty much overlook this.

Where will Burt and Verona finally end up having their child and starting this new chapter in their lives together? No answer here--watch and find out!

The DVD comes with a few extras. I particularly enjoyed the brief extra about how they went ""green"" during the production of the movie by recycling and using trucks that consumed less energy than regular gasoline. There's a ""making of"" featurette; and we get an optional feature commentary with director Sam Mendes, writer Dave Eggers and writer Vendela Vida.

Away We Go may not be the very best movie from 2009 but I wouldn't skip this either. There's great acting and the plot is interesting even if it is somewhat quirky. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in this film; and people who enjoy comedy with some drama thrown in will also want to add this to their collections.",1257811200,2,2985,4.74373795761079

3833996,5,B0021L8UOY,"My husband and I really liked this movie.  We were laughing and laughing until the couple got to Montreal, their fourth stop, and then we were in tears:  ""She had a miscarriage on Thursday.  Her fifth.""

Bert and Verona seem like us - late to have a child, still living in a cluttered rented house, asking, ""Are we F--K Ups?""  They arrive at the beautiful door of old friends and say, ""Wow, they seem so grown up.""  Those were my exact feelings on reconnecting with a childhood friend last winter who is FAR more established than us.  Our furniture is hand-me downs, unpainted pine shelves and dusty milk crates stuffed with reference books.  Every room in my friend's house looked decorated and cared for (but did she have books?  I don't recall).  Seeing it made me realize that I was still inhabiting this fantasy that I was still a graduate student...but then I realized that I am the age my mother was when I happened to be in middle school, so thus I am not young, just too poor to have a pretty decorated house with art on the walls.  At least the spines on my texts are colorful.

Bert and Verona have no roots - Verona's parents are dead, her sister lives in a different city, and Bert's parents are about to embark on their own journey abroad, in Belgium.  It is curious to me now to see that the concept of growing up and going away to college, leaving your family and your hometown behind, often leaves you with no roots at all if you keep traveling, after college, as I have.  It is an interesting idea, then, to decide in the sixth month of pregnancy to go visit one's old friends, as Bert and Verona do, to see if they'd like to settle near them.  It is a question I often ask myself...should I move back to California?  What about Portland?  What if we just moved back somewhere on the I-5 corridor, which would be more civilized than here?  How deep are my roots here after all, now that I have taught seven cohorts of 7th graders and my daughter is now four?

I really liked Bert and Verona and the way they made each other laugh, the way they comforted each other, and their subtle communication when they are guests in their friends' houses.  If they were real people, I would have no doubt that once their child was born, they would slowly gather back a community of other new parents.

This movie makes me remember the last days of my marriage before we became parents, and what people said to us.  Both ridiculous and moving.",1256947200,6,2448,4.3933333333333335

3833999,2,B0021L8UOY,"I read the script (published by Vintage; you can find it here on Amazon) and thought it was awful, but still decided to give the movie a chance. I'm glad I did - the actors gave 110%, and the movie was certainly better due to certain parts of the original script being cut. However--it still seems like the characters are never fully developed, with the exception of Verona--facing the ghosts of her past helps her become a more three-dimensional character. But by the end, I still didn't know Burt. The last 30 min of the movie, where he's angry that his sister-in-law has abandoned his brother and their child, seemed to only scratch the surface. I feel somewhat cheated. I saw someone post on IMDb somewhere that Burt's brother's story, in fact, would have been a better story to explore. Having seen the movie, I agree. Burt asks the question: What kind of mother would leave her child? Now that's an idea worth exploring. The actors who played Burt and Verona had nice chemistry, but the characters didn't seem to move past the whole lovey-dovey mushiness. Which can be fine, sure, but I feel that in order for me to care about this couple, they need to earn my attention--why should I care that they're together? The problem with mushiness is that it doesn't allow for any development on that end.",1256256000,11,1303,4.645021645021645
3834000,5,B0021L8UOY,"In a lot of romantic comedies of this type, the writer/director feels compelled to add an artificial element of tension - some misunderstood comment or perceived infidelity that causes the couple to fight, go their separate ways, then realize their follies and make up.  The beauty of this film is that there is nothing like that.  In the end, it's clear the movie makers know having a child and trying to find a home are tensions enough.  This is just a nicely paced, sweet movie that makes you feel happy and hopeful about life.  The main characters don't really fight or get angry - in fact, they consistently stick up for each other in the way everyone hopes their own spouses will.  I've read some reviews that say things like ""this is only for people who like Jim from 'The Office.'""  Maybe so, I like Jim's character and so does my wife, so I guess we're biased.  It's also nice to see Alison Janney, who is manic and hilarious in this film. Maya Rudolph also doesn't get enough credit, as her story about her father is lovingly told and her last line is great.  I highly recommend this film.

What they find out is that they don't really fit any of those places and they have to make their own way in the world. Excellent movie, one of the best of 2009.",1255219200,22,526,4.5473684210526315
3834023,5,B0021L8UOY,"I remember the night, almost eight years ago, when my pregnant wife and I were leaving the house for the hospital. We had so many big questions floating around in our heads. Would we be good parents? Could we handle this new step in our lives? What kind of life can we offer this child? I imagine these are the kind of questions, the two main characters have in Director, Sam Mendes' gentle, whimsical comedy, ""Away We Go"".

In this film we meet a thirty-ish, couple, who find themselves expecting their first child. Burt (John Krasinski) is a nervous dreamer with many questions about their future. He is offset by Verona (Maya Rudolph) who seems very grounded and takes their situation with a silent pragmatism.

The two, although gainfully employed, live the lifestyle of impoverished college students. After a hilariously uncomfortable visit with Burt's self-absorbed parents (Catherine O'Hara & Jeff Daniels) they come to realization, that something has to change as they go on to this next step in their lives. They need to find a real home for their soon-to-be born child and discover, what kind of parents they will be. Burt & Verona do this by going on a comical roadtrip to various cities (Phoenix, Madison, Miami, Montreal) visiting assorted friends and family, who offer up their eclectic lifestyles and forms of parenting as the way to go.

This film has a nicely written, smart script with an easy going feeling (by real life couple Dave Eggers & Vendela Vida), that gently pokes fun at parenting. The script is well anchored by its two lead actors. John Krasinski does a good job and is once again playing a funny, nice guy type of role (shades of NBC's ""The Office""). Maya Rudolph, on the other hand is a revelation as a fine actress (after years of doing wacky SNL skits), who brings a certain 'gravitas' to her character, Verona.

The two leads are backed up by an immensely talented, supporting cast of actors, who's characters really make the humor of this film. Some standouts include Alison Janney as Verona's loud mouth ex-boss, who seems to have no self-editing skills as she endlessly goes on about her family in a derogatory fashion. The woman is hilariously grotesque and you just want to slap her! The other standout is Maggie Gyllenhaal as Burt's insufferable ""Cousin"", LN, a college professor, who seems to have taken up every 'New Age', child rearing philosphy out there. To make matters worse, she is as condescending as h*ll towards anyone, who dosn't prescribe to her beliefs. (I love her anti-stroller screed where she says ""I LOVE my babies. Why would I want to PUSH them away from me?"") Others in the supporting cast include Jim Gaffigan, Catherine O'Hara, Jeff Daniels, Chris Messina, Melanie Lynskey, Paul Snieder. They are all terrific!

Finally I just want to mention the wonderful soundtrack featuring folk singer, Alexi Morton. His laid-back, easy going songs greatly adds to the  emotional feeling of the film. Loved this movie. Give ""Away We Go"" a try!",1254960000,,2997,4.85518590998043

However, there are stranger things in this world to wonder about.
  The movie is stuffed to the brim with awesome feel good moments. A few segments in this had me hitting the rewind so I could watch it over again it was so hilarious.

3834025,4,B0021L8UOY,"""The Making of Away We Go"" is a standard promotional featurette. Sam Mendes, John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph talk briefly about what drew them to the project. The actors liked the familiar shorthand between their characters. Mendes liked what he saw as the positive energy of the story and the two main characters. Everyone praises each other in this often fluffy love-in.

""Green Filmmaking"" takes a look at how this production was environmentally-friendly. Experts came in to supervise making the production less wasteful. Hopefully, other Hollywood productions will follow their lead.

Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Sam Mendes and screenwriters Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida. The screenplay was inspired by the anticipation of Eggers and Vida having their first child together back in 2005. The three participants talk about the tone of the film and juggling the comedy with the drama. Mendes talks about the look of the film and how he tried to evoke the films of Hal Ashby. The screenwriters say that they wrote Burt and Verona with Krasinski and Rudolph in mind.

3834026,2,B0021L8UOY,"I like many traveling, quirky, independent, romantic comedies, but `Away We Go' falls flat.  The only people who could enjoy this film are those who find Jim from `The Office' adorable.  While the movie is a good vehicle for the likeable, big-lug-of-a-guy, it really doesn't offer much else.

An early-30s, couple discover they are going to be parents and search for a good place to plant roots.  They bounce from family member to friends around the US and Canada.  After each stop, I was left wondering how two, fairly likeable characters resulted from such anoying dysfunction.

Sam Mendes direction offers pleasant sights and sounds through their travels.  The film tries to fit somewhere in `The Graduate', `Flirting with Disaster' realm. Unlike those enjoyable movies, `AWG' presents characters who become less interesting as the film progresses.  The comedic moments seem forced and the `crazy' characters are FAR too over-the-top.

As I hit my 40s, my taste in young, romantic comedy may be dated.  Perhaps, I'm beginning to lose touch with the post-genXers.  But, if this is what passes for modern romantic comedy, maybe I've officially moved into a different stage of my life.",1254700800,7,1185,5.119791666666667

It's amazing to have such a wonderful cast- Jeff Bridges, Catherine O'Hara, Allison Janney (wow), and Maggie Gyllenhaal (super wow). Now, John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph are good and we have seen them on TV. It's easy to pull off funny on the screen but how about drama. Kransinski really showed his acting chops with the scene where he shares his doubts on parenthood on the trampoline. Rudolph does the same in the ending where her last line was dead-on about the future. I absolutely love the quirkiness of all the characters in each episode. Some may have issues with the constant episode shifting from Phoenix, AZ to Miami, FL to Madison, WI to .... You get the point and it's just one way for Mendes to reflect on how many kooky people that we probably connected with whether out of default- family (brother, parents, sister) or just out of relations (weird ""cousin""). It's amazing to find such drama in comedic moments but it works in this film. My favorite episodes are with Janney and Gyllenhaal who give a whole new meaning to jovial good-nature and uber-hippie/yuppie folks, respectively.

The DVD has great extras including the ""making the film"" short. Mendes explained how he made the film and the actors really dish out how it was put together. You realize that it's rare that a director prepares so much and lets the actors really contribute. It's certainly worth a watch and recommend everyone to at least watch the extras after the flick. I have to admit that it was a slow start. I watched 10 minutes on Fri night and turned in early since nothing really happened. I was going to return back to Blockbuster since I went rock-climbing at nearby state park. I am glad that I gave it a second chance Sun morning. Enjoy...",1254614400,,1787,4.6372239747634065
3834028,4,B0021L8UOY,"Burt (John Krasinski) and Verona (Maya Rudolph) are an unmarried couple in their early 30s who are expecting their first baby.  The two are bright but not terribly successful, as witnessed by their ramshackle house which pops a fuse whenever they turn on a space heater.  However, they're very excited about the upcoming birth and will obviously make terrific parents.  When they find out that Burt's parents, who live nearby, will be out of the country for the next two years, they decided to pull up roots and find a new place to live, preferably someplace near loved ones or close friends.  They embark on a cross-country trip to try out some of these locations - first Phoenix, then on to Madison and Montreal, with an unexpected trip to Miami.  At each destination, they discover more about themselves and about how they will be as parents.

Director Sam Mendes has done some stellar dramas (""Revolutionary Road,"" ""American Beauty,"" ""Jarhead,"" and ""Road to Perdition""), but he's done little true comedy.  Plus, his recent work has tended to be overly repressed and somewhat stilted, so I approached ""Away We Go"" with some trepidation.  The trailer made it look like an overly hip indie comedy in the vein of ""Juno.""  Indeed, I think that's what they were going for here.  The comedy at times does feel a bit ""set up,"" and I could see some of the punchlines from miles away, but I still ended up liking ""Away We Go"" more than I anticipated.  The primary reason I enjoyed ""Away We Go"" was the film's rather genial tone, which is mostly due to the fantastic chemistry between Krasinski and Rudolph.

I've long been a fan of Krasinski's work on ""The Office,"" and it's nice to see him create a new lead character.  Rudolph was sorely underused on ""Saturday Night Live"" and her few supporting movie roles, so I'm pleased to see her in a lead.  She's really fantastic here and totally embodies the character.  I hope this results in more leading roles for her.  The supporting cast is filled with funny turns by some of the best comedians, especially Maggie Gyllenhaal who is hilarious as a spacey professor with a hatred of strollers and Allison Janney who scores as a foul-mouthed suburban mom.  If you like quirky romantic comedies, then you're probably going to like ""Away We Go.""  The movie doesn't really offer anything new, but it's generally sweet-natured and offers some genuine laughs.",1254528000,,2393,4.781021897810219
3834029,4,B0021L8UOY,"As is common in many indie films, there is too much music in the soundtrack, to the point that it almost drowns out the dialogue at times.  Also, there's no good reason for some of the profanity--not that I am prudish, but it feels lazy to me when writers resort to profanity for no particular reason.

Otherwise, Rudolph and Krasinski do a fine job as a young couple, Verona and Burt, who at least have the sense to realize that they are imperfect.  The other couples they visit are not as cognizant of their own flaws, especially the annoying and cloying yet somehow superior/contemptuous LN (a superb Maggie Gyllenhaal) and her husband.  No matter where the couple goes, they can never quite find a place that feels like home until the end, when they go back to a place that Verona has not seen in many years.

Director Mendes does much better work here than he did with Revolutionary Road.",1254355200,,893,4.55625
3834030,4,B0021L8UOY,"So much has changed that the house with a white picket fence, a 2 car garage and a dog is no longer the dream of adulthood for everyone.  Verona and Burt are having a baby, and now they need to find a place for their family.  Hilarity ensues as these two travel across the country looking for their perfect home.  The quirky couple reconnect with old friends and family across the US and Canada in order to find their niche.  Each city and each family is so unique, Burt and Verona (as well as us) get to see the full spectrum of family and home.

Krasinski and Rudolph work well together.  Their relationship feels real, and they are so endearing!  Catherine O'Hara and Jeff Daniels were funny, but underutilized; they could have easily had more screen time.  Allison Janney and Jim Gaffigan were hilariously perfect together, although Janney stole the scene.  Maggie Gyllenhaal was very funny, and convincing, as the New Age momma.  Overall a wonderful cast that truly added to the film.  The script was well written (although I guessed the ending, so it was predictable).  As the film progresses, the humor gives way to real pain and sadness.  The ending is perfect, but it is bittersweet.

I think this is a great quirky, indie film.  It should please all those looking for something unusual. It will make you laugh, and also cringe with embarassment for the characters on screen.  Does it go far enough?  Not for me, but I did enjoy this film.  Some things still felt a little clich, but the story and the relationships were deep and satisfying.

And for those of you concerned about the reality of Burt being an insurance salesman, who looks ""unprofessional,"" I am pretty sure he works via his cell phone.  Both Burt and Verona work from home, and their home does not look great, so maybe they have money saved up allowing them to travel.",1254268800,,1844,4.615384615384615
3834031,2,B0021L8UOY,"It's an Indie film yes, what else do you think Jeff Daniels (from the awesome Indie The Squid and the Whale fame) is doing here in a pipsqueak role.

I'm a big fan of the director. Away We Go is a film based on two characters who're not going to marry each other just yet but are having a baby. Very indecisive. On not such a trademarkable side note, I have noticed Sam Mendes is making films in which women drive the relationship more so than the man, the man takes a backseat being patient and about as kind-hearted and ""go with the flow"" nice as they might come. The guy from the tv show ""the office"" is a great actor, he's the saving grace of the film. Let me examine or try to exemplify why I gave this film two stars, I strongly suggest you steer clear from this film.

Not a bad cast. Just a particularly unmoving subject. I can understand the first time parent's dilemma and the
importance of this film and how expectant parents might relate but even this and even then, it's a particularly useless film that lacks flavor, insight, character growth, good humor, people you can relate with and I lost interest within fifty minutes.

First, Revolutionary Road, now this, I really don't know what Mr. Mendes is trying to achieve but he's losing out on some of his fans (like me) who think he made the best film they've seen. American Beauty.

Verdict : bad direction",1254182400,5,1371,4.407114624505929
3834052,4,B0021L8UOY,"Academy Award-winning director Sam Mendes' follow-up to his terrific Revolutionary Road is a much different film from Mendes' previous efforts. This is his fifth film as a director and it is his most simplistic in terms of filmmaking style. You won't find the lavish production values that have characterized his previous films in Away We Go. In fact, this film shares more characteristics with independent dramas like The Squid & the Whale then it does with his previous movies.

Burt Farlander (John Krasinski) and Verona (Maya Rudolph) are a 30-something couple expecting their first child together. When the two go visit Burt's parents (played by Jeff Daniels and Catherine O'Hara), they find out about their plans to move to Belgium a month before the child is born. With the realization that their child's grandparents aren't going to be around, Burt and Verona wonder if they shouldn't look at their other options for a place to raise a child.

This is where the film turns into a ""road movie"" and it's these scenes that feature sharp, comedic turns by Allison Janney and Maggie Gyllenhaal (neither are strangers to comedy, but both stand out here).

This film, with its tone and comedic style, is very reminiscent of films by Wes Anderon and Noah Baumbach, but mostly just the typical ""indie drama"" in general. At the heart of it, it's a comedy but it doesn't rely on cheap gags and staged hilarity opting instead to find humor in the everyday lives and situations of real people dealing with real situations. With the exception of a few choice scenes, the humor has a very subtle tone to it that may lead some people to conclude that it's not even a comedy.

Away We Go is not a profound film like some may expect. The film simply deals with Burt and Verona coping with their upcoming parenthood and learning, over the course of the road trip, about themselves. The character's have no profound revelations in the movie, but simply learn about themselves as we watch and learn along with them. What sets Away We Go apart from films like it is good writing and smart choices by the director. Husband and wife team Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida have written a script with very likeable characters and (at least with Burt and Verona) realistic, down-to-earth character's that one can sympathize with. Furthermore, the banter between Burt and Verona doesn't hide behind anything Hollywood. Their dialogue with each other is essentially no different from the average, mid-30s couple...

The casting of Burt and Verona were very good calls. Rudolph was an SNL cast member but I have not seen any of her previous work. Here, she captures the sweetness and vulnerability of her character and shows strong potential in doing even more dramatic work. Krasinski, as the supportive boyfriend, is a perfect fit for his role as well. I do have some issues with the style and facial hair his character has, considering he sells insurance...But we can let the little things go, can't we? In casting Rudolph and Krasinski, Mendes has given his film a warmer feel to it. Neither actor looks like the Hollywood type. Both are attractive, but they look like average, everyday people and it makes it much easier to follow their story and relate to them. And there is a definite chemistry between the two actors.

Away We Go is not a profound cinematic experience. It's got all the characteristics of the indie-drama from the unconventional characters to the folk-music score to the episodic way the movie unfolds. My biggest complaint about the film is that it doesn't try to break away from this set-up. I applaud the film however for not trying to overcomplicate its simplistic story with cinematic clichs. Away We Go has been called one of the best films of the year and I think it really might've been had it broken away from the constrains of the ""indie drama,"" but it does have a lot going for it and it left me with a smile on my face. It's a small, sweet film that will entertain you and for that, it's worth watching.

3834053,5,B0021L8UOY,"What a delightful surprise this movie was! It seems that director Sam Mendes can't do any wrong. Having helmed the critically acclaimed ""American Beauty"" (1999), ""Road to Perdition"" (2002), ""Jarhead"" (2005), and ""Revolutionary Road"" (2008), Mendes really took a detour with ""Away We Go,"" generating a smart and charming film, filled with funny and witty dialogue.

Burt Farlander (John  Krasinski) and Verona De Tessant  (Maya Rudolph), are a happily unmarried couple, waiting for the birth of their first child. One day, while visiting Burt's parents (Catherine O'Hara, Jeff Daniels), they inform Burt and Verona that they are planning to move to Belgium one month before their grandchild is born. This, of course, upsets Burt and Verona. Thus, they also decide to move to a different city. After all, they were living there just because of the proximity of Burt's parents. They decide to do some exploratory visits to some of the cities where some of their friends and relatives live, and gather first-hand information about which place is the best to move to.

Burt and Verona's first stop is Phoenix, where Lily (a very funny Allison Janney), one Verona's friends, lives. Lily and her husband Lowell (Jim Gaffigan) paint a bleak picture about life in that city. From there, they also visit Tucson, Madison, Montral and Miami, and in each of those places we witness some hilarious moments. Each of these stops also teaches Burt and Verone about the nature of happiness and what the important things in life are.

""Away We Go"" is a little gem that deserves a second chance for those who missed it the first time. It is fine, fun filmmaking by one of the best directors in current times. The film also stars Maggie Gyllenhaal. The DVD includes commentaries by Mendes and writers Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida, making-of documentary, and a feature about ""green"" filmmaking.

I casually watch the office and SNL, so I was familiar with both lead actors, John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph. Seeing the preview on the movie, they totally seemed like a real life normal couple. I was worried the movie would progress and they'd start to hate each other -- like some indie coming of age dark movie. But no! It was lighthearted, cute, funny, and real.

This sets Bert and Verona off to thinking that maybe they should move somewhere different and start a new life themselves. So off they go, first to Phoenix, then Tucson, and up to Montreal before eventually landing in Miami. This journey takes them on a comical tour of their past as they meet old friends or family members whom they haven't seen for years. But the road trip doesn't end there as no place has yet seemed like home so off they go again.

3834057,5,B0021L8UOY,"It's no surprise that one of the best movies of the year so far isn't your run-of-the-mill summer blockbuster. Director Sam Mendes last dazzled with the depressing-but-mesmerizing film adaptation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revolutionary-Road/dp/B0016Q2D66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revolutionary Road</a>, but now takes the other route, shifting more towards comedy with a script written by the awesome husband-and-wife team of Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida.

The story follows a thirty-something unmarried-but-committed couple (John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph) who are expecting their first baby. With the revelation that they no longer have to stay in a place where they are not happy, they decide to travel to various locations to try and find a place to settle down. They visit friends as well as family (Ejogo, Schneider) in their search for a home. However, along the way, they discover the fears within themselves that initially drove them away from their first home.

Many reviewers have said that the characters -- played brilliantly by Krasinski (of TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Office-Seasons-1-5/dp/B002BFBB1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Office: Seasons 1-5</a>) and ""SNL"" alum Rudolph -- are self-righteous and condescending. I couldn't disagree more. The characters are self-appointed ""screw-ups"" and are merely looking for a place in the world to call their own where they can raise their expectant baby. They do make the mistake that most make: trying to fit in somewhere based on proximity to loved ones (family, friends). But it is through their journey in this film that they realize that ""home"" is where you feel comfortable. I enjoyed the fact that not only did the characters recognize their fears but were able to talk them through in a way that only extraordinary writer Eggers could convey. It is an entertaining, slightly comedic dialogue, keeping the audience from falling asleep or rolling their eyes out of a trite attempt at realism. I also liked the way the film ended - not with a Hollywood formulaic resolution but a bit open-ended -- the general way life can be.

The cast is extraordinary, which usually doesn't mean much (i.e.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Synecdoche-New-York/dp/B001P3SA8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Synecdoche New York</a>). However, in this instance, they all shine and the movie excels because of it. The three couples that the protagonists visit are wonderfully brought to life by Allison Janney and Jim Gaffigan, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Josh Hamilton, and Chris Messina and Melanie Lynskey. And the sister to Rudolph (Carmen Ejogo) and brother to Krasinski (Paul Schneider, who I think should've been cast as Krasinski's brother a long time ago - in ""The Office"" - because they look like they could be brothers) shine in brief but important roles.

""Away We Go"" ranks up there among the few best films I've seen so far this year. I would say go see it without even watching the trailer for it. But, either way, just see it.",1249776000,,3135,5.764578833693305
3834058,5,B0021L8UOY,"American Beauty is one of my favorite movies. I liked last year's Revolutionary Road. Sam Mendes returns this year with a movie quite different than those two - a movie that actually has a happy couple at the forefront. Krasinski and Rudolph are brilliant as Burt and Verona, a couple (never married, never will) who have discovered they are pregnant, and set out to find the perfect place to raise a family. This is a road trip type movie, as the couple bounce around the country, and even into Canada, visiting friends, old coworkers, family members, all hoping something jumps out at them as the answer of where they are supposed to settle down.

The film is an odyssey of sorts, as each destination the couple visits represents something the two are trying to avoid once they settle down. The supporting characters are brilliant and the stories these characters tell pack an emotional wallop. You really start to root for Burt and Verona, and become invested in their choice of where to settle. I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say if I didn't like the ending, I wouldn't be giving this movie four stars. **** of ****.

3834059,4,B0021L8UOY,"At the butt-end of last year Sam Mendes directed a film called Revolutionary Road.  This was a masterpiece, truly deserving of that title.  It's his best film hands down!  His previous films American Beauty and Road To Perdition weren't too shabby either.  They all have a sense of darkness and foreboading.  The dark foreboading element is missing from his current film Away We Go, and that is not a bad thing.

The basic set-up is simple and understandable in that movie universe sort of way, but two winning performances from leads Mya Rudolph and Chris Krisinski really help this thing over some of the comedy set-up trappings.  Rudolph is an actress that I've known from SNL and that's it, I've not seen here in anything else.  Surprisingly, she ends up playing straight-man to Krisinski.  And you she gives a very touching and honest performance, and I see a great career outside anything resembling comedy in her future.  Krisinski is an actor I've never seen in anything.  I've been informed that he is one of the stars of the American version of The Office, and he, like Rudolph, is someone I want to see more of.  He plays affable in this film like a pro.  He's an optimist and a realist all in one heartwarming stroke.  He's the goofier of the couple but it comes off more like it's part of his character and his personality and less like comedy schtick.  Together I would watch any film premise about this pairing.

This is a real couple, not a made up movie couple.  This is my favorite part of this film.  The plot is cute and similar to that of the great film Flirting With Disaster, but the unmarried leads make this film above average.  They don't have silly, pointless and melodramatic arguments to up the conflict factor most these type of films contrive for the sheer 'entertainment' value.  Sorry, folks, this is about real people not the cyphers that make up the world of most sitcoms and Rom-Coms.
The first and one of the best examples I can conjur up in regard to this point is an early scene of the couple driving to Krisinski's parents' house(played hysterically but briefly by Jeff Daneiels and Catherine O'Hara).  Krisinski, who sells insurance by phone, gets a call from a client and puts on an obnoxious 'offcial business' voice that irritates Rudolph.  She pulls over the car and gently steps out.  He catches up to her and they flirt.  There's no silly argument of the two complaining about themselves.  They know each other so well and truly love each other to the point that they know each others' faults, quirks and everything in between.  This is what it is like to truly know, understand and love each other.  Little touches like this really make this film rise abvove the rest.

This is a road movie so we meet various other side characters that help emphasise and illustrate versions of family life and modern couplings.  We get some great cameo by Maggie Gyllenhal as a very liber4al new-agey type who supplies some o the film's funniest situational comedy.  Most of the humor comes from an honest place and not joke set-ups.  Not all of the humor, but most.  The constant change in locale is a comedy contrivance in itself but we forgive it because the characters are so engaging and real.

The film is not without its flaws.  The premise is a bit obvious and basically negligiable.  The final emotional conclusions are obvious long before they arrive, but they are executed and performed so flawlessly it's easy to forgive this flaw.

I'm happy to see Mendes broaden inot this territory.  It's not as dark, and it's not about miserable people, but rather real people.  They are self-proclaimed ""F@#$CK ups"".  It's a story of late bloomers.  They're just making it and fitting the pieces together a little slower then the rest of us.  No big career destinations, no big dreams, they're just living their lives and loving each other honestly.  It's quite lovely.  Starting their unexpected family is as natural to them as never becoming a wedded couple.  This is life, but rather contrived in a more entertaining movie way.",1247356800,22,4064,4.7116477272727275

Burt and Verona are a slighty left of center pair seeking their place in the world. The first half of the movie focuses on their trips to Arizona and Wisconsin, where they encounter exactly the type of families that they don't want to be. The scenes here are hilarious and among the high points of the movie.

In the second half they visit families in Montreal and Miami who are more likeable and sympathetic. But still dealing with the hard circumstances that can come with marriage and kids.

3834061,5,B0021L8UOY,"I can't wait until I'm thirty and watching this movie again, maybe rediscovering it, as I did with the movie Kicking and Screaming (1995)(the Noah Baumbach version, not the Will Ferrel film).  When I first watched Kicking and Screaming I thought it was an interesting movie, but I was kind of dissapointed, and thought it was just average, I was thirteen at the time, it was two thousand one or two thousand two.  Then, seven years later, I bought it again, because i found it on sale, and it felt like it was a display of the feelings I was having at that time in my life.  It became a powerful and true film, with a resonating importance.

This film, I can appreciate a lot more, because I have friends like Verona and Burt who are in their mid twenties, a couple in their late twenties, who are starting to try and plan their lives, figure out who they are, and for them, this film was revelatory.  The girls cried their eyes out, the boys bit their upper lips, at that special renewal scene that you'll recognize when you see it.  They laughed hard, they felt it hit home, because they've asked each other the same question--I've asked my girlfriend occasionally the same question--""Are we screw ups?"" (They don't actually use the word screw up in the film), and my friends and I usually ask, ""Are we going to be screw ups."" But again, we're in our twenties, Burt and Verona are in their thirties.

Burt and Verona take this road trip, after Burt's selfish, somewhat narcississtic parents, decide to go to Antwerp a month before the babies going to be born.  This the presence of grand parents were the one reason they were staying where they were staying, they decide that--with both of them having jobs they can do on the road, and anywhere they decide to land--they can go and find their dream life.  Written by--for me and my friends--the literary equivalent of Brad and Angelina, Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida, this film is perfection.  My generations greatest director, Sam Mendes, helming this ship, makes the film a must see for everyone.

Filled with hilarious one liners, impressive acting from two people who have been known for the dumber roles they play, this is impressive.  At points melancholy, at other points hilarious, this movie draws you in, and holds your attention, until you don't want it to end.

They meet Jany, who I'm sure, we've all met, the woman dissapointed with her life, her family, her friends, and has no problem making a joke about it, hoping people think she's just being funny, when in reality, everyone knows she's at the brink of tears.  Then you have LN, who, if you've ever been on a college campus for awhile, you're sure to have met.  She's a trustfund baby, whose become an earth mother, with all these weird ideas on child rearing.  Played by Maggie Gyllenhal, one of my favorite actresses, she did wonderful for such a short period on screen.  In Ontario, their college friends, which includes Two and a Half Men's favorite stalker, Rose, as a sullen adopted mother, who, along with her husband, are happy for their life, but dissapointed for their own painful reasons... it's a very powerful scene, from an actresses you wouldn't think capable of a powerful scene.

When I'm thirty, when my firends are in their thirties, we may look at this film as a current chronology of our existence, of a feeling of our longing and worries, and hopes.  We may see our selves as the characters of dysfunction, or as the loving hopefulls that Verona and Burt are.  We may see this movie completely differently, see it truer than we do now.
