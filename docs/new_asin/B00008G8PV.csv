1846254,2,B00008G8PV,No one should go broke to buy an entire series on DVD. Even a $10 drop in the price would make thus a more appealing purchase --especially since the local Blockbusters will almost certainly sell previously viewed copies of this series in about 3 months (as they did with S1),1087603200,,274,4.5
1846255,4,B00008G8PV,"Strange to think that it's now cheaper to buy the entire set than each DVD indivudualy. Shame, too, because the second half of season two stinks. I'll still buy it, though, because I have no shame. Have a feeling that sales of the ""volume"" style discs will slow down considerably for the rest of the seasons. I know I waited till 2 came out in a box set, and I'll do the same for season four and five. Season three also stinks, so I think I'll pass.",1087603200,,449,4.172413793103448
1846256,4,B00008G8PV,Now I will not buy season three piece by piece as I just did season two to the tune of $117. I will just wait until it gets released at a fraction of the cost just like season two.

1846257,5,B00008G8PV,"Season 2 of Andromeda is a great season, some fillers, but very good for the most part.  This box set should appeal to the Andromeda fan, it is  four very good episodes and the usual amount of nice amount of extras.  Now for some clarification, the listing of episodes on Amazon is not right, I have already sent a e-mail out to them about it.  This volume contains 4 episodes, much like the second and later volumes of the first season.  The Episodes are ""All to Human"", ""Una Salus Victus"", ""Home Fires"" and ""Into the Labyrinth""
  All four of these episodes are great by themsleves, however ""All to Human"" and ""Una Salus Victus"" are my favorites on the set.  In the first Rommie is kicking some serious tail and taking the names, shows a lot of emotion also.  Some history of after the fall is even shown to name a few things.  I like ""Una"" because it shows a clear shift in the story line, Tyr reveals a huge secret that puts a rift between him and Dylan.  This show also reveals Tyr to be much more than a mere mercenie from the first season.  Like I said, all four are great, mainly because each character grows some and reveals they are capable of much more than what has been shown so far.
  As with the other sets, picture is very good, menus are easy to navigate, extras a decent and the packaging is simple but elegant.  I wish that other Box sets would take a clue from these, very few sci fi tv shows get attentionto detail that these box sets got.  I have both Babylon 5 box sets and the picture for Andromeda is better, so the bigger name does not always mean better.  I give credit to the writers of the show for making the first 9 episodes of season 2 very good, Andromeda fans should like this.  New people to the show will be confused, but like it.",1056153600,3,1765,4.265060240963855

1846264,4,B00008G8PV,"Great price to continue watching what I felt was Gene Roddenberry's best non StarTrek storylines. I bought the first season on  EBay years ago, and was left hanging at the season finale. I had followed the entire series and was kind of disappointed at the way the storyline twisted by mid-season three, but saw the most of the episodes right up to the end. I was pleased to find single season packages, and will probably get season three in time. The quality of the new disks are excellent(still no closed caption ) and are full screen as opposed to my old disks. First two seasons are worth the time and expense, you will be surprised at who are featured in some of the episodes. After that, the odd storylines may lose your interest, but may be worth pursuing if you are still entertained. Uncle Gene died in the middle of the first season, so that will  explain  a lot of quality control.",1463702400,4,891,4.487654320987654

I probably liked it a lot more than everyone else did but I found it entertaining and wanted to watch it again. The characters are interesting and plots fairly good. The packaging of the box set by the manufacturer was the only complaint I had. The DVD's sit in small, shallow depressions and slide around inside when the box is closed. They probably won't scratch if care is taken to placed them back to back but it's a little inconvenient. Other than that the quality of the set was good.",1356220800,2,561,4.403846153846154
1846304,4,B00008G8PV,"After watching the Season One DVD's of ""Ray Bradbury's Andromeda,"" which had a lot of information about the cast, I was left wanting a little more inside information about the technical aspects.  Season Two delivered.  Of course, I enjoyed all the episodes as the show became sharper technically and wittier in terms of script writing. ""Bunker Hill"" and ""Ouroboros"" stand out as my favorites.  ""Bunker Hill"" because we finally get a look at what is going on on Earth and ""Ouroboros"" because it was a very involved story of twist and turns through the folds of time and space with a few season changing surprises.  The final episode, ""Tunnel at the End of the Light,"" leaves us with intrigue for Season Three.  The only bad thing about this season is the loss of Rev BEM by the third episode.  He was not killed off, he left the show because of the strain of acting in his costume, so maybe we'll see him again briefly next season.  If you like ""Andromeda"" you should like ""Farscape"" which was also an ADV Films release.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape-The-Complete-Series/dp/B002GP7ZWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape: The Complete Series</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape-The-Peacekeeper-Wars/dp/B0006FO9B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars</a>",1345075200,3,1373,6.082901554404145
1846305,5,B00008G8PV,"I don't know how we missed this series when it was on TV.  We got interested in it after first an interview I had with Kevin Sorbo for a magazine and second after reading his excellent book True Strength.  We had also enjoyed him in the films What If..., Soul Surfer and others.  And of course as Hercules. This series was originally a Gene Roddenberry idea, however Kevin Sorbo definitely made this his series.  A lot of action and adventure, however there are also some very deep shows that get involved with religion and philosophy.  My wife and I compare this with the first Star Trek series which we still consider the best of the lot.  The cast makes a perfect ensemble and we will do our part to get the word out as we have all the seasons and have thoroughly enjoyed each.

It's a wonderful revisit for a longtime fan of the show such as myself, and anyone looking for good sci-fi, which is sorely lacking now, will love it.

Assuming many have been waiting for a price drop as I have, before purchasing.

It is being released in Canada via Alliance and the cover price is in the $25.00 Can$ range.

ADV over priced and gouged the fans of this show right from the beginning and its unfortunate that it's taken 5 years and the demise of ADV for fans to get a reasonably priced collection of this show on home video.",1280102400,,488,4.4
1846310,3,B00008G8PV,"Season One of ANDROMEDA was possibly one of the worst episodes of s space opera ever on television.  I cataloged the long number of problems in my review of Season One and won't repeat them here.  In Season Two the series continued to contain many of the problems that cripple it:  way too many bumpy-headed aliens, too many derivative characters and story lines, weak acting, and weak writing.  But the show improved in Season Two primarily because it started developing more continuity from episode to episode.  It didn't develop much in the way of actual story arcs, but some minor stories, something completely lacking in Season One.

I am only now watching the series for the first time so I don't know if the show will take advantage of it, but the one real hope on the show in Season Two was the development of Trance's story.  There had been some minor hints in Season One that there was more to Trance than one might initially think, but this was taken to a whole new level.  Numerous hints have been provided.  That she either can't die or isn't strictly speaking alive.  That she has an undisclosed significance of enormous import.  That if her nature and destiny were known it would endanger the crew.  That she evolves and changes over time (and does in Season Two, dramatically changing her physical appearance).  And we know that there are others like her, at least one of which may have had some very bad effects on a planet.  As of the end of Season two, Trance is the only character on the series who really interests me.

I started watching the show because I am currently working my way through every series with robotic, cyborg, artificial, reprogrammed, or technologically enhanced characters.  Unfortunately, the show has done far less with Andromeda than I could have hoped.  The avatar of Andromeda  could be a great character, but the writers after two seasons have barely done anything with her.  I keep hoping that they will.  There was one interesting episode where she helped a man (played by an actor who was one of the Lone Gunmen) where some aspects of her being an android were addressed, but it wasn't the beginning of anything that was ongoing.

One of the fun highlights of the season was seeing Kevin Sorbo's sidekick from HERCULES, Michael Hurst, guest stars as an android.  It was just a tad strange seeing the two familiar actors in a completely alien context.

One of the crippling things about the show is the weakness of the cast.  Kevin Sorbo is a likable actor, but his character is fairly boring and impossibly traditional in the standard heroic mode.  Tyr has to be one of the worst characters ever on a Sci-fi series.  The problem is the way he is written.  As conceived, he is hopelessly one dimensional.  There is no nunace, no subtlety, and nothing of interest.  If there was one character whose removal from the show would improve it more than any other, it would be Tyr.  Beka is solid but not terribly exciting (though there are times when she physically looks like she could be Kara Thrace's older sister).  Lexa Doig's Andromeda is naturally likable, but they simply do too little with her.  Harper is unrelentlessly irritating.  Which leaves Trance.  In Season Two she becomes increasingly important and my major hope is that she will become even more important in Season Three.

In closing, I only wish someone working on the show knew anything whatsoever about Nietzsche.  Hundreds of passages in Nietzsche contradict the crude version of his thought presented in this show.  Nietzscheans seem to have taken nothing from Nietzsche apart from some nutty distortion of the Ubermann.  You certainly don't get the communal cave men you see on the series.  In fact, one of the main words that people used to describe the actual Nietzsche before his mental breakdown was ""polite.""  He was a polite, nice, pleasant man.",1244332800,,3872,4.76390977443609

1846312,5,B00008G8PV,"I bought this because I love sci-fi and have nothing else left to buy.  I took a chance on season 1 and am still watching it.  The characters have more depth than I anticipated based on the other people's opinions but I see they were, for the most part, wrong.  I can't wait to learn more about Trance.  There is something about her as if she knows something almost as if she is connected to the universe.  I hope I am right.  Harper is a great guy, a little young and a little inexperienced.  Tyr has overcome his judgments and struggles with his upbringing and instincts.  Beka has a past and a connection to family (father drug dealer and addict, brother that is on the run).  The only one with out depth to this point is Captain Hunt.  He only has a mission.",1173657600,,762,4.265734265734266
1846313,5,B00008G8PV,"I don't want to go on and on in a review so I will keep this brief. Truly this is one of the best series I have seen, a gem for all sci-fi fans. The dialogue is witty, the characters developed and interesting and the cast really seem to enjoy their work. This is not just some big studio effort (in fact some have slated the production values in Andromeda but that was more the in first season) but something people invested alot of time, effort and interest into and it shows! If you want the standard sci-fi fare try Enterprise, if you want something different try Andromeda.

Season 2 is much better in production values than Season 1 and story wise better than Season 3. It has all the hallmarks of Andromeda; sharp banter, characters constantly trying to get the better of each other, good guys, bad guys, heroes, anti-heroes, beautiful CGI and that hard to describe genuineness behind each of the cast's performances. There is a wonderful back story and a collision of differing philosophies brought to life expertly in each character. You can really enjoy seeing how each one handles problems and challenges in their own very unique way. Standout episodes are Exit Strategies, The Prince, All too Human, Ouroboros, ah I mean all of them. Enough said, in the words of Captain Hunt ""Lets bring it""",1141084800,2,1302,4.660869565217391

I would not even think of paying full price!  If you are fortunate enough to get a lower price for this set; it's worth a try.  For all intents and purposes it's harmless fun and a good show.

1846317,4,B00008G8PV,"I didn't really get hooked on the show with season one.  Most of the characters just seemed annoying.  Other than Captain Hunt, Rommie, and Rev Bem, the characters were barely tolerable.  When characters don't take life and death situations seriously, for example, it's hard for the audience to do so.  And, the whole slip-stream deal is just too bizarre.

But, season two does have some strong episodes, and the characters have started to mature.  One disappointment is that Rommie is yet another android/non-human trying to be human.  It would have been refreshing if she were either comfortable with emotions from the get-go, or completely non-emotional.

Any word on when Season 3 comes out on DVD?  I see that Season 3 ""volumes"" are available.  I don't know anyone insane enough to spend $36 on a few episodes in a ""volume"" when the entire season sells for $56.  Some Season 4 ""volumes"" are already available, but Season 3 is not even available for pre-order.",1098057600,4,964,4.888888888888889
1846318,3,B00008G8PV,"While I like Andromeda, the double-sided ""flipper"" is a bad idea for a TV show. I was quite dissapointed to find this was the case, and that ADV decided to change the media format in the second season without notifying the consumer.

 I own lots of TV series on DVDs and this is the first set I've received to use the ""flipper"" format. The flipper is particularly bad format for TV shows because they can't be easily used in single sided DVD jukeboxes/changers (I own the new Sony 400 disc player). I like to store my favorite shows in my megachanger, and had space already set aside for Andromeda S2. Now it will have to sit on the shelf.

 I would discourage ADV from using flippers again, and hopefully they'll go back to using the single-sided DVDs for their subsequent releases.",1091232000,31,783,4.531914893617022
1846319,5,B00008G8PV,"After buying Season 1 with 10 Discs, I was surprised and a little sceptical to hear that Season 2 would be only 5 discs - all of which are 'flipper' discs. But ADV have pulled it off with some very nice new menus and transfers of episodes that are equal to or better than the last season. The only downside of 'flippers' are the increased chance of fingerprints on the disc, but if you are careful, then they have made a great space-saving choice in this release. Cannot wait for Season 3 :)",1091232000,12,491,4.290322580645161
1846320,5,B00008G8PV,"Andromeda is a fun show. It doesn't have characters in the sense of ""character study"", it has characters in the sense of ""Boy, that guy is a character"". Dylan, Beka, purple Trance, Rommy and Tyr are all fascinating to me, and Harper makes me smile every time he opens his mouth. There isn't really a lot of introspection or moral dilemmas going on here. Everyone knows what they want, and they are all trying to out-maneuver each other into getting it. Andromeda is the anti-Buffy.

 Season 2 adds a bit of wire-fu to the show (to great effect in the Matrix-y episode ""All Too Human"") and the special effects team seem to have gotten a great deal on sparklers. There are still lots of Nietzschian machinations, and Tyr and Dylan go head to head a few times, including in what is probably the best episode of the series, ""The Prince"". There is also quite a bit of continuity in the episodes, and minor points in one show becomes the focus of another.

 Trance makes a change for the serious, and the writers finally figure out what to do with Rev (ship him out).

 ADV perpetually overcharges for all their single-episode disks. I have long given up buying them, and instead wait (and wait...) for the box sets. Note that in this set, you get 5 double-sided disks instead of the 10 single sided disks you would have if you bought them individually. It doesn't match the first season set, but it does save a bit of shelf space. The user interface is a lot better, but now the disk is front-loaded with commercials.",1091059200,31,1512,4.52014652014652
1846321,4,B00008G8PV,"It's amazing how bad some of the episodes can be. Not as bad as Hercules obviously, but lacking a great comedic actor like Bruce Campbell, Andromeda just can't weather the bad writing. Too bad they can't get the relationships of Farscape, and the beautiful effects.

  The protagonist is a likable guy, but he suffers from Smallville complex...he never gets in bed with a good looking woman (guess the black hole ate his cajones). Please do not place any emphasis on the purple flower lady, she just kills every scene with her lack of confidence.

  The message is positive, the science isn't lame, the graphics are pac man leftovers (laughable)and the writers go flat at least three times a season, but the series has Heinlein quality moments and StarTrooper episodes that pull it out. It's not Farscape quality, but it's good.",1090281600,4,828,4.878571428571429

7983720,4,B00008G8PV,"Right away this is a massive improvement on Season 1. The show is actually addressing its own premise, and we see plots related to building a new Commonwealth. And the rest of the episodes actually have their own plotlines, rather than just recycling the most overdone ones from ""Star Trek."" Trance Gemini's hair is also world's better (that must sound like an odd thing to nitpick but there it is.) We also finally get rid of the Religious Stereotype character. (If you want to see a religious sci-fi character done well, I strongly suggest you check out ""Firefly,"" ""Farscape,"" and ""Deep Space Nine."")

THEN in the middle of the season comes ""Ourboros."" This episode is to ""Andromeda"" what ""Scorpion"" is to ""Star Trek: Voyager;"" the game-changer episode that saved the series, and was when the show really came fully alive. Purple Trance was cute, but gold Trance is one of the most fascinating characters in all of sci-fi. The show just gets better from there.

The season is not perfect of course. Beware of the episode ""The Things We Cannot Change,"" which is nothing but a filler clip-show. The way the new Commonwealth is set up is also written rather lazily, and in a way that still makes you wonder why the Commonwealth is so desperately needed in the first place. Leaders of perfectly functioning worlds accept entry into the Commonwealth with all the excitement and seriousness of a bunch of friendly nerds showing up curiously to an invitation to a RPG campaign at their local game shop. But, at least the show is actually DOING something now, something of its own.",1497830400,,1575,4.786764705882353

7983723,5,B00008G8PV,"This series got better as it went along.  The character of Tyr gets steadily more interesting in this season.  We see the show focusing on rebuilding the Common Wealth.  The actors and actresses seemed to settle into their roles.

The writing for the show seemed to tighten this season.  Stories relied on a plausible plot rather than character development.  That was necessary in Season 1, but I'm glad they abandoned it in Season 2.

If I have one complaint it is the lack of sub-titles and extras.  This cast would have had a lot of worthwhile things to share in interviews.",1484611200,2,577,4.643564356435643
