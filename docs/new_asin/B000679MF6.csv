2171017,5,B000679MF6,My attention was first drawn to this movie because Kristen Bell of the CW's Veronica Mars is in it. After reading the discription I knew I had to purchase it and I am glad I did. Not only was it a perfect cast and the acting terrific but the movie all around was fantastic. I know it was based on a true story and that made it all the more captivating. I highly recommend this movie.,1175472000,5,383,4.052631578947368
2171018,5,B000679MF6,"Im not much of a lifetime movie fan but Im a huge Kristen Bell fan so i bought this just for that and i found myself loving this movie it is a touching story Kristen Bell is very endearing in this roll im not a big Anne Heche fan but she was good as the neglectful drug abusing mother

This is a true story of hope and unconditional love",1173312000,5,337,3.8840579710144927
2171019,5,B000679MF6,It's amazing how Gracie rose to the situation.  How many other young children could or would do what she did.  Just to keep her family together.  Too bad the State didn't step in along time before they did.,1162944000,6,206,4.368421052631579
2171020,5,B000679MF6,WOW!! I thought this movie was fantastic! We as people always think we have it bad until we hear someone elses story.  It was truly inspiring to see a 17 year old girl become a woman so that she could raise her siblings and give them a life that she never had.  What a strong and courageous girl she was!!! You gotta see this movie!,1150416000,8,332,4.092307692307692
2171021,5,B000679MF6,"For a movie on ""Lifetime,"" this picture is very high quality, very perceptive.  It is a story of how a teenager has to survive with a highly disfunctional, self-centered, drug-addicted mother.  Her courage is very exciting to watch, and her tremendous efforts are rewarded in the end.  You must see this movie.",1118534400,20,310,4.923076923076923
2171022,4,B000679MF6,"This is an unusually good Lifetime (woman in trouble) movie.  It avoids the sensational aspects that sometimes creep into these films.  Perhaps because it is based on a true story, some of the more fantastic plot twists go down better.  Kristen Bell was utterly outstanding in this film, conveying both youthful innocence and maturity beyond her years.  One minor annoyance:  the characters occasionally lapsed into an almost-Southern accent, which is wholly inappropriate for a family from Washington state.  In fact, none of the actors really got the Northwest speech pattern down, but Ms. Bell came closest.",1110585600,7,610,5.302083333333333
2171023,5,B000679MF6,"This lifetime original movie was AWESOME. Gracie is a young women still in high school, she has 1 sister and 3 brothers.

When they tell Gracie that they are going to take the kids and put them into foster homes, Gracie stands up and says no. She says she will raise them. So starts the story of a young girl with her whole life ahead of her and she decides she will  raise her 3 brothers. Her sister got knocked up and married. Gracie goes to school, works, and is a full time Mom. This is a story of one young girls fight to keep her family together. This is a MUST SEE MOVIE.

2171024,4,B000679MF6,"""Gracie"" is a film that will pull at your heartstrings in all the stereotypical ways. What makes it good is the acting, especially from Bell. Heche is goood too, but at some points she feels out of place in her character.",1105228800,7,221,4.414634146341464
2171025,5,B000679MF6,"Based on a true story, this story shows how a teenage girl decide to be the mother of her step siblings. Actress Kirsten Bell acted so convincingly as Gracie that one can't help but be sympathetic towards her.

She is mellow yet rebellious yet disciplined and add that in with Anne Heche as her defunct mother, brings the story to a convincing roller coaster ride.

Born of an alcoholic and defunct mum and an irresponsible father, this is one of those movie that depict how children from such misguided parents can turn out good.

2171085,4,B000679MF6,"2004's GRACIE'S CHOICE is one of those harrowing true story adaptations that the Lifetime channel sometimes knocks out the park. Its absorbing watchability rests on fantastic performances by Anne Heche and a pre-VERONICA MARS Kristen Bell, both of whom give the film a real edge. Bell plays 17-year-old Gracie Thompson, a bright but troubled 12th grader who, when her neglectful, drug-addled mother (Heche) is imprisoned, goes to court seeking emancipation so as to take on the burden of raising her three younger half-brothers as their foster parent. Your heart breaks even more when you learn that each of the boys claims a different absentee father and that each suffers from A.D.D.

Bell is in virtually every scene and grabs your attention throughout. As Gracie, she exhibits astounding bravery and poise and grace under pressure. Heche is equally mesmerizing as the neurotic nightmare, the oblivious mother hell-bent on that road to self-annihilation. A slice of the credit pie goes to Diane Ladd, as well. She plays Gracie's grandmother who takes in the children when their mom lands in stir. Ladd etches a character who clings to her devout beliefs but who, tragically, has never been able to control her wayward daughter.

It's a no-holds-barred melodrama. The film doesn't hesitate to examine the ugly, disturbing  details that make the kids' lives a living hell, what with the daily scrounging for food and the children's exposure to the presence of drugs and alcohol and the succession of shady men brought home by their mother. With all that in mind, that Gracie Thompson mustered the courage and resourcefulness to do what she did is stunning and an uplifting testament to the power of pure love and self-sacrifice and sheer guts. It's one of those stories that you and I and everyone else need to know about, so that we can check ourselves whenever some petty, stupid little thing goes wrong. Did you know that even as she took charge of her half-brothers and toiled at a part-time job and met each obligation served up by her social worker, Gracie Thompson was also a full-time student with a 3.9 GPA?

2171114,4,B000679MF6,"Ah, Lifetime. Every man's kryptonite. Normally, I'd never, ever, admit to watching, much less purchasing, something with Lifetime's name on it. Then I found out Kristen Bell was in one of their original movies.

Gracie's Choice follows, here's a shocker, Gracie Thompson. Gracie is a sixteen year old--or seventeen, there's some grey areas--whose mom is a drug addict who swears, everytime she's busted, that she's never doing it again. Her grandmother still believes her daughter (Gracie's mom) can change so she gives her chance after chance. And we can't forget Gracie's three brothers and sister, all of which have different dads. Due to turbulent times, and not wanting her family--well, the kids at least--to go through what she did, Gracie decides to do something about it. Balancing school, a job, and having three brothers depend solely on her, can she handle it?

There's nothing new to this movie. Once you see Lifetime's name plastered on the cover you know that there's going to be a woman abused (Gracie gets hit by one of her mother's many different boyfriends), and a heartwarming ending that you know is coming, but it still makes you smile. Even with this being a true story, there's other movies based on true stories exactly like this, and a majority of those are probably made by Lifetime at that. All that being said, Gracie's Choice is great.

It's easily admitted that Kristen Bell is the reason this movie is so good. She, singlehandedly, makes anything she's in watchable (just look at the godawful Roman). Diane Ladd as Gracie's grandma has a noteworthy performance as well. Anne Heche is good, but she tends to overact in a few parts throughout this film. Then you have the obligatory children. I'm not a huge fan of kids playing big parts in movies and while this movie only proves my reasoning, they do their job.

Guys won't watch this movie, plain and simple. Unless you're a huge fan of Kristen Bell, such as myself, guys probably will never know this movie has even been made. So, if you're a woman in search of a feel good movie, Gracie's Choice is right up your alley.",1198022400,2,2104,4.787878787878788
2171115,5,B000679MF6,It is one of the best Lifetime movies. All the actors had me believing they were the real persons from the story. From a personal fan of Kristen Bell,1195084800,,149,4.172413793103448
2171116,4,B000679MF6,"This LifeTime made-for-tv movie is a true story of Gracie Thompson and her struggle to survive her abusive, heroine addicted mother and keep her siblings together.

Kristen Bell delivers an inspiring performance as Gracie, an intelligent teenager with a strong will and loyalty to her brothers. She spent most of her childhood taking care of them (as well as her mother) while traveling in and out forty-one different schools.

Anne Heche plays her mother Rowena. She uses her children, she uses her boyfriends and she uses her mother to fill her addictions. This is one of Heche's most difficult roles and she does an excellent job of making the audience hate her.

With the help of a school counselor and a social worker Gracie files for emancipation from her mother. She eventually fights to terminate parental rights all together so she won't have to worry about her three younger brothers being taken away from her and being put into separate foster homes. Going to school, achieving A's, working part-time and taking care of a household is a lot to ask most adults never mind a teenager. Gracie proves it's doable.

With so many children being abused and separated and lost in the system it's nice to see a story where the system worked to help one family stay together. Life is full of choices and there comes a time when someone has to decide to make the right one. Gracie's choice is a perfect example of how one girl's choice changes the cycle of abuse in her family. Great film. Reviewed by M. E. Wood.",1190246400,12,1513,4.69811320754717
