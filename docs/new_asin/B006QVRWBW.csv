8503357,1,B006QVRWBW,I watched this for 40 minutes and couldn't take it anymore. It claims to be 4 short films but apparently it's the same story in four parts. Has the look and feel of a porn movie but with no sex. I'd pass on this one.,1528502400,,216,3.8222222222222224
8503358,1,B006QVRWBW,"Pretty terrible, and not in a b-movie fun way. I don't think this is the same movie other reviewers said has no sound. This one has audio...unfortunately. Bad acting, no real story line, no horror, no exploitation elements. If my kid made this movie I wouldn't watch it.",1458345600,,270,4.645833333333333

8503361,3,B006QVRWBW,"I was disappointed when the box said that it contained the story ""The Devil's Due At Midnight"" and it was not there. Not there only a preview. That was really the only reason I bought it was to watch that particular story.",1379721600,,222,4.309523809523809
8503362,1,B006QVRWBW,There was no audio no matter how often I tried to view this interesting looking movie.  Hoping a good copy comes around.,1377043200,2,120,4.454545454545454

8503364,5,B006QVRWBW,"Enjoyed the first movie. Kind if slow moving but what fun. The creature and peoples eyes oozing red supposed blood. Was great 60s horror.
The second movie truthfully not as good.
But overall if you love classic B drive in movie scare this is a must see.",1370476800,,253,4.404255319148936
