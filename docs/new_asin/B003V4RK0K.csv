8406386,5,B003V4RK0K,"The staging of Claus Guth is modern, set in a forest with what looks like actual trees. There a timetable set in a bus shelter. The stage revolves. The dress is of today. The singers are young and believable. You can understand why women lust after Don Giovanni,but Leporello stands up for himself and will not be pushed around by Giovanni. I like the part where  Donna Anna is seducing Don Giovanni and leaps all over him. She is attractive and knows she is. The father comes on the scene and has a gun, Don hits him over the head with a branch and kills him. Donna Elvira is sitting in the bus shelter and Don is standing on the roof of said shelter. In other words, Don is an out of control, wild fellow. You could say Don and leporello are a pair of hoons and they are involved with the Mafia.

Chris Maltman who has a fine voice, takes to the part of Don Giovanni with energy and has the looks and body to be believable. Many Dons look unfit, this man pushes weights. Leporello is sung believably by Erwin Schrott. Donna Anna is a beautiful looking woman,which makes her believable, instead of some overweight soprano. This part is well sung by Annette Dasch. Donna Elvira is as impetuous as ever, portrayed by the lovely singing of Dorothea Roschmann. Matthew Polenzani is one of the best Don Ottavio's yet recorded on DVD or Bluray. The steady filming of the opera is in the hands of Brian Large. De Billy conducts the Vienna Philharmonic swiftly and with gusto. It is very important in opera to have a conductor who does not linger,it ruins the production and the singing.

Will the traditionalists like it. If they are looking for a new experience they will. But if they want a traditional rendition then they will not. 1080 HD. DTS master audio surround sound. Worldwide. English and other subtitles.",1323907200,16,1810,4.529051987767584
8406387,5,B003V4RK0K,"Of all Mozart's operas, Don Giovanni seems to be the one with themes that make it more open to modern day re-envisioning and reinterpretation.  And it's not so much the subject of the amorous activities of a philandering nobleman that make the opera so timeless as much as the underlying themes of passion, revenge, power and conquest, or - as in this particular production for the 2008 Salzburg Festval - the question of honour.

Accordingly, there's something of a Godfather feel to the tempestuous Latin passions of love and revenge here that feels perfectly appropriate, the production approaching the opera from a different angle while remaining perfectly true to the strengths of Mozart's score and the themes of Da Ponte's wonderful libretto, full of wit and wisdom.  It's certainly more complex and nuanced on the subject of relationships between male and female than their rather more buffa treatment of the subject in Cos Fan Tutte.  To cite just one example, look at Donna Elvira's complex feelings for Don Giovanni, expressing hatred, contempt and frustration for Giovanni, but at the same time her actions are fuelled by a deep love and an irrational but no less sincere hope for his redemption.

The staging here is limited entirely to a dark woods setting, but imaginatively deployed on a revolving stage which gives a wonderful three-dimensional quality to the production (well directed for the screen, as ever, by Brian Large).  As well observed as the references and updating are - the staging never compromising the integrity of a truly great opera - the performances here are just as nuanced, powerful and dramatic, Christopher Maltman's near-deranged, wild-eyed obsessive Don Giovanni brilliantly balanced and vocally matched with Erwin Schrott's amusingly twitchy Leporello.  The score is magnificently interpreted, drawing the full darkness and energy out of the opera, as well as bringing out its underlying tenderness and tragedy.  In this respect, in addition to strong singing you would expect from all the major roles, Matthew Polenzani gives one of the most sensitive and sympathetic readings of Don Ottavio that I've seen for this opera.

The image quality on the Blu-ray - once it takes its time to actually load-up onto the player - is fine, while the orchestration is given a fine presentation in the DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 mix, centrally located and unshowy on the surrounds, and beautifully toned.  The singing initially seems a little echoing in this mix, occasionally overwhelmed by the music, but it's generally good and seems to improve by the end of the first Act.  The PCM Stereo mix gives the singing a better stage, but at the cost of the fine separation of the orchestration.

This is not the most traditional production of Don Giovanni, and it certainly isn't the best I've seen or heard, the limitations of the woods setting losing some of the familiar elements that usually make it work so well as a drama (traditionalists will be disappointed by a bus timetable in place of a Register of the Don's conquests, no masks on the wedding guests, a Burger King take-away for a dinner-party, twigs for the Commendatore's statue and certainly no flames at the finale), but that's balanced with a reasonably fresh take on the themes, some strong singing and fine acting that is more naturalistic than the usual operatic gesturing, and a fascinating visual presentation in terms of its design and conceptualisation.",1283644800,12,3454,5.072310405643739
