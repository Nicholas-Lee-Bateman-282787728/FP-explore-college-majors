8150269,2,B000JGJF92,"Although I enjoyed the film part of the movie and the commentary, the music of the film turned it into a corny adventure who's director must have been a freshmen in college.  It is a long way away from the likes of ""Storm over Everest"".  Interesting documentary about the second attempt to locate Mallory's camp and Irving's body.  Although they ultimately couldn't call the expedition a success, the didn't call it a failure due to the efforts in assisting in saving the life's of 4 climbers who were stranded high on the north ridge.  According the movie, it was the second highest rescue attempt in the mountains history.",1426809600,,624,4.75
8150270,3,B000JGJF92,"This is a great chronicle of the Mallory/Irvine expedition.  Great interviews, background info and pictures. My big complaint is the terrible, shaking camera work and music - which is intentional. It's so distracting, it takes away from what is being said on the video. I can tell the videographer is trying to be artistic, but it backfires. Overall, a wonderful documentary account of the Mallory Expedition.  Eric Simonson offers great, candid interviews which is the best part of the film.",1255046400,2,492,5.1375
