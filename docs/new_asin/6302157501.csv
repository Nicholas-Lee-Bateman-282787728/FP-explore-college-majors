Recently, this year I tried to look for this even though I do not know the title because I went to googled it by describing the 3 main characters. Thank you for selling something really beautiful.",1260489600,,346,4.421875
8609641,5,6302157501,"This is one movie that I absolutely loved as a child, and still love today. There was no crude humor, no hints at adult jokes. It was clean family fun!

The only con I have for this movie is that it doesn't seem to be on DVD. ;)",1233014400,,228,3.75
