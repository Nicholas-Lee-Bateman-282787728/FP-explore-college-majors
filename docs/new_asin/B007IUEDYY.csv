5089884,5,B007IUEDYY,"Visually impressive with a solid cast carrying the story from start to finish, The Collapsed was an impressive slice of cinema. It was engaging, tense and in at least one scene managed to shock me in the direction that the plot took.

The Collapsed is definitely a film for the patient viewer and for my money another score for good solid independent filmmaking.",1336867200,5,362,4.746031746031746
5089891,3,B007IUEDYY,"This is an American independent, end of the world, psychological type horror. It is based around a family of four, they are in the big city and an `event' has happened that seems to make everyone uber violent. They know their only hope is to get away and head out of town to find the other son. The father Scott Weaver (John Fantasia) leads his wife, daughter and son away from the pestilent city and head off in a stolen car to the comparative safety of the country-side.

But you know they are going to encounter other `humans' at some point and things are never going to go well. This features lots of camera angles with weird breathing which is there to evoke fear in the viewer and to make us think that bad things are going to happen. Whilst the father does have graphic night mares in the build up to `the twist', it is unlikely that the on screen antics will have the same effect on you.

The acting is not Academy nominee grade, but there are some convincing performances. We have the usual stupid decisions that happen in all films of this genre, the sort that nearly always lead to a demise of the miscreant or increased tension. This does work in part, and the family become more begrimed as they get further away from civilisation, which is a nice nod to realism.

Overall though this is not that entertaining, it drags in the middle and the action is sporadic at best, the saving grace is the kick in the tail and that was actually the only thing that pulled this back from a lower rating than I have awarded. If you like all things `horror', then this will never be on your `A' list, but you still may want to see, if you only want a quality fright-fest, then best to not bother.",1363824000,2,1694,4.337539432176656
5089892,2,B007IUEDYY,"A lone family struggles to survive after an unknown force wipes out most of the population, but they will have more to watch out for in woods than the other crazed remnants of mankind. THE COLLAPSED is a fitting description for Justin McConnell's post-apocalyptic plot that suffers from a confusing lack of identity. It is never certain until the end whether the film is trying to be a zombie movie or a creature feature, or if it is instead just a straight survival horror film in a world turned mad. It makes all of the same missteps as the 2010 remake of THE CRAZIES, pairing an uneventful plot and unintriguing characters together without even providing any gratuitous gore to maintain a feigning interest along the way. John Fantasia does his best as the family's forceful leader, but most of the performances feel like they are just being read to us. Even the visual metaphors are entirely transparent. THE COLLAPSED is an unfortunate miss that doesn't stack up to recent ""End of the World"" entries like THE DIVIDE, THE CARRIERS, or RIGHT AT YOUR DOOR.

5089894,3,B007IUEDYY,"I was left with asking to the very end, what caused things to collapse?  After the first 5 minutes I wanted to shoot the wife myself.  The family definitely came off in the beginning of the movie as typical big city liberal-leaning family that has lost everything and is waiting for the government or an NGO to save them.  Later in the movie the father turns out to be an experienced woodsman, born in the backwoods.  But he didn't own a firearm?  I looked at this movie as an idea of what would happen to sheeple if TEOTWAWKI would happen.  As for the story I am still wondering what it actually was.

5089899,2,B007IUEDYY,"This was a well made low budget film that I didn't like. Civilization has suddenly collapsed for some unexplained reason as people distrust and kill each other (""Yellow Brick Road""). A family of four decide to leave the city for Dover's Bend, their old home town. That is pretty much it.

Along the way they encounter other people and a hear weird noises and feel spooked out. The mystery, which you may not realize there is one, is solved at the end.

The acting was decent for a low budget. The writing and direction were also better than normal, it just that there wasn't anything there to enjoy. They didn't build character well. The ""twist"" was not unexpected. For seasoned film watchers this is a let down. People who don't watch a lot of horror films might find some enjoyment in it.

5089901,1,B007IUEDYY,"Honestly, this one is a waste of time and budget (if there's any).
Very bad movie, terrible amateur acting (I especially couldn't stand the acting of the actresses who play the mother and the daughter, to the point that I started to fast forward their scenes).
It seems like a student project.
One of the worst films I've seen in a long, long time.",1344211200,,348,4.453125
5089902,2,B007IUEDYY,"The Collapsed is one weird film and not really in a good way.  After some unexplained apocalyptic event, a family of four struggles to survive and find safe shelter while being stalked by some unforeseen malevolent force.  This is a very low budget film featuring a small, tight cast that is far too short on action and far too heavy on amateurish acting to hold your attention.  Scott Weaver, wife Emily, teenaged daughter Rebecca, and 20's son Aaron are the family in question who are on the move looking for secure shelter, and trying to avoid road bandits who will take whatever they want.  The first 15 minutes of the film starts out fairly strong as they abandoned their shelter in a garage and secure a car.  They are trying to make it to their other son who is presumably away at college.

However when they stop to scavenge for supplies at a gas station, they are forced to flee into the woods from a pair of armed men.  Unfortunately the film breaks down from here as it moves at a plodding pace amplified by innate dialog.  As the family stops to rest, Rebecca uses the respite to walk off in the woods by herself, despite all of the danger around them...to shave her legs by a stream.  Nothing like having your priorities in order.  Despite the fact that survivors of whatever disaster took place seem few and far between, the dad is determined to stay off the road and walk for over 7 days in the woods to get to their destination...despite the fact that they have little in the way of supplies.

The one thing that Director/Screenwriter Justin Mcconnell has going for him is that he does manage to build a bit of suspense and creepiness.  The family feels the presence of some unseen, evil force stalking them constantly and it's the one thing that holds your interest as you want to know how it fits into the story.  But in the end Mcconnell fumbles this by falling back on a plot contrivance that has become far too overused in horror films recently.  And the fact that we never get an explanation as to what exactly happened in the world makes The Collapsed an extremely hollow film.",1343260800,2,2100,4.506596306068602

5089907,3,B007IUEDYY,"While this movie falls into the ""Post Apocalyptic"" genre, it lacks many of the essentials of that genre. I would guess they did as little in the way of a storyline to save on the budget. I would have liked to have seen more of a back story as to what befell humankind that drove them to the lengths they took. What happened in the city that forced them into the woods? Did whatever this ""Thing"" is, happen all over the world, or did it just start in that city? There are just too many unanswered questions that pertain to this movie to really be pulled in.

If you enjoy post-apocalyptic films, you might like this. Just be prepared for a mediocre product.",1338854400,2,498,4.606741573033708
5089909,2,B007IUEDYY,"""The Collapsed"" is exactly what you expect from a low budget horror film; it's pretty dreadful most of the time, but is also somewhat impressive at times especially considering with how little they had to work with. The cast is underwhelming. Most of the acting from the entire cast is very stiff. Nothing really feels like it flows naturally and feels forced more often than not. John Fantasia is okay for a while, but loses what little credit he has in the last ten to fifteen minutes of the movie where he seems to channel the overacting ability of Nicolas Cage. Nobody knows how to cry properly either as not one of them sheds a single, solitary tear amongst the four of them.

Much of the movie is characters hearing hushed voices all around them and feeling a presence that always seems to be there but can never be seen. So more often than not you're watching somebody whip around pointing a gun at tree bark over and over again as somebody else asks them a similar barrage of questions somebody would on ""Lassie;"" ""What is it, girl? Do you hear something? Is somebody in trouble?"" It does eventually pay off in the end, but it's highly likely that many will turn it off before it gets to that point.

The screenplay gets the job done, but isn't great. The Rebecca character seems purposely written to be annoying. She's incredibly petty, is on the verge of a hissy fit because the world has ended and has taken her boyfriend in the process, and says really stupid things most of the time. Her dad tells her to get some sleep, which she replies, ""You don't have to tell me twice,"" which would've made since if her mother hadn't said the exact same thing less than five minutes before. But then once she shaves her legs, she becomes little miss ""let's keep the family together."" Scott's ""I saw what I saw!"" bit at the end didn't really help matters either. It just seems like a silly and obvious thing to exclaim when you're in danger.

The best part about ""The Collapsed"" is the score; classical at times, bluesy at others, and all out jazz in between. There are some serious horns used at times and a fair share of strings. It's pretty great. Unfortunately, it seems extremely out of place the rest of the time. Sneaking around the woods with blazing horns triumphantly highlighting your journey seems kind of awkward, doesn't it?

The moment that stands out the most is when Scott and Aaron have this one-on-one conversation in a house they break into where they have their first hot meal in weeks. Their dialogue, body language, and performances are just much more genuine than everything else in the movie.

""The Collapsed"" certainly isn't the worst movie you could watch. In fact, it's watchable just not great. The gory ending tries to make up for every shortcoming the movie has in the rest of its 82 minute duration. It's like it grazes the surface of what the ending was like to the original ""Saw."" It isn't nearly as big of a twist and it doesn't have nearly as much of an impact, but the similarities are certainly there.

The movie does feel pretty silly at times and if the rigid acting doesn't get to you the lame dialogue just might. In the end though, if you power through every urge to turn the movie off and give ""The Collapsed"" an actual chance, it's a somehwat effective low budget horror movie that isn't quite as bad as some are making it out to be. It feels kind of like an even cheaper version of ""The Divide,"" also released by Anchor Bay, but ""The Divide"" is definitely the better of the two.

5089910,4,B007IUEDYY,"""The Collapsed"" is an apocalypic thriller about one family's battle to stay alive on a trek through a landscape of barbarism and cannibalism.  In the wake of an unspecified event that has catapulted civilization into a fatal downward spiral, the Weaver family -- father Scott (John Fantasia), young adult son Aaron (Steve Vieira), mother Emily (Lise Moule), and teenage daughter Rebecca (Anna Ross) -- desperately tries to survive.  Fleeing the city, the family hopes to find sanctuary in a rural hometown from their past, Dover's Bend.

With the constant threat of violent death forcing them to stay as far from other people as possible, they take to the forest.  However, they soon discover that the danger posed by other survivors may be the least of their worries.  Someone -- or something -- seems to have followed them into the wilderness.

Though the premise sounds like that of cable TV's ""The Walking Dead,"" ""The Collapsed"" preceded the AMC miniseries.  Director Justin McConnell knows how to put together a horror film; he's excellent at creating and building suspense and incorporating plenty of shock moments along the way.  He also spends time letting us get to know the Weavers as individuals so that we feel a stake in what happens to them.

End-of-the-world movies have proliferated lately, but ""The Collapsed"" stands out.  Though it was made on a low budget with unknown actors, the script and execution are solid.  DVD special features include audio commentary by writer/director McConnell, music video, photo gallery, cast and crew bios, and a making-of documentary.",1338681600,8,1585,5.128404669260701

8517931,3,B007IUEDYY,"I thought I'd give my thoughts on this film after watching it today. I came upon it by browsing for horror movies to put on my dvr and came across this. It sounded okay so I taped it. Then I looked it up on imdb and saw it was rated 3.7/10. I almost deleted it right then, but for some reason I flipped it on this morning and watched it pretty much the whole way through.

It's very easy to sum up this film. It's a pretty bad movie, but as far as bad movies go, it's actually not too bad. It's very comparable to a Syfy channel movie. Low budget, unknown actors, not too good effects. It has some merit, but it also has some really cringe-worthy moments, as you would expect. Some may not make it past the pretty awful opening scene, but it gets better. The young woman (I can't help it, she's a decent actor, but it's hard to ignore the obvious similarities) kept reminding me of a discount Anna Kendrick. The son was awkward but had some good scenes. The mother . . . eh. The father is the best actor.

There's not much to say. It's pretty much a ""B"" movie, but it's a decent one. If you can bear the awkward moments and actually enjoy yourself, it's a pretty well directed piece, plus it creates a nice atmosphere to boot. One of the main plot points comes to nothing, but then again the movie has twists that I applauded. The Collapsed isn't some two and a half hour movie you have to sit through, it's a slim 80 minutes, and for the relatively short investment of time, the movie provides enough entertainment to make it worth it.",1444262400,,1536,4.22108843537415

8517933,1,B007IUEDYY,"I caught this on free Streaming. Bad. Awful. Boring. Talentless. It's truly a New Rock Bottom Low in zero-budget, ""let's-shoot-this-with-my-friends-at-Grandma's-farm-next-weekend"" awful.

My 12 year old nephew guessed the hackneyed, overused plot 'ending twist' about 10 minutes in. You will too.
So for anyone under around age 9, here's the Spoiler Alert: Dad is insane and just hallucinated everything. All of the scenes in the movie never happened as you saw them, Dad murdered his family plus everybody else, then has instant amnesia, and in the last two minutes of the film he remembers in a series of flashbacks, feels just terrible about it all, puts a bullet through his brain, and The End.

To get to that ending ' flashback twist' you have to watch a really lame cast struggle with probably the worst script ever written.
Not bad like Plan 9, Ed Woods-bad. Bad like an untalented kid with a camera just throwing together 80 minutes of garbage the absolute cheapest way he can think of so he has something to sell to DVD/cable, then cashes out and runs.

So this 'city family of 4' is homeless and on the run from some terrible, really awful TEOTWAWKI apocalypse that the director never even bothers to name. So no details, no backstory, no nothing. For the first few minutes you think he's trying to be mysterious about setting up a 'big reveal'. Then the Big Reveal never happens, the film is over, and you realize the director just didn't care enough even to specify the nature of The Big Bad Thing We're All Running From.
Some reviewer praised him for not including zombies. Heck no--zombies would have cost money.

Of the cast of 4 we start with, 2 of them, Mom and stereotypically irritating-snotty-whiny Daughter, are unexplainedly murdered offscreen in the first few minutes. By unknown, unseen killers who leave them dead for no reason but, inexplicably, the killers do not take their gun or their backpacks of precious food.
Canada by the way has some of the strictest gun control prohibitions this side of North Korea. You basically can't own a firearm for any reason. Every civilian gun in the country was confiscated 20 years ago. But in THIS film, there are zillions of loaded guns just lying around for the taking everywhere, even AK-47's (say WHAAATT???). Go figure.

The script is so awful you're at a loss for words. It's MST3K-parody bad, except that not enough happens here (characters just tramp through the woods trying to look earnest) for MST3K to have anything to work with.

Idiotic actions and senseless mistakes abound, all the sort of things you would expect from a young 'director' who's never gotten outdoors much, nor around guns or violence at all, and is still too young to be able to reproduce how actual grown-ups speak.

Early on the family is supposedly fleeing for their lives from Bad Scary Men With Machine Guns who have just chased them away from their car and forced them to hide, panting, in unfamiliar woods. Instantly, teen daughter immediately announces she 'needs some privacy' and wanders off into the woods alone. We then see her SHAVING HER LEGS. Actually, her ankles. Because she is still wearing her jeans. No, really. While running for their lives, she calls a halt and shaves her legs. I have no idea why this scene exists. Maybe there was supposed to be some striptease teen T & A, and the actress balked. I don't blame her; the only thing worse than being in this as your first film would be also having your first nude scene in this.
There is no possible way that even the finest actors in the world could salvage a script that calls for things like shaving your legs while running for your life at the start of the Apocalypse. This is just hopeless, and really, I pity the cast.

The characters as written are all just unrelievedly stupid, clueless, uninteresting, wooden, inarticulate, unsympathetic, and cardboard. I'll blame the script and the director--the male lead is certainly putting his best effort into trying to singlehandedly carry this 80 minute GIGO-fest, while being given absolutely nothing to work with.

5 minutes in, you're rooting for the Mom and Daughter to die in some horrible way just to get them offscreen.
10 minutes in, you're wanting THE ENTIRE CAST offscreen.
By the end of the film, you're wondering how long it will take before audiences get the right to bring Class Action Suits against awful directors and their even more awful films.

From the Imbd website listing for the film, the 'Official Trivia' page says all you need to know:

1. Shot in 14 days in the woods around Ontario on a total budget of $40,000.

2. The male lead was recruited from a Craigslist ad. He paid for his own plane ticket from Seattle to Ontario for the shooting.

3. About 30% of the film consists of just Steadicam shots, circling around the ""family of four"" in the woods from 50 feet away with lots of heavy breathing. (Nothing ever actually happens in any of these scenes). Another 30% of the film is the same Steadicam following the male lead as he tramps along alone, wordlessly, through the woods. No, really. That's 60% of the film.

4. The director says he only could afford to rent the Steadicam guy for 3 days. So he's real proud of that Steadicam footage.

5. An opening scene with the family walking around an empty side street (nothing happens) was shot early in the AM so the director did not have to pay Ontario for a public-filming permit.

6. The film was shot with every scene in chronological order. If you're just throwing something together Fast And Cheap, that saves you any editing, costume changes, etc. There are good reasons why Hollywood doesn't make ""real films"" this way.

This thing really has no redeeming qualities. It's shot in some uninteresting woods while no one was watching. The 'sets' are just the farmhouses of someone the director borrowed them from. There's no sign that there was any editing whatsoever here; this looks exactly like 82 minutes of raw footage. There's no attempt at FX. The 'mysterious unseen force' never materializes and never shows up, probably because that would have required having an actual plot, and a script.
Once you foresee the ending that the Dad is actually insane and that the scenes you are seeing are all going to be repudiated in the final 'twist reveal' flashback scene when he 'suddenly remembers' committing all these murders of his family himself, whatever suspense there might have been disappears, and you can't get it back.
Of course, if he's just crazy, this also repudiates the rest of the plot and there's no SF/apocalypse thing going on at all, just an uninteresting crazy guy killing his uninteresting family and then some uninteresting total strangers.

I feel truly sorry for the actors. They had no script to work with, and they're trapped in a totally awful film. It doesn't even have enough personality or individuality to merit a 'Worst Of' award at some Comicon.

There are boring little B- films that have maybe one decent 2 minute scene. Pitifully, 'The Collapsed' doesn't even have that. There is literally not one 30-second clip I could pull out of this whole dreary slog that would be worthy of anyone's attention.

That's got to be some kind of a record. One Star rating only because there's nothing lower. Hey, I'm ready to join that Class Action Suit anytime now.
Hope this review saves somebody some disappointment, some lost time and some wasted rental money. Lots of better films to see.
