8287127,5,B001CDKQFS,"Based on the Classic 1951 film of the same name (English Title THE RED INN)

 This is a superb remake and a very black comedy as only the French can do.
  Highly Recommended.

8287128,5,B001CDKQFS,"I bought this French black comedy for the local Alliance Francaise.  It's about a family running an auberge (a sort of hotel) in the middle of nowhere, where they suppliment their income and their food supply by killing and eating some of their guests.  Gruesome?  Yes, but funny too!",1265587200,,284,4.755102040816326
