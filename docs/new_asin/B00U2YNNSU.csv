7028146,3,B00U2YNNSU,"I bought this while visiting the World War II museum in New Orleans (a great museum, incidentally), thus I did not have the benefit of the Amazon web site user opinions.  I thought this program was just ""OK"".  I was expecting more performance and not as much talking heads commentary.  I also thought that the amount of ""Bob Hope"" footage was inadequate given the title of the DVD.  What there was of performance was excellent.  I also really enjoyed the historic footage.  The sound was fine.  The video was clear.  Much of it was in black and white -- as should be expected from the World War II era.",1458345600,4,602,4.458715596330276
