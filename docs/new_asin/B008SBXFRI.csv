5180981,4,B008SBXFRI,My husband and I were both laughing out loud! What a gem! Hope he never retires. We love you Louie!,1374710400,,99,4.0
5180982,5,B008SBXFRI,"It's just too funny!!  I fell in love with Louie Anderson after seeing Mom, Louie's Looking at Me Again!, and this new stand-up doesn't disappoint!",1374451200,,147,4.88
5180983,4,B008SBXFRI,"This wasn't my favorite, but it was very good. He is a very gifted comedian in my opinion with excellent timing. I would watch any stand up routine he does but this one on aging was very funny.",1374192000,,193,4.105263157894737
5180984,5,B008SBXFRI,I love Louie Anderson and have for years.  I was very happy with the DVD and his comedy act.  I wish there were more DVD's available with some of his older shows. LOVE THIS!,1369699200,,173,4.0588235294117645
5180985,5,B008SBXFRI,"I admit I tend to prefer humor that leans a bit more toward the edgy and crude, as long as there's some substance or nugget of truth underneath it all. But there's still something about Louie Anderson's good old-fashioned ""safe"" approach that I really enjoy, and I found myself laughing outloud several times during his latest stand-up offering, probably because it's relatable to so many of us on some level. The way he muses about getting older, coming from a large family, and - most of all - battling weight issues, is like chatting with an old friend. I won't spoil any of his material for you here, but his brief story about the homeless guy was a highlight, and the ""meat tooth"" bit was hilarious. Barely breaking 45 minutes it runs a little on the short side, but is definitely worth watching if you get the chance.",1369353600,3,823,4.5675675675675675
5180986,5,B008SBXFRI,It was actually a gift for someone.  I had seen it on tv and it was hysterical.  Haven't laughed that hard out loud in a long time.,1364774400,2,131,3.814814814814815
5180987,5,B008SBXFRI,"Totally hilarious.  I am a baby boomer and could laugh at his observations of truisms that I am experiencing as I, too, grow older.  He has always been one of my favorite comedians and it's good to have another DVD to play when I want to laugh.  I highly recommend this to everyone whether you are a baby boomer or not!!!",1363737600,2,321,4.229508196721311
5180988,5,B008SBXFRI,I bought this as a gift for a friend who is a very dedicated Louie Anderson fan. We watched it with her parents and we all laughed from start to finish. Louie certainly has not lost his ability to create clean comedic material that can apply to 99% of the American people.,1362355200,3,272,4.25
5180989,5,B008SBXFRI,Havent laughed this hard in a long time. Louie doesnt disappoint. Especially geared for the over 40 crowd. Had to rewind several times because we missed stuff because we were laughing so hard:),1356998400,,193,4.878787878787879
5180990,5,B008SBXFRI,"Great stand-up! Would be funny to lots of people but is hilarious for the 50- somethings. Got a forty-five minute laugh from this one, from beginning to end!!",1352332800,,158,4.678571428571429
5181011,4,B008SBXFRI,"We really like Louis Anderson, especially the fact that everyone in the family can hear his comedy. For the most part most people out there do not understand what true comedy is, it should be something that can make the whole family laugh and not how many times can you swear in one sentence.",1488326400,,292,4.425925925925926

5181038,2,B008SBXFRI,"A few laughs, but not nearly as good as classic Louie.",1442448000,,54,4.0
5181039,5,B008SBXFRI,"Saw his show in Vegas at Excalibur...been a long time fan. This video was great fun, where is the HBO special??? Been waiting for that DVD to be available forever, whatup?",1432598400,,171,4.548387096774194

5181061,5,B008SBXFRI,"Unusual comic, very funny.  Truth hurts?  I want to find his act about donuts and French Fries.  I pray it exists on disc: the funniest show ever.  These bits are great too.",1423612800,,173,4.3125
5181062,5,B008SBXFRI,I love Louie. I laughed the entire time I watched him!!,1422835200,,55,4.090909090909091
5181063,4,B008SBXFRI,"Louie is as always laugh-out-loud funny with his laid-back, low-key comedic style.  I would have preferred less profanity, however, since I had planned to show the DVD to my pre-teen grandsons.  From what I can tell, this DVD was likely recorded some time in 1912, so I don't know if Louie has since lost weight, but his size is certainly a concern for his future.  On the other hand, it's also a source of lots of his humor.  The profanity is the basis for the loss of one star in my evaluation.",1421107200,,496,4.358695652173913
5181064,5,B008SBXFRI,Louie is just plain funny without even trying.  I've shown this performance to about a dozen people and only one person out of that lot seemed not to think it was funny.  Amazing how he can be so funny and never use the F word.,1419897600,,227,4.022222222222222

5181068,4,B008SBXFRI,"I really enjoyed this dvd but the entire comedy skit was about Louie's age and weight. I thought, that it would be more of a variety of topics.",1405728000,,143,4.142857142857143
5181069,5,B008SBXFRI,"Louie is the best. He can always make you laugh. Love his facial expressions ! He is good, clean, fun.",1382918400,2,102,4.15
