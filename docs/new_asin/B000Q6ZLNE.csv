2833100,5,B000Q6ZLNE,"If you really want to learn to watercolor, this is the DVD for you.

Organization is one of it's best features. Julie Cohn has lots of easy to understand techniques. She explains why you do something, as well as how to do it. You can refer back to a painting technique without searching through the whole DVD.

There are sections on: shortcuts; how to find a good brush; drawing tips; and the all important question of how much water vs how much paint. Julie has easy to remember names for all the varying degrees of water and paint and when to use them. There are lots of quick reference guides about color and painting techniques that I found really helpful.

Julie's original music adds just the right touch!

I enjoyed the slide show with the music and used it as a screen saver.

A great value for aspiring water colorists.",1163808000,23,828,4.493333333333333
2833101,4,B000Q6ZLNE,"I will be loaning this DVD out to novice watercolor students.  I found it to be very well produced and thought out. Julie meticulously measures how much water should be used on the brush and mixing the paint, and ""names"" each of four combinations, which is too tedious for me or for experienced painters...but for a beginner who knows nothing, it's quite helpful.",1155945600,16,363,4.761904761904762
2833102,4,B000Q6ZLNE,Julie is a delight. Her explanations and demonstrations are concise and easy to follow. Julie's method of getting the correct paint consistency is essential. I highly recommend this DVD for beginners and those of us who are a little beyond beginning.,1154649600,20,250,5.121951219512195

In no time, you can learn techniques and apply them and create a beautiful, one-of-a-kind landscape painting.  I also found the ""extra"" drawing tips, exercises and quick reference so valueable and helpful.  My daughter (age 6) was learning along with me.  We really enjoyed the slide show during dinner too!  I have been painting watercolor for 10 years and learned more from this DVD and Julie Cohn than I have in any other class I have taken.  This DVD is a must own!",1154476800,65,618,4.614678899082569
2833104,5,B000Q6ZLNE,"I had no art experience. I am having a blast with Julie's easy to follow instuctions. On the other hand my wife has taken several art classes. She is much more advanced,and has found Julie's instructions to be extremely beneficial. One of the major benefits is that you can keep going back to a concept that would be hard to do in a typical class setting.

Thank you Julie!!",1150675200,41,374,4.420289855072464

2833112,4,B000Q6ZLNE,"Fast shipping, nothing broken or damaged, DVD played well.
At times I just wanted to fast forward because she talks and talks, but I stuck with it.
She made it easier to understand the mixture of colors and the wetness of the paper and your brush, she gives you several scenarios on how to be successful on your painting with mixing colors and if you make mistakes how to quickly correct them before you ruin your entire painting.  Good tips on how to drawl your picture on paper and what very basic supplies you need.  Overall I learned so I gave 4 stars.
I could not give 5 just for me the DVD seems more old and out dated.  I'm still on the search for newer updated lessons.",1391904000,,677,4.2734375

It would have been nice to be able to get a printout of the chart she used, but I was able to find it elsewhere once I knew what I was looking for. There is also a nice insert included which gives some suggestions for basic supplies you will need to get you started.",1380412800,,360,4.084507042253521

2833116,2,B000Q6ZLNE,"I ordered this DVD based on customer reviews. I found it to be too simplistic in its approach and way too wordy. When an artist uses four different terms for wetness, another three for paint density, and then combines them...we are in trouble. I also found the production to be too ""cute"" and not enough ""meat"". Additionally, the painting she leads you through is too detailed; by that I mean there are no bold colors or brush strokes, but instead little lines and small brushes for filling in. In my opinion, this is not what watercolor is about.  Really a poor introduction to watercolor I think.
The Sterling Edwards ""Starting Point for Watercolors"" DVD is much superior to this one,",1363305600,2,686,4.716666666666667
2833117,5,B000Q6ZLNE,"I enjoyed the dvd - the instructor showed her techniques clearly - I am a beginner so everything covered was useful to me.

2833118,4,B000Q6ZLNE,I like Julie's presentation and style. But she doesnt go far enough. I feel like the video should have been a wee bit longer.,1354752000,,125,4.25
2833119,5,B000Q6ZLNE,"____THE GOOD:____

When I first started painting watercolor, I scoured Youtube and my library for videos and books to help me get started.  I found a lot of useful information, but they still did not adequately address the number one thing that (in hindsight) was causing me frustration with my paintings.  That is, my lack of understanding of the relationship between the wetnesses of the paint, paper and brush.  I kept getting backruns and blooms where I didn't want them, and I'd end up with muddy messes.

When I saw this DVD, it was like an ""a ha!"" moment for me.

This is the best and most thorough breakdown of the relationship of paint, paper, and brush wetness that I've come across.  Other videos or explanations will say ""get a nice paint consistency,"" but they don't specify how thick it should be, or how wet your paper and brush should be.  My paintings took an instant leap once I realized what was going on.

Ms. Cohn speaks in a clear, easy to follow manner.  The DVD's picture quality is excellent, and she also has very helpful visuals that unambiguously illustrate her concepts of paper and paint wetness.

She also shows how to correct common mistakes like blooms or uneven paint application, and even has a small section on basic color theory.

____THE NOT SO GOOD:____

While Ms. Cohn does spend some time explaining how to choose your materials, her treatment feels cursory, especially for brushes.  She doesn't adequately explain the difference between synthetic and natural hair brushes, and why some brushes are so much more expensive than others.

As another reviewer pointed out, where the DVD really lacks is that she does not explain how to care for your tools.  She doesn't mention that she squeezes the brush gently, and worse, she omits mentioning the two biggest mistakes that people, regardless of age or maturity level, make--leaving brushes sitting in the bowl of water, and then having them dry hairs up.  Over time, this will ruin the brush.

She also doesn't mention how to stretch watercolor paper, which seems like a major oversight to me.  Watercolor paper will often buckle if you use a lot of water, so many artists will immerse the paper in water and stretch it first to help avoid this problem.

Other topics she skipped include: masking fluid (preserves the white of the paper), using white gouache as accents, use of salt and plastic wrap for special effects.

While there is only one walkthrough of a finished painting included, I feel that she illustrated her concepts so well throughout the rest of the DVD, that this is not a major detraction.

And finally, I realize I may be flamed for this, but I found her singing to be distracting.  She has a brief, unannounced interlude of singing right in the middle of the DVD before she gets into color theory.  It is a nice song, but I personally feel that it is better placed at the end, as it is in her followup DVD, ""The Dance of Watercolor: Luminosity, Luster, Iridescence.""

____OVERALL:____

Despite its significant drawbacks, I liked this DVD so much that after I borrowed it from the library, I purchased my own copy.  I highly recommend it to any beginning watercolorist, with the caveat that they might want to use another watercolor book to supplement for more step-by-step painting examples, additional techniques, and for more detailed explanations of key subjects like caring for brushes.  (Gordon MacKenzie's 'The Watercolorist's Essential Notebook,' and Marilyn Scott's 'Watercolor Artist's Bible' come to mind as excellent options.)

4.5 stars/5

Thanks for reading my review, and I hope it was helpful to you!",1351382400,11,3626,4.867862969004894
2833120,5,B000Q6ZLNE,"I just got this video. It is truly for very beginners (me). It teaches the very basics about how to apply paint of different consistencies to paper of varying degrees of wetness. It also covers the essentials of color mixing and suggests a good beginning palette to use. At the end there's a demo that you can try to replicate.  She paints a group of tree trunks, which looks really nice the way she did it (not the way I did it lol). She also shows how to correct common mistakes like blooms, going outside the lines or having paint dry too quickly. I've worked on her techniques for two days now and already feel like I have more control and can anticipate the paint's behavior. All in all, the beginning of a great series for those who can't attend her workshops. Will probably buy DVD 2 when I'm done with this one.",1321920000,,819,4.352941176470588
2833121,3,B000Q6ZLNE,I watched the first several lessons on this DVD and gave up. She had some basic valuable info but was just a little to 'cutesy' for me. That coupled with her choosing the most expensive brushes on the planet put me off. Just a little bit to boring for me. I switched over to Watercolor Essentials by O'Connor and was much happier.,1317945600,,330,4.338709677419355
2833122,3,B000Q6ZLNE,"This is a curious DVD.  I ordered it for two reasons.  1.  Living in France would an American dvd work for me (the english ones do, no problem).  STNC(hope that is the in the right order) all regions, works in France, its usually Pal 2 here.  2.  Some years ago I bought Ewa Karpinska's book Aquarelle, la lumire de l'eau. with many different colour charts a more sophisticated version of puddle, dot, dash pile but called miroir, brillante, mat ( categories), it is a abeautiful book but I never really got to terms with the painting process, so Julie's dvd promised to present a clear & simple demonstration of the flow of water and pigment, I learn better by watching than by reading.  When I went back to Ewa's book after seeing Julies dvd, it all made sense.  I have been watercolour painting for 20 years and have collected many superb dvds, starting with Alwyn Crawshaw, who paints the picture and generously shares his knowledge with you along the way, also Tony Crouch 'Mountain, streams, etc', E John Robinson for the sea, Karen Simmonds for flowers, and the two super stars Charles Reid and Shirley Trevenna. etc; etc;  No one better than Helen v an Wyke for oils!!
Julie's dvd is I suppose more modern, not so cosy as what I consider my dear friends, but when I tried to analyse it, puddle, dot, dash, works.  I looked at Turner's book of watercolours in Venice and found PDDW repeated time & time again.  I would like to put in a word about the Arches bloc recommended.  We usually leave the clean sheet in place on the bloc, easy to take into the garden or countryside with your paints, no paper flapping around, you can put as much water on it as you like, it stays stretched and will dry quite flat ready to be then taken off the bloc as demonstrated by Julie.  Once again, thank you Amazon for giving one these opportunities plus speedy delivery.",1297641600,2,1863,4.508928571428571
2833123,5,B000Q6ZLNE,Easy on the eyes and excellent presentation. Great for beginners like me. I learned a bunch and it helped me to be a better artist. Love her camera on paper progression technique. Shows you exactly how to do it.,1295481600,,211,4.435897435897436
2833124,5,B000Q6ZLNE,"I've looked at many watercolor instructional videos (for a whole website of them check out [...]) and Julie Cohn has come up with something unique for teaching the technique of watercolor.

She also has a warm, enthusiastic and supportive manner that is a pleasure to listen to.",1280016000,4,436,4.878378378378378
2833125,5,B000Q6ZLNE,"I love this DVD.  I've always wanted to watercolor, but always gave up in frustration over never being able to figure out how the dampness of the paper, the dilution of the paint, and the wetness of the brush all come together.  No more.  What I've banged my head against a wall for years has been answered in a flash.  Four steps of wetness for the brush, paper, and paint all beautifully explained.  In addition there is a great explanation of basic color theory, drawing,  and a landscape demo.  I'd highly recommend this DVD to any beginner and to anyone else who finds the technique of watercolor frustrating.

This isn't your typical ""this is how to paint a tree/house/vase/flower"" kind of DVD.  Julie Cohn seems to be much more interested in giving artists tools for self expression than is training people to copy her.",1279929600,6,826,4.680555555555555

2833127,5,B000Q6ZLNE,"This is a great DVD! Julie has a patient, easy manner, and it is very helpful that she gives speicfic names to the wetness of paper, brushes and paint mixtures on the palette.

2833128,5,B000Q6ZLNE,"Julie's first DVD, ""The Dance of Watercolor"" really got me feeling comfortable and excited about painting with watercolor - she has a gentle supportive and clear style that really comes through on the DVD, and in her demos; I am now painting with much more confidence, so I was so pleased when she came out with her second DVD, titled ""The Dance of Watercolor -Luminosity, Luster, Iridescence"" which really takes you to the next step of achieving those wonderful glowing effects with watercolor - you will be amazed with what the paint will do when you follow the exercises on the second DVD. I highly recommend both!",1262736000,,617,4.775700934579439

2833131,3,B000Q6ZLNE,"This video is a relaxed version of instruction that could complement a more advanced beginner's watercolor experience.  Obviously a very talented watercolorist and instructor, Julie Cohn provides wonderfully calming examples and demonstrates accurate techniques.  However, care of brushes and accurate terminology are necessary in preparatory instruction.  Both are not obvious enough in this video, and would require a teacher's interruption of the video to give clarification and terminology emphasis.  For example, one should never squeeze and pull on the bristles of the brush to remove water; instead, squeeze and dab the brush gently, which she does, but does not mention.  The gentle rubbing to remove the water or to flatten the bristles needs clarification to ward off students' pulling out the bristles.  Also, the terms glazed, layered/overlapped, opaque, transparent, and semitransparent, blended and graded, wash, hatch, stipple, and dry-brush would be on my students' ""sampler"" charts, along with her terms of moisture content: puddle, dot, dash, and pile.  Julie Cohn's emphasis on achieving effective application using moisture control makes this relaxing video useful to an educator on a personal talent improvement level, and provides diversion from the stilted, but required discipline of the classroom: possibly a good application review prior to first painting.  I will definitely use her beneficial idea of dancing with watercolor.",1243814400,34,1453,5.757009345794392
2833132,5,B000Q6ZLNE,"The Dance of Watercolor-Beginners and Beyond by Julie Cohn is excellent.

What makes this DVD special, is the method of combining the degree of wetness of the paint with the degree of wetness of the paper.  It sounds simple, but when you get it right, the paint really does dance.  Once I realized what Ms. Cohn was saying, it totally changed the results I was getting.  There is some stuff on color mixing and other odds and ends that are covered again and again elsewhere, but she had to put it in for completeness.  This DVD was well worth the cost.
