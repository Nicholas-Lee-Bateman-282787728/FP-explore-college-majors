8258308,4,B0015ESZ8O,"A snob daughter (Dorothy Libaire as Mona Stewart) of a wealthy man (William P. Carleton as Jerome Stewart) throws a hissy-fit when he announces plans to marry someone she doesn't approve up.  To spite him she convinces the first nitwit (Richard Skeets Gallagher as Ronnie) she runs into, to marry her.  Let's elope, that'll fix him!  So they hop a train and head for Niagara.  ""Come on Mona, cheer up.  You'd think we were married already.""  She soon realizes though, however funny Ronnie is, the alcoholic jokester isn't someone she'd like to be stuck with for long so she ditches him the first chance she gets and takes up with an ex-com would-be highway robber (David Manners as David Mannering).  This ill-fated hookup leads to murder and time in jail.  Can she prove he's innocent!  Will they fall in love!  Will she ever stop being such a selfish ninny?

The best part of this movie is Skeets Gallagher.  He has the best lines and the best role as the slightly soused knucklehead willing to do anything for the unappreciative Mona Stewart.  ""Are you supposed to take your hat off in jail?  I've forgotten, it's been so long.""",1433462400,2,1131,4.675126903553299
8258309,5,B0015ESZ8O,"Fun movie! However, I don't understand why the former reviewer felt compelled to reveal the ending in his review.

As an avid David Manners fan, I loved seeing him in a role where he was not clad in a tuxedo! I didn't even recognize him or his voice at first, playing a rogue and a bit of a scamp! Too bad the Alpha quality was so poor. It's like a 3rd generation dub and very dark in places. Also you have to strain to guess what the actors are actually saying. Still it's a fun movie. Until TCM decides to air it and give David Manners his due respect, it's worth seeing. You won't be disappointed. Also Dorothy Libaire is a breath of fresh air as well as the drunken former suitor (Skeets Gallagher).",1413763200,,703,4.246268656716418
8258310,3,B0015ESZ8O,"It's ok, not exactly what I expected, not too much mystery and I didn't care for Dorothy Libaire's character or her Dad's character. I did remember David Manners voice from the old westerns I watched on Saturday mornings as a kid. It's ok, but not one I'd recommend to a friend.",1406678400,,278,4.470588235294118
8258311,5,B0015ESZ8O,"This 1935 Majestic Pictures production, which was thought lost until recently, is a wonderful find for fans of David Manners, the handsome lead, who stared in 38 films in the 1930s. It is interesting that his character name in The Perfect Clue is David Mannering...I don't know if that was done on purpose, but it's an odd coincidence otherwise. If you like early 1930s films, and if you want to see David Manners in a perfectly romantic role, this is for you.",1229817600,13,460,4.621951219512195

A perfectly agreeable little mystery/romance from Majestic Pictures, one of the minor Hollywood companies that churned out second features during the 1930's.  Top-billed David Manners plays a man recently released from prison for a crime he didn't commit who becomes involved with a madcap runaway heiress (Dorothy Libaire); later, he is accused of murder and Libaire tracks down the real culprits, paving the way for a happy ending. The two leads carry the film with their charming performances, ably supported by Richard ""Skeets"" Gallagher as Libaire's alcohol-loving former suitor.  The film runs just over an hour, and director Robert G. Vignola keeps the action humming along at a pleasingly brisk pace.

Alpha Video's transfer is fair to middling; the video is a little soft, and the soundtrack has some startling jumps and pops.  However, the print is complete, and considering the lack of care that many of these B movies were subjected to over the years, it's fortunate that the film survived at all.  Recommended for B movie buffs as well as fans of the handsome and talented David Manners.",1208822400,12,1154,5.079365079365079
