It is a very well researched documentary about the vampire figure.  It cover its legend, literature and authors, Vlad Tepes, ancient and modern crimes, some movies, real vampires, and Dr. Les Prince (Birmingham University) gives some scientific points of view.
Although some of the facts are very well known to the public, it also gives the perspective from different cultures and countries.
I like the editing, since sometimes, the narrator voice stops, and some actors playing little roles introduce the information.
If you like vampires you'll probably like it.  Maybe you can discover some good books to read of which you have never heard about...",1158624000,,756,4.94488188976378
