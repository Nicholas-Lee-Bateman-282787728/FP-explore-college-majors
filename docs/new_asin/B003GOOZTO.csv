8396496,3,B003GOOZTO,"""Vivere"" replays the same events from the three different viewpoints of the three heroines, and when you see them all you understand what really happened, how and why. This riddle solving is superbly constructed and is pretty satisfying, but for some reason the main story itself lacks the punch. Francesca's flirtation with Gerlinde feels abrupt and not very convincing. The inexplicably inept father is just a distraction. It feels that there is too much focus on the subtle emotions of each character, and the main message becomes blurry and fails to deliver.
I did not like the use of English music throughout the movie either. Maybe that is the way it really is in Dutch/German music scene today, I do not know enough, but it robbed me of the feeling that I was watching a German movie.

Vivere does not do anything wrong: the acting is solid and the cinematography is beautiful, but it did not leave me with a lasting impression either.",1331683200,3,942,4.779141104294479
