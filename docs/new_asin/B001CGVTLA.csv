8287648,4,B001CGVTLA,"I enjoy listening to  Coleman Barks reciting Rumis poetry, even if the entire production isn't polished.  What is positive is:  Once everybody got comfortable  and relaxed about the fact  "" it's SHOW TIME!""  on stage,  performance improved.  Adequate number of poems recited, besides, how many is enough in space of a DVD?  Hope this helps someone.",1395878400,,348,5.071428571428571
8287649,4,B001CGVTLA,"Coleman Barks reads Rumi with a southern accent, but with a Persian heart.  His voice becomes balm -- it's nice to have visual as well as audio connection with the readings.  Recommend it for lovers of Rumi's poetry.",1363219200,,216,4.657894736842105
8287650,5,B001CGVTLA,"This is an amazing listen. If you like poetry and are of a spiritual nature, then this ones for you. Barks puts a spark into the reading of Rumi. JS Tucson, AZ",1298160000,3,159,4.0
