8708150,3,B00USBLY7O,"This is apparently the pilot film for the unsuccessful 2011 TV series ""Clunkers"". The action takes place in Houston at Ray Ray's used car sales and normally on a Thursday. The plot consists of episodes that have little to no connection to each other. Ray Ray (Sherman Hemsley) owns the dealership. Ritchie (Carl Anthony Payne II) is a problem salesman whose troubles are compounded when they hire a new guy (Clayton Thomas).

The writing is failed TV series trite. It has some mildly humorous segments, but needed some good knock-out lines. There is some implied sex behind closed doors as well as some token legs and cleavage shots.

Not offensive, but not really funny either.",1436572800,,678,4.886956521739131
