508010,3,6302763932,"I first saw this gem on TV in the mid 1970s on a Saturday afternoon.  It frightened me as a child and fascinates me as an adult.  Another in a string of William Castle shockers, this film has a great performance from Barbara Stanwyck along with plenty of cheesy thrills and campy dialogue as only Castle can deliver (""When I'm awake with you my life is like a nightmare!"").  Memorable music adds to the spell.  The recent horror hit ""House of Wax"" pays homage to ""The Night Walker"" in a key scene.  Why isn't this on DVD?",1122854400,12,521,4.329896907216495

She kicks with her pumps and screams with her gin-cracked voice!  The bizarre score enhances the creepiness of the film, an atmoshpere which otherwise mostly comes from the bad screenwriting--that kind of creepy!  Robert Taylor, Stanwyck's ex-husband acts with her in this one as well as Lloyd Bochner as ""The Dream"".  If you even mildly appreciate William Castle and creepy, campy classics, get it for a huge belly laugh, you won't be disappointed...Stanwyck at her worst-best!!",1121472000,6,599,5.340425531914893

The first ten minutes or so are a bit hokey but once the story kicks in the suspense builds.  It's in black and white but it is great cause they utilize shadows and fog to create suspense; and the music totally fits the genre. I can hear the music in my head as I write this; da da da da dum.  My nephew once bragged how he could watch any horror movie.  I put Night Walker in for him to watch.  By the end of the movie he was watching it with his baseball hat tilted over his head and his hands over his face.  He couldn't sleep that night, he was so scared.  We wound up spending the night playing Nitendo.  Yeah, it's definitely a B-movie but one of the greatest B-movies I've ever seen.  It's a tradition in our home to watch it at least once a year.

I picked up mid-stream, where the Hair Dresser named Joyce just been stabbed in the back with a dagger while she was closing the curtains to the doorway.  The scene of this girl stagering around with the dagger sticking into her upper back stayed on my mind for several years.
I would love to see this movie get a remake in color, but keep the scene of Joyce getting the dagger in the back, for that was the coolest part of the whole movie!",1048464000,2,505,4.3052631578947365
508015,5,6302763932,"""Together again!"" blurted the ads for this William Castle thriller. The ads meant, of course,former husband and wife Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck, who had a rather acrimonious divorce in the early 1950s. ""Everyone probably thought we were going to beat each other up"", said ""Missy"" Stanwyck, when asked about how their screen reunion went. Well, they didn't beat each other up, but gave good performances in this Robert ""Psycho"" Bloch-scripted film, one of William Castle's best. ""The Night Walker"" is the tale of attractive Irene Trent (Stanwyck), who is married to blind, jealous and abusive scientist Howard Trent, played by Hayden Rourke (He was ""Captain Bellows"" on TV's ""I Dream of Jeannie""!). Marriage to Howard, in Irene's words, ""Is like a nightmare!"" In her frustration, she dreams of a young, handsome and attentive lover, and talks in her sleep. Howard accuses her of having an affair with their attorney, Barry Morland (Taylor). They quarrel,(Stanwyck's tirade is a masterpiece of vitriol!), she runs out of their gloomy old mansion, and Howard is incinerated in a mysterious explosion in his laboratory. Irene, feeling uncomfortable living in the house, moves into the small apartment behind the beauty parlor she owns. Her dreams of a dream lover continue, (Are they dreams? Are they real?) and then they become terrifying nightmares. She sees Howard, his face hideously burned, and her ""dream lover"" (Lloyd Bochner) marries her in a positively frightening ceremony in an abandoned chapel. Irene begins to doubt her own sanity...Surprisingly, ""The Night Walker"" was a box-office dud. It is a very entertaining film, with a great cast, which includes familiar old faces such as Rochelle Hudson, Marjorie Bennett, Jess Barker, and Tetsu Komai (he was one of the manimals in ""Island of Lost Souls""). ""Missy"" Stanwyck looks great, though she possessed one of the most unmelodious screams ever heard on screen (it sounds like a foghorn!), but she gives, as always, a believable performance. She was great. Robert Taylor is good, though he was never one of my favorites, and his once-handsome face had not aged well, and his bad facelift did not help matters. The musical score is rather noteworthy. It was composed by Vic Mizzy, who has, to his credit, ""The Addams Family"", ""Green Acres"", ""The Pruitts of Southhampton"", and a quartet of Don Knotts comedies, including ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"". It is a very entertaining, catchy score, praised by Bernard Herrmann! The picture quality on this tape is excellent, and the original teaser trailer is loads of fun (""Do you dream of SEX?"") So, for an enjoyable 85 minutes, curl up with a bowl of popcorn and ""The Night Walker""! Pleasant dreams....",1036713600,20,2710,5.1058558558558556
508016,5,6302763932,"I have been a fan of this little oddity ever since I saw it on it's release in 1964---I was 9 yrs old and thought it was the weirdest thing I'd ever seen. Well, I'm a big boy now and I still love this movie. It's one of Castle's oddest films. He enlisted Barbara Stanwyck for this tale of dreams VS. reality VS. sanity and spooked it up nicely with bizarre flourishes like the chapel ""wedding"" scene and scenes where Stanwyck thinks she's still dreaming and can't wake up. Stanwyck gives it her touch of class all the way and screams her head off as shock after shock are heaped upon her.  It's rather low budget and nicely done in b&w with a memorable film score that sticks in my head for days when I hear it. Lloyd Bochner is in sinister form as ""The Dream"", one-time Stanwyck husband Robert Taylor
 is fine as her attorney and Hayden Rorke (from TV's ""I Dream of Jeannie"") is her blind husband who may or not be dead. He stalks her in her nightmares. Bizarre and very well done. ""The Night Walker"" really deserves to be on DVD as part of Castle's
horror collection.",1031875200,10,1069,4.313432835820896
508017,2,6302763932,"Poor Barbara Stanwyk.  Though she was one of the best actresses of  the century, and one who gave some of the most memorable perfomances (""Double Indenity"", for instance), she, for the most part, got the dirty end of the stick career-wise.  Witness this movie.  Joan and Bette got the grade A of the B pictures at least at first.  Barbara got this.  The movie is full of holes that I could park my car in, and that is understating the size of the holes.  Most of the time Barbara is required to stand there screaming at some sort of menace that she could avoid by simply leaving the room, and her nightly nightmare (warning- SPOILER COMING!) since it involves explosions, would, I think wake the neighbors maybe.  Characters are introduced as plot points only to be killed in the next scene, we are asked to believe that after an explosion that destroys three stories of her house, that Barbara is allowed to live there, since it was ""confined to the lab"", and that in her ""dreams"" that she is driven all over Los Angeles, and when she shows the location of the ""dreams"" for the authorities,  they pooh-pooh her cause like, the curtains don't match her description.  All of it ends with Lloyd Bochner smacking Robert Taylor upside the head with a rubber hose, a few extras stabbed, every phone line in L.A. cut, and Barbara laughing over a big hole.  In which, if it weren't for ""Big Valley"" her career might have lain.

508111,4,6302763932,"William Castle is no Fellini, but he knows how to put on a good show, and the Night Walker is arguably his best (though I still have yet to see I Saw What You Did).  Yes, there is a definite camp factor.  Yes, there is some cheeziness and a made for-tv feel for some of the crummier scenes.  But Castle is such a showman in his best scenes that you're not apt to notice these minor deficiencies (the guy is an entertainer with a capital ""E"").

Along the way, he creates some genuinely spooky otherworldly dream landscapes for Barbara Stanwyck to stumble entranced through.  It's not exactly subtle, but it has its charms.  Not least of which is the groovy music score.

Somebody put it out on DVD!",1360368000,,697,4.3984375
508112,3,6302763932,"William Castle had a memorable reign in ""B"" horror films, making entertainingly clunky movies with semi-lurid titles like The House on Haunted Hill, The Tingler, Homocidal, Mr. Sardonicus, and Thirteen Ghosts.  Most of these films used some sort of gimmick to lure the public in: The Tingler had ""Percepto"" and Homocidal had a ""Fright Break.""  But with Night Walker, Castle relied on a different sort of gimmick, the celluloid reunion of Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Taylor.

Stanwyck and Taylor met in 1936 and were married in 1939.  Both were rumored to be bisexual, and both seem to have been fairly unfaithful to each other, but it wasn't until one of Taylor's conquests threatened to go public that Stanwyck felt the need to take action.  With the press having a field day, she divorced Taylor, and although she had later love affairs she never remarried and she left many with the impression that Taylor was the love of her life.  Their tumultous love life was expected to add spice--and box office--to The Night Walker.

Irene (Stanwyck) is an attractive older woman trapped in a loveless marriage with blind scientist Howard (Hayden Rorke.)  Her husband is unreasonably possessive, becomes jealous when Irene begins have dreams about a young lover, and suspects Irene of having an affair with his lawyer Barry (Robert Taylor.)  When Howard is killed in a laboratory accident, Irene's dreams become even more vivid and now disturbing and unpleasant, including fantasies of a young lover and terrors of her dead husband.  Afraid for her own sanity, Irene goes to Barry for help, and he helps her prove her dreams have a basis in reality.  But who is this dream lover (Lloyd Bockner) who reappears night after night?  And is possible that Howard is still alive?

Rorke, Meredith, and Bockner are clunky but serviceable.  Robert Taylor is a disaster; his looks have greatly faded, he wears more make up than any woman in the film, and he slides by with as little effort as possible.  The script by Robert Bloch (who wrote the novel Psycho) is ho-hum, and the solution to the mystery becomes increasingly obvious as the movie progresses.  On the other hand, Stanwyck turns in a solid and occasionally memorable performance, and the film is sometimes unexpectedly atmospheric.  But if Castle was counting on the public's memory of Stanwyck and Taylor's relationship to fuel box office, he was mistaken.  The film was not an outright flop, but it didn't do as well as his other horror and thriller films.  Although most other Castle films from this period have been released to DVD, The Night Walker has not, and to date it is available only in out-of-print VHS copies.  Worth looking for if you are a Castle fan, but otherwise you might want to wait for a late night showing.

There is an introductory speech that ends by saying anyone who dreams becomes a night walker. Then we see a man looking at a sleeping woman. Mr. Trent is sightless, he talks to Barry. He has a tape recording of that sleeping woman, his wife Irene. Howard is suspicious of another man. Mr. Morland is his attorney. There is more talk. Then an accidental fire causes damage and the death of Howard. But Irene has scary dreams of smoke and her dead husband. She decides to leave the mansion and move to a smaller apartment in the beauty parlor she owns in town.

At midnight she awakes to a tapping noise; a man enters her room. Who are you? Dreams have no names he replies. Or is this a dream? At 6 pm Irene meets Barry for dinner; they talk. She tells about her dream; does she need a doctor? Barry asks about her late husband! At night she has the same dream. They go for a ride to a large building. Champagne and candles? They leave and drive to another place, a chapel. There is a wedding. Or is it a dream? Can she wake up? Yes. Barry returns to take her to a strange building. Can she remember where? More strange events follow. Can you guess the ending?

7830669,4,6302763932,"Sadly not available on DVD at time of writing, ""The Night Walker"" seems
to be one of William Castles more neglected films. It tells the tale of
a woman named Irene,who is haunted by strange recurring dreams, which
she eventually cannot distinguish from reality. Is she going mad or is
something more sinister happening?

As usual with a Castle film, the production is effectively made, even
with the evident low budget, the lighting and photography and
performances are all well handled. Barbara Stanwyck makes a good effort
in the leading role, and the supporting cast is fine too.

The story starts off in a fairly intriguing way with a bizarre prologue
about dreams that has some superb kitsch imagery, and there are a few
chilling moments as Irene starts to experience her weird dreams. As
with a lot of William Castle movies there are just a handful of
exceptional scare moments that really stand out...I sometimes wonder if
this a fluke when he does this, but he can create some of the most
delicious scares, such as the blind hag in ""House on Haunted Hill"" and
the mute woman's hallucinations in ""The Tingler"". Well there are a
couple of shriek moments even in this more humble offering, one down to
the appearance of a ghoulish figure in fright make-up, and another,
when Irene think she has woken up from a dream, only to realise in
terror that she has not, and seems incapable of waking up at all, which
is quite a deep concept for the general tone of the movie.

Sadly at the half way point, things become less dreamlike and more
mechanical as a few truths are revealed and the layers of mystery are
stripped away. The last 20 minutes does not equal the first hour at
all, which may be part of the reason why few people rate this very
highly. Still, its a competent and entertaining piece of work, and
definitely worth seeing. What a shame it's impossible to find",1423785600,7,1874,4.604790419161676

Irene leaves the house and tries to get her life back in order by moving back to her small apartment in the back of a beauty salon she owns. But living under the oppressive jealousy of her late husband may have driven Irene a bit mad, because at night she has fantastic dreams about a dark lover that whisks her around town, getting married in a bizarre fashion and while on the surface these dreams seem pleasant, there is a dark under-current and as the dreams intensify Irene begins to wonder if they are really dreams at all, and for some reason she finds herself drawn back to the burned out house she shared with her cruel husband.
