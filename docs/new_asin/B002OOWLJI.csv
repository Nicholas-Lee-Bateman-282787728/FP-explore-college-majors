4618094,5,B002OOWLJI,"Many thanks to Shout! Factory - leave it to the guys who founded the original Rhino Records to do the right thing and issue the three previously unissued seasons!!  This one's a doozie - including guests like Dr. Joyce Brothers, Harry Hamlin, Brian Setzer, and the amazing Elton John, it's definitely one of Fran Fine's finer seasons.

Unfortunately, one of the funniest episodes also includes Michael Bolton as a guest (trying to sing opera, no less, as if he could sing at all).  This I could have done without, though the episode redeems itself with a first class plot line.",1451088000,,577,4.75

4618097,5,B002OOWLJI,Ok...I love the show.  I have watched it multiple times and her digs on people are hysterical.  Sometimes you have to replay to catch them all.  I see something new every time I watch.  I can't say enough how funny these shows.  Try them...,1300492800,4,240,4.363636363636363
4618098,5,B002OOWLJI,"This isn't the best sit-com, and it certainly doesn't have the best acting, but it is hilarious. The show is overflowing with sarcasm and irreverence. Fran Drescher is great as a nanny who doesn't respect boundaries - both personal and comedic. I love how Niles personifies the sarcastic butler. The kids are adorable, especially Grace, who talks back with an attitude. Every once in a while when I watch ""The Nanny"" I find myself bursting with laughter.

Unfortunately, the show didn't get much attention when it was on. Some of its cultural references are outdated (frequent references to the Clintons and Dolly Parton). However, if you didn't catch it while it was being aired, these DVDs are definitely worth checking out.",1263168000,6,726,5.0

8462604,4,B002OOWLJI,"The fashionably funny Fran Drescher is back for more in this 1997-98 Season of this semi-old school 90's sitcom that ran on CBS from 1993-99,  with style and flair to spare. Additionally, Fran Fine (Drescher) is fully ensconced as the comedic caregiver to the Sheffield children. But her ""Will they or won't they? "", romance with dreamy Broadway producer Maxwell Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy) just might lead to a big promotion: from babysitter to bride! Will the producer pop the question? Will the nanny tie the knot?

Also starring Daniel Davis(Niles), Lauren Lane(C.C. Babcock), Nicholle Tom(Maggie), Benjamin Salisbury(Brighton), and Madeline Zima (not to mention an array of guest stars including Ray Charles, Chevy Chase, Whoopi Goldberg and Elton John), and more laughs than you can shake a shtick at, The Nanny: Season Five is another irresistible collection of comedic hijinks you cant help but say I do to.",1515628800,,919,5.244897959183674
