5058734,5,B0076ZMKXC,My two-year old daughter asks to watch these and she is already starting to say a few words and phrases.,1367452800,,104,4.25
5058735,5,B0076ZMKXC,"I am thankful to Dino Lingo for creating this program for teaching children basic Japanese. There really isn't a lot of resources out there for teaching kids Japanese right now! This set is a great option for a family who wants to expose their children to other languages at a young age (Dino Lingo offers DVDs in MANY languages other than Japanese too). It might be wonderful for a family planning to host a student visiting from Japan, or a bilingual family who wants to expose their children to as much Japanese as possible. I think these DVD's would also be great to show at a bilingual/immersion language school.",1360713600,,617,4.669724770642202
5058736,5,B0076ZMKXC,"I teach French language to preschoolers, and have explored many foreign language learning programs, but have been searching for some time for a Dutch program for children with little success.  I purchased Dino Lingo Dutch for Kids to use with my 19-month old and am so impressed by the quality of this program.  The music, the graphics and the presentation of vocabulary on the DVDs are superior to that of any other foreign language program I have seen or used before.  The vocabulary is repeated multiple times but always in a way engaging to children so it seems new and exciting.  The DVDs keep my son interested and dancing to the music.  The graphics are so impressive and the vocabulary taught is useful and easy to reinforce with him throughout the day.  The flashcards and posters are invaluable tools to aid the learning process.  The set was well-worth every dollar I spent, and it is something the whole family can enjoy and do together.  I cannot recommend this product enough as a mom, but as a language professional I can see that it is based upon solid second language acquisition research and I know that it will successfully engage children to learn Dutch.  A very superior product!",1357689600,4,1200,4.758454106280193
5058737,1,B0076ZMKXC,"Yes it does teach mine  kids dutch, but as a native speaker think they charge too much. For the same money i could have bought more books with cd's and could have taught them even more words and phrases. 50 dollars would it  be worth for the time they put in it. If not for the flash cards and other posters i would want to pay even less.

update:
now that i have a android tablet i went on the apps store and found apps that teaches  dutch and they are free. if you pay for them you get even more content to learn dutch. so if you have a tablet go find it on the apps store and leave the box set. i gave it 2 stars because it was too expensive , but now i would only give it 1 star because its way too expensive and sinds almost everybody has a tablet now it would a lot cheaper to just download the apps. you would learn just as much for FREE and a lot more if you pay just a little for them. and i think it goes without saying for the rest of their products in other languages.",1356393600,,980,3.8366336633663365
5058738,4,B0076ZMKXC,Purchased this product over a month ago.  My six year old has been enamored by the program and has picked up quite a bit vocabulary and grammar from the videos.,1345766400,,160,4.333333333333333
5058739,5,B0076ZMKXC,"Played this for my 5 year old, but the 10 year olds were just as interested in it as the 5 year old.  This is a great program and had my kids completely engaged in learning.  Half the time I don't even think they realized they were learning!",1342137600,3,241,4.0
5058740,5,B0076ZMKXC,My sons had learned a little bit of spanish from Dora the explorer on TV< but aside from that had never been exposed to other languages. However with in 5 minutes of watching the Dutch session they were both running around saying different words in dutch! They seemed to have an extremely good understanding of what they were saying as well! I am SO thrilled about Dino Lingo!! We will definitely be using Dino Lingo Programs in general to help advance our children's speech and language abilities!,1341878400,,498,4.735632183908046
5058741,4,B0076ZMKXC,These language CD's are very cute. We tried the free Japanese lesson on the site so far and just from that alone my daughter has learned something. I can't wait to buy her the whole set and really see what she can do!,1341878400,,217,4.069767441860465
5058742,5,B0076ZMKXC,I always am looking to advance myself as well as my little one. What I loved about this one was the colors and graphics really attracted my little one. She really liked the characters and was just as enjoyable as her fav. NickJr. cartoons.,1341878400,3,239,4.454545454545454
5058743,5,B0076ZMKXC,These Japanese kids DVDs are great.  They come with flash cards and my kids both love them.  The characters are very creative and cute.  My kids have learned several Japanese phrases.  I am definately going to check out other languages.  I purchased the Spanish DVD language set as well.,1335398400,6,287,4.775510204081633
8511340,5,B0076ZMKXC,"My kids watch a DVD every afternoon and have already memorized number counting, colors, and animals. The show is entertaining for children yet easy enough for them to comprehend.",1514937600,,178,5.172413793103448
8511341,5,B0076ZMKXC,My girls love it!,1504137600,,17,3.5
8511342,4,B0076ZMKXC,"Just a few complaints: The flash cards have sharp corners, and the dvds are extremely loud compared to other dvds. Also, I am not sure it is a good thing that the verbs are presented with the ""-deru"" endings. I learned them as ""-masu"" in japanese class.",1488499200,,253,4.404255319148936
8511343,3,B0076ZMKXC,". . . but the product itself only deserves 3.5 stars.  The little cards lack ""de,"" ""het,"" etc. when I can't imagine trying to build or maintain language skills w/o knowing masculine v. feminine. Um, they're also BLANK on the back, so they aren't flashcards if you're expecting that type of learning tool.  And some of their posters lack words. WUWD? Isn't this language learning? Again though, five-star customer service. Good enough DVDs.",1450915200,,439,5.0
8511344,5,B0076ZMKXC,We bought the Japanese learning DVDs for our son who is just starting to speak. He loves all the animations and tries to repeat some of the words. The DVDs are structured very well and easy to follow! It is really important for him to learn Japanese and this is helping him a lot!,1433376000,,280,4.203703703703703
8511345,4,B0076ZMKXC,Kids really seem to like it.  Videos are very skilled at keeping their attention ... frequently changing visuals or topics to draw them back in.  And I was plesantly suprised at how well it does at building on prior topics as you progress thru the DVDs.,1432598400,,253,4.478260869565218
8511346,4,B0076ZMKXC,My Wife Anita uses this to teach her grandson Dutch and has found the cd and cards very helpful as he Dutch is quite rusty.,1422489600,,123,3.96
8511347,4,B0076ZMKXC,Good product my child loves it. It would be great if there was a product that was more advanced for older children as the words are definitely being absorbed by my child and he loves the animation,1405382400,,196,4.324324324324325
8511348,1,B0076ZMKXC,"Really disapointed with this dvd! Very basic! Words are just in dutch, no english translations so some words you are insure what they mean!?! Very expensive for such a poor dvd! I could do better myself for a lot less money!",1386288000,,224,4.487804878048781
8511349,3,B0076ZMKXC,we use it for our toddler (almost 3) and some of the music and characters are maybe geared to a bit older kids some loud music almost disco/party music on the cd's as well. But he is picking up more words. I think it is a bit overpriced at $ 100....,1372032000,,249,3.9019607843137254
