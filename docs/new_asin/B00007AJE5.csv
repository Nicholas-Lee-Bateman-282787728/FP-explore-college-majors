1803438,5,B00007AJE5,A rather posh young man(Ian Carmichael) graduates from Oxford University intending to become a Captain of Industry. Owing to his honesty and naievety he does not interview well and ends up as fork lift driver at his uncle's (Denis Price) defense plant. He finds a poweful union boss(Peter Sellers) and a somewhat unscrupulous personnel director(Terry-Thomas) along with some executives (uncle plus Dickie Attenborough) working a shady arms deal with a third world country. Carmichael has a 1950s chaste encounter with the delightful Liz Fraser (Sellers daughter) and inadvertently precipitates a strike and is used by all as a scapegoat to restore labor peace. The movie is a satire and full of fun. Enjoy its hilarity. Dont take it seriously.,1039996800,5,743,5.2521008403361344
1803479,5,B00007AJE5,"If you enjoy satire and dialogue, then you'll love this movie, which was made in approx. 1959, and stars Peter Sellers, Ian Carmichael, and Terry-Thomas, and a teriffic supporting cast.  The basic story is the clash between the British aristocracy and Labour classes in the period shortly after the end of WWII, with a subtext of missile sales to the Middle East. As you might imagine, with Peter Sellers playing both an aristrocrat and a labour organizer who is a confirmed disciple of Lenin (until circumstances collide with dogma), and with Terry-Thomas playing middle-management, the results are hilarious! You'll see the origins of Archie and Edith Bunker, and perhaps even the Beatles were inspired by this film. Remember ""Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band""? There's a reference in there to ""Mr Kite"", and I think that the next time any of us run into into either Paul Mc Cartney or Ringo Starr, we  should ask them if they'd seen this film. Be sure to see this if you like satire/dialogue/superb acting!",1205798400,2,1013,4.918128654970761
1803480,5,B00007AJE5,"Recently elected into the British Cinema's Top 100 Films, I'm All Right Jack is a delight. I saw it on the big screen in 1960 (produced in 59), I remember being entrhralled by Liz Frasier in a tight sweater and how funny Ian Carmichael and Terry Thomas were and knocked out by Peter Sellers (in his breakout role as shop steward Mr Kite). It still holds up as I watched it again yesterday. It's charming and witty in the best British tradition, Richard Attenborough, Margaret Rutherford and a host of English stars enliven this post war satire about trade unions, commerce and the press in Great Britian. Smashing fun.",1184371200,,618,4.678899082568807
1803481,4,B00007AJE5,"The strength of so many British films has always been in the depth of character players available to populate the films. Hand a really good script to those players and invariably something memorable evolved. ""I'm All Right Jack"" is an hilarious satire which manages to skewer the union movement, the aristocracy and the class system, but it's the players who make this such an entertaining and rollicking farce:

- Ian Carmichael as the upper class twit, Stanley Windrush, looking for a career in industry in the post war industrial landscape. His scenes in the candy factory, makers of Num Yum, and the detergent manafacturer, makers of Detto and Frisco, ""Detto is aimed at the young housewife"", are hysterical.
- Peter Sellers as the shop steward with a recognisable moustache and his dreams of going to Russia to visit the cornfields and attend ballet in the evening.
- Irene Handle as his wife - ""Seems to me the only time you ever do any work is when you are on strike"" she says to Sellers before she too goes out on strike and returns to Aunt Edie.
- Liz Fraser as their buxom daughter - ""Are them you own teeth?"" to Stanley as they kiss in a bubble car beside a rubbish dump.
- Terry Thomas as the sleazy manager of the munitions factory where the trouble starts and who is appalled by the contents of the suggestion box, but pockets them for further reference - ""Did a bit of time and motion myself last night - red head, rather athletic"".
- Margaret Rutherford as Stanley's aristocratic Aunt Dolly, completely condescending to the working classes - ""He won't have to join one of those horrible unions?  I do so hate violence"", says she to Uncle Bertie, Denis Price, the owner of the munitions factory and instigator of the bribery and corruption around which the plot revolves.

These are just a sample of the wonderful characters you will meet and laugh at and with. The DVD includes the original trailer and there is a biographical essay on Sellers but that's it for extras. The DVD print is excellent but a commentary about the players or the film would have been welcome because there must be a great story behind the Boulting Brothers who wrote, produced and directed the film.",1178755200,5,2191,4.656330749354005
1803482,5,B00007AJE5,"A wonderful satirical kick in the pants to labor unions and money-grabbing management alike. Two company heads scheme with a foreign diplomat to get the workers at one factory to go on strike so a contract will go to the other company - at a higher rate. Ian Carmichael, a daft upper-class innocent, is unwittingly brought in to bring the strike about. Carmichael's factory strike soon spreads across the whole country after he reveals to the press what's going on, and Britain is soon paralyzed. Peter Sellers plays the union head, with his Hitler mustache and empty talk of communism: the slap at the once-sacred cow of labor (the unions) is right on target. But labor is not the only target of the satire here: management is also laid low in its willingness to rob the country for its own profits. Brilliantly funny all around. Definitely worth a watch.",1142812800,8,856,4.751677852348993
1803483,5,B00007AJE5,"Speak the truth and a base man will ignore you, said William Blake, which is presumably why this brilliant satire seems to have been ignored, everywhere except Britain, where anyone who has seen it has remembered it ever since. Perhaps the verbal nuances are too subtle for the rest of the world. I loved the viewer who mentions Carmichael's ""chaste"" encounter with Liz Fraser. Few Britons would have failed to cotton on to the spindle-polishing gag. But it has to be in-your-face these days. Pauline Kael seems to have thought it was a ""cynical, raucous, farce"". Misses by a mile or two. The types in this scathing tale are so true to life it's incredible: they're still around, but so dumbed down today they aren't funny any longer. Sellers is sublime as Kite, soaring to a height compared with which the clumsy knockabout of Clouseau, or the appalling ""Being There"", belong in the gutter. What a tragic descent for poor old Peter. A very frank and enlightened biography of Sellers comes with this disc. Carmichael is equally superb, as is Terry-Thomas, Attenborough, Price, Handl, Rutherford, the lot. All these actors understood exactly what the Boultings were getting at, and responded with performances of genius. Of course, the writing and plot-structuring is ultimately what makes any film, and the Boultings were masterly. On a par with Voltaire.",1133481600,9,1355,5.0
1803484,5,B00007AJE5,"One of the greatest, and most willfully misunderstood, movie comedies ever.  Although still lauded in Britain as a searing indictment of trade unionism, its greatness lies in its even-handed treatment of unions and bosses alike.  Sellers's portrayal of the union leader Fred Kite was so brilliant that it tended to overshadow the performance of Dennis Price as the crooked boss, and Ian Carmichael's poor, honest scapegoat caught in the middle.  But the entire cast is great.  Talking of which, was there ever such a wealth of comedy acting talent as in 50s and 60s British cinema?

The title comes from a saying common at the time: ""F*** you Jack, I'm all right!"" which had Bowdlerized variants like ""Up yours, Jack..."" and ""Blow you Jack..."" and which reflected a self-interestedness that no longer requires a catchphrase because it is now so taken for granted.  It particularly applied to the well-known phenomenon of the trade union member being promoted to management level and suddenly abandoning his working-class loyalties.  As another popular phrase had it:  ""The working class can kiss my ***, I've got the foreman's job at last.""

This movie is a sequel to ""Privates Progress"", which is also worth seeing, but each movie is standalone.  Comedy has a way of getting beneath the skin more effectively than drama.  These two movies will tell you more about wartime and post-war British society than any documentary could do.  And with plenty of laughs along the way.",1111622400,23,1474,5.020576131687243
1803485,3,B00007AJE5,"Though I am a huge fan of Peter Sellers and he does a creditable job here as Mr. Kite, the union organizer, this film did not really grab me.  It was funny in parts but my feeling is that the satire here is the product of it's time or that this film is veddy British and one would have to be an Anglophile of the first order to appreciate it.  That said, I would recommend this film to Peter Sellers fans if they want a broader overview of his entire film career.",1094515200,2,463,4.021739130434782
1803486,5,B00007AJE5,"...I'm the only one who noticed that, besides the satire about managements, unions, and their relations, there is also one, although briefer nonetheless most interesting, about 'Justice', who decides that if one is guilty of honesty, it can only happen by reason of insanity, and, therefore must be committed. Leaving management going on with their cheating schemes, workers thinking that getting their paycheck is working hard enough, and unions' leaders going on encouraging sabotage, following USSR directions, absolutely blind to the fact that, if doing one tenth of the same stuff in USSR, they would have been -at best- sent to the siberian salt mines used as reeducation camps.",1093305600,6,684,5.284403669724771
1803487,5,B00007AJE5,"I have already reviewed a couple of fine 50s comedies--one British ( The Man in the White Suit ) and one American ( The Solid Gold Cadillac )--where I felt that the film's theme or message was just as relevant today. You can certainly add the Boulting Brothers' brilliant comedy, ""I'm All Right Jack "", to this list. Are industrial relations any less problematic today, especially if owners are greedy, managers elitist and incompetent, and unionized employees unreasonable ? It is a rhetorical question !
In producing ""I'm All Right Jack"", the Boultings obviously took great pains to be objective--both sides, management and labour, are only interested in themselves, with a mutual lack of respect and trust. I seem to recall that, when the film was first released in Britain, the union movement loved the way that ownership/management was portrayed, but objected very much to how the British worker was represented--of course, ""upper class"" owners had a reverse viewpoint.
While this terrific satire has a strong message, it is also a very entertaining film, with a perfect cast. As stubborn, dogmatic Fred Kite, the union leader, Peter Sellers is marvellous, but it is a mistake to call this a Peter Sellers' movie. Actually, Ian Carmichael gets top billing as Stanley Windrush, the ultimate ""upper class twit""--not the only time that he would play this kind of role ( remember ""School for Scoundrels""? ). Carmichael is wonderful as the well-meaning, but very naive young man, who causes all the ""trouble"". Terry-Thomas is the Personnel Director--obsequious to the owners, disdainful of the workers--oozing insincere charm all over the place. Ownership is represented by Dennis Price ( smug, patrician and totally crooked ) and Richard Attenborough ( a slimy, oily weasel--and--you guessed it--totally crooked ! ). John Le Mesurier registers as the ""efficiency expert"", spying on the workers. Irene Handl is a scene-stealer as Kite's wife, exasperated with her husband's union-spouting nonsense, wondering if he ever does any real work. Blonde and bosomy Liz Fraser is Kite's daughter, grabbing on to Windrush as her ticket away from a boring life and preening in front of the cameras. Ms. Fraser's performance is another gem. Character actors like Victor Maddern, Sam Kydd, Cardew Robinson and David Lodge pop up here and there to enliven things even more. Finally, let us not forget Margaret Rutherford--she only has a few scenes--but when Ms. Rutherford is on the screen, she owns it.
""I'm All Right Jack"" remains a highly-respected landmark film in the history of British cinema--with a superb script and cast, this DVD belongs in the collection of anyone who likes to think and laugh at the same time.
As usual, Anchor Bay gives us a good quality picture--black and white, of course. There is also a trailer and a bio of Peter Sellers( again, while he is terrific, I do not consider this to be just a Sellers vehicle ).
Thanks, Anchor Bay--hey--how about a ""Terry-Thomas Collection "" ? You could start with ""Make Mine Mink"" !",1070928000,27,3033,5.055888223552894

His characterizations in this film are unforgettable, as are those of the rest of the cast.  Having worked in industry myself for a number of years, including some union environments, I find this satire on target with the sad realities of the workplace, even today.

7974529,5,B00007AJE5,"""I'm All Right Jack,"" (1959), is surely one of the most brilliant, classic, black and white British comedies to be released during those golden years of the 1950s and 60's.  The humor is dark; the wit is rapier-sharp; the spoofs are right on target, the cast and acting are topnotch, and, at a tight 105 minutes, it sure moves fast for a Britcom of the time.  This sly satire was penned by Alan Hackney, who wrote the novel, and Frank Harvey who wrote the screenplay.  It was directed by John Boulting, and was, once again, not an Ealing picture.

Recent, naive Oxford graduate and old-money aristocrat Stanley Windrush (Ian Carmichael,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heavens-Above/dp/B00007AJE7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heavens Above!</a>), has survived World War II, and now thinks he would like to carve out a career in industry.  But he's one of the great upper class twits of all time, and no industry seems to want him.  So, much to his dismay, he takes a menial job in his profit-minded uncle's weapons factory, but cautiously keeps his background a secret. Soon enough, Stanley's incompetence provokes suspicion and sympathy as he, unknowingly following the agenda of his crooked elders, becomes a pawn in a battle between management and an aggressive, bullying Marxist shop steward (Peter Sellers,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Strangelove-Or-How-I-Learned-to-Stop-Worrying-and-Love-the-Bomb-Special-Edition/dp/B000055Y0X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Strangelove, Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Special Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Return-of-the-Pink-Panther/dp/B0009IW8OE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Return of the Pink Panther</a>). Until Stanley unwittingly causes a massive strike, and what will become of him then?

The cast is a who's who of British comic talent at the time.  Terry-Thomas (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Naked-Truth/dp/B0007XBKPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Naked Truth</a>) plays Major Hitchcock.  Sellers plays both Fred Kite, shop steward and lower-class striver; and Sir John Kennaway, industrial bigwig. Richard Attenborough (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miracle-on-34th-Street/dp/B00004TS0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miracle on 34th Street</a>) plays the crooked through-and-through Sidney De Vere Cox. Dennis Price, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kind-Hearts-and-Coronets-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000CS45S8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kind Hearts and Coronets - (The Criterion Collection)</a>),  sadly, in his last major part, he'd made such a wreck of his life, plays  Bertram Tracepurcel, Stanley's uncle, owner of the factory.  The inestimable Margaret Rutherford (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Agatha-Christie-Miss-Marple-Movie-Collection-Murder-at-the-Gallop-Murder-Ahoy-Murder-Most-Foul-Murder-She-Said/dp/B000CRR374/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Agatha Christie Miss Marple Movie Collection (Murder at the Gallop / Murder Ahoy / Murder Most Foul / Murder She Said)</a>), plays Stanley's Aunt Dolly; the indomitable Irene Handl( HEAVENS ABOVE!)  is on hand as Mrs. Kite.  Liz Fraser (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-Way-Stretch/dp/B00007AJEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two-Way Stretch</a>) plays Cynthia Kite as if the part were written for her, and perhaps it was. The irreplaceable Miles Malleson (KIND HEARTS) plays Stanley Windrush Sr.  And we've got, in smaller parts, John Le Mesurier as Waters; Raymond Huntley, as the Magistrate; and Malcolm Muggeridge as himself.

The movie was made by Charter Film Productions, and was filmed at Shepperton Studios. Well, there can be no doubt that the film is an equal opportunity insult fest, although, most of the time, the televised versions cut the racist language, used by both labor and management, in the original. But there's not an ounce of sentimentality in its hard, hard heart.  Mind you, on a recent re-viewing it did seem particularly anti-union (and I was born a union maid).  Never mind, as the plot progresses, things get more and more farcical, and, by its end, almost everyone, save poor bumbling Stanley, proves to be on the take.  Finally, I was also interested to note, in that recent re-viewing, just how powerful the three major women players are, for a male-oriented film: they wield a lot of influence.  Has nobody ever noticed? At any rate, Sellers was one of the greatest of 20th century comedians, and Fred Kite is one of his greatest, most unforgettable performances. Not to be missed.",1298073600,2,4791,6.848684210526316

Sellers got much acclaim for this, his first film role, and is indeed very fine in it, though not as outright hilarious as in Heavens Above or Strangelove. He's also in less than half the film, and in a supporting role. As good as Sellers is here, for me the best thing in IARJ, apart from the script, is Terry-Thomas.

TT reprises his role of Major Hitchcock from the 1956 film Private's Progress, the predecessor to IARJ in many ways, and from the same Boulting Brothers. Carmichael and Price were also in it, and this film is the continuing story of the three, now in a labor milieu instead of the military. Thomas for me epitomizes a certain aspect of British aristocracy: the glory of the Raj and all that rot, and all those stiff-upper-lip rotters. He always seems to grasp the good and bad in all his characters, and here he does it to a TT (sorray!). As good as Sellers is, his laid-back portrayals of his two characters here are funny and precise but rarely made me laugh out loud. TT on the other hand cracked me up again and again.

But everyone here is good, and the best thing about the film is its refusal to take sides, instead showing both labor and management as bounders, cads, and generally greedy nincompoops. Pretty much dead-on satire, in other words. The ending is also more realistic than expected; the dry cynicism on display here is still beyond the reach of Hollywood today, apparently.

Carmichael holds it all together nicely, and if you like British humor at all then this will be a major treat. But first let's take a break, wot.",1267660800,3,1571,4.52112676056338
7974531,5,B00007AJE5,"This formula Boulting Bros. satire is broad and wide swiping. No section of 1950s British society is protected from its sting. It was a very apt piece of satire, and I am very happy to say, works as well today as it did on its release. It is actually quite nostalgic to watch now, because many of the elements lampooned here are now distant memories, bad or good. The film is rich in detail and the screenplay is very well crafted, but what I like about it most is that it captures the essence of British culture at the time, the general industrial scene and the attitudes and reputations of the British worker generally, and those of the British corporate employer. It is very much 'them and us' and portrays the role of the then mighty union as the tool of the devil that damages the reputation of Great Britain itself. But it also shows the corporate employers as priveliged, detached fat cat schemers whose main aim in life is to make a lot of money without getting their hands dirty, and couldn't give a stuff about the riff raff they are forced to employ, hence the catchphrase title 'I'm Alright Jack'. It is wonderfully catty stuff that ensues between the two classes, when a couple of greedy executives conspire to use the work force's militancy to aid a crooked deal of theirs.

Sellers gives a masterclass in caricature as he plays the died in the wool 'old labour' union shop steward to a tee. His pretentions of intellectualism are hilariously accurate about that very real type of character in British society of the day. Equally as funny are his rather fastidious habits and his priggishness and sense of values. His burning sense of pride has made him as much of a snob as the chinless plutocrats who are by definition his sworn enemies. It is a magnificent and thoroughly entertaining performance within a clever and entertaining film. Highly recommended to Brit com lovers and Sellers fans alike.",1211760000,3,1914,4.662721893491124

With Ian Carmichael, Terry-Thomas, Peter Sellers - and seldom listed (very young) David Attenborough) -- ""We do not and cannot accept the principle that incompetence justifies dismissal.

 Watch Carmichael's Windrush go naively (like Alice) down the rabbit hole of industry; watch a very young Peter Sellers (before he started reading his own reviews) in his award winning role of the shop steward.

Ian Carmichael---the bungling, guileless laddie of a man who everyone wants to help and whose misadventures drive the story.
Dennis Price-- the too clever by half manipulative owner
Richard Attenborough---the cynical former classmate, looking after his ""friend"" Carmichael.
