3847038,5,B0024NSFZI,"I am more of The Little Mermaid fan, but watching Part one of Tinkerbell made me become a fan of the movie. I knew I expected Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure would be to be the same experience as part one. But guess what, I was amazed! Part 2 was WAY Better, I actually jumped at some time of excitement and other giddy feeling from the movie. One scene would be when she is creating something and it broked!!! That is all i can say you know what i am talking about when you see it!",1256169600,,484,4.0
3847039,5,B0024NSFZI,"I had extremely low expectations for the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tinker-Bell-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B000YENUQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tinker Bell (BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>] but was very pleasantly surprised. Still, I wasn't quite sure that this particular ""franchise"" needed a sequel. So, with trepidation I put this Blu-ray into my player. ""Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure"" actually blows away its predecessor. Sure, the story is a tad predictable, but with fantastic new characters (including Blaze the firefly, and the two Trolls at the Troll Gate), returning favorites (Garden fairy Rosetta whose bubbly personality is pure Dolly Parton), and top-notch animation, this movie will be a joy to watch for all ages.

The story: Tinker Bell is entrusted with the creation of the scepter for the Autumn Revelry. Her friend Terence offers to help, but his micro-managing of Tink sets her off, and in her anger, she accidentally breaks the precious and rare moonstone, threatening the life of everyone in Pixie Hollow. Lashing out at Terence, the friendship between these two fairies is jeopardized, and Tink must find a way to fix the moonstone...and the friendship. The rest you'll have to watch on your own; this synopsis is greatly simplified, but I do not want to give away any spoilers.

On Tink's journey to repair the moonstone, she is joined by Blaze, a firefly. He is absolutely adorable, and given plenty of spunk and character by the Disney animation team. The animation team deserves a plethora of kudos; on Blu-ray this movie will take your breath away; especially the scene in the Fairy Tale Theater. The lighting effects are amazing; absolutely beautiful. All throughout the movie there are many visual touches that will show that the people behind this movie took special care to elevate this many notches above the usual straight-to-video movie. Hidden Mickeys, Skull Rock, and plenty of other details that bear repeated viewings. The Celtic-style music is back, but I feel it is blended much better into the movie than it was in the original film. I really can't say enough good things about this movie.

SPECS:
Video: 1080p High Def (1.78:1) * Audio: English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit), French & Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital; subtitles: English SDH, French & Spanish. While the audio is crystal clear and pleasing to listen to, there are really no dynamic uses of the surround that seemed memorable to me.

EXTRAS:

Backstage Disney

Tinker Bell Comes to Disney World (8:20): Both Disneyland in Anaheim & Disney World in Orlando have Pixie Hollow areas, but this featurette focues on the Orlando version which has beautiful topiaries and 3-dimensional recreations of objects from this movie. With careful attention to colors and characterization from the movie, garden designer Carla Schuman and team discuss how it all came together.

Deleted Scenes (16:00): Includes intros by Director Klay Hall and Producer Sean Lurie

Alternate Scenes (4:00): These are pretty much manufactured bloopers that are fun to watch, including gaffes, some bodily function jokes, as well as a few other mildly funny/amusing bits.

Bonus Short (4:46): This is a magical guide to the Autumn area of Pixie Hollow, led by Terence & Tinker Bell. Pleasant to watch, it does appear to be more of an advertisement for Disney Books than a true short. Even the animation style is a little static and looks more like a 2-dimensional book illustration with simple movement than an animated film.

""The Gift of a Friend"" music video, performed by Disney Channel's Demi Lovato

Previews include Dumbo (70th Anniversary Edition on Bluray in Spring 2010), The Princess & The Frog, Tinker Bell & The Great Fairy Rescue (the next installment!), Blu-ray/High Def Disney movies, Santa Buddies-The Legend of Santa Paws (with Christopher Lloyd), Ponyo, G-Force, Beauty & The Beast (Diamond Edition in High Def), and Disney on Ice-Worlds of Fantasy (including Tinker Bell & Friends)

FINAL WORDS: You'd have to be extremely curmudgeonly not to enjoy this film and appreciate the high quality of animation and characterization!",1255910400,21,4166,5.314589665653496

3847043,5,B0024NSFZI,"I went to whatch the movie last week... as I said before about the first one, I can tell you too that this one is so great. I love it. The second Tinkerbell movie is so great, full of color, and a lot of friendship. This movie is recomended to all family, kids will love it and It has not things that people feel uncorfontable. The second Tinkerbell movie is about herself and how she deals with frienship. It is so magical because you can see how fairies work in order to produce pixie dust, specialy the blue one that is too hard to get it. Thinker has a very importat mission in this movie, and for that reason she has a lot of work to do before a special event. His best friend that you all ready know, is really a very good friend who stands with her all the time that she needs him. Songs are ok, video is full of color and a lot of new scenes of the neverland island. No humans in this one, but some sort of pirates story. Two best friends trols and a little cute bug are new in the movie. The rest of the fairies like Vidia has not an important role in this movie, however you can see them work very hard too. Silver has an importat job with the baby frogs, rosetta has a new autom dress, vidia has a lot of work with the fall, and everything in this movie is gold and red color because is during the fall that happen the most important part. Thinker and his best friend learn to work together and to forgive if there is something wrong. What I can say is that the movie makes me feel so good because you can learn that no matter what happen with your relationships, you can put your proud into a box and give the first step in order to ask for help. The blu-ray release is coming soon, but for some reason here in Mexico is in theathers, so if you have come, do not forget to whatch it, you won't disapoint it.  Oh, I almost forgot that you can see new Thinker's inventions that help her to travel to secret places never be seen before.",1253145600,7,1945,4.078328981723238

It would be harder then diamond. Nope, it ends up getting smashed into pieces. nature, you have failed & doomed yourself. Idiot!
Stupid nature. You're stupid
So she has to go find this item that grants wishes. And its not captain hook sadly. It only has one wish left, not 3 due to a new user.
Ends up wasting both cause shes a idiot.
Fails to make her wish, has to fix the crystal somehow, were told it gets more power if the crystal is exposed more. Dumbest logic ever cause its still broken at the end of the movie. Missing shards. It would make more sense if it were at its strongest if it was full & not broken. And these fairys are into doing drugs.

The only thing to note; there are rats in one of the last scenes that continue to scare my daughter (3 years old).  Just a heads up for parents of little ones.,1405382400,,339,4.136363636363637

Must have for young girls...no romantic plots or evil bad guys.",1403481600,,343,4.683333333333334
3847325,4,B0024NSFZI,I was skeptical of straight to DVD movies from Disney but this series is outstanding.  My daughter loves the characters and we watch this one over and over. Good content that even I as a male adult enjoy also.  Looking forward to more magical stories to come that my daughter and I can enjoy together,1403308800,,300,4.4363636363636365

3847327,5,B0024NSFZI,"Finally got a chance to watch this one in the series.  It has a nice simple message about humility, forgiveness and friendship.  And on a more subtle note... on how you need to control your temper.  The animation matches the others in the series and the story fits in with the characters already introduced.  It isn't our favorite of the Tinkerbell movies, but it is enjoyable and worth owning if you are a Disney Fairies fan.",1402272000,,426,4.565789473684211

Also, not the only DVD, where I have had to do the same thing...On the other hand, Good Movie, entertaining, great for my daughter, wonderful story for children in general...",1391990400,,556,4.683673469387755
3847346,5,B0024NSFZI,"I bought the movie for my 4-year old daughter, and she really enjoyed it. I like the story for several reasons:

1. There's no 'bad guy'
2. The story shows how Tinkerbell's weakness (quick to anger) leads to all the trouble in the movie.
3. There is no deus machina to make everything right. It takes ingenuity on the part of Tinkerbell.
4. The theme is friendship and the importance of friends. It's a simple and easy to learn lesson for kids.

I thought it was very clever of the producers to show Tinkerbell as a complete character, making mistakes, and getting out of jams which strangely reminded me of Indiana Jones, the way things didn't always go as planned.

This one gets an enthusiastic thumbs up!",1391817600,,708,4.559055118110236

She lives out of town but my daughter says she watches them all the time and they are working just fine.,1387843200,,263,4.117647058823529
3847355,5,B0024NSFZI,"My kids love this show. We rented it, and HAD to buy it because of the moral.
I'm sure other movies have focused on this same moral, but I can't think of any I've personally seen.

*Spoiler Alert*

So basically Tinkerbell gets asked to build something, she messes up, and she blames everyone but herself.
She sets of on an adventure to fix her mistake, she messes up, and she blames everyone but herself.
Eventually she finds the treasure (a mirror) that can grant her wish to let her fix everything, she messed up the wish, and starts blaming her firefly friend.
As she is blaming the firefly, she is still holding the mirror, and telling the firefly ""it's all your fault,"" she glimpses her reflection as though it was telling herself ""it's all your fault"" and she realizes that she's been blaming others for her problems when she was the one making mistakes.  She also realizes how this has hurt other's feelings.

This was imperative for our daughter, who has a propensity to blame her younger brother when things go wrong.
It was done in a way that she empathized with and could understand (she's 5).
It actually did an amazing job teaching her, and she has mostly stopped blaming him for things.",1387324800,,1200,4.593457943925234

I have never had a problem with streaming videos before but this one kept freezing in the same spot.  I had to turn off my wii (which I did a couple of times in the hopes that the movie would correct itself - and that's the extent of my technical abilitiy anyway) only for it to freeze again in the exact same spot.  Finally, I fast forwarded past that part so that we could continue watching the movie.  Later it skipped a portion of the movie, but because of the earlier debacle I was unwilling to try to rewind it back.  I don't know if the copy is bad or what.  I've never before had a problem streaming things through the wii from amazon.

As for the movie itself, it's hard for me to really review it because what I most remember is the aggravation of it not playing the way I wanted.",1369872000,,917,4.117977528089888

It's tough to review a movie meant for children but I think this movie is pretty good.  It is a little more ""violent/scary"" than other Tinkerbell movies, but the violence is relative.  It's Tinkerbell scary, not Michael Myers scary.  I am not even sure than you can describe it as violence. It's more like hostility.  I think this movie is good for a child that is on the cusp of understanding how to express feeling of anger as Tinkerbell deals with her own anger management issues in this movie.  Perfect for 4 years up, but if you are purchasing for a 2-3 year old, go with Tinkerbell-Great Fairy Rescue.",1350432000,,725,4.4961832061068705

They all watch the movie and act the roles.  They all enjoy the movie and have a great time. As of my opinion, the movie is very well done, the story is interesting and action packed. Great colors and drawings.  What I love most of Tink is that she is not the perfect princess, all well manered, always proper and all,(she is not even a princess).  Her stories have always a life lesson: morals, friendship, responsability, hard work, love what you do and what you are, among others.

Though it was cute and mildly enjoyable, it was not too memorable (though the vocals of Loreena McKennit did not go unnoticed).

When the second movie came out, I wanted to give the straight-to-dvd-franchise one more shot. And let me tell you, I'm glad I did. Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure is leaps and bounds better than the first one. The dialogue is witty, the pacing is fantastic, the music is to die for, and now that the characters have already been established there is more room for plot and characterization. I watched this for the first time with my own mother and even she enjoyed it! Now that's saying something, since she stopped being impressed with little girly movies when I stopped being a little girl myself.

Fans of Disney, of fairies, and of Tinker Bell herself, I strongly reccomend you give this film a try, even if the first one didn't quite tickle your fancy.",1333843200,,1129,4.529411764705882

3847450,5,B0024NSFZI,"I caught this movie on my Tivo in Nov. 2011 and my 2yr old daughter loves watching it so much that I got her the Bluray/DVD combo for Xmas.  Compared to all the other movies that she likes to watch the Tinker Bell movies are much more enjoyable for parents to watch along with her.  It doesn't have any hidden jokes for adults like some other movies but it's also not so overly cutesy and annoying as other kid movies either.  Also if you're paying attention the later installments of the Disney Fairy series you'll see things carried forward from previous movies.

As a dad with a science and engineering background I appreciate the fact that Tinker Bell is a Tinker Fairy which means she builds and fixes stuff.  She's not a Disney Princess that is simply looking for a rich prince to marry.  That makes her a pretty good role model for a little girl (other than the fact that she's a fairy and not a human).  Also Tink isn't a perfect character.  By that I mean she makes mistakes and learns from them rather than doing everything perfectly all the time.  Her tinkering doesn't always go as planned and she tends to get mad when things go awry which only make things worse.  Eventually she learns to control her temper and fix her mistakes which is a good lesson for kids.  She also has to learn to ask for help from time to time which is another valuable lesson.

The Bluray and DVD are great as expected and the animation is top notch as you'd expect from Disney CG.  I use the Bluray in my PS3 on my big screen TV and the DVD in our portable player in the car when needed.

The quality of these straight to DVD movies is exceptional, especially on Blu-Ray.

Unlike the first two movies, this one had some scary parts to it and that was my daughter's undoing. We have enjoyed the Tinker Bell movies because of the lack of ""scary"" in them, and although the scary didn't last long, and even evolved into some goofiness, she was slow to catch that fact and came and got me to sit with her.

This just didn't have the fairy dreaminess that we have grown to love in Tinker Bell. While I enjoyed the movie my sensitive daughter did not. With age, she probably will, but for now, this one will be shelved.

I still give it a 4 star rating due to the quality of the story line and animation, but have to leave one star off, simply because it does not follow the completely innocent format of it's predecessors. Other younger children who have enjoyed the first two movies may have a similar reaction, as they will be totally unprepared for anything scary, given the lack of that in other Tinker Bell videos and parents just may want to have a head's up about that when purchasing this particular DVD.",1319241600,,1574,5.665254237288136

The music is better and the story is great. My only complaints were the fact that they added this whole pixie dust factory scenario obviously to make it difficult for Tink to get fairy dust (couldn't she just sneak by the tree?) and this rang a little false. Second, the scenes between Tink and Terrence building the sceptre begin to drag and this appeared to short change much needed additional time that was lacking during Tink's time on the pirate island. Also, the rest of the fairy group gets short changed as well, but that was understandable given the plot. I still would have like to see more time of Tink on the island (which felt a bit rushed). Still, a fun film overall for girls who love Tink, but not as tight a film as the original.",1304812800,,913,4.408284023668639

3847462,4,B0024NSFZI,"Only a year after 2008's Tinker Bell DVD release, the little fairy was back in sequel called The Lost Treasure.  While it was slated for direct-to-DVD release, it actually earned a short (one week) theatrical run so as to be Oscar nomination eligibility.

All of the case of the original film reprise their roles with a few new characters being introduced here along the way.  The story takes place in the mystical Pixie Hollow (within Neverland) once more but this time our title is asked by Queen Clarion (with a little coaxing from the ever-lovable Fairy Mary) to construct a scepter that will hold a precious moonstone for the fairies' Fall Festival.

This moonstone apparently captures the rays of a blue Harvest moon (an event that comes along every eight years) and is a crucial process in replenishing the clan's supply of Pixie Dust.

At the risk of giving away critical plot spoilers, allow me to simply reveal that there is but one such moonstone in existence and Tinker Bell has a bit of a well-deserved reputation for destruction.  A quest of epic proportion ensues but not before Tink and close buddy/ love interest Terence have a falling out.

Surprisingly, said quest actually manages to mimic in some capacity the cornerstones of successful fantasy adventures not unlike those expected in say The Hobbit.  Whereas the first film was essentially an exercise in driving home the point that we should be happy with who we are/ our lot in life, the second is more successful at portraying a scope of adventure with a little moral message stuffed in for good measure.

Tink earns a new sidekick this time around with some visual homage to Pixar's Flick of A Bug's Life fame.  A good  of the film actually takes place outside of Pixie Hollow this time around and rather then dragging the viewer back to the mainland (London), we are treated to a pretty nice look at some of the wilds beyond the pixie's island.  Expanses of wild ocean, unexplored wilderness, toll collecting trolls and even Peter Pan-esque pirate ships make the grade in The Lost Treasure.

Harkening upon classic Disney animation methods, the crew responsible for this one paid special attention to the cues that the younger audiences tend to identify with in this type of film: Increased musical numbers, emphasis on facial caricature, magical mirrors and a bit more of a fairy tale setting (no pun intended).

The pacing, once again, however is a tad askew when compared to the butter-smooth modern CG practices we've been spoiled with from the likes of Pixar and DreamWorks and instead more closely resembles what I typically associate with the grander dilemma-driven plots of classic Disney animation.

On the visual front, Disney manages to deliver another gorgeous, high-quality transfer just bursting with rich, autumn-swept colors and crisp clarity. Tumbling leaves and specs of sparkling fairy dust are flawlessly rendered here, and the textures are equally solid throughout. While the animation itself falls a tad bit short compared to more feature-film style of the first film, viewers of all ages will definitely come away with very little to criticize when it comes to the technical efforts of Disney (who have absorbed the talent of Pixar).

Scoring is provided by Celtic Woman's Lisa Kelly who performs the opening If You Believe; narrator Grey DeLisle is joined by Julie Garnye in ""Fairy Tale Theatre"" in which Tinker Bell learns of the existence of the wishing mirror; and Disney regular Demi Lovato performs ""The Gift of a Friend,"" the video of which can be seen in the bonus features of the disc (along with other goodies such as the interactive ""Magical Guide to Pixie Hollow"" and some specially made ""Outtakes and Bloopers"").

In all the first Tinker Bell film was decent, if slightly silly and a bit narrow in its scope.  This, the second entry, actually manages to improve upon the formula and does so in record development time (modern computer generated films commonly require four to five years of development time; this one was released in under a year of completion of the original work).  Like the first one, it isn't for everyone as clearly the target demographic is the younger set, it does offer up a nice blend of solid visuals and an adventure-driven plot structure.  Should the same degree of improvement be found in the third and most recent entry to the trilogy, Disney may well have done the impossible in creating a whole new classic series that does not rely upon princesses or big-eared mice.",1297382400,,4512,4.90407358738502

The other fairies only have cameos, while Vidia (her favorite) doesn't have a single line.  There's lots of frustration, crankiness and downright anger from Tink, which she works through and eventually feels remorse for, but my daughter doesn't really get that Tink is under undue pressure to save the ENTIRE Hollow.

3847483,4,B0024NSFZI,"TinkerBell and the Lost Treasure is definitely a Disney movie, but sadly is more for the younger set and doesn't offer much in the way of entertainment for adults.  Of course, there's a lot of entertainment gained by watching your youngsters have fun and not have to worry about keeping up with plot twists or rapid-fire dialogue.

The plot centers around TinkerBell's task to create a new scepter using a special gem, which sounds more fun than it actually turns out to be.  Once the action gets underway, the film improves a lot, but there's a lot of set-up that has to be gone through first.

Her firefly companion shines (yep, that was a joke) in his role.  I loved the part where Tink wraps his fanny up so that he serves more or less as a flashlight.

While the story remains in Pixie Hollow, there's plenty to see and a lot of characters get introduced, but they're not really that important to the overall story.  The artwork (computer generated) is amazing and looks bright and vibrant.  Kids will love seeing the pixies interacting with all the animals and the explosions of fairy dust and action.

As always, there's a lot of music in this movie.  The opening song is exciting and energetic.  The sound allowed on the DVD is fantastic and will roll through surround sound systems.

Kids will also enjoy all the various mechanical contrivances of the fairy world.  I especially enjoyed the quitting bell where the bug gets tossed into the flower.  There are a lot of sight gags that will keep kids amused before the main action keeps into play.

With the invention of the Pixie Dust Express, TinkerBell proves that her name is well-earned, though none of her mechanical skills were brought out in any of the Peter Pan films I saw or books that I read.

However, with the fun storytelling, the animals, the magic powers, and the semi-scary villains, this is the perfect DVD for a family night with little kids.  Ages 4 to 8 will probably be best entertained.",1271548800,,1967,4.622478386167147
3847484,5,B0024NSFZI,"The whole time I was watching this movie, I was practically glued to the TV. From start to finish, it was wonderful. I think it's even better than the first one, Tinker Bell.

Tinker Bell really just reminds me so much of myself. She is stubborn, impatient and, like Fairy Mary said, a hothead. But she is also brilliant and brave as well. My personal favorite part of the movie was she apologized to Terence, realzing she was wrong (although I have to admit I think Terence WAS being a little overly helpful).

I also like that there was no romance in this film. I know there was none in the first either, but in just about every movie I've seen, when a boy and a girl are friends at the beginning, it turns into a romance at the end. I think that's a very positive message: Boys and girls CAN be just friends.

I also think this movie has a stronger message than the first. True friendship really is a treasure. The real treasures in life (friends, family) are always taken for granted...until they're gone and we realize how much we miss (and need) them.",1270339200,2,1057,4.38265306122449

The quest has her at first traveling with a firefly named Blaze but it is not until later, after the arrival of her close friend Terence, that she is finally able succeed at her difficult task. The need for taking personal responsibility, for friendship in adversity and for simple kindness even when we are in distress ourselves, are all lessons that can be gleaned from this animated feature. This Blue-Ray edition features stunning graphics in high-definition that are beautiful to look at. There are some interesting extras as well.

3847486,4,B0024NSFZI,"Returning to Pixie Hollow, Walt-Disney brings forth the next chapter in the ""fairy tales"" about Tinker Bell and her friends in TINKERBELL AND THE LOST TREASURE.  The Autumn Revelry is approaching and this year's festival will be particularly special as it will occur during a blue harvest moon.  When such a moon appears, the fairies use a precious moonstone to restore the Pixie Dust Tree.  A special scepter for the celebration is created in which is placed the moonstone.  The moonstone is an incredible rare object and without it the fairies will not be able to restore the Pixie Dust Tree which will ultimately mean there will be no more fairy dust. Tinker Bell is chosen to create the scepter, but during an unintentional accident she destroys the moonstone.  Tinker Bell's only hope is to journey on a quest across the sea to find a mythical mirror that has one wish to grant to whoever can find it.

I have to admit, I was surprised by TINKERBELL AND THE LOST TREASURE.  TINKERBELL was pretty good, but I thought the stories following it wouldn't be as well written or the characters as well developed.  That's what usually happens in sequels like this--they are just made to cash in.  But that's not really the case here.  There are parts of the movie that are predictable and the movie is clearly aimed at 5-12 year-old girls.  Still, there are moments of surprise and things don't exactly turn out as one expects.  The animation is a fantastic feast of vivid colors.  Objects appear real, but not too real. It's just the right mix.

I enjoyed TINKERBELL AND THE LOST TRESURE. It was good enough to make me wonder if the next project in the series, TINKERBELL AND THE GREAT FAIRY RESCUE (to be released Fall 2010) will be able to continue what seems to be a nice series of animated movies.  Recommended for fans of Tinkerbell, younger children, and anyone who likes all things Disney.

The special features on the DVD include a music video performed by Demi Lavato, scenes that were deleted from the movie with introduction by the director and producer, ""bloopers"", a featurette about the new Pixie Hollow Garden at Walt Disney World, and the Magical Guide to Pixie Hollow tour where Terence and Tinkerbell guide a tour through the Autumn Area of Pixie Hollow.  I enjoyed the deleted scenes and the bloopers the most.  The introduction at the beginning of the deleted scenes really provide key insight into the filmmaking process.  The bloopers are a lot of fun because this is an animated picture so there really aren't any real bloopers; they are clips of scenes where things go wrong but the fairies are actually actors pretending to be fairies.",1269216000,2,2658,4.739130434782608

I wasn't exactly enthusiastic about spending a few hours watching a Tinker Bell cartoon, but what choice did I have...?
Well, I'm not too big to admit when I was wrong......TINKER BELL AND THE LOST TREASURE is a wonderfully fun movie, and we ALL enjoyed it. The story and characters are endearing, the animation is beautiful, and looks especially good on the Blu-Ray, and the extras gave my Daughter a lot more to watch once the film was over.

We enter this club by accepting free copies of products but we promise in return to submit an opinion.

To see one of our favorite movies come up as a choice was simply an opportunity we could not bypass and it is with great anticipation that we finally saw Tinkerbelle and the Lost Treasure, an adventure where Pixie Hollow prepares for Autumn while Tinkerbelle gets called by Queen Clarion.

Tinkerbelle has been given the task of creating a scepter that will capture energy from the moon to produce and replenish her ""pixie"" dust. Without giving the plot away, this Disney DVD will enchant adult, teenagers and children as you watch Tinkerbelle learn the important lesson of responsibility for her own actions.

Just witnessing the delight the movie produced was joyful enough. The animation is magnificent, the plot fun and entertaining, and the movie will satisfy ""children"" of all ages.

Highly recommend adding this film to your collection. Don't miss it!",1267401600,,1152,4.953367875647668

So did I watch and love this?  I was in and out, doing mom type things (laundry, ironing etc) but he sat happily in front of the TV watching Tink and her buddies learn valuable life lessons about honesty, integrity, and owning up when a mistake has been made.  The message is good, the graphics are sweet and cute, and my son LOVED this movie.  I actually think he's developed a bit of a crush on one of the Fairies.

For the little ones - especially the girls - this is an excellent rainy day family film done in the way that only Disney can do it.  For the parents, it's not something that YOU will pick out, but it is fine to sit through a few hundred times.",1266451200,,914,4.159090909090909

3847497,4,B0024NSFZI,"I had the chance to review this Blu-Ray of Tinker bell and the Lost Treasure and I was pleasantly entertained.  The story begins on the slow side.  I watched this with my 4 y.o. niece and after 20 min. she left the room.  So little kids will find it on the boring side.  I continued watching and without spoiling anything I liked it more than I thought.

Like:
1. Pixar like animation, vivid colors
2. Blu-Ray picture quality (Disney never disappoints with their quality Blu Ray transfers)
3. Soundtrack
4. Tinker-Bell (always lovable)

Dislike:
1. Storyline a bit on slow side at first but catches up
2. Little children might find it boring...not too childish for an adult (though not really my type of movie)",1265932800,,710,4.64

3847503,2,B0024NSFZI,"Well, I've had just about enough of the partisan, babbling praise being afforded this latest Disney animated feature here on Amazon. OK, I get it, the movie is just peachy for your little girls. Oh, the animation is just so . . . so . . . pretty. And look at all the lessons it imparts! Believing in yourself! Working together to solve problems! Being at one with nature!

People, we all know young children are--when they want to be--lying, manipulative sociopaths, capable of the most stunning exploitation of grown, often exasperated adults in order to get their way, or to get some new ... thing. You did it. I did it. Our kids do it. The best we can do is hope that they don't get on our nerves too much, especially in public. But they do. And they will for several years. Don't you just wish you had something you could make reference to when your spawn is standing before you in a crowded department store screeching demands for some new doodad he or she doesn't really need but which he/she clutches in his or her food-encrusted hand? Well, the fine folks at Disney, in partnership with the fine folks in India who actually did most of the work on this project, have delivered a solution. Now you can look the obstinate child square in the face and say in your sweetest, most desperately sincere voice: ""Sweetie, do you remember what Tinkerbell did in the movie you watched last night?"" Naturally, the child will feign ignorance, and then you can pop the big one:

""She admitted she was wrong.""

While in the example above your child would probably continue screeching and sticking his or her peanut-butter-and-chocolate coated fingers all over store property and making people stare at you like a bad parent, this IS the TRUE moral of the story of TINKERBELL AND THE LOST TREASURE: admit when you're wrong, little ones. Many characters admit they were wrong in this movie, either explicitly or implicitly, including the heroine, whose ""feisty"" tomboy temper causes her to flare (and rightly so!) at those who meddle in her projects and otherwise try to make her conform. After they misjudge, lose sight of or otherwise interfere with each other, the characters, including Tink, all come to their senses in the end and, having admitted they were at fault, have a Big Happy Disney Celebration Ending. The characters may seem sincere, but the filmmakers are facetious. This a barely workable moral for ADULTS, who are more likely to have the common sense to admit when they're wrong, but it doesn't work at all for kids, who have virtually no ability to admit guilt unless they're coerced.

There are bigger themes out there, but the Mouse House doesn't seem any more willing to tackle them with these DTV CGI programmers than they were with most of their animated films. At least the ""flat"" Disney animated films of yore and the big-budget CGI productions of Pixar have their undeniable artistry. TINKERBELL, well, it's colourful, I'll give it that. And those characters, they sure are SASSY! Of course, when nearly all of the production work is being OUTSOURCED TO INDIA because Disney no longer sees fit to employ NORTH AMERICAN ARTISTS, it's no surprise journeyman director Klay Hall (who has some decent KING OF THE HILL episodes to his credit) and writer Evan Spiliotopoulos adhere to the kind of bland, generic social engineering found in pre-school television programming for the past 40 years. In Japan, animation industry people must chuckle at the quaintness of films like TINKERBELL, where the same age group that this film targets are catered to with animated programming that challenges and inspires without insipid condescension and ""fit-this-mold"" didacticism.

But back to this outsourcing thing. Nearly all of the production work on TINKERBELL was outsourced to Prana Studios, which has offices in Mumbai, India, and L.A. If you go to their website, you'll find almost no information about what projects they've actually completed, because they don't want you to know and may actually fear bad press about just how many jobs they've taken away from North American and European artists and animators. You can't even view their showreel unless you go through administration or management. I'm willing to bet that Prana is behind a LOT more non-theatrical animated programming available today than just TINKERBELL (if the above-average quality of the animation is any indication), and I have little (but some) doubt that they probably contribute to some theatrical releases already.

So if you're an art or animation student looking to get into the industry in the future, you better have another gig lined up as back-up, or ancestral roots in India or Asia, because you're about to see a lot more ""American"" animated television programs and DTV features--including those starring iconic American-created characters like TINKERBELL--get outsourced to India and elsewhere, leaving fewer and fewer opportunities. Yeah, I know, things are tough all over, but come on, Animation too? How long before it's ALL done overseas?

(By the way, don't bother checking out the IMDB listing for this film to see if there's really as many Indian production people on this film as I'm claiming. The IMDB credits are staggeringly incomplete, probably on purpose. WATCH THE CREDITS ON THE DISCS THEMSELVES. They run over SEVEN MINUTES of the film's 81-minute length and OVER HALF the names are production staff in India.)

Among the utter fluff called extras on this release is a feature devoted to deleted scenes, all of which are little more than animatics or consecutive drawings. Director Hall and producer Sean Lurie introduce these clips in a Pixie Hollow-themed room they claim was set up to help the animators and themselves find inspiration. I call bull on this one, big time. The set is just that, a SET, created specifically for the special features on this Blu-Ray/DVD combo. It's little more than three set walls adorned with exotic but entirely prefab props and a sofa. It's NOT the kind of inspiration room animators would actually find any kind of inspiration in. Such rooms HAVE been shown in the special features of other Disney and Pixar animated productions, and they look nothing like this.

At several points during the special features, director Hall sounds somewhat insincere about the whole production, as though he's not quite happy with the finished product or the production methods used to achieve it. Interesting.

Other special features include:

- a look at the opening of a not-that-impressive Pixie Hollow garden attraction at the Epcot Centre in Disneyworld. It's cute, but the filmmakers and artisans behind the garden try hard to convince us that a lot more planning and engineering went into it than is evident in the finished product.

- A Magical Guide To Pixie Hollow. This is basically a guided tour of Pixie Hollow, done in lo-fi Flash-style animation with voiceovers by the characters. Fairly pointless.

- Music video for ""Gift of a Friend"" by Demi Lovato. Very average song with weak lyrics.

You'll notice the one thing missing from the special features is any serious ""behind the scenes"" look at the animation process, something that often turns up on Blu-Rays and DVDs of most animated American feature films these days, even when those productions are produced with help from overseas (while still employing artisans on North American soil). Of course, to do this for TINKERBELL AND THE LOST TREASURE would require a ""Backstage Disney"" tour of the Prana Studios in Mumbai, something Disney apparently doesn't want you to see. I wonder why?

Well, how about the music, you might ask? The songs and especially the lyrics are subpar, harmless to the ears, granted, but very much in keeping with the kinds of material being pumped out on the company's indistinguishable television shows. And they once again manage to trot out a prefab teen star from one of those cookie cutter shows--in this case Demi Lovato of Sonny With A Chance--to croon the tres-generic theme song in a music video. The ""poetry"" including the verse that opens the picture, is embarrassingly amateur. One of the true highlights of the film is the full orchestral score by Joel McNeely. It's so good that one sincerely hopes that he recorded it in L.A. using local talent (regardless of ethnicity!).

So there you have it, just a little Yang to balance the abundance of upbeat Yin being heaped upon this title by other Amazon Vine users who, like me, got if for free but, unlike me, were too swayed by the short-term reactions of their children to it to be fully objective about its contents and what they mean for the industry at large.

Buy this for your kiddies. It will keep them entertained even as its hoary old lessons go in one ear and out the other. It will look phenomenal on your big screen plasma or LCD television (it sure did on mine, but not enough to blind me to what it represents). It certainly won't bore you, even while offering nothing that will fly over the heads of the target audience.",1264809600,2,9029,4.914041994750656

A great example of this is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleeping-Beauty-Two-Disc-Platinum-Edition-Standard-DVD-and-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B0013ND30W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleeping Beauty (Two-Disc Platinum Edition + Standard DVD and BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>]. It's a nicely illustrated and beautifully produced movie, but the heroine has no personality. All we know about her is that she befriends forest animals and falls in love at age 16.

So, I was pleasantly surprised by the two Tinker Bell movies. Tinker Bell is based on the fairy in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Pan-2-Disc-Platinum-Edition/dp/B000JBWWRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Pan (2-Disc Platinum Edition)</a>, though the Tinker Bell of the movies is not the jealous, playful character from Peter Pan. In the Tinker Bell movies, the fairies all work had to make nature work: they paint flowers and bugs, manipulate the wind, put dew on spider webs, and do all sorts of other silly things. Tinker Bell's job is to be a ""tinker,"" which means that she's an inventory and a mechanic. It's nice to see a heroine who does stuff, and doesn't sit around waiting to marr a prince.  (Ideally, I'd like to see a story less about innate talent, and more about hard work.

Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure is the second movie in the series. There is some stigma to a ""direct to video"" movie, but this isn't actually a bad movie. (With a young child, it's nice to own the disk, avoiding months of explanations about why the movie isn't available.) It's well animated, has good voice work, and has pleasant music. There is enough conflict to be interesting, but it's not a scary movie by any means.

This film did not disappoint. The story was new enough to keep my interest while maintaining the personality of Tinker Bell (her stubborn impatience is familiar to young and old alike). But the magic was evident watching my granddaughter glued to the picture throughout. She's still talking about it. We watched the film on Halloween, just before she dressed in her glittery, light up Tinker Bell costume. Fairy dust indeed!",1259798400,,639,4.756756756756757

However, my daughter loves it and will watch it many times.  The story does teach creative problem solving, which I think is good.  Tink is totally impatient and acts impulsively, but that is part of her character and she has to deal with the consequences of her actions.

I do like the combination DVD and Blu Ray.  We recently took the video to grandma's house and accidentally left the DVD in her player.  Thankfully, we could still play the Blu Ray at our house, so tears were averted.  I could see how we might leave the DVDs at grandma's so that we don't have to cart the discs back and forth and my daughter can watch the same movie in both homes.",1259712000,,790,4.25503355704698
3847533,4,B0024NSFZI,"My little ones(3&6) like the concept of Tinker Bell- cute, small, skit around everywhere they want, magical- a little mischievous.  Kind of fits their own inklings.

The first movie held great promise with it's unique characters and great color and designs.  Somehow after watching it, the kids lost interest. I definitely as parent struggled. It wasn't that it was bad but the story tried hard with only lackluster results.  This one bounces back with the same excellent visuals and a more appealing adventure.  The girls enjoyed it enough to want to watch again.

My review system based on kiddo appeal:
1) They don't want to watch it no matter what
2) They start to watch but walk away or play
3) They watch with some interest but few smiles or laughs
4) Smiles, laughs, would watch again
5) As 4) and asks to see again and again, plays out the characters.

(My only complaint and re: recent Disney in general, they put too much cattiness and meanness/putdowns in their programs to get laughs or tension, especially on the Disney sitcoms.)

3847542,4,B0024NSFZI,"I watched this with my 12 year old daughter. Overall, this is a good purchase, especially for younger kids.

Pros:
- The movie has great graphics and sound. This is not all that unusual these days; the movie was created with all computer graphics. I thought they did a great job with the backgrounds and animation.
- The overall message of the movie was good and shows the right values to children. The film teaches honesty and friendship, and does a good job here.

Cons
- The plot was a bit predictable, but that is not really a deficit with this sort of film; one expect it (and one is not disappointed).
- There is a simply dreadful poem read by the narrator at the beginning of the film. Along with this, I found the words to the music to be very trite and amateurish. I think that Disney should be able to come up with better stuff in this area. This sort of text is supposed to help the movie - but I found it to hinder the film. It was just that bad. I suppose younger kids wouldn't have problems with it, but my 12 year old was grimacing. I realize it is a production for children, but the words and music should be high quality.

Conclusion:
Buy it for your under-ten-year-old. This is not a Disney classic by any means.",1258934400,,1230,4.2703862660944205

3847544,4,B0024NSFZI,"Disney is at it again wooing our young impressionable minds with its tale of enchanment and wonder.
The first Tinkerbell movie hinted at what might be a nice franchise with pixie hollow taking center stage, the storyline was kind of outshined by the HD animation however.  This time Tink is off on her own adventure filled with personal growth and lessons in friendship and family.  The CG animation is excellent overall and the cast is full of standout voice work.  The running time is a bit short, but an engaging tale is told for young and old alike.  My under2 year old daughter was held rapt by the visuals and my 8 year old son had a great time with the humour and action.  Disney has started to put a second DVD disc in with its Blurays and I applaud this as 2 copies are better than one and Digital copies are more of a pain than anything.  If you like The Littles or the Borrowers then you will find this trip with the fairies enjoyable as the is some inventive detail along the way.
Great family entertainment that stays true to the ""DISNEY MAGIC"".",1258588800,,1058,4.4

Without getting into many details, this 80 min movie tells the story of Tinker Bell being in charge of a very important item to the whole community of Pixie Hollow: the moonstone, when it is accidentally shattered, Tinker bell must go on a quest to make things right in time before the sacred ceremony where the moonstone would be used. If you have kids, or if you are familiar with this kind of movies, you know what to expect, the heroin goes in a journey where she will face dangers and meet new friends; I am not saying that in a bad way but the opposite, my kid loved this film, the colors, the music, it has the Disney signature all over it.

The Bluray presentation is well worth the money, presented in an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 and in 1080p, colors come to life, the detail and clarity on the computer graphics look simply beautiful and the effects shine on an HDTV set. While kids may not even care about the HD details, young people familiar with the format and HD enthusiast will not be disappointed with the transfer, Disney, as usual, does not fail to deliver.

Audio options include an English 5.1 DTS-HD Master audio track, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital. Subtitles included are also English, French and Spanish. There isn't much to say about the audio, while presented in HD, this movie does not really have any sequences that takse full advantage of an HD audio track, sound is quite decent and clear, but don't go expecting anything impressive (I know I wasn't)

A nice addition to the release (as with other Disney releases) is the inclusion of a standard DVD copy of the movie, the DVD is enhanced for widescreen TV's and includes subtitles in English, French and Spanish. Audio options are the same as in the BD only that for obvious reason there is no HD track but a 5.1 Dolby Digital instead. This is great as I don't think I'll be watching the BD too often, instead I can have my kid watch as may times as desired in our DVD player .

The bonus  features included (in both the BD and DVD) are:

* A magical guide to Pixie hollow - Tinker Bell and Terence take you explroe Pixie hollow, not really that entertaining and the visuals are different from the ones in the movie, the animation on this feature looks cheaper than the overall film.

* Pixie hollow comes to Walt Disney World - A short documentary of the Tinker bell coming attractions in Disney Parks.

* Scenes you never saw -Nothing more than a collection of bloopers

* All new music video - ""The gift of a friend"" performed by Demi Lovato

* Deleted Scenes

Highly recommended for fans of Disney animated films and fans of the Tinker Bell franchise. Disney delivers another impeccable HD release.",1258502400,2,3068,4.8007590132827325
3847546,4,B0024NSFZI,"When Disney released its first ""fairy"" video,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tinker-Bell-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B000YENUQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tinker Bell (BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>], it was pretty obvious that they were setting the stage for what they most likely hoped would be a new franchise through which movies, merchandise, and other marketing opportunites would spring. It served as a primer for the entire fairy world that the character from Peter Pan now inhabits.

That first video had a decent storyline and was competent from a picture quality and sound quality perspective. It was also effective as a marketing tool, as my daughter was very excited about getting figurines for the fairies featured in the video. Score one for Disney!

If you liked the first movie, you'll probably like Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure more. This installment has a specific storyline, without the burden of establishing a multitude of characters, and the focus remains on Tinker Bell and her challenge of creating a new sceptre for the Autumn Revelry, which is a major celebration of the changing of the seasons and how the Pixie Dust Tree is restored to continue providing Pixie Dust for all the fairies.

A pleasant surprise was the lesson that Tinker Bell learns about friendship, especially under pressure. Her friendship with Terence is strained when she blames him for an accident that happens, even though his only intent was to help his friend with her project. How she handles that situation can be a talking point with your kids, or you can just let it stand on its own to see if the kids pick up on it themselves.

The picture quality was good, with the high definition AVC-encoded video showing no signs of problems of any kind. If anything, the picture is so pristine, the animation is too smooth. While it makes sense that we're not going to see production qualities matching the Pixar movies, I guess it's a good problem to have! While the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 channel sound mix was also not up to the standard of Pixar releases, one has to remember that this is a direct-to-video release and set expectations accordingly. It's too bad, though, since fairies buzzing around and the environments in which Tinker Bell finds herself would have provided plenty of opportunities for an active sound mix.

The extras included in this title are pretty good for a direct-to-video release. Some featurettes provide some depth to the moviewatching experience, including several deleted scenes with introductions by the Director and Producer. I found the deleted scenes to be the most interesting because of the background information that they provided. The fact that all these extras were in HD were a nice surprise, as some bigger-budget titles don't receive the same treatment!

While the package advertises BD-Live functionality, I didn't find the content there all that interesting. Some trailers for upcoming releases in theaters and on home video were available, and they downloaded quickly and had pretty good video quality. However, there wasn't anything in that section that extended the moviewatching experience for this title in a significant way.

One disappointing aspect of this disc is the lack of auto-resume capability. On the Blu-ray format, that capability has to be provided by the software on the disc, but it wasn't included on this one. We watched the movie in two sittings, and we had to manually find where we left off because the disc would not recognize where we stopped watching, and bookmarking was not supported either. Since other Disney releases have this very handy feature (the High School Musical 3 disc asks you if you want to resume the movie or start from the beginning), the Blu-ray programmers at Disney need to be sure to draw from tools that the company has already developed.

Disney has been releasing Blu-ray titles with DVD's included in the package, and this is a wonderful thing! You can watch the high definition disc at home and take the DVD along with you in the car or when traveling where you most likely don't have a Blu-ray player. Every studio should do this, and Disney should be commended for taking the lead in providing their customers with the extra value.

Overall, this is an enjoyable movie for kids and adults, and the additional items (extras, DVD version) included make it a package worth purchasing.",1258502400,,4417,5.123611111111111
3847547,4,B0024NSFZI,"With a wife and two young daughters, selecting this was a no-brainer. I was sure they would enjoy it. The only question was my older daughter (5 years old) is very sensitive to loud sounds and unsettling situations. But she had no problems at all with this, so I would recommend it even for more sensitive (easily scared) viewers. My wife and younger daughter (3 years old) also liked it immensely.

What's surprising is that I actually found it watchable. I usually get bored with predictable plots and am not into fairies or fairy tales. [Off topic: my daughters dressed as fairies for Halloween and won third place in a costume contest. The announcer kept calling them butterflies so my older daughter asked me why. I told her most guys don't know the difference and if I didn't already know I would call them butterflies, too.] But I sat through this movie without fast forwarding and thought it had a decent storyline, had good lessons about friendship and responsibility, and had very good graphics and sound. There were some sections that seemed to drag while other sections seemed rushed, as if to wrap up in under 80 minutes, but overall it was a good length.",1258416000,,1168,4.697560975609756

The PQ and AQ on this Blu-Ray are both 5/5. It was viewed on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 player. As usual, Disney soars with its picture and sound quality, and it is absolutely spectacular in that regard.

While the story was cute, and filled with Disney lessons, such as the importance of friendship & overcoming obstacles, the animation looks a little too artificial for me. The detail of the characters, is, as usual, detailed and remarkably whimsical, which was adorable. Of course animations are meant to overembellish, and make light of certain elements, but unfortunately I felt like I was watching a video game.

Like many 5-star reviewers, we enjoyed the story of Tinker Bell's lesson that friendship is the ""lost"" treasure and the bigger role of Terrance in the movie. It was very funny, maybe a little more than the first Tinker Bell (for us), and it had the same great animation. With the exception of America Ferrera, the Lost Treasure also had the same great voices. If you and the kids enjoyed the first one, I can't see any reason why you wouldn't like the Lost Treasure. Just keep in mind that her friends Silvermist, Rosetta, Fawn, and Iridessa have small parts this time around. The ending was pretty spectacular by the way!",1257984000,,914,4.479041916167665
3847551,5,B0024NSFZI,"Tinker Bell And The Lost Treasure is an absolute treasure of a movie! This Blu Ray version is an unbelievable experience for the visual senses! The artwork and colors, especially of the scenery when Tinker Bell is flying, are simply breathtaking! The impeccable high standards that Disney puts into their best animation films really shows through here.

The story is about Tinker Bell's home in Pixie Hollow, where every autumn, the fairies have The Autumn Revelry, where one fairy is chosen to design a wand to hold the precious moonstone, which is used to restore the Pixie Dust Tree- the source of all the fairies magic.

When Tinker Bell is chosen to have the honor of designing the wand, things don't go as smoothly as she hopes for. Tinker Bell must venture far away on a secret quest to find a magic item to make things go right again. Tinker Bell gets help from her oldest and dearest friend Terence and a new little friend Blaze the firefly. The journey shows Tinker Bell that the greatest treasures in life lie within our hearts and not in a valuable item.

I found new things I never knew about Tinker Bell in this enchanting movie, like she comes from a long line of Tinkerer's, who love to collect things and tinker! The Bonus Features are also great! They include a Magical Guide To Pixie Hollow, Scene's You Never Saw, Deleted Scenes, Pixie Hollow comes To Walt Disney World, Music and More.

The movie's story is absolutely endearing, the artwork is beyond fantastic especially in blu ray and if Walt Disney were alive today, he would be so proud of this and so many other heartwarming and visually stunning films the Disney Studio's are putting out in the new blu ray versions! This is a 5 Star Film that your family will absolutely love!",1257984000,,1755,4.633440514469453

This time around Tinker Bell has to contend with the honor of making a Fall scepter specifically to represent Tinkers.  She has a new friend in this movie, but you'll see how that friendship previals when Tinker Bell's infamous temper and impatience comes into play.

Not really spoiling the movie, you'll see how the value of friendship, patience, and appreciation for someone else unfolds in this delightful 2nd installment.  The animation is top-notch and it's hard to fathom how this level of quality makes it a direct-to-DVD release, but enjoy it anyway!  It looks pheonomenal on DVD; I can only imagine that it looks breathtaking on the Blu-Ray release.

3847568,5,B0024NSFZI,"Tinker Bell is a tinker fairy - an inventor of marvelous machines.  She is requested by Fairy Mary to design and build a special scepter for displaying the one-of-a-kind blue moonstone.  At the Autumn Revelry, the light from the harvest moon will strike the stone, creating a supply of pixie dust that the fairies need for flying.  Tinker Bell's best friend is Terrence whose clumsiness leads to the destruction of both the scepter and the stone.  Soon afterwards, Tinker Bell's anger destroys their friendship.  Alone and unhappy, she must risk her life as she travels on a dangerous journey in search of a magical mirror that will hopefully restore the scepter and stone.  She must find it in time for the Autumn Revelry or there will be no more pixie dust and life in Pixie Hollow will be drastically altered forever.

  Everyone of all ages should see ""Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure"" because everyone of all ages needs a friend.  This is definitely a heart-warming, family film from Walt Disney.  It is a beautiful, sweet story that stresses the importance of friendship and forgiveness.  A few harsh words can easily destroy the friendship you share with someone.  But a few simple words - ""Please forgive me."" - can easily restore it.  I suppose humans aren't the only ones who are stubborn.  Tinker Bell soon learns the errors of her ways when she encounters trolls, rats and other obstacles that even made me nervous and apprehensive.  The lost treasure that is referred to in the title is not the magic mirror that she seeks but the friendship she once shared with Terrence.

  Destined to become another classic, ""Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure"" is romantic adventure that comes from the heart.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Having enjoyed this film, I must see the sequel, ""Tinker Bell: A Winter Story;"" its trailer is provided in the special features.  (Captured by a little girl and put inside a jar, Tinker Bell must rely on her friends for rescue.)  I enjoyed the film's bloopers, which were cute.  The deleted scenes were roughly drawn sketches with voiceovers.  They consisted of the vortex that endangers Tinker Bell's flying machine; more antics from the trolls (who are the best of friends); Tinker Bell bravely threatening a bullfrog to spit out her firefly friend, Blaze; and a tearful goodbye when Blaze rejoins his family.  Most of these scenes were heartwarming because they emphasized the importance of friendship.

  Demi Lovato of the Disney Channel is a lovely girl with a beautiful voice; I highly enjoyed her music video for ""The Gift of a Friend.""  It also emphasized the importance of friendship and was a great theme song for ""Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure.""  However, the special feature that I enjoyed most was ""Pixie Hollow Comes to Walt Disney World.""  It gives a graphic account of how the gardens and topiaries are created for the Pixie Hollow exhibit at the Epcot Center.  Seeing this colorful display of flowers and shrubs made me want to visit it in person.  It was a genuine labor of love and friendship among coworkers.  In fact, the entire film was a labor of love and friendship that is shared between director Klay Hall and producer Sean Lurie.  Their friendship is evident when they host the deleted scenes, jokingly explaining why they were removed.

Instead the movie had a good story line, the characters were great and the themes were wonderful for a family. The main theme that was stressed (in our opinion) was forgiveness, the minor theme was how to make the most of a bad situation no matter how bad it seems.

Overall, a positive move for a family.",1257638400,,461,4.2988505747126435
3847570,4,B0024NSFZI,"Nobody's going to confuse this with the classics; nevertheless, it's pretty decent and has a nice message about friendship.  It's more of a kids' film than a family film, although it's not awful for adults to sit through.  The adventure story, which has enough action to keep kids interested but isn't especially scary, should appeal to both boys and girls.

The A/V quality is on par with other CGI animation done on a good budget; in other words: fantastic.  The brightly colored image detail was a joy to look at and the DTS soundtrack sparkled.

As for the extras, which are in HD, they're a mixed bag.  The best pieces are the featurette on the Pixie Hollow topiaries created for EPCOT's garden show (8 minutes) and the deleted scenes, which include discussion by the director and producer of what they did and why they were cut (16 minutes altogether).  The phony gag reel (4 minutes) is hit and miss.  The ""Magical Guide to Pixie Hollow,"" which uses ""motion comics"" style semi-animation, is a watch-once-and-forget-about-it item (4.5 minutes).  Rounding out the extras is a Demi Lovato music video (3.5 minutes), which will appeal to Demi Lovato fans.  Several trailers are also included.

Also included is a standard DVD of the film, which also includes all the extras.  Nice to have for the car or the bedroom TV.  This disc also has a cute 4.5-minute ad for the Blu-Ray format that features the actors who play Zack & Cody and their mom from the Disney Channel ""Suite Life"" shows.",1257552000,,1490,4.750972762645914

I got it for my 6 year old daughter to watch and she invited her best friend over and they had a blast. They spent the movie enthralled and broke out into dance during some of the songs. When it was over, my daughter said she liked the music the best. Its well animated and has a great storyline that will even keep adults entertained. There are a few extras such as the tour of Pixie Hollow and a look at the new Faerie gardens at Disney World and Disney Land, which now my daughter is begging to visit, lol.

3847574,4,B0024NSFZI,"First things first: I applaud Disney for putting both a normal DVD and a blu-ray disc in the same package, and for little to no extra cost. This way kids can take the movie to their friend's house without worrying which format they have.

Now. I'm a 32 year old male. I generally am not a Disney fan. The only Disney things I've ever liked are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leroy-Stitch/dp/B000F48D5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leroy & Stitch</a>&nbsp;or anything related to Uncle Scrooge (preferably Carl Banks or Don Rosa related). However, I was surprised at how well written and cute this was.

The CGI was pretty well done and the film looks great in Blu-Ray. It was a bit jarring to hear Tinker Bell talk as I remember her being mute in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Pan-2-Disc-Platinum-Edition/dp/B000JBWWRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Pan (2-Disc Platinum Edition)</a>&nbsp;and her multiple cameos in other Disney pieces, but I quickly adjusted and got used to it.

The plot is simply but will be a lot of fun for kids to follow. Tinker Bell turns out to be a tinker/inventor in this movie and she is asked to build a new scepter to contain the moonstone, which is the source of all fairie power as it triggers Fairy Dust. Of course, things are never that simply and when something really awful happens, Tinker Bell has to fix things, save the day, and learn the true meaning of friends.

This is going to be a great film for kids, and the extras will really increase the life of the disc. It's definitely geared for younger viewers, but parents will be able to enjoy this while watching it with their children. If I was able to enjoy this for what it was, and I'm more a horror movie and/or documentary kind of guy, then pretty much anyone will be able to.",1257379200,,1866,5.21
3847575,4,B0024NSFZI,"First let me start off by saying that I received this Blu-Ray disc for free and I normally wouldn't order a Tinker bell movie as my (almost) 3 year old son has no interest in a movie unless it has cars, trucks, robots or monsters in it.  With that said, I can clearly state that my son did sit down to watch this but began asking for Wall-E about 5 minutes in.  I left it on for a few more minutes but he showed no interest.  He ended up leaving the room to go play with his cars and I tried to sit through some of the movie (made it about 20 minutes).  Like my son, I couldn't get into the movie as I normally would with other Disney kid's movies like Toy Story, Monster's Inc.  Etc..  I had to take 1 star away due to the movie itself as it does not seem to be a movie my son will ever watch.

Why 4 stars....first, the picture quality.  Like other Disney movies, the picture quality of this Blu-Ray is top notch.  I use a PS3 to play my BR discs and this has to rate as one of the best looking movies I've seen.  Second, the sound.  I wish all BR discs used DTS Master as the main soundtrack as I find DTS to blow away Dolby Digital.  The sounds and songs on this disc are incredible. Just wish I could get into it.  Maybe in time!.

Finally, the packaging of this disc is what every BR disc should be.  If you buy the BR version, you also get the regular DVD.  I can't stress how important this is to me and I feel every BR disc you buy should either come with a regular DVD version or (at worst) a digital version that you can play on your computer.  While I agree digital right management (DRM) is needed, movie studios need to embrace the changes that have been taking place for years in digital media.  I am thankful that several of the Disney BR discs I own such as this one and Wall-E give you the flexibility of watching it in BR or, if you want to watch it at friends house who doesn't have BR, a regular version for either streaming or DVD player.  I recently bought Monsters VS. Aliens on BR and it only came with the BR disc...very annoying.

Sorry I didn't like the film but for Tinker bell fans out there, you will love the quality of the video and sound.",1257379200,,2172,4.04215456674473
3847576,1,B0024NSFZI,"It is VERY pretty, but basically what would a kid learn from watching this thing? That you should lie, convince your friends to steal for you, never admit when you do something wrong, treat your friends like crap & it's okay. In fact you will celebrated!

Tinkerbell treats her good friends badly because she gets frustrated. She breaks a priceless heirloom and then un-friends a friend because he won't steal for her so she can go off on some crazy scheme to fix it. She blows the chance of fixing the damn heirloom cause she once again treats a friend like crap. She never admits that she broke the priceless heirloom but manages after the friend does steal for her to magically create something so fabulous that everyone is overjoyed.

They came only a few minutes into the movie and all of them--an 8 year old girl, a 6 year old boy, and a 3 year boy--were glued to the TV until the show was over.  I almost wonder if they would have asked to finish the show if it had gotten dark (and we were ready to go trick-or-treating).  Since then, my daughter has asked to see the show several times.  I've watched parts of it with her and unlike many kids movies, it wasn't a painful experience for me... not that I'd ever turn it on for myself, but when she asks me to sit down and watch parts of it with her, I don't have to come up with an excuse to do something else instead.  Also, of the parts that I've seen, I haven't seen anything objectionable.  On the contrary, a large part of the movie seems to focus around forgiving people when they do something you don't like and apologize.  It's not done in an obnoxious, preachy sort of way, but the lesson is still taught.

The colors are pretty and some of the animation is visually interesting, but the story is so one dimensional that it's difficult for me to imagine anyone but a very young child finding this film particularly engaging.  The people working for Disney today should be forced to watch (and re-watch and re-watch) old classics like Dumbo or Bambi.  Maybe if they did, they would learn something about bringing emotion to animated pictures.  Unfortunately, TinkerBell just falls flat.

Both girls got giggles from parts of the movie.  My youngest apparently laughed every time Tink counts.

Some new characters introduced since the first film, including a chubby fairy sounding an awful lot like Sean Connery after a spontaneous appendectomy, were refreshing.  Mae Whitman, as Tink, is even better at it this time 'round.

It's a direct to DVD release, a practice by Disney and other studios that is starting to pick up. If I didn't know better, I would almost think that the studios were considering this type of marketing as an alternative to theatrical release after so many films tanked this year. CGI animation has come a long way over the past decade and while this film might have done well at the theaters, I can understand the studio's decision to market it this way.

The Tinkerbell franchise is selling well, as releases are planned all the way into 2011. This particular DVD is the second Tinkerbell film and is even more complex visually than the first release. I grew up with Walt Disney stuff and I think if he were alive today, he'd be pretty impressed with this one. Get your copy today!

3847584,5,B0024NSFZI,"All fans of Tinker Bell and her first movie have no reason to worry; ""Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure"" is a full-worthy sequel to the first movie. Considering that there's only one year of absence between the movies, the filmmakers have done a good job to make this a complete movie and not only a product for cash-cowing, like it easily could have been.

Although I enjoyed last years Tinker Bell adventure, I definitively enjoyed this film more. The previews who were released before the movie came out seemed very promising and the final movie definitively lived up to the expectations. This ""sequel"" is more dynamic in many ways. It opens with the catchy and inspiring ""If You Believe"". The plot is more engaging, more suspenseful and it has a few more action sequences than it's predecessor, but this is after all a G-rated family film, so it never crosses the line.

The film focus more on the relationship between Tink and Terence this time, which serves the movie well. Tink herself is presented as a versatile character and the fact that she actually talks feels never distracting in neither of the movies.

Otherwise, this film has the cuteness-factor like the first flick had, which only makes the experience more enjoyable, but it's also a bit more edgier in terms of the adventurous plot. The animation is even better this time, the characters are still likable and the cute score of Joel McNeely fits the movie well. Besides, there are more humor in the screenplay.

So don't hesitate by seeing this movie when it comes to DVD. It is a cute and sweet movie experience and a wonderful movie threat for kids and every Tinker Bell fan.",1257033600,,1648,4.711805555555555

The voice acting was good and the story was enjoyable as a whole. Young kids will enjoy this movie but it's standable for all ages.",1256774400,,406,4.217948717948718
3847597,5,B0024NSFZI,"The general rule is that sequels are never better than the first, but Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure not only breaks that rule, it shatters it. The first Tinker Bell film, a spin-off of Disney's version of Peter Pan from 1953, came out last year and basically served the purpose of introducing us to Pixie Hollow, it's inhabitants, and everyone's favorite feisty pixie. It was fun and entertaining, but lacked in interesting story. The second installment in the series doesn't waste time with character development and flies right into the good stuff.

Every eight years, fairies in Pixie Hollow use a precious moon stone and the light of the harvest moon to replenish their supply of Pixie Dust for the next eight years. This year, Tinker Bell has been given the important task of making a scepter to fit the one and only moon stone. But when it gets destroyed, she must set out on a quest to find a magic mirror that will grant her one wish (so that she can wish for another moon stone). The problem is that the mirror is hidden with a lost treasure, the treasure is North of Never Land, and Tinker Bell might not have enough Pixie Dust to get her their. With faith, trust, a little bit of pixie dust, and help from her friend Terrance and Blaze, an adorable firefly sure to win your heart, Tinker Bell is on a race against the clock to find the treasure and get back to Pixie Hollow before the harvest moon, or all will be lost.

For a direct to video film, not only does the story exceed expectations, but so does the animation. While it's not on par with theatrical releases from Disney or Pixar, it is sure to blow you away when you compare it to other animated films that were made to bypass movie theaters. One scene in particular will astound you on Blu-Ray, in which a fairy storyteller uses pixie dust to tell the tale of the lost treasure. The black levels are marvelous and the imagery is breathtaking.

In terms of bonus features, Disney has provided a nice assortment that should appeal to a wide range of viewers. For the littler ones, there is ""Magical Guide to Pixie Hollow: Fall,"" which is a continuation of a feature from the first film's Blu-Ray. The ""Guide"" uses art from the popular book series and is hosted by Tink and Terrance, who take you around some of the areas shown in the film, and some that only exist in the book. For all ages, but mostly adults with an interest in gardening and Disney Parks, there is ""Pixie Hollow Comes to Walt Disney World"" about the exhibit that was done for Epcot's 2009 Flower & Garden Festival. For film fans, there are eight deleted scenes in storyboard form, with introductions by the director and writer. For Disney Channel fans, there is a music video for ""Gift of a Friend"" by tween-sensation Demi Lovato. But the best bonus feature on the disc is called ""Scenes You Never Saw,"" which is an intentional blooper reel, similar to the ones Pixar did for ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Toy Story 2,"" and ""Monster's Inc."" The blooper reel is fun for all ages and the best part is that it features some of the characters that weren't afforded much screen time in this film (Rosetta, Silvermist, Fawn, Iridessa, and Vidia).

If you're a Disney fan, an animation fan, or a Tinker Bell fan, then you are sure to enjoy Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure. Kids are sure to want to watch it over and over, which is why Disney has included a DVD of the film so they can watch it on any TV in your house, not just the one(s) with a Blu-Ray player. But chances are that parents will find themselves wrapped up in the story and enjoying it right along with them.

A preview is included for the third film, ""Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue,"" which comes to Blu-Ray in Fall 2010. It will be the third of five planned films, but if the series keeps up the successful momentum it has, I'm sure they will find a way to extend it.",1256688000,,3868,4.434599156118144
3847598,4,B0024NSFZI,"Am I a fan of Tinker Bell? Quite frankly, no. But I respect good animated movies. And if you put together the animation technology available these days with a decent Blue Ray player, you are in for a treat with the latest from the Disney Studios. The movie's high definition quality is very impressive, making the textures, landscapes and characters shine in a very impressive way.

The story is good: no villains in sight (except perhaps for the rats that make a brief appearance in the last quarter of the movie), with a good lesson for children to learn. Some of the characters pick up where the first Tinker Bell movie left and a few make their Pixie Hollow debut, such as Tinker Bell's best friend Terrance (voiced by Jesse McCartney) and Blaze, a cute firefly determined to stay by Tink's side.

As for the extras, I have to say I was a bit disappointed at how little interesting additional content could be found in the Blue Ray in comparison to what one normally finds on standard DVDs. There's the typical trailers, deleted scenes and bloopers along with a short with Tink and Terrance showing you around Pixie Hollow and a Backstage Disney video highlighting Pixie Hollow in Disneyland.

The movie is a great work. But it's not worth five stars, considering how little (interesting) additional content comes with the disc besides the film itself.",1256601600,,1356,4.761702127659574

I picked it up early today and we were able to watch it together this afternoon.

Though my enjoyment of the film could not possibly have matched the pleasure I took in watching my granddaughter's face glow with joy, gasp with dismay and dissolve into laughter as SHE watched the film, I'm happy to admit that I darned well liked it, too.

Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure in a genuine delight. Moms, dads and grandparents should be entertained right along with the little ones. The story of friendship, arguments, placing blame and taking responsibility is a very good one for the target audience (and the rest of us as well, for that matter). But above and beyond the story, what really stands out for me in this film is the incredible amount of creativity that lies behind it. The Imagineers have done a wonderful job ""tinkering"" with the natural elements of Pixie Hollow to make everything: clothing, tools, everyday items, machines to complete each fairy's work, etc. It's so much fun to see what they come up with. My favorite touch was the cricket clock.

I also enjoyed getting a chance to go beyond Pixie Hollow and see a little more of the world surrounding Neverland. I liked seeing more of Terence, got a big kick out of the wise owl (there are more scenes with the owl in the extras), loved the calla lily trumpets and found the trolls very amusing.

Extras: Though I'm sure she wasn't getting all the jokes, the ""bloopers"" had both my granddaughter and me laughing out loud.

I've heard that two or three additional Tinker Bell films are planned, with the next being Tinker Bell & The Great Fairy Rescue. I can only hope my granddaughter anticipates the coming films with the same enthusiasm she anticipated this one and that I'll be with her as she views each of them for the first time so that I can watch her face reflect their magic as well.

Happily recommended.

3847601,5,B0024NSFZI,"Note: The review that follows is of the ""Combo Pack"" edition of  Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure in both the DVD and Blu-ray formats, released on October 27, 2009.

Based on my observations of the young children who watched this film with me, this latest Tinker Bell film will be an especially popular animated feature among those in the 4-ten age group. Although it lacks the powerful story line and colorful characters found in Snow White and Pinocchio, it offers abundant charm and I appreciate the absence of Disney's darker themes (e.g. separation from loved ones as well as humiliation and repudiation, as in Dumbo) that upset many younger children. Tinker Bell is a creature of mischief whose various adventures entertain rather than generate concern. The plot (such as it is) involves Tink in a journey by hot air balloon from Pixie Hollow to locate a new moonstone to produce the fairies' magical dust. Blaze (a lightning bug) is her enlightening companion and, of course, there are lots of complications and disruptions before Terence appears to rescue them. At least a few younger viewers will pick up on the understated life lessons that Tink learns from her experiences but the primary objective, as always, is to affirm certain basic human values such as faith and trust.

The quality of image and sound is outstanding, as is the musical score.  Bonus features include ""Fairy Bloopers: Fairies Make Mistakes Too,"" ""Magical Guide to Pixie Hollow: Explore the magical Guide This Time in the Autumn Area of Pixie Hollow,"" ""Pixie Preview: Exclusive Animated Vignette"" featuring Tink and her friends, deleted scenes with filmmaker intros, and ""Pixie Hollow comes to Florida: Discover how the filmmakers help transform Epcot Center into Pixie Hollow."" However, as is also true of so many other recent Disney re-releases, younger children will have little (if any) interest in the bonus features, other than the games and musicales, whereas many of their parents, grandparents, and other older family members will enjoy ""behind the screen"" material. I always do. In fact, I have purchased a number of DVDs that, together, cover most of the history and operations throughout the years that Disney led the company.

I think each ""Combo Pack"" (i.e. providing both DVD and Blu-ray versions) is really quite a bargain. Even for those who do not have Blu-ray capability now, they will have it sooner rather than later. Also, their children's or grandchildren's friends may have it and this film can be shared with them.  Blu-ray technology creates the clearest images I have observed thus far, lacking only the spatial dimensions of 3D.

Those in need of some pixie dust in their lives will cherish this film.",1256601600,,2712,5.026726057906459
3847602,5,B0024NSFZI,"Ever since I watched ""Tinker Bell"" last year, I kept asking myself why this animated feature didn't make it to the big screen. It is certainly well made, and I'm sure it would have found an audience. After all, there are thousands of little girls that like and identify with Tinker Bell. Now, for my pleasant surprise, we have the equally exquisite and fun - and I would say better -- ""Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure,"" which comes to us via a grand Blue Ray plus DVD two-disc set.

In this second installment of the series, we find Tinker Bell as happy as ever in her lovely and magical Pixie Hollow. Unbeknown to her, her peace will be disturbed by an unusual assignment, which is only given to exceptional people: she is ordered by Queen Clarion and the Minister of Autumn to build a magical fall scepter. This scepter has to follow very concise specifications, because it will be responsible to focus the light of the rare Blue Moon into a moonstone. As a result of this process, Pixie Hollow's supply of Pixie dust - the source of their magic -- will be replenished. Being highly creative and motivated, she enthusiastically accepts the mission and goes immediately to work. While immersed in her endeavor, her good friend Terence offers to help, and she graciously accepts - they had limited amount of time to reach the deadline. However, just about when the scepter was completed, an accident produces the moonstone and scepter to be broken into pieces. This incident creates friction between Tinker Bell and Terence, and forces her to fly away, by herself, from Pixie Hollow to a distant land, to find a replacement for the moonstone. In the way, she will face many dangers and plenty of adventures.

""Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure"" is great fun. It is visually stunning, and it has a message about true friendship. In addition, contrary to many Disney friendly characters, Tinker Bell does have a temper and it is interesting to see how she slowly accepts her mistakes. The fantastic Blue Ray disc, in addition to its crisp picture, also includes features describing several aspects of the production, additional scenes, deleted scenes, the music video ""The Gift of a Friend,"" and more. Released October 27, 2009. (USA, 2009, color, 80 min plus additional material).

3847603,5,B0024NSFZI,"While the first Tinkerbell movie was to me acceptable, this one was actually enjoyable.  Partly this could be because I am now used to thinking of Tinkerbell as not the Tinkerbell from Peter Pan, but a new Tink reinvented to make Disney some more money. However, this time around, I think they did such a good job that I was not annoyed with the makeover!  My 6 yr old daughter also thought this movie was ""the greatest"" (her words). Although she liked the first one, she didn't want to watch it over and over and over. This one, she says, is one she wants to watch again and again, which means it may actually be worth adding to your collection.  If you haven't seen the first movie, this movie can stand alone on it's own, which is always nice.  Both Tink 1 and this movie have messages (accepting who you are, and accepting responsibility, respectively), but I think this Tink installment did a better job of incorporating the message into the story.

Picture & Sound:
On Blu-ray, the picture is beautiful; it's one of the movies that makes me just want to stare at my screen!  The sound is 5.1 (instead of 7.1 as in some of the newer Blue-rays), and although it's not full of surround effects, it is well done, and most will enjoy the Celtic style music (brought back from the first) that accompanies most of the movie.

Extras:
The 16 mins of deleted scenes are not exciting for kids unless they are into the technical aspects of how movies are made (they are in storyboard format), but your little & tween girls will probably love the Demi Lovato song/video as mine did.

Overall:
This is a keeper and definitely worth buying as opposed to renting!",1256515200,,1654,4.508361204013378
3847604,4,B0024NSFZI,"I'm not a fan of Disney's home video sequels and features.  They are most always cheap cash ins that twist and contort the characters and their world.  So it was with great hesitation that I watched Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure.  Imagine my surprise when I found myself actually enjoying the movie.  Now the story is not as deep and the characters not as layered as the best Pixar films, but what this movie does have is heart, integrity and a winning character in Tinker Bell herself.

The story revolves around Tinker Bell being charged with making a special scepter for the years autumn festival.  Along the way, she's going to learn some lessons about controlling her temper, apologizing and just how strong friendship can be.  None of these lessons are beat over your head and I really liked the way Tinker Bell had to learn there were consequences for her actions.  The story is definitely aimed at young girls but I can easily imagine the entire family sitting down to enjoy this together.

The pace of the movie slows down in a few spots, the songs will not be remembered afterwards and the animation is sometimes a bit off (too stiff here, a bit too wobbly there), but more often than not the art is top notch.  Check out the dust particles seen in the ""flashlight's"" beam on the ship.  There are lots of beautiful backgrounds and settings to enjoy as well.  Thankfully the Blu-ray quality is nearly pristine and all the detail shines through.

The disc doesn't offer much in the way of bonus features, which is a bit of disappointment, but the faked blooper reel is quite fun.  Why Disney continues to offer music video's though is beyond me.  Perhaps I'm not young enough to enjoy them.

These few quibbles aside, Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure is a delight.  There's an ""aw shucks"" kind of vibe to it that reminds me of Disney's stories from the 1950's.  The story teaches lessons in a gentle entertaining way and isn't afraid to show it's heroine behaving badly before she learns the error of her ways.  In other words this is classic Disney here folks.  A lost treasure indeed and delightfully found on this Blu-ray.",1256428800,,2138,4.620689655172414

Still, I wasn't quite sure that this particular ""franchise"" needed a sequel. So, with trepidation I put this disc into my player. ""Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure"" actually blows away its predecessor. Sure, the story is a tad predictable, but with fantastic new characters (including Blaze the firefly, and the two Trolls at the Troll Gate), returning favorites (Garden fairy Rosetta whose bubbly personality is pure Dolly Parton), and top-notch animation, this movie will be a joy to watch for all ages.

The story: Tinker Bell is entrusted with the creation of the scepter for the Autumn Revelry. Her friend Terence offers to help, but his micro-managing of Tink sets her off, and in her anger, she accidentally breaks the precious and rare moonstone, threatening the life of everyone in Pixie Hollow. Lashing out at Terence, the friendship between these two fairies is jeopardized, and Tink must find a way to fix the moonstone...and the friendship. The rest you'll have to watch on your own; this synopsis is greatly simplified, but I do not want to give away any spoilers.

On Tink's journey to repair the moonstone, she is joined by Blaze, a firefly. He is absolutely adorable, and given plenty of spunk and character by the Disney animation team. The animation team deserves a plethora of kudos; on Blu-ray (good reason to upgrade from DVD!) this movie will take your breath away; especially the scene in the Fairy Tale Theater. The lighting effects are amazing; absolutely beautiful. All throughout the movie there are many visual touches that will show that the people behind this movie took special care to elevate this many notches above the usual straight-to-video movie. Hidden Mickeys, Skull Rock, and plenty of other details that bear repeated viewings. The Celtic-style music is back, but I feel it is blended much better into the movie than it was in the original film. I really can't say enough good things about this movie.

SPECS:
Video: Widescreen, 1.78:1 * Audio: English 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound, French & Spanish; subtitles: English, French & Spanish. While the audio is crystal clear and pleasing to listen to, there are really no dynamic uses of the surround that seemed memorable to me.

EXTRAS:

Backstage Disney

Tinker Bell Comes to Disney World (8:20): Both Disneyland in Anaheim & Disney World in Orlando have Pixie Hollow areas, but this featurette focues on the Orlando version which has beautiful topiaries and 3-dimensional recreations of objects from this movie. With careful attention to colors and characterization from the movie, garden designer Carla Schuman and team discuss how it all came together.

Deleted Scenes (16:00): Includes intros by Director Klay Hall and Producer Sean Lurie

Alternate Scenes (4:00): These are pretty much manufactured bloopers that are fun to watch, including gaffes, some bodily function jokes, as well as a few other mildly funny/amusing bits.

Bonus Short (4:46): This is a magical guide to the Autumn area of Pixie Hollow, led by Terence & Tinker Bell. Pleasant to watch, it does appear to be more of an advertisement for [...] than a true short. Even the animation style is a little static and looks more like a 2-dimensional book illustration with simple movement than an animated film.

""The Gift of a Friend"" music video, performed by Disney Channel's Demi Lovato
