The beginning of the film really captures the magical world of wizardry, from the goblins to the first quidditch game. It stands well enough alone as a movie - you don't really need to know much about Harry Potter before watching it.

The kids are excellent actors. Rewatching it again after many, many years, I was impressed with the range of young Ron's emotions (by contrast, I find his later character a bit boring and pouty). They're adorable and frankly well cast.

Some of the later Harry Potter films are better produced and have better special effects, but few are so satisfying.

The second installment in the Harry Potter series has some fun moments. I love the character of Gilderoy Lockhart. He's well played and adds humor to the movie. Hagrid's character also gets some more development.

I'm not as crazy about the plot. It's a bit too convoluted, and much of it is never really explained well (even after watching ""Half-Blood Prince,"" I still don't understand how Voldemort could have controlled Ginny Weasley or lived through a book). Dobby was really annoying. He's way too dramatic and a sadomasochist to boot. Would anybody really believe that programming a ball to attack and almost kill Harry Potter was really going to succeed in keeping him away from Hogwarts? It just doesn't add up.

Also, the basilisk and spiders were somewhat disappointing and pretty dull. The spiders aren't as exciting as Shelob in Lord of the Rings. The basilisk was somewhat believable, but sometimes looked like a big movie prop. Maybe a special edition could be released with better monster designs.

Overall, this is probably tied with ""Half-Blood Prince"" as my least favorite in the series. It's definitely worth watching if you like the Harry Potter movies, but should have been much better.",1264204800,,1935,4.920245398773006
8232550,5,B0001WTWZ6,"I just saw the Harry Potter movies recently, after they have been out for months.  I never understood the obsession people had with watching these movies but when I watched them I finally got it.  They are so cute and so creative.  I just absolutely loved them and I am very glad I gave them a chance, which originally I wasn't going to do.  I think they are great for kids and adults.  They take you into a world of enchantment and magic. Most movies that I have seen attempt this fail. The movies bring out the creative and dreamy side in everyone, not just children.  It has a mystery story plot, yet has a great deal of humor in it too.  I usually do not like mysteries at all but these movies keep you guessing until the end and I love that.  I highly recommend them for adults, children, everyone! Take it from someone who never had any desire to see them and who finally did, if you watch these movies you too will fall in love.",1087776000,4,935,4.213483146067416
8232551,5,B0001WTWZ6,"The first two of the Harry Potter series are extremely entertaining, imaginitive movies originated from two incredibly well planned, well written novels, and are definitely worth adding to your collection today!  I bought them originally on VHS but gave them away when I decided to switch to the DVD and I couldn't be happier.  These are some of the few movies (and books) I cannot wait for.
The 3rd movie, The Prisoner of Azkaban, is also an excellent movie, though, because of a new director, was filmed differently - and it shows.  The scenery has transformed completely, and the storyline does not follow the book as precisely as the first two.  Still, amazing nonetheless - the entire series is surely something you'll want to own yourself!",1087171200,5,745,4.888888888888889
