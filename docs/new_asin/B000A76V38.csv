8075331,3,B000A76V38,"I have tried many of the workouts in the WHFN series, and to be honest have not clicked with most of them.  Push Pull is a solid workout that is quite challenging in spots, but for some reason it doesn't speak to me.  I personally feel that the FitPrime series is more suitable for me than the KickButt series, with the exception of Crunch Time and Steamin' Cardio.

Heidi Tanner leads the strength portions and Kimberly Spreen leads the cardio portions, many of which are kickboxing.  I found that I only really liked the kickboxing segments in this workout.  I felt they both did a nice job of leading this workout.  For me the workout just dragged and I just wansn't engaged in it at all.  Plus, I found the music in some segments to be just dreadful.  There are quite a bit of compound movements that are effective in working the muscles, and some of it is heavy work that I found to be difficult. Other times I found it tough to balance while doing certain moves.  I think this workout was beyond my level and the Fitprime series is more my cup of tea.

I will give it 3 and a half stars, for me it was a dud though.",1451692800,,1121,4.245283018867925
8075332,5,B000A76V38,"This DVD works every part of your body with stretching, weights, yoga, and aerobic breaks with Kimberly Spreen. Kimberly really added to the video with fun, low impact kickboxing routines. I have always liked Heidi Tanner in the Firm workouts because she is down to earth and makes the workouts fun.  I like this DVD because it is just the right amount of difficulty for me; I do it on a break day or when I don't feel like doing a super-strenuous workout. I do not sit as Heidi does when doing some of the arm work; I keep moving my legs for a little more of a workout. It also breaks your routing when you stop and sit down. I have learned to do this in The Firm workouts also. I really like the yoga moves in this DVD; they are just right for me and I don't overpull any muscles when I do them.

This DVD is paced well, is interesting and has both weight training and aerobics. It is one of my favorites. I also like the background and music in the Kick Butt series.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD-Kick-Butt-WHFN-FitPrime-PUSH-PULL-Pilates-Yoga-Weights/dp/B000A76V38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD Kick Butt!

8075333,5,B000A76V38,"As a veteran of the classic ""FIRM"" series from the late 80s, I find this to be the perfect effective evolution of the method -- FUSION adds welcomed elements of Yoga and Pilates to the standard Aerobics with Weights theory, resulting in a workout that's both challenging and very well balanced.  The leaders are both warm and engaging and the cueing is clear and precise.  This, and a number of the companion tapes in the ""KickButt"" and ""FitPrime"" series, has become one of my standard, favorite choices!",1199318400,5,504,4.781609195402299
8075334,5,B000A76V38,"The original ""Firm"" sisters created this workout, a perfect mix of weights and cardio. Well produced, not boring or irritating...what could be better?Check out all the new fitprimes,which have a much better production quality than the originals.",1121126400,5,245,5.648648648648648
