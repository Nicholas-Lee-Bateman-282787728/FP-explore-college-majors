4853182,2,B005OK721G,"""I used to want to be Xena Warrior Princess, now I want to be a killer. Can you help?"" After watching her parents get killed in front of her, 9 year old Cataleya makes her way to Chicago to see her uncle. After being trained by him to be an assassin she soon goes off on her own for revenge. This is a difficult movie to review. The first 20 minutes is very exciting, but when Cataleya grows up it slows way way down. The rest of the movie drags a lot and while there is quite a bit of action it does not really hold your attention. Saldana does a good job in this, but the movie did not do a good job of showcasing her style of action. I would compare this to ""Hanna"" which was about a young girl looking for revenge on the murderer of her father. These movies had very similar plots but ""Hanna"" was a much more fast paced and exciting movie. This movie is also like ""Salt"" but a much slower version. This is very OK, nothing exciting. Overall, if given the choice between this one or ""Hanna"", I would choose ""Hanna"". I give it a C.",1321056000,34,1033,4.068627450980392

4853214,5,B005OK721G,"Columbiana is a no-let-up action-filled revenge thriller where the protagonist is a smart willful beautiful young woman. When she was a pre-teen in Columbia in 1992, she sees gangsters with whom her father worked and her mother murdered by the gang. She saves herself by stabbing one of the killers in his hand. She escapes to the US, to Chicago, and joins her uncle who is a gangster. She tells him that she wants to be a killer.
He trains her and she grows up to become a very competent hired killer. She unusually good at it. We see scenes where she performs extraordinary feats to gain entry to her victim and kill him. She enjoys this work, but it is not what she really wants to do. She wants to take revenge against the people involved in the murder of her family. She sends messages to them indicating she is coming to kill them.
The gang searches for her to protect themselves, and the police go after her to stop the dozens of killings she has done.",1524182400,2,959,4.393258426966292

4853341,3,B005OK721G,"This isn't a bad little thriller and Zoe Saldana makes a kick-ass action heroine. But outside of that, this movie is kind of ""meh"" for me. The problem lies in the lack of character development that La Femme Nikita and The Professional did so well, with less time. And that character development IS important to a story. It's what makes a person able to suspend disbelief in favor or rooting for the characters or not rooting for them.

Instead this movie favored some pretty unbelievable action sequences without really giving us enough backstory to believe the characters could do what they would do. In La Femme Nikita we got enough backstory to believe that Nikita could actually be a bad-ass warrior chick who get enough training to be able to figure out how to do what she did. This just felt disjointed and went from amazing little girl who somehow could lead professional killers on a wild chase to full-on Mission Impossible assassin for hire with a side dish of revenge.

There are individual scenes that someone threw into the script just to ""have a thrilling scene where a car full of random people are shot up and hit a fire hydrant"" that add nothing to the story and made me disbelieve the characters, because no real professional assassin trying to stay off the radar of the world would ever do. And then to stand there in broad daylight with witnesses talking to a little girl while holding a big gun like you're discussing a dance recital she doesn't want to do? Yeah, nope, could not buy that. And it pretty much broke any suspension of disbelief I had in the character from there.

It was fun to see bad guys getting taken out, it always is, but it was just very predictable and something we've seen done so many times that it just felt like paint by numbers action. Again part of what made Nikita and Leon such wonderful, believable characters were the range of emotions they had during and after pulling off their respective jobs. Zoe Saldana's character just seems magically unstoppable and she has about as much emotion as a Terminator when offing someone.

Add to that some pretty giant plot holes and you get a story that while fun to watch isn't much of anything else. I suspect studio heads probably demanded more ""cool"" action sequences and explosions and therefore the writer or writers just didn't have enough room to make us really care about any of the characters the way we should have. And that's a shame, because the bones of this story were really, really great. It's just that the promise never really materialized and I ended up predicting everything in the film that came to pass.

And I hate that about films. Surprise me, make me fall in love with a character - good guy or bad, I don't care - and I will pretty much be able to ignore things like how a little girl might actually go up against trained killers and at least hold her own. The Professional did that for me, this movie did not.

But please do cast Zoe Saldana in more action roles. She is wonderful, it's not her fault she only had so much to work with and she did an outstanding job with what she had. Others will likely enjoy this film, it's definitely not the worst, just a bit of a disappointment.",1478822400,8,3204,4.534602076124568

4853370,5,B005OK721G,"This is a pretty good, let me rephrase, it is a good action revenge film.
Zoe Saldana as well as the kid girl was amazing and from the beginning till the revenge is fulfilled, there is no place to breaze or take a rest at all.
Because of this movie's success the director was able to make the movie <TAKEN 2>.

The story is quite cliche and if I tell you it will ruin your appetite.

The great thing about this film is not the story but about how to show, the duration the way how she does it. The charactor, the each moments watching it as audience.

The first moment, when both parents got killed and the kid girl is escapeing from a bunch of killers zig-zag town camera up and down, hellicopter shots, hand held, quick cuts crazy scene crazy to watch better then <TAKEN 1> from that moment you will feel how decent this action flick is.

This movie never lingers or stops any moment.
She manages enough to be a brave girl to go to America all by herself to meet her uncle. Amazing! That process and you will be so proud for her for her work. Yes unreal for some how. But who cares.
It just dashes to the moment she grows up to ZOE SALDANA grows up to a revenger.
She goes to the prison to kill a guy. Yes intentionally.
Then from then on, the movie dashes to show all the revenge. Some dangerous, some very intensive.

Also there is a love story too. Lovely one.
Each charactor interwoves together to make a new story and no one were wasted at all.

Luc Besson as a writer only is a fine one for the screen writer for this movie and he did a great job.

If you want something you want to enjoy your evening, this is it. No question asked.
Plus the Unrated version is about 5 minutes added from the theatrical verrsion.",1468627200,,1721,4.181268882175226

I'm not going into the story here, but I will say when a kid who loses her parents at young age, then she has travel alone in order to meet up with a close relative who lives far away in another country, imagine for a little kid this would be very hard to accomplish; and some time later she meets up with him and the family. That very moment you will know the feeling deep inside...very touchy feeling...

Knowing he was about to die, her father gave 'Cataley' (AmandIa Stenberg) a chance for a new future.
she was flown by the authorities to the u.s.a where she flew the nest and saught out her ''gangster' uncle in 'chicago'
She insisted that 'Emillio' (Cliff Curtis) taught her how to use a variety of weapons and defend herself, schooling was secondary to 'Catalley' her motive was of course revenge for the death of her parents.
Fifteen years past, 'Cataley' (Zoe Saidana) was a trained killer and her deadly intent was about to be administered.

4853469,5,B005OK721G,"One of the rare action packed movies that will keep you on your toes from start to finish.  Zoe Saldana is a beautiful and talented actress, but I have never seen her in a film that requires so much physical effort as she shows in this movie.  She is a kind of a cat woman that both men and women will love.  Her performance here is right on the spot..  It is her eyes that show the true emotional side of her: her irreplaceable loss of her parents, her loss of her surrogate family (uncle and her grandmother), the intense care and protection of her lover played by Michael Vartain.  I cannot say I saw Vartain in any movies since his TV series flick almost a decade ago, but he gives admirable performance in this film.

The athleticism of Saldana's character is breathtaking.  Her intensity is so strong one can almost taste it.  And although her body is beautiful, she is not Angelina Jolie type of sex kitten.  Here is the character that speaks volume, just with her eyes.  I thought that this would be easy breezy movie, that will leave me pretty much unaffected shortly after I have seen the film. On the contrary, this film left me thinking about women who are beautiful and smart and know what they want in life whether it is professional career (of a killer) or complete loyalty to the lover who is sexy, kind, talented, sincere and deeply caring.

4853491,4,B005OK721G,"I felt this was an exciting revenge flick in the best sense and a great contribution to the genre. The female lead was incredibly attractive and the casting was perfect. I missed seeing Johnny Trejo as one of the gangsters but even the durable Mr. Trejo needs an occasional vacation. The action is electrifying with a great premise; a young girl witnesses her parents assassination at the hands of drug lords and makes a lifetime commitment to seek revenge. The film has the familiar Luc Besson teacher student relationship scenario with the protagonist requesting her Uncle to train her in the dark arts of the professional assassin, with surprisingly effective results. Much of the situations are contrived for the sake of expedient storytelling and plot development, which is typical in Hollywood films, especially the action and revenge genre, but this movie never fails to deliver excitement, with lots of imaginative cloak and dagger situations, many of them astoundingly grotesque and violent, yet thoroughly satisfying. A must see for fans of the action and revenge genre.",1437523200,,1080,5.177142857142857

4853591,5,B005OK721G,"This is not the first story of its kind. An assassin taking on an organization much bigger than themselves, all for the sake of- vengeance, retribution, revolution? The premise is one that is familiar, though consistently enjoyable.

However, there is a few new elements in 'Columbiana' that I find lacking in other films of its kind. The title character finds herself in a position of desperation, more often than she cares to admit, and in each instance we are allowed to see a genuine, believable response to the situation at hand. The cast of characters supporting and opposing her likewise have a depth that lends to relating them to real people, drawing one into the plot that much more.

In addition, there's an air of practicality about the effects of the film, which doesn't rely as heavily on overpowered explosions that have become commonplace in film (though there are plenty of them as well). Rather than depending on Bond-esque technology to accomplish her goals, we see more low-tech solutions to issues than anything else, hearkening back to her origins.

More than anything else, the theme of this film is not action, is not revenge, is not romance- though all of these play a part. It is consistently a tale of losing, and finding, and losing one's self.

4853617,3,B005OK721G,"THE FILM: COLOMBIANA, while a highly entertaining revenge film with a strong female lead, is let down by cliched storytelling and lack of character development. The story is about Cataleya (Zoe Saldana), a woman whose parents were murdered when she was a child. She then becomes an assassin who sets out to avenge her parents' deaths. As far as the action is concerned, I was pleasantly surprised that Olivier Megaton reined in his tendency to over-shoot and edit. The action sequences were all well put-together and comprehensible, although a final act fight scene in a bathroom kind of dipped back into what I generally don't like about modern action sequences. As far as acting was concerned, nobody gave a bad performance (even the actress who played young Cataleya), but it's a shame that they had such a poor script to work with. The weakest part of this movie, and what really does it in, is the story. The audience is never given a window into who Cataleya is or even care aside from the fact that her parents were murdered in front of her. As an adult, she is emotionally distant and has very little personality. Sure, you could say that it's part of the character but I didn't find it very compelling. There's also the issue of everything in the plot being implausible and convoluted. Again, this is escapist entertainment but a lot of those elements really took me out of the movie. Ultimately, though, I had a decent time. The film is by no means boring, but there are a lot of better ones which tackle similar subject matter, e.g., Luc Besson's Leon, to which this is perhaps too similar.

THE EXTRAS: In the bonus feature department, we are treated to a 25-minute ""Making of"" featurette which has a decent amount of behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the cast and crew about their experiences making the film. What was most interesting to me was how much they tried to delve into the psychology of an assassin despite little of it showing on the screen. Next, there is a 10-minute featurette, ""Cataleya's Journey"" which goes into the character of Cataleya, and what the actresses who played her (Amandla Stenberg and Zoe Saldana) brought to the role. Exclusive to the blu-ray are three featurettes, ""Assassins,"" ""Training a Killer,"" and ""Take the Ride"" that go further into the characters and production. Overall, quite a handsome set of bonus features for such a derivative movie.

OVERALL: It borrows a lot from other, better films, including Luc Besson's own LA FEMME NIKITA and LEON, but the result is still entertaining. There are also plenty of special features to enrich the experience. Recommended for Luc Besson fans and people who enjoy action movies in general.",1413072000,,2697,4.848156182212581

4853625,5,B005OK721G,"Okay, Angelina Jolie may just as well hang it up. We have embraced a new, skinny, gorgeous, female action star! Zo Saldana is ready for her closeup... (Remember her in ""Centerstage"" as a teenage ballet dancer?)

When Luc Besson (""Taken"") writes the screenplay for a movie to be directed by Olivier Megaton (""Transporter 3""), brace yourself for a LOT of action. In my opinion, Besson has created the adult version of Natalie Portman's Leon-trained assassin from ""The Professional."" Saldana is a capable, athletic gal who can deliver the goods, and the Besson/Megaton team can deliver an audience pleaser.

Here's who they work with:
  * Amandla Stenberg (""The Hunger Games"") is perfect as a nine- year-old girl whose parents are killed in Columbia as the film opens. She is the quarry during an exciting chase sequence which starts the action: Leaping off buildings, dashing down alleys, diving into drains... Yup... Parkour... my favorite! This young actress looks like she could grow up to be...
  * Zo Saldana (""Star Trek""), our heroine, orphaned since childhood, an assassin since adulthood, and still seeking revenge for her parents' murder 19 years ago. She is smart, cold-blooded and has nerves of steel. Her vigilantism won't be done till she kills the kingpin.
  * Michael Vartan (""Jolene"") is her lover, an artist who evidently can't afford a razor blade...sigh.
  * Cliff Curtis (""The Last Airbender"") is her uncle who gave her a choice when she fled Bogota to Chicago at age nine: Grab a gun and shoot people, or go to school and be really smart about revenge. Guess which she picked?
  * Lennie James (""The Next Three Days"") is the FBI agent who identifies the mysterious killer behind the deaths of 23 thugs associated with drugs. His biggest problem seems to be the CIA.

This actioner is exciting, Saldana is perfect, and the movie remains carefully PG-13 (three bits of profanity, we don't see any of the bullets splatter blood, and sex scenes fade out as the guy slips off his t-shirt). There is a LOT of gunfire and some really satisfying blowie uppie stuff.

This is entertaining, but be sure to suspend disbelief! I got my DVD from Amazon.",1410912000,8,2159,4.879452054794521

It tells a true reflection of how families can get involved in crime and how they can overcome that and come out victorious.  This movie moves at the pace I like and often kept me and my daughter on edge to see what happens next.

This cuda been a great movie; but, I had to give up half way thru.

Her way of getting into jail with a minimum of pat down was spot on; But,
her hit in the jail was unbelieveable because all grills and light fixtures
are secured with security type screws.  No way she could waltz thru the
air conditioner ducts.  A little research?  Hmmmm...

A comparison was made to Mission Impossible series---NOT THE MOVIE!
Their scenarios were usually so spot on that the Russkies and E. Germans
were paranoid.

I chose to buy ""Columbiana"" because I admired other films that starred Zoe Saldana (notably ""Avatar""); and because I liked the movie ""Taken"" which had the same writer.  Oh, and also because it was a cheap price!  I really enjoyed this film.  It's just enough ""over the top"" to be entertaining, with a strong female lead character that may put you in mind of the likes of Sigourney Weaver in ""Aliens"", to name just one other ""strong female"" lead.  The pacing is perfect, the story kept me interested despite it mostly being a vehicle for ""action"" scenes.

Columbiana just joined that list of GPAFs.  Zoe Saldana as Cataleya is sexy, intense, calculating, cold-blooded but occasionally vulnerable.  All plot holes aside, what's not to love?

4853761,2,B005OK721G,"First off, I want to congratulate Hollywood for having the balls to breach outside their comfortable norm of casting only ""white men"" in action films. The simple fact that Zoe Saldana is a Black Latina was refreshing for me(because i am too)but i would have been able to find it just as relatable if i were just a woman or african american. However when Hollywood dumps people of color of any sex,they often get the leftover scripts and no matter how good the actor is THEY ALWAYS ACT ONE DIMENSIONAL with these types of scripts.

Hollywood hasn't learned that you cant just make a character with no weaknesses. Catalaya even as a child watching her parents die, had no character flaws. While she was motivated by revenge, i would have liked to see emotion that an actual little girl had to witnessing her parents in pools of blood. And Colombians don't play that! They wouldn't have even left any survivors. This isn't the US where everyone gets a fair trial. You may hate the truth,but crime is more lenient in Colombia.

The love interest altogether could have been completely written out! Wasnt sure why sexuality even mattered to the plot if only to further the stereotype that black women are only there for sex. But that's another conversation.

The Spanish used was minimal and campy,for Colombians they spoke alot of freaking English. Most people born or living in Colombia don't speak that much english because they don't have to,it's Colombia.

I love Zoe Saldana. I love that she has become a marketable actress. But she is too thin to come off as convincing as an action star. Avatar was different, as she was playing a 7 foot blue alien. In real life,the guns she used were often bigger than her. And with no known martial arts training she was able to overpower men with a few punches,never showcasing even that she just looked for weaknesses(Like Temperance Breenan from Bones).Im all about Girl Power, but give reasonable explanations for how an 100 lb girl can overpower 200 lb trained killers.

I give this a 2 but I felt it was very generous. It is entertaining,but the angling of the camera made me assume so much of the action sequences took too many takes.

4853786,3,B005OK721G,"This is a revenge plot straight up, so it's not the destination that is important, it's the journey. This is a rough ride.

Here's the scoop. Zoe Saldana, as a young girl, sees her folks gunned down by a crime lord. She high-tails it from Columbia to the U.S. where she hooks up with her uncle, also on the wrong side of the law, where he teaches her how to be a top-notch hitman/woman. She does hits for her uncle while exacting revenge on anyone associated with her parents' killer. An FBI agent enters the fray trying to figure out who is performing these remarkable hits without leaving much in the way in clues.

This is a Luc Besson written and produced flick and I'm surprised at how stupid some of the plot points were. This type of film needs to be clever and this was anything but. When we see her perform her first hit, in a jail no less, so many things happened that simply strained credulity. She has feigned drunkenness and, while supposedly sleeping it off, a guard leaves her a cup of coffee in a ceramic mug with a metal spoon. Maybe they do it like that in France, but in Chicago it's a paper cup and no spoon if there is any coffee at all!  Then she gets into her target's cell where he is asleep and wearing bling so big and heavy it could be used as a lethal weapon. Sorry. The bling stays at the booking desk. And the events that transpire giving the FBI agent the one clue he needs to track her down are so far beyond belief I'm amazed any writer could think he could possibly get away with it. The movie is replete with this sort of nonsense.

As in all Besson projects, this has a slick sheen to it. It's shot and directed well. One hand to hand fight scene in the climax was about as good as anything I've seen. Music, editing and all that stuff are very top shelf. The performances from the key actors were as good as they could be given the script. But that's the problem. This suffered at the script level. This is a diverting watch to be sure, but I'm sorry I didn't stream it. As part of my library it will probably end up in my garage sale.",1356739200,2,2072,4.198492462311558

In that regard, it's a quality product of its kind: a few Mission Impossible kinds of attacks, innocent lover blissfully unaware of her red-handed life, down-around-their-ears ending.

Two things truly stand out in this movie: the two actresses who played the central character, Cataleya. The young girl (Amandla Stenberg) was more than cute. She'll grow up to be a charmer, I'm sure, and did a great job in this role. Zoe Saldana makes this movie, though. She brings Halle Berry to mind, but with more distinctive features and a less conventionally beautiful kind of figure - the kind just made to wear a black catsuit, which she does as if it were invented just for her.

Above all, this is popcorn-worthy entertainment. That gorgeous leading lady just makes it even better.

I want to see more action movies with awesome ladies and I'm giving this a 5 star review. There was one false note however. There was no need to have Saldana mostly naked and/ or in skin tight clothes for most of the movie.

4853802,3,B005OK721G,"""Colombiana"" is a typical case of action flick that starts with the logo of EuropaCorp, a French studio co-founded by Luc Besson. The film, which stars Zoe Saldana (""Avatar"") as a deadly assassin, is yet another Luc Besson's collaboration with writer Robert Mark Kamen, a team that gave us such films as ""The Transporter"" and ""Taken,"" but several elements in the story may remind us of Besson's earlier films like ""Nikita"" and ""L&eacute;on."" (It is reported that ""Colombiana"" was originally conceived as a sequel to ""L&eacute;on,"" which I don't think is a great idea.) What you get instead is ""Colombiana,"" a decent action flick in which Zoe Saldana delivers a strong action-heroine performance, even though the film itself leaves much to be desired.

In ""Colombiana"" Zoe Saldana plays Cataleya, who as a 10-year-old child saw her own parents killed in Bogota, Colombia. Raised by her gangster uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis) in Chicago, Cataleya works for him as a professional assassin, while attempting to track down those who are responsible for her parents' deaths. Cataleya also falls in love with a man named Danny (Michael Vartan), who doesn't know Cataleya's true identity.

""Colombiana"" is directed by Olivier Megaton, known for ""Transporter 3,"" the weakest entry in the Jason Statham franchise. I admit the film's action sequences of ""Colombiana"" are not bad, especially in the film's opening section, though they are undermined by the director's hectic camerawork and editing. Zoe Saldana did a great job as an efficient killer whose MO includes several unique items, but most supporting players are wasted in forgettable roles, with an exception of Amandla Stenberg, who played a 10-year-old Cat very effectively.

""Colombiana"" is a slick B action thriller with talented Zoe Saldana.",1346457600,2,1792,5.258741258741258

4853808,1,B005OK721G,"I'd just like to start this review off by saying that this movie is putrid. She has the brains of Eisenhower and the stealth tactics of Shinobi, which makes her unstoppable from beginning to end. After seeing her parents killed as a little girl she seeks revenge on some mobb and she doesn't stop until that is accomplished. She tells her Uncle at a young that she wants to be killer, he then shoots and kills an innocent driver, kneels down to her asks if that's the life that she chooses, hears the ambulances nearing the scene, and then walks off without anyone screaming ""Hey that's the killer."" When she is all grown she came up with this brilliant idea to fake like she is drunk and runs head on into a cop car and then goes to jail. She gets to jail with no idea and they charge her with a DUI which she was never tested for (and she was never even drunk in the first place, but faked it...somehow) and they lock her in a cell. She infiltrates and booby traps the entire jail as she follows through on a plotted murder of a mobb member as she slips through vents and some phony close-call death experiences without even being seen! She kills the guy and makes it back to her cell just in time to throw her prostitute outfit back on and pretend like she's sleeping. She shot through a bullet proof window, evaded the entire Swat Team who the drop on her, black-maled the Swat Team head honchos, and predicted at the end of the movie that the guy she was chasing was going to drive a particular van and decided to stick 2 Rottweilers behind the driver's seat, knew that he would call and brag about his narrow escape, and simply says ""Eat"" and the 2 dogs eat him alive.

Dumb movie! Please don't watch it if you do not want to laugh.",1341964800,3,1738,4.282674772036474
4853809,1,B005OK721G,"This film is unconvincing and unbelievable. If you like to watch a pretty girl, then go right ahead. Your heroine is presented as invincible, right out of the gate. There is no learning curve, no set of challenges for her to overcome...and thus no suspense whatsoever. Mostly she just wriggles around, getting in and out of places where she's not supposed to be. Action fans, take note: there isn't a real fight scene until the final 15 minutes, and it's nothing worth waiting around for. But Zoe always manages to look good, and that's the whole point of a vanity picture.

Then there's the abysmal plot. Zoe plays a young woman who lost her family, when she was a girl. All grown up now - with some training from a family relation - she wants revenge. But while she's told to be a smart assassin, she ""signs"" every victim, which should make her easy to find. Could bad things happen to good people around her, because of this? Sure. Thus, through her own stupidity, Zoe's character creates another reason to exact revenge. But since every other character in the film is clueless, too, this takes some time - 20 bodies - yet it's as inevitable as every other predictable detail here. What's more, there was apparently no money left for casting. So we get Michael Vartan, completely miscast and unlikely as the artist/boyfriend. There's zero chemistry there. Perhaps the whole thing should be viewed as an absurdist take on the revenge picture. But don't take my word for it: check out the rottentomatoes website, and you'll see that only 27% of the pro reviewers liked it, and only 53% of audiences. The 4 and 5 star reviews I see on Amazon just don't line up with reality. There are some great female revenge flicks out there -- Hanna and Haywire are two. And don't forget Death Proof. Of course, serious action and fighting girl fans will go back to La Femme Nikita. Check all these great films out, and leave this unconvincing nonsense behind.

Incidentally, there are other reviewers here who seem to love this film. Their main protest against more critical commentary is ""This is just a movie! It's not a documentary."" This is flawed reasoning. I would challenge these reviewers to start thinking about what they're watching. Directors have roughly two hours to present a coherent, original piece of moviemaking - a clear time, place, perspective and cast which all function cohesively. Their success can be judged by how satisfied we are with the final product. Colombiana is neither original nor satisfying, on several levels.

I can't let other people's opinions be my opinion.  I decided to watch this movie, and I thought it was absolutely excellent from beginning to end.  When I watch movies like this, I expect the unexpected.  I got it here.  I expect uniquely thought out scenes.  It was in there.  This movie just wasn't in your face blow up everything all the time.  It was emotional.  It was mean.  It was smart.

I have to say my favorite scene is when Colombiana was running from the bad guys.  It was a great scene to watch.  A little girl isn't supposed to win in the real world against drug goons, but she did in this movie.  She won and got away.

Movies like these are meant to pull you away from boring reality.  For the most part, most of us live normal uneventful lives, and Colombiana splashed an imaginative story of an assassin in your face.  I appreciate it for what it was trying to do.  Of course, some of the things, I will was like 'no way', but I had to remember it is just a movie.  Now and days, you can fly like superman in a movie, and you have to realize that's all it is.

A hit squad is dispatched to eliminate the guy and his family.  The parents know the hit squad is en route--in fact, they spot them outside!--yet make NO effort to hide their 11-year-old daughter Cataleya as they approach. (Perhaps the real reason this couple was marked for death is because this drug kingpin realized this couple has crappy parenting skills.) Husband and wife are shot multiple times in front of the child.  Faster than you can say ""Bruce Wayne,"" she vows then & there to avenge her parents' murder and escapes. But Bruce Wayne trained for years and years in almost every physical discipline imaginable before he became Batman, THIS little girl has the moves of Daredevil and Angelina Jolie's Ms. Salt at the age of eleven, jumping from rooftop to rooftop to street, evading a crew of what must be between four and eight fully grown, heavily armed, presumably professional hitmen. (Cripes, what did they feed this kid?!?) We even see this child move a MANHOLE COVER like it's a pizza! (Gad, those things are heavy, really!) Then, from an unlikely confluence of events, Cataleya -- who is so special she reads Xena comic books YEARS before the hit TV show makes the airwaves, according to the film's timeline -- makes her way from Columbia to Miami to Chicago (most bus companies will let a pre-teen girl buy a ticket sans adult supervision), where she hooks up with her gangster uncle.  Uncle Thug, like all concerned relatives, honors his niece's burning desire to be trained as an assassin, provided she attends school regularly and kills the Kardashian sisters after turning 21. (OK, I made-up that last bit.)

That was the prologue -- cut to the present, where the child has grown up to be Zoe Saldana. Ms. Saldana is indeed lovely, but let's be vaguely semi-real here. She looks like she weighs 94 pounds! She kicks an enormous amount of big-guy hiney and wields weapons that are almost as big as she is! Cagefighter-turned-actress Gina Carano, star of the recent Haywire, is a truly muscular lady -- you can believe that she can clean any guy's clock, punch his ticket, fix his wagon, and rotate his tires. Saldana looks like a stick figure...a very pretty stick figure I'll admit, but a stick figure nonetheless. Steve Buscemi could take her in a fight, and Buffy the V-Slayer could have her for breakfast. (I wouldn't bet the rent, but I think a MALE stunt-double was used in one fight scene).

But wait, it gets better. [spoiler] I know this is an action film, not a documentary, but Starsky & Hutch feels more ""real"" than this movie. Early on, Cataleya gets herself arrested intentionally by pretending to be drunk and plowing her car into a police car. After she's arrested, the police don't give her a breathalyzer test, don't take her mugshot, and (best of all) don't take the hairpin in her, uh, hair with which she uses to unlock her cell door with ease!  (Do the CIA and NSA know of the awesome power of the pin, for MacGyver's sake?) [insert Andy Rooney voice here] Ever notice that in action movies ladies (and occasionally men) can run BAREfoot into sewers and over an assortment of rubble without stepping on something injurious?

I like action movies as much as the next fellow, but I like some actual acting and characters (they're as generic as they come here) with my explosions and gunshots. Worst of all, there's NOTHING here that hasn't been done lots better before -- even the American La Femme Nikita remake Point of No Return is better than this. Stick to science fiction, Zoe.",1339027200,7,3858,4.6982248520710055

This latest film from the writers of Takenand the writer of The Karate Kid (1984), The Karate Kid Part II and The Karate Kid Part III is one slam-bang action thriller that never lets up for a moment. Zoe Saldana (Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl) stars as Cataleya, a young woman hell-bent on avenging the murder of her parents 15 years earlier. From ominious beginning to the heart-pounding finale, the suspense never lets up. Ms. Saldana is an excellent actress, apart from being incredibly sexy and you know this is one woman you don't ever want to cross. There is some infrequent moderate cursing, and only late in the movie, two strong profanities (for me, the last strong one is unfortunate, as God's name is paired with a mild curse word, thereby making it a strong profanity). Aside from the strong profanity I just detailed, I really enjoyed the movie, and recommend it. More plot and character development would have been nice, too.

4853831,3,B005OK721G,"There was a time when revenge films played in drive ins across the country. Low budget efforts that made stars of actors like Charles Bronson and Jan Michael Vincent were hits and led them to bigger and better things. These films were so successful that major studios began making them as well. COLUMBIANA shows that they continue to do so.

In 1992, nine year old Catalyea witnesses the murder of her mother and father in Bogot, Columbia. Her father did the killing for a cartel leader and although they swear allegiance, neither actually trust one another. Questioned by the leader of the killers, Cataleya she sticks a knife through his hand and then runs off using a plan her father gave her. Once in the states she finds her way to her uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis) and tells him she wants to be trained as a killer.

Fast forward 12 years and we now see Cataleya all grown up in the form of actress Zoe Saldana. Pretending to be a drunk driver she gets herself arrested and locked up for the night. In reality she's stone cold sober and using the arrest as a ruse to get close to a special prisoner. Using methods taught to her over the years, she escapes her cell, kills the prisoner and returns to her cell before anyone is suspicious. The next morning she leaves before the jail is locked down.

Cataleya has fulfilled her destiny and desire to become a leading contract killer. Her one flaw is that she leaves a drawing of a cataleya, an orchid, on each of her victims. She's done so in hopes that it will draw out Don Luis, the man who had her father killed. The killings so far have paid her well and provided her with experience. Now she wants to use it for the promise she made at age nine.

Small subplots are found as well. Cataleya has a lover, an artist named Danny (Michael Vartan) she shares a bed with but no information. To be close to someone would present the possibility of dividing her attention or possibly losing them. We also have a determined FBI agent named Ross (Lennie James) who is closing in on this mystery killer they call the Tag killer due to her artwork on the victims.

Cataleya takes on one more job before the police finally discuss her tags with the press and force Don Luis out of hiding. Taken in as an informant by the CIA, he's in New Orleans under their care, still running his drug business on the side. When he discovers who this killer is he sends his men to wipe her and any family members out. But to do so will do nothing more than make her motivation stronger than ever.

COLOMBIANA was hyped as being from the same people who made TAKEN. While there are connections the film isn't nearly as good. Yes, it provides plenty of action, violence and explosions but the story isn't quite as interesting.

Zoe Saldana in the lead shows that she can act and do so well enough to take the lead in a major motion picture. Each role she's taken in the past has led her this direction and now one could say she's achieved the status of star enough that she can carry a film on her own.

All that said I find this movie more in the so-so category, a movie that provides the basics of what is expected in an action film these days but never quite makes it one that you'll want to watch over and over again. It includes all of the traits of the genre but never quite pulls you in in the same way TAKEN did. If you're going to tout the connection between one movie and another you'd better make sure it's as good if not better.

But it does offer a nice evening's entertainment when the comparison is tossed aside. Perhaps those in charge of advertising would do better next time not to compare one movie to another. In doing so a decent movie would seem better on its own. COLUMBIANA is a decent action flick, but when compared to others it loses a few points.",1332201600,3,3800,4.3559322033898304

4853835,4,B005OK721G,"The seriously annoying trailer (""Never forget where you came from."") almost kept me from watching this film. But I consider Zoe Saldana to be a must-see performer, and so I caved. And, as it turns out, COLOMBIANA is nowhere near as funky as that lame trailer made it out to be. Zoe Saldana brings out the sultry and submits a strong acting performance. If only the script hadn't undercut her. COLOMBIANA can't seem to make up its mind on whether it's more an action film or a dramatic one. No, we don't quite get a seamless blend of the two genres.

Child actress Amandla Stenberg, with her stillness and poise and haunting silences, deserves all manner of props. She carries the first half hour of the movie, and you can't take your eyes off her. Stenberg plays Cataleya, a 9-year-old girl in gang-infested Bogota whose parents are shot up to bits in front of her.

Fifteen years later, an FBI profiler (Lennie James, always good) is obsessed with nabbing an assassin who's committed 22 gaudy murders within the past four years, never mind that each of the assassin's targets is a ""professional bad apple."" The FBI agent knows it's the same killer because he always marks his victims with an image of a Colombian orchid. Later he learns that the flower is called a ""cataleya."" Connect now your own dots.

If I hadn't seen Gina Carano in bonecrunching action in HAYWIRE, I'd be even more rhapsodic over Zoe Saldana's action hero creds. As it is, Saldana evolves from her badasss role in THE LOSERS. Thrust that much more in the spotlight, she easily carries the bits of the film that Amandla Stenberg doesn't carry. The similarity between the two actresses is remarkable. So credit Zoe for capturing Amandla's sense of gravity about herself, and also that quiet fierceness. For her part, Zoe combines her dramatic skills - her Cataleya looks so desolate at times - with a dynamic and, frankly, very sexy physicality. I like that the grown-up Cataleya - and, yes, she grew up to be a professional assassin - is calculating and meticulous. She plans her contract hits. She carries out her plans flawlessly. But the closer she gets to her ultimate target - him what ordered the hit on her parents - she allows her emotions to get to her. She becomes sloppy. It costs her.

Michael Vartan, by the way, serves as Saldana's love interest. It's almost not worth mentioning this.

COLOMBIANA is style over substance, despite Saldana's powerhouse presence. The problem lies with several over-the-top moments, those inane flourishes which ultimately undermine the strong acting. There are two particularly egregious scenes. Early on, 9-year-old Cataleya's gangster tio, to prove some sort of point, takes out his gun in broad daylight, in front of an elementary school, and shoots off a round which sends a passing car careening into a halt. As police sirens wail, the tio delivers his lecture - something about education as a building block for all assassins-in-training - and then they just casually stroll away, with apparently no one having seen the guy firing his weapon. This is an absurd scene. The other laying-it-on-thick sequence involves pet sharks in a baddie's pool. One glance at that, and you just know Cataleya will be incorporating the sharks in one of her kills. When the payoff arrives, it happens as a quick one and done camera shot. It's a death dealt too quickly, and, gorehound that I am, I felt cheated.

Zoe Saldana in graceful action is why I tuned in. If she has a calling card as a mighty arsekicker, it's that one brutal hand-to-hand combat scene late in the movie in which Saldana transforms a towel and three toothbrushes into deadly weapons. It's almost as good a sequence as Cataleya's layered infiltration of a police precinct. Providing you can overlook the film's silly excesses, you may find yourself immersed in COLOMBIANA. Saldana is terrific.

Just remember: ""Never forget where you came from.""

3.5 out of 5 stars.

A few interesting, somewhat creative assassinations, even though I've seen better.  The blood and gore is a little lacking, not to mention the absence of nudity, limits the impact a bit.

4853851,1,B005OK721G,"At first I was going to give it two stars, but after thinking about it some more, I just couldn't bring myself to do it and downgraded it even more.  As someone else wrote in another review - to the director whether something makes sense is completely irrelevant and unimportant in a movie.

First of all, I am Colombian and I have been in Colombia many times.  Sure there are ghettos like that, just like there are some here in the US so let me say one thing and maybe you can see where my view was ""corrected"".  The early scenes are filled with gun battles in these bad neighborhoods.  No cops show up and people just run through the city shooting and chasing with everyone just looking on or barely paying attention before going back to their TVs.  At first I though - hey, they are really doing a hatchet job on Colombia.  Even in the ghetto - you start a gun battle and the authorities will show up and NOT the police but the Army instead.  They don't have laws against the Army being involved in civil matters like we do here.  And the army is very well armed and trained for such events.  So like I said, at first I thought that this guy knows NOTHING about Colombia and he is just ignorant (which he is) but then soon after we end up in Chicago.

Well, another scene occurs there and then I get it.  This director is just a total imbecil.  Another scene with shots ringing out, the police in this case DO show up but of course this guy and the little girl just walk away without any of the 50 onlookers pointing at them for the police to do anything.  The movie was just filled with garbage like that.  Yeah sure, in a US jail you can get around from room to room through the ventilation system.  Just open a vent in a cell and get almost anywhere you want to go.  Sure, enter a cell and have hair pins and stuff like that to pick a lock, because when you get arrested they don't take EVERYTHING away from you - minus your clothes because picking a lock with a hairpin is something the police have NEVER thought about themselves.

Firing a high powered rifle from a building without being found out.  An Uzi 9mm that fires bullets as if they were from a 50 cal machinegun.  It just goes on and on.  What is the point about talking how stealthy she is when.... well, remember the Monty Python movies where the knight is seen in the distance and he keeps running towards the two guards - when finally he comes out of NOWHERE to kill them both.  It is JUST like that.  Sure, it is funny in a comedy - but this is not meant to be a comedy.  Yet when you use that type of stealthy maneuvering or camera cutaway scenes, it is just plain stupid.  If you are going to talk English then please don't do it with a stupid accent.  Either speak Spanish in the native tongue or speak English fluently please rather to than giving them some kind of stupid accent to make you think they are speaking Spanish.

RPGs don't create fire like that either - that is not what they are designed for.  Why did she enter the shark tank in the first place? She got everywhere else she wanted to go by walking alongside walls, through vents, and sewer lines - how did she get into the pool in the first place?  Oh - for a cool effect! Being illogical isn't cool, it just takes you out of the fantasy of the movie.  Someone else mentioned in another review that women don't do all of that - shoot so many people without herself getting shot to pieces.  Well, to be fair NO man does that either without becoming Swiss cheese.  I am willing to give an action movie certain leeway (just like I would give any movie) when it comes to suspeding logic - but this goes WAY too far.",1327536000,14,3654,4.220461095100864

4853861,4,B005OK721G,"This is an action packed film with a female heroine of sorts. It starts in Bogota, Colombia in 1992. Cataleya Restrepo aged ten (Amandla Stenberg) is a young school girl, whose father is mixed up in the sort of things that one would not declare on a tax return. He is forced to conclude a `business deal' that is not to his liking - he realises that he needs to put some distance betwixt him and the inevitable trouble that is to follow. He fails and both he and his wife are killed more or less in front of Cataleya. However, he has given her a sim card an address in Chicago and told to go to the US Embassy.

This then kicks off the action, involving some excellent street running and edge of seat stuff. Need lees to say she makes it to the US and to Chicago, where she contacts her uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis). He begins her education and takes her into the family. The film moves on fifteen years to the now grown woman who is now Zoe Saldana and it must be said, to use the common vernacular - is `well fit'. She is now an assassin, but one with her own agenda and that is the avenging of her parents murders.

She also lives a double life, has a seemingly pure sex relationship with an artist and could teach `The Dog Whisperer' a thing or two about attack mutts. We have intrigue with the CIA, the Chicago PD being inept but dogged and basically a full throttle action fest. There are plot holes, but this is one of those films where you can forgive them as they are done in the name of entertainment as opposed to being just sloppy.  It is from the pen (Screenplay) of Luc Besson (Leon, Taken and The Fifth Element) so you would expect a fair bit of polish. The direction from Olivier Megaton (I do hope that is his real name) is well above par and it does ooze style. The only places it falls down are the aforementioned holes, and it would be a plot spoiler to mention them. Everyone puts in great performances so not a lot not to like. If you want 107 minutes of action with more than enough plot twists to maintain your interest then you really can not go wrong.",1327104000,,2076,4.211055276381909

s totally my type and probably top 3 best looking actress today if not the hottest. But to my suprise this film was packed with action, skill, a decent storyline and plot. There were a few guys who could have done a better job acting and would have been cool to see some people survive but like i said before I was very suprisingly happy with the outcome of this movie in general. I gave it 5 stars because i feel it's not just another dumb movie with an incredibly hot actress. It's actually an amazing movie with an amazing actress who is beautiful, gorgeous, a TEN.

While watching it I kept thinking of what a great video game it would be as well. In the vain of Tomb Raider. It's fast paced, it looks good and it's just edgy enough to keep you watching.

I do not like to tell much about a movie, but I will say that Amandla Stenberg in the beginning of the movie did an excellent job, it was an enjoyable action packed movie.",1326585600,,423,3.9529411764705884
4853869,5,B005OK721G,"So I wanted to see this movie in theaters but I missed it, but I managed to get it outta the Red Box and man am I glad I did!

This is the classic story of the offspring of a killer that tried to get out of the game.  The little girl's father is killed by his former boss or partner, (I really can't remember which, my bad).  And the little girl witnesses it and she manages to get away and swears revenge.

Throughout the movie she kills many people who are thieves, criminals, drug dealers, etc. in order to draw out the guy who killed her parents.  She finally manages to find where he is hiding and she decides to take off the kid gloves.  No more sneaking around, being stealthy, she breaks out the big guns and goes in with guns blazing and she cuts a bloody swath of destruction through the guy's fortress and takes him out.

I really can't think of anything wrong with this movie or anything that I would change if I had the chance to remake it myself.  So if you like action, you've gotta check this one out!",1326585600,3,1017,4.153061224489796
4853870,3,B005OK721G,"How do I rate this thing???

Pros
-Exciting - definitely action filled.
-Saldana is physically built perfectly for this character.
-The scenic shots are great in my opinion, even though the shots are from Mexico, France and the U.S.

Cons
-Everyone speaks English, when its clear they should be speaking Spanish
-The plot is so ridiculous you comment out loud things like ""OH COME ON...REALLY?""
-Saldana isn't given enough to work with script wise. They clearly wanted sexy shots, not oscar winning acting

Some movies are so bad, you have to walk out/stop the dvd player before it's over. This is not one of them. You'll be able to stay until the end with no problem, but you'll be thinking ""THIS IS SO BAD"" the whole way. If you want to stay in on a cold winter night, order a pizza and rent a dvd with friends, this is the movie.

4853871,3,B005OK721G,"Living a happy, normal life, a ten year-old girl named Cataleya (played as an adult by Zoe Saldana) narrowly escapes execution at the hands of the same men who'd already murdered her parents. After escaping, she goes on an epic (at least for a ten year-old traveling alone) journey. Finally ending at her uncle's home in America. Her uncle asks the young girl what she wishes to be when she grows up and she says an assassin. After initially trying to dissuade her from this course of action, he offers instruction.

  There's nothing earth-shattering here. There's barely a narrative here. It's basically the human equivalent of two trains colliding on a track at full-speed. I admit, I enjoyed it. Having said that, it's a popcorn movie, or it would be if I still ate popcorn. Action sequences, fight sequences, and explosions. If that's not your thing, skip this one.

Obviously, she grows up and fifteen years after her horrible experience, she sets upon an incredible journey of pure payback.  The movie keeps moving - you won't doze through this one! Incredible acting and photography packs a one-two punch that will keep your attention throughout Colombiana's 108 minute run time.

4853876,3,B005OK721G,This film produced by Luc Besson is a throwback to LA FEMME NIKITA and LEON THE PROFESSIONAL with influences from De Palma's MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE and SCARFACE. Visually this film is close to the slick flash visuals of Tony Scott films such as MAN ON FIRE. The relationship between Zoe Saldana and her painter boyfriend is similiar to Nikita's boyfriend in LA FEMME NIKITA. The early scenes with a young Zoe seeing her parents murdered is straight out of LEON. My favourite set-piece was the early prison assassination sequence as Zoe manouevre's herself through the air-conditioning shaft which was reminiscent of Tom Cruise manouevering through the shaft in the CIA building in MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE. The way Zoe assassinates the target in prison and works her way back to her prison cell without anyone realising is reminiscent of good/quality spy and assassin films. The climax of the film where Zoe infiltrated the cartels mansion for a full-blown shoot-out and killing of the head of the cartel is classic SCARFACE. It's not as great as LA FEMME NIKITA and LEON but has inspired set-pieces and Zoe Saldana handles the fights and over-the-top weaponry with great convincing skill. One can believe Zoe to be a ruthless and nameless assassin out for revenge.,1326326400,2,1255,5.097087378640777

4853879,2,B005OK721G,"I held out as long as I could but was forced to watch this anticipated mess by my teenage son.  Even he didn't like it.  Sure, Zoe Saldana is easy on the eyes and she comes pretty close to being nekked, but really?  I had a hard time buying this lithe young woman of about 90 pounds being able to take out swarms of bad guys.  She does it mostly with guns and other explosive weapons, a couple of which are bigger than she is.  Anyway, Cataleya (Saldana) is named after a type of orchid.  She manages to find time to leave a signature of this at each of her professional kills.

As a girl of about 10, she sees her parents gunned down in Columbia by the head of a local cartel.  She escapes the killing, not by getting away quickly, but by waiting at the kitchen table until the cartel squad leader comes in and tries to negotiate with her instead of shooting her.  Now she decides to escape, but not without stabbing him in the hand.  The girl then dodges all of the acrobatic goons in a series of parkour rooftop chases.  The girl manages to get to the American Embassy in Bogot and trades a microchip for safe passage to Miami.  Once in Miami, she escapes her handler and gets to Chicago somehow to find her uncle.  Yeah, I know.  Uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis) is a mob enforcer.  Young Cat (Amandia Stenberg) wants to be a trained killer.  Uncle Emilio wants her to go to school first, and then become a killer.  To prove his prowess as a killer himself, he demonstrates outside the school.  As a Lincoln Towncar comes cruising down the street, Emilio pulls out his trusty .45 and shoots at the car which careens into a fire hydrant.

As a grownup we see Cataleya plow into a police car at about 50 mph, pretending to be a drunk driver.  This so she can be arrested and placed in the same jail that will soon contain one of the guys responsible for her parents death.  My head is starting to hurt now.  Director Olivier Megaton, no stranger to bad movies (""Transporter 3""), empties the budget and explosive warehouse in the final act which is just as ludicrous as the entire film.

The Blu ray transfer looks terrific.  Much of the film was shot on location in Mexico (subbing for Columbia), Chicago and New Orleans.  The DTS-HD surround is excellent.  When all hell breaks loose, the surrounds and sub snap to attention.",1326326400,7,2323,4.381733021077284

The action is well paced and it does not use the blood all in your face to show it. The means to her targets are well designed and not just a run and gun approach to the killing.

You could see though out the movie how she tried to live seprate lives kepping her killing out of the what she was trying to make as a private life. And of course you see what happens when the two hit a merge.

The lead had one mission and she held that mission as her driving force even as she battled to justify it with her family.

I am sure some will not agree with me but you have to say this movie beats Hanna hands down this movie made Hanna look like some high school project. No this movie will not win Oscars but if it could be done a follow up would be welcomed.

With Jason Bourne level of over-the-top fighting, it's a fun ride. If you are looking for deep emotional connection, well, look somewhere else. Like many of these movies, I really want to meet the HVAC contractors who put up these super-strong air ducts, that don't flex/collapse and make no noise when moving inside of them... Zoe Saldana is stunning to look at, and makes a compelling action star.

The movie opens with her child-version actress who does a great parkuor through the favela of Bogata, which is well filmed, and like a child (running in a school-girl outfit no less) she does not possess crazy skills which would make this more comic-book-like as in Chloe Moretz (who stole that movie BTW) in Kick-Ass, and instead more believable as a child with serious skills who will grow up to be a serious assassin. The adult version uses all sorts of creative attacks from full frontal assault to human-engineering attacks to get on the inside; and yes, stuff blows up! And watching her slink around in a catsuit is not a hardship either.

4853884,4,B005OK721G,"Young 10 year old Cataleya witnesses the murder of her father and mother at the hands of a vicious drug cartel leader and his assassins.  The murder was caused by her father's wish to leave the cartel and start a new life with his family.  Before her father is murdered he gives his young daughter a memory chip and tells her where to go in case something happens and to give the man the chip and tell him that it is her passport.

Cataleya (A name for a local Columbian orchid) escapes by attacking the man who helped kill her family and winds up in Chicago living with her uncle and his mom.  He is a ruthless criminal also and she tells him that she wants to grow up to be a professional killer.  He teaches her that anyone can be a killer and stupid and get caught but she must go to school, learn, be trained and become the best to be able to always get away.

Thus starts the saga of Cataleya's life and her goal to find and avenge her family's murder by killing the men who did it.  Zoe Saldana plays the sultry and beautiful woman who becomes a mass murderer to achieve her goal.  The movie features a lot of fast action and her methods of getting to her untouchable enemies are reminiscent of ""Mission Impossible"" type of assassinations.  Several of the escape scenes are fun to watch!

This is a fast paced shoot-em-up movie and you will enjoy it if that is what you like.  I gave it 4 Stars based on that fact.  The script and dialog at times are lacking and the movie counts on the beauty of its lead actress to carry the show.

""Colombiana"" was pure genius. Catelaya was an incredible character, and Zoe Saladana did an amazing job acting wise, and action wise. I don't think there was one part of the movie that was slow, maybe the introduction that took maybe 4 minutes tops before the action kicks in.

4853894,5,B005OK721G,"This movie was just the ticket.  It was, first and foremost: entertaining,next the plot was very intriguing, watching a clever little girl turn into a very clever & capable, reaper. Having her world brutally torn away from her at such a tender age, in such a cold blooded manner, causes her to be obsessed with a sense of revenge.

And she carries out that revenge, with a cold-blooded-calculated, precision that grips you as you enter the fray with ""Catalaya.""

Here is a strong character played by a strong young actress, ""Zoe Saldana""  with the skills to make you believe you're right there; when she has her throw down death match, with the personal bodyguard of the well protected, man who ordered the killing of her mother and father, you're right there, struggling with her, hoping you don't run out of breathe before you can kill this maggot.

We start Catalaya's adult life with her, when she totally destroys a Vintage-Red-Ford Mustang, by running into the side of police car.  All that, just to go to jail and dispatch a target she's picked up, as a contract Hit.

Its a thrill ride, full of adrenaline-pumping...pulse-pounding-moments, where you'll forget to breath. This is excitement to good to miss.  From the beginning to the very end, you will be drawn into this movie.

Zoe is Hottt, and the action is sexyyy, you'll get more than your money's worth.

4853902,5,B005OK721G,"LOVE IT. LOVED IT. LOVED IT.

Sometimes there's nothing like a good old fashioned kick-a$$ movie. New Year's Eve qualifies for one of those times.

We've been trying to rent ColombianA from Blockbuster since it hit the rental racks a few weeks ago. Checking daily, it was never available. Finally rented from DIRECTV. Well worth the wait and the additional cost.

Zoe Saldana's character was agile and witty with the right amount of stone cold-blooded female bad-a$$ness. Five stars. The story held my interest and while the plot was predictable the action kept momentum building.

Four favorite scenes: (1) The little girl running thru the streets of Columbia. Lots of fun with a clever escape. (2) Adult Katalaya fighting with two tooth brushes. Hahaha. Loved it. (3) Byplay between her boyfriend's BBF and his sister-in-law. ""He's going to thank me later."" HAHAHAHA. ""What's she doing at my computer?"" LOL. (4) The bomb she planted under the detective's chair. She told him not to get up before the microwave timer went off, but he hopped up a few seconds before in case the bomb blew he wouldn't lose his butt. HAHAHA. Good one.

Two least favorite scenes: (1) The uncle shooting innocent people in front of the school just to show little Katalaya he could teach her to kill. Outlandish and callas for a character I wanted to like. (2) Killer Katalaya is smart, but not smart enough to protect her family (uncle & surrogate mother). Her lack of forethought and concern for their welfare tainted my ability to fully pull for her especially after her uncle pointed out her blind spot.

While the story had a few holes I didn't care. ColombianA wasn't about crossing every T or dotting every I. Can't wait for the sequel. Just like the Transporter franchise, the character and Ms. Saldana can only get more intriguing.",1325376000,3,1819,4.832797427652733

She ends up in Chicago where she is raised by her uncle. ""I want to be a warrior-princess,"" she says. She wants to be a killer.

We flash forward to her adulthood. Zoe has become a killer and she leaves a calling card by drawing a rare orchid on the victim, a sign of her family. Her goal, to the dismay of her uncle, is to draw out the man who killed her parents...who has the backing of the CIA.

Lennie James plays Ross, a sharp FBI investigator, who is in charge of finding the the rare orchid killer.

Zoe's ability reminded me a bit of Jolie in ""Salt."" While Zoe is leggy and sexy, don't get you hopes up, as the camera angel remains pure while she showers and changes. I found the action scenes to be 5 stars. The scenes with Lennie James were also excellent. The filler drama material of Zoe's life outside of the action scenes was not well scripted and I lost interest waiting for something to happen.

Eventually the plot and subplot comes together in a most entertaining way as we find out that Zoe knows how to take charge.

4853910,2,B005OK721G,"Thanks to Luc Besson, the action movie claims some serious cachet in film critic circles. Inventive, soulful and insanely violent, Besson's films (""Taken,"" ""Leon: The Professional"") routinely dazzle with their savage poetry.

And then there's ""Colombiana,"" essentially a pale retread of his breakout film, ""La Femme Nikita."" In the hands of the hyperbolically named Olivier Megaton, whatever merit may have been in Besson's screenplay flounders in an illogical, poorly executed mess. ""Colombiana"" attempts to tell the story of Cataleya Restrepo (played as an adult by ""Avatar's"" Zoe Saldana), who sees her loving, selfless parents murdered before her young eyes in Bogota. That her saint-like father was a high-ranking cartel member is glossed over. Deep down, he was really a good guy.

A foolish henchman (Jordi Malla) fails to kill Cataleya, and she escapes a score of bad guys to get to the U.S. Embassy, which whisks her to America thanks to the cartel-intel she literally coughs up. Upon arrival, Cataleya outwits the entire American intelligence apparatus and reunites with her extended family in Chicago.

Logic, already strained beyond limit, now takes an official siesta. Even though he's grieving of the murder of his gangbanging son, Cataleya's uncle smoothly agrees to train her as an assassin (something which he forgets later on when he says, ""I never wanted this life for you""). To help her think like a killer, he enrolls her in ... prep school. This must be one unusual institution, as Cataleya grows up to be a lethal assassin, gifted with a preternatural ability to predict the movements of unseen police and security guards down to the microsecond.

Long story short, there is only one reason to watch this movie, and it's Zoe Saldana. As lithe as a gymnast and as gorgeous as a supermodel, she's downright enchanting. ""Colombiana's"" best scenes show her smoothly gliding in and out of air vents and around bumbling cops. She moves with such grace and purpose that you truly believe she is a master killer.

Due to a wooden script, Saldana is forced to convey all the pain and anguish of a child avenging the murder of her parents with her eyes rather than any great dialogue. Megaton surrounds Cataleya with cardboard characters and clich&eacute;d scenes. Her artist boyfriend (Michael Vartan) has the depth of shelf paper, and the villains are even lighter weight. The brilliant FBI agent (Lennie James) tracking Cataleya cannot figure out what kind of flower she draws on her victims, but a janitor identifies it in two seconds. Perhaps the worst sin Megaton commits comes in a late action piece where Cataleya goes fist-to-fist with a top villain. The action scene is so poorly staged and spliced that the thrill meter drops to zero when it should be at eleven.

Saldana has the ""it"" to be a great action star. But with another forgettable project like this she might actually be in some real danger. The ""Colombiana"" DVD includes two making-of documentaries of negligible interest.

4853912,1,B005OK721G,"A handful of French filmmaker Luc Besson's most famous films betray his penchant for femmes fatale, titles like La Femme Nikita, The Fifth Element, The Messenger, and, to an extent, Leon: The Professional. With Colombiana, which Besson wrote and produced, he returns to the genre with the help of director Olivier Megaton, and the result is uneven. Zoe Saldana plays a Colombian woman whose family was murdered by mobsters when she was young. Now, as a grown woman and a ruthless assassin, she sets out on a path for revenge. If the plot sounds familiar, it's probably because the premise is sort of a staple of the revenge thriller, and though Saldana gives the performance her all, there just isn't enough to set Colombiana apart. The movie not only fails to make an impression, but also suffers from erratic and sloppy filmmaking; it'll probably leave you unsatisfied, but if you've liked any of Besson's and Megaton's recent work, you may still find something to enjoy here.",1325116800,7,978,4.897590361445783

Usually Beeson's scripts are smart, clever, and witty despite the gore. This time the cake fell. Perhaps the sludge is due to director Olivier Megaton's obsession with jumping out of windows and gory assassinations that prevents this film from taking flight because he certainly has a cast that could have given him much more.

!0 year old Cataleya (Amandla Stenberg) witnesses her parents deaths by the ruling mob in Bogata Colombia in 1992 and is aided in escape to the USA by unique means where she is adopted by the Restrepos (Cliff Curtis). Instead of school Cataleya wants to become a killer to avenge her patents murder: Restrepo bargains with her - school first then he will teach her how to kill.  Jump 15 years and Cataleya (Zoe Saldana) is a full blown assassin, working as a hitwoman as a day job and seeking out her parents killers by night.  Through a series of +/- creative disguises and escapes Cataleya continues to murder, falls in love with and artist (MIchael Vartan), fools the police (Lennie James), avoids the complicit FBI ( Callum Blue) and continues her struggle to kill the persons of interest - Jodri Moll, Beto Benites and Jesse Borrego.  Is it all resolved after the bad guys are all dead?  No, because there is the suggestion of a sequel!

In fact, it sounded like a another cheesy B revenge movie with some crazy fool running around going nuts & blowing people up, with mostly or all unrealistic movie stunts & CGI...

I decided to further research this movie by reading reviews on amazon.com, and after reading the very positive reviews I decided to buy this movie on it's bluray release date.

I watched it last night & I must say it is SIMPLY AMAZING!!!
What a great movie!!!! A+ to everyone involved...

Zoe Saldana was absolutely perfect for her leading role!
Her acting was OUTSTANDING & she should definately perform in more types of movie genres like this one.
It was easy to see her Heart & Soul were both completely into this movie.
She wasn't over the top, as Jolie was at times in Salt.
Don't get me wrong the movie had plenty of action & great cinematography, but it was all believable & so well wrote/acted that is was smooth as butter!

The story line was perfect...
Yes, it is a revenge plot, but this movie offered much more than your typical revenge type of movie. It had a Great & Believable story, not too mention the acting was PERFECT...

The movie had several characters involved in the story with high emotions & energy that added drama, action & mystique to the story. The other characters in the movie fed off of Zoe Saldana's Masterpiece performance!!!

I have no doubt they can make a second installment of this movie & they should.
Although, they should promote it better the next time though, as I heard hardly anything about this movie until just a few weeks before it's bluray release.

Don't Rent this movie, BUY, BUY, BUY it...
You will not be disappointed!

4853924,4,B005OK721G,"Last week I saw Zoe Saldana being interviewed on Chelsea Lately. Up to that point I had not intended to see the movie. I thought she had a presence about her though, and when she mentioned it was a Luc Besson movie, whose name is synonymous with stylish thriller, I had to go.

Throughout his illustrious film career as writer, producer and director, Luc Besson has crafted many thrillers featuring assassins. Most notably probably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Femme-Nikita/dp/B004GIV0MO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Femme Nikita</a>, which has now become two different tv series, and remade as an American movie starring Bridget Fonda, which lacked the killer instinct of the original. He wrote the characters for the Transporter movies starring Jason Statham, and the excellent movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taken/dp/B002BI6SMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taken</a>&nbsp;starring Liam Neeson. Leon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lon-The-Professional-Theatrical-and-Extended-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B002O5M4SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lon: The Professional (Theatrical and Extended Edition) [Blu-ray</a>], a personal favorite stars Natalie Portman in her first screen role, and he wrote Colombiana.

While Colombiana may not distinguish itself particularly when compared with these other movies, what does distinguish it is Zoe Saldana. If looks could kill, she wouldn't need a weapon. So, when a young girl witnesses her parents murdered by a ruthless druglord, she demonstrates strange abilities, makes her way to America, joins her uncle. Picture a 10 year old saying to her uncle: ""I want to kill people, can you help?""

So, she becomes an assassin, and finds creative ways of getting into the most secure places. She is like the mist. You may notice something visually captivating, and captivating in other ways too, about watching a woman in a sleek, figure revealing black one piece, doing all manner of things which demonstrate her flexibility and nimbleness, and wielding a weapon. It's quite sexy.

In fact it's fair to say that Zoe Saldana elevates the movie, and shows that she has what it takes to play leading roles, and carry a movie at the box office. Yes, as you expect, you will find the usual crash bang wallop here too.
So, I give the movie 6 out of 10 for quality, 8 out of 10 for style, and I give Zoe Saldana 10 out of 10, for her presence, charisma, and overall sexiness, which makes the movie 8 out of 10.

And if you like this movie, and have not already seen the other ones I highlighted above, I highly recommend you check them out. I think you will enjoy the movie, and I hope you found this review helpful.",1324684800,4,2778,5.765853658536585

The plot is absolutely absurd.  The characters are, if such a thing is possible, less than one dimensional.  The directing is beyond lazy.  The action sequences are boring.  And Zoe Saldana has all the charisma of a pool noodle.

Her family was killed and she spends the rest of her child/teen years becoming an assassin/killer so she can kill the people that murdered her family.  I have seen way better revenge films (Taken, Mechanic, Shooter, Unforgiven, Count of Monte Cristo, etc.).  Two stars because this movie is not a complete yawn.  There are some entertaining moments.",1324425600,,590,4.84
4853931,4,B005OK721G,"French writer, producer, and director Luc Besson reinvented the killer chick flick genre back in 1990 with his stylist shoot'em up ""La Femme Nikita."" Before ""La Femme Nikita"" illuminated screens, the best killer chick flicks came from a variety of directors, actresses, and genres. Low-budget, indie director Ted V. Mikels helmed ""The Doll Squad"" (1973) and ""Ten Violent Women"" (1982). African-American actress Pam Grier empowered women in such B-movie classics as ""Big Doll House"" (1971), ""Coffy"" (1973), ""Foxy Brown"" (1974), and ""Friday Foster"" (1975). In 1973, future Nancy Reagan astrologer Joyce Jillson starred in ""Super Chick"" as an airline attendant named Tara B. True who held a black belt in karate and thwarted a jet hijacking. Another African-American actress Tamara Dobson top-lined ""Cleopatra Jones"" (1973) and ""Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold"" (1975). Most of these movies drew their inspiration from Asian actioneers where women wielded lethal weapons without a qualm, like ""Female Demon Ohyaku"" (1968), ""Okatsu the Fugitive"" (1969), ""Quick-draw Okatsu"" (1969), ""Blind Woman's Curse"" (1970) and ""Lady Snowblood"" (1971). At the same time, the Japanese produced the ""Zero Woman"" franchise of shoot'em ups in the Pinky Violence Collection featuring: ""Delinquent Girl Boss: Worthless To Confess"" (1971) ""Girl Boss Guerilla"" (1972) , ""Criminal Woman: Killing Melody"" (1973), and ""Terrifying Girls' High School: Lynch Law Classroom"" (1973). Before the violent Asian costume thrillers and the occasional American crime melodrama, only denim-clad dames in westerns such as ""Johnny Guitar"" (1954), ""Two-Gun Lady"" (1955), ""Gunslinger"" (1956), and ""Forty Guns"" (1957) were allowed to pack pistols.

""Le Femme Nikita"" propelled the genre into the 1990s but focused primarily on contemporary professional women armed with a modern arsenal of firepower. Not-surprisingly, clones proliferated: ""Tank Girl"" (1995), ""Cherry"" (2000), ""The Silencer"" (2000), and ""Thelma and Louise (1991). In ""La Femme Nikita,"" the eponymous anti-heroine was a convicted gal slated for execution who received a second chance at life if she performed executions for the government. Besson's charismatic thriller starred newcomer Anne Parillaud and spawned a Hollywood remake, ""Point of No Return"" with Bridget Fonda as well as a Hong Kong version ""Black Cat"" (1991). Later, Besson made ""The Professional"" (1994) where an expert hit man, Jean Reno, taught a young girl, Natalie Portman, to how to kill the dastards who had murdered her parents. A cable television series ""La Femme Nikita"" with Peta Wilson appeared from 1997 to 2001. In 2010, another version of ""La Femme Nikita"" hit the small screen with Maggie Q cast in ""Nikita.""

Cleverly, Besson has recycled some of the best scenes from both ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""The Professional"" to make ""Colombiana."" Sexy Zoe Saldana of ""Avatar"" stars as a sympathetic but indestructible female assassin who seems prepared for every contingency. Make no mistake; the filmmakers treat the theme of female empowerment in this seasoned but Spartan saga with few surprises but a surplus of sizzle. If you've seen either ""La Femme Nikita"" and/or ""The Professional,"" you can spot the inspiration for ""Colombiana."" An early scene in ""La Femme Nikita"" depicts the heroine plunging a pencil into a policeman's hand. Similarly, an early scene in ""Colombiana"" shows our childish heroine stabbing a villain and pinning his hand to a table while she makes good her escape. No matter how derivative this suspenseful, high-octane, white-knuckled epic is, ""Transporter 3"" director Olivier Megaton compensates with picturesque staging, a cast with provocative faces, and atmospheric locales.

Initially, ""Colombiana"" opens in Bogot, Columbia, 1992. Ten-year old Cataleya Restrepo (newcomer Amanda Stenberg) watches as the henchmen of crime lord Don Luis (Beto Benities) murder her mother and father after her father tries to leave the organization. Luis' right-hand man, Marco (Jordi Molla of ""Blow""), tries to capture Cataleya because she has in her possession a microchip filled with incriminating evidence that her father had given her as insurance. He tells her that the microchip is her passport to America. Cataleya enters the United States, strikes a deal with the U.S. authorities, and hands them all the information on the Luis' gang. She escapes from the U.S. authorities and catches a bus to Chicago, Illinois, to live with her Uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis of ""Training Day"") in Chicago.

A criminal himself, Emilio lets the young girl sleep in his late son's room and trains her to as a contract assassin. In one great scene, Emilio explains that even contract assassins--if they plan to survive more than five years--must attend public school and display some modicum of intelligence. Besson and co-scripter Robert Mark Kamen fast-forward the plot 15 years ahead, and Cataleya has become a svelte killing machine who has discovered Don Luis has been taken into protective custody by the CIA. Nevertheless, the Central Intelligence Agency allows Luis to continue his business as usual. Neither the CIA nor the FBI, however, can thwart Cataleya when she goes into action against them, knocking off one individual at a time until she confronts Marco. After she kills a victim, our heroine draws a Cataleya flower on him to remind Don Luis that he is her prime target. When Cataleya isn't dodging Don Luis' gunmen, she must keep a step ahead of a tenacious FBI agent, Ross (Lennie James of ""The Next Three Days"") who believes that a man is responsible for the murder rampage. Cataleya lets her romantic relationship with an artist, Danny (Michael Vartan of ""Alias""), interfere with her plans. Danny has no clue about her line of work, until he exposes her quite by accident to the villains. The scene where the FBI and a SWAT team surround Cataleya's safe house generates considerable tension.

""Colombiana"" qualifies as an outlandish, audacious exercise in suspense and tension that benefits from Zoe Saldana's performance and helmer Olivier Megaton's slam-bang action scenes.",1324425600,4,6096,5.392444910807975

4853933,1,B005OK721G,"A big waste of time. No reality to it at all. No women can do what she does in this film. Third rate hoods and punks would blow her to pieces for fun.

4853935,1,B005OK721G,"Zoe Saldana, let's face it, she is hot, she can act, but she can't carry this movie.  This movie just drones on and on.  If you have seen the TV show Nikita twice, you have seen this whole movie twice.
I have watched this movie for 1 and a half hours and had to stop.  It just sucked.
Not to give anything away, but she kills someone.  Wow.  They try to throw in a boyfriend to create some kind of sympathy for her emotional sacrifice, just doesn't work.  Why would I care, she a psychopathic killer.  Everything builds her up to this.  Someone should have told the writers to let it go, and just let her be a darn good looking badass.
It just didn't work, by the end I didn't care who she killed or didn't kill.  Buy the poster, nevermind,poster is to expensive, but there are some scenes in here that you can freeze frame that are awesome.
Did I mention that Zoe Saldana is hot?",1324339200,6,880,4.190476190476191
4853936,5,B005OK721G,"Criticism of this movie will come in very technical terms (lack of believability, incoherent plot, etc). This is just plain ole fun. It most closely resembles 'SALT' minus the big budget. Nonetheless, its a kick a$$ revenge fantasy with its own charm,with violence that isn't too graphic. This makes a great gift for movie buffs who don't wanna think too much, but want to just drop some popcorn as they howl at the screen. ZOE SALDANA has never looked better.",1324339200,5,460,4.7625
4853937,5,B005OK721G,"I love this movie.  I went to see it in theaters twice.  And I am anxiously waiting for the DVD.

Zoe portrayed the emotions of the main character very well. Instead of acting it seemed like she was the character.  I was cheering for her to get her target because I felt for her so much.

And her action scenes were jaw dropping.  The action kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.
I love the beginning of the movie though it is heart breaking but there is a lot of action in it and quite entertaining.  And I am not a fan of action movies but this one really had a plot that I could follow.  And to a certain degree I can definitely relate to the feelings of the character.

And I was comfortable with the love scenes.  They were not about raunchy sex but about how she has a void within her that needs to be filled with love and being connected and belonging to someone.  I love the scene where the boyfriend wants to learn about her and how she feels.  And her reaction really screams the theme of the story.

And the cast they picked was awesome specifically for the Colombia scenes, it represented a group of Latins that are rarely shown to the world.  This was not a typical action movie.  It was certainly different.  I love seeing movies like this that come out once a blue moon.  I wish I can see more like them.

Love. Love. Love. Love it.  Beautiful talented lead.  Great entertaining action.  And a theme and plot (not just about killing to be killing).",1323216000,7,1478,4.225806451612903
4853938,3,B005OK721G,"This is a film whose ambitions are blatantly clear:  it wants to combine the violent realism and shadowy intrigue of the Bourne series with the romantic chic and assassin's pop psych of Nikita and a dash of the high tech sophistication of Nathan Hunt.  Unfortunately, in spite of jerky-camera fight scenes and elaborate scenarios with the sinuously stunningly beautiful Saldana in tight body suits, the film doesn't quite work.  Even worse for an action film, I had this nagging critical voice at the back of my mind that continually reminded me that someone was making this all up - I could not suspend my disbelief and just watch.

The story is about a girl who decided to become an assassin after she witnesses the violent death of her parents.  Right away, it appears unbelievable.  At 9, in a school girls uniform, she escapes a gang of seasoned murderers in a chase through the slum streets of Bogota, vowing revenge and making her way to Chicago relatives.  Skip to the future, and she executes a number of technically perfect assassinations - with none of the ""things that go wrong"" improvisations that make great caper films so much fun - while finding out more and more about her father's murderer.  Of course, throw in a little corruption and intrigue, and you get the same old formula.  Then there is a climax, she can't go back to her handsome lover, and survives for sequels (assuming this make enough money).

Saldana and the other actors are indisputably talented and often give gifted performances.  The action scenes are fun, if too clean and in the end somewhat incoherent.  In one scene, she gets jailed on purpose, escapes to kill some prisoner, and gets back in her cell, framing a guard by using his gun and getting released.  The FBI then correlates a random photo they find on a police databank (sent by her lover's friend, who wants to help him identify her) with the security camera images of her nose and hands, all in a few seconds.  It was laughably unbelievable.

I would recommend this as background fun.  But it is a 3-star performance from a first-rate talent like Besson.",1323129600,9,2106,4.728767123287671
4853939,4,B005OK721G,"When this movie was in theater's, I saw this movie about four times.

It is not the greatest movie of all times, but it is very entertaining, and I do like the revenge flics, and Zoe Saldana did a very good job portraying the character, she had a good balance between revenge and her emotions over what she was doing, she was not the typical heartless killer. On par her character reminded me of Denzel Washington character from ""Man on Fire"", both characters balanced their revenge and their emotions with their revenge acts.

The movie could have been better, maybe more character development with the bad guys and her parents to fully understand the revenge, other than that she saw them killed in front of her.

I am hoping the unrated version will open up more story line to the film, if not, I will still enjoy the film.

I recommend it to anyone who wants to satisfy their revenge flic need, like Man on Fire, Man a Part, etc.",1322179200,89,933,4.470588235294118
8481498,3,B005OK721G,"After the Bourne Trilogy and Taken, but before John Wick, there was Colombiana. A revenge film with high octane action and plenty of kills, Colombiana was pretty ground breaking at the time. While the hyper speed pace remains, the superfluous jump cuts are quite dated. Colombiana remains a fun action thriller like no other.

Zoe Saldana leads the charge as the highly skilled assassin that is equally sexy and lethal. Colombiana persists as my personal favorite Saldana film. She is cool and clever as this heroine. Saldana made for the perfect action star in Colombiana.

Unfortunately, Oliver Megaton is not a great director, so his style muddles Colombiana overall. The movie is quick paced, but overly simplistic. The performances are believable, but the dialogue from Luc Besson is rather underwritten. The edits are way too frequent ruining otherwise interesting shots. The music is exciting, but feels melodramatic at times. The explosions and gunfights are very cool, but overblown.

Colombiana is still an exhilarating thriller today. It just has its obvious flaws.",1529625600,,1076,5.280701754385965
