7909254,5,B00000I1QU,"This is actually the first Lupin the 3rd movie, originally released in 1978. The only thing that really gives the date away is the goofy soundtrack though. It IS quite funny. If you are new to Lupin (aka Rupan, depending on who did the dubbing/subbing), he is a master theif; sort of a cross between James Bond and Robin Hood, though he certainly does not give to the poor. ;) He has an on-again/off-again relationship with the beautiful and busty Fujiko Mine. She's also a thief and is always trying to one-up Lupin. She's nude a few times in this one, just so you are warned. This is the ""sexiest"" Lupin movie I've seen... LOTS of inuendo, and its hysterical. The plot in this one is kind of hard to explain, but basically. Lupin helps Fujiko get strange artifacts for an even stranger little man (Mamo), who really is a very dangerous and powerful adversary. Before long. Lupin and the gang are caught up in Mamo's plans, and somehow must escape alive and also save the world from being nuked... see? Just like James Bond. I wouldn't steer you wrong.  Each Lupin movie is different from the other, depending on who directed it. The main characters are basically the same in all the movies (Lupin, Jigen, Fujiko, Goemon and Zenigata), as is the skeleton of the plot. Not surprising, as Lupin the 3rd is a Manga from Monkey Punch and was a TV series in Japan beginning in the 1970's. The Mystery of Mamo is a very funny adventure/comedy with a twist of sci-fi. The Castle of Cagliostro is another Lupin film that I HIGHLY recommend. The animation is gorgeous, the voices are the BEST, and while its still a comedy/adventure/mystery, it has a kind of fairy-tale feel to it.",990316800,,1673,4.576666666666667
7909255,5,B00000I1QU,This is a very funny anime.  If you are looking for somthing that is hilarius buy this movie.  it is about Lupin the 3rd who is suposedly the greatest theif on earth and Detective Zenagata who is obsesed with catching  him.  The artwork is not as high tech looking as newer anime and has a much  more cartoony feel.,944611200,2,315,4.271186440677966
