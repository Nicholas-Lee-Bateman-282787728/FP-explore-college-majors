8121910,1,B000FFJZDI,The worst thing he has every done it was cheap and i feel it should have been free. katt williams was it the for about 1.5 minutes if you blink you will miss him. he shouldn't be on the cover as if he is doing stand up on the movie. I returned the movie it was so bad,1213747200,2,267,3.6206896551724137
8121911,4,B000FFJZDI,"I'll admit it, I hate this dvd but Michael Blackson saved it from getting thrown in the trash. Michael Blackson had me laughing from the beginning of his session to the end! I hope Master P paid his @$$ alot of money for saving that dvd. I really buy the Gutter Music Realease dvd for the soundtracks and they never seem to disapoint me. I liked the soundtrack on this dvd but I'm going to recommend that everyone buy's The movie that comes with the soundtrack ""Gods Gift"" by Romeo. The movie is good and the soundtrack is more like a full lenght album! It also comes with about 4 videos.",1192233600,,588,4.306306306306307
8121912,2,B000FFJZDI,I was very disappointed with this comedy dvd presented by Master P.  The comedians were not funny and the quality of the video was unprofessional looking and dark.  Just seemed like it was thrown together quickly.  I cannot tell you have aggravated I was thinking about the money I spent for this dvd. Buyers beware.,1163030400,,316,4.709090909090909
8121913,3,B000FFJZDI,"I MAY NOT BE FROM THE HOOD BUT EVEN I KNOW THIS IS NOT FUNNY

THERE IS ONE AFRICAN GUY WHO IS OK BUT THE OTHERS ARE terrible

GET THE FILM REPOS - THAT IS PRETTY GOOD.

THE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS IS THE SOUNDTRACK YOU GET BUT THE DVD ITSELF IS SOMETIMES HARD TO WATCH.
