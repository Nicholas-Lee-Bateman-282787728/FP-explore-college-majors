8206939,5,B00009KP0Q,This set is every bit as good and as relevant as when I first saw it on PBS more than 20 years ago.,1374710400,,99,3.347826086956522
8206940,5,B00009KP0Q,"I too am waiting for this to be released on DVD (or better yet Blu-ray) for U.S. players.  There have been many very good, and some excellent (The Sandbaggers, Yes, Minister/Yes, Prime Minister) British TV series, and this is one of the very best.  May our wish come true...",1322524800,2,274,4.571428571428571
8206941,5,B00009KP0Q,"Please, please, Powers That Be in the DVD world, someone must release this in a Region 1 format so we Americans who love Peter Davison can enjoy this wonderful show. Now that all my VHS tapes have gone to the dump, I no longer have that option of watching what I once taped off of the television (the VHS tapes deteriorated to the point where I had no audio left on the tapes, so out they went). I've talked about this show for years, and pine for the whole show (only two series)on DVD, so I can share it with family and all my friends. Graham Crowder was wonderful as Jock, who, after a rocky first episode, soon became my favorite character. But all the characters were fabulous, great performances from the whole ensemble cast, and worth watching over & over. So, will someone please release this in the US?",1314835200,2,811,4.413333333333333
8206942,5,B00009KP0Q,"Written by Andrew Davies, one of the best TV writers alive, this is a truly superb and funny double series.  The first series features Peter Davison as an idealistic doctor who arrives to join the medical centre of Lowland University in England; his colleagues include a radical feminist (the wonderful Barbara Flynn), a drunken cynic (Graham Crowden) and a prat who is always looking out for the main chance (David Troughton).  Bitterly satirical about the state of modern education, it is also very funny.  The second series is set during the following academic year, and the university has been bought by an American (Michael J. Shannon) who proceeds to reorganise it along business lines.  Still funny, and still satirical.  Highly recommended.",1196812800,8,748,5.148760330578512
