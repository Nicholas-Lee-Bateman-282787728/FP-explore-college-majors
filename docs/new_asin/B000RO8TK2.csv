8201661,5,B000RO8TK2,"It's a terrific, truly independent movie, which is both intelligent and refreshing. The production values are high and the acting is good. By the look of the movie, the director must be a perfectionist. He has given us a work of art. This anthology of three short films deals with the creative process. What makes us want to create and what drives our creativity? In the first part, the ghost of Van Gogh returns to earth and teaches a hack painter where real creativity comes from. In the second part, a new hire at a movie studio becomes mystified by the absurdity of the machinations of the mechanism, which is known as the studio. A benefactor rescues the new hire and they escape to make the last leg of the trilogy. In the last part, an artist goes deep into his own soul and tangled emotions to resolve his creative angst. If you like Woody Allen, Henry Jaglom, or Ingmar Bergman you will like this movie.",1229299200,,912,4.5
8201662,5,B000RO8TK2,"as the other reviews seem to mention - it is a ""pay attention"" film.  it is 3 films that go together.

i have watched it a few times.  each time i notced something new that i may have missed previously.  my favorite was actually the 2nd film - probably because of the ""biz"" comments and i'm a sucker for 'wizard of oz' - so that part made me smile.

i suggest watching it a few times.  also possibly with a variety of people who might each understand a different reference the film comments on.

8201663,4,B000RO8TK2,"I loved it.  If you love good quality independent films, this is a must see!! It's well written and the acting and cinematography are great. The first is my favorite and leaves you uplifted. The second is a hoot if you follow all the jabs in reference to Hollywood and the ""biz.""  I really enjoyed it all the way around.",1221696000,,320,4.316666666666666
8201664,4,B000RO8TK2,"Looking at the titles of the three parts of this movie, you wouldn't
think they have anything to do with each other, but they nod a nice job is done in weaving them together in the end.

The first, about the snobbish artist, is the most like an ""Aesop's
Fable"" in that it has an obvious moral message. I thought it was well
acted and even funny.

The second, and my favorite, is a nice jab at the whole process of
making a ""studio movie"" and the type of people who run the studio. Done
as a cross between a film-noir and a spoof. And even though it is
making fun of studio movies, it still manages some tributes to some
(such as ""The Wizard of Oz""). But I don't think your average movie-goer
is going to get what this movie is about, or understand the ending.

I felt the third segment was the weakest of the three, perhaps because
it was trying to do the most. If you weren't paying attention to the
other two segments, this would be a confusing piece. It takes a few
minutes to understand what is going on, and by that time many people
might turn away from it. It serves as a nice wrap up to how the
writer/director's creative process worked. It is sort of about making
the movie that you're watching.

Which, in way, all three segments are all about the movie in some
way.  So I guess you could say your watching a movie that is about the
movie  your watching.

Overall I really enjoyed this, but the viewer must be prepared to
actually pay attention. So, I don't think it is for everyone.",1188432000,,1492,4.232394366197183
8201665,5,B000RO8TK2,"The movie is wonderful. It is wittty and down right funny while giving a true interpretation of the issues regarding Art and Film making. I find myself watching the three fables over and over. The first one is my favorite but the third is right up there with it.
I highly recomend it.
