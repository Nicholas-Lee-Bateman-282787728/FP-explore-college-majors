There is no nudity, no profanity, no happy ending, and it is a waste of rental money. The women are only worth looking at when there is a 'lineup' in front of a customer.

Take me seriously. Don't take me seriously. It's your money.",1104969600,29,344,4.4603174603174605
2160982,5,B00062IXL0,"Yes, there are plenty of T&A if you are interested. Almost every pretty actresses in this movie appears topless at least once. But, without those scenes, it is still a good movie. A story about a group of prostitutes with different problems. A soon-to-be a bride who tried to hide her past. A mother who tried to be a role model for her daughter. A former actress who ran away from a pimp. Besides their professionals, one thing they have in common is hopes for a better life. The script is touching and the acting is great. It was very entertaining and gave me something to think about. Only one minor flaw is these prostitutes seem to be too nice and kind. Considering the problems they've been through, they still act like angels. Something that is hard to find even among well-educated people. It makes the movie less realistic to me. But overall it is still a movie that worth watching.",1103846400,153,891,4.540372670807454
2160983,4,B00062IXL0,"When I first bought this film I thought it was a documentary.  I was a little suprised that it was a work of fiction, but to my suprise it was still quite entertaining.  This is a comical look at the lives of various hookers at a bordello in Reno.  It was refreshing to see that women wrote, produced and directed this movie.  It is not an exploitation of women, but an honest look at why they do what they do, and the courage it takes to stop and try to do something else.  You get to know these women as real people and you start to care about them.  They remind you of friends or family members that through simular situations, they could have ended up there.  Now gentlemen, if you are looking for boobies, then don't despair.  [...] but try to look beyond the peaks and valleys.  There is real emotion here, and some powerful messages about society.  Actually, this could almost be a pilot for a sitcom.  It has the feel of ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore."" It's that good!",1101686400,63,979,4.324175824175824

Beautiful story that leaves you wanting more...  Grit laced in hope.  Humanity laced in reality...  People doing what they have to do...  I thought Lisa Melamed's poignant story is beautifully directed by Sex In The City's Susan Seidelman.  Classic beauty Jessica Collins shares a moment/scene with Nicki Micheaux that is NOT to be missed.  Paige Moss delivers a character that disturbs brilliantly.  You feel Bonnie Root's character's broken dreams, and Samantha Ferris' simply wanting to be a good parent...  All held together with Amy Madigan's nine millimeter!

2161251,2,B00062IXL0,"If your looking for a good naughty movie, or a fun erotic movie with lots of sex... avoid this movie.  There probably are a few sexy scenes, at least in the unrated version I would hope, but the movie seems to be aimed at showing why men should feel guilty about going to someplace like this fictional prostitute ranch.  Basically it makes the men in the film out to be sad pathetic loosers, the women to be desperate to eke out a living no matter the cost, and is just sad.  It goes on and on about the lives of each of the brothel workers to the point where you only feel sad and depressed for the women and makes you want to go there an offer them a job elsewhere.  Unfortunately, they don't even completely follow through with that being the plot of the movie.  Just when you start thinking about the movie being some sort of moral lesson about the dangers of prostitution and what a horrible life it is, the movie switches to why it might make a good career and really isn't all that bad after-all.  It was almost like the writer was having some half thought through debate as to whether prostitution is bad at one of these regulated ranches where it is legal, but didn't actually want to do any real research or put too much thought into it.  It has a couple parts where you think it might finally get to the point of having the potential to be a good movie only to fall flat with dropped plot lines.  When the movie finally ended, you get this feeling like... that is all!!! You made me sit through all that!  I only give this two stars because you do get brief glimpses of sexy women.  Otherwise it would be worthless.  The cover is about as sexy as it gets.",1331683200,3,1666,4.2405063291139244

2161334,4,B00062IXL0,"My wife and I purchased three ""Adult"" DVDs for late night viewing. The first was ""Forbidden"" and it was neither a very good movie, nor was it particularly arousing. A waste of time would be a good short description.

The next night we viewed ""The Ranch,"" a story of a Nevada bordello. Now, just in case you haven't heard, prostitution is legal in all but two counties in Nevada. Once you get used to recognizing the establishments you'll find them scattered all over Nevada and many of them are referred to as ""ranches."" Some are way out in the country and some are in the smaller towns. About 50 years ago when I was a graduate student I visited ""The Big Four"" in Ely, Nevada. It was located about one block off the main street and looked like a low-key tavern. Two of us were taken there by a friend who just had to show us what a real bordello was like. We didn't partake, rather we just sat at the bar and drank a beer, much like one of the characters in the movie. Three young ladies came out and tried to entice us. I was a bit taken back in that the three women weren't glamorized at all as you usually see in Hollywood depictions. If you saw them out on the street, you would never recognize their profession. Never. Well, although somewhat tempting, at that time the going rate was said to be about twenty bucks. That might seem terribly cheap, but when you're working your way through school at at six bits an hour, it's  a week's wages and is very expensive. The establishment was neat and clean and nothing like what must go through most people's minds when they think of a bordello. While I was there a policeman came in, and he checked my ID to make certain I was old enough to drink.

So that little experience helped me to understand and appreciate the movie ""The Ranch."" The movie involved the lives of a half-dozen prostitutes, all very real people with very real lives. The acting was excellent and the people were believable. All of the women appeared at least partially nude in one place or another, but it was done in a rather tasteful fashion. There were only a few actual sex scenes and they were rather low key. From my own experience, I'd say the bordello was rather large and glamorized and the woman were closer to the Hollywood versions of prostitutes and their surroundings. But, alas, my experience is limited to one visit of one bordello and that was 50 years ago. Who knows what they might be like today?

In any case, ""The Ranch"" is a rather good movie. It's touching in places and funny in others. I wouldn't give it five stars, but I have no trouble at all with four. If you're just seeking arousal, there's better stuff around. But, if you're looking for a well done, interesting adult movie, I'd highly recommend ""The Ranch.""

2161337,4,B00062IXL0,"In some parts of Nevada, prostitution is legal.  It's the only U.S. state I know of where this is the case.  The most famous brothels in NV are the BUNNY Ranch & the MUSTANG Ranch, and both of these are mentioned-in-passing in this film.  The DIAMOND Ranch is a fictional ranch where the story in this film takes place.

The framework of the story is set in the day-to-day operations of the ranch, while the plot of the film details how courtesans attempt to cope with ""real life"" outside the ranch.  Try as they might, they find it very difficult to live ""normal"" lives due to their chosen profession.

One of the prostitutes is planning to get married.  Another prostitute wants to be a fit & supportive mother to her daughter while smoothing out relations w/her ex hubby.  One of the women wants to have a run-of-the-mill b/f while another of the girls is trying to escape from her controlling psycho pimp.

What they all encounter is the fact that the occupation is kind of like a Venus flytrap;  once you get into it, it's next to impossible to escape the prostitution line-of-work.  Like exotic dancers, they find that nothing on the ""outside"" pays nearly as well, and the women only need to use their beauty to draw in $$.  On the downside, there is little hope of escape and they are continually looked down on by regular folk.

For those wondering about the skin-o-meter, the DVD delivers in that regard.  All of the women on the cover except one appear topless @ least once.  Fortunately, they didn't try to make this into a watered-down ""G"" Rated affair.

This is a pretty good flick which goes ""behind the curtain"" to show us what happens in a NV brothel.  I would particularly recommend this movie to any women who are even remotely considering getting into exotic dancing or working @ a brothel.  The adult entertainment industry has excellent pay, but the pitfalls are many.",1263772800,9,1889,4.621621621621622

Society hasn't been easy on them.

Loneliness and isolation in modern society isn't well dealt with.

That whore houses are an antithesis to the puritan forefathers

and the Christan religious right

hasn't made them disappear.

Sociologically for the prostitutes the ""house"" set up is safer.

Psychologically for the male such houses seem to serve a purpose

2161343,4,B00062IXL0,"This is a really good pilot, but in the end you're left wanting more.  The problem is that so far I haven't been able to find any series box set from Showtime.  This could be described as what you'd get if you mixed ""The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas"" with ""Desperate Housewives"" without any of the singing.  In fact most of the hookers seem to be around the same age group as Desperate Housewives, and a lot alike in appearance.  Only these women's trials and tribulations are around  prostitution while attempting to have some sense of a normal existance in the other areas of their lives.  After watching HBO's ""Cathouse"" this seems to be fairly close to the actual business of a brothel.

I only have two problems with this version.  First is that even though this is rated as an ""R"" version it really seems edited for prime time TV.  Some of the dubing over the swearing is almost comical.....My other problem is that this really must be a pilot because there's so many different stories going on, and when it closes there's all these open ends to all these individual stories.

If you're going to buy this then I'd look for the uncut version because the ""R"" version seems to have a lot missing.
