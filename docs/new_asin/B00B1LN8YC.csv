5552302,4,B00B1LN8YC,"There is a growing list of dinosaur documentaries out there. This one is recent and features an upgrade in theories
and animation quality.  It focuses on the predator  dinosaurs and theories on how they survived for millions of years.  I think those that follow palentology will find this a welcome addition to their collection of Dino DVDS. I know I am glad to have it.",1379462400,5,370,4.661538461538462
5552303,5,B00B1LN8YC,"If you are into dinosaurs, this DVD is well worth getting.  The narrator, Bill Oddie, does an excellent job of presenting the most recent dinosaur data within this fine film.  There is plenty of CGI footage of dinosaurs that look realistic enough.  There is also a lot of experimentation-oriented footage, such as via a fabricated life-size T-rex skull (to test what it could actually crush by regulating the bite force per square centimeter comparable to that of what crocodiles/alligators would have at around the same size); also, the velociraptor's killing sickle toe/claw is analyzed (via mechanical models simulating bone and muscle) to determine what it may have been realistically capable of. Interesting stuff, indeed!  The combination of realistic-enough dinosaur computer animations and structured laboratory tests were interlaced with taste; it made for an overall interesting DVD; I was very glad that I had purchased it! Educational and entertaining! Strongly reinforces the fact that birds are the descendants of dinosaurs.",1366588800,9,1038,5.509433962264151

8560946,4,B00B1LN8YC,"Sure, it's silly. Sure, it's meant for children. Probably. As a 23 year old dinosaur enthusiast, I thought the host was very entertaining. As he was wading through a famous river with fossilized Acrocanthosaurus foot prints, I could tell he was very excited about what he was talking about. Maybe not the most informative of documentaries, but certainly entertaining. Also, the one thing keeping this from that fifth star is that there are only two episodes on the DVD. Kind of disappointed with that, but they can't all be Walking with Dinosaurs or Planet Dinosaur.",1430956800,,566,4.968421052631579
8560947,3,B00B1LN8YC,"Great seller but not the best doc. Informative, but it feels rehashed and sorta boring.",1420848000,,87,4.866666666666666
8560948,4,B00B1LN8YC,Great documentary! My son loves it! My only problem is that it seems very focused on the narrator rather than the dinosaurs.,1407369600,,124,4.681818181818182
8560949,5,B00B1LN8YC,"My 2 youngest sons love to watch almost anything to do with dinosaurs.  Hard for me anymore to find something they have not seen since we watch and buy so many....this fit the bill and they thoroughly enjoyed it, was a good price, it had just been lowered 4 dollars so I bought it....always looking for something new or newer concerning dinosaurs....",1406419200,,350,4.645161290322581
8560950,3,B00B1LN8YC,If you will watch anything about dinosaurs you will enjoy it.  Somewhat simplistic and the CGI is not the greatest in the world but it is a fun way to spend time.  Walking with Dinosaurs is far better.  Sort of Jurassic Fight Club so be warned,1401667200,,243,4.239130434782608
