5792656,1,B00DD0ZNE2,I did not find this helpful in any way. I ended up finding another series that did a much better job.,1437782400,,101,3.857142857142857
5792657,5,B00DD0ZNE2,"This is a great course, easy to follow and covers a wide range of music styles. Simplifies what may appear to be so difficult, they make it easy. Wonderful product even if you have been playing for a while. By the way they link you to a jam sight with a lot of advanced stuff.  Good investment for $20.",1426636800,3,302,4.11864406779661

5792659,5,B00DD0ZNE2,"Back when I used to take lessons, my teacher cost me $40 for every 30-minute session. Most of that time was used to ""review"" the previous lesson so really, 15 minutes of learning anything new. Total crook.

This 4 DVD set is completely opposite. It's 9 hours of earnest lessons that get straight to the point. Finally.

The video classes give you a great crash course in the basics of any style and is very in depth with ""fingerstyle."" Also it has tabs  that go along with the lessons in pdf format.  If you want to become a decent player, and learn CORRECT techniques, you can't go wrong with this DVD set. Especially for the price, there's really nothing better.",1381363200,15,664,4.508333333333334
5792660,5,B00DD0ZNE2,"This four dvd set teaches you how to play guitar is amazing! In each dvd you learn something new, whether the basics or techniques for advanced players, you can learn fast and easy. The blues guitar dvd is my favorite and the best among the four because of the two camera angles. And the advanced guitar one is outdated, it looks like it was transfer from a VHS. But for the price and around nine hours of footage, it's a great deal!!! I would recommend these dvds for anyone who wants to play the guitar or someone who already plays and wants to learn more.",1380758400,3,558,4.3238095238095235
5792661,5,B00DD0ZNE2,"The whole set is amazing and the Blues Guitar DVD is so easy to follow and learn from. I love the fact that it gives you instructions on how to play actual songs using a blues guitar. I also love the fact that once you pick a song to learn or practice with, you have the option to get the instructions first if you are just beginning. Then as your skills progress you can play the song along with the DVD at half the speed and then eventually at full speed. This DVD makes it easy to get started, but also helps you to keep developing your skills.",1378684800,9,547,4.074074074074074
5792662,5,B00DD0ZNE2,"I'm a bassist, and I have a friend working on the guitar. Picked these up so she could learn. I had a chance to look them over first, and I was very pleased with what I found. The DVDs feature clear instructions and are easy to follow and learn from. My particular favorite was the blues DVD, which offered a great selection of introductory songs to work off of.

I think it'll be awhile before she moves on the the Advanced Guitar DVD, but I'm glad I've got that at the ready for her. I'm suggesting other friends check it out.",1376438400,4,528,4.227722772277228
8592082,1,B00DD0ZNE2,I purchased this for my son to learn from and it's terrible. The discs skip in the same places and the instructor fumbles over his words and doesn't explain things clearly.,1521676800,,172,4.580645161290323

8592088,2,B00DD0ZNE2,"I bought this for my grandniece because she's too far away for one-on-one lessons.  What a disappointment.  The guy on the DVDs has no energy, so the excitement of learning something just isn't there.  I don't know if he's reading from a script, but he's slow and boring and hems and haws and just makes you want to shout, ""Say it!""  And there are other problems, too many to list here.  And little annoyances.  The photography is bad.  Thank goodness Julie knows the basic chords because you cannot see where this guy is placing his fingers.  A minor annoyance for anyone who has handled a guitar but a potential big problem for beginners.  And the shots are bad.  We see a lot of this guy's arm, hand, and crotch.  Anybody who has held a camcorder knows to shoot something like a guitar neck from above.  I'm just so annoyed that I can't even manage write a proper review.  My apologies.  Needless to say, this is a waste of money.  I could have bought Julie one decent guitar lesson near her home for what I paid for this DVD set.  What a waste.",1461283200,5,1048,4.380208333333333
