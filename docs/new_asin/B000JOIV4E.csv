8152598,5,B000JOIV4E,"I bought this for me but it seems my 15 year onld son and 10 year old daughter love all these DVD's. I have the whole set of 7. I must say to buy this he answers so much on many topic's concerning creation, dinosaurs, and so much more. He takes it all from the Bible and some from actual people (concerning the Dino's) He has pictures/ fosils etc. You will not be disappointed if you go the whole set. Now my son wants to go hear him and visit some of the places he spoke on. My daughter wants me to do her copies for school.
