He wines soo much and everyone he interviews is visibly uncomfortable, so uncomfortable, that it was painfully awkward for me to watch. Pittsburgh is a great city and deserves better. Carl should be ashamed and should have thrown all of the footage he had into the Mon River. Do not waste your time or money. If I could purchase a time machine off of Amazon to go back in time and stop myself from ordering this movie I would.",1423008000,,516,4.275510204081633
8488950,5,B005XZZ99O,"I love this film.  I am from Pgh, Pa and like to give this film to people returning to Pgh.  I laugh every time I watch it.",1366156800,,123,3.5185185185185186
8488951,3,B005XZZ99O,"I was a little disappointed of some of the choices to highlight with our beautiful city, but it was still worth the purchase.",1364515200,,125,4.478260869565218
8488952,5,B005XZZ99O,"Actually saw this twice in a theater - took all my kids and my brother to see it. Well done and funnier than a lot of the ""comedy"" features I saw last year. Tells an endearing story about the City of Pittsburgh standing in for America as a comeback tale of note - with great good humor. The star/writer/director is Carl Kurlander - self-effacing and letting it all hang out on camera - warts and all - his story alone as a Hollywood success story who proves you can go home again - surrounds himself with family and friends and Pittsburgh citizens - famous and not so famous - in a wonderful cotton candy tour. Quite well done. Uplifting and one of a kind. See this one!!",1359244800,,671,4.291338582677166
8488953,2,B005XZZ99O,"Not what I was led to believe or had hoped it would be.  A movie about one man's attempt to make a movie by whining about what a hard life he has had after writing ""St. Elmo's Fire"" and living above his means in Tinsel Town and coming back to Pittsburgh to cash in on the Western PA diaspora and our love for all things Pittsburgh.  This video is about his first-world trials and tribulations (""Oh, dear God in heaven; will I have enough money to pay for all the cheese that Teresa Heinz has picked out!!) and, oh, by the way, there's something about Pixburgh interspersed here and there.

Fast forward to the last ten minutes of the video to see the tribute to Mr. Rogers and stick around for the credits.  Note the long list of people who were interviewed for the film, but were not in it.  The video would have been far better with their insight about the 'Burgh--no matter how trite or insipid--than listening to Carl Kurlander wallow in his self-pity ad nauseum.

Was that too harsh??",1341446400,6,989,4.406593406593407
8488954,4,B005XZZ99O,"Pittsburgh, the steel town who kept its name but couldn't keep its industry. After years of economic confusion since the fall of the steel mills, the city is coming back! This documentary is a heart-felt story about the love of a city, and is one that relates to more than just Pittsburgh. It is witty and fun but beneath that you really see the heart of a city trying to be reborn, a plight not uncommon in the world today! I would definitely recommend this movie, it isn't the average bland documentary but brings entertainment in.",1329177600,,533,4.5625
8488955,4,B005XZZ99O,"You don't have to be a Pittsburgher to appreciate the message behind ""My Tale of Two Cities,"" the message of coming back.  Whether this means coming back to your hometown, or your hometown coming back as a powerful player in the national and global economy, this story can apply to any person's, or city's, situation.  It's an optimistic and encouraging film that lets you know it is never to late for a second chance. Enjoy a good laugh?  Enjoy an inspiring tale?  Enjoy walking around Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood?  Then this movie is for you!",1329177600,3,541,4.712765957446808
8488956,5,B005XZZ99O,It is not so often that true stories become epic enough to twist into a movie plot. This film will captivate and take hold of you in new and interesting ways. It is great to see how amazing a city can be and what a big part it can play into someones life. This tale is a must see for all Yinzers and city slickers alike and it just goes to show you don't forget where you come from.,1329091200,2,382,3.848101265822785
8488957,5,B005XZZ99O,"This movie tells others' stories, but it's also your story. Before watching it you enver know how many brilliant people are from the same hometown as you, they may be from your neighborhood. And this city has offered a lot to us, and it's time to show the love, and this little film is  exactly  doing this. It reunites the people who live or lived in Pittsburgh together. And for the people who don't know this city, they will probably change their percpetion and fall in love with this city and the people.",1329004800,,508,4.451612903225806
8488958,4,B005XZZ99O,"Being a less-than-hopeful resident of Pittsburgh, the film really helped me to realize the connections that Pittsburgh truly has with the outside world, and how we can move past the set-in-our-ways, sports-loving, steel town of the past. Is the film an amazingly groundbreaking expose about the underbelly of Pittsburgh's entertainment industry? No. Is it an honest, promising, realistic and original account of what people want out of Pittsburgh? Yes, and that's where it succeeds.",1322438400,2,482,5.527027027027027
