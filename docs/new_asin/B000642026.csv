2165584,5,B000642026,"I started Yoga 6 months ago and really didn't know what to expect.  Luckily for me I chose the Total Yoga 4 Pack to be my introduction. Now that I have a pretty good size selection of DVD'sto choose from, I can see just how high quality a product Total Yoga puts out.  They explain things well, give gentle reminders, and have fun while still giving you a great workout.  I definitely recommend this for beginners but someone with even a few years of experience would get a good workout with the Strength and Endurance session.",1167782400,5,527,4.46875
2165585,5,B000642026,"Just over a year ago I bought Total Yoga and began practicing at home and have not stopped since! The practice has completely changed my life! I adore it. I love Tracey Rich, the discipline of the practice, and the way that it has changed my body and my approach to breathing. I do the Fire Bonus Workout twice at the beginning of the Total Yoga DVD and then I integrate crunches into my practice independently. I swith off with Shiva Rea's sun salutations. I just love yoga!!!",1162598400,14,477,4.431818181818182
2165586,5,B000642026,"This product is perfect for any practioner of Yoga, begginers and advanced.  So easy to follow and the presentation is so soothing, I feel invigorated after practice.  Highly recommend this DVD!",1298937600,,194,5.225806451612903
2165587,5,B000642026,"I have only been using the series for 2 weeks, and I can already feel a difference in my daily life.  As one who suffers from fibromyalgia, I have found it to significantly decrease my pain.  Easy for beginners to follow, yet challenging enough to make it an excellent daily routine.  I plan on using it for years to come!",1297036800,2,322,4.333333333333333
2165588,4,B000642026,"All that was there was great.
 This is a very well paced work-out.
My one disappointment was that the 'Original Total Yoga' CD was blank.
So I would call what I received 'The Total Yoga Three Pack' Perhaps the blank disc was ment to be a meditation CD",1289260800,,251,4.229166666666667
2165589,5,B000642026,"I have purchased the Total Yoga 4 pack series. I had had the Original workout from years ago but it was in Video format and finally broke!
So, I looked it up on line and ordered the new cd's and hoped to try the yoga again after many years of not doing yoga. I am a person who has physical disabilities and have chronic pain daily. I am full of disc and soft tissue ailments and had to stop working due to my health. My body has really gone down hill and it is hard to try to find a way to keep fit and active due to the physical health conditions...that will not go away and in fact be with me for the rest of my life. All progressive. I thought to try the yoga again!
I am now on my 5th day of using it and find that I feel better from all the stretching and really am pleased I ordered them.
I suggest this yoga CD from the bottom of my heart and my toes!! Give it a try and for those of you who are like me ...take it really slow..do this a few times a week...if not more and go at your own pace! also, make sure you have a really good mat to work on. I have one of those athletic mats and it makes doing the poses much easier than a regular yoga mat.",1280275200,3,1155,3.796680497925311
2165590,5,B000642026,"I mostly use the 15 minute bonus workouts which pack a lot into those few minutes, but when I have more free time, I'm looking forward to doing the longer ones.  What I love about these is that you can focus on what you're doing and not have to stare at the screen because the instructions are so precise: the voice-over tells you exactly what you should be doing when.",1266883200,,369,4.271428571428571
2165591,5,B000642026,"Very good sound instruction. I am new to yoga this works well with my 2 day a week classes, infact this dvd set was recomended by my instructor.
The set has plenty of room for growth. Excellent",1265760000,,193,4.243243243243243
2165592,5,B000642026,"I did Total Yoga(Original) 10 years ago and liked it. Afterwards I tried other Yoga DVDs but found this one gives the most clear instructions in breathing and form. Also, this series was shot with simple background and lighting so I can see the demonstration very clearly. Highly recommended.",1256860800,,292,4.979591836734694
2165593,1,B000642026,"I've only seen videos from Richard Hittleman before this.  For me, too much movement and not enough static poses.  Too much talking.  Not to mention that all of the DVDs have the same poses.  I wish I could have viewed this before I had purchased these DVDs.",1242432000,5,258,4.425531914893617
2165594,5,B000642026,"Really, this review would be a 3 page essay if I listed all of the bits that I enjoyed. Instead, I offer a concise snapshot.
-Fantastic price for four comprehensive practices
-Pose instruction for beginners or for form checking
-Instructor has a clear, soothing tone and offers helpful reminders during practice
-Graduated videos allow for growth, but ""easier"" videos can just as easily be used for relaxing/restorative yoga
-Good video and sound quality

My favorite basic yoga videos so far by leaps and bounds. My partner moved on to this after he finished learning some basic postures with Yoga for Dummies (he liked the extra instruction there) and I rotate these videos with David Swenson's intense, longer power yoga videos. Both of the others are worth checking out as well.",1236729600,2,782,5.015384615384615
2165595,5,B000642026,"I have had this yoga workout (on VCR) for 14 years!  I finally wore out the tape, so I'm buying the DVD.  Over the years, I've tried other yoga workouts and none compare.  This workout warms you up throughly and prepares your body for the best strengthening and stretching you can possibly get in one hour.  I couldn't recommend it more highly.",1236211200,3,344,4.5
2165596,5,B000642026,Great Job! This was a gift for a friend. It arrived on time and in excellent condition.  Thanks Alot!,1231545600,,101,4.315789473684211
2165597,5,B000642026,"I had never done yoga before, so my friend recommended this package to me. It is great for beginners who are looking to learn, as well as grow and develop into a more advanced yogi!",1208131200,,181,4.2
2165598,4,B000642026,Very nice set of 4 Total Yoga DVD's--varying levels of difficulty.  Speedy delivery from Ohio distributor.  Thanks for adding to my healthy lifestyle.,1206576000,,150,5.478260869565218
2165599,5,B000642026,I really have enjoyed these videos.  I think its a great value and they are good teaching videos.  I recommend this product.,1198108800,,124,4.590909090909091
2165600,4,B000642026,"I bought this 4 pack DVD set because it was such a good deal and I thought that I would rotate between the four DVDs through the week.  The instruction on this video is awesome, some of the best I have seen on yoga DVDs.  The other aspects of the DVD (set, music, etc) are also very appealing.  My only complaint about this (and why I didn't rate 5 stars) is that I feel the videos are too similar to each other.  They are the same poses, but in a different order.  The Fire DVD is the best, it gives a great cardio work-out as well as a great yoga session.  But, how can you not buy all 4 DVDs when it is so cheap?  But just be warned, they are pretty similar to each other.",1191196800,13,675,3.9191176470588234
2165601,4,B000642026,"... incorporating four practices progressing from a basic first lesson to a more mentally and physically challenging routine.

Earth: a 40 minute intro to a variety of basic poses and flows.
Water: similar to Earth, a little longer with the addition of a few more poses and a slightly increased tempo.
Fire: a challenge for the beginner ready to progress to intermediate; about 60 minutes with a more vigorous, continuous flow and more challenging asanas and variations.
Total Yoga Original: about the same level as Water, with interesting variations in terms of sequencing and some poses.

Each class flows beautifully and smoothly; each is soothing and yet promotes focus and challenge (especially Fire).

Each disc also includes a fifteen minute bonus practice, which I've not yet tried.

Visually, quality is high, simple and clear, with two obviously experienced but in no way intimidating yogis practicing on a plain floor against a simple background and with smooth camera work that allows the viewer to see the entire posture clearly.

Sound is great, instruction clear and precise; snippets of information are offered about the benefits of certain poses - succinctly and without emotional or spiritual content (no judgment there, just fact).  More information about placement and alignment would have been useful considering it is an absolute beginner series.

Some other yoga DVDs are one lesson with a number of yogis demonstrating various levels of difficulty for each asana/pose. That 'multi-level' DVD may serve as a reminder of the basics for more advanced yogis and a source of inspiration for newbies. Some beginners may prefer Total Yoga's four stage method as more specific to them. It may prove less confusing for a beginner who is easily distracted (or possibly disheartened) by seeing mega-flexible and strong yogis undertaking advanced postures in a non-stop flow (for a more lengthy practice) that appear impossible to someone completely new to yoga.

Highly recommended for a beginner; experienced yogis will find it more meditative than physically challenging.",1190851200,30,2086,5.319148936170213
2165602,5,B000642026,This is perfect for beginner or advanced person.  Challenging yet relaxing.  At a good balance of yoga exercises!,1190764800,,113,5.222222222222222
2165603,3,B000642026,"I have not been practicing yoga for very long, but I found that the fire practice was an excellent cardio workout.  I alternate between that and the Power Yoga with Rodney Yee. The water practice is a good intermediate workout for those slower days.  I did not like the Earth workout, perhaps because I had had some formal training where I learned the poses.  For those who are just starting out and need to learn the correct positions for the poses, I would recommend this workout. While I may not use the Earth practice video, the 4 pack is still a good value for everything that I can get out of it.",1179187200,11,602,4.357142857142857
2165604,5,B000642026,"I bought this yoga DVD set because my yoga instrutor at college recommended it. The set comes with four DVDs. There is a DVD for complete beginners, an intermediate level DVD, an advanced DVD, and a fourth DVD the instructors call their original workout. I have only used the beginner DVD so far. It provides a gentle, relaxing workout that still works my muscles, and I am very pleased with it. I like this set because it is so complete that I don't think that I will ever need to buy another yoga DVD. I strongly recommend this DVD set for people who want to do yoga practice at home.",1179100800,6,586,4.336363636363636
2165605,4,B000642026,"I am new to yoga and have found these DVDs to be wonderful.  The instructors give wonderful verbal instructions!  I am able to concentrate on the poses and don't need to be able to keep an eye on the TV to see what they are doing.  They tell you what pose you are moving into.  Even if you're not familiar with the names of the poses in the beginning, you will be after just one session!

My only criticism is that these DVDs are almost identical.  The workouts are a little different, with different lengths and minor changes, but basically the same.  So, you may just want to get one of them, although the package is a great price!",1178496000,4,633,4.26890756302521
8038257,3,B000642026,"I bought this a while ago and use 2 of the cds a lot. From day one, 2 of them were scratched but I didn't want to go thru hassle to return. It's still a good deal but beware of product being messed up.",1419379200,,201,3.590909090909091
8038258,5,B000642026,"Almost every reviewer mentioned this already, four discs for the price of one is a great value. The one person who gave this set a 1 star rating made the complaint that there is too much movement and not enough static poses.  Point well taken.  The classes flow.

The couple of things I didn't like are not unsurmountable, but worth mentioning:
1) They don't warn you ahead of time to grab your props.  But you only need to watch it once to realize if you're going to do a shoulder stand you could have your blankets nearby.

2) The advanced option is usually given on the second side, so if you already did the first side of a pose in beginner version you'll end up doing the two sides differently until you've done the sequence enough times that you remember the advanced version of the pose, lol - slightly annoying but not unsurmountable

3) Transitions are sometimes lighting fast - Tracy is working out on a  rectangle much larger than my mat, so she can turn this way and that and glide into a shoulder stand or on to legs up the wall - whereas I Need A Minute to get there.  If I were watching on an old school VCR  I could use the remote to hit pause, but these days everything is on my laptop - and I was a little annoyed by some of the fast transitions.

Worthy of Note

I did like the breath primer instructions.  I've heard people try to explain yoga breathing on many occasions and never quite as well as the way it is taught on this disc.  Bravo.  If you've got the breathing you got the most important part of yoga.  If you don't know what I'm talking about - Buy This Set! Learn how to breath when you do your yoga, you will be amazed at the difference it makes.

I liked the minimalist set, and the general lack of overpowering/distracting music.  What music there is, is very light, ambient and soft in the background.

I liked the clear instructions.  I mostly don't look at the screen when I do a yoga video because I am doing the sequence, therefore I appreciate teachers that have the skill of articulation.

I liked the different versions of sun salutes. There ones without chataranga dandasana are very good for people with weak wrists.

Other reviewers recommended this for the beginner to intermediate yoga student.  I would say, not the absolute beginner.  If you've never even taken one class, go take one. Get the basics.  It is a hard thing to learn from a disc.  Then supplement your practice with these, and go back to your teacher if you have questions on pose, or alignment. Or even if you don't have a question - just to make sure you are doing it right.",1389830400,,2597,4.358333333333333
8038259,5,B000642026,I bought these from the White Lotus Foundation's official site. They have them available in DVD format and downloadable mp4s. I love them. The instruction is great and the practice is soothing yet moderately challenging.,1382918400,,220,5.314285714285714
8038260,5,B000642026,These 4 videos are outstanding by themselves but to get all 4 for under $20 bucks was the tops!! This was my first experience with Amazon.com and it won/'tbe the last. Easy to follow videos with great results. I rarely go to yoga classes any more as my best instruction is right here at home.,1347062400,,292,4.327272727272727
8038261,4,B000642026,"I was so happy to find these Yoga Dvds...years ago I used the Total Yoga and have been searching for a new one ever since mine broke(DHS)just as good as I remember,the other dvds are a nice addition to my collection.",1334966400,,216,4.2926829268292686
8038262,5,B000642026,"I trained with Tracy and Ganga at White Lotus and they are gifted teachers. While I practice other styles of yoga as well, (Shiva Rea's flow yoga and the Ashtanga Primary Series), I always find myself gravitating back to this series of DVDs. They are balanced, complete practices emphasizing all the categories of postures (standing postures, forward bends, backbends, twists, inversions, balancing). This set contains 4 practice DVDs - allowing you to progress according to your own individual level. Earth - beginners; Water - advanced beginner; Fire - intermediate (good one to get that heart rate up); Total Yoga - good all around practice for most levels. You won't be disappointed. And the price simply cannot be beat.",1331856000,,724,5.1440677966101696
8038263,4,B000642026,"I'm enjoying my yoga DVD's, I just wish that the instructors would not go as fast.  There are many positions that have names to them and I have no idea what they are.  But I'm sure once I learn them I'll be able to go with the flow without having to look up at my screen every 5 minutes.",1329091200,,287,3.847457627118644
8038264,4,B000642026,"I got this series for a friend's birthday after she checked the Fire DVD out from the library & loved it. I've done the Earth & Water videos with her & I think they're great. Very instructional. They really made me pay attention to my posture & I realigned myself several times after realizing I wasn't getting the most out of a pose. I have't attempted the Fire one yet, my friend said it was pretty intense! But I think the other 2 are suitable for someone at any level of experience.",1325030400,,486,4.293478260869565
8038265,5,B000642026,"My introduction to yoga was from sitting in on my best friend's class when I visited him overseas a few years ago. I really fell in love with not only the exercise aspect of it, but also the way that it seemed to both energize and calm me at the same time.

When I came back home, I really wanted to continue taking lessons, but couldn't find a school that matched my schedule. My friend recommended this series, and boy am I glad that he did.

Like many reviewers have posted here, this series is user-friendly enough for any newbie, but also challenging enough for a more experienced practitioner.

If you are new to yoga, or wanting to get back into it after a lapse, I think these are great DVDs. Skip the nude yoga or weird new age-y stuff - this is the real deal. And like another reviewer said, how can you beat the price?",1320969600,,829,4.267515923566879
8038266,5,B000642026,I'm very happy with the 4 pack.  Being able to start with the foundational Earth Series and transition to the more complex series is awesome.  I was able to get in to it without feeling overwhelmed.  This is now currently part of my daily routine.,1314921600,,247,4.444444444444445
