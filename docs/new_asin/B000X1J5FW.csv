2996418,4,B000X1J5FW,"THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED
[La Residencia]

(Spain - 1969)

Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (Franscope)
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

A young girl (Cristina Galb) arrives at an isolated boarding school in the south of France where several students are believed to have run away, but were actually the victims of a psychotic killer...

Odd mixture of giallo mystery and Hammer-style Gothic, set in a labyrinthine girl's school where principal Lilli Palmer struggles to contain the passions of her youthful charges, all of whom she considers 'marked' by their sublimated sexual desires. However, Palmer is quickly revealed as a hypocrite with an incestuous crush on her handsome teenage son (played as a child-like simpleton by John Moulder Brown), and the students are forced to endure a regime which fosters cruelty, rebellion and murder.

Palmer dominates the film with effortless grace, and there's solid support from Mary Maude as the ice-cold beauty who makes life miserable for heroine Galb. Memorable set-pieces include a slow-motion murder in the school's greenhouse, Galb's doomed attempt to flee the building at midnight, and - believe it or not - an erotically-charged sewing circle! But the film reaches an apex of horror in its closing moments, when the killer is unmasked during a showdown in the attic, staged with stunning conviction by debut director Narciso Ibez-Serrador (WOULD YOU KILL A CHILD?).

But the REAL star of the show is cinematographer Manuel Berenguer (55 DAYS AT PEKING, KING OF KINGS, etc.), whose prowling camera-work makes a virtue of Victor Mara Cortezo's Gothic set designs, and the widescreen compositions are judged with startling clarity (indeed, Dario Argento's SUSPIRIA owes an obvious debt to the style and tone of Ibez-Serrador's movie). For all its virtues, however, THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is a little too leisurely in places, and the film's sumptuous visual aesthetic disguises a fairly routine plot line, spiced with 'subversive' trimmings. Flawed, but beautiful.",1254960000,16,1996,5.361022364217252

The Blu-ray presents two versions: an excellent quality 94 minute transfer from an internegative film source, and a 104 minute hybrid version with ten minutes of standard-def inserts from a slightly lesser quality print.

8226512,4,B000X1J5FW,"This Bluray of ""the House that Screamed"" is a welcome release for this hard-to-see movie. Previously only available on bootlegs or trimmed/full screen versions, it is great to finally see an official widescreen release. The Shout Factory release gives two version to choose from (more on that later), but it is the film itself that should be the draw
The plot revolves around a boarding school (the film's original title was ""La Residencia""), in which there are tensions between pupils and staff alike, and something sinister is going on. Girls are disappearing, and the climactic explanation is not pretty. The film is beautifully shot, and benefits hugely from two strengths, firstly the really effective school building, which the photography captures in many beautiful shots of decaying furnishings, clapped-out showers and ornate decor. The second asset is the fine performance by Lilli Palmer as the school headmistress, which really lifts the classy feel of the proceedings. The rest of the acting is mixed. Some are great, particularly Christina Galbo as the heroine and Mary Maude as a icy cold head girl, but others let the atmosphere down badly, sadly John Moulder Brown as the headmistress's son and a wooden performance by the actress playing the ""bad girl"" who gets flogged and has some kind of power play going on with the headmistress, which doesn't work at all because of this actress's limited ability. The movie is slow (in a good way) and there is little violence for most of it (also not a criticism), although it suddenly shifts into hysteria for the last 10 minutes, which are great.

The Shout Factory Bluray presents a standard release and an extended release. The extended release disappointed me because of how noticeable the inserted extra footage looks in terms of quality. It is quite jarring to have both the visual and audio quality drop markedly as the extra scenes kick in. Shout Factory do not hide this and have a disclaimer that explains this, but what annoyed me was that a lot of the inserts contain lower grade footage of scenes that also appear in the shorter version anyway, which I don't understand. Example: the scene in which a character attempts to open a window to escape, that ends in her death. The extended version cuts to the lower grade footage too early -  before the missing material (a few additional seconds of the actual death) kicks in, so we have to suffer a longer period of fuzzy film before seeing anything new. I am glad for the extra length (it appears to be almost 10 minutes extra), but too mush of the replacement footage is unneccessary. Another example is the opening credits: in the the extended version, the ENTIRE credits sequence is low grade, but in the short version it's the same sequence (a carriage arriving at the school ) but a lot clearer to see and read the text. The title is different (in English, ""The House That Screamed"") in the short version and looks like an obvious replacement title (it is), but for this difference we have to suffer the full 3 minutes or so of the low grade version in the longer cut that shows the original titles (in Spanish, ""La Residencia"").

It may have been hard to choose how best to present the longer version and please everyone, but I think showing low grade footage when there are clearly high grade versions of the same scenes available is wrong. Especially in the scene where Irene taunts Teresa and makes her sing which is horribly out of synch - this scene is in synch and in high definition in the short version!! Maybe to cut in and out between the two to include ONLY the missing footage and no more, no less was beyond the capabilities or budget of Shout Factory. It's disappointing because it makes neither version of the film the definitive one. One has extra footage, but sacrifices quality and watchability. The other has missing scenes but is a seamless viewing pleasure. As the film is a favourite of mine, I am glad to have this disc, but I still feel a bit let down.",1492905600,5,4002,4.738880918220947

8226516,5,B000X1J5FW,"Marvelously creepy and atmospheric 1970 horror film by writer/director Narciso Ibez Serrador about a sinister boarding school run by a stern headmistress (Lili Palmer) where the girls have been disappearing.  Supposedly they are runaways but nobody ever hears from them again.  We eventually find out that there is a murderer within the walls of the school but who is it?  The headmistress?  Her odd son?  An employee of the school? One of the other girls?  And what is happening to the bodies which are never discovered?

This might have been an influence on Dario Argento's creepy boarding school horror films (Suspiria & Phenomena) like this same director's later Who Can Kill A Child? was very likely an influence on Stephen King's famous story Children of the Corn.  Both films were favorites of mine when I was a child which is a little strange in retrospect since neither is really appropriate for someone so young.

The Shout Factory Blu-ray includes two cuts of the film--the 94-minute US theatrical version (which is preceded by the forgotten GP Rating and the original AIP logo) and a longer 102-minute version.  The transfer is gorgeous.  The movie hasn't looked this good since I saw it in theaters in the 1970's and, truth be told, it probably looks better now.  The extended version includes inserts that aren't the same high quality but the difference isn't too distracting.  Previously The House that Screamed was only available on gray market DVDs and the entire film looked no better than the extended version inserts here.  For the bulk of the film the colors are natural and the print looks new, restoring texture to the marvelously decaying mansion of a school, the period clothing that the girls are wearing and the atmospheric cinematography.  A purist might argue that if anything the picture is a little too clean, eliminating any film grain that would have been present when the film was originally exhibited--but that seems to be what most people want from their Blu-ray transfers these days.  Many people today equate film grain with bad mastering but that's actually how movies used to look when you saw them in theaters before the days of digital editing, digital projection, and digital cameras.

If this were put out by Kino it would probably look more authentically cinematic and the print might even have some lines or other flaws which remind you that you are watching an old film, but most people will likely be happier with the medium that Shout Factory finds--the print isn't remastered so that it looks too shiny, bright and digital (like the earlier Anchor Bay Halloween Blu-ray before the 35th Anniversary Edition remaster) but it's been cleansed of any flaws, save the SD inserts used in the extended version.

I should probably warn viewers who aren't familiar with this movie that the violence is actually quite tame by contemporary standards and there is no nudity, so someone expecting a gory sleaze fest might be disappointed.  But if you like atmospheric European horror (think Mario Bava or pretty much anything starring Barbara Steele) then The House That Screamed should be right up your alley.",1486684800,16,3146,4.969465648854962

The director created an atmosphere unlike any other suspense film from that period. The underlying political context that the director was making a point of makes the film that more important. The performances of the head mistress (Lilli Palmer) of the boarding school and all the young girls are believable and frightening. Special mention must go to John Moulder-Brown who plays Palmer's son. The director found in Moulder-Brown the perfect combination of youthful curiosity and the struggles of achieving manhood. The House That Screamed is one of my Top Ten horror films of all-time.",1485820800,2,723,5.407079646017699
