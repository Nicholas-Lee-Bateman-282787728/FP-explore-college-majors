8752634,5,B004O279QI,"I both attended the seminar AND have the video to remind me of it.  This DVD contains a very useful set of techniques and strategies for non-grappling martial artists.  Sensei Annesi demonstrates how to avoid being taken to the ground, and if taken down how to quickly get back up into a position of strength.  This is very useful if you're not a grappler, and more importantly if there are more than 1 attacker.  I would recommend this video for ALL non-grappling martial artists.",1358294400,,481,4.690476190476191
