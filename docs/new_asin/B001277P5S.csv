8244376,4,B001277P5S,"The Roaring Glory Warbirds series is not complete without the Mitsubishi A6m5 Zero type in my collection. I have always enjoyed the roar of the round aircraft engine, and this series has  awsome sound, (turn it up) and go for a ride in a famous ww2 fighter. What a kick if you have doby digital surround sound on your home theater. Also its a oppertunity to learn about the aircraft. Great Fun.",1367107200,,394,4.472222222222222
8244377,5,B001277P5S,"To date I have three Roaring Glory DVDs: TBM Avenger, F6F Hellcat and the B-25 Mitchell.
All are excellent productions. If you're looking for the traditional stale history of the B-25 you won't find it here, although some archival footage is added. The Roaring Glory series is a look at particular restored aircraft from a pilots viewpoint. And thats a good thing. The B-25 starts with the typical preflight walk-around with the narrator explaining what he is looking at and why. From here you're in the cockpit with the narrator explaining the various instruments and controls followed by an explanation of the startup procedures. Then its off to the practice area for some in-flight maneuvers (with narration) and excellent film footage. If you want to know what the B-25 was like from the inside out and how to fly it, this is a good DVD.",1366761600,,841,4.8068965517241375
8244378,4,B001277P5S,Archival footage was good. It's nice to be able to see these warbirds in actual flight. The walk around was interesting. The producers did a good job.,1364515200,,150,4.592592592592593
8244379,5,B001277P5S,This brought back childhood memories of WW2 when they were stationed in our town for training.  Great for we who remember them.,1312675200,,127,4.7727272727272725
