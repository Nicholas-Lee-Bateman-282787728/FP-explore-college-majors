8525741,5,B0085Z3A2W,My son's babysitter got him hooked on Chuggington. I don't like my kids watching mindlesss TV shows and with my littlest one (he is only 7 months old) this definitely takes the cake. This is the only show he stops dead doing what he's doing to watch and the storylines are so cute and teach so many lessons that I welcomed having my little guy watch Chuggington. Definitely better than Thomas the Train because there is no narrator and the trains are so cute and talk on their own they really capture my son's attention. LOVE LOVE LOVE! A must have for your little guy!!,1364774400,,570,4.438095238095238
8525742,4,B0085Z3A2W,"This is a great little video. Both my grandkids love it. It was in great condition. And we received it quickly.
they love Chuggington on Disney but this allows them to watch it more.",1350345600,,182,4.382352941176471
8525743,5,B0085Z3A2W,"My boys love Chuggington and this DVD makes it easy for them to watch their favorite trains anytime!  There are six episodes on this DVD and its great to have them on hand to watch at home or in the car.  What I like about Chuggington is that its a wholesome preschooler show that has lessons for kids such as decision making, team work, responsibility, and patience.

While my boys have seen these episodes on television these episodes feature a little of all their favorite characters.  There is lots of action in these episodes, but no fighting or bad behavior. Brewster shows off his new invention, Wilson gets stuck, and Koko saves the day are just some of the fun you will see.

In addition to the DVD, Chuggington has released their first ever 'Traintastic Adventures' collector cards and map. Now your trainee can bring their favorite Chuggers with them on the go!",1347926400,6,1002,4.7298850574712645
