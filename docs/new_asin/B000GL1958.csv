Sent is back for a replacement, it too wouldn't get past the menu.  Tried each of them on two different brands of DVD Players and with two computers using two different software players.  Even tried to rip it.  Nothing. (not the wrong region code)  Just a bad batch I guess.  Bought a playable copy from the source.",1457222400,2,438,4.671052631578948
8133331,3,B000GL1958,"It is great to see this footage of Chibana Sensei finally released. It is unfortunate that this footage was taken so near to Chibana Sensei's death (footage is actually from 1968). It is my understanding that on the morning this footage was taken, Chibana Sensei was so ill his wife had to help him put on his gi. This is testimony to his pure strength of will in performing the kata with that much dedication and focus.

There is other footage of Chibana Sensei doing the Patsai kata in 1962, but it is not publicly available. The difference between this Patsai kata footage and Mr. Lee's footage taken in 1968 is rather striking, as the 1962 film displays Chibana Sensei's legendary power, strength, and efficiency for which he was widely respected.

I will limit my critique to clearing up some historical inaccuracies from the video.

Chibana Sensei's name is Chibana Chosin or Choshin, not Chosen. I am not sure why they chose to write ""Chosen"".

Chibana Sensei's hometown was Torihori, not Toribora. Spellings of his hometown such as Toribora or Tottori-cho are inaccurate.

Chibana Sensei was not born to a modest family nor did he work the fields as a boy to support his family's livelihood. His family was nobility from the pre-Meiji era and was extremely successful in the sake business.

It is my understanding that the senior students of Itosu Sensei (Yabu Kentsu, Funakoshi Gichin, Hanashiro Chomo, etc.) were all teaching at the public schools by the time Chibana Sensei started tutelage under Itosu Sensei.  Itosu Sensei's senior students did meet to have training sessions periodically after Itosu Sensei's death.  It would probably be a stretch to call Funakoshi Gichin a ""training partner.""  Chibana Sensei always referred to Funakoshi Sensei as his sempai. That being said, Chibana Sensei's training with Itosu Sensei was probably more personal because of the Chibana family's relationship to the Itosu family through marriage.

Miyahira Katsuya was not appointed successor by Chibana Sensei, he was voted in after Chibana Sensei passed away, despite Chibana Sensei's wish for his grandson to become the atotsugi (successor).

Chibana Sensei never used ""Kobayashi"" to refer to his karate. While it can be pronounced that way, it was meant to be ""Shorin"" as tribute to the Shaolin temple (Shorin is the Japanese/Okinawan pronunciation of Shaolin). However, he believed strongly that Shorin Ryu was largely Okinawan and purposely modified the first character from the Chinese ""Shao/Sho"" so it would retain its originality.

Despite all this, nothing can take away from the fact that this is genuine footage of Chibana Sensei. I only rated this three stars because I was disappointed with the other content and general presentation.",1178496000,5,2748,5.123042505592841
8133332,5,B000GL1958,"To those in the Okinawan karate world, Chibana is a name as important as any other. Founder of one of the main schools of Okinawan Shorin-ryu, highly accomplished in martial skills and student of the great Itosu, Chibana is a legend. It was known that Mr. Lee had this film of Chibana, but it was always something of an urban legend in the karate world since so few people had actually seen it. As far as I know, it is only one of two films of the master in existence and for that reason alone it is worth five stars. On top of that, it is great quality, even color at times.

The content of this 1 hour dvd is a brief history of Chibana's life and contribution to Okinawan karate, followed by Chibana's performance of Passai, Naihanchi and Kusanku kata. Mr Lee also makes an appearance, but that is of little significance. What then follows is an interview of Mr Lee from last year recounting the details of the film's origins. It turns out that Lee was given an audience with Chibana who decided to help him learn the Shorin kata after Lee had learned them incorrectly in Japan under the Shoto-kan system (which has very little to do on the technical level with true Shorin styles, but that's another story). At the time of filming, Chibana was four or five years away from his death, dying of cancer. Even so, his movements are still sharp and focused and clearly those of an expert.

I recently watched this film with Seikichi Iha, the senior Okinawan martial artist in North and South America, a true martial expert and a student of both the great Shinpan Gusukuma (Shiroma) and Chibana's student Miyahira, both of whom were senior students of Itosu. Iha Sensei told many stories of Chibana after we watched it, talking abot how Chibana's moves differed from other students of Itosu, why they were so, how he taught in class, what his personality was like, how he used to block, etc. He was very quick to remark that Chibana was great not only for his martial skills, but more so for his martial virtue. He was a true human- kind, dignified and always looking to do what was best for his students, karate and Okinawa's reputation. This, Iha Sensei says, is the true meaning and value of martial arts- mutual cooperation for the betterment of all.

Perhaps much more could have been done to make this film even better, but its mere existence, and now publication, are of significant value to the historian/practitioner of Okinawan karate.

You may also be interested in a very impressive documentary on the teacher of Masaaki Hatsumi (of Bujinkan ninjutsu fame), Takamatsu Sensei. It is simply the best martial arts documentary I have seen and sets the benchmark for how it is to be done. Interviews, photos and old films combine to give a real sense of the man and his approach to living.
