In this video Dr. Jason Lisle, PhD. from the University of Colorado at Boulder gives a systematic presentation which describes several of the most significant assertions of evolutionists, and then provides scientific evidence that refutes the evolutionist's claims.

It is actually a dynamic video, and I am not doing it justice in my description.  I would say it is the best video I have seen for challenging the notion of evolution.  It gives evidence that challenges many different areas of evolutionary theory, and the theories that underly the evolutionists' claims.  It gives sufficient scientific evidence to provide a difficult problems for the evolutionists, without getting so bogged down in details that it would become boring and lose the big picture - and it does it all in an interesting, visually stimulating way with videos, charts, animations, and illustrations.

After an introductory statement of about five minutes, which lays the groundwork for his view, Dr. Lisle points out that evolutionists and creationists all agree that there is genetic change within species, within genus, and within genetic 'family' groups (which he roughly equates with the Biblical 'kinds').  He points out that variation within a genetic pool is not proof that variation can result in genetic changes beyond the preexisting diversity of that gene pool.  He illustrates that natural selection always reduces genetic diversity, and that the only idea evolutionists suggest as a way to increase genetic diversity is through mutations.  He also notes that no scientist has ever found even one mutation that had resulted in an INCREASE in genetic information.  (Information science is crucial to Dr. Lisle's argument, including the coding of that information in DNA.)  He also shows that uninformatarianism is unfounded as the 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens proves that thousands of sedimentary rock layers can be formed in just days rather than requiring ""millions of years"".  Mt. St. Helens also provides his evidence that radiometric dating is unreliable, since rocks formed during that eruption in 1980 have been tested and found to have all sorts of ages - some results stating that they were millions of years old, and other results saying that those rocks had not even been formed yet.

Many dozens of other topics are discussed in this DVD.  If an atheist or evolutionist or agnotic were brave and honest, and were actually interested in the challenge of science instead of just jousting with straw men, they would watch this movie - but of course, most aren't.

Yes, after the first five minutes or so, the evidence and logic are based on science
and it does it all in an interesting, visually stimulating way with videos, charts, animations, and illustrations.  I recommend this DVD.",1343174400,7,2984,5.157676348547718
8253802,1,B00140R1IY,"Science confirms creationism?  Funny!  Where do they get this stuff?  Is this material for stand up comedy or what?!  There's nothing, nadda, zilch, not one shred of scientific evidences, results or proof to support the notion of creationism.  Not even enough to qualify it as a ""theory.""

HOw I wish the superstitious would grow up!",1335139200,2,333,4.963636363636364
8253803,1,B00140R1IY,Creationism isn't science. If you want to know where we came from read Charles Darwin Origin of Species or Richard Dawkins Magic of Reality. Don't waste your money on this nonsense.,1331337600,2,181,4.870967741935484
8253804,5,B00140R1IY,it is realy fantastic and 100 persent in good codition thanks amazon. i wasn't expect as much it is amazing. i will perchase again and again another product from amazon becausa they kept their words.,1318204800,3,199,4.714285714285714
