8396756,3,B003H6Z0HC,"This is a relatively short nature documentary featuring some wilderness areas in the Balkans (i.e. southeast Europe). Both regular and more exotic animals are shown. We get to meet pelicans in the Danube delta, cormorants at Skadar Lake, wild boars trying to stay clear of land mines in Croatia, a displaced flock of rosy starlings from Asia, the rare European mink, and ravens mobbing large vultures and wolves. A few human inhabitants of the various regions have also been included, perhaps for local color. I'm not sure if Wild Balkans gives a true account of these regions, or if its a romanticized one  the DVD is promoted by references to LOTR. The show is rather slow-paced, but the quality of the footage is incredibly good. In the end I give it three stars, but perhaps it deserves more",1430352000,3,795,4.760869565217392
