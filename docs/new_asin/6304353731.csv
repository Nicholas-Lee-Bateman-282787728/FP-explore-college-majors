7870069,5,6304353731,"A 1992 film shot in ""surreal"" black and white, if you will, on location in the lower East side of New York, around the time that the ""homeless"" became an alarming new critical issue in urban areas. Has an early '70s look and tone...and this adds to the overall impact, as we realize that the same issues plaguing the streets of the city then actually got worse...following that mystical Reagan revolution, when socail services were drastically cut and the economic structure went from poor-middle-rich to poor-rich and Main Street lost out to Wall Street which seemed more interested in Japan and England than to those who served - and to all just looking for a leg up.

Rachel Amodeo takes the lead as Lisa Napolitano, first Motherless, then homeless; she's directionless on the streets; mentally reaching back to childhood as she carries her doll collection with her and reaching forward: her goal is not to find shelter or a job or ask her Brother for help, but to locate her missing mate, a diaabled Vietnam Veteran...and to visit the Statue of Liberty. Will she draw inspiration from the greatest symbol of Home?

Some of the most haunting images ever caught on film are right hee in this ""low-budget indi"". The musical soundtrack has some sombre, penetrating sonics courtesy of Johnny Thunders, who is also seen in the movie. Other ""names"" are Judy Carne, who is quite compelling and believable as a semi-homeless person, who insists that Lisa call her Brother immediately; Dee Dee Ramone, and Richard Hell.",1323561600,4,1513,4.883268482490273
7870070,1,6304353731,"I'm really getting tired of being suckered by Amazon's ""recommendations"".  I bought this as a recommendation to A Giant Leap's ""What About Me"" CD.  I didn't get what I was expecting (a DVD version of how the music was made).  I got this low budget indie flick.  Well I tried to watch it anyways, and maybe I just hate low budget indie movies with no plot other than a homeless girl wandering the streets of NY, but I hated it.  I hate it about 3X as much because I paid far too much money as well.",1280880000,4,497,4.135416666666667
7870071,5,6304353731,This DVD is every bit as good as the first 1 Giant Leap. Wonderful music and great comments. The producers assure me an American release is coming soon. They have a website. I suggest going there and signing up for more information.,1277424000,,232,4.5476190476190474
7870072,5,6304353731,"I loved this movie. Anyone who wants to know the real deal or just spent time there and wants to see some familiar faces will love it. I's about having the balls to make your dream happen for you, and it's completely authentic. Ms, Amodeo is one to watch!",1237852800,3,255,4.224489795918367
7870073,3,6304353731,"If you bear in mind that this is a low budget independent film, it's enjoyable.  It's gritty, seeing nyc's lower east side before gentrification is pretty cool, many of the scenes seem authentic, and some of the characters are very humorous.  The plot is a little choppy, the now-dead punk icons (thunders, nolan, dee dee ramone) make cameo appearances in scenes that have little to do with the plot-- but it's good to see them.  The scene with dee dee is actually so dee-dee, if you've ever seen an interview with dee dee.  Richard Hell is the exception-- he has something of a role and for once plays a nice guy (in 'smithereens' and 'blank generation' he played not very sympathetic character roles).  You also get to see Maryanne Bracken-- who plays main character ""Lisa""'s aunt (Bracken is Johnny Thunders' sister).  And the film is short enough that the weaknesses don't become too detracting to the enjoyment of the film.",1178496000,6,928,4.76875
7870074,4,6304353731,"I bought this movie without knowing too much about it because of Dee Dee Ramone and Richard Hell. I enjoyed the movie immensely. In a nutshell, a young woman winds up homeless after the aunt she lives with dies and her creepy landlord expects her to pay the rent in sexual favors. Indignant, she winds up homeless, where she hooks up with a lovable yet dimwitted partner in crime. Together they help each other survive and fall in love along the way. They meet Dee Dee Ramone, a spaced-out Vietnam vet, Richard Hell, a Good Samaritan, and Nick Zedd, a hilariously angry young man who takes our heroine in for a bit and winds up stealing the movie.  I won't spoil the ending but it's well worth seeing.",988934400,5,701,4.4765625
7870075,5,6304353731,"Rachel does a great low budget black and white gripping movie. see Johnny Thunders and Richard Hell and Dee Dee Ramone act! see the lower eastside way of life ,the plight of the homeless . how it can happen to anyone,even a naive young girl,watch her hurdled out into the night alone, begging for food and love. Great Johnny Thunders sound track see the great New York punk pioneers (most dead now) in this movie bravo Rachel. mike spent",977443200,6,437,4.544303797468355
