8592561,5,B00DEKKESG,This is a nice DVD if - like me - you are a hard core Blue Jays fan....you get the 1993 Joe Carter Home run is full widescreen glory....and an extended interview with Joe in the Special Features,1489017600,,194,4.131578947368421
8592562,1,B00DEKKESG,"The 25 Greatest Postseason Home Runs was a good idea, but when executed falls short of the mark of similar lists, in that is does bring any additional debate to the list. It justlists them. The disc is fine from a technical perspective and the additional interviews are nice, even if they are a touch redundant. But if you want to discuss a list of the 25 greatest homers in baseball postseason history, it is just better to do it at the bar rather than spending an hour watching this.",1391904000,,485,4.4
