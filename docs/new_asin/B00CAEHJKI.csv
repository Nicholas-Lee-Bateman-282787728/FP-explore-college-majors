5709561,4,B00CAEHJKI,"This video is a t introduction to gymnastics for kids. My children (8,5,& 3) really enjoy watching it and working out with it. My only complaint is that the gymnastic coach sings songs the entire time. The songs are absolutely darling but the coach's voice is horrible. She should definitely stick to gymnastics.",1384732800,3,312,4.90566037735849
5709562,4,B00CAEHJKI,This was what I was looking for  for my 3 year old.  She enjoyed this kids in this dvd and the teacher was great.,1379289600,3,113,3.6666666666666665
5709563,3,B00CAEHJKI,"I purchased this for my 4 year old daughter, who has been doing gymnastics for a few months.  It's an enjoyable dvd - the presenter is keen, friendly, up-beat and entertaining, and she introduces the skills in a fun and safe way for kids to try at home.

I'd say, however, that the whole tone is really aimed at the under 4's.  The songs go on a *bit* too long and are a bit too childish for my 4 year old, who wanted to know more about each skill, and how to practice it, rather than hear about it in a song.

The other disappointing aspect of this dvd is that, in many of the skills the presenter is demonstrating, the shot is framed in a such way that the lower half of her legs are cut off...which means when she's trying to show what a lunge is, for example, you can't actually SEE the lunge.  The show then cuts away to a whole heap of very gorgeous little kids, all trying the skill at home...but none of them are doing it correctly either.  So if you're watching and trying to learn, you never actually SEE a corrent lunge shape.  This happens several times, and my daughter got a bit frustrated with it.

If I'd bought this for my 2-3 year old, who hadn't yet started ""real"" gymnastics, I would be really happy with it.  But it fell just a bit short of the mark for us in our situation!  Other than that, it's a fun dvd, and I would still recommend it to the under 4's.",1378684800,11,1378,4.127340823970037
5709564,5,B00CAEHJKI,"My boys love gymnastics! Because of Kari. The sounds are ver engaging and keep my boys on tasks dn learning the warm ups stretches and gymnastic exercises. I love that they can exercise their bodies in a fun way without me having to pack them I. The car to run them to another event, activity, performance, game etc. because it is at home and so convenient to turn it on at home. Where we love there are not many options for boys to learn gymnastics so this is a great option. For girls and boys who are in gymnastics this would be a great review for your child. I highly recommend this DVD.",1377648000,,591,4.238938053097345

8579242,5,B00CAEHJKI,"The first time I watched it, I rated it 1 star, because it was such low-quality production, and I found the singing so cheesy.  The second time I watched it, I upgraded it to a 3, because the video kind of grew on me.  And despite its shortcomings (ex. the instructor's body being truncated by the camera angle so that you can't see her legs when she's explaining ""lunge"", or the kids executing the moves incorrectly), I now rate it 5 stars, because my 3-year-old daughter loves it and asks to watch it frequently, and is inspired to take gymnastics lessons.  What better results can you hope for from a product like this, other than to inspire a child!",1436054400,8,653,4.470588235294118
8579243,4,B00CAEHJKI,"Great starter video. Way more advanced than I thought it would be. My girls are two and it takes them all the way from the basics, stretching, jumping, lunging summersaults, to cartwheels! Well work the money. I only wish they spent a little more time on each exercise with more children in the video. Sort of jumps around too much to remain focused. Parents definitely have to be involved. I am scared to do a handstand again! My girls are going to be there in a couple of weeks I bet-",1421280000,2,486,4.351648351648351
