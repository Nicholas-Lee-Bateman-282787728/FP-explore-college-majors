8015292,4,B0001MZ700,"Arrived quickly. This is ""The Genesis Project"" of the Old Testament redone by Reader's Digest. I wish they would have kept the voice from the original narrator, whose voice was more reverent. Also, some of the ad-libs added are not as accurate as they could be. Wish they had kept the Aramaic, Hebrew in the background, but don't think they did; if they did, it is very low or inaudible. Basically purchased for the three ""Genesis Project"" videos: 1. Abraham; 2. Isaac and Jacob and Esau, and 3. Joseph and His Brothers. The other videos included are good... but not the calibre of the original ""Genesis Project"". Some of the interpretations of Scripture are wanting or misinterpreted. Overall, would recommend to Bible-literate folks. I would purchase from this company again.",1471651200,,777,4.984615384615385
8015293,1,B0001MZ700,"This is a different version than the original.  The original narrator had an amazing voice and read from the King James Bible.  Reader's Digest must have purchased this from The New Media Bible and decided to dumb it down.  The authentic music and the bible verses read by an amazing voice, have been replaced by an annoying narrator who tries to explain the stories for a pre-teen who's never read the bible.  I've been waiting 15 years for these films to be converted to DVD, and now I'm extremely disappointed that they've been ruined.  I will be buying the VHS and converting it to DVD myself.",1318982400,9,597,4.59433962264151
