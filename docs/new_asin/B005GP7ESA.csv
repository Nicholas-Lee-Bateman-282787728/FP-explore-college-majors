Finding a Family is a true story about the hardships and perseverance in overcoming the turbulent home life of a young boy and his sick mother.

An ambitions single mother  Ileana Chivescu (Kim Delaney) works hard to make a life for herself and her child Alex.  Through hard work she supports him, earns a PhD, and then gets a job as a professor.

When he is ten she is injured in an automobile accident and is seriously hurt.  Ileana  develops bipolar disorder from brain injuries.  She reacts to her medicine and suffers severe effects that eventually cost her job, home, and the custody of her son.

Alex (Jared Abrahamson) lives in and out of foster care, while his mother is in and out of hospitals.  Despite hardship Alex concentrates on his school work where he excels and dreams of attending Harvard University.

Kim Delaney is effective as Ileana, convincing both as a strong, determined and loving mother and as a delusional, out of control  fanatic.  Jared Abrahamson is consistent as the driven student and troubled son.  The story is told well.

I recommend Finding a Family for those who enjoy Hallmark films.  The movie is mostly sad as Alex struggles to survive.  This is an inspiring story.",1322352000,9,1210,4.740384615384615
4693112,3,B005GP7ESA,"This movie was suggested by a friend.  I watched it twice in one evening to make sure I was not being overly critical.  It is a true story.

The acting was average.  ""Alec"" was played by a personable young man with lots of talent.... but in critical scenes where I was tearful, his eyes were dry in spite of the sadness his face was portraying.

The final graduation scene left me feeling very sad for the ""Family"" who had done so much for Alec.  Alec  walks away from them to his old roommate from the orphanage and the bus driver... and finally to his bio-mom... the one who had  her parental rights terminated at Alec's request.  The ""Family"" is never seen or heard from again.  I felt sadness for them.

Finally, there are incomplete credits at the end.  Many of the actors are not identified.... including the youngster who portrayed the young Alec....

I was left wishing for more for the ""Family"" who had done so much for Alec.  I wondered if there was any ongoing relationship or if it was over now that Alec had used them to reach his goals....",1321920000,11,1053,4.416666666666667
4693113,5,B005GP7ESA,"This movie had me in tears most of the time. It shows the sides of many characters including a boy named Alex who dreams of attending  Havord, his friends and family. All who want to see him success. Alex's childhood isn't easy. He is raised by a woman who was in a wreck and in result suffers with depression so much so that she can't raise Alex on her own. He is sent to live in a home while he waits and hopes for a foster family to adopt him. Alex's mother attended Harvard before the wreck and it is the school Alex dreams of attending. This movie is about his struggles to success and the many things in his life he must get through first and how he comes to accept these things. This movie is a very emotional movie. I think just about anybody would enjoy watching it.",1462147200,,775,4.166666666666667

8472089,5,B005GP7ESA,"This is a wonderful, heartwarming movie, about a boy who substituted academic success for the close and loving relationship with his mother that he was deprived of after she was badly injured in a car accident.  When budget cuts threaten to prevent him from returning to the school that has become ""family"" to him, he seeks out a family to live with closer to the school. But instead he finds himself accepted into a loving and accepting home with parents who can give him the love and stability his mother was unable to provide.  This presents a challenge to both Alex and his newly found family.  After repeated separations from his mother, his ability to let the new parents in is compromised by the traumatic fears he now has. Will they too be taken from him?  He tries to block them out but they persevere, and toward the end you can see the beginnings of a trusting bond with them forming.
  One of the overlooked but probably very significant parts of this movie is the statement Alex makes to one of his high school friends that his mother is recurrently hospitalized after going off her medication because they don't have insurance, and therefore there is no resource for ongoing treatment for her. She does the best she can as long as she can, without the help she needs, and also without the ongoing blood tests that would show if there is a problem with her medications, until things blow up again.  There are some red flags in this movie that most people miss that indicate his mother may not have been accurately diagnosed and that the medications she is on really are making the situation worse. For example, I have never heard of anyone developing bipolar disorder as a result of a traumatic brain injury. Bipolar disorder is a chemical imbalance in the brain. It may be more likely she had it prior to the accident and the stress of the accident exacerbated her existing mental illness. Also, every time she is re-hospitalized she has what Alex refers to as ""alligator hands,"" where her hands seem to be frozen in a certain awkward position. This is not a symptom of bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is marked by extreme mood swings. But it can be a symptom related to the medication she is taking.  The lack of affordable health insurance causes two lives to be ruined needlessly. If they had access to affordable health insurance things probably would have been very different for both of them.",1475884800,,2415,4.665882352941177
