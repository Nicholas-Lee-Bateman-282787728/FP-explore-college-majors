3557216,5,B001ER4CNO,"Budd Boetticher's classic westerns finally arrive as a set in nice clean transfers.  They are long overdue in a digital format and have been highly anticipated by  film buffs as well those who treasure a view of Americana that includes honor, duty, horses and the landscape -- the majestic canvas on which we play out our lives.

The films have been detailed elsewhere.  My favorites are ""RIDE LONESOME,"" ""COMANCHE STATION"" and the ""THE TALL T.""  They all feature Randolph Scott's as a consistent hero with different names.  A hero in a changing world who still operates under a moral code that seems quaint.

On a side note: What or who is the ""tall T""?  It is never mentioned in the film.  I can't recall if it is mentioned in Elmore Leonard's story ""The Captives.""  Personally, I think the ""T"" is part of the architecture of the ranch where Scott rides a bull.  It is prominent in one particular shot.  And it is tall.  Why this is the title of the film is a puzzle unless it is here where the story is set in motion.  Or perhaps it is a physical body gesture that Scott makes at a place in the story that is a turning point.  It is a human crucifix position as well.  Perhaps that is the reference -- like John Wayne's crossing his arms at the end of ""The Searchers,""  about which there is much speculation (some think it's an homage and tribute to his friend Harry Carey).

There's a clean, sun-baked look to these morality tales that sort of frames the simmering tensions that are usually played out in an explosive climax.  Often in a natural ""arena"" setting.  Boetticher was very enamored of, and comfortable in, a bull ring.

The underrated Randolph Scott is perfect as a taciturn, leathery-faced loner.  He was a big star in his hey day -- but he has never been better than in these minimalist westerns.  He's always a man of few words who often has a tragic back story that propel his risky, usually altruistic, actions.  Scott is a rivetting screen presence.  His graceful, economic physicality, the way he uses his voice, rides a horse, and especially his moments of silence and stillness are always compelling.  There are no wasted actions.  Hard to take your eyes off him.  In many ways, I think Scott was Boetticher's on-screen avitar.

Boetticher's recurring elements: a lone figure seeking vengeance or justice,  figures adrift amidst an untamed  landscape, tight places where moral imperatives explode.  And always in Boetticher's westerns, there are unexpected moments where the camera holds on the physical beauty of a place or dotes on the sensuous image of a horse being groomed or running.

Boetticher, a cult director who continues to grows in stature, makes the most of his deceptively minimalist stories inhabited by complex characters.  But it's not really the story that matters for Boetticher as much as the characters, how they move, and what they don't say, and of course the ever-present broad landscapes that offer unexpected moments of challenge or transcendence as the moral imperative of the protagonist is actualized.

It seems to me that Boetticher's westerns are about coping with antiquated notions of honor and justice while traveling a path where fate, destiny and free-will intersect.  I guess that's why they linger in the mind.  There's an undeniable Old Testament feel to the stories yet the main character is often saddled with a sense of existential angst.  Maybe that is the definition of living in the post modern world.

For movie buffs and film scholars alike, the late Budd Boetticher is a giant, widely praised for the seven low-budget westerns he made starring Randolph Scott between 1956 and 1960.  What's even more amazing is that these B movies were crafted with such loving care and precision.  As in other art, overlooked at first, but now recognized as unique and authentic perhaps because they seem effortless and pure even to the naive viewer.

While working on the Columbia Pictures lot on Gower St, I got to know Boetticher quite well.  He liked a script I wrote and invited me to ride one of his fine horses, Peropo, a spirited, unscarred veteran from the Spanish bullring.  I apparently passed my test and this led to trips to Mexico where we scouted locations and Boetticher put on astonishing displays of how to fight bulls from horseback. During this time, I understood how much of Boetticher the man was in his westerns. Always the outsider who won't compromise, Boetticher was the real deal.  Enthusiastic, witty, optimistic, artistic and a great horseman -- he relished being alive.  He was also aware of a self-destructive side to his personality that was always a battle.

His bare-bones westerns usually had a lone, mostly silent, somewhat alienated hero on a journey through a hostile landscape.  He crosses paths with a self-serving villain.  There are tight places and grand vistas, lyrical moments and pastoral surprises.

Existential and ambiguously emotional, there remains a moral tone that somehow revolves itself around idealized integrity itself.  In fact, integrity, grace and fate were Boetticher's cinematic trinity.  Burt Kennedy's sometimes ironic, often poignant, and decidedly lean screenplays were a perfect fit for Boetticher's mindset.

The extras in the set are very good.  The feature length documentary on Boetticher ""A MAN CAN DO THAT"" is revealing and rather moving.  A portrait of a singular artist and man who lived a full adventurous life that in some ways makes his movies seem tame.  There are three commentaries, I especially appreciated the one by Janine Basinger on ""THE TALL T.""  She captured the essence the man as I knew him.

I encourage film buffs to also find Budd Boetticher's classic 1956 western SEVEN MEN FROM NOW (Paramount) which was released earlier on DVD in a clean, restored transfer with significant extras.  This should be included along with this set.  Here, Randolph Scott, a sheriff haunted by the death of his wife in a robbery, hunts for the seven men responsible. Along the way, he helps a couple from Kansas heading west and is forced to deal with another former outlaw he had once sent to prison.  As in some of his other films included in this collection, SEVEN MEN FROM NOW is a tense journey that takes us to a point of stillness, the moment of truth where righteousness of character is all that's left because ""there are some things you can't ride around.""  The esoteric commentary's by James Kitses, author of ""Horizons West: Anthony Mann, Budd Boetticher, Sam Peckinpah"" and there's a new documentary ""Budd Boetticher: An American Original.""",1225584000,21,6583,4.8969258589511755
3557217,5,B001ER4CNO,"Great product, brilliant films, I`d love to order the box, but as I`m from Germany, I couldn`t play the films here.
Yes, Europeans love good western movies too, seems a bit out of place to produce them just for the American/

3557218,5,B001ER4CNO,"OK, so you like westerns and you have been busy building your collection of the genre on DVD.  Well, your collection will reach a whole new level when you purchase the long-awaited DVD release of the Boetticher/Scott westerns.  These are cult films among western movie viewers for simple yet profound reasons.  First, as author Jim Kitses notes in his outstanding review of Boetticher's films in his book ""Horizon's West"", the films are exciting and thoughtful morality plays that uniquely involved villians that are just as sympathetic as the hero(s).  Second, they represent the idea that despite being driven by obscure motives that can at times prove fatal for unfortunate acquaintances, the honorable individual matters.  These films represent the true soul of the western genre, an amazing achievement by Boetticher.",1224633600,9,822,5.341085271317829
3557219,5,B001ER4CNO,"As a lifelong Western fan, I've been waiting many years for these films to be released on DVD. Four of these are in the top 30 or 40 greatest westerns ever made... I just don't understand why it took them so long. Now I hope Warner Brothers releases WESTBOUND, I know that its easily the worst of the 7 (Scott / Boetticher) films, but it should be released, so the collection is finally complete. By the way, its still much better than most of the other (WB/Randolph Scott) westerns already on DVD.",1223942400,9,498,4.423913043478261
3557220,5,B001ER4CNO,"I had the pleasure of meeting both Burt Kennedy and Budd Boetticher at the Lone Pine Film Festival many years ago.  Sadly neither are still with us but their great films are.  The Lone Pine scenary still looks today as it did when these films were made.  This is a long awaited addition to my Seven Men From Now dvd.  They are great films.  It is too bad that Randolph Scott is often under rated as an actor because I can imagine no one else in these roles.  Kennedy's scripts are on the mark and Boetticher added his special ""magic"" touch from the director's chair.  A must for any western film fan.",1222992000,8,600,4.303571428571429
3557221,5,B001ER4CNO,"After the Batjac release of SEVEN MEN FROM NOW, a welcome announcement of the rest of Scott/Boetticher collaborations will be available in one collection.  These were small films in their times -- a feature that would probably be less than 90 minutes and play before the main movie.  As time has gone along their fame has steadily grown and it is now accepted that several are among the most important westerns following in the wake of the 1950 Stewart/Mann classic, WINCHESTER '73.  Infact the Mann/Stewart westerns and the Randolph Scott/Budd Boetticher films have a similar sense about them.  Scott and Stewart are usually men on a quest, generally involving revenge.  I would say that Stewart's characters are for the most part, bitter and cynical.  Scott still tend to be moral pillars. The most strikingly different of the lot is DECISION AT SUNDOWN. In this one Scott is tracking the man he feels is responsible for his wife committing suicide. He gives her qualities she never had and ultimately discovers the truth.  But, all in all,  if you love the western than this collection will make a solid addition to any library.  You'll also be treated to a wealth of fine actors: Richard Boone, Henry Silva, James Coburn, Claude Akins, LQ Jones and so many more. Extras include a documentary on Boetticher, intros to the films by Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorcese,and Taylor Hackford. Terrific transfers, you really get the sense of the wide open spaces as Boetticher intended. If you enjoy these films -- impossible not to -- I'd recommend the Stewart/Mann collaborations: WINCHESTER '73, BEND OF THE RIVER, THE NAKED SPUR, THE FAR COUNTRY and THE MAN FROM LARAMIE.",1220486400,40,1668,4.949820788530466
3557222,5,B001ER4CNO,"In the late 1950s, the ""Adult"" western was at its zenith. There were several men responsible for this (James Stewart and Anthony Mann, notable among them), but three men stand out - Budd Boetticher (director), Burt Kennedy (writer) and Randolph Scott (actor). Scott, along with his partner, Harry Joe Brown, produced them through his production company - Ranown Productions. With Scott, Boetticher, and often Kennedy, they made seven westerns - the Ranown Westerns - that stand as the model for the genre, and set the stage for the more realistic (and often more violent) westerns that would come in the 1960s (films like Sam Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"")

Two of these seven Ranown westerns are not actually from Ranown, though they were made with Scott, Beotticher, and Kennedy. Those two - Seven Men From Now (1956) and Westbound (1959) are not in this set. The other five are. I have seen each, and here is my take on them.

""The Tall T"" (1957) Ranown starts off with a bang. Perhaps the best of them. Scott was never better. Richard Boone played the heavy - I'd say the best of them in all the Ranown westerns. Henry Silva is also very good as another heavy. Maureen O'Sullivan was perfect in the female lead. A great early story from Elmore Leonard. Boetticher did a great job directing a taut, lean story, scripted by Kennedy. Many say it was the best of the Ranowns. This film includes a horrible way to ""dispose of"" two people (father and his young son) that is not shown, just described. The horror created by the description is more frightening than anything you could feel if you actually saw it.  While there may be one Ranown western that was as good - ""Commanche Station"" (1960) - none were better.

""Decision at Sundown"" (1957) A misfire. Scott again plays the lead, a man who was wronged long ago by the villain. But in this film, he has no one to play off of. John Carroll is ordinary as the man who wronged Scott. Karen Steele, an extraordinary beauty, plays the female lead, but there is little she is asked to do, other than look extraordinarily beautiful. There is very little action, and surprisingly little drama. Altough Boetticher did his best (he himself said it was the weakest of the Ranowns), it is telling that this film is one of the Ranowns that Burt Kennedy did not script. All in all, this film is the most forgettable of the 5 in this set.

""Buchanan Rides Alone"" (1958) Getting better. Not great, but good. Also, possibly the funniest of the set. The eulogy that Pecos Hill (LQ Jones) gives for one of his ""friends"", whom he has just killed to save the life of Scott is simply not to be missed. At the end of it, Scott says the only thing he can say that could top it. While the plot is not too strong - Scott is fine, but there are too may heavies to focus on the classic good vs. evil conflict that is necessary to all good drama. Actually, outside of Craig Stevens, none of the villains were very notable. And there is no female lead to speak of. All in all, this poorly constructed story, albeit with some very amusing quirks, is good, but no more.

""Ride Lonesome"" (1958) Very good. Not the best, but very good. Scott plays a wronged man who is now a bounty hunter. He captures an outlaw with a price on his head (a great turn by James Best). By the way, this is a Kennedy script. How do you know? When he captures the outlaw (Best), the outlaw says ""whatever they are payin' you...it's not nearly enough"". To which Scott replies, ""I'd hunt you free"". There is another outlaw that figures into this - Best's brother, (a young Lee van Cleef, also great here). Pernell Roberts and James Coburn (his film debut, Scott, the producer, liked him and expanded his part) are also very good, although Roberts is a bit too mannered in his acting of some of his scenes. Karen  Steele is the female lead here also, and is given more to do. She is quite good here as well. One more thing: The final scene is perhaps the most memorable image in all the Ranown westerns.

""Comanche Station"" (1960) Perfect. The last of the Ranown westerns, perhaps the best (though some might give that distinction to ""The Tall T""). An excellent story (again, a great Kennedy script). The ending is one you will not see coming (kudos to Kennedy and Boetticher). A perfect performance from Scott - a man accepting a task that defies explanation - until you learn why. Claude Akin is excellent as the heavy - not quite as good as Richard Boone in ""The Tall T"", but close (his smile is pure evil). Richard Rust was also quite good as the young heavy, trying to reform. And the beautiful Nancy Gates is perfect - especially in the scenes where she and Scott are alone - in the female lead. What makes this a great film is the direction by Boetticher, working with another great script by Kennedy. It is filled with great scenes, and there are no weak scenes. Most important, the story is distilled to perfection. Boetticher included only those scenes that were needed to advance the story and cover the themes he wanted to illustrate (courage, determination, and, above all, honor). And he included no scenes that were redundant or otherwise non-essential. This is the mark of a great director. Scott was so good in this that he retired afterwards, only to be talked out of it to make one more film - the classic ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) with Joel McCrea and directed by a young Sam Peckinpah. Then he retired for good. Even if he did not make that final film, ""Commanche Station"" would have been a perfect swan song for Randolph Scott.

Seeing these five films, plus two others - ""Seven Men From Now' (1956) and the previously mentioned ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) - will give you an appreciation of why Randolph Scott and Budd Boetticher have such a high reputation among a growing number of classic film lovers.",1219968000,139,5829,4.543809523809524

3557237,4,B001ER4CNO,"Many positive reviews have been given to this set.  So consider this one a reinforcement with some additional information.

My first encounter with Randolph Scott was through a 16MM Technicolor print of ""DECISION AT SUNDOWN""...one of the 5 titles in this collection.  I immediately liked it and ran it through my projector several times.  Fast forward 25 years to ""The Films of Budd Boetticher"" starring Randolph Scott.  Even though the plots portray Scott as ""the lawman who rides (or walks) off into the sunset"", there are other consistancies present.

These include beautiful photography, the music of Heinz Roemfeld (in 4 out of 5), and terrific character actors including Claude Akins, Richard Boone, Andrew Duggan, Nancy Gates, Maureen O'Sullivan, Lee Van Cleef and Karen Steele (who was married to Budd Boetticher for awhile).  The fact that most of these were 'cranked out' in less than 2 weeks and managed to look better than their bottom half of a double feature 'b' status is also a tribute to Budd and Randy,

THE TALL T and DECISION AT SUNDOWN were released in 1957.  Scott stays true to his code of no-nonsense seriousness by attempting to keep survivors of a kidnapping alive (in the first) and coming to grips with the memory of the wife who cheated on him in the second.

In BUCHANAN RIDES ALONE (1958)...Mr. Scott goes against type and in a lighthearted way revolts against a corrupt border town.  Without spoiling the plot, the entire town is under the control of one family who believe charging high prices for everything...including water...is okay!  [Insert political comments here if you want to]?

RIDE LONESOME (1959) was Budd and Randy's 1st Cinemascope collaboration.  It was also James Coburn's first feature film.  Bounty-hunter Scott attempts to bring a killer to justice while almost falling in love with Karen Steele. There's plenty of violence...expected and unexpected...between Scott, 2 brothers and hundreds of indians.

COMMANCHE STATION (1960) was another Boetticher/Scott cinemascope film.  I had a difficult time concentrating on this one.  Probably because it seemed to take forever for the plot to get in gear.  Scott locates a kidnapped white woman (Nancy Gates) whose husband has put up a ransom.  Unfortunately, the chief of the tribe has already taken the woman for his wife. In spite of horses and other goods that were swapped to get her back, the chief doesn't really want to give the lady up.  Claude Akins' character is one big pain in the neck!  He also wants the white woman for himself and won't shut up about it!  While I love Burt Kennedy's television work, this film seems to take FOREVER until the final 10 minutes. Though the ending is touching, this was the weakest of the 5.

Do I recommend this set? ABSOLUTELY!  But to fully appreciate Boetticher and Scott's talents...don't watch all of 'em back-to-back.  Give yourself a few days between each. This way you'll appreciate the Scott-Boetticher colaboration even more.",1360108800,2,2980,5.030612244897959

The three stand-outs are Ride Lonesome, The Tall T and Commanche Station.  Each of these is tautly directed and scripted, making great use of the landscape and pitting the Scott character against a charismatic bad guy.  In each, he stands between the evil-doers and a vulnerable woman. These films are gems. The other two in the set, while clearly a cut below the three just discussed, are still worth a look.  They're more conventional films and lack the punch of the Burt Kennedy scripts which distinguish the three better movies.

3557244,5,B001ER4CNO,"COMANCHE STATION:

If The ""Tall T"" is bleakest, and ""Ride Lonesome"" a fan favorite, then ""Comanche Station"" (1960) is the most poetic and artistically accomplished of Boetticher's Ranown cycle of westerns.

This was the valedictory film for Ranown and was intended to be actor Randolph Scott's as well (two years later he was talked out of retirement to make the superbly sublime, but slightly overrated ""Ride the High Country"" with director Sam Peckinpah and co-star Joel McCrea).

Scott emerges from a cubist landscape, first as a majestic silhouette, then as Orphee's haunted, chiseled ghost, continuing his vain, ten year search for a (most likely dead) wife, abducted by the Indians.

The native Americans here are portrayed as little more than savages, and Nancy Gates, the heroine he winds up rescuing, is a delicate object of prized beauty, rather than fully human.  These quibbles aside, once again Boetticher's stark, stripped down sense of composition is replete with complex characters and ambiguous mores.

Randolph Scott embodies a beautiful purity here, more so even than in the other entries. His endless years of wandering through the vast, arid, western desert, searching for his lost wife echoes Orpheus searching for Eurydice in hell, or a seemingly pointless purgatory.

Comanche Station is a brooding post modernist work which stems from allegories found in the most potent, forceful biblical tales and mythology.  Claude Akins is the primary, King Saul-like villain, who has committed mass murder, intends to kill both Scott and Gates, does not hesitate killing his own man, and yet admires Scott and even saves him from a terrible fate.

Skip Homeier and Richard Rust are Akins' latent homosexual henchmen (in a poignant scene, Akins complains to Scott of Homeier's ""softness"").  The  scene in which Homeier carefully lifts Rust's dead, arrow-ridden body from the creek permeates a tender fragrance such as one found in the story of David and Jonathan from the biblical Book of  Kings.  Homeier is touchingly simplistic, not truly wanting a life of crime, but clueless as to any other way of life.

Scott's hero looks like a figure culled from a Cezanne canvas.  He is at first misjudged by Gates, but will eventually be her savior, reuniting her with her family, the stains and scars of her past laid to rest. There is no such redemption for Scott.  Station ends where it begins, and the tree from the finale of Ride Lonesome reappears here, symbolically haunting, in the middle of a river.

Pessimistic repetition is the Kafka-like curse of Scott's ghost who will never find his wife, nor even a destination.  The final scene in Comanche Station, like the Ranown cycle, sears itself into memory.  Hopelessly undervalued by the bulk of mainstream audiences and critics, but for the rest of us, as blasphemous as this may sound, a brief period by a group of artists, lead by obsessive, inimitable auteur Budd Boetticher, that rivals the best in American cinema (and, yes, that includes the films of John Ford).

RIDE LONESOME:

""Ride Lonesome"" (1959) was the first of Boetticher's  ""Ranown"" cycle to utilize the new CinemaScope process, and it does so impressively.  The rich color and expressionist framing of desert canyon rock would only be topped in the series' final entry, Comanche Station. Most fans of the cycle consider Ride Lonesome the best entry.  While that remains debatable, it is certainly, in terms of composition and pacing, the most perfectly structured.  It is also the most elegiac and, surprisingly, optimistic.

Amongst a memorable cast, Lee Van Cleef etches out an unforgettable, albeit brief, performance as the murderous brother of  James Best (later known as the bumbling deputy in the TV series Dukes of Hazard) , who is prisoner to Randolph Scott's bounty hunter.  Naturally, things are more complex than they seem.  Scott wants Cleef to catch up with them and for a very personal, startling reason: Cleef hanged Scott's wife  years before.  Along the journey Scott meets up with the beautiful Karen Steele, and a pair of pseudo-outlaws in Pernell Roberts (Trapper John M.D) and a shockingly young  James Coburn (his first film).  Roberts and Coburn want Best for themselves, since turning him in, dead or alive, will gain them amnesty from their crimes.  Naturally, there is sexual tension between Steele and Scott, yet the potential for relationship is doomed by Scott's obsessive thirst for revenge.

Ride Lonesome is, easily, Boetticher's most optimistic film (as optimistic as Boetticher can be and still be Boetticher).  Scott's eventual handing over of Best to the two repentant outlaws is a pleasant surprise.  The villains are hardly two-dimensional.  Cleef, having committed a heinous crime, earnestly begs for his brother's life, only to fall on Scott's deaf ears.

The four males desire and vie for the widowed Steele (her husband having been murdered by the Apaches).  At first she is mere ornamentation, as the women in the Boetticher films sometimes tend to be. Later, Steele's character somewhat evolves into mother, latent lover, comforter, but short of fully developed person. Full development of female characters and weak scoring are the two biggest flaws in the otherwise outstanding Ranown cycle.

Boetticher still finds time for adroit comic touches amidst the overwhelming ironies and the final, haunting, lyrical image of the burning tree that Scott's wife died on.  Steele leaves her protector there, in the desert, alone.  He will never be happy, nor find contentment.  Indeed, one is left with the ominous feeling that the ravaged Scott himself will die there, never leaving this spot.  This final shot sears in the memory.

To summarize: Ride Lonesome is as optimistic as Boetticher can be and still be Boetticher.

THE TALL T:

Shot in a mere twelve days, The Tall T  is one of the most remarkable westerns in a decade that unquestionably belonged to the western genre.  Burt Kennedy scripted a pure, taut, and crisp script from an Elmore Leonard short story. The Tall T  is an actor's film. The first surprise lies in Maureen O'Sullivan's performance as homely, whimpering Doretta Mims; a performance that can almost be seen as a bookend to her far different, equally superb performance as the independent, strong-willed, sensual Jane of Tarzan and his Mate (1934).  Here, she is the newly married, timid wife of unsympathetic louse John Hubbard. By film's end she emerges from self-pity's well, dress coming off shoulder, hair loosed down and radiating a fire akin to Prometheus unbound as she is pressed up against the pure, granite-hard, phallic form of  Randolph Scott.

Scott's character is one of his most interesting and fully developed in the Boetticher cannon. The film opens with Scott visiting  friends at the Way Station.  Upon Scott's departure, the young , amiable, grandson of the station manager gives the laconic cowboy a penny for some rock hard candy from the town store. Naturally, the good-natured Scott promises to do so.  However, on the way back to the station, Scott, more animated than normal, loses his horse in a bet in a scene evoking archetypal good old boy western humor.  The calm before the proverbial storm.

Taking a stagecoach on the way back to the station, Scott has a bit of camaraderie with old buddy and stagecoach driver Arthur Hunnicutt (a character favorite in dozens of westerns, he typified the grizzled sidekick) who is transporting newlyweds O' Sullivan  and her louse husband;,John Hubbard (surprisingly, a standard stock coward, nowhere near as developed as Walter Reed's similar character in Seven Men From Now ).

Waiting at the Way are three villains in the form of Richard Boone, Skip Homeier and Henry Silva, plotting  mayhem. After the trio kills Hunnicutt, Scott discovers they have butchered the grandfather and grandson,disposing of them in the well. The killings, wisely,  are never seen and the interplay of dialogue between Scott and Silva is deftly handled, seething in angst; ""  And where is the boy?"", `In the well!"".

Hubbard is disposed of after displaying an all too eager willingness to ransom off his wife. There is honor even among the likes of these. Boone's character, fully capable of committing vicious, cold blooded murder, begins to seep through the mask and facade, revealing a character that Scott empathizes with. Boone  is tired of his two young comrades, and, likewise, he identifies with and admires Scott, despite the knowledge that he will have to kill both him and the woman.

The sexual tension between O' Sullivan and Scott inexorably builds as they are forced to sleep  together while planning  their survival. Scott does not want to kill Boone, but stoically acknowledges what is certainly forthcoming.  Even henchmen Homeier and Silva reveal added, fascinating  dimensions to their characterizations.  Their desperate dreams and goals are revealed, only to be reminded later that they killed an innocent old man, a young boy and they plan to kill again.

The Tall T , like Seven Men From Now, consistently surprises and magnetically draws the viewer into these characters and it's compellingly rich bleakness, so much so that  the finale, as inevitable as it is, evokes true, emotionally heightened dread.

The Tall T is sculpted by the hands of a master craftsman.

3557251,4,B001ER4CNO,"Director Oscar ""Budd"" Boetticher made his mark on the American film scene with his gritty westerns starring Randolph Scott.  Boetticher's films didn't make much of an impact at the time, but the critics now say he defined a genre... the rugged, mysterious loner wandering the dreary landscape and looking for... solace?  redemption?  atonement?

This collection of Boetticher's films contains five full-length films: The Tall T (1957), Decision at Sundown (1957), Buchanan Rides Alone (1958), Ride Lonesome (1959), and Comanche Station (1960).  You'll recognize some actors who became stars themselves following this exposure.  And you'll experience gorgeous scenery, much from the southern Sierra Nevada mountains and the Lone Pine area.

The combination of the ""archetypal"" western and the decade these films were produced (the 1950s) resulted in films that clearly are not ""politically correct"" today.  Native Americans were the bad guys, and women were to be rescued and ogled.

Boetticher didn't whitewash the living conditions of these cowboys.  They were dirty, poorly educated, and without polite social norms.  You'll see lots of campfires, with that pot of camp coffee always boiling, and the coffeepot the last thing to be packed.

""B"" movies to be sure, but these films are a part of the western fantasy, and our history.",1255132800,3,1333,5.386473429951691

3557255,5,B001ER4CNO,"Review of ""Budd Boetticher Box Set"" on DVD.

First, simply put, this is a superb set of Randolph Scott / Budd Boetticher films containing some of their best work.

Second, the print quality of the various widescreen aspect ratios look great and are a welcome relief from past pan & scan VHS releases.

Third, the packaging. And this is very minor compared to actually having these wonderful films on disc. What were they thinking? I hope when the Blu-ray release comes around a few issues are addressed. Yes, Budd Boetticher is a superb director and his name without a doubt deserves to be on the package. But the star of all these films (and co-producer with Harry Joe Brown) -- Randolph Scott -- without a doubt deserves similar credit above the title. If nothing else, as a marketing tool to sell more units. I would venture to say that Scott's name has wider renown than Boetticher's. Together, they made some great films which happen to be westerns. Also, it would be great if future repacking would also replace the awkward overlapping double disc mounting with something less cumbersome. Please. Thank you.

All that being said, this is a *superb* (and waaaaaay overdue) set of films by a great director and a great actor. Top notch films. It bears repeating. This is a *superb* (!) set of great films.

I thank Sony (THANK YOU, SONY!!!) for releasing these treasured classics!

These are very taught tales told in 80 minutes or less.  They just happen to be westerns.  While a good long movie is great, if the material supports it, too many movies are padded out to hit the 100 minute mark.

This cycle is a variation on a single theme of a stranger riding into a situation with an agenda. Sad events have occurred in his past. The stranger is played with stoic, steely determination by Randolph Scott. His craggy visage echoes the beautifully photographed western landscape. Subtle expressions communicate much beneath the surface about his character and suffering. The stories are layered with unexpected twists that constantly keep one's interest and make one yearn for more. Performances are uniformly excellent from the iconic Scott through the various villains(who at times reveal characteristics similar to the hero)such as Claude Akins, Richard Boone and Pernell Roberts. Above all is the expert direction of Boetticher who reveals himself a true artist in the same league as Ford or Hawks.

3557269,5,B001ER4CNO,"In the mid 1950's Director Budd Boetticher came together with ageing star Randolph Scott to make a remarkable group of B-Westerns under the banner of RANOWN Productions, the name was made up from the names of Randolph Scott and producer Harry Joe Brown. The first of these was SEVEN MEN FROM NOW  (1956) a Batjac (John Wayne) Production. This film was painstakingly restored and released as a Special Collector's Edition in 2005.

This five-film Budd Boetticher Collection in production order is: THE TALL T (1957) DECISION AT SUNDOWN (1957) BUCHANHAN RIDES ALONE (1958) RIDE LONESOME (1959) and COMANCHE STATION (1960) Of this group the first and last two films stand out above the rest not least because they all have a cracking script by Burt Kennedy as did the aforementioned SEVEN MEN FROM NOW. These four films have gained a cult following over the years and can be regarded as mini-masterpieces!

Boetticher's characters in these films are not the usual B-Western hero / villains stereotypes, in most cases his heroes are flawed and the villains not all bad which is helped by a strong cast of supporting actors including the likes of Richard Boone, John Carroll, Craig Stevens, James Coburn and Claude Akins. Of the leading ladies Karen Steele (Mrs Budd Boetticher) appeared in two of the above Westerns others included Valerie French, Maureen O'Sullivan and Nancy Gates.

Randolph Scott is the obsessive stoic hero in these little seventy-odd minute dramas. On the release of the marvellous COMANCHE STATION in early 1960, Scott decided to rest on his laurels and retire. He was persuaded two years later to climb back in the saddle once more for Sam Pekinpah's wonderful RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY (1962) along with fellow veteran westerner Joel McCrea.

All five films here from Sony Pictures and the Film Foundation have been digitally re-mastered and special features include a Budd Boetticher Documentary, The original theatrical released trailers and commentaries by Taylor Hackford, Martin Scorsese and last but not least Clint Eastwood.

3557271,5,B001ER4CNO,"Western fans will rejoice over the long awaited release of THE FILMS OF BUDD BOETTICHER, a 5-disc set from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.  The films are five of the seven legendary westerns that director Boetticher made with Randolph Scott.

Back in the days when I was a Hollywood publicist, Budd Boetticher was one of my clients.

Budd was a very interesting man who told me many stories about his years in Hollywood.  He was also very open about his self-destructive nature.

At the time we were working together, he was talking about suing Universal Pictures over TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA, the 1970 Clint Eastwood/Shirley MacLaine western that was directed by Don Siegel.  According to Budd. he'd sold the original story of that film to the studio with the proviso that he would also direct and Universal had reneged on that part of the deal. [I don't recall how the matter was resolved.]

Budd also told me how he came to direct WESTBOUND (1959), a Warner Brothers film and the only one of the Boetticher/Scott movies that is not yet available on DVD.

""I offered to direct the movie for nothing,"" Budd said.  ""I wanted to protect my star.""

The last time I saw Budd was a couple of months before his death.  I'd acquired a lobby card from THE TALL T, already signed by Scott, and I wanted Budd's signature on it also.  The framed piece now hangs prominently on my living room wall.

The TALL T (1957) is one of the films in this new set from Sony.  Arguably, it is the best of the director's collaborations with Scott, who plays a down-on-his-luck rancher, taken hostage with Maureen O'Sullivan by Richard Boone and his gang.  The outlaws had planned to hold up the stagecoach, but have instead decided to ransom the lady back to her wealthy father.

Henry Silva co-stars in the Burt Kennedy-written film.

Like THE TALL T, both RIDE LONESOME (1959) and COMANCHE STATION (1960) were both written by Kennedy and were filmed in the scenic Lone Pine area.

Scott plays a much darker character in these films, as he did in DECISION AT SUNDOWN (1957).

In RIDE LONESOME, co-starring Karen Steele, Pernell Roberts and (in his film debut) James Coburn, Scott plays a bounty hunter, bringing killer James Best in to be hung.  However, before he can do that, he has to deal with marauding Indians, outlaws led by Best's brother and Roberts, an outlaw himself who by bringing in Best can get amnesty.

COMANCHE STATION finds Scott rescuing Indian captive Nancy Gates and bringing her back to her husband, who has offered a reward.  Again, in order to do this, he must fight even more Indians, plus baddie Claude Akins and his buddies, who want the reward for themselves.

Both DECISION AT SUNDOWN and BUCHANAN RIDES ALONE (1958) are primarily set in a town.  SUNDOWN has Scott in what is perhaps his  most complex role.  He rides into town to kill John Carroll, the man he hold's responsible for the death of his wife.  But, Carroll ""owns"" the town and Randy soon finds himself holed up in the livery stable.

Karen Steele, Valerie French and Andrew Duggan co-star in this one.

In the light-hearted  BUCHANAN RIDES ALONE, Scott arrives in a corrupt border town and finds himself in the middle of a blood feud.  Craig Stevens co-stars.

If you love westerns you will want to own this set, which also includes an excellent feature-length documentary about Boetticher.

3557272,5,B001ER4CNO,"Budd Boetticher was a remarkable director.  Sony Pictures, in their Collectors Choice set, ""The Films of Budd Boettcher"",  presents five remarkable films that are still powerful today.

Including ""The Tall T"", ""Decision at Sundown"", ""Buchanan Rides Alone"", ""Ride Lonesome"", and ""Commanche Station"", this set is visually stunning, highlighting the natural beauty of the Lone Pine area.  ""Ride Lonesome"" and ""Comanche Station"" resonate  a theme central to his films, the lone hero seeking revenge and redemption.  Randolph Scott stars in all five films, portraying to perfection the strong, silent hero.

In ""Ride Lonesome"", Barricade (Scott), goes after a man with a bounty on his head.  Behind his apparent cold blooded nature, his real motive of finding the man who hung his wife is exposed in the end, and what was once a case of pure bounty, becomes an act of grace and forgiveness.

Future director Burt Kennedy penned the bulk of these films, honing his craft with a director with an eye for sparse storytelling, and a cast that understood what Boetticher was creating.  Scott was essential to the films, adding his reputation and experience to roles that screamed ""Randolph scott!"".  Images of Scott atop his animals, or silhouetted against the desert sky are vintage western iconic symbols.  Co-stars James Coburn, Maureen Sullivan, Lee Van Cleef, Pernell Roberts, and Richard Boone contribute good performances to great films.

Watching these films is a pilgrimage experience.  The Lone Pine settings, used in hundreds of films since the early 1920's, has been transformed into a more urban setting.  When Randolph Scott rides by the familiar rocks of the geological formations, images of other films flood by.  Randolph Scott appearing onscreen beckons me to a time when legendary actors rode the silver screen range, and westerns rode tall and proud in cinemas around the country.  Principles were fought for and died on.  Men of moral standing became outstanding community builders.
This is a collection for the collector of great films, though not all are of equal quality.  The prints have been restored to brilliant color and sound.  Watch these films, but if you have access to a big screen, I mean really big screen, go for the gusto.  There is nothing like Randolph Scott riding tall on any screen!
