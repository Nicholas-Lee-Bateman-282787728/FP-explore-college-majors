43305,5,078311530X,"MGM presents ""THEY GOT ME COVERED"" (1943) (95 min/B&W) -- Starring Bob Hope, Dorothy Lamour, Lenore Aubert, Otto Preminger, Eduardo Ciannelli, Marlon Martin & Donald Meek

Directed by David Butler

Robert Kittredge (Bob Hope) is the Moscow correspondent for a major American news service, who is fired when he neglects to file a report about Hitler's invasion of Russia. Hoping to get back in the good graces of his boss Norman Mason (Donald MacBride), Kittredge steals another reporter's story about a Nazi spy ring operating in New York.

An excellent Bob Hope vehicle with Otto Preminger good fun as the head Nazi, Otto Fauscheim. This was Hope first starring role for MGM - he followed up a year later with The Princess and the Pirate (also directed by David Butler).

Bob Hope in his prime and the one-liners provided for him here are classics. The often underrated Miss Lamour shines as a Lois Lane-type reporter. She and Hope have fabulous chemistry together and their comic timing as a team is impeccable. David Butler again proves he was one of Hollywood classic era's most capable and underrated directors. Wisely, they allow the villains to play it straight to give this mostly light film a serious(but not too much so) undertone which makes it seem edgier and thus more effective as a comedy thriller.

Best scene is when Hope and Donald Meek playing an addled old caretaker who believes the Civil War is still going on. The two of them reprise a couple of old burlesque routines in Abbott and Costello style.

43306,5,078311530X,"I suppose the enormous reputation and popularity which Bob Hope achieved with the American people has already faded and will continue to do so. Thus it is with most ""Icons"" who have not established a cult identity. Nonetheless, for about a half-century, no entertainer was ""bigger"" than Hope over-all, although the occasional challenger, a Jackie Gleason or Marilyn Monroe, might share that eminence.
This is not among the best of his films, but it is characteristic of how well he sells his wares. Brash, highly verbal, adaptable to physical comedy, good-looking enough to make it credible that he should get the girl, but, with a face that doesn't meet the Robert Taylor-Tyrone Power standard of male beauty....by a long shot. The script for his mystery-thriller-adventure films is followed in this relatively early one (World War 2 period) as does the expression of some of his central characteristics as a comedian, aggressive women chasing, bumbling, defeated,  victorious, almost by accident, cowardly but brave when he has to be. It was a winning combination in all his media of choice.
His co-star, as often was the case, was the lovely, talented Dorothy Lamour, one of his co-partners on the highly successful Road pictures; they were supported by an assortment of character actors, led by Otto Preminger, soon to become a leading director of films, amd Eduardo Cianelli, an actor of great skill (see his superb performance in the mid-thirties production of Winterset) who made his living for many years as a tough gangster,although he did a fine job,many years later,as Sophia Loren's father,in the Cary Grant comedy. Houseboat.
So, not a first rate comedy, but quite a good one, pretty sure to give you an hour and a half of pleasure.",1273449600,2,1745,5.038062283737024
43307,4,078311530X,"THEY GOT ME COVERED is a great wartime Bob Hope movie.  Released by RKO, THEY GOT ME COVERED successfully teams Dorothy Lamour and Bob Hope in a Second World War spy romp.

Hope plays a disgraced reporter who is looking for a big story to make amends for his failure to take notice of the German invasion of Russia.  Escorted out of the company's New York bureau, he enlists Lamour in the Washington D.C. office to assist him investigate a tip about Axis sabotage plans.  Hope is drawn further into the investigation than he plans and continuously calls on Lamour and her friends to bail him out. Hope ultimately succeeds in foiling the spies and regains his reputation.

Until I recently ordered this movie it had been several decades since I last saw this film on television.  Previously this movie was only available as part of a Bob Hope box set.  Had it not been for the fact that I already owned several of the movies in the set I would have purchased it.  I was happy to stumble on a stand-alone copy of the movie.

I am also a big fan of the Hope and Crosby ROAD pictures.  After watching THEY GOT ME COVERED and MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE I quickly realized that the real comic talent in the films of that decade was Bob Hope.  It is no wonder that for a while he was one of the highest paid stars in Hollywood.

THEY GOT ME COVERED is a product of its era.  Expect the usual stereo-typical villainous German, Italian and Japanese spies.  No one back then could have anticipated the longevity of comedy films and political correctness had not yet been coined.  Buy the DVD, watch the film and laugh.",1269216000,13,1602,4.438356164383562

43309,5,078311530X,"As a French (currently living in Switzerland), I have never had the opportunity to be that familiar with Bob Hope and his humor, therefore I bought this DVD at random...and I simply hit the ceiling ! First of all, on the technical point of view, the transfer is absolutely exceptional (when you'll watch the trailer, you shall see the difference !) , glorious black and white, great sound with lots of dubbing (Argh !) and subtitles.
The story is very light but amusing, typical of those WWII comedies and the lines of Hope...Mama mia ! you can die for them !
It is so hilarious that I already watched it twice in 3 months
So do not hesitate to purchase it , even if the price ... appears to me to be too excessive ...",1024963200,22,718,4.325925925925926

7790019,4,078311530X,"While THEY GOT ME COVERED is a diverting and often very funny Bob Hope wartime comedy, its not in the same league as his top efforts like THE GHOST BREAKERS and MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE.  Like some other Hope vehicles, it was not conceived with Hope in mind.  Producer Sam Goldwyn originally wanted Cary Grant for the lead (when the project bore the title WASHINGTON STORY) but when Grant was unavailable, Goldwyn decided to turn it into a vehicle for Hope, which explains why the results are an uneven  mix of seriocomedy and wacky ROAD-picture tomfoolery.
At the end of the film, Hope kicks a Japanese saboteur in the seat of his pants and says, in an overdubbed line of dialogue, ""That's to save your face.""  Yet the original line""That's for Pearl Harbor""is still easily lip-read.  No idea why the line was altered.",1500076800,,814,4.704225352112676

Also without a doubt, one of the very best Bob and Dorothy Lamour collaborations. Silly and funny? Absolutely which gives it that wonderful touch. Let's also toss in Otto Preminger and Lenore Aubert as the evil and vile Nazis here in this country plotting against us. far-fetched sure but let the intrepid Robert Kittridge (Bob) his gal, Dorothy Lamour, her 5 roommates and then the Marines, Navy and assorted other government agencies for the big finale.....well you have to see it.",1439337600,4,677,4.844827586206897
7790026,5,078311530X,"PLOT: Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour fight Nazi Spies in war time Washington DC.

Bob Hope is a very LOUSY World War 2 reporter who sends a telegram to his paper saying that RUSSIA WOULD NOT BE INVADED which loose him his job due to his bumbling.
He ends up back in the USA and FIANCE (Dorothy Lamour)together end up on a HOT tip. There are AXIS spies in Washington. The tipster gives his story and it is taken down in a rare shorthand and this ends back in the ""hands"" of the spies who cannot read it. LOL So they Axis Spies set out to discredit Kittredge (HOPE) by a very unwilling married to a blonde stripper~ who makes him a 'laughing stock' and he is totally discredited ....(again ).... Included in the spies are Otto Premenger as the Nazi and Leonora Aubert as the SEXY ""brains"" of the spies. Hope has his BIMBO bride killed by the Nazis to keep her silent and her flowers are a ""clue"" Hope and Lamour trail to the Nazi 'hideout' of a Beauty Salon. This is fun included are a ""war time black out of Washington DC"" and pun of Bing Crosby singing a tune from a music box. Clever and one of Hopes BEST screw ball comedies.  At last on affordable DVD.

Also try My Favorite Blonde.",1357516800,4,1182,4.221238938053097
