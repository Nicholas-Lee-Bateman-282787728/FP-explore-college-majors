2525480,4,B000EOTVBQ,Both 70's classics give you a view of great action and adventure. The females are fierce and the action is plentiful. The sound tracks will live forever.,1400630400,,153,4.703703703703703
2525481,5,B000EOTVBQ,"THIS WAS OLDER THAN I EXPECTED BUT IT WAS STILL INTERESTING AND GREAT FOR COMPANY (ADULT) TO WATCH. LIKE IT, FUN TO WATCH AND TALK ABOUT TOO.",1389657600,,141,4.2592592592592595
2525482,3,B000EOTVBQ,"Have not watch this all through through yet, will follow-up with more information once i have watch it more but you can't go wrong with Pam Grier",1367539200,,145,4.407407407407407
2525483,1,B000EOTVBQ,"If I could give this a zero, I would.  I wish I could return this.  Its a highly  unrecommended movie.",1361145600,2,102,4.0
2525484,4,B000EOTVBQ,"I was a teenager during the genre and fell in love with all the heroes, heroines, and villains alike. Thank you for making a happy customer.",1350950400,,140,4.423076923076923
2525485,5,B000EOTVBQ,Thank you Amazon. Black Movie's from the 70's are great. I will order more through Amazon. Can't beat the price. Already have ordered several others.,1348617600,,149,5.0
2525486,3,B000EOTVBQ,The movies were ok as for as the content but the quality of the picture on both movies was very bad.  Needs to be digitized or something.,1314921600,,137,4.074074074074074
2525487,5,B000EOTVBQ,"This was a great film in my opinion. I love black movies of the 70s. But that's just me. I always thought Foxy Brown and Christie Love were the best back then. But Jeanne Bell did a great job! She reminds me of a female Jim Kelly. The story slowly gathers momentum but is easy enough to ride along with. She really begins to kick ass as time moves forward. And even the black guy co- star seems pretty interesting. They throw in a curve here and there and end with a predictable climax. But for the 70s, this was a good one!",1312070400,12,524,4.097087378640777
2525488,3,B000EOTVBQ,"The main attraction for this double feature is ""TNT Jackson"".  Diana aka TNT travels abroad to seek revenge for the death of her brother.  She discovers that her brother was mixed up with some serious drug dealers.  This tough lady uses karate to survive in this male dominated movie.  The movie is action packed and also stars Stan Shaw as TNT's love interest.

The script really is good, even though the film is low budget.  If you are a fan of black soul cinema movies from the 1970s (black exploitation movies) then this is a must have for your collection.  You get two movies for the price of one (just like the theaters offered in the 1970s).  The second movie is ""The Black Godfather"".  It is what it is.",1207094400,9,711,4.449612403100775

2525490,5,B000EOTVBQ,"The movie was what I expected - blaxplotation at its finest. The quality of the movie was horrible. I understand that is an old flick, still, the color changes, the lines through it and the overall quality was disappointing.",1432512000,,224,4.769230769230769
2525491,5,B000EOTVBQ,Thanks so much. I thought it was great and it was good to re-visit the not-to-distant past!,1424563200,,91,4.411764705882353

8112176,3,B000EOTVBQ,"It's what I expected, typical Blaxploitation quality, which is poor visually and audibly.  The storylines were predictable but disconnected at times. Again, typical of the genre.",1464998400,,178,5.846153846153846

8112179,4,B000EOTVBQ,"Problem was quality of the picture, which is low VHS, watchable but not ideal. You need to ignore some of the issues of the 70's time, like a Chinese bar owner with an obvious Philippines accent, some HK thugs speaking Mandarin instead of Cantonese (at times mixing the 2), almost comedic fight scenes, not well choreographed... The picture and acting is good for that period.",1439078400,,376,4.8
