7988204,4,B00008Z6VO,"A normal WWE DVD released in Japan usually goes like this. Take a Region 1 DVD, add Japanese subtitles, and then convert to NTSC Region 2.
Basically this WWE Royal Rumble 2003 DVD in NTSC Region 2 is nearly the same as its Region 1 counterpart because the DVD Menu remains in English, English and Spanish commentary with Japanese subs, footage is the same as you remember it.
I was surprised to see the Japanese commercial of WWE SmackDown SYM on PS2 found on this DVD, because it was cool seeing how Yukes' advertised some WWE products in Japan.

Otherwise watch the WWE Championship Match because it's one of Kurt Angle's best matches on this decent PPV. WWE Network or not.
However, the only music WWE dubbed on all Royal Rumble 2003 DVDs is just Edge's theme because back then his current theme was Never Gonna Stop by Rob Zombie. Same thing persists on WWE Network but they also dubbed other entrance themes such as 3MW, Dudley Boyz, and Maven's.",1421971200,,951,4.594117647058823
