1644795,5,B00005Q30F,"The Autumn Heart seems to be a real story that happens to be a movie. Ally Sheedy is extraodinary and intense in her portrayal of an angry, hurt young woman who lives with trauma and a generation of lies from her parent's divorce. This movie is not comfortable entertainment, but is a genuine and meaningful look at relationships, so you definitely have to be in the mood for the movie, but I definitely recommend it. If you haven't seen Ally Sheedy since the 80s you'll be blown away.",1001376000,4,485,4.5227272727272725

7949748,4,B00005Q30F,"SPOILERS AHEAD.  BEWARE.

That being said, I went into this movie with very low expectations.  I hadn't heard anything about it before, so I thought it was just another Lifetime type movie.  Well, if it were on Lifetime, you wouldn't be able to hear half of the movie due to the swearing.  :P  However, if you can get past that, the movie can be quite good.

It basically begins when a School bus driver who is very close with her daughters, and their children has a heart attack.  This leads to a spiral of memories of past regrets, and lies.  When her children were young, she, and her husband divorced.  The mother stayed with the daughters, and the father cared for the only son.  The family became estranged from each other for the majority of their lives.  However, the girls are aware that their father is doing well financially.

The mother, pretty much knowing that she wouldn't make it for very long, even if she did survive the heart attack, wanted to re connect with her son, to inform him that she never stopped loving him.  This is where the past regrets come into play.  The 3 dutiful daughters agree to locate their brother for their ailing mother.  The 2 younger daughters are quite happy to meet up with their brother, and even with their father.  The initial meeting for the siblings goes quite well.  The brother seems delighted that his sisters want to meet up with him.  However, the sisters know that their brother and father have become quite successful, while their part of the family has struggled.

The eldest sister is quite bitter towards her father, as one would naturally be. It doesn't help matters that their mother told the children that their father abandoned them, and never bothered to send any money their way all the while, taking care of their brother, and making sure he went to the finest schools, and never wanted for anything.

Well, as the movie progresses, the mother passes away.  Throughout the movie we are present for many seemingly unneeded moments.  However, it shows how different the children grew up, yet the still hold unconditional love for each other.  During the wake for their mother, the father comes to pay his respects to his children, and is immediately thrown out of the house and verbally bashed by the eldest daughter.  The brother, finally having his fill of her anger, picks his inebriated sister to the upstairs bathroom, sets her in the tub, and turns on the water.  He tells her that she doesn't have to like him, but she has to respect that their father is still going to be around in his life.  The two other sisters come up to break up a potential fight as the brother storms out.  Still the eldest shows her disdain for their father, when the middle sister throws a box full of letters at the oldest sister.  As she does this, she screams that their mother wasn't perfect, and that their father did in fact try to stay in contact with them, but was railroaded at every turn by their mother.

The eldest daughter takes some of the letters and rushes over to her fathers house and angrily brandishes a letter that she never received.  She demands to know if he did in fact write the letters, and asks why she never got them.  This conversation is where my heart broke.
She cries as she throws the letter at him, and in a childlike voice asks ""What is that?!""  As if that letter is the one missing link to her life being complete, and now its too late to interrogate her mother so she can find out the truth of it all.

This scene made the movie in my opinion.  It was raw and cold, and heartbreaking. Beyond this scene, I don't remember much, due to the tears, and cry baby sobs.  (Don't judge me.)  Though I'm sure it ends on a positive note.",1358380800,2,3717,4.502242152466367
7949749,2,B00005Q30F,"OK, I can keep my opinions to myself and not get lots of ""not helpful"" votes or I can say what I think even though it's different from the other reviews. I'll choose the latter. So here it is:

Lots and lots of swearing, really bad, fake accents, really dumb idea of the lower class, lots of unexplained situations.

A father leaves his wife and three daughter but takes his son. The males do really well, while the females do really badly. Why were the children split up? Why would the wife not take financial support from her ex?

We never find out. The main lesson of this movie is how women who don't fully appreciate men are taught lessons.

A father who hasn't seen his daughters in decades says to his son ""I can't believe you would do this"" and ""How dare you!"" for inviting them. Then, we learn that he's really the good guy who tried to see his daughters but was obstructed by his ex-wife who apparently had the ability to stop him from seeing them even as adults with children of their own. Why would she not let him see the daughters but would let him have the son - even though she seems to love the son, is another mystery.

He tells the daughters that his ex-wife could have been as successful as he was if only she wasn't so bitter. Instead she drives a school bus, babysits her grandchildren, has a heart attack, suddenly longs to see her son and asks her daughters to go and find him, and then, though the heart attack was supposedly mild, dies. I guess that's lesson #1 for uppity women. Don't worry, there's more.

The future mother-in-law of the son is taught a lesson by her husband - for saying that the sisters can't sing at the wedding - by refusing to drive her home and leaving her with no transportation, in the suburbs at 11:00pm.

One of the daughters who dares to be angry at her father is lifted up by her brother at her mother's wake, put in the bathtub and soaked in her clothes, then told off by her sisters.

This movie is supposed to be a tear-jerker. I enjoy a good tear-jerker now and then. I found this movie to be full of caricatures, and to be sexist, manipulative, tripe.",1338249600,2,2113,4.318181818181818
7949750,4,B00005Q30F,I really enjoyed this movie as a Thanksgiving Holiday Celebration of the season. There are so few of them compared to all the Christmas movies. The sisters shine in this movie being everyday common women trying to make it through hard times and family trauma and drama.,1331424000,,269,4.74468085106383
7949751,5,B00005Q30F,"This movie has a lot of ""heart"", it portrays families at their best and worst. Each character can be found in most families, the movie caused much laughter and tears. Very Good, Worth the watch!!",1220313600,,195,4.6
7949752,5,B00005Q30F,"This is an excellent movie! It has drama, comedy, terrific acting, and a timely lesson on divorce and the way we handle it. It's a poignant example of how childhood experiences influence adult emotions and behaviors. NOT just a ""chick flick""! I highly recommend it!",1214870400,,265,4.911111111111111
7949753,4,B00005Q30F,"Tyne Daly is the blue-collar mother of three grown, distinctly blue-collar daughters, each strong in her own way (and loud--the setting is Boston).  Ill and apparently thinking she may soon die, Daly asks her daughters to find their brother who left with his father at age six, sixteen years earlier.  The sisters are initially resistant, feeling their father abandoned them, and are even less pleased when they learn their brother is studying at Harvard, but they agree for their mother's sake to make contact.  Turns out father and son have done very well and become very white-collar while the women have remained not so well off.

The narration at the beginning made me think this might be a preachy film about the evils of divorce, and there are elements of that, some even delivered by a preacher.  But the bulk of the film is more about a clash of cultures, sisterly and other family relations, and reconciliations.  The story unwinds somewhat in the fashion of a mystery, though a good deal of what we might expect to learn never comes to light.

The cultural differences are a source of tension and comedy, with one sister in particular, flamboyant and irrepressible, bringing humor to almost every appearance.  Though all the acting is strong, Ally Sheedy, as the most bitter sister, remains central by her place in the script and the intensity of her acting, which some have found to be overdone, others to be a tour de force.

Much of the drama is open to such a division of response by viewers: it's seen as contrived, predictable, superficial, maudlin, or as real, unpredictable, with genuine heart.  I think there is ample ground for all of those reactions.  The film won the audience favorite award at the Nantucket Film Festival but was panned by some critics.  I find Sheedy an engaging screen presence and was drawn in by her portrayal.  The film did remind me of some ""family-friendly"" films but was harsher and edgier at times.  It's marked by several emotional outbursts and resolutions that will make some cry and others cringe.  Not everything rang true to me, but most was true enough, and I generally enjoyed it.

The DVD is still available new though Amazon (and elsewhere); just do a search under the title.  Though unrated, there is not much that would raise attention with a rating board: some swearing, occasional drunkenness, smoking, a little casual drug use.  Oh, and a fairly chaste male strip tease.  It would probably rate PG-13.  The script was written by the actor who plays the brother.",1191283200,,2526,4.816705336426915

7949755,5,B00005Q30F,"When Ann and Lee divorce, Lee takes his son, Daniel, and Ann raises the 3 girls, supporting them by driving a school bus, while Lee and Daniel move around the country, losing all contact with the family as years go by. The film starts with Ann having a mild heart attack, and while hospitalized, she wants to know what has happened to her son, and asks her daughters to track Daniel down. A collision of emotions and cultural differences are the result of this search, with years of hurt and many misunderstandings rising to the surface.

Written by Davidlee Wilson, who stars as Daniel, some of the scenes are over the top (the bridal showers scene for instance, though it is nevertheless quite hilarious), but most of the dialogue is very real and poignant, and the brilliant ensemble cast makes the most of it. Excellent are Tyne Daly as Ann, Maria Sucharetza as the flamboyant, slightly trampy Diane, Marceline Hugot as the down-to-earth mother of 4 Donna, Jack Davidson as Lee, and Lisa Keller as the woman Daniel is going to marry. It is Ally Sheedy as the tough, outspoken Deb, full of deep resentment for a father she has always felt abandoned her, that shines above all, and makes this little film special, and at times a wrenching experience.

Nominated for a Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, and directed by Steven Maler, ""The Autumn Heart"" will resonate with people who have experienced the breakdown of a family, where communication has been replaced with confusion and silence. Bravo to this fine cast of actors, who make their characters live, and draw the viewer into the story, often with tears and laughter.",1128729600,5,1640,4.77112676056338
7949756,5,B00005Q30F,"This ia a movie that deals with the effects of divorce in a powerful way. Everybody knows the effects of divorce on a child. But this movie explores the effects on children who are now adults. It centers around three sisters (Ally Sheedy, Marla Sucharetza, Marceline Hugot) who decide to grant what becomes their mother's last wish: locating their long-lost brother (Davidlee Willson). They find him studying at Harvard. But before bringing him to meet his mother (Tyne Daly) they decided to get acquainted with him first. They have no grudges against him, but Deb (Ally Sheedy) has plenty of anger at her father for having supposedly, abandoned his family. Ally Sheedy gives a performance worthy of an Oscar, complete with a phony accent. Deb's anger at her father apparently has escalated over the years, and she rants and raves at him, without allowing him to tell his side of the story, which reminds us that there are two sides to every divorce. Only after her mother dies does she learn the truth. The scene towards the end where father and daughter are emotionally reconciled is touching, powerful and heartbreaking, and further proof that Ally deserved an Oscar.  Now Deb's anger is directed at her deceased mother, for not having told her the truth. This movie serves as a lesson that we should be honest with our children no matter their age. And if secrets are taken to the grave not much can be resolved for the living. This DVD has nothing in terms of special features but don't let that stop you from seeing this profound movie. It will be worth it.",1109116800,3,1563,4.725274725274725
