3063224,1,B00118SUIO,"Lame bands like the ones featured on this DVD are responsible for the death of the true NYHC scene. These bands (VOD being the exception)are glorified metal bands.  25 ta life? please....horrible singer, terrible lyrics, awful musicianship.  District 9?  Who has even heard of these clowns? What a bunch of morons. Real NYHC = Gorilla Biscuits, Agnostic Front, Murphy's Law, Cro-Mags, Warzone, Youth of Today, Token Entry, Sick of It All.",1221436800,7,438,5.140845070422535
3063225,4,B00118SUIO,"Douglas Mallach a hardcore and ska musician out of Houston told me to catch this movie. He is a great musician, and I thought if Douglas Mallach thinks highly of it, it's worth trying out. He was right. It's a great movie. If your a musician or just an avid enthusiast, it's worth seeing.",1215993600,,288,4.351851851851852
3063226,5,B00118SUIO,"I have been waiting for the DVD release of NYHC Documentary for the last decade, and I am completely pleased with the final outcome.  I bought the VHS version back in 1998 at Generation Records in NYC, and have since then watched it endlessly.  As the technology has changed along the 21th century, the DVD format was well called for.

If you have the VHS version, there should be no explanations for it.  The highlights include the hilarious District 9 interview, Madball playing ""Crucified"" with Roger Miret, and the fight during Crown of Thornz.
In addition to the VHS contents, there are a great deal of the addition in the live footage of Corny Island High in 1995 (Madball - 4 songs; Crown of Thornz - 3 songs; VOD - 2 songs; 25 ta Life - 3 songs, and so on), which is very good, because I thought the VHS version had too much interviews.  There are also the deleted scenes, mostly interviews.

The disc 2 is worth checking out, since there are all new footages.
There are new interviews with Agnostic Front, Madball, Sick Of It All, H20, and VOD.  There are also very short footages (only 4 mins) for the Last Rites of CBGB in 2006.  I wish they had added more live performances for this CBGB show.  Also, they should have included the interviews and performances from other crucial NYHC bands that had also contributed a great deal to the scene around the year 1995, such bands as Warzone, Killing Time, Breakdown, Sub Zero, and H2O.

Overall, this documentary has been a true dedication to the revival of New York Hard Core, and should be an instant addition to your wishlist!",1213660800,5,1585,4.549295774647887

For someone who grew up as a SXE kid going to shows and being part of the scene, this movie has been like a flash back to those I have met, those who have inspired me, and those that i just flat out have been scared of.

8240956,1,B00118SUIO,"This is to Daddy Punk or Punk Daddy . . . whatever the hell his name is. HR was DCHC not NY. I haven't seen this dvd so don't pay attention to my 1 star rating. I'm not a total fan of NY punk, but however they did do their job as far as spreading the movement/word when necessary.",1294185600,,280,3.76271186440678
8240957,1,B00118SUIO,"None of the bands in this documentary can hold a candle to any of the bands from the 80s NYHC scene.  The music is so awful that it made me sad that the younger generation would be led to believe that this garbage is representative of the golden years of hardcore from NYC.

I could excuse the omission of the 80s bands if the film was well made and included an interesting cast of characters that had more to say than, ""I'm an outcast of society; hear me roar!""  Unfortunately, the result is an art student quality film of live clips from (mostly) CBGBs and interviews with band members and fans who are not at all compelling or articulate.

Watching this film made me wish that CBGBs had closed its doors in 1992.  Don't waste your time or money.",1259539200,4,748,4.35251798561151
8240958,4,B00118SUIO,"Could have covered alot more and included some more significant bits and pieces. Lots of average hardcore bands. Not 100% happy with the overall message thats conveyed although its not all bad. It got 4 stars. Theres heaps here. And the bonus material is gold. Roger miret, Freddy madball, john joseph (agnostic front, cro-mags). must have for hardcore bretheren",1234483200,4,362,5.1525423728813555
8240959,1,B00118SUIO,"Let me start by writing that I was there, at CBGB, nearly every Sunday, from 1984 to 1988, until I relocated.  And even then, over those 4 years, when the scene was at its peak, I felt like I missed out on so much.  So how does this documentary get to be titled NYHC when it focuses almost exclusively on the nineties?  I don't get it.  I expected it to cover the development of hardcore in New York, starting with the arrival of the Bad Brains, and moving on from there.  But no.

No HR interview.
No Vinnie Stigma.
No Harley Flanagan.
No Todd Youth.
No War Zone, Token Entry, Youth of Today, Bold, Underdog, Reagan Youth, Krakdown, Sick Of It All, Rest In Pieces, etc. etc. etc.
NO HILLY KRISTAL (RIP) interview!!!!! This was filmed before he passed away, and they didn't even take the time to meet with the man who had enough foresight to give us hardcore matinees.  Instead, the directors went to Northport, Long Island.

Not even any references to the Rock Hotel, or Chris Williamson.

These people, and many more, were the heart and soul of the NYHC, and they are entirely omitted from this documentary.

Save your money.  Buy American Hardcore instead. It's much more thorough, with great interviews with hardcore veterans from around the country.",1231372800,25,1254,4.603603603603603
