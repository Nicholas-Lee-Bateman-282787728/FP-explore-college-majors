2684995,1,B000K7VHOQ,"Fox is not only greedy, they're too lazy to put some special features on the set which would tempt me to pay this outrageous price! Again let me remind them (if anyone at the studio ever bothers to read these reviews) about PORTRAIT, BARBARA STANWYCK, a 50 minute feature that was filmed on the set of The Big Valley in 1968.  It's owned by the original producer's sons (Rick & Mike Spalla HOLLYWOOD NEWSREEL SYNDICATE, INC.  1622 N. Gower St. Los Angeles, CA 90028-6518).

I suggest updating it with current interviews with Peter Breck, Lee Majors, Linda Evans and some of the series great guest stars.  Of course, that would require some initiative on the part of 20th Century Fox --- something of which they seem to be totally devoid.

Furthermore, FOX seems to have momentarily forgotten that the entire series has been running UNCUT on Encore's Western Channel, and I, like many other fans, have already burned every episode to DVD!  Nevertheless, I still bought the first season because it was so reasonably priced.

Therefore, unless they come up with some great extra features on future sets,

I'll just be content with my home-made DVDs, the picture quality of which is at least the equal to theirs.",1164931200,90,1208,4.774038461538462
2684996,1,B000K7VHOQ,"What a major freaking disappointment. I am sooooo tired of being ripped off. I was so looking forward to Big Valley Season 2 and must echo the remarks of previous reviewers...STOP BREAKING UP THE SEASONS!!!

And come on guys...be reasonable and knock off the greedy marketing ploys. Sheeeesh. I WILL NOT purchase this at this price. I can wait for it to be on TV and record it to DVR myself...or...I know where I can get the whole series at once on-line! Screw this rip-off...hope it is boycotted (as I did Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Time Tunnel, Lost In Space, Perry Mason, and all other releases of this inconsiderate type.)

Note to Paramount: When the remastered Star Trek Original Series is released: PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE be reasonable to the fans who have stood by your product and made it possible for you to reap the rewards throughout the decades. We are the reason you have this cash cow and will continue to support your product...or walk away with a bad taste in our mouths.",1164758400,17,994,4.610169491525424
2684997,1,B000K7VHOQ,"First STUDIO releases SHOULD be complete, uncut and remastered WITH ORIGINAL Themes etc. W-B releases Cheyenne cut and slaughtered! SOME releases are worth it. Sony's Releases Season 1 of Fantasy Island (HIGH priced) and then stops! All this B.S. and now breaking Seasons up!  PASS - There are MANY good sources of MANY TV series that are complete, good quality and reasonable! PASS on Big Valley  Season 2 Part 1  Chaper 1  Disc 1  -  These are not ""trading cards"" you buy individually!  Idiots full of greed!  And then THEY wonder why they don't sell as many as they thought they would!  Go figure....",1164672000,14,603,4.721153846153846
2684998,1,B000K7VHOQ,"Whats going on with Season 2 Big Valley? 40 bucks retail for half a season,20th Century Fox-Your F-Fing nutts. I was so excited with season 1, i ran out that day it came out and bought it. Great price to at 19.99 on sale. I cant believe this Studio,ripping us off for season 2. Then theres season 3 & 4........

  Take a look at the I Love Lucy seasons on DVD ,full seasons and beautifully Re-mastered for a great price. Learn from Paramount & CBS ,Don't cheat the fans of The Big Valley.....You didn't even re-master the first season of Valley. What a Drag and you want us to pay more? NOT!!!!!!",1164499200,12,596,4.303571428571429
2684999,1,B000K7VHOQ,"The cover picture does not include cast member Richard Long and to add insult to injury, two pictures of Lee Majors.  Just because Lee Majors and Linda Evans went on to do a lot more television, let us not forget the others and their contributions to this great show.  I hope the company will correct this glaring mistake before the release date!",1164153600,6,346,4.564516129032258
2685000,1,B000K7VHOQ,"...buying the bootlegged version, because I wanted to wait for the official releases. But I think I change that decision now. If I want to be ripped off, I prefer the little street pick-pocket taking my money instead of the mafia boss.",1164153600,16,235,4.619047619047619
2685001,1,B000K7VHOQ,"I love The Big Valley, and was thrilled to be able to buy Season One on DVD.  But if they're going to be selling the rest of the seasons as Volume 1 and Volume 2, they can forget it.  They're essentially doubling the price.  Also, with most everyone's shelf space at a premium, the last thing anyone needs is two boxes per season.",1164067200,13,330,4.2063492063492065
2685002,4,B000K7VHOQ,Great to see this come out at last i really enjoyed the first series pity this is divided i assume into 2 parts the price could probably be a little less as it is not the whole series like series one but great to get it when it comes out,1163894400,3,237,3.76
2685003,3,B000K7VHOQ,"I am pleased that Big Valley is continuing to be released and if they want to break up the second season, then fine.  BUT I must object to the price that is almost the same price as the entire season one set!  What is going on???",1163548800,63,229,3.9565217391304346
2685024,3,B000K7VHOQ,What happened to Season 2 Volume 2 The only reason I gave this 3 stars is this is a great show. Why not drop the price on the full  Season 2. So those of us that  bought Season 1 Volume 1 can get the other half. Or put a Volume 2 out at a discount price. I feel ripped off that they never put out the second volume!!,1466985600,3,316,3.6323529411764706

2685029,5,B000K7VHOQ,"My husband is crazy about Big Valley (and has been since he watched it with his family as a child) and was very happy to receive this for his birthday. I think one of the reasons my husband loves to watch this series is because Linda Evans is so beautiful, and he's always had a crush on her. He also is a California history buff and the setting takes place near where we live in the Central Valley of California. It's western themed and the setting is the spectacular Barkley Ranch with lots of horses. We're always looking for wholesome shows to watch together, and we have really enjoyed watching season 2. We recommend the season 1 dvds, too.",1454889600,,646,4.436974789915967

2685052,5,B000K7VHOQ,Love this show. First thought - a sappy western. But I've enjoyed the fact that the series often drew from non-fiction western history. The Barkley family is fiction however is based on a real family in California during the 1800s.,1413763200,,231,4.8

Made Bonanza-style, the actors are great...The plots might need a little work but yes, I love this show. But I was terrible shocked when, expecting the full season, I open it up to find only three one-sided discs. Most disappointed, will reluctantly buy second part of the season, but I shouldn't be expected to do this. Really disappointed, guys.",1393286400,,480,4.658823529411765

(Bad points): You'll get hooked and want to own ALL four seasons of the series. The problem, ONLY seasons 1 & 2 were released in a DVD collection. If you want Seasons 3 & 4 you will need to purchase a bootleg collection to get them. Most bootleg collections are recorded from the Hallmark or Western channel which had viewing rights, and it is a total ""crap shoot"" as to the quality you will find. I was lucky and got an excellent seller who sold me all four seasons for $20. You may not be so lucky!",1392681600,,702,4.2781954887218046

2685129,5,B000K7VHOQ,I was happy to see The Big Valley on dvd. What I don't understand is this: Why bother producing The Big Valley on dvd if ALL seasons are not produced and released at a decent pace. This is doing nothing but leaving the viewers hanging.

2685159,5,B000K7VHOQ,"I love this wonderful series set in late 1800's California. In every episode we are treated to the Barkley clan navigating the physical and emotional terrain of the old west.  I particularly enjoy the personalities; Barbara Stanwyck is great as the strong, wise matriarch of the family. Peter Breck, Richard Long, Lee Majors, and Linda Evans each bring a unique perspective to their characters that give them identities that are engaging and interesting to follow.  The shows often feature guest stars from the golden days of Hollywood which supplies a richness to the series as well.

What I don't like has nothing to do with the great series, but rather 20th Century Fox's marketing. The first set of DVD's from season one is complete.  Not so with the second season (only 1/2 of the shows), and the remaining three seasons are not even offered. I have seen this with other shows where just a couple of seasons are released and that's it.  I think if the decision to offer the series on DVD is made, they should commit and go all the way.  As it stands now, there is one and half seasons, and nothing more.  When and if the rest of this wonderful show will be released is anybody's guess.

The show was splendidly cast and I liked and admired all the characters.  The plots were interesting and exemplified a lot of the values that used to make this country great: family, self-reliance, and the importance of character.

Picture and audio are crisp and clear for this DVD, and the original cast performs flawlessly, especially Peter Breck and Barbara Stanwyck in their respective roles as Nick and Victoria Barkley.  Fox needs to release the rest of the series as complete season sets!

I understand that they may be respoinding to consumer demand and that they don't want to lose money marketing such an old series, but there are enough of us ""Boomers"" out there to provide them with such demand.  This series was and still is a quality Western that the whole family can watch, and that's a rarity these days.

2685165,4,B000K7VHOQ,"I was happy to saddle up for another season of ridin' and ropin' in the valley.  Victoria, Jarrod, Nick, Heath and Audra are all back to protect the valley and do right by the ranchers.  The scripts are good, the acting is good and the stories are fun...and the added bonus is that some kind of amazing gene flows through the Barkley family to make them all stunningly gorgeous.  They do, indeed, sit pretty in the saddle...and everywhere else, for that matter.

This is only half of the season that was 1966/67, but it's chock full of entertainment in the 15 episodes offered.  For starters, the guest stars include:  Joseph Campanella, Laura Devon, James Whitmore, Strother Martin, Colleen Dewhurst, Sheree North, Bill Quinn, Bruce Dern and Buddy Hackett in one of the weirdest casting choices ever to hit Hollywood...he gallops into town claiming to be Heath's real father and speaking with an Irish brogue.

Favorite episodes are:  ""Caesar's Wife,"" where Audra's relationship with a young man makes his step-mother jealous.  Let's just say the step-mother is pretty creepy.  ""The Great Safe Robbery"" is a bit of a departure in that Barbara Stanwyck and Linda Evans show their comedic flair in reacting to three buffoons trying to rob a safe while holding the women hostage.  I also liked ""The Velvet Trap,"" where Nick falls for a woman who looks, for all the world, like a Dean Martin Gold Digger.  Nick loves her, but she's a woman with a secret.  She describes Nick as ""a violent summer storm with a rainbow at the end.""  She may have a secret, but it's not that she's a poet; that's for sure.  ""The Iron Box"" is also good where Nick and Heath are thrown into a prison.  Nick gets to beat the tar out of prison guards like some kind of super hero, and apparently a prison requirement was for Nick and Heath is to have their shirts unbuttoned.  I must say, it's a win-win!

So, what have we learned from being in the Valley?  Well, Victoria has the waist of a 19-year-old girl, Jarrod is a lawyer you want on your side, Nick is a super hero, Heath is pretty gullible to ever think Buddy Hackett was his father and Audra inherited her mother's spunk.  And the most important thing...we'd like to keep riding through the Valley with the Barkleys, so Fox should release the rest of the seasons.  The Big Valley is big fun.  I highly recommend it.",1339891200,3,2348,4.607228915662651

The languages are German and Englisch DD 1.0 mono. The region code is 2 and TV system PAL. You have a codefree DVD player and a TV which can handle NTSC and PAL then you must buy in Germany.

The fourth season of BIG VALLEY will come in Germany, too. I heared that the release date is january 2012.

There are several shows that after one or two seasons are abandoned by the studios and is not fair for the loyal customer.

I was just about to put season one of The Big Valley in my shopping cart when I stumbled across Season 2 PART 1. Breaking TV seasons up into two parts is nothing short of reprehensible. In comparison to producing new series, the studios have only minor production costs involved in releasing shows such as this on DVD at this late date. And at the rate they are releasing these classic shows, I will have to leave it to my great grandchildren to collect the final seasons. I will be long gone before they become available. The studios need to realize who their audience is. If they think the younger generations are all that interested in classic TV shows, I think they have a rude awakening coming. They need to release ENTIRE TV SERIES NOW to take advantage of the fact that many of us who were there when these shows originally aired are still alive and interested in collecting them.

However, as many have noted, after releasing the entire first season in one pop, the studio decided to go for a money gouge and split up the second season into two parts, this first part virtually the same price as the entire first season.

And you'll note that they have not come out with the second half of the second season.  I can only assume it is because of people refusing to pay as much for half a season as for a full season.

Which means we're all screwed, basically.  We don't get the rest of the show, they don't get money.  This is what happens when greed backfires.

2685213,5,B000K7VHOQ,"""Big Valley"" reruns were my childhood favorite, and after buying this set and season one, I can say the show lives up to my memories. It would be a shame if Fox stopped releasing the DVDs--which brings me to the info:

After searching for a way to complain about the price-gouging on season two, I finally contacted a site that monitors DVD releases. They said sales of season one were poor and that Fox raised the price to recoup their losses. But since this half-set isn't selling well either, they probably won't release the rest.

Maybe if all the people who bought season one decide to buy this set they'll release more. Maybe not. Personally, I think Fox bungled the whole thing. When it comes to short-run series (Big Valley only ran four seasons), it makes more sense to release the complete series (with extras) at a premium price. Most fans would pay more up front to get the whole series and not have to worry about studios dropping the project. As it is, Fox has done nothing but shortchange consumers and undermine its own profits.",1191974400,130,1044,4.60752688172043

From what I understand, sales of the first season were ""soft"" and 20th Century decided to try the second season this way, although I can't imagine the logic to their thinking.  I only hope they continue to release the entire series (so I can finally unload all my commercial-laden watered-down VCR copies.)  In my opinion, season one was the absolute best---it was gritty, realistic western action. Subsequent seasons were somewhat less dramatic and injected more humor, as evidenced in this collection by ""Pursuit"" and ""The Great Safe Robbery"". As I recall, about that time, the television networks were putting their foot down on violence over the airwaves and the westerns had to become more like morality plays---they weren't permitted to be all shoot-em-ups.  In season two, pioneer mama Barbara Stanwyck seemes to have been injected with vitamin supplements---because she was sure more spry than in the first season (also sporting a new prairie hair style and blue eye shadow.)  And Heath finally gets a new pair of pants.  Each of the characters is featured in several episodes, my personal favorites being ""Last Stage to Salt Flats"" and ""Day of Terror"".  Overall, I recommend this release.  Each season had its own unique opening credits, but the second season credits are not used in this edition---the first season's are repeated.  This minor flaw is the only reason I did not give it five stars.",1174694400,5,1586,5.0

There are, BTW, absolutely no ""extras"" included in this set to justify the much higher per-episode cost.

As huge a Big Valley fan as I am - it was my favorite TV western growing up, and still plays amazingly well for me today - I'd suggest holding off on buying Season 2, Volume 1. For one thing, I suspect we just may being seeing a complete Season 2 box set in the near future, especially if sales on this half-effort are poor enough. For another, Fox needs to get the message that such blatant money grubbing schemes will not work, we're too smart for that. Support such greedy efforts by buying this set, I can pretty much guarantee we'll be seeing more such from Fox, quite possibly with the entirety of the rest of Big Valley.

Unlike me, she did not watch the program growing up. However, now she has Encore Western set to record each episode that is aired each weeknight.  She can't miss a single one.  She LOVES it.

I will wait and see about the added or bonus features.  I do find it  rather incredulous that they would not include ANY actor interviews.  We also have both ""Daniel Boone"" seasons 1 and 2 with the great Fess Parker and they at least have interviews with the cast.  We also have the first addition of the coolest of cool, Steve McQueen in ""Wanted Dead or Alive"".  They have excellent bonus features on this legend and hero of so many of us baby boomers.

It's a shame that Fox does not think enough of the true fans of ""Big Valley"" to not put even one extra bonus feature on their boxed sets.  It is honestly because of this that I have not yet bought the set.  As I said, we are enjoying them free on Encore Westerns.

2685238,4,B000K7VHOQ,"It appears that most of the ratings for this product are based solely on Fox's pricing strategy for season 2 of the Big Valley.  I would argue that a review for a TV show season on DVD should consider not only the price, but also the packaging, and the quality of the show itself .  I also would have expected to pay less for  of a season compared to a full season.  I also agree that $40 is high, but you have to remember that most people are not going to pay (nor are retailers going to charge) the full MSRP.  I'm pretty sure Fox knows that.  The MSRP for many items are set high so that discounters can appear to provide a great deal to the consumer.  A local discount store has Season 2, Volume 1 of the Big Valley currently available for $20.  I consider $20 for  season of the Big Valley a good deal.  Most people seem to have no problem paying $20 for a movie that contains 2 hours of programming, if that.  A  season of the Big Valley contains close to 15 hours of programming for the same price.

For those who have access to a DVR and to the Western channel (or other channels airing the Big Valley) then that is a great option for you.  For those of us who do not, then I consider Fox's offering more than fair.  While I would prefer to have the seasons packaged in their entirety, I am willing to wait to have a great quality copy of this series

By the way, I give this product 5 stars for quality of the show, 4 stars for pricing, and 3 stars for packaging (mainly because the season is split) - for those who are interested in a review based on more than pricing.

Never mind that Eugene, who was in two seasons, gets no picture of himself up there with them.

2685246,5,B000K7VHOQ,"Like many of you, I was disappointed to hear about Season 2 being split in half. Still, I agree that we must continue purchasing ""Big Valley"" DVD releases to ensure that we get all four seasons. For those who are complaining about the price, an alternative would be to shell out $250 for all four seasons on DVD from another manufacturer (I can't recall the name, but found it after Googling ""Big Valley, DVD."" I doubt that the video and sound quality is even close to the studio releases. Also, I believe Season 2 is when ""The Big Valley"" really hit its stride. I think Lee Majors matured quite a bit as an actor, and some of his best work is on Season 2. Also, it was enjoyable to see hunky Heath ""in peril,"" and Season 2 offers some real gems, including two of Heath's three times under the lash (he's supposedly the most whipped character in TV history). Seriously, ""The Big Valley"" is a classic, and I think we as fans should embrace this latest release. Things could be a lot worse.",1166140800,13,988,4.404371584699454
2685247,5,B000K7VHOQ,"It is disappointing to see that they have decided to split up Season 2, obviously taking a step out of the pages of the Battlestar Galactica releases.  I won't be surprised if more companies begin to follow suit.

However, being a huge Big Valley fan for nearly thirty years, I have still gone ahead and purchased it.  There should be 15 episodes in this first volume since each season of the Big Valley had 30 episodes.  Fifteen episodes is still a fair amount compared with today's shows that put out 22 per season.

The second season of the Big Valley continues the story of the Barkleys.  Season 2 is more solidified than the first season, even though the first season is very good.

It contains the 2-part episode ""Legend of a General"" where Heath is taken prisoner in Mexico, and only the help of an old Mexican general, can help the Barkleys get him back.

There's also ""Caesar's Wife"" in which, daring for its time, addresses a step-mother who makes advances toward her husband's son.

""The Velvet Trap"" finds unsuspecting Nick falling in love with a woman who is, in fact, the girlfriend of a notorious outlaw and how she attempts to use Nick to get rid of a bounty hunter who is trying to track down the dangerous Jack Floyd.

They also added The Big Valley's first comedic episode in ""The Great Safe Robbery"" in which three bumbling brothers attempt to steal and rob a safe from a train depot.  It's truly hilarious.

There is also the classic Big Valley episode, ""Last Stage to Salt Flats"" which finds the family (except Nick and Audra) stranded in the middle of the desert after their stagecoach is robbed.

All of the episodes in the season and in this volume are worth watching, especially since they will be unedited, and likely not seen by many viewers since they first aired, due to commercial time.

Nick looks as sharp as ever in his black leather vest, gloves, and large brown hat.  He's also as fiesty and tempermental as ever, with plenty of great brawls for him to get into.  The episode, ""The Iron Box"" shows how angry he can get when someone in his family is attacked or threatened.  This is evident when Heath is tortured and brutalized by a demented prison warden, and Nick must figure out a way to save his brother when he is placed a sweat box.

Victoria begins having some adventures and getting out of the house as Barbara Stanwyck insisted that Victoria have some stories not centered around wearing dresses and answering the door.

This is a great show and a terrific season, even if you are only getting half, I think it's worth it.  They simply don't make westerns or T.V. shows like this with such great adventure stories as this.  Enjoy fifteen more episodes with California's favorite matriarchal family.",1166140800,93,2743,4.62603305785124
2685248,5,B000K7VHOQ,"I agree with those who think we should stop belly-aching about the price.  The first season was a bargain, but that doesn't mean the other releases have to cost the same.  I love this show and would buy it at just about any price.  As someone else has pointed out, if we don't buy the product, the powers that be have no reason to release the rest of the series.  That would be a crying shame.  Trust me, it can happen. ""Murphy Brown"" isn't going to have any further releases due to lack of sales of the first season.  I'm disappointed about the season split, too, but I feel the price is reasonable.  Refusing to buy it would be shooting ourselves in the foot.",1165881600,6,661,4.282258064516129
2685249,1,B000K7VHOQ,"I was Excited when I saw that Season 2 of the Big Valley was being Released, that is until I saw that Only HALF THE SEASON is being released and for the same price as an entire season! Amazonians don't need to be math wizards to realise that they will be Ripped Off if they buy this set! I for One will not buy this set and urge others not to buy it either. If sales for this set are low(and from what I hear the sales for Season one were a dissapointment)maybe the greedy studios will get the message and price these sets more reasonably and in complete seasons! I will just continue to watch the reruns on tv for free! Victoria Barkley would have never stood for this nonsense! I actually had the opportunity to buy this set for 19.99 at a local store here but I REFUSED! I won't buy this set no matter how cheap it is because it is the Principle of the matter!",1165881600,10,863,4.112426035502959
2685250,5,B000K7VHOQ,"I think in some ways they may try to be recouping any losses from Season One. I bought S1 with it's 30 episodes at nearly an hour EACH (30 HOURS) for $19.99. I think they may have wanted to get the first set out there to remind people how GREAT this show was (which it WAS), and now that we all remember they are charging a fair price, IMO. In my estimation it will be about 14 episodes for $30, or 14 hours of FLAWLESS entertainment for $30. Priced movies lately? An hour and a half will cost you $15 and only then GOD help you with todays movie making quality (READ: GARBAGE).

I will take the Big Valley any way they can get it to me. Face it, it's only 4 seasons I can live with this price structure and release format simply because the show was/IS that good. I will pay this price and SMILE doing it, in DVD ""feature movie pricing"" 14 hours would run you $140.

I will NOT defend the cover art snafoo though.... too bad it wasn't of William Shatner, he would LOVE IT!!

LASTLY PEOPLE, STOP ENCOURAGING OTHERS NOT TO BUY THIS, IF YOU DON'T WANT IT, FINE, BUT IF WE DON'T BUY THIS SPLIT SEASON THERE WON'T BE ANY OTHERS RELEASED FOR YOU TO CRY ABOUT. I WOULD RATHER HAVE THESE AS SPLIT SEASONS THAN NONE AT ALL!!!

And how is it a rip off if a 30 ep. 30 minute comedy like That Girl is $30 and so is a 14 ep. hour long set like this? It's the same freaking minutes people!!",1165795200,8,1377,4.051470588235294
2685251,1,B000K7VHOQ,"I was so furious at the way Fox has it's greedy hands into the fan's pockets that I felt a need to speak.  First, the cover art first released had two pictures of Lee Majors and none of Richard Long.  I am told it has been corrected, but has no one in the art department approving this ever even WATCHED the show?  They can't catch this mistake?  Pathetic.  Then they want to reach into the fans pockets and grab twice the money for HALF the episodes of the first season.  As more than one fan has brought out, I will continue to watch my shows taped off Encore Westerns, thank you.  At this rate it will take five or six years for all the seasons to be released on dvd.  DVD's are one of the cheapest things to make with a very high mark up and profit as it is.  What they are doing is gouging the true fans, and it is criminal.  One more thing.  Where are the special features???  Peter Breck, Lee Majors, and Linda Evans are available for interviews and many of the fans would love it, not to mention the documentary available on Barbara Stanwyck.  As many of the older tv series are coming out on DVD with extras, why not The Big Valley? Give us something more than we could tape off Encore Westerns.  They have their nerve to gripe about low sales!!!!",1165708800,10,1256,4.222689075630252
2685252,5,B000K7VHOQ,"First things first. Fox has corrected the artwork on the box- AMAZON needs to update this listing with the new artwork.

Second- If Fox wants more revenue, they should Promote the series to the Baby Boom Generation who have continued to watch the Big Valley on TV over the years. Doubling the price could affectively reduce sales and revenue. The Barkleys new better than to do business like this!!",1165536000,,398,4.768115942028985
2685253,1,B000K7VHOQ,"I cannot find anywhere how many of Season Two's episodes are in this collection.  I see it is three disks to Season One's five disks.  If they are single sided, that means there are about 12 episodes in this collection.  I don't understand why they insist on splitting it up.  I can only believe it is to get more money.  Does that mean Volume 2 will have two disks?  Will it be priced the same?  I will not be purchasing it for that price.  I prefer to get the entire season in a collection, not broken up.",1165536000,3,507,4.154639175257732
