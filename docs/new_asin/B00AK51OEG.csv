5444988,5,B00AK51OEG,"This is a 60 minute DVD that really is the story of the impending danger of the volcanoes in Iceland.  It has English subtitles and scene selection.
The purpose of this very scary film is to show how threatening the eruption of Iceland's volcanoes would be. It does go into some history of `doomsday' eruptions and has a most interesting look into past eruptions. It shows how scientists looked into the rise of deaths in the summer of 1783 (when most deaths occur in the winter), crops shriveled and there was a constant dry fog all across England and Central Europe. They concluded that the sulphur emitted from the explosions mix in the atmosphere to become mists of sulfuric acid.

The researchers do a thorough and thought-provoking job of explaining past eruptions, including the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj""kull, and their effects on the world. Reenactments in the background add interest, rather than just having a talking head.
The scary fact is that an Icelandic volcano 10 times larger and way past due for eruption is now swelling and grumbling.
This is an attention-grabbing and daunting but well done DVD.",1363392000,6,1120,4.920634920634921

8552941,4,B00AK51OEG,This shares the impact that a volcano eruption in Iceland had upon global economy due to lack of air traffic during the time it occurred. Then it aspires to evaluate previous eruptions of volcanoes in the area as it is thought they are all linked and could possibly go off. Possible situations are played out with CGI. Previous evidence is examined and studied as to what all could possibly happen to present the most terrible result POSSIBLE!,1526169600,,443,4.766233766233766

8552946,4,B00AK51OEG,"If you like Nova and you like volcanoes, you will like this documentary on the volcanoes of Iceland and the air traffic shut down of 2010. This film meets Nova's usual high standards.",1390867200,,183,4.575757575757576
8552947,3,B00AK51OEG,"This is the kind of stuff that might turn you into ""fun house material"". Welcome to Iceland, the land of nice tourist guides, inviting hot springs and...ahem...doomsday volcanoes.

These goddesses of death - with bizarre names like Laki, Hekla, Katla and Eyjafjallajkull - are ready to explode sky high at any time. When they do, a hundred thousand people in Europe might die of poisonous sulphuric smog. The fate of North America won't be much better if the winds turn in *that* particular direction. At the very least, we'll get a new economic recession with stock exchanges plummeting around the Western world.

I watched this documentary after consuming a really spicy dish and an energy drink. Almost scared me stiff. But seriously...it seems we just got one more thing to worry about. OK, how do you get off this planet? And please cancel that real estate deal at Reykjavik, will you. :-O",1376265600,2,894,4.875
8552948,5,B00AK51OEG,"This Nova DVD gives us something new to worry about - Iceland. Unfortunately, its not something that can be solved by aid or military threat - it's their volcanoes, specifically a group of four volcanoes - one of which was responsible for numerous flight delays in 2010.

Turns out Iceland is sitting on the spot where two shifting tectonic plates meet, periodically leading to major volcanic eruptions. An eruption in 1783 was catastrophic, killing over 20% of Iceland's people, and thousands more in Europe - largely from sulphur dioxide emissions. Experts believe another one is overdue for eruption.

So add this concerns to your already long list - terrorism, collapsing economy, new flu viruses, etc. Actually, it's an interesting and credible presentation.",1369440000,3,763,5.245901639344262
8552949,4,B00AK51OEG,"The title for this thing should be ""Four Active Volcanic Centers in Iceland.""  Yes, when erupting all four of these have the potential to disrupt life in Europe, and especially in Iceland, but that hardly qualifies as doomsday.

The four volcanic centers covered are Eyjafjallajokull (Eyja), which erupted in 2010, Hekla, Katla and Laki.  The emphasis is on ash and volcanic gas eruptions, with basically nothing about bulk magma chemistry and its roll in the types of eruptions volcanoes produce (the latest eruption of Eyja, for example, apparently started with a basaltic fissure eruption, followed by explosive andesitic volcanism in the main conduit).

For educational purposes, the detail on the 1783 eruption of Laki alone is worth the price.  The aftermath of the the eruption killed a quarter of the population of Iceland, and probably tens of thousands more in Europe.  This was also the first time a volcanic eruption was connected to climate change (by Ben Franklin, no less).  The video includes a very nice animation of the Laki fissure eruption, and crisp aerial images of the source of the 1783 eruption.

If you teach about volcanoes in a geology or earth science course, or if you just find them interesting, you need this one in your video library.",1368576000,5,1267,5.0
