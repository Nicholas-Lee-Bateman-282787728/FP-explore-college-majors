7938061,1,B00005CDVJ,"This movie has the worst sound and picturequality on anything I have ever seen (except for the movie Thug Life with Napoleon)
The picturequality is really awful, filmed with an old VHS-camera I believe...
And the videos are cut short, basicly this is a mess of bad-quality stuff.
Skip this one and put on a Mystikal record instead, you will not be dissapointed!
And oh... The cover of the video has women with very little clothes on it, however they do not appear in the film so don't kid yourself thinking that: -Hey even if I don't like the movie I can always look at the girls!
Becouse the girls isn't even in it, except in the censored musicvideoclips",1065312000,,655,4.512605042016807
