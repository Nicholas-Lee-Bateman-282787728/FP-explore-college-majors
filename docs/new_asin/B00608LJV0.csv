I am writing because the asking price is insulting to consumers when each DVD on its own is readily available for $8.99.  Nine titles at $8.99 each comes out to $80.91 and they qualify for free shipping.  Why on Earth would anyone spend an additional $54.86?",1365984000,149,333,4.426229508196721

8490203,5,B00608LJV0,"In honor of the 30th anniversary of the original DuckTales series, and my own 30th birthday shortly beforehand, here's a 9-for-1 special on the 3 volume sets of DuckTales, 2 of Darkwing Duck, 2 of the 3 Talespin sets, and 2 of Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers! Volume 1 of DuckTales contains 27 shows on a 3-disc DVD set from its monstrous 1st season, but with no real bonuses, like all the other sets, even including the 3rd and last Talespin set! In fact, all these shows had 65 shows in 1 season apiece, but DW ended up with 91 shows and 100 for Ducktales, plus a theatrical movie! If you thought Digimon's 1st season was already monstrous with having 54 shows in it, think again! Volume 2 contains the 5-part pilot episode of how Donald Duck joined the Navy and left Huey, Dewey, and Louie with Scrooge and his family, and ending with a crazy case of ""gold fever"", as well as 19 other episodes, including 1 split into 2 11-minute ones! Volume 3 contains the last 14 episodes of the 1st season, plus the two 5-part origin TV movies, that came later, of Bubba the Caveduck & Tootsie the baby Triceratops, and of Fenton Crackshell alias Gizmoduck! Other than Treasure of the Lost Lamp, this show never concluded on DVD, just like most of the other classic Disneytoon TV shows on DVD! Anyway, volume 1 of Darkwing Duck contains the edited 2-part TV movie Darkly Dawns the Duck, plus 25 other shows from its own monstrous 1st season; volume 2 would have another 27 shows, including the Christmas special It's A Wonderful Leaf (also on its own DVD)! DW's realm seems to be the same as that of Ducktales AND Quack Pack, even in the new Ducktales series on Disney XD! But we must push on; Talespin and Rescue Rangers only had 65 shows & 1 season each in the end, even in spite of their popularity in the 90's AND today! Volume 1 of Talespin has its 4-part pilot episode, of how Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker teamed up for their jobs assigned by Shere Khan and Rebecca Cunningham, plus 23 other shows, volume 2 has another 27 shows including the Christmas episode, and the 3rd and last volume (not in this bundle) has the last 11 shows on a 2-disc set! And now the ""coop de Gracie"", Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers; volume 1 has a massive 27 shows & volume 2 has its own 5-part pilot episode, thankfully at normal speed and pitch, as Disney Channel and Toon Disney used to show up to all 5 parts sped up via time compression, for reasons unknown, plus 19 other missions, after the Rescue Rangers' famous teamup in the 5-part pilot! In that show, keep an eye out for special appearances of other Disney stars, besides Chip n Dale, like Buzz-Buzz (alias Spike) the bee (hundreds of times over, trying to serve 2 different queens) and Humphrey the bear (the star of the song Humphrey Hop, which was imitated by Mater in Cars 3)! Don't go complaining your heads off these ain't been remastered for DVD release; every episode in all these sets look & sound the same as they did on TV, and even in Digital form nowadays! Go ahead and add ALL these sets to your DVD libraries today; whether you grew up with them or you're seeing them for the very first time, you won't be sorry with any or all of these nine 3-disc treasures, be they 3-packs of slim DVD cases in boxes, or single cases to each 3-disc set!",1502064000,,3279,4.403624382207578
8490204,1,B00608LJV0,"2 other posters have already stated that this is extremely overpriced - its sad that the ""most helpful"" review doesn't show up first compared to the verified purchases. Sellers like this should be removed from the market. I feel sorry for anyone that purchases this and realizes they could have purchased 5 to 8 additional cartoons for themselves!",1496448000,,347,5.0
8490205,1,B00608LJV0,I completely agree with PenHasNoName. I was set to purchase this box set until I discovered it is cheaper to purchase each DVD individually. This price is absolutely ridiculous!,1492819200,,177,5.137931034482759

I was happy to introduce my kids to Scrooge McDuck and his clan, and then Chip&Dale for some fun clean family time. The kids loved each little cartoon. They came in just as described.

This DVD set would make a great gift to  loved one.

I paid full price for these Ducktales Volumes 1 2 3 Darkwing Duck Volume 1 2 Tailspin Volume 1&2 Chip&Dale Rescue Rangers Volume 1&2. All opinions stated are 100% mine.",1465084800,,575,4.617647058823529
