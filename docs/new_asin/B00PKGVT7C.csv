8688366,5,B00PKGVT7C,"I think I have nearly all of Joseph Zbukvic's DVDs.  It's hard to express just how much value I've gotten from them as I find myself watching them over and over.  Like many very accomplished artists, Joseph Zbukvic's instruction assumes you're not just starting out with this difficult medium.  He discusses very little about specific paints or brushes, mixing color, paper, etc.  It's necessary to listen carefully to everything he says as he demonstrates.  Listen and watch.  Paying very close attention to what he's doing on the palette as well the paper.  Notice his timing for glazing and going back into wet colors.  What he has to offer can't be gleaned with one or two viewings.  I learn something every time I watch.",1450396800,6,725,4.829268292682927
