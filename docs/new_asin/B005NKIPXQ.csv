4847894,3,B005NKIPXQ,"Love the Michael, especially as a solo performer. Just him and a piano is an engaging, spellbinding experience. His spontaneous interactions with the audience are always a highlight. Gotta love that he's keeping the standards alive and has a passion for the old school classics.

Feinstein as crooner backed up by an orchestra is an example of more adding up to less. The result is what might happen if a saloon player tried to jump on stage and become one of the follies. He comes off a bit stiff and overly self conscious. Feinstein's enthusiasm is his saving grace. His between song banter and stories sound rehearsed but are none the less fascinating. And the voice is as good as ever.",1327363200,8,689,4.694214876033058
4847895,5,B005NKIPXQ,"Michael Feinstein has produced a unique concert as a tribute to Sinatra and his contemporaries. He has selected an eclectic mixture of songs which he delivers with his customary verve and charm. Backed by a terrific orchestra Michael Feinstein is on top form; highly enjoyable and highly recommend, not just to fans of Mr Feinstein but anyone who loves good music.",1324512000,8,364,4.983606557377049
4847896,2,B005NKIPXQ,"This a short concert, maybe 60 minutes. It's supposed to be a tribute to Old blue eyes but most of the music is not Sinatra's legendary work. Just as the concert is picking up momentum with New York New York, that's the final song. The sound is fair. The good thing was because this concert was short I had enough time left in the evening to watch the Jackie Evancho blu ray concert ""Dream with Me"". Absolutely spectacular. I'll have to add my review to the other 5 stars for Evancho.",1323648000,4,484,4.329670329670329

4847902,4,B005NKIPXQ,"Historically very good , just not as fascinating as Great American Songbook or the American Songbook videos. Still a great evening of entertainment.",1369267200,,148,5.478260869565218
4847903,5,B005NKIPXQ,"I was fortunate to hear Frank Sinatra in Concert and am a fan of Michael Feinstein.
I did see this concert Live at Strathmore Hall, and it is one of the best concerts by Michael Feinstein.

Michael Feinstein tells the story of Frank Sinatra through his music.  Michael Feinstein does not try to impersonate Frank Sinatra but takes one through a journey of the life of Frank Sinatra's music, his style and phrasing, and why the Music sung by Frank Sinatra lives on in our hearts.

Michael Feinstein researches the history of Frank Sinatra and Frank Sinatra's legacy lives on in song and words.",1368489600,2,592,4.673076923076923
4847904,5,B005NKIPXQ,it is a fascinating and  most professional performance by a talented artist who is able to bring you close once again to the great music of the time of Sinatra which lingers still and will never be forgotten. Feinstein is a superb showman with a great sense of humour who carries you away with him through his enthusiasm and energy.,1362873600,3,332,4.533333333333333
4847905,5,B005NKIPXQ,THIS is one great hour of Michael Feinstein and a wondeful orchestra....I have seen him in person several times--but this CD tops the other times I've seen him--I have watched this more times than I can count--and it always seems new to me...Barbara Cooper,1362009600,6,256,4.840909090909091

4847907,5,B005NKIPXQ,"Just got to watch this DVD last nite.  It is a REAL production with many camera angles, excellent sound, LARGE orchestra and Michael does very well.  It sounded GREAT thru my surround sound system.  The songs are chosen as to not only songs Frank made famous, but also songs made famous by people who influenced Frank (and whom he influenced too).  Michael gives many notes before each piece - adn I think it helps oen understand it a bit better.  The pic on the cover shows Michael standing on the Steinway and he does that a few times during the show at the Palladium Theatre in Indianapolis.  You wish there was a 2nd DVD - this one seems short.  I highly recommend it.  you will enjoy.",1344211200,4,689,4.412698412698413
4847908,5,B005NKIPXQ,Michael Feinstein is a very special man who has maintained music that could have been lost.

8480580,5,B005NKIPXQ,"This was very close to the live Tribute to Sinatra performance show I saw in December.  While a bit shorter than the live concert, it does justice to what was done in the show and includes two of my three favorite Sinatra songs (Time after Time and Fly Me to the Moon).  Feinstein is great with explaining the origins of the songs and composers as well as telling of his first experience in meeting Sinatra.  A great way for me to re-live one of the best shows I have seen.",1453161600,2,473,4.233333333333333

8480587,5,B005NKIPXQ,"We first saw this concert on Netflix and fell in love with Michael Feinstein!  So much, I went looking for our own copy which I found here on Amazon. This concert is fun, fast moving, and even for someone not born during that musical era, the music is absolutely wonderful.  This DVD is something you will watch over and over again.  Michael Feinstein is a consummate singer and entertainer.  The price is super and this would make a wonderful gift for parents and grandparents of that era.",1400284800,,490,4.597701149425287
