4992466,5,B0013K1AHI,"I got this DVD for my 4 year old nephew because he is in love with monster trucks...  His reaction when he saw a Monster truck movie was priceless, he just stuttered and breathed heavy for like 30 seconds.  The DVD itself was decent, but I am not really into them.  He knew about 1/3 of the drivers and what they drove just seeing their faces and/or Trucks.  For the purpose it was purchased, it was good to me.  The part that i saw was not ""highlights"" but entire ... whatever you call the courses and stuff.",1295395200,7,509,4.206185567010309

4992486,5,B0013K1AHI,"""MONSTER TRUCKS!!!!"" my son says every time..YEAH YEAH!!  Daddy can now vacuum, workout..you name it.

There are 2 disks..1st is lap races and parade (you can select on the menu where to start the parade and which truck you want to see or all like any other menu option).

The 2nd disk (my son's favorite) is the free style competition where the trucks are more likely to jump and crash, roll over whatever.  Most or all the major monster trucks are present at this competition.

Highly recommended for all aged kids..especially if they have a toy monster truck in their hand while watching...hint hint.",1352937600,,603,4.759615384615385
