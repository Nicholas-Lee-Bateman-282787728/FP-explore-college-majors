7814181,5,6301716868,"This movie with real life marrieds keeps me entertained every time I watch it.  The ""attack"" scene in the living room where the husband jumps on the coffee table is hysterical to me every time!  This couple is great together and they should make more movies as a team.  Well worth adding to your comedy collection.",1135036800,3,314,4.571428571428571
