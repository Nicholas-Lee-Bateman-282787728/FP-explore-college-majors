3157261,5,B0016K3EMO,"This DVD by Mike Anderson is brilliant.  It is so because it is THE TRUTH!  I don't know how the American Medical Association (AMA), National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the American Cancer Society (ACS) allowed this DVD to be produced and marketed, despite their strongarm tactics.  Anyhow now the truth is out for those who have the sense to perceive it as such.

This DVD is much more than just healing cancer.  Its methods apply to all sorts of chronic, degenerative and terminal conditions.  How much more evidence does the public need to see before it wakes up to the fact that the AMA, the physicians, big pharmaceuticals and the big food conglomerates (Perdue, Con Agra, Smithfield, Monsanto, Tyson, IBP, BPI etc) are sending their loved ones to an early grave.  The US Congress should investigate all of them and make a major overhaul of their practices, before they destroy this country like the corporations on Wall Street have done.  What Al Qeda was unable to do, these corporations and big pharma have done and will continue to do.

I most highly recommend this DVD to all.  It will not only prevent their loved ones from the ordeal of disability in old age, but also save their own lives!  I know I'll be buying several copies to broadcast the message.  This is the REAL deal!

We're former body builders and had relied on tons of animal and whey proteins. We wish we hadn't waited until our 50's to get this information. We made a total turnaround (cold turkey) in our diets since viewing it and our bodies have been thanking us ever since. We lost weight and improved our skin tone and energy levels.

8262831,2,B0016K3EMO,"The nutritional info. is so outdated, I couldn't rate it higher. The basic truth of our AMA/Corporate style of using all of us as fodder vs health and healing is right on and old news for any of us involved in our own health. Where it really falls apart is in the nutritional assertions based on lies and  crap science. As a former vegetarian it was a hard pill to swallow, but I wouldn't go parading, ""The China Study"" out as science or truth. It's been picked apart by far greater minds than Campbell, who was ousted by Columbia and not for being a rebel. The natural ways to help people's bodies are real and should be looked into by all of us, not just the diseased. The nutrition presented doesn't seem to know the difference between an effective pattern interrupt, which at the likes of the Gerson Method, Hoxley, et al and a sustainable diet. The whole meat=cancer assertion is misleading since humans developed as omnivores. Feedlot animal products? Wouldn't touch them with a ten-foot pole. While a movie review is not the place to argue nutrition I highly recommend to anyone researching health & well-being to check out the latest science on ancestral health, fat, cholesterol and what we need vs wishful thinking. That's a great place to start.",1414972800,,1256,4.683257918552036

8262834,5,B0016K3EMO,"I'm sure this film is considered controversial in some circles, but it rang of great truth's to me.

I bought it to give to my spouse's cousin who is a medical doctor with stage IV prostate cancer trying to navigate unknown waters outside their medical specialty. Even doctors are overwhelmed by a cancer diagnosis. I'm hoping this DVD, along with T. Colin Campbell's book, ""The China Study"", Joel Fuhrman's 5 CD audio accompaniment to ""Eat for Health"", and Charlotte Gerson's book, ""Healing the Gerson Way"" will help expand the treatment universe for this outstanding doctor turned patient.

I recommend it.

I purchased this DVD through the vendor ""A Future Media"". It arrived as expected although the tracking was not quite as transparent as some shipments I've had, but they delivered as promised.",1368316800,,801,5.053030303030303

Of course most doctors mean well. Of course some medical treatments are necessary & successful. Of course some drugs work well. Of course there are well meaning scientists at the FDA. And yet, very much is also very, very wrong, and this DVD will give you the other side of the story, the side you've likely never heard.

Don't miss this amazing opportunity to learn another perspective on medicine & diet, so you can then do further research and make wiser choices. Watch it!",1361059200,,733,4.7637795275590555

8262839,5,B0016K3EMO,"First, let me say that this DVD has the same contents with the other one (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Healing-Cancer-From-Inside-Out-2nd-Edition/dp/B002UURCAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Healing Cancer From Inside Out - 2nd Edition</a>), except that the other DVD has English (and other languages) subtitles as an extra.

There are two parts to this DVD split into an hour each.

--------------------

The first part talks about the cancer industry and how we have been led to believe that they are actually winning the war against cancer. It elaborates on how the cancer industry manipulates facts and figures to make us think that the conventional cancer treatments are effective, when in fact, they are not.

Here's an example:

In a clinical trial, 100 men take a new drug to see if it can reduce the risk of prostate cancer and another 100 men take a placebo pill.

After five years has passed, results showed that one of the men who took the new drug develop prostate cancer, and two of those taking the placebo pills develop prostate cancer.

Based on these data, which statements below do you think is correct?

1. ""NEW MIRACLE DRUG CUTS PROSTATE CANCER RISK BY 50%!""

2. ""NEW DRUG RESULTS IN 1% DROP IN PROSTATE CANCER RISK!""

The fact is, both statements are correct! These statements represent two different ways to express the data.

The first (1.) statement expresses the relative risk reduction. As only one person who took the new drug develop prostate cancer compared to two who took the placebo pill, that's 50% success rate (1/2).

The second (2.) statement expresses the absolute risk reduction. As only one person (1 out of 100) who took the new drug developed prostate cancer compared to two people who took the placebo pill, the absolute difference is 1% (2% minus 1%).

So, if you are a manufacturer of this new drug, which statement would you prefer to use?

And if you are considering a drug to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, would you be willing to take a drug (especially if it's associated with potentially severe side effects) if it reduced your absolute risk for prostate cancer by just 1%?

--------------------

The second part shows how nutrition can be used to prevent and even reverse cancer as well as other degenerative diseases. It explains how much more effective a healthy diet can be in compared to conventional cancer treatments. It features interviews with T. Colin Campbell (Author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-China-Study-The-Most-Comprehensive-Study-of-Nutrition-Ever-Conducted-and-the-Startling-Implications-for-Diet-Weight-Loss-and-Long-term-Health/dp/1932100660/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted and the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss and Long-term Health</a>), Charlotte Gerson (Author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Healing-the-Gerson-Way-Defeating-Cancer-and-Other-Chronic-Diseases/dp/0976018608/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Healing the Gerson Way: Defeating Cancer and Other Chronic Diseases</a>) and other people who has reversed their cancers using a healthy diet.

--------------------

I will definitely recommend this documentary DVD to everyone!

If you, your family or friend has been diagnosed with cancer, I hope you or them will find this DVD and the information within useful! Take charge of your health!

I also recommend another documentary DVD produced by Mike Anderson -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eating-3rd-Edition/dp/B001CRQ8K6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eating - 3rd Edition</a>",1279497600,7,3723,6.234375
