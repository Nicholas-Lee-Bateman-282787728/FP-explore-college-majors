7832955,5,6302985854,"I've been into this Red Shoe-concept since its inception, mostly due to the presence of David Duchovny, so I've viewed a good many of these segments.  The segment involving Richard Tyson is absolutely a breed apart from most anything I've seen in the soft-core category.  Maybe all that  means is that I've led a sheltered life.  In any case, I've (watched ...) this  video more than once, and I strongly encourage others to view it as well.",957830400,9,441,4.675324675324675
7832956,4,6302985854,"An excellent soft core film from the Showtime Red Shoe Diaries series, not all of which are on video.  High production values and a pretty good plot.  It's always a pleasure to see Nina Siemaszko, a very beautiful and sexy  woman, in action.  I recently saw her in ""Sinatra"" where she does  a pretty good job portraying Mia Farrow, one of Sinatra's wives.",952905600,2,355,4.571428571428571
