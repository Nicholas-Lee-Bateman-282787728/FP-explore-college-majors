1984523,3,B0001AVZ9E,"I enjoyed this movie.

One thing bothered me, though.
Stan said that he and Darcy were not legally married just because they were underage and lied about their ages.
It is a fact that if someone with the power to marry a couple pronounces them as married, then they legally are married.
If they lied about anything on the marriage certificate, it wouldn't matter, unless they lied about their names or if they lied about already being married (bigamy).

This was a sweet story about high school seniors who have been dating for a few years.
When she gets pregnant, their lives take a different path than what they had always planned.

But I loved the characters of Darcy and Stan and their teenage friends.

The baby - - Theodosia - - was adorable.

Stan's little sister - - Mary - -  was also adorable.",1456790400,,803,4.503448275862069

1984552,5,B0001AVZ9E,"My wife and I love this film. We've prob seen it more than a dozen times, and it never fails to make us laugh - and cry. The young couple are great, but Kenneth Mars as Randall Batinkoff's dad is especially good, and so is the woman who plays his wife. Oh, and the little girl who plays Batinkoff's sister too. Hey it was a great cast, come to think of it. Young love, hard choices, first apartment, first baby, in-laws - it's all in there, and makes for a wonderful viewing experience. If you want to feel good after a film, watch this one. Very highly recommended.

Naturally their respective parents are completely at odds over the pregnancy and only Ringwald and Batyinkoff think they can make it as parents.

1984577,5,B0001AVZ9E,"When this movie came out in 1988 it was an instant favorite of mine. I suppose I loved it for personal reasons. I could relate well to the characters as I was a pregnant high school senior who was also married at the time. I remember being seven months pregnant as a walked across the stage to get my diploma.

I respected that this movie did not glamorize teenage pregnancy. Everything wasn't perfect and rosey between the two main characters Darcy and Stan. Darcy and Stan are high school sweethearts who find themselves pregnant. After some debate over termination or adoption they decide to marry and keep the baby. They suffer some financial difficulties and make compromises on their dreams. At one point Darcy commits a most unselfish act and breaks up with Stan so that he may pursue his life long dream. But love prevails in the end.

My husband and I know first hand how difficult it was to be young parents. We also know that there isn't much to glamorize about teenage pregnancy or marrying young. But like the characters of Darcy and Stan we also know that love can prevail.

This movie reminds me of that time. I'm Darcy and my husband is Stan. It's been 25 + years and we are still married and still in love.",1369008000,,1223,4.5

But the DVD release sucks. The case is cheap (and my disc fell out of the holder, which now has scratches on it!)
The cover art is cheap and even the title font seems lazy. It looks cheap, it's quite an eye sore.

My most favorite part in when they tell their parents that she's pregnant--Pass the peas? This is really a wonderfully told story, and the acting was great. When Darcy cuts off her hair and has to take a minimum wage job, and they get that crappy apartment above a pizzeria.... you can truly feel the love!! This in my opinion is an underrated film that everyone can enjoy!!",1297555200,,545,4.2
1984593,5,B0001AVZ9E,"This movie came out the same year as John Hughes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/She-s-Having-a-Baby/dp/B00004YNIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">She's Having a Baby</a>, which is about a young married couple struggling with relationships and work, and ultimately the decision to have a baby. This movie is about two seniors in high school who are very much in love, dealing with teenage pregnancy and all the responsibilites that come with it. For keeps is the better movie, but it was never given its proper place in history because , I believe, Shes Having A Baby, overshadowed it. Its ironic because Ringwald is so connected to John Hughes and the one movie that she isn't in of his, gets no joy because of him.

Darcy and Stan are both smart, popular, headed for college and a bright future. Their parents, hers being an uptight single mother who lives vicariously through her daughter and his being proud of an almost college bound architect wannabe. They pregnancy is met with shock, and anger(by the parents) and the whole reveal is actually quite sweet as they both just silently give support to one another.

With 900 bucks and 6 free big macs, they set out to make a family , now that their blood relatives have turned their back. Its a bit overacted by Randall Batinkoff, and Molly is always molly but it worked for me. Its so endearing and heartfelt and the whole movie really makes sense. We have all been in that place where we had to grow up a bit fast at points, and its no fun to leave behind some dreams you have for yourself but in the end things happen when they are supposed too, to make you stronger, to join you closer and to bring new life to the world.

1984604,2,B0001AVZ9E,"Molly Ringwald attempted to transfer from teen dramedies to lighter dramas in her last years and projects under John Hughes.  Here was one that they attempted to teach others a lesson about teen pregnancy, but it didn't pay off as intended.

Molly plays Darcy, a strait laced high school student who is concerned with her grades and school activities.  She is going out with a guy named Stan, who is also a nice, stable guy from a good family and equally as dedicated and strait laced.  They start, naturally, having sex (how about that hoaky scene in the rain under a tree?), and Darcy gets pregnant.  What to do now?  Darcy's bitter, divorced mother says to get an abortion because she was abandoned by Darcy's father.  Stan's family, being a loud Italian / Catholic clan, says to give it up for adoption.  Then, Darcy, afraid of the procedure, backs out of the abortion and she and Stan decide to marry and keep the baby.  Their families turn their backs on them, they get minimum wage jobs, drop out of high school, and it all, naturally, falls apart.

It's a sad tale, to be sure, and a common one.  But, I would suspect that this movie would have a whole different spin if it was a little more realistic.  There is a sense that these two did really love each other, and she did not intentionally get pregnant to trap him.  (I wish I had a nickle for everytime I have seen that happen.)  The white teenage girl who becomes pregnant is most likely to be living in a trailer park, while most of the black teenage girls are living in slums.  The baby's daddy is usually no where to be found, not even caring enough to call the kid on his/her birthday.  Mommy's on Medicaid, the baby's born with some defect because Mommy didn't get the right prenatal care, Mommy starts popping pills and smoking stuff.  They did a good job of showing how both parents become frazzled when having to deal with dirty diapers, paying the bills, and the crying baby.  But, I doubt that Daddy would have stuck around as long as he did.  He would have bailed a long time ago.

And how about that ending?  Stan realizes his pig behavior was wrong, cleans up, and begs Darcy's forgiveness.  She graduates from high school, and there is a hope at the end that things will work out for them as they get back together.

I'm an optimist, really I am.  I want to believe that things will work out, but a person has to work hard for what they want.  And all kinds of things in life are hard, marriage/family being one of them.  If it was easy, everyone would do it.  Making babies is easy, but being a parent and maintaining a marriage is hard work.  Not everyone is ready, not everyone is responsible, and not everyone should do it at all.  We have to be willing to work to make things work, and you often times can't get the other person to see eye to eye with you.  They quit on you.  And you become bitter and angry because you felt that you carried the weight of the others.  What a mess.

So the message here is, kids, ""Don't do it"".  But, kids will do it anyway despite the wrath of their parents and community outrage.  So put condoms in school, and tell kids to use them.  Don't like that, parents?  Well, you better get over it.",1179964800,,3210,4.361486486486487

I had a baby when I was 15 and my boyfriend and I split up for a short time then got back together and we are still together 20 years later (married at 17) so unlike what 'Rochelle O'Gorman' says (who gave the Editorial Review on this movie) teenage couples staying together is sometimes and can be a reality.

Molly's husband has gotten a scholarship to a prestigious school and he's willing to give it up to help her with the baby, but she doesn't want him to. In the end she just about forces him to take the scholarship and he does.

Mixed in with the humor and comedy, there is a great lesson on teen pregnancy and getting married young. It's harder than it looks and this is an excellent movie for young girls to watch and learn from!",1112745600,,826,4.254777070063694

1984635,5,B0001AVZ9E,"This is not a typical brat pack movie. 80's music doesn't blare in the background, there isn't a group of characters that seem to stay together in films. But, it's just as good as all of the other brat pack movies.  There is only one brat pack member, and one is all it needs- Molly Ringwald.
Molly plays a high school senior named Darcy who is in love.  Her boyfriend, Stan is played by Randall Batinkoff.  Even though he is not a popular actor, he really shows talent in this film.  When a night of passion in the rain leads to Darcy getting pregnant, they are faced with an important decision.  Her mom says abortion, his parents say adoption. Stan and Marcy say ""we're keeping it"".  When they are shunned from the family, they are forced to grow up quickly- marriage, jobs, bills and putting off college are all things this couple go through in the name of love. But will this love for eachother be enough to keep their family together?
 This is a serious movie that looks at teenage pregnancy.  It's not intended to be used as a brochure, but just as a fictional ""what-if"".  Molly Ringwald really shows true talent in this movie, dealing with more than just missed birthdays and a day of dentention.  Although this film was made in the mix of the other 80's cult flicks, this one sticks out as a source of seeing the true talent that Molly has.",1024185600,,1349,4.425101214574899

Both of their  parents have shunned them, and they are all alone. Her new husband finds  that he has gotten into MIT, only to realize he cannot go at all. Both of  their dreams of going onto college and leading successful lives are ruined,  yet they manage to stay together through thick and thin.

The young couple were  really very sweet, and I could relate to it - the way that tough times do  test love, once the innocent feelings of romance are harshly knocked out of  the way by the urgent realities of life.

1984651,1,B0001AVZ9E,"First of all, Grammys are for works of MUSIC, not cinema. However, were they for honoring the works of cinematic treasures, FOR KEEPS?, indeed, would be least worthy of any nods.
Molly Ringwald's role choices began  to get sketchier after the 1986 release of PRETTY IN PINK. The 1987  romantic comedy THE PICK-UP ARTIST, featuring Robert Downey, Jr., was an  underrated delight, while the 1988 U.S. release of Jean-Luc Godard's  avant-garde KING LEAR, in which she portrayed ""Cordelia,""  demonstrated her gift for more mature roles.
Released January 1988,  before KING LEAR, FOR KEEPS? is a lifeless ""dramedy"" chronicling  the trials and tribulations of a high school couple who give birth to an  illegitimate child. ""Darcy"" (Molly Ringwald) is an ambitious  honor-roll student with aspirations in journalism, while ""Stan""  (Randall Batinkoff, never seen or heard from again) is her shoe-selling  beau whose dream is to walk the halls of CalTech.
Like most pictures that  probe teenage sexuality and unplanned pregnancy, the film portrays the  child as the mistake, not the decision its characters have made to engage  in sex before marriage. Such treatment is often labeled  ""realistic,"" since we know teenagers often partake in premarital  sex, as do most adults, for that matter. Just because it is  ""realistic"" doesn't make it morally or socially responsible.
However, the issue of morality is never debated here, since the  filmmakers have chosen portray the decision these CHILDREN have made to  keep their baby, in a positive light. Indeed, any mother who decides to  raise her child and give it the gift of life is an honorable person.  However, when she has agreed to commit to that child before she has  committed to its father, she is making a mistake that will leave a negative  impact upon her, her child and its father.
When ""Stan"" suggests  the idea of ""giving it up for abortion...adoption,"" he makes a  despicable Freudian slip. As a pro-life activist and a human being, this  odious line is so completely offensive, especially since it's played for  laughs.
The ridiculous idea that ""Darcy"" may earn her diploma  by completing night school courses is not only entirely unfounded, it is  totally ridiculous. Night school courses are either general education  classes for dropouts or  enrichment courses for people who have already  graduated. An honor-roll student working for the school paper would be  undertaking a challenging courseload, not basic mathematics, home economics  or remedial English.
Not surprisingly, FOR KEEPS? met with minimal  box-office success. I hesitate to say this because I so love her, but, the  train wreck that is this worthless picture is totally undeserving of the  fine talents of Miss Molly Ringwald.",945993600,,2752,5.186788154897494

the young actor who played her boyfriend was very good-kudos on his acting chops.
As for the storyline-there are parents who (spoiler alert) will not help out their kids in this kind of a situation and I disagree with them, but it added to the realism and the angst the young parents had to go through.
I recommend it wholeheartedly and give it a five star rating.
