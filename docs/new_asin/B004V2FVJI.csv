8442622,4,B004V2FVJI,"Shakti is a wonder of a film. The highlight of the film is the powerhouse performances by both the legends-Amitabh Bachchan and Dilip Kumar. Amitabh able displays all emotions with such talents(His character is more or less similar to that of Deewaar) and he gives and equally stunning performance. Dilip Kumar too gives a superb performance that won him the Best Actor award. But well, Amitabh was the more deserving contender for the award because actually he is the one who ends up stealing the show. But, Shakti is somewhat similar to Deewaar. Deewaar is a brilliant classic. Shakti follows suit. See it for the stunning performances and powerful plot.",1306281600,,656,4.972727272727273
8442623,4,B004V2FVJI,"One of the finest movies made by Ramesh Sippy the renowned director who made ""Sholay"".
  The story revolves around the highly principled father(Dilip Kumar) and his equally strong headed son (Amitabh Bachchan). Both have delivered excellent perfomances but I tend to like Bachchan's more. The father is a honest police officer and due to a kidnapping incident his son slowly drifts away from him and starts working for a smuggler.
  The movie moves at a gradual pace slowly showing the lives of the father and son conflict and the toll it takes on Amitabh's mother (Rakhee) and his girlfriend (Smita Patil).
  A must see movie with an excellent screenplay and great dialogues.",1086048000,2,676,4.991071428571429
