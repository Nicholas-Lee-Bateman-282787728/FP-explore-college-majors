7995769,3,B0000A4GIO,"Naomi (Saori Kitagawa) makes a living as a lesbian porn film director in Japan. Because the films she makes have a mostly male audience, her friends think that she is a sellout. Looking for someone non-judgmental to chat with, Naomi turns to her secret online friend Sugar.

When Naomi is offered a job directing an all-girl dating game show, she jumps at the chance to direct something other than porn. Naomi casts best friend Azusa (Saki) and executive/exotic dancer Miki (C.Snatch Z) as contestants despite the fact that Azusa already has a girlfriend. Complications ensue when Naomi discovers that Miki and Sugar are the same person.

Director Desiree Lim has created the first Japanese film to be made by and about lesbians and lesbian relationships. Sugar Sweet is a thought-provoking journey through the little-known world of Japanese urban dyke culture.

Saori Kitagawa admirably portrays the frazzled Naomi, looking for her big break while trying to artistically direct lesbian porn.

7995770,1,B0000A4GIO,"<strong>Sugar Sweet</strong> (Desiree Lim, 2001)

<em>Sugar Sweet</em>, Desiree Lim's made-for-Japanese-TV rom-com-dram, has some important things to say, and didn't have a great deal of time to say them in (one assumes the 67-minute running time came from network strictures rather than Lim). Under the right circumstances, that sort of economy can lead to short, brilliant films that will stay with the viewer long after he's finished watching; many of the entries in Showtime's Masters of Horror series are good examples of this. <em>Sugar Sweet</em>, on the other hand, is none of those things, a movie that celebrates dissolute ennui among its characters, barely touches on any of the themes it so desperately wants to explore, and was in great need of at least one more script rewrite to work with, rather than against, the movie's leanness where runtime was concerned.

Plot: Naomi (<em>Starfish Hotel</em>'s Saori Kitagawa) is a director of lesbian porn. While there is a strong subsulture of porn-directed-by-women in the Occident, 'twould seem Japan is not as kind to its female porn directors, because as we open, Naomi is being berated by her studio for making movies that aren't going to get guys off (because, presumably, women in Japan don't watch porn. Just like they didn't in America. Suuuuuuuuuure). She is sent from her producer's office in shame, tasked to make a more--well, pornlike--porn film. Instead, she tells them to go stuff it (not to their faces, of course) and embraces a hot new craze, reality TV, working on a lesbian dating series. Needless to say, she finds herself falling for one of her subjects, and when she's not shooting the series or placating her boss (after all, she wants to keep that career path open in case she needs to fall back on it), she's either canoodling with her circle of oh-so-cynical real-life pals or pouring out her heart to a new online friend who really, truly seems to understand her.

If you've seen more than three Lifetime Original Movies in your life, that brief synopsis tells you everything you need to know about where this movie is going, including the Big Reveal(TM) at the end, and that is its biggest problem. <em>Sugar Sweet</em> doesn't try to do thing one differently than the average rom-com-dram, which is ironic given its protagonist's predicament. Where Naomi isn't making porn films guys can get off to, Lim <em>is</em> making rom-com-drams that will transport the lowest common denominator to heights of utterly safe, predictable ecstasy. The fact that all the movie's main characters are female seems more as if it were a matter of convenience than a desire to examine, or even illustrate, the differences in the dating scene between heteros and lesbians; there's little dialogue here, no matter in which arena Naomi happens to be interacting with others, that you wouldn't here between [insert unconventionally-beautiful Nicholas Sparks heroine] and [completely conventionally beautiful Nicholas Sparks hero]. It's depressing, and more to the point, it seems emotionally dishonest. *",1341532800,,3070,5.173038229376258
7995771,1,B0000A4GIO,"This film...it's flaky and trashy. From the preview it looked very intersting so I picked it up, but it's not so please pass this up. The storylines bounce from one to the other which is confusing. Even the interview with the director of the film in the special feature was boring and confusing, I just couldn't hear nor understand what they were saying most of the time.",1174953600,,371,4.552238805970149
7995772,1,B0000A4GIO,"I hated this film. The women in it were not attractive or sexy, and the plot was incredibly stupid and misogynistic.  This film is about a Japanese woman who decides to produce her own lesbian porno flick (after working in the straight Japanese porno industry for years with her misogynistic male comrades) and explores her interactions with the actress she hires to star in her porno film.  This film had very unsexy and graphic sex scenes and unlikable characters. What's shocking is that this movie was actually produced by a lesbian ....",1108684800,15,541,4.869565217391305
7995773,1,B0000A4GIO,Not good...poor story line dull acting...oh what a tragedy...could have been better with a better script or actresses...hmmm maybe not..should have donated the money to make this to a womens shelter and done more good...,1076544000,9,220,5.314285714285714
7995774,1,B0000A4GIO,"I wanted to like it.  I fell asleep.  Even while reading the poorly written subtitles.  Maybe that is the problem with the film...  When you hear a character speaking for 30 seconds and yet the subtitle only says ""yes, you're right"" you know you're missing out on something.  You simply can't blame the director or script writer for that.  Blame the poor translation.
That said, I still don't recommend the film:
*I don't speak Japanese so I can't say whether the story-line would have been good in spite of the bad translation.
*I kept getting the characters confused, because I couldn't look at them long enough to know them because I had to keep reading the dialog.  (Don't get me wrong, I usually have no problem following stories with subtitles...)
*It was just plain boring.",1072656000,22,780,4.733333333333333
7995775,1,B0000A4GIO,"The story will make you ask, story what story? wait a second there is no real plot here....The acting....I believe that is limited...the alluring sexual content advertised ...was no where to be found...I wanted to like this film, but I just have to be truthful...This is a poorly made lesbian film...simply mundane...Can't someone make an intelligent lesbian film that does not insult our intelligence...",1071532800,12,404,5.328125
7995776,1,B0000A4GIO,"Sugar Sweet is an ineffective lesbian film. Poor acting, poor dialogue, and an unintelligent script...Makes you long for the days of even Desert Hearts, Lianna, even Personal Best is better.
If you need a new flick go see Big Eden(feminem guys but great film) or A Family Affair (lesbian). Sugar sweet is a mistake.",1070236800,7,315,4.851851851851852
7995777,1,B0000A4GIO,"Sugar Sweet??? This film bored me to sleep. Just happy I did not buy it. The film tries to be sexy tries to be well acted and is neither. Just because it is a lesbian movie, did not make it good, and that is from a lesbian reviewer. Why there are few great lesbian films, I have not a clue. If you need to see a great lesbian film go buy A Family Affair, Lianna, Desert Hearts,Aimee and Jaguar, or even The Killing of Sister George(for old classic film value) ...but forget Sugar sweet...it is sour",1069459200,19,498,4.197916666666667
