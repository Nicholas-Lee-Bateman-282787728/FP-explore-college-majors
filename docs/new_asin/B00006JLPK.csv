The premise is that the filmmaker has discovered a bunch of video footage on a second-hand server drive and has put it on a DVD.  The story is about a bunch of unpleasant sleazeballs (politicians, lobbyists, prostitutes, blackmailers, etc.) It is told mostly from the POV of a mentally unstable mistress of a political lobbyist, who she has learned is showing her as much loyalty as he is affording his wife.  So the mistress gets some videocams, and starts pursuing and collecting the guy's shenanigans.  The DVD never quite comes together, but is somewhat entertaining and is very provocative in that the story is told almost at random, because you are apparently going through a bunch of files jumbled together and not edited. It can make you think about the common linear conventions of plotlines and how they can be manipulated or completely broken down.  I would not recommend this as light entertainment, but I would recommend it to someone who likes black comedy (think ""The Player"") and/or who is interested in exploring a very different way of telling a story.",1381708800,,1292,4.908256880733945

It was not to say the least...The main character gets pretty annoying after a while and the navigation between all of the different clips gave me a headache.  Save your money, if you are really interested try it on netflix or blockbuster.",1214870400,,303,4.592592592592593
