7973205,3,B00006SFOO,"I found this tape of limited value.  It is, like the rest of his ""Ultimate workout series"" a bunch of edited clips from of Billy's other tapes.  Unfortunatly, the editing was not done very carefully and sometimes you end up working one side of your body, but not the other.  There is one crunching section that is good, it is toward the end.  That is the only reason I gave it 3 stars.  What I do is go to the end and rewind to the point the crunch section begins.  Then I Take out this tape, and put in one of the other full work out tapes like the Impact Full Contact workout and do that, then put this tape back in and do the crunch session to  finish off my workout.  Be warned, it does not give much stretching in between the individual crunch exercises.  I don't know if this is intentional or not.  It will start to show a stretch, but then cut to another exercise before the stretch is done.  The ending cool down section is also kind of weak.  It does some cool down stretches, but I would use another tape with a complete cool down section to end my workout with.",1042848000,17,1073,4.155339805825243
7973206,4,B00006SFOO,"ok, i know it hasn't come out, but I saw a clip of it, and letting everybody know whats in store with this video.
It is about 55 minutes long, and it is a compilation of all the 'live' volumes, i think volumes 2-12.
It wasn't redone, just all the volumes edited together.
It seems to be about 25mins of kicks and some other 20 or so on toning the abs.
It has many of the old moves, but some are slightly changed, maybe makes them more advanced than the old positions.
I just think they should had re-recorded these 'ultimate' series, because u can see the people's outfits change every few minutes! that is why i give it 4 stars and not the 5.",1039046400,8,643,4.152
