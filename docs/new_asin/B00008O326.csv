7985942,3,B00008O326,"Having never seen the Japanese episodes of Dragon Ball GT, I was a little lost when I purchased this movie. It seemed to jump right in the middle of an action sequence which had no explaining as to where, when or why; that is, until later on when they show BRIEF ""flashbacks."" I really was glad to have bought this video as I am a big DBZ fan, but I wish I could have been able to see the first 15 episodes previous; however, as I have discovered, FUNimation decided to jump right into the action instead of giving us the ""real story,"" which is rumored that they will be releasing the first 15 episodes later on.
All in all, as long as you don't mind it being out of sequence, and having things explained briefly in flashback form, I would recommend this video for you.",1053734400,3,769,4.273972602739726
