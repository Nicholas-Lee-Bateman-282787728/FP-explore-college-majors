1104064,3,6305884862,"""Journey To The West"" a 500-year-old novel with even older roots in Chinese legend, was the primary inspiration for Akira Toriyama's ""Dragonball"" series. In the original, Goku was a ""Monkey King,""  a former resident of Heaven who had been punished for his arrogance and mischief. To make amends he was assigned as helper to a Monk whose task was to bring Buddhist scriptures from India to China, and help spread the new faith that was to replace Taoist and Confucian beliefs.
In Toriyama's original Dragonball version (later revised further for ""Dragonball Z""), Goku is a monkey-boy in pursuit of 7 ""dragonballs."" It was only the character of Goku that was lifted from the classic; the rest is Toriyama's own myth-making.
While this movie does not follow Toriyama's conception exactly, it is a lot closer to it than it is to any traditional Chinese legends. The Dragonballs are called Dragon Pearls in the dub, but there is no Chinese legend about the pursuit of such things; nor is there any Chinese legend with a character named ""Bulma,"" which is actually a corruption of the word ""Bloomers"" and is a reference to lady's underpants.
Most of the film's deviations from the manga and animation can be explained by two things:
1. The dub translation changed most of the characters' names, and changed ""Dragonballs"" to ""Dragon Pearls."" I suspect the dub was done before the Toriyama works were well-known stateside.
2. It is much more expensive to accomplish SFX in live-action films than in comics and cartoons.
So, contrary to other reviews here, don't take this as anything but an adaptation of Toriyama's work. If you are interested in a dumbed-down version of the already-dumb anime inspired by a Chinese classic, here's your ticket. But don't go thinking you are watching anything to do with ancient Chinese culture.
As to the somewhat high rating I am giving this, the whole movie fascinated me, and I loved it the same way I enjoyed the He-Man movie that featured Frank Langella as Skeletor, just a few years after he played Dracula. I would have rated it higher but that would mislead some people into thinking this was a good movie; it isn't. What it is, is a hoot.",1076457600,,2173,4.825737265415549
1104065,3,6305884862,"Unlike most peole who watch this movie, I know it is based on the Chinese legend, and not the manga created by Akira Toriyama.  Eventually Toriyama chose to make Goku an alien and break away from the legend.  That aside this is an interesting movie, but nothing spectacular.  If you are a DBZ fan however, you should check it out if you want to know what the series was originally based on.",1038787200,,390,4.388888888888889

1104067,3,6305884862,"This movie isn't based on the Dragonball and Dragonball Z anime tv series. It is based on the original manga comic, which follows a different storyline, and is itself based on the old Chinese legend ""Journey to the West,"" where the character named Goku in DBZ is in fact called ""Monkey Boy.""
It is a low budget movie, and that shows, but the story was fairly good as long as you didn't keep trying to call the characters after their DBZ counterparts. The characters are distinct.
Not the best movie I've seen by a long shot. I hope the live action DBZ movie currently in thr works is far superior in story, sfx, etc.
But some of the criticism here was undeserved, and obviously written by people who never bothered to check the origin of the movie on the internet, even though they claimed to be DB/Z fans.",1029196800,,806,4.452702702702703

1104069,1,6305884862,"This movie is just totally pathetic.  Anyone with high standards should stay away from it.  On the other hand, if you're a big fan of Dragonball or Dragonball Z and you think it would be fun to watch some low budget butchering of a decent anime you should defiantly buy it now.",1013299200,,277,4.3076923076923075
1104070,2,6305884862,"this movie SUCKS! but i WILL give credit for the actual stage fighting! they showed they could actually fight, the fights don't look too fake. But if you are a dragonballz fan, like me this movie is STUPID! they tried to mix in dragonball with dragonball z and turned out stupid. when monkey boy (goku in the real version) flies it looks soo fake! and since when did sayjin's have CURLY hair? yuk! they have SPIKED hair! and goku used the magic cloud cuz he couldn't fly, and when he could fly, he didn't need the magic, the candy cloud anymore! anyways... they didn't even do a KAMEHAMEHA! and thats the dragonball main move! and ALSO! they don't even go super sayjin! and TOO, they couldn't even get the damn names right! the movie looks sooo fake! so basically... this movie is WACK! and would be worth about a penny to a dragon ball, dragonball z or dragonball gt fan.",1011484800,,872,4.45625
1104071,1,6305884862,"I'm not a huge Dragonball fan, but I am a huge fan of outlandish films, especially those from the far east, so I bought this film hoping to get a lot of good laughs at it's expense.  What actually happened was me groaning a lot, and wondering just what the heck was supposed to be going on in this stinker, as I dozed off again and again.  The plot is so threadbare that it's about as developed as an Power Rangers episode, and the martial arts are along the same caliber.  The special effects are laughable at best (couldn't they do better than that rubber crocodile?) and the dubbing is just plain pathetic.  I can't recommed this film to anyone, except people who enjoy suffering through absolute dreck.  I would've given it no stars if it were possible.",1007683200,,757,4.456521739130435
1104072,3,6305884862,"Hi, I'm a big fan of Dragonball, but what a lot of people don't understand is that Dragonball and Dragonball Z are two diffrent series.  Dragonball is an adaption of the chinese book ""Journey to the West,"" and stars the monkey boy Son Goku.  It is a comedy adventure series with a little action.  DBZ on the other hand is the story of the Goku's family.  It is an action series with a little adventure and comedy.  They are both very good however, but may not be everyones cup of tea.  On a side note, try and get the uncut version of the anime, the cut versions are horribly butchered and look silly.  Thaks for letting me rant.  Your quite sad if you've read this far.  To regain your life read a book (""Journey West"" is a good start) ^_^0",998352000,,741,4.235714285714286
1104073,1,6305884862,"Well, I'm a new fan to Dragonball and I like some Hong Kong action films so I thought I'd check this out. It's not that great. Some of the fight scenes are really good and the music is nice, but the film suffers from the  sillyness that many HK films do (and not good silly). I guess that's just  what foreign audiences like cause many films are like that with  overexagerrated emotions and gestures. The dub job is not great but not bad  either considering it's much harder to synch English to live-action lip  movements. There is some cussing and some sexual references so you probably  don't want to let small children watch this. The FX are...well, standard I  suppose. The names are completely different than the original DB names. I  don't know if that's how it was in the original version of this film in  China or not. I'm guessing Monkey Boy is Goku and Seetoe is Bulma. Turtle  Man is Master Roshi and I'm not that well versed in DB history to try and  match the rest. The villian in this film is named King Horn and I have no  idea if he is part of the Japanese DB story. Also, his two henchmen look  very non-Asian. Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this film unless you really  have a hankering to see it for yourself. I'm just glad the DVD version is  cheaper that the VHS.",962496000,,1282,4.350210970464135
1104124,2,6305884862,"When I first heard this live action Dragonball movie was coming out I was more then apprehensive. Now I know why people say you should trust your gut. I don't think anyone but true fans of the show will even buy this,  however, I don't think anyone, know matter who you are, will enjoy this.  The story is ludicrous. It is basically a summary of the first season of  Dragonball Z with some characters missing. In summation, the truest fans of  the show will enjoy this for the comedy, but the magic of watching a small  goateed man with a shell on his back try to jump on a flying cloud doesn't  last that long. Look somewhere else.",961200000,,632,4.313559322033898

Some character's names and likenesses have been changed but only due to the limitations of the films budget.

7898961,4,6305884862,"This is a Terrible movie - and that's why we bought it. Ghastly costumes, incredibly lame special effects, 80s hairstyles that make Wham look stylish... you watch it, unable to believe that it truly is that bad. We specifically show it to friends to hear their horror. And the dubbing...

Imagine, if you would, a live-action prequel to ""Dragonball-Z"", made cheaply in Thailand or Malaysia. Imagine that because of copyright problems, when it was dubbed into English it had to be changed to ""Dragonpearl"". The case still says ""Dragon Ball"", the music says ""Dragon Ball"", but all the way through they refer to ""Dragon Pearls"".

Then imagine a grandfather with a wig that looks like a small rodent, a crocodile less convincing than the rubber octopus in ""Bride of the Monster"", and a dialogue that is excruciating.

Location: Wildnerness near the crocodile pond. Boy is carrying crocodile across his shoulders - girl driving towards him.

Boy: ""That girl looks strange.""

(Assorted bits where he stops her car with his bare hands, she shoots him and he's not hurt)

Girl: ""I'm not a witch - I'm a human being.""

""You are?""

""Look at me closely. Do I look like a witch?""
(She nances around in a fashionable version of a safari outfit - those boots couldn't go very far in that terrain.)

Boy: Maybe not. But I still feel that you're different from me.

Girl: Of course we're different. You're a boy and I'm a girl, you know.

(amazed) Oh! You're a girl? Are you really a girl?
(remember, people, not 4 minutes ago he called her a girl.)

Haven't you ever seen a woman before?

No.... but Grandad told me that there are two different kinds of people. One is boys and the other is girls, so you must be the other kind of people. Girls, right?

Yes. A boy and a girl, well, apart from some physical differences, are basically the same.

Oh yes, I remember he said a girl's chest is bigger than a boy's. But that's strange. (approaching her with an investigative look in his eye) Why should your chest be bigger? (jumps towards her) Hey, can I take a look?

Hey! You can't touch me!

He retreats, looking disappointed at a lack of discovery.

My Grandpa said that too. He said a boy mustn't touch a girl. He said that those that do are called ... (he's obviously searching for the right word here )

(Together they find the right word. Delightedly shouting:) RAPISTS!

7898962,1,6305884862,"Easily one of the more painful movies I've ever seen.  I love bad movies, and this one is terrible.  You know within the first 5 minutes that this film is going to be a painful ordeal.  I suggest you grab a few friends to help you mock the film.  The MST3K (If you don't know, you'd better call somebody) treatment is the only reason to give this one a go.",1190505600,,356,4.042857142857143
7898963,4,6305884862,"No, this is not a joke review, i'm one hundred percent serious. I thought this movie was great. It's more or less the exact same story as presented in the first arc of the show-or as told by the movie, Dragonball: The Path to Power.

Every character is there, Goku, Bulma, Oolong, Yamcha, Roshi, Pilaf, they're just under different names-probably due to the translation differences (this wasn't a Japanese movie, it's Chinese). Many events are ripped STRAIGHT OUT OF THE EPISODES-such as Goku fighting with animals for his dinner, him attacking Bulmas car, Oolong as a sex crazy pig abducting girls, Yamcha and Goku's fight, and so on.

Is it campy, cheesy, badly dubbed, and with subpar special effects and fight scenes? Well let me remind you that while it is a movie based on Dragonball, IT IS ALSO A B-RATED CHINESE KUNG FU MOVIE! Watch any kung fu martial arts movie from especially the seventies or so and you'll see they're exactly the same. Many of these are considered cult classics.

Long story short, you can't go into this movie thinking it's gonna be some kind of Hollywood blockbuster special effects masterpiece like the Matrix, you have to expect it to be a low budget Chinese kung fu movie based on a childrens cartoon show. You wouldn't watch a kindergarten theatre production and expect to see Broadway level material would you? This is the same principal.

Lower your expectations and you're never dissapointed.",1189814400,,1431,4.852459016393443
7898964,3,6305884862,"Watch this movie only if you like B-movies, because as a film by itself, it isn't very good.  Graphics are laughable, and the dubbing at times was badly translated, not to mention the fact that the movie is clearly titled Dragonball, when the actual balls are refered to throughout the movie as ""dragon pearls.""  The acting is worthy of daytime soap, and some of the make-up was a scary reminder of the 80's, but the movie is a fair representation of the anime series.  Basically, do not buy this unless you have seen the series at some point, and can enjoy a b-movie.",1163462400,,568,4.495145631067961

Nothing can compare to a little boy carrying a cardboard crocodile and getting shot by a gun that shoots out little sparkles.  How can you imagine something funnier than a fat asian smacking his man boobs and his face and becoming a busty hawaiin drag queen?  It's impossible my friend, and this movie takes everything.  You have led a useless life if you have never seen this movie.  I laughed to the point of not being able to breathe and felt dizzy with utter hysteria.  I love this movie with all of my monkey boy heart.  This movie will let all your dragon pearl wishes come true,  my esteemed colleagues.",1096156800,,667,4.546218487394958
7898966,5,6305884862,"This movie will make a lot more sense to you if you compare it to the Dragonball series, NOT to Dragonball Z. The Magic Begins includes most of the characters in the show and introduces Goku as a little boy still living with his grandfather in the woods. Goku is in possession of the four star dragon ball (called ""dragon pearl"" here) and the evil King Horn is out to gather the remaining six balls so he can summon the dragon and make an evil wish. Goku must find the remaining dragon balls before King Horn gets his hands on them, and in doing so, runs into a wacky cast of characters along the way.

The movie sticks very closely to the show: Goku has his power pole and later gets the flying nimbus from Master Roshi; when Goku and Bulma first meet she's the first girl Goku's ever seen, and they meet when Goku is carrying an alligator back to his home for dinner, just like in the show. Oolong is a shapeshifter and Yamcha is scared of girls and challenges Goku at every turn. The hilarious Master Roshi is a perv as always, and his scenes with Oolong as Bulma are also straight from the show.

You have to have a sense of humor to truly appreciate this movie. The special effects are lacking and the dubbing is awful, but the fight scenes are fun and the plot's pretty good. If you appreciate Toriyama's Dragonball at all, you're sure to find a good time in this movie.

Here's a list of characters as they relate to the show, as far as I can tell:

 Monkey Boy - Goku
 Grandpa Sparkle - Grandpa Gohan
 Seetoe - Bulma
 Westwood - Yamcha (Westwood's wise cracking bird is probably Puar)
 Pig Fairy - Oolong
 Turtle Man - Master Roshi
 King Horn - Emperor Pilaf (Pilaf's cronies are probably Mai and Xiu)",1084838400,,1709,4.326018808777429
