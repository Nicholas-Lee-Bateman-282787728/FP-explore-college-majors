8723270,1,B01127XNJE,"This movie is awfull. Even my 5 year old walked away. The only funny seen is when one of the dogs farts, having been on the receiving end from my dog I get that. A movie like this usually requires a person to suspend reality for awhile and have fun with the ridiculous. This movie did not do that. even after my 5 year old walked away I kept watching hoping there would be some redeeming quality. Sadly it never got better. If you really want to see this I suggest renting it first. You won't feel so bad.",1451692800,,505,4.111111111111111

8723272,2,B01127XNJE,"This movie is very boring and the lip syncing of the dogs is poorly done.  If it was just me finding this moving boring, I wouldn't have rated it so low but the kids found it boring as well and wanted to watch something else.",1443916800,,225,4.0
8723273,5,B01127XNJE,My kids love this movie. There's a scene where the referee walks in in the dogs eating. One of the dogs lets go a stinker and the referee passes out. I even laughed out loud. That ref is hilarious. Wish he's in more scenes in the next one.,1443830400,2,239,4.0
