8154067,1,B000K2UHB0,This guy is clueless about teaching!  Right away he jumps into advanced technique and if you are a beginner or advanced beginner you will be lost and frustrated. I have been coaching sports for over 40 years and I know what I am talking about.  Don't waste your money like I did.  I love to two step and I had high hopes about  this dvd that quickly turned sour after viewing the first part of this dvd,1449705600,,402,4.181818181818182
8154068,5,B000K2UHB0,"I have always found Progressive Two Step to be one harder dances to learn and dance. The P-2-Step dance goes from fast, to very fast counter clockwise around the dance floor to country/western music.
This DVD is the best on offered on Amazon. There are six amalgamations with six to eight patterns in each. That is enough to keep one busy for six months to a year learning these moves. The DVD is over 60 minutes long. Finding a dance DVD over 60 minutes is hard to do. Sometimes, they are mostly 60 minutes of talking, not dancing!  He covers the basic moves, then moves on to intermediate patterns. He moves right along, with the help of Erica Drollinger. He may move too fast for some tastes. I like the fast pace, because on a DVD one can watch it over and over again. If one has a regular dance partner to practice with, and can take some lessons at a dance studio, then one can learn this dance more quickly.

Covers: ladies turns and spins, tucks, promenade, skaters positions, bowtie, belt loop turns and many others. One can find the list of amalgamations at [...], or austin-dance-instruction.",1248825600,,1103,4.565656565656566
8154069,2,B000K2UHB0,"I think this would be an okay video if it weren't listed as volume 1.  If I knew what I was doing and had a good foundation, I might have been able to keep up with this one.  The instruction isn't all that thorough and though the instructors dance well, I wasn't impressed with this video as a teaching tool. I'd recommend starting somewhere else if you are new to Two-Step.",1179619200,,374,4.253521126760563
