7516588,4,B017S3OP7A,"A NASA crew on Mars evacuates during a bad storm, Mark (Matt Damon) is believed dead and is left behind. However, he is not dead and needs to be resourceful to survive until the next mission, over a year away. However it it not as bad as ""Gravity"" or ""Cast Away"" without Wilson. Mark (plot spoiler) manages to make contact with Earth and we have a subplot to break up the monotony of a one man play.

The film is designed primarily for science geeks. There is a lot of terms for them, many are broken down, some inanely as when a sling shot effect had to be explained to the head of NASA, something they do all the time.

With all the hype of an Oscar nomination, I thought the film would have been better. It was good, I enjoyed it, but I don't believe it belongs in the Science Fiction hall of fame. There are no space aliens, ghosts, or anything crazy like that. Science fiction, not science fantasy.

As far as science goes, NASA is leery of sending anyone to Mars as the radiation dose they will get on a round trip would be considered a lifetime dose for the astronauts, ending their careers and greatly increasing the risk of a latent radiation induced cancer etc.

Guide: 2 spoken F-bombs, a few mouthed F-bombs and WTF, and a writing of ""f***ing"" for the F-bomb. Male butt nudity. Nice LOTR reference, although I would have made Sean Bean ignorant of it.",1447977600,,1363,4.375494071146245
7516589,4,B017S3OP7A,"?? 3 reviews so far, and they all say it's ""Rocky""????????

It's not Rocky.

If you want to say its Robinson Crusoe, fine, but Rocky, not at all.

My bottom line is that its technically and visually excellent, follows the books storyline very closely, but totally fails to tell the story.  I would recommend reading the book first.  If you read the book after seeing the movie, the books spoiled for you, but vice-versa, no.  In fact there are  a lot of things in the movie that don't make sense if you haven't read the book.  Oh, youll still follow the general outlines OK, but a lot of things just don't work very well because they're slavishly, but incompletely and ineffectively, copied.

I haven't seen the disc; I just recently saw the movie, in a theater, in 3D, so I'm reviewing the movie, not the Blu-Ray disc version.
My opinion, the 3D adds little and is not worth the trouble.
I've read the book, so that's where I'm coming from.  I'm evaluating this as an adaptation of a book-- and I would give the book 5 stars, or maybe I did; I don't remember whether I ever reviewed it or not.
If you've read the book, there are only mild spoilers for the movie in this review, nothing really worth worrying about.

Technically, I think the movie is excellent, and for a Hollywood blockbuster movie, its much better than expected.  It doesnt butcher the original, in fact follows it too slavishly, but it totally fails, over and over again, to deliver the punch of the story, the dramatic impact.  Based on that, it would rate it much, much lower, but sort of grading it on a curve as a Hollywood project, Ill knock off only the one star.  One star as a drama, Im sorry.  Five stars as a Hollywood SF movie.  Weighted average, 4 stars.

First of all, the movie, for a Hollywood adaptation of a book, is very very good, though that's kind of a low bar.  I mean, the acting, direction, all technical aspects are excellent, maybe impeccable.  The script doesn't really do anything terrible to the original; in fact it follows it very closely except for a couple of silly Hollywood things at the end.  I disagree with some of the casting choices; Mindy Park should be Asian, for heaven's sake, and people like Sean Bean and Chiwetl Ejiofor are wasted.  If they have to have Chiwetl in the movie, I would much rather have seen him as Watney (the lead, if you haven't seen or read it).  That would have been much more interesting.  No reason Watney has to be white; I'm not sure if that's even specified in the book.  Actually Damon may be wasted too, to some extent.  I think the best casting for Watney would have been an unknown, or relative unknown.  Putting an all-purpose American leading man in the role, I suppose it sells tickets, but it makes hard to forget it's a movie.

Secondly, I get the feeling that they played it safe with this adaptation.  Never mind if Matt Damon is right for the part; he never misses.  Got a major nonwhite supporting character?  Get me Chiwetl Ejiofor, he never misses.  (Never mind Kapoor is supposed to be Hindu and Ejiofor is African; we'll just make up a silly back story where his father is Hindu but his mother is a Baptist.  We know we have to have black people in the movie; we even know we have to have a Hispanic or two.  We understand we have to have women in powerful roles.  But a South Asian actor in a major role?  Uh-uh.  We're not there yet.  In 2001, Chandra had to become Chandler; here Kapoor had to be a black guy.  How far we've come.  Not.)
I didn't think Jessica Chastain was right as Commander Lewis, either; too young, not crusty enough.  Id much rather have seen someone like Amelia Bullmore (Gill in Scott and Bailey).  Or Carrie Ann Moss, who has some age on her now.  Just saw her in Jessica Jones, and she'd have been perfect.

 Dont get me wrong, Chastains not right for the part, but she  did a great job being a decisive leader in the latter part of the movie, and swimming through the zero-gravity parts of the ship, I'll give you that, and in fairness, for most of the parts, it hardly matters who plays them; they don't get a chance to develop their characters anyway.  These great actors do as much as they can with the weak script; they're just overqualified, wastedand also, every time you turn around theres another familiar face, so its hard to keep suspending disbelief.

Speaking of playing safe, what is the problem with the F-word?  Watney says it a lot in the book, in numerous variations.  In the movie, he says it once in the beginning, and then it gets sort of bleeped out, paraphrased, somehow hinted at but not shown, through the rest of the film.
If he can say it once, and people can say (two even milder expletives that I couldn't quote for the review; had to rewrite it), why can't Watney say ""(f-word) you""?  Or when he says what the f-word is wrong with you, tell them I'm alive!  and Houston says ""watch your language, the whole world is reading everything you type we don't get to see what he says, which in the book is ""Look, a pair of boobs---> (.)(.)""
Evidently too risque for the movie.  What are they so afraid of?

Now, about the adaptation-ness of this adaptation.  As I mentioned, they follow the book very closely, use a lot of the dialog.  The whole book just won't fit in a movie, so they had to leave out some stuff, I understand that, but then they slavishly checked as many of the boxes as they possibly could, without setting them up, and usually pulling the punch line.
Some examples:
-When Sean Bean's character tells Jeff Daniels he's a (religously-based expletive) coward, and stalks out, first of all, the foundation hasn't been properly laid.  Also, btw, if you haven't read the book, you really don't know what Sean Bean's character even does for a living; you don't get that he's the one in charge of the crew, and thinks that he and they should be making the decisions that affect them, and you really don't get how much he's against not telling them when Watney is found alive.  So when we calls his boss a (religously-based expletive) liar, its not really motivated, not believable but then, where they really blow it, is in the book, the big boss guy turns to the PR  lady, Annie, and tries to apologize for the Sean Bean character, but she cuts him off, saying I was hoping hed kick your ass.  You ARE a coward.  (I hope its OK to say ass in the review). That nails it down, but its omitted from the movie.  (Why??) So the skin and bones of that scene are there, but the vital organs are all cut out of it.  I know the film is too long as it is, but a few extra lines of dialog would have made that scene work, and it would have been great.

-Same thing with the scene where the Chinese leaders decide to lend the Americans their booster.  They say no one would know we could have helped, but I don't think you really get the point of that if you haven't read the book.  You could have, with another few lines of dialog, but they're not there.  Then the head Chinese guy says it will have to be done scientist to scientist, but I don't think you can understand what thats about either.  What its about is that the Central Committee will never approve the deal, so well arrange it scientist to scientist and both governments will have to accept it.  (Sort of; its more complex than that, might not actually make sense if I poke at it too much, but something like that).

Another key point in that scene is that China helps the US to make themselves look good and score points on the US, and also their price is a Chinese astronaut on a forthcoming Mars mission.  At the very end of the movie, for about 1/6th of a second you see a Chinese astronaut, but if you even catch that, you don't know the reference.  btw, how do we even know  the Chinese-looking guy isn't from San Francisco?

-Similarly, on Watneys launch day, he eats a meal pack hes saved for the occasion, but you haven't been told that, you don't have time to read what it says on the pack, it means nothing to you if you even see it.  All these things, if they don't go past when you blink, you understand, if youve read the book, but not otherwise.

-Another scene thats totally wasted is where Mindy Park discovers that Watneys still alive.  I know, film already too long, blah blah.  But in the book its really dramatic; in the movie, its just like, Oh, there he is.  They checked the box, they put the scene in, used some of the dialog, but they just totally missed it.  Another airball where there could have been a really powerful scene.

-Throughout, the movie just fails to convey how inventive and resourceful Watney is; he just easily solves one problem after another, and theres no suspense.  Theres no sense of the desperation and fear and loneliness he feels, or what its like to live on potatoes for months.  Its almost like another day at the office.

-In the movie, the 3200 km odyssey to Schiaparelli appears to take a couple of days at most.  In the book, Watney is again out of communication, so he makes this trip in isolation and has scary adventures along the way, which he has to deal with by himself and Earth can only watch with bated breath.  So since, in the movie, hes still in communication, and the trip is uneventful and you get no sense of it being long and difficult, they have him grow a beard and ask to be called Captain Blondbeard so you can see that it took long enough that he could grow the beard, even though it doesnt feel like that.

Captain Beard??  Whats that about?  Well, in the book, theres one paragraph, or maybe two, where hes idly speculating that since Mars is international waters, and hes taking the rover for a ride without anyone giving him permission, that makes him a pirate.  (Actually, come to think of it, he already did that when he went to get Pathfinder).  This is a trivial joke that really has no business being in the movie, except I guess they wanted to tie it in with Captain Blondbeard.  But in the movie the logic doesnt work; hes not out of communication, so he DOES have permission!

-The last thing I want to complain about is two, no three,  unnecessary, trite, Hollywood things at the end.
In the book, Watney jokingly suggests he can fly by poking a hole in his glove and venting air, flying like Ironman.  In the movie, they have him actually do it, which is the only scientifically ridiculous thing in the film, that I know of.  As far as I know, there are none in the book.
They just couldn't stand it..

Commander Lewis, who has already assigned a crewman the job of catching Watney and bringing him in, at the last second insists on doing it herself.  Does that really sound like what a mission commander would do?  Or would she let the designated, specially trained EVA specialist do it? Just has to be melodramatic and schmaltzy because its Hollywood.

And finally, after the end of the movie, there is one more unnecessary scene where Watney is teaching at Starfleet Academy.  Not in the book, totally anticlimactic and unnecessary, just another piece of Hollywood schmaltz they couldn't resist.",1447977600,9,11068,4.4328875681030215

7516629,3,B017S3OP7A,"Rented the video for $3.99. I'd already bought the eBook at $2.99 so I was curious as to how the two differed. The movie, obviously, focuses more on visual effect than explanation since that's what movies do. I thought they did a great job here. The overall visual impression was survival mode in a backdrop of red dust desolation, day after day after day. This re enforced the daily grind that was essential to the plot. Those interested in more scientific explanations of what was happening will find that in the book. The movie is more about personal relationships. Again, that's what movies are good at.

A real treat for me was the music. It was all disco [Happy Days Theme Song, Turn the Beat Around, Hot Stuff, Rock the Boat, Dont Leave Me This Way, Starman, Waterloo, Love Train, I Will Survive], all recovered from the personal effects left behind by commander Lewis when the crew had to abandon the planet immediately due to a violent dust storm.

Unexplained in either the book or the movie was why Mark Watney, the guy who was left behind, didn't bring his own music since music was so important to him. He hated disco, or so he said, but he kept playing it and we're left with the impression that it helped get him thru the process. I wonder what the effect would have been if the survival music had been something like Grant Rogers&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Catskill-Mountain-Songmaker/dp/B00GN3HD80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Catskill Mountain Songmaker</a>&nbsp;or Arnold Keith Storm&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Take-the-News-to-Mother/dp/B00GKXBIRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Take the News to Mother</a>&nbsp;or Ed Trickett&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Telling-Takes-Me-Home/dp/B00DHU19XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Telling Takes Me Home</a>, or perhaps an individual song or two like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turning-Toward-the-Morning/dp/B00DI631M2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turning Toward the Morning</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Run-Come-See-Jerusalem/dp/B00DHGF414/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Run, Come See Jerusalem</a>: old time, stuff that I could sing unaccompanied, but probably not if I had only that to listen to it for 549 Sols.

The video creates a feel-good outcome with everyone working together to save one guy's life, but leaves you with the impression that the goal all along was the working together, not the outcome for any one person. So why only 3 stars? At this point in his life, Mr Weir, author of the book, is a very stable genius more interested in making a living than collecting stars and smiley faces.

This has the movie feel more real, as each threat becomes a threat to you, each laugh becomes a laugh for you, and each emotional moment is taking place within you as well. A problem with this film, however, is that it tended to drag on. As fun as it was to see the Protagonist's resourcefulness firsthand, it became almost a chore to watch him have to deal with each problem when it surfaced.

7516656,5,B017S3OP7A,"Good, believable hard science fiction! I thought the ending could have been better, but the story was entertaining.

 I  am a fan of the first half of the film because I live alone on a tiny fixed income, and I have had to solve problems to get by, with no ones help. Personnaly, I have had to care for my aging mother who lived on the other side of the country. Could you guess that Salt Lake City is about the same distance from my home in the DC suburbs, as it was from the HAB to the Scapperelli Creater on Mars?! (3200 km, or 1988 miles. Four days of solitatary driving. ) I'm no Watney, just a 70 plus VietNam Vet with a microscopic budget and a 'if he can do it, I can do it' attitude. So?
Back to the movie:  I have really got my money out of my purchase. I have watched it many,many times.
Matt Damon was the perfect Watney. His approach to problems with an optomism and sense of humor, dispite the possibility that death was looming was (and I truly hate this cliche: pitch-perfect.)I was with him all the way. In my opinion his was a Great performance.",1529452800,,1141,4.0176211453744495

The sounds, the cinematography, the actors, the story, Matt Damon is a perfect fit for this movie, and the supporting actors are truly amazing as well.

Science, teamwork, smart people solving difficult problems, all of that is celebrated, as was experience and scientific collegiality.  Esoteric concepts such as Hohmann transfer orbits were mentioned, but they didn't try to explain them.  I applaud their decisions on where to spend the viewer's attention.  I love the characters: strong but not pedantic.  Male and female, different ethnicities, all were represented as contributors and leaders.  I love the cast, every single one.  Love the movie!

7516737,5,B017S3OP7A,"The Martian makes an entertaining and funny flick out of the most fear-inducing and grim situation. Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) gets stranded on Mars in an abandoned mission, left behind by his crewmates as they assume him to be dead. Mark lives, however, and we follow his survival through limited supplies, wits, and tireless help from home. While inspiration is expected from a film like this, and it definitely has that, the comedy is played brilliantly. Marks light-hearted and self-assured attitude towards his dwindling food stash, isolation, and various complications that occur throughout the movie make for some humorous one-liners. None of it thankfully ever takes the gravity of the situation, yet it does make it all the more impactful when Mark finally breaks down. The characters were likable and sympathetic, not to mention perfectly cast. The effects wonderfully realistic, the faux Mars beautiful. And while the heart-warming aspect of this film is predictable, nothing feels better than the satisfaction of the ending.",1524787200,,1044,5.371951219512195

It's suppose to be a drama (if we are labeling)  but I have not had a good laugh like this movie gave me, in a very long time.
Matt Damon was excellent. It has been an absolute pleasure to watch him grow as an actor and he nailed the roll.
It's an all star cast, everyone was excellent!

Some people don't like watching movies especially after reading the book. The book and the movie will always be different. Put that aside and try watching The Martian. You are truly missing out if you don't.

When 90% of the reviewers give it 4 or 5 stars and you give it only 1, it says more about YOU than the movie!  Just like the product reviews, if everyone else thinks it's great and you think it sucks, you probably failed to follow the directions!

This is a great movie.  One of the rare ones that I can pull out and watch over and over.  Funny, intelligent, inspiring... all without any gratuitous violence... maybe that's why some didn't enjoy it?",1519344000,,566,4.394230769230769

7516830,4,B017S3OP7A,"I enjoyed the movie, and it was well-done.  In particular, I liked the ingenious thinking through which problems were solved.

But I found myself questioning the central theme of the storyline itself, which was based on circumstances arising from the loss of communication between Mars and Earth.  These days, most interested people would know that Mars has severe planet-wide dust storms that can last for days, and thus that missions to Mars, particularly human missions, should make sufficient allowances for likely eventualities.  In fact, system redundancy to take account of just such eventualities is the norm in space-related eneavours.  Thus providing only one meagre antenna to form the Earth-Mars communication system seems a bit too odd -- especially when everything else were well-designed and built.",1519084800,,813,5.472

7516836,5,B017S3OP7A,"I'm always a bit apprehensive watching a movie after loving the book.  I consider the book one of the most entertaining reads of my life.  Yet the movie did not disappoint.  I understand that to cram a book that is 11 hours long on Audible to a two hour and forty minute movie involves leaving some plot twists behind.  The screenwriters did this flawlessly.  I found myself saying ""Ok, I can understand why they did not include that story line.""  Also the book goes into much more detail of the calculations, engineering, and thoughts that the stranded Astronaut goes through to survive.  But that takes time the movie does not have.  I do think that reading the book helped me to love the movie!

How do I know I REALLY like this movie?  Because if I find it on one of our 14 HBO channels, and I have 10 minutes, I'll watch that 10 minutes no matter where it is in the movie.  There are very few movies I can do this with.  Similar recent movies in this vein: Moneyball and Hidden Figures.",1518739200,,991,4.355191256830601

7516919,5,B017S3OP7A,"Matt Damon does such an amazing job as Astronaut Mark Watney, in this movie that is not just about coming home; but also, about how one chooses to live their life. It is monumental in showing the challenges and major setbacks this Astronaut faces on Mars after mistakenly being left behind by his fellow crew members.

Watching him try to just grow food. Basic potatoes; in soil that is less than favorable; and after counting out his last rations, is a very real example of how it feels for starving people across our world. And the definitive cold answer to his question, does he have enough food to survive? NO.

All the while people at NASA are working furtively to figure out how to bring him home. This is an edge of your seat movie! Impossible to turn away from.

 There are heart sinking scenes. The opening scene where Watney has to perform surgery on himself is very hard to watch. When I thought there is no way this Astronaut can make it. When I saw all of the weight Matt Damon lost for this role, it just shows how hard he worked to become Mark Watney, Mars Astronaut.

And then his champion spirit, that sardonic wit when talking about his disdain for the only music available: Disco. The juxtaposition of the Disco music playing as he is out there on the edge of another planet; is brilliant.

I began to realize this movie is so much more than just a movie about an Astronaut. It is an allegory for those of us who actually live in isolation. On limited means. With very little contact with others. And I do it for my survival but I recognized parts of myself in many scenes. And how the mind has to begin to think differently. Most of all; we all have to learn how to solve a problem. And then another one. I am not so good at that.

I admire Matt Damon as an actor and a humanitarian so much. Good Will Hunting was literally like a break in the Clouds for me. Like a solitary note sent to my soul that said: you are not alone. And, it is not your fault.

This movie, The Martian is a work of art. For a time when our nation could use a lot more young people studying the fields of Botany, Chemistry and Applied Science; this movie is highly inspirational. It fosters learning and shows extraordinary teamwork and problem solving.

I hope so many people buy it and continue to support Matt Damon. He is a good kind human. A stellar bright soul. And he looks you in the eye and says, I am also with you. I just love him.

The visuals are stunning. This cast is so awesome, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kristen Wiig, Jessica Chastain. Such a timeless Classic with an enduring message.

Best of all, everyone can watch it. Which is far more than I can say for regular tv which has become flooded with garbage and violence. The Martian is exactly the opposite. Then again, I'm just a fan. Fanning out. And Gushing. It's what we do :)",1513987200,,2846,4.340866290018832

All the great features of the film (go back to the third sentence in this review if you've already forgotten) are dialed to 11 in the audiobook. The extra details, additional disasters and solutions, and the masterful narration are truly gripping.

There are the right moments of humor and a sense of urgency and suspense to get him home. As for the 3D aspect of it: the clarity and depth are excellent. I finally get it now. After watching post-converted 3D movies, I see the differences. Native 3D just comes across much more definitively and there aren't any gimmicky pop-outs. I watched the 3D Under the Sea IMAX film and that's all it does is give you pop-outs. That's not what I'm looking for when I'm watching 3D and if pop-outs are a favorite then that's fine. I know that this argument goes beyond the scope of the product but if you're looking for a 3D movie that makes the case for why we love 3D movies then watch this movie. Also, I have to say that I was one of those people who hated 3D and rarely watched them before watching AVATAR.",1512777600,,944,4.308988764044944

The return craft can't come to me, it's a good thing there's a brand new launch vehicle just over there that no one is using."" Every astronaut and ground control technician looked a lot more Hollywood than NASA. Also, if the air is so thin on Mars that you can use a tarp as a nose cone during take-off, how was the storm in the beginning of the film strong enough to knock over a huge rocket?

7517030,3,B017S3OP7A,"As long as you go into this film knowing it's fiction, it's not too bad. Of course the plot has been done a hundred times before: human left behind on hostile planet for whatever reason seems good to the author, manages through his/her own ingenuity to stay alive until s/he can be rescued. If you've watched science fiction for the last 50 years--heck, if you watched the Apollo mission--you know the basic plot.

Matt Damon is good, as usual, and his riffs are funny.

 However, if you're going to ignore what we know about the atmosphere of Mars, and just make this look like a day on Earth--sunny, clear air with miles of (southwestern) red soil and rock, then you can't expect kudos. There's one freakin' wind storm at the beginning--necessary to the plot so the hero can be left behind--and then it's clear sailing all the way. Rather like Wall-ee: all the equipment is there, he just has to figure out how to use it. that part was okay, but, since the Martian soil is KNOWN to be too toxic to grow Earth crops--even in greenhouses--I just couldn't buy it. Oh, and he's there for another solar year and NOT ONE WIND STORM. I'm off to read the book; maybe it's more realistic. . .",1506297600,,1185,4.476851851851852

7517045,5,B017S3OP7A,"This is a movie I got lost in. The storyline is about a guy left behind on Mars by his crew who assumes he was dead. If I were that guy, I would be dead. This guy is a biologist of some type (?) and a pretty inventive and plausible character. If you are willing to accept the reality of someone being left behind on Mars, which I found enjoyable, then watching The Martian by Michael Pena, and staring Matt Damon can be an entertaining and a thought provoking time.

The movie brings up the practical issues of survival, most of which I would never have thought about. Then of course, there is a good dose of reality tossed in. Just about the time, when I am congratulating myself, because I am overly identifying with Matt Damon, the unexpected kicks in. There are issues relating to how long it takes for a rescue to be undertaken, how to survive, how to eat, and how to recover from the inevitable numerous disasters.

There is a novel twist on how our main character communicates with earth and the numerous tense moments that would probably cause most of us to give up. Matt Damon comes through strong in The Martian. It took me over a year to remind myself that I wanted to look it up using Amazon. I am glad I did and expect it will be well appreciated when we have guests, where someone asks ""Is there anything good to watch on Amazon?"".",1505433600,,1345,4.333333333333333

Ridley Scott shows the human side of the characters. Watneys (Matt Damon) fear and perseverance. The best and less then best of humanity (from heroism to covering ones own ass) is demonstrated by a fantastic cast that includes Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Mara, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pea, and Sean Bean.

I actually expected that the movie would OVERDO some of the situations and make it an unrealistic, non-stop action-fest that would be disappointing.  While I'm glad that wasn't the case (well, MOSTLY that wasn't the case--I was NOT AT ALL impressed with the ending, which was just total Hollywood cheese and did not match the rest of the film), it was very strange that the film left out many of the problems that had to be solved (which was the whole big point in that comment fin the final scene)--problems such as the loss of communication, the dust storm, and the ""accident"" near the end (trying not to give too many book spoilers here).  Because these challenges were left out, it felt like the full sense of Watney's unbelievable ingenuity was missing, and this ingenuity was the most amazing part of the book.  So, it was a weird combination of missing several opportunities for nail-biting, but BELIEVABLE action, and then throwing in some very cheesy, un-realistic thing at the end.  Bummed about that.

7517104,1,B017S3OP7A,"I can't fault the production and the special effects, which were well made, but all told this film was just staggeringly boring. I guess I can take only so much of an arrogant, profanity-spewing stranded astronaut growing poo potatoes while waiting for the inevitable pickup from his astronaut friends (who were all more than willing to spend an extra year in space for a futile rescue operation. The film gives you the tangible icky feeling of sitting in a pressurized airplane cabin while still in the comfort of your home! Matt Damon seems to radiate smell and desperation as he treks along with dusty Martian/Utah landscape, accomplishing one implausible thing after another. If I cared anything about nerdy science I might do some fact checking for this film, but I can't help but remain skeptical that a rocket can function properly with just a tarp wrapped over the top? There were plenty of other moments like this as well (includign duct tape to fix a broken helmet. Sure, whatever.)

Of course all of the astronauts are young and beautiful, and NASA's command is staffed with aging b-actors like the Dumb and Dumber guy, whatshername from SNL, and the Boramir guy (I will give the credit that they managed to work in a LOTR gag with him in the scene. I found myself saying ""One does not simply launch a rescue rocket"" whenever he would appear in a scene.)

The fault here might be editing. I was seriously bored through most of the film and waiting for things to pick up. Maybe an actual martian showing up might have spruced things up. This was directed by Ridley Scott, wasn't it?",1500940800,,1592,4.702508960573477

7517190,5,B017S3OP7A,"Have you read Andy Weir's terrific best-seller yet? The back story of his success is almost as good as his first full-length novel. Look it up! A few memorable situations had to be eliminated, or this 2-hour, 20-minute survival story would run for over six hours! I did object to the last exciting action sequence: They needlessly changed the players simply because of star billing. Grrr....

NASA astronaut/flight surgeon Michael Reed Barrett happily introduced this exciting Sci-Fi adventure to our screening audience (it's his favorite movie). Director Ridley Scott (""Prometheus""), with a screenplay by Drew Goddard (""The Cabin in the Woods""), follows Weir's involving and humorous book into space. We open with a NASA exploration team on the red planet, where a freak storm violently interrupts their mission and our story begins.

The cast:
  * Matt Damon (""Beyond the Candelabra"") Mark Watney is left for dead as the crew wisely scrambles to evacuate while their ship can still fly. Faced with starvation, this resourceful survivor becomes ""the greatest botanist on this planet!"" (See the trailer.)
  * Jessica Chastain (""Zero Dark Thirty"") Melissa Lewis is captain of the crew that unwittingly abandons our hero; her responsibility is to get her team safely back to Earth.
  * Mackenzie Davis (""That Awkward Moment"") Mindy Park's job is surveillance. She is the solitary observer who monitors the mission from a quiet NASA desk. She spots some unexplained activity. Once it is ascertained that Watney is alive, time and distance are the biggest challenges for NASA. How do we get back there to rescue him before he dies? And how do we tell him we're coming?
  * Jeff Daniels (""The Newsroom"") Sanders is the head of NASA; short of a mutiny, anything else that happens is on his watch.
  * Kristen Wiig (""The Skeleton Twins"") Annie Montrose's job is Public Relations. How do you tell the world that an astronaut has been left behind on Mars to starve?
  * Chewitel Ejiofor (""12 Years a Slave"") Venkat Kapoor is the vital link between the face of NASA and the media world. Through him, we witness the bureaucratic scramble that takes place behind the scenes.
  * Donald Glover (""Magic Mike XXL"") Rich Purnell seems to have Asperger's, which makes this high-functioning fellow the perfect person to offer an outside-the-box solution for this white-knuckle dilemma.
  Michael Pe&ntilde;a (""Ant-Man"") Likable mission pilot Rick Martinez is Watney's best buddy. It's just plain fun to hear their chatter.*
This is PG-13, so expect a smattering of profanity, a bit of nudity, and an entire crew of Macgyvers (one astronaut has to build a bomb from their food supply). And you'll never look at duct tape the same way again.

The most outstanding element of this film (AND the book!) is the humor: Watney has a wry sense of himself and his situation that we come to share. He also has a resilience and a persistence that any would-be adventurer would be wise to note; he even comes to appreciate disco music (some tapes had been abandoned by the crew).

You can $kip the 3D, the $tory is the thing! I heartily recommend this one (and the book).",1496016000,2,3141,4.935361216730038

It just wasn't that good.. I think maybe people got impressed by the science, or big words. But for me, it just wasn't good enough. The story was boring. Maybe because I didn't like the main character. He just seemed way too positive, and no depth... it just fell flat for me, but so did Gravity. Im not sure what people thought was so great about that movie either..actually these are very similar movies. Two characters, in very unlikely scenarios that have a couple , like one line-that are like bumper stickers. I mean, I have friends that say better things drinking coffee. I guess it just didn't give me anything I haven't seen before or heard before. And plus, no real depth... just a very mediocre movie. But with a happy ending and a very one dimensional hero.

7517324,4,B017S3OP7A,"A big-studio ""space"" movie with Matt Damon? What's not to love? Well, after several viewings there are certain aspects of this movie that prevent me, for one, from considering it a five-star space classic. I wonder if any of the other reviewers here feel the same. First of all, in my humble opinion, the script could've used a rewrite. The astronaut's banter sounds very Hollywood - a mix of cliche tech speak lifted almost verbatim from past space flicks like Apollo 13 with some flip chatter that doesn't sound at all legit coming from a NASA crew - ""In your face, Neil Armstrong""? I don't think so. Then there's the implausibility of the plot - a trained crew flees Mars, abandoning Matt Damon without bothering to walk 50 feet to make certain that he's dead or retrieving his body, then when almost back to Earth, they decide to turn around and pick him up. From what I understand, no NASA crew would ever mutiny or vary so much from a mission profile, even if the extra risk and months in space were possibilities. The '70s disco soundtrack also seems overly cute and inappropriate. Still, you can't really go below four stars as the effects are convincing enough and the acting, mostly that of Matt Damon, make the fictitious world of this Mars journey a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.",1488931200,,1317,4.608510638297872

7517365,5,B017S3OP7A,"This movie comes about as close to accurate as it can (according to various interviews on the subject), while taking some liberties with some facts in order to create the narrative. Then again, people need to remember it's about entertainment; it's not a biopic!

That being said, The Martian is fun and entertaining, and yes, even inspirational. Those who feel they ""aren't into science fiction"" need to realize that ultimately, this movie (and its original book) are a story about (hu)man's desire to live, when it seems like it will be impossible for him to survive even a fraction of the film. Damon handles the heavy lifting of the title character (Mark Watney) with a deft comedic touch that makes one appreciate just how mentally prepared astronauts have to be in order to potentially handle this kind of crazy, horrifying stream of events and its consequences.

Of course, certain circumstances have to play out perfectly (if he wasn't a botanist, would he have figured out how to potentially survive?), while other bad things seem inevitable in order to throw more obstacles into his path. But even non-sci-fi fans will find the storyline engrossing and will be cheering along for his survival.

7517398,5,B017S3OP7A,I coming at my review from that if you are considering The Extended Edition than you are already a fan of the original movie. The extended version of The Martian brings a little more story to this otherwise great movie letting you delve a little bit more into the movie's universe. Having read the book I got more out of the scenes that the extended edition put back in knowing where they came from or were inspired by.  If you enjoyed the theatrical version of the movie I think you will truly enjoy the extended edition!,1486598400,,522,4.4375

7517410,5,B017S3OP7A,"Let me start, I have never read the book. Like many people who read a book before a movie, one may have some kind of expectation. Thankfully I did not. Who ever pick Matt Damon for this movie, made a great choice. I could not see any other actor playing the part. The story was very well written out. I enjoy movies like Cast away and The Phoenixes. The scenes well colorful, I enjoy the land scenes of what Mars may look like. The idea of space travel and how long it takes to travel. Of course, the idea of being the only man in the planet with limited resources and the instinct of how to survive. Many people can take something from watching this movie weather you like the story or not. The key to life one might say is: (watch the movie and come with your own answer.)",1486425600,,774,4.166666666666667

7517477,5,B017S3OP7A,"I watched The Martian on the Amazon Video streaming service with zero problems and great quality.

The Martian is one of Matt Damon's best movies. It is that rare movie where I continue to enjoy after seeing it over and over again. If you like science fiction movies at all, see it.

The basic premise of the movie is Astronaut Mark Watney, believed dead in an accident,  is left behind on Mars when his crew leaves during an emergency. He survives and then begins trying to figure out how to survive out of touch with earth or his crew in space. Meanwhile on earth ground control discovers he is still alive and tried for figure out whether to save him and how that might be done.

The story arc is expertly done with great cast, acting, writing, special effects and music, The Martian is a movie where (for me) everything comes together perfectly.

I did NOT read the book before seeing the movie and I recommend seeing the movie first. It took me years to accept that the no movie made from a book can match the nuance and detail of a good book. I used to read the book first but  eventually learned to read the book after the movie. I just accept how the book is different better than the movie better in that order.

In conclusion, this is one excellent movie. If you read the book first it may not live up to the book. See the movie, then read the book. I have enjoyed many viewings and that makes a 5 star movie experience for me.",1485648000,,1437,4.3

Too many critics looked for issues to take exception to with this movie.

For a drama he brings a lot of humor to his predicament, however, I would label it a dramatic comedy or fun/funny drama. I don't understan why critics and the movie industry labeled it as a comedy. The bottom line? Matt Damon gave an oscar winning performance without winning the oscar. He proves that he is one of the best actors of our time.",1485043200,,478,4.206521739130435

7517554,4,B017S3OP7A,"So I just saw the movie after reading the book. The movie's good, but there's a few things that don't work:
1. The size of the base on Mars, ""The HAB,"" and the sheer amount of stuff there makes it look like they sent a container ship to Mars. In an era where they're using conventional rockets to send this stuff, it's clearly impossible. The Rovers are way too big, the size of tanks. In the book, they're more like dune buggys. The HAB looks like a luxury suite in a Dubai six-star hotel, not a big tent with six hammocks. And a 36"" computer monitor? I suppose they had a hot tub, too.
2. When he's outside, you can see his face through the helmet faceplate. Sometimes the sun is shining on it. No, no, no, that's UV burns, if not blindness. Remember how thin the Martian atmosphere is.
3. With all that dust swirling around, I just don't get the sense that he's on a planet with a very thin atmosphere. And his EVA suit doesn't look warm enough for Mars.
4. Commander Lewis seems mis-cast. Someone with more charisma needed to play that role. She comes across as an uptight corporate exec, not a military commander of a space mission.
5. The heroics at the end, departing from the book, are just too much.

Now for the good stuff. I thought Matt Damon got the part just right. The other crew members were good. So were all the earthbound characters. The outdoor shots showed the beauty of Mars--if indeed it is beautiful--much more than the book. I don't know if the dust devils are real, but they were aesthetic. Altogether, a good show.",1484784000,,1541,4.388111888111888
7517555,5,B017S3OP7A,"Being a enthusiastic fan of ""The Martian"" written by Andy Weir, I was hesitant to watch this movie. While the movie does not completely represent every single juicy bit of scientific detail that the novel has, it does get enough in there that it is not another Hollywood cash grab.

The Martian is about Mark Whatney, an astronaut who is left on Mars, when his crew evacuates during a catastrophic dust storm. The stranded Whatney confronts the many problems that stand in his way of survival on the red planet.  The Martian is not a movie to glass over details, while the book details every nail biting moment, the movie throws a fair amount in too. Matt Damon gives you a character that you care about.

I own about 30 3D movies now, and this one is at the top of that list. A beautiful movie, if you like 3d and space, then you need this movie.",1484784000,5,847,4.382165605095541
7517556,5,B017S3OP7A,"Matthew Damon as always is an excellent actor.

All this without CGI fight scenes, murders, crime, car chases, etc.  With the success of Hidden Figures (about mathematicians working for Nasa in the early 60""s) I hope Hollywood takes note and realizes that science stories make for compelling cinema.  With the dumbing down of America, we need movies like this to show our kids the enormous good that science and technology has brought us and hopefully encourage them to take full advantage of their educational opportunities.  As a former middle school science teacher, I suggest this film be used by teachers as the basis for lesson plans for any number of skills sets that students need to attain proficiency in science and math.  The mathematics of orbits, basic agronomy and botany, chemistry, the electro-magnetic spectrum, gravity, etc. could all be examined in an entertaining way using this film as the anchor.",1484784000,3,1102,5.032967032967033

It also features cast members who I definitely want to see more of Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Benedict Wong, Donald Glover and Mackenzie Davis. Kristen Wiig was a bizarre and disconcerting casting choice. I've liked her very much in other movies but not at all in this. Jessica Chastain was ok but IMO, I find her unremarkable in everything I've seen her in.

There is very little need to suspend disbelief to enjoy this movie, though at times the string of creative scientific solutions needed to keep the character alive while he waits for rescue seem on the edge of incredible. I have watched this movie several times and it does not fail to entertain each time I watch it.

7517710,3,B017S3OP7A,"In this astronaut disaster adventure, Matt Damon is mostly charming and occasionally inspiring as a scientifically sophisticated MacGyver. The rest of the characters are too cookie-cutter to evoke much emotional response. The soundtrack and other elements transparently pander to boomers thirsty for a fresh taste of America's true-grit, man-on-the-moon halcyon days.

This is ""Hard SF"" only in the limited sense that it valorizes scientific problem solving, as long as those problems remain purely technical. Any broader application must be inferred. One gets the sense that drawing such inferences is no problem for the target audience. It is simply assumed that to cheer for the science of space flight et al. is to embrace a scientific approach to life in general - one of the great mythologies of the boomer era. No substantive questions are raised regarding the audience's cultural status quo, such as its blind faith in technocracy. The film concerns itself with the ramifications of change in only the narrowest sense - the logistics of rescuing someone marooned on Mars. Thus, it can hardly be classified as science fiction.

Most viewers won't be too concerned about any of that, though. If you're just looking for a good time - and especially if you're a nostalgic, left-leaning boomer looking to be both affirmed and entertained - The Martian is unlikely to disappoint.",1483401600,,1381,5.216216216216216
7517711,5,B017S3OP7A,"A celebration of the innate courage of clear-eyed scientists and problem-solvers. Matt Damon is convincingly scared, angry, ironic, funny, and determined as the only human ever to occupy a planet alone, and the astronauts, scientists, technicians, and politicians who help retrieve him to Earth are quite believable as well. As our country embarks on witch hunts against climate scientists and anyone trying to base policy on their findings or those of other environmental researchers, this movie is quite topical. Like ""Apollo 13,"" it reminds us of what our country can achieve when we pursue truth, invest in ground-breaking exploration, and educate people to be real problem solvers, rather than relying on propaganda, fake news, and pseudo-religious dogma in the public sphere.",1483401600,,781,5.462809917355372

7517736,5,B017S3OP7A,"I have watched this movie so many times already that I am repeating the script as the movie plays. The scenario of a manned mission to Mars makes some assumptions that the US has already produced the hardware to make manned Mars missions, and as the drama unfolds, that hardware becomes survival critical. One of the six astronauts is struck by debris during a violent Mars sandstorm that forces an emergency mission abort leaving the one astronaut behind, presumed dead. Matt Damon plays Mark Watney, the astronaut left behind, and I thought Damon's portrayal was definitely worthy of an Academy Award. As the story unfolds, memorial services are held on Earth as the surviving crew are on their way back to Earth from Mars while Watney begins to work through the challenges of staying alive long enough to await the next manned mission, some four years in the future. Damon portrays the determination of Watney to survive incredibly well, starting with his self treatment of his injuries from the flying debris. From then on, despite the overwhelmingly impossible odds against him, he starts working the problem and finding solutions to keep himself alive. Eventually, the NASA people on earth discover that Watney is still alive on Mars, initiating a huge effort to find ways to rescue him. Left to his own resources, Watney defies the odds time and again using his training and knowledge to the maximum.
Rarely have I seen a movie that has grasped my attention like this one. Sure, there are some implausible conclusions, but hey, this is a movie. What makes the story so compelling is the way the story moves along to its conclusion. From the credits following the movie, it is apparent this was a big budget international effort, and it was done flawlessly in my opinion. There is no better movie than this for pure entertainment.",1483228800,,1836,4.8690095846645365

7517882,3,B017S3OP7A,"Worth a watch, but the action and drama are so manufactured the plot is ultimately predictable. Of course, what did I expect with a big-budget sci-fi blockbuster? What separates a great space epic like Sunshine from The Martian is chemistry between the characters. In the Martian, we are supposed to believe Matt Damon is so tightly bound to his crew that they would sacrifice their own lives to save his and vice-versa. However, the rapport between the crew and main character is never established. When the characters on screen don't connect, it's hard to expect an audience to connect with the characters. I rounded up to three, but this is a 2.5 star movie.",1481846400,2,661,4.807017543859649

It is entertaining at best, but life on Mars would be much more life threatening.  Every second Mars would be trying to kill you.  The weather alone would most likely kill you if you lived above ground for any long period of time.  Out of many things that would kill you, just think about the high doses of radiation you would get just from living on the surface.  Water reclaimers do NOT last forever even if they operated forever.  Also, it must be nice living in a Hilton Hotel on Mars.  Living quarters would not be nearly as luxurious and comfortable and spacious.  Anyhow, like I said, it is entertaining at best, but not realistic.",1480550400,2,765,4.4071428571428575

The main character's solutions to the various problems and setbacks posed by the Red Planet's harsh environment were a nice counterpoint to NASA Ground Control's effort to retrieve the marooned astronaut. These elements, combined with NASA's political and public relations hassles made for a very realistic and engaging plot line. Character development was relatively strong where it needed to be. Nice action-packed plot resolution, too. This film is a fine example of speculative science fiction, a relatively under represented genre in recent years.",1480550400,,618,5.655913978494624

7518057,5,B017S3OP7A,"This is of the few times a movie lived up to the lofty standards set by the book.  My only complaint?  A bit too much 70's music.  Yeah, we heard about how the protagonist griped about the music, but why use that as an excuse to bombard the audience with so much of it as well.  At least when I was reading about it, I didn't also have to listen to it.  And yeah, it's a minor nit, but otherwise I'd have nothing to complain about.

Naturally, there were a few missing scenes that I wish we could have seen, but this is not unexpected due to the movie's time constraints.  I felt they kept the most germane scenes intact and presented them well.

Overall, highly, highly recommended for almost anyone.  And I think anyone will appreciate it, even if you don't necessarily care about all the ""sciency"" stuff, because the focus on the show is really about human courage, tenacity, and ingenuity in the face of overwhelming adversity.

Oh, and if you actually *love* 70's music, you're in for a treat.",1479945600,21,998,4.434065934065934

7518095,5,B017S3OP7A,"The Martian, in my opinion, is nothing less than brilliant. This is a thinking person's sci-fi flick - a story built on smarts instead of fast-action violence. Matt Damon is totally in the lead in this film - an astronaut left behind on a Mars mission. Now he has to find a way to survive until the next Mars mission arrives (due to land in four years). Damon's portrayal is authentic,not over dramatized, not marginalized. His actions and behavior are what I might expect from a trained astronaut, a professional botanist, a human being trying to survive. That makes his performance moving, witty, gritty,and gracious. Other performances in this film were very good, but Damon definitely takes center stage, and should. The screenplay keeps the audience engaged, entertained, trying  right alongside astronaut Mark Watney, the crew that left him behind, and NASA's effort to find a way to rescue him while keeping out of a negative public relations tangle that could endanger further funding for the space program. The film score is unobtrusive until just the right moment. This is a great film for everyone, not just sci-fi buffs.",1479081600,,1132,4.98941798941799

He gets depressed, deals with self doubt and hopelessness at times. But he constantly picks himself back up and fights. Sometimes I feel like I got served a raw deal in life. But I draw encouragement and inspiration from tales like this. Where not giving up will eventually allow you to win in the end.

7518159,4,B017S3OP7A,"Id heard lots of good things about The Martian after its release and then during awards season it won in some comedy category and I was like, Whu? That doesnt seem right. Isnt it a sci-fi survival story? Thoughts of Gravity swirled in my head but there was more buzz and talk about this movie that was, like, a comedy in a way. This more than anything intrigued me though my wife was had at the starring Matt Damon moment. So we watched Matt The Martian Damon survive, unaided by his cosmonaut compatriots who had left him thinking him dead, and survive he did using SCIENCE! And his wits, and acumen, and an attitude of dauntless humor. So it was a Robinson Crusoe survival story after all that conveyed a sense of adventure and humor in that the whole being alone and going to die soon thing never got him down; it never really got anyone down and everyone worked hard with a thats the spirit! attitude that never gave up, even in the face of worry and incalculable odds. His fellow Mars explorers learned of his being alive and unanimously chose to go back for him while NASA honchos and personnel scrambled in political and mathematical circles to help figure out how to bring him home and spin the story as a good ol US of A nationalistic tall tale. Damon, ever the likable modest superman who comes across more like an everyman, sells us on himself in every scene and we never feel alone. BTW, this movie is way better than Gravity. 4.5 stars.",1477785600,,1449,4.451127819548872

7518221,5,B017S3OP7A,"Matt Damon's Everyman quality and wry sense of humor makes him the perfect actor to portray Mark Watney, astronaut, in Ridley Scott's ""The Martian,"" written by Drew Goddard, based on the book by Andy Weir. When a violent storm forces the Hermes crew, led by Commander Melissa Lewis (a steely Jessica Chastain), to abort the Ares III mission to Mars, the crew reluctantly leaves without Mark Watney, who was injured and presumed dead. Somehow, Watney survives, and starts keeping a log of his experiences on the Red Planet. He is a realist. It could take years for a rescue team to retrieve him, so he gets down to business: rationing and growing food, making water, repairing damaged equipment, and establishing communication with Mission Control.

In 3-D, the views are spectacular, with flying debris coming at us from various directions; the desolate yet strangely beautiful Martian terrain stretching out to infinity; the Hermes astronauts floating from one pod to another; and the thrilling, acrobatic finale. ""The Martin,"" is not deep, nuanced, or subtle, but it is a certified crowd pleaser. Matt Damon shines as a genius who, in spite of daunting challenges and discouraging setbacks, dusts himself off and comes up with solutions, including multiple uses for duct tape. Watney makes jokes about outdated Disco music, boasts about his skills as a botanist, and makes comments laced with profanity while communicating with earth.

The supporting actors include Jeff Daniels as NASA Director Teddy Sanders, who must make tough decisions that factor in not just the human element, but also his agency's image, political standing, and fiscal constraints. Would Americans ever abandon one of their own? At a time when some nations have lost respect for the United States, this film boosts morale with its can-do spirit. Would it be churlish to point out that, for all its wizardry, special effects, and visual spectacle, ""The Martian"" has formulaic and clichd elements? Still, for a little over two hours, we sit back, take in the sights, and imagine what it would be like to be stranded on a faraway planet, trying to remain optimistic, and using our scientific know-how, guts, and resourcefulness to stay alive until (we hope) help arrives.

Much easier to follow than the other big space flick of the year Interstellar.",1476748800,,2325,5.097112860892389

SPOILERS

One. The use of Bowie's Starman, and Abba's Waterloo. This wasn't that kind of a movie. It was a suspense movie. They had no place being there.

And that points to a problem throughout the film-- it was as if Ridley Scott, of all people, didn't know exactly what kind of film he had, how to play up certain elements. The crowd scenes in the world capitals at the end, the rescue imminent. Then the cheering. It was as if he wasn't sure they should even be in the film, so he figured, I'll just put them in a little, when more or nothing was called for. The international rescue angle, too: same problem -- in or out, Ridley?.",1475193600,,687,4.310077519379845

The film felt like it was produced for a very young audience.  What struck me right away to be not so realistic was how young the astronauts were and how beautiful..and young the females were -  I don't remember real life to be so - the commander girl did not exactly look experienced enough..oh well, it's the movies.

I was interested in seeing the equipment and experiments, etc. that the author described in the book. The base camp was a whole lot bigger than I imagined but most other things were pretty much on target.  I was a little let down that everything was not covered in the movie, but then I guess it would have been in a couple of volumes instead of one DVD.

Instead it is a very realistic adventure movie that emphasizes that man can succeed and survive with knowledge, ingenuity and a never quit attitude, even if he is stranded for years as the sole human on Mars. This movie could have convinced me that it represents a true event. It is largely a one man show by Matt Damon who is excellent in the film.  I have watched it several times and have come to the conclusion that this is very feasible as presented. As an engineer, I can say that this meets my expectations as a very realistic scenario.  The scenes really do look like the event was filmed on Mars.  My hat is off to director Ridley Scott and Matt Damon who made this seem all so real!",1473724800,,721,4.279411764705882

Several times, though, I got the impression that the editors or writers or even Ridley Scott let some important details slip. Some were done to move the plot along (like the improbability of a storm strong enough to blow structures over in an atmosphere that's pretty close to a vacuum), and some just seemed sloppy (like hanging a naked plutonium core next to his head to keep warm). I would have changed the tagline, ""I'm going to have to science the s*** out of this,"" to ""I'm going to have to duct-tape the s*** out of this.""

I have watched the Bluray like 7 times, and at least that on cable. If it is on, I HAVE to watch it again. First the cast. Amazing casting. Matt Damon is the best. Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Chastain, et al perfect acting. The cinematography, the cg, and costuming is amazing. I FELT like I was on Mars, and space. The poignant use of 1970's music to create `atmosphere' is perfect. The angst, the emotion, the soundtrack...even Damon's scraggly DeCaprio-esque beard....are all...well...perfect. This is without a doubt, one of my fave movies, and will always be so. Evn when I know what will happen (after so many viewings, I am still on the edge of my seat every time. If I could give a ten out of five, I would.",1471824000,,836,4.470588235294118

7518675,5,B017S3OP7A,"The Martian, based on the novel of the same name written by author Andy Weir, is an eventful movie that serves both as an epic sci-fi adventure, but also provides viewers with some smart laughs. Those are who not that interested in sci-fi will probably end up liking the movie, because it is not unrealistic. Acting wise, Matt Damon puts in an excellent performance as the lead, and supporting actors such as Jessica Chastain, also put in solid performances. Probably one of the best aspects of the film, is that the mood of the movie is quite optimistic, considering that the situation of being stuck on mars, is quite a scary one, that requires a lot of panic.

Perhaps the hype about it exceeded the reality for me and though Damon was marooned on Mars, his solo performance was not in the same league as when Tom Hanks was stranded on the island in Cast Away. It seemed like it could have been much more than it ended up being and that's mostly why I was left wanting for something more.

Being the lone character in most of a movie is extremely difficult to pull off successfully. It just wasn't all that I was hoping for, but many others have loved it so it seems to boil down to that age old controversy of which is better, vanilla or chocolate.",1470700800,,687,4.244274809160306

7518835,5,B017S3OP7A,"I just watched the DVD for the first time, after reading the book. (IMHO that's generally the best order for these things.) I really like them both.

BTW I have no sympathy for the complaint of the reviewer who found it ""dull and dry."" Some interesting items in the book were indeed left out; there's just no way to fit it all into a movie--and the plot doesn't lend itself to a miniseries treatment, as some stories do. But name me one essential plot element that got left out, not a detail.

All that notwithstanding, I did cringe at certain things. Actually, the one thing that keeps getting cited as unrealistic--the lack of capability for a 10 mbar atmosphere to do any real damage, even with a 200-kph wind--to me is no big deal. Just imagine it's a volcanic eruption, or maybe a meteor impact. Problem solved. But there were multiple times with large groups of people breaking out in cheers and the like, and that seemed quite silly. 30 seconds after liftoff is no time to be popping champagne corks; it's when you should be wiping sweat! And then there was a time or two with dialogue explaining a situation that you know the participants would have to already know thoroughly, no words needing to be spoken at that time.

There was one part I would have loved to see pushed into the movie, and that where it was decided that if things went too badly wrong, and the supply ship did not get to the crew, the plan was for everyone to take suicide pills and for Johannsen, being the youngest and smallest, to survive by cannabilizing the other crew members. That might have been the hardest thing to handle on screen (and BTW it was only a minor aside in the book), but if handled right it could've been quite memorable, perhaps with the aid of a little projectile vomiting.

I was pleased that the book and movie used metric units; maybe that's partly from lessons learned from the 1999 mission failure that was blamed on confusion between English and metric.

Thank goodness for selectable subtitles on DVDs. It's often the case in modern movies that the dialogue is not that clear; it lends authenticity to the acting, but it really helps to have text to help out. That, and multiple languages, are a big aid, and I care enough about this movie to make use of both of those features.",1469923200,,2291,4.524154589371981

7518860,1,B017S3OP7A,"I'm going to assume the five star reviews are from people who didn't read the book, because a lot of the funniest parts were missing. This was poorly done as a movie and a lot of skipped important bits. I'm glad I read the book first because otherwise this movie would have left me with so many questions and much confusion. The MAV for Ares 4 was thousands of miles away and they just filmed it as a little driving montage and he had constant contact with Nasa the whole time. If you liked this movie at all read the book, the hadships this guy had let me believe he was going to die, but the movie gives you that happy ending feeling from the beginning. I also don't know why they cut off the significance of his team to him and kept everything focused on Captain Lewis. Just so strange. Matt Damon did his best with the script though and I found him a good choice for Marks character, as well as Michael Pena as Martinez, but the other crew almost seemed to be there as filler and hardly memorable in the movie.
I know the books are always better and book nerds always whine about it ;P but this is one that was done really badly in my opinion.",1469577600,7,1147,4.1945701357466065

And of course, a great supporting cast helps with the participation of Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kristen Wigg, Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, etc.  Also the 3D is great but even without it, this film still holds our attention.

7518973,3,B017S3OP7A,"I liked the movie but, I'm the type of person that seeks authenticity of a possible theory or scenario. There were a few things that didn't make sense in the movie. One of them is the gravity on Mars would of been a lot less than here on earth given the very thin atmosphere so the normal walking around and driving plus the sounds heard were not realistic because it would of actually been slower movements and very little sound. Another thing that bothered me were the sand storms which seemed more like the type on Jupiter not on Mars. On mars because the atmosphere is so thin the sand storms would not be strong at all. The worst part was lifting off into space from Mars and not having a shield over the capsule being ejected into space and just a tarp. In reality this would have broke multiple bones and the entire rib cage of a human because the pressure is that intense. Because it wasn't realistic enough I gave three stars. Most science fiction movies out there have realistic theoretical plots that support evidence and possibility. This one did not have enough evidence to support it.",1468800000,,1098,4.522613065326633

7518979,5,B017S3OP7A,"Please understand...I am not rating what I think of the MOVIE, because that is strictly subjective. Frankly, you could care less about if I liked the movie or not, at least I hope that is the case. What I am rating here is the QUALITY of the movie in 4K. You must have a 4K Blu-Ray player to play the 4K version of this movie, which is why I paid the extra cash for the disc. (Someday, I'm sure they will all drop in price when something else takes the place of 4K, at least I hope so!) do not be confused, my player does upscale non-4K discs to ""near"" 4K quality, but it also plays 4K discs. If you have a regular Blu-Ray player, it will not play this disc, so save yourself the cash and buy a Blu-Ray version. Anyway, I digress. The 4K quality of this movie played on my Samsung UBD-K8500 Ultra HD player is phenomenal. I own a Samsung Ulta HD TV model KS8000 TV, and the resolution is spectacular. You can see even the minutest fragment of details in scenes of intergalactic battles, down to the strands of hair on the character's heads. It is as if you are living the scene, not merely watching it passively. The experience is well worth the money you will pay for the 4K version of his film. In my opinion, it beat the resolution that I saw it in at my local theater, and to be honest, I doubt my local theater has 4K resolution, but my experience has been that theaters make up for picture quality by boosting the sound extremely loudly instead in order to try to make you immerse yourself in the action. I can honestly say that this 4K movie played in its highest definition will immerse you without a doubt! Happy viewing!",1468713600,2,1630,4.2612903225806456

7519150,5,B017S3OP7A,"The biggest surprise about this movie is its understatement. Ridley Scott is the man who gave us Alien; Matt Damon is the man who created Jason Bourne in the eponymous movie series. Instead of gore and frantic action. Scott gives us a traditional and balanced story about a man marooned on Mars in which he celebrates Damon's heroism and the heroism of the folks back home at NASA.

Much of the movie features Damon alone on Mars, but the combination of Damon and Drew Goddard's script keeps it from getting boring. At Mission Control on planet Earth, Jeff Daniels and a talented group of actors wrestle with politics and money alongside a genuine desire to bring this man home.

The movie features no grandiose acting, no big speeches about anything good or bad. Scott's view of heroism in this movie is an old one. All of these characters have a job to do and they do it to their utmost because they know everyone else is relying on them.

Despite the outer space theme, The Martian features few mind-boggling effects. There are SFX aplenty, but consistent with Scott's tone of understatement, the SFX are always secondary to acting and relationships.

On top of all that, the movie has a happy ending that won't make you puke. What's not to like?",1467331200,,1249,4.663636363636364

I had the same thought as I did when I heard about the movie CASTAWAY.  How do you make an entertaining movie where one character is stranded alone for most of the movie?  Like Tom Hanks, Matt Damon pulled it off.  Great, entertaining, funny movie with a good cast. The story line does not lag or drag.  Good date night movie because the mister in your life will enjoy it too.",1467244800,,534,4.086538461538462

7519162,4,B017S3OP7A,The first astronauts on Mars are driven from their research by a massive storm. They flee the planet but leave Matt Damon behind. The film is then about his efforts to survive until  if help can come. There are a surprising number of actors in a film about one man in a sort of future day Robinson Caruso. This works though as the number of people needed to run a space program is pretty extensive. What is interesting is the common will to do the right thing. Its good to see people working together on something so complex. There are some surprises here. Damons story remains central though. Showing him sciencing the hell out of things to give him a chance to live. There are successes and failures. Altogether it is an inspiring (if pretty improbable) effort that keeps your attention.

They missed the vast majority of the science and the big events from the book, which were really what impressed me in the book. Completely gone in the movie.

Truth be told, it's an okay movie... We all know Hollywood doesn't do science very well anyway, so whatever. Both the book and the movie are worth it, but I can't stress enough to READ THE BOOK FIRST. It's a fantastically realistic story full of adventure and SCIENCE, but watching the movie is basically like watching the trailer for the book.

7519202,5,B017S3OP7A,"BOTTOM LINE: If you enjoy speculative science fiction, with an emphasis on the science aspect, then THE MARTIAN is strongly recommended. Yes, some things in the plot & script don't entirely work or completely satisfy, and there are nits to pick, but overall I found this to be an immensely entertaining science fiction film. If you can, watch it as a back-to-back double feature with Criterion's excellent Blu-ray release of 1964's ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS. I think you'll easily see and appreciate the similarities & differences that each film has to offer. 5 STARS

THE STORY: An accident during a fierce planetary storm on Mars leaves a member of the ARES 3 manned expedition stranded & left for dead, while the rest of the team evacuates the Red Planet and heads for home. The next morning, the wounded astronaut discovers he's been left behind ...but there's no time for grief, fear or self pity; he has far more immediate concerns. He has to self-administer emergency first aid for his life-threatening injuries, then fix the oxygen scrubbing system. While he's healing up he'll have to repair the damaged base station to make it habitable, then devise a method to contact Earth to let them know he's still alive, AND, most importantly, figure out a way to grow food on the lifeless planet to help supplement the meager rations that were left behind at the abandoned base camp. He'll have to work all these problems out - by himself - if he hopes to stay alive until a rescue mission can reach him... which could be a year or more away.

THOUGHTS: A lot of negative reviews badmouth the pseudoscience involved, and other errors both large & small. But they're missing the point. THE MARTIAN is NOT a filmed recreation of an actual Mars landing, it's merely a clever (if thinly-veiled) re-telling of the classic sci-fi movie ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS. Remember folks, THE MARTIAN is a science FICTION movie, nothing more. As such, it's an utterly captivating and thoroughly engrossing motion picture experience. An acting tour de force for Matt Damon, who spends the lion's share of the film's 2hr 20+minute runtime on his own. And while that could be the kiss of death, his plight is so personal & immediate that I couldn't wait to see what happened next. It's so engrossing watching him work things out that you forget it's basically a one-man play. From a technical standpoint, (as with most modern big budget effects-heavy films), the look is slick, real-feeling and in many cases absolutely stunning. The scenery, while all reds & oranges, is still eerily beautiful to behold. Y

THE BLU-RAY: A strong modern hi-def release, with solid, crisp picture and a clean level soundmix. No complaints whatsoever. Extras include two short (9min & 14min) pieces on the making of the film, a short fictitious news magazine show (17min) detailing the story behind the mission, three mock educational mini-films (about 1.5-3mins long) about the missions, a gag reel, production artwork & designs, and finally the film's theatrical trailer.",1466985600,,3033,4.931506849315069

7519209,5,B017S3OP7A,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's funny. It's a great adventure story. It's just an all around entertaining movie. I liked it FAR more than Gravity, which has a similar ""How to survive a space disaster"" them. The big difference is that Gravity goes out of it's way at the very beginning to tell the audience about some strict principles of physics then proceeds to spend the next 90 minutes breaking all of them (like sound not traveling in the vacuum of space).

The Martian doesn't make any such assertions. It plays fast and loose with some rules of physics, but it doesn't pontificate about those rules first. So it works as an entertaining movie that doesn't come across as being disjointed. I'm talking about things like purposely putting holes in your space suit while in the vacuum of space, and how despite that being a REALLY bad idea that would have immediate disastrous consequences in real life, it turns into an amazingly fun adventure scene. But The Martian also gets other small details right too like how astronauts wear a pretty fancy heating/cooling suit under a space suit, rather than just underwear. So they get enough details right to make it believable, thus allowing you to suspend disbelief a little easier when they do something that's more far fetched.

Donald Glover practically steals the entire movie, which is kind of surprising considering how relatively small his character is and how little screen time he gets. He plays this hyper scientist who literally sleeps in his office so he is closer to his research. He is focused only on the problem of rescuing Matt Damon. He doesn't care about things like who the head of NASA is or why he should be more polite to him.

I also couldn't get the idea out of my head that this entire movie just takes place in Matt Damon's mind. I kept thinking that he's really his character from Interstellar who was stranded on that ice planet on the other side of the worm hole with no real hope of survival, and now he's just imagining being rescued. (This was not intentional by the film makers....probably. But I found the idea amusing)

I enjoyed the way they showed the various different perspectives of people in the film. There was the ""Oh my god how am I going to survive"" perspective of Matt Damon on Mars. There was the ""Oh my god how did we leave our friend behind"" perspective of the other astronauts. There was ""How do I keep NASA from losing all its' funding over this"" perspective of Jeff Daniels (Head of NASA). There was the ""How do we spin this into positive PR"" perspective of Kristin Wiig (NASA PR director). Etc etc etc. I thought they did a good job of exploring the perspectives of different people like that. It made the story more robust.

The actin was very good overall. The writing was solid. If you like sci fi adventure stories this is well worth checking out.",1466985600,,2860,4.633136094674557

7519234,5,B017S3OP7A,"This movie does not parallel the book in it's entirety (for example, there is no mention of Whatney being a mechanical engineer as well as being a botanist) but the lack of parallels doesn't detract from the story or at all.  Even the use of the plastic and duct tape to seal the air lock breach is forgivable because of Damon's acting and the emotion incorporated into the scene.  The poetic license exercised in developing the movie produces a gripping screenplay and superb casting and direction produce a very good movie. I would recommend it to any science nerd, with the caveat, ""they could not spend major time in the movie repairing the hab, building ramps to get the Pathfinder loaded onto rover, and the ""enhanced equipment, hab size, etc. allow the story to work without creating major sections that are boring or that have to be explained, later.""",1466812800,,859,4.758389261744966

Yeah, they made a few mistakes but the movie was immensely fun to watch with some very memorable lines.  I saw it the first time in Bozeman, MT among some apparently unscientifically sophisticated and the audience reactions were mild but apparently entertained.

7519293,4,B017S3OP7A,"For a year and a half you are stranded on a foreign planet. There is a small fraction of the sunlight from Earth available, there is no water, no plants, and you are surrounded by nothing but dust- both on the ground and in the air. There are little resources you can make to survive, and the most tangible ones will only get you through thirty days. On top of that, you have limited access to NASA headquarters, who aren't even aware that you are still alive on the planet. Sounds captivating? Then you are in for a real treat in The Martian, the latest science-fiction thriller that inspires the world to progress humanity towards the stars.

This Ridley Scott instant classic concerns a botanist named Mark Watney (Matt Damon) who is left abandoned on Mars after assumed dead by his team of astronauts during a storm that forced them to abort their mission. He now has only a matter of days worth of food to keep himself alive on a planet where nothing grows, so he has to learn how to grow plants and create water through his own resources to survive over a total of more than 560 Sol (Mars days). Meanwhile, NASA, after months of assuming him dead, search for plans to get him home safe after uncovering his calls to earth.

First off, Damon (Good Will Hunting, Saving Private Ryan) gives an above exceptional performance as the stranded astronaut. He presents his terror of living all alone on a deserted planet, yet still expresses active willpower to do whatever is necessary to survive. He records his progress through a series of video diaries, and his direct tone of speaking to the monitor charges your desire to watch his journey step-by-step until the end.

The Martian may not be the most suspenseful nor the most dynamic of Ridley Scotts directorial efforts. It doesnt have the unsettling atmosphere of Alien, or the social commentary of Blade Runner, or the thoughtful concepts on life of Thelma & Louise, or the heart-pounding storytelling of Gladiator, but Scott does accomplish what he has always done best: keeping viewers of all tastes fully invested into the experiences urgency from the opening to the closing credits. Say for instance, near the end of the films second act, Mark accidentally cracks a rather large segment of his helmet. He then quickly tapes the glass of the helmet shut as his suit gradually says, 30% of oxygen remaining 20% of oxygen remaining 15% of oxygen remaining It leaves you leaning on edge wanting to see him get out of this seemingly doomed predicament.

The stakes of the story were at first reasonably high: Mark has little means of staying alive on a planet where nobody has lived before, and he has to bring the attention from NASA, which creates a whole different set of challenges. But the problem with the screenplays structure is that Mark did not have enough backstory. Okay, so he is stranded on Mars and needs to get home, but what does he need to get home for? Does he have a son whos dying of cancer? Is the NASA educational program going to collapse without him there? Is he the fulfilled prophecy who will volunteer as tribute to protect middle earth from a Vulcan Sith Lord named Voldemort? There needed to be something urgent pressing on him to get home.

What about NASAs subplot in getting Mark home? Well, it is really nothing to jump on your seat about, as somewhere midway through the films running time, the temptation to snooze off becomes slightly greater, as the supporting cast has as much personality as the dust of Mars itself. Any real urgency to get Mark home is significantly lost, since not enough screen time was spent on developing the other characters.

But thankfully, the way that the NASA terms are talked about, and the ways that Mark explains his methods of survival, are told in scientifically accurate language, but still in a way that is easy and fun to listen to, with appropriate doses of humor sprinkled throughout. That takes an acquired skill that many screenwriters sadly never find in their careers.

I can conceptually see The Martian inspiring many scientists and NASA executives in the next several years, setting our expectations for progress to the next frontier. So Ridley Scott, thanks a million for the inspirational push into a brilliant new tomorrow!

7519295,4,B017S3OP7A,"I gave the novel 3 stars.  Funny, but I had a feeling I'd enjoy the movie a little more. Very touching story - perhaps even inspirational.  Excellent acting.  Decent score.  In the novel, I felt like the characters were 2 dimensional.  Also the writing wasn't exactly vivid.  Parts of the novel were dull and downright boring.  The movie, by contrast, moved very quickly.  4.5 stars.",1466467200,,383,4.7846153846153845

7519337,4,B017S3OP7A,"In 2035, the six-person crew of the Ares III is on a month-long stay on the surface of Mars. Suddenly, a violent dust storm starts that threatens to topple and destroy their ascent vehicle. It is quickly decided to abort the mission and leave Mars. In the ensuing chaos, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by debris and presumed dead. However, after the rest of the crew had already left for Earth, Watney is revealed to have survived his ordeal. Now abandoned on Mars with some equipment, he must use his wit and knowledge to survive and hope for a trip home. Meanwhile, back on Earth, NASA discovers that Watney is still alive and starts to scramble for ways to keep him alive and get him home.

This movie can be best described as a love letter written to science, engineering, and NASA. It is an exploration of how a person can use science to overcome problems and does so in a somewhat realistic fashion. This is where the movie is the most entertaining. In addition to that, I thought the cinematography was excellent as it showed the sterile, but active, environment of the Martian surface. The acting was generally good from all the major actors.

One issue I had with the film is that plot seemed rather thin for much of the movie. You watch Watney as he solves problems, but not much else. There is not a lot of tension as Watney goes through the motions to stay alive. It is almost as if the movie is lacking a human element.

This Blu-ray release is rather light on the bonus features for such a technically advanced film. There are two short making-of features. Also included are a series of promos that were done in-universe which are honestly more bizarre to watch than anything else.

I enjoyed this movie. If you like hard science fiction, movies such as Apollo 13 and Gravity instead of Star Wars and Armageddon, then I would recommend this.",1466208000,,1869,4.570149253731343

7519403,4,B017S3OP7A,"Being on a different planet alone.  That's gotta be a scary feeling!  The first to walk around on a whole planet, as Matt Damon even mentions in one scene.  If that isn't one of the craziest moments of freedom you've ever felt, I don't know what is!  None of us will ever get to experience such a true sense of being alone (even though those who live near the top of Alaska come close!)

The Martian is about an astronaut crew assuming Matt Damon dies after debris hits Matt and sends him flying back a pretty good bit so they leave him behind, however a short time later the NASA scientists notice something on the radar- movement!  Yup that's Matt alright, and he's alive and functional.  The good news is that he's alive, but the bad news?  Well the astronauts deserted him and in order to bring him back, technology setbacks and disputes amongst the NASA team means that it would take many months/years to make a rescue mission happen.

So what does Matt Damon do to waste time?  Well at first after he returns to his ship (called the Mars Ascent Vehicle) he has to remove a pole that got jammed into his stomach.  Luckily he has the medical supplies to fix himself up and make himself good as new!  The way he takes care of this problem is pretty science fiction-y in a movie that isn't typically so frequent or noticeable showing such things.  Then again you could argue realistically trying to get someone off Mars before they die is science fiction enough!

The story spends a pretty decent chunk of time showing Matt Damon growing potatoes, listening to disco music (music he dreads but doesn't have a choice but to listen to because his crew mates favorite type of music was disco) and walking or driving a Mars rover across the barren red dirt, rocks and hills of Mars using his astronaut expertise to try and sustain as much of a life for himself as he can.

Of course anything could go wrong at any moment.  Plus he's on limited food and water supply which increases the odds of help not arriving in time and Matt not making it off the planet alive.  He could also puncture his suit and lose oxygen which is a big concern, though it seems he has the means to correct most of the minor things that could go wrong related to his suit (then again the scene where he damages his helmet, loses oxygen and need to tape himself up as quickly as possible was quite alarming for poor Matt!)

Meanwhile an even bigger chunk of the story is that the NASA team back on Earth spends a considerable amount of time trying to contact Matt using limited computer resources, and once that happens it's confirmed Matt's still alive so every rejoices!  That's one aspect of the story anyway- later on when the rescue mission gets underway, coming up with an actual plan to rescue Matt becomes more sophisticated).  I like how Matt realizes later that he can break the law by recognizing he's on a different planet, and the law doesn't say anything about that now does it!  He doesn't do anything crazy that I remember though.  Then again what law is there to break?  It's not like he knocked over his neighbors mailbox with a baseball bat.  There is no neighbor, mailbox or baseball bat on the whole planet!

Anyway the dilemma of figuring out a way to get Matt off Mars remains the theme for most of the movie.  Jeff Daniels is head of NASA (who is certainly showing his age and doesn't feel right playing this serious role given his humorous silly stuff in the Dumb and Dumber movies) so he's the jerk I guess.  Chiwetel Ejiofor, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, the silly Donald Glover (who should have had more of a role and taken more seriously than he was given his accurate description of trying to get Matt off Mars), Kristen Wiig and others do everything they can to make a return mission to Mars possible.  Time is running out for poor Matt though, and attempting to use the most advanced rocket technology to speed up the rescuing process isn't as smooth as everyone was hoping which further complicates matters.

There's a lot of sophisticated writing going on here such as Matt digging up the radioisotope thermoelectric generator, a generator used to convert heat into electric.  Perhaps more of an understanding of rocket science would help make this stuff easier to follow  Luckily the movie's never confusing to understand since the reason behind Matt or the NASA teams actions is always explained afterwards using smaller words, but this does demand that the viewer pay closer attention than usual.  Perhaps more attention should have been given to Matt Damon exploring Mars instead of being isolated to one spot, but then again the movie was trying to go for a realistic (semi-realistic?) means of attempting to rescue somebody on Mars so I guess this is understandable.  In a serious situation you wouldn't want to move around while someone is looking for you.  Then again maybe Matt just wanted to be near his supplies, and particularly worried about losing oxygen.

The acting is really good, the writing is really good too in that it strikes the perfect balance of never being too far fetched nor boring either.  You can pretty much tell Matt's not really on Mars though.  The movie relies on special effects that obviously look too fake (such as the sky).  Then again perhaps not  since I've never been to Mars so I can't say for sure what the sky would look like in person.

It does seem like space adventure movies like to have light hearted comedy elements to them, and this is no exception.  Even the NASA scientists present themselves as clumsy and silly at times, and I didn't care for this.  Donald Glover in particular was too much, as was the scene where the one scientist dumps his coffee in the trashcan and soon after trips over it.  Perhaps telling the story directly without the silly stuff should have been written instead but complaining about such a thing isn't really worth it because the movie never loses sight of the serious mission to bring Matt home.  Plus being too serious would make everyone feel ordinary and bland, so there's that to consider.  Highly recommended!",1465862400,,6101,4.608333333333333

There is just the right amount of humor and humility peppered throughout the story to lend plenty of credence to every character.  You won't get lost in the tech talk although, as you should expect, there is plenty of it.

The very concept is an immoral, disgusting financial assault and an affront to the very people that supported this studio and ordered this product earlier within the last 145 days. There is no excuse for this, period. Hey, you money grubbing studio bean counter vermin, how about offering all of us stupid consumers, lets say, a $20 coupon for the extended upgrade for those of us who still even want to do continued business with you, that keeps you well dressed, employed and driving nice cars. What you are doing to your (god knows why), loyal consumers is a page right out of the script for the movie. ""Dinner for Schmucks"". You get the dinner and that makes us the..........???

7519582,5,B017S3OP7A,"This is a dramatic presentation of the survival of a lone astronaut on Mars. As a space scientist working for NASA all my professional life, I would say the story is more than plausible; the story overstretches some aspects, but on the whole, under the right circumstances, the feat is quite feasible. I am mostly impressed by the Chinese participation in the rescue efforts. NASA has steadfast refused to share space exploration with China out of fear of ""leaking"" secrets to China. As a scientist, I do not think there are any secrets; the fact that ""it can be done"" is the biggest secret. Take the nuclear bomb as an example. Despite the common belief that Russians (or the defunct Soviet Union) stole the atomic secrets from the U S, the biggest secret in the nuclear bomb is that ""it can be done."" Once the feasibility of the bomb is demonstrated, it would take an intelligent physicist only hours to figure out HOW to make it (to make it is another story, it will require extensive engineering and scientific expertise). Likewise, the Chinese developed their space programs without U S help and they are about to land a female astronaut on the Moon (that a female is chosen is to fulfill a long held Chinese legend of Chang-&eacute;, a woman who fled to the Moon).",1465084800,,1270,4.648888888888889

7519622,2,B017S3OP7A,"A review on one site calls this flick ""Human Ingenuity: The Movie."" Meh. I think ""Cast Away"" did that much better. I did not read the book on which this movie was based or read any reviews (critical or otherwise) before I watched ""The Martian"". All I had seen was the trailer, and all I knew was that people seemed to love it and praise it to high heaven. So I eagerly anticipated enjoying the movie myself. Man, was this a letdown!

Thin or nonexistent characterizations, too many superfluous characters (many of them flat), too much talking, too much switching between sets of characters. I think Jeff Daniels must have gotten botox injections before his scenes, because his face barely moved the entire movie. At one point two characters spend at least a minute debating the tone in which Matt Damon's character had written something along the lines of ""Are you kidding me?"" I'm serious. That conversation actually took place in the movie.

Character A: 'Do you think he meant, ""Are you kidding me?"" Or was it more like ""Are you kidding me?!""'
Character B: 'I think it was the first one.'

I'm not watching this scene as I type this, so I can't be totally sure that's what they said, but it's close. And it didn't end there! They continued to discuss the possible tone of the message! Are YOU kidding me, movie? Stop wasting my time! This asinine conversation does NOT qualify as humor! The movie bored me and had zero emotional punch. I agree with others who have mentioned how predictable this was, too. That means zero tension, zero suspense, which translates to zero enjoyment. It was pretty, with mostly good SFX; that's IT. I might have found the movie more fascinating if the tagline (and outcome) had been ""Left to Die"" instead of ""Bring Him Home"" and the movie was about the recovery of Watney's body and cheery, yet resolute video logs (I dislike the non-word ""vlogs"") and not the rescue of Watney himself. I didn't even like the guy.

If you find profanity distasteful like I do, you'll be annoyed early and often. You get two f-bombs within the first half hour or so of the movie and more f-bombs are implied later. For me, this did nothing to make Matt Damon's character either sympathetic or heroic. On the back end of the movie, you get a gratuitous, yet creepy CGI visual of Matt Damon's naked back and backside as he walks away from a shower. I'm pretty sure I would have been able to tell that the character had lost a lot of weight without seeing ""him"" naked. And by ""him"", I mean the CGI body they pasted onto the Matt Damon's head. It looked weird and slimy, probably because of the unnatural way it moved. Yuck.

I feel I wasted my time and money on this movie. Maybe I can spare someone else.",1464912000,,2718,4.538775510204082

7519734,5,B017S3OP7A,"I watched this movie with a real NASA astronaut. He told us that many of the science/math points were mistakes, or 'artistic license', but many were correct and accurate, especially the gravity boost from the orbit around the planets. This science fiction movie is much better done than earlier ones. Unlike ""Gravity"" which used actual imagery from the space station, this movie was filmed in Jordan. But the landscape was quite convincing. ""Interstellar"" played on some scientific concepts but was a fantasy.

The most convincing part of the movie is the attitude of the main character (portrayed by Matt Damon). He did grieve and did become frustrated, and he did show fear, but he immediately started to record his experience and relentlessly PROBLEM-SOLVE, PROBLEM-SOLVE. He was very creative and diligent -- that shows that his emotional state was OK. Clinically depressed people are not able to think well, and often suffer from inertia. He maintained a positive outlook and accepted his own death long before it might happen. He did not blame his colleagues, NASA, bad luck, or anyone or anything for his situation. These are all traits that NASA selects for in astronauts.

I thought I would be bored, and I was worried and scared, but I watched the movie twice: the first time, straight through on the big screen TV. The second time on the computer which displayed little details and profiles of the actors which I found to be very interesting. The notes told me some of the differences between the movie and the novel on which it was based, and some mistakes such as the positive pressure inside would bulge out the tarp and it won't flap, or in weightlessness, you cannot change direction without a push.",1464566400,,1715,4.890034364261169

7519918,4,B017S3OP7A,"that I don't believe anyone reading this review will ever live to see 3 or more Mars expeditions (we'll always be told ""it's too expensive""). The movie follows the book in as faithful an adaptation as I think I've ever seen and even gets most things (the atmosphere is supposed to be too thin to support such a storm as we see in the opening scene) right. The classroom scene at movie's end is the biggest difference between book and screen.
Action and adventure? some, but this is no Star Wars and you'll get no aliens or even a mention of microbes-  you just get a wonderful portrayal of the Red Planet. I'm actually surprised the movie did so well, there must be more ""Mars""/""Space"" people around than I'd expected because this is just the sort of movie that would appeal to them.

Amazon doesn't tell you this but the DVD has no special features, the Blu-ray has over an hours worth. I haven't watched them yet but they look interesting.",1463616000,,941,4.497076023391813

I guess the film is better than the book in my estimation, mainly because we do not have to hear every single obnoxious blog entry from the main character. (Not sure why all the hype for either film or book, though, as they are both underwhelming.) This film is sort of standard Hollywood stuff: non-engaging, predictable, and weak dialogue, people going through motions. When you really could care less about a main character, then it really sort of kills the experience. It is one of those cases where the premise-- a man being stranded on Mars and having to figure out how to survive-- is so much better than the actual experience of the film. Very mediocre film, hard to believe it was one of the nominees for Best Picture. Was 2015 that watered down?",1463184000,2,870,4.583333333333333

7520008,1,B017S3OP7A,"If you relish the thought of watching Matt Damon cultivate potatoes on Mars from astronaut turds, this is the movie for you.

The plot of ""The Martian"" is plodding, predictable, and pedestrian. It never gets off the ground, so to speak.  It tries to make up for a hackneyed plot by appealing to the nostalgia of its forty-something audience with references to the ""Fonz"" from the tv show Happy Days (yuk) and jokes about Disco music (blegh).

The movie is Hollywood propaganda at its most boring...the only  relief is from the usual talented photography of Ridley Scott, the pre-eminent Shabez Goy director.

""The Martian"" supports Hollywood's continuing stream of budget-plundering military propaganda  tha the US actually landed on the moon.  The movie makes the standard nod to the lie that  Neil Armstrong was the first man (Freemason) to step on the moon and shows the standard scenes of astronauts floating around in their space capsule that we've grown used to from the phony ISS footage. (See: Bart Sibrel's ""We Never Went to the Moon"" on youtube.) Hollywood's continuing support for the hero mythology of conquering space justifies the budget of NASA -- that big sucking sound on the wallets of the US taxpayers. This budget, far from exploring space, is being diverted to Black Weapons programs whose goal is to enslave the Earth for the benefit of an Oligarchy of the Rich (""defense"" CEOs and owners of the Federal Reserve Bank).

The second  goal of this movie propaganda is to  de-commission the Cold War Script, which reigned between 1946 and 1989,  frightening Americans with the US's ""mortal"" enemies, the Chinese (and Russians).  The truth was that the Global Central Banksters installed Mao Tse Tung as their ""man in Beijing"" in 1944, along with Mao's ""handlers"" Sidney Rittenberg, Sidney Shapiro, Israel Epstein and other Elite gofers.  See youtube: (/watch?v=9cSMss7W2_k)

Following the Central Banksters' WW II, enemies were needed to keep Congress scared into funneling cash to  the US  ""defense"" industry; enemies were needed to justify draconian domestic surveillance; enemies were needed to justify borrowing from the Fed Reserve Bank.  The Central Banksters'  game is always the same....they only change the US's designated enemy.

In the early 1970s the Central Banksters ordered Kissinger to begin rehabilitating the Chinese by giving them Most Favored Nation trade status. When Pres Nixon dragged his feet in taking orders, the Central Banksters and their shabez goyim in the Navy used their ""reporters"" at the Washington Post and New York Times to Watergate Nixon out of office. (Nixon was under the delusion that the presidency had power). Nixon's threat to open up the ""Bay of Pigs"" thing (a reference to the CIA-Mossad-Fed's murder of JFK) only infuriated the CIA's Richard Helms, who sped up Nixon's removal from office.

In 1991 London's and Wall Street's Central Banksters rehabilitated the West's alleged enemies, the ""Soviets,"" when their ""man in Moscow,"" Mikhail Gorbachev, de-commissioned the Soviet Union, turning over the country to his co-conspirator Boris Yeltsin. The IMF sent its stooge Jeffrey Sachs to Moscow to help the Jewish Oligarchs divvy up Russia's resources.  The Central Banksters had tired of propping up the Soviet Union's basket-case economy out of the US Treasury. The Central Banksters'  man, Obama, is now (2016) rehabilitating their bogeyman Fidel Castro and Cuba. (Evidently it's time to re-open Meyer Lansky's Havana casinos and Cuba as a tax-haven.)

""The Martian"" fully de-commissions China as an enemy, because it shows China helping save Matt Damon even at the cost of exposing  their secret rocket program. (Why the movie portrays China as having military secrets is a mystery, given that Clinton and the NeoCons gave all our military secrets to the Chinese in the 1990s, that is, all the secrets not already given them by Jonathan Pollard and the Israelis.)

The NWO no longer needs Russia and China as bogeymen, although it still needs a bogeyman, because the Banking Crime Syndicate needs another world war to zero out the dollar and launch a new currency.  Morphing the US's former enemies, the Russians and Chinese, into ""allies"" is part of a long-term plan, written over 100 years ago. This plan scripts the final triumph of the New World Order, which is, in actuality, the Central Bankster-Hollywood ""Jew World Order.""  (Read ""The Jewish Utopia"" by Rabbi Michael Higger, published in 1938.)

The NWO cannot be ushered in without a WW III  that completely destroys Europe and the US as united political entities.  A new enemy (replacing the Chinese and Russians) is needed. So far, the ""Israel Firsters"" and their Judeomasonic flunkies  seem to be wavering between North Korea, Syria, and Iran. They have primed Europe for domestic implosion by ferrying thousands of  Muslim and African young men into Europe (leaving the Mideast ethnically cleansed for a Greater Israel).

The stench of  Hollywood's Astronaut Potatoes is everywhere.",1462838400,4,5011,5.182608695652174

7520115,5,B017S3OP7A,"Only Matt Damon has the skill to play a solo role for 90 minutes or so without boring the audience. Instead, we were sitting on the edge of our seats. Even though I had read the book (so I knew how the story ended)  it was so well-done that it was like watching a documentary. One imagines that this is what human travel to Mars will be really like (if they can ever get the Astronauts' union to allow the eating of potatoes for 2 years)

An early part of the film glossed over the situation that caused Damon to be abandoned on Mars. The necessity for the space ship to blast off was unclear. Readers of the book had a better 'picture' of the storm and emergency exit of the space craft than viewers of the film. The term ""Sol"" meaning a Martian day, was not explained well in the film, nor was the time interval between transmitting a message and receiving it. The way Damon 'developed a visual code' to communicate with NASA was also glossed over in the film.

Nevertheless, I rate this film Five Stars!  .",1462060800,,1009,4.294736842105263

7520120,4,B017S3OP7A,"When Matt Damon was nominated for a Golden Globe award for ""The Martian"" I was surprised to see him in the ""Comedy"" category. I had not seen the film at that time, but knowing what I did know about it I couldn't believe it was a comedy. Now that I have seen it, there are certainly a number of laugh out loud moments, but those are in context and the film is most definitely not a comedy.
  I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Martian"" even though one might think of it as sort of ""Gravity"" on solid ground. For me it was more like ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" than anything else, although there is no ""Friday.""
  The cinematography in the film is spectacular. I really felt like I was on Mars. Of course there has to be somewhat of a suspension of disbelief given the idea of someone being stranded on Mars, but that was easy enough to do. I could go on about this film but I'll leave it at this: It is a good movie, well made, and entertaining. One can't ask for much more than that.",1461974400,,972,4.181818181818182

The author must have excellent communication skills per se, since the tone of narrative was funny, affable, familiar, and uncomplicated. The theme, of course, is amazing and shines for its portrayal of resilience and self-assurance, while not entirely diminishing equally-limiting human traits such as despair, frustration, and hopelessness. The movie, in my opinion, did some justice to the main character in that it was Matt Damon who played it---a very well-taken care of and physically fit, Matt Damon. Yes, please.

Also, in order to keep it PG-13 they had to cut out some parts (IE a few of JPL and Mark's chats) but that just makes it more fun as you can sit there and laugh at the reactions and knowing that most other people in the room don't know what Mark just said. Personally, I'd recommend buying the movie in a disk version as you cannot download the movie onto a SD card from Amazon, accidentally made that mistake thinking I could take it on the go in non-wifi places. iTunes would be a nice alternative if you don't want the disk and only the file.

Unbelievable, with stupid ""feel-good"" soundtrack sequences, bottoming out with ""Waterloo.""

The premise could have worked with the addition of a little HUMAN drama instead of machine malfunctions substituting: have 2 or 3 astronauts abandoned, with some kind of conflict and surprise between them -- the food runs out, one turns into Alferd Packer and cannibalizes his mates.

For a quiet, reserved guy like him, that's the equivalent of getting 'THE MARTIAN' tattooed on his chest so nobody will misunderstand his meaning when he strips naked and runs through the streets screaming at everyone to watch it as he pelts them with copies of the book. it's definitely one of his favorite movies of all time. And, you know what? I agree with him. This movie is spectacular. We watched it again last night, as we've done at least once a month since it came out, and I think I'd like to watch it again tonight.

7520194,5,B017S3OP7A,"The Martian is a wonderful movie. Its a nearly perfect blend of drama, high adventure, suspense, comedy, and realistically futuristic technology. Starring Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Sean Bean, and directed by Ridley Scott, it tells the story of an American astronaut who must fight for his survival after becoming stranded on Mars.

It is the year 2035. Mark Watney (Damon) is a member of the six-person crew of astronauts on the Ares III mission to Mars. When he is struck by flying debris during a blinding windstorm, he is presumed dead by Commander Melissa Lewis (Chastain) his other five crew mates. They are forced to leave Watney behind on the Red Planet when the mission is scrubbed.

But Watney is not dead but only badly injured. Hes completely alone and stranded 140 million miles from home. The next mission to Mars won't reach him for another four years. Now he must figure out how to survive until someone can come and rescue him.

Meanwhile, back on earth, officials at NASA soon learn that the astronaut they thought was dead is very much alive. They must figure out a way to rescue him before his food and supplies run out. They find their efforts slowed by internal politics and bureaucratic infighting, and a catastrophic event that could leave Watney stranded on Mars forever

There is a whole lot to like about The Martian. The film features Matt Damon in his most engaging role. He portrays Mark Watney as smart, decisive, ingenious, unflappable, and with a keen sense of humor. He allows himself only a few minutes of fear before he decides to buckle down, science the sh! t out of his problem, and find a way to survive long enough to get home. I think Damons scenes on Mars are among the most enjoyable of the film.

The scenes featuring NASAs efforts to rescue Watney are also excellent. NASA Director Teddy Sanders (Daniels) and Mars Mission Director Vincent Kapoor (Ojiofor) find themselves at loggerheads with Crew Director Mitch Henderson (Bean) in making the necessary decisions to rescue Watney.  These scenes are quite realistic in their depiction of the infighting and political wrangling that frequently goes on in a bureaucracy.

The Martian is undoubtedly the best science fiction movie that Ive seen in a long, long time.  Highly recommended.",1461628800,2,2319,4.8979591836734695

7520233,4,B017S3OP7A,"I watched Gravity, The Martian and Interstellar

Interstellar has probably all of the elements of a ""good"" captivating film comparing to the others. It's behind the science in comparing to The Martian, but it has a metaphysical angle that some may like (akin to 2001). I did not have any issues with the pacing of the film, though it might be long for non sci fans. There are some conceptual and science plot holes like any sci-fi film, but not in an annoying way (like gravity). Though for the main concept you'd have to suspend disbelief. I would put this in the same category as Kubrick 2001, but not above it. Story is a 5/5, Science is a 5/4.

The Martian is a more of solid ""science now"" movie. So while great all around it's not as ""sci-fi"" as some other more ""futuristic"" films, which is both a positive to some and maybe a negative to others. While I'm pretty good in picking up technical faults, they were not obvious in this film. This is a solid well researched film. If you're technically inclined you might actually predict technical problems before they happen, which was a surprise for me since pretty much any other sci-fi film I had watched before simply made things up. I can't think of many other films to compare it to, except maybe Gravity for what it tried to do and failed at. Story is a 5/4, Science is a 5/5.

Gravity is a film I wanted to like but it just has a number of conceptual problems that I can not look past. I was most disappointed in that while it was depicting ""space"" they could not stop and let you feel like you're in space. For example, 2001 did this brilliantly with the sound of breathing, in this film they just stick music in when they run out of all of that annoying dialogue. I did not like the Sandra Bullock character at all. Her character came off too much like the female equivalent of ""average joe"" in space, which I found annoying. Her presence in the film made all of the holes in the film rather glaring. The positive of this film is that it has realistic orbital mechanics (Physics). But not realistic Science. Story is a 5/3, Science is a 5/3.",1461456000,,2102,4.3984575835475574

7520249,4,B017S3OP7A,"Better book though.
When I read the book, there were a couple of stand-out characters for me. Venkat Kapoor, who became Vincent in the film, and Mindy who lost her snark in the movie adaption. In the book, she was so funny and sarcastic, but she was completely looked over in the movie. Forgettable, even.
Still, the book was brought to life for me. Martinez was still funny and Mark Watney, well, Matt Damon, was the perfect choice for that role. He was outstanding!
Minus the character flaws and a couple of things left out, the movie was awesome. To get the terrain of Mars, the effects, and have so much of the story adapted well that I have to highly recommend it to you to watch. I do hope you read the book first though, it will make a difference.

I've watched it now multiple times and read the book multiple times and neither suffers from repeat exposure.  That's the sign of good writing and good movie making.  The movie made quite a few changes from the book, but they were necessary or it would have had to been done as a mini-series.

One quibble with the movie that did bug me was the EVA  scenes on the Hermes ship.  No NASA astronaut would even EVA without a tether.  The scenes of guy outside the ship pulling himself along, especially across the rotating section (which would have flung him into his own trajectory never to be seen again) were not really necessary.  It could have been done correctly with tethers and been just as dramatic.  Same for the scenes with the astronauts in the open airlocks, no tethers, not wise.

7520303,3,B017S3OP7A,"The story line is great. Two negatives for me, I don't feel the emotion of Matt Damon's character when he starts to cry. It felt more like an unexpected interruption to the action about to happen. Also, the captain's believability as an in-charge person is not believable. She's forcing her authority instead of owning it. She's too inconsistent emotionally. Jeff Daniels should have been the captain, older, authoritative and believable. He and Chiwetel Ejiofor are the two actor's who created the most dynamic drama in the movie. Ejiofor should have been the astronaut left behind on Mars. Just looking at his facial expressions would have sold emotions we wanted to feel. The other actor who seemed like the real deal was the Chinese actor who was in charge of building the rescue/supply rocket.",1461283200,2,798,5.007518796992481

Ridley Scott returns to his brilliant best in this epic tale of survival and morals. Matt Damon, the Martian, provides one of the best performances of his career, capturing the audience from the minute he appears on screen. The fantastic story is aided by great acting all round.

The Martian is about astronaut Mark Watney who is presumed dead after a violent storm and left behind by the crew. He actually lives and must survive on Mars for months with meager supplies and his own ingenuity. he delivers one of his most spectacular movies to date that's capable of making you laugh and putting you on the edge of your seat. The final act of the film is particularly nail-biting, drawing comparisons to some of Gravity's most terrifying scenes. But what makes The Martian such a hit is its heart. Besides its great humor and amazing characters, it emphasizes the value and integrity of the human spirit.",1460937600,,1082,4.5487179487179485

The filming was really spectacular, not gratuitous but just spot on. It was Apollo 13 meets Cast Away meets The Right Stuff. Matt Damon was of course great, funny, witty, and made you feel you were with him on Mars. Really like all the low-tech solutions to hi-tech problems and the movie did not drag out too long. I thought the most impressive part was the tech and science in this is not to far away and Space X and Blue Horizon could reach these heights very soon.

Movie does make you think if we reach for the stars, is it only to explore or inhabit? And if we do inhabit, why and what are the benefits? Scientists doing experiments on planets, or studying and testing is one thing but permanent inhabitants is another.

Matt Damon is great in this Science Fiction blockbuster. Some of the ideas were a bit dubious at times especially when he digs up an old space junk which looks brand new and works immediately.
Cutting a hole in the top of the rocket and launching it with a parachute also seemed strange, no heat to contain?

7520419,5,B017S3OP7A,"I watched Gravity months prior to this and I had to walk away from that movie from basic drama and the fear it induced on ""Scream Tactics"". The only meat in it was trying to make me startled all the time. I had read this book and loved the read but wondered if it would translate well or if they'd do the same thing.

They didn't try that and it really translated well. They cut down on the verbal cursing (which I didn't mind as an adult) but they did it so subtlety so that it's really still there and winks at the writing in the book and is fine around the kids (unless they read lips). You still get the idea that he IS a space pirate in his position and is having very frustrating moments up there on his own.

I don't do movie reviews and wax about this or that. As a viewer they did capture the book well. What Gravity did throughout their entire movie, this one did where it was needed and not abused for hours on end. It was just great fun to see our beloved character work through problems and perhaps what we'd go through ourselves. ""Am I doomed?"" Yes, but I won't give up trying all the things.

I compare it to Gravity only because it made you think about how scary space really is, then underlined it. This one has someone not grabbing for straws and hoping for the best and bumping around space, he's left on Mars and doing everything he knows to do in order to maybe survive. Make it in the end or not, there's some real scientific method being used in The Martian and we get to see every win and many losses in the system of space travel.

I wanted to be a police officer growing up. When that became too risky, I wanted to be an astronaut because everything is perfect with them. Nope...this movie moves you emotionally.

If you have or haven't read the book, it's hilarious either way. No funny is lost and to even the non-readers we laughed and cried. No spoilers!",1460678400,,1884,4.222222222222222

Directed by Ridley Scott.

Mark Watney (Matt Damon), Nick Martinez (Michael Pena), Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie)  are astronauts of the Ares 3 taking soil samples of Mars. Dr. Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara) in the HAB is getting tired of them chatting with each other outside. She finds it annoying. The astronauts are in a good mood.  Suddenly, the doctor gets a Mission Command on the computer. There is a severe storm coming and it does not look good. The astronauts go back into the HAB. Watney wants to wait out the storm, but Commander Lewis decides to go with the emergency procedure and scrub the mission. They go out into the storm and try to get to the Mars Ascent Vehicle Ship. Watney gets hit by flying debris and is carried by the wind. Martinez is already in the ship as the pilot and is given orders to prepare to leave. Lewis is looking for Watney, but it is too hard to see anything. Martinez doesn't want to leave yet. Beck (Sebastian Stan) thinks Watney is dead. he wants to leave. Lewis calls out to Watney one last time before going into the ship. The winds are so strong. The ship almost tipped. Martinez fires the propulsion and they blast off without Watney.
  Later, we see Watney come to and he is alive. He passed out with part of an antenna stabbed into his skin at his belly. He makes it back to the HAB and fixes his injury. He can not reach NASA, so he sends a video message. They never get it. He knows it will take 4 years for a manned mission to reach him. The HAB will only last for 31 days. Eventually, he will run out of food and water. They believe he has died.
  How will he survive and can he be rescued?

7520437,3,B017S3OP7A,"A very flawed sci-fi flick.  I gave it 2.5 stars rounded to 3.  Granted, the premise is interesting, but the technical details are really poorly done.  I wanted to like this film, but just couldn't, though I generally like Matt Damon films, (but not all).

First of all, dust storms on Mars are just that - composed of very tenuous dust.  The atmospheric pressure (troposphere) is less than 1% of that on earth, incapable of supporting large shale-like fragments even in high winds.  The dust is more like cement or cornstarch - like lunar dust.  Also, ""soil"" on Mars is not like plant friendly earth dirt which incorporates humus and trace minerals necessary for growing healthy plants.  Why would a space craft have real potatoes aboard for food?  (Even for a more real Thanksgiving, as in the book.)  More likely dried potatoes.  For planting, certified seed potatoes (no larger than jawbreakers) would be more reliable and disease free.  Also, a botanist is not a horticulturist.  One studies existing plant life, the other knows how to grow plants.  Why send a botanist to a dead planet that may once have had living organisms when a microbiologist or paleontologist might be more useful?

Next, the physics, rocket science and onboard life are also very thin - fantasy.  Who doesn't know about gravitational sling shot effects and orbital efficiency, as if it had to be rediscovered.  Using meters instead of kilometers to designate altitude above the Martian surface?  Yea, 1000 meters is a low orbit - still well within the atmosphere!  What's with Happy Days as onboard entertainment?  Why not Big Bang Theory or some more contemporary sit-com ?  And why, ""In your face, Neil Armstrong"" ?  Take a slap at the pioneering astronauts?  Really a disappointing film.

I could go on, but what's the use.  (I may update this review later.)  I could have written a better screenplay.  I did really want to like the film.

Update:  I've read Weir's book now.  The book is tedious too, bogged down with technobabble.  Skipped or scanned large portions of it that distracted from the story.  And why so often from the Martian do we get, ""I tried it.  You know what.  It worked!""  I guess that's why it's science FICTION!  And Annie and her mouthy insults?  She would have been fired in an instant for snooping into 'classified' or 'proprietary' image files, regardless of gender preference.  Her job was email dispatcher, not data or image analyst!  Can we even begin to guess how many times she was laid in high school?  (The character brings it up in the book!)  I doubt Weir ever worked in a manned or unmanned spaceflight support environment.  I have - you don't insult supervisors, certainly not Mission Directors, or you'll end up fired, transferred or distributing emails, regardless of education or gender preference.  (Unless you're sleeping with one or more of them.)",1460592000,,2875,4.865424430641822

7520442,5,B017S3OP7A,"First off, you can literally NOT compare a book in all its wonderful amazing glory to film.  I listened to the Audible book first and let me say - WOW!  There is always going to be wonder and imagination lost when translating to film and you just can't fit almost 11 hours of a book into a 2 hour movie.  Things that were lost in translation - Mark Watney was HILARIOUS in the book and it only came out a little on film.  Obviously for times sake they had to cut A LOT of the suspense/drama of the book down.  Hell, a man left on Mars is drama enough!  Great job Matt Damon - as always you are a class A actor!  I can't say the same for whoever made the decision to cast Jessica Chastain in the movie OR give her a big part in the ending - WTF, why not just let it play out like it did in the book??  But no, they had to give it some extra drama.  That's ok - it worked, but ugh, please people no more Jessica Chastain - like ever.  MY OPINION, obviously.  I loved the supporting cast - Kristen Wiig as Annie was awesome - but she was a badass in the book.  They deflated her A LOT in the movie and it would have been awesome to have kept her with all her sass and badassness that she had in the book.  I did love the additional ending of the movie.  This is something you do not get in the book.  It was very cute to see Beck and Johanssen with a baby at the end - I wish they would have built up that a little more with his final letters to the crew where he tells Beck to tell her he's in love with her already...... oh, again - only in my head!  I loved seeing Martinez going up again and Vogel with his huge family... but seriously - the movie did NOT need that sour puss look that Jessica Chastain has on her face at the end .... but whatever.  I enjoyed this movie a lot.  Again, can't even compare this to the book - but on its own it was great.  I would knock this down a star alone for the fact that I had to endure a movie with Jessica Chastain in it - BUT the rest of the cast made up for her.",1460505600,,2005,3.846341463414634

What options does a stranded astronaut on Mars need to do to survive, alone? Ingenuity and fortitude, strength of will and a peppery attitude gives us The Martian! Based on a book by the same name this movie takes Robinson Carusoe to a whole new level, with agonizing determination, grit and never-ending desire to survive on a planet that is completely inhospitable to mankind!

7520512,3,B017S3OP7A,"A movie works on the childish level and constantly fails. Only if I forget all that and watch the movie as if it is an episode of Star Trek then it is watchable. But the science is way to close to what we have today for this to be a Star Trek. This movie looks like a campaign for Mars exploration. A naive, childish attempt to persuade general public that it is worth it. We are far from doing any of that which is depicted in the movie. I would expect more some sort of poetic elements, but the movie is just brutal, yet not even nearly brutal as it is on the Mars. You cannot survive on the Mars in any form if you have the situation that is displayed in the movie. Period. From that point, a documentary attempt is a total miss. It remains fake and there is nothing added. Not a thing. No personal introspection, no questions, no confusions. If there is pain, it is mostly physical apart from few moments by the end of the movie that are detached from the rest of the movie. It is kind of Indiana Jones in space, but there is no hint of adventure, it is all so serious all along.

The scenery from the Mars is beautiful. Special effects, beautiful. Anything else is artificial and bad.

I have no idea why this has 7 nominations and is so highly praised. I truly wish people were not getting used to the movies made like this.",1459987200,,1330,4.19140625

7520518,4,B017S3OP7A,"After reading the book I felt like renting this movie because the book was enjoyable. The scenes were well done, an excellent job done by the cast and put together with details in mind. Though certain aspects were focused on more than needed and it jumped passed a long period of time quickly still was a good movie. One of those movies I would have prefer been a 3 hour film. Though not a MUST SEE still a movie worth watching.",1459987200,,428,4.296296296296297
7520519,5,B017S3OP7A,"As most know this is an adaptation of a book by the same name about an Astronaut named Mark Whitney played by Matt Damon, who ends up getting stranded on Mars when the rest of his crew leaves believing that he died. The story basically revolves around his efforts to stay alive and communicate with NASA with the equipment that is left behind, and the concurrent plan to rescue him.

The acting is superb on all fronts. I think the movie was very well cast, and the script was very well done. Apparently they did not change much from the book. For those who are into science or engineering it is enjoyable because they based things in real science, and although they certainly did take liberties with some things, the kept most of those liberties plausible. And for those who are not very science literate, the film did a good job not being so technical that everything would only be understandable to scientists and engineers.

For those who get the actual disc, the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray. As for extras there are probably between an hour and a half to 2 hrs worth. The biggest is a mock documentary telling the story that plays out in the film, mainly from Sean Beam and Jeff Daniel's character's perspectives. But most of the cast is involved. There are also some commercial like vignettes promoting the Mars missions, including one done with Neil Degrasse Tyson. Then there are some behind the scenes and making of features as well. A decent amount for those who like to go through the bonus material.",1459987200,,1523,4.595588235294118

But, then, I had to watch Matt Damon.  Lots and lots of Matt Damon.  In this movie, he is a total snooze except when he is being arrogant and obnoxious.  I did not like his character at all.

Beyond that, the plot is completely predictable.  Hes left behind on Mars, assumed dead.  Hes not, of course.  You know they are coming back for him.  You know he is going to be rescued.  Its not very exciting, but watchable.  I just wish they had made the character more interesting, if not more likeable.  As played, I'm not sure the Matt Damon character is one I would risk my own life to save.

7520559,3,B017S3OP7A,"Most people don't seem to be aware that this was a book first, but it was. The book was also far superior. The problem with squeezing a book into the truncated length of a movie is that important plot points are missing which are important to the story. Mark Watney's journey just doesn't work as well in movie form. If you've never read the book I'm sure the movie would be fantastic, but honestly the novel is a classic and well worth your time.

There's also the random name/race change for Venkat Kapoor, who becomes Vincent and is black now because...reasons? Why did we need to change an Indian into a black guy? Also, Mindy Park (who is very clearly Korean) is now white for...more reasons? Also, the movie feels the need to stick an epilogue in, time which instead could have been spent elaborating on Mark's time on Mars. This entire epilogue felt very disjointed and was completely unnecessary.

Overall, the movie was enjoyable but if you like hard science fiction, read the book and skip the movie.",1459728000,,1010,4.636871508379889

I watched the 3D disk on my Optoma H26 projector with True Depth Firestorm LT DLP-link 3D glasses and I was fairly satisfied with the result. The 3D works well, but it seems to lose quality and smoothness when it transitions in the Z (depth) axis, but that could be the nature of 3D projection, the projector, my screen, or the movie, and since I only have one 3D movie, I really can't remove a star from my review.",1459641600,,819,4.3881578947368425

7520639,4,B017S3OP7A,"""The Martian"" is one of my favorite science-fiction books -- heck, one of my favorite books of all time.  It was a well-researched novel that managed to be exciting, suspenseful, and even hilarious while still being mostly grounded in reality.  When a movie adaptation was announced, I was both excited and hesitant -- excited because a movie would mean more exposure for the book, hesitant because movie adaptations rarely live up to their source material.  Despite never having seen Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" movies, I had enough faith in him as a director and in Matt Damon as an actor to give the film a shot.

In the end, the movie was very well done, and stayed faithful to the spirit of the book.  But I still find myself preferring the book, even though I greatly enjoyed the film.

Mark Watney is an astronaut serving in the Ares III mission, a manned mission to Mars that is scuttled just a few days in by a powerful windstorm.  While evacuating the planet, Mark is hit by debris, and his crewmates give him up for dead and leave the planet.  However, through a stroke of fate, Watney survives, only to realize just how screwed he is as he takes stock of what supplies his team left behind.  His mission -- to scrape up some means to survive until the next mission rolls around (which is YEARS in the future), find a way to contact NASA, and brace himself for the unforgiving environment of the red planet.  And as NASA and the people of Earth scramble to find a way to bring him home, Mark must find a way to grow his own food in the barren Martian soil, keep his equipment up and running... and not be driven nuts by the disco music his crewmates left behind.

Technically this film is very well-done, with CGI that's seamlessly integrated into the film and doesn't break one out of their suspension of disbelief.  The barren Martian landscape (in reality filmed in Jordon) is both strangely beautiful and eerily desolate, heightening the sense of Mark's isolation all the more.  Said isolation also carries over to the HAB unit that is Mark's shelter -- functional but sterile, and far from homey and comfortable.  One gets the sense that it's not only the harsh and brutal environment that Mark has to struggle against, but the oppressive loneliness that surrounds him every day.

Matt Damon does a fantastic job as Mark Watney -- conveying the seriousness of his situation, but still able to find humor and silliness despite the odds.  The mission-log feel of the book is recreated through video logs, and one gets the feeling that Mark is increasingly struggling against madness as he rants and rambles at the camera.  The supporting cast is strong as well, both in Mark's crewmates as they make their own decisions regarding saving their stranded friend and in the people on Earth trying to bring him home.  It's nice to see Jeff Daniels in a dramatic role -- I'm mostly familiar with him through the live-action ""101 Dalmatians"" movie and the insipid ""Dumb and Dumber"" franchise, so to see him able to take on a more restrained, less goofy role is very pleasant.

I confess to not enjoying the movie as much as I did the book, but I blame that on myself and on no fault of the movie.  There's just too much in the book to pack into a film, and some of the best jokes had to be cut for time or simply because they didn't work in the context of the film (it would have been difficult to convey the infamous ""boobs"" joke onscreen with the same effectiveness).  A few scenes were also changed to make them more exciting or to simply translate to film better, which I can forgive -- some things are just more exciting on a written page than they are onscreen.  All the same, however, I didn't get the same enjoyment out of the film that I did out of the book.  Probably because I knew how everything would go down already, and there weren't many surprises for me.

All the same, ""The Martian"" is one of the best book-to-movie adaptations I've seen to date, and even if you haven't read the book you will probably enjoy the film.  Even non-sci-fi fans should enjoy this film, which keeps up a steady pace and a clever sense of humor throughout.",1459382400,,4153,4.542281879194631

7520678,5,B017S3OP7A,A wonderful film and Matt is perfect in the role.  I read the book first and the film followed the book to the letter.  The film got shafted by the Academy when it put the film in the comedy category as it is not a comedy.  It is a very dramatic & exciting study of man's being stranded on an alien Planet and his ability to survive and conquer adversity.  Of course there are comedic moments but hardly the gist of the film.  Matt and Ridley Scott were robbed of the award by the placing of the film in the wrong category.,1459296000,,523,4.088235294117647

As usual, the book was better,  In it, Wier, the author, does a great job of describing Mark Watney's ingenious survival efforts using existing technology.  For some of us, it brings back high school science classes, probably why most of the technical stuff was left out of the movie.  The movie does mirror the story line of the book except for the ending.  Was this movie nominated for an Academy Award for special effects?  Should have been....  Interesting ending credits.

7520683,5,B017S3OP7A,"Tense and suspenseful but equally uplifting and optimistic, this film is THE antidote for cynicism and hopelessness in our world. Matt Damon plays his role so masterfully that even when you're thrust into his quest for survival along with him only minutes into the film you are willing to take that journey. Ultimately, that journey will prove worth it. A must-see, especially for kids with interest in science, this film puts ample focus on problem solving and scientific analysis and shows astronauts as not just rock stars, but intelligent and capable scientists too.",1459296000,,570,5.139784946236559

7520712,5,B017S3OP7A,"""Once you solve enough problems, you get to come home"".

A powerful yet daunting quote. It does not give the audience any false hope of ""if your work for it, you'll definitely succeed in some way"". Instead, it tells you the reality of life: a fighting spirit doesn't guarantee you a win, but if you don't have it, you'll never survive. Matt Damon's performance as an astronaut who constantly cracks jokes even in the face of death is absolutely brilliant writing. I've seen those who criticize this, saying that it is unrealistic, yet they fail to understand that it is those who behave contrary to normal people in the face of extreme danger who gets to survive. It shows how strong mentally the astronaut is, and he is properly rewarded in the end because of it. A strong mind will not guarantee you a life full of success, but it will make it much easier.

Great film.",1459209600,,871,4.54140127388535

I have always followed our space programs.  I lived in Melbourne, Florida for three years - watched them go up on television and ran into the front yard to watch them until they were out of sight.  I was on Merritt Island before the Trans Vertical Assembly building was there - this film just brought all that home to me.  It had everything and more.  It all started with Sputnik, launched by the Soviet Union in the fifties I think.  We got our two girls out of bed early in the morning to watch  Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.  I was watching when the three astronauts never made off the launch pad and when the Challenger exploded during flight.  Apollo 13 was my favorite space film until THE MARTIAN was released.  I plan to watch it many more times;  I believe it is very realistic and would be what is expected.

These movies should not really be compared as they are not anything alike.

The Martian was suspenseful, it made you think, and could awe you with problem solving.  Max was a rock music video.  I just can't comprehend the appeal of Max, as i was bored.

My main question is, why would you take a botanist to a planet where crops could not survive except under artificial conditions?  Personally knowing something about horticulture, I laughed myself silly at some of the things written into this script. He ""scienced the hell"" out of things, but more than likely he would have been dead before he could have grown crops. The story wasn't as intelligent as it could have been.

Glad I waited for the rental.  I like Matt Damon but this thing bit the big one.  On the suck-o-meter I think it rivals that Sandra Bullock/George Clooney interstellar train wreck called Gravity.  Both movies had me praying for an apocalyptic comet strike to end the suffering.  Hollywood studios sure can pump out the dog turd when they want to.  Then again we saw Brooklyn and Spotlight in the theaters right about the same time, and those were incredible films in their own right.  And this thing got awards?

It was gripping tale of man's will to survive in even the most desolate circumstance.  I enjoyed Damon's witty commentary in spite of the many obstacles he faced.

7521057,4,B017S3OP7A,"Great film, I was positively surprised that Ridley Scott can still do good science fiction, especially after PROMETHEUS.

If I understood correctly they used real 3D cameras on the studio sets, but went for 3D-conversion of most of the grand and landscape shots - and unfortunately that shows, because there is stereoscopic depth beyond 200 yards which doesn't exist in real life and inevitably makes the Martian mountains and the Mark's rover vehicle look ""miniaturized"".

Whether it's Ridley Scott or the conversion company Prime Focus to put the blame on I do not know.

But if you want to be impressed by a realistic and majestic view of Martian mountains, then the 3D Blu-ray isn't necessarily your friend. Here, I can already predict that the (4K) Ultra HD Blu-ray will shine.
Though its in 2D only it will show the Martian landscape as you would really see it beyond 200 yards in real life - in 2D.",1459123200,,905,4.751592356687898

There is also some BAD science. First, no sandstorm will do anything on Mars but even the author admitted to cheating to get some dramatic tension.  Second, the radiation issue is not even considered on Mars. Without a magnetic field you're toast with severe cancer.  This is not addressed although the book mentions the magical carbon fiber material that works its magic.

7521091,5,B017S3OP7A,"My wife actually wanted to watch this movie after it won the Golden Globe for 'Best Motion Picture for a Comedy or Musical'

Comedy ? I was confused because I knew this film was about an Astronaut (Matt Damon) being stranded on Mars, and I couldn't help but think of the Movie Interstellar where Matt Damon also played a Astronaut stranded on a remote planet and in that movie he wasn't funny at all.

What was even more confusing was the movie is directed by Ridley Scott who's best known for Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, Hannibal Black Hawk Down and others which are all serious drama's or action flicks not Comedies.

The movie opens up with the astronauts on the surface of Mars doing their routine duties when a sudden storm arises causing them to scrub their mission and evacuate the planet to safety. During the evac, Matt Damon's character Mark Watney is missing, thought to be dead and left behind. As it turns out Watney is alive and begins focusing his efforts on how to stay alive for three years until the next scheduled Mars mission is due to arrive. 'In the face of overwhelming odds' Watey resides he's going to have to figure a way to grow food on a planet where noting grows.

The rest of the movie is basically Matt Damon alone on Mars trying to survive ... so where's the humor in that? Well as it turns out the writers Drew Goddard and Andy Weir do a masterful job of blending hard core science and humor into a screenplay which is not only entertaining and educational and very funny.

Matt Damon is brilliant in his portrayal of Mark Watney a highly intelligent astronaut with the perfect blend of wit and boyish charm which makes your instantly fall in love with his character and route for him to survive.

The Martian is nominated for 7 Academy Awards and has already won a Golden Globe for Best Picture (Comedy) and Matt Damon won the Golden Globe for Best Actor (Comedy).

My wife's not a sci-fi fan but she thoroughly enjoyed this movie and so did I.

Turns our the Golden Globes were right ""The Martian"" is the Best Motion Picture for a Comedy or Musical ... who knew?",1458950400,,2101,4.496062992125984
7521092,4,B017S3OP7A,"I read the book, and then I read it again, and again.  As a cancer survivor, I could relate to the initial sense of futility, the realization that you are facing death.  And I also could relate to the decision not to die, and the fight to get through all of the horrors of staying alive.  I was ""blown up""--not in an airlock, but by my first dose of chemotherapy.  I saw my own struggles and triumphs in the book. And it gave me hope, and a desire to face my fight with a little more humor.

I realize it's difficult to take book that approaches 400 pages and reduce it to a 2-hour film. There are parts of the book that are totally left out of the movie, and parts of the movie are not in the book.  I suppose that is what they call creative license.  I missed the missing parts, and I was not so crazy about the parts that were made up.  Still, I have watch the movie twice.  The uplift is the same.

But, it's still a good story, and Matt Damon is absolutely the right person to play this part.  In fact, as I read the book over and over, the voice I heard in my head could have been him.

If you loved the movie, but haven't read the book, I suggest you do so--not just for the comparison to the movie, but for the joy of reading a more in depth look into this incredible journey.",1458950400,,1284,4.011811023622047

7521102,5,B017S3OP7A,"It is not a masterpiece but it is a good film though. One man abandoned on Mars because he was wounded in a strom and he was thought dead. Then the film is the discovery on Earth and on the spatial mission where the team that left him behind is that he is alive and then the decision to rescue him, on one hand. On the other hand that man, alone on Mars, takes care of his wound and then is playing Robinson Crusoe on the planet, inventing agriculture on Mars and solving all kinds of problems including communication with earth and with his team on their mission.

Of course such an adventure is highly improbable but the educational dimension is important. It wants to show that when death is in front of you, you can just accept it and find your peace with that, or you start working on and solving problems, one after the other, in order to survive as long as possible because there is always a chance that a rescue of some sort might come, or that you would be intelligent enough to survive by yourself with your own creativity and inventiveness.

It is also educational about the absurdity of different countries, here the USA and China, not working together and sure enough the film heavily suggests that they do and they actually do, which could have saved the marooned man and will have positive consequences on the future. Educational again with the position of women. The commander of the mission is a woman and she is not alone on the mission. At NASA it is less clear since all the main characters are men, particularly the director of NASA who appears as a cold, calculating man who does not accept any disobedience.

It is also educational with the team that has left one man on Mars. We are clearly told that no matter what the consequences may be one person as well as one team have to do what is ethically good, here rescue the man, and not obey orders going the other way. Mutiny is necessary when ethics are on your side. And sure enough they are shown as going on the next mission because the rescue is such an international global effort and success that no one can go into reprisals and penalties.

The Martian landscapes are beautiful though they are not Martian at all. The actors, at least the main actors, or even maybe the main actor in the singular, are good and the heroics are spectacular. Apart from that all the details are farfetched but one does not check a gift horse in the mouth. We let ourselves go into the action, the suspense (there is none since we know this poor Robinson Crusoe will be rescued just like Robinson Crusoe was because Robinson Crusoes always are, and that is pure entertainment.

The supporting cast, the drama, the dialogue, even the costumes and set designs of the respective teams meeting their deadlines seemed a little too slick and stereotypical.  The theme of this movie, about US astronauts returning home and the hurdles to returning home, was better depicted, I thought, by Ron Howard's film, Apollo 13.",1458777600,3,594,4.784313725490196

Matt Damien is very good, probably at one of his dramatic and comedic best. For any science lover, it certainly had plenty of it, much of which can easily fly over someone's head, but I think the movie balanced it out with humor, suspense, and emotion.

This movie is good for the whole family, but I think the most important people to have watching it is our young future engineers, astronomers, and astrophysicists.

D (a previous reviewer), that there was just far too much left out in the film. The movie fails to capture the heart and soul of the story. The anguish, the strength, the struggle and the tenacity of the main character in the face of adversity.
The movie made it all look like a walk in the park, whereas the book had you chewing your nails from first page to last. And, yes!! What made them think that changing the ending would improve the story?

The film omitted so much of Watney's witty personality and humor, how he dealt with his frustrations, worked through obstacles, and even the causes of some situations.  Brilliantly developed personalities such as Rich Purnell and Mindy Park were reduced to walk-ons, and events that would have endeared characters to the viewers  (such as the Tolkien reference, and the line ""None of you ever got laid in High School, did you?"") were not included.  Many really dramatic events from the book were significantly softened or completely left out.  The time Watney got blown up should have been dramatic and horrific, then heroic, then funny.  His electrocution was omitted, as was the rover roll-over accident.  And we rarely heard how much he hates potatoes.",1458432000,10,891,5.020408163265306

7521240,5,B017S3OP7A,"I am more of an action movie guy. On those rare times I watch a movie with a great story line (as in slow but interesting) I might enjoy it but only watch it once. Most movies require stupid human decisions to create the obstacle to be overcome (which really annoys me). This one didnt. Sure, the science was not always right but it was still close enough to be believable if you didn't dwell on it. I don't know why this movie is so appealing to me (given it is the opposite of what I normally like) but my wife and I have already watched it 4 times and plan to view it more in the future. Just love this movie. And Matt Damon was just right for this part (human but not overacting). I think the subtle humor smoothed over the slow parts. Though not obvious at first those overhead long distance shots of the rover driving along really set the mood for how lonely and isolated he would have been.",1458345600,9,897,4.190751445086705

7521242,2,B017S3OP7A,"Here is the deal: 5 starts because the movie is well made when it comes to graphics and for all the scenes, as well as the audio mix. Because I have to say, if you think it is impossible to survive a 12G launch inside a capsule with rocket boosters and just a tarp between your space suit and the elements, this movie isn't for you because that's exactly what Matt Damon did. The stretch of reality is just too much, the science is too flawed. They can get away with it  because they know the public-school attendee audience won't check anything and don't know any better. I think it would have made more sense if he would have been saved by an alien space ship and brought back to earth for the biggest close encounters of the 3rd kind that would make Spielberg blush. If you remove all the impossible things and don't mind that numbers 13 and 33 are brought up often and show up in several scenes, you'll have fun watching this.",1458345600,,930,4.314285714285714

7521244,3,B017S3OP7A,A lot of stuff about this movie was really good except for two things. The commercials made you feel like you would know more about his family and how they felt in all of this and the second was the freaking music. From the commercials you had the idea that you would get Jimi Hendrix doing All Along the Watchtower and instead you got Donna Summers doing Hot Stuff!...I would have changed some of the writing to incorporate better music and  to include the moments with his family etc. The acting was awesome..The effects were awesome...but the writing and the musical score leave a lot to be desired.,1458345600,,602,4.574074074074074

I was skeptical about how good it could be with so much solo time with one actor, but it definitely did not fail to please. I often fall asleep during even good action or thriller movies, but this one kept me awake! It was very intellectual, and very fun. A lot of the writing was very witty.

I imagine anyone interested in purchasing this already knows the plot, so I won't cover that here, esp. as other reviewers will likely do that very well.  Incredibly well acted; it may have been Leo's year for an Oscar, but Matt Damon carries this movie almost entirely on his very capable shoulders.  The other cast are all great, but this is Matt's movie.  Well worth a rental to anyone, even if you aren't a ""space"" movie kind of person.",1458259200,,588,4.407407407407407

7521295,4,B017S3OP7A,"The Martian is not the best scifi movie I ever saw, but it is reasonably faithful to the book for a change. Only a little tiresome with the manipulated tears. Funny how the tear ducts respond even when the brain is saying oh, come on now. I still think, as I did with the book, that the author was too much of a NASA and government fanboy. The stranded astroanut being of and being rescued by a private space company would have been much more interesting. There were sequences that demanded some NASA involvement but those could have been finessed. I also came away with less of a sense of the books story of one mans ingenuity in the face of impossible odds. The movie's stranded astronaut always seemed to be plugging in available hardware rather than devising unique ways around his problems. More of the focus, certainly more than in the book, was on NASA and its (in this case) babe or black scientists and their ingenuity in working out a rescue. The group, rather than the individual, was a cause for celebration. Typical of the leftist socialist worldview so prevalent in Hollywood.",1458259200,,1090,4.623711340206185

Fabulously chatty people have a huge 'base' on Mars but one day while they're outside doing fabulous things (in their svelt Mars-Suits) a huge dust storm moves in and Matt Damon gets run-through by some thing or whatever. But meanwhile, his friends blast off for Earth without him and so he needs a general surgeon and a rocket real bad. But Matt manages to do his own surgery and soon he's making fabulous videos. But somehow he never manages to actually radio home. Anyway, that's where I left.

Mars' atmosphere is so thin that even the strongest 'wind' would be a puff. Yes, the planet has dust storm but again, their winds would push a daisy over much less a fat man like Matt. This is a movie for three-year-old kids.",1458172800,18,891,4.493827160493828

It follows the general story, but so much was skipped that I'm sure those who haven't read the book would be confused at various points throughout. I'd also venture to guess, due to the length already, the missing details are on the cutting room floor. Not a bad movie per se, but with Ridley Scott behind the wheel, we should expect upwards of three hours and a much more cohesive story. Hold out for the directors cut, assuming this flick has the staying power.",1458172800,,504,4.489130434782608

But watching the film in 3D actually hurt my eyes because the background was out of focus in order to project the 3D image.  My eyes wanted to see the main action even if not in the front, where there was focus.  So we ended up preferring the 2D DVD (which came with this).",1458172800,,430,4.246913580246914

7521352,4,B017S3OP7A,"One of the greatest Sci-fi directors of all time proves why he is one of the greatest Sci-fi directors of all time with this beautifully filmed and masterfully written tale of hope and survival.  What makes great science fiction is not the tech, story complexities, fantasy, or even the glimpses of unique and astounding possibilities; but an undeniable humanity that connects with the audiences' soul on both a collective and very personal level.  This is great science fiction.  Now, is the science part 100% accurate?  No, of course not; if that were the case, this story wouldn't even be possible.  But the inspired performances of Damon and his supporting cast and a well-crafted script eclipses any anomalies, no matter how glaring.  The subtle humor and genuineness of Matt's space castaway, mixed with stunning cinematography and dynamic action and effects, make this an instant classic in its genre.  I would have preferred a little less Disco, but it was a small price to pay to be thoroughly immersed in this amazing film.

Ahhh, but for one minor nitpicky casting problem ... one of the NASA characters is from one culture in the book and another in the film, while retaining the same name. A minor nit to pick but it is glaring. The transfer to disc is excellent, audio is excellent. Overall I recommend this to anyone who loves sci-fi. If you really want a treat pick up a copy of the audiobook - it's much better than the printed book or the movie because the narrator absolutely nails the character of Mark Watney perfectly and your imagination sets a stage that the movie never could.",1458000000,2,707,4.709677419354839

7521577,4,B017S3OP7A,"The Martian was a film I feared might be quite boring and wondered if I would be kept interested throughout its length, but to its credit it was quite entertaining. Basically it's a remake of countless lone survivor stranded on a desert island movies that have been released over the years, just set this time on Mars. But the visuals are good, although maybe a little too good to be believable, we have the Hollywood style spaceships that are like houses with loungerooms, dining rooms, even a gym with plenty of equipment for just a small crew that is spaced out far apart. Even when he gets stranded he's got a big house sized lab to live in on Mars, not to mention there's tubs full of personal items and well a lot of stuff (if you're going to have a lot of non essential stuff why not have more food, just in case something like this happens? It would have been more plausible if his biggest shelter was the moon buggy truck thing and he had to survive in that.

But this is a work of fiction, and movies don't have to be believable or plausible to be enjoyable. The Martian is enjoyable. Spoilers are talked about in the following. If it was plausible for the original crew to rescue him, why was this not discussed as an option from the beginning when the ship would only have been however many weeks away from Mars before NASA discovered he might be alive. I had assumed there was only so much fuel and that the ship had already journeyed past the point of no return for a rescue which was why they didn't notify them he was still alive. I found it odd that no one in the media or through the media questions the likely trillions of dollars it would cost to rescue him, as surely hospitals, schools and everything else aren't rolling in cash in the future either. People already debate about spending millions looking for the Malaysian Airlines flight that disappeared, and we're talking trillions in this Mars rescue case. I could understand fast tracking the next mission straight away and landing on the same part of Mars instead wherever else they would have but I would think at least someone would debate spending that much money on saving the life of just one human who would have committed to the risk of death going in. They could have then shown his parents, family and friends pleading with the world to spend that money, as we don't even see them at all in the film.",1457827200,,2387,4.449771689497717

7521634,1,B017S3OP7A,"Best Picture nomination?  Best Actor nomination?  Really?  WTF.  This is easily in the top 20 all time worst movies I have ever watched.

Matt Damon portrays Mark Watley, who was inadvertently left behind on Mars by his crew, because they thought he was dead.  The entire movie is about Watley's attempts to keep himself alive, and NASA's retrieval efforts.  This COULD have been a fantastic movie, but I never not once believed any of it, and that is what science fiction movies are about - getting you to believe that they are real and can happen.

Matt Damon probably did as good as he could with the script he had, but I never forgot for a moment that it was Matt Damon.  When an actor cannot get you to see past his star quality, it's a poor acting job.  Damon did a superior job of acting in Good Will Hunting, but was unable to make me believe that this astronaut was in serious trouble or that he was worth saving.  There was just no connection to his character.  The rest of the cast also did the best they could, but most looked very uncomfortable with their roles, i.e., Kristin Wiiig, and the dialogue was stilted and predictable.

The plot had more holes in it than a spaghetti colander.  I won't even go into the lack of science that went into some of their statements.  However, the amount of stuff that goes wrong with this guy is ridiculous.  It flat out would never have happened.  SPOILER AHEAD - Then there is China stepping in and giving up one of their major secrets to our space program to help us get Mark home.  Yeah, right.  I can tell you this - the rescue attempts for this guy were in the billions, and if you think for one moment that NASA and the US government would spend that kind of money on one man's rescue, I have beachfront property for you.  At the end, in Times Square, thousands of people watched CNN instead of watching it at home on their TVs.  The whole thing was ridiculous.  Then there were the awkward and stilted comedy scenes, which just fell flat.

I kept watching this movie because I kept thinking, ""It was nominated for awards.  Surely it will get better"".  Eh...no.  No, it never did.  In fact, as the movie went along, it went from a promising exciting movie to a dead bore.  There was one bright spot in this movie that I think I should mention.  There was a little known actor named Donald Glover there (no relation to Danny), which stole every scene he was in.  He was humorous and nerdy, and made me believe that he was just that crazy - other than him, I thought every other actor stunk the joint up.

Bottom line - Pass on this one or waste 2-1/2 hours of your life.",1457827200,11,2627,4.354639175257732

Why should you watch this intricate science fiction adventure film? First, I thought the film adaptation stayed true to the book of the same title authored by Andy Weir. Second, I could see how the entire cast came alive in the film due to their amazing relationships on the movie set and in real life. Third, I naturally gravitate towards film adaptations of novels that teach a life lesson. This film does that. Lastly, I think everyone should watch this epic science fiction film, but especially those who struggle with living from day to day because it will inspire you to change your life.",1457568000,,743,4.511111111111111

7521831,4,B017S3OP7A,"I'm somewhat divided on the merits of ""The Martian"".  As entertainment, it's smashing, particularly since it was directed by the master Ridley Scott (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Gladiator"", etc.) with fine acting by Matt Damon playing an American astronaut who survives a disastrous manned mission to Mars and must figure out a way to survive on Mars until he can be rescued.

I'm split on this film because in spite of the film's excellent production, it lacks much that could be considered either depth, ideas to ponder, or even resonance, things Scott's lesser films usually provide.  It actually resembles more of a lightweight pre-Schindler Spielberg film because it seems to settle into merely being a 'crowd pleaser,' much closer to ""Rocky"" than to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", though many might think that preferable.  I also feel ""The Martian"" has weaknesses as drama: it seems astonishing that our astronaut appears to work things out too easily with little going wrong (until the final rather unlikely 'rescue'), and he never exhibits any emotional or psychological problems, something rather unrealistic as well as dramatically sophomoric. Frankly, it needed a harder edge, even toward the 'darkly realistic', and I can't understand why Scott didn't flesh this out in the script unless its production was, at some point, rushed.  Nevertheless, it is excellently made, a spectacular piece of movie entertainment that I thoroughly enjoyed, even if I didn't carry much away with me afterwards.",1457481600,,1496,5.26890756302521

They need to resupply Matt ..so they build a rocket hastily and without ensue tin as time is of great importance..

7522098,5,B017S3OP7A,"I enjoyed the book but there were passages I skipped because, to be honest, I don't care exactly how many ounces of manure it takes to grow a potato.  There were times when I thought the author was tying to prove the story was possible, but since it was fiction I didn't see the need.

I figured the movie would be better and it is.  The story gets right down to business and while there is talk about doing the math and solving problems, little time is spent on actual calculations.  For example, the ""flight plan"" for the rescue mission is worked out by plugging a laptop into a super computer and bingo, it's done.

The movie skips other details in the book as well, but it sails along nicely and Matt Damon is prefect for the role.  Great story telling.",1457222400,,757,4.333333333333333

Loved the 'humanity', the humor, the acting and the heroic efforts by NASA, the JPL, and the astronauts to salvage a mission gone bad...with Science.---The cooperation with the Chinese space program was great.  I liked the 'reality' of Sean Bean's character, that even though he did what was 'right' to save the day, he was asked to tender his resignation because he challenged the director of NASA--politics still prevails where there is power, even in the movies.  :  (  Watched it twice back-to-back and still don't understand why Matt Damon, the writers, director and producers weren't nominated for more awards. Can't believe it was classified as a musical or comedy for the Golden Globes?  Really?  Great flic, with enough science and realism to keep us glued to our seats, and still laugh at the punch lines in the midst of peril.  So much more satisfying than Gravity.

From Robinson Crusoe to the post- apocalyptic survivor to cast away Tom Hanks, it's all about ingenuity, courage and the struggle between hope and despair. The Martian is Matt Damon's contribution. When he is left behind by his crew, presumed dead, the struggle begins. Performing surgery on himself, rationing his food, using his skill as a botanist to plant potatoes fertilized with. . . Well, let me just say that he is relentlessly inventive. And that, for me, was the joy of this film. Science. It's ALL about the racing imagination of the scientific mind. If this film does not inspire awe for the men and women who build and calculate and  survive, I don't know what will!

7522184,5,B017S3OP7A,"Almost 10,000 others have reviewed this sensational movie. I can't add too much but to say this....Matt Damon is GOD! this performance was one of his best and there are many that are spectacular. He did this part with pathos, humor and charm. His seems to be only part of the whole, we have his crewmen who accidentally left him behind and are planning a very dangerous way to go back and get him. The ground crews and NASA personnel are losing their minds to figure how to get him back. So all in all, we have three stories running simultaneously. Matt Damon is not the only performance of note either. Here we have one of those movies that has the right people in the right parts and they are all terrific. Amazing scenery and amazing acting and amazing writing and amazing direction all make for a nail biter. Are there slow times, sure but even they are amazing. Be aware though, the jargon and tech speak are just that very technical the very detailed. Matt Damon's humor is awesome.",1457222400,,988,4.4944444444444445

Astronaut isolated in perilous situation: check.

Astronaut engages in wisecracks despite peril: check.

Lots of Emmanueal Lubezki outer space scenes: check.

Daring space rescue with lots of spinning around and tethers and stuff: check.

Yes folks, what we have here is Gravity: Mars Edition.

I find it hard to believe that the director who gave us the film Gladiator is responsible for this.

It's a perfect demonstration of everything that's presently being done wrong in modern cinema. The actors all look like they're just pitching up on set to get paid, the emotion is completely and obviously insincere and plastic and the script appears to have been written by a team of sitcom writers.

In fact the script fundamentally compromises the potential seriousness of the story. You go for hardly a minute without a quip, a snark or some other forced humor that absolutely ensures that the film never ever goes beyond the superficial and touches on any genuine human emotions. It is possible to integrate humour into a serious story, but this requires pacing and placing the humour appropriately - if you put a laugh track over a serious scene, that scene won't feel serious.

At this point Matt Damon is also bordering on self parody. I felt like I was watching Matt Damon in a spacesuit, I don't even think I knew the astronaut's name at any point in the movie. This is almost identical to how Gravity presented us with George Clooney in a spacesuit playing every character he has ever played.

Hollywood is starting to get into a habit of churning out third rate, B-movie tier sci-fi and then hyping it up as something special. First Gravity, then Interstellar and now this. And the fact that the latter two were directed by very capable directors just adds insult to injury.

Don't expect anything at all of this movie and you won't be disappointed, but yet again it's just a forgettable piece of cinematic rubbish that panders to all the delusions of the current year.",1457136000,10,2009,4.811046511627907

7522275,4,B017S3OP7A,"One of the finest science fiction stories brought to screen. A few problems though. (Spoilers) Kristin Wiig's character claims confusion about the term ""Council of Elrond"" and seems befuddled by Tolkien references. For a film that prides itself of scientific accuracy, I find this dismaying. I defy you to find any white girl working NASA who does not know The Lord of the Rings backwards and forwards, own all the extended edition box sets, and harbor secret fantasies about one or more of the main characters. I'm not sure what Wiig is doing in this film in any case. Terribly miscast, sticking out like a sore thumb amongst better actors and cursed with a wardrobe seemingly made for another actress two sizes smaller and an ill conceived hairdo.",1456963200,,749,4.859375

7522281,5,B017S3OP7A,"For once in the past several years / decades Hollywood has managed to put out a movie that wasn't a prequel, sequel, remake, reboot or rehashed version of something that's already out.

Overall a good, interesting movie. Won't go into the story details as other reviews cover that very well... I'll just say that if Hollywood would produce more movies like this I'd actually go to the theater again. Waited for the release on Blu-ray and was surprised to see a movie that would have been enjoyable in the theater.

Not a huge amount of cursing but might want to watch it before sharing with pre-teens. (If I were marooned on Mars I'd be cursing too... The language isn't horribly gratuitous - it fits the movie & situation, but just be aware of it going in if you have young kids.)",1456963200,,781,4.531914893617022

7522333,5,B017S3OP7A,"If you have to be stranded on Mars, it's good if you're a botanist.

Though Matt Damon pretty much holds the movie-goer's attention as the astronaut injured in a storm and mistakenly thought dead and thus left behind, the others in the cast stand out well as the people working to bring him home.  There's the usual concern with NASA's public image when it's discovered they ""stranded"" a man on Mars, problems with chain-of-command in such cases--and the time factor...the tension and stress of trying to build a ship in the short time frame left and get it there before his supplies run out.

Everything proceeds in a linear fashion and there's little overt danger, other than being on a planet where one has to supply his own breathing material and can freeze at night if he doesn't starve to death.  Ingenuity is the key word here, with the strandee despairing of his predicament then perking up and meeting whatever problem headlong.  Kind of a ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" except that in this case, ""Friday"" isn't one man but an entire team working in his behalf. Everyone simply sees the problem and gets to solving it. When they fail, it's ""back to the drawing board"" and they start over, all with the clock ticking ominously.  Some viewers may have an argument with that, wanting roaring monsters to come leaping out of the sand, or bloody confrontations of some kind or other. The dogged way the astronaut and those on the ground meets each challenge with no histrionics may cause a few protests from those who want heavy dramatics. Perhaps this is really the way a trip to Mars would be. A lot of hard, steady work with the victory almost anticlimactic. Who can say?

In any event, the martian scenery created is breathtaking in its sandy, deserted starkness of red and ochre hues,. The space shots are equally awe-inspiring.

This is a truly beautiful film and one would hope it inspires many people to also read the book which I imagine goes into greater depth everyone's thoughts.",1456963200,,1990,4.714697406340058

The first hour of this had me interested, the rest had me asleep. This is the first movie where I can say it took me 5 tries to get through it to the end. Great for insomnia. Like ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar""  the end result is space trash. If Ridley Scott, who I also like, thought by infusing disco music into this stuff would help keep me awake, well it did not.  Scott has been a great director at times.  He is no where near as bad as Michael Bay or Jar Jar Abrams. In the end it helps me solve my sleeping issues.

The political and administrative wrangling was not as strongly depicted as I'd like, but the cast was in generally good--I liked it that the ""nerd"" heroes in the story was minorities, too.  But Matt Damon took the crown.  it reminded me a bit of ""Castaway"", same situation but in a more unforgiving environment; I loved the ""I'm not gonna die here"" resolution and attitude of the hero, because that attitude is the most important thing in a survival situation---it's not the macho heroics that saves your skin, but the willingness to think your way through, adapt, improvise, and never giving up.  The ending was a bit contrived, I thought, but I guess they thought they needed to add one last element of suspense.  I'd still recommend it to anybody who'll listen.",1456876800,,840,4.680272108843537

No seriously the book was great, and the movie was a pretty faithful adaptation. My biggest gripe was no mention of the lower gravity, but otherwise really good. Matt Damon is excellent, and re-reading the book imagining everything being said in his voice was in no way a bad thing.

The blu-ray is crisp, clean, and really well mastered.

And as with any other Ridley Scott movie, there's a boatload of viral marketing stuff that never makes its way into the movie and is delightful, like ""meet the astronauts"" videos supposedly produced by NASA, etc.",1456876800,,622,4.678899082568807

One feux pas in particular was that winds in Mars aren't strong enough to blow you away, and if they were, real physicists/engineers would make sure that the spacecraft and Mars station could handle it. The astronauts in the movie left pretty quickly after having spent billions of $$ and years on a different planet.

I also wonder if space-grade duct tape would really be effective enough to maintain earths level of air pressure.

But I disgress; that was just the first 5 minutes. Once Damon got abandoned the movie got really interesting.

The movie follows the themes of Andy Weir's excellent book of the same title, but many sections of the book did not make the screen.  The movie is ok with out them (though the bath tub heated by the RTG should have been in the film). Viewers that did not read the book will enjoy the movie none the less. The opening scene had me in tears, it was so beautiful. Buy an extra copy and donate it to the local junior high school and high school.  Inspire the kids to ""Science the S***"" out of what needs fixing on earth and around the solar system. Buy the movie and buy the book. It is a great read! Host a book club-movie night.

I just went to Google Play to check out the Google option and they too have a retarded system. I see what Paolo says about the content owners, but I do not give two hoots about the content owners. At the end of the day, it is Apple, Microsoft, Google or some other company which is licensing me the content. If they cannot be bothered to license me digital content with a plethora of language and subtitle options, well then I cannot be bothered to purchase the content. Either give me something which is a value proposition or shove it, and trust me there are plenty of other options for obtaining the content for free in the languages I want.

The companies involved, content producers and licensing re-sellers need to smarten up and improve their game or they will never attract customers like me. I have no problem paying for the content, but I will not buy or ""license"" a shoddy product which I cannot even view in its original language. NO NO NO. Wake up and smell the coffee that we live in a multi-language world where people are travelling and interacting with different cultures and languages more so than at any other time. E.g. I am British, living in Spain with a Brazilian girl friend. I want to watch stuff in English , she wants to watch stuff in Portuguese or at least with Portuguese or Spanish subtitles. The online options available from the three major companies are all pretty poor. Stop locking down language options, and make it easier for the customers to get the content they want and are willing to pay for. These language restrictions are dreamt up by retards at the content producers who have a scant understanding of the markets they are selling too.

Aside from that, the content producers currently have an oligopoly in place with the artificial licensing restrictions by country which stop us from playing our content whilst travelling etc., Again, this is a Kafkaesque system drawn up by idiots who have no understanding of what their customers actually want. The EU is slowly coming around to realising what these retards have put in place and there is talk of removing the license restrictions by country and creating a homogeneous EU zone. Bring it on. Then there will actually be proper competition in a more normal marketplace rather than the current artificial monstrosity which as users we currently suffer through.

Sadly, right now, Apple appears to have the ""best"" system in place for language optionality. Disappoint Google! Google and Android have the most open architecture and I would much rather have bought into the Google ecosystem for movies.

Since I refuse to tell spoilers for a movie like this.... I will say that Matt Damon carried this off beautifully.  You feel his emotions, his tragedies.. his loneliness and you will laugh out loud at some of his actions.  Drama and a bit of laughter ...  It has a good beginning.. a good ending and everything in between will keep you engrossed in the movie.

In my opinion the movie is suitable for all ages.. and even younger children would be able to understand most of the movie.. with possibley an explanation from time to time.

It's really good but for me, when I think of Mars, it's done in fantasy and my picture of what/how/where things would go isn't the same as this movie. It actually makes me feel, if this movie is based in any reality what so ever, that we are VASTLY under funded for a trip to space, and we're leaving A LOT of trash where ever we go. Do we want to be know  as ""THE LEAVES TRASH EVERYWHERE"", civilization? And seriously? Burying radioactive waste on Mars because it's too hot to handle?? That ruined this movie for me. I think that if we are able to travel to other planets, then we should be able to manage our waste. After all, it's completely arrogant to think that there may not be intelligent life. We've slaughtered entire species here on our planet but then figured out that they are intelligent. Remember whales? We, at this time in evolution have only ONE VIEW and it galls me when I hear scientists come to an absolute opinion based on an experiment done on EARTH that supposedly duplicates somewhere else in the Universe. It is good however, on how this character manages to save himself on Mars with what was left over. Oh whatever. Great movie for .... not me.",1456617600,,1278,4.3924050632911396

the rescue attempt and I became edgy and nervous; a real nail-biter of a situation.  Other than that, Mr Damon's character seems little fazed being
stranded on Mars; he copes well enough and is ingenious at surviving.  No tension at all there, no desperation, no great worry, he just keeps calm and carries on.

The problem is the movie itself. I'm a science fiction fan and I guess they were trying to make a movie based on a factual scenario and  what could really happen, so it's more true to real life than a ""science fiction"" movie.

But let's keep it real for a moment, there is no way the guy could live on potatoes for a year or more, much less a diet of 1/2 a potato a day. He would be in terrible condition from malnutrition and a host of other complications unless he had a ton of vitamins and other supplements to help him survive.  My opinion, he's be so weak from hunger (if he did last) he would be in no position to do all that work at the end of the movie.",1456531200,5,786,3.9872611464968153

Matt Damon, though he's messed up in the head with some of his views, makes this movie.  If not for him it would have bombed.

What's with females being captains to all the Martian expeditions?

In the movie Red Planet another woman is the captain.  In fact The Martian is like an extended version of being stranded on Mars.  It's like Red Planet.

Spoiler:

The captain decides to intercept Damon?  The man is stronger than her and she decides to take over instead.  A good leader always looks for the best soldier to do the job instead of seeking self-glory.  In this case, though, the possible loss of Watney.

It's great because if you don't have a 4K TV or/and 4K Blu-Ray player you can buy this and still watch it in 1080p then when you upgrade to 4K you don't have to double dip.

I was delightfully surprised by how engaging and well written the story is in TEXT, and couldn't wait to see the film adaptation. Well, thank goodness I read the book first, since I would've been really put off from the entire story if I had watched the film beforehand. As with lots of book-to-movie flips, many things were left out and / or altered in a way to expedite the storyline's pacing. Unfortunately, this means a lot of plot holes and critical character development flaws.

I urge anyone who hasn't read the book and only watched this movie to consider giving it a whirl. Mark is much more humorous and likeable, and the problems are much more interesting and complex.

7523218,4,B017S3OP7A,"THE MARTIAN (2015) starring Matt Damon as  Mark Watney, a botanist-astronaut stranded alone on Mars, is an enjoyable tale of resourcefulness and survival, largely akin to such recent films as GRAVITY (2013), starring Sandra Bullock, and ALL IS LOST (2013), starring Robert Redford. The roots of THE MARTIAN, of course, go back to Defoe's famous novel ROBINSON CRUSOE (1719) and the nearly forgotten science-fiction film ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS (1964), which was also about an astronaut stranded on a lifeless planet who solves where to get oxygen, water, and food.

Many scenes in this film successfully heighten our admiration for Watney, and many others are genuinely touching, such as when Watney's fellow astronauts (who assumed he was dead when they left Mars during a violent hurricane) learn many months later he is still alive and decide unanimously to return to Mars and rescue him.

The two objections I have about the plot are both concerned with the events that set the whole story in motion. First, I'm highly skeptical about the possibility of hurricane-force winds on Mars, including winds strong enough to tip over a rocket ship: the atmosphere of Mars seems to be far too thin for such a thing. Second, during the hurricane Mark Watney is injured by a flying piece of antenna that pierces his space suit. After his companions have left and he becomes conscious, he pulls out two pieces of metal rods from his abdomen and then fishes around inside the hole and removes a bullet-sized piece of metal. If (as appears likely) even one of these three metal objects had penetrated his intestine, peritonitis would certainly have resulted, and without professionally done surgery Watney would have died within four or five days. (I know this from my own similar first-hand experience with peritonitis.)

Fortunately for this film and for the audience, these plot-holes occur early and tend to be forgotten as the much more important meat-&-potatoes (yes, literally potatoes) scenes of the plot unfold.

All in all, this film is much more scientifically credible and psychologically enjoyable than either GRAVITY and ALL IS LOST. If I were giving it a letter grade, this film would receive a solid ""B+"".",1456444800,,2212,5.049315068493151

7523231,3,B017S3OP7A,"The Martian is a big-budget, near-future sci-fi flick, Matt Damon vehicle, with an easily recognizable supporting cast. Its built for box office, in other words, more than for credibility or contemplation. NASA has sent its third manned mission to Mars, which is expected to be on the Red Planet for 31 days. But the mission is cut short by a dust storm on the surface. Cdr. Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and several of the crew go outside the MAV during the storm, where botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is stuck by broken antenna, lost, and presumed dead. The crew is forced to take off without him, as the MAV is listing from the wind, and they rendezvous with the Hermes in orbit, which will take them back to Earth. Watney wakes after the storm to find that the antenna punctured but sealed the hole  in his suit. He returns to the habitat module (Hab) to tend to his injuries and to figure out how to survive on Mars until the next manned mission arrives, four years down the road.

The beginning of The Martian gives the impression of a man-against-the-elements survival film that will test Matt Damons ability to keep an audience rapt for 2 hours mostly by talking to himself, reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Cast Away (2000) or Sandra Bullock in Gravity (2013). Once the folks back on Earth have figured out that he is alive, it becomes a more conventional race-against-the-clock action flick, hopping between Watney on Mars to NASA officials on Earth to the crew of the Ares III en route from Mars to Earth. Its entertaining but not as interesting as watching Watney adapt to life on Mars. Any number of articles in the press address the accuracy or inaccuracy of the science in The Martian. Its less accurate than Gravity. But the many errors in logic will be more glaring to the average viewer. Its unclear why the crew was outside the MAV during the storm. Dont even try to plot the passage of time by Sols (Mars days) with events, as it will not add up.

The film was adapted from the 2011 science fiction novel of the same name by Andy Weir. Ridley Scott directs. Filmmakers could have paid more attention to continuity errors. Science is always stretched in science fiction, and the closer the fiction is to our own time, the more those liberties strain credibility. But writing a script without obvious inconsistencies is doable, if you try. Delicate-looking, honey-voiced Jessica Chastain is cast as the mission commander in an attempt to feminize that character, as she was in Zero Dark Thirty (2012), but Cdr. Lewis lacks leadership ability and has a weak personality, very unlike a NASA mission commander. Cdr. Lewis and her pilot Maj. Rick Martinez (Michael Pena) are supposed to be military, unlike the rest of the crew, but their behavior and demeanor are anything but. This kind of thing strains credibility and grated on my nerves more than bad science. Mars was interesting, even when inaccurate. The rest was not.",1456358400,6,2933,4.724609375

Matt Damon's take on the main character is actually much better than the book. Book Mark Watney has a much more childish sense of humor with all his ""yahs!"" and ""boos!"" Matt Damon gives him a more realistic (and enjoyable) wry, self-deprecating humor.

7523266,5,B017S3OP7A,"Much better movie than the Title or Description infers!!!  The movie has all the elements necessary to keep the interest of a broad range of ages.  Movie Critics rate everything other than what is valued by the general public.  Oscar winning movies were often box office flops, due to ratings by disconnected critics who are oblivious to subtle moral, social, or thought provoking scripts. They mirror those who miss the elements of life that a good actor can bring to life. Many movies will never be seen due to a critical rating by a person that represents a small segment of society. And while anything released in the Star Wars Saga are equally fun to watch, but hardly exhibit more than acceptable acting, and a storyline that is not much different from any of the prior scripts, which clearly demonstrates a clear bias based upon the Producer, Director, or just the endearment toward this timeless saga.  However, Accadamy Award Winning material??  That is clearly a leap. And yet, when combining the totality of George Lucas's work, it couldn't receive less than 4 stars. And The Martian, absent of a cult following in the tens of millions should receive 3.5 stars solely based on the movie as a whole. Granted, there were a few unnecessary minutes of dead time attempting to illustrate the passage of many months where simply stating "" 9 months later""  I think the majority of the audience oils by that point in the movie, empathize with his mental state after that long of time. But they didn't draw out 10 minutes of him suffering from boredom and isolation which was a result of a major failure of his well oiled system. Even the most positive battle disappointment from spend a year building and having 75% disappear in less than a minute. The more we dwell on our disappointment, the harder it is to regroup.. However, it's important to mourn the tragedy but then we must force ourselves to no longer dwell on what we can't change and force our minds to begin building a new solution. Otherwise, depression sets in and it's a downward spiral. Plus he had no one. And today the 1-5 steps always assume everybody has somebody.  The fact is, many don't so those who live in a vacuum within acadamia and determine what is normal, when faced themselves with  the same type of circumstances that create the same feelings of disappointment, RARELY follow their own advice and will suffer. And yet because they wear a badge of Acadamia as a Dr., it is assumed they are already practicing their own advice.  And therein lies the problem. Any Psychopath can attend Higher Ed and do the work receiving their Doctorate. They're still a Psychopath, however, the worship of Higher Ed automatically assumes that all who wear the label are the experts and those espousing common sense and are equally intelligent, however, it was the original group that set the bar.
I looked at one the other day, and they are 90% based on memory which you are born with, therefore genetic.  Those that have average memoriesare ranked with average intelligence.
Those with tremendous social skills receive no points. Those with creative skills and the ability to invent solutions actually need the group with Great memories to supply the information by which those with creative skills will use to find a solution. In addition, they can communicate it in a non-superior manner necessary for the masses to receive and understand it.
The good news is that he ancient IQ Test. needs destroyed and stop trying to create various qualifiers to attach to people which only divides us and limits our potential when all parties come together and supply all of the elements necessary. However, eliminating classes in the UK has never worked and the original American Settlers did away with class society, and simply called it something else. Today if a person gets up and communicates the most intelligent and reasonable solution. Before they finish the media will research their background that depending on whether they meet the criteria that determines credibility, will determine if what was initially spoken and made perfect sense, however, without that Suffix after their name, Everything said will be discounted for lacking the proper degree.  If you have the money and are reasonably intelligent, you will receive a Doctorite. Acadamia approves and the University system has received their cut. And that didn't come from me initially but by two individuals both accomplished and holding two Doctorates each.
Oddly, they rarely leave Acadamia, are horrible communicators but meet the definition of being an Authority.
I can name two practicing Doctors with God syndromes. Unable to hear from anyone with less credentials and yet given tremendous power and authority to destroy anyone who questions them. While their actions are off the wall, their Doctorate allows for any bizarre behavior while a patient gets angry and are determined to be adangerto themselves and others. Usually because they questioned one of societies gods.

7523354,5,B017S3OP7A,"I am not a rocket scientist.
Neither am I an astrophysicist.
I am, however, a storyteller. I spent nearly a half century as a journalist writing stories from across the United States and around the world. I've spent the past five years writing novels.
I note these things about myself because there may be scientists out there who find fault with this movie based upon their knowledge of the arcane. Because I am not one of those people, I can say without reservation that this is an excellent bit of storytelling with appealing characters, a well-constructed plot and a dynamic narrative. The special effects are nicely done without being overdone; there is not a weak link in the cast, and both the cinematography and the direction are flawless - at least to my untrained eye.
By now almost everyone knows that the movie - based upon Andy Weir's novel of the same name - revolves around a lone astronaut stranded upon Mars when his crew mates, believing him to be dead and in great peril themselves, leave the Red Planet without him. His effort to survive in that extremely harsh environment is a study in ingenuity and courage. Matt Damon, as the stranded astronaut, is wonderful in the part. He brings the right amount of wry humor, frustration, and hope to the role. In the parlance of an earlier time, he has the ""right stuff"" to survive.
But this is not just Matt Damon's movie.
Jeff Daniels, as the head of NASA, is also excellent as the administrator who must balance budgets and public relations with the realities of space travel. Sean Bean, Jessica Chastain and the rest of the cast perform admirably.
This movie is full of action but what makes it special, I think, is the story itself. On the surface, it's an adventure but beneath that surface lies a story that speaks of loyalty, friendship, and the fact that there are people willing to make great sacrifices to do the right thing. I especially like the scene in which the crew that abandoned Damon's character on Mars votes to put themselves and their careers at risk in order to retrieve him.
As I said, scientists may find fault with this movie.
As a storyteller, however, I cannot.",1456099200,,2152,4.66578947368421

7523360,1,B017S3OP7A,"While this movie was 1000x better than Gravity, it's just another in the line of the dumbing down of the American populace.  Look, there are 4 kinds of sci-fi movies: one which is futuristic/fantasy, and you can give a pass to whatever kind of technologies they come up with, like Star Wars/Star Trek.  The 2nd is just the outrageous kind, who don't take themselves seriously, like Armageddon.  Armageddon laughs at itself, and we're all in on the joke.  It's just a fun movie.  The 3rd is more documentary, such as Apollo 13.  They try to stay really close to the truth.

The Martian is the fourth:  Fiction, but they pretend to be a serious movie.  I lump things such as 2001/2010 into that group.  However, the Martian is just God Awful at doing it.  If you're going to enter this genre, you better have your science down, and the Martian fails at 5th grade science.  While I can certainly give a pass on some things, like the sound of spaceships flying by (2001/2010 did this right) there are some things which cannot be overlooked (possible spoilers ahead):

Damon's character (a botanist, by the way) builds a water collection device, and it flames out in front of him, blowing him back.  Damon surmises that he didn't account for the excess *oxygen* he has exhaled since being there...  Yeah, he said Oxygen.

After the hatch blows out in his garden, he repairs it, with *plastic and duct tape*, even though they keep showing that the internal pressure of his living quarters is around 12 PSI. Oh, and the plastic flaps in the Martian wind.  Let's see, about a 4' wide hatch, at 12 psi.  Let see 1809 sq in.  or about 21 tons of pressure on the plastic.

When he's leaving, he has to get rid of a bunch of extra weight on his ship, including the 400kg nose cone, which he easily unbolts and pushes off.  Apparently Damon is superman.  Then he replaces the nose cone with this SuperPlastic(TM) that he repaired the hatch with.  WTF.

The stupidity of this movie grows with me the more I think of it.",1456099200,6,2005,4.520891364902507

------
I could not wait for the movie to hit the rentals so I went ahead and read the book first.

They did an excellent job of following the structure and feel of the book. Each scene was played out well enough that you didn't have to guess what they were doing.

 Including most of the potty mouth; this is not necessary and distracted from the movie with maybe one or two exceptions such as where he broadcasts a negative word throughout the world.

The acting was excellent the seams were spectacular Mars never looked more real. The technology was very close to real; you will not find yourself saying thats impossible.

The big issue is that all that wonderful inner dialog (with the science, math, and humor) from the book is (by necessity) missing from the movie.  Still, the movie is well worth watching.

7523430,4,B017S3OP7A,"Love the movie, but wish they would have stayed closer to the book, particularly during the rescue sequence.  The switch up there might have added some drama, but it didn't require the captain going out.  They just wanted an expensive actress to have more face time, rather than the lesser known players. Still quite a good movie, but too many changes from the book for my taste.",1456012800,,379,4.641791044776119
7523431,4,B017S3OP7A,Ridley Scott dropped the ball (big time) on this movie. The Martian could have been a humongous financial hit if the director had focused on the human emotion of loneliness. Note: the astronaut is left behind by his crew and stranded on Mars to face imminent death . . . ALONE!!!

7523440,1,B017S3OP7A,Contrived.... that's the word that fits just about every gripe I have with this film in the time I wasted watching it.  The plot - predictable and contrived every step of the way.  Don't wait for a big surprise or mind-twist.  This film isn't about your mind.  It's about special effects and a contrived plot and contrived crises and contrived character interactions to facilitate those really good special effects.  The science is pretty much completely missing.  Every life-saving idea is based on marginal reality.  The final scenes are like a rush to the old-time idea box with new special effects toys to make them plausible.... and still it fails.  There's no way 90% of these crisis moments and solutions could EVER play out. The science is just that flawed.  One Badly strung together film!,1456012800,24,798,4.895522388059701

7523449,5,B017S3OP7A,This is the type of movie I like to watch a few times over.  Matt Damon does a great job.  I felt as though I was really there with him because I was able to identify with him.  Some may argue that it was unrealistic due to the humor Watney exhibited but I think this is exactly what helped him get through the ordeal. No matter what difficult tasks we may face in our lives or how bleak the outcome may seem if we can't maintain some degree of lightheartedness or humor then in our hearts we've already given up and we're as good as lost.  I'd like to believe that I would have reacted as Watney did in his situation.,1455926400,,618,4.082644628099174

7523518,3,B017S3OP7A,"Its been years since I've written an Amazon review, so this is a first for me in a long time. I'm writing because I honestly don't get what all the hoopla is with this movie.
I found the movie to be very techie in nature, and fast moving to a point that I was confused by who was who what was happening. I'm sure others were acutely tuned to the movie and their adrenaline was moving quickly as they were riding the writer's roller coaster scenes that kept moving so fast, only people keenly interested in that speed would enjoy.

Matt Damon is a very bright man with an exceptionally high IQ, so he pulled off the ""Botanist"" role convincingly, but I think this was way below his acting abilities. it was nothing like his role in Good Will Hunting with another very bright actor, Robin Williams.

I fell asleep towards the last third of the movie, and had to ask the wife what exactly took place and what was the Chinese role in all this. I confessed to her that while I was watching this movie, I kept wishing I could be watching a nice slow western movie without all the fast moving scenes that confused me with all the techie lingo.

 Finally, my suggestion to this production is, ""you better get out of town by sundown pardner""!",1455840000,,1232,4.366812227074236

Modern techniques made many of the weightless scenes much more convincing.  However, the recurring storms on ""Mars"" very very difficult to swallow; because of the thinness of the atmosphere, storms will contain very little energy.  Winds require particles actually colliding.  The particles of the Martian atmosphere will be hard put to propagate pressure waves, as required by a storm.  But, if one can suspend belief, it is a wonderful story.  The writing was very good throughout.

7523627,5,B017S3OP7A,"My husband and I really enjoyed this move.  Although the description seems far-fetched, the problems that the characters face are realistic and believable.  There isn't any violence either, which is a nice change from an lot of more recent action movies.",1455753600,,254,5.170731707317073

7523629,5,B017S3OP7A,"Very good production of a great novel. Writing, acting, directing, and set design were all outstanding. Everyone should watch this to understand how science is so advanced.........but only works when the human brain and spirit is involved.",1455753600,,239,5.486486486486487

7523631,5,B017S3OP7A,"An amazing and thrilling movie, and probably the most realistic depiction of the possibilities and risks of human exploration of Mars ever made.

7523634,5,B017S3OP7A,"I rented this movie through Amazon Video and it stream at SD.  I viewed the movie through a Samsung Smart TV.  The Audio and visual quality of the streamed movie I would rate 10/10.  I was able to easily order the movie through my TV with ease.

I really enjoyed this movie, I am not a huge fan of Matt Damon, but he pulled this role off really well.  This is totally a Sci-fi genre, so if you are not really into this genre you might not really enjoy the idea of space exploration and colonization of Mars.",1455753600,,507,4.13265306122449
7523635,1,B017S3OP7A,"I had high hopes that this would be a great movie because of the subject matter. Instead it turned out to be one of the worst movies I ever saw. It actually looks like it was made awful on purpose. I had to force myself to keep watching because I thought it would finally get better, but it only got worse. Here is a guy stranded on Mars listening to disco music and generally smiling and having a great time. I am amazed at just how silly the whole movie was. This is one movie I never want to watch again. Utter nonsense with terrible acting.",1455753600,14,544,4.1415094339622645

So, I watched the movie instead, but found it to be lack-luster. Matt Damon really made the film - Without him, it wouldn't have been worth watching! Just being honest.",1455667200,,296,4.2105263157894735

It is a story of the power of a mans will, smarts and tenacitiy and the will of his friends and even the world to help him back home.

The story line didn't immediately sound appealing to me and I'm not a huge Matt Damon fan (but I don't dislike him either).  However, it got great reviews and I had some Prime video credits to use so I figured why not.  It was especially nice because I was able to watch streaming through my TV using my Amazon Fire Stick.  I'm so used to watching movies on my laptop or iPad, it was nice being able to watch this on the ""big"" screen.  Anyway, it was a great movie, loved it!",1455667200,,531,4.166666666666667

7523844,5,B017S3OP7A,"This movie, is solid gold as far as Space Adventures go.

If your the type of person who like's to see your actors get eaten by aliens and mother nature poop on them,
this is not the movie for you. IF you want to see an astronaut M.Watney take a poop on fate itself.. then this movie is for you!

Mark Watney gets knocked down hard in this wild ride, but he gets back up and hits just as hard, and keeps a sense of humor the entire time, I secretly think Dead Pool is really Mark Watney.

This isn't any fairy tell, but its one good sci-fi movie to watch! Why is it so good? It gives hope about the potential abilities of humanity to reach toward the stars. It shows we will probably get burned in the process. It shows, that we have to be prepared and think on our feet, because the frontier isn't a game.  And pussy footing around will get us no where.

I read the book first, and by read I mean devoured.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Martian/dp/0553418025/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Martian</a>
So when the movie was gearing up to come out.. I was both excited and nervous. Because with Hollywood things either go, really good, or really bad. (The movie 'The Last Apprentice' based off these books&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Soul-Stealer-The-Last-Apprentice-Book-3/dp/0060766263/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Soul Stealer (The Last Apprentice, Book 3)</a>) is horrid but poignant example.

It's all down to earth is what I think is the big draw about this movie. The only thing I would say that is really ""Out there"" is basically the response time of bureaucracy agencies involved... they move way too fast.

IF you want another awesome Space movie to watch after this, check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Interstellar/dp/B00TU9UO1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Interstellar</a>

No hidden agenda just a good movie that highlights how special astronauts have to be. The funny thing is I am not a NASA nut or sci-fi Trekky- I can only imagine what people in the field think.,1455580800,,331,4.442622950819672

7523863,5,B017S3OP7A,"As a frustrated ""astronaut wannabe"" it is difficult for me to find a space-themed flick that will make me want to watch it from beginning to end without rolling my eyes, getting antsy and start looking at my watch.  In the last forty years, only a few movies of such genre kept me interested: THE RIGHT STUFF was glorious.  MAROONED was right on the money and so was APOLLO 13.  CAPRICORN ONE'S premise was mind-blowing (regardless of OJ Simpson being in the cast). GRAVITY was pretty good.  ARMAGEDDON was kinda cheesy but fun to watch, so was SPACE CAMP (that one with extra cheese). The obscure STOWAWAY TO THE MOON was beyond cheesy but I loved it (I was 8 years old back then).  APOLLO 18? I walked out of the theater.

THE MARTIAN is a great exception and a very pleasant surprise.  To be honest, the first think I thought when I heard about the movie was ""oh, please... not another movie about MY FAVORITE MARTIAN.""  Thankfully, it isn't.

The premise is very credible and people can relate to it even if they have no interest in space travel. Think of Cast Away but 33 million miles away and with no food and no oxygen to last the year it would take NASA to get Matt Damon back (if it was Ben Affleck, I would insist they left him there).

The movie is beautifully shot, as could be expected from any Ridley Scott film. The script is smart and even funny in some parts (the movie actually won a Golden Globe as comedy..huh???).  The cast is simply outstanding, particularly Michael Pea (who you might remember from Oliver Stone's World Trade Center as the other cop who dug out from the rubble.  Visual effects were amazing and most importantly, CREDIBLE.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1455580800,2,1702,4.451612903225806

7524001,3,B017S3OP7A,"3 stars for bringing a rather whimsical layered story to the screen with not too many cliche changes. Matt Damon's charm brings it one level up. Those cliche changes and inevitable sacrifices to the story keep it from reaching greatness. This is a very watchable and charming movie, well acted, well directed. However, this is a lesser, mainstream take on an original story. A lot of original book's off-beat charm and understated humor is lost, characters aren't as defined and diverse, and complexity of the situation is rather skimmed over. Some sacrifices are inevitable, in my opinion, this book is hard to turn into a movie, but the result is more of a glossy Hollywood mainstream dumbed down flick than a warm, charming, witty story of perseverance, hope and better human nature. Read a book, watch the movie. Both are worth the time, and the book definitely gives you a layer or two to chew through and enjoy it thoroughly.",1455580800,,931,4.825

7524116,2,B017S3OP7A,Admittedly I'm not a huge fan of these types of movies.  I didn't hate it but I definitely did like it either.  The plot is okay but there are enough annoying plot choices that don't make it suspenseful.

I think some gripping, edge of the readers seat crises, probably had to be eliminated. Also shortened was some of the amazing solutions devised by the protagonist. I thought the mother ship commander role was miscast to provide eye candy and not a believable female astronaut. Matt Damon was consistently believable and well cast.

The first 30 to 40 minutes were fine, then the picture broke up with people looking like they were covered in foil and odd things moving across the screen.  After watching for a few minutes, we decided to start and reload the DVD - this cleared up the immediate scenes, and everything was fine for about 15 minutes when it happened again.  Reloaded again and moved on.  The end result was that it took 3 1/2 hours to see about 3/4 of the DVD in a very unsatisfying manner.

This is the first DVD we have ever purchased which is defective, and as a regular customer, I expected to have it replaced by Amazon.

This is a superb movie: great acting, great script, great directing, and really great cinematography (along with the exceptional special effects). Matt Damon is at his best as a mature actor, and the story is compelling (thank you, Andy Weir).

I enjoy science fiction adventure, and got a few kicks out of the latest in the Star Wars franchise (although Disney's latest addition is more violent than the original ones), but I'd much rather see more stories and films like this one, where there is a hopeful outcome if people just work the problem. And that is the basic ""message"" of this film: that people can succeed in space in spite of horrendous odds against them, and that they should.

I also think NASA should send copious amounts of duct tape on any future manned mission to space.",1455494400,,942,4.773006134969325

7524403,4,B017S3OP7A,"Fairly solid and engaging, with excellent effects and acting, but there are two points that hold the movie back.  The first is its relatively simplistic plot.  It turned out nearly as I expected it would, given the commencement, and so I was not surprised by any development.  That said, originality cannot always be expected, granted.  Actually, perhaps I liked the recent ""Interstellar"" better, or even go back to 1999's ""Contact"". Nevertheless, this still a very good Sci-Fi.

The second negative is that there was poor use and understanding of the principles of physics, which is always in true science fiction, and to which this movie unquestionably aims.  This becomes increasingly evident as the movie goes on.  For instance, the spaceship Hermes: it had a cylindrical shell which was supposed to impart gravitational effects to the inhabitants thereof.  However, as it was designed, this would have proved impossible.

There was good use of 1970s disco ... !",1455494400,,966,5.141025641025641

I definitely recommend the book -- then the movie, in that order.",1455494400,,396,4.116883116883117

The plot line is simple. Survive. Without Damon's performance, that made you pull for the extremely likable botanist with a long sciencey to-do list, this movie would have been a long chore to watch. Similar examples are in other recent space tales Gravity and Interstellar. Both movies I would not rewatch. The Martian, I absolutely would. This movie will bog down in real science on occasion, but always makes it clear what it's discussing. Another impressive portion of this movie is dedicated to a lengthy list of notable actors in supporting roles.

A rocket with supplies was sent up by the Chinese when Americans had a rocket to launch into earth's orbit. So it goes with many movies, the movie needs to have a Chinese twist to increase sales in China, I get that. This should have been done with more subtlety. So no award for editing. But other than that it works for me. A very watchable movie, great twists and suspense. But I think movies like this should be labeled Chinese American and not American.

But once the storm was over and Matt Damon's character (Mark) was left on the planet alone, this movie really took off and became really interesting!  It was full of drama and constantly had me gripping the armrests of my seat when things were happening and I was totally rooting for Mark to make things work and for him to make it off of Mars alive and back to Earth.

There aren't any space battles or aliens in it, and there isn't really any fighting in it other than verbal sparring between characters on Earth.  It really is a story about a man's will to survive and how he used his training and ingenuity to make his environment a place where he can survive in.

7524423,3,B017S3OP7A,"Not all, but quite a few of Matt Damons' past roles are of a self aware actor who portrays a narcissistic character, ""unlikable"" at times, but  also ""criminally intelligent"". Examples include ""The Bourne Legacy"" series, Ocean 11 series, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Good Will Hunting, True Grit, Rounders & The Departed. I wonder if his life imitates his career.  I am a huge Sci Fi fan, but the idea of Matt Damon taking up space in this new genre, for him, made me think twice about renting this movie. Of course, The Martian, being a well received book, I decided to take a risk.  Matt Damon portrays an astronaut in Mars, part of a research team, who through a series of mishaps leave Damon stranded alone on Mars. He sets about acclimating to his environment & surroundings. He becomes very resourceful in utilizing sometimes personal and available resources to survive.... MacGyver style.

There was more effort and time poured into altering the ending, and victimizing Mark Watney, than making him the hero he was in the book. I understand that so much internal monologue and science is difficult to portray, but there were so many options and opportunities to do so. Major parts of the book (such as the Pathfinder/drill and the hab airlock scene) are just glazed over. Everything is all too easy, and the depth and wry humor of Watney's character are completely lost. While it is scenic and does have a few really strong moments, the complete alteration of the last 20 minutes, make it a film I wish I never saw, and an insult to Andy Weir's great book.",1455408000,,794,4.482758620689655

Was concerned about the PG13 but then read up that (aside from a naked butt) it was mostly language (an early round of ""S--T"" worthy of a South Park counter and a few f bombs which my son said went beyond the ""13"").  I told him if he was stranded on Mars, he could curse too but until then, no. This could've gotten a PG without that so I dinged a star. It's full of problem solving and resilience which were great lessons for my ""six going on sixteen"" year old who tried to follow along with his own ideas. Highly recommend.

The story has a nice blend of action and suspense and mixes in some humor to elevate some the tension within the movie.  The humor that is in the movie is light and really doesnt take away from the sci-fi dramatic action that is the movies focus.  The Mars landscape is bleak but beautifully done and looks realistic giving the feeling of loneliness and desolation.  The special effects both on Mars and in space are also nicely done.  The story seems to be based in science which gives it a plausible feel; although at times I am sure the science is bent a bit at times to match the drama of the story and the ending has a been there done that kind of feeling to it.  Matt Damon is one of my favorite actors and he does a good job in the role with both his blend of humor and ability to make the character likeable.  Although the story isn't perfect, this sci-fi movie has a good blend of action, tension, humor that is entertaining and worth watching.

I don't believe in spoilers, yet this movie has been out long enough for anyone reading reviews about it will pretty much figure out the plot and the juicy parts of it. I will, however, say I really hate how film directors re-generate the ""generational"" bridge as if movie audiences haven't advanced in their expectations of movie soundtracks.

Every song that Matt Damon's character (Mark Watney) listened to while on Mars (heck, he was even watching Happy Days for crying out loud!!!) spawned the time period of the 60's - 70's. I cannot believe that Ridley honestly believes people are supposed to buy that every American or moviegoer is listening to disco or oldies during a time when America should be progressive in terms of entertainment choice, not always reliving the ""good ol' days"" during space exploration. It's ironic that seems to always occur in films about the future lately. Albeit, this was Commander Lewis' music collection, but movies sure have a way of shoving the iconic fabric down your throat I got mildly irritated at hearing the soundtrack in this film.

With that said, Matt Damon makes this film go!!! I've always liked his movies, though, as of late, he hasn't put out many powerhouses (not his fault, if you ask me) but he redeems himself with this one. It captures the spirit of determination, exploration, science (get your STEM game up people!) and hope as well as some natural human emotion that shows how hard it can be at times to just hold on to hope even when there's little left.

He made you a believer in him and that's why he's my hero!

7524498,5,B017S3OP7A,"Movie Review

 If you are into sci-fi movies, dramas, or comedies then the movie The Martian may be for you. This movie has an intense storyline that will make you want to root for Matt Damons character and ensures that youll have laughs along the way. I had seen previews for this movie before buying the DVD thinking that it looked like an alright movie, but it far exceeded those expectations. I am not typically one to love sci-fi movies, but The Martian was so well-done that I couldn't help but love it. This movie is about a man, Mark Watney, who gets accidentally left behind on Mars during a crazy storm and who now has to survive. I don't want to give anything else away about the movie so it is ruined.
 The cast was excellent. The obvious big name actor was Matt Damon who portrayed Mark Watney perfectly by being the kind of guy that everyone enjoys with a good sense of humor. There were a few other actors and actresses that I recognized from other movies I had seen before, but could not remember their names. Overall, the movie had a stellar cast with great acting as well as awesome directing done by Ridley Scott.

Blue-ray DVD Qualities and Features

 Buying the movie on blue-ray DVD couldn't have been a better decision. It gives the option to watch the movie in 3-D. Watching the movie in 3-D was like a whole new experience, which you do not want to miss out on. With explosions and journeys around mars you feel like you are right there with Mark Watney due to the amazing effects and features. The film is fairly long clocking in at 144 minutes in length. Though some people may feel that a movie that is almost two and a half hours long is not what they are looking for, I can assure that it is well worth watching the entire way through and that it will keep your attention. If anything the lengthy movie just means that you are getting more for your buck. Buying the DVD is great because you get to see the special features along with receiving an excellent picture and great sound due to the Blue-Ray DVD enhancements. When ordering The Martian off of Amazon I received it right when the delivery date claimed it would be delivered and it showed up in great condition. I would most definitely recommend ordering a DVD from Amazon and consider it to be well worth the $14.99 price I paid for it.",1455235200,,2324,4.418224299065421

7524506,5,B017S3OP7A,"I had heard both the good and bad reviews about this movie, but I'm one of those people that needs to make a personal assessment. I ended up renting this movie before ordering it, as I do with most movies I purchase. I will say this, it will do you wonders if you decide to watch this movie without any expectations and blindly.

I wasn't really sure about the whole story line and decided not to get too many details about the movie prior to watching it. Therefore, I will not reveal anything of the movie, so that you can make up your own mind.

I will say this, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I'm a pretty picky guy when it comes to them. I love drama and action along with some comedy and this movie has all of them. Matt Damon does a spectacular job in this film and the storyline, for the most part, is not drawn out or boring. There was only one drawn out scene and if it wasn't so intense, I would've been bored. Instead, it was just a bit hard to watch for a couple of minutes.

Overall, a great movie that will have you laughing. No, this is not the Wedding Ringer or Aliens. However, if you're a fairly smart person, love suspense and not too over the top comedy, then this is the movie for you.",1455235200,,1210,4.140425531914894

  - ""Ares III: Our Greatest Adventure""
  - ""Ares III: Farewell""

This garbage is just further kool-aid for the masses to keep them drunk with stupidity. If they actually used the five senses that god gave them and engaged their brain without being distracted by mindless twitter posts then perhaps they will see a glimpse of the real truth.

Reality is not what we think it is. It's much simpler and more wondrous than anything Mr Riddle-Diddle Scott can produce from his pea-brained mind.",1455235200,6,877,4.7254901960784315

The other cast are stellar as well, led by Jeff Daniels back on Earth keeping control of the team as each development arises.

This movie feels like it was a ""What If "" type of scenario or task that was given to a bunch of N.A.S.A scientist and a select group of survivalist who were asked to figure out how a group or one Astronaut could survive on Mars or other planets if they were marooned or their Lift Off vehicle failed.
I cannot go into the movie in detail because I do not want to ruin it for those of you who may want to watch it, but I will tell you this,  Matt Damon does a very good job of coming up with solutions on how to survive for 10+ months until help can arrive and pulls some real Inspector Gadget type moves to supplement his food and water supply and ingenious ways to reestablish contact with N.A.S.A back on earth.",1455148800,,1017,4.157360406091371

7524560,5,B017S3OP7A,"Ill be honest, I had not heard much about THE MARTIAN before renting it. I expected it to be another boring Martian mission movie ala RED PLANET. But this movie was nothing like that dud. My first clue was that the film was produced and directed by Ridley Scott, and frankly, I don't believe the man has ever made a bad movie. Second clue should have been that it stared Matt Damon, and frankly, I don't think he has ever stared in a bad movie either. It contains stunning FX, drama, intrigue and suspense, all of which would have made it a good movie. But what makes this a GREAT movie is the element of human perseverance. This almost plays out as a true story, and indeed, it does have elements of the true story of Apollo 13. The movie shows human integrity, intuition, bravery, adaptability, strength, compassion, ingenuity and loyalty. And, like the story of Apollo 13, those human attributes and a whole lot of duct tape can always save the day. Im almost glad that I didn't see it in a theater because Id have embarrassed myself by applauding out loud at the ending. An outstanding film, and an outstanding story.

7524624,4,B017S3OP7A,"Hearing the premise for the Martian, I thought to myself ""abandoned on Mars? that sounds so depressing"". I was wrong. There are many artful moments of levity. Rescuing Matt Damon again turns out to be a worthwhile endeavor. Great acting by a populous cast (no, you will not be watching poor sad Matt Damon all by his onesies on Mars for 2 hrs), beautiful effects, I guess it'd get the 5th star in my book if it got just a little more bleak sometimes. There is a relentless optimistic outlook, and I'd think there'd at  least be a few times when the main character would mentally collapse and give up. (I realize this would be in opposition of the major theme here, but overcoming an onset of hopelessness would only add to the power of a man determined to survive. Arguably)",1455062400,,774,4.48936170212766

7524684,5,B017S3OP7A,"An exciting and informative film. A must-see for any space enthusiast and supporters of the space program.

The film follows a NASA astronaut and his determined quest for survival while stranded on Mars. Matt Damon does an amazing job bringing his character to life while the film itself makes the viewer believe that this is really the red planet and not a Hollywood soundstage. NASA's efforts to save their stranded man is also believable and gives much deserved credit to the NASA personnel left behind on Earth and their role in NASA's success. The ultimate solution to the problem has some nice surprises and twists and the film's ending leaves the audience satisfied.

The science used in the film is as accurate as a movie can hope to get making this movie not just for popcorn movie audiences but for scientists and NASA supporters alike. 'The Martian' will inspire its audience and will hopefully remind the nation why NASA is worth the investment.",1454976000,,957,4.865030674846626

Matt Damon delivers a very strong performance. You can feel his emotions as they rollercoaster from highs to lows throughout the film. This film is a sci fi drama with some appropriate humor interjected along the way. A good family flick. No overt sexuality or gratuitous foul language. Only one brief shot of rear view full body nudity; used to illustrate the extreme weight loss of the stranded astronaut.

I think all these and more were portrayed realistically.  This was not a drama movie yet contained a lot of drama and none of it cheesy or unreasonable.  It was a good look into our possible future and a good look into human nature.  I would recommend this for my children and my parents, if they were still living.

You could tell that the author really did his research to be sure what he wrote was accurate.  That is a huge testament to the author.  He really did a great job on that respect. However, there are a few things that make me give it 4 stars instead of 5.

Reason 1, the characters on Earth, really didn't seem to make much sense.  Their reactions to things seems over the top.  It felt very much like a script, which is probably why the film did so well.  I am sure that the characters on Earth had a connection to the ones in space, but we as readers don't have that mutual compassion so it felt very unnatural.  I often sped read those sections because it just did not seem like a normal human response.

Reason 2, the book just ended.  He gets rescued and then it just ended.  There was nothing afterwards.  We as readers need something to finish on.  Just because the climax is over does not mean that the entire story is over.  We need closure.  This is the main reason why I didn't give the book 5 stars, because the author didn't follow all the laws of writing.

At least he didn't kill the guy. ;)",1454803200,,1279,4.210743801652892

Matt Damon's character is charming, witty, and funny. His character always managed to pick the movie up in a very light-hearted, and often times humorous way. There was also a great combination of supporting actors that each contributed in their own way into the movie. (So don't worry, you won't be stuck watching only Matt Damon for almost 2.5 hours straight.) You get some solid performances from Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Pea (funny yet again), Jessica Chastain and so many others in the supporting cast. It interesting and enjoyable to see how the movie almost seemed like two different movies in one. The first being Matt Damon's experiences on Mars, and the other being the rest of the characters on earth attempting to bring him home. The film also did a good job of bringing a level of science that would appease die hard sci-fi fans, but still make things relatable for the average person.

The Bad:

There are some times when this film can get a little too ""sciencey"". There were times where I found myself getting lost in the detailed, technical explanations during some of the scenes. (Luckily they had visual demonstrations to help it all make sense.) In a strange way, this movie never really hit any highs or lows. It's not a boring movie at all, but the suspenseful moments weren't going to get you on the edge of your seat, nor were the sad moments going to have you watery-eyed.

The Reason:

The best way to describe this movie is Castaway + Gravity (Click for my previous review). If you were thinking that this movie was just a copy of Interstellar, I can tell you now, it's definitely not that. (However, there is one scene that is ridiculously similar to a scene in Interstellar.) While Interstellar was similar to sitting in on a 3 hour university lecture on quantum physics, The Martian is like your high school science class with that cool teacher who made science fun. Overall, The Martian is a scientific adventure that will give you a warm fuzzy feeling inside. It will be shown in 3D, and there are two scenes in the beginning and the end that I do feel make the 3D worthwhile. I think it's more than worth the watch in theaters.

The Rating: 8.0/10

7525119,5,B017S3OP7A,definitely a 5-star movie. I enjoyed every minute of it and I am not really a big space movie fan. The acting was superb not to mention the flawless writing made this movie truly enjoyable and a definite buyer sometime soon.,1454803200,,224,4.487804878048781

7525121,1,B017S3OP7A,"Had such high hopes for this film as the reviews were so good. Now I am left feeling like I'm living on a different planet. Perhaps all of the good reviews came from martians because this movie stunk as badly as the human excrement Damon used to plant his potatoes. The directing was so horribly contrived as though Ridley Scott thought he was playing to an audience of 6 year olds. Clearly Ridley Scott knows nothing about the science of space. And the gym on the space craft? What an absolute joke. Has Ridley Scott watched the YouTube videos of actual astronauts exercising in space? Totally predictable, unrealistic and over done Hollywood rubbish. I wish I could get those 2 hours 24 minutes of my life back. Awful.",1454716800,16,720,4.6328125
7525122,2,B017S3OP7A,"Preposterous science mixed with an unemotional and lifeless secondary cast and this movie just doesn't fly very far for me. Damon is good but even most of the humor generated by him falls flat. And once again the day is saved by a millennial...sigh.

Relax, I always seem to dislike all these movies that everyone else is whipped into a frenzy over.. Frozen also.

If you want to see a decent movie check out Love and Mercy.",1454716800,,424,4.4935064935064934

7525125,4,B017S3OP7A,"If this were a 7 star scale, I'd give it a 6, but alas we only get 5 stars, and it's not so great to get the grand slam. So as a sci-fi fan I'd say the movie does a good job of keeping it real while allowing some wiggle room for suspension-of-disbelief. It really does try to stay within reason, and any of the questionable things are trivial that only folks like Neil Degras Tyson would bother to mention, and even he would probably enjoy the film... because he is able to get past that crap, and so should you.... It's a great film, and it's pretty decent in the 3D version that I ordered. The stereoscopic effect was not too pronounced, actually quite conservative, which is nice. The effects ""popped"" at the right times, and never did I have to stop and be cognizant that 3D glasses are being worn, so just enjoy the feature film. Matt Damon is of course playing the role quite well, and honestly it would be hard to screw up, but it's nice to have an A actor to watch. Lets be honest here the acting is either not a big deal here for the plot, or the acting was SO good I was tricked into thinking that way. Well, regardless the movie deserves some major respect towards the special effects, this stuff really helped carry the film, along with great writing.  Wold I watch it again, yeah... maybe once or twice in my life time.",1454716800,,1332,4.264822134387352

The story itself is a great one, Man against the incredible hostility and expanse of space.  The movie was unique in that there were no ""bad guys"", instead is was humanity coming together in a single purpose, to save one man against impossible odds. It is very uplifting and shows Humanity at its best.

Visually stunning, strong story line, good dialogue and characters, a number of LOL moments in a crisis situation, great sound track.  This is the best science fiction movie I have seen in many years and one I will watch again repeatedly.

The story line is also tired.

As a fan of the book the movie sucks to the point of zero stars.  They gutted the book completely.  I laughed all the  way through the book and love the characters jokes and humor.  Almost all of that is gone from the movie and the few jokes they did try to put in were done in a way that didn't translate well.  There is no humor or laughter in this movie. There are always places in book to movie adaptions that things need to be changed to accommodate the medium but this changes parts of the book included dialogue that just has no reason to be changed.

Matt Damon's character is pretty one dimensional although there were some good scenes.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if they would have developed even one character or relationship a little further.  It was just a lot of one liners and scenes of the actors being weightless.

I read the book a year before the movie's release was announced, and can say with 100% confidence that it's the best sci-fi book I've ever read. The movie follows the book VERY closely, but for obvious time constraints, wasn't able to go into the depth of detail that the book has. That was probably my only disappointment with the content.

I enjoyed the fact that the film essentially takes place place in present day, there's not really anything that would be a stretch of the imagination.

7525340,4,B017S3OP7A,"Martian is a great story and the film is entertaining.  It deserves all the kudos it has received.  Really, I can't point to a specific weakness.  It is an unusually good intersection between studio profit motive and skilled artists. I only hold a star back because of the general sense I felt about the emotional distance between myself and the stranded astronaut Whatney.  The movie had plenty of opportunity to explore and share his personality, fear, pain, loneliness, sense of hopelessness, etc., but ""The Martian"" generally passed this up.  They should have watched ""Castaway"" for a few ideas.  Greater insight into the emotional reality for the main character in the screenplay would have really helped. The book is written in diary form, so perhaps this discouraged the filmmakers from going too deep into feelings.  Very good picture despite this.",1454544000,,856,5.115107913669065

7525351,3,B017S3OP7A,"As far as space movies go - and I've seen a lot of space movies - ""The Martian"" isn't terrible.  It's not blow-the-doors-off fantastic either, but in the final analysis it's entertaining enough.  The movie that, to me, this is closest to is ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marooned/dp/B0000CGNEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marooned</a>, which despite its slow pacing gives a very real sense of peril for the three men languishing aboard an Apollo spacecraft in Earth orbit with a balky main engine and a hurricane standing between them and rescue.

All the science notwithstanding, one thing stood out to me from the jump.  Jeff Daniels's character was referred to as the director of NASA in the caption for his character.  In real life, NASA is led by an administrator, not a director.  To me, that's an elementary piece of information that shouldn't have been botched.  Frankly, no matter what the caption said, I didn't care for Jeff Daniels's character at all.  Unlike Gregory Peck, who played the head of the space program in ""Marooned"" with a maddeningly effective emotional detachment as the program is utmost in his mind, Daniels comes across as a pompous windbag who seems more concerned about his image.  I normally like Jeff Daniels, but not here.

At least Matt Damon was given something to do in this movie, and he actually does it fairly well.  Instead of chewing scenery in an orbiting spacecraft, with absolutely nothing else to do but talk, he does so in making sure he has something to eat and can communicate with Earth.  Damon is funny in spots, but there is a sense of serious behind his character.  You know he wants to survive and is doing everything he can to make that happen.  So it was hard for me not to root for him.

Overall, ""The Martian"" is decent for what it is.  Definitely not what I'd consider fodder for major awards, but a decent change of pace for a rainy afternoon.",1454544000,,1944,4.935384615384615

There were some omissions but that happens with almost all adaptations and none of them were game changers for me.
Nice wrap up at the end as that was my one issue with the book. It almost seemed like the author woke up one day and decided he wasn't going to write anymore.

My favorite part is when Watney is ranting when he finds out his crew hasn't been told he was still alive. The camera shot is outside the cabin, so you can only see his lips moving but perfectly understand the cuss words being used. My friend, who's in his 80's and hearing isn't as sharp as it once was, thought he'd missed something. After the laughter in the theatre died down, my friend said in a not so quiet voice, ""What did he say?"" The audience broke into laughter again!",1454544000,,565,4.339622641509434

Since this is generally set in the real-world near future, I found all the Hail Mary, last second decisions that ""just might work"" unbelievable. There were too many scenarios that had to just right for this rescue to succeed to be plausible. Plus, how many billions of dollars were spent to save this one man?

Thankfully, however, they also didn't include as much of the scientific hyperbole that almost ruins the book.

He hates science fiction, but at least he got to think about living on Mars -- something he's been reading about off and on in ""Discovery"" magazine, etc.  It was okay for both of us.",1454457600,,527,4.458333333333333

7525586,4,B017S3OP7A,"This is an exciting and enjoyable movie which strongly held my attention from start to finish. I couldn't help but get emotionally involved, especially when things went well despite the dangers involved. It even provided some joyful feelings and great laughs at times. It helped, also, to know ahead of time that Matt Damon's character, Mark Watney, would survive despite almost impossible obstacles. The one distraction and, for me, a chief fault with an otherwise really good movie was the unnecessary prevalence of foul language. Why Hollywood writers, directors and producers still seem to feel that filthy language is desirable and tolerable to a decent public is an indication of their blindness, in my opinion, to what customers really want in the quality of movies. Interesting that the previews and trailers designed to draw interest in such movies seem invariably to leave out the foul language later encountered when the full movie is viewed.",1454457600,,953,5.194805194805195

And I know the back full nude shot of him after his shower more than made the point that he was starving and trying to make his food last.  But I did say MORE THAN MADE THE POINT.

Fun movie!  It stays true to the spirit of the book, with some deviations to allow for the difference in medium.  After all, a lot of the book is Mark's internal dialog, which doesn't make for exciting visuals.  The alterations in the storyline don't really detract from the movie, though if you've read the book you'll notice the differences.  The book is a must-read just for the enjoyment of it, but it is not necessary to read the book to enjoy the movie.  The extras that come on the Blu-Ray are nice though most of them were released as promos on YouTube during the run-up to the movie. The bonus short ""Ares III: Refocused"" is not one of them, and is probably the best of the bunch.",1454457600,,711,4.4728682170542635

For example, the Martian gravity is 1/3 of that on Earth.  However, no attempt was made to show how this lower gravity would affect walking on Mars, and in lifting heavy objects.  Also, destructive storms on Mars didn't make sense.  We know that the Martian atmosphere is mostly made of carbon dioxide and that the average Martian atmospheric pressure is under 0.09 psi - compared to 14.7 psi on Earth (169 times less pressure).

Aside from the science, the movie was entertaining.  Acting was good - especially by Matt Damon who carried the movie.  There were some humorous moments to keep the movie from becoming boring and monotonous.  Overall, a good job!!",1454457600,,799,4.859259259259259

7525695,2,B017S3OP7A,"Great premise for a movie but the story and execution went from good to okay to awful. A few lame ""music video"" segments put in for filler were partially responsible for the spoilage of this movie. It was like they thought, ""This plot is stalled, let's throw in having a guy do mundane chores to music!"" Jeez. I'm not a scientist and maybe I'm wrong, but while the initial problems/technical solutions seemed at least in the realm of possibility, the last half hour and particularly the climatic scene, were nothing short of ludicrous. The most wild-eyed science fiction wouldn't come up with that solution to the final problem - because there is no way in the world (or Mars) that it would not result in a dead astronaut. Add in a hackey ""world celebrates"" scene to end it and you have a movie that went off the tracks about an hour in and never got back on.",1454457600,3,859,4.477707006369426

7525708,4,B017S3OP7A,"Excellent, but I reserve 5 stars for what I believe is a classic, such as Casablanca.  Good performances all round.  Although much of the time, it's Matt Damon alone on Mars, it still held my attention.  The obvious comparison is Tom Hanks in Castaway.  Although I believe Mr. Hanks gave an equally good performance, because the vast majority of that film concentrated on Mr. Hanks alone on an island, I believe its plot suffered.  One person on an island can only go so far in making an intriguing story.  On the other hand, the Martian periodically cut back to earth for the discovery that Mr. Damon was alive and then to periodically discuss efforts to rescue him.  Consequently, a good pace seemed to be maintained throughout the movie.  Cinematography and special effects were very good and added to the movie rather than seeming to try and take over the movie.  Too many science fiction movies seem to be just vehicles for the special effects.  For ""The Martian"" this is not the case.  Definitely worth seeing.",1454457600,,1016,4.748571428571428

I don't think there is anything I can add that reviewers have not already added. I loved that Matt Damon was so snarky at times. I loved that he showed a flawed character, too. Not really flawed - just made a mistake or two and then got truly bummed - wouldn't you - if your only chance for survival was already slim to none? :-)  For once there was no entangled romantic secondary story.

7525953,5,B017S3OP7A,"I have to say, right off the bat, that to me, the movie The Martian is the best science fiction movie that I have ever seen. Of course, the lovers of the flashing ray-gun kind of movie would undoubtedly vigorously disagree with me  but hey, thats life!
In my humble opinion, the movie put the SCIENCE into movie science fiction. The only bit of creative license that I saw was the cataclysmic force of the Martian dust storm. While the wind velocities of Martian storms can be quite high, the extremely thin Martian atmosphere (less than 1% of Earths sea-level air pressure) would not be able to transmit much force.
Im OK with that much creative license since, without it, there wouldnt have been a story  at least not the same story.
I liked the realism of the movie. All of the equipment, from the spacesuits to the rover to the Hab to the Hermes cycler spaceship were very well crafted and very credible. The characters were believable, as well. I particular liked the Mark Watney character, who, when he began to realize the magnitude of the fix he was in, says to his video log, Im going to have to science the sh*t out of this. Which he proceeds to do!
*****SPOILER ALERT*****
For me, the most poignant moment, in both the book and the movie, was when Mission Commander Lewis realizes that one of her people has been stranded on Mars.
I left him behind, she says.
The crew tries to make their forced evacuation from the surface of Mars a collective endeavor, saying that, We all left together.
But the commander was having none of it.
You were following orders. I left him behind.
I suppose thats what they mean about the loneliness of command.

As for the movie, it was good, but it's a bit like taking someone to a local carnival and then telling them,  ""That's basically what Disneyland is.""

I really believe it's our destiny to explore and inhabit other worlds. The movie shows how much could be accomplished if the humanity can focus on the right things.

But it was really well done, the plot was great and kept me entertained.  It's a long movie and that's okay.  It kept moving forward so it wasn't one of those movies that was far too long to get the point across.  Sure, are there some hokey spots, yes.  But it works.

I have a 15 minute rule with every movie I watch...if you can't get my attention and make me want to watch more in 15 minutes, I turn it off.  This movie had me as soon as it started and didn't let go until it was over!  You would think that a movie about a guy alone on Mars would bore you to death, but this was the complete opposite.  Matt Damon was fantastic!!  He sold that role like I don't think anyone else could have.  I never give a movie 5 stars because there is always something lacking...plot line, acting, reality of the story...etc., but this missed nothing!  It seemed like a plausible story and the way it was written, it definitely seemed as if what happened could have happened.  In conclusion, WATCH THIS MOVIE!  :)",1454284800,,796,4.360544217687075

7526230,5,B017S3OP7A,We loved this film.  Lots of dramatic tension.  The hero's 'can do' attitude is exactly what is required to survive catastrophic situations.  In an emergency situation you have to force yourself to do the seemly impossible.  Be the cheerleader on the sidelines to spur yourself on.  To do any less...more than likely you will die!  This film dramatizes this ultimate struggle.  Loved the film and applauded the ending!,1454284800,,418,5.0588235294117645

7526235,2,B017S3OP7A,"The story line was awesome, special affects were really good; however, the rescue was far fetched, unrealistic and ruined the movie.  And what is with directors who seem to pick the youngest actors to portray scientists and astronauts?

Here you have, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), who is a botanist, on a 30 day mission to Mars, with no plans to actually grow anything on Mars and he becomes this no-it-all on everything from electronic repair, survivalist, engineer, etc. And, what supposed to be several years in the rescue process where no one seemed to age except for Mark Watney (Matt Damon), who grew a beard.

I would have preferred the supply ship to have made it to Mars and give Mark Watney a living chance to survive.  Then, when the next mission to Mars happened, Mark Watney would have been found dead or whacked out of his mind.

This had the possibility to be a 5 star movie but I gave it 2 stars.",1454284800,3,909,4.5182926829268295

7526242,5,B017S3OP7A,"This is one of the best films I've seen in years.
After a necessary, action-packed set-up that was scientifically impossible, but critical to the plot of the story, the science is practically bullet-proof.
Matt Damon is outstanding as Astronaut, Mark Watney in this 21st Century version of Robinson Crusoe. (Thank you, Mr. Scott, for not making a decision to have him name and be-friend the Sojourner rover (Wilson!).
The supporting cast is equally ""stellar"" in their performances. (sorry)

I've heard it called a 2-1/2 hour NASA commercial. It sure does a job of flooding them with a positive light. But hey, they deserve the red carpet treatment they received in this film. Ridley Scott worked with them and they helped to keep the science on track. I only wonder how much better ""Gravity"" could have been if they had asked  real NASA scientists and engineers what actually goes on in space; as Ridley Scott obviously took the time to do in this film.  And while the science is good enough to satisfy us geeks, it is not ""in your face"". The story rules this film and it is both exciting and emotional.

Many of the praises I could make about this film can't be said here without exposing massive spoilers, so I'll just say it is a must see movie if you have any interest whatsoever in mankind's future in Space, or if you simply want to see a feel-good film about the incredible resilience of the Human spirit.

My only critical point is Jeff Daniels. His smug and arrogant portrayal of the NASA director was in-congruent with the type of man capable of making such thoughtful decisions; or earning the respect of his peers and employees.",1454284800,2,1640,4.700348432055749

7526328,2,B017S3OP7A,"The Martian(Released Sept/15)stars,among others,Matt Damon,Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels and Sean Bean. Not having seen it during its initial theatrical run I am sure I am not the only one who heard the scuttlebutt on what a ""great"" movie this was. Not to mention that Damon would be a good candidate for an OSCAR.As has happened so many times in the past,the rumour mill turns out to be just that;thinner than air itself. What a big disappointment this barely a sliver above a turkey was.
The story finds Damon as a botanist,and five other crew,on Mars collecting data on our celestial neigbour. Up whips a huge sandstorm and their spaceship is in danger of toppling. As the crew return to the ship to leave,Damon gets struck by an antenna array and is propelled into the air and out of sight. The on board instruments tell everyone his vital functions are gone. So with danger imminent the order is given to leave poste haste.
Unbeknownst to the crew,Damon is alive,but temporarily not so well. There is a piece of antenna wiring stuck in his stomach,the blood from which most likely saving his life as it sealed the tear in the suit. He hobbles back to base camp,does a little self doctoring and is soon up and around. Now the task begins for him to survive somehow until help arrives. Damon proves resourceful and devises a way to grow potatoes inside the habitat to extend his food supply. One day he comes upon a solution to contact Earth. By this time,however,NASA has already detected him and when they finally connect,the rush is on to get him back home.
The crew of the returning ship,after three months,is finally made aware of the situation. After a supply ship to Mars,which is hastily put together,blows up after launch,NASA devises a plan to slingshot the returning ship around Earth,pick up supplies(from a joint U.S./China project)in orbit,and head back to Mars. This is accomplished, but once in orbit the return ship is still too far away to get to Damon. His ship(a de-constructed supply ship sent to Mars ahead of a future mission)is tumbling over and over far below. The captain of the rescue ship is on an EVA seat stretched as far as the tether will take it. Damon in a desperate move cuts his suit around his wrist and uses the escaping air to propel himself to the captain. Damon is saved.
As the film ends we find Damon is now teaching up and coming astronauts.
Yes the S/FX are very good and director Scott does manage to imbue the film with moments of tension and suspense. But the outcome is telegraphed long before the picture ends,so it is just a matter of wading through over two hours of long,drawn out and quite boring scenes involving either Damon's activities on Mars or the NASA gang on Earth doing their ""we're very concerned and worried"" routine. The outdoor scenes of Mars itself were totally unconvincing to this reviewer. The were of course just computer enhanced Earth scenery, but it LOOKED like computer enchanced Earth scenery(we're not supposed to think that while watching,as it kinda spoils the believably ya know ).Damons transformation from full weight to a walking skeleton near the end of his rescue was also not believable. What caused this severe weight loss was his having to ration his meager supplies. However when the producers showed an obvious double from behind-only to emphasize his wasted phsyique,they forgot when they showed his face that it too should have looked as gaunt. It looked as full as it did in the beginning of the film. And if he was that emaciated how did he ever have the strength to do the things he did to get rescued. Just asking.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a gag reel,featurettes and the trailer. From what I understand the original cut of this film came in around 2hrs. 45m. I would expect that version to be released sometime in the future.
All in all a darn long and boring film. While it tried to be something grander,all it succeeded in doing was trying my patience. Do not believe the hype folks or you will be sadly disappointed. 2  1/2 stars.",1454198400,,4130,4.704419889502763

7526633,2,B017S3OP7A,"I'm quite sorry to have to say that The Martian was a great disappointment.

I am a long-time fan of director Ridley Scott, both of his science fiction films, Alien being one of best ever made, as well as some of his other films, such as Someone to Watch Over Me and Thelma and Louise.

I looked forward to the release of this film.

The first segment of adjusting to life on Mars is pretty good. Matt Damon is well cast as an astronaut type, and his behavior will remind viewers very much of the old MacGyver television show with a number of ingenious survival tricks and jerry-rigged apparatus.

I like Damon, but his role and performance are not demanding enough to warrant any award. I do very much like the little touches of humor scattered in this segment. Some viewers seem to have objected, but I think the humor was a good choice.

Then the film begins to fall apart. Scenes back at NASA sometimes are just plain tedious with orders being grunted and scads of people running about and grimacing. The casting for the Director of NASA is poor, entirely unsuitable. The dialogue is all second-rate, at best, yet writing has been nominated for an award.

The staged whole worlds interest, eventually, in one man stuck on Mars quickly tires too. It reminds me of some of the cheaper sci-fi films of the 1950s with news reel crowd scenes spliced in. No, these aren't news reels, they're carefully constructed new footage, but what a tedious waste of time they are. It simply fails to capture us in the drama which it claims is going on.

Good God, and then officials in China take an interest and offer a now-secret rocket system of their own to help. This is absolutely unbelievable. Great powers do not behave this way, motivated by sentimentality  certainly the United States never would.

I won't go into details, but the actual escape from Mars is close to ridiculous and highly unsatisfying. Yes, it is all superficially plausible, but it is not truly believable. There is a difference.

Since the tedious portion of the film is at least half its length, I just cannot recommend it, and not by any stretch of the imagination is it a ""best film.""

By the way, there is a pice de rsistance bit of droning boredom tacked-on at the end. Damon, now famous, goes to speak to a group of aspiring students. The scene is literally silly and reminds me of a sermonette on self-reliance, which, of course, as any reasonable person knows is not something you can teach. You either have the right stuff or you dont, and only real-life challenge will prove it one way or another.

This film definitely does not have the right stuff.

I believe Ridley Scott is now 78 years old.  Quite possibly, he has passed his productive years?

Maybe the award nominations reflect this fact. After all, they gave an Oscar to Elizabeth Taylor for one of worst performances in another, almost unwatchably boring film, ""Butterfield 8,"" years ago because she was very sick at the time and of course was a big money-earner for the studios.

Some smaller points.

First, the escape ship, from Mars orbit, seems to me impossibly large and complex, given the huge engineering efforts always put in to minimize such things by NASA.

Second, in the early scene of the crew leaving Mars in their lander and leaving their comrade behind, the reason is a massive sand storm. Surely, planners would anticipate such storms. We know right now that you couldn't go and stay any time there without adequate preparations.",1454198400,7,3484,4.665032679738562

7526635,5,B017S3OP7A,"I saw the Golden Globes where The Martian won for best Comedy and rightly so, Matt Damon was brilliant as a stranded Astronaut a lone on a far away Planet to figure out survival on his new home, it was a refreshing look at all the movies done about Mars. His situations and at times the pain of being creative can have painful consequences! But it was very entertaining, but most of all he showed what character he can create on screen, as he has done so many times before. I found it refreshing scifi, good script great acting on all their parts.

7526663,5,B017S3OP7A,Every so often a movie comes out the keeps you in the action the entire time.  The Martian is one such film.  The film is suspenseful and funny.  The characters are believable and you cheer inside for their success.  I cannot think of one character that I didn't find positive qualities.  Each character had its own perspective about what was going on around him/her and you could empathize with their position. There was an Apollo 13 feel with this film.

Seriously?) and direction this overrated, boring film goes in, with bad writing, acting and plenty of ""safe Hollywood schtick"" does little to redeem itself by the end.  In fact it just keeps getting worse.

Everything in this film seems poorly written, acted and directed.  I don't get it at all.  The ""disco music"" stuff just isn't funny at all (zzzz).

I expected a suspenseful thriller that Scott is known for, instead I see a pandering, vapid attempt to appeal to ""young, nerdy millenials"" with lines like ""I'm going to Science the $*!!! out of this."" (lame)

I could barely get through the 2nd half of it - I didn't care if Damon's character lived or died, I didn't care, I didn't care about anyone in this fiction.

7526674,2,B017S3OP7A,"By now, miraculously surviving Mars & escaping the planet itself, creating breathable atmosphere, reprograming decades old Soviet probe w/enough liquid rocket fuel that hadn't degraded @ all.  Mel Brooks, Larry David directing a movie about nothing new or interest could well have improved the film.  Honest Trailer was far more entertaining.

I'm truly stunned @ this movies popularity.  I rented it & as Matt (I despise my species & its contribution to trace atmospheric gasses: totaling 0.03% CO2 & other various & sundry gases) Damon, the botanist, who may not know how to operate airlocks in outer space & despite his terrestrial digs on Mars has the same dumb luck...

In 2000 Don Cheadle & Val Kilmer overcame far more impossible odds in separate movies, same planet, same obstacles to overcome.  ""Sciencing  the Sh! t"" out of meager resources @ their disposal allowed Cheadle to grow plants for breathable atmosphere until his crew returned & we learned earth was populated long ago by real Martians.

Kilmer fought off psychotic fellow astronauts, short circuited terminator, flesh-eating simple celled organisms whose upside is... breathable atmosphere. Next on to reprogram a decades old soviet probe w/Cyrillic alphanumeric digits w/lots of liquid fuel left over that hadn't stratified and mechanics, rocket all still working.  Whack Terminator, crawl inside, blast off like a bat of hell, let ship disintegrate around him while getting into orbit and the waiting arms of Carrie-Anne Moss. and a nice long ride home, if you know what I mean...

Cheadle had to settle for the same old boring ride while Gary Sinus finally got to go where the Martians went.  Probably chewing on him the whole way but boy did they go fast.",1454112000,,1732,5.084805653710247

I'd seen Gladiator and Prometheus and knew what Ridley Scott could do. The former was awesome the latter was decent (but at least interesting). However, The Martian was a HUGE let down. It was very boring. There was not really any moment when you felt the main character was in real danger, which is a pretty impressive feat given he was stranded on Mars!

7526681,2,B017S3OP7A,"I expected so much more from this film -- directed by one of my favorite directors, Ridley Scott, and starring one of my favorite actors, Matt Damon. But ""The Martian"" squandered its potential by constantly changing its point of view, introducing a bunch of characters we never really got to know, and bouncing from Mars to earth to space and back around again. It would have been fascinating to stay with Mark on Mars, as we stayed with Tom Hanks in ""Castaway,"" experiencing his solitude, hopelessness and then ingenuity and determination to survive. In ""Castaway,"" Hanks' character was on a remote island on earth. Mark was on Mars and, as the audience, we could have experienced Mars with him, felt its barrenness and gloried in its magnificence. Ridley Scott, along with his team, is a master at creating alien worlds -- ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" come immediately to mind. Matt Damon is a talented actor, who could have given us a powerful performance, as Hanks did in ""Castaway.""

7526784,3,B017S3OP7A,"Anyone proposing to buy this movie should first come to grips with astounding hypocrisy inherent within it. As any informed person knows the chief protagonist, Matt Damon, is a huge liberal and big Obama supporter, at least in 2008. Now, first and foremost, this film portrays a NASA filled with young millennial types just over bursting with tech knowhow embracing the challenges of space and interplanetary exploration. As the plot of this film unfolds the entire world becomes enveloped in the drama of interplanetary exploration. However, the truth is, it is funding for this type of manned exploration that President Obama has cut the most.

in 2012, one year after the book on which the film was based was published, President Barack Obama allocated $1.2 billion to NASA's planetary science programs  a 20 percent cut from the current allotment of $1.5 billion, with further reductions expected over the next several years. This shift compels the agency to withdraw from the European-led ExoMars missions, which aim to launch an orbiter and a drill-toting rover to the Red Planet in 2016 and 2018, respectively. According to one news article ""NASA's new strategy acknowledges that the agency won't be launching ambitious, expensive ""flagship"" missions like MSL toward the Red Planet  or any other solar system body  anytime soon. 'A flagship mission in not on the table,' said John Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science. 'We're looking at building a moderate mission...',

Now this film was released three years after Obama's cuts, so the filmmakers knew all about it, but in the film the only government agency that comes under criticism for spending priorities is Congress (who, as the film was released was controlled by political conservatives).

If you want to see man on Mars, then buy this movie and vote Republican. By the way, it was Republican President Dwight Eisenhower who created NASA in the first place.",1454112000,,1940,5.162420382165605

Holy cow! If you think the book is fabulous, wait until you see the movie.

The cinematography is out of this world, the casting is awesome, and the scenes you loved in the book come to life in dramatic and fun ways. Careful if you are drinking anything during the movie. I almost spit tea all over the place at one of those comedic scenes.

Im not a huge fan of Mark Damon, cast as Mark Watney. His most memorable movies for me were The Talented Mr. Ripley and The Bourne series. He won me over with his superb acting. He had to carry most of the movie by himself.

For all of you ladies, I don't know about you, but is he not ruggedly handsome now. I wonder why men get better looking with time, and we women fight gravity, literally. LOL

I read the book first. Usually do. Id recommend you do that so you get more indepth info about the characters and their thoughts. Makes for a richer experience.

Basic tale of man stranded on deserted ""island"" with little hope of rescue done with a modern twist. The movie is a lot of fun with lots of offbeat humor. Many errors on the scientific scale but that can be forgiven because it does provide basic education on planetary injection, relative velocity rendezvous, gravity, atmosphere pressure, and many of the issues involved in interplanetary colonization.

However, as a child of the space race, there were a few things that bothered me even though I know they were done to achieve more drama.  Once the crew makes their emergency bug-out and they are out of danger, why would they then head back to Earth?  They were only half way through their planned schedule and so they had supplies and a launch window that was months away.  Any scientist is going to want to stay in orbit and conduct science and also observe the impact of the storm on the surface facilities.  I understand that they could not go back down to the surface, but who would just take off for home without checking on anything?  And why would NASA which tries to be precise in the things that it does, just assume him to be dead?  And why would you start running the rover all over the place first thing?  The first thing you do in crash scenario is stay put and let the help come to you.  Nevertheless, I did enjoy the movie a great deal.",1453852800,2,1021,4.216494845360825

7527106,5,B017S3OP7A,"This is a survival movie. Great Movie! Our whole family enjoyed it. If you like survival movies then this is for you.  After being abandoned and left for dead on Mars... Michael Pena has to use every common sense and science theory to survive long enough until help can come, which will take almost a year of survival. No water, no food, harsh temperatures and bad weather makes it interesting on how he figures out all these crucial necessities to live.  Incredibly the instinct to live and never give up is what kept him alive. A lesson we all should learn from this movie.",1453852800,,575,4.519230769230769

Gist of the movie was okay, but I'd just read the book, and I felt the movie missed a lot of opportunities to highlight Watney's sense of humor, Mitch's Lack of humor, the media woman's (forgot her name) crudeness, for example.  The book also spends more time on the science and hard work to prepare for the trip to the MAV, like the foray to find Pathfinder, prepping the rover and trailer, etc.  Matt Damon was Great with what he had to work with, but I just felt we missed a lot of the humor, drama, and amazing fortitude that the book examines.",1453852800,,594,4.285714285714286
7527132,3,B017S3OP7A,"I didn't fall asleep during this movie, so that was good. But, to me, the type of movie it is, is summed up in the scene where Matt Damon is going over his predicament of being marooned on mars in his mind, and he concludes that, in order to survive, he's going to have to ""science the s**t out of it.""

You could almost replace Mars with a football field and have Matt Damon struggling to overcome insurmountable odds in getting that last magic game winning touchdown  There are interesting portions but overall its predictable and parts just silly- and they never stop trying to explain every detail to viewers.  You won't have to connect any of the dots yourself, thats for sure.

Come on now...This ""Macgyver"" astronaut has the answer to every single problem that comes up..He puts a scoop of crap near a potato and puts it into highly radiated martian soil and presto...he has potatoes up to his ears. I know its all for effect and part of the survival story but come on. Next he is a plant guy...a botanist, yet he solves a multitude of problems far exceeding the knowledge of a plant scientist.. Then he tapes plastic to the entrance to seal it up. This is the most unbelievable part.. Total BS!!  Not only would the pressure difference instantly blow it out but it somehow holds up to the storms...must be special space plastic and tape that stick at -150 degrees.  How many rolls of duct tape do astronauts carry?  He must have went thru 20 rolls. but hes not worried a bit, he just goes along his business not worrying if at any moment he could die instantly. I know I couldn't sleep a wink with plastic and tape separating me from the martian atmosphere. The movie overall keeps you going with problem after problem being solved and for me there wasn't enough action and was drawn out way too far. It's entertaining enough if you don't dig into the scientific aspects of Mars. I'm still debating whether to add it to my sci fi collection.",1453852800,4,1363,4.465863453815261

Then the family got home and I watched it again - with distractions.  It was even better.  Not with the noise but I felt more like I ""owned"" it.

The cinematography was stellar.  The acting was awesome.  It was nice to see Kristen Wig in something other than a comedy to see what else she can accomplish.

The soundtrack was my type of music - Disco, I know but these are the hits.  One line by Mark Watney(Matt Damon)  was ""This song is the least disco out of the entire collection.""  And, he starts playing Donna Summer, ""Hot Stuff.""",1453852800,,724,4.129496402877698

This is a movie that will leave folks in their senior years with some very interesting feelings about where we are heading with our lives and how much we will miss when we are finally gone. I never imagined Mars as a real destination, but this movie has given me a fresh set of impressions on why that is a great goal, as an avenue to progress on not just a scientific level but to pose moral and ethical questions as well. Can a man who leaves everything he knows behind still be the same person? The ""Robinson Crusoe"" effect has given this deep philosophical question a through re-vamp here, in an enjoyable future adventure that should be a positive, up-lifting human survival tale with a space-age twist that will keep you glued to the screen until the very end.

They're all talking very seriously into screens all the time. In thinking about how more emotion could have been worked into the story, I got to wondering where Mark Watney's parents were. He records a message to them while stranded on Mars, but if he's talking to the folks at NASA, couldn't they have brought the parents in to see and talk to him? If it were my son, I would have torn down walls and kicked in doors to get to the control room. There's the emotion that was missing, in my opinion.

7527234,4,B017S3OP7A,"A very cool movie about a stranded astronaut. I really like the scripting. However, there were a few inaccuracies, as usual with Hollywood writers,
For one, an airlock would not be made of what was shown in the movie, and would have been more properly secured to it's habitat module. Oh well, it made for a bit of excitement, I suppose. There also would not have been noticeable flapping of plastic sheeting, as the pressure on Mars is one two hundredth that of Earth. Yeh, you would see the dust blowing about, but it would not be as dramatic as seen here.

Also, a returning space craft would not have enough fuel, or food to turn around, and go all the way back to Mars to make a rescue. In reality, an unmanned ship built for one would have been the best logical choice to be sent for a rescue.",1453766400,,798,4.32

I like this movie because it it's well done and has a story that should be dull but is not. But prepare to suspend belief, at least in part, for much of the science.

7527258,5,B017S3OP7A,"I was fortunate to have had the chance to read the book this movie is based on very early on.  It was dicey as to whether I would be able to finish it as the language was periodically quite coarse and totally in your face.  Fortunately the screenplay toned that down a bit, enough to make it watchable and enjoyable.

The book to movie transition and faithfulness is great.  The story line, the intensity, and experience is fantastic.

Matt Damon nails the lead role as a botanist stranded on Mars, where he has to try to find a way to stay alive in the hopes that a rescue mission might take place, even though it is much more likely that it will not.

The science is solid, the storyline is engaging, and the acting is top-notch.

I highly recommend the book (but be ready for periodic heavy coarse language) and the movie.  I am happy to add this to my movie library.

When you do science fiction you can make the science so impossible that everyone just shrugs it off and goes for the entertainment. Or you can try to make the science realistic with a little exaggeration to make the story. This story is just WRONG. The science is wrong, the logic is wrong, the premise is wrong. The plot holes are blinding. It is not entertaining.

Jeff Daniels makes this film a B rated movie just because of his lack of acting, he should stick to Dumb and Dumber B type films. Matt Damon's acting just flat out sucks. The rest of the actors were emotionless blah, blah, blah B types. The film had no emotion. This borders a comedy. The director made NASA look like a bunch of stupid idiots from a homeless shelter, and the astronauts look like rebellious, mutinous, insubordinate pirates.

The films share the theme of a mishap in space with the problem of bringing astronauts home alive with crippled equipment, but Apollo 13 succeeded in developing much more suspense and drama. I suspect the fact that Apollo 13 is based on actual events has a great deal to do with that. Also, I thought the end of The Martian was a bit anticlimactic.

He'd have to have an industrial torque machine to remove screws that are meant to secure a seat through thousands of pounds of force (think removing the seat of your car), but he was using a small hand drill and got the job done. If removing those screws were that easy, then I'd remove the seats from my car every time I vacuumed it.
I think I was caught up in saying ""oh that's not possible"" and couldn't enjoy it.

It would take a mini-series to do it justice, but this was a fun watch, even though some might think it shallow and inaccurate from a scientific perspective. I've been reading science fiction for over 60 years, and have to say that ""The Martian"" ranks right up there at the top. If you haven't read it, you're missing a real page-turner, even when you know the outcome. Mark Watney's faith in his ability to solve life-challenging problems, one at a time, is inspirational - something a relatively short movie can convey. Matt Damon was an excellent choice to play the lead, and I found the supporting cast equally well chosen and believable. Larger than life? Yeah, but fun, and close enough for me.",1453680000,,749,4.7251908396946565

I wasn't sure why this was in the comedy/drama category for Golden Globe but I guess I know why now for scattered comedic moments which I thought he struck a pretty good balance of being funny as a person with extreme condition and a possible fate.

7527694,5,B017S3OP7A,"This movie gets down to the nitty gritty of the good part of being from the USA, and from the planet Earth.  From the moment Matt Damon said ""I'm going to science the s*** out of this problem!"" I knew I was going to love this movie.  This is ""go where no man has gone before"" in a place much closer to home, and a story of human resourcefulness in making use of every possible known idea and tool to battle the ferocious forces of space.for the right to survive.  To people who see space travel as an unnecessary and somewhat frivolous human luxury, this movie might not turn you on so much.  But to me, this is the best movie of the year.",1453680000,,639,4.129032258064516

It's sort of like a mix between Macguyver and Castaway. This is the type of movie that can inspire people to never lose hope, even when things are at their worst. It's a little distracting that this movie has two actors from the movie Interstellar, but thankfully the plot is much different, even though we see Matt Damon wearing a space suit in both films.

The science is dense and excellent, the physical site of the Jordanian desert works perfectly for Mars (with a touch of CGI), the narrative is believable and the acting is wonderful. The realism is heightened by the humorous Band -of- Brothers- and- Sisters camaraderie among the crew members, joking in the face of really unimaginable tragedy. In particular is Matt Damon's video log comments as he clearly struggles to fend off despair and isolation with a sense of adventure.. as he is shown telling the class of new astronauts at the end of the film, just take it a step at a time, and each step of problem solving leads to another step. I think that this movie more than makes up for Ridley Scott's previous science fiction movie Prometheus and returns his audience to the gritty believable science of the original Alien and, of course, the touchstone science fiction movie of all time (up there with 2001 and Apollo !3), Blade Runner.

7527861,4,B017S3OP7A,"I enjoyed this movie. For what it's worth, I rented this movie. I watched it Friday night and again Sunday afternoon. The 48 Hour Rental was perfect for me. Not a movie that I feel like I need to own to watch it over and over. And I definitely feel that I got my money's worth.

The movie has a good story. The different sets and landscapes are convincing and believable - not just bad/obvious CGI. The entire cast was good (crazy amount of famous people playing all the roles). The Martian had some really funny moments and some really touching moments. And for a story as crazy and (seemingly) implausible as this one is, the moments were I went ""yeah right"" were so few and so minor. The movie was good; this is a horrible review (sorry).

Total side note: Not sure how Michael Pe&ntilde;a and Jessica Chastain are getting top billing. Not a big deal at all. It's just Matt Damon's face is right on the poster! (Not an actual complaint. Just a weird detail that made me smile).",1453680000,2,980,4.4088397790055245

Visually stunning movie, easily one of the best looking 3D movies I've ever seen - but the movie as a whole was your typical by-the-numbers space movie mixed with your generic survival story, nothing new here. I liked Gravity more, but it was a fun watch. Certainly not Best Picture material, we've seen a million movies like this before - and while I'm happy they didn't try and pull at your heartstrings too much, they didn't give the main character ANY backstory at all. A quick mention of his parents and that's it - your less excited to see how things play out because the filmmakers don't give you much purpose for him to survive outside of the fact that it would be a PR issue for NASA.

So I say pick this up if you have a 3D setup at home, but if you just want to see it in 2D - rent it, borrow it or be patient for it to hit Netflix.",1453680000,,1080,4.1875

As can be expected, the home experience isn't as breathtaking as the big screen, but it is still impressive.  To me, a science fiction film story needs to have aliens, replicants, murderous computers, etc.  This film is more real, more near-future, and more believable.  That is important to me.  As an engineer, I see a number of scientific flaws, but we are not talking a documentary here, it's a saga and good entertainment.

7527949,3,B017S3OP7A,"I was really looking forward to seeing the Martian since I heard so much about the movie. But by movies end, I was left very disappointed asking myself why was this movie even made. The Martian did not create any tension in the audience the way Apollo 13 did. When those astronauts were stranded in space, I was really worried about the crew and their problems and I was completely engaged in what the ground crew was actively working on towards solving Apollo's problems. Not so in the Martian. While communication between ground and Mars required excellent thinking to figure out how to communicate, the script and actors never included let you feel the fear of not communicating, never let you feel the fear of what if this doesn't work...none of that. The Martian was inventive - he did figure out how to make water but the movie presented the resourceful solution very blandly. The Martian was no MacGyver - but, the Martian did use duct tape a lot. The sling-shot around earth by the returning ship happened so fast, I thought I missed it! Remember Spock, McCoy, and Shatner coming home with two whales - there's a sling-shot with banter, humor, and worry.  The rescue was on the order of Gravity, but the execution of it was almost pooly executed routine - again, not a bit of tension built up by the commander who initially ordered the crew to leave Mars and now is trying to make-up for what she believed was a bad decision. The only bad decision here was bothering to see the movie at all. After it was all said and done, I felt as if I wasted 144 minutes; thank God it was on Prime.",1453593600,,1593,4.493103448275862

It's one thing to ask the audience to believe in the Mars story universe but a quantum leap to get viewers to believe there should be mobs in Time Square / media attention for one Kosmonaft.  It's easier to believe in time travel than believe people give a hoot for NASA's plight.  For a fleeting moment, I thought Segal Directed this flick.

Of course he isn't.  He survived, barely but the rest of the crew are on their way home and can't turn around.  Even if they could he has no way of contacting them.  His only hope is to wait for the next scheduled mission to Mars which will land 2,000 kilometers away.  He has a battery powered vehicle that can't travel anywhere near that far.  He has equipment for oxygen and water but the only food is what was left behind by the others which can't be stretched that long.  The movie is about how he overcomes one seemingly insurmountable problem after another and things don't always go smoothly.",1453593600,,817,4.593103448275862

7528223,4,B017S3OP7A,"One should read the book first in this case, for there are one or two scenes and bits of dialogue that seem to be out of sync with everything else.  For instance, why was Watney (and the technicians back on Earth) drilling holes in the second rover to remove the roof?  It was somewhat entertaining to see both the Earth technician and Watney fall through the roof of the rover after enough holes were drilled, but why remove the roof in the first place?  The book lets us know that Watney used the second rover for a trailer, not the spindly affair shown in the movie.  That being said, the movie did a good job of presenting the substance of the novel and the various technical and emotional dilemmas faced both by Watney on Mars, NASA on Earth, and the Hermes crew traveling both from and then back to Mars.  What's it like to suppose you've lost a crewmate on Mars and then, months into your flight back to Earth, to find out he is still alive you have left him behind?  Although the exchange between Watney and the Hermes crew is greatly condensed in the movie, the viewer is able to get the gist of the gritty decisions that had to be made by all involved.  The special effects alone were worth seeing, not the least of which were the scenes of a vast and empty Martian landscape in the middle of which were a single battered habitat, a moving rover trailing a plume of dust, or Watney alone in his EVA suit, sitting on a Martian rock and contemplating his fate.

7528225,2,B017S3OP7A,"Nice visually, but they gutted the plot leaving a bland story behind.  The characters were toned down cardboard cutouts, the actors had nothing left to work with and practically phoned in their performances.  Quite a few details were changed from the book, in such a way that they didn't work as well, or in some cases didn't make any sense at all. I understand the need for such changes for reasons such as pacing or explainability, but these seemed to have no purpose just added to my overall disappointment in the movie.  The audio book was fantastic, and much better performed than the movie.  Mark was ten times more likeable, and even the other characters had a lot more life in them.",1453593600,,690,4.631147540983607

Took the best sci-fi novel in years, and greatly improved it with wonderful acting, directing and screenwriting, not to mention magnificent special effects with breathtaking Martian vistas.

7528252,4,B017S3OP7A,"Laughs do not a comedy make.  Star Wars: A New Hope - Comedy? Of course not, but you chuckle when the Falcon won't make its jump and Han Solo insists, ""it's not my fault. It's not my fault!"" Just because a movie might have some comedic moments, or comments that make you laugh, that does not mean the movie is a comedy. Comedies have entirely different story arcs with pratfalls and reckonings for characters from unexpected sources and suchlike. This movie might be considered a comedy because of the approach to every dilemma that the chief protagonist chooses to take, which is to treat it as a challenge that has a solution as opposed to anything damning. As a book it almost certainly reads funnier than it comes across on the screen. I don't think I can write anything else without a spoiler disclaimer so I will leave this review with one comment that is not a spoiler but is about the movie. If you go to a planet, or moon, and plan to be there for 21 days, then everything is prepped for however many people will be there for that period of time, in terms of basic Maslow Hierarchy terms, which is to say food and shelter. There are other mission specific things, where the technology aspect of the trip is concerned, but food and shelter are the first concerns to be addressed. That said, if you ever wake up to find yourself stranded anywhere while you were sleeping in a tent, or in the case of the movie a glorified Yurt, and the one thing you can count on is extremely harsh and unpredictable weather patterns, please harden off the structure you are depending on for sustaining your life. At the very least, stack up some rocks and don't rely solely upon visqueen and duct tape.",1453593600,,1693,4.4789644012944985

7528297,3,B017S3OP7A,"3.5 Acclaimed director Ridley Scott once again takes to the stars with a semi-humorous movie based on a book by the same name. While on a manned mission to Mars, a vicious storm hits a small group of astronauts. As they try to escape, one of their crew, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), is hit by debris and presumed dead. The rest of the crew leave Mars for Earth. Back on Earth, NASA reports his death, but soon Mark turns up alive. NASA scrambles to save him, by sending him more supplies and figuring out a rescue mission. Mark, alone on the hostile planet with meager supplies, cultivates Mars and grows potatoes to survive. Of course more disaster hits both Mark and NASA. While the movie has a stellar cast [Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kate Mara, and Donald Glover], the movie was boring and lacked some character elements. The script was sarcastically funny, as Mark talked to the cameras to record his experience, but it lacked the pain and depression that Mark must have been feeling. It showed it at times, but spent a lot of time on Earth and NASAs rescue attempts. It was also a simple story that dragged on for 2 and half hours, where one knew the plot going into it. Being very visual with the Martian landscapes and space ships, this would have been a one for the theater, but I found that there was nothing exciting that makes it stand out. Its worth checking out on a lazy weekend afternoon, which is how I watched it.",1453593600,2,1472,4.51685393258427

7528300,3,B017S3OP7A,"Just some general notes.  Great concept and outstanding CGI. Reminded me a bit of Castaway but without the pathos.  A little over the top in MacGyver like ingenuity.  Fun to see but implausible.  Many science flaws (despite comments to the contrary).  For example, the wind storm that flung Watney away could not exist on Mars (because of thin atmosphere) so the entire scientific premise of the movie is flawed.  Over exposure to radiation would have normally crippled the crew both on Mars and the long journey between Earth and Mars.  This movie touted realism but it wasn't forthcoming here.  A bit hokey with the disco music.  I never really connected to the main character.  However, the scene with Watney giving himself medical attention was extremely well done and acted.  I enjoyed it, but it could have been a lot better!",1453593600,,831,4.864285714285714

Overall it was a pretty decent movie, but I was still left a lil unsatisfied. I kept expecting more to happen, more excitement.

But overall, the movie is top quality, pulls you in and the actors are great. I would definitely recommend reading the book first, to have a better understanding of this movie.

Damon is good and his character's challenge is interesting. But I lost interest after about the first 20-30 minutes thanks to the painfully trite dialog and Hollywood portrayal of the NASA ground crew. ""You do realize I'm your boss don't you?"" And then there was Kristin Wiig, whom I generally like, cast in a completely superfluous role as some senior NASA rep. or PR person. I could not figure out why her character  was in the movie at all. Her performance consisted of being on screen in a tight ""professional office couture"" and heels while her facial expressions were limited to a wide eyed ""OMG"" or smirkly ""don't even.""

7528323,5,B017S3OP7A,"Man's desire to survive, even against all realistic hope, is displayed in ""The Martian"". This movie falls between several classifications. It's adventure. It's suspense. It's comedy!  (Yes, I said comedy, but not because of the plot. It is the sense of humore of the main character, even in the most hopeless of situations.)

 Matt Damon portrayed NASA Astronaut/Engineer/Botonist Mark Watney, quite well, even though the editing in the screenplay took much to much of his personality away from the character. Mark WatneyThen again, comparing a movie to the book is always going to find the movie lacking! In this case, I believe they found several of the best parts of a 14 hour read and put them into a 2 hour movie.  I recommend that you see the movie. It will not disappoint. But READ THE BOOK!

With limited supplies, Damon convincingly ""colonizes"" the planet, creates a viable living space for himself and finds a way to stay alive until a rescue mission can be formed. The brilliance of this film is Ridley Scott's balance of suspense, heavy scientific-jargon, and sharp-witted humor. The films humor never detracts from the situation; if anything it alleviates the tension the audience feels as Damon tries to adapt to each new, spirit-crushing problem he encounters. The Martian if far from perfect, with some far-fetched sequences in the end that are a bit more movie-magic than applied science, but if you overlook that, you've got an intelligent, thriller with style and heart.",1453593600,,854,5.02112676056338

Notwithstanding  the knowledge that the character had of the planet  and the location of the previous satellite. In this sense the convenience  of locating the satellite  in the time slot presented  seemed a little unrealistic. Finally, the plot is one of the typical  seven or so the the industry seems to be stuck in as they continuously cycle through the actors, situations and the like only to end up back where some other 300 movies have been. Maybe I am getting old and my memory is shorter, or the movie industry  is,  and they lack the level of imagination  required  to end a movie with a real twist. Otherwise, I would have given it 4 stars.",1453593600,,765,4.4963503649635035

7528609,4,B017S3OP7A,"This is not the most memorable job by any of the major figures connected to this project, but it is nonetheless a fun a 2+ hours of popular entertainment that will be fun if you don't push and ask many questions. I don't mean to imply that this is like another popular SF film INDEPENDENCE DAY, which had a few dozen major - and I really do mean major - plot holes that makes it impossible for many viewers to accept the film on any level. It is all in all tremendously predictable, even formulaic, but the film is populated by a host of very talented professionals, both behind and in front of the camera, so any holes, like high grade spackle, is easily covered over.

The film raises some interesting meta-narrative questions. Is this SF? If so, why is it? If it isn't SF, why isn't it? It is set a few decades into the future, with space travel being taken for granted and apart from the logistical problems of going to Mars the only major hindrance. In fact, this really is nothing but a film about the logistical problems of going to Mars. The film is at its best when facing these complex considerations face on. Unlike in STAR TREK or STAR WARS, where somehow people can communicate across vast stretches of space in real time (which will never happen given to the nature of the very fabric of the stuff of the universe), there is a substantial time delay between messages sent to and from Mars. My favorite part of the film consisted of those on Mars trying to communicate to those on Earth using decades-old technology. Playing both sides of the ""Is this SF?"" question, one could say that this film follows firmly in the tradition of hard SF, in which scientific considerations play a major role in the story. And in fact, there are a lot of stories along these lines in the Golden Age of SF over which John Campbell reigned. Campbell wanted stories rooted in science, and deployed strong characters or even a strong literary subtext, as these detracted from the science. Thus, in what is widely considered the most famous and certainly the most anthologized SF short story ever written, ""The Cold Equations"" by Tom Godwin, the entire story involves figuring out if it is possible for a space ship carrying vital cargo for a distant planet to fulfill its mission after a woman stowaways on the ship. The captain (and in keeping with Campbell's aesthetic, both of the story's characters are cardboardish in the extreme - it was the very rare individual, such as Robert Heinlein, who was able to create memorable characters or great dialogue during the time Campbell held sway) spends most of the story ""working the problem,"" concluding that there is no way to reach the planet if he spares the stowaway, though virtually everyone who has ever read the story questions the story's central assumptions, asserting that it is hard to really believe that the equations are so cold as to allow no wiggle room at all. But one of the marks of hard SF is ""working the problem."" The other side would be that in the wake of Philip K. Dick supplanting Asimov, Heinlein, and Clarke as the model of what SF is trying to achieve (although Dick wrote in the fifties, sixties, and seventies, his books really only took off in a huge way in the eighties, partly as a result of BLADE RUNNER and partly as a result of Vintage bringing most of his novels into a standard, in print edition (I remember spending hours raking through SF bins in the seventies trying to find PKD novels - I even read drek like COUNTER CLOCK WORLD in my search for ANYTHING by him). Also important was the production of a five volume edition of his complete short stories. There are many ways in which we want more in our SF these days. THE MARTIAN is definitely an old style, hard SF story, and those who have come to love more nunanced stories and complex characters in the tradition of BLADE RUNNER (by the same director as THE MARTIAN) and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA may not find it to their taste. My opinion? I'm still trying to sort out how I feel, but I believe that this is SF, but not SF as interesting as most other good SF films of recent decades. I should also reveal that I passionately agree with Orson Scott Card that the STAR WARS films are not SF; they are fantasy adventures films in SF costumes. Even as space opera they fail to fall into either hard SF or Dickisian SF. The real source is the old thirties and forties low budget serials, which have never really been considered SF by most SF fans, even when considering FLASH GORDON. I believe issues of what constitutes a SF narrative an important one for understanding the genre as a whole.

But it is hard to fault this film too much. It is not in any way a memorable film - I have seen it once, and I doubt that I will ever want to see it again. As I said above, the film is stuffed to the brim with talented individuals, from stars like Matt Damon and Chiwetel Ejiofor to screen writer Drew Goddard (they guy who has emerged as one of the go-to screen writers of his generation simply couldn't overcome the limited nature of the story) and veteran director Ridley Scott. Speaking of the latter, even though he has directed some of my all time favorite films (ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER above all) and more recently created THE GOOD WIFE, a TV series I have thoroughly enjoyed, most of his films seem like projects for his enormous abilities in creating great visuals. Scott started off as an Art Director, and in a way he has never become more than this as a film director. All of his films look great, but they have not consistently been interesting in terms of character or story.

So, if you are looking for a fun time for two or so hours, this should do the trick. But I do not think that this will be remembered as a particularly fine film, whether SF or otherwise.",1453507200,,5802,4.476864966949953

Actually follows the book quit well. Watch it, get wrapped up in his quest for survival, the drama of his quest, and watch and listen to the one liners that make up the majority of the Mars script bring light humor to the entire story line. I enjoyed the movie just as much the second time through it as the first, even thought I was watching it the second time though to see the ""comedy"" within the movie, it's there but not in your face, totally enjoyable.

7528792,5,B017S3OP7A,"There is a philosophical thread that runs throughout recorded history regarding a group never (or at least almost never), leaving one of their own behind. In war it means soldiers going back to rescue one of their own who may have been lost or wounded. In any circumstances they strive to rescue their comrade(s). The Martian builds on that philosophy and does an excellent job of describing how both the one left behind and the rescuers go about affecting the rescue and returning their lost comrade home. So, the story and screenplay does very well in describing the complex activities necessary to rescue Matt Damon's character from certain death following the Martian storm that led to the separation from his colleagues. Moreover, the ""real"" science behind how Damon's character survives and ensures that he can get to the physical place on Mars where he can influence his own rescue is well woven into the story.

Looking at the acting and directing I would say that Damon did an excellent job of stepping through the story in the portrayal of the hero's overcoming one adversity after another. Additionally, the director did a masterful job in weaving the activities on earth and those going on on Mars so that the viewer can identify closely with the various characters - a not so easy feat considering how time and ""space"" would normally delay everything. So, the story unfolds at an acceptable rate so as to not lose the viewers. Well done!

The production values of the film were great with nearly seamless crossing between real and CGI. It was interesting to see how such vast spaces and time periods were deftly handled throughout. Another well done!

Overall, the story stayed believable (as opposed to other stories about Mars where preachiness can get in the way), and even with all the cards stacked against him, Matt comes home (in one piece)! Yea!!",1453507200,,1867,4.864779874213837

7528870,2,B017S3OP7A,"Good science. Some great scenes, especially towards the beginning of the film, where a solid performance by Matt Damon, makes watching the first man to live on Mars worth while.

As the film progresses, the story starts to feel muddled.  As new characters back on earth emerge, and old characters re-enter the frame, the moments in which the film beguiles, become rarer and rarer.

These moments become interupted by clunky edits, as the two parts of the story, Matt Damon colonization of Mars, and Nasa's rescue mission for his character jockey for attention.

A blockbuster cast (I'm guessing Ridley Scott really liked Interstellar, since he casted two of its alum), great and great cgi environmen's cannot save this film.

The music underwhelmed, the cinematography felt average for the scale of the film, and the clunky editing left me wanting for more.

I really liked this movie, though I would have liked to see more pre-Mars history or build-up to the main character.

By the end, I felt like all I knew about this character was that he was intelligent and a self-sufficient survivor, and probably not married with kids, but still had living parents. Maybe that's enough? Maybe it's meant to be focused solely on how he survives under the most dire circumstances?

7529027,5,B017S3OP7A,"Nine Things About ""The Martian""

1. This is probably the science fiction film with the most actual science that I've ever seen.

2. Based on a book by the same name, it's about a crew exploring Mars. When a huge dust storm hits, one of the crew members, Mark, is punched in the gut by piece of equipment and the crew leaves him for dead. Of course, he's not dead.

3. The movie goes back and forth between Mark's efforts to survive on Mars, and NASA's efforts to save him - and everybody can only use science and math. That's it. That's the whole plot. There's no violence, or aliens, or space battles (although technically there is one space pirate).

4. NASA consulted closely on this film to make it as accurate as possible, including the surface of Mars. So it's also kind of a commercial for NASA. But that's OK. Anything that encourages scientific education is fine with me.

5. There are two big scientific inaccuracies in the film - a storm on Mars couldn't be that strong, and the lack of atmosphere means Mark would have died of cancer. Additionally, I'm personally really suspicious of the ""Iron Man maneuver"". However, I think these are acceptable fudges, because they make the movie possible, and it is worth being made. The really cool things Mark does are basically real, even the way he makes water.

6. It's nice to see an accurate portrayal of a mission like this that relies on the delicate interplay of many different specialties, such as physics, chemistry, botany, and math. Nobody gets to be a superhero, but anybody can cause a mission to fail.

7. The cast is not only talented, but diverse. It's really great to see males and females of various races all being smart together. It's a subtle message that subjects in science, math, and engineering are for anyone who wants to study them (by the way, am I the only person that thinks Donald Glover is a really good actor and deserves much bigger roles than what he gets?).

8. Director Ridley Scott said he thinks the theme of the movie is that nobody is really alone. Which is funny, because I saw the exact opposite theme.

9. This movie is a rarity in Hollywood - it's entertainment mixed with actual learning. If you need action, or flashy special effects and interstellar drama, you're going to be disappointed. But with a story this compelling and realistic, I wouldn't be surprised to see a boost in science and math majors as a result of this movie.",1453507200,,2431,4.582949308755761

I recommended it to my teacher friends as a tool to combine reading, math and science in their classrooms.  Then I saw it in the theatre, with the 3-d glasses, and I loved it. At lot of the math and science detail from the book was left out. That's understandable because the movie would have had to be 10 hours long to include it all. Then, last night to celebrate the snow we watched it on our 42 inch TV. Once again, I loved it. The picture quality was outstanding, even though Amazon warned me that it might not be. I actually enjoyed the TV version more than the big screen because I was able to take in all the visual experiences at once. This movie was great for all ages. It has one four letter word in it.

This movie so badly wants the colonization of Mars to be probable it overcomes problems with outlandish solutions, done with silly humor.  I didn't find anything humorous or cute at all.  Especially when the lead character is munching away and drinking down liquids while talking about rationing.  Is Matt Damon supposed to be cute or something?  The interaction and negotiations between the administration and scientists were hokey and fake.  The Martian, a.ka. Matt Damon, a.k.a. Mark Whatney survives explosions, one of which throws him flying in a spherical container and would have broken bones at least.  And the script for the lead character is terrible.  One would think he'd be more articulate being a scientist.  ""I'm going to science the s**t out of this.""  Oh, ha ha.  ""Fortunately, I'm a botanist.  Mars will come to fear my botany powers!""  What?  Did this guy get into botanic super heroes?  And there was some epic realization how he has colonized mars because he grew some potatoes.  Horrible horrible acting when Whatney is in a rover freezing.  One does not talk and take deep breaths in sub zero temps.  They lock up and shiver.  Lot's of overacting really, and lots of ""We have Matt Damon so we can really make this character cute.""  SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER:  The sling shot concept to rescue the stranded astronaut is interesting, but are we really to believe Whatney and launch himself in orbit and the space station's precise calculations will put them in the same spot at the same time.  Especially when the station is coming to fast.  The hook up between the spaceship commander in a jet seat and astronaut in nothing but a space suit was absurdly contrived.  To refine velocity and direction on approach, the space station sets off an explosion to slow down and Whatney cuts a slit in his glove to jettison himself, and opening and closing his hand serves has a valve.  And it all went off with...well, there was a slight hitch of course, there at least had to be that.  The commander sat in a jet seat while Whatney tumbled toward her with his uncontrollable jet glove.  Of course, their hands pass through each other but Whatney gets tangled jet seat strap that is connected to the station.  Each have a hold of the strap from the jet seat and are winding closer together.  The commander sits in the jet seat desperately trying to maintain a grip on the strap while Whatney winds up around her.  Not sure why she had to struggle so much since Whatney would have been weightless in space.  Another annoying factor was all ""no gravity"" movement throughout the space station was flagrantly fake...they were all obviously flying and floating on cables.  This is one of those movies where you have a popular lead man mixed in plenty of female authority figures and market the thing like it's epic.  And why do the directors think Matt Damon can come off as so cute and profound?  Whatman is not a well known instructor/professor and he apparently has something profoundly epic to depart to his new students- SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER CONTINUED -----  ""Welcome to the Astronaut Candidate Program.  Now pay attention, cuz this could save your life.  Trust me I know what I'm talking about. All right let me get a few things out of the way right off the bat, yes, I did in fact survive on a deserted planet by farming in my own s**t.  Yes, it's actually worse than it sounds, so let's not talk about that ever again.  Uhh, the other question I get most frequently is, when I was up there stranded by myself, did I think I was gonna die?  Yes, absolutely. And that's what you need to know going in because it's going to happen to you.  This is space, it does not cooperate. At some point, everything's gonna go south on you, everything gonna go south and you're gonna say this is it, this is how I end. Now you can either accept that, or get to work. That's all it is, you just begin.  You do the math and you solve one problem, and you solve the next one, and the next one. If you solve enough problems you get to come home.

7529400,5,B017S3OP7A,"I absolutely adore this movie. I will say, the book, written by Andy Weir, is much better. I will also say there are some things in this movie that one would not fully understand had they not read the book, which would be the fault of the screen writer, Drew Goddard. That being said, I still love the movie by itself. Matt Damon did an absolutely wonderful job playing the ever intelligent and sarcastic Mark Watney. This movie was cast very well, except for Kristen Wiig. I don't believe she exactly fit the part that she was given. Jessica Chastain did wonderfully as Commander Lewis and so did her crew. Jeff Daniels was a very believable director of NASA. I would also like to give credit to Chiwetel Ejiofor and Sean Bean for being passionate as always. This movie is cinematically beautiful. The cast and crew worked hard and they did a wonderful job. If you don't enjoy science, I will admit that some parts may be boring to you. This is a very science heavy film. The main character, Mark Watney, has to survive in a place that nothing has survived in before. This is something that no average human could do. Through mass amounts of science, Mark cultivates Mars on the inside on his sort of house, called the HAB. And through lots of money, NASA eventually finds a way to bring him home.

An intriguing take on the Robinson Crusoe story features Matt Damon as a lone astronaut stranded on Mars and the attempt by NASA to rescue him. Ridley Scott does a masterful job directing this story and Matt Damon delivers a teriffic performance as the astronaut in peril but who cracks jokes instead of falling to despair.

7529445,5,B017S3OP7A,"I rarely give movies five stars. But I really enjoyed this movie. The story is straight forward and based on the eponymous popular novel by Andy Weir. And even though the film is 2 hours and 20 minutes long, it didn't feel that way at all. At no point did I think, man, I want this to hurry up. I was along the ride the whole way for sure. It had some nice moments of dry humor, lots of cool science moments, tons of exposition (but delivered in a way that made total sense for it to be spoken), was dramatic and entertaining all at once. I'd say this deserved a nomination for Best Directing, because it's so masterfully crafted by Ridley Scott, a man who isn't on my favorite director's list. In fact, I'm not usually in love with his movies like this (though I really like Thelma and Louise). I highly recommend this movie to families. It's good, clean, educational (of course some of the science doesn't check out, but hey, it's a movie first), inspiring and feel good.

It's rated Pg-13 for two spoken F-words (though their might be one or two others that are mouthed and unheard), one shot of a naked man from behind to show how much weight he has lost over time, some mild innuendos children won't understand, and a scene of injury and self-surgery.

7529563,4,B017S3OP7A,"I waited with great interest for the DVD to come out because I rarely go to the theaters anymore.  Too expensive and you have to put up with these
low lives that have to play with their cell phones rather than watch the movie.  When I got it I almost immediately watched it.  I have varied feelings
about this movie for the following reasons.  First, it is splendidly produced with excellent sets, realistic Mars scenes  (even with dust devils!) and
well conceived spaceship sets.  I did think the film was a bit long, with too much going back to NASA; I would rather spent more time with the
Astronaut on Mars.  I know something about space sciences and I did feel the Mothership was MUCH too large and spacious; It would have been
extremely difficult to heat and keep a  good atmosphere in such a huge ship; perhaps in the distant future such  a vessel would be considered.
Though the revolving living quarters should be thought about on any future Mars mission, because astronauts (NO COSMONAUTS!) could not
be locked up in space for 9 months in ""capsule"" like environments.  Something like the DISCOVERY from 2001 or the Ship in MISSION TO MARS
would be more likely to be considered.  It would have to be built in orbit, not launched from Earth.  Still, the Mothership was very well designed, and
believable as all the sets in this move is.  I gave this four stars instead of Five because I thought the rescue sequence was not well thought out; since the Mothership returned to Mars, why didn't a ship of that size have small shuttle ships?  This is Mars we are talking about which is only
a third of the size of earth with only 1/3 the gravity.  The need to leave the planet in an emergency and then return should have be a consideration
considering the length of the voyage to get there.  And Mars has a very thin atmosphere;  I could not believe the storms that do arise on the surface
would be strong enough to damage or topple the return vehicle.  The winds are said to rise to 300 mph but the air is so thin that a cracked visor
could cause the astronauts to ""explode""!  Perhaps I am wrong, but that is my opinion. But overall, the cast was excellent and I give an overall
""thumbs up"" to this film.  Ridley Scott made this and did a much better job than he did with that dopey EXODUS!!  To a certain extent this movie
reminded me a but of  ROBINSON CARUSO ON MARS, where an astronaut had to learn to survive untll a rescue ship would arrive.  It was good
for its time, but this film is much more up to  date and accurate.  The way this Astro found a way to communicate with earth was astounding.
So, Four Stars Plus for this well made, imaginative visually brilliant  movie.  I wish someone would make a keyboard that a good typist like me
(on REAL  typewriters!) could type on!!  OH well, this one will do.  I got my DVD from Amazon like all my others,  Enjoy!",1453334400,,2871,4.39089184060721
7529564,3,B017S3OP7A,"We get it, Mars is red and dusty and dull, and this dude is alone on it.  Makes for a movie that's also rather dull, and certainly not deserving of an Oscar nod.  Go ahead, rent it, it won't be the worst $6 you've ever spent, at least MD and JC are nice to look at, but try not to fall asleep...

7529604,2,B017S3OP7A,Overrated. I'm perfectly willing to suspend cinematic disbelief especially for science fiction. But... This was so over the top silly and glib that it just lost my interest. Ridiculous and inexplicable  plot twists abound. The cast of very good actors is amiable enough but the writing is awful. No amount of 70s music can save this self- regarding stinker. My expectations were just way too high. That's always a problem. Kristen Wiig needs to head back to SNL.,1453248000,3,462,4.923076923076923

7529606,5,B017S3OP7A,"I love this movie! Every moment of this movie is interesting, action-packed, and fascinating! Basically, I have watched this movie about six times now, since I bought it. The reason is the way the director and actors show how the lead character has to be innovative every step of the way to survive what has happened. And then there are the people back home, and those on the mission ship headed home. The bureaucracy is typical but the ability to get around it behind the scenes, is great!!

And it sounds logical!! It could happen!! It's about thinking outside the proverbial box. Every step of the way to survival. Great movie!!",1453248000,,631,4.684684684684685

7529726,5,B017S3OP7A,"I enjoyed this movie.  It was different from many of the plots out there and a breath of fresh air in that it was devoid of scenes added just because sex sells.  ***SPOILER SENTENCE*** Even the one scene where you see the main character butt naked is from the back and just seems to be done to show how mal-nourished he is.

I appreciated the storyline, acting, and scenery and the time went by quickly while watching the movie.  The main character has depth, while most other characters have glimmers of depth that hint at real people.  Overall - my wife and I enjoyed it!

Family friendly - 4 out of 5 - a mite tense for little eyes
Acting - 4 out of 5 - believable acting, don't remember any moments that seemed forced, nothing amazing though
Fresh addition to genre - 5 out of 5 - it is a good member of the sci-fi genre - less fictional and more believable; a decent member of the action/adventure genre - but not as action packed/adventurous as other movies out there - no intense/white knuckle moments
Storyline - 5 out of 5 - a good balance of twists and turns and a creative climax/resolution",1453248000,,1101,4.372549019607843

I worked 38 years at a NASA Center, and I am familiar with the technologies seen in the movie and talked about in the book.

The movie managed to relay the relevant details into the plot without bogging down and while still conveying the emotions Watley, the main character, expressed in the book.

7529764,3,B017S3OP7A,"Okay, I'm chapped that this was entered as a comedy in the golden globes this year.  So I'm deducting a star for that.  If you don't care that a punk marketing team at Fox didn't want to compete against it's self (see the Revenant) then by all means consider this a four star review.

It's an awful lot of suspension of reality, but it's fun, and you do root for the main character (Damon), while still feeling sorry for the decisions and circumstances that lead to yet another Matt Damon rescue plot.  How much money have we spent rescuing this guy from peril in all of his films?  Still I do find some criticism to be made here.

First:  How about if we had Matt Damon play the Chastain character and Damon play Chastain's role? Then we have a movie!  Chastain should be playing the badass.  We've seen Damon do this time and time again.  Mc Guyermon has been done, and done.  Where is the girl power?  Chastains character isn't nearly pivitol enough for this movie for the quality actress that she is.

I can's suspent reality enough to not roll my eyes while watching.  I feel like more could have been done to suspend reality successfully if they'd spent more time building a 'fifty years in the future feeling'.  Instead we are just sort of just dumped is right into the mission.  However, this movie is LONG enough at 2 hours and 21 minutes.  For a movie that long there isn't enough character immersion.  We learn a little about Jessica Chastain character's family, but nothing that I detected about Damon's.  Where is the back story about what it would be like to have a husband or father stranded on Mars? Answer: Probably on the cutting room floor.  Other movies of similar length do a much better job of character development.  It felt like the purpose of the entire film was to show off the truly amazing special effects splashed through the film than any emotion building.",1453248000,,1886,4.537091988130563

7529771,3,B017S3OP7A,"Ridley Scott is a great director, my favorite of all time being the original Alien movie. Most of his others are long, drawn out, and kind of boring actually. I was/am actually a fan of his (now deceased) brother's Tony Scott's work, as his directing eye imo is much more modern, exciting and diverse. He'll be missed. With the Martian you get one of those ""I'm stuck here, alone, how will I survive, no one knows I'm here etc."" kind of films. Which are so predictable. Much like better films like Castaway, Moon and Hours (Paul Walker). In this case some things are obvious, others aren't, which makes it work in some ways, and fail in others. The little twists are pretty good, but not enough to make it watchable another time around. Matt Damon is always good, but I like when he ""interacts"" with people a lot better. This film is far from Oscar worthy, and neither is The Revenant. I think they are/were pretty desperate for nominees this year.

The special effects are great, as Scott is very good at doing this. But the slow pace and overall lack of energy make this a one time viewing movie. Actually some of the best films are ones you've never heard of, watch the movie 99 Houses with Michael Shannon, about the housing market crash in 2010. No THAT's a great film, and his performance, along with the other young guy (who's name I don't know) is just superb. Along with a few other films I can't really rattle off right now. I hope Bridge Of Spies wins, that movie is leagues ahead of this one, in story and acting as well. Also Speilberg is still the master of the film industry. So this is OKAY, but really nothing special. Especially for any awards. I could think of many others I'd choose.

Note-One thing that I found clever and funny, was the secret meeting of Elron they had. Around a table, with Sean Bean from Lord Of The Rings actually there. As he is the flight director in the film. And for those who don't know, that's when they called the meeting to see the ""One Ring"" and argued about what to do with it, and Sean Bean wanted to use the Ring as a weapon, or a gift against the enemy. I thought he should have had more dialogue during that scene. But oh well, a great add in parody, I thought.",1453248000,3,2217,4.365617433414044
7529772,5,B017S3OP7A,We sat down to watch half of this before bed but found our backs pressed to the couch for the duration of the mission (the movie's actually about ten minutes shorter than the stated run time of 2:24.)

This is like watching what would happen if your average high school quarterback/science nerd were to be stranded on Mars. The actors playing the crew are not convincing in their concern for the guy- that interplay is weak. All in all it had about the emotional depth of Deep Impact, and the same tinges of All-American nationalism. It's a feel good commercial for NASA. I gave it three stars because it is realistic and production value is excellent. It just leaves a lot on the table in terms of what could be explored here- they need to go read some Phillip K.

7529823,4,B017S3OP7A,"Like most of the rest of the reviewers I really liked the movie and knew I would buy the blu-ray when it came out.  Many people have done a much better job than I can telling about the movie.  This is a review about the Blu-ray/DVD/ HD Digital.

The movie was just as good as I remembered it. Picture quality and sound were excellent.

EXTRAS:
1. There is a short film, about ten minutes long that is supposed to be taking place seven years after Ares III returned home.  It is done as a news interview between Teddy, Mitch, and Vincent.  They argue both sides of the Rick Purcell maneuver and why Mitch sent it and why Teddy refused to. It was interesting and fun to watch.
2. Gag reel
3. Movie trailer
4. Two other trailers that I think were outtakes.  The one with some of the crew talking with the NASA psychiatrist after two weeks in an isolation chamber. The other one was were Mark talks to school children before Hemes leaves orbit.
5. One about casting
6. One about costumes
7. HD Digital - worked like a charm with my iTunes and Apple TV

The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because there were no deleted scenes.",1453248000,2,1129,4.2924528301886795
7529824,5,B017S3OP7A,"Although an obvious remake of ""Red Planet"" and not as elegant, this is a great movie.  Nice tight writing and good acting all around including (surprisingly) Matt Daemon.  Excellent scenery and reasonable technology, though with the same flaws as the original.  Casting. would have been even better with Val Kilmer.

7529831,4,B017S3OP7A,"I wasn't expecting much for some reason (maybe Ricky Gervais' Golden Globe ribbing influenced me) but I found myself really enjoying this movie.  It reminded me that there's a reason people like Matt Damon are movie stars, it's because they draw you in and make you interested in and concerned about what they're feeling, what they're experiencing and suffering through - while simultaneously making you forget that you're watching an actor in a movie.  I found the story compelling, albeit a bit unbelievable at times - its just barely good enough to allow you to suspend disbelief in favor of buying into its universe.  One critical side note: the casting of Kristin Wiig was a lousy idea - she spent years on SNL convincing us that every minute movement of her face was a comical affect. Now she and the producers of this movie expect us to be compelled by those same affects in a dramatic context - I personally found the idea absurd and it almost ruined the movie for me except for the fact that her role is relatively small.",1453161600,,1030,4.648351648351649

7529845,2,B017S3OP7A,"Matt Damon puts on a great performance but there's something about movies that revolve around a stranded main character.  Just like Tom Hanks in Castaway, they wind up talking to themselves for most of the movie.  The dialog between the crew that left him behind is so weak that I preferred to watch Matt Damon talk to himself.  Seems like its targeted for a younger immature audience that might not notice the  characters that are supposed to be Astrophysicists and spaceship commanders are dopes---or at least their lines and acting portrays them as such.
I didn't find Jessica Chastain convincing as a Commander in this movie and come to think of it, didn't like her as a CIA agent in Zero Dark Thirty.  Formulaic, far-fetched, and it all works out in the end, hollywood style.  Good to watch with kids(I don't think there was any vulgarity--PG-13) if you need that least common denominator family movie with spoon fed drama they can grasp.",1453161600,,943,4.790123456790123

7529854,5,B017S3OP7A,"Fantastic movie and a welcome departure from the dystopian genre. The science and remaining close to plausible makes this film truly engaging.  Matt Damon was outstanding and the subtle humor made his character likeable and complex. The film is timely as the U.S. Government and many citizens have seemingly abandoned the value of science in understanding our world and making new discoveries. Seeing the people of the world rally to bring back one astronaut was moving. Maybe we should redirect our interest in reality tv and political posturing and find common ground in some sort of 21st century version of the once unifying nasa program thAt took us to the moon. Can you imagine a race to find alternative fuels that make fossil fuels obsolete and rid our planet of a fossil fuel economy?

Even if he's 'only' out of contact for a certain number of days the isolation is still very much there: absent only at a few points: obviously at the start when he's not alone, when he first makes contact (sort of), and at the poignant 'ending' with the whole world watching.

He used to be a favorite director, storyteller, although now he's just another social agenda freak.  I would like a story, not a liberal (or any politic), agenda driven, utopian way of life, that gets the job done without the narrator using me for a virtual landing pad.  Even Australopithecus would've objected to the use of such pedantic force.  Also, who's going to believe we're sending these types of astronauts into space, a NASA team headed by ""the guy that's going to put you to sleep"" official that's played very poorly by Daniel's, and that a space team is going rogue (after they already left the guy behind in the first place) to save one man while risking billions of dollars of space equipment, their own lives (which in this case isn't such a bad scenario), and court-marshal on return to earth?

7529979,2,B017S3OP7A,"One of the more overrated films I've seen in years. I enjoyed the first half hour  and computer-generated images of the Mars landscape were quite enchanting and  beautiful.  But this film bogged down in an overly long rescue mission that seemed dull in comparison with the one in Apollo 13 ( a truly great movie). The rescue was as implausible as it was boring and the characters at Houston control seemed to be phoning in their perfomances. Also all  the cheering down on Earth at venues from Times Square to China seemed like scenes from a dozen other space movies -- quite banal.  Also, it strained credulity to see the Chinese cheering on this U.S. rescue effort of an American astronaut with the same intensity as die-hard Mets fans cheering on their team during the playoffs.

As an aside, the foreign Hollywood journalists behind the Golden Globes should be deported for putting this film in the comedy category so it could get more awards. There was nothing funny about a film that took itself way too seriously, unless you liked that stale overused running joke related to Matt Damon's character being captive to disco music. In short, this overhyped film had me seeing red (planet.)",1453161600,3,1192,4.790243902439024

Matt Damon's character didn't strike me as an astronaut stranded on Mars in an impossible scenario, but more as a hollywood actor in a big hollywood movie that knows he's an actor in a big movie. The movie was also overly looooong, I think like 155 mins? All of the times that Matt had to explain to the audience what he was doing (""science the s*** out of this"", etc) became annoying and silly, but I guess constant explanation is sort of mandatory for today's ADHD populace...

Lastly, none of the characters are likable, and after about 60 mins you literally don't care if Damon's character survives or not and just want the whole thing to be over with.",1453161600,12,694,4.552

7530070,4,B017S3OP7A,"Things get crazy fast in this space movie. Or so you think by the first 3 minutes or so. Not quite. This is a 2+ hour movie, 1.5 of which seem to be a montage of Matt Damon growing potatoes and/or vlogging about growing potatoes. A lot of the plot devices and terminology seem watered down for a broader audience, which I can't say is good or bad, but I typically roll my eyes to. I rolled my eyes so much I got a headache. Childish Gambino is in this movie for some reason. Matt Damon looks ridiculous with a beard. He also signs his name as he communicates with earth, just to be sure there are no miscommunications. Moving on...

I was ready to give this about a 2 star rating, when suddenly, the climax came. All of a sudden, the pacing was frenetic, the odds were slim to none of this elaborate plan working, and all of the pieces came together. I was glued. I was invested. Things got pretty crazy out there. Then, there was a really awkwardly misplaced scene at the end to wrap it all up. ""Any questions?""",1453161600,,1012,4.243523316062176

There was really no filler as the story moved along very well and kept you in suspense for the entire movie.

7530102,2,B017S3OP7A,"Matt Damon did a great acting job, but this was one of the schlockiest movies I've seen in a long time--kind of a throwback to the ""glory days"" movies of the USA, over the top portrayal of good old American ingenuity to confront any problem and solve it--and all incredibly unbelievable, with a HORRIBLE DISCO/ABBA SOUNDTRACK. It's reactionary.
What the heck was Ridley Scott thinking? I am embarrassed by the film's inauthenticity (No one has real potatoes in outer space: all food is packaged, and the rescue was just plain silly and utterly unbelievable).
But if Scott was looking to make a film which would whip folks into a frenzy of teary patriotism, this is a good film to achieve that end.  I'm sorry, but I hate movies with such blatant and almost jingoistic manipulation of the public's emotions. I know people will hate this review because they want to stay in the warm, fuzzy glow of ""everything's great"" which the movie produces.",1453161600,,942,4.779141104294479

7530107,3,B017S3OP7A,I would have given this movie 4 or 5 stars if they didn't resort to intentionally getting the science and physics wrong in parts of the movie in order to create reason for the story to have an unforeseen possible disaster so that Mark would have to be left behind. The NASA character that said they can remove the windows in the space capsule and just cover that area with a plastic tarp even pointed out that the atmosphere  was so thin that it wouldn't matter. What I am pointing out is that due to the very thin CO2 atmosphere the high winds on Mars will stir up dust but would not have enough force to tip over the spacecraft the crew was taking off in or blow a antenna off it's ground anchoring.  There are other examples of this in the movie thats just put in to create some excitement. This sound like writer's block or Hollywood meddling. Another glaring mistake was Mark making fertilizer out of the other crew members feces without first sterilizing it. That's a good way to get very sick or dead. My point is that this movie was promoted as being one that gets the science right and I think with a little more effort on the writer's part that could have been true.,1453161600,,1176,4.340909090909091

Ok, a few things wouldn't pass the high school physics test. Spoiler alert!! Replacing a blown hatch with plastic sheeting and duct tape, and then repressurizing the station, is absolutely ridiculous. And replacing the nose cone of the MAV rocket with a plastic tarp and bungee cords, and surviving a trip into orbit with that? Come on. But those outbursts of lunacy were relatively few, compared with your Star Trek and Star Wars movies, which don't even make an attempt to be plausible. But I digress!

7530166,5,B017S3OP7A,"The movie is great. 5 stars. The rest of this review is about the special features, for those interested.

The special features were underwhelming. Here they are:

Gag Reel - 7m 34s of typical gag reel.
Ares III: Farewell - 3m 36s of ""Mark Watney"" interviewing the ""crew"" prior to their departure to Mars.
The Right Stuff - 3m 21s of a ""psychologist"" interviewing the ""crew"" prior to departure.
Ares: Our Greatest Adventure - 3m 39s of Neil deGrasse Tyson doing a ""Cosmos"" bit in 2035 about the Ares mission.
Leave Your Mark - 1m 04s Under Armour commercial staring Mark Watney.
Bring Him Home - 1m 36s of people rooting for Watney's successful return all over the world.

The first 4 are entertaining enough. The last 2 are worthless. All but the first can currently be found on ""ARES: live"" youtube channel.

No behind the scenes or making of. No interviews with cast, director, screenwriter, author, or anybody at all. No commentary. :(",1453075200,,939,4.7073170731707314

Matt Damon really shined in what was mostly a solo performance. However, some of the other actors were exceptional as well. Jeff Daniels for example was perfectly cast. Visually, this movie was stunning. Sort of combined the sleek modern day film making with the old school Alien vibe. I found the story to be completely engaging and immersive, and I hardly noticed that 2 1/2 hours had passed watching this. Also, they get the little things right regarding the science behind what they portray in this movie. That attention to even the most minute of details really pushed this movie over the top.

But using his brain and basic physics he's able to find away. Matt Damon did an excellent job acting in the movie as he usually does. I loved his characters funny sense of humor and good attitude during the grim situation he was in. It keeps you on your toes during some of the suspenseful scenes. The only thing that disappointed me was some of the special effects could have been done a little better. But regardless of that is was still a must see.

I haven't watched a movie this great in at least 10 years, least to say I was pretty impressed!  Not only is the storyline great, and the filming is pretty good, but they're also actual science to this which makes it even better.  My wife actually told me to pause the film in the middle of it so she could ask me if The Martian was based on a true story!  She said that she was pretty sure that she would have heard if we sent a manned mission to Mars, but the story is so believable that it seems likely that it had already happened.  I have to admit she's right.  While I know the entire story is science fiction, there's a lot more science than fiction to it.  It all seems so real, that I found myself thinking about the movie for days after I saw it.  So like I said, this is a great movie, and will go down in history as one of the classics.

In a theater they have a captive audience but the stupidity of this opening would still register.
4/9 My wife ordered this from Netflix without being aware of my disgust at the opening.  After that it's not too bad, but now we're at the point where the airlock blows off.  The reason it blows off is because in a nearby previous scene someone says ""if nothing goes wrong.""  There is no real-world reason why it would blow off, so this is another black mark.  If the Yakuza reviewed this picture someone would be missing a finger.

7530333,3,B017S3OP7A,"""The Martian"" has its moments, but it is unrealistic at key points, and ultimately overrated.  The film (as well as the book) missed an opportunity to effectively explore the range of human emotions that would no doubt confront someone left behind on a desolate planet, and the result is a one-dimensional character that is difficult to care about.  This was perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the story.  Since all the other characters are also one-dimensional, however, this was easy to overlook.  It's time for science fiction to dispense with the hackneyed young, eccentric genius character, and offer audiences something more substantial (to give just one example among many, the millennial from the JPL who is too brilliant to know he is pitching his (utterly obvious) ""slingshot"" idea to the Administrator of NASA is a scene sequence that is nothing short of  ridiculous).

If you can suspend disbelief for almost 2-1/2 hours, and can lower your expectations far enough, then you'll like ""The Martian"".  If, however, you ask a bit more from science fiction (or just films/books more generally), then the experience is a mediocre one.  You're not asked to think too much in this film, and as long as you can accept that, the film is fine.",1453075200,,1250,4.975961538461538

7530389,4,B017S3OP7A,"I was interested in the movie primarily because I loved the book by Andy Weir.  Often when a book I like is made into a film I am disappointed in the corresponding film as it either veers to far away from the original story line of the book or changes or eliminates key characters.  In the case of The Martian, I was pleasantly surprised how closely the movie followed the book.  Obviously the film makers did make changes, especially with regard to the roles of the Hermes crew during the rescue scene at the end of the film.  On balance, they kept it close enough that I  just sat back and enjoyed the film without wondering why they changed so many things from the book I enjoyed.  The other thing I think the film got right was the casting, especially Matt Damon as Mark Watney.  He exactly captured the humorous stoicism of the Watney character from the book.  If you loved the book you'll enjoy this movie.",1453075200,,912,4.419161676646707

I saw the film in the cinema when it came out, and I recall subtitles then, but they left them off the DVD copy.  It did result in my family momentarily believing that I had become fluent in another language when I ""translated"" that portion of the film for them based on what I remembered from seeing it the first time which was kind of fun.

When the rover was traveling across the trackless sands on its way to Ares IV, it reminded me of Bradbury's characters exploring a friendlier Mars.

7530577,5,B017S3OP7A,"The Martian is a rousing-good SF adventure/survival story, Cast Away on a desert planet instead of deserted island. I give it high marks for scientific accuracy and general credibility, although a couple of details need to be overlooked, and a couple of willing suspensions of disbelief are called for, if the film is to be fully enjoyed. (Regarding my use of the term ""SF"" rather than ""sci-fi"": If you don't understand the difference, watch ""The Martian"", ""Gravity"", ""Avatar"", or ""Interstellar"" and then any of the ""Star Wars"" films and you'll understand.)

First, the most implausible conceit regards the central crisis of the story: That a Martian storm ever generates wind speeds such that the thin atmospheres momentum would be enough to topple the Mars missions upright return ship and require an unplanned termination of the mission on literally a few minutes' noticeor, more directly, that NASA would ever make the crews ascent rocket vulnerable to a storm whose intensity is such that it has more than a vanishingly small chance of occurring in that spot within a length of time equal to the missions ground stay. (No reveals hereyouve all seen the trailers, and the event occurs very early in the film, too early, in factsee below.) Or am I wrong, and did NASA areologists check off on this point?

Second, the Ares mission base is downright magnificent, as are the ground vehicles and the Hermes spaceship that transfers the crew from Earth to Mars and back. The cost of the base and the mission, in current dollars, would be in the hundreds of billions, and as we learn, this mission, Ares III, is what appears to be the third in a series of at least six planned missions. That one nation, even the U.S., could devote this kind of money to Mars missions in any plausible 21st-Century geopolitical and global economic scenario is beyond belief. Its something that we SF fans and science supporters can only fantasize about.

Third, as we soon learn, the planned mission length on the surface is a mere 31 days! A mission costing a good chunk of a trillion dollars, and lasting a couple of years overall, for a single month at destination? A manned Mars landing mission involving one or two astronauts in a basic shelter might plausibly last for this short a period, perhaps even less. But for the magnitude of effort, and the cost, of the relatively huge installation that is Ares III, a single month seems ridiculously short. Worse, it would appear (since the unmanned preparatory landings of the Ares IV mission have already been made thousands of km away) that the Ares III installation was only intended to be used once. So, hundreds of billions, perhaps a trillion, dollars for a mission with a robust base and big surface vehicles, all of which were meant to be used just once and only for a month. That definitely does not add up, nor even resonate with the fantasies of fans of human planetary exploration. For us, its a gratingly unconscionable, and improbable, waste of money, resources, effort, and opportunityand completely lacking in credibility. Just for starters, if a single astronaut can science the s*** outta this and cobble together a potato garden that will sustain him, NASA could certainly have provided a mission with the capability of sustaining a crew for a year or two. (Leave aside the amusing thought that NASA would have sent bins of fresh spuds, rather than dehydrated powder or freeze-dried slices. This is what dramatic license is for!)

But besides the survival story, the saga of the rescue mission (which may or may not be successfulno spoilers hereor involve the tragedy of the sort that desperate rescue missions often seem to require) makes for great tech-oriented SF as well as grippingly tense high adventure, especially since its a given that that sort of thing never goes smoothly. The intellectual flowering of the rescue plan(s) and their multinational implementation are superbly well done, though the idea that verifying the practicality of one idea required a lone wolf to poach time on NASA's lovely Pleiades supercomputer cluster (an actual thing) is a bit more dramatic licensethe calculations could have been done on a laptop.

The production values are lush, and the sets and props breathtaking. NASA personnel must be drooling with envy at the thought of having such technologically munificent apparatus. Id like to know where the inspiration for just the appearance and the phenomenal detail of the equipment, the low-pressure suits, and the interiors and equipment of the Ares base and the Hermes came from; its utterly convincing. The photography, and/or CGI, of the surface of Marsfrom a foot or two away to stunning landscapes spanning milesare jawdropping and totally acceptable as the real thing. I imagine they were constructed at least in part from NASA data and images from Mars, although the credits reveal a large second-unit operation in Jordan, perhaps at the Wadi Ramm of ""Lawrence of Arabia"". Im going to reveal myself as a dinosaur, but I only have to think back to my adolescence to remember how laughably primitive, even then, spacecraft and alien landscapes looked in SF movies and TV shows.

If theres one non-technical complaint, or objection to something other than implausible scenarios, its in the development of the characters. Its disappointing that this SF tale is so predictably shallow in this respect. The Martian bears striking parallels to Cast Awayan accident stranding an individual who must rely on his wits and his scarce resources to stay alive in a spare and unforgiving environment while hoping for a rescue that comes to look less and less likely, then a desperate, do-or-die leap into the unknown. They both even have a coda following the resolution (however that may occur) of the crisis, and are almost exactly the same length at about 2h 23 min. But Cast Away devoted a significant length of screen time at the beginning to establish the personality and backstory of the principal character, and gave him depth and humanity. Not that Matt Damon didn't do an excellent job of putting spirit and character into the persona of Mark Watney, especially through the device of a video diary that the marooned astronaut keeps from Day 1 (or Sol 1) of his ordeal, but Id have appreciated having 20 minutes or so cannibalized from other sequences and devoted to developing some foundation for Watney and at least one of the other principals, specifically the mission commander (whom, being played by the luminous Jessica Chastain, I wanted to know EVERYTHING about, and see way more of!)

There are interesting complexities and subtleties that I haven't hinted at, things that give extra dimensions to the story than mere technological crises and inventiveness, creations of talented writers and an inspired director as well as many fine performances on the part of an outstanding cast (Sean Bean kind of does a Ned Stark with stolid heroism while more powerful people of lesser character remain unscathed), and many more reasons to see it than to find fault with it. Do so, and then contemplate what NASA could accomplish as a partner with ESA, Russia, China, Japan, and India in a non-confrontational world where half of the economic activity didn't go to the military and welfare.",1452988800,,7283,4.95986895986896

I didn't think that they needed to change the ethnicities of the characters since it was already very multicultural.  While I understand the desire to complete the circle of the commander""losing her man"" and then ""reclaiming her man"", that's not the commander's job.  The book appropriately addressed this, so it seem contrived to have the commander risk her entire crew to go get Mark herself.

I have no idea who casted Mr. Pea and Mr. Bean for this movie, same goes for Ms. Mara and Mr. Glover, they all looked out of it most of the time.  Some of the elements were the recycles of Ridley's Prometheus that was stellar in my opinion. The last scenes from the movie spoiled everything, especially the explosion and the puncturing of the glove in an open space. Anyone who listened to the lectures in the Astronomy class, which would be very few of us LOL, knows that doing so in an open space would bring forth pretty dire consequences. Is it worth the 5.99 rental price on Amazon? In my opinion it does not, should be a direct release to Netflix where folks can watch it for flat monthly fee.",1452988800,,799,4.222222222222222

  Directing was cookie cutter right down to the cutaway's of people smiling and nodding yes. The Ares III Hermes crew seemed more like a bunch of corporate yuppies then real astronauts and scientists (not like the book). Very flat and weak character interaction at NASA ground control (again not like the book). The Mars imagery was verygood but Mark Watney's story line and resourcefulness was nothing compared to the original story.  Poor editing as the film was hard to follow and important informational content was distilled down into a flashy, meaningless short montage with incredibly predictable music.  However, good way to spend a rainy afternoon if you have nothing better to do. Hard to understand from guy who did Blade Runner, Black Hawk Down and Alien.

While there were some interesting and innovative sequences in the film, too much of it was predictable, dragged along a snail's pace with few surprises and didn't have enough substance to hold my undivided attention. I made it through to the end, which I had been looking forward to well before it actually came - they could have left twenty minutes to half-hour on the cutting room floor without adversely affecting the story - but I doubt I'll be recommending it to friends or watching it again",1452988800,,736,4.583333333333333

What put it over the top was that it had no raunchy sex or raunchy language. It disappoints me to spend money on a movie and have to turn it off after a few minutes because it has unnecessary foul language and content.

7530921,5,B017S3OP7A,"I recently read an article that calculated how much money it would have cost (in today's dollars) to rescue Matt Damon from his movies if they were in real life.  Apparently the government would have had to spend upwards of $900,000,000 to rescue him from his movies to date.  It's a good thing Matt's worth it, because a lesser actor would have had his *ss left on Mars.  To give the word of mouth summary of the Cliff's Notes, this movie was fantastic.  At one point I was worried that Matt might become a bit unhinged and start talking to a piece of sporting equipment, but no, he kept it together and put in a great performance.  I do have to say, however, that the visuals of the red Mars are almost enough to upstage him, because they are exactly what a layman like myself imagines the barren deserts to look like.  All in all, The Martian is a fun and surprisingly uplifting movie, following in the tradition of other fun space movies that include The Right Stuff and even Space Cowboys.  And once again, Matt Damon put in a performance that reminds the viewer just why we keep rescuing him.",1452902400,,1098,4.432835820895522

Of course, all movies are based on some form of drama, such as man against man, or man against nature.  Of course, this is really about man using science to stay alive, while battling one of the most inhospitable places for humans - space. The pressure on Mars is 150 that of earth (14.7 psi), and the pressure on Mars would kill a human in approximately one minute, when fully exposed.  It was interesting to see the pressure, temperature, and oxygen icons displayed on his instruments.  Very spaceadelic, indeed. I also noticed how China helped the NASA in this film, but this is inaccurate, due to obvious security concerns, and from a personal nature, their technology is horrible, and they still produce junk, and I think it would hamper our rescue efforts if indeed this was the case. Another aspect of the movie that was right on, was the structure of government, with bureaucrats running the show, like the Alpha Male, (Jeff Daniels - excellent performance) bowing to his superiors and so on down the line.  I also liked the young astrodynamics student, with no social skills, trying to explain his theory for the rescue attempt.

Also, from the very first minute of the movie, you are in no doubt about where it's going to end.

(2) Invent some science to resolve it.

I confess.  Most movies get me teary eyed from the release of tension at the end.  It doesn't matter how bad the movie is.  Put the characters in a dangerous situation and I tear up at the end.  This one did *nothing* for me.

Producers might think twice about whom they cast in what role. I found Jeff Daniels to be a distraction. From the way he was dressed and talking, I was expecting him to reprise his character from The Newsroom.  He didn't.

Small spoiler alert ('cause it's so early in the movie):

I mean, you already know Matt Damon is going to be stranded on Mars. Damon is impaled by a piece of antenna in the stomach area. (Not too thick.  Think automobile antenna.)  He pulls it out, does surgery on himself, and staples himself closed.  One might expect some damage due to having his stomach punctured, but its strictly comic book stuff.  Next scene it's like he was never injured.  No infection, no nothin'.

All the scenes are like that.

The ONLY reason I did not award one star is that he was  NOT stranded from doing something (like grab some scientific equipment) while everyone else is urging him to get back to the ship.",1452816000,9,1290,4.398305084745763

I found it dull because it felt very predictable and anti-climatic. It just didn't resonate with me.

7531010,5,B017S3OP7A,"Ridley Scott is a very creative director .He has a boat load of wonderful ,bankable films in his resume which I have enjoyed immensely. The primary and secondary cast members are proven actors ,also with great resumes to flash. The writing staff has created a very exciting,thrilling script. Just like most of the critics have expressed The Martian is 2 plus hours of thrills and great entertainment. It has the whole gambit of human emotions. Lets start with the obvious emotions. Survival instinct, guilt, self sacriface, desire not to give up on life where there is breath, and the need for cooperation among competing groups. There is also and a dab of political intrigue.
HOWEVER, I don't see this in the world that I am living in. NOW let me do something I like to do when watching a film. I like to see if there is anything in the film I just watched that I can relate to. In the last week I have watched 2 massive stock markets representing 100's of millions of peoples quality of life drop like stones. Where is the cooperation among these two great countries. Yes The Martian is a movie which isn't reality but If you ask people about what this film projects we are back to the issues of sacriface, survival and Cooperation. This is art not immitating life. As this film is a feel good movie in that the human spirit can endure almost anything and overcome the implausible. It would be wonderful if this is an accurate or even a hopeful representation of how it is. It is true that there are individuals that have overcome extreme adversity in spite of obstacles placed before them. That is similar to this exciting film. In reality for most of us the obstacles that are presented to which we must overcome many times are insurmountable.  Not because the desire isn't there but the cooperation among the outside forces just are not there. Apolla 13 with Tom Hanks also showed what can be down when we work together to accomplish what seems to be the impossible. WE NEED FILMS LIKE THESE TO REMIND US OF WHAT CAN BE DONE WHEN WE REACH DOWN AND FIND THAT EXTRA MEASURE THAT WILL GET US THROUGH. IN EACH CASE THERE IS STILL THE NEED FOR THE OUTSIDE INFLUENCES TO GET US THERE BY COOPERATION,COMPASSION, AND THE WILLINGNESS TO EXTEND OURSELVES . KEEPING THE GOAL IN THE FOREFRONT WITHOUT REGARD TO POLITICS OR WHO WILL FINANCIAL BENEFIT AND WHO WILL SUFFER AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS. IN The Martian everyone is focused upon one goal. Save the stranded botanist without regard to the consequences of their actions. If life was only like this film.
It is a film of great entertainment and if you care to look deeper a film that can challenge you to see what really controls the survival of other human beings. I allowed Scott and Goddard to let me see beyond the story on the screen and make the transfer to real survival issues. I could have just taken the film for a feel good ride. But there is so much more in our lives that seems to be out of our control. Just because we want to survive does't mean that we will. Our protanganist decides ""I will make it no matter what it takes "" But we would be very naive to believe that will alone is enough. Even with his skills and determination he is doomed unless outside forces come into play. As stated earlier these forces are from first those nearest him. This spreads to outside agencies and then to other nations. The world awaits his rescue. And we the watcher are cheering and hopeful too. We are not on Mars but we also are stranded with either disease , financial burdens that are not of our making or severe family issues. Can these be worked out with just desire and a willingness to fight on. Of course not. We run into obstacles that cannot be overcome. The sum of our lives has come down to the willingness of medical centers. insurance companies ,legislation or just horrible diseases which we find ourselves no matter how we fight on we cannot overcome without help. So it comes down to THE MARTIAN is a fairy tale with few exceptions. Maybe that is what we need. So I root along and try to stay hopeful for all of us.(I know this was a little heavy review/comment but some films just bring us there as this did for me).",1452816000,,4190,4.469973890339426

7531020,5,B017S3OP7A,"I found ""The Martian"" to be thoroughly enjoyable.  I didn't get to see it in the theater but did watch the Blu-ray version as soon as it came out two days ago; and it exceeded all my expectations.  The fundamental plot was reminiscent of the classic ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars,"" where an astronaut has survive alone on Mars until rescue comes, although of course the older film predated a lot of scientific knowledge we have now and didn't have nearly the budget or CGI technology.  Of course there are a few technical nits such as the saturation of color and force of wind on Mars, but nothing that threw me out of the story.  (For me, that's saying a lot.  I spent more than three decades as an engineer in manned space flight at the Johnson Space Center in fight crew training, crew systems, and EVA development.  The technical accuracy of this film knocked my socks off.)

All the cast delivered great performances with a minimal amount of the inevitable poplib politics that could easily have spoiled the film.  Computer-generated imagery was integrated seamlessly; I really couldn't see where the practical sets ended and CGI started, though of course I'm sure there was a lot of CGI through the film.  Cinematography and editing were really outstanding work; I didn't even think about them until the story was over.

Sadly, the portrayal of internal NASA meetings where you see risk-averse bureaucrats making decisions that the crew and engineers disagree with was all too representative of my own real-life work experience.  The notion of a new space race was more of a stretch from current reality than my mind could cope with, but I was willing to accept it for the sake of a great story.  This is science fiction, after all.

On a personal note, Sean Bean's appearance, character, and demeanor in this film kept reminding me of my old boss, Bob Overmyer, who flew on STS-5 and STS-51B.  The resemblance was uncanny.  If anyone ever makes a film about Overmyer's life and career (which could be great cinema), and if Bean can do an American jarhead pilot's accent, he'd be a perfect choice for the role.",1452729600,22,2111,4.729508196721311

7531026,3,B017S3OP7A,"Odd that everyone is raving about the acting in this film. Yes, it is a good idea to watch the survival of a lone man on another planet, but the acting and the dialogue are so flat line and the actors seem so uninvolved with this read-through of a script that after a while all the fancy special effects even get more interesting than the story. Some are remarking how far better Andy Weirs book is in comparison, but even Ridley Scott has slow moments in trying to keep this space venture airborne.

The story (brief as it is)  During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring ""the Martian"" home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible, rescue mission. As these stories of incredible bravery unfold, the world comes together to root for Watney's safe return.

The cast includes such winning actors as Michael Pea, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain, Kate Mara, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean and others but there is little to no development of their characters until the very end. Jump on if you must see every movie that is nominated for best film/actor but be aware this tale goes on for well past 2 hours in length. Grady Harp, January 16",1452729600,7,1577,4.625

7531037,5,B017S3OP7A,"""The Martian"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew. But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet.

The cast led by Matt Damon (in a superb performance as Mark Watney) is brilliant. The directing by Ridley Scott (who also produced) is brilliant. The screenplay (based on Andy Weir's novel) by Drew Goddard (who also executive produced) is brilliant.

The music by Harry Gregson-Williams is brilliant. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is brilliant. The film editing by Pietro Scalia is brilliant. The casting by Carmen Cuba & Nina Gold is brilliant. The production design by Arthur Max is brilliant. The costume design by Janty Yates is brilliant. The art direction by Jonathan Houlding, Mark Swain, Huw Arthur, Robert Cowper, Monika Esztan, Marc Homes, Samy Keilani, Jason Knox-Johnston, Laszlo Rajk, Phil Sims, Stefan Speth & Matt Wynne is brilliant. The set decoration by Celia Bobak & Zoltan Horvath, set dressings by Pal Csicsman, Tamas Gal, Tibor Gaal, Zsolt Kovacs, Csaba Mitku, Imre Sandor, Tamas Simon, Viktor Bakos & Gabor Papp is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Rob Inch is brilliant. The special effects supervised by Neil Corbould & Steven Warner is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Sara Bennett, Justin Cornish, James D.

This is a brilliant, well-crafted and entertaining film that is well-done. Matt Damon gives one of his best performances as Mark Watney and his supporting cast led by Jessica Chastain (as Melissa Lewis) is brilliant. Ridley Scott has made one of his best films to date. This is one of the best films of the last year and one of the best films of the recently done fall season.

7531042,5,B017S3OP7A,"I read the book a few months ago and really liked it. I was a bit hesitant about the movie because the book has so much detail, I knew the movie just could not have it all. It'd take a 4-6 hour movie for that, but folks with short attention spans kind of messes it up for those of us who want to wallow in every little detail.

Nevertheless, Ridley Scott managed to pull in enough of the information to make an excellent movie. In the vein of 2001: Space Odyssey rather than Star Wars, this isn't a kid film. Take the young 'uns to something else. However, if you're a serious SF loving adult, this is just right.

7531065,1,B017S3OP7A,"This is the soonest any science fiction movie has been blown out of the noisy vacuum by Science.  Many such movies were only trashed for their scientific mistakes decades after they appeared.  NASA just announced that water is in the soil, and just heat to extract.  Super windstorms do not happen on Mars with its thin atmosphere--certainly not ones of 1000 mph hurricane speed.  Read almost any encyclopedia of sci-fi and you will find pseudo-learned critiques of such 1950's classics as RXM.  Most of those critics had not seen the movie-in-question in years and so got many plot points horribly wrong.  But now we have a new movie-- I just watched the 2-D Blu-ray-- whose director and star DARE US to disagree that THE MARTIAN is a Great ORIGINAL Story.  Well, apparently those Hollywood insiders never saw ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS or RED PLANET or any of a dozen or so other Mars invasion movies.  Okay, maybe they just did not know of written science fiction, such as FIRST ON MARS whose original cover art shows an astronaut riding a self-made bicycle across the Martian surface.  Yes, things break, but here we have Hollywood puffery taken to new heights with Matt Damon in the EXTRAS and the script tagged with I'M GONNA SCIENCE THE SH*T OUT OF THIS PLANET.  Sorry guys, all 10,000 workers in several different countries, but the real Mars is a lot less bright and colorful.  It took years for NASA to admit that they too faked the Red Planet to look a lot redder in the first photos from Viking so that The Public would not be disappointed.  (I worked on the Viking landing radar.)  But that is okay.  RXM put a red filter in front of the projector during the Mars sequences.  (The clouds looked gorgeous.)  I have no gripe with the incredible CGI and wirework and cameras--GoPro is fantastic, I find as a user--and appreciate the tropes and memes too.  Every Mars movie has to have Comic Relief in the form of a joking sidekick.  Must have one or more beautiful women, smart and now in the Commander rank.  (RXM was way ahead of its time with its female chemist onboard who was better at math than the Captain.)  Finally, this is a movie whose main shock is NOT that Murphy's Law still works in space, but that bragging from The Star and The Director are so in-your-face.  Maybe Murphy's Law is in effect there too:  if anything CAN go wrong, it WILL go wrong, and at the WORST POSSIBLE TIME.  This is no 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY:  the sound effects of rockets in space really go back to the ancient-movie scientific error of LOUD ROARING SOUNDS TRAVEL IN VACUUM.  No, not an OOPS, just homage to STAR WARS to let the audience know what to think.  But at least there is no giggling unseen aliens and/or discovered lost civilizations.  2001 went against the author's wishes about having an evil computer on board.  Here the author of the book is pleased-as-punch at what Hollywood has done.  Admittedly, it would be hell to go back, as was done with CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, and NOT fix things that are bad science but just tack on a new ending.  But maybe the Studio could edit the B.S. about Science and the Great Original Story.  Another possibility is that THE MARTIAN might be sued.  It happened to ALIEN and K-PAX years ago.

I hope we'll get a director's cut or deluxe edition down the line. But don't let that stop you buying this version.

7531083,5,B017S3OP7A,"This film is Ridley Scott's ode to science, a romance between man and science and what the duo can achieve when great minds work together to solve human problems. Mark Watney isn't just an astronaut he is the combination of everything the human mind and spirit has ever conquered. This is a smart, at times funny, harrowing and always awe inspired. The film is clear that it is not god or religion that will save us but our collective knowledge, applied sciences and human cooperation, this is highlighted in a scene where our man Watney is examining a wooden crucifix, left by a fellow crew member, not because he was thinking of god, or praying for god to get him out of his dire situation but because the object turns out to be useful for one of his life saving projects.  The characters are rich and nuanced and the actors are perfectly cast. Matt Damon put on one of his best performances since Bourne Identity.

It had it's share of ""technospeak"" which provided additional fun for an old retired engineer like myself. This Ridley Scott film adaptation  with a couple alterations  certainly does deliver Andy Weirs story to the silver screen. Seeing how Amazon has provided so few product details, the insert to the singledisc DVD release offers the following description;
------------
Matt Damon in his best performance ever leads a stellar cast in this breathtaking scifi adventure from legendary director Ridley Scott [Alien, Prometheus] based on the #1 New York Times bestselling novel. During a manned mission to Mars, American astronaut [Damon] is presumed dead and left behind by his crew. But Watney is still alive, and he must now find a way to contact Earth  and survive on a barren planet with meager supplies  in the hope that an international team of scientists can devise a nearimpossible rescue plan to bring him home!

This packages shows that you claim your code for iTunes and UltraViolet, but what it doesn't say on the packaging is that you can only redeem it for one. Once you put that code in, it looks like you can select your preferred providers like iTunes and Vudu, but in reality, it only activates one of those (look like mutliselect on the mobile site, but it is more like radio button options) and you are out of luck for the other format.

7531094,5,B017S3OP7A,"I just finished watching this film and it is like a breath of fresh air after all the Science Fiction films I have watched lately. Science Fiction asks the question ""What if ?"" and proceeds to show what happens then. We have had few films that really explore the reality of space travel based on what we currently know scientifically. ""Red Planet""  and ""Mission to Mars"" provide elements that are used in this film to good effect. The escape from Mars via a spacecraft that was there from a previous mission and the rendezvous and capture of the same by a passing space craft. The cinematography is excellent.

I take a moment to salute ""David Bowie"" whose song ""Star man"" is one of the non-disco tracks used in the movie. It is prophetic that he just passed away yesterday and here his music is in the first DVD I watch after seeing his obituary in the paper.

I don't want to spoil the viewers experience by revealing the plot so I'll just say this is a very good and entertaining film which shows what we could still achieve in space if we decided to devote the resources necessary.

I really thought that when I first saw 2001 we would be based on the moon and exploring the planets by now. We did land on the moon in 1969 and if we had kept up the pace of space exploration we could be doing what this movie shows, now, instead of ?",1452556800,,1337,4.314741035856573

Many books and films of this sort lose themselves in attempting existential contemplation of the vastness of the universe when compared to puny human concerns, while others fall back on luck and pluck. THE MARTIAN goes an entirely different route. The protagonist uses specific and very human skills and scientific knowledge to make the best he can of a seemingly impossible situation. He's backed up by a sizable contingent of other smart and dedicated people who think that space exploration is important but who retain their sense of proportion. Somewhat surprisingly, there's a fair amount of situational humor. In the film, Matt Damon proves once again that he's the go-to actor of his generation when the ability to combine intelligence with action is needed.",1452470400,2,833,5.087591240875913

Star Wars is more believable.  And, while this movie is funny in spots, this is not a comedy... not even a dramedy... it is a straight up sci fi drama.

The cinematography is so incredible I cannot imagine that those responsible do not win many awards in related categories.

The cast is diverse and fantastic.  Matt Damon has never been better and fewer actors have delivered a better performance.  He takes this film and carries it with ease.  My only regret with this film is that the closest IMAX theater to me only ran it for a single week and I was unable to make the 2 hour trip because of other commitments.  I love this film.

7531148,5,B017S3OP7A,"Great computer generated effects! ""The Martian"" is a movie to watch if you like predictions of what the future of Space exploration and interplanetary exploration on mars will possibly look like and what Astronauts be challenged with.

As for the plot, ""The Martian"" appears like a realistic, original, and very smart movie, but the audience knows the whole time someone was left left for dead, and more importantly completely left behind because of a accident in a sand storm. From the first introduction of the characters and plot, there is this lost crew member. Considering the highly technical space program presented, it seems somewhat superficial someone just gets left for dead within minutes of the crew also leaving Mars to return to planet Earth.

That accident greatly clouded how smart the crew and NASA appear in the movie from the audiences point of view. As a result it is possible NASA and the crew never really appear that smart again. The result of just simply leaving their own dead crew member, even though they create an elaborate solution to communicate with the survivor, and a very elaborate space search and rescue, does not really seem forgiveable in the real world or even in fictional movie.

But, the left for dead scenario can add to the survivor's story, and if anyone likes survivor genre movies this is exactly that. Being a survivor creates that needed challenge for the hero to overcome communication problems, and overcome the lack of supplies. So as being a survivor seems like a staged hardship for the plot to develop seeming fake, it also presents the questons of how would someone communicate and replentish their supplies.

NASA and the crew do finally rescue their stranded crew member, but literally years later. The survivor is reduced physically and mentally to the reality of the environment on Mars, but he does survive.

Overall, it is rated 5 stars. It is a good movie for its entertainment, while showing the more basic issues of surviving on another planet. The complications on Mars are presented to be nothing like survival on Earth. People on Earth can call on a phone for a ride to  be picked up almost anywhere in the world, or use another form to signal for help if a phone is not available. Hopefully, someone will respond a lot faster to a call for help on Earth than years later in needing help on Mars.

But, Earth has its weather disasters and man made disasters as well, and when neglected have been causing long lasting delays in basic humanitarian relief. Sadly, disasters on Earth still have not been managed as well as they could. Please consider the downed communication lines, which have been furthering continuos preventable damage from becomming under control in advance. That is also possibly a reason for including the Mars sand storm in ""The Martian"", as a possible example of an unpredictable challenge for future Astronauts on an interplanatary exploration. Interplanetary weather forecasting is the next great science experiment along with the privatized race into Space.

Finally, its a great movie bringing up many discussions about interplanetary space exploration, and the issue of the need for search and rescues in Space. Search and rescue is something to know about whether in Space on Mars, or while aimlessly assumed dead on Mars,  and lost somewhere on Earth.

""The Martian"" also has some interesting action sequences which unbelievably does not have a single crash. Very interesting and hopeful outlook regarding overcoming challenges in Space and on Mars!",1452297600,,3546,4.994915254237288
7531149,3,B017S3OP7A,"The Martian is the story of a man rescued after he was accidentally stranded on Mars by his teammates.  It is a great story.  The astronaut, Mark Watney, goes through a lot of difficult times in trying to survive and he does it with a great sense of humor.  What else can he do?  I really, really, really enjoyed the Audible.com version of the story over the movie version, and R.C. Bray who read all the parts, did a fantastic job, carrying all the parts with just the right amount of humor, sarcasm and disbelief in his voice characterizations.  No put down of Matt Damon, but he was not Mark Watney.  R.C. Bray should have gotten the part.  Having said that, I could only give the movie 3 Stars, mainly because the acting was lame, but they CHANGED the ending.  The story was dramatic itself, if you read both the book ( I read the Kindle version) and listened to the Audible.com versions, and the ending in book was much better.  I would recommend these two versions over the movie.  Thanks, Mark",1452297600,,1000,4.445054945054945

7531158,5,B017S3OP7A,"His name is Mark Watney, and hes an astronaut on a mars mission.  When a freak storm comes up out of the blue, his team needs to evacuate, right away.  A freak accident causes him to be blown away and his suit is reported as breached.  Admitting to the worse, his crew makes the difficult decision to leave his body behind  he is beyond saving in the low pressure and freezing temperature of Mars.

But he has against all odds survived.  The puncture in his suit was sealed, by his explanation, by the coagulation of his own blood from the wound he sustained when he was impaled by something sharp.  He awakens on a cold, red planet to find his only means home, gone.  His crew, gone.  No access to NASA, Earth, or anyone at all that might be able to save him.

Because of the storm, the 30 day mission he and the other 5 members of his crew were a part of was terminated early.  This gives him some supplies  5 peoples worth for the rest of the month, and the habitation unit which was never taken down.  But  the next mission to mars isn't schedule for another four earth years.  There is no way his meager supplies can last that long.

Determined to not lose this fight, Mark employs his extensive knowledge of botany, a surprise stash of potatoes sent up vacuum packed for the crews Thanksgiving feast, and out of the box thinking to solve immediate and long term problems with his survival.  Against all odds, he continues, day after day, to make Mars work for him.

I think it will be hard to continue without giving away more of the movie plot, and I so hate spoliers.  If you are a fan of science fiction, suspense, drama, Matt Damon  you will not regret watching this movie.  It was intense at times, light hearted at other times, and gives you a warm feeling of what human beings are capable of when it comes to survival.  I practically cheered at the end and I cant wait to watch it again with my husband.

Also, this movie has spawned a ton of delightfully funny memes about how much America has spent retrieving Matt Damon in all his movies  from Saving Private Ryan, to Interstellar, to The Martian.  The estimate from one fellow with a bit too much time on his hands, was $900B, across all movies he was saved in (some of which I haven't seen  I know what Ill be doing this weekend!).  Its actually quite funny when you think about it.  I never thought of Matt Damon as type-cast, but maybe he has been, if all we are doing is rescuing him?",1452211200,,2455,4.324561403508772
7531159,5,B017S3OP7A,"I didn't know anything about this movie and watched it. It was very good, have no idea about the book, so I cant compare it. Its a great movie to watch and Matt Damon is funny in it. Dont analyze this movie too much, its fun, just watch it.",1452211200,,240,3.9183673469387754

Well the only part we didn't like was when Mark Whatney got out of the shower naked.  They put it in the movie to show how skinny he was, and all they showed was his back side, but my kid and I both said gross.  That is the only part of the movie that sucked, and a few f-bombs here and there.  Besides that it was a great movie that has my kids and I really hoping we can send a man to Mars.",1452211200,,506,3.7264150943396226
7531161,3,B017S3OP7A,"I saw Gravity for the first time in the week before I saw The Martian. As disasters in space go, Gravity is a sprint whereas The Martian is a marathon. I prefer the sprint. I could feel that the Sandra Bullock character was always in physical danger and psychological turmoil; the music underscored these feelings. In The Martian the Matt Damon character experienced little psychological turmoil and only marginal physical danger; the music undermined the seriousness of the situation. Sandra Bullock's performance makes Matt Damon look like a high school actor. The Martian has been nominated for a Golden Globe in the Comedy or Musical Film category. That seems appropriate.",1452211200,2,676,5.154545454545454

Surgery, unfortunately prohibited me from a theatrical experience, so I awaited Amazon Prime. Then the delay of a rental performance made me wait longer. I could not wait! I relented and bought it in HD. What a bargain! It would have cost me over $20 for a one- time showing and now for$15 I own a marvelous, awe-inspiring movie without the slow-burn Andy Weir science course. I can watch it on my Kindle 8.9 HDX with my ear buds and varied-sized closed caption at will. If is as good or better than a cinema showing. Best special effects and SF ements in a movie in decades!

7531183,3,B017S3OP7A,"As a real Ridley Scott fan, I hate to say this, but the director has lost his spark and talent in recent years. In other words, do you remember ""A Ridley Scott movie"". You can't feel this anymore which is sad for fans like me. The Martian is another disappointment, so if you don't know about the fact that this film was shot by Scott before watching the film, you cannot understand until the end credits. As for the problem of the movie, the movie is not ""Cast Away on space"". I wish it was, but it is not. Why? Because there is no suspense, no mystery and no horror. The film ignores the psychological nature of the character and he doesn't face with any real challenge or trouble. Do you remember? When After Earth was released, it was mostly criticized for not being ""too dangerous"". http://www.rlsscene.com/category/movies/ The Martian is much worse. You cannot feel the danger, so does character! Because there is no real danger in the film. The main character behaves like John McClane at times, but he is not John McClane though. I mean a witty John McClane perfectly fits Die Hard franchise, but here it doesn't work. Most of the time, our man alone is ""happy"". And this ""happy"" mood defines the tone of the film. I would even prefer Red Planet over The Martian, because despite Red Planet was just a passable popcorn flick, it was mysterious, dark, suspenseful and interesting. The story in The Martian is not interesting, because it is not a survival type of a movie! I am a Matt Damon fan, I can watch him peeling potatoes and onion for hours, I am such a fan, but even he was dull here. The Martian is also a talky film, in fact too much talky, but the story needs more visuals than chatting, in other words more silence than words. 3D was just fine except for a few dazzling Mars images. The film reminded me the masterpiece Silent Running and I wish it would have been as great as that movie. The final chapter of the movie becomes lazy, dull and clich unfortunately and it cannot add something fresh to the story. And do I have to say the film lacks emotion and real entertainment which is weird. Additionally, some supporting characters were supposed to be funny, but actually they are not. I can prefer even Prometheus over The Martian honestly.",1452124800,3,2263,4.5354523227383865

7531185,5,B017S3OP7A,"Undoubtedly, I would agree, with the rest of film lovers, with the assessment of the quality of this film. Definitely worth watching and one of best films I've ever seen. Scott Ridley at his best as always. The production and screenplay, for the first that I know, makes the true science of Astrophysics Sexy! Not an easy thing to do. Of course there was some cheating (no such strong storms and gravity in Mars), but relatively minor fiction is a necessary evil for Hollywood.

I would disagree that casting was out of place. It was superb, no doubt. Jessica Chastian and Micheal Pena, where a delight working together as military pilots. This is what makes the film for me, and not the stereo-typed super space heroes (to wit: flash Gordon) we're accustomed to seeing. These are the real pilots you'd fine in the military, if you truly understood the book's attempt on realism. And of course, the true star was Damon. I agree he mirrored the book's character to a 'T'. I'd rate this a 5-star classic and a must see, over and over again.",1452038400,,1038,4.610810810810811

When I saw where it was headed with the main character being stuck on the planet, I feared I was headed into another Cast Away which I found a colossal waste of time (did not need to be nearly as long as it was).  However, this story really was great.  Very interesting movie.  Great cast.  Kept me intrigued the entire time (which for me I get a bit bored typically around 1.5 hours).

7531189,4,B017S3OP7A,"Matt Damon is left for dead during the rushed evacuation of a small-scale Martian expedition. It's like Apollo 13 on steroids, mixed with short dashes of 127 Hours, MacGyver and Survivorman. Much less of a one-man show than I was expecting, which gives the film a little more spirit but also a more conventional structure. I think it would've been a far more interesting, daring picture if we'd seen more personal video journals from space and less debate around a round table at NASA, if just because we've seen the latter film several times already. Damon is excellent, bringing a blend of hopeless desperation and punchy good humor that gives him credence as both a technical expert and a likable, relatable everyday guy. The supporting cast is scattered with some strange choices, though - Kristen Wiig in a dead-serious role and Sean Bean as a kind-hearted supervisor are particularly out of place - which left me enjoying the scenes with Damon alone in the red landscape much more than the rescue effort. Still, the epic moments far outweigh the sub-standard ones, there's a strong sense of humor beneath all the suspense, and the visuals are really pretty incredible. Bonus points for getting so much of the science right, too. I'm conditioned to expect a lot of flaws when I dig deeper into sci-fi like this, but apart from one notable exception (the weather on Mars), the experts looked at this one and said ""Yeah, that could actually work.""

I felt as though this movie really captured the pain, agony, and suffering of an average joe stuck in an abnormal situation. Ignoring the fact as to whether or not it is an actual plausible scenario, I was able to suspend my disbelief and enjoy the movie for what it was. From start to finish the movie does not let up. And for the entire journey we are taken on a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs as we care for the well-being of a very skilled astronaut, Mark Watney.

7531227,3,B017S3OP7A,"The dialogue in this movie was atrocious. It was like listening to a frat brother the entire time. I feel like the makers elected to pander to pop culture rather than explain important, technically interesting details as to how challenges were solved. (For example, how the rover was outfitted for survival rather than just glossing over it with ""the greatest minds"" helping out from Earth.) Every opportunity for a snarky joke was taken, at the expense of credibility. How was a heater created from a radioactive core the team had buried upon arrival? Don't worry about it, Matt Damon's verbal assurance that he will ""science the s*** out of it"" should be more than enough of a technical explanation. Even the PR lady HAD to say ""I hate all of you guys right now"" in response to a nerdy Lord of the Rings reference as opposed to a response that would have made sense. A PR rep who is always blunt and mean behind the scenes...what a complex, interesting character.

I'm sorry but it's really hard to forgive the implausibility of some of the events in the film when the dialogue is so populated with gibberish meant to appeal to teens and twenty-somethings. On the whole, it is a watchable and engaging movie, but not a very good piece of SCIENCE fiction. The premise of the story is that there are very, very difficult technical challenges involved in surviving on the surface of a planet that cannot support human life so ignoring details with smoke and mirrors in unacceptable.",1451779200,3,1481,4.718146718146718

7531241,5,B017S3OP7A,"I'll leave the tech talk to others, but the author of the book on which the film is based set out to create a story that was more science and less fiction with results that are both intellectually interesting and entertaining.  Both Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain had roles in the science fiction film Interstellar, which leaned more towards the conjectural science fiction of worm holes and the multiverse. Martian is much more like the film Gravity which exists in a realistic near future, and deals with the known laws of the universe, and this makes it much more compelling.
As an aside, it was funny to see actor Sean Beam sitting in a room while the other cast members talk about the Council of Elrond from the Lord of the Rings - Beam played the part of Boromir in the LOTR and was present at the Council in the film.  How many takes did they have to shoot before he got through this scene without laughing?",1451692800,9,915,4.473053892215569

The Martian stars Matt Damon as an astronaut named Mark Watney who is fighting to stay alive after the rest of the crew reluctantly and mistakenly leave him for dead.  There is an all-star cast of some very multiple well-known celebrities in this film (also easily found via an online search) and a great plot of how the other crew members end up working together for key missions (including plot and character development as Damons Watney  character figures out ways to strive to stay alive).

I think one little breeze would rip that tape right off. the second launch craft that is exactly the same as the first but never tips over after sitting there. the lack of control he would have had by poking a hole in his suit and using as thruster... how do people eat this stuff up. this is basically a wank fest to matt damon,1451347200,15,554,4.235849056603773

7531308,5,B017S3OP7A,"I came into this movie pretty blind. Lately I avoid movie trailers until *after* I see a movie, if I can help it (the art of mystery and intrigue is lost on most trailer editors these days). I didn't know who directed 'The Martian', I didn't know who was in it, other than Matt Damon, I didn't know what it was about. All I knew is that people said it was good.

 THE STORY 
To say 'The Martian' was just ""good"", is an understatement. It has elements of action, servings of science (points to you if you know your botany and physics), tough decisions, suspense, a healthy dose of humor, topped with a thrilling conclusion. It's darn good story-telling. Read other reviews if you would like a recap of the plot, but there are certain movies where the less you know the better it is, so for this movie, it's a must-watch, that's all you need to know.

There are a few memorable lines and potential catchphrases (as a Botanist, I laughed out loud at the botany zingers), but telling you would spoil the fun. One thing you might take with you after the film is over is this quote: ""If you solve enough problems, you get to come home."" Another way one could interpret that is: If you can figure out and solve problems in life, for yourself or other people, you'll end up getting what you want. Knowledge is power, so learn as much as you can about anything and everything you're interested in; you never know when it'll pay off.

 3D 
This film was shot natively in 3D. Compositions were pre-planned from the start and you can tell because every shot makes great use of depth. You'll see depth in the beautiful Martian landscape, HUDs (Heads-Up Displays) are given visual life, and planetary storms will make you feel like you're in the middle of it.

This is one of the must-watch (3D) films of 2015, and a truly enjoyable movie experience. Highly recommended.

*** UPDATE ***
'The Martian' has now won two Golden Globes for:
 'Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy' (which is pushing it, for the category).
 'Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy' for Matt Damon.

It has also been nominated for multiple Academy Awards, including Best Picture. I wouldn't be surprised if it won, making it the first ever science fiction film to win Best Picture.",1451347200,302,2276,4.537897310513447

My other two mars movies are Mission to Mars and the Red Planet, both of which I could probably complain about a bit. But this movie was just great!

7531339,5,B017S3OP7A,"I this a pretty rock solid movie.

I didn't and honestly still don't understand the opening that led to Matt Daymon's character getting stranded there but the rest of the movie more than made up for it's lackluster start to the story.

I give bonus points for the times the movie explained it's logic.  Often it is just left up to the audience to accept the tech speak and move on.  In fact two times during this movie I went to google to figure out what the hell they were going on about only to have the movie explain the methods as I was typing.  The best part was it didn't feel contrived, it was well written into the plot so it didn't feel like he was just looking at the audience and saying ""Hey you, this is what I am doing"".

The only other part of the movie I didn't much care for was the way they handled telling the crew their guy was left behind.  They SHOULD of went with the, ""If we tell them, they will lose focus and may screw up the return to Earth.""  Because hey, you just left your friend/coworker behind and he is still alive and slowly starving to death is soooooooooooo much better than letting them think he is dead.  At least until they had a solid functioning rescue plan in hand to save him.

Outside of that how was it?

I actually gave a damn about the story, the cast were phenomenal, everyone felt like believable in their roles and no one felt out of place.  Even more impressively, Sean Bean SURVIVED!!!!!  I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it but it is a great movie to own.",1451174400,3,1518,4.211072664359862

The movie is okay, but it definitely is no where near as good as the book. The reviews said that the movie was true to the book.

Matt Damon was phenomenal in his role.  I've heard the movie compared to Tom Hanks's ""Cast Away,"" but I would disagree because there is so much interaction between NASA and crew members and so many cuts to people in the U.S. and China trying to solve the Mars dilemma.  I don't think it was nearly as drawn-out as ""Cast Away.""  Both my husband and I appreciated Matt Damon's excellent comedic timing; he has some very funny lines to break the tension.  In addition, we enjoyed seeing China portrayed as our friend for a change.  Our daughter is adopted from China, and we often find that American movies portray China as the enemy.

Matt Damon is perfect as Mark Watney and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent.  This is a fine film.  It is rare that I find a film that leaves me with nothing to criticize, but this is one.

7531364,5,B017S3OP7A,"Let me warn you in advance. This isn't Star Trek. It also isn't Star Wars. The book or this movie is not thrown together to cater to those with low attention spans. No advanced aliens come to save the day or to lay a larva in anyone's chest. There isn't any Mary Sue characters who seem to be perfect at everything they do. Nor are any problems solved easily or without trouble.

There also isn't extra filler here or added drama to appease people interested in anything else. I really admire the book and film for these efforts. Not to mention there are some really awesome Easter eggs. I wasn't expecting them due to my focus on the survival situation. That made them even more amazing and this movie has a great humor sprinkled within.

This is survival Science Fiction at it's best. It showcases the spirit of human beings at their best, against the odds, and how solving enough problems shows you can get past anything. To sum up The Martian as quickly as possible, I would call it Survivor Man meets Apollo 13. What makes this film so special is Apollo 13 was real and although this movie is pure fiction it feels real, because of the hard research the author did in regards to NASA.

Nobody looking for a movie with regards to what I wrote above could ever be disappointed with this movie overall. At least in my mind it offers everything you could ever want in this genre. You don't have to be a lover of science fiction to enjoy this movie about the true strength of the human spirit and mind.

Pros
The Acting. Damon was great but the support cast was also amazing. This could have very easily been the Matt Damon show with below average support actors to save money. Doesn't happen here.
Dialog
Characters
Authentic atmosphere
Pacing
Easter Eggs
Sense of Humor

Cons
Soundtrack. While I enjoyed the humor behind what music he was left with to listen too. The dramatic elements from the instrumental aspect of the more dramatic scenes and movie lacked. I felt more could have been added here and it could have been better. A small stupid thing I know but I had to find some fault with this gem.

7531366,4,B017S3OP7A,"I love survival story movie. And this does not disappoint. Though the movie could be longer to get a sense of his hope, fear, and the will to live, it's understandable to show piece here, piece there. It's there but you want to see more of it. The daily routine, what do you think of when you wake up, how do you go about your day, etc. It's horrifying to know you the only being alive that get to see what life let you see and experience unknown planet. The part where he said, you're the first of everything. First to climb a hill, first to walk down a plain. It's truly amazing when you think about.",1450915200,7,602,4.153846153846154

It stated there that the early digital hd release would contain the bonus features that the forthcoming Blu-ray dvd does so it seemed like a good bargain.  After logging on to watch the movie and the bonus features, I discovered that only the basic movie was included, no bonus features.  I called customer service and they said that the digital hd release did not contain bonus material, and they refunded my money, which I appreciated.  However, I did further research and discovered that all of the other streaming services offered the digital hd release and they all contained the bonus materia that the studio promised.  Only Amazon doesn't.

The movie itself is simply the best movie of the year, in my opinion.  Was looking forward to seeing it again, and to the bonus features.  Too bad Amazon did not offer the full version that the other services did in this early release.",1450915200,14,1002,4.7514450867052025

It is great to see Ridley Scott back in action and Matt Damon in a funny role about an astronaut stranded on Mars after a freak storm. This is a film that is similar to Gravity but without the dramatic emotions, Martian is light and very funny film about science fiction but is not too complex and the ending is amazing. Matt Damon is great and so is the supporting cast - Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Michael Pea, Donald Glover .

7531390,4,B017S3OP7A,"I enjoyed this film and recommend it. The reason I gave it only four stars is because, I believe, it's not quite on the level of all time great sci-fi films that most everyone would give 5 stars. Films like 2001, Star Wars episodes 4,5, 6, Interstellar and Ridley Scott's own Bladerunner and Alien are generally considered to be 5 star films. Having said that The Martian does not disappoint. It's stays engaging from start to finish. The near future plot revolves around Astronaut Mark Watney's (Matt Damon's) attempt to survive long enough to be rescued after being inadvertently left behind by a NASA crew that thought he was dead. And we see NASA scientists back on Earth pull out all the stops to get him back home. The movie is scientifically and technically accurate in a lot of ways. The special effects, the images of the Martian landscape are striking (at least in the IMAX format I saw). The movie has it's humorous moments and presents NASA at it's best, working for the general good of mankind. In this film the Mars mission's are seen as a natural and universally supported next step for human beings. In one way I would compare it with the film ""Battleship."" I took my Mother to see that upbeat 2012 film. The movie placed the United States Navy in a such a positive light that my 82 year old Mom commented half seriously that she wanted to enlist.

7531398,3,B017S3OP7A,"Let me state that I had read the book before going to see the movie.  So going into this, I had already made up in my head what the cast should look like.  None of the people matched that description.  Honestly, I wasn't that enamored with anyone in the movie.  None of them were bad choices, just not who I would have picked based off of reading the book.  Secondly, they cut out a lot from the book. They cut out a lot of the science, which was to be expected somewhat, but it was almost insulting.  I understand that they have to make this viewable for the masses, and that means dimming the intellectual lights, so to speak, but it was pretty dry.  To me, that's what made the book so AWESOME, the fact that it was so smart, and so, so accurate.  They also cut out some action.  I get that it has to have a time limit, but they also added some stuff to the ending (spoiler alert) that wasn't in the book.  They could have cut all that crap out and just left some of the other things in there.

This is the kind of movie that you rent.  You don't buy it.  You don't watch it more than once.  It's entertaining enough, but there isnt' anything there that makes it a must own movie.  It just wasn't that good.  It's kind of disappointing because the book was so absolutely amazing that it might just have been too big a project for Hollywood to tackle.",1449014400,24,1353,4.166023166023166

It truly deserves best picture, best director (Ridley Scott), best actor (Matt Damon), best supporting actress (Jessica Chastain), best screenplay, best novel/story (may not be a category but Andy Weir deserves credit for the story), and best special effects. The rest of the cast were also superb, but there are only so many awards to go around!  Now that that's out of the way, I will add few more comments. The screenwriter was quoted as saying """"The Martian"" (script) was a love letter to science."" It was that and so much more. It was also a testament to the triumph of the human spirit on a personal basis as manifested by Matt Damon's performance, and also the collective spirit of both NASA and all mankind rising to the challenge of ""bringing him home"". It showed us our best selves without being saccharine, and hopefully will inspire our nation and younger viewers to pursue the sciences in school and in their careers. Smart, dedicated people collectively working towards something bigger than themselves were the heroes; indeed, science and intelligent people with a can do attitude are the uncredited stars. My optimistic hope is that the book and movie may grab America by its collective shoulders, shake vigorously, and wake us up from our national malaise to restart/fund our space and STEM education programs with the objective of an extended manned Mars and planetary exploration program! Yes, these are high hopes for lasting change started by a mere movie, but then, why not?!? Show it in our schools to inspire the young.

I really can't think of anything bad about the movie.  Overall great performance, I think this movie should be winning awards once the award season comes around.  I would definitely want to see the movie again, possibly even buy it when it becomes available.",1448755200,3,922,5.0131578947368425
7531403,5,B017S3OP7A,"Theatrical review.  Possible spoilers.  The last time we saw Matt Damon in a movie he was a surprise in Interstellar.  Playing an astronaut/explorer trying to find an inhabitable planet, he turns bad guy and tries to take out the hero played by Matthew McConaughey.  The big leap in The Martian is that his abandon astronaut character is a good guy.  A really good guy, full of grit, determination and humor.

On an exploratory trip to Mars, the crew headed by mission commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain, also in the aforementioned Interstellar) must make a hasty retreat from the planet as a huge storm approaches.  The fierce winds dislodges an antennae which hits the teams botanist, Mark Watney (Damon) and blows him off into the distance.  Lewis after a quick search, decides that everyones in jeopardy if they continue the search.  Logic suggests Watney didn't survive, so they leave and head back to Earth.  Only Watney did survive and manages to find his way back to base camp where he patches himself up and tries to figure out how to survive, once his prepared food and water run out.  He also must figure out how to communicate back to Earth that he is alive.

Lewis and her remaining crew members (played by Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan and Aksel Hennie) are pretty much out of the picture until the tense and exciting final act.  The story shifts back to Watney as he has to science the sh*t out of his predicament if he is going to survive.  He figures a way to make water and grow potatoes and eventually makes communication with NASA, headed by Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels).  He and his Mars Mission managers (Chiwetel Ejiofor and Sean Bean) must take risky shortcuts to save Watney.  They even team up with China who has a mission already in the works.

Directed by Ridley Scott, whose last couple films (Exodus: Gods and Kings and The Counselor) were, uhless than memorable, seems to have his mojo back.  The film is beautifully shot, owing much to Kubricks 2001 in terms of set design, and is wonderfully written (Drew Goddard from Andy Weirs book).  Its also nice to see Damon back at the top of his game.  His Watney is a perfect portrayal of a man fearful, but willing to fight for his life against almost insurmountable odds.  The fact that he introduces humor into the film throughout, suggests it is a key element of his survival.  This is a terrific movie that I cant wait to see again.  Highly recommended.",1448755200,59,2451,4.675233644859813
7531404,5,B017S3OP7A,"Space films are going famous nowadays, like Gravity and Interstellar, which are both great movies. If you love those movies then you should not miss The Martian.
Besides from stunning special effects, superb acting and directing, and very humorous scenes, you should not miss this becuase of the story of the movie. Go, but it and see for yourself.",1448668800,,348,4.915254237288136
7531405,4,B017S3OP7A,"The Martian is not the movie I expected it to be. Not that I can tell you what I expected it to be because I tend to avoid too much about movies that I want to see, these days. I suppose I expected it to be more of a story that focused on Mark Watney, himself, and the struggle of being stranded alone on a planet, like Cast Away but on Mars. Rather, it's more like Apollo 13. It's not a bad thing, just not the thing I expected.

The next thing I would say is that the movie is better than it is. What I mean by that is that it a very enjoyable movie despite the rather numerous issues it has. I'm going to chalk the issues up to Ridley Scott who has a name that means more than it should. Seriously, if you actually look at his track record, he hasn't made a whole lot of actually good movies. I say that as someone who loves Blade Runner. Basically, Scott went for flash over substance in a number of places in The Martian. It's not stuff you'll probably notice when you're watching the movie, but you probably don't want to think too hard about it after the fact.

What you do want to see the movie for -- or, I should say, who you want to see the movie for -- is Matt Damon. Damon carries the movie with an ease that appears effortless. Despite the lack of focus in the movie (remember, blaming Ridley) on the actual stranded nature of Watney, Damon allows the desperation to seep through in key scenes. But the thing that will catch you about the movie and Damon's performance is the humor and, really, good-natured-ness of the character. It's a nice contrast to his character in Interstellar, last year's space drama with both him and Jessica Chastain. Best line: ""I'm going to have to science the s*** out of this.""

Sean Bean is also really good. It's almost worth the whole movie for the scene with him and the ""Council of Elrond"" and each of them arguing over whom they're going to be. So funny.

The rest of the cast was mostly as you'd expect. All good but no one pushed beyond the kind of thing they normally do. I enjoyed seeing Michael Pena again so soon after Ant-Man, but, honestly, he was under used. Not that he should have had more screen time, but his potential was wasted. As was Kristen Wiig's. Seriously, why was she even in that role? All she did was stand around and look concerned. Anyone could have done that role so why put someone with Wiig's talent in it and not use that talent?

The other standout performance was by Donald Glover. He was great as the absent-minded science guy... astrophysicist? I forget, actually, what kind of science he did, but he was great. Dumping the coffee into the wire mesh trashcan was classic, but it was the look on his face that made it work.

Basically, The Martian is a good and enjoyable movie. You should see it. I'd even watch it again, mostly for Damon's performance; however, it didn't make me at all interested in the book and, bottom line, that's actually how I judge the success of any kind of adaptation: Does it make me want to take a look at the source material? If, after having seen it, I am completely uninterested in the source material, the adaptation has failed on some level to engage me. In the end, The Martian is a ""happy"" movie. It's feel-good, and there's nothing wrong with that. I don't know if the book is the same, but the movie leaves me with the feeling that there's nothing deeper to explore. Again, I blame it on Ridley.",1448582400,2,3419,4.326053042121685

7531408,5,B017S3OP7A,"For all the hype about CGI, and such things as Real 3-D, or IMAX 3-D, the fact is that Hollywood is throwing in a lot of ultra-expensive special effects and gimmicks to lure patrons into theaters as incentives to watch movies costing anywhere from $150 million to $200 million that are so much about the sonic and visual experience exclusively, and so precious little about the art form of the motion picture itselfprimarily comic-book spectacles, and ultra-violent action.  But there are still directors who like to do things differently.  One of them is British director Ridley Scott.  Known for such masterworks as ALIEN, BLADE RUNNER, GLADIATOR, and, in 2012, the ALIEN-influenced sci-fi/horror epic PROMETHEUS, Scott returned to the science fiction genre in 2015 with a film that is full of eye-popping visuals and sonic experiences, but rooted in realism.  That film was THE MARTIAN.

Based on the novel of the same name by Andy Weir, this film, which is a far-into-the-future science fiction opus in the manner of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (one of the films that Scott always considered a touchstone film), focuses on a manned expedition on the surface of Mars that goes horribly wrong for those involved when a severe Martian sandstorm envelops them.  In a panic to leave, they unwittingly one of their own (Matt Damon) behind on the Martian surface.  The crew (led by Jessica Chastain) believe him to be dead, as does practically everyone at NASA, including its chairman (Jeff Daniels); but in fact, he is managing to survive on his expertise as a botanist and grow his own potatoes inside the sealed space lab on the surface of a planet where nothing can really grow naturally.  Chastain and her crew only find out about this just as their spacecraft is making it home to Earth; and Daniels, a mission specialist (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and a British technician (Sean Bean) have to fast design a new mission for Chastain, Michael Pena, and their compatriots to quickly swing back to Mars for an incredibly dangerous rescue mission.  Damons knowledge of botany, and his somewhat caustic wit, are what manage to keep him reasonably sane through all of the difficulties; but at some point, luck will run out on him.

As the bar for realism in terms of space flight and space exploration had been set by 2001, where both director Stanley Kubrick and legendary writer Arthur C. Clarke were in close contact with NASA, and was extended with films like that films 1984 sequel 2010, 1995s APOLLO 13, 2013s GRAVITY, and 2014s INTERSTELLAR, Scott found it worth his while to follow in their footsteps when it came to THE MARTIAN.  And although some slight inaccuracies were inevitable (Hollywood has a tendency to exaggerate reality for visual spectacle), in general, Scott shows an otherwise extremely high accuracy and attention to detail as Kubrick, one of his personal favorites and mentors, had done for his 1968 sci-fi masterpiece.  And as with all good serious science fiction films, from2001 onwards, the technology doesnt overshadow the characters or the plot; it is all in service of the story, as opposed to the other way around.  Damon, of course, is really good in his own sardonic way, as are Chastain (who was in INTERSTELLAR), Ejiofor, Daniels, and Pena.  The score by Harry Gregson-Williams, who did the score for GLADIATOR, has an appropriate amount of futurism to it, as well as some moments of pure classical music and modern minimalism, to give the appropriate amount of tension (as well as lighter moments that use 1970s disco music, including Vicki Sue Robinsons Turn The Beat Around, Abbas Waterloo, and the OJays Love Train).

The vastness of the cosmos, as well as the red deserts and mountains that constitute the surface of Mars itself, are all vividly rendered by Scott, cinematographer Darlusz Wolski, and the visual effects team assembled for the project.  With its combination of visual accuracy and stellar acting, THE MARTIAN joins GRAVITY and INTERSTELLAR as a pre-eminent example of how great science fiction movies can still be made at a time when Hollywood has eschewed visual reality for visual spectacle, and sonic assaults for story immersion.  Scott is one of those veteran directors who have shown that it need not be any other way.",1448582400,8,4267,4.962131837307153

Yes, director Ridley Scott is ultimately to blame for this Hollywood disaster. Okay, its not that bad, but it couldve and shouldve been a lot better. The biggest problem is that in a story that relies on tension and suspense, there is little to none. Nasa astronaut Mark Watney is left for dead on Mars after a botched expedition, but, thanks to the plots lame sense of humor, I never got the sense that hes in any real danger. Even if I did, I wouldnt care. His character is mostly irritating. I say we send all people like him to Mars and leave them there.

Beyond the spaceship duels and friendly/unfriendly human/alien encounters, outer space films like the ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" franchises (and even TV's ""Futurama"") draw their appeal from their confident assurance that someday humanity will not just ""conquer"" space, it will make it so comfortable and familiar that visiting a new planet will be as easy as taking a walk to the neighborhood grocery store. Perhaps, but that hope is at least decades away. Right now, even now, outer space is cold, dark, and above all, so vast that even visiting a relatively close planet like Mars takes an average of four years. And even when you get to Mars, it's barely more hospitable than the moon. ""The Martian""'s (hereafter ""Martian"") protagonist, space botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is absolutely right when he states ""Space Does Not Cooperate"". This becomes a problem when he is stranded alone on Mars like an interplanetary ""Robinson Crusoe"" (somewhat reminiscent of the 1964 film).

Mark is part of the Ares III team also consisting of Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and astronauts Rick Martinez (Michael Pea), Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan), and Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie). While the Ares III team explores Mars, a blinding particle storm forces them to abort their mission and board their ship. The storm violently separates Mark from the rest of the crew who are forced to leave without him, believing Mark dead. The crew is so convinced he's dead that when they communicate that fact to NASA head Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), he almost immediately arranges an honorary funeral for him.

Of course, rumors of Mark's death are premature. Buried in sand, losing oxygen, and suffering a puncture wound, Mark is nevertheless alive. He manages to struggle back to the still-standing planet base, replenish air, equalize pressure, and treat his wound as best he can. However, the obstacles to his survival are just piling up. Can Mark fight Martian weather, radiation, cold, starvation, dehydration, and boredom at least long enough to somehow contact NASA to let them know he's alive, and then stay alive even longer for NASA to mount a rescue mission? Again, given that a one-way Earth-to-Mars trip takes four years, that's a daunting challenge.

Meanwhile, back on Earth, Teddy, NASA spokesperson Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig), and NASA mission directors Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) have their own challenges, both urgent and mundane. Besides naturally getting Mark home safely, Teddy and his team must negotiate the usual treacherous PR protocol to make sure that Mark's inadvertent abandonment does not embarrass, discredit, and eventually defund NASA. And meanwhile, back on Ares III heading back to Earth, the crew, especially guilt- ridden Commander Lewis, must decide, once NASA finally informs them, whether to continue home or return to rescue Mark, depending not only on whether they have enough fuel to do one or the other, but also on coordinating ship/Mars trajectory just right to get Mark.

And so ""Martian"" oscillates among these three scenarios and dilemmas and manages, in my opinion, to do it without boring and, if you'll excuse the expression, alienating the audience. How can a space movie without aliens (even Marvin), laser weapons, or aerial combat hope to do this? I think ""Martian"" succeeds in this by being more knowledgeable than its audience, but in a way that instructs the audience without talking down to them. The movie explains many astrophysical, mechanical, and chemical concepts (including a crucial ""slingshot"" maneuver) that help keep the movie going forward and the audience invested in the characters' fates. It certainly helps that Damon's character Mark, in his daily video journal of his ordeals, explains much of this scientific stuff in largely (and often laugh-out-loud profane) layperson's terms.

Furthermore, ""Martian"" reminds us that no national organization has a monopoly on knowledge. When NASA's attempt to send supplies in a booster rocket explodes into failure, they willingly ignore political tensions to contact chief scientist Guo Ming (Eddy Ko) and deputy chief scientist Zhu Tao (Chen Shu) at Chinese counterpart Chinese National Space Agency (CNSA) to help stabilize the payload. Ah, science rejects borders and embraces diversity. Finally, ""Martian"" uses science to ratchet up the intense suspense as Ares III does decide to go back to get Mark by plotting a trajectory and spacewalk, while Mark plots a rendezvous point and prepares a lightened space capsule and ""spacesuit propulsion"" system to hopefully get close enough to Ares III to grab him before his oxygen runs out.

""Martian""'s intelligence also complements the convincing special effects, believably fallible but professional and determined characters (especially Mark), and the realistic depiction of the problems and triumphs of space agency bureaucracy and more importantly space exploration to make an absorbing and involving movie. Not least, ""Martian"" succeeds because it respects human intelligence, resourcefulness, ingenuity, and persistence so much, it convinces us that humanity will eventually surmount space's often deadly ""uncooperativeness"".

P.S.: I saw this movie in the theater in 3D. Does 3D enhance the experience? In my opinion, it does to a slight degree, in the depiction of the Martian sandstorms and the flying spaceships. Yet, I felt it was largely unnecessary. Space's grandeur and infinite mystery come through even without the extra dimension.

P.P.S.: I especially appreciated how Mark explained how planting crops (like potatoes on Mars) in a new land effectively colonizes that land, and how the distinction between international law and maritime law technically made him a ""space pirate"". Arrrrgh!",1448409600,,5873,5.375
7531411,4,B017S3OP7A,"Saw it recently in a theater. This review is difficult because my feelings about htis movie are split right down the middle. While watching it I felt completely drawn in and followed breathlessly the drama on the screen. However, ten minutes after leaving the theater I felt a real letdown. Why? Because of a number of serious problems- 1. The whole timbre is seventies, not 2015; 2. Most of the science is pseudoscience and some glitches are quite awful. Addmititng that the communications between Terra and Mars suffer from a 20 minute speed-of-light delay, there are many live scenes from Mars and from the ship; 3. I doubt whether the storms in Mars' rarified atmosphere can be really that awful; 4. I could not understand why there was a need for the Chinese rocket; 5. Most of all, the script is so standard Hollywood that it really becomes offensive. The socially demented genius from astrophysics is unacceptable (his ingenious solution has been used in many SciFi books and in a few serious plans for interplanetary travel) and the clear division between the political and the human/humane personalities is so prescription written. The plot is bad, but the cinematography is often superb. Ridley Scott can shoot an incredible Martian desert and can direct actors like few others. This alone is worth seeing. And most of the acting is competent-to-very good. Matt Damon is a thorough professional. But, in my opinion, Jeff Daniels steals the stage in his cameo rendering of the NASA Chief. All in all, it is good while it lasts, but unlike 2001 or Blade Runner, I would not go on watching it year in-year out.",1448409600,4,1617,4.84115523465704
7531412,4,B017S3OP7A,"The world we live in right now is a crying shame. Anyone of an intellectual bent is looked at with derision and mistrust, in favor of idiot reality stars or non-professionals. Those who specialize in anything scientific are so few that we pump them up as glorified celebrities. Bill Nye the Science Guy is our chief climate change expert! Something's got to change to make science cool, fun, and relevant to the next generation, and Ridley Scott's The Martian may be the film that does it.

The Martian is one of the straight-up geekiest movies you're ever likely to see, but also one of the most thrilling. Think of it as a two-hour cinematic celebration of the sheer awesomeness of science and smart people in general. Based on Andy Weir's book, the Drew Goddard-penned story is remarkably simple in premise but broad in potential impact. Matt Damon plays astronaut Mark Watney, a botanist on the Ares III team exploring Mars until a sudden storm raises holy Hell. Watney is hit with flying debris and presumed dead, leaving Commander Lewis (Jessica Chastain) no choice but to leave him behind to save the rest of her crew. Little do they know that Watney is still very much alive and stranded alone on the distant planet. If he hopes to have any chance of survival he'll have to ""science the s*** out of this"", and science the s*** out of it he does.

Weir's book is a highly technical read full of science gibberish about molecules and complex machinery nobody will understand. But it's also completely entertaining due to the playful personality of Watney, who creates a video log chronicling every facet of his survival with a sense of humor. Using that big brain of his, Watney cooks up a way to grow food on a planet that can't sustain life, create water out of nothing, and even figures out a way to communicate with NASA back on Earth. By the way, those NASA folks are losing their heads over Watney being alive. Smartly, we spend just as much time on Earth with NASA's resident geniuses (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Sean Bean, Mackenzie Davis and more) as they try to conjure up a way to bring Watney home. They're also forced to deal with the PR fallout as every human being on Earth is drawn to Watney's plight. What The Martian envisions is an unprecedented level of cooperation between nations in the pursuit of greater knowledge and discovery. If only we had that today, but darn it we have to worry about balancing our budget or something.

Ultimately it's Damon who shoulders much of the emotional burden, and this is one of his finest performances. Watney is, for lack of a better word, a jokester. He's the team clown, but he's also unnaturally brilliant and recognizes how dire his circumstances are. Watney's personality keeps the mood light and the momentum moving, but the side effect is that his predicament never feels quite as dangerous as it should. Watney could die at any moment from any number of freak circumstances, but it rarely seems that way. The adaptation trims away many of the grimmest obstacles he faces, probably so the story never gets too heavy for audiences who just want a feel-good story of survival and human ingenuity.  There are some other changes, especially to the story's conclusion, that were clearly done to create a more crowd-pleasing effect, but those familiar with the novel may find them jarring. Some of the characters were altered significantly from the book, but when the cast consists of Sebastian Stan, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Aksel Hennie, and more you probably won't care. They're all tremendous and add little details to their characters that make the most of very limited screen time.

This is the most enjoyable movie Ridley Scott has done in quite some time. After The Counselor, Exodus: Gods and Kings, and Prometheus it's a pleasure to see him making smart, funny, purely entertaining movies again. While the visual layout bears more than a few similarities to Prometheus, the tone couldn't be more different and you can tell Scott loved every minute of making this movie. The Martian is as good of an adaptation as fans of Weir's book could have hoped for, and if we're lucky it will help people realize how cool science can be. It might also save your life if ever trapped in outer space.",1448323200,6,4292,4.7479892761394105

Id heard nothing but great things about this film beforehand. After seeing it, my verdict is Good, but far from great. It certainly keeps your attention, and is an interesting mix of serious science fiction, survival tale, thriller-diller, and political intrigue. What it shows about NASAs dilemmas in how/when they tell the public what is happening, how they assess the respective risks in their various options, and so forth is pretty convincing. Still, I have to wonder if NASA would really go to all this expense and trouble trying to save one person whose odds of survival are stacked pretty high against him.

A few other random points:

*Some breath-taking Martian and outer spacial scenery. I would have liked more in this department, particularly on Mars-in-general, but I suppose that one of the films strengths is that it doesnt try too hard to bedazzle us. The primary mission here is to show one fellows fight to survive in a distant and hostile environment.

*Some real surprises and turnabouts which, particularly toward the end, descend into yeah-right unlikelihoods and too-easies. Many people, it seems, would rather have big stretches and reaches than boring predictabilities, and the whole story is, of course, pretty unlikely--though not impossible. Nevertheless, the makers of this film could have tried a little harder in several key places.

*Though Ive never been a huge Matt Damon fan, those who are should enjoy his performance as marooned exobotanist Mark Watney. Jessica Chastain, Sean Bean, and a couple of others steal the show insofar as acting goes: Its just unfortunate that we don't see more of them. Much of the dialogue, particularly WatneysIn your FACE, Neil Armstrong! etc--is rather hokey and not quite as clever as intended.

*While Im a novice in these areas, some of the science and technology here is obviously implausible, and I would guess that most rocket scientists and physicists would find it downright ludicrous in a number of spots.

*Last but certainly not least, the zero-g scenes are a lot of fun. Trying to leave the stadium-style theater at the end, I was so marvelously disoriented that I walked UP toward the camera portal instead of DOWN toward the exit.  (Yes, I mean this in a good way.)",1448150400,4,2262,5.013333333333334
7531416,4,B017S3OP7A,"Ridley Scott has returned to form with The Martian due to sticking to the nuts-and-bolts of the story rather than some way-out SF-based theme(as in Prometheus). This is concerned with a space mission to Mars the red planet with a crew who are forced to leave an astronaut(Mark Watney) behind , thinking hes dead, when a dust storm blows up. Think of an Apollo 13 scenario where the astronaut played by Matt Damon has to survive until he is rescued in a very risky return by the retreating space vehicle which has to use the earth as a sling-shot device and pick him up in Martian orbit.

Scott has an ease of manner at dwelling on these space subjects. Hes also learned from other films, like Silent Running and Cast Away and Saving Private Ryan. With the Mariner probes we face post-fantasy Mars, where science fact squeezed out science fiction, where a real Mars took over. There are no Martians and the only life on Mars is likely to be more like microbes. Matt Damon plays a plucky individual who does the math to estimate how long he can spin out his resources, oxygen, water, potatoes which he grows utilizing his own faeces as compost. He establishes a communication link and keeps a video blog .

Meanwhile back at NASA they are all thrilled hes still alive and calculate how many sols hes got before he dies. How soon can they send up another rocket to rescue him?Meanwhile in space we tune into the crew aboard the rocket, who when they discover hes alive have to debate pros/cons of returning to Mars or heading home to Earth. Watney can play Lieutenant Lewiss ( Jessica Chastain) awful 70s pop disco collection. Damon shows ingenuity, guts and chipper humour after his buddies have left him for dead. Classy space procedural getting the science mostly right from the Master Ridley.

Science fact and pseudo-science are the new sci-fi. We are not a million miles away from making this leap of faith to go to Mars and so I found the film plausible. We are like the cave painters projecting what we are going to do in the future. Matt Damon and Scott are the cherry on the cake. A mix of Cast Away and Apollo 13: survival is all. There are fictional parts like the dust storm and the flight back and retrieval. A beautiful use of Jordanian landscapes to simulate the Martian terrain and a feeling for a few local difficulties. No inner angst, but the heady optimism of simply pushing forward for survival. Based on Andy Weir's novel.",1448150400,15,2442,4.583524027459954
7531417,5,B017S3OP7A,"Matt Damon's Everyman quality and wry sense of humor makes him the perfect actor to portray Mark Watney, astronaut, in Ridley Scott's ""The Martian,"" written by Drew Goddard, based on the book by Andy Weir. When a violent storm forces the Hermes crew, led by Commander Melissa Lewis (a steely Jessica Chastain), to abort the Ares III mission to Mars, the crew reluctantly leaves without Mark Watney, who was injured and presumed dead. Somehow, Watney survives, and starts keeping a log of his experiences on the Red Planet. He is a realist. It could take years for a rescue team to retrieve him, so he gets down to business: rationing and growing food, making water, repairing damaged equipment, and establishing communication with Mission Control.

In 3-D, the views are spectacular, with flying debris coming at us from various directions; the desolate yet strangely beautiful Martian terrain stretching out to infinity; the Hermes astronauts floating from one pod to another; and the thrilling, acrobatic finale. ""The Martin,"" is not deep, nuanced, or subtle, but it is a certified crowd pleaser. Matt Damon shines as a genius who, in spite of daunting challenges and discouraging setbacks, dusts himself off and comes up with solutions, including multiple uses for duct tape. Watney makes jokes about outdated Disco music, boasts about his skills as a botanist, and makes comments laced with profanity while communicating with earth.

The supporting actors include Jeff Daniels as NASA Director Teddy Sanders, who must make tough decisions that factor in not just the human element, but also his agency's image, political standing, and fiscal constraints. Would Americans ever abandon one of their own?  At a time when some nations have lost respect for the United States, this film boosts morale with its can-do spirit. Would it be churlish to point out that, for all its wizardry, special effects, and visual spectacle, ""The Martian"" has formulaic and clichd elements? Still, for a little over two hours, we sit back, take in the sights, and imagine what it would be like to be stranded on a faraway planet, trying to remain optimistic, and using our scientific know-how, guts, and resourcefulness to stay alive until (we hope) help arrives.

7531418,4,B017S3OP7A,"Matt Damon meets MacGyver -- or how to survive by hook or crook.  Much less science fiction than it is a page out of Science Mechanic.  The fact is, this could have taken place in the middle of the Mojave desert or the Sahara and it would have been just as entertaining, only difference there being that in either of those places, a helicopter and a rescue team would have come by in the first 20 minutes and plucked our hero out in a simple rescue -- end of the movie.  On Mars, it's a bit more complicated, and everything wouldn't have had that omnipresent red tinge over-cast to it.  Sure, we are routing for our hero because he's got a great sense of humor and that unstoppable American pluck, but in the end, his survival pretty much depends on luck, which he seems to have a carload full -- some of which REALLY stretches credulity.

The 3D has plenty of depth and adds that sense of involvement that I happen to enjoy big-time but which always seems to be a matter of subjective taste...some love it, some find 3D adds little.  I saw it in the RealD 3D format and found that so dull and lifeless as to be a constant distraction -- my brain saying, ""Hey...someone turn on a few more lights!!""  I can understand how watching THAT kind of poor 3D would put anyone off the 3D version, but then I want back with friends to see it in IMAX when they added for a week after THE WALK was pulled.  IMAX uses dual digital projectors to double the light on the screen and there it was a totally different film -- the 3D was spectacular; it was bright and immerse -- a totally different, MUCH better experience (an IMAX experience if you want to use their marketing jargon).  All I can say is, IMAX does it 3D right and the RealD 3D presentation is a much more inferior version.  Here's hoping the 3D Blu-ray will be much closer to the IMAX 3D version.",1448064000,4,1846,4.293948126801153

In a clever sequence, one of the watch-standers at Mission Control will come to realize that Mark is still alive.  NASA will face difficult logistical and moral choices in retrieving him; the movie does not shy away from examining these choices.

7531420,5,B017S3OP7A,"Directed by Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Blade Runner, Alien) from a screenplay by Drew Goddard (World War Z, The Cabin in the Woods) based on the best-selling novel by Andy Weir, The Martian is one of the best hard-science scifi films to hit the screen in decades. Remarkably faithful to the novel and thoroughly engaging for its entire 144 minute length, this film is definitely worth taking in. It's also worth seeing on the big screen for the cinematography - courtesy of Dariusz Wolski (Pirates of the Caribbean, Prometheus) - particularly the vast Martian landscapes (Wadi Rum in Jordan) and the later scenes that take place up in space.

The film opens on Mars where we see the third manned Mars mission crew carrying out their duties. Their activities however are cut short by a sudden Martian sandstorm that shows up, a storm so severe that the mission is scrubbed and the crew must leave the planet. In the process of heading to the MAV (Mars Ascent Vehicle) though, one of the mission crew, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is struck by a piece of flying debris and blown away from the others, the debris piercing his suit in such a way that it damages the part of the suit that gives out his biometric readings and his location. Believing Watney to be dead and his body lost, and with the storm threatening to tip the MAV over at any moment, Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) reluctantly gives the order to take off.  But, as Watney later gamely says in the film, ""Surprise!""  He's not dead. Seriously banged up, but very much alive. And very determined to stay that way.

That, however, is going to take a lot of doing. In his daily video log, Watney sums up his situation thusly:  ""If the oxygenator breaks down, I'll suffocate. If the water reclaimer breaks down, I'll die of thirst. If the Hab beaches, I'll just kind of implode. If none of those things happen. I'll eventually run out of food and starve to death."" On top of all that, his only hope of rescue is the next Mars mission, which isn't scheduled to reach Mars for three years. And he needs to find a way to let NASA - and the rest of Earth - know that he's still alive. ""In the face of overwhelming odds,"" he concludes, ""I'm left with only one option: I'm gonna have to science the _s***_ out of this."" And that's what makes the rest of the movie.

There are of course scenes where the action jumps to NASA on Earth as they discover first that Watney might have survived, then confirm that he is alive, and then start to figure out what they can do to get him home. And other scenes where the action jumps to the spaceship Hermes where the other members of the Ares 3 mission are making their way back to Earth, still thinking that Watney died on Mars.

Aside from Scott's smooth, sure-handed direction and Goddard's nicely-paced screenplay, it's the excellent cast of actors that really make The Martian work. Some valid questions have been raised about certain casting decisions where the ethnicity of the actor doesn't match the character, but in truth the choices made don't get in the way of the how the film comes across as the actors in question were all fine actors. Jeff Daniels (The Newsroom, Gettysburg) is in fine dry form as Teddy Sanders, the Director of NASA who has to balance the life of one lone astronaut against the safety and morale of the returning Ares 3 crew, while figuring out how best to accomplish the seemingly impossible task of mounting an actual rescue and keeping Watney alive long enough for it to reach him. Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty) is quietly convincing as Commander Lewis who has to make a lot of hard choices to do what she feels is needed, and more than anyone else, to carry the weight of those decisions on her shoulders. Kristen Wiig (Bridesmaids) hits just the right tone as Annie Montrose, NASA's official spokesperson, who has to publicly keep things positive while personally knowing just how long the odds are. And Sean Bean (Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings) is suitably stubborn as Mitch Henderson, the Hermes flight director who knows his people better than anyone and knows what they'd want to be told.

And of course there's Matt Damon (Invictus, Good Will Hunting) who manages the doubly difficult task of carrying fully half of the film's screen time while conveying both Watney's desperate situation and the quirky sense of humor that is a big part of what enables Watney to keep dealing with his situation without giving in to despair. This is no small thing. The humor in the book is a big part of what makes it such a good read, but reading and seeing on the big screen are two different things, and to make it work Damon has to bring out Watney's humor but keep the audience always aware of how vulnerable his situation is and never let things slip into outright comedy.  I'm happy to say that Damon pulls off this delicate balance with a superb yet subtle performance, making Watney's quirky but resolute determination to survive the true heart of the film.

The musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams (Shrek, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe) has just the right touch, adding to the feel of what's unfolding on the screen but never overpowering or distracting from it.

Highly, highly recommended for anyone who likes action/adventure/scifi in general and especially for anyone who likes their scifi realistic and believable. And for anyone who remembers what it was like when the space program captivated the world with Neil Armstrong  taking ""one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"" and Apollo 13's ""Houston, we've had a problem.""

8740449,4,B017S3OP7A,"This is a good movie as-is, but the 3D adds (literally) new depth. The beautiful Martian landscapes could have been showcased more often (I wish the movie ""Red Planet"" had been 3D!), but when shown definitely impress. Spend a bit more for the 3D version--this one's worth it!",1536192000,,275,4.75
