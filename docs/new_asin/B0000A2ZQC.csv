8453949,2,B0000A2ZQC,"If I didn't like the scenario I would make 1 star if I couldn't do 0 stars. I thought it would be a funny-bad movie, and it is to a degree, but the lack of story, characters, reasoning and explanation can leave one bored. I'm not even going into the poor choices the filmmakers did like state the name of a character with some video game like player select sequence that does nothing to progress the story, rather confuse the audience since the characters are pointless. This movie is bad.",1456012800,,489,4.444444444444445
8453950,1,B0000A2ZQC,"Few films are more challenging to watch and more tempting to fast forward than Mark Bakaitis' ""Narcosys,"" a 2000 release from Australia that is all style and no substance. The DVD case claims it is inspired by (among other things) ""The Matrix"" and manga. Post-apocalyptic films like ""Mad Max"" and music videos clearly had an influence here as well. The movie concerns a company, ITCorp, that controls the population through viral alterations in the drug supply in 2018. That's it.

There's not much plot, but there is a fairly large cast, though most of the actors matter little to the storyline. The filmmakers try to be innovative and occasionally aim for surreal touches (note the mouse ears on one seasoned criminal,) though most of these visuals play strictly for shock value and seemingly have no deeper significance or symbolism. The two leads are a hyperviolent bald guy, Sin-Tax (Matthew Trihey,) and criminal turned insider Matrix Monopoly (Mia Kate Russell.) Two other characters, Metro Confetti (Todd James) and Candybar Satelite (Renee Brennan) also have loads of screen time, though they aren't truly essential to the plot. These four ride around in a yellow car endlessly committing essentially random violence and getting into all kinds of trippy scenes. Other equally ridiculously named characters (e.g. Zerox Crone, Orbit America, Sermon Newsflash, etc.) round out the cast, though caring about any of them is strictly out of the question.

The film plays like a cross between a video game and a music video, sometimes conspicuously so. These are interesting techniques, but they are applied in an off-putting way that makes essentially no sense. I have no idea what the editing criteria for this movie could possibly have been. Along the way there is a lot of eyeball imagery (again, that could have been very effective if used in a more cohesive movie) representing authoritarian omnipotence. Further annoyances include the partially narrated format in the first part of the film, faux-evangelism gone horribly wrong, illogical gasmask use (don't ask,) lots of cheesy visual effects, and incoherent dialogue fragments like this somewhat random but unedited sample: ""MC squared. Import sector. CBD Orient zone. Don't try to secure private police force surveillance formula. The lot!"" I am just guessing at the punctuation that Adam Breasley had in his screenplay, but you get the drift. Incoherence reigns supreme here. Dystopian? Sure. Pointless? Utterly.

If that sounds bad, you'll surely be relieved to know that in the dark future marauding gangs of skateboarders still like to hurl themselves at ramps. This lengthy skateboarding detour was one of the most unintentionally funny parts of the film. (I suppose the running time had to be padded somehow.) There is, of course, an obligatory scene of violence in a nightmare nightclub filled with people not subscribing to any dress code in the world, which served mostly to make me try to spot the ugliest tattoo in the film. (More challenging than you might expect.) My vote is for the one on Metro Confetti's back. Like I mentioned, there is plenty of violence in the film (and especially in the bar) but it is so hokey I had to wonder if it was intentionally supposed to look fake. I'm guessing no; it's probably an artifact of an obviously constrained budget. Speaking of bad effects, do not even get me started on the apparent homage to ""Alien"" in which a man in coveralls participates in a robot birthing event that is sublime for B-movie aficionados.

I was very amused by a concluding line from Sin-Tax apropos of nothing which I feel sums up the film in a nutshell: ""We do not recommend parental guidance. There is no mature audience."" I'll let you make your own joke. Given that this film is as pretentious and antisocial as they come, the conclusion is really no surprise though the confrontation between Sin-Tax and Matrix is unbearably fake, her escape even more implausible, and the continuity issue that allows Metro and Candybar to be present for the big finale is fairly jaw-dropping.

Films like ""The Matrix"" prove that a market for effects-laden science fiction spectacles exists. Unfortunately for the makers of ""Narcosys"" it's a genre that is hard to make a good and good looking movie in inexpensively. There are some clever ideas present here, but the overall package is unpleasant, trying, light on plot (I'm being generous,) and frankly just plain bad. This film starts and ends with disjointed visual spectacles linked by the most tenuous of plotpoints, backed with a loud and abrasive soundtrack. I didn't think it was scary or thought-provoking (Big Brother has been done thousands of time by now,) I just found it tiresome and trifling.

""Narcosys"" is one of the genuinely most unenjoyable films I have ever seen.",1331683200,,4814,5.041457286432161
8453951,5,B0000A2ZQC,"This is a fantastic movie to have on in the background at house parties.  It is like one long Front 242 music video and is a great Australian attempt at making a movie just for the Industrial subculture.  Sure, the writing and acting is crap, but you shouldn't watch it for the plot.  I recommend this movie to all KMFDM, Ministry, Front 242, and Thrill Kill Kult fans.",1273449600,,369,4.397058823529412
