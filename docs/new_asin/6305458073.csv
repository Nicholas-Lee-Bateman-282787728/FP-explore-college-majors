7889868,5,6305458073,"""Land of the Lost"" was both one of the most innovative children's shows ever on television, and also a remarkably satisfying science fiction series. The show was about the adventures of the Marshall family in a strange alternate world populated by dinosaurs, hostile reptilian humanoids known as Sleestaks, and other creatures. Volume 1 of the LOTL video series contains two excellent episodes: ""The Stranger"" (written by Walter Koenig, who as an actor played Chekov on the original ""Star Trek"") and ""Tag Team"" (written by Norman Spinrad).
These two episodes contain many of the elements that make LOTL so memorable. In ""The Stranger,"" the Marshalls meet Enik, a Sleestak who, unlike his savage kin, is intelligent and civilized, and can speak intelligibly. This episode is filled with conflict, suspense, fantastic technology, and danger. Enik is a compelling character, and a stunning revelation about his species is one of the most memorable moments in the series' entire run.
""Tag Team"" is a wild change of pace from the previous episode. ""Tag"" prominently features the Pakuni, a primitive race of ape-like humanoids. A number of dinosaurs (including Dopey, the cute baby brontosaurus, and hungry tyrannosaurus Grumpy) also figure into the plot. This episode is an effective blend of slapstick action, suspense, and interspecies communication. We also get some interesting insights into the Marshall's daily survival skills. Chaka, the Pakuni boy, is one of my favorite LotL characters.
The special effects in LotL are admittedly primitive, but effective. The actors bring a conviction to the material which really helps the viewer get into the story. ""Land of the Lost"" was one of may favorite shows as a kid, and I commend both its original creative team as well as those who have given it new life on video.",1002585600,2,1814,5.173469387755102

The quality is good, but the episode choices for this first volume are  lousy and boring.  Why weren't they released in order?  The Stranger is all  talk.  and Tag-team is an early episode.  My kids wanted more dinosaur  action.",965001600,,381,4.36231884057971
7889870,5,6305458073,"I was so happy to find Land of the Lost sites on the internet! And then when I found these two videos to buy, I did it right away!  They are awesome!  Of course, being 25 years old, the effects seem cheesy, but when you have a love of the show from when you were a child and it was magic,  that magic is still there!  The family closeness is like a breath of fresh  air, and the dinosaurs were awesome for the time!  Anyway, I'm so glad the  videos are available, and for anyone wanting the whole set, they are often  available at various auction sites.",953337600,4,553,4.102803738317757
7889871,5,6305458073,"For fans of the show and new fans alike, this Land of the Lost tape is not to be missed!
These episodes look very nice, no graininess or snow here. The audio is top notch, and the show looks as good as it did those 25 years  ago when the shows originally aired.
The two episodes found on this tape  are classic Land of the Lost all the way.
In the first episode, Enik, the  divine Sleestak leader, appears in the Land of the Lost and gives the  Marshalls hope that they will get back home to their time. Enik is one of  the all time favorite Land of the Lost characters, and this is a don't miss  episode.
The second episode features the most beloved of all Land of the  Lost characters, the monkey boy named Chaka. Here we find Chaka being  chased down by some fearsome dinosaurs, and Will and Holly Marshall decide  to step in and risk their own lives to save Chaka.
Chaka's parents Ta and  Sa are equally as concerned as Rick Marshall, father to Holly and Will, and  they devise a plan to save their kids.
Another classic episode, this one  is also not to be missed.
For those that remember these shows when they  first aired, you will watch these tapes over and over and feel like you  were 8 years old again. A pleasant surprise was how much my young kids got  into these shows. They ask to watch them over and over. The shows always  present some sort of moral at the end of the show, and there is no  gratuitous violence and never a word uttered that you wouldn't be afraid to  say to the pope. Classic kids fare all the way.
If you love the show, or  love the Kroffts, this tape is a must have!",947116800,4,1602,4.159609120521172
