4829592,5,B005LOBWFW,"Very entertaining, engaging for the child and the family. My son, who is one year old, especially loves the songs, loves the dialogues and imitates some of the moves (waves good bye, jumps up, etc).
It's a  nice DVD to play either while feeding him or having it in the background while he plays.
Wish they had another DVD with different songs.",1373414400,10,343,4.532258064516129

4829597,5,B005LOBWFW,"Mother goose club videos are the best by far! The colorful images and creatively choreographed dance engaged my 15 month old since he was 8 months old. He was exposed to listening to the rhymes initially at 2-8months. Now he can mimic clap your hands, pat your knees, wave goodbye whenever the characters say goodbye. He also knows the itsy bitsy spider gesture.

I love how engaged he is with rhyming and learning new words and hand signs.

Best videos ever. And always raving to my friends about it.",1364256000,7,501,4.617977528089888

4829649,5,B005LOBWFW,"I purchased this for a older relative who is in a memory care facility. A social worker mentioned to me that many patients with dementia related to music, especially simple to understand, basic music such as preschool children learn. I taught preschool and kindergarten for 8 years, so had a sense of the music available. I looked through many options on Amazon and found this one, numbers and colors, some old nursery rhymes and some changed slightly, sung by children dressed in costumes that matched cartoon figures that show up between songs. There are captions, so I could sing along when I played this for my relative. She liked is and listened to more than 1/2 of it before closing the DVD player - a sign she had tired. Having taught young children and being ""Oma"" (grandma), I believe this DVD is appropriate for 18 month olds to 3-4 years (depending on the child). Some of the tunes are catchy and may occasionally drive a parent or caregiver batty. It is a ""fun"" set of songs, with appropriate pictures and good child actors.",1423094400,2,1036,4.666666666666667
