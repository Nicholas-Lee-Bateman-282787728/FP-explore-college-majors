3820110,4,B001V9K8I8,"If you wish to enjoy the music of Ray Charles at its best get the CDs by Ray Charles. His historic studio recordings cannot be successfully replicated by another. Ray Charles was unique.

That said this is quite a good concert. I did not know what to expect- jazzified country music or countrified western cum jazz? After viewing the disc I'll say it's only a grateful reminder that Ray Charles once walked this planet. I am left wondering why Marsalis the eminent jazz trumpeter will not try the music of famous jazz trumpeters instead, or the music of George Gershwin?

A note at the beginning of the great rock n' roll DVD, ""The Last Waltz"", suggests that you play that DVD loudly (for a good reason). I suggest you do similarly with this disc. Video quality is as espected.",1272585600,3,777,4.58273381294964
3820111,5,B001V9K8I8,"This is the second time I've heard Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis in concert together. I'm surprised at how well they do together and how great they sound. I had ""heard of"" Nora Jones but hadn't actually paid attention. Now, I will. She's great also. Loved it.",1271548800,4,263,4.617021276595745
3820112,4,B001V9K8I8,"Didn't enjoy this outing as much as the ""Two Men With the Blues"" (or is it Two Men and The Blues?).  Kind of disappointing, but maybe a second viewing will help.",1264982400,2,161,4.193548387096774
3820113,5,B001V9K8I8,One of the best concerts that I have ever seen.  All of the musicians were A plus.,1264032000,5,82,3.823529411764706
3820114,5,B001V9K8I8,This DVD in Blu-Ray has a great picture and sound.  A must have for collectors.,1263081600,3,79,4.266666666666667
3820115,5,B001V9K8I8,"Beautifully shot.  Most of the arrangements are brand new.  The combination of the musical talents of Wynton Marsalis, Willie Nelson and Norah Jones is magical.",1260662400,13,160,5.36
3820116,5,B001V9K8I8,"First off I am very happy with the way Amazon handled my purchase. It came sooner than I expected, which is not unusal, and at a very good price.

I saw this concern on HDNET and I loved it,so I decided a Blu-ray DVD was necessary. Have always been a Willy Nelson and Wynton fan, I play trumpet myself and have for decades. This was and is one of the best of the many Blu-ray concerts I now enjoy with either of my 2 home theater systems.",1259712000,6,438,4.0344827586206895
3820117,3,B001V9K8I8,"Wynton Marsalis, Norah Jones and the rest of the band are great.  The jazz riffs are great.  If you are expecting anything resembling the Ray Charles sound or a brilliant interpretation from Willie Nelson, don't bother.  His renditions are discordant and left me flat.  I had to play a couple of Ray Charles albums just to cleanse my palate.",1259193600,3,341,4.728813559322034
3820118,5,B001V9K8I8,"I attended this concert and can't wait to hear the CD. This concert was obviously designed from start to finish to be recorded and was done very well, although some of the lead-in lines were a little corny. Nora Jones added a lot to the quality of the concert.",1248566400,9,260,4.326530612244898
3820119,5,B001V9K8I8,"Wynton and Willie, quite a combo. Willies singing, phrasing, and guitar playing are in wonderful and unique form in this video. Winton is awesome on his horn, and most expressive. Walter Blanding is terrific, as are Carlos Henriquez, and Ali Jackson. And the presence of Norah Jones and HER awesome phrasing and voice adds a sparkle to both Willie and Wynton. Willie smile lights up his face every time he looks over at her. Wynton flirts with her which I have never seen him do with anyone else. This is lovely and soulful, enjoy!",1421798400,,531,4.659574468085107
3820120,5,B001V9K8I8,"The iconic Willie Nelson with a world class jazz band, fronted by Wynton Marsalis is a real treat. Add a small dose of Nora Jones and this little treasure of music magic is worth watching on a regular basis. Like chicken and waffles, it doesn't sound tasty when you are first told, but one taste and you are hooked.",1416441600,,315,4.3559322033898304

3820123,5,B001V9K8I8,"Be warned, this blu ray may not play on some older players. My samsung BD-D5500 apparently has had all the updates it will get as the audio on this disc would break up and then disappear. After purchasing a new player this disc played perfectly, the audio & video are excellent. This is a wonderful blend of country, Willie does what Willie does, jazz, Wynton plays a great horn, has a good sense of humor & sings. Nora Jones provides delightful interludes of that old style, sultry singing with an occasional impish twinkle in her eyes. These 3 folks are simply great together.

3820124,5,B001V9K8I8,"Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis are so great together, as unexpected as that seems. Since I also love Brother Ray, this is a recording made in heaven.",1385856000,,152,4.666666666666667
3820125,1,B001V9K8I8,sound quality was poor - just a taped tv show -  supposed to be dts-hd -but just a flat sound image no dimensionality - not even as good quality as the usual tv show broadcast in dolby 5.1,1375228800,2,188,3.9473684210526314
3820126,5,B001V9K8I8,Lifetime treasure for me just like Willie said it would be for him!  Willie is 80 now and I hope he gets to do this again like he said he would.,1372464000,,144,3.6451612903225805

3820130,5,B001V9K8I8,"This DVD is both educational and lots of fun.  Wynton is a great educator and seems to enjoy teaching as much as entertaining.  He does both well.  Willie Nelson is a consummate artist in a very different genre - maybe not so different after all.  These music icons obviously respect each other.  This album offers great music, played in riveting style. Absolutely painless education.  Powerful inspiration for any musician to perform at their best.",1324425600,4,449,5.0
3820131,5,B001V9K8I8,"wynton marsalis & willie nelson are wonderful on this CD.
& norah charles is not to shabby either...she blends in beautifully with them.
willie nelson can do a mean jazz.
wynton marsalis 'blows' without saying...then i got wynton & eric clapton...OH MY.

3820132,5,B001V9K8I8,"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this disc.  I have only heard Wynton Marsalis play a few times, but I'm a big fan of Willie Nelson and Ray Charles. This is an excellent pairing and Norah Jones just topped the show. It is well worth purchasing. Turn up the volume and enjoy.",1312329600,5,285,4.181818181818182
3820133,2,B001V9K8I8,"I'm a big Willie Nelson fan but this DVD didn't do much for me. Willie just didn't seem comfortable and no one on stage seemed to be having any fun. Wynton Marsalis does his best to try and put on a good performance but he couldn't carry it by himself. Norah Jones has that wonderful voice, of course, but she was young in this video and looks very uncomfortable. These are all great performers but unfortunately this one just didn't fly in my opinion.",1310342400,2,452,4.392857142857143
3820134,4,B001V9K8I8,"Este  um dos BDs de Jazz-Blues com uma das melhores performances vocais que eu j ouvi em BDs, com uma imagem excelente e msicas muito bem selecionadas, com interpretaes dgnas do elogiado Ray Charles. Todavia faltou sinal e dinmica no som DTS-HDMasterAudio o que torna a audio deste BD um pouco sem vida, apesar da tima definio instrumental e da notvel presena do contrabaixo, motivo pelo qual subtra uma estrela das 5 que este BD merecia. Mesmo assim recomendo este BD para todos que apreciam este gnero de msica. Afinal de contas, pelo preo que est sendo ofertado na Amazon.com, vale cada centavo investido.",1310256000,,608,4.846153846153846

I really enjoyed this disc with Willie,Wynton and Norah Jones she is not only beautiful but sings a very soulful song.
