7821610,5,6302110696,I think this is a great program that contains actual footage from France's 200th aniversary celebration.  It's a great way to learn about the history and causes of the French Revolution.,1115683200,,186,5.0
7821611,1,6302110696,"This is an amateurish documentary, presented on a single DVD in two chapters. The quality amounts to little more than a school project.  At the listed price -- a whopping $89 -- it is a complete rip-off.  The sound quality is infuriatingly poor -- badly distorted.  Stick with the History Channel special on the the subject -- infinitely better for about one-quarter of the price.  Products like this give Amazon a bad name.  To be avoided at all costs.",1107734400,33,453,4.6835443037974684
7821612,4,6302110696,"This is an educational video on the French Revolution. This is not a movie. I assume it is meant for classroom viewing and so it is done on two cassettes, each allowing for viewing and discussion.  I enjoyed it very much and it gave a good explanation of the cause and after effects of the Revolution, with pictures and reenactments. I have to admit that the price is high and I don't know what an educational video should run, but I purchased it and I enjoyed it.  Would recomend it to anyone who is interested in the French Revolution.",1029888000,11,537,4.414141414141414
