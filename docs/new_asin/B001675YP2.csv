It has good special effects, some decent acting, but the tone is always ""tongue in cheek"", semi-humorous without being funny... story lines are goofy at times.

I was wrong! The Only way to get the movies right now is to find the VHS taps (SUPPER! hard to find). If you have A VHS and can get your hands on the tapes I recommend waching them before you buy this release. The Series builds so much on the movies that it is A required prerequisite.

I really liked the show but can't remember if it ever had a proper finale episode or if it was yanked off without one in any case I get the chance to see it all again At the time it aired the effects were pretty good for a television show but as far as todays effects go it will probably look dated to those who never saw it but the story was pretty solid and the acting worked as well so it should be enjoyable to both people who never saw it as well as those who have.,1211760000,3,526,3.790909090909091

As for the reasons this is why....there are probably too many from the fact that it ran for only a season to William Shatner retaining rights or whatever.  I'm glad this came out, but unfortunately i'm not buying it and i'll tell you why.  This series is only worth watching if you've seen the TV movies that aired before the series got picked up.  Like the Kevin Sorbo Hercules TV movies that came first THEN the series.  They should include EVERYTHING! otherwise It would be unfair to the fans.  Hearing a backstory during a series especially like this one is NOT good enough.

It looks more like the box shown in the 2nd listed set which says ""The Complete Series"" above the framed picture.  And the framed picture is different; it looks more like a printed circuit board though it is 3 dimensional & looks like a maze you would try to get through.  The back of my box looks almost exactly like the back shown for the 2nd listed one also, EXCEPT where that box shows 3 little plaques for that set's 3 discs containing 18 episodes MINE just has ONE PLAQUE that says ""ALSO INCLUDES the original 4-part pilot"".  My set has SEVEN DISCS & contains ALL of the original first 4 TV Movies & the 18 episodes.  IT IS THE ENTIRE SHOW'S SERIES !!!!  It must be a later release than the box they are showing for either listing.  So I would think you can be fairly confident that if you order this now you would receive the full series set.  If you don't, be assured it DOES EXIST & you should be able to obtain this correct complete set from Amazon.

I hadn't thought about it much till I unearthed my books recently and decided to see if they'd ever been released to DVD.
I was a bit bummed to read all the reviews saying that the original four movies weren't available while the series was, but the price was right for a bit of nostalgia.
I'm very happy to report that they seem to have seen the light!  The four movies are in here!
The product description here, on Amazon,  still says three discs, but I received a seven disc set.  On the jacket, they bill the first four movies as a four-part pilot.
The only reason I withheld a star is the transfer to disc doesn't look much better than VHS.... but it's still very enjoyable.",1330041600,,751,4.3120567375886525

For example, what happened to all the later episodes, where, after Dr. Kitteridge's fake death from a car bomb, her android dupe gets activated by Jake Cardigan from a cryptic email that he gets when visiting her old lab.  Then after her android double gets online, they go off together and solve further crimes?

 Tekwar has fun quirky characters, cool gizmos, good looking actors, good (for the time it was produced) special effects and William Shatner turns up to give words of ""wisdom"" form time to time.
 Some social and political themes are woven into the stories so there's something to think about.

There are a lot of take-offs on the general theme: futuristic life where a futuristic crime is chased by police.. Greg Evigan played the main character, Jake Cardigan who works for a secret orgnaization headed by  a character played by William Shatner. It's got computer hacking, futuristic driving, and a antagonistic robot police officer who questions Jake's actions out side of police purview.  But there is humor, too. The special effects are dated but suit the show. Fpr its age, I still find it 10 times more interesting and engaging than some made recently.",1439337600,,702,4.940677966101695
