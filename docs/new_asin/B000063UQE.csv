7959770,3,B000063UQE,"I've only had a brief opportunity to view this DVD.  The quality is okay.  Looks like a VHS source that used a scratchy source print.
This film claims to be 'The Tournament' on the box.  This is not the case.  Angela Mao is nowhere in the film.  Neither is Whang In Sik.  This film is actually known as 'Manchu Boxer' from 1974.  Filmed in South Korea, it stars Lau Wing (the son from 'Big Boss') as a chinese boxer fighting in South Korea.  Sammo Hung and Wilson Tong are also in this film.
The fight scenes, from what I could see, are average early 70's chop socky stuff.  I thought the fighting in 'When Tae Kwan Do Strikes', which is available as 'Sting of The Dragon Masters', was way better, even though both films had action direction by Sammo Hung.",1071619200,3,756,4.3428571428571425
