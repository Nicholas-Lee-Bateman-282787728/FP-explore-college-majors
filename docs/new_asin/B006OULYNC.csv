8502436,4,B006OULYNC,"I really enjoyed the depth, shots and diversity of this biking vid. The 3D looked great and there was all kinds of bike riding styles explored.  There are better freeride videos out there, but none of them in 3D.

The Good:
Great 3D in a sport where there are not any 3D videos. Some of the segments were mind blowing with guys jumping off cliffs, riding rocks with no eyesight and the crazy Redbull Rampage bonus segment.  My son really enjoyed the bmx trail jumping segment. There were 2 segments that told a story about the riders and background. It was also very cool that there was information/contacts on how to preserve your local dirt jumps.

The bad:
Amongst the mind-blowing segements were also some filler segments with less definition. Not very much dialogue- I think it would have been cool to have more story telling about the riders and background.

As a 3D enthusiast it is a great vid and wish more 3D bike vids were on the market.",1388707200,,948,4.552941176470588
8502437,4,B006OULYNC,"I enjoyed this video very much.  It's a riding video so I expect a certain level of movement.  It's not skiing down a mountain with a helicopter following you, it's riding with the riders or zip lining along with them for a bit of it.
The interviews were good and the content was captured very well.  It has a very personal feeling in the interviews.
The popping of the riders over the dirt hills was very good.
Also the free riding / BMX bike spins and tricks was awesome.
The video also contains lots of extras at the end.
Overall the passion of riding was captured very well.",1344297600,3,578,4.333333333333333
8502438,4,B006OULYNC,This fiercely independent film maker obviously has a burning passion for the subject at hand. He captures the essence of this you-are-there experience of downhill mountain biking action with great skill and compelling visuals. My favorite segment is the awesome run of mountain bikers navigating one whoop-de-do jump after another shot from the perspective of the cameraman suspended from a zip-line careening down the mountainside. This sequence is worth the price alone. Enjoy!,1335484800,4,479,5.575342465753424
8502439,1,B006OULYNC,"I don't write reviews, im not here to hype a good movie or bash a bad one.  This just isn't what i expected.  Its not 1920x1080  its 1280x720 and looks like it was recorded with an HTC EVO 3D.  Its very grainy, audio is crappy and reminds me of a VHS tape.  footage didn't utilize 3D whatsoever.  barely any depth, i mean a 2D movie converted to 3D with a basic program would have looked better.  Impossible to rip off the disc into Full SBS with dvdfab or anydvdHD.

I own every single 3D bluray ever made, i have a problem... so i had to buy this one and out of all 167 that i have,  this one is in the bottom 3

poor video quality
poor audio
overall boring
no 3D depth
made by amateurs

A fair price for this would be $11.99 shipped.  don't waste $25 like me.  This entire disc would fit on a dual layer dvd.  its under 9Gb !!

R-R-RRRIP off !!!",1334448000,5,848,3.9940119760479043
