6670743,5,B00NMMC3VM,"This series is not only a western but it follows the history of the railroad going west from WyomIng west !The casting for the characters are excellent and you feel as if are there as history is being made!
The story follows the life of Cullen Bohanan post Civil was where he fought for the Confideracy and returns to his farm only to be faced with a terrible tragedy! He seeks revenge on Union solders and to do so has to work on the railroad going west. What follows is a series of adventures that are so compelling that you have to find out what happens next! I am looking forward to the conclusion of this story in season 5-6!",1456790400,2,630,4.258333333333334
