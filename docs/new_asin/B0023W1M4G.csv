In terms of the information and locations included, I would give it 5 stars.  There is a LARGE amount of information, and each traveler offers 45min+ of film time.  For the money, this is awesome.  What was not so awesome, in my opinion, were the travelers themselves and the way they presented the information.  I am a middle school teacher, so I watched the video with a very critical eye (trying to decide whether it would be interesting or not to my students...which usually just translates into, ""Was I bored when I was watching this or not?"").  Only one of the videos included made it into my classroom.  Here is my humble (and very critical) opinion of each video.

Zay Harding (Cameroon) was annoying because, rather than sharing something insightful, I would make inane comments (such as make jokes with a chief about his virility, or, in reference to the men feeding the hippos: ""These guys are crazy!""). If the comments had been funny, it would have been different--they were not.  This portion of the video really seemed more focused on Zay enjoying his time rather than him sharing with us about the country.

Justine Shapiro (Benin, Burkin Faso & Mali) was okay, but a little too dramatic for me.  Granted, she did have some very heavy subject matter, but I feel like she went a little over the top (the eerie music and ghost-like effects did not make her coverage of the slave trade more serious but rather had the opposite effective).  I honestly couldn't wait for her part of the video to end.

Megan McCormick (Ghana & the Ivory Coast), in comparison, was FANTASTIC! Her locations were interesting, and her presentation was usually engaging and often pleasantly humorous (although she there were a few moments when she was forcing it).  I loved the wedding at the end, as well as her boat ride with the fisherman in the Ivory Coast.  Her presentation of the slave trade, unlike that of Justine Shapiro, was honest, somber, and direct without going overboard (no creepy music, just the real weight of the atrocious events themselves).

I will not review Zoe Palmer (Cape Verde & Senegal) because she was so deadpan that I did not finish her part of the program.  The second half could have been much better.

CONCLUSION: None of the videos on this disk would be completely school appropriate due to content.  I personally use Megan McCormick's video, but I skip the deer hunt and cover up the screen with they sacrifice the chicken during the wedding.  Ms. McCormick's section of the video was worth the money (alone, I would have given it 4 1/2 stars).  I never use the rest of the desk...

I hope this was helpful!  If you are not a teacher, I apologize for not being more helpful for whatever you might need the video for.",1291593600,13,2842,4.651302605210421
