1378252,5,B00004YS8Q,"MARENGO FILMS IS PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE NEW VERSION OF THE SHADOW OF THE EAGLE IS AVAILABLE NOW. THE COMPANY RE-MASTERED THE FILM INTO CHAPTER FORMAT IN ADDITION THEY DID ANOTHER SOUND DESIGN, COLOR CORRECTIONS AND NEW CHAPTER CARDS. THIS DVD IS NOW THE BEST VERSION OF THIS SERIAL ON THE MARKET.",1103846400,4,300,4.679245283018868
1378253,5,B00004YS8Q,It is great to see John Wayne in the early years . It was both funny and action packed and comsidering it was 70 years ago it was of a great quality .,1056240000,7,150,3.5757575757575757
1378254,5,B00004YS8Q,This 1932 12 chapter film is very good for its time. The thing that appeals to to me is there was no sensorship in those days. That means (in my view ) they are more entertaining to watch.,1025740800,2,188,3.973684210526316
1378255,1,B00004YS8Q,If you are a true serial fanatic you won't like this DVD. It's the feature version. I was surprised because there is a full 12 chapter VHS version.,1021075200,7,147,4.285714285714286
1378256,3,B00004YS8Q,After getting in touch with Marengo they explained to me that more viewers prefer the featurized-versions. That's why they've done it that way. But by mistake they forgot to mention it on the cover. A correct serial-version is in consideration for sometimes in the future. So my anger is calmed down - especially after checking my old tape of this serial - it has all the cliffhangers but picture and sound are far below that of the Marengo-DVD. So until a definitive versions turns up let's say: better than nothing.,981936000,6,517,4.7555555555555555
1378257,5,B00004YS8Q,"Bravo, Marengo Films, Bravo!  They have done an outstanding job of transfering this 70 year old film to DVD.  There is virtual no hiss on the soundtrack, and the print is the finest I've ever seen.  Be aware that this is a public domain title, so it's not in pristen shape.  But I've been viewing this film for the last 12 years on video, and by far, this is the best.  One last aspect of this transfer that I enjoyed is that Marengo Films has cut out those annoying summary's and cerdits between each chapter.  Again, great job Marengo Films; hope you eventually produce more of John Wayne's B western films!",978134400,9,609,4.441441441441442
1378258,5,B00004YS8Q,"This 1932 serial starring John Wayne (a very young one) is packed with all twelve episodes, as 1 feature film. Wayne plays a pilot who is trying to solve a mystery of a stolen invention. The quality of this print is wonderful and is the first time available on DVD.  Good work Marengo Films!",976579200,11,291,4.388888888888889

7927726,2,B00004YS8Q,The 1932 serial Shadow of the Eagle stars John Wayne in one of the many films he made before he became a major star. It is not a western. John Wayne  plays a(then) modern day pilot fighting the bad guys and winning the heart of a young lady.  It is a boring film that I think even hard-core fans of John Wayne will not enjoy.,1357862400,2,325,3.9846153846153847
7927727,3,B00004YS8Q,"I viewed this film on the John Wayne Tribute Collection from Mill Creek, which has decent picture and sound, but the chapter credits are cut off except for the lead and tail of the film.

If you are interested in a lot of flying, you would be disappointed.  Wayne's biplane is seen much in episode 1, but then only in bits in episodes 2, 6, 7, 10, 11 and 12.  The sky written warnings from The Eagle are animated shots.  Most of the action takes place on foot and in automobiles.

For me, the plot was too thin to hold much interest, with a lot of back and forth to keep you guessing on who the mysterious Eagle turned out to be.  It is more of a historical curiosity of the Duke early in his career.

It was also interesting thing seeing the 1931/2 California environs used for shooting.  One building has Van Nuys as part of it's name, but I don't know if the exteriors were shot solely there.",1349654400,4,895,4.223529411764706
7927728,3,B00004YS8Q,"Back...and forth...and back...and forth...

  He's the Eagle! No, HE'S the Eagle! Suprise! I'M the Eagle! Wait? YOU'RE the Eagle? But that's impossible...because I'M the Eagle!

  It's not a bad serial. Quite the opposite. John Wayne looks AWESOME in his classic, retro-heroic getup (JODHPURS! He's runnin' around in a button-up jacket and jodhpurs! All he needs is the helmet and jetpack, and he'd be the Rocketeer!), and he's got good, solid help from a bunch of circus performers. The tough-talkin' midget, blustering strongman and sly ventriloquist all have their seperate chances to shine, as well as his cute girlfriend, who parachutes from John Waynes plane as part of their act. The effects are almost cute, as granules if sand or salt are filmed against a glass background to simulate smoke, when ""The Eagle"" is leaving his deadly sky messages...but...

  But honestly...nothing seems to happen. I don't mean there's not ACTION! There's that all day long, and in double helpings...but it's all from the circus, to the office, to the circus, to the office, to the circus...

  You've got the plans! No, I'VE got the plans! Wait! HE HAS THE PLANS!

  (Fools! Little do they dream that I have the plans! Wait! Where did they go?)

  there are some nice touches here and there (when the henchmen attack the inventor in public, and are stopped by the police, the henchman calmly says ""I'm a private detective, and this poor fellow's insane. Escaped from an asylum. Thinks he's a brilliant inventor, and that everyone's trying to steal his inventions."" and the inventor says ""You're lying! I AM a brilliant inventor, and these people are trying to steal my inventions!""

  The cops of course, let the ""detectives"" take the ""lunatic"" away.

  Sigh...the Eagle. He does...nothing. He's got a radio controlled plan and tons of henchmen, but he just seems to blunder about, failing to kill ANY of the real targets. Just another goy in a slouch hat and trenchcoat with the collar turned up. The Crimson Ghost he ain't. Heck, he isn't even the Wrecker!

  Still, lots to like about it. Great hero. Great sidekicks. Good henchmen. Blah villain. The plots easy to follow, but the back-and-forth nature of the story is distracting. But hey, for 7.98 it's a great value.",1329436800,4,2263,4.93368700265252
7927729,1,B00004YS8Q,"It is difficult to favorably review an old movie serial such as this. ""Shadow of the Eagle"" barely deserves to be cited as a work of that greatest of movie star heroes, John Wayne, yet films such as this one in fact were key elements in prepping him for stardom. This is exactly the sort of film that served as an action/adventure training ground for Duke Wayne. No, there is no outstanding art in this production. This film has cheapness written all over it. Is it entertaining? Measurably, the answer is yes. Why wouldn't we enjoy great fistfights between the likes of John Wayne, and a villain like stunt expert Yakima Canutt (who plays one of the henchmen, Boyle)? Serials were designed to deliver lots of action, and this one is no exception. In attempting to put myself into the shoes of audiences back in 1932 I am sure that they had few complaints about ""Shadow."" I will not say it is among the best serials, however. The producers were so parsimonious that they hardly produced a music score. You are treated to pipe organ carnival music over the chapter title cards. Most of the acting performances are so lame that John Wayne comes across as a Thespian by comparison. As for film restoration, it is so-so. The picture quality is quite good for an old black and white serial. The sound restoration is below average. I had to keep cranking up the volume on my tv set. This is a film for people who love old time movie serials, or those attempting to collect anything John Wayne appeared in. For the former, I think this one is below average. However, I am fascinated in seeing the progressive evolution of John Wayne as the greatest action star who ever lived. I am one of those folks collecting John Wayne films, so I was quite happy to add it to my library. Heck, it is still better than seeing John Wayne play second fiddle to Colonel Tim McCoy in ""Texas Cyclone.""",1192492800,,1876,4.520588235294118

Great job by Passport Video for releasing ""The John Wayne Cliffhanger Collection (1932/33), the digital transfere with a clean, clear and crisp print...looking forward to more high quality releases from the vintage serial era of the '20s, '30s & '40s...order your copy now from Amazon or Passport Video where there are plenty of copies available on DVD, stay tuned once again for top notch action mixed with deadly adventure...just the way we like 'em

7927732,4,B00004YS8Q,"Marengo Films decided to add back in the chapter stops to this latest version of 'Shadow Of The Eagle', and honestly, I have no idea why.  What was a unique move on their part by eliminating the repetitive summaries between each chapter, is now back again...adding an unnecessary 40 minutes more to the viewing time.  I'm glad I still have the original version they put out, as this version is just like every other one out there on the market.  It's a shame they never put out 'The Hurricane Express' and 'The Three Musketeers' serials without the summary chapters as well.  The first version of Marengo Films 'Eagle' is the one that really soars!",1124928000,2,648,4.657894736842105
