8011434,1,B0001EQI7E,"Were I involved with this project, I would have been embarrassed to release it. Quite frankly, one of the worst commercially released films I have ever seen.
Forget any bias one might have about the subject matter. This is strictly a commentary on the production values and the craftmanship (or lack thereof) executed in the making of this film. Every facet of this film- the writing, the cinematography, the acting, the effects, the pacing - are just downright bad.",1198627200,3,466,4.9113924050632916
8011435,5,B0001EQI7E,"I appreciated the unique take on this one -- it's NOT just your typical the-whole-world-revolves-around-us-Americans-even-during-the-rapture flick. No, although the plot does revolve around 3 Americans, it sets them down in an exotic location (the Philippines) & challenges them to get back home (to America) after the rapture hits.

Which I think effectively drives home the fact that EVERYONE -- all over the world! -- will be affected by the rapture. Everyone EVERYWHERE will be disoriented & afraid. And EVERYTHING will change.

I do agree that the plot meanders a bit, but, then again, the 3 hotshot American attorneys were in the Philippines on a mission: to defend their multi-national client. So, when the rapture hit, it completely threw them off-course. Their ""mission"" then became a matter of survival & an attempt to escape a foreign country that was quickly threatening to become their prison &/or their collective graveyard.

And, for that reason, I think the movie works.

That said, I did enjoy the movie a lot better the second time around with the director's commentary on. Even so, I'm still wondering why the trip to the top of the cross had to be made? It was very dramatic & resolved things for each of the characters involved, but it just seemed so unnecessary ... Did I miss something?

I also love the soundtrack (I'm referring to the CD) -- the opening track is very moving. Definitely worth having.",1164412800,6,1425,4.970588235294118
8011436,1,B0001EQI7E,"I am a christian who loves God.  This movie was a waste of money.  Sorry!  I feel bad for the people who made it, but it was awful.  Unrealistic, difficult to understand.  Do not show this to nonchristians, they will laugh at you!",1148256000,4,230,4.255813953488372
8011437,1,B0001EQI7E,"The acting is bad, the writing is bad, the directing is bad! Basically everything about this movie is bad!

When they were in the armored vehicle being shot at, why didn't they just close the door?

The hailstones would have easily crushed through the cover they were hiding under.

Why did those two guys just leave the motorcycles out running while they went to the johns?

The girl is shot, yet she manages to make it to the cross, and then manages to climb all of those stairs to the top. Yeah right!

There are so many holes in this movie!",1147392000,4,544,4.346534653465347
8011438,2,B0001EQI7E,"If you are a Christian looking for a quality movie to watch, please reconsider watching ""Gone"". The acting is very weak, the story predictable and very dry, and the feel of the movie? Over-dramatic. Most Christians are accustomed to the many bad films currently flooding the Christian market - Megiddo, etc. This is another.

This movie came out about the same time as the Passion of the Christ, and was marketed extensively on Google. I decided to buy it, and after watching the first 15 minutes, felt like I was not being a good steward of my money.

Christian film makers need to begin with a good story if they want to catch the eye of non-Christians, and not just with over-dramatic threats. No non-Christian takes this hokey, cartoonish cinema seriously. God didn't give us creative skills to make caricatures of ourselves.

Horrendous filmmaking. Give your money to a charity instead.

""Brilliant Film... Well-Crafted And Convincing... Loved it!""

Yea right! This movie was so lame that it was laughable... and confusing. The acting was horrible; it might as well have been a movie created by college kids. And the special effects were terrible, not realistic or convincing at all. This looks like a real short-budget film. From the looks of it, this is one of the worst-directed movies I've seen. And might I add that the director also starred in this movie; his acting was the worst.

As for the accuracy of the movie's portrayal of the Armageddon, I can't argue on because I don't know the details. However, I got the impression this movie was only a tactic by certain Christians to invoke a well-asserted fear of the ""end to come"" and the ""last days."" It may as well have had less to do with movie-making and more to do with getting everyone else to open up their Bibles.",1116201600,4,966,4.508571428571429
8011440,2,B0001EQI7E,"This is a dark movie about dark times.  Yet the dreamlike quality of the film--similar to Eyes Wide Shut--the emptiness of the sets (Manila is NOT a sparcely populated city!) and the poor sound quality of the dialogue all made this a difficult watch.  Additionally, the ""wonder if God is real"" and ""how can a loving God allow so much evil"" dialogue seemed more like what you would hear in college dorms then at the end of the world.

GONE fits in the Christian apocalytic genre, and as such, should be able to compete against the Left Behind movies, the Apoclypse series, and Omega Code I & II.  This one settles at least one, if not two tiers below these others, and even they generally only rate 3-stars.

Bottom-line:  There are better films in this genre, and still Christians are awaiting a five-star production with the power of the Passion of the Christ, to communicate the all important message that the Day of Judgment is real and imminent!  GONE offers a true message, but the quality barely reaches mediocre.",1114128000,6,1019,4.659217877094972
8011441,3,B0001EQI7E,"This has to be one of the lamest films I've ever seen, made on what must have been a shoe-string budget, but it is also, perhaps because I like the premise, quite entertaining; the script meanders, and one has to wonder how much was actually written down, and how much was on the fly improvisation...as some of it sounds like what one can hear in an acting class exercise.

It is an end-times plot that centers on three young lawyers who go to Manila on a case, are warned by a blind man to repent because the end of the world is at hand, and lo and behold ! the blind man was right.

There is a nifty rapture sequence on a bridge, and some nice cheesy special effects afterwards, with hail as big as bowling balls, and the sea turning red with blood, as they wander around in a ""hell on earth"" scenario looking for water, which is now the world's most precious commodity, and ponder the existence of God.

Starring two actors from the ""Survivor"" TV series, Dirk Been and Joel Klug, Philippine actress Bianca Lapus, as well as Tim Chey, who wrote, directed, and produced this film (Tim also directed ""Fakin' Da Funk"" in '97), and it has a score by Daniel Bijan and Sherwin Castillo, which features some pleasant songs.

This movie is not as brain-dead as some of the fare that Hollywood dishes out, and despite its 101 flaws, remains watchable, and is short and sweet at  77 minutes.
