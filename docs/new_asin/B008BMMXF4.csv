5146306,5,B008BMMXF4,This movie was just what I needed to kick start my health.  It actually had me tearing up at a few parts...it was an emotional release that I needed.  Well worth the money.  I also appreciate the fact that many of the health experts that I've been following for years that advocate natural healing were featured in this film (aka Daniel Vitalis).  Thank you for this wonderful film!,1349395200,,382,4.573529411764706

I loved that all the information was so neatly packaged in a line...why did this happen, how can we change it and what can we expect...I loved it.",1349395200,4,292,4.425925925925926
5146308,1,B008BMMXF4,"One star?

I just wanted to get your attention. This film is mandatory. It's important beyond words. Buy it, let your loved ones borrow it, and pay it forward.

My journey started with ""Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead"". I started juicing and I really liked it. You can really feel the difference inside and out. But over the course of a year I was still floundering about, still holding extra weight, still eating the wrong things aside from juicing. ""Food Matters"" took me deeper and inspired me all over again. Now ""Hungry For Change"" has gone deeper still, and laid it all out there in a way anyone can clearly understand.

We have an opportunity to change our lives (and it REALLY WORKS!). I say again - IT REALLY WORKS! All those wonderful veggies, fruits, and superfoods have been here all along and most of us have ignored them in favor of what The Man sells us. I've found these films empowering and honestly some of the most important works of our time.

Watching these films is like taking the red pill and uncovering the Matrix for the first time - seeing things as they truly are. And things are ugly folks. The good news is that we can change. Take the power back!",1349308800,21,1172,4.462616822429907
5146309,5,B008BMMXF4,"My sister forced me to watch this as I was VERY busy...but let me tell you it was the MOST awe-inspiring and eye opening film I've seen in a long time. I was SHOCKED at some of the revelations in this film about dieting foods, the deception of the food industry and the truth about what they do to your body.

I've made EVERYONE I know watch this including my 9 year old son. My youngest son who is just 3, has TERRIBLE eczema which no amount of prescribed steroids could cure - until I started juicing and implementing everything from this video - lo and behold, a very nasty patch of eczema (which had NOT stopped bleeding and scratching for the last 4 months) finally healed over after just ONE week. I lost 16lbs in 3 weeks and my skin looked amazing, my nails shined and those nasty dark circles definitely lightened up. In fact, my energy levels soared (I was permanently hooked on chocolates and caffeine), my chocolate addiction gone and wow - I'm sleeping better than I ever have in my life.

By far the best program for life-long change and health I've ever seen or tried.",1349308800,,1082,4.405
5146310,5,B008BMMXF4,"I commend the filmmakers for doing a terrific job in both explaining what we need to do for our health, and motivating us to do it.  We are constantly barraged with incentives to eat poorly. Finally powerful and compelling reasons to change, including strategies for doing so.  Look up their website hungryforchange.tv (I think) and sign up for their updates.  They have been very helpful.

I am pre-ordering the book that is associated with this movie.  Highly recommended.",1348704000,3,474,5.0256410256410255

I LOVE THE EXPLANATION ON DIET COKE ADDICTS BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE THAT CAN NOT GIVE UP DIET COKE AND NOW I KNOW WHY.  THIS MOVIE WILL NOT DUMP A BUNCH OF ""ALL FOOD ON THE MARKET IS PROCESSED THEREFORE BAD FOR YOU"" AND LEAVE YOU CLUELESS ABOUT WHAT TO DO NEXT. INSTEAD ITS THE TYPE OF MOVIE THAT HAS TONS OF ESSENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE FOOD AND BEVERAGE ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE OUT THERE.

5146313,5,B008BMMXF4,"This film is amazing. I have watched a lot of food and health related documentaries, so I was skeptical at paying a high price for another one. After watching the trailer though I was hooked and had to get it! After watching it, I'm glad I did. This film was very well produced and has such a wealth of knowledge, that even for people who have seen or read a ton on nutrition and food there is still more information for you here, and it's presented in such a welcoming way that I think it is especially great for the people who are just beginning to want to change their health for the better.

5146324,5,B008BMMXF4,"Excellent information! Sheds light on how what we are eating is making us sick and also the fattest nation in the world. The second half sheds light on how our bodies are producing more and more stress hormones and how deep sleep metabolizes these damaging effects.  Visualization is discussed, self love, healthy habits. This was an excellent reminder for me as I start personal healing- mentally, emotionally, and physically. Sleep more, Exercise, Laugh more. Detox foods are discussed- Cilantro, Parsley, Spirolina, Chia Seeds, Aloe Vera etc. I love the doctors quote near the end when she discusses Self Love. She says, As a doctor, let me tell you what self love does. It improves your hearing, your eyesight, it lowers your blood pressure, increases pulmonary function, cardiac output..... if we had an epidemic of self love, then our health would go up and our health care costs would go down. Well worth the watch.",1482883200,7,922,4.987012987012987
5146325,3,B008BMMXF4,Starts out okay.  Points out mostly things that I already knew about health and food but perhaps some of the target audience doesn't know.  The side plot of the very insecure girl losing weight was very stereotypical and annoying.  I don't believe that added anything positive to the documentary at all.  A little past half way it seemed to turn into a juicing commercial - really strange.,1482710400,5,389,4.7611940298507465

Though, I don't think it would be as effective to those who are already well educated. However, I think the experts that state their own situations and opinions, was a nice addition to the whole documentary. However, I did think that at some parts it felt unprofessional. But overall it was packed with knowledge that I now have. Most documentaries mention what we are buying/eating now is not real food, however, this documentary discussed this information rather lovely. It makes me want to focus on my path to bettering myself for good. I realized while watching this documentary, how accustomed we have became to unhealthy food. If anyone plans to watch a documentary to give you the motivation to do better, watch this one! It is very helpful. Overall, I enjoyed it.",1481587200,,921,4.872611464968153
5146328,5,B008BMMXF4,"Hungry For Change is absolutely amazing. It unveils the truth about the food industry and how it negatively effects us. Some of the facts mentioned in the documentary were known to me already because of having a health freak mother, but Jamie Oliver went into a deeper analysis that left me stunned.

Throughout the film, a fictional piece goes on where a woman can't seem to feel good about herself. Her emotions directly correlate with her eating habits and bad nutrition. This is all explained by nutrition experts thoroughly by using plenty of statistics and evidence to prove their points. THE FOOD WE ARE EATING IS NOT REALLY FOOD!!! This is a major theme in the film. The experts state that we are eating emptiness because it is a marketing technique to get us to buy more food. The ""food"" in grocery stores are processed and are not filling us up because the nutrition that our bodies need is not present in the modified food.

5/5 recommend this film for anybody. The key to feeling better starts within and eating healthy and knowing the benefits of whole, real food will change your outlook on life.",1481587200,,1110,4.687179487179487
5146329,5,B008BMMXF4,"I just want to say that this documentary was not that bad at all. It explained a couple of things that I was not aware of. Some things that stood out to me was said ""we are not eating food anymore, we are eating food-like products"" which is exactly right. We eat high calories and not enough nutrition. And ""sugar is the cocaine of the food world"". The food like products that we eat is like nicotine in a cigarette. Our bodies are becoming addicted to unhealthy food and we are not being cautious enough. Majority of the things we eat is the cause of our own health problems. Cancer is one of them, diabeties, high blood pressure etc. If we do not take control now, our last breath would probably be the cause of drowning in sugar, grease, or any other unhealthy foods. Overall I liked the documentary. It was very informative and very well detailed. Thanks!",1481328000,,859,4.443037974683544

I don't know what some of the people are meaning that they ""ran out and bought a juicer"".....I mean, I had already watched the video on juicing a couple of years ago. It's their own fault if they didn't have enough sense to watch it w/o thinking that that was the message. It WASN'T. It shows the complexity of the companies to get us addicted to the foods that they sell so that we are a customer ""for life"".

5146354,3,B008BMMXF4,"I enjoyed watching this movie, to an extent. I wanted to watch something supportive of the healthier lifestyle I am now choosing,  as far as food choices, higher nutrition and a plant based diet.
 I was hoping that it would be motivating to remind me of, at least part of the reason I am choosing this lifestyle.
It was okay. I didn't learn anything new.
 If you're not new to new age nutrition, then you've heard from David, the raw foodist, who owns a business selling superfoods. He's also written several books, the recipes are okay, the food taste good, and there's some scientific information in his books, but a lot of it is simplistic, radical, & very controversial. He has poems he's written in there that truly suck.
 The guy used to be a lawyer. He is intelligent , but so radical,  there's not a lot of people that are going to  want to become a new age hippie, to stop washing their hair with sodium lauryl sulfate, and eat coconuts, papayas, sprouts & flax crackers, with raw cocoa nibs and goji berries for their main meals.
It's some of the best food on the planet, I am sure,  even some as far as taste goes, but Taste goes  you're certainly not going to find it in a restaurant anywhere, or remotely close to what your family wants to eat for Thanksgiving dinner.  So the whole lifestyle is so socially different,  there's very few people that are going to adopt that. Anyway, I believe in a lot of what he  said, as well as other people on here.
I don't really care if they're experts or what. If you ask, me some things that the experts tell us to do are completely crazy, and unhealthy,  and unrealistic, and it's true  because we're all getting fat sick and nearly dead listening to them.  Also in there I think I saw dr. Mercola, you know his financial investment in things, although he's a brilliant genius doctor. He's clearly Dynamic and healthy; I'll give him that. There is the guy who did the movie Fat Sick & Nearly Dead, and some of the doctors in there.
And Christine Northrup, even my husband knew who she was and he's a man and she writes about women's health. Her books are selling like hotcakes, still. Then, Jamie Oliver what a great guy helping kids get better nutrition. Truthfully though, a lot of movie was just kind of boring.
A lot of people didn't like the second half of the movie, where they kind of get spiritual about the whole thing,  talking about, well, it's kind of like a self-help book,  related issues to help fight illness, how you should love yourself, deal with your past, or abuse issues, things like that. They talk about addictions, to sugar, alcohol, smoking, overwork, fast food, and workaholic emptiness.
To their credit, they tell their own stories, a little bit along the lines of 12 step programs where they say you should give your own experience, strength, and Hope instead of advise.
Anyway, cheesy as those things are, a lot of them are just plain truth.
Worth watching, especially if you can do something while watching it and just kind of have it on in the background absorbing it. C plus.",1468281600,2,3062,4.509945750452079

They did however mention nicotine as the being the reason for cigarette addiction which isn't really true.  It's MAO inhibitors which are like anti-depressants.  And they also mentioned Propolyne Glycol being used in anti-freeze but failed to state it's used to lower the toxicity of it or the fact it is used in inhalers for asthma.  Don't get me wrong I agree with the basis for the documentary because the majority of it is true but using misinformation ruined it for me.  Food Matters is a great documentary which my wife and I have purchased for friends and co-workers but this one from what I saw was poorly conceived.

5146432,4,B008BMMXF4,"As a nurse and having read and seen a lot of documentary's on this subject and putting together a lot of information for better health that I adhere to this one contributed to the notion that plant based diet was best, good carbohydrates and good fats were not  ""evil"" and  processed foods have too many chemicals as well as many foods do and that you were stepping on a big food bomb every time you left your home. Those in the documentary changed their lifestyles and found a path to miss those food bombs on a daily basis and did prove that healthy eating leads to feeling, well, healthy. No doubt this a gift we could be giving ourselves every day because we can get in control of it. I agree with this documentary that dieting does not work, that making gradual changes and replacing food items one consumes with a healthier version leads to small success's and in time a bigger victory. I didn't see the plug at the end for a life of juicing but juicing as a means to an end, that is to get more of the ""colors"" of vegetables and fruits in your system fast. I also agree 100% from my own lifestyle that one eats the ""good"" stuff first until it becomes a habit and the ""bad"" stuff will be less tempting to you.",1452988800,,1215,4.278260869565218

5146436,2,B008BMMXF4,"I approached this documentary with an open mind. There is no question that something is making us fat. Is it environmental? Our sedentary lifestyles? Too much sugar? Too much processed food? All of the above? Anyone with a well supported theory will at least get my attention and consideration.

So what's the issue? Well, the panel of experts in this documentary do a fantastic job of pointing out the problem, but they're woefully short on presenting any sort of fact-based solutions. Mostly what you get are a bunch of people running their mouths about all the scary things that lurk in the supermarket.

Here's a quick tip: Any time you hear a naturalist start talking about toxins, your radar should engage. Anything at a high enough level can be toxic, including water. It's the DOSE that makes the toxin (or carcinogen). So unless someone can point to a credible, peer reviewed study lending evidence that a particular substance is harmful AT A LEVEL THAT MIGHT REASONABLY BE CONSUMED BY HUMANS, then they're simply using emotional based manipulation to convince.

Hungry for Change thrives on this technique. I counted only one study referenced in the entire film. For example, the scare tactics regarding hormones in milk sound quite alaming until one considers that 1) even organic milk contains cow growth hormone and 2) these hormones are broken down by our stomach enzymes and are no threat to humans.

And then there's the 20 minute veer into the miracle of juicing which conveniently ignores that 1) juicing destroys healthful plant fiber and 2) any plant will begin to lose nutrients and anti-oxidents as soon as it's broken down--meaning if you juice and then save the product for later, you're robbing yourself of many health benefits that you could obtain by simply eating raw fruits and vegetables.

Oh, and let's not forget some of the shady characters featured within. Google ""David Wolfe scam"" and watch some of the quackery this ""world reknowned nutritionist' is sellng. I'm talking looney tunes stuff like gravity is not real, but a construct of the mind and ""Cacao is on the same octave as the sun, its on the same octave as love..."" What? I'm supposed to take dietary advice from this crank? Nope.

Overall, I think there are some good messages here--the overconsumption of sugar and high fructose corn syrup is driving a lot of our problem with obsesity, in my opinion, but I just can't endorse the shoddy ""science"" presented within.",1450915200,6,2461,4.918072289156626

5146438,2,B008BMMXF4,"The film had a good over-all message: avoid fad diets, eat minimally processed foods, eat mainly vegetables. The film was primarily footage of interviews with people who had written books on nutrition or weight loss, who seemed to have variable degrees of expertise. Despite a promising thesis, many of the details appeared unscientific and misleading, for example, interviewees plugged an indiscriminate fear of 'chemical' food additives, and endorsed ""detoxing"". The film generally did not try to substantiate its advice with supporting evidence.

In spite of the tagline, ""Hungry for Change exposes shocking secrets the diet, weight loss and food industries don't want you to know about deceptive strategies designed to keep you coming back for more"" -- the practices of the diet, weight loss and food industries was not a major focus of the film.",1449360000,4,850,5.296296296296297

5146472,3,B008BMMXF4,"WEAK ON CURRENT SCIENCE.
After seeing it twice, I agree with much (but not all) of the positive five star reviews. Out of respect for those who READ reviews, I'll not repeat everything that I like about the presentation. I found the goofy oversize earrings, hairdo, and facial hair arrangement of Daniel Vitalis, (described as a ""Wild Food Expert"") distracting. UGH. Ditto for David Wolfe, who had an extremely goofy wild hairdo. On the other hand, Jon Gabriel, described as an ""author and weight loss expert"" was nicely groomed and a good presenter. His story of personal transformation of a fellow of over 400 pounds (whew) to becoming a jock of normal weight was inspiring. Christiane Northrup preserves her rank as one of America's cutest doctors. A really nice looking woman! Presentations by Dr. Mercola, Jason Vale, Kris Carr, Alejandro Junger were fine. It was disappointing to have Jamie Oliver (so popular in the UK) give Baby Cow Growth Fluid a pass with unscientific but popular ideas on milk. None of the presenters had anything (ZILCH) to say about the work of Doctor T. Colin Campbell. Milk does a body bad. It was good to see all presenters take a stand against sugar. They all agreed on the evils of sugar and refined carbohydrates. With all respect to Dr. Northrup, her ""It's not fat that makes you fat - it's sugar"" statement will not pass muster in the community of experts. Recognizing the evils of sugar should NOT be mutually exclusive to recognizing the proven dangers of fat - particularly fat from dead animals - and EXTRACTED fat of ALL kinds.

5146476,5,B008BMMXF4,"One of those documentaries that is almost depressing at first, but stick with it. I wonder if I would rate it differently if I wasn't already on the quest to eating healthier and loving myself from the inside out. I've struggled my whole life with body insecurities, crazy diets. Lose a lot of weight, gain it all back and then some. By gain and all back and then some I am not talking 25 pounds. I lost 99lbs in a year in 2007 and then gained 140 back (yes that WAS how unhealthy and awful my life was as a yo-yo) I got to a point where it was just too much. I was depressed, tired, and even when I *thought* I was eating right, I wasn't any happier.

I realized I needed a mindset change and I was ready. I read books and watched a variety of different documentaries. Hungry for Change was one of the dozen or so I've watched. it's also one I come back to. There are some really inspirational people here who have come a long way to loving themselves. If you're like me, then you could definitely use to love yourself a little bit more. Don't feel selfish. Just do it.",1444176000,11,1070,4.169082125603865

5146498,2,B008BMMXF4,"I can't believe people actually fall for this pseudo science. Aside from the fact that they rely most of their information on anecdotal or testimonial accounts (no actual scientific or clinical studies worth mentioning)... They use the same actress in the portrayal of bad eating and an unhealthy lifestyle who later seems to be, miraculously, the epitome of health. All that changes is the makeup, the smiling attitude and maybe her wardrobe. It's simplistic and very lacking. I guess it is good for the average diet obsessed, overweight individual looking for inspiration. Or people who feel dissatisfied with their weight regardless of how they actually look. The intentions are good and this is a very important issue. I'm not even saying the points are not valid (I'm an athlete who follows a pretty healthy lifestyle) but the documentary is just simplistic, flawed and even boring. It demonizes rice and bread which are so important in Asian and European diets respectively and people over there are pretty much in better health than their counterparts in the US.

I agree with them about the better eating leads to better living, so they are spot on in my opinion. And I appreciate them pointing out the things to avoid and how to know where those things are hidden (foods that contain them that you might not of thought much about). Overall, I was curious what they had to say from the start to the very end. Any docu-drama that can hold my attention for the entire film deserves credit.

However, food that is cheap to purchase comes with an added expense in that your overall health is impacted.  While many reviews refer to ""pseudo science"" claims, etc. the interviewees of this film discuss it was clear to me that they pointed out that the results of the studies vary depending upon who pays for the studies.  If Corporate American pays for the study the results say there's no evidence to suggest there are any issues with aspartame, high fructose corn syrup, etc.  However, reports from independent studies strongly suggest otherwise.  The film also points out that while we are all under the impression the FDA is looking out for our safety and welfare, the FDA uses study information provided to them by the manufacturer when evaluating products for approval and does not independent studies of its own.  Regardless of your opinion as to if aspartame, high fructose
corn syrup, BGH, etc. is negatively impacting society I think you only need to take a look at the people in your local community and the increasing numbers of people dying due to disease attributable to being overweight and consuming empty or low nutrition calories.

5146582,3,B008BMMXF4,"I've been trying to find a documentary that I can recommend to family and loved ones that is compelling and provides a great roadmap for healthy living and diet.  I've yet to find that 'go to' video. They are all rich in information and take care of certain niches that may have not been covered in other similar documentaries.  This one is a stand out in that it covers the topic of cleansing and other factors that may impact your health, i.e. not constructively dealing with life stresses or using food to cover for other areas in your life that you are not fulfilled.

It falls short - as another reviewer mentioned - in the contrived way it tries to tie all these concepts/insights together by using an 'every woman' character discovering healthy choices. My guess is that they wanted to take a step away from the standard, perhaps overused approach of using a narrator to connect the dots.  However, I found her a waste of valuable minutes that could have been better used in providing more gems of insight into healthy living.  I was particularly annoyed by the everyman/woman character's insecurities standing in an elevator with a coworker to whom she was attractedutterly cornball!

Also, it fails to draw important distinctions which are key in proper nutrition, e.g. pasta and bread is vilified, but as these foods are a staple in many folks' diets, they should have at least taken the time to point out that whole wheat versions are a reasonable option as they provide the beneficial option that shield our liver/pancreas from a sudden onslaught of sugar.  Also, they sing the praises of juicing, but not all juicing is the same.  You're better off with an orange than orange juice because orange juice acts on the same body the same way as coca cola if - as mentioned earlier - you don't have the fiber to mitigate sugar's onslaught.  You're better off juicing with a vitamix type blender that keeps the fiber intact rather than a standard juicer that leaves all the fiber behind.  That is a paramount point which should have not been overlooked.

It is definitely worth your time watching, but some misfires undermine it being that 'healthy living' blueprint I want to recommend to those I hold dear.",1428710400,,2215,4.7421875

The first half of the movie talked about how food manufacturers put unnatural things in food just to make you crave it so they can sell more.  Also using concentrated extracts from natural food is BAD.  In the second half of the movie, appeared to be a strong sales pitch for juice since the word 'juice' appears every 30 seconds or more.  I checked the website for the movie and low and behold, they sell juice that has been dehydrated (concentrated).

5146647,2,B008BMMXF4,"Some day someone will produce a scientifically-based documentary about the relationship the western world has with the multi-billion dollar food industry and how it has helped to contribute to the obesity epidemic.

This isn't it.

It all started out reasonably enough. We eat too much of the wrong foods, spurred on by a corporate empire marketing machine that has used science to maximize profits and keep us coming back for more.

I'd kill for a balanced documentary that sticks to actual science to help those addicted to carbs and processed foods put them back on the shelf and enthusiastically reach for something better. One that also realizes the modern American lifestyle requires convenient, accessible, and practical solutions that a time-pressed family can actually adopt. Buying 20lbs of organic vegetables a week from a rural organic co-op to turn into algae-colored slop isn't going to work for the vast majority of us, no matter how good it might sound to some.

As other reviewers have noted, the first 20-30 minutes of Hungry for Change seemed to be lining up a strong case for action to outwit the processed food and drink industry. Not because they are inherently evil or out to kill their customers, but because the choices we make as part of a BALANCED diet too often lean towards convenience foods that are probably fine in moderation, but not in excess.

But as usual with these kinds of documentaries, the woo-woo pseudo science starts falling out all over the place the more you let these people talk. The reasonable becomes unreasonable, the rational becomes increasingly absurd. Things started to fall apart when the unproven claims about aspartame and high fructose corn syrup turned up. By the time they started implicating dental fillings in toxic mercury poisoning I knew I was knee deep in Woo Woo Land, where science takes a back seat to increasingly strident and paranoid health claims from the granola people.

Coca-Cola wants to sell you liquid candy, Hungry for Change wants to peddle you books. You can watch Coca-Cola commercials for free, but you may have paid to watch Hungry for Change.

The people behind this documentary also gave us the completely ludicrous 2008 film Food Matters, the one that accused the medical community and food industry of being part of a giant conspiracy to keep us out of our salad bowls. In short, that film's premise was that virtually all cooked food kills. Eating raw vegetables alone makes you thrive, if you can manage to wolf down a few pounds of leafy greens every day.

Perhaps realizing no sane person is realistically going to throw away the contents of their refrigerators and pantries to make room for 20lbs of kale and lettuces one is expected to graze on for the rest of your life, Hungry for Change tries to keep you on the reservation by turning that 20lbs of leaves into delicious(?) veggie shakes. You can do that, right?

Except one of the strongest advocates for this approach is seen in the film looking like he's about to vomit after ingesting what looks like a glass of thick green algae. If he can't stomach it, how can we?

One might wonder why our food pyramid hasn't been replaced by a tree if this is the path to total nutritional salvation. These kinds of documentaries usually explain that problem away by suggesting it's a conspiracy between medical professionals, the government, and the food companies. Indeed, the scientifically unproven claims that aspartame kills your brain cells and high fructose corn syrup is poison to your body are made not based on the peer-reviewed scientific method, but by hysterical articles in organic health magazines and newsletters. The studies that say otherwise are dismissed as ""industry-funded."" In some cases this is indeed true, but there are other studies independently funded that also find no evidence to back up the filmmakers' claims.

I have the same demand of all who throw around these kinds of claims -- show me the science. Show me a study that can be repeated independently with the same results.

So who are the science-based creators of this documentary?

""James Colquhoun and Laurentine Bosch are Nutritional Consultants turned filmmakers,"" says the website. Further digging finds their credentials don't extend far beyond that, relying on a degree from the ""Global College of Natural Medicine"" -- a school listed by Quack Watch as completely devoid of recognition by any legitimate accrediting agency. In short, you could get a degree by mail and be equally qualified.

Many of the other ""experts"" in the film also lack degrees, so various creative titles are bestowed on them like a Traditional and Wild Foods Expert and a Cleansing and Detoxification Expert. Raise your hand if your accredited college offers degrees for these.

Speaking of ""detoxification,"" this too is knee-deep in Woo Woo. What happens when someone starts a ""detox"" diet is their body learns to live (temporarily) without the usual additives and lousy foods it used to expect. So you experience caffeine withdrawal, easy carbs are replaced with more complex protein which doesn't spike your sugar levels, and the often fiber-rich detox ""diet"" is likely to increase bowel movements. There is nothing wrong with taking this approach if you understand what it really is. Your body is not shedding toxins or entrapped feces, it is simply adjusting to a more responsible ""diet.""

The filmmakers have couched their juicing advocacy amidst various claims that most people would readily accept as factual, hoping to ride a credibility wave to win equal acceptance of their juicing approach. Unfortunately, just as diets are not sustainable for the long term, advocating a diet of liquid slop isn't going to work over the long haul either.

Instead, eat a sensible diet of lean meats and high quality carbs and proteins, use heart healthy oils and nuts, limit processed foods and get exercise. That is all you actually need, along with the support of others who are in the same boat. You can even juice those veggies for breakfast if you like. But don't expect them to make you cancer-free, beautiful, and a thin, well-abbed version of your former self.",1420070400,31,6176,4.980582524271845

Eating real food is obviously better than man-made, too many calories and not enough nutrients creates an obese sick person and caring for yourself is the first step in making the changes needed to live a healthier life. The clips of the girl discovering her way to a healthier life were somewhat distracting from the message but obviously used to create the emotional impact with which people can identify. More focus on the addictive properties of food, the difficulty most people have finding better food choices and the obstacles they face to improve their health could have been explored further.

5146691,5,B008BMMXF4,"Hola! I teach Health Sciences at a large University. The overall message of this documentary is very positive. Even though I disagree with some claims, I highly recommend it. Some reviews may criticize some parts of it as poorly done, or trying to sell something, etc...but as you know, no one will ever produce a film that will not have negative critics, even if such film can truly inspire 10000s to change their lives for good. This can be one of those inspiring films. Watch it if you believe you need to do more for your health or the health of your loved ones. When you decide to make changes in your lifestyle, use wisdom, do not go to extremes without knowledge of what you are doing. Read, learn, explore, and make educated choices. Test what works best for you. A healthy lifestyle in combination of searching and finding the purpose of life and your mission in life is truly a priceless gift. Someone in the documentary mentioned that if you change the way you eat or lifestyle you get to be healthy forever. That is just not true. Preserving a perfect health of body and mind is a lost battle, as eventually you and I will die. However, it is true that health is governed by natural laws, and if we live by those laws, we are more likely to enjoy higher quality of life and eventually, if it is not our time to leave this world, we will live longer with better physical, mental, social, spiritual, and emotional health. When talking about spiritual matters and purpose of life. I feel that our society is also filled with ""manufactured"" philosophies and ideas about the meaning and purpose of life. To me, the ""natural"" and genuine purpose of life comes from the genuine teachings of Christ the Lord, as taught by ancient and living prophets and apostles. You can find living prophets of the Lord in the LDS church or mormon church (mormon.org). If you are searching as well for purpose in life, besides health, I encourage you to find out by yourself. If you search and ask in faith, honesty, pure sincerity, and true intention, and trusting your heart, you will find out that purpose.
Many blessings and best wishes.
In health and truth, your friend, Joaquin.",1414108800,,2173,4.603092783505154

We're being poisoned - on purpose - by giant food conglomerates that spend billions to come up with new ways to package high calories and low nutrition into ""food-like substances"" that keep us always hungry and never satiated. We're doomed.

The big question is: who is the bigger criminal? Those profiteering food giants, or the elected officials that allow it to happen instead of hauling the evil b**stards off to prison.

Watch this movie, then try and eat only what grows out of the ground, what swims, and what walks on 4 legs. But the real challenge then becomes doing it without eating Pesticides, GMO's, Mercury, and Growth Hormones.

I have bought books, like the last one on eating according to blood type and the only thing that helped me were a few pages telling you what foods to eat and what to stay away from. It seems that the negative foods did bother my ""O"" type blood. The book was big and nice, but mainly for cooks. After hearing about Aspartame in this video, I threw away the last 3 packs of gum I was chewing every day that was addictive to me. I chewed gum because it helps me to stop thinking about food and sweets and I once heard it is good for teeth, as far as getting some food particles out. Now, I have to check the ingredients on sugar free cough drops. I cannot remember everything on video now, but I do recommend it if you want to get healthy. One guy lost weight down from 300 pounds to mostly muscle. It is hard when you are not a cook like me and healthy foods are more expensive. I have seen the people selling on the streets of DC and VA, but I don't like to pay high prices and I have this thing about cleanliness, unless it is covered fruit like apples, oranges, etc. I don't even buy sandwiches unless I see people with gloves on and sometimes they don't change them when they are doing some work behind the counter. I realized, from watching TV, that cooks at restaurants use their bare hands and I really don't like men handling my food! The only time I don't mind eating out is when I am out of town. In the old days, my grandmother and other ladies did not mind cooking. We even had turkey for Christmas and our favorite foods on Friday. Unfortunately, the sweets habit was passed down to me by mother. It usually takes me a few months to get off them again. So, what the show tells you is that anything prepackaged with all those ingredients is not good for you!!!

But first, lets start with the pros:  I like the overall message: less fat, sugar, more vegetables etc.  Cons:  I""m just not sure how scientifically rooted they are.  With a background in medicine when I heard them explain how chia seeds  removes bile, which they equate as a toxin, my alarm went off.  That's just wrong and as they went on to talk about juicing even more alarm bells went off.  Juicing is only good in moderation as even too much fruit intake will increase your blood sugar and cause stress on your liver.  Conclusion: Take what you watch with a grain of salt.

For most of my life, because it's how we're shaped by society, I've eaten cake, cookies, chocolate, etc only to feel sick afterwards. My body never liked it. I always felt that awful sugar rush and had to rush to drink a lot of water afterwords.  Basically, refined sugar and refined flour doesn't agree with me yet for most of my life, since society pushes these poisons as 'food', I continued to buy and partake. One evening last year I watched this video 'Hungry for Change' on Netflix and my life changed. I tell everyone I know (because most people I meet, work with, etc want to lose weight or stay fit), that since watching this documentary I have not been able to eat a single cookie and if I ever get weak, I find it gross to me because I understand, because of this wonderful video, that's it's not really a nutrient or real food. I want to thank the makers of this video and the contributer's whom educate us on the issue of white sugar, white flour, and processed foods that are not really food but dressed up to look like a food. I feel 100 times better physically and mentally since watching this video and plan on ordering for family members and friends.",1405296000,,1217,4.408888888888889

We are consuming more chemicals  than real food !

5146786,4,B008BMMXF4,"There are a lot of negative and dismissive reviews of this 'film'. I though it was great in that it gives one a springboard from which to leap into really looking at food. I believe that if you want to see a juicing infomercial or a bunch of pseudoscientists pimping their own products and philosophies, then that is exactly what you'll get. A thinking person will not simply watch this and take all claims as gospel truth and then buy every book every one of these claimants has published; What you should do is hear the claims and then check it out, realizing that the REAL truth about modern versions of food will likely be inaccessible to the average conscious consumer (let me put on my tin foil hat here...) because, as with pharma, and once, tobacco, there is a lot of money and vested interests in keeping consumers in the dark about what they are eating and where it comes from. Certainly a lot more money than some db hawking a juicer...

Yes, unfortunately, they chose to weave in these bits with some random representation of the Everywoman and her neuroses about food, etc...Utterly useless padding.

A lot of allusions are made to juicing and a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle, but I simply did not see it as being so overt as other reviews have made it out. And, yes, it does hammer on local, organic, minimally processed foods towards the end, but isn't that the whole friggin' point? Move away from the boxed foods that have a shelf life of 3 years and towards fresh veg!

My 5-year-old daughter now has the seed in her mind that too much sugar is bad for you, thanks to the Jamie Oliver TED Talk clip. She will watch the whole ""Sugar Movie"" over and over now, and I cannot see that as a bad thing.

I have watched this, Food Matters, Food Inc., Forks Over Knives, Frankensteer, etc...The information in all of these presentations is headed in the same direction. Some are clinical, others more personal journey, anecdotal, and some are just brutal when you see the way animals are treated when they are raised for mass market consumption...Hungry For Change is a light introduction in making you CONSCIOUS about your food.",1403913600,,2138,4.603674540682415

I feel like somebody finally turned the lights on and now I can see! I started to buy so many vegetables and fruits that I never would have eaten before.

5146816,2,B008BMMXF4,"Though this movie may be effective in moving people to care more about what they eat, a lot of the information provided is poorly sited and based on opinion more than science. As a nutrition professional who is well informed on how the food industry is hijacking our senses to make a profit while exploiting our health, this movie was very frustrating for me to watch because of its misinformation.

A person who puts out a fire in their house is not called a fire safety expert. As such, a person who is able to lose weight and writes a book about it should not be called a weight loss expert.

I agree that things need to change, but I believe that people should be motivated to change based on fact and not opinion like this movie exhibits.",1400284800,31,743,4.3768115942028984

5146820,3,B008BMMXF4,"I enjoyed watching this documentary because it really got me thinking about what I put into my body and how I can take control over the food I eat on a daily basis. It even made me purchase the book ""The Reboot with Joe Juice Diet-Lose Weight, Get Healthy and Feel Amazing"" by Joe Cross.
However the documentary was slow at times and made me zone out and start to multitask. I also wish they gave more instruction on how to change your bad eating habits instead of using the same examples of why the food we do eat is bad.
Overall it's definitely worth watching if you need something to motivate and inspire you to make better food choices",1400025600,,639,4.333333333333333

I wouldn't hesitate to send this along to a friend who was starting to question their own lifestyle, since it was very unassuming and easy to understand. It also creatively used bridges people could identify with, like dieting, to introduce healthy living rather than slamming the viewer immediately with scientific jargon. The last 10-15 minutes got a little weird, and as people mentioned here the vignettes of the woman were a liiiittle cheesy (namely the elevator scenes), but the rest was great!

For me, personally, I already knew 95% of what was discussed in the movie. I was also rather frustrated that it glossed over most topics (almost trying to be politically correct?) and didn't delve into the incredible stories of the people featured in it - which I only know because I have read about them previously.

The arc of outside- journalistic reporting on processed food to personal- most of the interviewed had personal stories bringing them back to health, profoundly back. Then going further with the final concept of  'thoughts are things' and true self help via self love. A good way to go- simply because it's true! The sub-plot was a bit cheesy of the office drone lady who 'figured it out' with her health and thoughts, but not a bad way to connect the dots. Started juicing thanks to 'Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead' and feeling much better. Thanks very much Joe Cross! Just started a running program (very slowly)....it just keeps getting better.",1399593600,,692,4.766666666666667

5146835,4,B008BMMXF4,"Does it answer all your questions?  Probably Not!  Does it look like some of the participants might stand to gain from the video.....maybe!  There is substantial and useful information in the video but there is no menu of ""bad foods"" listed or for that matter any menu of good foods to eat except some visuals of salads being prepared. Some ideas might seem ""over the top"" but eating healthy is not hamburgers at Burger King or Twinkies from the grocery store. The idea of staying away from products that have ingredients that you CAN NOT EVEN PRONOUNCE is valid! There is plenty of historical information about the evolution of man's journey with foods and what has worked and what has not. ""Better eating through Science"" is not necessarily the best way to eat for anyone's long term health!

I have always been (for the most part) a skeptic when it comes to new claims of what is best to eat or what drugs are best to have administered.  My personal skepticism stems from a very early age when I found that I am allergic to one food and then in my twenties finding I have a sensitivity or what can be a serious life threading allergy to medically prescribed drugs.  I approach all medicines with caution as everyone should do.

The best policy when approaching eating is to use moderation and common sense and certainly not to believe immediately everything that is written anywhere at anytime about foods or medicines. Do your own research! You might be surprised what you dig up on foods and/or medicines and their safety. Research is ""rigged"" to favor the manufacturers of foods and drugs so approach both with an inquisitive and open mind!  Your very life might depend on it!",1398816000,,1682,4.658783783783784

It also felt like a big promotional video for juicing towards the end, especially since the guy who started the juicing craze on HSN is there. Overall,  it's a movie about common sense things you should do for your body. Lastly, I personally believe that while juicing is great, you lose out on all the fiber and roughage that is a very important part of eating fruits and vegetables. But hey what do I know, I'm just a nutritionist and a chef.

Very short on facts, this film consists of a few (mostly young and hip, some older and hip) people speaking very repetitively about their opinions on food and the food industry.  I have no doubt that they feel very passionately about it.  I have some doubts that they have factual evidence to prove their views or to support their theories about the industrial food complex's various evils.

I happen to think the ideas presented in this documentary are likely to be true.  But, I already ""feel"" that way.  What I was looking for was information.

The preview looks intriguing, and you might (as I did) want to learn more about what they are saying and why.  You won't.  The preview contains as much substance as the film.",1396137600,5,865,4.601307189542483

It has become something else, and that something else has completely taken over our relationship with our bodies for a huge number of people (myself included). It is inspirational, but it does not give a lot of specifics, other than general guidelines about what to eat. For meal plans and recipes, you need to look elsewhere. I loved Dr. Junger's book ""Clean"" and it has an amazing support website: my.cleanprogram.com. I was afraid to join at first, fearing I would be bombarded with offers to purchase their costly kits but it is absolutely not the case. The website of this movie's makers is [...] and has other resources as well, some to buy, some for free.

Anyway, if you are constantly tired, putting on pounds and with an off mood, it is probably time to look at your diet for clues about what is not right (besides, of course, gettinga checkup if you have not done so).

If I can make it myself, I will. This includes Mayo, ketchup, dressings, hot sauces... Most things take less time to make than if i had to drive to the store to buy premade.

I knocked off a star, since they pushed more of a vegetarian diet, and with my experience I was not myself when I went veggie in college. And no talk about chia seeds, that would have been an excellent addition to the program.

Still, it has good facts for people to know about what food chemicals do what to you. However, no citations are provided.

The second part pooh-poohs diets at length and brings up good points on why they don't work. Then they suggest changing the way you eat, which is smart.

In the third part, it falls apart. After pooh-poohing diets, they sell juicing (a diet) the same way every diet is marketed: testimonials, before/after photos, promises of a better life. And they also don't come right out and say it  but strongly hint that you should consume raw milk, and anyone who knows knows the USDA had to be pushed hard to require pasteurization of milk which almost single-handedly cut infant mortality rates by staggering numbers and only morons should eschew pasteurization.

I can't figure out the gimmick, they don't seem to work for food processor companies or own kale farms, so they're not selling juicing to make money, but they are clearly selling it to you.

This is a miracle.

Not only that but hearing the science behind certain behaviors like being kinder to yourself, the science of the ""food"" we buy and using visualization as a weight-loss tool were really profound (for me). Food Inc. was the catalyst for me becoming a vegetarian 4 years ago and since that time I have been struggling to discover what I could do to take that momentum and my health to the next level. I think this is it.

There are a ton of great cameos from well-known Dr.'s, Writers, Nutritionists, Cancer Survivors etc. and well-balanced with those who have actually done the work themselves and have a true story (and personal photos/tips) to share. Although admittedly the girl (actor) in the film who appears periodically is annoying...I think is but a minor distraction.

Do watch it. I have twice and both times I have walked away feeling empowered and truly understand what some great next steps for me health-wise.

So I do read labels now and have cut out the whites; sugar, salt, flour and rice and processed foods. I don't go down the middle aisles of grocery stores at all. The analogy of sugar to cocaine was an eye opener and I learned why MSG was so bad for us.  This was a good film because it gave me information that I didn't know before I viewed it.

But with the kind of over the top statements like the frequent comparisons to sugar and cocaine -- sure refined makes something natural unhealthy but they overstate it to the point that it gives the impression that it is the same level of unhealthy -- and they literally say that if you look at the sugar that is in children's food you might as well ""roll up their sleeve and shoot them up with heroin"".  There are a lot of other videos that make these points better without the crazy talk (Forks over Knives, the juicer video ""Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead"", Food Inc, and even Vegucated).  Moreover the ""Acted"" scenes don't really move this forward and are horribly acted and written.  At once point the lady watches the video you've just watched on her ipad.

Then studies show carbs are bad for you, then one replaces that with diet of synethetic chemicals such as artificial sweeteners.  Why are scientists wasting all their resources on these studies?

EVERYTHING IS BAD FOR YOU IF YOU EAT A TON OF IT.  Yes, even water, if you drink too much water you can DIE, google ""water intoxication"".

Eat in moderation, and there are no shortcuts.

It's like someone that enjoys punching himself in the face.  Instead of just telling him to stop punching himself in the face, scientists spend $billions to create a drug that numbs your face and fist.

JUST EAT IN MODERATION, IF YOU DONT, YOU WILL DIE SOONER.  ITS THAT SIMPLE.",1389916800,,756,4.666666666666667

5146991,2,B008BMMXF4,"I agree with a lot of the messages in this movie (/infomercial?) and it gives some good suggestions. There are also lot of extreme claims about the ""dangers"" of certain foods and ""scientifically better"" approaches to eating. I don't see much of any science here. I did some internet investigation on several claims they made about specific foods, and they seem to have very questionable backing. I can't find any reputable source saying anything bad about Canola oil, and these ""experts"" seem to be at least as biased on the aspartame issue as the FDA.

If you're going to watch this, go ahead and stop about 50 minutes in. It just gets weird and infomercial-y after that.

Overall, good idea, and definitely inspiring, but not something to be quoting in your next scientific debate.",1389744000,,783,4.835820895522388

I like my documentaries to be chalk full of information and references so the viewer can do his/her own research, not merely be talked to by supposed or actual experts.

First I cut way, way, way back on sugar (not completely ought though.) I lost about 10 lbs in about 3 weeks. Then I bought a ""Hamilton Beach"" Big Mouth Pro Juicing Machine. I lost 20 lbs the first week doing the detox method (juicing fresh, almost all organic veggies and a little fruit.) I was not hungry, though I still had some cravings for sweets, steak, etc. It is important to know that I never let myself get hungry. I drank the 16 oz juice 3 times a day for 21 days snacking on cut up fresh veggies when I felt the need. My weight loss stalled a little, then slowly started moving again. It has been 6 weeks now and I currently have lost 40 lbs., went from a 38"" waist to a 34."" My shoes are now laced as tight as they will go and are now slip-ons. I feel & look healthier. I have a better attitude now and my doctor took me off most of my meds. He said over time, I may get off them all.

Honestly, you do have to have drive, enthusiasm, and determination. However, you do NOT have to be hungry and want to make sure you are not hungry. Otherwise you trigger a starvation involuntary bodily response to store fat due to the bodily perception of food shortage. This is only one reason why ordinary DIETS DO NOT WORK!

5147038,4,B008BMMXF4,"Hungry for change: documentary review
  Hungry for change is a captivating documentary that takes an inside look at the perspective of processed food from previously obese subjects. This documentary caught my attention because it deals closely with the topic of health. Health is one of the most overlooked problems in the United States. Obesity is on the rise for generations to come if society does not take precautions to change the outcome of the situation. Hungry for change takes the views of multiple victims of obesity that have changed their lives for the better.
  The documentarys primary focus is to inform the watcher on the health information that most food industries don't explain. The documentary begins with one of the interviewees stating, Sugar is the cocaine of today hidden throughout food products. This statement is further explained throughout the movie as the interviewee goes into depth on the fact that sugar is in almost everything consumed in food products and makes the products that much more addicting. Before this time of over indulgence there was a time of starvation where citizens didn't know if there would be another meal. Society has gone from there not being enough food, to the point where there is now too much food. Weve gone from literal starvation to food supplied with high calories causing nutritional starvation. The lack of nutrients makes consumers believe they are not full because the amount of high calories does not satisfy the body. The restraint on vitamins has led to over eating and an increase in obesity.
  Not only has malnutrition led to obesity but so has certain chemicals induced into food products. The MSG obesity induced mice project is a perfect example. This project entails mice being injected with the MSG chemical making lab rats hungrier leading them becoming larger in sized. This MSG chemical is put into more than 80% of modern day food had to an increase in hunger.  This hunger-manipulated chemical makes it seem as though the first bite of and unhealthy snack or meal is the most fulfilling meal ever eaten. The documentary also goes into depth on how diet drinks such, as diet cokes are deceiving. Most carbohydrate drinks such as diet coke, or coke zeros over time do make one fatter over time. Hungry for change also explains how diets don't work because they are temporary. In most cases the weight doesnt stay off because of the methods used such as cutting every carb out of every day life. Crash diets are mainly used to lose weight which overtime don't last and end up making people gain more weight. The documentary goes into the lives of the interviewees and gets the stories on how each one went from morbidly obese to healthy living life. The interviewees describe how losing weight wasn't about going on a strict diet and cutting everything enjoyable out, but learning how to love yourself and make the decision to live a healthy life. They talk about how its not just about cutting junk out but knowing your limits and not emotional eating.
  Hungry for change also describes how advertisements deceive the public. The documentary explains how advertisements promote unhealthy products in an appealing way. Food industrys perceives their products as healthy when thin models are shown eating the product and make the public think if they eat it they can have a life just as luxurious. Products make the image of what they are trying to sell more appealing with smiling celebrities on cereal boxes or FAT FREE in big letters. The bad ingredients in these products are minimized on the back so consumers cant see what actually is being consumed.
  The documentary chosen perfectly illustrates the topic of my choice. Health is a large issue that comes into play in everyones life. The documentary speaks the truth telling viewers that food products if not monitored can turn against you and increase the risk of obesity. Hungry for change exemplifies the struggles of living in a society where there is food everywhere, not just food but unhealthy foods. As previously stated in another assignment choosing the healthy direction is harder for most people. Active families who are always on the run usually go for the fast route, which leads to fast food. Not only is the healthy route more time consuming but more expensive. The film talks about how organic products are the better outlet but more expensive. Most large families don't have the income to afford those organic products.
  The struggle of society today is that the cheap quick meals are always the unhealthiest. Health is often over looked as not a large issue, but in reality health is one of the biggest issues. The generations to come are set up for disaster. Society makes obesity seem immoral yet society gives citizens the food that makes people obese.  I believe that the documentary brings more understanding to the circumstances of health. The truth was stated and gives actual perspective into the lives of people who have transformed their lives for the better. They have transformed their life for the better because they realized what was the healthier way to live. Health is important throughout the world and precautions should be taken to reduce the amount of obesity for generations to come.",1382572800,,5265,4.9411764705882355

It helped my sis-in-law go vegan and that is one more person getting rid of her chronic illness the plant-based way.  I am very happy how we can use movies to educate people on health.  There is so much more to the story than this movie, I have a hard time myself currently getting my parents to change eating fast food and meats is in our culture and that is all some of us know.  It is a breath of fresh air to know a lot of chronic illness can be cured just by lifestyle changes.  Doctors don't give patients enough credit, they just give them medicines and make them sicker, instead of trusting that a patient may just change their ways.  The pharmaceutical companies love that and so does the dairy industry, were being lied to and any movie that allows us to have the power to take ahold of our health is a great movie to see.",1380585600,,1084,4.162679425837321

5147043,3,B008BMMXF4,"I won't consider myself an expert by any means (nor should some of the people in the film), but many of these claims (like aspratame killing brain cells) are based on studies that have largely been falsified or funded by private companies... that's covered in the first week of nutritonal studies. I giggled a little when they were talking about how so many studies are funded by major brands, when in fact a lot of the information they presented was from those biased studies. Don't get me wrong, a lot of the information was real and it was refreshing to hear the stories of those who had lost the weight. But viewers need to do some research into these so called facts. (Just FYI, moderation is key when it comes to faux sugar... It will not give you cancer unless you drink ridiculous amounts and the only detrimental health effect known right now is in people who have an existing seizure disorder. What about the study they referenced? It was found to have been stretched to fit a predetermined outcome.)

All in all the message was good, but it definitely got gimmicky at the end. While juicing is a viable option for some, it is not for everyone. I wish there would have been more information on other options and more information on why and how diets fail, as opposed to one conclusion.",1377993600,3,1295,4.55793991416309

5147057,1,B008BMMXF4,"Overall message of this film is positive - that we should move away from eating so many processed foods to a more natural lifestyle. However, if you don't almost immediately start questioning some of the things presented as undeniably true in this film, then you are probably an extremely gullible person. Several of its messages are tainted by ""expert"" opinions that are largely based on unsubstantiated, inaccurate studies or based on studies with numerous reported flaws. Pilots not drinking diet coke because it causes blurred vision? Google that study and make your own conclusion. You only need to google Dr Joseph Marconi, one of the only ""doctors"" in the film, to see his dubious past and various false and dangerous claims. This, coupled with the fact that most ""experts"" in the film have a commercial interest in promoting the juicing lifestyle, unfortunately makes this film lose most of its credibility.

Overall it would have been great to have a non-biased film with real nutrition and health experts discussing how different foods affect the body and the various ways to make more healthy living decisions. Instead we get a infomercial-esque documentary marketing a juicing lifestyle as the almost sole path to healthy living.",1373932800,24,1241,5.143564356435643

5147059,3,B008BMMXF4,"The first half of the film gets it right, carbs will make you fat and kill you. Of course they will, we have known this for 100+ years, but the message is an important one, as carb consumption has been rising precipitously in many western countries. The argument that returning to our natural diets of real, whole foods, is scientifically defensible as well. However, there was no such thing as a vegan in prehistoric humans. Never in history was our natural diet purely plant-based. All humans, until very recent history, have been omnivores, and in fact, there is evidence from studying the bones of ancient humans and Neanderthals that the balance was more in the favor of animal protein than plants. (Recall from the film that Daniel Vitalis points out that humans in the Arctic lived healthy, disease-free lives, eating almost no plants or fruits whatsoever). So when the filmmakers ask us to return to our original diets, yet leave out one of staples of the natural human diet, we should pause to scratch our heads at their logic.",1373155200,3,1036,4.793296089385475

5147093,4,B008BMMXF4,"Over the last 20 years or so I have witnessed a great change in society and how we are becoming sicker, fatter, and just plain miserable.  What's changed in the last 50 years?  This film was a sobering account of how the public is mass manipulated into believing what is healthy for us and what is in truth making us spend more $$$ to eat more(non nutritional foods) and become sicker so we spend more $$$ in search of a cure.  Let's put it this way, corporate greed is killing us, and this film explores the food side of it.  While the film became tedious in areas the message (albeit one that has been talked about over and over) is essential for anyone who really wants to be ""healthy"".

This film explores the side of the food industry that is doing to us what the tobacco industry did to us in the 50's and 60's, making eating glamorous while lacing nutritionally empty franken-foods with chemicals that keep you hungry and addicted to them while your body is actually starving for nutrition and getting fat and sick in the process.  It also gave me a shock when they stated that infant cord blood testing revealed our babies are born with over 200 man made chemicals in them.  And you wonder why the autism numbers and food allergies are high now...Jamie Oliver has a bigger issue than our kids school lunches keeping them healthy, he should go after pregnant mothers lunches before they become pregnant!

So, once the food companies make more and more money off of us while we get sicker and sicker, guess who's next in line to collect the rest of your money?  The mighty pharmaceutical companies!  We have become nothing but a planet of worker bees supporting a mass complex of corporate bottom lines.  Time to educate ourselves and our kids and stop the mad merry go round I would think.

Realize Monsanto is the devil and Cargill and Bayer are the minions.

Here's the scoop on this documentary; try to buy fresh local foods, forget the convenience and pre prepared foods, and try to cook like mom did using basic whole foods.  If it's already in a jar or bag ready to eat question what's actually in the package.  Additives in that package can trick you brain into hunger and processed foods are like processed drugs...dangerous.  My favorite example is the coca leaf...make a tea out of the leaf it's a very safe non addictive tea...process it like you would corn into high fructose corn syrup, it becomes cocaine.  Get it?  Now put down that soda and candy bar and get a glass of water, organic apple sliced by you,  and some almonds...it's what your body really wants!",1366588800,3,2582,4.561822125813449

5147108,3,B008BMMXF4,"I'm conflicted about this a bit.  The first half of this documentary seemed fairly solid, but the latter half went off the rails a bit for me.  This documentary somehow featured a subplot about some woman who felt chubby (but didn't appear so, to me) and insecure, until she started juicing vegetables.  The weirdest point was easily when this woman fired up her iPad to watch the documentary I was already watching.  I giggled a little bit, thinking she was going to be pretty pissed when she got to the part where they'd been filming her without her knowledge.

I thought it was interesting that the documentary mentioned the addictive properties of modern, processed food.  More focus on that probably could have made this an awesome documentary, but much of this was glossed over.  Only later in the film do we find out that the people we've been hearing from aren't experts per se, but have a definite stake in getting people to buy their particular books or buy their particular juicer.  OF COURSE the juicer guy thinks everyone should start pulping local flora and drinking it.  OF COURSE the self-help author thinks people should self-help themselves to one or two of her books.

I did laugh when the ""scary list of bad chemicals"" ran past the screen as they were going on about natural, natural, natural.  I recognized two of the scary chemicals as extract from orange peels (limonene and linalool).

I guess I was looking for something a bit more hard-nosed about exactly what bad food does that is so bad, and why.  This isn't that documentary.  But it has some worthwhile parts, at first.  Watch the first half, and then go about your day.",1364083200,184,1651,4.70383275261324

Sugar is very bad for you as well as artificial sweeteners, you need to eat vegetables and natural, whole foods. The worst part was the little side show with the girl waking up feeling bad and showing how bad she eats thru the day and has such low self esteem, they keep interrupting the main part with these little clips of how bad her life is until she starts eating healthy and then everything turns around for her in the end.

In only an hour and a half, this film covers an amazing number of essential, nutritional issues for those seeking to achieve a healthier life through a healthier diet. I was stunned at how much information the filmmakers packed into such a relatively short space of time. I wish that every secondary student in the country could view this film as part of a required health class. In addition, viewings of this film should be regularly scheduled at health clubs and at any venue where weight loss is of concern.

This documentary is of interest to everyone, not just newbies to health and nutrition. It's a good reminder and re-inspiration for even the most diehard ""health nuts."" One of the key achievements of the film is to remove the shame from obesity in several crucial ways. It explains how the human body evolved to store fat because of thousands of years of food scarcity on the planet. And in contrast, it explains that in a food-glutted society such as ours, there is never any famine to balance out all the excess food. Perhaps most importantly of all, the film reveals how the processed food industry purposely infuses its products with sugar, a highly addicting substance, to guarantee that customers will get hooked on their products, no matter how much harm it does to the health of those customers.

For those who are inspired by this film to seek additional information on health and nutrition, many of the key persons appearing in this documentary have either written books or created health documentaries of their own, including the following:

The bit about not cutting out bad foods, but replacing them with good foods changed my life! Someone close to me is a sugar addict. It was fascinating to hear about the chemical reactions of the brain and nervous system to processed foods, because I see it every day.

  So why three stars? Although I can see how juicing is probably a good way to ""reset"" your body if you're addicted to processed foods, I didn't really want to be sold a juicer. I think juicing, while definitely a godsend to people who don't like vegetables, is kind of silly for someone like me, who likes them.  Why would you take all of the fiber out of the vegetables?  That's half the reason you eat them.
Also, I'm not sure where most of these people live, but they don't seem to share the same reality as a lot of people in this country.

I certainly will! King salmon every day, as I dawdle around the farmer's market buying 4 dollar tomatoes. Yep, I've got time and money enough for that.  Or did, in 2008.

5147155,3,B008BMMXF4,"I have mixed feelings about this film. The beginning seemed promising since the film seemed like it was mostly talking about making healthy food choices, and how this food affects us. I was interested in watching another film concerning the importance of eating whole foods vs. processed, manufactured foods. Towards the middle and end of the film though, the film started to degenerate into some spiel about the importance of juicing, detoxing, self-love, not letting stress get to us, getting enough sleep and how when we are healthier inside, our skin and hair start to glow. Huh?! It was as if the film lost focus and decided to go into a few dozen little directions, really odd.

This film seems like a blend of some facts mixed with motivational speakers doling out their upbeat beliefs, with a touch of hocus pocus. None of the films recommendations were really harmful: eat vegetables, more plant-based foods, less fried foods, less sugar, move more, but I really did not find the film to be cohesive in it's message.

If you can watch this movie for free somewhere, it might make you feel good for abit (since it's message is saying you can make changes and feel better). But I really don't think this one is good enough to buy. Ultimately, if you don't watch it, you're not missing anything.",1357344000,16,1301,4.752212389380531

I just wished that it would ""show"" the affects on the body instead of people just talking about how much each person consums each day and year.  Yeah, we know it turns to fat because the body can't handle that much sugar.  But I want my kids to ""see"" the affects.  But it's still very educational.",1357084800,,424,4.172839506172839

5147161,2,B008BMMXF4,"We get it...eating bad foods is bad and eating good foods is good. I don't know how long a ""documentary"" has to be to really convey that message. As somebody that's seen a lot of documentaries on food, I'd have to admit this one isn't adding anything. I guess if you've seen no other documentary about how food affects your body and you've never taken a high school health class and you've never read a book and you've never been on the internet and you've been living under a rock all your life, you might learn something in the first 20 minutes or so of this.

I also felt this ""documentary"" talked down to its audience claiming that we buy into the outlandish implications fed to us by advertisers and by repeating the same points. The average person knows what's good for them and what's bad for them. You already knew before you watched this, as did I. If you want to eat healthier, just do it, even if it's difficult at first.

5147167,3,B008BMMXF4,"After watching it I'm not entirely sure what ""Hungry for Change"" is about.  It's not entirely about the toxic malpractices of the food industry, and it's not entirely about the origins and consequences of unhealthy eating.  ""Hungry for Change"" just seems to parade a bunch of New York Times-bestselling authors on camera spieling out their nutrition/healthy living mantras and jargon:  ""Just love yourself!""

What's also distracting about the documentary is how it has embedded a dramatic storyline to weave together the self-promoting authors:  a middle-aged woman who is infatuated with one of her co-workers but never musters the courage to tell him so because she hates her body.

I highly recommend ""Food Inc"" as a documentary that highlights well what's wrong with the food industry.",1356480000,18,789,5.272

In a few cases, I think they played the same commentary over, verbatim.

There are a lot of big names in the film, and I agree with the overall message that most of us should be eating far more vegetables. However, this film didn't really add anything new to the overall dialogue, and it seemed like they were really pushing the whole ""juicing"" lifestyle. I'm all for more vegetables, and juicing is one good way to get more, but it really takes the joy out of eating.

A lot of the clips were repetitive, there were only minor allusions to some of the speakers' personal stories - which sounded like they would have been some of the most compelling parts.

This documentary reveals that MSG is in 80 percent of processed foods and that it alone is capable of making us fat. I won't mention the two foods that I typically crave but both have MSG in them and I know it. Avoiding them is a psychological challenge because they are so addictive.

This program explains how our health is under attack both psychologically and physically. Finally someone admitted that you can look at a donut and actually change your metabolism. So do you wear blinders when you go to the grocery store?

I felt this film cleverly documents one woman's transformation from miserable to happy therefore subconsciously making you want to become like her. While you can be happy at any weight, you can't always be healthy.

I felt this was a good documentary to explain the culprits in weight gain but I felt it could have gone further in describing exactly which foods should be eaten instead. It gives you a lot to think about and is a good place to start. Look up the DASH diet however if you want to learn about a scientifically proven diet. The diet has very little sugar, lots of vegetables and fruits and moderate amounts of carbohydrates.

Love yourself enough to watch this but also do more research.
