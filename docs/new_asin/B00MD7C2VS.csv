8671691,5,B00MD7C2VS,I saw this on cable around 30 years ago. It's an amazing documentary narrated by William Conrad on the USS Enterprise 1965 journey to Vietnam. It centers around squadron VA-94. I did a search on the two pilots who were listed as missing and found out that they were captured and spent 1966-1973 as POW's. I would really like to see this documentary shown again with commentary by the men who were in it and as they are today. I think it would be a great honor to the men who served and to those who did not return. I don't know why the film is so hard to find. There is some important historical documentation in the film. I am very happy to have finally found a copy.,1412035200,,668,4.186046511627907
