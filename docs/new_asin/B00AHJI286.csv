8551642,5,B00AHJI286,"Christmas Wafer is a lovely slice of life film.  Director Rasa Aliukonyte has a keen understanding of unknown terrors as conjured up in the minds of children.  Her story is engaging and well told, using every element of cinematic technique to its fullest with subtle and nuanced feelings.  I really felt for the protagonist and could see the world through her frightened eyes.  This reminded me a great deal of Francois Truffaut's eloquent explorations of childhood.  It's that good.  Haunting and beautiful.",1357603200,,508,5.134146341463414
8551643,5,B00AHJI286,"This film warms my heart, whether I watch it at Christmas time or not.

""Christmas Wafer"" tells the story of a little girl who must confront the scary priest at her nearby small town church in order to get a christmas wafer.  This film does a wonderful job of putting the film in the child's perspective while still showing the overall world and story in a very adult manner.  I believe that this film will be equally affecting to kids and parents because of that.

Besides this, the cinematography, storytelling, and overall film-making are very well done and this will be a great film for the family to watch for years to come!

Highly Recommended.",1355356800,,650,4.6173913043478265
8551644,5,B00AHJI286,"It touches your soul how this movie is nicely shown through the big blue eyes of the child.  A simple story line shows a sneak peak to a child's day living in a rural village on Christmas Eve.  Young, playful and smart girl exemplifies how a little kindness can go a long way.",1355270400,2,276,4.188679245283019
