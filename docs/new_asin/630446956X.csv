888077,5,630446956X,"This is a very plush production of Fledermaus from 1990 at Covent Garden that also was Dame Joan Sutherland's farewell to a house in which she had been singing for nearly 40 years.  The production of Fledermaus is very well done, with very lavish settings from the Vienna of Johann Strauss, including the centerpiece ball of Act II.  The cast is excellent throughout and the singing is in English ((with subtitles available). Dame Joan's husband Richard Bonygne leads the orchestra and the chorus under John Brown is excellent.
Although this is in itself a superb Feldermaus, many will want to see this production for its farewell to Miss Sutherland.  She and her long-term colleagues Marilyn Horne and Luciano Pavarotti treat us to several solos and duets in the Act II gala sequence, always a great vehicle for bringing out star talent for their turn.  The gala is a lot of fun and quite moving too when Dame Joan sings ""Home Sweet Home.""  The gala lasts about 40 minute and also includes two ballets to Strauss tunes.  We see Dame Joan at the curtain calls at the end of the opera too when she speaks her farewell to the ecstatic house.
This is a great DVD to have if you either love Fledermaus or Dame Joan Sutherland.  A definite buy!",978134400,121,1239,4.63013698630137
888078,5,630446956X,"The retirement party to end all retirement parties. The applause and bravas just wouldn't stop for La Stupenda, the reigning  diva of her time.  I find myself teary eyed as I write this review. All the superlatives I can  think of have been lavished on Dame Joan, but she remain not only Prima  Donna Assoluta (only one in the world at a time), a very nice person, very  humble. She sings with Pavorotti, the Traviata duet in the first act. And  she sounded surprisingly lovely for well over 60, and looks fabulous  too.
You can tell by the video just how much Pavorotti adores her. For  him and Horne to come to this gathering and not be paid for, alone, is  remarkable. We all know how much Pavorotti an Horne charges LOL. But they  wanted to pay tribute to their Joan, and I can see why. Many great artist  get rave reviews from critics, but Dame Joan Sutherland gets rave reviews  from other great singers. This is what Pavorotti said about Joan in the  video ""La Stupenda""..""Joan Sutherland is certainly the  greatest singer of this century, she is a great artist, Australian, and  artistic."" The great director Franco Zefferelli said of Joan...""  ""She was the phenomenal singer of our time...she was stunning,  sensational"". Te Kanewa said of Joan..""No one did it as well as  Joan...glorious voice"". And Marilyn Horne said that Joan's 1961 Lucia  was "" great, great singing"", something you tell your grand  children about..""that ""of all of her colleagues, no one has meant  as much to her as Joan"". Know why she is so beloved by other singers  who could have been her rivals, but they're not. We're talking about  Pavorotti, Horne, Te Kanewa, and Zefferelli, all of them legends.
Other  legendary singers are also said to think the world of our diva. Tebaldi  wrote in her book about the amazing coloratura ability of Joan. Plus  Tebaldi is also a good friend of her's. Domingo was quoted as being in awe  of the diva's dazzling coloratura, and his singing Edgardo to her Lucia  early in his career was one of the best learning experience of his life.  Caballe is another great admirer, such so that she sang Adagisa to her  Norma, a humbling feat that I still couldn't believe. then there's Anna  Moffo, great Lucia herself who after hearing the diva in a Met rehearsel,  lavish her with phrases, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, ask her director husband to  hire Sutherland for the legendary Don Giovanni with Giulini...also  Schwarzkopf, a friend of Maria Callas, was quoted as saying that in the  rehearsal for Sutherland's 1959 Lucia for Covent garden, that Callas jaws  dropped in disbelieve when she heard Sutherland, then there's Birgit  Nilsson, George London who got her her met audition which she amazingly  failed in 1958, singing Caro Nome in english, Simionato, Alfredo Kraus,  Robert Merrill, who raves about her by the way. I can go on and on, but you  get the point. The greatest singers in the world all bow to her because of  her fantastic voice. And the great Bruno Walters came out of retirement to  conduct Don Giovanni with Sutherland as Donna Anna because he thought she  was the best Donna Anna he's ever heard.
Of course she had critics too.  Callas said Sutherland turned her standards for bel canto that she had so  painfully set at least a hundred years, and Callas is a formitable force  indeed. Others find La Stupenda's voice beyond criticism and choose to  attack her diction and theatrical attributes instead. All jealousy, in my  opionion.
But the years took a lot of toll on the Sutherland voice. By  the time of this recording only half a voice is left. But still not bad.  But from the late fifties to the late seventies she had a gorgeous voice  that was incomparable, with high notes that got bigger and bigger as the  notes get higher and higher..the high notes actually blossoms. And she had  that precise trill, that staccato, perhaps the fastest one I know, the  fioratura that resemble pearls in a pearl necklace, so precise and defined  it was. Even Callas was second to her in the coloratura area. And La  Stupenda's ability to sing beautifully night after night turning in bravura  performances without a single flaw is unique.
Sorry that I go on and on.  But to have heard her in person, it was my priviledge. She remains a diva  who knows who she is, and her place in the history of opera, she knows she  is a glorious singer, but she doesn't show it. Her farewell operatic role  was the Queen in La Huguenots. NOT because it's a showpiece for her, all  her great scenes are in act 1, then she disappears for almost 2 hours,  but  because it'll show off the talents of other singers from her Australian  Opera house. That's how humble she is.
Again, a stupendous farewell for  Dame Joan Sutherland...she already has a unique place in the history of  opera as the Queen of Bel Canto, and within our lifetime we will likely not  hear anything like her again. Bravissima, diva.",966211200,67,4920,4.6760233918128655
888079,5,630446956X,"This video of the 1990 Covert Garden New Year's Eve Gala is so important, not for it's cast (With names we never heard of), but, for its guests. Pavarotti is there, so does Marilyn Horne. But, the real star of this gala  is of the final performance ever of Dame Joan Sutherland. Of course, as  always, her hubsand and mentor, Richard Bonyage, is at the podium.
A  great document of a great gala!
For its historic moment, I give it 5  stars. But, for its cast, I still perferred the 1984 Covert Garden Gala  (With Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and Placido Domingo at the podium) the best!",952214400,103,577,4.355140186915888

888209,5,630446956X,"This is a very special night at the opera.  Die Fledermaus has always been a favorite with English audiences and in this Royal Opera House production, performed in the presence of the then Prime Minister, John Major, they make it their own.  Having John Mortimer write an English libretto and casting the comedian John Sessions as the jailer were inspirational decisions.  The result is quirky, eccentric, and endlessly enjoyable.

The superb singing of Nancy Gustafson and Judith Howarth are enough to make this production worthwhile, but there is much, much more in addition.

I suppose some of the more topical, local and downright obscure jokes may be lost on some audiences.  I must admit it took me a while to get the joke about the Italian prisoner sending out for an avocado.  I roared with laughter when I finally did get it.  The production is full of nice little touches like that.

This was Joan Sutherland's farewell to Covent Garden and she, along with Marilyn Horne and Luciano Pavarotti, makes a guest appearance.  They sing several arias to provide a magnificent and very moving centerpiece to the opera.

The dancing, during the ball in Act 2, is superb.  This DVD really is worth watching just for the dancers.  Whether ballet or opera fan, this is for you.",1148774400,,1276,4.824884792626728
888210,5,630446956X,"Well, what can I say about this DVD performance. I have to say that this is one beautiful performance of Die Fledermaus by Strauss. What opera is good without the voices of Great tenors and sopranos of the world. In Act 2, Sutherland and Luciano Pavoritti make an appreance and sing some opera arias and duets. I wish Pavoritti and Sutherland would have sung the whole opera by strauss but I'm still very satisfied the way this production of Die Fledermaus turned out. I strongly recommend this DVD to everyone who loves opera and operetta. I hope one day to see Placido Domingo or Luciano Pavoritti sing this opera because indeed this is a jewel. I hope you enjoy this DVD as much as I did.",1130889600,,691,4.492063492063492
888211,4,630446956X,"This is the first full Fledermaus production I've seen.  I got it because I'm doing a scene from Fledermaus in an opera workshop (Colonel Frank), and I thought it might be helpful.  Unfortunately, the translation we're using (and some of the music) is totally different.  I thought the Fledermaus was good, although I don't have much basis for comparison.  Others have mentioned that the opera is almost simply a picture frame for 'Prince Orlovsky's guests', especially the farewell to Joan Sutherland.  I don't know what I would have thought of her at her prime, but this performance didn't do much for me.  When she was doing her duet with Pavarotti, I wondered why she looked at him so little.  He seemed somewhat frustrated - he was singing to her, and she was singing to the audience.  But, I really enjoyed Pavarotti's solo; he sounded wonderful, and his acting ability is superb.  It's an interesting question as to whether he actually felt all the emotions that seem so evident in his singing.  But, let's be realistic, part of singing is acting.  What interests me, however, is that nobody mentioned the ballet in the 'guests'.  The little ballet troupe (8 girls, 3 guys) was good, very enjoyable, but I was really enthralled with the couple, wearing vaguely Grecian outfits, that did a complicated routine to a big Strauss waltz.  Their dancing was excellent, and they looked fantastic.  The girl was stunning, and she looked like she was fully aware of it.  The running time of the DVD is 3 hours and 16 minutes.  If I had been at the performance, I think I might have gotten a little bit antsy, and wondering whether they couldn't have trimmed things back a bit here and there.  Good thing there were three acts.",1128297600,,1724,4.731543624161074
888212,4,630446956X,"It's sung in English so that appeals to the non-german speakers as much of the humour will be grasped. If you know the operetta well enough, you also get the gist when Rosalinde sings the Czardas in Hungarian! The counter-tenor Orlofsky was also hilarious. Well-sung, too! Bonaventura Bottone was in superb voice and there were lots of cracks at italian tenors...this DVD also provides a good highlight selection of various operas including a fondness for La Traviata...hysterical! A must for opera lovers. The one thing that niggled me was listening to Dame Joan (who was a fantastic singer in days gone by) who was but a shadow of her former self. And the contrast between Horne (who sang ravishly - her 'mon coeur s'ouvre ta voix' was divine with Bonynge bringing out glorious sounds from the orchestra - and Pavarotti - who was, well, Pavarotti...resplendent with his signature white hanky - with Dame Joan was quite drastic. Yes, I know, it's her farewell performance. And it was a fitting tribute to a remarkable singer, but I found most of it to be based on sentimentality and not on how she actually performed that night. But, if you have to go, there's no better way then a huge send-off by your adoring fans. Maybe she should have retired earlier so her voice would have been in better condition to remind her hoards of fans as to how great a singer she still is. Instead, we are left with a shadow. Other than that...it is a good Fledermaus with everyone looking their parts and singing with much gusto and frivolity...effervescant as champagne!",1076112000,6,1556,4.766666666666667

888215,5,630446956X,"This really is a joy to all who watch this. I had a New Year party last year and had it on my TV. Everyone loved it. And most of the people there aren't even Opera fans. It's just a fun Flederous, and superlatively sung and acted.
The bonus is the retirement of the one and only La Stupenda. Who, at 63 still raises the temperature of the House when she entered it. Along with Pavarotti and Horne (both of whom adore her), they sing up a storm. No, Sutherland had sung better. But this is her retirement. She was all choked up. Pavarotti and Horne sung stupendously in their tribune to one of the most celebrated and beloved of all opera singers.
Bravisima, La Stupenda, we adore you. And agree with the countless opera fans who consider you,
Prima Donna Assoluta, for all time.",1059091200,7,778,4.372413793103449
888216,2,630446956X,"For a musical play like Die Fledermaus actors who sing are very much to be prefered to singers who try to act! Besides, filmed theater has very serious limitations.
My ideal Fledermaus is the magnificent movie made in Color in Vienna just before the end of WWII. The soundtrack was lost but after the end of the war the cast was reassembled and the soundtrack was recorded anew. I saw the movie several times in Zrich in about 1948. I would dearly love to see it again. None of the performances I have seen since can compare.
The treatment of an opera as a movie was in 1951 used by William Powell and Emeric Pressburger in their great Tales of Hoffmann. Perhaps they had seen Fledermaus?",1046908800,2,688,4.468253968253968
7872755,5,630446956X,"Joan Sutherland's last performance captured in the ""Die Fledermaus"" Act II party scene makes this a not to be missed, historic document for those who are fans of the diva known as La Stupenda.  Marilyn Horne and Luciano Pavarotti are icing on the cake.  Following the final curtain, Sutherland speaks to the Covent Garden audience, saying farewell to the Royal Opera Company where her career took off.  There is bonus footage of Sutherland in Australian performances as well.  All of this makes the Blu-Ray a treasure.  On top of that, it is a splendid production of ""Fledermaus"", well sung, well acted, in beautiful costumes on beautiful sets.

The fly in the ointment:  it's a known fact that most operas sung in English are barely intelligible even to English speaking listeners, and with my hearing on the decline, it was impossible to understand the dialog.  That would be a moot point if there were English subtitles, but someone seems to have decided English subtitles were unnecessary since the performance is in English.

7872758,2,630446956X,"OK, Joan Sutherland is larger (quite literally) than life. Great. But translation of the ENTIRE opera into ENGLISH!? Why destroy the poetry and witicism of timeless German arias by translating them for a production? (Ever heard of supertitles?) And WHY throw out the time-honored tradtition of the pants-role by having the prince played by a man?? Not only is it an insult to this beautiful mezzo-sporano role, it ruins one of the BEST jokes in the opera!  Buy the 1984 production with Kiri Te Kanawa - an all-star cast. All the singing is in the original German but cast members speak their lines in the native language, adding to the humor with language jokes (in Italian, German, English, French, and Russian) while beautifully conveying the setting of Vienna.

Sutherland, accompanied by long-time colleagues Horne and Pavarotti, perform as the ""special guests"" in Act Two. It's an unprecedented historic moment and, for anyone who recognizes the place that Sutherland holds in the firmament of legendary operatic divas, a must have. It's intensely moving on many levels and, although retiring, Dame Joan never looked more resplendent. The Fledermaus performance is adequate, but that's not why you will want to own this. Note especially the upward glance Dame Joan makes while Horne pours out her rapturous Delilah aria: I personally spoke to Marilyn Horne about his some years afterward and said that I believed her performance of that aria that night evinced the loving memory of Dame Joan's mother, who performed this aria with Bonynge at the piano not long before her death. Ms.  Horne nodded and became misty eyed at the thought. This performance also has more sheer star power than any performance or combinations of performance that have followed this remarkable night.
