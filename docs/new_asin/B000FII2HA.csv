8123051,2,B000FII2HA,"Show content - 3 stars.  Value - 1 star.  This is a 30 minute black and white documentary made in 1964 which is largely an interview with Steichen and a look at his home and property in Connecticut, along with a few minutes about his wife.  Steichen is interesting and has some good insights about his life, his career, his photography and his process.  But it's not a documentary about his career and work.  A list price of $19.99 is, quite simply, insane for so little content.  Kultur Video should put several of these 30 minute shows on a single DVD and then it might be worth a purchase, but I suggest you rent it from NetFlix or see if you can find it at your local library.  Your money is better spent buying one of the Steichen books instead.",1238716800,4,750,4.314285714285714
8123052,3,B000FII2HA,"This is 30-minute DVD is an intimate personal interview with Edward Steichen at age 85.  It is about the man, not about his career in photography nor about his work in photography's many genres.  As such, it will disappoint someone looking for a review of the works.  It's about the man, not the works, and gives some good insight into his creative mind.",1200614400,6,354,4.587301587301587
8123053,3,B000FII2HA,"The DVD has some great ""home movie"" shots of the master describing some of the highlights. But I was dissappointed by the lack of real insight. I expected more and higher quality production. It does have historic quality but I have seen the same footage  mkore effectively produced and incorporated into better media.",1182902400,6,317,4.981132075471698
