4972279,5,B0067SCZ4S,"Jessica is a classy young lady who understands the journey of getting fit.  She's right there working with you.  She encourages you to set the bar higher for yourself.  She's accurate in her counts & lets you work at your pace. The best part is she is precise & doesn't waste your time talking the entire workout. She's sweating too! Her workouts are effective! There's usually a twist to keep it challenging. You will feel your efforts in the next days. There's a variety of balance moves in each section. Each 20 min. session is a workout for the whole body. Yet the session is emphasized on certain areas. So even if your time is short, your workout will be efficient.  Each workout DVD she puts out continues to progress helping others to do the same! She truly cares helping others to be successful & it shows in her workouts! She keeps tab on the 10 pounds down Facebook account always listening & sharing ideas to help.  This DVD is worth every cent!",1330473600,25,957,4.508670520231214
4972280,5,B0067SCZ4S,"I have been doing Jessica's other videos for almost a year now and the new Better Body Blast is an excellent addition.
If you do the 20 minute segments individually or all as one you will be getting a killer work out.
The arms segment has some new (non-boring) moves, especially for the triceps, there is also some cardio mixed in to get your heart rate up.
The legs segment, well... is very leg heavy! :)  The lunge combination and progressions are excellent.  The cardio bumps you to the next level as well.
Finally the abs... she hits every side and then some.  I definitely feel my abs have been worked the next day!

Each segment is perfect if you don't have a lot of time because you are getting concentrated moves for a specific body area, but heart pumping cardio and some total body toning.  My only suggestion would be to do a little more stretching before and afterwards.  I tend to be tight, so doing so helps me.

As always, Jessica is wonderful... extremely supportive, positive, guides you thru the moves and give you tips and modifiers thru out.

She sweats with you and I think that just helps me pull thru it when it's burning!!!

Thanks Jessica for another great video!!!!",1323734400,61,1191,4.52803738317757
4972281,5,B0067SCZ4S,"I have been a Jessica Smith fan for a few years, I have five of her DVDs that I work out to regularly. If you are a fan of hers or just a first timer looking to check out a fantastic video instructor, I highly recommend this newest workout video! I like how the Body Blast is broken up into three 20-minutes sections.  If fools you into thinking you're doing a shorter workout than you are, because before you know it, 60 minutes have gone by and you feel great! I admit, the first exercise for the arms was like a comedy routine if anyone could see me...I could NOT get the arm and opposite leg to talk to each other...but of course, Jessica knew we would maybe be struggling and said don't worry about it, you'll get it. And she was right, after a couple of workouts I did get it and it is a great move! She's really good at knowing the flow and her subjects, even though it's only through the TV. Impressive. That's why she is good with beginners or seasoned exercise vets, she's easy to follow and you can work at your own pace within the moves that she shows you. GET THIS WORKOUT and you'll see results fast and, most importantly, you'll feel GREAT!",1321747200,29,1155,4.25

4972287,3,B0067SCZ4S,"Was a bit disappointed in this video.  The routines have no warm up.  The compound moves are demonstrated quickly (which I guess is good, for future watches) and then you're off with only a limited number of reps, and then on to the next one.  That's how everything fits into the 10 minute workout format.  In the cardio portions that were way too many pylo moves, not so good if you're older or have any knee issues.  The workout calendar advertised was NOT included.  Instead was a workout calendar for a different DVD - Butt Lift.  Tried to find the correct calendar on line, but had different segments than this video.  This video was not that expensive, so would say it's ""just OK"" for the money.  P.S.  Packaging/vendor/delivery was excellent.",1465516800,2,749,4.6923076923076925

I love her energy and her spot-on direction. She is one of the few instructors who talks a lot during the workouts without being annoying at all. She is so encouraging and because of this, I have bought many of her DVDs. Its always fun working out with Jessica!",1436572800,3,435,4.382716049382716

4972299,4,B0067SCZ4S,"I like Jessica Smith. She's got a nice instructive ability. However, again, I find her and most other workouts to be a bit too fast-paced. I'm not saying I want them to give 5 min breaks between each move but giving me longer than a blink might be nice too.",1428537600,2,257,4.16
4972300,1,B0067SCZ4S,this is a good workout dvd if you're hoping to injure yourself. this is one of those workouts that you do it once and you'll never do it again. this workout isn't worth wasting your time on. i don't know where jessica comes up with these weird moves but she is likely to get someone hurt.,1428364800,3,288,4.160714285714286
4972301,5,B0067SCZ4S,Great workout! A little challenging for beginners but could still get through it. I did not think the arm workout would get the heart rate up much but it was better than I expected!,1427673600,4,181,4.352941176470588

4972303,5,B0067SCZ4S,Too cool. No talking. All strength training. She gets right to it . It goes by quickly and is not the least bit boring. In my opinion Smith is much better than Jillian Michaels who gabs too much.,1422057600,3,195,4.157894736842105

4972305,4,B0067SCZ4S,I like it- it's a good mix of cardio and toning. The 20 minute segments are great for busy people who want to sneak a quick workout in. However- it's not as intense fo a workout as I'm looking to get in 20 minutes.  But i like it- it's something different,1407715200,,255,4.0
4972306,5,B0067SCZ4S,"Fantastic workout. Each of the three 20 minute workout focus on one body area, however, everything is multitasking and functional. As a result, you will work all your body in every workout, regardless the focus. Besides de multitasking moves, Jessica incorporates cardio intervals, so this is not only a toning workout, it is cardio too.

I don't think this is too harsh on the knees. Yes, there are some lunges and squats, but Jessica gives you options if you need to keep it low impact. Or just, don't go too deep in the lunges/squats and make sure your knee is aligned with your ankle.

I started with 3kg weights but had to switch to 2kg due to the high reps/long lever movements.",1406764800,5,684,4.598360655737705
4972307,5,B0067SCZ4S,"I really love this dvd.  I tried it for the first time last night and I was drenched in sweat by the end.  Her moves are really creative (in a good way) and she's just downright lovely.

With the arms segment I thought at first that it was a joke that she'd use 5 pound dumbbells, of course I was wrong, I felt it in the first move!  There's not one move that made me feel threatened by injury or that I could do without due to lack of intensity, I felt all of it.

The legs segment is where I think I could possibly work my way up with the weights.  Yes there are a few squats and plenty of lunges but she's quite innovative in her execution, so it's not just ""another lunge and yet another squat."" She kept me pumped throughout the entire session.

The abs... I struggled :(.  I'm 31, have two kids and haven't been consistent with building abdominal strength until recently but I honestly feel like this segment will be the segment to get me strong as this is definitely my weakest area.  I love her moves although I couldn't complete each rep yet but I'm happy that I have something to work towards.

I know this is a complaint of others but I like that she's very brief with her warm ups and cool downs, I can do that on my own as the wu/cd are always pretty standard, so when I buy a workout dvd I'd rather they just hurry up and get to it and get my money's worth.  If the item advertises a 60 minute workout, I want to believe that I'll be doing cardio/strength training for close to 60 minutes.  A few of my other dvds have a 10 minute warm up and cool down.. shoot me..  So I really appreciate her pace there.

I'm now 100% invested in this trainer and after one workout with her I'm ready to call her my favorite and I've trained with many.  I would rate this dvd intermediate however, in comparison to say, Cathe Friedrich.  But the moves are exciting (can you call a workout dvd that?), zero dread factor and she's generally just a wonderful motivator.  I love it.",1406160000,27,1977,4.1878306878306875
4972308,4,B0067SCZ4S,"This video delivers what I was looking for - a challenging workout that hits all body areas using weights for arms and otherwise needing no other equipment.  I am 59 but a long time fitness lover who exercises regularly with hard spin classes 2x/week, Pilates class one day and dvd's 2 more days so was looking for a good dvd to add to my collection that would leave me feeling that I really did a good workout.  This is an active video that got me sweating and breathing hard.  The first time around I had to modify a bit because I couldn't keep up with Jessica.  I gave it 4 stars because it did not include a stretch series at the end which I end up doing on my own.  I recommend this video if you are an intermediate to advanced exerciser looking for a low impact but challenging workout that definitely is not fluff!",1403913600,4,821,4.2709677419354835
4972309,3,B0067SCZ4S,"Wow, Jessica is one very fit lady! This is the first DVD by Jessica that I have tried, and it is way beyond my level.  I have quite a bit of arthritis pain in my knee, so I wasn't comfortable health-wise with much of the leg workout.  If you're young and fit, or if you're not so young with no knee problems, this would be a good DVD for you.",1397347200,2,342,3.8714285714285714

4972311,3,B0067SCZ4S,"Its 20 minutes each arms first, then legs, then abs. You are on the floor alot with this one.  From somewhere in the legs segment all the way through the abs.

The music is great.",1396310400,4,355,4.042857142857143
4972312,5,B0067SCZ4S,"I really like this video; did the arms segment last night and my shoulders are sore today.  Other reviewers claim the moves are repetitious, but she does a large number of reps of each move with additional challenges added in.  There is also the added bonus of cardio bursts.  I like workouts that combine cardio and strength and allow me to choose the amount of time I spend working out (in this particular video 20 mins to 60 mins if you combine arms, legs and abs).  I've shared this with my fitness class and they all thought it a challenge, and like our workouts, there are no rest periods during a 20 minute session.  I also think Jessica is wonderfully personable and motivating.",1395878400,6,686,4.544715447154472
4972313,5,B0067SCZ4S,"I absolutely love Jessica Smith and have been following her on you tube for almost a year.  I've done a lot of the free videos she offers along with her periodic motivational challenges so I figured this workout would be a breeze.  Well, I was wrong!  There are three separate 20 minute segments on the DVD (arms, legs, and abs) and as you go through the moves she gradually suggests ways to increase the intensity if you are up for it.  This is great for all fitness levels since you can stick with the base exercise or push yourself to include the other options.

The arms segment is my personal favorite because she targets almost every muscle in a short period of time and does enough reps to make you feel it the next day.  She's sneaky - you don't really notice how many reps you're doing as she'll demonstrate the supplemental intensity levels while you're still doing the base move.  So you're watching what to do next and forgetting that your arms feel like they're going to fall off.  It will definitely get you sweating!  I like that she tosses in a couple bouts of cardio boxing as variation.  People have noticed more definition in my arms since I started doing this!

The legs are a lot of squats and lunges with (again) options to increase the intensity.  It's intense but doable, although it could be hard on the joints if you have issues with them.

The abs were killer as well - I definitely don't have six pack but I'm in decent shape and I had to stop a few times to let my abs rest during this section.  She has numerous creative moves so it's fun that it's not just the typical crunches.  I was surprised that I managed to (almost) get through this on my first try but it is challenging.

This workout can be as intense as you want it to be so it's great for beginners and advanced exercisers.  If you're short on time you can just do one segment or if you want a well rounded full workout you can do them all.  My arms are my trouble spots so I like that I can pop in the DVD and do that section and then go to another DVD, one of Jessica's you tube videos, etc.  Jessica is my favorite instructor and she doesn't disappoint - well worth the money!",1395273600,4,2171,4.2899262899262895

She is also good at cuing the viewer to what's coming up so it's hard to get lost in the workout.  It's very useful for the DVD to be divided into 3 segments of 20 min so you can tailor your workout to your specific needs or time available.  When I can't get to the gym, this DVD is a great backup plan.",1382486400,2,476,3.9789473684210526
4972321,5,B0067SCZ4S,"I am a high school teacher and the mother of teens, so by the time all of the meetings and practices are done, weekday afternoons and evenings are out as far as workout options. On weekends I have the option for longer workouts, but Mon-Fri mornings I am VERY pressed for time. I am always looking for workout DVDs that offer 20-minute workouts, and I feel SO LUCKY to have found this one.

Jessica Smith is a great trainer who hits just the right balance of chit-chat (very little), business (great cueing and counting), and encouragement (lots). Unlike some other videos I've done, there are no background exercisers, but Jessica demonstrates different levels of each exercise so if you need to modify you always have a choice. Each move is presented as a progression of two or three levels, starting with a basic move and adding layers of difficulty.

There are really three separate workouts, complete with warmup and cool down.  If you had time to do all three together it would be a fantastic full-body workout, but even when I just do just 20 minutes on the arms or the legs or the abs I feel like I've done good work that morning. I have DVDs by Jillian Michaels, Jackie Warner, and Jessica Smith, and many of these moves, in each of the workout, are new and challenging but not impossible. I am so glad I ordered this one.

My absolute favorite thing about this DVD is that when you pop it in, you don't have to suffer through a bunch of previews. Some DVDs from Jillian or Jackie have 5 minutes of previews and diet lectures and they won't let you fast forward or skip to the menu.  This one goes straight to the menu where you can choose your workout. I appreciate this consideration of my time, since we all know that morning prep time is precious.

For a challenging workout with a pleasant trainer that offers flexible time options, this DVD is hard to beat.",1379808000,46,1872,4.507374631268436

4972325,5,B0067SCZ4S,"Jessica Smith has created a very efficient and effective workout that is divided into 3 20 min segments.

Segment one focuses on an arm routine that is low weights and high reps and mixed with fun kick boxing cardio intervals. I found this work out to be fun and enjoyable and it really challenged me while doing it but I was surprised that I was not that sore the following day. The second segment for legs is the ultimate challenge for me and I consider myself to have quite a bit of lower body strength. She has created the perfect mix of lunges and squats that progressively build up in intensity. My legs are super sore the next day after this routine. I also find that my low back is sore and I would think that anyone that suffers from low back issues would not do well with this routine. The legs is definitely my favorite segment and I love the burn that this produces. I have a new awareness of my hamstrings and inner thighs. The final segment which focuses on abs is pilates based and combines simple mat exercises with some plank cardio drills. I don't really feel like the ab routine would serve on its own for a complete exercise day but I use this routine in combination with other segments (goes perfect after the 20 minute leg segment) or other exercise videos and it feels really good to end with this 20 minute core workout.

I truly enjoy Jessica Smith. I like her presence and personality and that she is overall ""no frills"" and just seems to have a really authentic personality without trying too hard and she truly is an amazing fitness coach.",1371340800,8,1567,4.4375

The stomach exercises were different but in trying to balance with a couple of them, I again felt I was losing concentration on the muscle and did other advanced exercises while she did those.

Again, I love Jessica, but this one for my limitations with knees, wasn't a keeper.",1368662400,54,851,4.455128205128205
4972331,5,B0067SCZ4S,I really enjoyed this workout. Its really fun to do and it not a super long video.  I do plan on ordering some more of her DVDs.,1368230400,,128,3.740740740740741
4972332,4,B0067SCZ4S,"I like this video. I have a lot of Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner videos, and I like that this video incorporates some new moves that I haven't done before.",1367452800,,160,4.366666666666666
4972333,5,B0067SCZ4S,This is exactly what I was looking for. I do a lot of Jillian Michaels and love the good workout she provides but was looking for something just as good that wasn't an hour long. The 20 minute segments are great. Depending on how much time you have you can select how many you'd like to do. I thought Jessica Smith did a great job picking moves that work. It does have some short bursts of cardio in it which I also enjoyed. The only con I had was that the ab section is hard on my neck. For the first few minutes she has you in a sit up position with your neck up and it did start to make my neck hurt to the point I quit. But now that I'm aware of it I make just make some changes and try it again. Definitely glad that I bought this.,1366934400,3,736,3.848684210526316
4972334,5,B0067SCZ4S,I am always pleased with Movie Mars.  They ship fast and sell quality products.  An added bonus was the fun workout.  I enjoy Jessica Smith.  Fun Instructor.,1366588800,,157,4.703703703703703
4972335,4,B0067SCZ4S,I feel Jessica Smith is a very effective instuctor. She cues well and always puts out an heart pumping workout. It is just Jessica doing the workout with you (nobody behind her) but I like how it gives you the feel like she is your workout partner. I would recommend any of her videos for the moderate to advanced exerciser. 10 lbs down is broken up into 20 min segments of arms/legs and abs. She uses hand wts for most of the program. I always do all the segments together at once. The workout isn't as tough as Insanity (that one still sets the bar for me) but for a well rounded workout it is great.,1366329600,,602,4.198275862068965
4972336,5,B0067SCZ4S,"Another great workout from Jessica Smith. I love how unique and challenging all of the exercises are. Jessica's personality is so pleasant and not at all annoying which, coming from me, is saying a lot. I have many workout DVDs I rotate through and whenever I do this one I am always sore in a few places the next day which I love. Jessica is such a great instructor. I have recently discovered her Youtube channel JessicaSmithTV. She posts a bunch of great workouts for free which- for someone who gets bored easily- is amazing!",1364169600,2,529,4.578947368421052

4972338,5,B0067SCZ4S,"This DVD is ""must have"" for your home strength training routine. I have quite a few exercise DVD's, yet the routines on this DVD include moves I have never seen/done on any of my other videos. The routines are challenging and definitely keep your heart rate up. Jessica Smith is an awesome instructor and I would highly recommend any of her workouts!",1363132800,2,350,4.661290322580645

4972340,4,B0067SCZ4S,"I really enjoyed the different combinations of exercises.  I have an extensive fitness DVD collection and usually expect to see the same exercises rehashed, but this DVD had a fresh twist to it.  I also liked that you could actually see her sweat...she's doing the hard work with you! Good addition to the rotation!",1362096000,7,315,4.814814814814815
4972341,5,B0067SCZ4S,This is definitely a workout to put in your rotation. The arm segment is great. Lots of new moves synced with cardio. Jessica is a great instructor. This workout will get you sweating.,1360713600,,184,4.606060606060606
4972342,5,B0067SCZ4S,"I have a variety of aero/toning workouts and this is one of the best.  The instructor is well spoken, knowledgeable, and not annoying in the least.  She's easy to follow and there are no distractions, like others working out with her.  She explains everything.  This is for the intermediate exerciser.",1359331200,6,301,4.96
4972343,5,B0067SCZ4S,"I love love this DVD. I have a few of Jessica's Smith's DVD's and they are all brilliant. I especially love this one as the workouts are only 20 mins so when I can't be bothered I pop it on and the time is gone and I am done. Also you really work it in those 20 mins, the first couple of days I did the arms and legs I was aching in a good way! This is definately going to be a regular one for me.",1357171200,5,397,3.574712643678161
4972344,5,B0067SCZ4S,"I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser and have been a Jessica Smith fan for a couple of years now. I was so excited about this DVD that I just had to try all 20-minute segments yesterday, as soon as it was delivered. And, my goodness, am I feeling it today! I started with the leg workout, and I usually use 10-12 pounds for my legs, but 8 pounds more than sufficed for this one. High reps and lots of creative moves, and I really enjoyed the cardio bursts. I then moved on to the ab workout, which is heavily Pilates-based, because I wanted to be thoroughly warm but still relatively fresh for core work. This is probably one of the toughest ab workouts I've done, which says a lot as I've done many ab workouts in the past nine years, including Ab Ripper X from the P90X series. My abs were SCREAMING five minutes in. I was a little disappointed in myself because I had to take multiple breaks throughout the segment, but I'm sure I'll get accustomed to the exercises the more I do this DVD. I saved the upper body workout for last because I assumed it wouldn't exhaust me quite as much. Man, was I wrong! I typically use 5-8 pounds for most arm exercises, and I stuck to using the recommended 5 pounds for this one, but because of the volume of reps, my arms were so spent halfway through the first exercise that I probably would've been happy using 3 pounds for most of the moves. CRAZY! As with the abs workout, I unfortunately had to take a few breaks, but again, I will also get more accustomed to these (new and creative) moves the more I do them--and you best believe I will! Oh, and I LOVED the boxing cardio breaks.

One tip: Even with limited cardio, this is a BIG calorie burner. Although you can get away with working out on an empty stomach for some routines, definitely have a healthy protein-based snack an hour or two before this one! I had exhausted my reserves after the first two segments, and my body was BEGGING for protein by the time I was done.",1354233600,19,1975,4.32345013477089
4972345,5,B0067SCZ4S,"I need DVD's in my life, they get me to actually do my workouts at home (the only place I do my workouts). This particular DVD played a HUGE role in my weight loss journey. I love how it has helped me with toning upper, lower and mid sections! It is challenging (had to go back to 5 lbs after having used 8 for other workouts). Can use the 8's now for lower body, working on my upper body ;) As with all of the 10 Pound Down Videos I have gotten my hands on, I love it!",1350086400,5,469,3.795918367346939
4972346,5,B0067SCZ4S,Wanted a weight and cardio combo.  Good workout and is very challenging in my opinion.  I also like her and Holly Perkins.,1349827200,,122,4.5
4972347,4,B0067SCZ4S,I really like this work out video she gets right down to the point and I feel like I'm really doing a great work out in a short amount of time,1349740800,,142,3.6129032258064515
4972348,5,B0067SCZ4S,"I have almost ever DVD that Jessica Smith has ever put out and this is one of my absolute favorites. The DVD is broken up into 3 parts. Upper body, Abs and lower body. The upper body workout has great cardio intervals that keep you sweating while you tone up all the major muscle groups of your arms. I really love this upper body workout because you seriously FEEL it for days after.  Within a few workouts you start to see your arms really firm up. The Ab section is awesome. Jessica is known for making really creative and unique ab routines and this one does not disappoint. The lower body section is a major butt and thigh burner. Give this DVD a try. I promise that once you do it, it will get a spot as part of your regular DVD rotation. Few DVD's out there today can give you this complete of a workout.",1337126400,15,811,4.198717948717949
4972349,5,B0067SCZ4S,"This is my first Jessica Smith DVD so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I read lots of positive reviews so I decided to take the chance.  Boy, am I glad I did!  I was looking for something relatively short to add to the cardio workouts I already do.  This was a perfect fit.  I work out 5 to 6 times a week but have found myself in the dreaded plateau stage.  I'm pretty sure that Jessica is going to get me out of that in no time.  My arms were screaming by the end of the 20 minute arm workout.  My thighs were shaking for at least 10 minutes after the 20 minute leg workout.  And my abs?  I thought I had abs until this workout...this one works them like never before.  I have yet to do all 3 workouts together but plan to after a few more times seperately just to get the moves down perfectly.  I'm a workout DVD junkie so this will be in my regular rotation for a long while!",1336521600,3,877,3.9485714285714284
4972350,5,B0067SCZ4S,"I absolutely love this workout dvd. It is broken down into 3 20-minute segments for arms, legs, and abs. I do all three of them and get a great and intense toning workout. The moves are creative and fun yet very challenging. I have been doing this workout in combination with a few other workout dvds for two months and have noticed a huge difference in my muscle tone. I love her 10 Pounds Down Total Body Tune Up and Look Better Naked dvd and I will be purchasing all her other workouts as well. The best thing about Jessica's workouts are that they are creative and fun and the time really goes by fast. A lot of other workouts tend to use the same repeated moves over and over again, but Jessica uses original moves and keeps my workout routine fresh; highly recommended!",1335139200,,775,4.388888888888889
4972351,3,B0067SCZ4S,Although the workouts are good I would not go as far as to say they are terrific. I am not sure why you would be 10 down since there is minimal cardio per section. I will say that I paired this DVD with a 20 minute prior cardio routine and saw a difference faster.,1333411200,2,264,3.9074074074074074

I have her Walk Strong set at as well, and I really like it, but this one is even better, and more of a challenge because of it's length. I was sore the next day, which I love, and sore in places that I typically don't get sore doing JM. I did all 3 segments together and got a kick ass workout.
