8263869,1,B0016PM8OY,This video was incredibly homoerotic and not at all professionally done. If you're looking to learn Hawaiian Bodywork - look elsewhere!,1395446400,,135,5.476190476190476
8263870,2,B0016PM8OY,"As a student and client this DVD was purchased to observe the Lomi Lomi or Hawaiian style massage. The pretty-boy narrator/demonstrator seems unsure of himself in front of a camera. At the beginning he speaks in three-word bursts as though someone was holding up queue cards for him to read. The camera work is very amateurish throughout the presentation. If you don't have some knowledge of massage to start with this DVD won't be of much use to you. In fact, he starts out with the model's back and doesn't emphasize staying away from direct pressure on the spine until he's into the demo.

Although there are some interesting techniques shown, I thought he was rather rough and seemed to be treating the model (same one throughout the DVD) rather like a piece of meat instead of his ""partner"" in a massage session. The techniques shown are not all Lomi Lomi, either. Rather they are a stew of Swedish, Shiatsu and Hawaiian.

Finally, the narrator seems to get enjoyment out of the term ""poi pounder"" when referring to use of the heel of a closed fist.

The whole session was filmed in a very pleasant outdoor setting presumably somewhere in the Hawaiian Islands.",1311379200,,1165,4.729064039408867
8263871,1,B0016PM8OY,"This has the potential, a great man on the table, nice guy doing the massage but the camera angles the draping and the talking that he does through out the massage is distracting he should have done a great massage with a camera over the table so we could see the moves then voiced over the instructions. do not recommend",1248134400,6,321,4.366666666666666
