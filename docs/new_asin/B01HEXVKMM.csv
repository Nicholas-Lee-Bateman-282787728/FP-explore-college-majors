7786303,5,B01HEXVKMM,A great set that not only includes the two seasons but haruhi-chan and disappearance of Nagar Yuki.,1473897600,,99,4.882352941176471
7786304,2,B01HEXVKMM,"I have the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/original-release/dp/B003KO1JRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">original release</a>&nbsp;for this show, but it's pretty impractical since the episodes are all shuffled up. You can't just watch it and go, you have to interrupt it and back out and find the correct next episode.

It's a fantastic five-star show, so I immediately jumped to pre-order it when I heard about this ultimate collectors release... then it occurred to me *why* I hadn't watched the one I own at all recently. I googled for the details, and sure enough, they're ****ing it up again. If you'd like to watch BttF 3 first, or Benjamin Button on reverse, that's your prerogative... but for goodness' sake, don't impose that on us as the default! It's like watching a Sherlock Holmes mystery where the revelatory flashback showing whodunit/how the crime happened is moved to the beginning, just because it chronologically happened first.

At least this time they're including a little pamphlet that tells you how to watch the original order, rather than having to look it up online, but that isn't much consolation. You'll still need to perform the song and dance after every episode, and there's nothing like a bit of driving to take you out of the moment, assuming it doesn't slip your mind. There is absolutely no good reason you should have to do this, which is why I can confidently recommend against buying this release, just like I recommended against buying the original release.

Does multiple-watch-order technology not exist, is that it? Are Blu-rays just too old-fashioned? OK, release a separate edition, with ""correct order"" emblazoned on the front. I want to pay hundreds of dollars for this, for something I already own, just so I can actually watch it the way it was meant to be seen again. I suspect I am not alone here; Haruhi is commonly cited as one of the best anime series ever made, despite the publishers' best attempts to ""Firefly"" the poor show.",1470441600,14,2021,5.193251533742331
7786305,1,B01HEXVKMM,"Really bummed out about this set. Waited years for it, and it just doesn't deliver. At least, not me me and my friends.

This set has Melancholy in ""2009 rebroadcast"" order, which means the 2006 episodes and 2009 episodes are shuffled in between one another. You'll be watching an episode made in 2006, then suddenly you're shown an episode from 2009 (with obviously updated animation), then next episode you're back to watching animation made in 2006. It's a really frustrating setup, and if you want to watch the show in ""chronological"" or ""Bandai DVD"" orders, you'll have to switch discs a LOT to make it happen.

That alone may not warrant a 1-star rating, but the cherry on the disappointment cake is that Funimation are not selling the Haruhi-chan or Churuya-san specials on Blu-Ray unless you buy this bloated set. So, people like me who enjoy Haruhi but dislike the shuffled 2009 order can't even own the specials on Blu-Ray unless we buy the entire franchise for $130. This release is just insulting, Funimation. You've gone above and beyond in screwing us.",1469836800,15,1066,4.851648351648351
7786306,5,B01HEXVKMM,"I already own the Bandai dvds of both the first two seasons of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya as well as Haruhi-Chan, but I'm looking forward to getting these again on Blu-ray. Add to that the addition of The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-Chan, which I missed out on, and this set became an instant must have for me. I do find it odd that the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya movie was omitted from this set, but as I own the Bandai Blu-ray combo pack that's not as big of a deal for me, and if you can find it for a decent price I do recommend it. Even without the movie this is still a great value, and can't recommend this collection enough",1467590400,18,645,4.252032520325203

8765247,1,B01HEXVKMM,"Instead of the box set I ordered, I got a single blu-ray case that was completely empty. I'm not sure what happened, but this is unacceptable. I'm returning this thing and trying again to get the actual set. If I can get my problem solved, this review will be updated. This does not reflect on the quality of the show, which I personally think is great, but come on now.",1485216000,9,370,4.3

8765249,5,B01HEXVKMM,"Love TMOHS, and just watched Nagari for the first tim and it was great!  This box is sturdy, the cards are cute, and there's space for the upcoming Disappearance Blu-ray that's coming out!  Can't wait!",1483747200,,201,4.714285714285714
8765250,5,B01HEXVKMM,More than what I asked for. I didn't know it also came with an OVA and yuki-chan collection!,1478304000,,92,4.166666666666667
8765251,5,B01HEXVKMM,Exceeds my expectations for how anime should be sold. You have three complete series here in one beautiful looking box with crisp blu ray picture. Haruhi still stands as one of the greatest anime stories ever told.,1475884800,,214,4.8108108108108105
8765252,5,B01HEXVKMM,"This is the definitive way to own the Haruhi Suzumiya series. Only the Vanishing of Haruhi Suzumiya movie is missing, and that will hopefully be licensed soon. All the main episodes, the Nagato Yuki spinoffs, and all of the Chibi OVAs are here. If there is a weak point here, it is the Nagato Yuki series. Without the movie included, new fans or those who've only watched the TV series will not understand why the world of nagato Yuki exists. And while it is an above average series by itself, when compared to a masterpiece like the main Haruhi episodes, some now 10 years old but with animation that would looks good for 2016, the series seems even more average. Fun to watch, but very underwhelming.

The subtitles are a new translation from the old Bandai Entertainment release, and the major typsetting issues from those releases are gone as well. I recently had a chance to watch the Bandai blu-rays side by side with these, and the transfer in this new release is far superior in detail and color range.

The hardboard box has great art and will be a great addition to any anime collection.",1475452800,,1097,4.591836734693878
8765253,4,B01HEXVKMM,"I love this anime and was super excited for the collection, for everything you get, it's completely worth the money. I'm a little disappointed it doesn't come with the movie but that's fine. What bothers me is there is a space in one of the cases for an additional disc. Is it missing something? Unsure why that is.",1474329600,2,315,4.448275862068965
8765254,3,B01HEXVKMM,"Ok, 2 major flaws for an otherwise awesome set. First, no choice of viewing order for the first season. I'd out this under the no big deal, but for some this might be a deal breaker, not for me. Second, and the sin of this set, the lack of The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya movie which is the spiritual conclusion of the original 2 seasons (and the first quarter of the book series) and its not like a dub with the US voice cast doesn't exist (the US release was 2011). Now this is suppose to be the Ultimate Collection and I bought it under the assumption that this included the movie (my fault), so you'd believe everything was in it, but as the first point mention, there isn't even an option for the original broadcast order, which is a fun way to watch the series was was intentional made that way (even some of the stories in the book series are out of order).

Also wanna point out that the movie is out of print and a blu-ray version is incredibly hard to find and expensive because of this. Its sad to know that the rest of the books will never be made into movies, but I think the frustration over the Endless Eight during the broadcast killed it for most (8 uniquely drawn, but pretty much the same episode).",1473984000,10,1222,4.29004329004329
