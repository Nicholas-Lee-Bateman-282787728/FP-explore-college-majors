For me, Revat is a perfect combination of strength, cardio and useful self-defense skills.  The fighting techniques I've learned make me feel extremely safe and secure and able to defend myself no matter the situation - as a woman, this is invaluable. I recommend Revat to anyone who wants an enriching workout that is truly unique and enjoyable.  With this DVD set you will not be bored, you will learn a tremendous amount, and your fitness level will definitely improve.",1375920000,,582,4.586538461538462
