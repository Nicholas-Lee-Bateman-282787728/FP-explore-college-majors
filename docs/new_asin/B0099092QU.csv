8537933,2,B0099092QU,"Slash released one of the best pure rock albums of 2012 in ""Apocalyptic Love"" and has found a perfect front man in Alter Bridge vocalist Myles Kennedy. It was an album full of rock swagger tracks, the type of rock music that Slash has always played so well. It has so many standout tracks including the single ""You're A Lie"", the brilliant classic flamenco style of ""Anastasia"" and the funky opener title track ""Apocalyptic Love"".

But here is the problem I have already bought this album twice; the first edition was the Classic Rock fan pack which was much like the release for his self-titled debut in 2010 and also the Cd/DVD combo that followed for its official release.  Now what do we have? Well we have the same album repackaged with 3 extra discs, which would be great if it was extra tracks that maybe didn't make the album or a live unreleased CD but what you get is a DVD performance of his ""Made In Stoke"" DVD which was a brilliant performance, that same DVD was packaged with a two disc CD of the same show but for this release it's been edited down to one disc! The chances are if you are a Slash fan you will already have all three of these discs. So what is the selling point? It's a DVD of a show recorded in New York which would be much better suited to a single DVD release on its own rather than bundled together with a box set, at the very least they should make the DVD available to but on its own as Slash fans will have all the other material already. There is also a booklet which is a nice souvenir but is really one of those look at once type of things.

So just like Slash's debut album for which there were at least five different versions of the same album it seems that ""Apocalyptic Love"" is getting the same treatment. I wouldn't be surprised if next year the record company release yet another version next year. This is becoming an all too common trend with record labels releasing different versions of the same album in the hope that the die hards/collectors will have to have it.",1355702400,8,2017,4.344827586206897

My husband is going to be super excited as this is not easy to get hold of over here. He already loved the Apocalyptic Love album and the live show in NY, so this is just going to enhance the whole experience.
Just thought I should pass this money saving tip on. Enjoy!",1354838400,2,446,4.137931034482759
