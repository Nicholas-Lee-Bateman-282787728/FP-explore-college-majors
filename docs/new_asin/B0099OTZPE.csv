8538078,5,B0099OTZPE,"Very nice presentation on this steel book Human Centipede set! Love the cover artwork of Martin and the inside is also very well designed. Human Centipede 1 & 2 on dvd and bluray as well. Great picture and extras in this set. Human Centipede 2 is cut though, but the extras and slick looking case make up for that. Worth adding to your horror collection! Id highly recommend, you will need a region free player though to watch this.",1456444800,,432,4.481012658227848
