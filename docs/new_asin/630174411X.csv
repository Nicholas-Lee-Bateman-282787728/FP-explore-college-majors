348439,5,630174411X,"It's hard too find an action movie wherein the female lead is someone I'd want for a friend.  And, yes, I know the actor playing Faith was at leat 20 years younger than Eric Idle.
But!!!  How many action/comedy women get subtext?  Faith is working her way through college, by holding 2 jobs, and we get a glimpse of her family life, and, when she is ___justifiably___ angry with her boyfriend (Idle) the movie doesn't dismiss what she has to say.
Not for people into total escapism--raises too many points, and by the way it pre-empts ""Analyze This"" by many years in stating, humorously, that the gangster's life is stressful.

That said, the movie made me laugh--I went to Catholic school; I didn't find it offensive--if you are so devout that you can't question your faith at all, you're not really thinking, and then no, you won't enjoy this movie.  (Don't see Life of Brian, either.) ""Of COURSE it doesn't make sense--that's why you gotta have faith.""  That's almost what the nuns told me--except I wasn't allowed to laugh.
I'll watch anything Robbie Coltrane is in because he is so good, and Eric Idle's Pythonesque timing is totally on. The writing has good pace, going from believable but funny to silly but fathomable to so silly you just have to suspend your disbelief just at the right moment.",1040601600,6,1303,4.692982456140351
348440,4,630174411X,"Nuns on the Run is an excellent comedy for those who almost died laughing at the Monty Python flicks and wanted to get in a few more chuckles before the era completely went away.  Though not a Python film, it does have subtle hints of that flavor; after all, it does star Erik Idle.  This is by no means a rib cracker, but the plot is silly enough to enjoy and the humor is adequate to get the viewer from one scene to the next.  I rated it four stars because it is such a darn funny concept whether it was fully developed or not.  My favorite scene was when the hit men were being questioned by their crime boss after losing the two ""nuns"" in a three-way gang shoot-out.  They stood at his desk like idiots answering, ""I don't know,"" then, ""I don't know,"" then, ""I don't know,"" then...well...you get the idea, to all of his inquiries.  It doesn't sound like much in a review, but the scene is quite humorous.  Take this comedy with a grain of salt and expect 3 star entertainment.  Personally, I rated it a little high, and I do hope it finds its way to DVD.",1027728000,4,1059,4.207920792079208
348441,1,630174411X,"This film is a huge disappointment. It's supposed to be a comedy, but unfortunately there is very little that is funny in this movie. The movie stars Eric Idle and Robbie Coltrane as two old time, small time crooks who want to get out of the business and go straight. However, the only way they can do so is by double crossing their boss and stealing two briefcases full of dough. They escape the crime scene by running into a nunnery and hide out there posing as two visiting nuns.

Though both Idle and Coltrane are comic geniuses, there wit just doesn't flow in this dull and slow movie. Not only that, but the film is full of Catholic bashing and other than the few dead guy jokes and the cross dressing thieves, the only other humor comes at the expense of Christianity.

I wanted this movie to end less than thirty minutes after it started, but it went on and on and on. Sadly, the best part of the film was the music. But a movie is not worth watching solely for it's musical merits. What a shame.",1012348800,,1004,4.306878306878307
348442,4,630174411X,"Brian and Charlie are a couple of small-time crooks who liked things better in the old days. In the old days, crooks didn't carry guns and nobody ever got hurt. Now, they work for a young psycho who doesn't trust anybody. Bank robbers carry guns and guys who try to quit the gang disappear without a trace. When their boss sets up a caper to rob a rival gang (a Chinese bunch known as The Triads), Brian and Charlie decide to keep the loot for themselves and escape to Rio. Things get complicated, however, when they bungle the escape and find themselves hiding out in a convent. On top of that, Brian realizes he's in love with Faith, the extremely near-sighted waitress he's been dating.
This movie is loaded with laughs. See Charlie and Brian, dressed as nuns, buying face powder and men's razors in the drug store across from the convent. Or there's Brian (Eric Idle) teaching a class on the ""Trinity"" (people have been arguing that one since the 4th century) in a classroom full of girl students (and they're not little girls). And, along with funny scenes, there are plenty of funny lines. The cast is good, too. Idle and Coltrane work nicely together and are very funny, the actress who plays Faith is delightfully ditzy until the chips are down, and there are some funny characters among the nuns, as well.
""Nuns On The Run"" won't go down as one of the funniest comedies on film, but it's better than average and has lots of laughs in it. I really like it and I recommend it to folks who appreciate good comedy (especially of the British variety).",998006400,4,1555,4.537366548042705

348781,2,630174411X,"This game is a kind of reverse-Scotland Yard.  It is the same kind of outguessing/chase game but instead of a few chasing one, it is 2 chasing many.  I wasn't a fan of Scotland Yard so I didn't have high hopes for this one going in.

My one playthrough was with 8 people, the max for this game, which has 2 nuns chasing 6 novices.  If one of the novices gets back to their room with their ""secret desire"" then they win.  The nuns only win by catching the novices 6 times (equal to the number of novices) before this happens.  With 8 it is nigh-impossible for the nuns to win.  There is only so much ground 2 players can cover on the map while following somewhat stringent movement rules.  No matter what one of these novices is going to have a path that gets them back to the room before the nuns can catch them 6 times.  I can see how the game would be a lot more balanced with fewer players though.

Aside from the imbalance with 8 players, this game has two other big problems.  The first is a set of rules that doesn't always make sense.  A big example of this is that when the novices get a key of a certain color they can use that key to open any locked door on the map, not just the doors matching that color.  If this is the case then why even color-code the keys/locks?

This first problem is compounded by the second which is one of, if not the worst, written rulebook for a game I've ever seen.  In just a single playthrough we came across 2-3 different rules situations that were not explained at all in the book.  Don't get me wrong, I understand rules confusion can happen in games but a.  This is not the most complicated game system and b.  2-3 different rules clarifications needed on the first play tells me that they are common enough occurrences that the rulebook should have explained them.

I will say though that the theme is goofy and fun but the game system is not very well done in my opinion.  I'm not a fan of the set paths the nuns have to follow and the amount of penalty the nuns receive for running at the benefit of moving just one more space than the novices can for example.  And there are several more poorly done elements compared to Scotland Yard which, while I don't particularly enjoy, is at least elegantly crafted.

This game just feels very rushed from the bad design to the skimpy rulebook.",1416268800,,2334,4.26879271070615

The best part of the game has got to be the excitement of having the Abbess or Prioress start chasing after someone. It's especially fun if one of the acolytes is able to make a narrow escape! Reviewing how everyone took their turns throughout the game at the end makes for some pretty good laughs too!

My only criticism is that is somewhat limited on ways to win. Maybe I am still too new to the game to appreciate some of the strategy that more advanced players might employ, but right now it's basically very linear.

We all enjoyed the game, it is different from many of the games we already have.  It's a bit of a deduction game where one player controls the Prioress and the Abbess, the other players are the Novice Nuns who are skulking around trying to find their secret  wish (for example: a letter from home, book of dark magic, bottle of brandy, etc.) which is determined by randomly drawing a card from the deck of ""secret wishes"".  The Novices move around the board secretly by using a special movement sheet where you mark down how many spaces you moved, how you moved (up, down left, right), and where you stopped. Your playing pieces are not used on the board at all unless you get caught, then your playing piece is put on the board to head back towards your room until the Abbess/Prioress cannot see you anymore, then you can sneak off again.  The player controlling the Prioress and Abbess moves them around following certain routes hoping that they will cross a path that one of the novices did or that they will get close enough that they are within earshot so that they can hear the Novices moving around.  The game ends if the Abbess/Prioress catches the Novices a certain number of times (they must catch any of the Novices equal to the number of Novice nuns/players in the game) in which case they win.  In order for one of the Novices to win, you must find the key you need to get your secret wish, retrieve the item and return back to your room before you and the other Novices are caught by the Abbess/Prioress player that certain number of times.  In the beginning it seems like the Abbess/Prioress player is at a disadvantge and will never catch the Novices running around, but you would be surprised how easy it is for the that player to stumble upon the Novices!  In our game, the Abbess/Prioress player won.  ***Fun family game, but would probably be confusing for younger players***",1388448000,2,2115,4.52755905511811

It relies on the good honest values of the players as each novice runs around to collect a key, a secret, and get back to their cell.  Their whereabouts are kept on folded bits of paper.  The abbess and mother nun run around in plain view and listen or see the novices.  A dice roll tells the noisiness of the novice moving about the abbey  and the numbered paths around the game board tell when the novices are seen.  It is tricky to be the abbess and mother superior; some players prefer to take on that role.  People who are good at chess like this role.

348974,3,630174411X,"One of the best experiences in board games is playing as Mr X in the classic Ravensburger title Scotland Yard. You are secretly moving around a map of London, trying to slip through the ever-tightening net of inspectors who are trying to capture you. It's hugely rewarding to escape, and extremely nerve-wracking as you watch and listen to them plot how to capture you, and speculate and guess as to where you are. The only trouble with that game is that there's only one Mr X, and playing as the inspectors is not nearly as fun.

Which brings us to Nuns on the Run. The designer took that great, rewarding aspect of Mr. X and made it so that the majority of the players in this game get that experience - one of hoping desperately not to be caught and enjoying slipping through the net of the 'guards'. For that alone, this game deserves high praise - it's very fun to play as the novices.

Just like in Scotland Yard though, playing as the guards isn't so great. It's fine, and it's good that only 1 person has to do it, but it's not nearly as fun.

The game is also full of procedural minutiae. You have checks for line-of-site, sound checks, die rolls for being heard, and various cards to select and flip and what-not. It takes all the simplicity out of the Scotland Yard model, and consequently is much more fiddly and more work to play (and takes a lot longer as well).

Overall, it's a good trade-off because of the thrill of being a sneaky novice, but the fiddliness overhead should not be ignored.",1364515200,9,1507,4.4296028880866425

Some of the longer reviews have already given enough of a description of the basic details, even mentioning the possibility of offending, or not, Catholics.
I still remember Robbie Coltrane ""crossing"" himself, no doubt that riles some people but then so would the idea of a couple of, so obviously, men being able to pass themselves off as women.

 No extras I think Amazon says but I remember something about some, I'm sure they were ""acting"", retired nuns endorsing the movie. No one so far has mentioned the remarks Mother Superior made about the Convent keeping the briefcase full of cash I & C left behind in their hurry to escape, bet that offended some.

Only one or two reviews mentioned the girl's shower scene in which Coltrane was watching over the girls, ""too shy"" to join them, he and Idle handled that well. Not sure what the point in the scene being in the movie was- PG-13 movie that I'm surprised didn't get an R for the amount of, non sexual, nudity.

348977,4,630174411X,"I've had this game about a year and in that time have had plenty of fun times with it. I've played it exclusively with my daughters and in many ways this is extremely fortunate. One of the downsides of the games is that the learning curve can be a little steep due to somewhat confusing rules.

In short, the game is split into the naughty nuns (up to 6) who are out of their rooms. Each nun is playing for themselves. Patrolling the Abbey, and making sure all the nuns stay in their rooms are the two guards (always 2, can be played by either one of two people). The guards form a team and win or lose together. In the games I've played, it has been necessary for me to always play both guards.

The complexity and potential misunderstandings come from the fact that only the guards player tokens are placed on the board. The nuns, who are sneaking through the Abbey looking for their stuff, are not placed, except under line-of-sight (LOS) rules. Because the nuns are hidden, each spot on the board is given a location number, and the nuns must mark their locations on paper each turn. Each turn you play there are also choices each nun and guard must make on their movement speeds, which affect whether they can potentially be heard by a guard. i.e. a running nun will be heard at farther distances than a nun who is standing still.

So each turn consists of the nuns deciding their movement speed and then marking their locations on their game sheet. The nuns then make a noise roll and check if a nun has potentially heard them. The sneaking nuns have freedom to choose their own movement on the board. Nuns also have some cards they can play in a tight spot.

The guards go second each turn. The guards can choose their movement speeds. A walking guard can hear a nun better then a running guard. But unlike the nuns, the guards have per-determined movement paths that are decided by card draws. Once a path is completed than a new path is chosen. If a nun is within LOS, then that nun places their playing piece on the game board. A guard can only move freely while a nun is within LOS or if they have heard noise. Once there is no noise, or the nun is out of LOS, the guard must return to their paths. In order to catch nuns, the guards have a slightly higher running speed than the nuns.

All in all, it's a lot of silly fun. My kids get nervous whenever they think they're about to be heard or caught. The main issues come from not always knowing LOS rules. There are three big areas on the game board and the rulebook attempts to help LOS by having a matrix in the back of the rules to resolve LOS issues. It is helpful, but having to refer to it too often slows the game down. Now that my family knows the rules better, the game flows more quickly. Most games are done within an hour with three players.

Another issue is the age range of the game. It is largely accurate. The rules are complicated enough that younger players won't understand it very quickly. An 8yr old who can read well might be able to play, but younger children can not. This poses a problem with my family since my youngest was 5 when I bought the game, and she hates when she is excluded from any boardgames. The solution I found to include her was for me to play as both guards, while my older children play the nuns. Then I have my youngest help me select movement speeds for the guards, roll the die, and move the guard game pieces around the board. This has been a good compromise since the guard game pieces stay on the board constantly and it makes it easier for my youngest to understand the flow of the game and feel included. Most games I've bought with age ranges that says my youngest is too young to play I've been able to fully include her with minor changes, but this game really requires an older child to understand. I don't know why the upper age range is 14 since older children and adults should find the game quite fun too.

While we've have fun with three players, I think a 4-5 person game would be the best in terms of enjoyment and time to play.",1360368000,3,4055,4.29281045751634

349040,4,630174411X,"I picked up Nuns on the Run, and played with a group of 8 people. These are my thoughts after the first play.

Explaining the rules is probably one of the only ""cons"" on my list of positive comments. I had familiarized myself on the rules, watched a couple demo videos, and was pretty confident leading the game, but still had lengthy pauses to refer to the rules. This isn't a huge minus, of course you refer to the rules especially in the first game. But, the simplicity of the game's concept is slightly marred by somewhat unclear rules.

I played as one of the two guard nuns, patrolling the abbey. Playing the the guard wasn't as rigid as I had thought it might be, and I was off my assigned path more turns than not. It was a lot of fun to slowly move step by step calling ""Can I see you? Can I see see anybody?"" until finally a novice appeared around a corner, and a chase ensued.

5 out of 6 novices ended up wanting to play again afterward, so I consider that a success. The sixth novice was a hardcore gamer who gave Nuns on the Run a ""Glad I played it once, probably don't need to again"" rating, which is actually very good from him.

A novice ended up winning on turn 9, after the two guards got caught up in the big center room for a couple turns. It definitely takes more skill to play the guards well, as there are up to 6 novices to keep track of and hinder. I'd like to try the game with 5 or 6 players as well.

From showing off the box to explaining the rules to the end of the game, everybody's reaction held firm that Nuns on the Run is a light concept with curious gameplay wrapped in some excellent art. I recommend this game for groups with a secret wish for fun.",1350259200,6,1687,4.1310975609756095

349159,4,630174411X,"My partner who is a non-gamer thought this game looked fun so we bought it as a possible good middle-ground with myself (a gamer who prefers a fair amount of strategy in games).  We've now played this game a few times and here are some thoughts so far.

First of all, the materials themselves have a very high production value.  The board and tokens are cardboard and have a solid feel to them and the cards don't feel flimsy.  The board (the convent layout) is very artistically detailed, as are the cards and tokens.  Many of the pieces have a certain whimsical quality to their design to reflect the cartoonish, lighthearted flavor of the game.

Second, the game does have a somewhat steep learning curve.  As other reviewers have noted, the rules for the game are a bit more complex than a ""traditional"" family game night board game.  For example, for the ""nuns on the run"" (aka the novices) they normally don't have a player token on the board.  Instead, they track their movements on a separate, private sheet.  However, gaining an understanding of the basic movement options and tracking movements wasn't our primary issue.  The main difficulties we had related to the rules for the ""guards"" (aka the abbess and prioress) to be able to locate the novices, and particularly the interaction between movements and listening (""line of sight"" is also often something of a judgment call and sometimes lead to novices revealing themselves when they shouldn't have, for example).  The rule book is not the most straightforwardly written in this regard and it took us a couple of play-throughs and consultation of a boardgame fan forum to get those rules down pat (and we're not 100% sure we're there yet).

Third, the actual gameplay.  Despite the difficulties with figuring out the rules, the game is just plain fun to play (so far).  The premise and particular details of the game are amusing to start with.  As the guard(s), the anticipation involved in searching for the novice(s) and, once locating them, hunting them down, maintains an exciting role.  As a novice, the fun is in figuring out the right mix of sneakiness and flat out fleeing in order to elude the guards.  That said, there do seem to be some problems with balance that might erode the fun in the long term.  In our two player games it seemed to us that the guards had the edge in locating the novice, and once there was any hint where the novice was located it was easy to corner and/or catch them.  However, (especially since others say the guards have a hard time finding the novices with smaller groups) part of this might have been because of misunderstanding the location/movement rules so we'll see if this remains the case with more play time.  On the other hand, other boardgame site reviews suggest that with large numbers of players (for example, all 6 novices) the balance tends to tip to one of the novices winning.  I personally see this as less of an issue as it seems more ""fun"" if the novices do have an edge, especially if players rotate through the roles.

Overall I recommend this game, particularly for groups of 3 or more.  This game has appeal for both a casual gaming night and a group of gamers, and makes a very good choice for a mixed group.",1306022400,4,3238,4.660211267605634

There are very specific rules, and the players moving the Abbess & Prioress must trust that the other players are paying attention & being honest.
One drawback is that, as a Nun on the Run, you must scan the board to plan out your next move.  Since there is no game piece to denote where you are on the board, any watchful Abbess/Prioress can roughly tell where your Nun may be by observing where you look on the map each turn.

349161,5,630174411X,"I bought this game within the last month and have played it half a dozen times since then.  I feel that this has given me a good feel for the game and I can safely give a review that is clear and concise.  Hopefully you will find this review helpful.

Nuns on the Run is a game released in 2010 by Mayfair Games.  The game revolves around six novices who have a secret wish that needs to be fulfilled, this ranges from Medicine to help them sleep to a book of magic.  The game can be played by up to 8 people, with six novices and two guards (the Abbess and the Prioress).  Usually one person plays both guards (at eight players one person plays each guard), and each other player randomly chooses a novice to move through the game.  The object?  Make your way to your secret wish (behind a locked door, so you'll need a key!) and back to your cell before the Abbess and Prioress find you.  And you only have 15 turns to do it!

The game is fairly simple, each novice writes on their sheet where their novice is moving each round.  The only figures moving on the board usually are the Abbess and the Prioress.  The Abbess and the Prioress are fairly predictable people, and follow a colored path on the board.  They can only veer from this path if they see a novice, hear a novice, or see a ""vanished"" token (where a novice had just been basically).  The game plays a lot like Hide and Go Seek, and when the Abbess and Prioress are on your tail your heart pounds like you're actually hiding!

Each round the novices go collectively (and remember you never know where they are either!) and then you each roll to see how far away the guards can hear you.  Even if you make your roll, you may end up on the run again if someone who was close to you makes a noise!  After the novices go, the guards either follow their path or they can go off investigating after the novices if one of the above conditions is accurate.  If a novice is caught her Secret Wish is removed and she is sent back to her cell (but as soon as she is out of sight she can again venture forth after her Secret Wish).  The guards win if they catch a number of novices equal to the number of novices playing (they can catch the same novice multiple times and each one counts as a capture!), or if by the end of 15 turns none of the novices have made it back to their cell with their Secret Wish.  At the end of the guards turn they roll to hear the Novices again (which can affect the next turn's movements).

That's a simplified version anyway.

But here's the downsides:

Like someone else said, the insert for the box is made strangely.  It goes really high up in the box, and for no particular reason since there aren't an abundance of pieces to this game.  The top of the box is shorter than the bottom of the box, so even if the board fit well above the insert there would still be some of the bottom of the box showing.  I don't feel the need to rubber band it as it is a fairly snug fit, and this is a minor issue overall.

The rulebook:  There is a lot of Line of Sight judgement calls in this game, and they attempt to clarify it (to a good extent) as much as possible.  However...this rulebook was one of the more disorderly ones I've read.  The rules for when a novice is ""caught"" are not easy to find on a quick scan and not very expansive (like how long do you have to stay ""caught"" and when you flip your card back over).  We've had to make a few house rulings on this, so they guards don't go after the same person over and over.  I'd like an entire section labeled ""Caught"" and what happens and how long it lasts.  That way when you're learning the game (and the easiest way to learn this game, much like the other new games coming out, is to play it). I just found the rules to be disorderly and less helpful than they could have been.  You can learn the game from them, but you need to read the entire entry for everything, rather than skimming for main points.

Recommendation:  Buy it!  It's a lot of fun, and a good game for up to 8 people.  I think the game runs ideally at 4 players or more, as I played a game with three people where the guards only heard the novices once the entire game.  I have not played a game at 8 people, so I'm not sure how well it works with one person playing each guard, but I think it could be entertaining. This game definitely captures the essence of Hide and Go Seek though, as you get very anxious when the guards are close or even chasing you!",1298332800,16,4469,4.146341463414634

Two gangsters, - one Catholic and one non-catholic, wonderfully portrayed by Robbie Coltrane and Eric Idle, both of whom who have a real flair for comedy, are tired of gang life and try to escape by hiding in a nunnery and passing themselves off as nuns.  The result is hilarious.

The tough guys are two bit actors, completely unconvincing in their roles, especially the ones who play the Asian gang, but the movie is loaded with laughs, and improves with each viewing, as one picks up more and more of the subtlies perhaps missed the first time around.

It's pretty much slapstick in parts, but there are some wonderfully rich and uproariously funny bits, such as when one of the ""sisters"" (Robbie Coltrane) has to supervise the girls shower; the scene where the non-Catholic ""nun"" (Eric Idle) has to give a class in Catechism about which he knows absolutely nothing and really messes up, will have every Catholic viewer rolling in the aisles, as is the part where he sneaks into the Confessional and pretends to be a priest in order to hear his girlfriend's confession.  Then, of course, there is Father Shamus, who has a bit of trouble keeping his hands to himself, and who tries his best to hit on one of the newly arrived ""nuns.""

The components and artwork are all very well done. The box comes with an insert for convenient component storage.

So the board stacks above the box level and makes it so the box lid can't completely slide down. I use a rubber band to ensure the lid stays snug.

However, if you're used to playing games like Monopoly, Sorry, or Connect Four, you may want to look for a game with a more simple and clear set of rules (the rules are difficult to follow). One suggestion to overcome this challenge is to go to [...] and look up BGG-user threads on rules clarifications.

Good luck!",1275868800,10,987,4.5027932960893855

She bought it used, from an Amazon reseller, and when I went to play it I got an error message saying ""Wrong Region.""  What does THAT mean????  I live in Arizona, and it came from an Amazon seller in New Jersey.

Needless to say I am EXTREMELY disappointed.  I like Eric Idol, and I've heard this is a very funny movie.  But if you live in Arizona I guess you're just out of luck.  All I got was a DVD that I can't play. :-(",1251417600,,534,4.0095238095238095

349261,3,630174411X,"Really a lot more entertaining than it should be, this is to all intents and purposes a one-gag film. Petty crooks Brian (Eric Idle of Monty Python fame) and Charlie (Robbie Coltrane) are on the run from the police after they have a plan to steal a suitcase full of money from the Triads and then run off to Brazil with it. So in an attempt to ""go straight"" they hide out in a convent dressed as nuns, attempting to pass themselves off as the genuine article.

With its' mix of slapstick and some crude gags (Nun to Robbie Coltrane who wants him to teach a class: Do you have experience with 18 year old girls? Robbie: Yes, plenty) , the film cant hide its British origins and has a very 80's feel. The film provides some good laughs though as Brian and Charlie get into comic scrapes trying to avoid the Triads, the Police, and also Brian's girlfriend Faith, he can't let her guess he is hiding out in the convent.",1141603200,3,915,4.319767441860465

Irreverent Catholic humour abounds in NUNS ON THE RUN (Anchor Bay), a low brow romp that follows Eric Idle and Robbie Coltrane -- two crooks with loot taken from bigger crooks -- into a convent where they don habits and pretend to be nuns assigned to teaching young girls.

I laughed out loud at these desperate, inept, ugly nuns and their silly complications.",1114128000,10,429,4.558441558441558
349264,5,630174411X,"A very enjoyable movie - not exactly high brow humor, or not typical off beat Pythonesque humor (Eric Idle of Monty Python fame is Brian, and Robbie Coltrane of the Cracker series is Charlie).  Brian and Charlie are gangsters who after stealing some drug money from the London triad, and avoiding a double cross from their boss, take 'sanctuary' in a convent.  They do this by hiding as drag-Nuns; Sister Euphemia and Sister Inviolata (to see Robbie Coltrane in a nun's habit is a howl).
Brian and Charlie manage to have a positive effect on the nunnery, and they even repent (of a sorts) - but without returning the money of course (The good guys win - according to Brian's logic - when drug money is used for good works!).
There is some light hearted making fun of Catholicism here, but it is not mean spirited, so it shouldn't offend anyone.  Charlie - who grew up Catholic - defends the church a few times while discussing religion with Brian.
Break out the popcorn, and fire up the movie and enjoy!",1112400000,14,1003,4.561111111111111

And that's just one line from this really funny movie!

The plot of this movie revolves around two extremely inept gangsters who decide to steal a large sum of money off a gang boss and end up dressing up as nuns and hiding out in a convent!

Everybody, especially the two main characters, Brian Hope aka Sister Euphemia of the Five Wounds, Five Wounds for short and Charley MacManus, is quite mad!  Needless to say they make some seriously ugly nuns.

Which brings me to a point that I had a few nuns as teachers in grade school and some of them looked a lot like Charley!  LOL!
