1471955,3,B00005JLQ8,"The Santa Clause 2 is the film charachter Tim Allen was meant to play as Santa.  He gets along well with the other legndaries - like the tooth fairy and Mother Nature, but the race is on to fill the unknown Mrs. Clause in Santa's contract  Magic ensues when Molly Shannon, the principal at Charlie's, Santa's School,  dates a slimmer Santa.  This film has great tension as the deadline approaches for Santa
 to be married, and the fact that Santa is about half his old size.  The special effects and costumes are great at the North Pole, and the comedy is appealing.  Ever seen a reindeer in training?
  But I wonder at the release date, didn't someone notice Christmas is more than a month away.  It's a puzzle to their fuzzy logic.",1036627200,2,733,4.484848484848484
1471956,5,B00005JLQ8,"I usually expect sequels to disappoint me but this is not the case with The Santa Clause 2 which is just as funny, exciting and heartwarming as the first.  Tim Allen's performance as Santa/Scott Calvin is top notch and his scenes with Comet the reindeer are hilarious.
In this movie Santa must find a new wife before Christmas or else he cannot be Santa any longer, that only gives him 28 days and de-Santification process has already started to take place.  Santa/Scott also faces another problem with his son Charlie who has now made it to the naughty list by defacing school property to rebel against the school principal Carol Newman, who seems to be the female version of Scrooge as far as Holiday Cheer is concerned.  Carol and Scott are at each other throats from the beginning but the sparks fly right away between the couple and one of the most beautiful scenes of the movie is when Scott uses his remaining magic to take Carol on a sleigh ride and make the faculty Christmas party fun.
Scott also faces another problem at the North Pole with the evil Toy Santa that was created to take his place during his absence.  The Evil Santa wants to give all the Children Coal in their Stockings and its up to Scott to save the day.
This was an excellent movie and I know that as soon as its on a video I will add it to make collection of Holiday Movies.",1036627200,5,1355,4.408
1471957,5,B00005JLQ8,"The first Santa Clause was a wonderful take on the big guy in red. It made me a believer in Santa Claus. It showed how human Santa is.
The Santa Clause 2: The Mrs Clause was just as awesome. This time, Santa must find a Mrs. before Christmas Eve otherwise Santa will become Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) for good.
The movie was geared towards children; or children at heart. This time there are more elves, 2 Santas and a reindeer in training named ""Chet"". The opening sequence is precious. It shows a militaristic view of how Santa and the elves keep their ""North Pole"" home a secret. Then there was the scene with the ""symbols"" of make believe. There was Mother Nature, Father Time, the Easter Bunny, Cupid, the Sandman and the Tooth Fairy (or as he wanted to be known as THE MOLINATOR.
Charlie (Eric Lloyd), Scott Calvin's son, is all grown up and getting into plenty of trouble. He is rebelling against Christmas because he cannot tell anyone what his dad does for a living.
Scott's ex-wife Laura Miller (Wendy Crewson), now married to Neil (Judge Reinhold), is the legal guardian of Charlie. Her part was small.
The movie centered on Carol Newman (Elizabeth Mitchell), the principal of Charlie's school. She is constantly giving Charlie a hard time because of his behavior. Scott, or Santa, comes in to talk to her and save his son from being suspended. In the process, he (Scott) starts to pursue Carol because the ""Mrs Clause"" runs out Christmas Eve. Santa, now Scott because he has ""desantaficated"" himself, has a little Santa magic to use. If he runs out before finding a wife, he cannot return to the North Pole.
Our lovable head elf, Bernard (David Krumholtz) is back. He has the task of keeping the North Pole afloat while a duplicate (& military style) plastic Santa runs things.
The music was beautiful. The sets were superiorly designed and detailed.
The whole movie is enchanting. In this day and age with war all around us and nothing but ""R"" and ""PG-13"" rated films, it is nice to have a ""G"" rated movie for everyone. It was a thrill to see the typical Disney opening sequence.
You do not have to be a kid to see this. I believe in Santa Claus. Tim Allen is brilliant. I truely believe in Santa. When I turn 90 years young, I will still believe in Santa.
Go see this movie. You will believe.",1036368000,34,2304,4.540865384615385
1471958,4,B00005JLQ8,"The movie is not as original or as funny as the first, but still I guess it's for fans that enjoyed the first one. It doesn't have the magic of the original movie, but it makes up for the bad filmmaking with enchanting performances. It won't keep the whole family cheering and smiling like the first flick.
It revolves around Santa starting the search for the loving Mrs. Claus. Tim Allen has been Santa Claus for the past eight years now, and his loyal elves consider him the best Santa ever (shockingly?). But Tim's got problems. His son has landed on this year's ""naughty"" list. The once sweet and kind Charlie has turned into a nasty boy. More problems for Santa! Apparently he signed a contract! If Ol' Santa doesn't get married by Christmas Eve, he'll stop being Santa! Confused about what he should do he leaves (for awhile), leaving a temporary Claus in charge of Santa Land. If all this wasn't stressful enough, the temporary Santa has made some nasty (not temporary) changes.
It's quite good actually but too many conflicts, too many changes, and too many surprises stop from making it better than the original.",1036368000,,1121,4.695431472081219
1471959,1,B00005JLQ8,"I'm a very liberal person and i have no belief in political correctness but somehow i don't approve of how the legend of Santa Claus is being portrayed.  Is this really the way we want our kids to think of Santa?  (those kids that still believe in Santa that is).  Please remember folks that the legend of Santa is really based on a real person, Saint Nicholas.  This film as well as the first version isn't how i would like to remember 'ol Saint Nick.  Somehow after working and meeting Walt Disney, i don't believe that he would of approved of this film either.",1036281600,4,563,4.375
1471960,4,B00005JLQ8,"""The Santa Clause 2: The Mrs. Clause"" is a decent enough sequel, buoyed mainly by Tim Allen's engaging performance, which is added by the fact that all of his comic excess is vented through the ""toy"" Santa that is created to fool the elves at the North Pole while Santa is out shopping for a wife.  The movie splits into two plot lines.  For the kiddies there is the toy Santa deciding to maintain a strict interpretation of what it means to be ""naughty"" and put coal in the stocking of every child.  For the adults there is the attempt of Scott/Santa to woo, win and wed Carol Newman (Elizabeth Mitchell), the principal at the school where Charlie Calvin (Eric Lloyd) has been defacing school property with anti-Christmas graffiti.
As the clock ticks down on the efforts to find his Mrs. Claus, Scott begins the process of de-Santification, which means the beard and belly end up disappearing.  The best sequence of the film is when Scott manages to actually talk himself into a date with Principal Newman and uses his entire reserve of magic to impressive her, which he does.  We are impressed, even though part of what he does is the same sort of thing that convinced Charlie's step-father Neil (Judge Reinhold) that Santa was real the last time around.  But for me this movie comes down to the moment when Carol has to become convinced of the truth and I did not find the movie's solution to that pivotal moment to be particularly memorable or moving, as much as I wanted it to be.
However, that objection will matter not a whit to the small fry who will be more concerned with flying reindeer and the final encounter with the toy Santa's army of toy soldiers (which ends up as a very weak rehash of ""Babe in Toyland"").  Still, a holiday movie this time of year that the kids will enjoy is a good thing.  There are some nice character bits turned in by Art LeFluer as the Tooth Fairy, Peter Boyle as Father Time, Michael Dorn as the Sandman, Kevin Pollack as Cupid, and Molly Shannon as a prospective bride who is clearly Santa's #1 fan.  Final note: Be sure to stick around for the first part of the end credits because you do not want to bolt out of your seats and be the first person out the door at the end of this one.",1036281600,15,2227,4.425427872860635
1471961,3,B00005JLQ8,"A nice holiday film. Pretty good sequel.  Not quite as warm as the first, but touching at times and certainly enjoyable family entertainment.  The plot is ok; the writing is good.
About seven years after the events in the first ""Clause"", the North Pole is bustling with activity about a month before Christmas.  The opening sequence gives a nice, fanciful view of Santa's village and workshops.  You see Santa as a good manager/leader happily encouraging the elves in their efforts.
But trouble is on the horizon - literally in the opening sequence and figuratively in the form of two problems: Charlie, Santa's son, has grown into a teenager and is getting in trouble for rebelling against a repressive school principal with no holiday cheer; and Santa finds another ""clause"" that says he must find a Mrs. Claus or he will be ""de-Santafied"", reverting back to Scott Calvin.  And he has only 28 days before this marriage must occur, coinciding of course with Christmas Eve.
A cute scene occurs at the North Pole as it is Santa's turn to host a Board Meeting of Legendary Characters: The Easter Bunny, Cupid, The Tooth Fairy, Mother Nature, Father Time (Peter Boyle) and The Sandman (Michael Dorn of Star Trek:TNG fame).
Charlie now has a six year old stepsister and this young actress does a very nice job with her role. She is charming.
While Santa is away looking for a wife and tending to Charlie's troubles, bad tidings occur at the North Pole - beware of soul-less technology and a rigid enforcement of ""the rules""!
I don't like giving anything away for people who plan to see the movie.  I would suggest that this movie will work much better if you have seen the first movie.  So if you haven't seen ""The Santa Clause"", rent and watch that before this.
I also wonder how effective this movie would be for children under six. This sequel's content, while rated G, feels a bit older than the first.
The acting is well-done and comes across as genuine, though the Bernard character seems a bit overplayed with more broad physicality than seems needed.
Happy Holidays!",1036195200,17,2070,4.749303621169917
1471962,5,B00005JLQ8,"What a riot!! The entire audience laughed throughout the entire movie, and it was a sold out showing. It's not often I find a flick all three kids walk out loving since they're 3, 5 and 14 years old.
I loved the first ""Santa Clause"" and was pleasantly surprised to find all the original main characters / cast back, and not some capitalist driven attmept at an eight-years-later-rewrite of the first movie. ""Santa Clause 2"" is a truly original sequel that complements the first go round. Tim Allen's hilarious comedy and keen sense of wit shine once again, and the entire cast contribute awesome talent and performances.
And for those adults who, like me, are true believers - Disney actually did an incredible job bringing the North Pole with all the Christmas Magic and Citizens to life. This one's a keeper.",1036195200,,810,4.75177304964539

There was a hidden clause in his contract that he had to marry by a certain time or he would lose all his magic powers. So, he goes back home to date and helps straighten his son out who was on the naughty list. While away, Santa's lead elves make a clone of Santa so the other elves won't worry about Santa being away. The fake Santa is pretty funny as he learns the enjoyment of cocoa among other things. Then he gets completely out-of-hand and goes on a power trip. The tooth fairy even plays a part in this film. So Santa HAS to get married. Fast. Will he do it? This is the type of film that helps people better appreciate the holiday season.

It's just a great place to go for a couple of hours to let the rest of the world go by, and be a kid again. If you are a Tim Allen fan you will want to add this movie to your list.

1473621,3,B00005JLQ8,"This movie would've been perfect had there been more Elizabeth Mitchell, NOT plastic Toy Santa! In fact, what made the original film so cool was not the stuff at the North Pole, but the story about Scott Calvin becoming Santa and how it affects his family and daily life, often in a comical but grounded way.
Elizabeth Mitchell, while beautiful, was perfect in her role as the future Mrs. Clause/principle. I especially loved the scenes at the staff Christmas Party. I absolutely loathed the scenes with Toy Santa at the North Pole. If they wanted to put more drama or have a bad guy in the film, they could've just had someone else also vying for Carol's hand in marriage. Is it possible to love and hate a movie this much? I still have it in my collection tho, but mainly because of Elizabeth Mitchell. The third movie is an absolute turd that should never have been written!",1424995200,,877,4.556962025316456

The first one was more geared toward adults as well as young people, almost more realistic despite the fairytale aspects. This one is more colorful, more childlike but still very enjoyable. It is cute and sweet and very comical, especially the military Santa and Curtis, the elf. It has some cheesy gags as expected and the reindeer voices are incredibly annoying but I really enjoy it overall. The teacher's Christmas party scene is very touching and my favorite.

During the holiday season, I always watching every single Christmas movie that I can get my hands on- even the terrible ABC Family made-for-TV movies off of Netflix.  Since I love the original Santa Clause movie, I decided to try this.  This film is ridiculous on so many levels.  All of the adorable magic and wit that made the first film is completely lacking in this one.  There's a terrible case of insta-love between Tim Allen's character and his son's principal, and a ridiculous showdown at the end of the film with a robot Santa Claus that made me desperately wish I was watching anything BUT this movie.  The only reason I finished it is because I paid to rent it.  Please don't waste your time or money on this one.",1422144000,,815,4.422818791946309

1473719,5,B00005JLQ8,"This is a very good sequel to the Christmas classic, ""The Santa Clause"".  I must say that I like the first one a little better but, for a sequel, it is very good indeed.

  And a lot of fun.  I am a pushover for Santa Claus, North Pole, & elves movies -- and this one is at the top of the list.  This one sees the continuation of the story -- Scott Calvin was more or less tricked into becoming Santa last year, but now he loves the job and would not care to give it up.  So it is a real problem when it is discovered that he has to get married.  He has no prospects and only has until Christmas to pull it off.
  Once again there are a lot of subplots going on here:  his son Charlie is having some problems, there's the matter of replacing Santa while he's out looking for a wife, and a few others.

  Once again too, the movie tries to bridge the gap between the small fry who love Santa and those of us who, being older, kinda like that too, but it is nice to throw something a little more mature into the mix.  The sequel does that very nicely.

  A very good followup to a Christmas classic and one I enjoy every year.",1421625600,,1124,3.9641255605381165

Watch both sometime during the two weeks before Xmas, along with whichever other Holiday-season flicks you also rotate into your schedule, and you'll probably find yourself smiling nicely -- as it should be! (IMO)",1404518400,,416,4.942857142857143

Then, again, David Krumholtz's performance as Bernard seemed far too campy for what he had established in the first film.  He also didn't seem to be as authoritative in this one, despite being the Head Elf.  The thing that really made this movie for me was Elizabeth Mitchell as Carol.",1392508800,,413,4.616438356164384

1474728,5,B00005JLQ8,"This movie fulfilled our expectations as a sequel for the original ""Santa Claus-e""  A bit of a pun with the sub-title ""The Mrs. Clause"" carries the theme of the movie.  I think this sequel is well done and carries the overall concept of the initial movie in another, possibly unexpected, direction.

1474731,4,B00005JLQ8,"I picked up the triilogy of ""The Santa Clause"" movies on Amazon streaming to round out our Christmas movie collection.  We had them on DVD, but with kids in the house, keeping track of DVD's and keeping them from getting scratched, damaged, or lost is a pain.  Hence my move toward the cloud!  If you haven't seen them, start with the first as it is by far the best of the three.  It's about, you guessed it, Santa Clause and how one fluke encounter starts a divorced dad's journey to become the jolly old elf.

The second movie ""The Santa Clause 2"" centers around a previously unrevealed clause which states that within a year of becoming the big man, Santa needs to find a wife.  Can you guess what this clause is called??  Yup, the Mrs. Clause... ha.  This flick focuses on the adventures of Scott Calvin as he heads home to try to find a wife and bounces back to the North Pole as things start to fall apart without Santa's presence at the helm.  If you have small children, they will almost certainly get much more entertainment out of this than you will.

The first movie stands on it's own and could have stopped right there and been great.  This, second attempt to drink at the well doesn't have quite the charm of the first but it's not too terrible.  The third, rent first before you buy.",1387497600,,1298,4.384937238493724

1475048,2,B00005JLQ8,"I went to see this when it first came out in theaters. I am still disgusted at how babyish they made Bernard. What happened to the witty, sarcastic Head Elf we all loved in the first one? Now he acts like he downshifted to a child's mindset or something. When things went awry at the North Pole, the Bernard from the first movie would have laid that plan to waste in no time. Actually, he wouldn't have let it get that far to begin with. And I'm pretty sure the other elves would have been intelligent and strong enough to handle the fact that Santa had to find a bride (which, really, should have been taken care of years prior). They seemed to do okay when Scott first showed up as the new Santa in the first movie, so I'm sure they would have been FINE with knowing that Scott had to be on hiatus to find a bride - and Bernard would have done his duties as Head Elf, just like in the first movie.

Add to that the sub-par acting and general dumbing down (not to mention the absence of that familiar Christmas ""warmth"" that permeates the first one), and you've got a real stinker. I'm sure the kids may enjoy it, since the actors seem to be catering to a child's mindset, but I wouldn't recommend this to adults or even as a family movie night.",1354492800,,1246,4.2133891213389125

all I remember is that it was extremely painful and embarrassing to watch. The effects were really bad.. (okay so there were some less-than-perfect ones in the first one, but they were good enough to serve their purpose) Even the acting was terrible. The first movie was aimed for an audience of all ages, but in the second one I felt like everyone was acting for an audience of toddlers, or acting half-heartedly against their will while waiting to get paid. (Maybe it was partly the writing.. I'm not sure who to blame, really, but something is definitely wrong.)
The story was.. weird. Which could have been just fine if everything else hadn't sucked. I can barely even remember what happens, except it involves a lot of freaky Santa clones.
There was no warm fuzzy Christmasiness, either. It was sort of cold and nasty, really. It didn't feel like a Christmas movie at all.",1291334400,,1026,4.705555555555556

1475160,1,B00005JLQ8,"Wow. This movie was a mistake.

The first movie in this series was a completely hilarious film with charm, wit, realism combined with magic, and a healthy dose of sarcasm. Unfortunately, almost all of this was stripped away for the second film.

Where the first one was strong, this sequel failed to meet every standard the first movie set up. The art direction in this film was absolutely abhorrent in comparison to the first one. In the first film, it felt nostalgic and classic and not in-your-face bright. That was the stuff that gave the first film the sense that this was real and not a sound stage.

This second film strays further than anything from the original. Bright primary colors and obvious indoor shootings of outdoor sequences killed the whole joy and wonder, whatever was left in this dead story.

The thing was that it didn't need any more. The first movie was perfect, with great transitioning, song selection, and flow throughout. Most of all, the first movie was hilarious (every year I watch it, I get a joke that I didn't a year before). This film features slapstick comedy and butt jokes. Nothing witty, no sarcastic comments from Scott to Neal (what's The Santa Clause without those?), and absolutely nothing clever or creative. Add in a completely different personality for a CGI Comet, and you've got the extent of the humor in this dreadful sequel.

I don't want to go into the story--this review would become so long that no human being would endeavor to read it. Just know that this film is not meant for human consumption.

Merry Christmas. Know that it will be merrier without watching this ""film"" (I use that term lightly).

Things are not going so good at the North Pole though. The toy Santa is taking over and saying that no boy or girl has been good enough for presents that year.

Visual effects are great but when it detracts from the message of the over all movie it is just plain silly.  However, the scene where they give the teachers all there old favorite games and things it was really fun, those are what make movies a little more magical is to do unexspected things without the hyperness.

1475400,4,B00005JLQ8,"(3 1/2 *'s) The second of Tim Allen's `Santa Clause' series, we find a holiday film that is brisker, sweeter, and more eventful than its predecessor.  Between Director Michael Lembeck's laudable ability to keep the story at a proper pace, this yuletide misadventure flies with greater trajectory and a more cohesive sense of purpose.  Despite the TV nature of the comedy, five screenwriters bring real heart and humor to the hearth in a venue that brings some hearty ""Ho, Ho, Ho's"" to one's belly as well as some tears to  one's eyes.  Sweet enough to move with enough real life resonance to prevent it from being a hollow confection, `Santa Clause 2' really delivers.

This time Scott Calvin (Allen) has settled in at the Santa helm only to find the finer print of his business card contract requires him to have a ""Mrs. Claus(e)"" by Christmas Eve.  To deliver, he must deliver...In the meantime, he discovers his resentful son, Charlie (Eric Lloyd) has gotten himself on the naughty list.  Returning to his original southern latitude, he tries to get quality time with his son and find a suitor who will keep him suited.  If this weren't enough, he has to cheer up a jaded principal, Carol Newman (Elizabeth Mitchell) and rekindle the Christmas spirit at Charlie`s school. To keep the North Pole in order, Chief Elf Bernard (David Krumholtz) and his first mate, Curtis resort to ingenuity by cloning Santa with wickedly mutant results.  Will Santa deliver the toys on time for Christmas Eve and win on all fronts?  'Santa Clause 2' charmed me with its resolutions.

While it is descriptions of this movie series that has kept me away so long, it is the execution with the aforementioned use of the writers' wit and the director's wisdom that makes this movie higher on my holiday ""favorites"" list.",1197676800,,1799,4.808441558441558

Add to that his son Charlie is having issues with the lack of Christmas Spirit from the school principal.  And how can Santa leave the North Pole with only 3 weeks before Christmas.  So comes a duplicate Santa that turns evil as time goes on.  So poor Scott/Santa, so much to deal with and so little time to work through it all.

Unfortunately, this Christmas Scott's hit a couple snags.  First, his son Charlie (Eric Lloyd) is acting up.  In fact, after he's caught spray painting the school, he winds up on Santa's naughty list.

Even more pressing, elf Curtis (Spencer Breslin) has discovered another clause.  It seems Santa needs a Mrs. Claus or he will stop being Santa.  In fact, he's already loosing weight and returning to his original form.  If he isn't married by Christmas, he'll cease being Santa forever.

Naturally, the month before Christmas is the busiest time of the year for Santa and the elves.  So he leaves behind a robot duplicate of himself and heads to his ex-wife's house.  He hopes to reconnect with Charlie and find someone willing to marry him.  So why is the first person to catch his eye the Christmas hating principal of Charlie's school (Elizabeth Mitchell)?  Will it work, or is Scott doomed to cease being Santa forever?

The first movie is one of my favorite Christmas films.  In fact, I watch it every year.  While this sequel doesn't capture all the charm of the original, this is still a fun movie.  It's nice seeing the entire cast of the first movie back, and they do a good job.  The climax is funny and sweet.  And the special effects are wonderful.

1475506,5,B00005JLQ8,"Eight years ago, strange circumstances and a legal clause resulted in single father Scott Calvin becoming the world's new Santa Claus. Since then, he has proven himself to be the best man for the job. Everyone, from kids to elves, absolutely loves him! Unfortunately, Curtis, the number-two elf and keeper of the Elf Handbook, managed to overlook a second, VERY important clause. In order to remain Santa, Scott Calvin has to satisfy The Mrs. Clause. That is to say, Scott has to find a wife if he wants to keep being the man in the red suit, and he's only got until midnight on Christmas Eve to do it! With only 28 days to find Miss Right and Scott ""desantafying"" a little more all the time, he and Bernard, the number-one elf, agree to use Curtis's plan to install a living, life-size toy Santa in Scott's place to keep the elves from worrying. With that problem solved, Scott climbs aboard faithful reindeer Comet and flies to his former hometown to try and settle two problems at the same time. He not only has to find himself a wife, he also has to deal with his teenage son, Charlie, whose acting out in the form of graffiti on his school's campus has landed him on the naughty list!

As Scott, gradually transforming back into his pre-Santa self (in other words, looking more and more like actor-comedian Tim Allen), goes out on blind-dates arranged by his ex-wife and verbally duels with Charlie and attractive Principal Carol Newman, the replacement Santa is going on a power trip at the North Pole, eventually turning the happy village of elves into a police state with the help of his army of giant toy soldiers. When Scott finally shows principal Newman how good he can be with children, he impresses her enough to land a first date that proves to be a very charming and magical evening. However, the situation at the North Pole and the approaching Christmas Eve deadline are not giving Scott a lot of time for solidifying a relationship. There's still the whole ""I'm Santa Claus"" issue to deal with, and it doesn't help that Principal Newman has issues with Christmas. Scott also still has to work out things with his troubled son. Meanwhile, Charlie's little sister is getting suspicious of her visiting ""Uncle"" Scott's true identity. After all, he came into town on a reindeer! Everything comes to a head on Christmas Eve, when Curtis shows up at the door in a desperate effort to bring Santa home to defeat the toy Santa-clone and save Christmas! But, there's still a little matter of an unconfirmed wedding to deal with  too! Can Scott Calvin, AKA Santa Claus, manage it all in time?!!!

Comedian Tim Allen returns to the North Pole a second time to give us ""Santa Clause 2: The Mrs. Clause,"" and it's every bit as enjoyable as Disney's first hit Santa Clause film! Don't be put off by the submarine film spoof in the beginning. Once this movie gets going, it's a magical sleigh ride from start to finish. The stuff at the North Pole is funny, cute, and extra saccharine for the kiddies, but the real high points come on Scott's dating adventures. His doomed blind-date with Saturday Night Live alumnus Molly Shannon is hilarious, and his enchanting evening with Carol is a Christmas card come to life! The kids in the cast strut some fantastic talent, but the adults win the laughs with Judge Reinhold back as Neil, Art LaFleur onboard as the Tooth Fairy (along with a slew of other stars as enjoyable fantasy icons), Elizabeth Mitchell as the lovely Principal Carol Newman, David Krumholtz returning as Bernard the Head-Elf, and Tim Allen in the double role of Scott ""Santa"" Calvin and the delightfully rotten toy Santa-Clone. Director Michael Lembeck does an awesome job of creating a sequel that stands on its own ground while staying true to the original. It's a Christmas movie, so you know there'll be great music and plenty of holiday eye-candy! The DVD comes with its share of holiday gifts too. There are deleted scenes, a gag reel, a game, some fun behind the scenes featurettes, and a kid-friendly desire throughout the disc to ""keep the illusion alive."" In fact, that last aspect makes the director's commentary a real trip! If you're looking for a new Christmas classic to add to your DVD collection, look no further than ""Santa Clause 2: The Mrs. Clause!""",1137283200,3,4287,4.7057256990679095

1475608,4,B00005JLQ8,"Now, I'm a full blooded Christmas fan (my birthday is Dec. 20th) So I know first hand what I like to see in a X-mas movie. The first Santa Clause was wonderfully charming, the elves were cute and held a certain air about them that screamed ""Holidays!! Whoo!..Now get back to work!!"" and I simply adored Tim Allen as Santa Clause he gave a fun air to the film that made me rush out and buy it asap.
So of course many ayear later when I heard about a 2nd one you can bet your bottom dollar I was that teenager in the front row giggling at Clone-clause, as soon as the movie started
I found myself amused (well...most of the time.) by the movie.
It had funny and touching moments, it had a few good new characters. I.e. the tooth fairy, Father time, mother nature and clone-clause. And a few not so good ones. I.e. Cupit, Cutis, the easter bunny, Comet...
But what I found myself most disapointed in was the old characters themselfs!! They seem've changed so much within what ohh, 6-8 years? Charlie was a reble? Laura and Neil were bland worring parents and the elves?!
Oh god don't get me started on the elves! I missed Judy! and the old costumes and set and I hated Curtis' mood swings!
As for Bernard? where did my gruff, protective big brother elf go? Now he's winny, pensive and unsure of hiself? Come on!
Now...I understand that David K. (Bernard) Was only 16 when he played the role in the first movie and that he was 24 in the 2nd but come on!! Why did the director have them change so much? Oooohh yeah a little birdy told me about him (Check out interviews with him on google for yourselfs) and that birdy told me he had a meeting with Tim Allen and had him change the other actors view points on their characters, you know, make them a little disney-er? Not sure if its true, watch the DVD for yourselfs and tell me if you like him on the set I sure didn't.
Over all:
I WAS disapointed in the 2nd movie, I held more hope that the characters and movie world/set would stay the same but it didn't, and I was highly upset by the new Comet, but over all. If your a fan of the first, check out the 2nd and see for yourselfs. As for me? I hold hope tight in my heart that the third and forth will be golden, after all, its the same crew/director that did the first and I'm hoping that somewhere out there Tim Allen and David K. along with the rest of the crew will find it in their hearts to dig out the old Santa Clause characters they played in the first one.
For I sure do miss em.

1475677,2,B00005JLQ8,"In Brief
8 years ago Scott Calvin became Santa Clause due to a clause in the contract that he discovered on the previous Santa who fell from his roof.  Since then he has enjoyed bringing joy to the world, but life is tough when he has a son and broken marriage back in the States.  Now a new clause has been found in the small print of the contract card: he has to find a Mrs Clause to marry by Christmas Eve or else he will no longer be Santa.  With this weight on his shoulders he returns home to sort out the problems with his troubled son leaving a toy Santa in his place who is a stickler for the rules and decides that maybe not that many children in the world have been good after all!  Chaos ensues, will Santa find his wife, will he sort out the mess at the North Pole, and will he sort out his son, all before Christmas Eve is over!!!
Review
The Santa Clause was in my mind the definitive Santa movie, it appealed to both adults and kids alike and didn't have Dudley Moore in it nor was it so overfilled with sugary sweetness that I wanted to puke.  Well may he rest in peace but thankfully Moore isn't in this film, so the alcohol content may be low but the sugar content is definitely high.  So high in fact that a warning should be placed on the poster ""This film is rated U and may contain some scenes that could cause tooth decay in viewers of a sensitive nature.""
As a rule of thumb, Hollywood film-makers see a sequel and either add kids or animals to the mix, don't believe me check out Robocop 3 or Mad Max 3 to name two.  The Santa Clause 2 has elves, who are either sleeping in the summer or are very busy at Christmas so are conveniently played here by children for the sake of the film.  However this is not a bad movie, my rating of two stars acts as a guide to those that remembered the first film when the were young and thought they might get in the Christmas spirit and see the second, don't!  Watch the first on TV and save some money, however if you do have kids or want to borrow a neighbours so you can see it anyway you can double the rating to four stars as any child under 10 will love it.
Tim Allen is always a pleasure to see, and the movie from an adult's perspective takes a good 20 minutes to kick in, as he then returns to his former state, Scott Calvin leaving behind a dictator Toy Santa (Allen in toy makeup and full Buzz Lightyear mode) to hold the North Pole fort.  Out of the main role of the main man, Allen excels and the humour from an adult perspective is apparent and funny, while the romance shared between Calvin and Carol (Mitchell) is genuine and touching.
The Verdict
All in all, this piece of Christmas cheer is well worth the effort if you have children that you'd like to take.  Its inoffensive and joyous and from that perspective is a rare treat at the cinema today, but it has little to offer anyone in their teens or older, which is a shame as based on the first film that's an opportunity that has been missed.",1073433600,2,2975,4.147569444444445

1475679,2,B00005JLQ8,"This is a children's movie, that, unfortunately, fails to entertain adults.  Tim Allen does a very good job as Santa Claus, however, it is the writing that disapoints.
The opening of the movie fails to grab you and make you want more.  The movie starts off extremely slow.  There is a little tension as Santa must find a wife by Christmas, but the story from that point on is highly predictable.  The viewer knows the first woman he meets will not work out.  If she did, then what would they do for the remainder of the movie.  The next woman Santa meets is the most unlikely choice, therefore, it is the one that works out.  Again, highly predictable writing.  The ending is forced.  It is as if the writers ran out of time and just slapped an ending on the movie.

1475681,4,B00005JLQ8,"I don't know why Amazon as this movie listied as The Santa Clause 2 - The Mrs. Clause, when the title is just The Santa Clause 2. Disney brought this movie out last year when the first Santa Clause movie (with Tim Allen) came out in 1994. I don't know when this is taking place, but I have heard that the movie begins 8 years after the orginal movie took place. The movie does not say when it it is taking place, but I do know that is take place, at least 8 years after the orginal, since Charlie (Scott's son) was a little boy, when his dad became Santa Clause, when the old one fell off his roof, and now he is a teenager. This is a rare live action movie with a G rating. And usually live action movies, would have a higher rating like PG, or even higher. As the movie opens, Scott (Tim Allen) has been Santa Clause for some years now, and now even more children believe in Santa Clause, since Scott took the job. But there are stuff that is going on, that Scott doesn't know. And that head elf Bernard (David Krumholtz) has been bugging Curtis (Spencer Breslin) about breaking some bad news to Santa Clause. And when Curtis asks Bernard, why he does he have to do it, Bernard explains to Curtis that he is the head elf, and it is not his job to give bad news to Santa. Santa's son Charlie (Eric Lloyd) who is know a teenager, has landed him on ""this year's naughty list"". And it gets even worser when Curtis and Bernard tell Santa shows Santa that on the card, some information that was missed. And that is that he needs a Mrs. Clause. And he has until Christmas Eve to find a wife. And the process begins, that he will start to lose his stomach, and white hair, and then it will contiune on until he can't be Santa any more. And that he has to go back to earth, to help his son, and maybe to find a new wife. Then Curtis comes up with the idea of cloning Santa, and have a look a like, stay at the north pole, and does Santa's duties, while Scott Calven returns to Earth, to find out what is going on with his son, Bernard is against, but Scott is cloed, and Scott asks Bernard to lie to the elfs, that he has changed his appearance. Even though, how much Bernard hates the idea, he does it any way. When Scott returns to earth, he learns that Charlie has done graftti all over his school, and is even facing susupention. And has to attend a meeting wit his ex-wife Laura (Wendy Crewson), Neil (Judge Reinhold), Charlie, and his son's principal Carol Newman (Elizabeth Mitchell). It may be a good idea, to see the first movie, before this one, to find out how Scott got the job as Santa in the first place, before you see this one. The movie reunites most of the cast from the Santa Clause, all the elves in the first one, are not back, and there newcomers like Curtis, Carol and Charlie's baby relative Lucy (Liliana Mumy)",1072137600,,2828,4.209944751381215

Scott wants to address his son's problems immediately with Christmas approaching; therefore, he leaves the North Pole in the hands of a toy replica Santa who runs the North Pole like a Russian dictator soldiers (toy, of course) and all.

Incredibly stupid and transparent plot that seemed, at best, forced and, at worst, grating and painfully obvious. This movie features one of the least interesting, and most unrelated-to-the-rest-of-the-film opening sequences I have ever seen. It doesn't even really function as character introduction tool. It is so un-engaging, it REALLY IS amazing.
Again, in short: There is NOT A SINGLE REDEEMING QUALITY TO THIS FILM AT ALL.
Why on earth did Tim Allen agree to make this horrible movie? Was it contractual? It must have been. I enjoyed the first movie, in a light fluffy holiday movie kinda way, but this sequel is too bad to be believed.",1071532800,5,1145,4.907216494845361

People do not take them for what they are.  This movie was made to entertain and put smiles on kids faces.  Did it do that?  I certainly think so.  SO what if the plot was a little off or that there were now three different story lines. Can't keep up?  It wasn't that hard or disruptive to the film.  Or that Charlie's behavior was a bit silly and quickly taken care of.... give me a break.  Take the film for what it was trying to accomplish (good simple holiday giggles), not for living in the shadow of the first.  Come on people this is not rocket science.  It was just a goofy Christmas film to keep the kids happy while you try to eat dinner in peace.  I thought it was adorable!",1071100800,4,853,4.072289156626506

This is really worth watching,I don't know which Santa Clause is better, but this one is a must seen Christmas movie.*****",1070496000,,243,4.545454545454546
1475766,2,B00005JLQ8,"Any film that regards The Toothfairy as The Moleinator is in serious trouble. But that's not the only problem with ""The Santa Clause 2"" -- the problem is its lack of freshness and enjoyability. The first film was a real Christmas treat; funny, ocassionally rather surprisingly witty, and always with a tender side and a refreshing Holiday spirit.
The second vehicle -- though filmed eight years apart from the first -- seems like a cash-in, and nothing more. Santa (Tim Allen), a.k.a. Scott Calvin (look at the initials), is as happy as can be. He's been Santa Claus for the past eight years, and the children have been happier since he became Santa. (Who takes these polls?) But as Christmas draws closer, Scott realizes that not only is his son, Charlie, on the Naughty List, there's a second clause in the contract that states he must become married to ""The Mrs. Claus"" in 27 days, or he'll be history.
The head elf, Bernard, along with the help of another fellow elf (Specer Breslin, ""The Cat in the Hat""), duplicates a fake Santa to watch over things as the real Scott goes home to tend to family matters. But the new Santa Claus is an evil dictator who comes to work in Hitler's outfit and demands that all children be given coal. It's the funniest part of the movie, apart from when Evil Santa says to Good Santa, ""You are a sad, strange little man,"" which is of course a little Disney in-joke. (Tim is mimicking his own Buzz Lightyear character from Disney/Pixar's ""Toy Story."")
""The Santa Clause 2"" got a lot of good reviews that called it an enjoyable and charming little movie, but I missed something. The first film was something both kids and adults alike could equally enjoy. Allen was funnier, the film was funnier, and it was much more charming than this. And for a film made eight years earlier, its special effects are superior. (At the end of ""2,"" Scott hangs off the back of Evil Santa's flying sleigh and...it simply has to be seen to be appalled by.)
There's a major plot hole in the entire idea of Santa Claus existing in our world that need not be pointed out by me -- and I won't, in case there are children reading this. But whereas the first film had fun with the notion of Santa Claus being real, ""The Santa Clause 2"" bashes it all over the head. Charlie cries at one point because his dad has ""the best job in the world"" but he is unable to tell all his friends. Boo-hoo. The thing is, ""The Santa Clause 2"" takes the idea of Santa Claus too far. It's not fun anymore. Just watch the first -- and far superior -- film instead.
Another thing: The first film seemed very down to earth, very simple and fun. This movie is all over the place. A television show director made ""The Santa Clause 2,"" and it's very evident that this is so. The movie is too sporadically daffy and serious and not at all inspired. I still remember seeing the first film and being delighted by its sheer heart. This movie doesn't really have one.
I like Tim Allen's dry ironic humor because I think he knows how to make good use of it. He used it to perfection in ""Home Improvement,"" used it even better in ""The Santa Clause,"" voiced the witty Buzz Lightyears, and then appeared in a string of flops, including ""Big Trouble"" and ""Who is Cletis Tout?"" Here's to ""Toy Story 3"" -- if Pixar ever manages to break away from Disney and its stupid no-more-sequels contract.",1070496000,7,3367,4.476422764227642
1475767,4,B00005JLQ8,"I was disappointed by this movie.. The first one was, to me, so magical and enchanting - while this one seemed to fall short.  It wasn't a BAD movie, it just wasn't what I was expecting after the first one.
The basic plot is that Santa (Tim Allen) finds out 28 days before Christmas that he must find a wife (which is called the Mrs. Clause) before Christmas or else he cannot be Santa any longer.  Since he needs to be finding a wife and at the North Pole supervising toy making, some of his elves make a toy clone version of him to stay at the North Pole.  He goes down to the town his son lives in to find a wife, and immediately latches on to the son's super hot principal.  The rest I won't ruin for those who want to see it.
Ok... I really liked the crazy clone Santa plotline - I thought it was hilarious.  It might be a little too scary for extremely young kids (especially since he wears a Saddam Hussein like outfit), but I think most will be able to handle it with no problems.
I could not STAND the reindeer.  The animatronics were horrible and the reindeer itself was just annoying (and I really hate when a movie with so much promise stoops to fart jokes).  If they had left that entire part out of the movie, I think it would have been much better.
Overall, the story is cute.  I liked it - its worth renting around Christmas time with the family.  It doesn't hold a candle to the original Santa Clause, in typical sequel fashion.  I recommend it - just don't go in expecting to see the Santa Clause all over again!",1070409600,3,1530,4.191126279863481
1475768,5,B00005JLQ8,"The Santa Clause (1994) was an incredible movie for the entire family.  It made you cry, laugh, and most importantly believe again.  I was somewhat worried to find out there would be a sequel to one of my all time favorite Christmas movies.  I figured there was no way to meet the standards The Santa Clause had set forth.  I happily discovered I was quite mistaken.
 Both The Santa Clause and The Santa Clause 2 presented Scott Calvin (a.k.a Santa Claus) with some hefty, real life problems.  In the sequel, Calvin is introduced to such issues as marriage and the juvenile delinquency of his only son. However, the overall tone of it remained light and happy, whereas the first movie's issues brought about sadness and pity.
 Who would have known a man as powerful as Santa could lose his magic?  Returning home to help his needy son also meant Santa's magic was not of an unlimited supply.  Santa is unable to return to the North Pole if his magic has run out.  What is a man to do when he is unable to use all his power to save his loved ones and himself?
 Upon watching this film you will definately realize Santa is not the only mythical leading (wo)man with problems!  Helping out with the joyous tone of the movie were an array of silly characters, such as Chet the trainee reindeer and the toy Santa, who overtook the North Pole with his Nazi-like rules. The movie also introduced some childhood fantasy characters such as the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny. I could relate more to this movie with the presence of charcters from my own childhood.
 Not only did this movie leave me with a tummy ache from all the laughter, and a warm heart, but it also reinstated my belief in fairytales.  ""Seeing isn't believing.  Believing is seeing""",1070323200,2,1745,4.548076923076923

In trying to analyze what I didn't like about this flick, I decided I thought the script was rather poorly written, cutesy and lacked the spontaneity of the first film. Also too many sappy scenes at the north pole, and way too many elves! And WHAT is up with the low budget reindeer? Ick.
I also wanted to see more of Judge, whose therapist character is rather funny. However, he kept getting interrupted by the Tim's character which was just annoying. I also felt the main character's son's delinquacy was rather out of character and not fully explored.
Small children might enjoy this film entertaining, but I thought it was just plain silly. This film would be vastly improved by a better script, and less reliance on flashy CGI, and of course, more Judge.",1070236800,3,876,4.621794871794871
1475771,1,B00005JLQ8,"First, before any of you start throwing stones, let me just say that I thought The Santa Clause was a wonderful movie and it remains to this day one of our family holiday, (and throughout the year, actually) favorites. It was fresh and original and FUNNY! This sequel, was far inferior to it's predecessor in many ways. I agree with one of the other reviewers that Tim Allen seemed rather uncomfortable or stiff in his portrayal of Santa Claus this time around. The storyline wasn't believable in the slightest. Charlie has turned from sweet inventor of the CD (cocoa/cookie dispenser) to a sullen, graffitti spraying punk. All of a sudden, many years after Santa has been on the job at the North Pole, NOW he has to marry within a matter of a few weeks so that he can continue ""being"" Santa. Why now? What happened? The lady who is to become Mrs. Claus, Principal Newman, isn't believable in any realm when she suddenly changes her tone from stern disciplinarian to syrupy over-sweetened Mrs. Claus. Comet was EXTREMELY irritating and even frightening to my 1 and 1/2 year old baby. He cried! The only bright spot in this film was the young fellow who portrayed the little elf Marcus. He is not only adorable, but quite professional and believable. The few times I chuckled was when he was stealing each scene he was a part of. Now I realize this ""review"" may sound a bit harsh, but if you value your time, as I do, and would rather not waste any of it then I wouldn't purchase this dvd. I would suggest as an alternative enhancing your holiday dvd library by purchasing ""poetry on film"" such as It's a Wonderful Life, The Homecoming, A Christmas Carol with Alistair Sim, or The House Without a Christmas Tree, to name a few. Share the classics with your kids and not this meaningless fluff which has no redeeming value whatsoever.",1069718400,3,1832,4.605504587155964
1475772,3,B00005JLQ8,"Though I enjoyed watching this one too. I found it to be more for the kids this time. The first Santa Clause had more for the entire family, young and old alike.

1475773,4,B00005JLQ8,"Tim Allen is back as Santa in this Sequel to The Santa Clause.  This time, Santa finds out that he has to get married by Christmas Eve or give up being Santa forever.
Complicating matters is his son Charlie is now on the ""naughty"" list and Santa has to go home and find out what's going on.  To keep things running at the North Pole, #2 Elf Curtis creates a phony toy Santa.  Unfortunately the Toy Santa is straight out of the ""Terminator"" and has his own ideas about how Christmas should be.
All of the original cast members are back for the sequel, adding Elizabeth mitchell as Charlie's principal and possibly the future Mrs. Clause.
Some very funny moments, much like the first along with some genuine holiday warmth.  Some decent special effects too.  The Santa Clause movies have one of the best looking North Poles seen in any holiday movie.
The extras on the disc are a bit disappointing.  Disney did not advertise it as a special edition and that's good.  You get commentary by the director Michael Lemback along with deleted scenes.  There's a few very short featurettes which are only about 3 - 5 minutes in length.  There's also some DVD-Rom games you can play.
It would have been nice to get more out of this but I guess a Christmas movie sells itself.  i give it a 4 for the movie and a 2 for the extras.",1069632000,2,1318,4.409090909090909
1475774,3,B00005JLQ8,"I honestly had pretty low expectations of Santa Clause 2. The first film was utterly charming and the law of diminishing returns usually applies to sequels. I was very pleasnatly surprised to find that Santa Clause 2, while not quite as inventive as the first film, was a fun and charming movie. There's a number of sequences that rank up there with the first movie and, although the film feels a bit rushed towards the end (we only see one blind date in the movie but, heck with Molly Shannon from SNL, it's a great little scene).
It seems that Scott Calvin aka Santa missed another little bit of fine print in the Santa contract. He has to find a Mrs. Clause or he'll no longer be Santa. To prevent the elves from panicing while he's gone, one of the other elves comes up with a machine that can create a duplicate full size ""toy"" Santa. With the temporary Santa in place, Scott begins to see the effects of his desantafying, in other words, he returns to looking like Scott Calvin. There's another problem awaiting Scott when he returns home--his son Charlie has been ""tagging"" (i.e. painting graffiti) the high school he's going to and has been caught his his principle Carol(Elizabeth Mitchell).
Scott returns home and ends up staying with his ex-wife and her husband (the clueless and marvelous Judge Reinhold). Scott's ex sets him up on a number of blind dates (as mentioned before we only see one but it is quite funny). When Charlie gets caught tagging again at the school, Scott negoiates detention vs. having his son expelled but there's a catch--Scott has to help Charlie serve detention. Scott suddenly notices a romantic spark between he and Carol. When Scott decides to woo her the film has some of its most effecting moments.
Back at the North Pole the Toy Santa has gone bananas--after reviewing the rule book, he decides that every child in the world deserves a lump of coal. He also decides to retool the toy factory into a coal factory. Now Scott has to save his position as Santa and Christmas.
Tim Allen is marvelous as both Scott Calvin, Santa and the Toy Santa. His natural comedic flair and timing help make the tone of the film (which veers from comedy to a number of touching moments) work. Elizabeth Mitchell also gives a nicely nuanced performance as Carol. Despite her beauty, she's believable as the drill disciplinarian princple and Scott's love interest. I was really surprised to see the young actor who played Charlie in the first movie in this one as well. Unlike a lot of child actors, he's managed to retain many of the qualities that made him so effective in the role in the first place. Although Judge Reinhold has made a number of stinker movies over the past decade, it doesn't detract from his ability to light up the screen. He's a natural, goofy comic presence.
The DVD comes with a number of deleted scenes and it's pretty clear why they were deleted. Still, the scene between Mother Nature and Father Time would have been great in the movie. The cameos include appearences by Michael Dorn (Worf from Star Trek) as the Sandman, Peter Boyle as Father Time and Kevin Pollack as a love challenged Cupid.
The gag reel isn't quite as funny as I would have thought but there is a chuckle or two there. The True Confessions of The Legendary Figures features ""interviews"" with the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, Mother Nature and there's also Operation Toy BOx: Save Santa Set Top Game which I didn't have a chance to try.
DVD Rom features include Coloring Book Activity, a fairly lame Reindeer Games gameas well as two other games I didn't have the time to try.
The Santa Clause 2 is fun entertainment for the whole family. While it isn't quite as original as the first movie, there's still plenty of creative invention that keeps this film rolling along.",1069545600,,3790,4.649776453055142

1475864,5,B00005JLQ8,"""The Santa Clause"" is a holiday movie that my family has watched and loved multiple times every year. It really captured the spirit of the day in a way that EVERYONE can appreciate. ""The Santa Clause 2"" was something I didn't bother to see in theaters, because it's been my experience that Disney can't do sequels right. Based on past failures, this could have truly been a terrible film. Luckily, I heard from a friend who became absolutely obsessed with it and counted down the days to its DVD release. She said it was not only, in her opinion, slightly better than the first, but that it was a generally wonderful and very funny movie. Sufficiently persuaded to purchase the DVD, I now can honestly say that I'm glad I did.
In this movie, the entire original cast returns for a story that's actually quite clever for a ""part II."" Colorful and fun from beginning to end, the humor is genuine, and not the 'corny' kind you might expect. Actually, my favorite line is when the ""number two elf,"" Curtis, says, ""The Desantafication process has begun!"" He shouts it so loudly and rapidly it's scary--but mad humorous. If you don't already know the story, here it is in a nutshell: Scott needs a wife in order to remain Santa forever; the ""Mrs. Clause."" His son Charlie is falling into 'bad behavior' because he feels neglected and upset that he must keep his father's secret, when his dad's got the coolest job of all. While Scott is courting the school principal using magic, back at the North Pole, chaos is ensuing as the toy santa goes awry and develops a persona not unlike Hitler. He whips the elves into long, miserable work hours and is just basically cruel, screwing up the entire process of Christmas by deciding that most kids are naughty and they all deserve only coal.
The reindeer, Scott's ex-wife and Neil, the hilarious Council of Legendary Figures, etc., all combine to make a truly satisfying movie that is a very, very worthy successor to ""The Santa Clause."" I am pleased to say, a longtime fan of the original was not disappointed at all. (Warning: The most irritating character by far is Molly Shannon's small role of Tracy, Scott's first dismal attempt at finding a Mrs. Clause. Tracy has an unhealthy obsession with country music and bursts into a highly embarassing singing-and-dancing performance of a Shania Twain song with lyrics twisted to be about Christmas--UNDER THE WATCH OF EVERYONE IN A PUBLIC RESTAURANT WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OF THE START OF A FIRST DATE. Something's wrong with this woman. She's one of those, ""I-am-not-with-her, I've-never-seen-her-before-in-my-life"" kind of humilating freaks of nature whom you'd NEVER wanna be caught dead with in public. The scene is funny--still, I dunno about anyone else, but I felt really awful for Scott. I mean, he responded the way any normal red-blooded American would, and then Tracy storms out on him for not ""supporting her ambition"" when she ""put herself out there"" which she claims was ""not an easy thing to do."") Bernard has a big role, and is even more likable in this one; he doesn't like Curtis much, but he's used to having Scott as Santa. ""Chet"" is the new, inexperienced reindeer-in-training who is completely horrible at guiding a sleigh--or just flying, for that matter. The Tooth Fairy, who wants to change his name to Tooth Man, Tooth Guy, Molinator, Tooth, Plaque Man, Captain Floss, or as I recall, Roy, is hysterical. ""No kid will leave a tooth under their pillow for some guy named Roy,"" claims Cupid. Eh heh...it's probably true.
Also, BE SURE TO WATCH THE SPECIAL FEATURES!! They're excellent. The interview with the Legendary Figures is hilarious. Gotta love Cupid. ""Deleted scenes"" & ""gag reel"" are tons of fun. Watch the movie with the audio commentary from Micheal Lembeck as well as the hysterically funny ten-minute ""Exploring the North Pole w/ Curtis."" These are too much fun & they give greater insight into the rivalry betwixt Curtis and Bernard. Banana, anyone?!
So on the whole, it's a great film. For everybody. I'd see it if I were you. Terrific holiday movie. A new tradition will be watching the first followed by the second each year.",1069372800,3,4149,4.812324929971989

  When he is gone from the North Pole he leaves a big toy clone Santa of himself in charge. Tim Allen plays that clone Santa of course and steals the show as him. The real Santa is sweet and cuddly.

Anyway the toy Santa gets a mind of his own and takes over Santa's work-shop. He enlarges some toy soldiars and has them make the elves work on coal. He thinks all the kids deserve nothing but coal for Christmas.
  The movie is mostly warm and magical though. Tim Allen's scenes with Charlie's Principal who he falls for are sweet. The reindeers Comet and the your crazy reindeer in training are funny too.

1475868,4,B00005JLQ8,"Tim Allen returns to role that gave him his biggest box office success back in 1994. Good 'ol Saint Nick. Why did it take so long to get a sequel to the smash hit original made?. Well, Allen himself said they could never find the right storyline and that they wanted it to be perfect. It took 8 years to find the right story?. The plot of this movie pretty much sounds like the obvious storyline to do, so I'm surprised it took them almost a decade to realize it. Scott Calvin(Allen), has been Santa in the north pole for many years now and many believe that he has been the best Santa ever. The glimpses into the north pole and the Santa village and workshop are wonderful. This is what I have always imagined the place to look like. However, the place is located underground, and that's the first time I have seen them do that. Head elf Bernard(David Krumholtz), is back, and is followed around by the #2 elf, who is played by Spencer Breslin, who was seen in ""The Kid"", and the upcoming ""The Cat In The Hat"" movie. Santa gets his annual naughty and nice list and is shocked to see that his son, Charlie, is on the naughty list. But Bernard has bigger news. It is written in the clause agreement that made Scott Santa that he has to get married, get a Mrs. Clause, or he will be desantified. Will no longer be Santa. Ho no!. He travels back to town to catch up on what Charlie has been doing, being reunited with his ex-wife, and her horrible sweater wearing husband Neil, once again played by Judge Reinhold. As the desantification beings, and Scott begins to shrink his body weight and lose the beard, he gets involved with Charlie's ice princess principal, Principal Newman, played by the lovely Elizabeth Mitchell. He realizes that she may be the one he has been looking for, but has to get her to realize it before his time is up and he is no longer Santa. In the meantime, the north pole is being overrun by a replacement Santa who quickly becomes dictator-ish and causes chaos and mayhem. This sequel is sweet, warm, and fun. I can't say it is as good, or has the same kind of magical feel and quality to it as the wonderful original, but it comes close. Then again, what sequel really does?. It's good, clean family fun, and everyone should enjoy it. Tim Allen, not surprisingly, carries the film. There were moments and scenes with no real spark, but were made by his being there. His jokes and overall presence lift the film and make it what it is. Eric Lloyd returns as Charlie, and he isn't bad. Dealing with young teen angst and the big secret he has to carry about his father really weighs on him and he does a pretty good job of making it seem real. Nothing special, but he gets the job done. I would of liked more screen time for Reinhold, but what are you going to do?. What the film lacked was the awe and specialness of the original. The original just seemed natural as these magical things begin to happen and everyone has to deal with them. Since everything has been set for quite some time now in this film, the enchantment isn't the same. Don't get me wrong because it is still there, but it's not the same. SNL alum Molly Shannon delivers one of the best moments when she cameos as a potential love interest for Scott. She delivers a doozy of a Christmas tinged Shania Twain song and it's hilarious. Also, original cast member Peter Boyle, who played Scott's boss in the oringal, has an uncredited cameo here playing Father Time. So, in the end, what you get is a really fun, nice movie that gives sequels a pretty good name. There's no harm, no foul, but the first is still the best.",1069286400,,3610,4.373511904761905
1475869,2,B00005JLQ8,"Well, I have to preface this review by saying that The Santa Clause (I) might be my favorite movie EVER, and so of course I was expecting great things from the sequel. After seeing it in the theater I did feel that sense of early Christmas magic (didn't hurt that it was snowing out), but also an empty sense of yet another dissapointing sequel.
Sure, the kids will love this movie, that is if they aren't sCaRed by it. (Yes, evil-toy-come-to-life imitation Santa is one frightening dude.) But if you really want a movie that'll enrich the family Christmas spirit, go for the original. The Santa Clause II is simply TRYING TOO HARD--there are too many tangled plot lines that are supposed to be rather wry, but end up feeling cheezy and awkward. Yes, I mean the council of mythical beings, the whole ""Mrs. Clause"" idea, that gross farting reindeer, etc etc. Surely it still has moments of genuinely warm humor and Christmas cheer, but the magic is gone. Oy that sounds insincere, but I mean it.
The simple conflict of family tensions and believing in Santa has been resolved--so they desperately need new ones, but those that they have come up with simply don't feel right. Luckily, Eric Lloyd still plays Charlie, and he's wonderful and quite believable. (yes, he made me cry) And of course, Judge Reinhold as Neil, my favorite--still wearing those creepy sweaters. Actually, my REAL favorite is David Krumholtz as Bernard (!!), but unfortunatley Bernard is no where near as surly as he was in the last movie--he's become virtually without personality, only to be replaced by the annoyingly surly elf Curtis.
Ok, but I said that this movie was fun, right? Well, Tim Allen does prop up all of the extraneous plot lines and saggy jokes with his very funny but solidly likeable portayal of Santa-dad. And for some reason, it does invoke feelings of Christmas cheer. But after that some nausea. So I'd reccommend 1 over 2, unless you're a DIEHARD FAN like me...which is somewhat odd considering this is a xmas movie geared towards seven year olds!

While the banter between Scott and his ex-wife's husband Neil isn't nearly as plentiful as it was in the first movie, it's still hilarious when it happens. The toy Santa has some classic lines in the final confrontation with Scott (""Whoa, he's an action figure!""), and it's great to see Charlie and Bernard both returning for the second trip (you really don't realize how long it's been since the first one until you see how much Charlie's grown!). This is a ""G"" rated film, and I have to congratulate the guys on doing that. So few ""G"" rated movies come out anymore that it's a relief to see one that makes it and has a great star in it! I felt just a little cheated by the ending because there just seems like there should be an ""after Christmas"" scene to see how it all worked out, but I guess that leaves a little something for another sequel. You can tell everyone had a good time making the film, and I hated to see some of those deleted scenes taken out of the movie (Scott's blind dates were hilarious).

1475932,4,B00005JLQ8,"I confess that I never saw THE SANTA CLAUSE in its entirety, but I saw little bits of it. Tim Allen did a commendable job and the film was perfectly harmless for children. But if a children's movie doesn't entertain adults then it completely fails. It is in this important requirement that THE SANTA CLAUSE 2 succeeds. It is entertaining, good hearted, and has an impressive look to it.
That impressive look comes across in the opening sequence in the North Pole. Santa's workshop is bustling with elves. They are clearly played by children who wear makeup wisely limited to the ears. At the same time the place comes across like FAO Shwartz with a gigantic upgrade. The elves are making the toys that Santa must deliver when trouble starts. A surveillance plane is approaching their territory, and picking up the sounds coming from the workshop. Aanta turns to elves who monitor a security section like NORAD in WARGAMES. (They go to ""ElfCon 1"", a nice touch.) Eventually the crisis is abated, and it's back to business. Santa then conducts a meeting with all the other legendary figures: The Easter Bunny, The Tooth Fairy, Father Time, Cupid, and even The Sandman. When I saw who was cast in the role of Sandman I burst out laughing. (I wouldn't dream of revealing who it is. Some great jokes will come out of it.)
Everything seems wonderful, but Santa comes down with two major problems. His son Charlie from the real world is on the ""naughty"" list, and if Santa doesn't get married before Christmas Eve at midnight, it's all over. So, he must go back to the Real World, find out what's up with Charlie and find someone to be Mrs Clause. Charlie is in trouble at school for painting graffiti, but after meeting his principal and her feelings about Christmas, it becomes understandable why he did it.
Without giving away too many secrets, I can say that Santa only has a limited amount of Santa magic to use while he is in the real world. Meanwhile the head elf and his assistant try to cover up the fact that Santa must leave and go right on schedule. It results in a subplot that's a nice touch and is good for some funny moments. At the same time I felt Tim Allen projects a complete sense of good will and a belief that he really is Old Saint Nick. In a couple of scenes where he uses his magic I had a smile on my face.
Will kids like this film? I'm sure they will. Some adults may be turned off completely by this, but their cynicism is probably so high that it's their problem. So what? Some of my customers at Hollywood Video are parents who will like it even more than I do. I doubt it will ever become the holiday classic like A CHRISMTMAS STORY or IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, but it does bring good cheer.",1068854400,8,2713,4.449799196787149

The ending isn't what I thought it would be, but I was plesently, VERY plesently suprised that Eric Lloyd was playing Charlie again. It has the comedy and it's really sweet with Charlie having trouble with girls and all. I think if i had to pick the best actor in this movie, I would say Eric Lloyd because he does the whole ""troubled teen"" act really well and he's just so dang believeable when he cries.

While it had some of the same ideas and turns of phrase that made the first one so endearing (i.e. the ""Mrs. Clause"" and the Tooth Fairy character), the story itself was formulaic and uninspired.  The result is the latest in a series of bland 'House of Mouse' sequels that attempts to cash in on the success of its predecessor. Heavy on glitz, but thin on substance.  Without Tim Allen, this effort would have been another straight to video sequel, and in my opinion, it still should have been.

Tim Allen is perfect for this role, and the special Santa effects where romantic, and brought out special feelings for those involved.  The High School Reunion was very precious with the magical gifts for all!  And the sleigh ride was so romantic, especially with the snow following the sleigh as they rekindled their feelings for one another.  On the negative, I would have toned down a little bit on the robotic & ""evil"" Santa.",1041206400,2,489,4.7176470588235295
1475939,2,B00005JLQ8,"In 1994, Tim Allen's feature debut film ""Santa Clause"" was released to be a commercial success.  Eight years later, somehow they decided to make a sequal to the original, which, by the way, I didn't remember much.  I saw it, that's for sure, but no images remain in my mind.
Possibly the same fate would be waiting for this one, which features the titular character Scott Calvin, now called Santa and living around the North Pole with cute elves.  He is happy, working for the good kids all over the world,; however, he is suddenly informed that there is one clause he should have known much earlier.  That is, Santa must have a wife, Mrs. Clause so to speak, and he has to find a spouse within the deadline.  And that is coming very near, like, about one month.
Five scriptwriters are credited to concoct the story, which I find very weak and even dated -- I said to myself, ""must be married?""  The filmmakers clearly didn't think about the possibility that not all the children watching this film share the same image of ""family,"" but I can forget that part.  That's a comedy, so just make us laugh.
And as a comedy, ""Santa Clause 2"" doesn't work well.  There are some funny moments such as plastic Santa played by Allen in special make-up, or flatulant reindeer, but I don't think adults would find them memorable.  In fact, I don't believe that kids watching the film might be bored unless they are very young pre-teens.  The production designs are decently done, and Tim Allen and other cast do their best to be amusing, but how do you think when the film begins with a scene in which you see the surprised faces of airplane crew flying over the North Pole, who happen to hear the Christmas song of Smokey Robinson coming from underground?  Is this tame gag so funny?
It is said that Hollywood studios, including Walt Disney company which produced this film, lack in originality, but the true problem is not that.  It is that they lack confidence.  If only the script pursued the premise of marrying Mrs, Clause much further, I was thinking about that while watching the film.  Elizabeth Mitchell plays superbly the headmaster of a school with her rather cold, cynical attitude towards kids, and the romance between her and Tim Allen has some good moments.  Of course, her cynicism is to be dismantled.  But the film meanders among the unnecessary sub-plots about Scott Calvin's son, Judge Reinhold - Wendy Crewson family (did you remember they were in the original?) and the conference of traditional fairies.  There are many sketches, but none of them can sustain the whole film.
People say ""kids might love it""; perhaps they might, but you cannot underestimate kids.  (I'd really like to know the opinions of teenagers, especially above 16.)  As for adults, I don't think this is a good idea to spend the time.  The premise of ""Be married, be a Santa"" never sounds enticing to me.",1040515200,4,2888,4.658777120315582
1475940,2,B00005JLQ8,"Christmas is a wonderful time of the year, and this is one of the better movies of today.  But even as a fantasy, this film is mediocre at all standards.
Scott (Tim Allen) has been divorced from his marriage in the first movie and, as 'Santa', he needs to find a Mrs. Claus before Christmas Day or else...  And time runs short.
Charlie, now a grown-up teenager, gets in trouble for defacing school property.  Not once, but several times.  And the school's outer wall has grafitti all over it.
One of the better parts of the film is that the school staff gets the toys they wanted since their childhood days ... good for a chuckle or two, but warm-hearted nevertheless.

Meanwhile, his teenage son has become a ""tagger"" and is in big trouble at school. Tim (minus Santa's extra pounds) falls for the pretty school principal, and before you know it, they are married.

Adults may find the script to be poorly written and the plot  corny. However, I think young children who still believe in Santa will love the story and the cute reindeer. The North Pole and Santa's workshop are well done and the movie oozes happiness.

Tim Allen looks uncomfortable with the dialog and hams it up way too much. Elizabeth Mitchell, as the principal, lacks charisma and is instantly forgettable. The elves try way too hard to be cute, but in spite of this it's still a colorful and cheerful Christmas movie and children will enjoy it.",1039046400,,882,4.569620253164557

It'll probably be five stars from your kids, & something good from you, probably. If you can get throught the first five minutes, well, its just good.",1037836800,2,516,4.559139784946237

The future ""Mrs. Claus"" comes to believe too suddenly, but kids won't care. To them it is part of the magic and probably not their favorite part of the story. Overall, a fun movie for kids.

1476020,2,B00005JLQ8,"Sometimes one Santa is enough. The Santa Clause 2 picks up several years after the original left off, with the new Santa (Tim Allen) fully adjusted in his job. Unfortunately any magic and authentic holiday spirit the original film contained is lost in this second chapter.
Now, while I admit sweet sappy family films are not my cup of tea, if they're done right I can certainly enjoy them. Especially good Christmas films which help me settle into that holly jolly spirit. The first Santa Clause sat just fine with me, offering enough entertainment to keep me watching and avoided too much of the saccharin-drenched family goodness that can make me sick to my stomach. The story of an ordinary man, divorced and trying to have a good relationship with his son, who falls into becoming the mythical Santa Claus was perfect holiday fare. Not a masterpiece by any measure, but sweet innocent fun. It's sequel, however, falls into a retread of similar themes and worse: Using cliched Christmas movie gimmicks. In other words, there isn't much originality here.
The story this time around is that another clause (rule) has been discovered that says Santa must marry or he'll lose his powers (rather convenient they found this rule out after 7 years on the job just moments before he starts losing his magic). Meanwhile, his son Charlie is on the naughty list and he must go home to put him back on track. Despite some plot holes, it seems this idea could work. But it doesn't.
What made the original work was the slow discovery of the magical world of Santa Claus amidst our real world. While being a fantasy, it had serious roots in the world we know. But the sequel is rooted in the fantasy world, the outside world plugged in as though it were an afterthought. Then it goes a step further into fantasy when other mythical creatures such as the Tooth Fairy and Mother Earth appear, making the film seem more silly then charming.
This movie is strictly for children and their parents who are into family fare. Those that fit into this category, don't let me sway your decision to see it. But for anyone who is at all serious about movies: Don't waste your time.",1037059200,4,2157,4.664041994750656

I had to tell my two children to give it a chance after each of them, about 5 minutes in, turned to me and said that they wanted to sit in the car. It's that formulaic, that predictable, and that boring. God, even Ice Age, as lame and unoriginal as it was, didn't drive us from the theater like this steaming bowl of tripe. Hollywood, believe it or not, has really hit a new low with this awful stuff. But, for all of you who love mediocrity, enjoy.

I'm glad I did- It's a fun movie that can be enjoyed by ALL age groups. (In fact, there were hardly any kids in attendance the afternoon I went, but the adults were having a grand old time!) Tim Allen is hilarious in his dual roles as Santa and Santa's evil plastic duplicate. This time out, Santa is racing the clock to find A wife, due to a recently discovered Clause in his contract (The ""Mrs. Clause""....); Unless he's married by Christmas, he'll no longer be Santa. Elizabeth Mitchell plays the lovely potential Mrs., and has some cute romantic scenes with Allen. The film is fast and funny, and Director Michael Lembeck does a good job of keeping the laughs coming, while propelling the plot along. I especially enjoyed the scenes with The Tooth Fairy...

Then things start to go wrong.
P>I found THE SANTA CLAUSE 2 to be quite enjoyable. It's a worthy sequal to the original movie and it's only downside is that the acceptance of Principal Neuman that Scott is Santa seems a bit rushed.
Kids will enjoy the movie with all the toys, flying raindeer, and Santa.

It takes alot of make of sequal. For one you have to keep the whole cast to make it seem like the first one. Second of all you have to make a story that makes the first one and the second one are both as good. The actors and actresses all came back for the new one which is just great.
The movie takes place eight years after the first one. Scott Calvin is still Santa Clause and possibly the best one ever. All the elfs love him and they are in there busiest time yet making toys for Christmas which is coming in about two months. Scott then all of a sudden has problems. His head elf Bernard informs him that his son Charlie has landed himself on the naughty list for vandilizing the school gym. His next problem comes with he is informed by a 900 year old elf Curtis(who looks just like a kid)that he has to get married before Christmas Eve or he could not be Santa Clause anymore. He is also losing weight and losing his beard. He decides that mabey he should stay home from now on because that might be why Charlie has been acting up. Curtis then comes up with a plan. The elfs have made a quicker way to make toys.......by putting them in a machine that doubles them exactly,smaller,or larger. Scott goes into the machine and a toy like version of himself comes out. He goes back to his town bringing Comet the reindeer with him to help Charlie and find a wife. He only has a little bit of magic on him and he can't use it all otherwise he can't get back to the North Pole. Meanwhile at the North Pole the sub Santa has been reading the North Pole rule book and sees that every single child has been bad once so he decides to send them all coal. The elfs try to fight back and he uses the duplicate machine to enlarge dozens of toy soldiers. Scott has to take care of everything at home AND save the North Pole. Geez....it's alot of work to be Santa!
The movie's plot may sound a little off but once you actually see the movie you'll be glad you did. Fans of the first one should love this one and if you havn't seen the first...see it.
