There really isn't much to add--except perhaps a personal note. This disc brought back many memories of my misspent youth. While other teens may have followed rock bands, my friends and I engaged in lively cafeteria debates over fledgling artists like Michael Tilson Thomas and the merits of the latest Shostakovich scores. At about the time of this concert, my best friend Steve played for me selections from his father's LP collection of the Vaughan Williams symphonies, conducted by the redoubtable Sir Adrian Boult. A life-long passion for British music in general, and Vaughan Williams in particular, ensued.

Admittedly, Job and the 8th Symphony were tough nuts for a teenager to crack, and it was many years before I came to fully appreciate these strangely beautiful and entrancing scores. This DVD should dramatically increase the appreciation of this music. The camera work is conventional (the bulky cameras of the day must have been positioned well above the stage), but the visuals do enable us to follow the musical lines easily and fully appreciate the color and audacity of Vaughan Williams's unconventional scoring. Boult, incidentally, employs the largest baton I've ever seen, and some of the musician's hairstyles seem unintentionally comic by today's standards.

Most striking of all, though, are the visuals that accompany the ballet, Job. I had hoped for a fully staged production of the work--something rarely encountered in real life. What the BBC did instead on this special occasion was perhaps even more compelling. As Boult and the London Philharmonic play the score we are shown, from time to time, the visionary drawings of William Blake that inspired the music. The effect is stunning and helps establish the proper mood for each scene.

These are live performances, so the playing is not always perfect. Concertmaster Rodney Friend, in particular, had a very rough day. His all-important solos are clumsy and ill-prepared. Nonetheless, the passion and vitality of these splendid musicians come through in every bar. Don't miss this one.",1323820800,14,2347,5.301075268817204
