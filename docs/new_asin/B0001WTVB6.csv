The end left me wondering
I would watch it again, Kate brings one into her personal needs and desires. well acted

2034268,5,B0001WTVB6,"I saw this movie on TV many years ago and fell in love with it. It stood out from the many ""routine"" thrillers you could watch every week in one form or another.

Here you had real quality! Kate Capshaw was excellent as the ""retired"" CIA agent, forced to go on one more mission out of gratitude to a colleague, who once saved her life.

Well, you get thrilling chases, lots of humorous sitiuations, getting to feel the icy fear of not being able to trust even those sent you on this dangerous mission; ending up facing lethal danger, only having yourself to rely on. There is also good support from her co-stars. Picture- and sound quality is fine on this DVD release.

Bravo Kate and CO!",1140393600,11,688,4.4015748031496065
2034269,4,B0001WTVB6,"I have to warn you that this was first shown on TV back in the late 80's.  Thus there are no overt sex scenes, mindless violence or such.  Plot, well written and delivered dialoge are what this movie has going for it.  It actually would have done very well in the movie theatres instead of on TV.  Capshaw, Greggory Sierra are very good.  Give it a shot you won't be disappointed.",1128988800,7,380,4.295774647887324

8017039,5,B0001WTVB6,"I loved this movie when it was called Her Secret Life years ago.  Yes, it is a bit dated, but the story continues to be interesting and even my son who is too young to remember it thought it was worth watching.",1502150400,,210,4.0

8017041,3,B0001WTVB6,"I'm not sure how to rate this, as while I have a soft spot for this older made-for-TV movie, and love the theme song, I can't recommend this copy. There is a small but important piece missing at the very end which will make this copy less than satisfying for fans. It may not matter as much for those who haven't seen it yet, but it is still an edited version to let the buyer know. I rate the movie 4, but this copy 2, so will give it 3 stars. I ended up getting another version off eBay that was complete.",1450051200,2,507,3.980392156862745

8017043,5,B0001WTVB6,"While I was doing a massive cleanout of  VHS tapes I've had for years, I came across this movie that I had recorded.  I LOVED this film.  I, too, saw it on TV many years ago and I've never forgotten it.  I just placed my order for the DVD.  I was absolutely stunned to find that this is available on DVD and I can't wait to receive it.  I loved the story and as for no sex scenes - this movie didn't need them - the 2 leads really steamed up the screen IMHO!",1392940800,,458,3.8191489361702127
8017044,5,B0001WTVB6,"Capshaw is convincing as former spy who returns to her dark past and as a strong female character who is neither brawny nor weepy, but instead intelligent, cunning, and--as far as spies go--honest and true to herself. I wish they would have continued with a sequel or a series.",1374624000,,277,4.673469387755102

8017046,5,B0001WTVB6,"I, like others have written, only saw this movie once many years back - but it stuck with me. It's never been re- broadcast that I could tell and I just figured for the price why not buy it.

There was nothing on tv worth watching so we popped the film in and had a really enjoyable time watching it. In fact it is eons better than some of the garbage currently on.

Great love story, top notch actors and a pretty decent story. For a couple of hours I escaped into a very pleasant movie.

If anyone out there has any influence, please get some network to give this film some air time. If even if its just on the Lifetime channel.  I'm certain the viewers would love it.",1351209600,2,670,4.130769230769231
8017047,4,B0001WTVB6,"First I'll agree that it's a pretty good 80's style movie. I always liked Kate Capshaw. However, watch out as other reviewers noted this film was made for TV back in the 80's I did not see any mention that at that time it was entitled ""Her Secret Life"". Because of the name change I didn't realize that I already have a copy of this movie on VCR format. Also the cover of the DVD package is deceiving in that as Kate does on atleast two occasions handles a firearm in neither case is it an automatic with a silencer attached.",1325980800,,525,4.207920792079208
