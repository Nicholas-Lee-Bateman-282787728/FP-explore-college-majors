1781745,3,B00006JMRD,Every1 knows the story by now & it's one of my all-time favorite films. They say it's in its original 'theatrical release version' but that should mean widescreen or letterbox for you old-timers. I WILL NOT BUY THIS FILM AGAIN UNTIL IT'S RELEASED AS A WIDESCREEN EDITION!! The sweeping landscapes demand this and so do I. Stay away from this title until they FINALLY do it right once & for all!!,1035936000,4,395,4.577464788732394
1781746,5,B00006JMRD,"Imagine watching ""The Quiet Man"" with Maureen O'Hara narrating throughout! It is nothing short of sensational - like having Ms. O'Hara in your living room. There is much commentary from Maureen throughout the DVD and she is given free reign. None of these little snippets of information.  What is also important is that classic film buffs we are finally getting some truly accurate information about the making of this film masterpiece - from someone who was there. We have indeed been blessed with the longevity of Maureen O'Hara.  She is still gorgeous and spirited and a wonderful representative of her industry.
If you don't own a DVD then this is a valid reason to run right out and get one.  IT IS WONDERFUL!",1035676800,3,714,4.788617886178862
1781747,4,B00006JMRD,"Just finished viewing the colectors edition of this timeless classic.  Maureen OHara's commentary soundtrack is wonderful.  The new documentary ""Remembering Ireland"" which features OHara, Andrew Mcglagen and John Wayne's son Patrick adds a great deal of appreciation of how this movie was brought to the screen by John Ford. Leonard Maltin ""Making of"" is OK, but I wish he would have been a little more on the ball and got interviews with several cast members when they were alive. (In 1990 when he did the documentary, Mildred Natwick(widow),Charles B. Fitzsimons (Hugh Forbes),James Lilburn,(Father Paul) were very much alive). Missing from this presentation is the original trailer.  Sad to say, this DVD edition still features a very soft image.  If you watch the first edition of this dvd, the original trailer allows you to see how clear and sharp the technicolor print was. I hope someday this print will be upgraded.",1035590400,2,924,5.14
1781748,2,B00006JMRD,"This new DVD version is still unacceptable. The source print is scratchy, the colours bleed and shift (watching the shifting green shades in the opening scene on the train platform is enough to make you seasick), the focus is soft, and the excessive compression has resulted in annoying ""mosquito"" visual noise. A major disappointment.
On a positive note, the additional special features (new to this version of the DVD) are interesting and worthwhile. Otherwise, buyer beware!",1035417600,4,477,5.2894736842105265
1781749,5,B00006JMRD,"One of my all time favorite films.  The Duke is all man and Maureen is well, gorgeous.  Watch it whenever I need a lift in spirits and few chuckles.  Several extras on the collector's edition worth the viewing time especially the Maureen O'Hara interview.",1515628800,,255,4.75

1781756,5,B00006JMRD,"This was John Wayne's best true romantic comedy, and it is one of the best films of all times.

The cinematography is at times breathtaking. The story is warm and funny. Best of all, you get a real sense of belonging to the small Irish town in which the film is set. You'll feel the community so fully that you'll be sorry when the film is over and you have to return to your own.

John Ford and John Wayne's favorite entourage cast is assembled and does fine work in the roles of the families and townspeople involved in the story.

Maureen O'Hara is as fiery as ever, and in her prime of being the great beauty she was.

If you've never seen this film, you owe it to yourself. This is one of the few films that I always watch anytime it happens to come on, and always will.",1508976000,2,775,4.1466666666666665

1781789,5,B00006JMRD,"I really love this movie, and having Maureen O'Hara's commentary is such a great addition on the ""collector's edition"". I would say to be careul which dvd release you get of the film. Other reviewers have said that one of the releases has a bad picture, and I have not found that to be the case with my copy which is called the ""collector's edition dvd"".

I also bought the first blue-ray release. In my opinion, this collector's edition dvd is better. After listening to Maureen O'Hara's commentary of how John Ford would ""paint a picture"" (and also knowing how he would work with shadows), I didn't feel like the first blu-ray got the picture right. It felt washed out. I'm sure the first blu-ray release is sharper/crisper, but you lose the color in my opinion.

I have no complaints at all with the collector's edition dvd, and getting Maureen O'Hara's entertaining and (obviously) very insightful commentary is wonderful!",1486166400,,926,4.817610062893082
1781790,5,B00006JMRD,"This movie is the epitome of a classic. A most excellent old movie, as all of the John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara's movies are, but this one in particular holds a special place in my heart, having been filmed in my homeland, Ireland. The scenery is spectacular-- it was filmed in and around the small town of Cong in western Ireland. A great movie for fans who enjoy John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara and Ward Bond, as well as the Emerald Isle. It has a rather old-fashioned, straightforward plot and a great deal of excellent humor, not to mention a cast of memorable character actors. It's one of those movies to curl up with on a blustery night and simply enjoy. It's guaranteed not to give children or anyone nightmares. It's nice to have it on hand for a family movie night and parents don't have to worry about any aspect of it not being suitable for children of any age.",1485993600,,868,4.43125
1781791,2,B00006JMRD,color was way off and picture not clear kind'a fuzzy,1485648000,,52,4.3
1781792,5,B00006JMRD,"This is a very enjoyable movie to watch.  It is something of a departure for John Wayne from the westerns and military movies that he is noted for.  However it is not a complete departure.  John Wayne plays a former professional fighter who fought and gained some fame in America, and then returns to his family roots in Ireland.  There he finds romance and some clash of cultures.  It is a romance, but the ""Duke"" still gets to be the Duke.

The movie is of Academy Award stature with the director, John Ford, being awarded an Academy Award for best director.  There was a second Academy Award for best cinematography.

The movie is based fairly loosely on a short story of the same name by Maurice Walsh.  As is common, there are important differences between the short story and the movie.  As much as I enjoyed the movie, and I do a lot, I like the short story more, especially when read along with the other related short stories that it is part of.  I am very glad I experienced both the stories and the movie.  Thank You..",1484697600,,1029,4.414893617021277

1781885,5,B00006JMRD,"If anything, The Quiet Man is a idealized movie about rootedness.  In this excellent John Ford Classic, Sean Thornton (John Wayne) returns to his Irish birthplace after growing up in the Industrial heartland of America.  Later in the plot we learn that Thornton is a boxer who killed a man in the ring.  Thornton has vowed to never fight again.

Unfortunately, he has moved back to Ireland a place whose people are pretty comfortable with a good scrape every now and then.  Thornton meets Mary Kate Danaher, expertly played by the very lovely Maureen O'Hara.  She is the younger sister of a grumpy, forceful landowner Squire Danaher.  The good Squire was out-bid when Thornton purchased a piece of land that Danaher wanted and he was frustrated in his attempts to woo the local wealthy widow.  Thornton has made some pretty good friends in town quite quickly, including the drunk, the Catholic Priest, the Church of Ireland Vicar, and others.  That group tricked the Squire into allowing the marriage between Sean and Mary Kate. As a result, the Squire withholds the cash dowry and Sean must reconcile his marriage and the new responsibilities and circumstances of that with his vow to not fight again.

All the actors are the usual ones picked by John Ford.  You see the same faces here as in the 1940 film The Long Voyage Home.

Again, the movie is an idealized view of rootedness.  In John Ford's Ireland, the Catholics and Protestants are getting along, the land-owning Norman descended noble-woman is very concerned about the townsmen and rural folk in her area, the IRA is an organization that wants to see the fight under the Marquis of Queensbury rules ""or they'll burn your house down,"" and everyone knows and sing same songs in perfect tune.  If only life, and Ireland, were really like that.",1422403200,,1802,4.808441558441558

family were in it,but also Maureen's. Additionally some of Wayne's favorite

PROS

Cannot say enough about this great Movie. Wonderful Acting Excellent Music SCORE  BEAUTYFULL LOCATION

 The first American feature to be filmed in Ireland's picturesque countryside. ABSOLUTLYBREATHTAKING and  BEAUTYFULL  Ford richly imbued this masterpiece with his love of Ireland and its people.

 Absolutely Whimsical movie,  Superb acting , John Wayne , Maureen ,O'Hara and the rest of the cast.

The actor who plays little Mickeline was very funny and a talented actor

Very enjoyable to sit back with your wife and  escape reality for a while  and enjoy this classic.
My favorite line.( Here's a stick to beat the nice lady with. ) Please watch the movie before you start calling me a wife beater . You will laugh at the line.

CONS

 Ireland's picturesque countryside and the  love of Ireland and its people cannot be enjoyed one bit due to the utter GREED and Shotty transfer to DVD  BY REPUBLIC PICTURES .

You can actually see in the first 15 minutes the colors fading in and out and the very bad contrast change on the faces of the actors which are at times hard to make out.

Too bad  REPUBLIC PICTURES  butchered the heck out of this  fine Classic.

REPUBLIC PICTURES stated that they  re-mastered this timeless classic that won 2 ACADAMY AWARDS .  THEY LIED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

They should be held accountable and be forced to  recall all of the videos and be forced at their own expense  to Truly Re-Master the Quit Man all at their expense and ship them to all the people who purchased this fine classic.

I am not one for Government intrusion..... However  I believe Congress should act on contemptuous acts of blatant thievery and  lying to the public just to make a few Hundred million off people like you and me '

I with many , have commented on this utterly deplorable transfer of this classic film to DVD.

It states quite clearly on the review  that this film has been digitally Re-Mastered . I took that to mean both video and audio.  LIE.

 The picture quality of this DVD is shocking, one of the worst I have ever seen

A classic that will have you immersed with the movie that nothing will get done. The story goes that a retired fighter returns home to his up bringing in Ireland to claim what is rightfully his. Secrets are held back and he falls in love with a village girl to which he must be approved by her brother and a diary paid for her. Nothing quite goes right and the story is fast and with that touch of comedy that will have you loving this show right from the start. Action plus suspense with a bit of this and that added makes this an A grade plus for sheer delight and fabulous entertainment that will have you pleading for more, there was room for more but never carried on what a pity. There is plenty of people and they all get involved even to handing a stick to beat her with and with fist flying what more could you ask for, so now go to the store get the movie wonder over to the shop pick up the popcorn now it's not a night in without the popcorn, grab your chair put your feet up and relax as its all worth it.

This is the collector' edition DVD and it totally lets down the video quality of the original.  It is VERY badly pixellated and the dark areas of the image have little or no detail.  Although the movie remains a wonderful classic even when viewed at such poor quality, the images in the film are a letdown.  I should also note that the film is reproduced in 4:3 ratio, which I suspect is unnecessary.

Frankly, this movie would look better viewed on a standard resolution CRT (tube) TV than on any HD set, as the lower resolution of the older tube would allow the nasty pixellation of this version to blur a little.  I suspect that a good VHS copy viewed through an S-video connection would look as good.",1395014400,,828,4.523489932885906

O'Hara and Wayne appeared together in several films; this was their best collaboration...my opinion of course. The support cast, especially Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald and Victor McLaglen - McLaglen in particular - are superb. John Ford's direction is outstanding...this is one of his best films, especially outside the Western genre. If you've never seen John Wayne outside his usual western, military, he-man vehicle, you need to see this one. It will convince you I think, that Wayne's acting ability was so much more than one-dimensional, and so much more than he was ever given credit for...and Ford had a knack of bringing out the best in the Duke. This movie features one of Wayne's best performances...one of the best from the fiery Irish redhead too.

There were a few seconds on the larger TV where the video blurred a bit, but I don't know if that was my DVD player sputtering or the digital tv adjusting.  The video quality of the 60th edition seems a bit better than the other, but not particularly noticeable enough that I would return either one or recommend one over the other.  The main difference in these sets is that only the 1st (The Quiet Man Collector's Edition) has an interview with Maureen O'Hara in her later years, along with bios (read on screen) on all the actors with their films.  Both editions have a brief film hosted by critic Leonard Maltin about the making of the Quiet Man that's decent.  Only the 60th edition has a printed book with detail about the history of the film.

1782051,5,B00006JMRD,"This was a great movie for John Wayne to show he could act outside of the cowboy genera. To me he offered another side of his acting ability that gave him more depth of character. Of course casting Maureen O'hara as Mary Kate Danaher, not only added a superb actress of great beauty but also a person who could play the part of this fiery and willful personality. One of John Wayne's long time acting buddies, Victor McLaglen was a perfect cast for the part of the bull headed and proud Squire Will Danaher.  Plus his large stature made it more plausible for the show down fight between Sean Thorton, John Wayne, and Squire Danaher.  Of course you can't overlook the many talents of Barry Fitzgerald as the man of various occupations including match maker in this movie.  He continued to excel as a character actor in his part as Michaleen Oge Flynn. Finally Ward bond as Father Peter Lonergan added to the color of the various characters in this John Ford production.

There are over 400 reviews of this movie and I won't waste anyone's time rehashing the plot, performances of this terrific labor of love shown by John Ford and his ensemble of actors/characters.

For whatever the reason, no one seems to want to clean up this movie and bring it up to 2012 standards for picture and sound.  TCM (Turner Classic Movies) shows this movie on occasion and with all of the time and effort they put into restoring movies and then selling on DVD, the movie shown on their channel, is the same LOUSY print that has been available for sale for many years.

Reviews from 2004-2012 have called for some kind of revamping of this movie and nothing is being done!!!  My guess: whoever owns the rights to this movie is not putting forth the effort and trust to allow anyone to redo this movie and give it the treatment it deserves.

If you're thinking about buying a DVD version of this movie thinking that it will be of better quality.......FORGET IT !!!

Wait for it to show on Turner Classic Movies and save yourself some $$$.

Once this movie get transferred on DVD with the kind of treatment it deserves, then by all means.......buy it!!!  But in the meantime......save your money.

I'm sorry to say that apparently restoration of this movie has fallen on deaf ears (and blind eyes).

booted and running the movie related to that particular ""Blue ray"" disk. The final test was to see if I could read the ""Quiet Man"" from my off-line ""Blue Ray"" connected to my 50 inch screen.

1782063,5,B00006JMRD,"Although the image quality on this DVD is disappointing, I guarantee that after a couple of minutes you will forget it and focus easily on the movie itself. ""The Quiet man"" is one of John Ford's masterpieces and this great director deservedly received Oscar of best director in 1952 for this movie. ""The Quiet man"" was also nominated for the best picture, but lost to ""The greatest show on earth"" of Cecil B. de Mille. ""The Quiet man"" is a real treat, packing incredible fun, extremely well interpreted and so gentle and tender that it leaves after viewing a warm feeling in the heart.

To avoid spoilers, let's just say what is showed in the first minutes of the movie - an Irish emigrant, Sean Thornton (John Wayne), after spending years in USA comes back to Ireland, to settle and enjoy in peace the money he made working across the ocean. When looking for a house and a piece of land to buy he notices a gorgeous local girl Mary Kate Danaher (the magnificent Maureen O'Hara). Mary Kate is probably the most beautiful woman in the whole county, but at past 30 she is still single because of her incredible temper, backed by a venomous tongue and easily used fast and strong fists (and claws!). Instantly thunderstruck, Thornton starts courting her with the most honorable intentions.

But things of course can never be that simple and even a peaceful Irish village can become the scene of the most homeric dramas, especially considering that Thornton has some secrets in his past... And then Mary Kate's gigantic, brutish, foul mouthed and permanently angry older brother ""Red"" Will Danaher takes an instant dislike to the newcomer... ""Red"" Will is played here by Victor Mclaglen, a very interesting personage and an old friend of John Ford. McLaglen won an Oscar for main leading role in 1935 for his incredible performance in ""The informer"", and this role in ""The quiet man"" got him his second nomination, for best supporting role. He did not get it this time, but he should have!

All the three main actors give here an extremely touching performance - and even if you dislike John Wayne, well, I think after viewing this movie, you may change your mind...

This movie has many charms: actors, music, scenery, dialogs, but one of the most important is that it is TOTALLY POLITICALLY INCORRECT!! Especially any feminist watching this movie will probably find herself in danger of lethal heart attack or at least a seizure...))) Also, if you dislike Christians and especially clergy (both catholic and protestant), you will NOT like this movie. Me, being a devoted papist, I loved the Christian message of this movie greatly as well as the personage of local priest, as fanatically devoted to fishing trouts as to fight against Satan and all his works...))))

I saw this movie many times and every time it made my laugh out loud and it left me feel warm, happy and peaceful in my heart. I really hope you will like it too.",1333324800,,2926,4.729411764705882

1782065,5,B00006JMRD,"John Ford's 1952 classic, ""The Quiet Man"", has held up extremely well as a viewing experience all these many years.  It offers a fine cast, a good story with an engaging mix of comedy, romance, and drama, and of course the lovely land of Ireland itself.

John Wayne plays Sean Thornton, an American ex-boxer who returns to his home village in Ireland after inadvertantly killing a man in the ring.  He makes an immediate enemy out of town bully Will by buying a choice piece of property out from under his greedy nose, then dares to romance Will's fiery sister Mary Kate (an excellent Maureen O'Hara).  Sean and Mary Kate will struggle to arrive at an understanding, only to be undercut by Will, who refuses Mary Kate's dowry.  The stage is set for an magnificent brawl to the finish.  The diminutive but hilarious Barry Fitzgerald almost steals the movie as the driver of the local horse taxi and keeper of all bets.

The vivid color technology of the movie takes a little getting used to, as does the exurberant acting.  The movie is perhaps overlong for its plot, but Ford uses the extra time to showcase his native Ireland.  The collector's edition has several extra features on the making of the movie.

1782072,4,B00006JMRD,"I owned but eventually gave away a DVD copy of this film because of its poor video quality. I wonder why Criterion hasn't jumped on this classic?
Having said that, I wouldn't give this film a five star rating for either story line or acting -- it's a typical John Ford feel-good movie. But because of the strong Irish flavor of, I presume, a bygone era, it is enjoyable. I particularly get a kick out of Barry Fitzgerald's criticism of John Wayne's self-styled introduction to Maureen O'Hara, as she exits their Catholic church: ""Just who gave you permission to be playing patty cakes in the holy water?"" That slays me!
I hope Criterion or someone will do right by this film eventually and then I'll buy it again. The current quality level makes me wonder if the distributors figure: Let them have chopped liver now and, when we eventually do it right, we'll sell it to them again. If that assumption is correct, it's time to get on with it!
Addendum: HOORAY!!! Someone finally cleaned up this classic to Blu-ray (and perhaps Criterion standards) and made it much more enjoyable!

1782083,4,B00006JMRD,"Because of the way Amazon groups reviews, this is a combined review of two different versions of The Quiet Man.

First: 60th Anniversary Edition
FINALLY, a good transfer of this film.  Others have already commented on the excellent quality of the Blu-Ray.  I got the regular DVD edition, and the image quality is head and shoulders above the terrible quality of the old Collectors Edition, which I purchased previously (I want my money back!).  The image quality of the 60th Anniversary is a little bit grainy, but the other than that excellent.  Colors are spot on, which was a problem with the old version.

Definitely DO get the 60th Anniversary Edition, and avoid the Collectors Edition.

Old review of Collectors Edition follows:

I received the ""Collector's Edition"" version, the one with the commentary by Maureen O'Hara.  Some people had mentioned that they thought the picture quality of this one was ok.

Don't believe it.  The picture quality is lousy, full of digital artifacts.

Bottom line, do not buy this DVD, or this movie, until they fully restore/re-master it and get a good transfer from a proper print.  The picture quality of both of these editions is unacceptable.

The film is one of my favorites, but the DVD quality is atrocious.
(Update: 60th Anniversary Edition is a new edition with excellent picture quality.  Avoid the old Collectors Edition!)",1320019200,12,1374,4.991189427312776

One reviewer stated that there were two similar copies and one was better than the other.  Alexis Ray gave this number DVD (ASIN: B00006JMRD) which is the one I am commenting on.  This is supposed to be the better of the two.  That led me to the conclusion that there isn't anything out there, at this time, that is worth watching very often.  The film is very much worth seeing, but it is sad that this is the best we can get.  If this movie was clear, I would give it 5 stars, or more if I could.  It is truly a classic, but one which was poorly photographed, or poorly kept, or poorly transferred.  Perhaps it received the awards it did because on the big screen people accepted less in clarity for a number of reasons.  Maybe TCM should show it somewhere on the big screen.  If anyone who gave this dvd a 4 or 5 star rating, and agrees that this movie is out of focus, perhaps they could comment on why the high rating.  Just curious.",1319587200,,1270,4.202479338842975

Directed by John Ford

Irish-American boxer John Wayne, recovering from the trauma of having accidentally killed a man in the ring, arrives in the Irish village where he was born. Hoping to bury his past and settle down to a life of tranquility, Wayne has purchased the home of his birth from wealthy local widow Mildred Natwick, a transaction that has incurred the wrath of pugnacious squire Victor McLaglen, who coveted the property for himself. By and by, Wayne falls in love with McLaglen's beautiful, high-spirited sister Maureen O'Hara. Her insistence that Wayne conduct his courtship in a proper Irish manner-with puckish matchmaker Barry Fitzgerald along for the ride as ""chaperon""--is but one obstacle to their future happiness: the other is McLaglen, who spitefully refuses to give his consent to his sister's marriage, or to honor the tradition of paying a dowry to Wayne. Wayne could care less about dowries, but the tradition-bound Maureen refuses to consummate her marriage until McLaglen pays up.

The Perfect Movie Experience, there has never been another like it.

Special footnote: -- Barry Fitzgerald is the brother of actor Arthur Shields, with whom he performed in several films, most notably John Ford's The Quiet Man (1952).

1782096,1,B00006JMRD,"This DVD is awful. The colors are terrible: the greens and magentas are all out of whack, and the colors seem to constantly flicker and shift, as if they cannot maintain the correct hue and instead change slightly every few frames. It's a difficult thing to explain, but it's terribly obvious in the video. Aside from the distracting color issues, the video is grainy and blurry.

The audio is sufficient, but only just so. It's decent quality only considering how old the source material is. It certainly won't impress anyone, but it's serviceable, and less abusive than the picture.

It's upsetting that a film like The Quiet Man doesn't get a better home video presentation. What it really needs is a complete restoration (and an expensive one, unfortunately). I've heard people say that the VHS release of this movie is technically superior to this DVD. I'm inclined to believe them, having seen this disc.

Buy this only if you REALLY need to have this film right now on DVD. If you can stand it, you might want to wait and see if there will be a restored version in the near future (hopefully on Blu-Ray).

1782112,5,B00006JMRD,"Even though it's too late to post this for Saint Patrick's Day, ""The Quiet Man"" is a joyous, exuberant film to view any day of the year, and you don't have to be Irish to enjoy it, although if you're first generation Irish American as I am, and/or have visited Ireland at least once, you will have a deeper appreciation of it!  For sentimental reasons I do make it a point to view this film every St. Patrick's Day to honor the memory of my late father, who was Irish born, this was his favorite film, many a time he watched it, first whenever it was on regular television, and then on video when the VCR came into existence, he just loved it!

Retired American boxer, Sean Thornton (John Wayne), has returned to live in the small town of Innisfree, Ireland, where he was born.  Although he made a good living as a boxer, he accidently killed another man in the ring, and vowed never to fight again.  He purchases back the family homestead from the wealthy Widow Tillane (Mildred Natwick) incurring the enmity of the strapping well to do landowner Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) who wanted the property for himself.  Spitefully, Will refuses to let Sean court his beautiful, spirited sister Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara) despite the fact they are both in love, and Mary Kate won't wed without her brother's approval.  Will is tricked to into giving his consent by a conspiracy between the matchmaker Michaeleen Flynn, (Barry Fitzgerald), the parish priest Father Lonergan (Ward Bond) and the Protestant vicar Reverend Playfair (Arthur Shields) and his wife Elizabeth (Eileen Crowe), without Sean or Mary Kate's knowledge, and the courtship and the marriage duly take place.  However at the wedding reception Will learns the truth and blames the innocent Sean for the deception.  Enraged he refuses to give Mary Kate her dowry of 350 Irish pounds, which Mary Kate feels is rightfully hers, and she tells Sean to demand it from Will.  Sean doesn't understand the whole custom of the dowry, and it's significance to Mary Kate, and refuses to do so out of pride.  This causes a serious rift between Mary Kate and he that can only be resolved when he confronts and fights Will for the money even though Sean had pledged never to fight again.

The above synopsis sounds fairly somber, and while the subject matter is serious director John Ford and screenwriter Frank Nugent make sure that there is plenty of humor and laughter to leaven it out.

John Wayne was one of the cinema's most underrated actors; he was much more accomplished than he was given credit in his lifetime.  Amidst all his strong portrayals in ""Stagecoach"", ""Red River"" and ""The Searchers"", Sean Thornton stands out as his finest achievement.  Sean is a man of many parts and Wayne captures them all.  Although Sean is robust, virile, and athletic, Wayne is not afraid to show Sean's sensitive, tender side as well, reveal the touch of the poet that sometimes colors his speech.  This is a man comfortable in his own masculinity, who can appreciate beauty, he plants roses outside his cottage, is not afraid to let his wife drive the horse and cart that he has given her.  There is a streak of inherent melancholy in Sean that Wayne suggests; he has to live with the fact that even though it was unintentional, he is responsible for another man's death.  John Wayne truly does plumb the depths of this conflicted man, and stretch himself as an actor.  He absolutely deserved the Oscar for this performance rather than ""True Grit"".  Astonishingly, he wasn't even nominated, yet another Oscar injustice.

The entrance of Maureen O'Hara as Mary Kate is one of the most enchanting, beguiling introductions in movie history.  A barking sheepdog is herding a flock of sheep in a verdant, tree lined field, suddenly there is a magical glissando on harp strings, and Mary Kate appears, barefoot, clad in vivid blue and red, her burnished, titian tresses tumbling down her back, holding a staff in her hand as she follows behind, the sun hits her, giving the illusion as if she's lit from within.  She is the embodiment of an ancient Celtic queen from Irish mythology, Maeve or Isolde perhaps?  Sean, at first glimpse is dazzled; he asks Michaeleen rhetorically, ""Is that real?  She couldn't be!""  This was my father's favorite scene, he had owned sheep and tended them in Ireland, and he loved the combination of Maureen O'Hara, whom he adored and the flock.  Ms. O'Hara's Mary Kay is fiery and forthright; tart tongued when needed, (the title is one of her memorable stingers!) with a strong, decided character.  In fact she is a liberated woman, she treats men as equals and will settle for nothing less in return, she meets Sean's passion with her own.  In Ms. O'Hara's hands Mary Kate is gorgeous and glorious, an individual both men and woman can like and admire.  Like Wayne, this is her best performance, and irritatingly like Wayne was not Oscar nominated, what were they thinking that year?

I'd like to pay a quick tribute to the charismatic pairing of Wayne and O'Hara, they both bring out the excellence in the other, perfectly designed by nature, with a erotic magnetism, the sparks fly when they're together.  They rightfully belong in the pantheon of classic screen couples such as Tracy and Hepburn, Powell and Loy and Bogart and Bacall.

As for the rest of the cast, they are unqualifiedly marvelous one and all!  Leading the list Victor McLaglen as the bull headed Will Danaher, the only cast member to be Oscar nominated, and Barry Fitzgerald as Michaeleen Flynn, who as usual comes perilously close to stealing every scene that he's in.  A round of applause as well to Ward Bond, Mildred Natwick, Arthur Shields, Eileen Crowe and Francis Ford.  Lastly, I want to give a special mention to Jack MacGowran as Feeney, Will's elfin assistant and ""yes"" man, who delivers perfectly two of the funniest lines in the film!

This film was director John Ford pet project, it took him seven years to bring it to fruition, but it was worth the wait.  It's his own love letter to his Irish ancestry; he pulls out all the stops, uses some Irish clichs, but makes it work freshly and beautifully.  It is an idealized version where there seem to be no class distinction and Catholic and Protestant peacefully co-exist, which actually they did except in the strife ridden North of Ireland.  This was also a family film, Ford used his brother, son and brother in law, John Wayne's four children, Maureen O'Hara's two brothers, Barry Fitzgerald's brother, and Victor McLaglen's son. The final creation under Ford's scrupulous supervision is a cinema masterpiece, it was justly rewarded with five Oscar nominations including Best Film, winning for Best Director and Best Cinematography, but as I said earlier, it should have been nominated for at least two more and should have swept the Oscars that year!

Besides his dream cast, Ford had a wonderful script by Frank S. Nugent, one that featured such hilarious moments as Mary Kate and Michaeleen's discussing Sean's offer for her hand in marriage, Michaeleen's flabbergasted reaction to the Thornton's broken bed the morning after the wedding, and Father Logergan's struggle to land a prize salmon among others.  Yet there are sweet and tender moments such as when Sean surprises Mary Kate with the gift of a horse and buggy, and when the bewildered couple tentatively reaches out to each other in front of the fireplace after an argument about her dowry.  The script crackles with witty one-liners, but is also balanced by dialogue that has gentleness and even some traces of poetry.

The cinematography by Winton C. Hoch is spectacular, Ford sensibly put his foot down and insisted Technicolor be used.  The Irish scenery is breathtaking; I swear you can see almost all of the mythical ""Forty Shades of Green"" in the landscape!  If you've never had the pleasure of visiting Ireland before, the cinematography in this film will make you want to go.

The musical score is lilting, evocative and romantic, the composer Victor Young has woven traditional Irish songs and airs such as ""The Isle of Innisfree"", ""The Wild Colonial Boy"", ""Kerry Dances"", ""I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen"",""Galway Bay"" and ""The Rakes of Mallow"" into an ingratiating score that adds immeasurably to the film's charm.

A very quick note about the special features, the highlights are two excellent documentaries ""The Making of The Quiet Man"" hosted by Leonard Matlin, which presents a well researched history of the film, and ""The Joy of Ireland"" which mainly features the engaging remembrances of Maureen O'Hara, Ms. O'Hara also does a commentary over the film which is very interesting to hear.

 Well, one of the notorious characteristics of the Irish is the gift of gab, and I guess judging by the length of this review, I'm proving the point.  If I haven't persuaded you that this is highly recommended by now, I never will.  So, I'll close with a few words of Gaelic - ""Slan agus beannacht leat"" (Goodbye and blessings with you)!",1300924800,3,9017,4.8334417696811975
1782113,1,B00006JMRD,"Bash away.  ""The Quiet Man"" is sentimental, picture-postcard, shamrock-y claptrap. It's not funny, it's not dramatic, it's just hokey, embarrassing and insulting and condescending toward the Irish. Aren't they picturesque, and aren't their primitive ways just ever so too-too? Marion Morrison aka John Wayne, always a bizarre and to me repulsive screen presence with his awkward combination of machismo and limp-wristedness, never could act his way out of a paper bag. The rest of the actors, talking like Lucky Charms leprechauns so Americans will believe they are Irish but be able to understand them, play it all as broadly as a cartoon even though their work in other venues makes it clear they could do better. Best director for John Ford for this effort? I think maybe the Academy had just got in the habit, as it was his fourth award. No doubt you're sincere if you think this is ""highly entertaining"" and filled with ""lovely scenery"" and ""captivating performances"" from Wayne and the admittedly striking and authentically Irish Maureen O'Hara, but please do forgive me if I don't join you.",1298937600,2,1097,5.060773480662983

1782116,1,B00006JMRD,"After reading other reviews and paying special attention to Alexis Ray's (the first review in the list) suggestion about which DVD to get I bought the Collector's Edition. At first I thought that maybe I got a pirated copy, as if someone had video taped their TV while this movie played off a VHS tape. Other reviewers thought that the transfer to digital was satisfactory, I disagree. Bright colors bled into whites. The whites were harsh. Movement was blurry. I tried adjusting several display factors with some success, but have never had to make any adjustments with any other DVD. The quality of this product is just so poor. I couldn't watch the whole movie, it was giving me a headache. Amazon makes returns easy, so that's what I did and will receive a refund. I look forward to possible remastered and even restored version of this film. I hope they don't remove that little hair that pops up in a couple scenes... it reminds me that I'm watching a classic.",1296604800,,966,4.654970760233918

1782118,1,B00006JMRD,"I have the ""Collector's Edition DVD"" and am horrified at the abysmal picture quality especially on a movie of such high quality.  This is one of the best movies John Ford and John Wayne did but the poor reproduction is criminal.  Any 13 year old with a computer could have done a better job.  I agree with the the other posters that the poor quality makes it almost unwatchable.  If you are considering buying it hold off until someone does a better job of reproduction.  Ford insisted that Republic allow him to use Technicolor for the colour as opposed to their own colour process so that the film could be of the highest quality.

Especially now, seeing these actors that helped build Hollywood, some great old timers are alive again in these wonderful characters. One of Wayne and O'Hara's best in my humble opinion. If you want to see what The Duke could do on screen when not in uniform or cowboy duds, check out this fun film of a man who has been hurt and saddened by life and the spitfire, headstrong woman who lights the spark of life in him again...with some great laughs along the way. This movie reminds us what people used to be like, living and loving with passion, integrity, and taking care of life head on, not being politically correct, but being unapologetically human and always striving to live life with decency and honor. A great movie.",1289260800,,873,4.602564102564102
1782125,4,B00006JMRD,"I've always had an aversion to John Wayne. My family were horsey type people and of course they loved westerns and loved John Wayne. So I, being the rebellious type, hated him. I got over childish rebellions but still don't like John Wayne. He's just not a good actor. Like George Raft and Keannu Reeves, he is only capable of playing himself. To me he is more of a character actor than a leading man. His swaggering machismo, which makes him a god to the chest-beaters, only makes me yawn.
  So when I finally bought this film it was for the Technicolor, Maureen Ohara, and John Ford. (But after watching it I had to admit that Wayne did a good job.) It is a great film. I only wish there was a descent print. I bought the version that was supposed to be the better one, but it is still terrible. You can tell that the colors are supposed to be amazing. A good technicolor film is like watching a painting that moves. This is one of those films. But the print is alternately fuzzy and blown out. Sometimes, the faces are actually orange. What a shame that these precious parts of our heritage don't get the treatment they deserve unless some film industry beaurocrats decide that preservation is cost effective.

1782131,5,B00006JMRD,"This is my personal favorite among all John Ford's films. Presenting what is probably a rather romanticized image of an Ireland that I suspect never existed even 100 years ago, the film's visual beauty, interesting romantic dilemma, and wonderful performances, are nevertheless worth every minute of its slightly longish running time.  John Wayne is not one of my favorite actors and I can only go so far on the red-haired beauty of the admirably upholstered Maureen O'Hara.  However, as the conflicted, heartsore, regretful boxer Sean Thornton, who returns to his mother's natal village in Ireland, Innisfree, to find some peace and healing, Wayne strikes a nice if wooden balance between machismo and vulnerability.  O'Hara, as Mary Kate Danagher, the (sorry, there is no other word for it) fiery neighbor with whom Sean falls in love, provides for Wayne what can only be called a match made in Heaven: physically, temperamentally, intellectually, and spiritually - only culturally do Sean and Mary Kate suddenly find themselves at loggerheads.

Sean travels to Innisfree to find solace after a terrible experience in the boxing ring.  He began life in Pittsburgh, where his mother emigrated, and spent his youth in the city's legendary steel mills, a purgatory from which his boxing talent eventually freed him.  But all his young life his mother filled Sean's mind with the beauty and peace of Innisfree and the pretty cottage she was born in, White O'Morn.  Now wealthy from his boxing career, but with a deadly secret heavy on his heart, Sean returns to his mother's village to buy back the family cottage, rediscover his roots, and achieve reconciliation with his own past.  It is Mary Kate Danagher who Sean spots the day he arrives in Inisfree, barefoot in the lush green grass as she tends her brother's sheep, red hair blowing in the wind.  For Sean, it is love at first sight.

But Red Will Danagher (the formidable Victor MacLaglen in all his ham-fisted glory), also wants White O'Morn, as well as its owner, the genteel Widow Tulane, whose land lies so neatly next to his.  When Sean outbids Will for the cottage and its land, Danagher's volcanic ire fastens implacably on the Yank newcomer.

As ill-luck would have it, Mary Kate is Will's younger sister, who keeps house for him.  Sean, to his dismay, soon finds out that in order to win Mary Kate, he must first conquer her irascible brother's hostility, because without her brother's consent Mary Kate cannot marry, or if she does, would forfeit her dowry.  The symbolic importance of a girl's dowry as she leaves her family home to found one of her own, the necessity for a local matchmaker to facilitate proceedings - all the small village's seemingly immutable mating customs puzzle and infuriate Sean.  Only slowly does Sean come to understand what Mary Kate feels when she says that if he doesn't have her dowry, he doesn't have any real bit of her, that she is ""still the servant I have always been.""  Reluctant as Sean is to use his fists again for what he thinks of as ""only money"", eventually he realizes that he will have to come to terms with his last fighting experience or lose any chance at happiness with Mary Kate.

How Sean and Mary Kate and Red Will and the Widow Tulane, as well as a delightful supporting cast of characters (e.g., Barry Fitzgerald as the matchmaker and Ward Bond as the powerful village priest) find their way through this romantic and cultural tangle makes for a lovely, well-written, beautifully played two hours.  The exploration of different cultural expectations and misunderstandings is gentle and the custom of the dowry, and what it meant to a woman in such a culture freeing herself from girlhood obedience, provokes thought.  ""The Quiet Man"" is very much in a class by itself and shows all Ford's talent for marshalling exactly the right people in the right roles.",1282780800,,3878,4.8751902587519025
1782132,5,B00006JMRD,"John Wayne started out with Stagecoach and ended his career with motion pictures like True Grit.  He is probably most strongly identified with westerns, and possibly with various war pictures made in between, but he also made this motion picture along the way.  It is a delightful motion picture about a man escaping from his past which he tried to keep secret, but finds himself wrapped into Irish customs to win the woman he loves.  His brother-in-law to be wants to fight him for the dowry.

There were good performances all the way around, and some Irish scenery along the way.  It could give you an urge to move back to the Old Sod.

VHS looks terrible on HD tvs no matter how good the VHS is.if you still have a standard definition TV or an earlier LCD non-hd TV you'll be fine.its always good to keep a standard definition tv around so you can still watch your VHS tapes in nice image quality.this VHS also includes the making of the quiet man at the end of the movie,and the original trailer.i still have all my VHS movies.about 1000 of them,and i still enjoy them very much.i have collected no less than 10 high quality VCRs over the past few years to insure i can continue enjoying my collection.there's something fun about watching VHS,it may not always be the crisp picture you get from DVDs but it has a more real feel to it if that makes any sense.i also have tons and tons of DVDs but i get more of a kick out of my VHS for some reason.its rather nostalgic,maybe that's why?anyway i hope I've helped out someone,and go get your copy of the 40Th anniversary.they are here on amazon.com and also try EBAY.the easiest way to find it on amazon.com is to go to the HOME PAGE of amazon.com and type in the search window THE QUIET MAN 40th ANNIVERSARY VHS.then you will get the full list of all versions.mike",1281830400,,2922,4.610364683301343

Sean Thornton (John Wayne), reared in Pittsburgh but born in the cottage called White o'Morn in Innisfree, returns to the land of his birth intending to buy the place and spend his life there.  On his first glimpse of Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), he is immediately smitten.  The cottage has been acquired by the dignified and well-to-do widow Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick), who is reluctant to sell to him at first, but when Mary Kate's older brother, ""Squire"" Red Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen), expresses a rather presumptuous interest in it (and her), she consents, earning Thornton Danaher's enmity and making courtship all but impossible (""without her brother's consent she couldn't and wouldn't"").  So the parish priest Father Lonergan (Ward Bond), the Anglican rector Mr. Playfair (Arthur Shields), and the local matchmaker, bookmaker, go-between, and jaunting-car owner Michaeleen Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald) enter into a conspiracy to convince Danaher that the widow would take him in a minute if only there weren't another woman in his house.  It succeeds long enough for Sean and Mary Kate to get married, but trouble follows over her dowry--an assortment of household goods and some 350 pounds in gold coin.  And though the community expects that Sean will fight his brother-in-law over the issue, Sean is reluctant: he has a secret that preys on his mind.

With a brilliant cast (the accomplished scene-stealer Fitzgerald, 64 years old, is still up to his longtime standard, and Bond takes a break from his usual rough-and-tough image to do a convincing turn as a priest, while Sean McClory (as Owen Glynn) and Charles B.

Their real love and admiration for each other served to give their characters a beleivabilty that comes off the screen and into my heart. The beautiful countryside, village rogues, and touch of religious/political tension makes the story credible. In this movie, the villain is replaced with a stubborness that is based on both pride and love, real human emotions. I have worn out at least 2 VHS tapes of this film and will probably wear out the dvd. While most will consider this a John Wayne movie, I have always considered it what the film industry should produce: entertainment for the purpose of entertaining the family. My children grew up watching this and now my grandchildren are. John Ford and cast, thank you.",1255910400,,968,4.767857142857143

Its a good old fashioned comedy filled with colorful characters and very old timey values (many could get offended at the stereotypes and almost abusive nature of Waynes character in such a lighthearted film). I have to imagine that since this was filmed in Technicolor, back in the day the prints must have looked spectacularly beautiful (it won an Oscar for its cinematography and John Ford won an Oscar for directing). However, this dvd transfer is by far the absolute worst transfer for any major motion picture. This appears to be the same quality as an old second generation videotape. This is not hyperbole, I have literally never seen a worse transfer of any major motion picture from any age. This is an absolute travesty considering its importance in cinema history.

1782166,4,B00006JMRD,"The Quiet Man is a romantic comedy of sorts and is very much a nostalgic John Ford view of his Irish homeland.  It had been a dream of Ford's since the 1930s to do a film in his ancestral home showing all the idealized life and mannerisms that Ford saw in Irish customs and traditions.  While they are highly over emphasized, in Ford's Ireland, everyone drinks, sing songs and goes fishing while strictly observing their Catholic faith, at least when in sight of the ever present parish priest who is the story teller of the movie.

Our all Irish cast features John Wayne as the American Sean Thornton who comes home to forget his troubled past and the always beautiful red headed Maureen O'Hara (who was 31 at the time) as the single farm lass Mary Kate Danaher, along with Ward Bond (parish priest), Victor McLaglen (the Squire), Mildred Natwick (the Widow) and Barry Fitzgerald (busybody and matchmaker).  The rest of the casting was a case study in nepotism; besides the presence of Ford's brother Francis (Dan Tobin), Maureen O'Hara's two brothers Charles (Hugh Forbes) and James (Fr. Paul) were both pictured, along with Barry Fitzgerald's brother Arthur (Rev Playfair).  Even John Wayne's four children have a part with Maureen O'Hara on the day of the races and his makeup man, Webb Overlander, plays the role of the stationmaster.  For John Ford the film was the fulfillment of a dream commenting, ""I was all choked up at leaving our beloved Ireland and I was afraid that I would burst into tears, which I did on reaching my berth...Galway is in my blood and the only place I have found peace.""

The film is shot along the border of County Mayo and Galway, in northwestern Ireland, and is a wonderful look at the scenic beautiful and simplicity of the backcountry that is Ireland even today.  This beauty is evident in the natural conditions of the countryside shown during the film; also there are no special effects creating the winds, rains and the ever-present cloud cover in many of the scenes.  While the film is supposed to be set in about the 1920s and shot in 1951, the landscape still looks very much the same today as then.

Sadly, both of these DVDs are no better than a copy from a VHS tape and the quality suffers.  Why this timeless film was never remastered properly for DVD production is an unknown and a sorry way to treat what has become a classic movie.  The beauty that is evident in this film would be simply stunning in HD or Blu-Ray.  Buy the movie by all means for the beauty of Ireland and a John Ford classic film (5 Stars) but never pay full price for it under any circumstances until it is properly remade (3 stars).

1782167,5,B00006JMRD,This is such an enyoyable movie if you haven't seen it then you are missing one of lifes movie treasures.,1246665600,,105,4.3
1782168,5,B00006JMRD,"For John Ford and John Wayne, los hombres mas machos, THE QUIET MAN is them showing their softer side. This movie is absolutely my favorite John Ford film and one of my top favorite films starring the Duke. I'm not even remotely Irish and yet I can't help but get all mushy and nostalgic whenever this airs on the screen.

You're in for a surprise if you've only ever seen John Wayne take on those tough, rough-n-tumble man of action roles in all those wild westerns, war pictures, and cop dramas. THE QUIET MAN features a more introspective, more reflective John Wayne. He plays laconic but friendly Irish-American Sean Thornton, come to the tiny Irish village of Innisfree to flee a haunted past and find a measure of peace. But peace and quiet are hard to come by, even in this bucolic ancestral home. Sean Thornton is instantly smitten with the fiery lass Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), only to learn that winning her isn't at all a simple feat, what with the rigid local courtship customs and also that her brother is none other than that bullying and blustery landowner ""Red"" Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen). And ""Red"" Will Danaher thinks Thornton a coward and endlessly baits him, with Thornton reluctant to raise his fists. But when his continued passiveness threatens to lose him the respect of the community and of Mary Kate, it may just come down to Sean taking a stand, after all, and picking up them fists.

THE QUIET MAN is John Ford's big, corny valentine to his native Ireland, so it's not too surprising that we find ourselves in idealized sceneries, treated to picturesque cinematography and sentimental goings-on. THE QUIET MAN garnered Ford his fourth Oscar for directing, which must've been a huge ""In Your Face!"" to all the larger studios who gave the movie the fish eye. Instead, it was lowly ""B"" studio Republic Pictures which took a chance and bankrolled Ford's pet project, after, of course, first squeezing a little black & white western out of Wayne, O'Hara and Ford, so as to recoup whatever losses THE QUIET MAN might accrue. Well, not only did RIO GRANDE prove to be a financial success, but THE QUIET MAN, to the surprise of many, made a killing at the box office.

It's a delightful character study, enlivened by Ford's stock troop of actors, with Barry Fitzgerald and Ward Bond particular standouts as, respectively, the puckish matchmaker Michaleen Oge Flynn and Father Lonergan. The film is also a broad, whimsical comedy of manners which now and then gets upstaged by Wayne and O'Hara's tempestuous romance. Wayne's dashing Sean Thornton, by the way, should settle any doubts about whether the Duke can play meaty romantic leading roles. He and Maureen O'Hara ignite the screen.

And, of course, of course, it all culminates with a raucous, knock-down marathon brawl between Red Will Danaher and the finally fed-up Sean Thornton, to the rapture of the Innisfree community (who quickly begins placing bets). Before the donnybrook, though, one of the funniest moments in the film comes up, and never mind that it isn't too politically correct in this day and age. It's this: As Sean Thornton wrestles his departing Mary Kate off the train and then marches her all the long way home, an old woman emerges from the gathering onlookers and offers Sean a good-sized branch: ""Sir! Here's a good stick to beat the lovely lady."" Heh.",1246320000,,3365,4.826689774696707

Since obtaining the DVD from Amazon.com I can't get Maureen O'Hara's brilliant appearance with John Wayne out of my head. Wayne plays the part of a returning Irish exile, nursing a secret boxing past in Chicago - where he accidentally killed an opponent in the ring - and on arrival in Ireland is captivated by the beautiful O'Hara driving sheep across one of the many splendid landscapes in the movie. To obtain Maureen's hand in marriage, John Wayne has to reluctantly take up the boxing again - this time without gloves - to win O'Hara's brother's consent to the marriage. Funny yes; comedy - not entirely, though when the catholic village turns out en masse to support the local protestant vicar in a tricky situation, it is hillarious; romance - yes, in a special Irish way. The appearance of Barry Fitzgerald as chaperone for the courting couple, is precious.

It remains a John Ford classic and one of the funniest, most romantic and endearing movies of all time.

Remember what Orson Welles said when asked about his favorite movie directors: ""I studied under that masters, that would be John Ford, John Ford and, Oh, Yes, John Ford.""

John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara are perfect in their parts, but I admit my favorite character is Michaleen Flynn played by Barry Fitzgerald, a.k.a. matchmaker, a.k.a. best patron of the local pub. Even the priest and the pastor of the local churches show their human and humorous sides in this film. I've enjoyed it since I was a child.",1207699200,2,476,4.482758620689655

1782207,5,B00006JMRD,"As stated above, I consider this to be John Wayne's finest film
(just edging out The Searchers). There are many things to enjoy
about this movie . For one thing , the look of it. Shot in Ireland
in gorgeous, rich technicolor, director John Ford's insistance
to film there rather than the Hollywood backlots means this is
really an Irish film. When Barry Fitzgerald's character says
""ah, 'tis a nice, soft evening "", you can almost smell the soft
rain falling. There has never been a better Irishman in movies
than Barry Fitzgerald. To those of us who have seen this film
many times his lines & witty asides are a constant joy.
The casting throughout is superb from Ward Bond's catholic
priest to Victor Mclagen's alpha male. The chemistry between
John Wayne & Maureen O'Hara is natural & wonderful & must have
been a film they both remembered fondly . This is one of the
all-time great love stories & like ""Casablanca"" it's romance
is enhanced by everything else about it being perfect ----
direction, casting, location, dialogue & cinematography .",1206921600,2,1048,4.763736263736264
1782208,5,B00006JMRD,"Sean Thorton (John Wayne)was a former ex-boxer in America that had a bad experience in the ring accidently killing a man. He returns back to Ireland, his original hometown where he can forget all his troubles and settle for a new life in the town where he was raised. He falls for a lovely maiden named Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara) as they soon later fall in love with each other and conducts his courtship thanks to a impish matchmaker (Barry Fitzgerald), but her brother (Victor McLaglen) refuses to have them together even though Mary Kate and Sean later gets married, is that Sean has to pay him and that he knows about his dark past.

A wonderful and sometimes humorous glimpse to old Ireland thanks to director John Ford. This is a compelling romantic comedy-drama that has heart, great acting especially by John Wayne who is flawless as usual and the why this was actually filmed in Ireland was amazing especially the writing and direction. This film went on to become very successful and earned two academy awards especially for best cinematography, this is a real winner of a movie that is a must see especially for John Wayne fans.

This DVD contains very good remastered picture and sound with some quality extras like cast and crew info, ""The Making of the Quiet Man"" Featurette with Leonard Maltin, The Joys of Ireland documentary, Remembering The Quiet Man Montage, production notes, both original restored audio and enchanched original restored audio, Trailers to this and other Artisan/Lion's Gate releases and commentary by Maureen O'Hara.",1206748800,3,1554,4.927480916030534

Suffice to say -- This is one of Wayne's greatest acting jobs.
The Duke falling in love with Maureen O'Hara -- nothing could be more natural. Both providing outstanding acting in their roles. Superb.
Having half of Ireland conspiring to further his romantic interests is a slight twist.
John Ford's inherent ability to portray humanity is paramount.
An exceptional cast, from the dozen or so lead characters to the seemingly countless bit players who added depth and a 3-D feeling to the story.
And indeed, the real star -- rural Ireland in all its quaint glory.",1205798400,,632,4.861111111111111
1782213,5,B00006JMRD,"ESSENTIAL MOVIE!!! This is the one that John Wayne should've won the Oscar for Best Actor. John Ford, winner of the Oscar as the Best Director for this film, gets John Wayne to turn in the best acting performance of his career. It was rare that John Wayne portrayed a character but in this movie he proved to be far more than capable.

The Quiet Man is one of the great romantic movies of all time. It's also has one of the greatest fight scenes ever filmed. Both ladies & men will enjoy this one. The chemistry between John Wayne & Maureen O'Hara is electric. Victor McLaglen is fine as the older brother of O'Hara, certainly one of his greatest roles, especially at the end of his career. Barry Fitzgerald & Ward Bond are featured & they shine also.

You can tell John Ford had a love for Ireland, his birthplace, it shows in the way the movie was filmed. The scenery shines as much as the stars.  There are many scenes from this movie that are classics including the final 15 minutes of the film that has Wayne dragging O'Hara across the fields taking her back to McLaglen.

The Quiet Man has something for both male & female. Love, action & comedy abound in this well crafted movie Wayne portrays a boxer who has retired because he killed a man in the ring. The two things that Wayne no longer cares for, money & fighting, are the two things that seems to matter the most to O'Hara. It's when John Wayne is accused of cowardice by Maureen O'Hara that things come to a head.

The packaging claims that the movie has been digitally remastered &, though it looks pretty good, it doesn't look that good. This particular release has several bonus features that includes a documentary hosted by Leonard Maltin that is full of trivia. Maureeen O'Hara does a commentary & there's a montage feature. The audio has a restored track that's crisper & louder. This is a good value.

1782217,5,B00006JMRD,"I would like to preface my review by saying that this is a horrible transfer of an indispensible film.  Why doesn't the AFI ever list it with the top 100 American films?!  A film of this magnitude deserves the full Criterion treatment and not the shoddy way it's presented here by Artisan.  For sure there were a lot of trademarks to John Ford's films not leastly the whimsical humor in this Valentine to the people and land of Ireland.  Ford's irrepressible stock company (Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen, Mildred Natwick) have never been better and are complemented by the brothers Barry Fitzgerald and Arthur Shields.  This film has always been my father's favorite since I was a kid not ever really understanding why.  Revisiting it as an adult I saw something in ""The Quiet Man"" that would have flew over my head as a kid: an innocent sensuality.  Purists can have Bogie and Bacall or Tracy and Hepburn but for my tastes the most combustive screen couple there ever was were John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara.  View the scenes of them together.  For sure there is certain level of combativeness.  There's also a suggested longing between the two that the makers of today's more explicit love stories just wouldn't understand.  Three scenes stand out in my mind.  Firstly, the scene where Wayne's Sean Thornton seductively holds out Holy Water for O'Hara's Mary Kate Danaher can dip her pinkies in.  Secondly, the scene where Thornton and Mary Kate embrace at the graveyard during a rainstorm.  Lastly, the films closing scene where Mary Kate devilishly whispers something in Thornton's ear and they run back to the cottage grinning ear to ear.  Like the closing shot of Ford's ""The Searchers"" this is the perfect bookend to a cinematic treasure.",1200960000,,1741,4.854237288135593

1782220,5,B00006JMRD,"Although this is not billed as an educational show, it turns out that way. It teaches so much about the old Irish way of life: customs, songs, etc. The photography from the Emerald Isle alone makes this show worth seeing.

John Wayne plays an American boxer who has come to Ireland, the land of his ancestors, to escape his past. He had accidentally killed an opponent during a boxing match, and vowed never to fight again because of it.

He marries a local woman. But all is not well. She resents the fact that he won't challenge her brother for the dowry. He doesn't think that it is important. She certainly does! In time, she, and others, not realizing the motives behind his non-combative spirit, increasingly see him as a coward.

Her contempt for his apparent lack of a sense of honor becomes so great that she prepares to leave him. So what will he do? Hint: What would a John Wayne movie, whether a western or not, be without a good fight?",1198281600,4,948,4.468208092485549

The story is described well by other reviewers here. Wayne at his absolute best, matched beautifully by O'Hara, with a great supporting cast, wonderful score, great writing.

Earlier DVD versions of the film were of very poor quality. For years, fans of the film despaired of ever seeing the film that they knew and loved. But as of January,2013, our long wait is OVER!!

She tells fascinating and amusing recollections of the actors, the times and Ireland (she was born and raised in Dublin). I highly recommend watching the commentary after you have seen the movie.

1782233,3,B00006JMRD,"This raucously tongue-in-cheek, grand old movie has survived for what seems an eternity. The performances are so wonderful that every moment outshines a great many other classic films. So it seems a shame that I can't give TQM the 5 stars it deserves. But Artisan's Classic Edition DVD has far too many visual transgressions. The gorgeous bursts of color that won an Oscar for the 1952 release are almost totally absent in this third-rate digital print. The jacket blurb claims this is a ""remastered"" version; in fact it looks as if it were played on a cheap VCR; blurry, too dark (almost grimy and gritty at times), with no shadow detail whatever, color registration problems, badly oversaturated reds and blues, obvious flicker (odd for a ""remastered"" print), and with noise and digital artifacts galore. The blur and noise extend even into many segments of the added features. Looks out of focus on a good CRT monitor, and extremely annoying on highend LCD sets. On cheaper gear, it's nearly unviewable. I've seen comments in Amazon reviews saying that this edition looks better than earlier ones. Not true -- visually, they're all the same. On top of that, I have always had a problem with some oddities of John Ford's sense of humor: two big guys blasting each other with bare fists for the better part of an Irish afternoon isn't very funny, IMHO. In real life, these two would have spent a year in an IC ward recovering from wounds. It's likely that TQM will be one of many memorable films, like ""The African Queen"", that may never be seen in its original Technicolor glory. But it's to the movie's credit that despite the poor print, it remains an exceptional cinematic experience. The acting is superb in every way; Barry Fitzgerald and Ward Bond steal every scene they're in. Victor Young's music is beautiful, and the audio has the sweep and sweetness that I rememeber from 1952.

1782237,5,B00006JMRD,"For those who don't really dig John Wayne's ""shoot-em-up"" westerns, this is a refreshing drama which is set in Ireland.  The Irish charm of scenery and culture is breath-taking and touching.  Wayne plays a son of an Irish immigrant turned prize-fighter, who after accidentally killing a man in the boxing ring, gives up the fight-game and retires to his beloved birthplace which was evidently immortalized by his mother's continued remembrances of ""the old country"".  Maureen O'Hara plays the Irish lass who captures his heart and is just as tough and stubborn as he is.  They are a perfect match of which the entire village is in hearty agreement - except her brother.

Feminists won't like this movie by director John Ford as there is old-world male dominance prevalent in this movie.  The fight scene at the end is probably the fist-fight of all time which ""wallers-down"" most of the countryside.  The ""Fighting Irish"" are reputed to love a good fist fight and here it is shown to be true by the fact that almost everyone in the village is at the event and even people from the surrounding villages are enroute by the bus-loads.

Colorful characters, old-world charm, splendid and uplifting Irish folk songs, a great supporting cast, and romance decorate this 1952 favorite of mine.  Watch closely for the guy playing the accordion in the pub.  He is Ken Curtis who played, Festus, on the western TV Series, Gunsmoke.  He also sang with the Sons of the Pioneers way, way, back when - but he isn't even in the credits.

Want to be taken back to yesteryear?  This is it - and you'll love it -- if you're not a feminist.

While the Collector's Edition is blessed with the comments of Maureen O'Hara, both as an audio track and in a long featurette, someone apparently forgot to actually play the dvd before it was released to check the video quality. The print that ET was watching on TV while Eliot was in biology class looked better. The Republic VHS video has a very clear print off of the original negative. I was hoping this edition would improve on that or at least match it. But the video almost seems a little out of focus compared to the VHS tape.

The Irish custom of you ain't gettin' my booty if I don't get my dowry might be well practiced by some of today's young women in America. It might at least slow the mating process down a little. The supervised courtship and the role of the priests was downright comical at times. The entire small community set from the countryside to the pub to the fiddler on the green and the all county butt kickin' was superbly done. The extra's in the collector's edition especially the interview with Maureen O'Hara was very informative and adds to the value of the DVD.,1174348800,3,770,4.586956521739131

1782264,5,B00006JMRD,"""The Quiet Man"" is an Irish village version of ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" the tamer being an ex-pugilist Sean Thornton (John Wayne) retired to the land of his fathers where he purchases ""that little place across the brook, that humble cottage."" But no sooner does he arrives on a soft spring morning than he falls in love with Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara).

Sean courts and weds her easily enough, but he has not worked out on the anger of her heavy and hard rich brother, the farmer Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen) who holds an envy against him for having bought the very property that separates his spread from that of the wealthiest widow in Innisfree Sarah Tillane (Mildred Natwick) whom Danaher strongly desires...

Danaher refuses to supply the traditional dowry, and Mary Kate accuses Sean for his apparent cowardice in not fighting for what is rightfully theirs...

The battle that follows (considered to be the longest recorded on screen) has Sean and his strong brother-in-law engaging in a climatic fight the townsfolk have long been anticipating with effervescent...

Maureen O'Hara is totally in her element as the fiery Irish girl whether as the bare-footed attractive woman looking after a number of sheep in the meadow, or as the troubled colleen trying to explain her problem to the devoted salmon-catching Catholic priest (War Bond) or as the proud beauty whom Wayne lets fall at her brother's feet... Maureen would play Wayne's love interest in four more features (""Rio Grande,"" ""The Wings of Eagle,"" ""McLintock,"" and ""Big Jake""). Their screen relationship emphasized the strength of their chemistry...

Barry Fitzerald is simply superb as Michaeleen Flynn, the village matchmaker and cart-driver who can't seem to tell anyone something without winning a black beer from them first...

With an exciting Innisfree Races along the beach, a titanic fight from the farm, across the hillside, through a haystack and into a stream, and with emerald environments and great music, John Ford's romantic comedy is a marvelous entertaining film, painted beautifully, simply told with love and humor...

With 7 Academy Award Nominations, the film earns Ford his 4th and last Oscar for Best Director establishing a record which is still unbeaten and won another Oscar for the outstanding Technicolor for Best Cinematography...",1168473600,,2329,5.161803713527852

1782268,5,B00006JMRD,"John Wayne, like most of us, had a space in his heart for the joys of the fabled Emerald Isle.

It was one of his personal projects to star in this film and capture the spirit of old Ireland, and capture it he did.

This film features every element of the Irish fable; stern yet caring parish preists, picturesque stone houses, quick witted old men, beer guzzling brawlers, charming green fields, and beautiful redheaded maidens.  They all come alive to create a complete and stunningly pleasurable movie.

Like life in Ireland itself, the movie has a little of everything, comedy, romance, tragedy, and a good old Irish brawl for fun.

John Wayne, though best known for his westerns, did very well as the ex-boxer Sean Thornton, who returned to the country of his birth to start a new life.  Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) is the Irish damsel that captures his heart, and Will Danaher is her jealous brother who will do everything he can to stand in the way of their romance.

John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara create a splendid dynamic as Sean tries to convince Mary Kate that he is the right man for her.  It's quite fun to see their relationship unfold.

This is the kind of movie that will cheer you up.  Maybe you aren't interested in the long Irish brawl near the end of the film, but what can be more pleasurable to the eye than the beautiful Maureen O'Hara and the stunningly green Irish landscape?

If you are interested in seeing two stars interact with each other, that's another reason to watch this one.

If you've been bit by the Irish bug, or simply yearn for a film that fun and uplifting, then you can't go wrong with The Quiet Man.",1158192000,,1650,4.518518518518518

John Ford and his remarkable cast capture the spirit of that latter Ireland and spread it across the screen. Wayne and O'Hara are close to perfect, and the star-studded cast play their fabled Ireland beautifully. About the only quibble I have with the movie itself is that during the great donnybrook the film was speeded up to make the action faster, and it's pretty obvious.

A star or so off for the DVD transfer, where the green and red saturation are a bit high, and a number of single-frame artifacts  were left in. The first can be controlled with a bit of video adjustment, and the second isn't all that distracting - but why not do it right?

1782276,5,B00006JMRD,"Actually in a manner of speaking, this movie is an extraordinary success in spite of John Wayne. I love the Duke even when he acted out of character, as a detective or a deep sea diver. But he probably owed his presence in numerous films because of his presence in life. He was, odd as it may sound, larger than life. Being an actor was something he did almost as a hobby. Here, he is surrounded by capable actors, Fitzgerald, Bond, Maglaglen, O'Hara, Mildred Natwick whom you recognize from a hundred different roles. So that he 'hung in' with that crowd, is a credit to him, to his loyalty and to his friendship, to his joie vivre. But probably not his acting skill.

Everyone knows the story. Trooper Thornton, an up and coming U. S. heavyweight, kills a contender in the ring by accident but all the while as he, Sean Thornton, is pursuing money. So he quits the ring and journeys home to Ireland where his Mother was born.

Later he falls in love with Mary Kate Danaher (O'Hara), sister of the ill-tempered Will Danaher and probably equally foul tempered. All is well. There is a certain lust in the air between Wayne and O'Hara, at least as much as you can imagine in the 1950's. Three second kisses and not many of them. That's until Will, the big oaf, refuses to give Mary Kate her dowery and without it, she comes to Sean with nothing and hates herself and him for it. But to fight someone for money, which is what Mary Kate wants her husband to do, brings back the haunting shame Duke feels for killing a man in the ring.

All the good lines go to Fitzgerald who tells Mary Kate, ""Ay. You have the tongue of an Adder,"" and later, when he sees the broken marital bed not knowing that Sean threw Mary Kate in it and left in contempt of her mercenary wishes to sleep on the floor, Fitzgerald says, ""Homeric!""

It's a great great movie that most of us have seen 25 times and still get a good feeling over. Don't believe the careful analysis and scrutiny of some reviewers. Well photographed, a lot of laughs, no sex and no killing. Can you believe it? 5 stars. See the ""Collector's Edition"" DVD (ASIN: B00006JMRD) for better color, no splotchieness and better printing overall. Larry Scantlebury",1140220800,3,2201,4.467661691542289
1782277,5,B00006JMRD,"As much a tribute by director John Ford to his beloved Ireland as it is a wonderful love story between Sean O'Fienne (John Wayne) and Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara). Boxer Wayne returns to Ireland after killing a man in the ring and seeks a new life of tranquility. But he meets the beautiful O'Hara; they fall in love (some of the most romantic scenes on film are when Wayne and O'Hara are on screen together) and decide to marry. But because of a property dispute, her brother Will (Victor McLaglen) refuses to give her her dowry, and without it she feels unworthy of Wayne. He doesn't see the importance of it, though to her it's what puts her on an equal footing with him (she's a ""modern woman"" after all); she even accuses him of being a coward for not fighting her brother to get it. This, of course, moves Wayne to action, and the fight scene between Wayne and McLaglen is a highlight of the movie.

This is entertainment with a capital E, and it's Ford at his best. We're not thrown any surprises along the way, and Ford likes his stereotypes, but what we are offered is just so exquisite we can't help but enjoy the whole shebang. The photography is fabulous.

1782279,5,B00006JMRD,"I was never a fan of John Wayne, that is until I saw The Quiet Man.  This is one of the great films of the 1950's.  Instead of the wild west, this takes place in Ireland.

Sean Thornton (Wayne) was a prize fighter who left the ring behind after killing an opponent to return to the family home in Inesfree, Ireland.  When he is walking the country side he sees a beautiful red head Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara).  He again sees her at church and approaches her.  Of course he makes one mistake by getting on the bad side of her eldest brother Red Will (Victor McLaglen).

Will refuses to let Sean and Mary Kate court but the town intervenes.  Will finally agrees to let them court. This is the old fashioned courting with a chaperone.  But before you know it they were married.  At the wedding reception, Will proposes to the widow.  She refuses him and he causes a scene taking back the dowry.  Mary Kate will not leave without it, it's hers.  But Sean's pride is too big and he orders her to leave it.

This causes problems between the newlyweds until Sean makes an issue of it.  This starts a fist fight between Sean and Will.  This scene is the greatest fight scene EVER filmed.  It has action, excitement and most important humor.  At the end, Sean wins and the Will gives Mary Kate her dowry.

This is a film about the human spirit.  John Wayne gives his greatest performance ever.  Maureen O'Hara is luminous as always but more importantly, she is the perfect costar for Wayne.  There is a chemistry that only happened with one other actress, Lauren Bacall.  It's easy for someone to give a great performance but it shows true talent when you can draw a great performance from another actor, especially one that is not a great actor.

At Oscar time both Wayne and O'Hara were totally overlooked but Ford was named Best Director.  This is a great film that is a must see film.

DVD EXTRAS:

The Making of The Quiet Man - A 28 minute featurette with commentary by Leonard Maltin and Andrew McLaglen, telling of the making of the film from newspaper story to getting a studio to the actual filming with stock interviews.

I am now spoiled.  I use a high-definition projector and a 10 foot screen.  Most recent, and some old DVD's look wonderful on it.  For the most part, the experience is like going to a movie theater, no lines, great sharpness.  Even old black and whites look wonderful on this system.

I obtained the first transfer by Artisan and was shocked by the grotesque and constantly changing colors, and also the gross color fringing.  Most dark areas had a strong purple hew to them.  Color intensity was gross, greens bloomed out of the picture.  Sharpness was very poor.

The added featurettes were little better.  My over all impression was that this was some sort of amateur video company run by incompetants with anciend junk equipment.  However, it appears that Artisan actually has money enough to get the rights to a great deal of John Wayne material.

1782282,5,B00006JMRD,"John Ford's ""The Quiet Man"" takes you to the beautiful Irish countryside for a romantic-comedy and slice of folksy life.  Sean Thornton (John Wayne) has left America and returned to Ireland to settle in his ancestral home.  On his first day, he sees the lovely spinster, Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara), and makes up his mind to marry her.  She's more than willing, but the local customs must be observed, and Sean courts her with the help of the local marriage broker (Barry Fitzgerald).  All goes well, until Mary Kate's brother Will refuses to pay her dowry.  She is shamed and ashamed of Sean for not answering Will's challenge to a fist fight.  No one knows that Sean once killed a man in the boxing ring and has vowed never to fight again.

This is a lusty, entertaining movie thanks to the terrific chemistry and charisma of big John Wayne and spitfire Maureen O'Hara.  They are a perfect match and a joy to watch.  I didn't like Sean's manhandling of Mary Kate - I'm sure it was meant to be funny and earthy (it seemed barbaric to me).  But the scenery is lush and idyllic, the score is a merry collection of Irish folk tunes, and the feeling one gets from watching is that there would be no finer place on earth to live than the fairy tale village of Innisfree.

1782283,3,B00006JMRD,"The Quiet Man is more interesting than entertaining these days.  Interest stems from the manipulative techniques director John Ford used to sanitize the story's rather unpleasant heart, and from the psychology behind its characterizations.  Lifting the filter of Ford's sentimentalizing technique, at its core the film depicts the Irish as rustics, drunks and brawlers.  Women are nettlesome objects which, alas, must be dealt with.  How Ford manages to make all this seem entertaining is a combination of music, makeup, well-timed edits and the innate charm of some superb character actors, especially Barry Fitzgerald and Victor McLaglen.  Decades of hype to the contrary, there is no measurable electricity between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara.  Which ties into why the psychology behind the filmic interpretation of this story is particularly interesting:  O'Hara's recent autobiography claims that on a later film she caught  Ford in a liplock with Tyrone Power, and the DVD extras on this disk repeatedly mention how Ford purposely had Wayne drag O'Hara through ground full of manure, among other humiliations he sent her way.  Does a careful look at this movie tell us more about a tortured Irish-American's artistic soul than it does about a tortured Irish-American boxer?

The picture quality on this DVD is poor - it looks about the same as it does when the movie gets its annual St. Patrick's Day over-the-air TV broadcast.  I suspect that at some point in the future a remastered DVD package of this film will be done, hopefully with some honest and intelligent DVD extras.

I never get tired of watching this film. Released in '52, 'The Quiet Man' has withstood the test of time and now some fifty-three years later it's still one of the most beloved romance/comedies of all-time.

American icon John Ford's love hymn to the land of his ancestors deserves more respect than has been accorded it. On the plus side, the extras on the disk--which are listed under DVD Features, so there's no point in my reiterating them--are informative and enjoyable.
A must-see film, but it deserves to be seen in all its glory.",1126569600,6,698,5.185840707964601
1782286,5,B00006JMRD,"When Director John Ford (whose real name was Sean O'Feeney) first proposed that a film be adapted from the book ""The Quiet Man"", studio heads in the 1940's dismissed it as a ""simple little Irish story"" that would be a financial bomb at the box office.

Ford undoubtedly envisioned the opposite. He pictured lush landscapes of the emerald isle, peppered with the culture and customs of the Irish -- their religious convictions, their language, their pubs, their music, their blarney. He saw a sentimental story of an Irish-American prize fighter returning to the land of his birth, wishing to escape a past tragedy in the ring, falling in love and marrying a local lass, only to have his hope of a blissful life nearly thwarted by a pugnacious brother-in-law. Foremost of all, he had the good sense to assemble a formidable cast of actors, including John Wayne as Sean 'Trooper' Thorton, Maureen O'Hara as Mary Kate Danaher, Victor McLaglen as Will Red Danaher , Ward Bond as Father Lonigan (narrator of the story) and Barry Fitzgerald as Michaeleen Flynn. Idealistic? Perhaps, but what a grand film it is!

One cannot help but admire John Ford's genius. Many of the scenes are technically and visually arresting for a film made in 1951. Follow the camera as it pans across the Irish coastline when the local derby is underway. Catch the simmering sensuality Wayne and O'Hara feel for one another as they embrace, kiss and the rain pours down, drenching Wayne's translucent silk shirt. Watch O'Hara chat up Ward Bond in Gaelic while he stands knee deep in a glistening pond fly-fishing. Join the town's folk as Wayne takes O'Hara in tow at the train station and drags her across the land, kicking and swinging. See the rollicking donnybrook as McLaglen and Wayne duke it out across the countryside. Scenes like these take hold of the senses and fire the imagination. The viewer believes he is in Ireland. And when the cast curtsey and wave adieu at the end of the film, we are lured once more into believing the story and the people are genuine.

Ford knew how to pluck the heartstrings of an audience. And this 2-DVD collector's edition reveals how he accomplished this feat. In addition to his Oscar-winning movie, a number of special segments delve into the history and making of ""The Quiet Man"". Leonard Maltin explores the origin of the ""The Quiet Man"", how Ford struggled for years to get the film made with studio bosses, then ended up at Republic Pictures on the condition he make the western ""Rio Grande"" to cover any financial loss incurred from ""The Quiet Man"". An archived interview with Wayne and Ford underscores their mutual respect and friendship. Interviews with Maureen O'Hara, Andrew V. McLaglen (son of Victor McLaglen) and Patrick Wayne are equally insightful and nostalgic. Biographies and movie credits of the cast are included as well in this DVD set.

Haunted by an incident that happened in the ring, American boxer Sean Thornton (John Wayne) returns to his Irish birthplace, seeking only his roots and a quiet, peaceful life.

He soon falls in love with the beautiful, tempestuous Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara). She is equally taken with him, but won't marry without the consent of her stubborn, blustering brother, Will (Victor McLaglen), who disapproves the match.

With the help of a well-intentioned scheme arranged by their friends, Mary Kate gets her brother's permission and Sean and she wed. Relationships spoil soon after, however, when Will refuses to pay the rightful dowry. Sean doesn't care, but Mary Kate is outraged and wants Sean to have it out with Will.

Time and again Sean backs down - determined not to use his fists - his inner tension building the whole while. But eventually he will have to decide between losing his wife's love and respect and facing his greatest fear.

This was an important and personal project for John Ford (whose real name was Sean O'Feeney). That his heart and those of his cast members were in what they were doing shows through. The fact that much of the film was shot on location in Ireland (on location shoots were somewhat unusual at the time) also adds an authentic flavor.

Barry Fitzgerald was at his comedic best here, and Ward Bond's performance as a priest has several simply unforgettable moments.

The Quiet Man is a charming classic and among Ford's best (in fact, it won him an Oscar for Best Director). It's funny, romantic, and always entertaining. It also features an exuberant score (courtesy of Victor Young) and one of the longest and most memorable knock-down, drag-out fights ever committed to film.

-DVD-

Two different editions of this DVD have been released with almost
identical packaging. Be careful which one you buy! (I wish I'd known this).

""John Wayne Collection"" edition (*1 star)

This is the one I bought (ISBN 0-7820-1057-1, ASIN: B00000I1KV). It has ""John Wayne Collection"" printed on a green band at the top. Its special features include ""The Making of the Quiet Man"" documentary & the theatrical trailer. DON'T BUY THIS VERSION, PLEASE. The sound is decent, but the picture is absolutely terrible: blurry and full of splotches, almost unwatchable.

""Collector's Edition""

Apparently, the sound and picture quality are okay on the ""Collector's Edition"" DVD (ASIN: B00006JMRD), whose special features include Commentary by Maureen O'Hara, the theatrical trailer, ""The Joy of Ireland"" documentary with Maureen O'Hara, ""Remembering The Quiet Man"" Montage, and ""The Making of The Quiet Man.""",1092873600,643,2649,5.076036866359447

It seems to be after the Irish Revolution, but before the First World War.  I say before the war because the movie never references the awful loss of life that traumatized every European nation that experienced it.  Any later than that and you would wonder where the planes and cars would be.
It is a good love story, but the whole concept of dowry and the stubborn character shown by the whole Danaher clan would be mysterious to the younger American generation, as would the purpose of a matchmaker and the formal courting rituals that the movie sends up.
John Wayne is quite fine in this role as is the whole cast.  It is a very enjoyable film with a lot to recommend it for the family.  It will certainly spark some discussion with the kids that might be helpful and broaden their cultural horizons.",1089590400,4,937,4.482352941176471

Sean Thornton (John Wayne) returns to Ireland to live after living most of his life in the states. He sees Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara) from a distance and is instantly smitten.  Later they marry and trouble brews when her brother refuses to pay the dowry. Sean doesn't care, but to Mary Kate it is a point of honor. While in the states Sean was known as Trooper Thornton a boxer who accidently killed a man in the ring. He would rather not fight the brother over the dowry ,but you guessed it, he does and it is one of the greatest fist fights on film. This film has great comedy scenes like the priest trying to land his great fish, Sean walking  Mary Kate home from the train station, and the old man,(Ford's brother), on his death bed leaping up when he hears the fight.
Maureen O'Hara had family in Ireland and John Wayne brought his with him, in fact there were family all over the set with a few making it into the film as extras. Most of the actors had worked together a year earlier making ""Rio Grande"" with Ford because the studio wouldn't make ""The Quiet Man"" without a western that would make money first. All the film Studio executives felt ""The Quiet Man"" would never make money.

But that's a widely known statement, and there are lots of well written reviews around already. What a prospective buyer of this DVD most probably wants to know is: how good the DVD transfer is?
Well, I would answer this using a single word which would accurately express what you will find if you buy this one -in fact, I *UTTERED* that very word shortly after I slipped this DVD inside the player and pressed the play button- but I'm afraid this review would be banned if I did so. So, to make a short story long, I'll say that the DVD transfer is pitiful. Terrible. It looks like if they had used some (poor) VHS tape as a master and fiddled with the color sliders, so what you finally have is a blurry picture with annoying, garish colours which results in a completely disappointing and shameful viewing experience, to say the least. I'll have to treasure my VHS copy which -sad but true- has got far more decent colour and definition.
  It's a pity that a classic of this calibre had been mistreated this way -they even packed it lavishly with a nice carton frame with an engraved ""Collector's Edition DVD"" silver badge which completes the mockery. I expected far more from Artisan, as I had previously bought their excellent DVD edition of ""High Noon"", with razor sharp picture, THX certification and all the bells and whistles. So I feel completely cheated and worried, not just because of the 17'99 bucks down the drain, but, most of all, for the fact that once a film has been released on DVD, chances that it'd be released again soon, in a *PROPER* condition, become scarcer.
By the way, permit me a brief remark about the fact of how surprisingly poor are DVD versions of John Ford pictures: exception made for three excellent DVDs -The Searchers (Warner), The Man who Shot Liberty Valance (Paramount), and How Green was My Valley(Fox)- the rest of John Ford's filmography on DVD has been, as far as I know, released in dreadful condition regarding image and sound. Which is hard to believe, when it comes to one of the most relevant directors in the History of Filmmaking. Let's hope things begin to change soon and we could enjoy his films, for once and all, in their full glory.",1063065600,28,2364,4.65311004784689
1782324,5,B00006JMRD,"Okay, here we go. I've loved all things Irish for several years now, and this film quickly joined the ranks of my favorites even though I was not expecting it to, but there you have it. After all, I mostly knew John Wayne courtesy of old Western movies, and usually I don't like those kinds of things. This movie taught me to take another look at  things I may not like and give them a chance. I grew QUICKLY to LOVE this movie. What else can I say? The location photography in Ireland is lovely. The DVD transfer undoubtedly helps this. It lets you see Ireland alive in all her resplendent glory, the way God intended her to be seen. The music is lively in some places and poignant in many as well. The little touches like men almost constantly singing in the bar and during the wedding sequence, to me captured greatly just how deeply music and song is embedded in the hearts, souls and blood of Ireland's people.
  Then there is the humor and warmth. Plenty of genuinely funny moments (such as a priest battling so passionately  to catch a fish, the ""bed-breaking"" moment and many more), and warmth. Wayne's character is made welcome almost instantly upon coming to Ireland to escape his inner demons. Welcome, that is by all people except one.
  I'd like to touch on something here. To me, the romance and love story in this was done brilliantly. It is passionate and romantic without being lewd or explicit. Also, to me in some places it's downright funny (Mr. Flynn trying to be suave when talking to Mary Kate about Sean when he's clearly drunk, and in trying to make sure that Sean and Mary Kate behave themselves later on). It may seemed rushed to some, but not to me. After all that IS how courting in Ireland and many places used to be done.
So there you have it. A beautiful-looking film that is acted splendidly. There is music to touch the ears and soul  and the heart as well with joy and longing and beauty. There is nice sweet romance without lewd things cluttering it up. And, lest we forget, all this is capped by one of the best donnybrooks (a massive and often hillarious fistfight between Sean Thornton and ""Red"" Will Danaher) that was ever caught on film.
  Well, what else can I tell you. I love this. Give it a chance, you just might love it too. Peace, and God bless you and yours, always.",1059782400,3,2315,4.441037735849057
1782325,3,B00006JMRD,"This movie was one of John Ford's most personal, and he struggled to find the funding to do it since the studios saw this as ""just another love story"".  ""The Quiet Man"" is a fantastic love story, with wonderful scenes (the famous ""windy kiss""), classic lines, and snappy humor.
Be warned, however, that even in the ""Collector's Edition"" DVD, the picture quality is terrible, especially if compared with the restored ""Singin' in the Rain"", which was released the same year.  It is grainy and sometimes blurry, and the color vacillates in intensity.

At the time, was born in me a fire for my heritage and home, this movie captures the traditions of the people and essence of what was Ireland. This is a mystical journey of a poor and proud people, their country and what is important to their lives. I wish that today's Ireland was the same as it was in the movie. This is my number one movie of all time, it takes me home.

1782327,1,B00006JMRD,"Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. John Wayne as Sean Thornton is not a likable character in this film, in fact he is detestable. And such stereotypes! Maureen O'Hara plays the fiery redheaded Mary Kate Dannaher who has the worst temper imaginable. Has anyone who liked this film actually been to Ireland? My guess is no, because the film bears no resemblance to actual Irish life, regardless of the era. My advice, pass it by...",1053907200,6,443,4.6923076923076925
1782328,1,B00006JMRD,"""The Quiet Man"" is a tender story of a newcomer to a Welsh village.  It stars John Wayne, in a rare tender performance opposite one of his best co-stars - the lovely and luminous, Maureen O'Hara.
Aside: I first saw this movie on late night television, some fifteen years ago.  It looked as though it were fed through a meat grinder.  I next had the opportunity to view, what was then billed as a restored version of, this movie during the early 1990's.  While there was a marked improvement in the quality of the print shown on the big screen it remained an evident fact that much more work was required to get this movie looking right.  So when Artisan Home Entertainment announced a completely remastered collector's edition, my heart lept.  I was, after all, expecting a print that would really knock my socks off.
What I got was a DVD that looks more like my memory of the original television broadcast than the theatrical experience.  ""The Quiet Man"" looks awful.  There's no polite way to critique the excessively soft, blurry and dull image quality presented throughout.  Colors are poorly balanced with inconsistant flesh tones.  Black and contrast levels are so poorly realized that I can't deduce whether the staff at Artisan actually did some restoration work or are just trying to bluff the consumer into repurchasing this film on DVD.  Regardless, this is the worst looking DVD experience I've had in a long while.  The audio is mono, strident and wholly unsatisfying.  Edge enhancement, pixelization, aliasing and shimmering of fine details are obtrusive and an eye-sore to behold.
Extras: I'll be honest.  After sitting through this dismal visual experience I was so disheartened I didn't even get to the extra features.  Artisan advertises a documentary and audio commentary as part of the deal.  Let's just leave it at that.  Although, they did also advertise this DVD as digitally remastered?!?!

1782329,1,B00006JMRD,The picture quality of this DVD transfer is such an absolute disaster that I feel I should be entitled to get my money back.

1782330,2,B00006JMRD,"I cannot believe that they went to all the trouble to restore this classic and then chopped the sides off to make it fit a television screen.  I am very disappointed.

1782331,5,B00006JMRD,"When one thinks of John Wayne they usually imagine Calvary, Indians and the Old West. But John, on occasion, did venture into other areas. In this instance, Ireland, and produced one of his most beloved films. It teams him with long time friends, Maureen O'Hara, Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen, Arthur Shields and Barry Fitzgerald (Shields & Fitzgerald were real life brothers), in a project that was near and dear to John Ford. If you think the old town patriarch resembles Ford, it's with reason - it was his father. Stocked with wonderful Irish character actors like David Farrar and Sean McClory, the ever delightful Jack MacGowan, Ken Curtis (Festus of TV's Gunsmoke as Dermot Fahy uncredited and singing! Former Sons of the Pioneers!!), Mildred Natwick as the Widow Tillane, along with Wayne's kids at the horse race scene.
Wayne is Sean Thornton, a quite peace loving man come home to Ireland. There is much speculation about the Yanks and why he has returned to the wee humble Irish village where his family was from. He was a fighter in the States named Trooper Thornton, but accidentally killed a man in the ring. Haunted by this he wants to go 'home' to his mother's Ireland and find peace. But his factious neighbours do not understand his reluctance to take on the town Bully Red Will Danaher in order to win the love of his wife O'Hara.
Often this movie is criticised as being the ""Brigadoon"" of Ireland, and that is so, but it's the Ireland of our hearts and imagination and obvious of Ford's heart and imagination. The dialogue is Witty, full of Irish quirkiness. Beautiful location work and the dynamite teaming of O'Hara and Wayne. With marvelous songs like Turalye Anne, Galway Bay, Isle of Innisfree and The Humour is On Me Now and more ( There is a soundtrack available on CD this movie as well).
For many years the version on VHS was a pale washed out copy, but this version gives you the 40 shades of green of Eire and the brilliant red hair of O'Hara, they way it should be. The DVD is so sharp, it's truly like seeing it for the first time.
At this steal of a price, every DVD should have a copy.

1782332,5,B00006JMRD,"I waited a while before buying this DVD.  What finally spurred me to do it was the audio commentary by Maureen O'Hara.  Let me say here and now that I am so glad I did buy it.
As a story, The Quiet Man has a bit of everything with some adventure, some romance, some minor violence, some humor and a whole lotta heart.  As a DVD, this one is right up with some of the most up-to-date, extra-feature laden ones out there.  I loved the new documentary ""The Joy of Ireland"" as well as the movie commentary with Ms O'Hara.
This DVD has restored audio which only enhances the movie.  I'm not sure that much of anything can be done about the picture quality - my VHS tape was the exact same and it has been the same for every screening I've ever seen of this movie.  I really believe that the film, cameras and audio at that time just can not be improved upon, even by today's technology possibly just due to the age and quality of the film then.  There are lots of little mistakes that audiences today would never `go for' that had to have been just edited like that back in 1951, like words in speeches being sound-edited out but not redoing the scene and the sound of the words being sung not matching the mouth movements.
I enjoyed listening to Maureen O'Hara's comments through the film although she did tend to repeat herself a bit (but, come on, she's in her 80s!).  Still even that was endearing as she relived those happy times and reminisced about her many friends, most of whom she's lost over time.  She often would point out her brothers or other cast member's family when they appeared on screen, she translates Mary Kate's confession to Father Lonergan (finally, now I know!) and gives interesting insights about director John Ford.  I found the cost of the DVD worth it in that information alone.
This a moving and wonderful movie.  The DVD format allows you to view the movie that much more often without having to worry about ruining your tape by too much rewinding as well as allowing us a peek into the lives and times of the people who made such a fantastic film.",1047427200,7,2077,4.396866840731071

1782335,5,B00006JMRD,"Not being a huge John Wayne fan, I was introduced to ""The Quiet Man"" by my Grandmother.  It ended up being a good flick, and alot of fun all around.  I have often heard of ""The Quiet Man"" being called the ""different"" John Wayne film, and maybe this is so.  It lacks much of the brutish machismo that I associate with the actor, and has a good spirit instead.
Maureen O'Hara is great as the spunky Irish lass,  Mary Kate Danaher.  Her character is as perplexing as it is fun.  John Wayne is Sean Thorton, a former Irish, now American seeking the peace of his home town.  This is definitely Hollywood's romantic 1950's view of Ireland, full of smart-tongued men with smiling eyes and a belly full of beer and hot-tempered red-haired lasses looking for a real man to tame them.  It is alot of  fun if you don't take it too seriously or look too closely into the plot.  Much like ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" in that way.
Of course there are hijinks and mishaps, and the whole thing ends in a classic brawl, maybe the best filmed brawl I have ever seen.  Thanks Gran!",1039305600,2,1068,4.370558375634518
1782336,3,B00006JMRD,"Maureen O'Hara is my favorite actress. I own the 40th anniversary VHS edition of The Quiet Man. When I saw that 2002 'Collector's Edition', I was ecstatic and bought it right away. I had rented the first DVD edition and it was pretty bad. But I am even more  disappointed with this 'Collector's Edition'.
First of all: This is supposed to have been digitally remastered, but the picture is just a little bit better than the VHS copy, so what gives?
Second: it's supposed to be the 'Original Theatrical Version', but where is the original theatrical ratio (a.k.a. Widescreen)?
Third: The Quiet Man is a classic John Ford movie and should have been treated as such. Too bad.
This DVD editon isn't all bad, though. The extras are a definite plus:
1. The making of the Quiet Man, by Leonard Maltin, as on the VHS copy, is good.
2. Remembering the Quiet Man Montage is OK. I would have preferred traditional Irish music.
3. The Joy of Ireland is a 30 minute documentary with Maureen O'Hara; it's an excellent look back with reminiscences and footage of and from the movie.
4. An excellent audio commentary with Maureen O'Hara.
That's why this DVD version gets only 3 stars, but The Quiet Man is still my favorite Maureen O'Hara/John Wayne movie.
I'm looking forward to see a definitive version, (a Criterion Collector's Edition?), with all the extras present here and sound and picture quality to boot.",1036972800,8,1397,4.725409836065574
