7756245,5,B01G6GWHT8,An excellent look at what it takes to survive in a hostile environment! My wife is taking a trip overseas and this is on the must watch list for her.,1467072000,3,149,4.0
7756246,5,B01G6GWHT8,"Watching this video was like eating a multiple course dinner! And wanting more. Jack Richland shows you how to get out of more jams than a judge at a county fair
So I recently watched this video, And some Parts were re watched simply to ensure redundant actions. So it eventually becomes secondary nature in a primary situation, muscle memory if you will. There's no ''frills'' in this video just a dark gritty reality of what could/can happen at any given time. I especially liked the 3 tier layering for your Edc. How to layer escape and evasion tools on oneself, And to evade your captors is probably one of the most important core tool that he offers in his video. Knowing you or your loved ones are put in harms way, What would you be willing to do??? How far would you go to ensure the safety of yourself or the people you care about??? Paying attention to your surroundings is paramount, and Jack nails it.
My closing thoughts are a lot of people have this fantasy about being a Rambo or a Jason Bourne, that in a grid down scenario, Where chaos would in sue they would be ready. These keyboard Commandos are in for a reality check. This isn't something that you simply imagine and think '' I'll make it.'' No amount of tools will help you in any situation if you don't know how to use them. Practice makes perfect. Jack demonstrates this, Day in and day out on. You have to get dirt under your nails. I remember the very first video I watched of Jack's it was ''The Ultimate Bug out bag'' And I was instant Subscriber. I have learned a lot for him and his videos. I'm not ashamed to admit it but I never even heard of a fire can till I watched his video's or the Layering of Redundant items weather it be in your Fire KIts, Bug out bag, Edc/Get home bag. Mind you I was always a pay attention to detail kinda fella... Know I can proudly say that I know more in the last year than I thought ever possible...",1467072000,4,1914,4.290055248618785
7756247,5,B01G6GWHT8,Great dvd! Skills and techniques that are application in a widely diverse environment. Jack Richland is an outstanding instructor in the field of survival training.,1467072000,3,164,5.6
7756248,5,B01G6GWHT8,"Dont let the price tag on this detour you from buying this DVD, its worth every cent. What makes it worth it is cause these are not just opinions stated here, Jack has the military background to know what he's talking about and has lived it. So basically your getting all the info that he and many others like him worked for many years to obtain. If you want to be above the curb when someone seeks to do you and your family harm, this DVD is the way to learn it. It may just save your life! For me a few dollars is nothing compared to having the skills to protect myself and my family in a situation when it counts. Dont take my word though, check it out yourself! Needless to say im really impressed!",1467072000,3,702,4.131386861313868
7756249,5,B01G6GWHT8,"A dvd anyone interested in urban escape and evasion MUST have!! Very helpful information and skills to learn, taught by Jack Richland, an expert in the domain, in a very professional format, filmed by the experts of survival production: the survival summit! Brilliant",1467072000,4,267,5.232558139534884
7756250,5,B01G6GWHT8,This is a great DVD and so much information I watched three or four times when I first received it. Black Scout Survival and Survival Summit are the real deal. I have read many book and watch many of the DVDS out there on this subject and found this DVD to be at the top.,1467072000,3,271,3.9454545454545453
7756251,5,B01G6GWHT8,This video was so informative. The time and effort placed into this was greatly appreciated. Having the knowledge is a must in the world we live in. This video is highly recommended for anyone looking to keep you and your family safe. Don't forget to subscribe to the Black Scout Survival youtube channel as well. Always a pleasure to watch and learn.,1467072000,4,351,4.67741935483871
7756252,5,B01G6GWHT8,As a woman I purchased this DVD to gain insight and learn techniques to better protect me from the horrific events we see nightly on the news. Jack's teaching method was so concise and he took it step by step. I was amazed at what I could do after just watching the DVD once. As I continue to watch and practice I feel empowered. Also the first 15 mins are worth the price of the DVD alone. Be sure to have a pad and pencil handy because he will blow your mind with the tips he gives at the beginning. Highly Recommend!!,1467072000,4,520,4.107843137254902
8762427,4,B01G6GWHT8,Informative and to the point. Not professional appearing or sounding but it gets to the point. Excellent especially for Urban Survival.,1508716800,,135,5.476190476190476
8762428,5,B01G6GWHT8,Product and service exceeded my expectations. A+++++,1498608000,,52,6.571428571428571
8762429,5,B01G6GWHT8,"Okay - first I don't expect to be kidnapped soon - but if a were I would want to look at this video first. The ""Black Scout"" (forgot his name) guy knows all about things most people never are aware of - like how easy it is to pick locks or get out of handcuffs. All sorts of stuff like blending in during dangerous times, etc. So what makes this better than the 2 million other survival / zombie apocalypse vids out there?

This guy is basically practical and reasonably sane - A few of these things you could actually use or could be helpful if there really was a problem (floods, dams, earthquake, prolonged rioting, etc. - that cause social disruptions)

Its more urban survival oriented than wilderness survival (be real - how many of us are gonna run away to the state park during the apocalypse)

It is fun to watch and makes you think a little.",1487808000,3,851,4.339622641509434
8762430,5,B01G6GWHT8,"I must, first, note that I was very excited to receive the Survival Escape and Evasion DVD.  I put off buying it for months, after first learning about this DVD approximately six months ago, to allow my wife to find me some stocking stuffers for Christmas knowing that spouses are hard to shop for.  Having said that, I think it's a great DVD - a definitively good introduction.  Second, most all of the content seen is available on the Blackscout Survival YouTube channel that Jack Richland hosts.  Granted, it's not the same production quality or staging as the DVD, yet most of the content is there if you look around for it.  Is the DVD worth the price?  Yes, but if you're cash strapped you have alternatives, and I think the content present is better than Jason Hanson's video which, until recently, had been unlawfully posted on YouTube.  (He's got a nice book though.)  What I really like about the Richland/Survival Summit DVD I'm reviewing is that all of the information is available in one short viewing so you can force your spouse, children, etc to watch it, and I feel the DVD is more attention grabbing.  This makes it almost invaluable for me, personally.  There's a knot tying bonus video at the end of the DVD, but I haven't watched that yet because I haven't walked to my storage supply and retrieved any cordage to work with.  Admittedly, I've never been a good knot guy.  It seems a lot of the video surrounds lock picking, literally, as a good ""chunk"" of the ""middle"" of the DVD deals with lock picking, handcuff picking, etc, padlock shimming and bypassing, et al.  I'd like to have seen more urban movement, urban camouflage, social engineering content, and practical methods of exercising one's (environmental, personal, and cultural) situational awareness.  Clearly, you have to buy the gear mentioned in the video and practice with it, and even if you develop the skills they're certainly perishable. It's a good intro and worth the small price.  Buy all three of Clint Emerson's books, give them a read, watch this video, and you've got a pretty good base to start with regarding domestic and international urban survival.",1482969600,,2150,4.788617886178862
8762431,5,B01G6GWHT8,"This dvd is a great learning resource for someone that already has basic survival and self defense skills. The skills taught are a great addition to anyone, including those already with a solid foundation of knowledge. Even people with a medium to high level of training will learn something......",1471737600,2,297,5.081632653061225
8762432,1,B01G6GWHT8,My group and I are now dumber having watched the first 30 minutes of this video. It's a good thing he explains phones can send text messages. That's going to help in a survival situation.,1471651200,,187,4.371428571428571
8762433,5,B01G6GWHT8,"Great video packed with tons of ways to get out of any predicament you might be in.  With hostage situations and danger lurking around every corner, this DVD will get you prepared for the worst.  Great camera work and techniques make for an excellent purchase to keep you out of harm's way!",1467158400,2,290,4.5576923076923075

While I have attended many mindset, self defense, and firearms courses over the years, this remains as an excellent resource as not only does it much more then that shared in many of those courses, it is also teaching that can be repeated in the comfort of my home.  One aspect of this that I especially like is that Jack presents each concept in a simple enough way that even my kids can understand it enough for the foundation of a good mindset to be laid.  As a homeschooling family, this DVD is used as curriculum for part of their Physical Education studies.  I cannot recommend this resource highly enough.",1467158400,3,1110,6.47972972972973
8762435,5,B01G6GWHT8,"I bought this as an earlier release by the creator; don't worry paid full price so no incentive;

It is well done, excellent quality, and has great information presented in a practical and easy to understand format. It should be one you should watch, very practical.",1467072000,3,266,4.782608695652174
8762436,5,B01G6GWHT8,I'm a soldier in an SF unit and a Fed cop.  From my experienced perspective this DVD's content is rock solid and spot on.  I highly suggest anyone interested in purchasing this video do so already.,1467072000,3,197,4.444444444444445
