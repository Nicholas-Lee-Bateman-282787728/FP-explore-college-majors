8543294,5,B009OCR0Z8,I used the Potty Time Watch and DVD with our son and he absolutely loved it!  It was a very useful tool in helping him completely potty train.  I highly recommend it and would use it again!,1468022400,,189,4.081081081081081

8543296,2,B009OCR0Z8,"My daughter (2yr old) loves signing time videos and it was time to start potty training her so thought this would be a good starting point.  I was VERY disappointed.  Several comments on likes/dislikes:
1.  I was under the impression it would have some guidance about potty training.  Not necessarily to the parents, but some fun songs explaining what it feels like when you have to go and what you do when you sit on the potty and that kind of stuff.  NOTHING!  All it is is a song about having an amazing body (don't learn anything); a song telling you to potty, wipe, flush, wash but no explanation as to what each step really is, just the words; a song about have accidents (this one wasn't too bad of a song if your kid gets upset when having accidents); and a congrats you did it song.

2.  The songs do teach you signs for things like potty, accident, amazing, and a few others.  So if your child is starting potty training early or isn't talking too much yet, this might be helpful.  Not so much for us since my daughter already can say the words fairly clearly and already learned the sign for potty.  You can look up the signs on line and teach your kid the words you want and save yourself $$.

3.  I have mixed feelings about the CD.  I think it is way more useful than the DVD.  You can have it playing in the car or when your just hanging at home and maybe it will keep your kid thinking about potty time and if they have to go.  It can also help them learn the songs so maybe you can sing them when your kid has an accident or something.  But it is just the same songs as on the DVD, twice.  The first time it is the whole song, and then it goes through them again as sing-along versions.  All this means is they took out the signing-time lady's voice and it's just the instruments and the kids background singing.  So basically your kid should be able to sing the songs to really get any use out of this half of the CD, and if they can sing the songs on their own without hearing the lyrics, then they are probably far enough along they don't need sign language.  So I wonder, what age group are they targeting for this product?

4.  The CD is much quieter than any of my daughters other CDs so I have to crank the volume up to hear it, only to get blasted when we switch CD's.  Not a huge problem, but still annoying.

5.  Several things wrong with the watch.  I was expecting there to be something in the DVD about using the watch to help remind you to go.  Maybe even a suggestion of how best to use the watch.  But no, there is nothing related to the watch in the DVD at all except that a couple of the kids in the video are wearing one.  It's not really tied in to the DVD at all!  Basically, all the watch does is let you set a timer for 30, 60, or 90 minutes and at the end of the time it plays a song.  Not even any of the potty time songs, just normal standard kids songs that every other toy plays.  In addition, it is poorly made.  I had to take it apart and adjust it a bit so that when you press the green set button it actually triggers the button inside. Even then, I still have to press in hard with my nail in order to activate it - not very kid friendly!

All in all, if you just want some songs somewhat related to potty and body in general for your kid to watch/listen to, then this may be good for you (though may want to get the version without the watch).  If you want something to aid in potty training, don't bother.  There are plenty other videos and books out there that have got to be better than this.

UPDATED:  My daughter loves watching this DVD - she actually sits still when watching it which is impressive since she hasn't stopped moving since she was born (at least it feels that way).  But my rating still stands because it isn't the subject matter that makes her like it, it is just that the songs are catchy I think.  So I get some quiet time from the DVD but it doesn't do anything to help us move forward in potty training which is the real reason I bought it.",1410307200,2,4017,4.098717948717948
8543297,5,B009OCR0Z8,My 2 year old son loves this video. He watched it one time and then he went straight to the potty and peed and pooped. I could hardly believe it.,1399939200,,145,3.8666666666666667
