5172565,5,B008OHV4PG,"I have heard Neil Young's music my whole life, but am just now getting into him at the age of 47!  I was completely blown away by the audio quality of this video.  OK, some of the close ups made me think of Yoda rockin' out.  But hey, there is nothing wrong with being a Jedi Master of rock n' roll.  I highly recommend this video for die hard fans, newbies like myself and especially to anyone who has ever picked up a guitar",1352505600,,426,4.035714285714286
5172566,4,B008OHV4PG,"Journeys is a pretty good film. It includes some amazing Performances from the Twisted Road tour and also some behind the scenes of Neil Young. I expected to have more of the driving and stories about Young's ""Journeys"", but the info included was quite funny and entertaining. The concert is amazing, except for a couple songs. ""Down By The River"" and "" Hitchiker"" have a strange camera shot that focuses on Young's jawline and mouth and does not show much to any guitar work. This was a strange use of camera work. It seems to be a mini cam placed on the mic stand. All in all, this is not as good as Rust Never Sleeps. It ranks up with Heart of Gold. Heart of Gold may be a little better. 4 out of 5.",1351036800,7,702,4.207407407407407
5172567,3,B008OHV4PG,"i am a long time Neil fan, have about everything he's released & seen him live about 10 times.  (his Hollywood Bowl show with Crazy Horse was great btw.)

i rented this from Netflix & i'm glad i didn't buy it.  the 10 songs he does on solo electric guitar were just okay.  i'm not a fan of his ""Le Noise"" style which i find cold to listen to.  either i like full on Neil acoustic or the great loud Horse.  i think the electric guitar needs the bass & drum to give it rhythm.  maybe that's why it's called a rhythm session.

the interviews were full length but your typical rock star interview.  for me, no revelations.  his book Waging Heavy Peace gives more insights but even there, some ramblings & too much plugging for Pono (i still wonder how that compares with Apple Lossless).

his driving around Ontario was ok, but if it weren't Neil Young driving around, most of us has seen small towns.

anyway, it's okay to see once but IMO it's not a must see or must buy.

Note:  the dvd does not have the special features/interviews that the bluray has.",1350691200,13,1052,4.301020408163265

5172569,5,B008OHV4PG,"Fall 2012 is the ""season of the Young"" (well Neil Young, anyway), and I seem to be immersed in ""things Young"", going through his new autobiography in both hardbound book and the audiobook version (read by Keith Carradine). Now comes this Bluray disc of the 2012 feature film/concert documentary ""Neil Young Journeys"", directed by Jonathan Demme. This is either the third, or fifth (depending on how you define ""film"") Demme/Young film and - as Demme points out in  the bonus features - completely different from the previous projects. And it's wonderful.

The majority of the 89-minutes consists of Young performing during the last two nights of his ""Le Noise"" solo tour at the historic Massey Hall in Toronto, Canada (where Young was born). But Demme wanted to show more about Young so he rented a 1956 Ford Crown Victoria (Young is a car buff as well as a huge Lionel train fan) and had him start in Omemee, the town in northern Ontario where Young grew up (they moved from Toronto early on), following his brother Bob (in another vintage car), Demme drove with him to Toronto. They visit sites important to Young in his early life and Young tells some funny stories. But, as I said, the 12 songs performed in the concerts (the two concerts were edited together) form the nucleolus of the film. In addition to the songs on his 2011 album, we get two previously unreleased songs and as well as the ""hits"", including ""After The Gold Rush"", ""My My Hey Hey"" and ""Ohio"" - the latter being embellished by film clips of the Kent State shootings and photos of the four students killed. Demme uses some odd camera techniques and on two songs (including ""Down by the River"") he uses a tiny camera mounted on the mic stand and we get close-ups of Young's teeth!!! The instrumentation is varied as well with Young on both acoustic and electric guitar as well as piano and organ.  The film itself is great!

But, those who have seen the film will want the DVD or BD as well because of the bonuses. There is a short (six-minute) ""making of"" featurette but the real meat is in the TWO ""conversations with Young and Demme"", each running about 35 minutes. First comes the Slamdance Festival screening where Demme does most of the talking and it's about filmmaking, though Young does make some comments. The better one is the ""conversation"" held at the 92nd St. Y in New York where the interviewer (oddly, never identified - even in the credits) moves the discussion to Young's music. We hear his outspoken thoughts about the ""quality of sound"" and how ""MP3s suck"". By the way, both ""conversations"" are ""edited"" for expletives. Some of the same stories are repeated in both ""conversations"" but each has its own rewards.

This is not only a must for Young fans but a fine introduction to those who only know Young from his ""hits"" on the radio.

Note that the bonuses are the same on both the DVD and Bluray.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5172570,5,B008OHV4PG,"I recently rushed to a small inner city cinema in Melbourne to see the Saturday midday screening of ""Neil Young Journeys"". Joining me were five others - and we all joked about how we couldn't understand why the cinema wasn't full!!

This movie is brilliant. We get to be with Neil as he rambles around ""a town in north Ontario"" and gain a glimpse into his younger days. We are right on stage as he takes us through song after memorable song from all stages of his career - oh the playing. Jonathon Demme's direction is superb - you are on a journey into the theatre and on to the stage.

Neil plays with such power and passion - be warned about the impact of those first chords of ""Ohio"" - and also sweetness and respect for his subject matter.

I've got to have this DVD",1349222400,76,771,4.267123287671233

5172643,4,B008OHV4PG,"The music was excellent, of course. And his story telling about growing up in the ""town in north Ontario"" was interesting and interspersed with humor. His rendition of Ohio still captures the outrage and emotion over the Kent State University massacre in May 1970. There were newsreel clips from the incident rolling on screen during the song, and it ended with with pictures and names of the 4 students who were killed, while Neil repeated ""Four dead in Ohio.""  The only reason I am giving it a 4 is that I really didn't like some of the camera work.  On some songs there was a camera on the mic and part of the time the view was from a couple of inches just outside of his mouth.  I really didn't enjoy that.  In fact, early on one song he sprayed saliva onto the camera lens, so for the remainder you are looking at his mouth through a lens with a blob of saliva in the middle surrounded by small droplets.  Very gross.  I'd rather have seen close ups of his guitar playing. But overall, it is vintage Neil at his best and well worth watching.",1421020800,,1046,4.338461538461538

5172674,4,B008OHV4PG,"Note: this review pertains to the DVD edition. Contrary to what other review have said, I believe both the blu-ray and DVD include the same content.

On April 30th, 2011, I had the privilege and joy of seeing Neil Young live in Philadelphia, PA during the final leg of his Le Noise tour. The performances captured in is film, Neil Young Journeys, were recorded at Massey Hall in Ontario, Canada, about two weeks after the Philadelphia show. So it probably needn't be said that I'm fan of the guy and that I was excited to finally get to see this movie today. And I am glad to report that I was not underwhelmed at all. Far from it.

I will say, however, that Journeys will probably be best appreciated by well-established Young-lovers. It's not a conventonal concert film and goes into a little personal territory (although no more, really, than his songwriting),so I really recommend it if you consider yourself to be a devoted fan of the music and the artist, and have a substantial interest in him and immersion in his creative career. It also probably helps if you like the Le Noise album, as it's heavily featured in the song selection. Out of about twelve or fourteen songs, half of the list comes from Le Noise. This is fine with me, because I like Le Noise. It is undoubtedly one of my favorite Young albums of the last ten-fifteen years, but if you don't care for those songs, this movie may not interest you as much. For those who may not be aware, the fact that it's the Le Noise tour means the show features Neil Young singing and playing entirely solo, mostly on the electric guitar (which is unusual), but also with a few numbers on acoustic and keyboards. It's a somewhat novel approach and some people really feel that the songs would benefit from the presence of a rhythm section, but I think it works brilliantly this way. Young is a highly engaging and passionate artist and performer on his own and I'm glad that this is how I got to see him in concert.

The non-musical portions involve Young driving around his home town in North Ontario, pointing out landmarks ans childhood haunts (or at least where they used to be fifty or sixty-odd years ago). This is the part where you need to be a dedicated fan to fully get into it, but I don't feel there's any imbalance in the content or that Neil's documentarian explorations come at the expense of the music. Both segments are interesting to me for different reasons. We meet Neil's brother Bob Young and they share one or two amusing childhood anecdotes. Neil offers some lovely insights while driving through some beautiful country side in the town of Omemee. It's called Journeys--plural--for a reason: there's more than one trip. That's also probably why it's shorter than most concert films (80 minutes) and has fewer songs: it's a hybrid of art forma and ideas. To give you a quantitative sense, it's probably equivalent to a long-ish album's worth of songs (say an hour), supplemented with fifteen to twenty minutes in documentary content. My numbers could be a little off there, but I maintain that to me, it seemed like a 40/60 (or so) split in favor of the music. And I realize that those two back-to-back statements may be mathematically contradictory, but quantitative analysis isn't really to the point in my opinion. I just hope the ideas show through.

Back to qualitative thinking. Musically, one thing I appreciated about Journeys is that it reminded me and reinforced how strong I think the Le Noise material is. Highlights include a barebones acoustic performance of the quiet, sociopolitical-autobiographical rumination Love and War, which is haunting, powerful, and piercing in some of its observations and honest reflections, and the underrated rocker Rumblin'. With some alternate lyrics to the album version, the song has deep aesthetic and spiritual vibes in my opinion. The chorus is beautiful. There's also a remarkable version of the superb Walk with Me, played as an encore. The ending is, for want of a greater word, simply epic. It is amazing and marvelous the effect that Young can achieve just by swinging his Gretsch guitar in front of the amp like a pot of holy water. He can take an electric guitar and create transcendent sound art. Also, the opening of the film draws you in with a performance of the slow-growing acoustic number Peaceful Valley Boulevard, which has a slightly altered emding from the studio version (also included during the show I saw) and seems even stronger than I remember. Fans will also want to keep an eye out for a very memorable performance of Hitchhiker, employing what director Jonathan Demme calls in one of the bonus interviews the cheapest movie lighting effect ever...

A non-Noise treat is After the Goldrush played on pump organ, including a clever lyrical update moving Mother Nature from the 1970s to the 21st century. I love the song and this is a lovely rendering, (For those who may not know, Young seems to love the pump organ; for evidence, see the eccentric version of Like a Hurricane on his Unplugged album.) Neil also plays Leia and You Never Call, two songs that were new when the tour started in 2010 and haven't been placed on an album yet. Afficionados will want it at least for those songs. Leia is a cute, warm-hearted endearing tune for a child--an affectionate and gently vivid character portrait, while You Never Call is eerie and hauntingly sad, with a chilling ominous chord sequence and vocal melody that well-demonstrate Neil's songwriting instinct.

All of the songs are ones performed at the show I saw, although there was more to the full set. My only wish might have been for the inclusion of Tell me Why, which was the second number on my night. It's a beautiful song and a staple of his acoustic shows. Hearing Neil Young play Tell Me Why live elevated me to a state of Nirvana that never fully wore off for the rest of the show. Still, maybe it wasn't quite a fit for this film.

Overall, this is a real treat for Neil Young fans. I love the music and think the movie is very good, but jus be aware it's not a conventional concert movie. Along with the non-musical portions there are unusual camera angles and visual tricks, but if you really like Neil Young's work, you're fairly prepared for weird things that frustratevand transcend conventional barriers. There's rarely anything generic in what he does and this film is no exception. Neil Young and his friends love to take us on journeys. Let's walk with them.",1394668800,3,6487,4.715167548500882

I was looking for The Trunk Show but bought this and was glad that I did.  What an intimate up close look at one of the greatest musical artists of all time.

I very much enjoyed the Neil Young Blu-ray Archives Vol. 1 boxed set, and, of course, a lot of his recordings, but, to me, this disk was boring, both cinematically and musically.  I guess this means that although I have loved much of Neil's music, I am not enough of a fan to be enthralled by watching him drive around and perform what appears to be an impassioned, if musically uninspired, set.

So, if you are a *real* fan of Neil, I suppose this will satisfy, but for the more casual admirer of Neil's music, I would advise watching and listening to a friend's copy before deciding whether or not to purchase this disk.

If you want to be amazed, purchase, watch, and listen to ""Searching for Sugar Man.""  It's not Neil, but it is cinematically and musically compelling.",1372377600,3,872,4.493670886075949
5172712,4,B008OHV4PG,"Director Jonathan Demme teams up again with Neil Young and provides another combo documentary/concert film.  As a long time Young fan, I'm always interested in his musical direction and his interests in the fidelity of recorded sound.  Here he returns to his hometown in northern Ontario as he prepares for a two night gig at Toronto's Massey Hall. Young rents a '56 Ford and follows his brother in a Cadillac making pit stops along memory lane.  Neil tells us events in his life growing up all of which is pretty normal stuff.  No horror tales in his background.

When the film takes us to the concert venue, Young walks on stage alone, but for his guitar and harmonica, says nothing to the audience and starts playing.  He mixes up old songs from the late `60's and brings them to life in a new way.  He sources his more recent (2010) material as well, providing a nice mix.  Playing alone I was interested in seeing Young thumb that top, thick bass string while still coaxing the melody out of the lower ones.  I'm no guitar player but you don't see that too often.  My subs were awake and moving.

Demme and Young get a bit carried away with some of the camera tricks, the most offensive being a small camera mounted on the mic stand.  This gives us a good view of Neils throat, teeth and nose hair.  We even get a bit of spittle on the camera which can be enjoyed through much of the concert.  Don't get me wrong, the music is great and Young clearly has deep affection for his roots.

This Blu ray disc looks pretty good, but is fairly routine for the technology.  Blacks are deep during the concert footage and the visuals feature excellent texture and clarity.  Notice Neil's tattered straw hat.  The ""road"" footage is more limiting given the home movie style of shooting.  The transfer comes in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and, as hinted at above, is damn fine.  At least the concert portion is.  Again, the stroll through memory lane is less involving.  Here are the concert selections:
1.  Peaceful Valley Boulevard
2.  Ohio
3.  Down by the River
4.  Sign of Love
5.  Rumbling
6.  Love and War
7.  Leia
8.  After the Gold Rush
9.  I Believe in You
10.  My, My, Hey, Hey (Out of the Blue)
11.  You Never Call
12.  Hitchhiker
13.  Walk With Me

Extras include a couple interviews with Young and Demme, a short ""making of"" doc, a trailer and an assortment of Sony previews.",1370822400,2,2425,4.4419134396355355

5172714,5,B008OHV4PG,"While I usually dislike interview/concert music DVDs, I really enjoyed this one because Neil Young takes you on a visit to his hometown in rural Canada, sharing places and memories.

5172715,3,B008OHV4PG,"Been a fan of Neil's since 1967 so I can always find something to like in his work. But Jonathan Demme seems to have dropped the ball in many ways with this thing. Oddly, he felt the need to dress up Neil's performance of Ohio with old footage from the campus shooting, as if the intended audience of the movie had been in a coma since 1965 and never heard of this! Meanwhile, Let's Roll, the song he wrote in a similar fit of outrage right after 9/11 has lost its relevance for Old Neil. Somehow, the 4 in Ohio outrank the 4000 in NY, DC and Pennsylvania. But I'm always able to forgive Neil his eccentricities. His performance here has got a wistful, elegiac quality. I think the aneurysm really woke Neil up to his own mortality. Here, its like he's saying farewell to his fans. It has a very intimate quality, just like his recent book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waging-Heavy-Peace/dp/0399159460/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waging Heavy Peace</a>.

Overall, the DVD is well done. The only thing about the music is that he appears to be playing rarities and unknown songs (from new albums? covers?), which is fine, but I wish he had played more of his classics or lessor known gems from albums in the 1990s. I would recommend to any Young fan, I doubt you'll be disappointed.",1365206400,,480,4.344444444444444

This is not your typical Neil Young media event. Neil has always been pretty serious about documenting, recording, and preserving the present for the future. This is a unique look into Neil and where he is in his life at this time.

This movie documents Neil's travels back to his homeground haunts..You see his brother and where he grew up, and at the same time documents his return to Massey Hall for a solo concert. But this is not a solo acoustic gig, this is Neil playing many of his greatest releases in a different manner. Lots of electric and acoustic, but performed solo, you just need to watch to understand what he is doing here. As he describes, it's like he is performing with a band, but you are only hearing his isolated part of the whole...very interesting.

The added commentary from Neil and Demme is kinda cool.

5172803,5,B008OHV4PG,"I was quite anxious to see this film, a)having seen this mesmerizing trailer; b)being another one of Mr. Young's countless disciples.  Before his scheduled concert at Massey Hall in Toronto, we are privy to an exclusive passenger seat tour, with Neil in the driver seat (following his older brother Bob); of his beloved hometown in Omemee, Ontario.  We see the spot where he fished as a child, where his old home once stood, the school named after his well respected father;  returning to his roots obviously stirs fond memories and affection.
  A fleeting moment had me smiling; still driving, Neil was recollecting about something when someone on the sidewalk hollers, ""nice car, buddy!""  Neil gives him a thumbs up, along with a proud 'thank you'.
  Then comes the concert.  Filmed as a solo engagement in support of his recent release 'Le Noise', Mr Young offers beautiful renditions from this, as well as many others spanning his extraordinary career. The show is both acoustic and electric.  Highlights include a captivating 'Peaceful Valley Blvd', to such subtle and sublime effect, it creates a lasting ambiance hinting of lingering Native spirits.  A tremendously powerful electric rendition of 'Ohio, to which the sixty-six year old man's voice simply soars.  I was awestruck; that's no exaggeration. Toward the show's close, Neil is seated at his antique pump organ, to deliver a spellbinding version of his timeless masterpiece 'After The Gold Rush.'
  If you're not that familiar with Neil Young and wondering what all the hoo-ha is about; this film will certainly help you understand.  If you've yet to see the film, and you're a Neil head like myself...whaddya waiting for!
  See it. And read his book, 'Waging Heavy Peace' while you're at it.  You might think Neil's giving me five bucks to say that, but he's not.",1354147200,,1830,5.003311258278146
