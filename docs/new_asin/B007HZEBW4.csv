5087401,5,B007HZEBW4,Brew Masters was a great series. Just too short. Dogfish and Sam are synonymous with great beer. Too bad most are only available on the east coast.,1352505600,,147,4.481481481481482
5087402,5,B007HZEBW4,"This contains the 5 episodes that were shown on Discovery, before they succumbed to corporate brewing pressure and pulled the plug on this show.  Discovery should be ashamed; in a world replete with nonsense reality TV, this show was clearly a major step above.  Course, people have to have a brain and like good beer (ie, not foreign-owned BMC swill) to really enjoy this series.  Since you're reading this review, you're of us .... yay off centered beer!

In any case, the episodes do not include Brews for Batali, or whatever they called the lost sixth episode that Discovery didn't show in the US.  Since that was the only reason I bought this DVD, having the other 5 episodes on iTunes already, I'm feeling a little lost. In any case, if you haven't seen these shows on Discovery, and they don't seem to want to rerun them, this DVD is excellent.

Sam Calagione and his wife Mariah run Dogfish Head brewery, clearly the most ""out there"" brewery in the states today.  This DVD follows Sam & crew as they make 5 different beers ... a beer to celebrate the anniversary of Miles Davis's Bitches Brew album, a Chicha ""hand made"" or should I say ""mouth made"" with corn, a beer with surf board remnants, a beer with portamarillo, and finally an ancient Egyptian beer.  I did say they are out there, right?

Sam's infectious enthusiasm and his interesting team really make this DVD a lot of fun to watch .. assuming you like beer of course.  If you like corporate beer, you should watch Beer Wars for an eye opener.  In that one, Sam was sued by foreign-corporate beer entity (I can't say which one, but they stole a beer's name from a Czech city) for using Chicory on the label, or some such nonsense.

I highly recommend this DVD, even though it doesn't have the lost episode.",1339545600,15,1775,4.547169811320755
