7332573,5,B011D5G982,"Ive taken the last 1.5 weeks to do every workout and review them in detail on my blog (www. EmpowerMoms.net), so I hope all this information will be helpful! My full review and pictures are on my blog.

Walk On: 3 Weight Loss Walks
Overall thoughts on this dvd:
**You will not need any equipment for these 4 workouts.

**Debbie shows low impact, beginner moves; Beth shows more advanced, higher impact moves; and Jessica shows intermediate to advanced moves in all the workouts.

**The music beat is good and upbeat-no words.

**The background is white and bright which contrasts nicely with the womens clothes.

**The 40 min mega burn was my favorite workout on the dvd! I especially loved the finale which had a jazzy song and was so fun!

** I liked the standing abs routine because it was upright which makes it easier on my neck, and she did several new ab moves I had never done before.

Walk On: Major Metabolism Booster
Overall thoughts on this dvd:
**You will not need any equipment for the first dvd but you will need one set of dumbbells for the second dvd. Debbie uses no weights, Beth uses 3 lbs. and Jessica uses 5 lbs. You will also need a chair and yoga block or pillow for the bonus chair stretch workout.

**Debbie shows low impact, beginner moves; Beth shows more advanced, higher impact moves; and Jessica shows intermediate to advanced moves in all the workouts.

**The music beat is good and upbeat-no words.

**The background is white and bright which contrasts nicely with the womens clothes.

**I did both of these workouts with my friends and we each burned over 500 calories in 60 mins!

**The strength interval walk was very hard on my knees with all the squats and lunges, even though I did alot of beginner and modifications.

Walk On: 5 Day Fat Burn
Overall thoughts on this dvd:
**You will not need any equipment for the first dvd but you will need a 6 foot resistance band for the second workout and bonus back workout.

**Debbie shows low impact, beginner moves; Beth shows more advanced, higher impact moves; and Jessica shows intermediate to advanced moves in all the workouts.

**The music beat is good and upbeat-no words.

**The background is white and bright which contrasts nicely with the womens clothes. I like the flowers in the background as contrast also.

**I enjoyed the Hiit workout more than I thought I would because it didn't hurt my knees. The 4 Hiit rounds are all different so you don't have to worry about repeating the same moves all 4 rounds which I liked!

I really enjoyed this brand new 3 dvd set of workouts! Jessica Smith did an amazing job with this collection. I especially like that she included a 30 day calendar on the back of the box so you can rotate between all the dvds. There is alot of variety with this set that beginners, intermediate and advanced workout people will enjoy.

I have been buying and using Jessica Smith dvd and youtube workouts for years and absolutely love her teaching style and workouts! I was beyond thrilled when the company contacted me and sent me a complimentary copy of this 3 dvd program for blog and social media review! All opinions are my own.",1441152000,11,3148,4.599284436493739
7332574,5,B011D5G982,"I used to think that if exercise wasn't really intense, it didn't count as exercise. Well, many injuries later, I have completely changed my thinking.  I have Miss Jessica to thank for that.  I started doing Jessica's YouTube workouts as my second workout of the day.  I wanted to support her even further, so I started buying her DVDs.  I now have all her DVDs.

This latest offering from Jessica is a complete set and it has everything you need to help you get fit, lose weight and most importantly, have fun!  As Jessica so often says, ""who says exercise can't be fun?""

This set contains:

""Walk On: 3 Weight Loss Walks"" - 15 Minute Calorie Burst, 30 Minute Fat Blaster, 40 Minute Mega Burn, BONUS: 15 Minute Standing Abs (100 Minutes)

""Walk On: Major Metabolism Booster"" - 30 Minute Pyramid Power Walk, 30 Minute Strength Interval Walk, BONUS: 20 Minute Chair Stretch Routine (80 Minutes)

""Walk On: 5 Day Fat Burn"" - 30 Minute HIIT Walk ""Party"", 30 Minute Toning Walk, BONUS: 15 Minute Healthy Back Workout (75 Minutes).

All of the workouts are filmed in a nice, sunny, white room.  This is the same room where Jessica has filmed other workouts.  It's Jessica, Beth and Jessica's Mom, Debbie in each routine.

Why I love these workouts:

* Jessica!  What can I say?  She is my favorite instructor.  She is encouraging, funny and just so happy; I can't help but smile every time I work out with her.

* The three levels of modifications.  Beth is doing a super-advanced version of the moves, e.g. high impact, Debbie is doing a low impact, easier version and Jessica is doing something in between.  I work out at 4:30 am and sometimes my body just isn't up for a lot of jumping around, so it's great to have Jessica and Debbie for form modifications.

* The music is perfectly in sync with the workout moves.  This really helps me dig deeper and push myself.  My biggest pet peeve with other instructors like Cathe Friedrich is that the moves are never to the beat of the music.  This is annoying and distracting.

* Minimal equipment needed.  For the walks, all you need are a good pair of shoes.  For some of the other workouts, you will need light and medium dumbbells and a mat.  One of the workouts also uses a resistance band, which is a nice change.

* How I feel after the workouts.  I consider myself to be an advanced exerciser, but I love these workouts because I feel so energized after doing them.  I have lots of energy to get on with my day.  I also have enough energy to move more during the day.  Plus, I am not overworking my body so I am injury-free.  Yay.

* The variations in walking.  I just love how Jessica mixes things up with v-steps, kicks, ab twists.  I am able to do her walks every day and not worry about overtaxing my hip joints.

The two things to note about some of the workouts:

* The warm ups and cool downs were roughly 5 minutes each, meaning for a 30 minute walk, you are working more intensely for only 20 minutes.  I much prefer to have separate warm ups and cool downs.  I normally do these workouts as add-ons to other workouts, so I don't need the long warm ups and cool downs.

* Not enough weight work on their own.  Sure your muscles get worked, but for me, these routines are not enough of a challenge to change my body.  That's just me; I have been doing heavy weight training for years.

Now some general comments about each workout.

WALK ON:  3 WEIGHT LOSS WALKS

1.  15 Minute Calorie Burst.

These 15 minute walks of Jessica's are my favorites since they are the perfect add-on to another routine or to do for a quick energy boost.  Several of the moves are what Jessica uses in other workouts, e.g. kicks, heel digs, side steps and v-steps.  There are some new moves like side to side skaters with punches and the use of an imaginary jump rope.

2.  30-Minute Fat Blaster.

This is my favorite of the routines.  It's classic Jessica walking, with some new, fun moves. The new moves include cheerleader arms while marching/running, speed bag arms while shuffling, and uphill climbers.  You alternate lower intensity with high intensity bursts.  The workout breakdown:

Warm up (5 min)
Moderate intensity walk (5 min)
Higher intensity (5 min)
Moderate intensity (5 min)
Higher intensity (5 min)
Cool down (5 min)

Once again, I thought the 5 minute cool down was too long.  It seemed a very sudden transition from the high intensity.

3. 40-Minute Mega Burn.

I must admit, this workout snuck up on me.  This is steady state workout, meaning you are working at the same intensity throughout.  The goal of this workout is to build your endurance.  Oh yes, the intensity is theoretically the same, but after doing it for 20 minutes, you will be feeling it!

4. 15-Minute Standing Abs (Bonus Workout).

With this workout, you'll work your abs and your balance since several of the moves have you standing on one leg.  Some of the moves in this workout include:  figure 8 arms, dead lift twist with arms crossed, leaning side crunch, figure 8 with alternating knee lift.

WALK ON: MAJOR METABOLISM BOOSTER

1. Pyramid Power Walk (30 minutes).

As the name implies, this walking routine starts off at a slower pace and gradually builds in intensity. You reach the maximum intensity at the 15 minute mark.  You can increase the intensity by doing light jogging and making bigger arm movements.  My only issue with this walk is that I wished the maximum intensity was a bit longer.  I also thought the cool down (5 minutes) was too long.

2. Strength Interval Walk (30 minutes).

You will do both walking and strength training in this routine.  You can use 3-10 pound dumbbells, depending on your fitness level.  I generally use 5 pound dumbbells for the smaller muscles and 10 pound dumbbells for the legs.  This is an efficient workout since you will be doing compound exercises like rear lunges and triceps kickbacks.  Your abs will be worked at the end of the routine.

3.  20-Minute Chair Stretch (Bonus Workout).

I was tempted to skip this workout since I do a lot of yoga. I thought it would be too easy and slow moving for me.  But, I am so glad I decided to give it a try.  Using the chair to help stretch makes me feel the stretches in a new way, which is a good thing.

Jessica uses a yoga block under her feet to make sure her knees and hips are in alignment.  A phone book or a folded towel would also work.

WALK ON: 5 DAY FAT BURN

1. HIIT Walk (30 minutes).
I loved this workout. HIIT training is my favorite way to train because it is so efficient.  This workout has you doing 3-4 minutes of moderate intensity moves, followed by 2 minutes of higher intensity.  There is a 3-4 minute recovery time and then you do another round.

2. Toning Walk (30 minutes).

This was my least favorite of the workouts.  Jessica uses a resistance band for this workout.  I felt clumsy doing this workout and had to keep pausing the DVD so I could position the resistance band correctly.

I will keep at it since I do like how a resistance band uses your muscles differently than weights.  I am hoping I will get more coordinated with time.

3. The Healthy Back Workout (18 minutes Bonus Workout).

The jury is still out on this workout.  I do like how you not only work your back, but also your core.  It moves slowly.  I think I was just so energized by doing another workout from this set that I wasn't quite ready to slow things down.  This would be a good workout to do on a rest day or as an afternoon stretch.

Some of the moves included in this workout are: supermans, dead bug, hip bridges and bird dog.

You may wonder if you need this set if you have some of Jessica's other workouts.  In a word, yes!  The new moves will help prevent plateaus and prevent you from getting bored with your exercise routines.",1441152000,137,7773,4.462580185317178
7332575,5,B011D5G982,I love this 30 day program. It gives me many choices as well as a 30 day program to follow. I hope she continues selling these wonderful products.,1441152000,,146,4.25
7332576,5,B011D5G982,"Day 4 new 30 day plan,am amazed at the new even more creative workouts-& I've been working out with Jessicasmithtv for a LONG time,both You Tube and downloads. Love the low impact and love that I work the entire core,abs obliques and back,my particular weakness but getting stronger thanks to Jessica! Thank you so much,though miss Peanut in the professionally produced dvd(purchased digital download)",1440979200,2,401,5.28125
7332577,5,B011D5G982,"I'm on Day 3 of your new 30 day walking plan, and I'm loving these workouts.  They are a happy medium in between other walking workouts that aren't challenging enough and intense workouts that make you want to stop 2 minutes in.  These are easy to face each day, which keeps me working out and feeling successful about it.  I feel like these workouts were made for ""real people"" - people who just want to get in some healthy movement without having to do moves that are painful or dangerous.  I recommend Jessica's new DVDs to everyone; each new DVD she releases get better and better.

(Purchased the digital download version)",1440547200,31,627,4.612612612612613
7332578,5,B011D5G982,"What a great series!  Jessica and Co. shine brighter than ever in Jessicas lastest Walk On DVD workouts.  As with her previous releases, Jessicas upbeat attitude carries the workouts to a higher standard than some other fitness popular DVD fitness instructors.  A lot can be said from a positive attitude, and smile!  How could you NOT want to get up and move too!  As with Jessicas prior walking releases, these workouts are designed for everyone, from beginner to intermediate, and all ages, shapes and sizes.  Jessicas beautiful Mom, Debbie is on beginner modifications, while Jessica demonstrates the intermediate level, and Beth, a more advanced option.  VERY CAREFUL attention to form is discussed and demonstrated.  These DVDs come in a boxed set complete with a 30-Day Calendar that allows you to use each workout in a set schedule for maximum results.  The workouts are also great to be used as standalone workouts, or in conjunction with other workout routines you may also be doing.  The workouts range from 15-40 minutes in length to work into any schedule.  Each routine is designed to be a routine which one can grow with allowing you to start out at an easier, lower impact level, and gradually build up to a more advanced level as you progress with the series, and gain strength and cardiovascular stamina and muscular endurance.  These routines would be great for who want to gain endurance walking longer distances, or begin to jog or run.  I have reviewed each routine individually below with my caloric burn and equipment used to give you a better idea of what to expect for each routine as well as provided a comprehensive list of PROS and CONS overall for the set at the bottom of the review.

**Please Note**  I am a 34 year old, intermediate to advanced exerciser, 57 height and weigh 145 pounds.  Your exact caloric expenditure is based on your fitness level, age, and weight, so numbers provided are for estimation purposes only.

Jessica, Debbie and Beth wear shoes for all routines with the exception of the 20 Minute Chair Stretch.  I prefer to workout barefoot where possible, and have designated which workouts I choose to do so.  You may feel better working out with shoes depending on your flooring/comfort.

Disc 1: Major Metabolism Booster

a. Pyramid Power Walk: (30 minutes, 210 calories burned, I did this routine barefoot)  This walking routine starts off at a slower gentle pace, and gradually builds in intensity, with the maximum intensity point at the 15 minute mark, and then gradually returns downwards (hence the pyramid) to the cooldown.  This workout features many of Jessica's signature moves, but also some new, fun movements.  Exercises are done in intervals but are not repeated (with the exception of some of the warmup/cooldown movements).  As the routine picks up in pace, so does the music.  The workout includes optional light jogging, and some higher intensity movements  (Debbie and Jessica feature lower intensity movements).  This routine is great for getting your heart rate up and getting you sweating.  It is also a great routine for people who may want to start light jogging, or higher intensity workouts without killing the joints. My only complaint about this routine is that the peak of the workout was very short, and ended at the 15 minute mark, just when I was ready for more, and the cooldown was longer than I'd usually like (roughly 5 minutes).  4/5 stars.

b. Strength Interval Walk:  (30 minutes, 205 calories burned, I did this workout barefoot)  This routine is an exciting combination of walking and strength training rolled into one efficient routine.  Present are several of Jessicas Signature moves (hamstring curls etc.)  but there are also several new moves.  The routine can be done with 1-10 lb. hand weights depending on fitness level, or no weights at all if you are just starting out.  I used 5 lb. weights throughout the routine.  An equal variety of upper and lower body exercises, this routine combines multiple muscle groups (think shoulder presses while walking, tricep kickbacks while holding a rear lunge).  Some strength exercises are worked while standing in place, while others combine the walking component.  Upper and lower body are worked evenly, and the workout is finished with a standing ab series with fun new moves to work the core all around.  5/5 stars

c. 20-Minute Chair Stretch (Bonus Workout):  (no calorie count, workout performed barefoot).  An AMAZING stretching routine all done with the assistance of a chair, and a yoga block (if you don't have a yoga block, a thick book, phone book, firm pillow, or stack of towels can be substituted).  This routine reminded me a lot of Jessicas earlier Yoga Stretch DVD release but was done seated on a chair.  A few standing exercises using the chair for balance were also incorporated.  The yoga block allowed to greater range of motion, especially in those tight areas.  The music was soothing.  What a great stretch to incorporate after a hard workout, at the end of the day, or for an active recovery day!  I will definitely use this one regularly to release tension in my hips and back!  5/5 stars.

Disc 2: 3 Weight Loss Walks

a.  15 Minute Calorie Burst (125 calories, I did this workout barefoot):  This quick, energetic walk is similar to Jessicas earlier 15 minute routines, but I felt it was a bit faster paced than many in the past.  It had to live up to the name of course.  Several of Jessicas signature moves (side steps, V-steps, heel digs, kicks) are present, but some newer moves including grapevines with high knee repeaters,  jack feet with imaginary jump rope,  side-to-side skaters with punches added some new variety and made this routine interesting.  This is a great stand-alone routine if you're short on time, or if youd like to add some extra cardio work to a strength routine.  5/5 stars.

b.  30-Minute Fat Blaster (225  calories, I used shoes during this workout):  This walk alternated longer periods of moderate intensity moves, interspersed with higher intensity moves.  I feel this routine did an excellent job incorporating both upper, and lower body movements, and some sneaky standing core work.  If you're familiar with Jessicas other walking routines, this one was comprised of a lot of her signature moves, but had a lot of variety.  5/5 stars.

c.  40-Minute Mega Burn:  (320 calories burned, I used shoes during this workout):  This routine was BY FAR MY FAVORITE!!  This routine really got me sweating.  After the warm up, the pace took off with a bang, and kept going until the cooldown at the end,  without intervals.  The purpose of this walk was to build up endurance using  steady state cardio and did it EVER deliver!  This is a workout Ill be coming back to regularly!  5/5 OUTSTANDING stars!

d.  15-Minute Standing Abs (Bonus Workout):  (workout done barefoot, calories not counted) This 15 minute standing routine is great if you don't like laying on the floor, or have a sensitive neck and don't like floor exercises/crunches.  All the exercises are done standing, and work the core muscles (upper, lower abdominals, obliques and back) and are great for the posture.  Figure 8's, knee raises, side leg raises/stretches, cross-arm deadlifts with twists and chair pose/squats with twists are some of the exercises featured.  By engaging the core during this workout, I could really feel my entire core engaging.  I love this workout as an alternative to laying on the floor and pulling on my neck to do basic crunches.  5/5 stars.

Disc 3: 5 Day Fat Burn

a. HIIT Walk (30 minutes, 260 calories burned, I did this workout barefoot):  Quite possibly my most favorite routine on the set so far.  This routine was interval based with a warm up, followed by 3-4 minutes of moderate intensity moves and subsequent 2 minutes of higher intensity (HIIT) movements followed by a 3-4 minute recovery set of moderate intensity movements repeated four times and followed by a cooldown.  Beginner, intermediate and advanced options were presented.  I was able to complete the higher intensity moves throughout the workout, and felt like I got a very good workout.  Plenty of lower body movements using larger muscle groups to get the heart rate up, without a lot of impact.  This is one I can see myself using in a rotation regularly.  5/5 stars.

b. Toning Walk (30 minutes, 195 calories burned, I did this workout barefoot):  This routine uses a flat resistance band to tone while you walk.  Its not a huge calorie burner, but it does work you from head to toe.  The resistance band does not come with the kit, but you can pick up one up for a few dollars at Walmart/Target etc.  This was a great little routine, because I felt like it got a lot done, in a short amount of time.  It included segments of light cardio, with periods of strength work using the band.  What I liked about this routine was that its GREAT for traveling.  You can easily increase the resistance by choking up on the band more, which makes this routine very versatile for all fitness levels.  Using resistance bands also works muscles differently than regular dumbbells.  I really loved this routine!  5/5 stars.

c. The Healthy Back Workout (Bonus Working, 18 minutes, calories not counted, I did this workout barefoot):  This workout is a hidden GEM.  Dont SKIP IT!  I feel it should be renamed to the Strong Back, Booty and Core workout, because it works them all!  You need a yoga mat, or soft surface, and a resistance band for this routine.  What a great routine for improving posture, and strengthening the core.  There was also a bit of shoulder work with this routine as well.  This workout includes some fun new moves, including the Dead Bug (look it up if you're not familiar with it) which was a GREAT core strengthener and included moves like hip bridges, Supermans, and bird dogs (with and without pulses).  This short routine got a LOT done in a very short amount of time.  I felt like I was standing taller, and my core was tighter after I finished this routine. My SECOND most favorite routine of the series.  5/5 stars.

Pro/Con Summary;

Pros:  Fun, bright colored outfits.  Positive Attitude.  EXCELLENT Instruction on proper form.  Beginner (Debbie),Intermediate (Jessica) and Advanced (Beth) options.  Upbeat music.  Loads of variety (workouts)  Multiple muscle groups worked at once during cardio work as well as strength.

Cons:  Bright white set in all workouts (same set as some of the other previous workout DVDs).  Some recycled music from previous workouts.  Repetition of a lot of the same moves from workout to workout (not a problem for me, but may be for some).  Only 2 dedicated strength routines (excluding standing abdominal routine).

I was not compensated nor will be compensated in any way for providing the above review.  The comments, reviews and statements above are based on my own opinion and love of these routines**",1440374400,190,11052,4.86989247311828

7332580,5,B011D5G982,"I'm 55 and have a hard time finding a workout plan I can stick with because most seem geared towards people with younger joints than mine. This one is perfect for me! I completed the 30-day plan with only a very small amount of minor joint pain, and I already feel stronger and more fit. I'm now a few days into round 2 & this time I'm increasing the intensity a bit. I have done several of Jessica Smith's YouTube videos, and I have one of her other DVDs & I love that her focus is always on increasing strength, fitness, and coordination rather than getting a bikini bod. In this DVD set she gives you options of varying intensity and encourages you to push to your own limit without going too far (and without making you feel incompetent if you can't handle it). I'm so happy I purchased this set! Thank you Jessica!",1525219200,3,819,4.324675324675325

7332586,1,B011D5G982,"2 of the DVD' s have sound and video production problems. At the start of the DVD exercise session, there would be no sound as the video was running, then it would come on choppy, spotty and not in sync at all with the video. it was like that on all the sessions. I have a Blue Ray player and have no issues with any other DVDs I play. Frustrating as the workout looked so promising. The 3rd DVD had the very same issues. I had been contemplating keeping them if only the one was goofed up, but having 2 out of 3 DVDs in poor quality prompted me to return the set. I could not find the option to replace it so I had to ask for a refund. I am hesitant about getting another set as it may have those issues as well. I really like Jessica's DVDS. I have several of them and feel she is excellent, best around! I was looking forward to this series so much. It had all the elements i was looking for in a workout DVD. Her reviews are consistently high. I just wish the set I got was not defective. This is the first DVD I have ever had issues with from Amazon. So very disappointed.feel let down. Bummer.

3-18-18 UPDATE:Although I had to return this DVD set, I must say how very impressed I am with the immediate support from Jessica concerning my issue. I received a very courteous email, which I appreciate. I am impressed with the care for customer satisfaction and the personal touch she gives. I received an immediate refund. I bought  ""Burn Fat and Have Fun! Low Impact, High Results"" to replace the set I had to return. I have similar issues with the production but it is not so bad on this DVD. So I will keep it. I am not sure winy  my last 2 purchases of her DVDs don't play right in my Blue Ray DVD player as her 6 Mile Workout works terrific. This is an excellent DVD by the way! My favorite. That one sold me on Jessicas workouts.

Many kudos to Jessica for her courteous and genuine caring for her customers. It is refreshing in this huge commercial world to have folks really care about their customers. i would definitely do business again with Jessica. Keep up the great work, Jessica.",1520899200,,2098,4.224438902743142
7332587,5,B011D5G982,"Go get yourself a new $30 DVD player, the quality issues were solved once I ditched my old Blu-ray.  The picture was jumpy and audio off by seconds. Maybe its the newer technology or maybe it was just time for a new player but I did notice others making this same comment. Regardless I was very happy with this purchase and will be getting more once Im through this 30 day program. It is challenging for all levels, maybe a little too much for a middle aged person that hasn't exercised much recently. I had to modify the program. Just had to have a rest day after 4 days.  Maybe as I progress I will be less sore the next day. I recently lost 45 lbs but at a stubborn plateau, I am only half way to my goal so I was looking for something to bust through to the final stage of my weight loss journey.  I am middle ages and overweight for a long time, I've only don't a little bit of exercise since April 2017.  Really just a little walking and not very consistently.  This is my first attempt in a decade to really organize a work out routine and commit to it.  That being said, these workout are definitely challenging!!!  But very doable for a newbie like me.  I might not recommend them for someone very obese or elderly, I was right up to my limit but I loved it so much.  I felt it was the perfect workout really.  I'm looking forward to diving into this 30 day program and creating some good habits.  Jessica is amazing!!! Ive been using Leslies videos but she is annoying and I always turn off the sound.  but this lady is perfect and never messes up!  She is great at ques and modifying the work out.

There seems to be a good variety of workouts and if you don't want to try and decide which workout you want to do, you can follow the 30-day schedule on the back of the box.  Jessica is clear in her instruction and the moves are not too difficult to follow.  It's nice that she offers 3 levels of intensity for each move in the workouts.  She also has some moves that are different than what I've seen in other dvd workouts, so I feel that also gives her workouts more variety.  I would definitely recommend this set of dvd's for someone who's looking for a change and more variety in their workouts.",1518739200,,630,4.260504201680672
7332591,5,B011D5G982,"I am re-starting this program as I re-start exercise in general, which I had neglected for a while except for morning walks with my dog.  (The walks are nice, but just not enough for overall fitness.)  I love Jessica Smith.  All that time other instructors spend either telling you how great you'll look in your jeans or yelling at you to work harder, Jessica spends explaining which muscles are working and guessing exactly what you are doing wrong (don't let your chin jut out, etc.).  So far, I have caught up on:

30 Minute Toning Walk - What a great way to wake up lazy muscles!  The toning band helped me work my weak upper back, along with chest and arms.  The simple lower body movements kept my heart rate up.

Healthy Back Bonus - Started out okay, but then went down to the floor.  My upper back is too weak for some of the back extension moves, and once she started the dead bug, I started to feel the nausea I get when attempting to exercise on my back.  I am going to remove this one from my rotation.  If you're okay with mat work, you shouldn't have any problems.

20 Minute Chair Stretch - Wonderful program for people who hate the mat!",1517616000,4,1153,4.336448598130841

They all make you sweat and know you did a workout, without going over the top on difficulty.  The only one I didn't like and wouldn't do again is the one with bands.  It felt a bit contrived and awkward.  Overall I would recommend this series as a go-to workout set.",1517011200,,432,4.417721518987341

I think this workout set is fun and varied enough to use for a while. I'm not really seeing any results yet like I did with zumba, but today is only day 9. I'll update my review along.

Update- I'm on day 21 and haven't lost much weight, but I have lost some inches and my waist is now more defined. I've stuck to the program to a t. I enjoy all of the workouts.",1516665600,5,624,3.9523809523809526

I have several health issues (arthritis, degenerative discs, G.I. surgeries, I'm basically a  really unhealthy 95 year old in a 46 year old body) that prevent me from running or high impact exercises. Even spinning is too high impact. This is a perfect balance. The workouts are no joke. You will get your sweat on. Walking is SO underestimated. The production quality is visually beautiful and bright, set in a tropical Florida setting. I love Leslie Sansone, I really do, but I dread her chattiness. It will actually serve as an excuse for me to not workout. Jessica is a breath of fresh air. She doesn't under-estimate her audience by talking to us like we're toddlers. She's great with queuing and explaining moves without dumbing it down and over-chatting, and her workout settings and costumes are visually interesting.

Back in my 20s and 30s, I did the classic workouts by The Firm (NOT the next-gen ones. The classic, original Firm workouts. Bigg diff). I swore by them. These remind me of them, but without the impact on the knees. They're interesting, pretty, simple but effective.

The thirty minute sessions are a condensed workout so you get the benefit of an hour and still have time to spare! There is also no floor work, so no up-and-down if you either can't or don't want to.

Leslie's workouts are easy to do in a small space and I can say the same for Jessica.  Both have a likable personality.  I especially liked how Jessica has two other people modifying the moves for low and high intensities.  She does the medium.  I love that her Mom does the workouts with her.  With only 3 people it's easier to focus on what you are doing.  It's so nice that they are ""real"" people of all ages versus a young athletic woman that trains every day all day.  Jessica is a beautiful woman that doesn't wear the skimpy workout gear that other trainers do, which I very much respect and appreciate.  I will say I had to learn Jessica's moves.  The routines are varied a lot more than Leslie's.  At 5am this was more challenging but hey I asked for it!  I also used the calendar which was included.

I wanted to start working out again but wasn't in love with DVDs I had.  I stumbled upon Jessica, did some of her workouts on Youtube and really liked them.  I started off with this set (eventually getting the Walk Strong set) and was really glad I did.  I'm an overweight couch potato and loved this program.  I was working hard, sweating, but pushing myself.  In the beginning I felt tired and kinda crappy after working out.  At the end I felt good at the end of each workout and wanted to keep working out.  Overall, I feel so much better.  I have more energy, my knees don't hurt as much, the rest of my body feels better, and I feel stronger.  I liked this program because it doesn't have any mat work (that I remember).  Mat work is usually very difficult and frustrating for me so I was glad for that.  I remember you need at least one set of weights and a resistance band (optional yoga block but it's really not needed).  My only complaint is that there's not a 'equipment list'.  I couldn't do one of the workouts when it was scheduled because I didn't have a resistance band.  I just subbed another workout but it was disappointing/frustrating.

I have an external dvd drive set up on my work computer and I go in early every day to exercise at my desk before I start my day.  Her programs give you the most bang for your buck.  I have now purchased three different sets of her programs and mix it up every week.  I am not following any of her weight loss programs but it would be easy to do so if you were so inclined. I just like the different styles she offers.  I am 60 years old, so some days I follow the way her mom does the work and other days I follow Beth.  It just depends on my energy level.

The workouts require very little coordination, which is great for new exercisers, but I thought it was boring. It was mainly a repeat of hamstring curls, toe taps, v-steps, grapevines over and over again. I also feel like I lost quite a bit of strength during this program.  I did like the workout with the toning band, but the other strength workouts were uninspiring. I really like Jessica's YouTube channel and thought this would be great based on the reviews, but I can't really argue with the lack of results.",1475020800,2,684,4.7

My goal was to improve my balance and flexibility which have both suffered in the last three years as I moved around the country. I tend to focus on the fun cardio stuff. My balance, strength and flexibility have really improved so I chose to buy some of your DVDs - WOW. The workouts are varied and super fun.

7332672,5,B011D5G982,"I love these! They have completely changed my outlook on working out. Guess what? Working out doesn't actually have to make you miserable! Jessica is encouraging without bashing you in the face with your current weight, or making you feel like a failure, or even criticizing you if you can't finish the full set of reps, unlike several other popular trainers. She makes a big deal in every segment about pointing out the lower impact options. It's really helpful and doesn't make me beat myself up when I can't quite reach the higher impact exercise. I've tried all the workouts in this package so far, but my favorites are the 30 minute Fat Blaster and 30 minute Strength Interval Walk. I'm glad I got the package with the mix of workouts - I can usually find something I'm in the mood for, even after a rough day. The 30 day training schedule on the back is really helpful, but if you're not already in somewhat good shape, it might take several weeks to work up to the demands.
I'm definitely going to purchase more!",1471132800,2,1019,4.543478260869565

7332678,5,B011D5G982,"This is an excellent DVD set and tremendous value for the cost! I have knee issues and cannot do high impact workouts anymore, but I need a high-intensity workout to maintain my fitness level. This set of DVDs provides that intensity but with all low impact moves. The set also offers an extensive variety in workout types; even though all the workouts are walking based, each workout - and there are at least three on each individual disc - is very different with differing combinations of moves, so you never feel like you are doing the same workout over and over, as I have seen with some other multi-disc workout sets. The instructor, Jessica Smith, is upbeat and enthusiastic, without being ""over-the-top"" as some workout stars tend to be. These workouts are like working out with a good friend, positive and encouraging but no whooping or screaming which I do not enjoy. I would highly recommend this as a well-rounded total workout system for anyone looking for high-intensity, but low-impact workouts, and plenty of variety to keep you from getting bored",1468972800,10,1062,4.87292817679558

In the past I've had a hard time sticking with and doing programs like this every day b/c I'd lose motivation but these keep me wanting to do more. Even though it's ""walking"", I still end up sweating every time! I also LOVE the countdown clock that appears towards the end.

Hoping that after I take off a few more pounds and build up some stamina I will be able to do what Jessica is doing. Don't know if I will ever get to the level that Beth is at. But it is fun watching Beth!!

This set is not boring at all if you follow the suggested daily guide on the back. I like having the count down clock on the screen for the last few minutes. Makes me push myself.

I was afraid that a work out DVD would be ""cheesy"" but I do love it. Jessica is very clear with her instructions and telling you what is coming up next. Love that she tells you what muscles each move targets.",1467849600,,868,3.8707865168539324

7332692,5,B011D5G982,"Hoo-whee! I just did the day 1 work out (30 minute HIIT Party). Jessica Smith is so refreshing after doing Leslie Sansone videos for the last x years. I didn't buy the set on Amazon, so I'm not showing up as a verified buyer. I'm not a newbie to exercising. I walk my dogs every morning at 6 am for 40 minutes at a fast pace plus I do PiYo every day. This set is my first experience with Jessica Smith. I'm pretty happy with the great workout!! This will definitely be my ""go to"" workout if it's raining out in the morning plus my after work exercise. (I work out of my home, so this can take the place of my previous 40 minute one-way commute, just as my morning walk is my ""commute"" now.) Background on me: rheumatoid arthritis in my hands, osteoarthritis in my knees, plus lower back pain.

I think that if someone were completely new to exercise DVDs, particularly walking DVDs, they might find the workout a bit scary - but stick with it!! I like that you can choose what intensity you work out at by following her mom (low), Jessica (mid), or the other gal (higher).

Alternatively, if you are into high intensity workouts like PX90, T25, etc., you might find these workouts too easy. (I've tried some of these, but I felt they were too hard on the knees for me.)",1466985600,2,1269,4.305439330543933

Do NOT be fooled....it's only 30 minutes but by far the most effective workout I have ever done with not too strenuous of an effort (for knees and back)  with major results. The scale has only budged four pounds but the inches are flying off and as a result am contemplating throwing out the scale because I am gaining muscle (NOT BULK) and losing amazing inches!

This program is similar, but a bit more challenging in a lot of ways since it incorporates a bit more moves. The set also includes a ""30 Day Program"" that is a ""playlist"" of workouts on the back of the box for maximum results.

On each of the workouts, you'll see the same three people: Jessica, her mom & a family friend. Each person demonstrates a different ""level"" of fitness & shows you appropriate modifications. At first, I kind of missed seeing a bunch of different people during all the workouts...but after awhile, it's easier because I know I can follow Debbie for this set & Jessica for that one & Beth for that other one. Since they're always in the same ""place""...it's easier to remember & not having too many people on the screen is actually better.

7332715,5,B011D5G982,"I have used Leslie Sansone for years and even started a lunch walking group at work of a mile at lunch in the meeting room. Personally I had been using a mix of work out programs including Leslie Sansone's Walking routines, 21 Day Fix, and XTF Max, but Jessica's set came up when I was looking for something new to beat routine boredom, and this quickly has become my favorite because it has all the elements I want in a daily 30 minute package (or more if you want), and I felt I got the best results with this program because I could work at my ideal level without pain or injury without modifying the heck out of the moves. I like that there is a 30 day program laid out, but I mix it up depending on if I am doing it at work over lunch or at home and what equipment I have available. I have just ordered the 60 day set I am so impressed and happy with this fun, fast, and result-producing program, and I need to keep variety. Thank you for a great program, Jessica! I will recommend this to my friends, family, and coworkers.",1463616000,,1029,4.15

I had been using Leslie Sansone Videos for years, but was getting very tired of her chatter, and the fact that she only had young, very fit people in her new videos.
Jessica is my daughter's age, and so I am thrilled that I can exercise with her and her mom. I feel very motivated doing the videos, my clothes fit better, I have lost weight, and although I may be a bit sore after the toning videos, it is a good sore.  I get a great work out, do not feel I am at risk of damaging anything, and I feel motivated.  I discovered Jessica on YouTube, and then decided to buy the 30 day 3 cd set.  I have a feeling I will enjoy all 30 days, and most likely add more of her DVD's to my collection. Thank you for making these videos.",1463270400,,858,3.9709302325581395

I really appreciate the schedule Jessica has provided - my ""training"" can be a little haphazard, but by following her choices in order, I feel I'm gaining far more benefit than simply ""putting in the miles."" The bonus sections on chair stretch, back care and standing abs are terrific, and they have been wisely Incorporated into the schedule. I also enjoy Jessica's style of encouragement, and it's great to see her mother (who is probably my age) participating so actively. My only complaint is that I can't get some of Jessica's DVDs delivered to Canada; I hope Amazon will rectify that soon.",1462060800,,669,4.775862068965517

This program (as with all of Jessica's routines) proves that a 30-40 minute workout can be highly effective and help  you achieve your health goals.

The exercises are perfect for everyone.  There is a 30 day schedule on the back of the box that really takes the guess work out of too.

The back of the cover has a complete list of the 30 days and which exercises to do.  Every day, I get home from work, automatically put on my workout clothes so I won't get too comfortable, and I get started.  I like that there's the same 3 ladies in all the DVDs, and each has a level to follow.  It's not cheesy, and it's fun! You'll need a set of dumbbells, I use 3 pounds, and a flex band for a few of the routines.  I had to purchase the band and I bought the STOTT PILATES Flex-Band Two-Pack off amazon, which works great. I've felt great, and have noticed a difference in my weight in a few weeks already.  Pair this set with eating healthy and you're set.  Perfect for those who don't want to go to the gym, or don't have too much time in the day.  Most workouts are 30 minutes. I highly recommend this set!",1457049600,4,973,4.08421052631579

Her mother stays on the beginners level (my current level), Jessica and Beth are more advanced so it doesn't matter if you're just starting out like me or if you are more in shape. My eight year old daughter even works out with Jessica. These DVD are great! I also purchased Walk On: 15-Minute Fast Fat Blasts after seeing how much I enjoyed this series.

She is spot-on with her ques and although she is perky, she is not annoying about it!  Her different moves keep the workouts interesting and doable at every level!  Although I don't FEEL like I am working as hard as some of the other walk videos I have done, I have noticed my pants feeling looser and am pleased to feel these workouts are working!

Jessica is cheerful, encouraging and actually makes working out fun.  i didn't buy these with the intent that i'd loose a heap of weight but i did weigh myself at the start of the month and at the end of the month and i'd lost 5 lbs. i felt a lot stronger and exercising with Jessica did wonders for my mood! way happier! i'm going to by another jesscia video since i liked this one so well.",1456358400,8,688,4.292307692307692

I am on Day 5 and I honestly love every session I have done!  I feel like I am hitting every muscle and the variety of her workouts ensures that we cover cardio, strength, stretches, cool downs.  There is nothing I do not like about this Walk On program.  I still have not completed all the workouts, and I have not lost interest, I workout everyday after work and on weekends.  I feel energized and good about myself after I complete a workout which leads me to make better choices in my diet.

She is encouraging and explains the exercises and how they are helping improve your body, core, and balance. I always feel like I get a great workout with her DVDs. This collection has a good variety of exercises. I like that the DVDs are broken up into segments with varying times. This gives me the flexibility to vary my workout time, depending on my schedule. I have more time on the weekend to do a longer workout.

Jessica is a master at showing you modifications so you can tailor her workouts to your level of fitness (beginning, intermediate, or advanced). And her cueing is excellent. There is very little dead air in her videos. She is always explaining things to you and giving you encouragement. She has a great personality, too. She makes exercising fun for me.

She has great resources on her website.

7332774,5,B011D5G982,"I am so hooked on these DVD's!  Jessica Smith is a professional.  No nonsensical talking during her walks, and she lets you know exactly what to do and when to do it, always encouraging, with a smile on her face.  The workouts are also with two other lovely women.  There are no surprise or awkward moves, and just when you feel like you've had enough of one particular exercise, she switches to something else.  Many times, she goes back to walking in place.  It's Never boring and it's low impact!!!  I'm 53 years old and am in good shape, but my knees have developed some arthritis, so these exercises are perfect for me.  There is a different plan for each day, so it never gets boring.  In addition, most of them are only 30 minutes each, so before you know it, you're nearly done!  I found myself waking up earlier before work (which I never do!) because I'm motivated to do her next walk.  I also feel really good after that.  If I don't do it in the morning, I'll do it after work, and I feel it's just as effective.  I highly recommend Jessica Smith's workouts!!!",1454544000,4,1072,4.380710659898477

This is only day 2 and I am feeling a difference already! Thank you Jessica Smith for this workout! I look forward to seeing how this progresses!,1454457600,5,435,4.023255813953488

For the last 4 days, I've added this program after my outdoor walk and just love it!  Great variety and Jessica is so friendly and nice to spend that extra 30 minutes with!  And the upper body/whole body exercises are a great addition to the power walking.  Highly recommend this program -- I'm 61 and in fairly good shape, but starting to see and feel changes to my muscle tone -- and this is pretty low impact although challenging, and there are modifications so it can fit whatever you're looking for.  I've also got Jessica's 6 week total transformation system and will move on to that after finishing the 30 day program, and with the rotation calendar they've set up, shouldn't have any of the usual boredom you get with some videos...

7332781,5,B011D5G982,"I am so incredibly impressed with these tapes. Three years ago, I lost 50 lbs. after the birth of my baby using Leslie Sansone tapes. I loved Leslie at first, but I found that her tapes became repeititive quickly, and I thought the women in the later tapes were becoming more plastic. Not to mention that most of the music was terrible.

Jessica Smith is completely different. It's like being in the living room with an everyday person. No one is even slightly plastic, the music is great, and I work harder than I ever worked with Leslie, while actually feeling my abs. My goal is health and fitness, not weight loss, and although I have not lost any weight on Day 11 of the 30 Day Challenge, I can feel the difference in my posture and my clothes, so I am happy!

I am grateful that I tried these tapes, and although I am grateful to Leslie Sansone for introducing me to indoor fitness walking, I cannot see myself going  back. I'm interested to see where a full 30 days with Jessica will take me!",1453680000,13,999,4.360215053763441

She conveys the feeling of genuine interest in your self improvement which is so different from many trainers on  videos. I honestly feel I know her, Debby and Beth (others in the videos) personally. One nice touch is explanations of how to do the exercises safely to protect the body. Due to the optimistic approach I look forward to doing this group of routines everyday.

7332797,5,B011D5G982,"I have tried tons of fitness videos and these are by far my favorite. I love following the 30 day routine because it makes me stick with the program and gives me so much variety which is a MUST so I don't get bored of my workouts. That has to be the best part, always keeping it interesting by rotating through the routines and combining different routines as well.
The moves are simple enough to follow almost immediately which I love since other videos have movements that are too complex or advanced for me to follow and therefore I don't feel like I'm getting the quality workout I want. I love the different versions of the moves in order to give options for beginners, intermediate or advanced exercisers.
Jessica is the best instructor too I've come across. I love that she points out how you should be breathing during the exercise (i.e. heavy or light enough to be chatting), that it's okay to be sweaty during the exercise, what muscles we are working, the different versions of the moves, breaks down the moves slowly before picking up the pace, she counts accurately (I hate instructors who are like ""okay only one more time"" then make you do it 5 more times, it is discouraging).
I have also noticed I'm always RIGHT on the verge of feeling like I need to relax my muscles from a certain move and right at that moment we go back to a walk or side step or change up the move to work different muscles so I never have to give up before we switch--it keeps me motivated and feeling positive and strong.
Purchasing these videos was an excellent decision on my part to work towards my weight loss and fitness goals. After 1 month I'm already feeling stronger and have better stamina.
Resistance bands and dumbbells are required. A yoga block is preferred but I use a rolled up blanket for the chair stretch routine (chair obviously required, I use a dining chair that isn't perfect but works well enough).",1451433600,6,1913,4.531791907514451

This set gives me a great workout and in the process I feel amazing...not beat up like some of the other sets I have tried and discontinued.  It has a variety of workouts which includes weights/bands (which I love), cardio, and bonus workouts too.

I sweat and feel like I have had a workout without being hard on my joints. My goal is to firm up and not look like a body builder. I have ordered her new set of the Walk Strong with a 25% discount and look forward to engaging in the 6 week program.

7332804,5,B011D5G982,"I ordered this workout program a week or so ago, it was delivered early - which is great because I was so excited to try this out! I immediately popped in one of the dvds and gave it a go! Now I would consider myself a fairly active person, I typically work out once a day and have been into fitness for over three years and have lost over 100 lbs (primarily by workout out at home). I have always used Leslie Sansone DVD's, especially when I first started exercising. Despite doing more intense workouts (Insanity, Turbo Fire, etc.) I have always gone back to walking DVDs for those days that you just don't want to go all out. Well my Leslie dvd's were getting blah and boring, even after getting some of her newer DVDs. I searched for an alternative - and up popped Jessica Smith! Even the previews to her Walk On dvd series was so appealing - The colours! The set! The music! and omg The MOVES! So needless to say, this was a breath of fresh air. As soon as I started the first workout, it immediately ignited that amazing feeling of ""I found an awesome program that I will be hooked to instantly for a very long time.""

The music - It is a solid mix of dance/techno - better than most at home DVD music. The moves matched the music almost to a T! I especially love how the music just flowed from one beat to another without stopping - it definitely kept me going and I did not lose motivation through out the workout. Music makes a huge difference for me, though I was hoping more Latin Beats that Jessica typically uses on her youTube videos - but this music is good too!

Clock - There is a count down clock that pops up at the last 10 mins of the workout. I absolutely LOVE this idea that it is not on the screen for the whole workout and before you know it - that clock pops up and you just give it because you know the workout is almost done!

Effective - I found the moves to be very simple but POWERFUL! My abs were burning hard at some points - something I do not get with Leslie! Just how the arms move I guess - but wow! The variety was so entertaining and fun!

Trainer - Jessica seems so motivating and positive! Generally, very enjoyable to listen to and says the right thing at the right time. Cuing is fast, but after you watch her once or twice - you catch on to her method and she is easy to follow, especially once you learn the steps and routines. Many people have also mentioned the scenery and set. I must say, I really LOVE the all white set with bright clothing. It is some how almost refreshing, clean, professional, and fun/exciting to look at! However, it is the same in all of the dvds - which really doesn't bother me too much (yet.) Ask me again in a few months, and I might change my tune on this.

I am kind of disappointed to only find a few more options on DVD. I am not really a huge fan of using youtube for workouts...I would much rather buy the DVD and pop it in the player. Her Walk On dvd options are limited, so I am really hoping this chicky makes MORE! I am a fan for life after 1 workout, and I will be spreading the word up here in Canada!!",1450396800,46,3089,4.1331114808652245

7332815,5,B011D5G982,"Jessica is the real deal.  This is my first experience with her walking videos, but it didn't take long to realize she genuinely knows her craft and cares about you, the viewer.  Shes encouraging without being pushy.  She, her mom and their family friend offer modifications that are actually do-able (although I don't attempt the high-level modifications).  Shes conversational without being overly chatty like other instructors tend to be.  The music, in my opinion, is excellent and her cuing is impeccable.  Over the years, Ive owned hundreds of exercise videos from dozens of instructors who (again, this is just my opinion) ranged from exceptional to embarrassingly and laughably poor.  Jessica deserves a spot in my top 10, if not the top 5.
As for the walking workouts themselves, I like them and they don't hurt.  Im a 510 54-year-old woman with osteoarthritis in the knees, which rules out several types of exercise.  I used to run stairs (or just climb really fast).  I lost several inches, but after all that pounding my body told me to knock it off and I spent many, many months recovering from injuries.  Its taken me seemingly forever to find an activity I can actually sustain without getting bored or without the workout taking too long.
Have I lost any weight using this 30-day program?  No, but this has nothing to do with Jessica or these videos.  This is all me because I am sorely lacking in the discipline required to work out at home.  I managed the first four days and then moved on to something else.  Please understand it is NOT because of the quality of the workouts or instructor.  It is purely my lack of discipline to stick with anything for longer than a week before I have to switch up.
My goal is not to get to a certain size, but to move and do SOMETHING every day.  My plan is to make Jessica part of this.  In fact, her Walk On 15-Minute Fat Blasts is already in the cart.  '
If you want a down-to-earth, extremely knowledgeable and personable instructor who doesnt yak your ear off so much that you want to exercise the mute button, purchase Jessicas videos.
If you want variety in the moves and music that doesnt suck so much you want to exercise the mute button, purchase Jessicas videos.

I started looking at her workouts there and love them so I started buying her DVD's to support her. Her workouts are great because she is REAL! She doesn't try to over do it. She looks great. She gives 3 different levels. Her motivation during the workout is real, on one she says "" I know this is where you want to go do this or do that..."" and she was right! So she caught my attention, but not in a bossy way, in a hang in there way.  I have done the workouts for 5 days straight...I am going to keep going....I am going to see a difference. I stopped working out a year ago and I need something to get me back into it....This is it.  The workouts are effective. They are not boring. She tells you what they are working.  You sweat.",1449446400,,901,4.1022727272727275

7332823,5,B011D5G982,"Another great workout from one of my favorite trainers.  Jessica never disappoints with her great cuing, just the right amount of encouragement in a pleasant tone, and wonderful variety.

7332825,5,B011D5G982,"I'm in my 50's and I love these workouts. They are challenging enough for me to get results, without being so hard that I can't move the next day. Jessica gives good options for a higher or lower level of intensity. Hey, if her mom can do this, then so can I! The workouts are fun and have enough variety to avoid being boring on repeat. Other trainers forget to change which foot they lead with, or keep repeating the same 3 moves over and over. These workouts don't have those errors. Jessica has a positive, fun attitude that encourages you to do your best, and she's not too pushy, too ""happy"" or too sugary.",1449273600,,612,4.3304347826086955

Get this set -- you won't be disappointed.",1449014400,3,314,4.25

She has become my favorite fitness instructor. I have others in my top 5, but Jessica has earned the spot of number 1 because she is so personable and cues so well. I always feel like I am exercising with a friend when I work out to one of her routines. I love the fact that the moves are doable. Some may be challenging, but I never get the dread factor.

I like that she explains why we do some things that are unusual and the moves that help with balance and posture. I'm 57, in good shape but tired of doing hard workouts. These are challenging enough to feel sore abs and see a change in my waistline. When I give up the sugary junk food I'm sure I'll lose weight, too. What will I do with all my other walking videos?",1448496000,,505,4.326315789473684

They aren't terribly unique compared to her other walking DVD's but this package includes a huge variety. I love the HIIT walks, I think Jessica makes them fun and doable no matter your fitness level or how much energy you have at the time. Her last DVD (the 5 mile walk) didn't click with me, I almost didn't purchase this after that. I'm glad I did.
I'm an intermediate to advanced exerciser, and I'm able to break a sweat (but not die) following the more advanced moves. If you like Jessica, you'll like this.",1448409600,5,628,4.469565217391304
7332834,5,B011D5G982,"I absolutely loved this program!! I followed for the full 30 days and enjoyed it!  My favorite routine was the Toning Walk that used the resistance band - for two reasons; using the band was just a different way to work your muscles, when I use dumbells most of the time, and secondly, I LOVED the music at the end!!! I don't know what that song is but it is such a relaxing way to end the workout! :)  I am at my goal weight, and this workout series helped me maintain and the best part is I felt great!!  Jessica's workouts have shown me time and time again that working out can FEEL GOOD and still make you feel worked out-  but not so strenuous that you dread it or feel pain.  I highly recommend!!",1448323200,,702,4.132352941176471

I have several of Jessica's dvds - usually her style works for me - but for some reason, the workouts, the choreography - it was missing a BIG ""IT"" factor for me.  I used it for a few days and had to stop.  I was uninspired, bored, just not motivated to complete the program.  I went back to Leslie and am currently doing her program now and its better in terms of simplistic moves, etc.  I still subscribe to Jessica but I couldn't get into this one.  (Note:  if you return this, Jessica's company will charge a $19.97 restock fee.  I disputed this with Amazon and I was able to get my full refund.  Very disappointed in the gesture shown to charge me a God-awful restocking fee when there was nothing listed under the Return Policy that outlined as such, not to mention I returned it within what the timeframe allows).  That customer service return experience left a very bad taste in my mouth - will think twice before buying her dvds.)",1447718400,31,999,4.32258064516129

I like that each day is planned out for me and different each day,each week. Jessica is easy to watch and listen to and she gives good cues and direction. She gives gentle encouragement as opposed to bootcamp drill sergeant commands.  She does the whole workout with you and has her mother and Beth to show different levels. There are no tricky moves and it takes a small amount of space. The music is a little meh but I am ok with that, at least it's not annoying.  I have not  lost weight but that is a diet issue not the workouts fault. I do feel it has improved my strength,posture, and balance. I plan on repeating this next month. I thought the price was very reasonable especially as there were no annoying ads for vitamins and shakes like on the Beachbody dvds.",1444953600,,906,4.286549707602339

She continues the evolution of the Walk On series here.  Lots of variety in this set, with some added intensity & resistance training thrown in.  For those of you who loved the 21 day plan, you'll love this even more. Longer workouts (30 & 40 minutes) predominate with an even mix of cardio focused & resistance/toning focused workouts.
Those of you who are new to Jessica (where have you been, under a rock?!)- welcome!  You've reached the right place.  This set is also the ideal one to start with.  No matter your fitness level or goals, this set is pretty much all you need. Cardio, resistance, steady state, hiit- it's all here.  Challenging but realistic & safe.
Jessica is the best part about it, as always.  She's just plain delightful.

She makes everything so fun and her encouragement kept me going on days when I just didn't feel like I could. Her program is so doable simply because she doesn't make it so overwhelming. You can do more based on 3 options that she provides thru herself, Debbie (her mom) and Beth. She stresses throughout the series to listen to your body. I am on Day 25 and have lost a dress size, inches and even some tightening up in there...lol. You can't go wrong by ordering this series.",1444348800,3,717,4.480916030534351

There is definitely too much white at that set. After working out on the first and second DVD, the white did not bother me so much, but now, all her other DVDs have been at the SAME white set. It's just too much. I purchased these and knew that it was the same set but because the workouts are really good, I did not have a choice but to buy them. But I am strongly hoping that she will change the set/location, Now for the review on the actual workouts: I did the HIITS 30 minute workout. It's amazing.

Each DVD comes with at least an hour of workouts, including bonus workouts. My wife loves all of the Jessica Smith workouts including the positive upbeat countenance of Jessica, and the best thing about her workouts is that there is an option to modify. Sometimes you can't always do the toughest extras with Beth but these workouts truly allow you to push yourself without burning out. My wife is halfway through the challenge and is excited to integrate these DVD's into her daily routines.

My torso is firming up and I have more muscle tone in my arms and legs.  I love that there are so many workouts, and that nearly all of them are done while standing.  Even after 21 days, I feel like each workout is new.  And quite frankly, Jessica moves so quickly and varies the routine so much that you don't have time to get bored.  I also like it that her mom does the low impact moves while Beth does high intensity.  When I've finished the 30 days, I'm going to do other workouts for a couple weeks then do this 30-day workout again.  Jessica, please do more workouts like this.",1443312000,,697,4.111111111111111

7332881,5,B011D5G982,"Others have given excellent breakdowns and observations so not much I can add except to say these are EXCELLENT workouts.  I had always known Jessica for the more advanced workouts which look great, but I knew I wouldn't do very often as I too have beaten up my body over the years exhausting myself and now I don't desire to do that anymore.  I want a good workout where I feel worked out without feeling whipped and that's what this series provides. You have every type of cardio from low to advanced that most anyone can do.  If you can move, you can do most of these moves which makes it accessible for every age group.  I wish some were a tad bit longer or that the cool-down in some where not as long but that's very minor and doesn't take from the enjoyment of the workout.  My favorite is Megaburn and my love/hate is Strength Interval only because I really feel it, especially that upper body series, which I feel the burn using only 5lbs and 8lbs for lower body.  Honestly though they are all very good and I have NO dread factor in doing any of them.  I'm almost through the Sept challenge, which this is the first time I've ever stuck with one the entire month.  Given that she sold out in short order, she seems to have tapped into a market that has been dominated by another walking star champion whom I enjoy also.  I never considered buying more walking workouts, but Jessica's creativity and innovation in putting this together is hard to beat, she manages to avoid a lot of repetition and I like seeing her mom and Beth, who I agree are real people and relatable and inspirational in their own right.  She's friendly, cues great and inclusive without being too chatty or distracted.  As I mentioned in another review for walk on 21 days, she has added a higher level of workouts than many on the market that you WANT to do.  A very challenging task indeed, but accomplished here.  I saw where she's coming out with something to include cardio/strength/yoga/pilates combo early next year so can't wait to see what that will be like.  Awesome job Jessica and company.",1443052800,8,2083,4.4907161803713525

This workout includes all the essential types of different workouts for an efficient fitness program; it includes two different strength training workouts, HIIT, steady state cardio, and even relaxing stretches.

I am an intermediate exerciser (leaning towards advanced), so I always follow the advanced modifications when available.  This program is so versatile, and really great for all fitness levels. Jessica has truly outdone herself & I can't wait for her to create more DVDs.  I can't decide which program I love more, this one or her 21 Day walking program.",1442880000,2,783,4.976923076923077
7332884,5,B011D5G982,"I have all of Jessicas walking DVDs and this set is by far my favorite because of its variety and bonus routines.  She is her usual perky self and has Debbie (her mom) and her friend Beth as modifiers if you want lower or higher intensity. The set is bright white, which fits nicely with the colorful outfits the three are wearing.  I really enjoyed the music  some of her DVDs use repetitive tunes but in this one the music is suited to the exercise you're doing.  A lot of moves are familiar but they didn't feel overused and the bonus routines were excellent, especially the one for your back since it also works your core and glutes.  I wish she had included more toning segments but thats a minor quibble.  Highly recommend!  Here is a brief breakdown of each disc and the exercises included:

Disc 1: Major Metabolism Booster

Pyramid Power Walk (30 minutes):  This was a fun walk that got the heartrate up!  As it sounds, Jessica starts off slowly then increases the intensity until youve reached the top of the pyramid before bringing you back down.  I wish she had kept us at the top of the pyramid a bit longer and that the warm up/cool down portions didn't take so much time (i.e. you're only really working for 20 minutes) but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

Strength Interval Walk (30 minutes):  I LOVED this routine!  I have Jessicas 21 Day Walk On program and while there is a Strength Interval Walk in that series (Shred and Tred) I liked this one much better.  Jessica focuses on the chest, shoulders, biceps, triceps and back muscles; she also includes squats and lunges for the legs (these were less difficult than those on Shred and Tred).  She as usual incorporates some ab work at the end such as side crunches and a few exercises done with weights.  Many of the moves are combinations, such as plies with chest pulls and lunges with tricep kickbacks, which is a double bang for your buck.

BONUS 20 Minute Chair Stretch: If you're familiar with Jessica youll know most of these stretches already but they were relaxing and a good breather for your muscles.  After working on your neck (think side to side head tilts) she does a modified warrior pose on the chair, forward folds, and side twists.  She follows that with a few standing exercises to elongate the hamstrings and quadriceps.

Disc 2: Three Weight Loss Walks

15 Minute Calorie Burst:  Similar to her other 15 minute walks but a bit faster; this would be good as an add-on or stand-alone if you're short on time.

30 Minute Fat Blaster:  This walk alternates between 5 minutes of steady state moderate intensity and 5 minutes of higher intensity (10 minutes total for each) to get the heart rate up and the sweat pouring.  V steps, uphill climbers, high knees, speed bag with shuffling, and jogging/power walking are all included.  A lot of Jessica's signature moves but still fun and efficient!  I know some complain about the 5 minute warm up and 5 minute cool down (i.e. only 20 minutes of really ""working"") I think it's better for the joints.  I have a few of Jessica's workouts (10 Pounds Down: Better Body Blast and Barre Fitness, etc.) that don't include much of a warm up or cool down and while I do them on my own I think they're essential for beginners.  Just my opinion!

40 Minutes Mega Burn:  This segment is intended to build endurance as although the walk is less intense than HIIT it keeps the heart rate elevated the entire time (i.e. no breaks).  High knees, skaters, V steps, karaoke moves, grapevines, and hamstring curls are all here and usually accompanied by arm or ab work.  I was sweating bullets but not out of breath; Jessica states that she wants us to be able to talk normally but in shorter sentences due to fast nature of the walk.  Mission accomplished!

BONUS 15 Minute Standing Abs:  A series of ab exercises done standing that require a bit of balance.  Side chops, twists with leg raises, and oblique crunches are included.

Disc 3: 5 Day Fat Burn

HIIT Walk (30 minutes):  I normally HATE HIIT but I sort of liked this one.  Jessica calls it a party and while Id hardly go there it was more enjoyable than other HIIT routines Ive tried.  A lot of jogging, invisible jump ropes, low jacks, side to side shuffles, etc.  I loved the music  it fit the segment perfectly.  You didn't need any cuing to know when the next HIIT round was because the music became faster paced!

Toing Walk (30 minutes):  In my opinion this was less about toning and more about cardio.  Yes, Jessica uses the band to work your back, biceps, chest and triceps but I didn't find the leg exercises challenging and band was sort of cumbersome to work with.  I only had a 5 foot one and it was difficult to do some of the moves properly at that length.

BONUS 15 Minute Healthy Back Workout:  I have a strong back to begin with but these exercises are great for maintaining your core and posture.  Youll need a resistance band as she uses one for superman moves, standing arm raises, and bridges.  She does the dead bug, which really works the abdominals and is quite unique.  I loved this routine because it focuses on your back muscles, glutes and abs; she packs a lot into 15 minutes.",1442188800,24,5173,4.526997840172786
7332885,5,B011D5G982,"This is another outstanding workout set by Jessica and Company.  I was reluctant to buy this since I recently discovered and purchased all her other four 2015 releases:  I thought I would be getting mere repeat routines.  I was wrong!  Jessica continues to offer unique workouts and includes exercises that focus on the fitness and health of the entire body.  She is an wonderful teacher--kind and supportive and precise in explanations.  Her workouts take a holistic approach to fitness.  I am a 59-year-old advanced exerciser who had become burned out by most of the punishing dvds I own.  I am in great shape, but I had lost my energy and desire to work out anymore.  At first I thought Jessica's ""walks"" would be too simple for me, but I was wrong.  They are challenging in a good way because Jessica understands how to get your heart rate up and strengthen your muscles, but she also understands important aspects of fitness like agility, coordination, and stretching, and she views fitness as a more complex process than many other best-selling exercise dvd instructors that just seem to beat up your body up with tough exercise routines. Yes, you get in shape with those other dvds, but, at least for me,  at a cost.  I am so impressed with the variety and extent of Jessica's fitness knowledge.  I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with any of her 2015 dvds.  This last one is sensational, but they are all terrific.  Her mom, Debbie,  and friend, Beth, round out the exercise group, and it's great to exercise with some real people.  All are upbeat and positive.  You can't help but feel better and get into great shape with these workouts.  I'm a convert!",1442188800,20,1671,4.739583333333333
7332886,5,B011D5G982,"I'm very happy with this purchase.  It's exactly what I was looking for as well as easy to follow.  I really like Jessica Smith's workout videos . . . she's positive, she explains everything clearly and I feel I get an excellent workout.  I would recommend these videos to anyone who asked me about them.",1442188800,2,304,4.490909090909091
7332887,5,B011D5G982,"As with all of Jessica's walking routines these ones fit into anyone's lifestyle and fitness needs.  You can do these videos if you are just starting out or are an experienced exerciser there are plenty of options to keep you going!!

The ""3 Weight Loss Walks"" will keep you moving.  With 15, 30 and 40 minute walks to choose from you can fit them into any time of the day no matter how much time you have and walk away feeling revved and ready for anything!  They are all completely different and you work hard every minute.  The Bonus Standing Abs workout works your abs without ever doing a crunch or hitting the floor!  Loved all 4 routines!

On the ""5 Day Fat Burn"" you have a HIIT walk, I always try to avoid HIIT I really struggle with it but when I finished this 30 minutes I was thinking 'Wow, I did it!'  I will definitely be adding this routine to my weekly rotation!  It was tough yet has enough progression that you can work up your endurance and keep working toward better health!  The Toning Walk is one of my favorite.  For this walk you use a resistance band.  In the DVD they use the wide 6' long band.  I only had a 4' and after that snapped (routine really needs a 6' band) I used my thin resistance band and still got a great workout with it.  I loved every minute and feel stronger every time I do the routine!  The Healthy Back Bonus workout is a REALLY awesome workout!  Toning the lower and upper back as well as the abs. The ""dead bug"" ab move was my favorite and surprised me with how well it worked my abs!!

The last DVD ""Major Metabolism Booster"" includes the Pyramid Power Walk.  This was a fun walk, instead of intervals it takes you slowly up and then slowly back down. Hence the pyramid. :)  Keeps you moving and your heart rate up and keeps building your stamina and endurance!  The Strength Interval Walk is by far my favorite workout.  I love weight training and this walk has both cardio and strength.  Will yet again progression and improvement you can use the walk for years to come and keep getting stronger.  The Bonus Chair Stretch really utilizes the chair well and helps get your muscles stretched out deeper than you can on your own.  Excellent way to wrap up a week of tough workouts or even a stressful day!

Overall the DVDs work well together and the 30 day plan she created keeps you energized and wanting more.  However, the DVDs work well on their own and each could be incorporated with another workout routine as well.  They are all fun and as always Jessica keeps us wanting to move!!  Excellent add to my workout collections!  Keep the awesome workouts headed our way Jessica!!  A+++",1442188800,4,2640,4.383505154639176
7332888,5,B011D5G982,"I just love this new set; Jessica did it again!  It has a little of everything low-impact cardio, toning, stretching and core work.

She is fun, never repetitive, does infinitely more variety of moves than Leslie so that you never get bored. Jessica's workouts are brilliantly choreographed and her cues her excellent!!! She works your entire body. She makes you work hard but nothing a normal person like me who is 51. I truly have no favorite Jessica walking workout as they are excellent and i rotate them regularly. my only complaint is that I want her to come out with more walking workouts (of which she is the master) so I will have more in my rotation.",1441843200,89,613,4.5225225225225225

The fact that her mom and friend, two everyday regular people are in her workouts make exercising more realistic. Thank you Jessica for these dvd's. Thank you for shipping to Canada! I no longer have back pain by doing these workouts. I am very emotional at the changes that have occurred to my body. I have other serious health issues that have cleared because of your workouts!!! Jessica, you make exercising fun, and encourage us to come back each day and work out with you. The music and setting in your dvd's are fantastic.",1441670400,2,696,4.713114754098361
7332892,5,B011D5G982,Thanks to all who provided detailed reviews of each of the workouts in this DVD set.  They were very helpful and gave an excellent overview of each workout.  I love this new box set from Jessica Smith.  I have several of her DVDs and have added this one as well to my collection. (Her youtube videos are awesome as well). Walking videos can be boring and repetitious but Jessica does an excellent job here of varying the pace and the moves of each workout to keep things fresh for all fitness levels. The workouts provide a variety of routines and there is definitely one for whatever your fitness level.  I love how she incorporates simple kickboxing moves into several of the workouts.  I love kickboxing and would love to see a dedicated kickboxing video from Jessica as well.  I definitely recommend this box set to anyone who loves working out in their home and especially if you enjoy walking videos.  Thanks Jessica!,1441584000,2,923,4.660493827160494
7332893,5,B011D5G982,"I'm a huge fan of Jessica Smith. I was afraid this program would be too repetitive to the other walking DVDs she's made, but it's not. I really enjoy that she put the rotational calendar on the back to keep it simple. I'm doing her 30-day program as part of my morning walks and I'm adding some of her strength or cardio DVDs/videos into my happy hour workout. Love it",1441497600,3,368,4.271428571428571
7332894,5,B011D5G982,"I can't call myself a recent convert to Jessica because I have her first exercise DVD by Women's Health. I have not done that particular DVD in a long while (still have it); but I do remember how I enjoyed her personality.  So recently I was looking for a new exercise DVD's and I rediscovered her again.  I have her other walking DVD's and I haven't done a review yet. I just received this on 8/31 and for this set I will do a review.  She is as usual a friendly and engaging instructor. I actually look forward to working out with her. The first previewer of this DVD set gave a detailed break down and the information is close to  what I have experienced so far.  First, this is what I like about this new set, she includes two strength training routines at 30 minutes for each. The strength training routines have a slower walking pace and that makes it easier to concentrate on getting my form right. I did the routine with the exercise band and it took some getting used to. I will have to do it again to get a better form during the routine. The routine with the dumbbells seemed easier to me. So far, I have done the HIIT walk and I loved that one. I have done the Pyramid Power Walk and that was fun. I actually threw in a bonus workout after the 30 minute Strength Interval Walk because I felt I needed more intensity. Here is what I like about this set and not in any particular order, 1) There are five 30 minute routines and this is a big deal because she accomplishes a lot in the routines she provides the home exerciser. 2) She has three 15 minute workouts which means there is no excuse not to exercise (two of the workouts are bonus routines) 3) She has nice extended 40 minute routine for more calorie burn or for more of a challenge 4) Because of the variety I can mix and match the different routines to my needs, in other words; I can challenge myself by adding another 15 minute workout. If I have a  'I don't feel like exercising day' just do one 15 minute routine. Or if I can do three 15 minute routines to give myself a long exercise session. The options she gives a home exerciser with this can go on and on. Jessica is the one to go to for viewer engaging low impact walking routines. Her enthusiasm is genuine and I look forward to exercising with her and her crew.",1441324800,22,2295,4.228310502283105

8724107,5,B011D5G982,"Jessica Smith is a wonder!  Her videos are effective, efficient and they DO burn calories - and they are fun!  I'm just fed up with doing grueling workouts that lead to injuries and are just ridiculously hard and completely exhausting.  I also used to be one of those people who thought that if a workout wasn't intense that it didn't count and that I wasn't burning enough calories.  This just simply isn't true...as long as you are watching portion sizes, making healthy choices, and not consuming over 1200 cals. a day...you will lose weight.  Workouts should be challenging but not painful!  I really wish I had figured this out sooner because my knees and joints now pay the price for all those crazy workouts I used to do....Now, however, I wake up looking forward to my day, taking my dog for a meditative walk, then completing my workouts with Jessica - I do as many walks as I want - sometimes it's a mile; other times I do the entire set.  Jessica is lovely to work out with; encouraging and pleasant and upbeat.  I really love the background scenery and Jessica's workout team members - everyone is just so happy and positive and motivated.  It's like a breath of fresh air everyday.  The end result is that I am burning calories and staying fit while eating well.  My goal is to lose 10 lbs. in 8-10 weeks (before the holidays!).  The HIIT workout is my favorite but I also loved the 40-minute mega walk.  Honestly, I like them all; I really do.  One healthy tip: If you are struggling with a sweet tooth (like I do), I would recommend  BeachBody's Shakeology protein shake.  I am NOT a coach, I just think it's the best shake out there and it's a wonderful sweet and healthy treat to help curb cravings. I know it is expensive but it's not necessary to have it everyday.  So glad I am getting back to equilibrium again - these workouts have helped me to be healthy, motivated, injury-free and most of all a lot happier!",1533513600,,1932,4.489971346704871

8724109,5,B011D5G982,"I haven't made it through all of the workouts yet, but I really like what I've tried so far.  Each video breaks down the steps into three levels when appropriate and I've been able to follow the middle level the first time through, despite being hopelessly uncoordinated.  It does make my hip ache a little, but it's better than most videos out there because there is a lot of switching up the steps, so it tends not to cramp up like doing the same marching movement repeatedly would cause.  I think the most gentle level would be extremely easy on the joints.  The hardest level does add some light jumping, while still being fairly easy on the joints.  I do feel like it's a solid workout and my hip isn't screaming in pain by the end, so I'll call it a success.

I have tried 1-2 videos from each disc, and I sped through the others to make sure they all work.  It seems like everything is in perfect working order.",1531872000,,918,4.333333333333333

This is a great low impact set that caters to every level of fitness especially for those who have bad knees from being obese like myself! Jessica is not like most cheesy over the top instructors who can easily annoy you during a workout. Shes genuine, relaxed, and makes you feel like your working out with a real friend.

8724114,5,B011D5G982,"I was never an athletic kid growing up.  I never had an interest in working out or sports until my husband and I began riding our bicycles in 2011.  We developed this real love of riding around everywhere on the trails. It didn't feel like exercise, and I got to really bond with my husband.

Fast forward to getting pregnant in 2014.  I bicycled until my second trimester, and then I had to stop because it was uncomfortable.  I had a really great pregnancy, but the delivery was pretty traumatic.  I had to have multiple blood transfusions, and I ended up in bedrest for a few months afterwards.

The last four years were a bit of a daze.  I became (quite literally) a walking feeding station for the first year or so, and it was really hard to find that rhythm in a schedule just for day-to-day living.  I am a working mother, so I found it easiest to try to get back into that rhythm first, and just kind of forgot about taking care of me.  Because of this, I ended up continually stressed out, frequently overeating, and just generally unhappy.  I was tipping the scales at 216 (I was 175 pre pregnancy).

I realized a few months ago that I needed to make a change for me.  I needed to feel like myself again. I didn't know who this person was in the mirror.  My body not only looks different, but it feels different. It's a different weight and different shape than I was pre-pregnancy.  My first stop was just learning to eat better.  No dieting, because I knew that would never work.  I started by eating smaller portions; eating small, healthy snacks; and cutting out soda all together.

After I felt I had a good handle on eating better, I looked for a workout dvd to do at home.  The first three dvds I tried made me just feel worse about myself.  They were highly rated on Amazon, but I couldn't understand why.  The coaches yelled and made me feel badly that I couldn't keep up.  I felt like a failure.  I started my search again, thinking I just couldn't ever find a workout series that fit me or that I was just ""broken"" and not good enough to do any of these dvds.  I then found Walk On: Walk the Weight Off 30 Day Plan.

The first few days were pretty rough, I won't lie.  I was clearly out of shape.  I was breathing heavily, dripping with sweat, and red in the face, but I miraculously didn't feel like a failure.  Jessica felt like a friend, holding my hand, supporting me every step of the way.  She speaks in a calm, reassuring tone, but she's also very motivating.  She seems to genuinely love what she does, and I love her camaraderie with her mom, Debbie, and Beth.  After the first week, I could make it through a workout without a red face!  Three weeks into the series, we went on vacation to San Diego to the zoo and Safari Park.  I walked over 6 miles each day, and never once got winded!

I just finished my first 30 Days, and I plan on restarting the 30 Day Plan again.  I have better posture, I feel stronger, I have more energy, and am starting to feel more like myself.  Throughout the first 30 Day Plan, I found myself doing the low-impact choices to finishing my plan doing the higher-impact choices. There is a lot of attention paid to form, which is helpful and fantastic, because I wasn't entirely confident the first few times. I am currently at 202 lbs and counting.

NOTE: You'll want to make sure you have hand weights, a yoga block (folded towels and/or a book did not work as well for me), and a resistance band for the workouts.",1529280000,,3475,4.323529411764706
8724115,5,B011D5G982,"LOVE Jessica, and LOVE this program.

After being diagnosed with Diabetes, I wanted to a lifestyle change with lots of working out, and workouts that I enjoyed and looked forward to doing every day.  I have been totally commtted to this DVD set since I got it in January.  Having the three CDs gives a great mix of different workouts (aerobic and interval training mixed with strength programs).  I do it six days a week, and ENJOY doing it.

And thanks to this great program, I then learned about Jessicas YouTube channel where I can watch videos to work out when I travel, so I can stay with the program.  LOVE that.

I cant say I lost a TON of weight on this, but Ive lost some.  I have gotten MUCH stronger and more fit though.  So, where I might not be losing on the scale, I can tell Im losing fat and gaining muscle and getting more tone with each workout.  Whats really awesome is I can see the changes in my pear-shaped legs, thighs and hips that Ive never noticed doing any kind of exercise before.  Love it!
