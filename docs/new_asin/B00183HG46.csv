8268361,5,B00183HG46,Great documentary. I was pleased to receive it as my late father was in it .,1484697600,,76,3.8125
8268362,5,B00183HG46,"I purchased this because I love trains. It did a great job of detailing the politics involved in choosing Ogden as the meeting point of the transcontinental railroad. The real fun, however, was the colorful and bit shady past of Ogden. This is a very well done video.",1336953600,2,267,4.583333333333333
8268363,5,B00183HG46,"An absolutely essential item for anyone interested in the history of Ogden, but also useful to those interested in the broader question of the growth and development of the West. Anyone interested in railroading will find this video of great interest as well.",1211241600,2,259,5.046511627906977
8268364,4,B00183HG46,"I've lived here all my life, and I've heard rumors about some of this stuff, but today I actually got to see our sordid past.  Isaac has done a nice job blending the pioneer, railroad and civic histories into one interesting story.  He has several old pictures and even some eyewitnesses to help bring this story to his audience.  Well done.  Scott Smith",1209600000,2,354,4.571428571428571
8268365,5,B00183HG46,"Ogden: Junction City of the West is a brilliant addition to the fabric of the story of the American West.  Learn first hand how a sleepy agricultural community in a mono-religious landscape (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints) was transformed into one of the most diverse places on the planet.  When you go to Ogden now, it's hard to imagine that half a century ago, millions of people each year were bustling through, on scores of trains a day.  Watch the DVD, and this remarkable past will come alive once more.  See how the 19th century's biggest transportation innovation, the railroad, brought with it a cosmopolitan influence that would change the face of Ogden, Utah forever.",1209081600,2,691,4.880341880341881
8268366,5,B00183HG46,"This wonderful film depicts a period of history in Utah that few outside the state are aware of.  Most people think ""Mormon"", Brigham Young and the temple when they hear Utah.  But if they see this colorful documentary they will soon have other terms such as Ogden, Railroad, 25th street, transportation center, Golden Spike.  Ogden began as a quiet Mormon settlement but with the coming of the railroad in 1869, things changed radically.  The population exploded with a very cosmopolitan makeup from Asian, European and African origins producing a wonderful stew of humanity.  This film brilliantly depicts some of that ""stew"" with historic photos, film clips and interviews with some old timers who remember those often wild times in Ogden, Utah.",1208995200,2,748,5.148760330578512
8268367,5,B00183HG46,"This film is excellent for all ages, especially railroad enthusiasts and history buffs. Very well done documentary that is interesting, educational and entertaining. I saw this in the movie theater and absolutely loved it. A great part of our US history that few know about and I highly recommend this film!",1208908800,,307,5.03921568627451
