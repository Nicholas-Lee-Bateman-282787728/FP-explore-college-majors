8596531,5,B007V33EIE,"Another AWESOME and Spectacular Performance. This one comes almost 5 years after the live recording of the VIVO... Gira la Vida Concert in Mendoza.
If you loved the first one, you are going to enjoy more, and treasure this one with more intensity!
For his faithful fans and followers Jorge Rojas has been kind to offer the DVD with a compilation of perfect photographs taken during the concert in an album format, to the delight of us all, of course!
This DVD is a must have, as anything that bears his name. Jorgerojas.info",1372982400,,524,4.645161290322581
