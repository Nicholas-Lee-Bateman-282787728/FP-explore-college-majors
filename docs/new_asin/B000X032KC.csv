*The story revolves around Robert who is a gifted musician. But his lack of social skills sets him apart from those around him. He's attracted to the wrong crowd who supply him with what he needs most, acceptance. He's also drawn into their world of drugs, sex, and crime. What eventually led these teenagers to act as they did was for the same reason the Manson murders occurred.
*At times, I was distracted by drawn out sequences but my curiosity kept me from fast-forwarding to the next scene. When the ending came, I realized that those scenes were necessary in order to make the events believable.
*In England, the movie is rated as suitable only for persons 18 years or older, which makes this a NC-17 rating because it contains very strong sexual violence.",1216512000,3,995,4.691428571428571
