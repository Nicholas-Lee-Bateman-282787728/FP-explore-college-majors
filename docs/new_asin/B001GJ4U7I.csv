8305546,1,B001GJ4U7I,"i have a high tolerance of horrible movies. This movie made me want to vomit, not because of the 'gore' if you can call ketchup ""gore', mostly because of the horrible everything.
I think the above 1 star reviews, are all from friends and family involved in the movie, because there is no possible way.
I'll just go over some points.
1. the acting, i get it, it's a low budget movie, the acting is going to be bad...this acting... is just... 'hey...do...you...know...someone...who can ...read?' kind of hiring.
2. they attempt to use a bunch of plots from other horror movies, which didn't work, it's like poorly reenacted already z-movie movies stuff.
3. is it dubbed? nothing sync's up right, and i have two copies of this movie (it came on multiple horror packs), so it cannot be just a crummy copy.
4. Clearly my writing about this is lacking, because i swear it stole more than a few brain cells.

Not even mst3k, rifftrax or any other type of riffing could make this better.
Watch Manos unriffed and i swear it will be more enjoyable than this. I'm sorry to the folks who made it, i'm glad you got to make your movie, but really.... REALLY???? what. was this?",1400976000,,1164,4.542857142857143
8305547,3,B001GJ4U7I,"This film is about witchcraft and a supernatural clown doll. There's also a demon, who looks somewhat like an evil clown.

Yes, it is low-budget and it shows. Yet I enjoyed this film. The actors are no-name amateurs, but their performances range from tolerable to acceptable. I've seen worse.

The makeup and special effects are very good. The demon's eyes have a nice orange glow. There are some good shocks, albeit of the cheap kind -- a man enters a room and suddenly sees a GRISLY SIGHT with LOUD MUSIC to jolt us.

The most obvious budgetary compromise is the sound. Not that you can't hear it. The sound is very clear. But the dialog seems to been entirely dubbed in. Lips are often out of sync, and there's no ambient sound.

Every room or outdoor location has its own ambient sound. This is why professional filmmakers record ""room tone"" after they're finished using a location. That way, if they later need to dub some dialog, they will also mix in the location's ""ambient sound"" during the sound mix. Otherwise, the dialog sounds disembodied -- the actors always sound as if they're talking in the same soundproof studio rather than in a house, car, or city street, etc.

SECRETS OF THE CLOWN has that hollow, disembodied dialog sound. It gives the film a cheap feeling.

Why did these filmmakers dub? Some filmmakers, who shoot on expensive film stock, try to save money by not recording any sound on location. But SECRETS OF THE CLOWN seems to be shot on video -- and all video cameras have built-in mics. The higher-end cameras even have sound inputs for extended mics. So even if you can't afford a separate sound recorder (as used by professionals), you can still use the camera's built-in mic.

My guess is that the people behind SECRETS OF THE CLOWN shot on video, using only the camera's built-in mic. The sound turned out to be so poor, they discarded the soundtrack and dubbed almost everything in after the fact.

If you can overlook the poor sound and mediocre acting, this film still offers an entertaining  supernatural tale, with grisly effects and good shocks.",1366934400,3,2086,4.708791208791209
8305548,1,B001GJ4U7I,"They should have a new category for movies that are extremely low budget. They should call them ""spare change"" budget movies. Spare change budget movies are movies that look like they've been made for less than $5,000. Secrets of the Clown looks like it could have been made for around $1,000.

This is was filmed on a camcorder, so the poor sound quality of was evident. The crappy dialogue, acting, and fake blood (ketchup and red lipstick) were terrible. As a result, it is impossible to care about the characters. As a result, I ended up like other watchers of this movie: because I didn't care about the characters, I never cared what the secret of the clown was. I was too busy fast forwarding. This movie is extremely boring with a lot of aimless dialogue.

I bought this as a $5 movie pack at my local Mart. It contained this movie, some weird Texas torture movie with Michael Madsen and C. Thomas Howell, Room 33, and Curtains. $5 for 4 movies really does end up roping in horror movie buffs like me. Sometimes I wish I didn't love the horror genre so much; I've wasted so much of my life watching some of the crappiest horror movies around because I'm addicted to this genre. *sad face...I is ashamed of myself*",1347753600,,1221,4.520361990950226
8305549,1,B001GJ4U7I,"This movie failed to understand how to make a succesful B-horror movie. First mistake this movie had was that it tried to make a serious horror movie. When you don't have a budget to pay for great actors or effects, don't try to make a super serious film. There is going to be flaws and terrible acting in your film so accept it and add comedy into your horror movie to lighten up the mood. Making it super serious will only make you judge the film as a serious horror movie and your not going to draw the audience in. There were really no likable characters in this movie and the plot is really thin. The gore, which usually is in abundance in these type of films was lacking. It is also a confusing mess what is going on. Is there a ghost killer, serial killer, killer clown, going on, No it happens to be witch craft. Wait a minute now it's something else. Zombies now are the killer.  To confusing for a B-movie. Don't waste your time on this dud. Find yourself a better movie to entertain you tonight. You'll thank me for saving you time watching this sad attempt of a horror film.",1319500800,2,1086,4.297560975609756
8305550,3,B001GJ4U7I,"Ed Wood would love this film! It's one of those weird films that was filmed wrong, acted wrong, has a woman with a Medusa hairstyle, cheesy blood...and just plain dumb dialogue.

It does have a few good points...from a b-movie perspective. It teeters on the it's-so-bad-it's-good line. There are insider jokes throughout the film. ""You killed Ken"" ""Those bast*@%$"" It was at this point I realized the makers of this film had no real serious intentions on telling a good story or presenting it well. They wanted a rotten movie and laughed the whole time making it.",1314748800,,563,4.804123711340206
8305551,4,B001GJ4U7I,"This is an example of a well done indi film. Twists and turns a mile a minute, good acting, and a script screaming Army of Darkness style humor.  Best description of the film is a supernatural, horror, comedy, mystery, thriller, WOW!!!!  Very funny and highly original.. Recommend to all.",1244419200,2,288,4.857142857142857
8305552,1,B001GJ4U7I,I don't know if this even deserves one star.  I bought it because I saw it got 5 stars... What are people thinking!  Im a horror movie buff and sometimes like the lo-budget stuff because its funny.  This was so bad it wasn't funny.,1235692800,,231,4.204545454545454
8305553,1,B001GJ4U7I,These reviews are obviously bait by people associated with this movie.  Buyer Beware!  Something smells!!!!,1234915200,2,107,6.066666666666666
8305554,5,B001GJ4U7I,"How do I begin... although the writing is pretty awful, and even at the end of the movie you still don't understand what the ""secrets of the clown"" are, I have to say the movie, along with special features - mainly cast interviews - were entertaining in themselves.  I haven't laughed that hard in YEARS.  Now, this might be because I was intoxicated at the time, or better yet because it was 6AM, but nevertheless... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO ANYONE WHO IS READY TO PEE THEIR PANTS LAUGHING.",1231200000,4,498,4.522222222222222
8305555,5,B001GJ4U7I,"I would recommend this movie to anyone.  Although the acting gets a little shakey at times, the plot and overall direction of the film is very good.  For being a low budget film, this movie still finds a way to provide great violence and gore!  For anyone who wants to see a great B grade horror film, this movie is a MUST!!!",1224547200,4,325,4.209677419354839
