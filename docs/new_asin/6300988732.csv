7808835,4,6300988732,"The Savage Curtain is a worthy episode of Star Trek.  Don't let Abraham Lincoln's absurd way of revealing himself turn you off from this episode.  I wish Lincoln had been introduced in another way.  Because of this, I took off a star.  However, once Lincoln came aboard the Enterprise, the story unfolded itself in an excellent way.

This episode is so pivotal because it introduced so many important characters.  Kahless the Unforgettable and Surak both explained important parts of Klingon and Vulcan history respectively.  Most people do not realize that Season Three provided a lot of information on the History of Vulcan (sadly destroyed in Star Trek XI).  It was in Let That Be Your Last Battlefield that we learned Vulcan almost destroyed itself until logic was adopted.",1242259200,,777,5.015625
7808836,4,6300988732,"The premise is goofy. Abraham Lincoln appears and invites Kirk and Spock to beam down. There they are forced to fight against some of the great villains in history, including Ghengis Kahn. The rock-like aliens of the planet don't understand Earth concepts of good and evil, so they stage a fight to see which is strongest.

Kirk, Spock, and Lincoln are joined by Surak, the founder of Vulcan philosophy. Surak is a total pacificist. He is gracious toward the Earthmen, though a bit formal. Despite the impossibility of a pacificist solution, Surak insists on suing for peace, and Spock argues that he must be given a chance to do so.

Credit must be given to Roddenberry for tackling a perennially difficult issue for liberals: is it better to adopt the Ghandi-like tactics of Surak, or to defend what is right as Lincoln did, at the cost of many lives? Making things difficult is that the bad guys have no problem with taking human life. In this episode, the good guys must ultimately stand and fight. But the idealism of Surak is not shown to be completely invalid. Indeed, the final words of the episode are ""There is still plenty of their work [Surak's and Lincoln's] to do in the galaxy."" Surak was surely a brave man (er, Vulcan).

Note: This episode inspired a memorable episode of the BBC series ""Red Dwarf."" In that story, a planet contains a museum of animated wax figures of famous Earthlings. For some reason, the musuem is empty and the wax figures have run amok, providing another showdown between the good guys and bad guys of history -- with the good guys at an apparent disadvantage because some of them are pacifists like Ghandi.

Another note: One of the bad guys in this Trek episode is Kahless the Unforgettable, the founder of the Klingon empire. In TNG episode ""Rightful Heir,"" Kahless is a Klingon Christ figure. In that episode, members of a cult have preserved the DNA of Kahless and used it to clone him. The result is a Klingon Second Coming. The episode suggests that a Second Coming, if it happened, might be disappointing. ""You have the words of Kahless already,"" the clone finally says to Worf. ""Why be disappointed?"" Be faithful to the ideas rather than worshipping the man.",1187222400,,2207,4.709844559585492
7808837,4,6300988732,"This is a difficult episode to rate. It is very uneven, seems rushed, maybe everyone was having a bad week but any Trek fan will know the third season was hell for all involved.
But I think it is better than most think. It is actually a wonderful story, it is just limited by budget and admittedly heartless acting. This could have been a masterpiece if done better , but it still deserves a look.
I lo ve the spooky music <tho it is somewhat repeptitive, one of Star Trek's greatest faults I think> and Yarnek is pretty spooky looking if you are in a dark room and not taking things too seriously.
If you are a Trek fan, I believe this is worthy of collection. This episode seems to  air very rarely; I don't know why. Give it a chance.",1037923200,3,737,4.226950354609929
7808838,4,6300988732,"The U.S.S. Enterprise is scanned by a powerful energy source coming from the planet Excalbia. The starship had been sent to survey the planet, but it was thought to consist of nothing but a lavalike surface without  inhabitants.  The image of Abraham Lincoln appears in space and requests to  be beamed aboard, claiming to be the genuine Lincoln. Against McCoy's  objections, Kirk and Spock beam the entity aboard. They accept his offer to  visit Excalbia, where a rock-like creature named Yarnek appears. Yarnek  declares that the Enterprise officers are to participate in a battle  between good and evil. This is to teach the Excalbians about humanoid  concepts. Fighting for the ""good"" are, Kirk, Spock, Lincoln and  Surak, founder of the present Vulcan culture. On the ""bad"" side  are, Genghis Khan, Colonel Green, Zora, a vicious killer, and Kahless,  father of the Klingon Empire as it was now known.  When the Enterprise  officers refuse to fight, Yarnek freezes the starship's engines, starting a  breakdown of the matter/antimatter shielding. If Kirk doesn't win, the ship  will explode in four hours. There is much plotting and counter-plotting,  until only Kirk, Spock, Khan and Zora remain alive. After some  philosophical discussion regarding ""good"" and ""evil,""  Yarnek returns Kirk and Spock to the U.S.S. Enterprise and frees the ship.",943315200,3,1350,5.228971962616822
