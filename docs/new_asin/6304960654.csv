945230,4,6304960654,"The Night Stalker is, in my view, a strong outing.  It's a well written piece that addresses a horrific character in a modern age.  And the character of Kolchak is well-drawn, and nicely captured by Darren McGavin.  The Night Strangler is a weaker offering.  Essentially, it's The Night Stalker with a fresh coat of paint.  Not bad, but not particularly new, either.  I'll keep this in my collection, and I recommend it for anyone interested in the genre.",1024272000,2,455,4.769230769230769
945231,5,6304960654,"Obnoxious seasoned middle-aged newshound Carl Kolchak is his own worst enemy.  He always gets his story, all right, but he steps on so many powerful toes in the process that he rarely gets to report what he's sleuthed-out.  Hooking up with his old boss Tony Vincenzo in Las Vegas, Kolchak latches onto the biggest story of his life:  a series of serial murders of young showgirls is not just being committed by some psychopath  - it's being committed by ""a real live vampire.""  The police are reluctant to accept the evidence of their own eyes  -  the killer survives a fusillade of bullets from the city's finest  -  and it becomes incumbent on Kolchak to take matters into his own hands.
Such is the plot of The Night Stalker, the highest-rated T.V. movie of its time.  By today's standards, it is tamer than most horror movies or even straight police procedurals  -  which is essentially what The Night Stalker is  -  though it holds up well still, thirty years later.
The sequel, also the highest-rated movie of its time, finds Kolchak and Vincenzo relocated to Seattle, where another series of showgirl murders are occurring.  Blood was being drained from the Vegas victims, but this killer  -  whose description varies from ""corpse-like"" to ""quite handsome""  -  is arguably grislier:  he's taking the girls' spinal fluid, for reasons unknown.  Kolchak and an industrious bookworm at the newspaper's morgue trace a similar series of murders committed at regular intervals every twenty-eight years for over a century, and Kolchak ends up cornering (or being cornered by) a most unusual quarry, in a sunken city hideout beneath Seattle.
Both these films are very good.  Producer/director Dan Curtis shows admirable restraint crafting both pieces as superior crime melodrama  -  the latter with a fair amount of humor, to boot.  Veteran horror author/screenwriter Richard Matheson adapted the first movie from Jeff Rice's novel, and wrote the sequel as his own original script.  The films play very well together, and subsequently gave birth to a pretty good one-year T.V. series that largely inspired Chris Carter to create The X-Files, by Carter's own admission.  Robert Cobert's jazzy score works for some viewers and not for others, but even if it puts you off, the movies are sufficiently good on their other many merits to distract you from it.  The casts are excellent in both movies, especially Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland as Kolchak and Vincenzo.
Just as Jaws is much more than merely a story about a killer shark, The Night Stalker and The Night Strangler are more about government coverups than anything else, utilizing supernatural serial killers as the vehicle for the theme.  They're well worth watching, still, after all these years.  And if you can catch any of the T.V. series episodes, they're entertaining too, though generally much more comedic.",1021766400,3,2872,5.010570824524313
945232,4,6304960654,"Though a lesser film than its predecessor, THE NIGHT STRANGLER is still an above-average sequel to the classic 1972 TV thriller THE NIGHT STALKER.
Darren McGavin once more slips into the role of Carl Kolchak, the inquisitive and often brusque newspaper reporter who somehow manages to get crossed up not only with big city bigwigs but also with supernatural happenings.  Last time, it was in Vegas and it involved a vampire.  Now it's Seattle and the culprit this time is an aging monster (Richard Anderson) who goes on a strangling spree against women every twenty-one years to keep his youth.  He lives in Seattle's famed underground city, which is why he routinely escapes detection.  But McGavin's on the case alone, having to stop Anderson before he strikes again.  And when he's not after Anderson, he must also deal with Seattle's city fathers and his irascible editor Tony Vincenzo (Simon Oakland).
Featuring appearances by horror veterans John Carradine and Al Lewis, THE NIGHT STRANGLER is efficiently directed by ""Dark Shadows"" creator Dan Curtis, who served as the producer for the original NIGHT STALKER.  McGavin is at his usual best, hard-nosed, tough, and with a tendency to rub those in authority exactly the wrong way.  Richard Matheson once again has written a fine screenplay.
Even though it is a slightly inferior film, mainly because a sex strangler in a place like Seattle is not quite like a vampire in Vegas, THE NIGHT STRANGLER is effective and atmospheric horror/suspense entertainment, highly recommended.",1018396800,29,1533,5.132530120481928
945233,4,6304960654,"The Night Stalker is the story of a reporter who investigates a Las Vegas serial killer who turns out to be a vampire.  Doesn't sound like much, does it?  What is fascinating about this film, however, is the style in which it is done.  The story is told as excerpts from a diary.  Crimes are individually detailed and analyzed.  Government is portrayed alternately as either incompetant or sinister in its attempts to cover everything up. The ""Oh My God, THEY know more than they want US to know"" plotline has been done nearly to death over the past quarter century, but it started here first.  And for that, the film deserves a little respect.  Before there were X-files, before Erin Brokovitch, before Silkwood, and almost before All The Presidents Men, there was Kolchak: The Night Stalker. As for the Night Strangler, the inclusion of this wretched sequel is the only reason I give the DVD 4 stars instead of 5. A Mystery Science 3000 candidate if ever there was one.",1015977600,2,971,4.676470588235294
945234,4,6304960654,"Darren McGavin reprises his role as Carl Kolchak, an annoying investigative newspaper reporter who continously stumbles into bizzare stories.  This time Kolchak, exiled from his prior assignment in Las Vegas, finds himself in Seattle and on the trail of a mysterious 144 year old strangler.  Similar to the first movie, the police and city officials attempt to thawrt Kolchak's investigation and pressure the newspaper to withhold his articles from publication.
THE NIGHT STRANGLER includes quite a few familiar faces: Simon Oakland (Black Sheep Squadron), Jo Ann Pflug (M*A*S*H and cohost of Candid Camera), Margaret Hamilton (The wicked witch from The Wizard of Oz), Al Lewis (Grandpa from The Munsters)and John Carradine.  Also look for Richard Anderson who would later go on to television fame in the television series THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN.
The sets are more elaborate in this sequel and the plot is a little more complicated than the first movie.  This is traditionally what happens when a sequel attempts to trump the original.
THE NIGHT STRANGLER aired in early 1973 and a year later would be followed by the television series THE NIGHT STALKER.  Prior to the network's dash for cash in rushing out the television series, a third Kolchak television movie was in pre-production.  However, THE NIGHT KILLERS never materialized as the televison series consumed Darren McGavin and his character, Carl Kolchak.
If you saw the first NIGHT STALKER movie, then you would be remiss for not viewing this one.",1002672000,8,1511,5.172131147540983
945235,5,6304960654,"This is a real treat! Witty, well written, well acted and well directed flicks which combine the atmosphere of film noir with an intelligent and yet eventful and not too realistic supernaturalism: a good mix indeed! The DVD transfer is superb (there occures some graininess during darker scenes), even though there are no extras (not being familiar with these films I immediately longed to know more about them). Perhaps I'm a bit overenthusiastic just for the reason that these flicks (which I seem to have picked out for no reason) were a real surprise - and a real treat. Thanks, and give us more!",987811200,3,600,4.778846153846154
945236,5,6304960654,"At long last...the two chilling, thrilling, witty and expertly crafted pilot TV movies to the cult 70's TV series ""The Night Stalker"" are finally available on DVD.

""The Night Stalker"" pilot telemovie was based upon the short novel ""The Kolchak Papers"" written by ex-journalist Jeff Rice, and then adapted to the screen by well known thriller writer Richard Matheson, who has contributed some wonderful scripts to fantasy cinema including ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"", ""The Martian Chronicles"",  and Steven Spielberg's first hit movie, ""Duel"".

Darren McGavin truly brings alive the character of the crumpled, abrasive, intrusive, but above all lovable newspaperman, Carl Kolchak in these two thrilling explorations into the undead set in modern day Las Vegas & Seattle.

""The Night Stalker"" sees our courageous hero investigating a series of blood drained bodies amongst the glittering lights of Las Vegas. At first reluctant to believe that the murders could involve the supernatural, the cynical Kolchak is soon led to the conclusion that he is indeed tracking a modern day vampire. Kolchak must battle his long suffering boss, Anthony ""Tony"" Vincenzo (wonderfully portrayed by Simon Oakland), the local law enforcement headed by Sherriff Butcher & Chief Masterson (Claude Akins & Charles McGraw) and the manipulative district attorney to prove that an actual vampire is committing these grisly murders. Further depth is brought to the cast by zany character actor Elisha Cook Jnr as a compulsive gambler, and gorgeous Carol Lynley is the cocktail waitress romantically entwined with Kolchak. When ""The Night Stalker"" originally aired on January 11th, 1972 on ABC, it attracted nearly 54% of the TV audience between 8.30pm and 10pm, and for many years it held the title of the most highly rated telemovie ever aired on US TV ! Tightly scripted with horror, wit and humour...this film has not dated in over thirty years !

With the first outing being such a runaway success, another script was written pitching Carl Kolchak against the forces of evil. ""The Night Strangler"" sees our unfortunate Carl, after having been run out of Las Vegas, now calling Seattle home and landing another reporters role with his old boss, Tony Vincenzo. Before long, there is another series of brutal murders and Kolchak is on the trail of a mysterious Civil War surgeon with an elixir to cheat death ! Suave Richard Anderson ( best known as Oscar Goldman from ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" ) portrays the malevolent serial killer, Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch from the Wizard of Oz) has a delightful cameo as an intimidating professor of the occult, ex-screen vampire John Carradine (House Of Dracula, House of Frankenstein) is Kolchak's new boss, the tyrannical newspaper owner Llewellyn Crossbinder, sexy Jo Ann Pflug catches Kolchak's roving eye as belly dancer Louise Harper, and ex ""Munster"" Al Lewis nearly steals the show as a boozy tramp...plus Wally Cox portrays the resourceful newspaper archive clerk Titus Berry, assisting Kolchak with his gruesome investigations into Seattle's past !

PlUS, If you are a keen Kolchak fan...then grab the highly entertaining book ""Night Stalking : A 20th Anniversary Kolckak Companion by Mark Dawidziak. It's everything you ever wanted to know about the series, but were afraid to ask ! Additionally, keep your eye open for the chilling 1973 telemovie ""The Norliss Tapes"", another Dan Curtis directed pilot for a supernatural TV series, that unfortunately never took off. Roy Thinnes from ""The Invaders"" plays a writer investigating fake psychics, shonky fortune tellers etc. who comes across an artist who has returned from the dead with a thirst for human blood. It stars Roy Thinnes, Claude Akins, Angie Dickinson & Nick Dimitri.

After the two successful telemovies, Kolchak became a TV series (total of 20 episodes) featuring an interesting line up of guest stars including Jim Backus, Richard Keil, Tom Skerritt, Phil Silvers, Cathy Lee Crosby, Tom Bosley, Carolyn Jones & Keenan Wynn to name but a few !!

There is a real chemistry in both the Night Stalker / Night Strangler productions that is intelligent, witty and exhilarating entertainment...if you've never seen what inspired Chris Carter to create ""The X-Files""...now's your opportunity to see Carl Kolchak on his two best cases !!",974332800,86,4334,5.22589928057554

Watching these movies again decades later I can see some of its flaws, but the stories are still solid. The zeitgeist of the time was in full display: government's sole job was to keep people in the dark somehow resonates today, but with less conviction that doing the right thing is an obligation of the man who knows the truth.

As for this release the transfers are decent enough quality, with only a little color loss, no noticeable scratches and clear sound. My only complaint about this, and the reason for my 4/5 stars is that they put this out on one double sided disk.

Yes, it does seem a bit dated, but the writing and the acting are solid. These t.v. movies don't rely on cheap gore or profanity. They're a fun romp.

long ago but I had to get the DVD as I did the entire series which I'm glad to hear they are releasing a new better set that isn't doubled sided!
The original movie is so well written and directed and acted it may be the best horror movie without all the gore ever made. It has humor like
many classic horror movies had but it's hysterical without taking away the mystery and horror of the film. Mc Gavin is perfect as Kolchak and
many TV and movie stars are in the cast and make both movies excellent that you won't find on TV or movies from Hollyweird today! The 2nd
Night STrangler is also as good as first with Richard Anderson playing the mad doctor. Wally Cox is great as a reporter helping Kolchak. The
question why these two movies aren't released with the original series is a mystery! what NS fan wouldn't want all the movies and episodes

Reporter Carl Kolchak is now in Seattle, Washington, trying to solve the mystery of several strangulations that recur every few years where the victims are drained of blood in this second. of two TV movies portraying Carl Kolchak.

The success of the production led to a short run series as he is portrayed as a gifted investigative reporter with an attraction for unusual and paranormal occurrences, the viewer see him procuring evidence driving around Chicago in his yellow Ford Mustang convertible. Kolchak has persistently cracked several cases relying on gut instinct and often through sheer dumb luck. But more often than not, Kolchak's prospects are hindered by the complete obliteration of any or all proof to verify his claims. On other occasions his investigations have led to demotion or transfer of variable authority figures, the reasons for which are never truthfully disclosed, and hence the feeding the viewer's believe of a cover up.
As a youth I caught this film late night on the TV and found the whole movie rather spooky and scary at times. Kolchak was played by Darren McGavin, and he really brought a unique feel to the film - although I might add the Vampire was pretty spooky. The film may seem dated by today's standards but for me this was and is a cult classic.

945877,5,6304960654,"What a fantastic double feature!! There are indelible TV horror images for those of us that grew up in the 1970's; the Zuni fetish doll terrorizing Karen Black in ""Trilogy of Terror"", Danny Glick scratching at the bedroom window in ""Salem's Lot"", and the Bigfoot installment of ""In Search Of..."". Among those iconic images I would add Darren McGavin's intrepid reporter Carl Kolchak running around in a baby blue suit with tape recorder in hand tracking down a wide variety of monsters. Before the TV series (which was canceled way too soon), there were two TV movies, both of which are on this disk.

""The Night Stalker"" - Kolchak is on the case after a series of murders takes place at night in Vegas. All of the victims are young women, each is murdered at night, and each has been drained of blood. Kolchak is soon convinced the killer is a vampire and despite threats by the police and his editor, Kolchak continues to hunt for the killer. A great who's who of 70's TV stars back up McGavin, and with a fantastic score and creative direction, this film contains more suspense, scares and atmosphere than almost any theatrical horror movie made today.

""The Night Strangler"" - After losing his job in Vegas, Kolchak finds himself in Seattle just as another brutal series of murders is taking place. Once again young women are turning up dead, this time with their necks and throats crushed. As Kolchak investigates the crimes, he soon discovers that these murders are just the latest in a series of similar crimes which seem to occur in the same area every 21 years. While it does hit most of the same beats as the previous film, ""Night Stranger"" is still a solid and fun movie that will be sure to raise the goosebumps.

I love the atmosphere in both films, and the director's use of silence, odd camera angles and creepy lighting really help set the tone and mood for each film. McGavin's Kolchak character is so much fun, and you really grow to like the dynamic between he and Vincenzo, his editor. Highly recommended, and not just for the nostalgia factor. Both of these films still pack the same fun and creeps today as they did when they first aired.",1428019200,2,2160,4.619791666666667

From the initial book and then to these 2 movies and then to the TV series. The series was placed on a Friday Night when no one watches much TV and there was no VCR's back then or recording devices so it was cancelled. But like ""Family Guy"" there was an uproar and the reruns were brought back about 10 years later for CBS Late Night! Unheard of for a show of only 1 season and 20 episodes! It then inspired X Files, a bad reboot of the series in the 2000's and now lives on in print. You can find comics, graphic novels, and new stories in books like the ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker Compendium, 43 original stories in a hard bound book at a price under $10 and at over 650 pages that's a lot of reading!

946138,5,6304960654,"Physical attributes: MGM exterior packaging had good graphics; adequate teasers and information as to the aspects of each movie. The interior of the case is strictly generic. No clips or spindles to break. The disc is 2-sided, which I wasn't sure I would like. Both movies are full screen formats. Nightstalker runs 74 mins. The sequel runs 90 mins.  Both movies have interactive menus with options for scene selection, subtitle choice(English, French, Spanish, none), and each movie has an interview with Dan Curtis (one on how he started his career and got to The Night Stalker; the other is on directing of The Night Strangler).
As to the quality of this disc: So far, I have absolutely no complaints. PLEASE NOTE: This rest of this review is for The Night Stalker ONLY, as I have not had a chance to see The Night Strangler in its entirety.

I saw both films when they originally aired and have seen them repeatedly over the years; the star of these 2 productions  IS The Night Stalker.

I was very  pleased at the transfer quality of The Night Stalker.  Crisp, clear audio; excellent video transfer (clean, clear, rich in color).  There are dark scenes in this picture, but they are meant to be that way. It is evident that these films were cost-effective, made-for-tv offerings(check out the sets, locations, costumes, rolling credits, etc). If you happen to be a fan of the Dark Shadows soap, you know thee are both Dan Curtis productions; you can see production similarities between them.  Casting was pretty much on the money with the exception of Carol Lynley, who was a weak choice for the part she played.  Darren McGavin's Kolchak was perfect; no one else could have portrayed him better. Simon Oakland fit comfortably into his part as Kolchak's boss and ""antagonist"" and Claude Akins knew just how to get the most out of his Sheriff Butcher character.

The Night Strangler script/story was not quite the quality of The Night Stalker, but if it is half a good as I recall and the second interview with Dan Curtis is as meaty as the first one, you will not make a mistake with this purchase. More reality and believability here than on those ""reality"" shows. Suspenseful entertainment at a reasonable price. If you feel comfortable with this partial review, buy this duo now; I don't think you will be sorry. If you are hesitant, please wait for my Night Strangler review. Thank you.",1407024000,3,2395,4.763285024154589
946139,5,6304960654,"""The Night Stalker"" is one of the best made for TV movies ever created, a near perfect combination of writing, acting, and directing, not to mention all the other things that go together to make a film better.  An abrasive, veteran, but above all dedicated reporter, on his way down after having been fired too many times, happens upon the story of a lifetime: a serial killer whom the facts uncovered gradually prove to be, despite said reporter's initial skepticism, a real live vampire.  The trouble is that nobody else is willing to believe it, not his longsuffering editor, not the police, and certainly not the local powers that be who are more concerned with not scaring away the tourists than they are with keeping them alive.  Unable to convince them to acknowledge what they are seeing with their own eyes and unwilling to accept the increasingly blunt hints to back off, said reporter keeps digging and eventually must face and destroy the monster himself because no one else can or will.  His reward?  Nothing more than a private grim satisfaction because his story is spiked and he is run out of town.  Brilliant casting greatly helps.  No one but Darren McGavin could possibly play Carl Kolchak (as later events would prove) and no one but Simon Oakland could possibly play his irascible editor Tony Vincenzo.  It was diamond cut diamond with those two.  Having Kolchak narrate was another brilliant idea that both increased the verisimilitude and reduced the number of things that had to be expensively filmed.  It truly was an exquisite piece of filmmaking and storytelling, but it had one basic problem: it was originally intended as a one-off.  Creating first a sequel and then a TV series (A planned trilogy ending third movie, set in NYC and having Kolchak face off with the not-quite-as-dead-as-was-hoped vampire from the first movie, was never made.) caused the same problems of cascading implausibility that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bob-Newhart/dp/B002UPQ23W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bob Newhart</a>&nbsp;so hilariously pointed out were caused by turning Herbert A.

In this case how long could one go on having Kolchak uncover and defeat Yet Another paranormal menace while each time having his story suppressed and the events successfully covered up before it became ridiculous?  Well,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Led-3-Lives/dp/1593930925/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Led 3 Lives</a>&nbsp;lasted 117 episodes, Scooby Doo has been doing the same thing for decades, but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kolchak-The-Night-Stalker/dp/B000ATQYWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kolchak - The Night Stalker</a>&nbsp;lasted only 20 episodes and the remake&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-Stalker-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000EOTV98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night Stalker - The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;only 10, only 6 of which were ever televised.

""The Night Strangler"" repeats the same formula but ups the ante a bit.  This time Kolchak uncovers a serial killer who has killed six women over 18 days every 21 years since 1868!  Though not quite as good (or quite as believable: a multiple story secret Seattle Underground?) as the original, if you could get past the increasingly implausible premise, you could enjoy this movie and the resulting TV show  for as long as it lasted.

  Does anyone out there in Amazonland know what the status is of the original prints for these movies?--Obviously THE NIGHT STALKER franchise is alive and well, but what about the other titles I listed? Do any of you have good contact info for the archives departments at MGM and Universal where we might be able to find out if there is any hope of seeing these flicks on DVD/Blu-ray? I've tried, but so far I can't seem to find the right folks to talk to about this.

  I know there are some bootlegs out there, but in the case of THE CHALLENGE, the versions I've seen have an annoying red tint to what amounts to a VHS quality copy, and I'm hoping to find a decent quality DVD of this movie and the others I mentioned above.

  Appreciate any help, references anyone can provide to crack the code on this one...Thanks...",1401408000,2,1098,4.477386934673367

With the influences of tasteless generation millinium shaping new releases, a generation that thinks anything older than two weeks should be discarded, and with anything that they do keep stored in their make-believe ""clouds,"" classic physical disc libraries will soon be a thing of the past.

946265,4,6304960654,"These two films were the precursor, the template of the vampire leaving the classic cape and hilltop castle to descend into Las Vagas dressed and looking like a pale CIA super agent. The Night Stalker was a frighteningly look at a vampire thrust into the seventies. Not a Dracula or his bitten decendent, but a man whose origin was generally unexplained but he kept showing up through different periods of history when ever there was war, sickness, or pestilence. Yanoes Scorzini. Was he a dabbler in witchcraft? Bad blood transfusion? How did he acquire his vampirism? All I know was when this movie was previewed on TV, it was the talk of the classroom right down to the Robert Cobert ( Dark Shadows) music. A vampire who could outrun cars,choke out dobermans, jujitsu the police, and take shots at point blank range was an odd form of super hero. He didn't have to become a bat. You saw the eyes. The black suit just like Barnabas Collins. You never saw his face clearly until midway into the movie.
It was all the elements of a modern archetype vampire relating to an audience by directors who were students, admirers, or proponents of Hitchcockian technique or film lore. These two movies became the archetypes for seventies contemporary horror.",1375660800,,1250,4.791666666666667

What most impresses me is the consistency of tone between the two films. Kolchak is not ""revised"" for the sequal, and he is not made more likeable: he is exactly who and what he is, and McGavin holds true to a his character's flawed essence. From the point of view of Authority Kolchak is, as Vincenzo says, ""irresponsible"": he thinks that the people should know not what is good for them, but what is true. His itch to bipass Authority and tell it all to ""his readers"" instigates his inevitable failure. He can't conform--he can only report.

I saw these movies decades ago and wondered how they would hold up after all this time. Well, they hold up rather well. Sure the f/x aren't cgi and they're quite low-key by todays standards, but here they work in the stories' favour. By keeping it low-key you can almost believe in the monsters presented as being possible and perhaps even real.

The strength of these movies---as would continue in the series--is the wonderful balance of humour and horror, the amusing balanced with the macabre. And the crowning touch is a worn out and down-on-his-luck newspaper reporter who seems the most unlikely individual to be a hero., fantastically played by the great Darren McGavin. McGavin brings Carl Kolchak to life and makes it all work. He's the real glue in the movies that brings it all together. Kolchak is like an everyman except that he has a streak of idealism in him: the insatiable need to know the truth and to reveal it even if he himself isn't too keen on going there. He is the ordinary man who does what needs to be done in extraordinary circumstances.

Seems both sets had this wierd problem with ""The Night Strangler"", a flickering of the film probably of sudden subtle spikes of snowy bright wavy lines taken from a bad negative or a bad tape, it aint really noticeable as much if not in a dvd upconverting blue ray player.  Things I did notice as a review of the discs and packaging, that the anchor bay version, being a 1998 dvd box, and therefore old, doesn't have any copy protection notices, and is supposedly region 0(all regions), is a double sided disc with a paper insert inside denoting scenes of both movies.  The mgm box set, 2004 mgm, does have the usual copy protection notices, region 1 notice(USA/Canada only), is a two dvd set, mine didn't have any insert in it but I suspect it originally did. The older two sided dvd is a heavier disc than newer double sided discs, the mgm two disc set discs seemed cheaper and more flimsy than usual but didn't affect play at all.  The old version didn't have any extras and the new one did have one(which bored me and I didn't review it fully, since extras like commentary bore me).",1307577600,2,1624,4.403333333333333
946382,5,6304960654,"These films are cult classics and truly stand the test of time. I loved them and the tv series as a boy, bought them on VHS, caught the series sporadically on the sci-fi network, and am thrilled to have the movies on DVD now. They are terrifically written and acted, and Carl Kolchak's over the top style and fantastic sense of humor set these movies apart from anything else in the horror genre. After reading reviews and other internet info, I am amazed how many more fans there are just like me, just kids when these aired but still devoted to Kolchak. The movies have left quite a legacy.

The Night Stalker establishes the pattern from which everything else derives. There is a series of murders that can only be explained via the supernatural. There is constant yelling and bickering, especially between Kolchak, the police, and Tony Vincenzo. Finally, Kolchak must confront the villain and the truth in inevitably covered up. Darren McGavin is inspired; Kolchak possesses relentless drive and is an unpretentious fashion nightmare. I enjoy ""Strangler"" as much, yet it doesn't pack the suspense the first movie had. Its more of a mystery than horror, with the biggest attribute being the exceptional cast: John Carradine, Al Lewis, Margaret Hamilton, Wally Cox, the gorgeous Jo Ann Pflug, and Richard Anderson as the timeless killer.

Even with advances in technology, these tv movies stand up to anything. They form the backbone of an exceptional line of television, rising from the ashes of Dark Shadows and climaxing with The X-files.

A year earlier, another pilot, ""The Night Stalker,""  was shown but this one actually kicked off the series, called ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker,"" which ran only two years. It seemed to be popular so I don't know why it didn't last longer.

At 90 minutes, ""Strangler"" was longer than the first pilot but very similar in plot. The only major change was in the locale. Here, our intrepid reporter-hero ""Carl Kolchak"" (Darren McGavin) is hunting down a serial-killer werewolf in Seattle instead of Las Vegas.

Kolchak has the same common opponents, meaning his newspaper boss ""Tony Vincenzo (Simon Oakland) and a hostile police chief (played by Scott Brady). Along the way you get to see a bevy of beauties including Jo Ann Pflug and Nina Wayne. You also have brief appearances by famous actors John Carradine, Margaret Hamilton, Al Lewis and Wally Cox.

The story will keep your interest and has good suspense at the end. The only annoying part - at least for me - is the overdone yelling between McGavin and Oakland, and McGavin and Brady.

946482,5,6304960654,"When the first Kolchak movie premired on ABC Tuesday night movies in 1973 over 70 million people tuned in.  No show today can come anywhere near those numbers.  An interesting story, though the first film comes damned close to plagerising Leslie H. Whitten's 1965 novel PROGENY OF THE ADDER. (The lead in the book is a police detective.  The scene with the used car dealer is exactly the same.  Whitten's novel was set in D.C. not Vegas.) Still a wonderfully rousing tv movie with Darren McGavin as the down on his luck Carl Kolchak working on a murder story for his long suffering editor Tony Vincenzo (Simon Oakland), he discovers a link to other killings which amazingly seem like the work of a vampire.  The beautiful Carol Lynly is his girl friend and Ralph Meeker plays his FBI buddy.  Others in the cast include Claude Akins -- who would play a similar role a year or so later in Dan Curtis' other horror vehicle, THE NORLISS TAPES -- and Kent Smith.  Look for a young Larry Linville (MASH) as the coroner.  In THE NIGHT STRANGLER Kolchak turns up in Seattle.  Vincenzo is having a glass of milk at the local reporter watering hole when he hears a familar voice.  To the bartender he says, ""Look around the corner and tell me if you see someone who looks like he just came from a roadshow version of the FRONT PAGE.""  Kolchak convinces him --against his better judgment -- to hire him on and once again Carl is on the trail of a killer who drains blood from his female victims and appears every 21 years!  Beautiful, eerie scenes in the underground city.  Also stars Wally Cox, John Carradine, Scott Brady and as the deadly Richard Malcolm, Richard Anderson (best remembered for his role as Steve Austin's chief Oscar Goldman on THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN.)

946487,5,6304960654,"In 1972's ""The Night Stalker,"" Carl Kolchak is a Las Vegas newspaper reporter working on a story about the mysterious murders of showgirls, the victims being found with bite marks on their necks and drained of their blood. Only downtrodden Kolchak is a good enough investigator, and a sensible enough one, to discover and believe the truth about the elusive killer. Unfortunately, the authorities refuse to accept the possibility of the existence of vampires. Carl is naturally forced to find a way to expose the truth and/or dispatch the creature himself.

That is basically the Kolchak formula, actually, if you add to it his stories being buried due to lack of evidence or some sort of cover-up. However, thanks to the captivating acting of A Christmas Story's Darren McGavin as stubborn and relentless Carl Kolchak, it never seems to get old. At least, not to us diehard fans (I was born in '75, but grew up watching reruns of the TV series on late night television). Produced by ""Dark Shadows"" creator Dan Curtis (who directed the second Kolchak film), ""The Night Stalker"" was a huge hit of a TV movie and resulted in the creation of ""The Night Strangler"" the following year. Strangler took a more unique turn, as Kolchak, forced to leave Las Vegas and finding himself in Seattle, ends up in pursuit of an all together different type of monster: an extraordinarily old alchemist who has found the secret to eternal youth and enhanced vitality. Unfortunately, it is a secret that requires a series of murders every 20 years.

As in the series, Kolchak's boss in both films is Mr. Tony Vincenzo, a bloated, nervous wreck of a man who blames most of his suffering on incessant bickering with Kolchak himself. Often taking punishments along with Carl, Vincenzo (Simon Oakland) finds himself run out of Vegas and Seattle as well, both characters ending up together again for the short-lived TV series set in Chicago, Illinois. Popular as it was, the TV series was given a poor time slot, and I don't doubt the formula wore thin for some viewers after a while, either. However, for those of us who loved it, not only is the series on DVD as well, but Moonstone publishing has been doing a Kolchak comic book series over the last few years that keeps pretty loyal to the old show. Not so loyal was the awful remake series from 2005 that had more in common with X-Files (minus the charisma and chemistry), a show that oddly enough was inspired by the original Night Stalker TV series. Personally, I have always wanted to make some bigscreen Kolchak movies myself one day, and since the revival series bombed, perhaps that window is still open. Anyway, for something current that has a bit of a Kolchak feel, I recommend the CW series ""Supernatural"".

As for this DVD, it is a single disc with one film and one extra on each side. The extras are short interview sessions with Dan Curtis, the second one being very light. Still, it's amazing we were given any extras at all, though more would definitely have been welcome. The films look and sound great, are appropriately fullscreen, and are definitely a treat for the Kolchak fanatic. They're loaded with stars and great performances. Barry Atwater plays the ghastly vampire in ""The Night Stalker"", along with Claude Akins as a sheriff (but not Lobo) who makes trouble for Carl, and Carol Lynley as Carl's girlfriend. Yes, in these films, Carl shows a mild interest in more than just his stories! In ""The Night Strangler"", the murderer in question is played by Richard Anderson of ""Bionic Woman"" and ""Six Million Dollar Man"" fame and the views of the underground city where he makes his lair are hauntingly fascinating!",1201824000,3,3666,4.779179810725552

'Night Stalker' and 'Night Strangler' will more than sate your desire for some ghouls served up by the irrepressible Darren McGavin as Kolchak, and directed by Dan Curtis, who had recently completed a six-year run of the gothic soap opera, Dark Shadows. The shadows style is much in evidence in these superb made-for-tv movies from early 1972 and 1973, respectively.

In 'Night Stalker', McGavin's Kolchak is on the trail of a vampire in sunny Las Vegas. A string of mini-skirted ladies- of- the- night supply the villain with plenty of O-positive, while Kolchak, aided by the local hospital, track down the culprit. It is up to Kolchak to convince skeptical law enforcement authorities that this isn't the work of an ordinary slasher. The whole proceedings are carried on with considerable charm, and a few silver crosses.

In 'Night Strangler' we have a darker, more richly upholstered tone. The setting is Seattle, and Kolchak goes on the trail of a subterranean villain who appears every few decades, for reasons I don't want to spoil. As art, it is the more engaging of the two pilot eps in my opinion, but the earlier 'Night Stalker' does more to establish Kolchak as a lovable eccentric character, which was played up in the subsequent TV series.

My interest in Kolchak was maintained by the DVD release of the full (and uneven) 1974-1975 television season, but these two pilot episodes are the shows to see first, since they maintain a greater level of consistent quality.

The made for tv movies Night Stalker, and the sequel The Night Strangler were ratings blockbusters in their day and were shown over and over on the network and late night Creature Feature's television.  The disc contains both episodes and the transfer is very good in my opinion for a 70 telepic.  You do get a little fuzz, and some bleed through in some sequences but for the most part it is just great in both audio and video.  In Night Stalker, follow Carl through the 70s era Las Vegas as he chases down Yanos Skorzeny a man with a thrist for blood and the nightlife.  Carol Lynley as Carl's girlfriend gayle lends a more humanistic side to Carl that we really didn't get to see in the sequel and subsequent follow up series.

946607,5,6304960654,"The Night Stalker DVD contains both the 1972 original movie as well as the slightly less classic 1973 sequel.  Both movies are a fun ""time capsule"" into that generation as well as showcasing a truly original spin on horror tales.

If you don't know about the character of Karl Kolchak (for shame) and prepare to enjoy a 100% fun time.  Kolchak is a rumpled reporter cum-nuisance who always stumbles upon stories that are ""out there"" and yet true!  The Night Stalker deals with a vampire stalking women in Las Vegas (and at the time was the highest rated TV movie in history with 54 million viewers).  The Night Strangler follows a similar format with a 100+ year old alchemist killing women for their blood to mix with his anti-aging elixir.

The fun part about any of the Kolchak movies is that there's a clever mix of humor and scares (some still good to this day).  Plus the way the stories unfold is original as the reporter narrates the events as they happened and leaves it to you to decide for yourself.  There's always a nice ""twist"" ending that prevents these stories from seeing the light of day.

Should the DVD movies win you over, there is also the 1974 TV series which is more ""camp classic"" and ""cheese"" than anything else.  But the Kolchak character and his encounters with supernatural forces always equals a good time.",1170633600,5,1336,4.622881355932203

946611,5,6304960654,"How does one classify The Night Stalker, the 1972 ABC Movie-of-the Week?  It's funny.  It's suspensful.  It's quirky.  It's scary.  It's witty.  It's serious.  It's high drama.  It's gothic.  The answer is the film defies classification.  You cannot put this particular movie in a box with a neat little bow around it because it won't fit.  And yet it was the highest rated made-for-TV film ever made up to that time.  The producer Dan Curtis regretted that the studio had not made it as a box office feature.

Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin) is an investigative reporter whom nobody believes when it comes to uncovering various assortments of ghouls. His wardrobe is delightful:  Snap-brim straw hat, seersucker suit, white tennis shoes and broad yellow polyester tie. Confrontations abound between him and his boss Tony Vincenzo. You half expect a newsroom brawl at any moment with chairs, tables, lamps, and typewriters flying everywere.

The acting in both episodes is superior, and the dialogue is witty and well written.  Also, don't expect to see a truck-load of beefcake pretty boy actors in this one; they're just not there.  If you're expecting eye candy, forget about it. If you're expecting preening, camera-smooching poseurs, forget about it. Instead you get mature, seasoned character actors filling out their roles to near perfection:  Simon Oakland, Ralph Meeker, Larry Linville, Kent Smith, Wally Cox, Claude Akins, Barry Atwater, and Charles McGraw.

The atmosphere is forboding, sinister, and dark when the vampire is on the prowl. When the police try to subdue the creature, they are the ones who end up in the bed of a hospital or the slab of a morgue.  Only Kolchak knows the answer on how to stop him.  But, alas, no one believes him.  So he goes it alone.

The video and sound transfer on this DVD is exquisite. The closeups are especially good, as you can see every little wrinkle, mole, and blemish on each face.

I recommend this double feature highly.  I bought the MGM DVD.  Anchor Bay has a version out there, but I cannot attest to its quality. You'll probably be better off purchasing the MGM offering. Happy viewing!",1168128000,5,2147,4.910863509749303

The Night Stalker though, had everyone sit up and take notice.

I seem to recall that there was something national happening at the time and this was a late replacement.

Anyhow, it seemed that everyone had seen this film.

It scared the bejabers out of the whole UK. The story, of a killer who may or may not be a genuine vampire, and the dogged down-at-hell reporter who won't give up on the story, gripped the nation.

Let me just say that everything works; the superb performance from Darren Mcgavin, the story and screenplay from, I believe, Robert Bloch, the direction, everything.

This is quite simply one of the best genre movies of all time. It rates up there with the Spielberg-directed 'Tales of Terror' and even the early Twilight Zone and Outer Limits.

The sequel was nearly as good, and the following shortlived series was a landmark in the genre.

Let's dismiss the recent 'remake' as an aberation. The Night Stalker and the Night Strangler are the genuine article.

An unpopular guy, Kolchak got the boot in Vegas at the end of ""Stalker"", and turns up in Seattle during the reign of a serial killer who strangles young and attractive dancing girls.  In dire need of a job, Kolchak looks up his old boss Tony Vincenzo (TV vet Simon Oakland who seems to have made half a career playing the incensed boss; he was also Robert Conrad's boss in ""Baa, Baa, Blacksheep"".) and wangles a reporter's slot on one of Seattle's oldest newspapers.  Vincenzo soon comes to regret the decision when Kolchak makes the ""Night Strangler"" case his own - soon running stories about a living-dead killer who rises from the depths of ""Old Seattle"" (the one that present-day Seattle is buried on top of) for a few weeks once every 21 years.  Dipping into the paper's archives, Kolchack finds reports of murders with details virtually identical to those of his time - but going back to the 19th century.  Though nobody seems to ever believe him, Kolchak digs deeper - learning about the subterranean Old Seattle, matching up with a comely (if motor-mouthed) Bellydancer named Louise Harper, running afoul of the Seattle police (who ofcourse do everything they can to keep him out of their hair, yet never consider him a suspect) and piecing together the identity of a man who seems to need gobs of human blood every 21 years.

""Strangler"" is a great movie, but it's perhaps a bit too long, and it's first half is definitely stronger than the second.  More than anything, ""Strangler"" is a great character story - though the characters soon overshadow the mystery that brought them together.  Besides Vincenzo and Harper, the story also boasts some fun cameos by characters who Kolchak should suspect of being the killer - John Carradine the newspaper's owner (who sounds like he's been walking the streets for a century); Wally Cox as the paper's archivist (who has an unnatural attachment to his dated articles); Al Lewis as a vagrant and, in the story's best ""guest appearance"", the wickedly great Margaret Hamilton as university professor who schools Kolchak into the chemistry behind immortality.

If the story gets slow, it's because there's an inordinately wide gap in the skepticism of the characters.  Everybody but Kolchak dismisses his story even as the facts make it obvious that something horrible is going on; Kolchak, on the other hand, buys into the first story he can find, and stick with it.  (Though ""Stalker"" was widely credited with inspiring the ""X Files"", it lacks the balancing disbelief that even Fox Mulder was allowed.)

946662,5,6304960654,"The Night Stalker is about some strange murders that happened in Las Vegas back in the 1970s.  The facts of the case were suppressed and manipulated in the media.

This is the account from a newspaper reporter who knew what really happened.  He tried to tell people but was silenced.  But somehow his notes and tape recordings were found and a movie was made about it.

The Night Strangler is worth watching if only for the argument between Kolchak and his boss at the end and to then find out what happens next.

These movies are interesting in the sense that they are accounts of non human creatures interacting with the rest of society in harmful ways.

I've seen several episodes of ""America's Most Wanted"" where I think the criminals they showed are not human.  So in this sense yes it is possible.

Comic book fans may be interested to know that Joan Pflug who appears in The Night Strangler was the voice of Sue Richards (the invisible girl) in the Hanna Barbera animated series ""The Fantastic Four"".

I watched the interview with producer Dan Curtis who was the inventor of the strange Gothic soap opera ""Dark Shadows"".

I attended the Dark Shadows festival at the World Trade Center in August 2001.

946663,4,6304960654,"Kolchak embodies our infracaninophily--our love for the Underdog.  He is a washed-up reported, who hasn't gotten a new suit since getting fired from the New York Journal in 1955, has been fired nine more times after that, and now is abused by loud-mouth editor.  Additionally, he embodies the paradox of the outside that actually has the inside track.  And what an inside track he has .

I found both films enjoyable, and thought that ""The Night Strangler"" is an underground classic.  In fact, I would probably recommend it, along with ""Horror in the Heights,"" as the ones to show at your next Halloween party.

As far as the DVD goes, a moderate amount of extras, and the copy and sound are flawless. I imagine the DVD is a far better quality then what you could a have seen in 1972 on you old black and white TV.

THE NIGHT STALKER

When ""The Night Stalker"" came out, we were winding-up the war in Viet-Nam and were in the mist of the ""Demon Child"" cycle of films:  ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""The Exorcist,"" and ""The Omen.""  Now in the 21st Century, this film seems more like a cross between a nostalgia piece and post-teen Halloween thriller.  It is vintage `70's, and will bring back memories of ""Starsky and Hutch,"" ""Quincy,"" ""The Rockford Files,"" and even ""Star Trek.""

The main problems with ""The Night Stalker"" is that it rough:.  The characters seem to be stock cardboard figures--such as Vincenzo being Italian for ""J. Jonah Jamison,"" and Kolchak taking this whole vampire thing seriously.  Since this is really the pilot for the series, and Kolchak himself is not quite convinced of what is going on, this deficiency is understandable and forgivable.

The film is not thoroughly corrupt.  In fact, the scene where half of the LVPD gets in a gunfight with the vampire keeps flashing in front of my mind's eye.  Kolchak and the police, all very edible heroes, fill the vampire full of lead, but to no avail.

Furthermore, I am still enchanted by the surprise (but sad) ending.  Of course, this ending, and the series itself, set the paradigm for every episode of the X-Files.  Then again, McGaven was Arthur Dales, the father of the X-Files.  This relationship cannot be overemphasized.  If you show this film to you X-Phile friend, and he is let down because he has seen it before, it is understandable--The X-Files lifted so much form the series. The ""monster of the week,"" the government cover-up (LVPD versus the FBI), tragic ending (Mulder never quite ""proves"" the mystery).  So if the ""gimmick"" seems stale, keep in mind that Kolchak pioneered it.

As a Movie of the Week, you have a surprising cast of familiar character actors:

* Claude ""Sheriff Lobo"" Akins  (Sheriff)

* Larry ""Frank Burns Eats Worms"" Linville (The doctor in the press conference)

* Elisha ""Starfleet JAG Samuel T. Cogley  "" Cook (the old guy in the back of the car).

THE NIGHT STRANGLER

In the Night Strangler, McGaven finally hits the mark as the washed-up reporter.  He gets a better hairstyle.  He has the right voice inflections--a combination of musicality and sneering.  Most importantly, Kolchak get his sarcastic edge. This is partly due to Kolchak becoming convinced of the supernatural, and partly due to his frustration with being ridiculed and officially silenced.  The voice-overs are a combination of ""Dragnet,"" ""Tracer Bullet,"" and George Carlin.  Vicariously we revel in Kolchak's banter,  his ""quips and  lip"" to the cops and Vincenzo.  This is a more assertive Kolchak, a more confident Kolchak, and a more confident Kolchak.  And we love it!

Vincenzo also undergoes development. On a certain level he believes Kolchak, and is willing to stick his neck out for for his reporter-friend.

This second film was better plotted, and the decision to use the Bradbury building for the underground city was a brilliant choice for the underground city.  I would have cut-down the long scene when Kolchak is in the city to meet Dr. Malcolm.  They were too drawn-out, reminding of the agonizing horror of the boring V'ger scenes from ST:TMP.

The surprise actors in this movie are better than the first:

Richard ""Oscar Goldman"" Anderson (the mad scientist)

Wally ""Underdog"" Cox (The lonely researcher)

Margaret ""Wicked Witch of the West"" Hamilton (Professor Crabwell--you'll recognize her schnoz)

Al ""Grandpa Monster"" Lewis (the bum in the underground city)",1147910400,3,4352,4.912087912087912

Camp on a budget is tricky to pull off, but having Darren McGavin makes all the difference. He's just an interesting character actor. Sure, there are some William Shatner moments, but as with Shatner, they add to the fascination of McGavin's performance.

Of the two films here, I have to be honest and say I prefer ""The Night Strangler."" It seems a little more gelled, and McGavin has his character a little better developed.

946785,5,6304960654,"I experienced a pleasant jolt of deja vu (aka nostalgia) when I watched ""The Night Stalker"" and ""The Night Strangler"" back to back. While you can tell these films were made in the early 1970s (what style!), neither has aged in terms of humor or sheer thrills. I'll never forget seeing ""Stalker"" as a young child (probably too young!); the poolside battle with the vampire, followed by Kolchak's confronation with the beast in that dark and scary house, remained burned in my memory for 30 years.

I had forgotten much of the ""Strangler,"" but it was another treat (the movie is almost as ageless as the villain!). This is one of the darkest movies I've ever seen (visually as well as thematically), but that's part of the charm of the old Kolchak series: complete blackness, with bogeymen jumping out of the dark to terrorize and/or kill. If anything, ""Strangler"" is an even more powerful film than its predecessor.

I always loved the character of Kolchak; he may have inspired me to go into journalism. As played by Darren McGavin, he is one of the all time great television characters. With his razor sharp wit and go-to-hell attitude, he was very much a product of his times (the Watergate era, sort of a ghost-busting Bob Woodward). Yet he also embodies everything a great reporter should be: tenacious, fearless, and a fighter for the rights of the general public.

McGavin embodies Kolchak so completely that I find it impossible to separate one from the other. I never saw a frame of the remake television series (recently cancelled), and it would never have worked. Some younger, unknown actor as Kolchak? Never. It's like remaking ""The X-Files"" and casting someone new as Fox Mulder.

No, McGavin WAS Kolchak and, thanks to DVD, always will be. Simon Oakland also made a great Vincenzo, and the crop of B-movie supporting actors who make cameos in both these films are a complete joy. I especially enjoyed Margaret Hamilton in ""Strangler,"" though Al Lewis was a hoot in the same film.

I can't say enough about the bad guys here. Barry Atwater makes a TERRIFYING vampire. Yeah, it seems kind of silly, the idea of a vampire driving a car around Vegas, buying gas and putting on fake mustaches, but Atwater gives us a real brawler; his final battle with Kolchak rattled my bones. That was the great thing about the ""Stalker"" movies and series: the monsters are DANGEROUS.

And Richard Anderson was equally menacing as the strangler. With his eloquent diction and smooth-talking charisma, he's more than a match for Kolchak's loud mouth and obnoxious, impulsive heroism.

I am amazed by the quality of these movies. They are exceptionally well directed and beautifully acted. And, in Kolchak, you can see the template for dozens of misunderstood movie heroes who take matters into their own hands. Bruce Willis' ""Die Hard"" cop, for one.

One other point: the Kolchak movies, with the exception of a few on-location shots in Las Vegas and Seattle, were obviously filmed on studio backlots. (The vampire's house could not possibly exist in Las Vegas!) On a certain level, the movies smack of cheese, but that's what makes them so damned effective. They are scarier and more realistic than they have a right to be. Without resorting to mindless gore, these films rely on atmosphere to sell themselves. Modern directors would do well to take a look at the Kolchak films in order to learn how to scare an audience. Just ratchet down the blood, guts and GOTCHA music, and allow our imaginations to go to work.",1135036800,7,3510,4.818936877076412
946786,5,6304960654,"Guess what -- sometimes quality really does triumph.

That is the case when it comes to ""The Night Stalker"" and its sequel ""The Night Strangler,"" which spawned a TV series, a cancelled remake series, and the undying adoration of ""X-Files"" creator Chis Carter. These cult movies are small-scale TV movies -- but are far scarier and more intelligent than most blockbusters.

Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin) is a frustrated reporter at a Las Vegas paper. But when he checks out some mysterious murders, he finds that the cops are suppressing information -- the victims all had their blood drained. Kolchak puts the clues together, and reaches the obvious conclusion: The serial killer is a vampire.

But his apoplectic editor (Simon Oakland) and the hostile police aren't about to admit it to the public, or even admit that the killer is a vampire -- despite his unnatural strength, longevity and toughness. Frustrated, Kolchak takes matters into his own hands to save Vegas from the vampire...

""The Night Strangler"" picks up with a pickled Kolchak in a Seattle dive. After his repentent ex-editor Tony Vincenzo gets him a new job, Kolchak finds himself in a similar situation -- hostile cops, repressive media, and a serial killer. This time, a man who looks like a corpse crushed the throat of a young belly-dancer and extracted a bit of her blood.

Kolchak digs deeper, and finds that similar serial killings have happened every twenty-one years since the Civil War. The killer is a doctor-turned-alchemist who apparently has been brewing a youth elixir every few decades -- and unless Kolchak can capture him quickly, this ruthless killer will vanish for another twenty-one years.

At heart, ""Night Stalker"" and ""Night Strangler"" are the best of B-movies: low budget, solid acting, excellent scripts. Thirty years after they were first made, these movies still stand up to scrutiny as excellent pieces of cult horror. Yes, even without violence, gore or special effects.

What makes these so scary? Mostly atmosphere. No blood and gore, no gruesome details. Not even much violence. The vampire and the alchemist aren't fully shown, except for brief glimpses, until the end. The fatal attacks are ever shown. Sure, the vampire does little but grin and screech, but Barry Atwater (almost) makes you feel sorry for him when Kolchak attacks.

And Chris Carter owes a debt to this. Reflecting the attitude of the times, this is also about the truth-seeking reporter, versus the cold media and police, who merely want to keep the populace ignorant, ""for their own good."" Wrap that up in some witticisms, smart dialogue and the occasional running gag (""Out! Get out!"" ""OUT! OUT! GET OUT!"" Kolchak and Vincenzo yell at each other, more than once). And the scripts are excellent as well, intelligent and tautly-written.

But the clincher is Kolchak himself -- a bit too brash, too forthright, and too determined for his own good, or the good of his job. In the tradition of hard-boiled detectives, he gets drunk or stares at pretty belly-dancers. But he's also dedicated to protecting people and searching for the truth, no matter how bizarre it may be.

Still creepy and dark after thirty-plus years, ""The Night Stalker"" and ""The Night Strangler"" are among the best movies of cult horror. Definitely a must see for fans of movie paranormality.",1133740800,6,3335,5.014466546112116

In typical Carl fashion, he finds a monsterous, undying doctor that is killing to make his ""elixer of life.""

I pulled this out the day before Halloween, and my wife and I kicked back to enjoy this slice of early 70's television.

The first thing I noticed is how quaint Vegas seemed. Darren McGavin plays Carl Kolchak, intrepid reporter, and he's clearly the source material for Mulder and the whole X-Files phenomenon. He traipses aroung Las Vegas, investigating murders which are apparently the work of a real vampire.

This TV movie does a few things very well.

First, McGavin is excellent...it's almost like he's in another film. Most of the other actors' work seems dated, but his is still fresh and funny.

Second, even though you KNOW that's it's probably a vampire, the screenplay deftly manipulates you into thinking it still may be some lunatic with a fetish.

Third, the cinematography and art direction are both of fairly high standards...this is not too far from anything you'd see at your local movie palace during the era.

The soundtrack isn't a highlight, but it sounds fine in context. The DVD transfer does its' source proud.

The ""sequel"", ""The Night Strangler"", is really a retelling...moving to Seattle...retaining the same basic plot, characters...but it swaggers with a bit more confidence. The whole ""underground"" Seattle thing was fascinating, and had me convinced it really existed...

While the special effects certainly cannot stand up to what can be done today, nor are the horror elements in anyway spectacular, there is something 'magical' about this show that cannot be explained by any other way they by saying the name, Darren McGavin.

Darren McGavin created a character in Carl Kolchak that you simply couldn't help but love. Gruff, somewhat unmannerly, obtrusive and still somehow lovable. Carl was always there at the scene of the next mysterious, unexplainable crime. Adorned in his crumpled hat and un-ironed white suit, tape recorder in one hand and his little carrying bag of 'essential' occult paraphanelia in the other, he was prepared to take on any demon, vampire or other supernatural creature that might appear. The success of this show was by in large determined by the acceptance of Darren McGavin's wonderful characterization.

Another factor in the 'Night Stalkers' popularity was the unique and ingenius idea of bringing the realm of monsters, evil spirits and demons out of the dusty environs of some exotic faraway country or somewhere in the distant and obscure past and transporting them right into modern day America. Vampires feasting on showgirls in downtown Las Vegas and centuries old immortals haunting Old Town Seattle. What a concept!

Truly a classic from the '70s which can still be enjoyed today. Carl Kolchak, the beloved Godfather of television horror!",1128816000,13,1593,5.166666666666667

With the new Kolchak series beginning this fall, I got fired up watch the originals.  I found this double feature and was not disappointed.  As an adult, they are a little more campy than I remembered, but they are good stories (except that they are EXACTLY the same story with variation only in the city and the fiend) and a lot of fun.  If you didn't watch the original series, you would probably only give them 2 or 3 stars, but if you're a fan they are great nostalgic fun.

I am well aware of the flaws in these films--Kolchak is impossibly well-connected with just the right tip always coming at the right time; even though the police hate him, they allow him to hang around, taking pictures and questioning suspects; he routinely steps outside his role as reporter and takes it upon himself to destroy evil; evildoers that effortlessly thrash dozens of well-built police officers don't seem to inflict much damage on the aging Kolchak even when they concentrate all of their energy on him.  I could go on, but I DON'T CARE.  I love Kolchak, his rumpled suit, battered hat, wiseass attitude, and the terrific way that Darren McGavin brings him to life.  As an elementary school student, I was moved to write to producer David Chase for permission to novelize the subsequent television series.  He was kind enough to reply with a polite refusal.

946819,4,6304960654,"These made-for-TV movies were extremely popular when they first aired in 1972 and 1973, respectively. As most of you probably know, they spun off a weekly TV series ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"", which ran from 1974 - 1975. The show and movies are now considered cult hits and are fondly remembered by fans. I recently watched some reruns of the show on the Sci Fi Channel, and even though I liked it, I have to say that these movies were much better than the show.

Some jaded people who are fans of gory rated R horror movies may not see what all the fuss is about, but for the rest of us, these 2 movies are still entertaining 30 + years later. ""The Night Stalker"" was the first, and best one. It relied more on being spooky, while ""The Night Strangler"" relied somewhat more on humor (but was still creepy in its own right). These movies were well-written and well-acted, especially for 1970s television, and still hold up today. I vaguely remember watching a scene of ""The Night Strangler"" when I was a kid before my mother made me turn it off. She said it was too creepy for a kid to watch (and her, too). So, I never got to see these until now.

The DVD quality is excellent! They must have restored these, because I didn't see any dust or film scratches at all when I watched them. It really is the cleanest transfer I've ever seen on a DVD (and I have quite a few). Also, the cover picture of Kolchak with a flashlight and the night sky, large spooky eyes  and the city behind him all looks pretty cool! I would liked to have seen more extras, especially interviews with the late Darren McGavin (they could have interviewed him several years ago) or other stars, but this is a small argument.

If you've seen the show and thought it was hokey, these movies were much better. If you're a fan of Kolchak, you can't go wrong with this DVD. If you're not a fan, you may become one after watching this DVD. Also, there is a new Night Stalker TV show based on this that's coming out this fall. You really should see the original before you watch the new one.

Highly Recommended!!",1124668800,2,2081,4.366925064599483
946820,5,6304960654,"The Night Stalker introduces to us  has been investigative reporter Carl Kolchak(Darren McGavin).  In this outing his beat is Las Vegas, Nevada, where he find a modern day Count Dracula like serial killer stalking the world famous Las Vegas strip.  The victims had lost all there blood and Kolchak finds out much to the chagrin of his cantankerous boss Anthony Vincenzo(Simon Oakland).
A great supporting cast includes Larry Linville(Major Burns of M.A.S.H), Ralph Meeker, Claude Akins, Charles McGraw and Carol Lynley.

Our second feature ""The Night Strangler"" has our hero Carl Kolchak, move from Las Vegas Nevada to The Pacific Northwest city of Seattle Washington. This time Kolchak stumbles on a serial killer who hides in the catacombs of the old Seattle Underground which burned down in 1889.  The year the first wave of Killings began and then occur every twenty-one years.

946821,4,6304960654,"This is it - one of the sequels of the famed ""Night Stalker"", starring Darrin McGavin as investigative reporter and conspiracy theorist Carl Kolchak.  An unpopular guy, Kolchak got the boot in Vegas at the end of ""Stalker"", and turns up in Seattle during the reign of a serial killer who strangles young and attractive dancing girls.  In dire need of a job, Kolchak looks up his old boss Tony Vincenzo (TV vet Simon Oakland who seems to have made half a career playing the incensed boss; he was also Robert Conrad's boss in ""Baa, Baa, Blacksheep"".) and wangles a reporter's slot on one of Seattle's oldest newspapers.  Vincenzo soon comes to regret the decision when Kolchak makes the ""Night Strangler"" case his own - soon running stories about a living-dead killer who rises from the depths of ""Old Seattle"" (the one that present-day Seattle is buried on top of) for a few weeks once every 21 years.  Dipping into the paper's archives, Kolchack finds reports of murders with details virtually identical to those of his time - but going back to the 19th century.  Though nobody seems to ever believe him, Kolchak digs deeper - learning about the subterranean Old Seattle, matching up with a comely (if motor-mouthed) Bellydancer named Louise Harper, running afoul of the Seattle police (who strangely never consider Kolchak a suspect even as they do everything else to bust him) and piecing together the identity of a man who seems to need gobs of human blood every 21 years.

""Strangler"" is a great movie, but it's perhaps a bit too long, and it's first half is definitely stronger than the second.  More than anything, ""Strangler"" is a great character story - though the characters soon overshadow the mystery that brought them together.  Besides Vincenzo and Harper, the story also boasts some fun cameos by characters who Kolchak should suspect of being the killer - John Carradine the newspaper's owner (who sounds like he's been walking the streets for a century); Wally Cox as the paper's archivist (who has an unnatural attachment to his dated articles); Al Lewis as a vagrant and, in the story's best ""guest appearance"", the wickedly great Margaret Hamilton as university professor who schools Kolchak into the chemistry behind immortality.

If the story gets slow, it's because there's an inordinately wide gap in the skepticism of the characters.  Everybody but Kolchak dismisses his story even as the facts make it obvious that something horrible is going on; Kolchak, on the other hand, buys into the first story he can find, and stick with it.  (Though ""Stalker"" was widely credited with inspiring the ""X Files"", it lacks the balancing disbelief that even Fox Mulder was allowed.)  That said, this story still holds you, and easily out-grips almost all thirty years of made-for-TV movies that followed it.",1124064000,2,2819,4.936575052854122

946823,5,6304960654,"What is wrong with Hollywood? Maybe I ought to rephrase that question since answering it would fill volumes. What I should say is: why does Tinseltown feel the need to remake ""The Night Stalker""? That's what is happening even as I write this review. The lunkheads over at ABC plan on debuting a brand new television series called, sadly, ""The Night Stalker."" The new program is based upon the classic television films and later short lived television series starring Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak, a mouthy and rumpled print journalist whose investigations into supernatural forces always placed him at loggerheads with his boss and the authorities. After watching the two films that cemented Kolchak as a cult hero, thanks to the folks at MGM, I cannot fathom why anyone today would attempt to rework this character. As I'll try to detail below, Darren McGavin placed such an imprint upon this character that casting anyone else in the role should amount to an offense punishable by the death penalty. But when has that ever stopped Hollywood? They would remake ""Gone with the Wind"" or ""Casablanca"" if they thought they could make a buck. Anyway, enough ranting and on to the review.

""The Night Stalker,"" the first film on the disc, introduces us to the intrepid Carl Kolchak as he sits in a seedy motel room recording the series of strange events he just lived through. And what a story it is! Kolchak, a reporter for a Las Vegas newspaper, begins his quest into the truly bizarre after the murder of a young woman. Bite marks on the female's neck, along with the disturbing fact that every ounce of blood in her body magically disappeared, raises more questions than answers. Then more murders take place, murders also involving lovely young lasses displaying the exact same traits as the first killing. These crimes mystify the police and coroner (Larry Linville!), but Kolchak quickly jumps to the conclusion that a vampire must be at work in Sin City. The derision he faces after advocating this position is deafening, and when his editor Tony Vincenzo (Simon Oakland) orders him off the story the pressure to cease and desist becomes downright threatening. But our hero plods on relentlessly, pursuing the story with a tenacity that borders on obsession. When the reporter discovers that a mysterious man by the name of Janos Skorzeny (Barry Atwater) might be behind the murders, and also discovers that his girlfriend Gail Foster (Carol Lynley) is in danger, he must take direct action to avert disaster.

The second film on the DVD, ""The Night Strangler,"" sees Carl Kolchak moving his base of operations to Seattle and to yet another job with another paper. Unfortunately, his former boss Tony Vincenzo also makes the move, and it's not too long before the two men are once again screaming at each other at the top of their lungs. Why? Because Kolchak discovers yet another series of mysterious killings that he soon surmises is the result of another supernatural occurrence. This time around, it's got something to do with a man who developed a way to achieve immortality. Of course, the potion requires the blood of young gals to work. Kolchak also runs into problems with the authorities again, who don't want to hear any nonsense about a 100 plus year old killer with a love for kooky chemistry. Carl trudges onwards and upwards, and he soon suspects that the murderer in question is hiding out in ""Underground Seattle,"" a part of town that was buried years ago yet still exists in a nearly pristine condition underneath the streets of the city. The showdown between our intrepid journalist and the crazed scientist/killer should finally convince the authorities that Kolchak was right all along. Wrong. Once again our hero is frustrated in his attempts to tell the public the truth.

I got a kick out of these two old television movies. I'd heard of Kolchak for years but never had the opportunity to see any of these movies until I rented this disc. It's definitely praiseworthy material. Darren McGavin doesn't simply show up and collect his check; he becomes Carl Kolchak in every blustery, hilarious sense of the word. His outfit, a rumpled suit that has seen far better days, hints at his always precarious financial situation arising in no small part due to his inability to follow orders from his superiors. A running joke in both films concerns how many newspapers Kolchak has worked for over the years, which isn't much of a surprise considering his demeanor. He has an awful tendency to sit right up front at news conferences and fire off extremely irritating questions to the annoyed authorities. They all know him by name, and they all hate him intensely. In other words, he's a journalist's journalist that the authorities take extreme measures to silence. I'll never be able to watch another Darren McGavin project without seeing Carl Kolchak, and that includes his turn as the grumpy father in ""A Christmas Story."" He's wonderful in both Kolchak films.

I could go on and on about these two films, explaining how they manage to work up some genuine chills, or how they employ some fine looking young ladies to serve as cannon fodder, or even how Kolchak's persistent inquiries into incidents covered up by the authorities mirror to a great extent how many in the public viewed the real world in the 1970s. Instead, I'll mention the extras. Producer Dan Curtis, who went on to direct ""The Night Strangler,"" offers up some interesting anecdotes about these films in two interviews on the disc. He explains that the first film grabbed an enormous audience share when it first aired, and also mentions that network executives were so pleased with the finished product that they wanted to release it theatrically. In other words, these films were a smash hit. They still are. Definitely give 'em a shot.",1123113600,5,5829,4.884848484848485

Two beloved made-for-TV movies (which later inspired a short-lived series) are given the deluxe treatment on this MGM single disc release.  Both films feature the inimitable Darren McGavin as veteran newshound Carl Kolchak, who has a special gift for sniffing out stories with a supernatural angle; and Simon Oakland as Vincenzo, Kolchak's skeptical and exasperated editor. In ""Stalker"", the two are in Las Vegas and become involved in a series of vampire murders; in ""Strangler"", the men have been chased out of town and meet up in Seattle where a very strong (dead) man is strangling young women and removing their blood!  Produced by ""Dark Shadows"" veteran Dan Curtis and scored by ""Dark Shadows"" composer Robert Cobert, both films offer genuine chills perfectly balanced with just the right amount of humor, and both feature fantastic supporting casts of veteran character players, all of whom play their parts with relish.

The MGM DVD features superb video and audio transfers of each film.  The soundtracks are crisp and clear, and the visuals are sharp with perfectly balanced color (you don't often see TV movies from the early 1970's looking this incredibly pristine, and I would guess that these programs did not look this good during their initial network television broadcasts).  Each film is accompanied by a short interview segment with producer Curtis who provides nuggets of information regarding the making of these specific movies, his own career, and the process of making telefeatures in the 1970's versus today.

It seemed like he was a man stranded outside of his own time. I mean, everything around him was part of the ""mod"" seventies, but Kolchak himself seemed like an old-time reporter right out of the 30's or 40's. Sure, his hair was a little shaggy, but you got the impression that this was because he didn't have the time or money to get a haircut- and not because he was being ""fashionable."" Perhaps that was the reason that he could spot creatures who also didn't belong in the modern world- because he was a misfit there himself.

In any case, these two movies are some of the best pure story telling ever put on film. The make-up, sets, and special effects aren't bad, but writing and acting carries the day. People by the early seventies considered themselves so ""sophisticated"" that they pretty much all considered traditional horror movies to be a joke. The Night Stalker made them believe again that vampires could really exist- and in Vegas, the most modern and sophisticated of all settings. And if anything, The Night Strangler, was even more skillfully and believably woven with its tale of immortality elixirs and of a necropolis beneath the streets of modern Seattle.

MGM has recently released these movies on either side of a single DVD.

946970,5,6304960654,"I just watched both THE NIGHT STALKER and THE NIGHT STRANGLER again, for the first time in 32 years! I was in elementary school when the Stalker first aired on TV, and it was the talk of the playground! We all thought it was the coolest thing to ever appear on network television (which I generally regard as a wasteland). The stories both hold up well today. Whether it's Kolchak (Darren McGavin) in Vegas or Seattle, battling a vampire (Barry Atwater) or a near immortal strangler (Richard Anderson), these Dan Curtis gems shine well in the dark. Both written by Richard Matheson (Duel), Stalker and Strangler have plenty of bite and lots of spooky charm. Stalker's my favorite, but Strangler is still better than most of what passes for ""horror"" on television. As a double feature, they are unbeatable! Watch for the cameos from Elisha ""House On Haunted Hill"" Cooke jr., Margaret ""Wicked Witch Of The West"" Hamilton, Al ""Grandpa Munster"" Lewis, Wally ""Underdog"" Cox, and John ""Shock Waves"" Carradine! Also, Carol (Poseidon Adventure, Beware! The Blob!"" Lynley as Kolchak's girlfriend in Stalker (Jo Ann Pflug in Strangler) and Simon Oakland as Kolchak's ever-yelling boss, Vincenzo. NIGHT STALKER / NIGHT STRANGLER are matched only by Rod Serling's Night Gallery, Trilogy Of Terror, Duel, and Ghost Story / Circle Of Fear for their sheer un-TV-ness.

946974,5,6304960654,"The ultimate conspiracy has been uncovered. The Smoking Man isn't the father of ""The X-Files"" Mulder. Reporter Carl Kolchak is. . In January 1972 ABC ran a movie of the week they had mixed feelings about. The promos had received a good response and preview audiences rated it as highly as a very good theatrical film. ""The Night Stalker"" seemed like it was slumming since it really was a horror movie about a vampire stalking women in modern day Las Vegas. The modern day Van Helsing hunting down the vampire is a veteran, cynical reporter in a seersucker suit. Reporter Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin) has had many big stories in his day but his sensationalistic style rubs his editor Vincenzo (Simon Oakland) the wrong way. Kolchak has a habit of ticking off city officials and generally getting the paper in hot water. When Kolchak announces in his story that a modern day vampire stalks the city streets he runs into a city cover up. Kolchak becomes the only person that can stop the vampire (Barry Atwater) because no one will believe his incredible story.

""The Night Stalker"" really put ABC's ""Movie of the Week"" on the map. With an unheard of 54 share (meaning over half the audience in the United States were watching the program), it blew away every other TV movie including the well regarded ""Brian's Song"" that came before it. Writer Richard Matheson (""The Twilight Zone"", ""What Dreams May Come""), producer Dan Curtis (""Dark Shadows"") and veteran TV and movie director John L. Moxey (""Circus of Fear"") crafted an amazing TV event. When it was first shown to ecstatic preview audiences ABC vice-president Barry Diller realized that they should have turned it into a theatrical feature.  McGavin's Kolchak and the second TV film and 1974 TV series that followed became the inspiration for Chris Carter's ""The X-Files"" and ""Millennium"". The first TV film holds up very well thirty-three years later. Moxey's sharp, realistic direction, Matheson's humorous but no nonsense script and the strong performances from the cast make this that rare TV movie that has the same qualities as a dynamic theatrical movie. At 74 minutes the brief, powerful first film is the better of the two. The sequel ""The Night Strangler"" also set the industry abuzz with a script that took all the best elements of the first film and crafted another suspenseful story that, if slightly less effective, still managed to capture the imagination of TV audiences.

""The Night Strangler"" takes place in Seattle, Washington. Kolchak was fired at the end of the first film. Vincenzo now the editor of the Seattle Daily Chronicle runs into a drunk Kolchak showing his clippings about the killer in the first film to any reporter that will sit still. Vincenzo takes pity on Kolchak and, against his better judgement, hires him again. The dead end story of the murder of an exotic dancer suddenly inflames local officals when Kolchak discovers that the same pattern of murders reoccur every 21 years. The circumstances are quite different from those of the first film. The victims all had their necks broken but with 7cc of blood and a puncture mark at the base of the skull. Kolchak's incredible story causes Vincenzo's ulcer to act up. Suddenly, Kolchak is hunting monsters again very much on his own.

With a strong supporting cast, witty well written script and taunt direction by Dan Curtis, ""The Night Strangler"" also became a huge success prompting ABC to commission yet a third script from Matheson. Instead, the network decided to develop the films into a TV series but then, strangely, dumped it in the TV graveyard on Friday night at 10 o'clock. It was summarily cancelled after only 21 episodes but the inspiration of ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" and the rest, as they say, is history.

 An exceptional transfer that looks great, there's very few analog blemishes that I can detect. The picture for both ""The Night Stalker"" and ""The Night Strangler"" occasionally appeasr a bit soft but, overall, the sharp images and vibrant color restores these TV classics to the way it should be viewed. The mono sound is faithfully reproduced.

 We get two short featurette/interviews with producer/director Dan Curtis on the history and production of the film. Both include clips from the respective movies but little more. A bit more on the production and perhaps some of the publicity materials also would have been interesting to include.

This dynamic duo of classic TV movies presented on a single dual sided disc  both were overdue for such treatment. The transfers here appear better than the previous Anchor Bay editions. The brief featurettes with Dan Curtis discussing the history of both movies provide a fun glimpse into the challenges of producing TV movies in the 70's. A pity there's no commentary track from Dan Curtis, Richard Matheson or any of the surviving cast members for either movie.",1092528000,206,4879,4.939024390243903
946975,5,6304960654,"When I was 9, I used to stay up and watch Kolchak: The Night Stalker.  To me, it was some seriously scary stuff.  I didn't know at the time that the series was based on 2 made-for-TV movies from a couple of years earlier.  Many years later I was in the Air Force in 1987 and stumbled onto the original Night Stalker on VHS.  I immediately rented it.  The memories came flooding back.  The Night Stalker, when originally aired, became the most viewed TV movie ever (at the time).  It would be many more years before I got to see the second movie, The Night Strangler as part of this DVD double feature.
The Night Stalker is the story of Carl Kolchak (played by Darren McGavin), a formerly respectable reporter who fell on hard times and has ended up at a Las Vegas newspaper, searching for the one big story that will propel him back to the New york daily papers and the Big Time.  That big story comes in the form of a killer with amazing strength who is, for some reason, draining his victims of blood.  There is much nervous joking about the killer thinking he is a vampire.  However as Kolchak follows the killer's trail, he comes to the impossible realization that the killer may indeed be a genuine vampire, and since no one else will believe or at least admit the possibility, it is up to him to kill it.
The character of Kolchak works because he is a lot like the rest of us.  When the killer discovers him in hiding, Carl screams like a little girl and runs like mad!  It makes us examine how we would truly react if faced face-to-fang with a REAL mythical undead creature. Carl is cowardly in many ways but he is noble on some level too.  He risks his life to stop the creature, but then again, maybe he is just doing it to land that perfect story.
The Night Strangler takes place in Seattle (Kolchak moves there after the events of the first film) and he bumps into his old editor from the original movie, Anthony Vincenzo (played by the great Simon Oakland)and begs his way into another job.  Soon he is investigating a series of murders where the killer apparently re-appears every few decades.  This story is very similar to the character of Toomes in the first season of the X-Files, and since Chris Carter's inspiration for X-Files was the Kolchak series, it is possible that this resemblance is not coincidental.
As many other reviewers have mentioned, it is a SHAME that the Kolchak TV series has not been released on DVD yet.  I am sure it will happen eventually, but the sooner the better.  These movies are 30 years old now, but they still hold up today.  Just try to ignore the polyester suits, plaid sports jackets, and go-go boots!
Note:  in August 2004 a new release of these 2 films is being issued.  It supposedly will have some featurettes and interviews.  I am reviewing the 1998 release which has no extra features.  Hold out for the new release if you have not bought this yet.",1090195200,3,2907,4.435028248587571
947036,5,6304960654,"Man...  I saw this and it took me right back to my childhood.  I remembered the old house we lived in during that period, and how my elementary school friends and I used to revel in this show.  We loved this show.  If was by far the hippest TV show of the early 1970's.  After this, ""The 6-Million Dollar Man"" took over.  I was about 7-9 years old during this show's all-to-brief run.  That is the prime time of the childhood imagination.  I had several lost time experiences while watching this show.  My sister hated it because it was ""too scary"".  That was why we loved it.  The opening theme song is absolutely unforgettable.
This show had a ton of entertainment value.  It is one of the forgotten gems of the golden era of TV.  A number of academy award winning directors got their first breaks directing episodes of this show.  Chris Carter-creator of the X-Files-often sited this show as one of his inspirations.  The studio team killed this program because the FX budget was too limited and noir filming schedule was killing the cast and crew.

Thankfully they have come back, and as an adult I can so appreciate the sarcasm and humor that made the series cutting edge. Unlike Dark Shadows which is so drawn out you forget who the people are, Kolchak cuts right to the chase. His slightly upbeat caustic attitude yet willingness to be frightened and still try to do the right thing regardless of what anyone else thinks is what makes him stand out in Televisionland. By today's standard, there probably isn't enough blood for some horror fans, but notably in true horror, there really isn't that much to begin with, as it is a state of mind.
 I can only hope that the entire twenty episodes gets transferred to DVD in order to preserve an exceptional piece of history.
 This is a definite ""MUST ADD TO MY COLLECTION"" set. The realism of the film is haunting and makes you think twice about some things normally taken for granted. Besides, who can resist seeing someone actually use a real typewriter ?

The Night Stalker is just scary - the vampire is creepy because we can see much humanity in him.  The Night Stangler has a very human nemesis - who wants immortality at any cost...I don't want to give the plots away just watch it.

Without re-hashing the story (or talking about the ""Strangler"" which is much more forgettable), here is why I believe ""Night Stalker"" is Vampire #1!!;(SPOILER CAUTION)I'll be careful.
-People react logically to events in this movie.  Few are willing to believe there really is a vampire.  ""Just a nut who thinks he's a vampire"".
-Kolchak relishes the supernatural and enjoys kreeping out his boss.  The police keep a big thumb on him to prevent panic.
-Everything is believable.  This is how a vampire would live in a modern society.
-You never really get to know the vampire. He is silent, elusive, reclusive, powerful and intelligent.  You don't have dialogue with this vampire.  He has only one purpose:  GET BLOOD!  This makes him exceedingly menacing and creepy.
-The vampire is validated by an encounter with a large group of police.  Their inability to stop him, dispite shooting him at close range, has them in denial.
-The vampire has an ingenius (and diabolical) method of feeding without getting ""take-out"".  A great touch of ""realism"".
-Kolchak is a reporter, and the only one willing to face the threat for what it is.  Consequently, he is ill-equipped to be a hero.  This adds a great sense of dread during the final confrontation.
-The music is used sparingly.  Often, the lack of sound builds incredible tension.
There is so much more, but hopefully you get the point.  This is a truly scary movie.  If you like ""prince Charming"" Dracula depictions or the Modern ""Techno-vamps"" from ""Blade"" (which is a great movie) then you might not like this.  This vampire is as down-to-earth scary as they come!!",1066348800,3,1755,4.851851851851852

Directed by John Llewellyn Moxey, the story chronicles events in Las Vegas when the bodies of several young women are found drained of blood. Intrepid reporter Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin) increasingly suspects that something supernatural is at foot, which his bellowing boss finds incredulous (Simon Oakland), as well as city authorities (Ralph Meeker, Claude Akins & Kent Smith). Elisha Cook Jr is on hand as an informant while Barry Atwater plays Janos Skorzeny.

The Night Stalker was a hugely successful TV movie, which naturally led to a sequel, The Night Strangler (1973), and a series that ran for one season from 1974-1975 (20 episodes), not to mention numerous Kolchak books. This original movie was the best of the batch with The Night Strangler almost as good and even better in some ways. Both movies established the template (formula) for all that followed.

What makes this movie the best of the batch? Answer: The streamlined story is full of intrigue, action, ravishing women, horror and suspense; and the jazzy score doesnt hurt. As far as the women go, lovely Carol Lynley is on hand as Kolchaks babe, but not enough is done with her. Nevertheless, there are 3-4 peripheral beauties. The sequel flick and the first episode The Ripper followed this pilots lead in the female department, along with ""The Werewolf,"" but the rest of the series was rather weak on this front.

Since this is a TV flick from the early 70s don't expect a much gore.

==========

THE NIGHT STRANGLER (1973)

Directed by Dan Curtis, the story chronicles events in Seattle when the strangled bodies of several young women are found. Intrepid reporter Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin) discovers that the same kinds of murders occur every 21 years dating back to the late 1800s.  Simon Oakland plays Kolchaks bellowing boss while Jo Ann Pflug appears as a genial belly dancer who assists Carl. Scott Brady plays the police captain while Wally Cox is on hand as a helpful scribe. Richard Anderson has a key role.

The Night Strangler was the follow-up to the highly successful The Night Stalker (1972) and led to a series that ran for one season from 1974-1975 (20 episodes), not to mention numerous Kolchak books. The two pilot movies are the best of the batch and established the template (formula) for the series and books.

Like the first film, theres a lot of intrigue, action, ravishing women, horror and suspense, plus a percussion-oriented jazzy score thats even better. The Night Strangler adds a little effective comedy and the antagonist is more complicated. The underground lair is mysterious and the mummified family is creepy, but the details of the alchemists elixir and strategy seem contrived.

Its good to have Kolchak team-up with someone (cutie Pflug), which rarely happens in the ensuing series, but it was welcome when it did (The Energy Eater and Demon in Lace). There are a few peripheral beauties (Regina Parton, Nina Wayne and Francoise Birnheim), which the rest of the series mostly lacked, except for the debut episode, The Ripper, and ""The Werewolf.""

Since this is a TV flick from the early 70s don't expect much gore.

THE MOVIE RUNS 90 minutes (with the original TV release more streamlined at 74 minutes) and was shot in Seattle and the Bradbury Building in downtown, Los Angeles, with studio work done at 20th Century Fox Studios. WRITER: Richard Matheson (teleplay) & Jeffrey Grant Rice (characters & formula).
