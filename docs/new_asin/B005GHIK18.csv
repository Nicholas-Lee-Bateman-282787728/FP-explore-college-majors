4690586,5,B005GHIK18,"Terri Abney stars as Monique Matters, nickname ""Money"" in an inner city coming of age story.  Money lives with her single mother. She doesn't know her real father, although we, the audience find out midway. Mom sends her to Catholic school because she wants her daughter to have a chance in this world. Life is at the point where Mom (Aunjanue Ellis) realizes she must change her pot smoking, loser boyfriend life in order to prevent her daughter from emulating her. Money has two girlfriends. One attends Catholic school with her. She (London K. Powell) keeps her boyfriends happy with oral sex. The other girl (Victoria Wallace)goes to public school and can't read. She likes Money and prefers girls to boys. Money prays to God to be normal. She escapes life through her tough life poetry which we get to hear from time to time.

There is also a subplot involving a priest(James Whalen) at the local hospital who likes women too much.

Washington DC is in the background scene, I assume that is the location. The movie is well scripted and well acted by a group of virtual unknowns. What is nice about this gritty African-American urban story is that it doesn't involve gangs or 50 Cent. Mom tries to restore her faith and instill faith in her daughter. She is sick (we find out midway what she has) and believes her days are numbered. Her daughter Money is all that matters to her and life doesn't come easy. 5 star story of despair and hope.

4690600,4,B005GHIK18,"Good movie. The title of the movie is and isn't what the movie is about. When you learn the truth about things, it can change your prospective on a number of things. The young lady learned this and decided to fight for a better future.",1379548800,,235,4.2444444444444445

4690602,4,B005GHIK18,"Wow, I had to reach for the tissue more than few times during this movie. I myself being a black female with friends who grew up in the inner city, found so many similarities in the story of ""Money"" and our lives. Nice to see a current perspective on Urban life. When I was younger in my teens I remember watching ""Just another Girl on the I.R.T."" and this film had some of that flavor.",1377388800,,386,4.16
4690603,4,B005GHIK18,"I thought it was very well done for a low budget independent film - good story, good cast for the most part and good film quality",1376179200,,129,4.0
4690604,4,B005GHIK18,"Shot right here in the nations capital.  I didn't know what to really expect from this movie but wanted to see it because of Aunjanue Ellis.  I was pleasantly surprised with this sad coming of age story about a young girl trying to find herself in the set place of Washington, DC.  What I really liked most about the movie, although it didn't go into great detail, is that it showed what life is like for a lot of the inner city youth struggling to fit-in to two different worlds and how there is a perception that life is different between Uptown (that some locals think where all the resources are) and a neighborhood across the river (Anacostia and other area's of South and Northeast).  It also showed the struggles that some of our youth are facing in the inner city with their family dynamic as well, no matter what section of the city you're from.

Growing up in the city and surrounding areas one could relate to some of the struggles this young lady went through as you see it all over the city, I think that's what touched me most about it. The fact that the director didn't try to glamorize or, in my eyes, stereotype a particular way of life that we see in most films was another plus for me.

I read some reviews and saw how some people were put off from the language or characters that were portrayed in the film and I'm here to tell you that there are some families that have that type of relationship.  This movie was more like looking at some people's lives I know personally right on the big screen without needing to see the buffoonery of Reality TV.",1375920000,,1569,4.371134020618556
4690605,4,B005GHIK18,great acting... real life issues that many of will never face but by watching this movie can soon understand. A great drama.,1375401600,,124,4.681818181818182
4690606,4,B005GHIK18,"Interesting story about a teenager whose name is Monique ""money "" matters. She has a talent for poetry. Her mom had her young and is sick. Family secrets come out. Interesting how their lives connects to the lives of other characters",1374192000,,233,4.7073170731707314
4690607,5,B005GHIK18,"I enjoyed this movie, the actors did a great job.  I really like Aujanue Ells, she is an excellent actress even though she is not well known.  She delivers her role well as a mother plagued with disappointments, tragedies, bitterness and devastation in her life.  I'm from South East,it was good to see familiar neighborhoods in the DMV.  Good movie to watch.",1373328000,,359,4.741935483870968
4690608,3,B005GHIK18,This was a good movie overall I give it 3 stars. This was something else both actresses did good on there part. I am glad the Girl money found her voice in the movie,1372809600,,165,3.8823529411764706

4690613,5,B005GHIK18,"Aunjanue Ellis is a highly underrated actress. This is family drama at its best, a story of survival and hope in desperate situation.  Stellar job by the young co-star",1368489600,,167,4.758620689655173
4690614,4,B005GHIK18,"I love this movie. It is a story about a girl named Money. Money grows up in a rough neighborhood. She attends a private catholic school which her struggling mother fights tooth and nail to afford. Money doesn't know who her father is though the audience is clued in early on. She's a poetic soul whose trying to figure out where she fits in the world. Money's mother becomes sick and eventually Money finds out who her father is and why her mother hid it from her for so long. She struggles briefly with her attraction to ""braids"" her friend and almost girlfriend. The attraction and connection is obvious but other than a few kisses here and there your sort of not sure if they will develop a relationship through out the movie. At the end they appear to be comforting each other the way girlfriends would but its unsaid and hence I say its an almost lesbian movie. That's just fine. If you are looking for a lesbian romance film don't pass this one up because its in the almost category. It is a beautifully written well filmed movie that should never be passed up regardless of what it is you originally were looking for or what your orientation is. You WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.",1367712000,,1183,4.481481481481482

4690616,3,B005GHIK18,"but not suprised due to every day life. i wasn't expecting this type of film. but i'm glad i did see it, because it hits home.  i thought the movie was going to be something with dollars = money. Money is her daughter's name.",1365206400,,225,4.113636363636363
4690617,1,B005GHIK18,this movie was just stupid.  There were so many wrong things in it that I was just disappointed with it all together.,1364947200,,117,4.318181818181818
4690618,5,B005GHIK18,This movie depicts a facet of the reality of black women living in disadvantaged circumstances. It hides nothing & gives it to you straight. The actors in this film are really talented. I felt all the emotions quite keenly. I recommend this movie.,1364428800,,247,4.767441860465116
4690619,5,B005GHIK18,This was a very powerful story of a mother who was down on her luck trying to do the right thing for her daughter.  Throughout the movie you may not agree with the choices and decisions that she makes but it shows her love. It is the coming of age story for a daughter who is lost trying to understand her mother's love and find her way. A child who discovers she does matter.,1363478400,,376,4.081081081081081
4690620,5,B005GHIK18,All the actors and actress are excellent performers especially the young black girl money and her partner braids. This movie hits hard on various issues and real situations growing up in tha hood. I know first hand experience so I could realate wholeheartedly to this movie.

4690624,2,B005GHIK18,"This movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I didn't realize when I purchased it that it took place in S.E., D.C., which hit home for me.

Although I enjoyed the fact that it touched on portraying real life issues, it lacked something to maintain my interest. It was too slow and rather boring. Lots of profanity as well.",1344470400,4,329,4.306451612903226
4690625,5,B005GHIK18,"This was a good movie. It presents issues that many deal with and is an eye opener to what is going on across america, whether we believe it or not. It tackles a lot of complex issues and the script and acting was good. I wish the ending gave a better conclusion to what happens to Monique, but other than that it was a great movie.",1341446400,2,332,4.045454545454546

4690627,4,B005GHIK18,"I thought the idea of this movie wasn't bad at all. The acting wasn't bad either. The camera (filming the movie) was a little weird at times with the angles but maybe the budget was low...and they kept showing this pink/purple plastic flower during the movie which was weird. Otherwise, I am giving a decent rating because I have not seen any other movies with this storyline...I think this would make a better book than movie. That way, more of the Priest's past could be explained, etc. I do wish they included whether Money was tested for HIV/AIDS and whether she would be okay after the mom died.",1339027200,,600,4.564814814814815
4690628,4,B005GHIK18,This was a good movie. It started off slow but  the ending was sad and could have given detail what happened to the daughter after the mother dies.,1334016000,,147,4.25
4690629,4,B005GHIK18,"This movie is a far cry from when I grew up. Girls kissing girls without shame, calling your mom by her first name; basically raising yourself with your own morals. This was a big mess of stuff for me. While it's quite engaging, I was watching with my daughter and we were both disgusted by so many things but continued watching and both agreed that it was a sad, sad story for this child trying to find her place in this world with a mom that should have been reported to DHS at the very least. So many sad stories of children these days! I suppose the story needed telling but perhaps a little less drama; but would it be compelling enough to sell? Mixed feelings but very sad situation for the daughter. It hinted on what might be her future, but, it would have been nicer to have actually known what would happen after her mom and 'dad' 'left'. My movie wouldn't play even today although I have lots of time left. I would recommend it but rate it X for drug use, homosexuality, rape and nudity among some. This story needs telling.",1331164800,6,1035,4.34020618556701
