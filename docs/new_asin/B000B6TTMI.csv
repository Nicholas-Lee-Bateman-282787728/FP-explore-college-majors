8082597,1,B000B6TTMI,"Well, you do get some actual real combat material footage. But, there is NO attention paid to chronology. They go from Korea to 1942 WWII stuff and it loses all context. Also, that THEME SONG becomes intolerable. You hear it all the time and it is pathetic. I am a 2 tour Marine vet of the Vietnam War. I love good war stuff. This is not it.  ...Oscar",1328054400,,351,4.161764705882353
8082598,3,B000B6TTMI,"The sections Bloody Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Air War on Japan, and Surrender of Japan are good, But the section shifting Tides in the Orient is not good and the section on the Korean War ends abruptly in the middle of the war when China entered the war.",1249776000,,247,4.276595744680851
8082599,5,B000B6TTMI,"This is the most comprehensive of all the videos which I have seen on the subject of the Pacific War.  The series was made in 1951 by Time, Inc., and features film clips from a number of sources: American, Japanese, British, Chinese, Australian, and others.  The narration is straightforward.  The picture quality is good.  Animated maps help you to follow the progress of the various campaigns.  The series covers a lot of ground, so you don't always get as much detail as youd like.

Volume 2 is 2 hours and 8 minutes long.  Some of the subjects covered are: Japanese society in the early 1900s; Admiral Todos victory over the Russians in 1905; The Philippines in the early 1900s; MacArthur and the Philippine Scouts and Reserves; the 1941 invasion of the Philippines; the fall of Manilla; the Greater Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere; MacArthurs departure from the Philippines; The fall of Bataan and Corregidor; General Homma, the Beast of Bataan; Admiral Nimitz; Recovery from Pearl Harbor; US air bases on Fiji, New Caledonia, and Espiritu Santo;  the Battle of the Java Sea; US attacks on Wake Island; US, Australian assault of New Guinea; The Doolittle raid on Tokyo; The Japanese assault on Port Moresby; The Battle of the Coral Sea; Breaking Japanese codes; The Battle of Midway;  Marines land on Tulagi and Guadalcanal; The Battle of Salvo Island; Japanese presence in Bougainville and New Georgia; The Battle of Santa Cruz; The US invasion of the Russell Islands; Rendova; the taking of the Munda airfield on New Gerogia; The two Battles of Kula Gulf;  the Japanese on Rabaul; Bella La Bella Island; Japanese occupation of Attu and Kiska in the Aleutians and the American response; Japanese conscription of their own people for the war effort; Australian Diggers in Port Moresby and Buna in New Guinea; Battle of the Bismarck Sea; Lae; the US attack on Bougainville;",1047340800,,1871,4.94888178913738
