2325179,5,B0009VNCRS,"This is safe viewing for even the youngest toddlers and preschoolers, and is an exceptionally well-written children's collection, packed with timeless moral themes. There are many wonderful ""takeaways"" to be gleaned from the adventures of Davey and his big, goofy dog, Goliath -- humor, love, learning, music, friendship, simple examples of God's hand in our everyday life, honor, philanthropy, integrity, stewardship, servitude, and even some real-life lessons in the School of Hard Knocks.

I am no expert, but I believe this is what was commonly referred to as Claymation. Despite having originated in the 1960s, these renderings are of decent quality and have been very well received by my children. We have the set of four DVDs and enjoy watching them over and over again. In total among the four DVDs, there are (22) 15-minute episodes, and (4) 30-minute specials.

Highly recommended; watch them together and be blessed!",1295308800,2,927,5.256756756756757
2325180,5,B0009VNCRS,"Davey and Goliath are a favorite from my childhood. Thaey were produced b the Lutheran church but there is not ""religion"" taught in these wonderful stories. Just good family moral values that our children need more than ever. Things like loving your neighbor, telling the truth, giving to others being better than getting all for youself. And admit it who doesn't love the fact that Goliath the dog talks. These are classics and all children should see them starting at a young age.",1216339200,,482,4.819277108433735

2325183,4,B0009VNCRS,"I remember watching these shorts as a little girl. I bought this volume primarily for ""Christmas Lost and Found,"" which I remembered fondly, but found myself watching some of the other sequences and enjoying them. I particularly like that, although love of God is frequently mentioned, the real emphasis is on being a good person and doing good deeds, not pushing a particular religion.",1160438400,3,386,5.046875
2325184,5,B0009VNCRS,I remember seeing Davey and Goliath episodes as a child over 30 years ago. It is a pleasure to get these for my own children. The simple stop-action films continue to capture attention - even in this age of CGI. I highly recommend this product and I am thrilled with the simple moral messages children learn from these stories.,1135036800,3,327,4.559322033898305
2325185,5,B0009VNCRS,"This item is set to release 11/18/2005.  But also scheduled to release in October/November, 2005 are Volumes 2,4 and the Holiday Spectacular.  What isn't clear so far, is that the Holiday Spectacular IS Volumes 2, 3, and 4 in one package, according to the distributor's website: Starlight Home Entertainment.  So save your money and just buy the Holiday Spectacular 3-disk set.  You get 18 15-minute episodes, plus three 30-minute Holiday-themed episodes (Halloween, Christmas, New Years) for a total of 6 hours of viewing.",1125532800,11,523,5.265060240963855

8067546,5,B0009VNCRS,"Davey & Goliath present wholesome tales with a strong moral message.
Cute Claymation animation by Art Clokey works well here.
Voices include none other than Hal Smith - best known for his role as Otis on The Andy Griffith Show.
Recommended for kids of all ages.",1306022400,,261,4.695652173913044
