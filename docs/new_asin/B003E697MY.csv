4113515,2,B003E697MY,"I enjoyed the novel this movie was based on - and was quite pleased to find it among the Lifetime offerings on OnDemand. But...what a waste of two hours. Kim Basinger is terribly miscast as the lead character, a woman dealing with painful memories of the loss of her father and with a mother who seems to be going mad. Basinger delivers all her lines as if she's reading a bedtime story to someone she's trying not to rouse, very breathy and whispery, and her emotional responses seem to run the gamut from A to B. She's surrounded by a capable supporting cast, but it's not enough to save the movie from her dreadful performance.

At least, there's comedic value in her cheap-home-perm 1980's hairdo!",1349568000,,701,4.608

4113518,5,B003E697MY,"This is an excellent film; great cast, beautiful locale, and a unique story.  It touches on a really forbidden topic - dissatisfied housewife rushes to tormented mother, meets monk, has affair - who touches on this kind of topic anymore?  For that matter, how many monks look like Alex Carter?  The best performance, though, is by Bruce Greenwood; the confused husband.  His subtle performance of the steady, supportive spouse is so touching, especially when he is shaken by his wife's sudden announcement of wanting time on her own.  The guy has great facial expressions of confusion, incredulity, and then that quiet but deadly anger.  It'll make you weep!  A really good film!!!!!!!!!!",1284336000,33,688,5.089285714285714
4113519,1,B003E697MY,"The Mermaid Chair
1 Disc Widescreen, released July 13, 2010

""The Mermaid Chair"" was a Lifetime movie from 2006 directed by Steven Schachter based on the book by Sue Monk Kidd. It stars Kim Basinger as Jessie who is struggling in her twenty-year marriage to her husband played by Bruce Greenwood and needs time away when she runs to help her mother who has a quirk for slicing off her fingers on occasion. While on the island she grew up, she finds herself in a mutual attraction with a Benedictine monk, Brother Thomas played by Alex Carter.

In this Lifetime movie, the strong woman feels herself chained down by the limits her marriage has put upon her and she longs to have the spirit of a free mermaid apparently. Her husband is a psychiatrist and places valid calls to her on the island to assess her mother's mental status since she's been cutting off fingers and Jessie immediately is turned off by this so-called controlling behavior he is exhibiting. Something about meeting this monk and his skills in net-weaving, boating, and fishing just really gets her going far enough to place her marriage in jeopardy.

Typically, Jessie has a network of female friends on the island to support her and her mother in this time of crisis including a kooky African woman, a Mermaid tourist attraction shop owner, and her mentally handicapped daughter who can read dogs' minds. They share spiritual stories about mermaids, turtle skulls, and dancing around fires as ways of bringing themselves luck but all it seems to do is motivate Jessie's mother to do some more finger amputation and bury them in the garden as penance for something she won't reveal to anyone.

Kim Basinger has a series of voiceovers throughout that fill in mermaid legend stories well, but don't add much else and get annoying. Her flip-flopping back and forth between her thoughtful, too caring and concerned husband and this sweet ex-lawyer man beginning to doubt taking his vows of faith as a monk solely based on her behavior gets ridiculous. Finally it turns out the point of the story had nothing to do with either romance, but with her mother's past.

Situations like this make me ask what is the point, but those Lifetime movies gotta have their romance regardless if it matters in the plot and seeing as how each of them is based on a novel, you can bet it's a romance novel of some sort. This was my least favorite of the Lifetime movies I reviewed this week.

4113520,2,B003E697MY,"Mills and Boon meets Hollywood. Mawkish voice over drives the plot. Confusingly blends European mermaid legends with Stateside Christianity. Neither realistic nor fantasy. Lacks dramatic tension and the plot develops clumsily. Mid life crisis artist (Bassinger) goes to isalnd community where her mother has deliberately chopped of her finger to emulate a mermaid saint. Whilst there has an affair with a monk before finding out the link between her fathers death and her mothers detached finger. The monks sat mending pure white fishing nets in the immaculately lawned Country House hotel which is their monastery must be a metaphor for something, but what?

4113526,4,B003E697MY,"I read the book because I had loved Sue Monk Kidd's ""The Secret Life of Bees""  so much.  I found the book to be sadly disappointing... not because of the content of the story, but the writing and logic behind characters motives both seemed plodding and contrived.  I was actually surprised anyone would even want to make a movie from the book... so I thought I would watch ""a little bit' of the movie expecting it to be mawkish and silly.  I ended up watching the whole thing!  I was amazed that the actors could yield some rich, fleshed out performances from characters that seemed oddly flat on the page.  It was especially nice to see Kim Bassinger in a dramatic role showing such pathos and sorrow.  Sadly, I am sure it is her life experiences that created this ability to reflect sadness and doubt which make her a fine actress now, rather than the lovely screen idol she was in her youth.  I recommend it for skeptics of the source material and for anyone who wants to understand the need for forgiveness and moving on as well as forgiveness and repairing damage.",1420848000,,1069,4.5025906735751295

I'm just not interested in stories where, in order to find oneself, they must forsake their faith and their marriage when there was no abuse.

It was just ""Hi, how are you.  Want to get together?""  It left me wondering why she cheated on her husband with someone she just met?  A monk, no less.  Likewise, you are left wondering why she is unhappy in her marriage.  Her relationship with her mother is unclear as well.

This story covers the bond of family and community in powerful ways, and lets you deal with your own demons - it is a beautiful, non judgmental journey through death, terminal illness, honor secrets, and myths.  It is in every way a heart breaker and you have to cry for your self, for the people in the story, for everyone who has come before these people to make every renting decision.  The kindness of the community in the rightness of what they did to support the father, and the support they gave one another is something we can all only hope for in our own lives.

4113674,1,B003E697MY,"This movie is a very poor adaptation of the book, which was far more complex in it's development of the relationships and conflicts between and within them. At the same time, the book's development of the dominant love relationship was built with more subtlety, believability and palatable tension.  The movie has taken a powerful book and transformed it into a true romance ""piece of fluff.""  Kim Basinger just does not work as the main female character.  She has been cast wearing beautiful (and appropriate) garments with her long crimped hair stylishly flowing in the wind (when there is wind), giving more of an impression of a high fashion model who is being photographed in a movie set.  Overall, I felt like most of the acting was just mediocre to poor.  I recommend not watching the movie and, instead, reading the book.  It will take more time, but it will not be time wasted.",1404604800,3,886,4.758169934640523

4113698,3,B003E697MY,"I'd say this movie is simply a fantasy. There is no point to getting outraged by the story of the affair, or be offended because it doesn't mesh with Catholicism.  The entire movie is unrealistic and unbelievable so why single out certain parts?  If you are wanting to watch a non violent romance, to lose yourself in LaLa land, then by all means indulge.  When I was younger and a bit more starry eyed I may have been enchanted by this movie.  It is a way to remove yourself from reality for ninety minutes. But, as such, for me , now, while I may have been swept up slightly in the Thornbirdesque feel, there are so many issues with this one, that it is difficult to call this a great movie . Back to where I began, lose yourself in the fantasy, if you so choose, but if you prefer your characters, settings, and storyline a bit more realistic, I don't feel this is the movie for you.",1402704000,,886,4.255952380952381

Frankly, as an avid reader, often the visuals are not as rich as I imagined them when I read the story. If you are a fan of Sue Monk Kidd, as I am, then you will enjoy this film. Even my husband said it was good for a ""chick"" flick! I don't know that  would even assign it that genre category, but it is a well-written, well-acted film. There is a rich base of history with lovely scenery and visuals that help carry the story line through the whole film.

They had the typical ""let's have secluded island sex"" only after the second time the couple meet.  As the story unfolds (no spoiler here), you find the senior monks in the monastery participated in something no monk would ever do (completely against their belief system).  Completely unbelievable for me, but hey who watches movies that represent reality?
The movie followed the cultural norms of hollywood, glorified sex outside of marriage, abandon your marriage for convenience, inaccurate portrayal of religious beliefs, etc.  But they find ""true love"" based on some dreamy notion.",1402444800,,686,5.080357142857143

Mermaids,mermaid chairs, the holy mother church and  self destructive saints.  A woman caught in that time of life where there are grown kids, then a parent that causes all kinds of trouble.

She breaks her vows to her husband (which, she conveniently tells the day before she sleeps with the monk that she wants to ""try it apart.""  Nice.) and the monk breaks his vows to the church and to God.

Lovely protagonists.  There's a crazy mother who cuts off her fingers in there and they keep trying to make these two incredibly selfish people seem like they're meant for each other.  I really liked it when she tells the monk that she's falling in love with him after they've slept together and snuck around but they know nothing about each other.  Sure, that sounds like love.  Or the more appropriate word is lust for two very selfish vow-breaking narcissists.

Awful movie that keeps trying to get you to feel sympathy towards two unsympathetic people.  I don't know how people actually find this BS touching.",1399939200,5,960,4.666666666666667

I think she may have to go through some real hard times in her life (not just the whole Baldwin thing)  to break free of whatever fear it is that keeps her from being real on the big screen(or small laptop).

4113779,2,B003E697MY,"Unlike some other reviewers, I found the acting fine. Perhaps some wanted to blame the actors for what turned out to be a mawkish story. The plot seemed to want to project nice family sentiment, but involved a married woman having an affair, a monk having an affair, having an affair in daylight on a beach where anyone with binoculars or good eyesight could have seen them getting it on (projecting in the viewer that these two consenting ""adults"" have the minds of high school kids), and a monk agreeing to help a sick man (who seems in pretty good shape when the event occurs) commit suicide. The author has obviously revised what society deems appropriate - even if one isn't religious - and pronounced it good. So I found it impossible to relate to or care about the characters. Lastly, the overly sentimental film score raised the mawkishness to even greater heights; I had the impression that the score tried to create emotion in the audience to make up for the fact that the script/story wasn't achieving that goal.",1399420800,5,1023,4.688888888888889

It  is setup at the monastery and it draws intriques from people visitng the monastery.  The idea of a married woman flaling for a monk didn't seem right but then that makes the story.

4113788,5,B003E697MY,"I loved this movie, with its fabulous cast and sensitive, real-life story line.  Sometimes in life, we maker rash decisions based on how we feel in the moment, and this story encourages us to use care with the Important people in our lives while we work out our issues.

4113801,4,B003E697MY,"I found this story to be quite interesting; the plot moves along at a very slow, steady pace, allowing the viewers a chance to really get to know and understand the characters.  I've not read the book, and after watching the movie, think I must definitely add it to my want to read list.

The story is about rediscovering who you are, and how changes we make in our personal path can affect others.  I found each actor portrayed his role beautifully - I must add, I am not a Basinger fan, but thought she was wonderful in this part.  Greenwood did an excellent job, as always; he has such a command of his facial expressions and can voice so much with a single look.  The setting was beautiful, and the story about the mermaids quite sweet.  A very touching film.",1398384000,3,763,4.375886524822695
4113802,2,B003E697MY,Pace of film was very slow. Storyline was very predictable and didn't 't interest me much. Scenery was very nice.,1398297600,,113,4.7
4113803,1,B003E697MY,This is the type of film reserved for an afternoon viewing. Nothing else. Flat characters with such a simple story I'm surprised they held their awareness level in check. Lacked plausibility.,1398211200,,191,5.193548387096774
4113804,4,B003E697MY,I enjoyed watching this movie.  The story and characters were good.  Acting of the main character was not the best but did not really detract from the story.,1398124800,,157,4.571428571428571
4113805,1,B003E697MY,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever decided to sit through. The only thing worth watching it for was Kim Basinger's strangely thick but frizzy hair. I half expected the Mermaid Chair (an actual chair in the movie) to turn people into mermaids. Had this been the case, I might have been entertained by the sheer volume of newly transformed mermaids flopping out of the chair and dying on the land. None of that happened. What do you want me to think? There are 50 shots of mermaids in the movie and not once are they ever found.  What we get is a trashy romance story about a monk who wants to bone Kim Basinger. He doesn't bone her because blah blah blah, the Mermaid Chair said it was wrong. Kim Basinger narrates the entire movie because the director/writer couldn't decide how to portray things visually or do what he's paid to do.

+Great pelican b-roll clearly purchased from someone with a home video camera.
+Tons of mediocre standard definition mermaid side boob.

-Not Splash.
-Kim Basinger talks through the whole thing.",1398124800,,1037,4.625

4113808,4,B003E697MY,This was a touchingly sad movie about a girls lifetime fascination with a mermaid chair located in a monastery. How she deals with the heartache of old love and new love.,1398038400,,170,4.516129032258065
4113809,2,B003E697MY,"The acting in this movie was very stiff, the character development was poor. I was disappointed in this movie. I had higher hopes when I saw Kim Basinger was in the movie. Frankly, I didn't even finish watching it.",1397952000,,214,4.512820512820513

For a ""memoir"" a story like this could hardly be likely, and raised as a Catholic, I couldn't be more disgusted by the plot. I don't feel that what religion you are even matters: you'd be scratching your head and wondering how you can get that 2 hours of your life back.",1397952000,,407,4.368421052631579
4113812,2,B003E697MY,I thought it was mundane and very slow paced. Lacked character development. Narrated by central character in place of acting out a movie. No real build up with a lack-luster ending.,1397865600,,181,4.870967741935484

4113814,2,B003E697MY,Being raised Catholic I didn't care for the story. Certainly a man studying to be a monk would not engage in an adulterous relationship. Likewise the woman involved had no reason to betray her husband who was loving and good to her.,1397779200,,232,4.5476190476190474

4113818,5,B003E697MY,I like Kim Bassinger. The show had clean language and portrayed the struggles of midlife and hidden blame that plagues many people at that age. All the characters were well developed and the storyline kept you wondering how it would end well. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to my friends.,1396656000,4,293,4.653846153846154

4113824,2,B003E697MY,Being a writer and having studied writing for many years I found the characters unbelievable and everything so contrived in this movie.  One of the first rules of writing is to create characters people care about - I didn't care about any of them except perhaps the Kim Bassinger one and that may be because she is so beautiful.  I find it hard to believe that ANY stranger would have full out sex the first time she is alone with someone - add to that the fact that she is married and he is a monk - it just isn't plausible to me.,1395273600,,531,4.145631067961165

So I went ahead and purchased it through amazon.com.  At first I wondered if I could get past the Kim Basinger effect - I did not picture Jesse at all like that in my mental image - but Basinger plays the character very convincingly.  The other actors carried out the book's characters quite well, also.  I was re-reading the book as I watched parts of the movie, and both meshed together well.  While I'm still not sure Jesse needed a love interest to fulfill her quest for self-identity, I'm betting the Sue Monk Kidd's publisher urged her to include it.",1395100800,,722,4.350746268656716

While the movie does a better job -for me at least - in clarifying the point of the story. I still have trouble seeing the 'spiritual' elements that I've read are at the soul of the story. Some elements, the main character's mother's story line, is disturbing to me as a Christian. I can't find my way past the elements of self-mutilation and euthanasia to even begin to understand what is going on there. I've ponder the book since reading it to get past that, and just can't.
