I can only hope that it was stopped because of publicity. I live in a small southern town where hundreds of illegals were rounded up and separated from their families, many of them had small children. It is really a shameful disgrace, the way these people are treated. This DVD is very informative concerning immigration.",1267660800,2,477,4.829268292682927
