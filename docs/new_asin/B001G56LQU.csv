8608590,5,B001G56LQU,"Talk Sex, in both versions, is one of the best movies of its type I've seen.  The script is well written and the actors are well cast.  Kelli McCarty and Bobby Johnston are both excellent in their respective roles.  I enjoy the twist of two talk show hosts with opposite views on current morality.  The dialogue moves the action rather than just filling in space.  The only thing I missed was seeing more of Renee Rea who is wonderfully cast as a shy assistant.  The unrated version doesn't show us more of her terrific body.  The movie is clever and worth seeing.",1288483200,4,564,4.470588235294118
