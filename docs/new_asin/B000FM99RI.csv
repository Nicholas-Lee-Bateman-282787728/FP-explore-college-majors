She shows how to safely do each move, and exercises to strengthen your body for floorwork. There are not many videos that feature this exclusively, and I highly recommend it! Anaheed is funny, and clear in her instruction, and she adds a performance that is so lively and beautiful and expressive! Awesome video!",1516838400,,475,4.8765432098765435
8124701,5,B000FM99RI,"This is essential for anyone learning floor work.  Anaheed emphasizes safety through the DVD.  I especially liked the warm up segment, it would be a good addition for anyone wanting to increase strength and flexibility.  She also touches on the history of floor work  with some interesting performance clips.

She demonstrates more then one way to descend to the floor and come back up which for me was a big plus!  And she demystifies classical floor work movements, including how to perform a safe Turkish drop. The video is shot from different angles so you can see how each move will look from the front, the side and the back. Anaheed's instructions are clear and concise as she demonstrates a wide variety of moves that can be executed during a floor work routine.  The DVD ends with performance that is outstanding and inspiring!",1365292800,,836,4.804195804195804
8124702,5,B000FM99RI,"This is a comprehensive video for learning floor work. Anaheed covers ascents, descents, and everything in between. I have been doing floor work for about 2 years in my advanced dance class, and I still find this video to be useful. The production quality is good. You can clearly hear and see Anaheed and although there are no mirrors, she will turn her body so you can see her from different angles.

Anaheed is a great instructor. She speaks slowly and clearly. She has carefully thought out what to say before saying it so there aren't any awkward moments, contradictions, ummmms, etc. The video is perhaps a bit dated in terms of costuming, hair, etc but that's only superficial. The content is really very good. I highly recommend it for any dancer who wants to learn floorwork or expand and perfect an existing floor work repertoire.",1327536000,4,840,4.7534246575342465
