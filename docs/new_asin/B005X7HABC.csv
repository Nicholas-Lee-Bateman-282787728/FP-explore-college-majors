4902409,5,B005X7HABC,"Episodes from three different ""classic"" 1980's toons for a fantastic price?  Whether or not you're a fan of all three of the shows included in this set, it offers a nice glimpse into an era that has long past.  I've managed to catch showings of Heathcliff in recent months, but I haven't seen The Littles or Get Along Gang in years.  Fans of cartoons and people young-at-heart should enjoy this collection.

8488377,4,B005X7HABC,"I bought this because I loved Heathcliff and the Get Along Gang as a kid. This collection has (if I remember correctly) at least 10 episodes of each show. The Heathcliff episodes look great, and are just as fun as I remember. The Get Along Gang's episodes (so far) are not as good of quality. They look to be copied from either VHS or possibly film. The picture is somewhat washed out and the audio sounds like a VHS transfer. However, they are definitely still watchable! It kind-of adds to the retro charm, having it be presented that way!

I have not watched any episodes of The Littles...because I HATED The Littles, and still do! It was a horrible show!! But, 2 out of 3 isn't bad! I would have liked to see them put Shirt Tales or something else on there instead. But, I doubt Hanna Barbara would have allowed that!

Minus one star for The Littles...and the somewhat poor quality of The Get Along Gang.",1458604800,,908,4.431137724550898

8488381,3,B005X7HABC,"Nice to see my girls enjoying cartoons that I watched as a child. Unfortunately, the Heathcliff DVD was mislabeled and was a 2nd copy of The Get a Long Gang. I paid less than $6 for this dvd, so won't worry about it. Hopefully my situation was isolated.",1433548800,,253,4.291666666666667

8488383,4,B005X7HABC,"I was the biggest Get Along Gang fan as a child, so the nostalgic quality was not lost on this DVD. However, I failed to realize that picture quality in the 80's was not what it is today and this set is not enhanced or restored at all. In other words, the picture quality is pretty poor. All in all, a fun find and had enjoyable stroll down memory lane!",1416528000,,353,4.057142857142857
