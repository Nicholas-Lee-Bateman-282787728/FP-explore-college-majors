1013062,5,6305368201,"......and this movie is a great example of that. I met my husband through electronic mail and can vouch for the sweetness and romantic qualities of You've Got Mail. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are charming and endearing in this  movie. It's also wonderful that they both have more scenes together than in  the other five-star movie, Sleepless in Seattle. This is a  light-hearted,romantic comedy that should be viewed by all.",921974400,,420,4.887323943661972
1013063,5,6305368201,"Leave it up to Nora Ephron to leave us hanging, again, crying for more. Like ""Sleepless In Seattle,"" this movie, too, begs for a sequel. And, although many have said that ""You've Got Mail"" was  supposedly the sequel to ""Seattle,"" the two films really have  little in common.
I found the movie to be a little slow in the  beginning, but by mid-stream, I was fully involved. Hanks and Ryan give  they're usual state-of-the-art performances. In fact, these days, it would  seem they both could give lessons to their peers on the fine art of chosing  great scripts.
Is this a great love story? Sure, but don't expect any  sparks to fly until half-way throught the movie - that's when Hanks  discovers that Ryan's character is his computer pen pal. It's not till the  very end of the movie (literally) that Ryan discovers the same about Hanks.
Like ""Seattle,"" I would have appreciated it if Ephron would  have given us just a few minutes extra at the end of the film to give us a  small climps into what the future might hold for the two characters. Even a  ""Why didn't you tell me who you were sooner?"" from Ryan's  character at the end would have been nice. But, hey, that's what keeps us  coming back for more. Right?
Another great ""date movie"" from  the master. Thanks, Nora.",921369600,,1274,4.526315789473684

It was too long from beg to middle and then too short when they started building up a relationship to the end.  I didn't feel a ""love"" connection with them.  More like a brother and sister.  I didn't like his living with a woman while both unmarried AND emailing a second woman.  spoiler:  I didn't like that she wrote him a real nice email right after he 'stood her up' and on top of that she accepted another inane excuse.

1015302,4,6305368201,"Well, the movie is fantastic, of course. That's why I purchased this--I finally decided to upgrade the 17 year old DVD of one of my absolute favorite movies. The transfer is good...picture is very crisp though audio (dialogue) can sometimes be a bit on the soft side. However, the advertised bonus DVD with Shop Around the Corner & other extras was not in my package. It was listed as a feature on the back of the case, but there was not even a spot for it inside the case! Disappointing, but still worth the price for the HD version of the movie alone.",1476835200,5,553,4.378640776699029

1015343,3,6305368201,"As a marriage counselor, this movie is difficult to watch. Each of the people is involved in an existing relationship, when they start this one online.  Unfortunately, I get way too much business from situations like this.  Do you want to have an affair?  Because this is how you have an affair.

People ask, ""Is it really an affair?"". The answer is, ""Yes, if you are doing something you can't tell your partner about, it's an affair.""

So, as far as the movie goes, I love Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.  They were good in Sleepless in Seattle (But Meg was cheating on her boyfriend then too).  Its a nice romance.  It's a sweet movie. It's just upsetting b/c the movie glamorizes this online relationship and I've just seen so much destruction from people doing exactly this.  If you have things you want to discuss, share, etc, do it with your partner if at all possible.  Avoid affairs b/c much of the time, MOST of the time, they don't turn out well.",1475971200,2,948,4.459302325581396

1015502,5,6305368201,"This is one of my very favorite movies. It's charming with witty dialogue and, of course, the lovely chemistry of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. The supporting cast is also pitch perfect. The sound track is an integral part of the movie because it is lilting, funny and cheerful and thus contributes to making the movie a bittersweet fable. It's a modern remake of  the oft told ""Shop Around the Corner"" and it gets the reality of business right. I'm in business and understand that the big bad chain will gobble up the small retail store next door that can't compete. Customers will complain that they are losing their favorite store even as they patronize the corporate giant for better prices and more variety. A romantic comedy, however, requires a happy ending, however, and this one delivers with a love story, the internet and a golden retriever.",1475280000,3,846,4.755102040816326

Better men and woman than I will speak of the story and quality of this RomCom, so I will leave them to it.

Frightful and apparently unaware of the magic that is Amazon and the internet, management sought me out for a solution. I demanded back ""Why seek out this treasure, store by store, when I can guarantee a copy next day. Not just a ho hum dvd copy, a Blu Ray copy. Picture quality, of which, shall be murmured upon their lips as the movie ends and they leave.""

Ok, I'm a sap, but I love the ending, and it never fails to get me.

It sets a tone for a pleasant evening and Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in a syrupy sweet love story is one that is a classic to me and my wife.  We watch it periodically as it might be totally unrealistic, it is sweet and and a great movie to sit on the couch with your significant other and watch a story of a love develop under circumstances that are a bit absurd but just plain good fun in a world where people are far more decent than what the evening news shows us they are.  So in this category You've got mail is a top 5 for me and my wife and I'm sure our DVD will be watch about once a year for many years to come.

1020481,5,6305368201,"Twenty-one years later, Nora Ephron's romantic comedy, ""You've Got Mail,"" is both outdated and cutting edge.  A remake of Ernst Lubitsch's 1940, ""The Shop Around the Corner,"" the film is the story of a big-box book store (owned by Tom Hanks) that moves into NYC's upper west side and threatens to gobble up Meg Ryan's small independent bookstore, (ironically called ""The Shop Around The Corner"").  Ryan and Hanks are bitter competitors, who believe they do not like each other, not knowing that they have fallen in love while exchanging pseudonymous emails.

The film is enchanting (although the days when the receipt of email was cause for excitement is a far distant memory).

The story of coffee-selling, bookstore-monoliths slowly destroying the small, neighborhood bookstore is a parable of the last twenty years.  There is hope, however, for those who love printed books. Change is coming.  America's love affair with the monolithic bookstore is waning.  Although the growth of the ebook has been blamed for this waning, that conclusion does not explain the growing comeback of independent bookstores .  It is this come back that changes ""You've Got Mail"" from an outdated romantic film to one that is both current and exciting.  America is once again warming up to the printed book and to independent booksellers.  Perhaps in a sequel to this film, Meg Ryan will reopen her charming, independent bookstore and buy up Tom Hanks's failing giant.",1463616000,3,1450,5.1059322033898304

1021003,5,6305368201,"I watched this years ago and I liked it and I decided to spend a rainy Saturday evening watching it again and this time around I loved it. I laughed and cried and cheered at the end. This is one of the all time most romantic movies, I think. It might be the most romantic movie from the 1990s. Even though much of the internet references are way out of date now, it still is understandable, I think by younger generations who have not heard the dial up sound or had only text based email. I never had AOL so I never heard ""You've got mail"" but I can still understand the concept of the excitement the characters felt hearing that. A lovely movie with no gratuitous sex scenes or violence, very sweet and yet realistic to how real life can be.

1022248,5,6305368201,"Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Do we need to know anything more?  I saw this movie when it came out in theaters in the 90s.  It was a wonderful little love story then and time hasn't diminished it one bit. In fact, the passage of time has made this movie even more endearing.  We hear the sounds of their modems connecting to their dial-up AOL accounts.  And there's irony in the fact that a book ""superstore"" is threatening Meg's little mom and pop bookstore.  Who knew that just a few years later the huge book Superstore would, in turn, be put out of business by Amazon?  This is a great diversion for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon - even if you've already seen it.  Enjoy it again.",1462406400,3,679,4.299212598425197

1022378,4,6305368201,"With the exception of the dial-up internet connections, this is a timeless film done in a classic cinematographic style. New York is the perfect setting for the apartments, the bookstores, and the cafes that the characters inhabit. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are at their most darling in this film, which even features a small role for Jean Stapleton. Parker Posey, Greg Kinnear, and Dave Chappelle are great in other supporting roles. If you just want to feel good and remember the magic of Nora Ephron watch You've Got Mail.

I gave the film four stars instead of five because I think the handling of the situation by Joe, Tom Hanks character, who is in on the secret much earlier than Kathleen, played by Meg Ryan, is too drawn out and sexist. While it is his insecurities and a mutual business conflict that prevent him from identifying himself sooner, Joe becomes uncomfortably manipulative in my opinion, but is redeemed by his authenticity throughout, especially in the end.",1462320000,,977,4.850299401197605

1024022,3,6305368201,"A charming Hanks and Ryan rom-com. Both have had better films, of course, but there is no denying their chemistry here. Few films are as reliant on the technology of the time to create the circumstances of the romance, and here the film both succeeds and fails. The time when AOL text chat rooms was a dominant social force was brief, and the plot relies entirely on the fact that the only communication between them was by anonymous emails, and these are limited to their access to their respective home computers every night. When social media today is rife with photo and video public profiles, it is quaint to consider that the ""boy meets girl"" here is predicated on the fact that they are unaware that the two are business rivals who unknowingly encounter one another on a daily basis. Understanding this may cause giggles among younger folk who may lump this pre-smartphone ""age"" with ""the olden days"", so their relating to the circumstances fundamental to the plot may be difficult. Technology moved on from the circumstances of this film, but it remains charmingly diverting. Enjoy it for what it is, and at the very least, it can help a younger audience understand the time when technology began to fundamentaly change our social interactions, including ""boy meets girl"".",1461628800,2,1280,4.876146788990826

Riiight. So ultra-fantastically unreal its pathetic. Once she comes to her senses about his complete, callous and total abuse of her and her good life, he's history...just like his Dad and his many shallow relationships.

1025468,5,6305368201,"Makes no sense that I would give this movie 5 stars since it's essentially 2 people cheating (if it's on the down low, it's cheating) on their significant other with each other via the internet. With that and the blatant editing errors, I should give it a 2 star rating.

It also makes no sense that I would adore a story about a Big Box Bookstore evil that threatens the existence of a small independent bookstore, but Hollywood has a way of making you forgive and forget.

What can I say? I love the writing, the actors and the chemistry between Tom and Meg (obviously my close friends).  I LOVE the shallow Parker Posey, Greg Kinnear and Dabney Coleman characters.  It wasn't a standout performance by Jean Stapleton as the motherly ""Shop Around the Corner"" bookkeeper nor any of the rest of the filler cast.

I don't know how to explain it.  It's just a nice story of boy meets girl, boy gets girl ""or visa versa"".",1461024000,2,918,4.467065868263473

Nora ephron, the upper west side's nancy meyers but with lousier scripts and much lousier set decorators, and her sister delia, are the culprits.  This is a world (yes it's all in the rotten script) where the zabar's cashiers are hostile latinas, where women are referred to as dogs or b....es ( until of course you realize the woman is twinkly meg ryan), where characters combating evil corporate empires buy their coffee at starbucks, where characters ask if sneaking out of bed w significant others to surreptitiously type love notes to strangers is cheating ( in terms of these two cretinous chatacters, uh, yes), where blacks are s fetchit sidekicks, gays don't exist, where your father's latest wife feels you up while a child sings Tomorrow.

This film makes you hate everything about the UWS.

And if all that's not enough, another totally unrelated to plot music supervised soundtrack from a nora ephron film, supposedly charming.  No it's calculated and Vomitous.

That violins songing sequence would force any group of families or friends to massacre each other.

Please please pass this up infavor of the delicate luminous brilliant The Shop Around The Corner w Stewart and Sullivan, a completely sublime film.

The two stars given here are for jean stapleton, sara ramirez (even with the latina stereotype she makes an impact, parker posey, and the two stars esp hanks who delivers in you're nothing but a suit scene.

It has some good dialogues and funny scenes. Some critics will say, that this movie could be more artistic or have some more elaborate dialogues, and it is also true. But there are magic in simplicity, and if you find yourself in a day, where you just want to relax, feel good, believe that true love exits and can be found when less we expect it, this is the movie for you.

They share an on-line relationship, first as friends, then hoping to meet with possible romance in mind. But the two are competitors in the book-selling business, Kathleen owner of  an inherited small and quaint lovely shop of children's literature, Joe building a superstore with books, coffee bar,lounge area...and impersonal, discounted lack of charm. Joe can put Kathleen out of business. Clever dialogue. The scenery and the interiors of this film are wonderful, set in NYC.How the two reconcile and become friends is revealed after  most of the film is over.

to Amazon. Com)  I looked at it  and it is still as wonderful and delighting as ever.  Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan should
have played in more movies  I think they are a natural couple to play together in any movie of this kind. Secondly, I purchased ""Sleepless in Seattle"" also (in spite of the fact that I had watched it on TV  many, many times  It was
still as wonderful and delightful as ever.  I absolutely, love, love, loved it

My husband had the nerve to remind me  (LOL) OR SHOULD I SAY HE PUT IT LIKE THIS and I quote ""I thought you
already seen that movie""  and to quote my reply, LOL) and I will continue to see it many, many, many more times

Thank you Amazon for your promptness, lovely packaging, and friendly service  I look forward to purchasing many more
DVD's,  especially enjoy the Classics  The 4- PACK  I ordered in December starring Bette Davis, with ""Now Voyager,
Dark Victory, Old Acquaintance and Jezebel"" was another Block Buster, all 4 were over the top  I received  Liam Neeson's
Taken 2.  I did not enjoy it as much as  I did ""Taken"". the quality of the color was horribly dark and a lot of the picture
was too dark to see what in the world was  going on  Another thing, I got really bored with all the car crashing, a lot
of it was utterly ridiculous.  The best part of Taken 2 was the END,  KNOWING THAT THEY WERE ALL BACK TOGETHER  can only hope that Taken 3 will be a lot better.

Thanks again.
Would order more classic movies  but  thinkvvthey are too expensive for such old, old movies.

1028196,5,6305368201,"Sleepless in Seattle director Nora Ephron originally made a name for herself as the writer of romantic comedies such as Heartburn and When Harry Met Sally. She continues the genre with You've Got Mail, marking her second collaboration with actors Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. The story brings romance and courtship into the electronic age of the World Wide Web via e-mail and chat rooms. The film is about two letter-writing lovers who are completely unaware that their sweetheart is in fact the person with whom they share a certain degree of animosity. An adaptation of Parfumerie was previously made as The Shop Around the Corner, a 1940 film by Ernst Lubitsch and also a 1949 musical remake, In the Good Old Summertime by Robert Z. Leonard starring Judy Garland. You've Got Mail updates that concept with the use of e-mail. Influences from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice can also be seen in the relationship between Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly  a reference pointed out by these characters actually discussing Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet in the film.

Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly live and work blocks from each other on New York City's Upper West Side. Their lives are practically intertwined. They both shop at the same place, frequent the same coffee shop, and even own competing bookstores on the same street. They also both have significant others of their own. Joe has the overly hyper book editor Patricia Eden, while Kathleen lives with the scholarly newspaper columnist Frank Navasky. Then they meet in a chat room. Though they keep their identities secret as they're known only by screen names ""NY152"" and ""Shopgirl"", they tell each other everything about their lives, including their private feelings, which slowly turn into affection for each other. When Joe decides to open a new branch of his ""Foxbooks"" chain that risks putting Kathleen's ""Shop Around the Corner"" out of business, the tension between them escalates. Surely her boutique business will be lost to the conglomerate with a built-in newsstand and coffee bar. When Joe sees Kathleen waiting for him in the restaurant where they agreed to meet up, he puts two and two together, but cannot face her, given their agreement not to reveal each others' names and professions. How can he reveal himself to her now, knowing that he is the cause of her misery? Hopefully, love will conquer all.

It is a love story destined to be remembered as one of the best of the decade. Tom Hanks,Meg Ryan and America Online certainly are popular trademarks in the 90's. Chemistry between the leads were truly outstanding after they have previously worked with director Nora Ephron from another movie in the past. It has great humor and witty lines. Also,it was interesting as we get a glimpse of what romance will be in the digital world in the years to come. Although it is not a classic nor a masterpiece,it is still a must-see for people who love good romantic stories.",1419638400,,2924,4.855711422845691

We have a Bluray player so I thought ""why not?"" and got it on Bluray. Bluray movies are typically best when they are filmed in high-definition vs. standard definition film being up-scaled.

In the case of ""You've Got Mail"", the Bluray conversion was just terrible. The picture is grainy and coarse which may be intentional but it looks older than the original. The audio was poorly upscaled as well, parts of the movie sounded like they were recorded through a wall.

I would recommend just purchasing this movie in the origins DVD format to spare yourself from the poor conversion. Hopefully they could fix this at some point and release a good Bluray version but I doubt they will.",1417305600,2,736,4.603053435114504

1028526,4,6305368201,"Joe Fox (Email to Shopgirl) ""Don't you love New York in the fall? It makes me want to buy school supplies. I would send you a bouquet of newly-sharpened pencils if I knew your name and address. On the other hand, this not knowing has its charms."" Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) owns a bookstore, named ""Shop Around the Corner"". She is carrying on a correspondence with a mutual admirer (Tom Hanks) without either knowing who the other is. They don't know who they're corresponding with, but they actually know and dislike each other. Does that plot sound familiar to you. It should if you're a movie buff. This is the third theatrical adaptation - all of them excellent movies - of a 1937 stageplay, called ""Parfumerie"". The first adaptation, produced in 1940, was titled ""Shop Around the Corner"" and starred Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan; the second, produced in 1949, was titled, ""In the Good Old Summertime"" and starred Judy Garland and Van Johnson. Of course the correspondence in the first two movies was the snail-mail variety, as they were produced before the days of email. It's difficult to say which one is the best, as they all have their strengths. If I had to pick a favorite it would be the original, ""Shop Around the Corner"" because of Jimmy Stewart and director, Ernst Lubitsch; but I could argue for ""In the Good Old Summertime"" too, because of Judy Garland. ""You've Got Mail"" probably has the best couple in Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks...this was their third film together; and Nora Ephron works her magic behind the camera and in the script. My recommendation is that you watch all three; and as an added incentive, all three are set during the Christmas season; so they are great to watch during this time of year.",1416528000,,1730,4.694078947368421

1028914,2,6305368201,"Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan prove three's far from a charm in this limp, flat, by-the-numbers romantic comedy, their third (and last) such collaboration. Ryan plays the owner of a small children's bookstore who, when her shop comes under fire from a big-box retailer around the corner, finds solace in the advice of an anonymous e-mail buddy. Spoiler alert, said buddy turns out to be the billionaire owner of said retailer (Hanks), and the two dance around like marionettes with a sliced string or two for the next two hours, narrowly avoiding each other's identities while gnashing teeth and slinging mud in the press. It's an irritating story, filled with irritating people doing irritating things. Hanks and Ryan are locked in on cruise control, looking down their noses at the material (and, perhaps, at the doofs who actually make such online connections), and enjoy none of the easy chemistry and warm charm they enjoyed in Joe Versus the Volcano or, to a lesser extent, Sleepless in Seattle. The '90s mascara is caked on thick, too, with eye-rolling mainstream rock soundtrack choices, cookie cutter casting stereotypes and an era-typical Hollywood take on all things cyber.

I felt the James Stewart Little Shop Around the Corner was a bit over-rated including the Lubitsch tough part.  I'd seen that movie several times.  This is a remake and in today's era it's even funnier since BOOKSTORES are going under like crazy in this digital world.  But when this movie first hit AOL was all the rage (believe it or not they still exist) and Crown Booksellers was stomping on the competition with discount books (Crown is no more, as is Dalton and a few other book store that served Starbucks).  She's a small bookstore owner and he's Mister Big, son of the HUGE chain store booksellers who puts her out of business (I guess in today's world he'd be the son of the man who started Amazon dot com) and they start an E-mail affair that turns into love and affection, despite the fact that hate each other in person!",1406937600,,1008,4.306878306878307

1029195,5,6305368201,"I'm sure that this film is in every way considered a ""chick flick"".  But it is still very good.  In the early days of e-mail and home computers, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are two New Yorkers who've never met in person but have formed an online relationship in which they can confide in one another while holding back personal facts that would give them away (i.e. real names.)  Using the screen names Shopgirl and NY152, they talk about various things, including the business competition they are both unknowingly involved in as Ryan owns a small bookstore and Hanks is part of a family which builds bookstore chains across the country.  While despising each other in person, these two unwitting souls continue to grow closer in cyberspace.  Okay, so apart from the fact that Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are great in just about everything they do, they indeed make an effort to be great in this film...and it shows.  ""You've Got Mail"", named for that iconic phrase from AOL, is a hit because of them.  But they can't have pulled this off alone.  So these two surround themselves with a set of well-chosen supporting cast members, all of whom give this film a spirit and make New York City and it's bookstores come alive on the big screen.  It's one thing to film in the Big Apple...it's another for that filming to come back and pay off big for you.  No iconic landmarks were needed to make this work...you just needed the spirit of New York City to show where these people lived and we got that 110%.  It's a great movie that is worth watching over and over again.  Enjoy.",1402876800,,1565,4.51063829787234

I'd ask for my money back, but it would cost more to return the movie to AMAZON, than what I paid for it initially. I will donate the movie to the local library.

I've probably seen it over again a dozen times, and always found new places to chuckle and find joy. This might be my favorite performance by Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks is tremendous (isn't he always?), and the supporting cast alone is worth the price of admission: Greg Kinnear was still something of an unknown then and was tremendous, and if you never saw the incomparable Jean Stapleton do anything other than Edith in ""All in the Family,"" you MUST watch this movie.

1029284,4,6305368201,"Great movie. But right off the bat I've got to take off one star for the fact that it's a bit formulaic in that it reunites Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. I'm sure some big wigs in Hollywood if they could would have had these two doing nothing but rehashing themselves in movies over and over again for ever if it was profitable enough.

Again a great movie despite the fact that it started off very slowly very improbably to start with. But towards the end it really picked up the pace and finished well. Some of my favorite parts were meg and tom discussing megs favorite book, pride and prejudice, especially the fault of being too prideful in a relationship. That's my favorite scene I think for a couple to connect on an emotional as well as intellectual level one should read ones partners favorite book or books. And by the way ladies if that reading material is the latest edition of sports illustrated you're in a doomed relationship get out while you still can. This scene demonstrates that a couple should also try out other things that you each like such as food, movies and music. One of my last girlfriends was a huge 'Prince,' fan. Now despite the fact that it didn't work out I routinely sing along when the radio plays 'raspberry beret, etc.' I'm a better man for having known her.

Best line in this movie for me is when Tom asks Meg why she hasn't run away with the man in her life and she says 'I don't actually know him.' Truly funny in my book. That scene was a neat trick in my book and fresh departure from the typical, quest after you're lover, plot so well traveled by Hollywood script writers.

Finally after watching this movie I wonder why 1/2 of American romance movies are set exclusively in NYC? Even Rick Blaine, Humphrey Bogart's character in my all time favorite romance movie Casablanca in originally from Brooklyn. Hey, wasn't Rhett Butler from NYC too? No...just kidding he was a southerner just seeing if you're up on you're romance movie trivia.",1400025600,3,1978,4.5195530726256985

""Michael"" is also one of my all-time favorite movies, which Ms. Ephron directed very nicely.  Unfortunately, ""You've Got Mail"" seems to have been intended to be a latter day ""Pride and Prejudice,"" which didn't work for me.  In the earlier story, Mr. Darcy is born into a noble class, and his terrible behavior is apparently ignorant prejudice from his class mentality.  Joe Fox, on the other hand, is born into a moneyed family, but his terrible behavior is intentional, the predatory business mentality: hurt whomever you like, because ""it's not personal.""  He does intentionally put Kathleen Kelly out of business, and as far as we know, continues with this professional behavior, while she falls in love with him.  I think it puts women in a bad light.  Both Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks deliver great performances, though.",1393286400,,939,4.89873417721519

1030337,1,6305368201,"Perhaps the makers of this film were counting on an audience that had never seen the original SHOP AROUND THE CORNER. Nora Ephron is a fine writer, but as a film director, she surely is no Lubitsch. Tom Hanks is always professional, but he's no Jimmy Stewart. As for the terminally cute and one-dimensional Meg Ryan, the less said the better. The film is embarassingly sentimental, shamelessly gushy, and so slow-paced that it leaves lots of time for trips to the fridge (or the bathroom). Another reviewer has said it makes him or her fantasize about going to New York. That person has plainly never been there, as the Big Apple in this movie has been horribly scrubbed, manicured, gaudied-up and soft-lensed--with all warts and wrinkles removed, like a commercial to sell the city, not a depiction of what's loveable about it. The film also has an offensively coarse anti-liberal undercurrent.",1389312000,4,895,4.933774834437086

1030354,4,6305368201,"""You've Got Mail"" is an older movie. Since it centers around the PC, you can easily see how dated it is as Fox Books is an analogy for Barnes and Nobles and they write to each other using AOL e-mail, both entities which cease to be the super powers they once were in the 90's.  But I love to see the city shots of NYC as they stroll through the upper West Side.  A city that is also changing, but really stays the same.  The story is simple, girl meets boy, but fun to watch.  The dialog is snappy and funny and the actors are wonderful in their delivery of them.  For me, it is an old stand by which I enjoy watching each time.",1389139200,,628,3.992

Well, while I enjoyed 'Sleepless,' I fell in love with 'You've Got Mail.'  It is a charming homage to the original film 'The Shop Around the Corner' (which I also recommend) but is completely modern.  Even now, so many years later, a film that features AOL dial-up still feels timeless.

And in this movie, the characters don't just make the best of it; they flourish. In this movie, change has its pros and cons, much like in reality.  And I can't resist Nora Ephron's witty humor.

The oddest part of this episode is when Meg Ryan's character breaks up with her live-in boyfriend.  It's a rather odd breakup, but it makes it funny.  The best part is when she says the line ""I wanted it to be you.  I wanted it to be you so bad!""  Brings you to tears!

His character and Meg Ryan's character meet in an online chat room and become good email friends without revealing their true identities, both having an emotional affair with each other outside of their current relationships. But there's an intense irony behind the scenes - Tom Hanks plays a senior executive at his family's mega bookstore company, while Meg Ryan plays the owner of a small, local children's book store. The mega bookstore moves in ""around the corner"" and puts Meg Ryan's store out of business, and despite their email friendship (which they don't realize is with one another) they are cutthroat adversaries when it comes to business. Although mentioned, the controversy of mega stores vs local family run businesses isn't really explored in this movie (that's not the point), but there's certainly enough material here to spark a conversation, if you're interested. The ending is typical, and you can see what's going to happen from a mile away. But, it's well acted and the humor comes from the irony behind the scenes in almost every scene.

1031010,4,6305368201,"OVERVIEW:  Co-written and directed by Nora Ephron, the 1998 romantic comedy Youve Got Mail was inspired by Mikls Lszls 1930s play Parfumerie, but also carries themes reminiscent of Jane Austens Pride and Prejudice.  Ephron gives the same general storyline an update; the anonymity of email brings users NY152 and Shopgirl together, but their real-life alter-egos, Joe and Kathleen, cant help but antagonize one another.  The films title is a play on the familiar-yet-disappearing new email notification heard by AOL users around the world.  Following their roles in Joe Versus the Volcano and the infamous Sleepless in Seattle, Youve Got Mail reunites the romantic chemistry between actors Tom Hanks and Meg Ryansecuring a box office success.  Critics, however, were slightly less thrilled; reception has been mostly positive, though general consensus says the movie didn't quite live up to its hype.

STARRING ROLES:  Meg Ryan as Kathleen Kelly aka Shopgirl, Tom Hanks as Joe Fox aka NY152, Jean Stapleton as Birdie Conrad, Parker Posey as Patricia Eden, Steve Zahn, as George Pappas, Greg Kinnear as Frank Navasky, Dave Chappelle as Kevin Jackson, and Heather Burns as Christina Plutzker.

SUMMARY:  Frank Navaskys an antagonizing left-wing columnist for the New York Observer is so committed to his work that he overlooks the needs of his girlfriend, Kathleen Kelly, owner of a small independent book store called The Shop Around The Corner.  After setting a few boundaries (no real names, occupations, specifics, etc.), Kathleen finds that, as Shopgirl, she can get all the attention she craves by exchanging emails with NY152known as Joe Fox in the non-virtual world.

Fox Books is a large commercial book retailer owned by the Fox family; Joe Fox is in charge of opening a new branch in Upper West Manhattan, for which Kevin Jackson will be the manager.  Because Joes father and grandfather remarried later in life, Joe has an eleven-year-old aunt named Annabel and a four-year-old half brother named Matthew; Joe takes Annabel and Matt to afternoon storytime at The Shop Around The Corner, but ends up striking coy and flirtatious conversation with Kathleen.  When Kathleen expresses her concerns about the new Fox Books set to open, Joe scrambles to end the conversation and flee the scene.

Despite Joes quick exit, his secret affiliation with Fox Books is exposed when he and Kathleen are guests at the same publishers party.  In fewer words, Kathleen vents about her situation to NY152, who in turn advises Shopgirl to take her fight to the media.  The news world quickly buzzes about the independent v. commercial bookstore war and the recent boycott of Fox Books.  Things seem to be looking up for Kathleen, especially because her online romantic interest, NY152, has finally requested to meet her in person.  When Joe discovers Shopgirls true identity, he buries his feelings and incites a confrontation with Kathleen about her business tactics; the argument becomes very pointed, signaling Joes abrupt exit.

Kathleen, still unaware that Joe is NY152, believes she has been stood up.  To make matters worse, The Shop Around The Corner fails to compete with Fox Books and closes its doors.  Kathleen makes a few personal reevaluations, and eventually decides to give the new bookstore a chance; slowly, she and Joe warm to one another, finding common ground through their respective recent breakups.

Meanwhile, Shopgirl and NY152 rekindle their online romance.  When they finally give meeting another shot, the tension couldn't be higher; both Kathleen and Joe have to face the fear that NY152s true identity might not be the one Kathleen is hoping for",1382832000,,3667,5.177966101694915

I feel so sorry for anyone that couldn't find a smile and warmth in this film. I have watched the Little Shop Around the Corner and find this retelling of that story refreshing, original in it's use of today's technology and today's social reality. This film is at worst pleasant and comforting and at best life affirming. How you may ask? nothing was blown up no one had to die not one drop of blood and a lot of love and the conflicts are the kind of inner personal dilemmas most all of us have or will face in life. I don't know Meg Ryan, maybe I wouldn't even like her, don't know. But I could and did fall in love with Kathleen Kelly. I like Ms. Ryan's ability to be the people she portrays and not herself portraying some one. Tom hanks as Joe Fox is the big brother I never had, the friend we all would enjoy being around, he has heart and soul with a great balance between humor and business savoy. the tension that Nora Ephron floats throughout the film is gentle but nudges at us to want resolution, the foreplay of thought vs action.

1031192,4,6305368201,"A Romcom classic, not without flaws.  I wrote some of this in response to a scathing review by ""M"" who thought the Kelly character infantile to the point of nausea, and faulted the movie on feminist grounds.  She lambasted Ryan (and Ephron) for Ryan's baby talk and a lot more.  This review contains spoilers.

One thing mentioned by M also annoyed me, Ryan's cringe-worthy boxing act, absurd, in her place of business no less.  But what bothered me more was the non-stop gratuitous music, so patently manipulative, a ""great"" song every two minutes- overkill, that in such large saccharine doses actually undermines the emotional punch of the movie.  And Ephron packing in every ""pearl of wisdom"" that ever occurred to her, SO painful (especially evident in the online chatting). And- isn't life something! Kids and balloons and face painting and goldfish and whiskers on kittens! And aren't these modern times, new technologies something! And WHAT about computers and email? (aren't they SOMETHING!?)  And- Starbucks- complicated coffee orders- aren't THEY something!  And New York- ain't the Big Apple something! There are too many of these excesses jammed into the movie to count or list- TOO MUCH. STOP trying to jerk my chain. How about a little subtlety, PLEASE.  I like to be snuck up on.  When contrivances like these are distractions, instead of  enhancing the plot, Houston, we've got a problem (BTW, if you want to see a MASTER of subtlety and seamlessness, watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-New-Leaf/dp/B007R2MJXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A New Leaf</a>, written, directed by & starring the incomparable Elaine May. And note that it has NO references that date it, could have been made yesterday).

I thought M and other critics were a LITTLE rough on Meg Ryan, though.  Kathleen Kelly owns a store making more than a quarter mill a year, it's fine if she has an accountant- she'd hardly be doing the books herself (critics slammed her for not knowing sales figures off the top of her head). Her specialty is children's books- so presumably she does the buying. She loves childlike things, knows children's books inside and out, decorates the store w/ stuffed animals, dresses like a princess and reads to the kids. She's not the most assertive of women, though tries to be, with Hanks's encouragement. She misses her mother. So she's a bit child-like, that's her character, so what?  Not every woman needs to be a powerhouse, does she? She's vulnerable, a little scared, I don't have a problem with that. Nor with her affecting Hanks, bringing out his nurturing side, humanizing him (though more could have been made of it, we could have seen more of an evolution of Fox from hard-nosed, cynical businessman as he falls in love, becomes ever more enchanted, softened by his penpal).  They improve each other, that's what good relationships do.  I think the premise was good, it was the execution that was flawed. I must admit, though, I LOVE the final scene, where Hanks comes over the rise. The look on Ryan's face is priceless.  That scene alone makes it all worthwhile.

As far as the criticism of Ryan behaving like a little girl, I found the way Ryan LOOKS more irritating than the way she behaves, re: being childish. Ephron went to great lengths to make her LOOK like a 4-year old, completely non-sexual, bizarre.  And yet, regarding sexual relationships, both she and Hanks blithely dump people they've been sleeping with without a second thought (shouldn't that have been handled with a little more finesse, thought?).  At any rate, there's a rather odd juxtaposition between Ryan's seeming naivete and innocence and man of the world lover Greg Kinnear.  It doesn't quite compute.  It might have served the story better if Ryan had been single, or perhaps only casually dating Kinnear.

In a nutshell I found Ephron's heavy-handed and painfully obvious writing/directing a bit hard to take (no SILKWOOD or MICHAEL), but generally I think Ryan did a good job within the slightly stereotypical confines of her character, and Tom Hanks did the splendid job he always does- the two charismatic leads manage to rescue the movie.  On feminist grounds I'd find more fault with sexist or stereotypical aspects of other characters- Joe Fox's father and grandfather, his lascivious step-mother.  And what's up with Parker Posey's character?  She's the only high-powered, successful woman in the film, but she's an utter loon- why?

But- Hanks and Ryan, two of my favorites, are sincere and winsome, their characters appealing, the chemistry between them palpable; best of all, the movie has a GREAT ending; and despite its shortcomings (the CLOYING music most of all), I watch it again and again (THE litmus test, after all)- despite its flaws, it richly deserves Romcom classic status, recommended!",1380844800,,4862,5.11378002528445

Besides the two hour movie, the deluxe edition has several bonus features:

Two new featurettes: Delivering You've Got Mail, You've Got Chemistry
Commentary by director-cowriter Nora Ephron and producer Lauren Shuler Donner
HBO First Look: A Conversation with Nora Ephron
Interactive map tour: Discovering New York's Upper West Side
Carole King music video: Anyone at All (also played during the ending credits)
Music-only audio track

The ""Delivering You've Got Mail"" feature is a discussion with the producer, director, and main stars of the movie.  The ""You've Got Chemistry"" feature is a look back at famous Hollywood screen pairings.  The Blu-ray version also has the bonus features.  I recommend getting the Deluxe edition DVD or Blu-ray that has the bonus features which are missing from the original released DVD back in 1999.

This movie is an updated remake of the ""Shop around the corner"" movie made back in 1940 with James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan concerning two people who are corresponding with each other not realizing the identity of the other person and that person is someone who they already know.  This updated version changes the storyline to replace the letter writing with email.  There is a change in the plot where in the original version, the two are coworkers, while in this version, they are business rivals.  The director also copies some of the scenes from the original movie and incorporates them into the newer movie version.  This is Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's third pairing since the earlier movies, ""Joe versus the Volcano"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"".  If you have seen either of their previous movies, you will also enjoy this one.  I slightly favor the original 1940 movie version a bit more, but this version is still a worthwhile movie to see.  If the romantic comedy genre is to your liking, this movie should fit the bill.",1374019200,,2169,5.35693215339233

1031708,4,6305368201,"Romantic Comedy is a genre that has really tapered off in the last decade or so.  The genre has become so dependent on sex, for both the romance and comedy, that watching such a sincere film as ""You've Got Mail"" makes you realize how sweet and funny movies of this type can be.

The film centers around Joe Fox (Tom Hanks), owner of a book superstore ""Fox Books"", and Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan), owner of a small mom and pop bookstore ""The Shop Around the Corner"".  Bitter business rivals by day but, unbeknownst to them, anonymous e-mail pen pals by night.  Naturally of course they fall in love with each other through the e-mails despite a strict ""no personal information"" pact.  The film uses this setup to use dramatic irony for many of the jokes but also for character development.

The key to romance in fiction, comedy or not, is to make it about characters and their relationships with each other.  The best romances (""When Harry Met Sally..."", ""The Notebook"", ""Whisper of the Heart"", and even pieces of ""Welcome to the NHK"") develop themselves around their characters.  But what this type of film needs more than anything but so rarely does is heart and to believe in its characters and events.  This is how ""You've Got Mail"" succeeds, it makes itself about the characters.  So while not a deep film, by doing that it allows itself to be sweet, funny, and believable.  Funny and romantic (what a movie in a genre called Romantic Comedy should be), ""You've Got Mail"" is such a nice little film that even us cynics at heart can't help but smile.",1373155200,,1552,4.607272727272727

1032377,5,6305368201,"This movie has long been a favourite. I love watching it even more now that I am married.
The basic concept is that two people in a similar work field end up becoming enemies, despite the fact they are perfect for one another. This rivalry is complicated by the fact that they are secretly friends and give words of encouragement and support through the Internet/email while they are struggling with the personal attacks that they are experiencing from one another. The culmination of their fight is one sides as Tom Hanks realises what is going on and despises that he needs to treat he with the love and affection he actually feels for her. He goes through this first suffering through her bitterness to win the heart of the woman he loves in person as he ha already done online. The climax of the movie is truly the end when all is about to be revealed. The moment he asks her for forgiveness and professes his love, before she realises he is the man that she fell in love with first online and then in person.",1361750400,,1013,4.451612903225806

It's a wonderful movie which begs to be re-visited if for no other reason than to visit Meg's lovely Shop Around the Corner (spoken from a true children's book lover). If you've never seen this movie you're missing out on great performances by both Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.(a bit of trivia here: in the scene when Joe asks George for help with an old book -- the book is Robinson Crusoe -- coincidence? I don't know any details but I wonder...was it chosen b/c it was a favorite book of Tom Hanks and many years later he does Castaway? Just food for thought. Back to the movie. The musical scores are also quite catchy. You can't go wrong. As Kathleen writes to Joe in one of her emails as she is referring to ""Pride and Prejudice""  ""Read it you'll love it.""

Many strong minded women think Meg Ryan shows weakness by fionally fallling in love with the man that took her buisness away, however I think it shows the oposite and shows what a great deal of strenght she has through the power of forgiveness and Love. Tom Hanks humbleness of mind when he realizes how he affects her while she is waiting for the man she has been talking to is really amamzing. How he sets his mind to determination after falling in love with her online through their communication especailly after the cafe ordeal and how he reacts afterwards is just wonderful.

It is ironic that the iconic Fox Books of the movie - the big-box book retailer - kills off Meg Ryan's small bookstore.  If a sequel were made Fox Books would itself be killed off by Amazon.com in association with small used bookstores.  Maybe Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks can be brought back to do the deed.

1032647,3,6305368201,"For the past decade, I have watched this enjoyable film so many times that I have never figured out why I really liked this movie until now. I usually put off writing a review for any film until I know for sure why I like it or why I don't like it.

Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are wonderful and talented actors, no doubts about that, and I have always respected their works. In this film, as entitled ""You've Got Mail,"" a romantic comedy set in New York city and revealed the lifestyle there, which is, for most part, true and a good portrayal. The film's plot focuses on Kathleen and Joe as they narrate their correspondences with each other in the beginning of the film, and then goes on to focus on them individual-based throughout. They never truly meet each other as they have online until the end of the film, which seems to be typical.

I've always been a fan of books, and the idea of bookstores in a film always intrigued me as it's my dream to work in a bookstore and to work like what Kathleen did for her little bookshop and to be of service to the community and to be somewhat an important storyteller for the children. And, the idea of working in the Big Apple and at a small bookstore began to enchant my feelings, and this film seemed to have stirred that feelings in me to which made this film to be my favorite and I've always enjoyed watching it.

So, that's what I liked about the movie and that's what really fueled my navet.

After watching this film a number of times recently, I found myself in shock of what I really ""saw."" Firstly, the big bad Fox super bookstore represents a chain store that made sure that there are no competitions and no other stores that would undermine its profit, including Kathleen's little bookshop. It succeeded. Fox Bookstore became a dominant bookstore in the area. Secondly, after Joe discovered who the girl that he was talking to online for a whole was, he withheld that truth from Kathleen herself and throughout the film, she became unaware of Joe's true identity (twice!) while he was talking to her and playing on her good side until the end when she became enchanted to his good charms. Essentially, they got together. In other words, Joe the Manipulator got what he wanted: the ending of Kathleen's bookstore and Kathleen herself. He have achieved two main narcissistic goals: striving of his business and the hopeless girl, while Kathleen lost two most important things that she held dear: her mother's legacy and her dreams.

If one breaks the actions of the characters down to the basics, one would see how one action would destroy a person's sense of security, safety, and dreams. I suddenly found myself wondering what lesson this film is teaching us. Is it that one dream being more important than the other? Does that give one the right to destroy others' dreams through manipulative tactics and lying? Business is more important than the personal? This aspect of the entire film is what has saddened me to no end.

Nevertheless, I believe both Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan did a wonderful job with their portrayals for this film, but the plot and story, I now didn't feel all that conformable with, and that realization has led me to give this film a three-star.",1356307200,2,3224,4.5595854922279795

By having all their interaction done via email and later casual meetings, the story is allowed to build up to the point where only one actual love scene is necessary. As usual, they've been provided with an excellent supporting cast, each having their own story, and a charming story line.

I used to have a coworker who loved it as much as me and we would banter around some of the lines as we passed by each other's desks at work!  What a fun movie!  Sadly, when I moved two years ago, I decided I had watched it enough and donated my copy to the library.  Recently when I learned the news that Nora Ephron had passed away, I wanted to watch the bonus features of the original DVD again to hear her talk about the Upper West Side one more time. I regretted giving my copy away. Moving sometimes makes one do really silly things!  When I went to buy a new copy and learned there was a new Deluxe Edition, I bought that instead, thinking it would be even better!  I was wrong.  The Bonus Feature on the Deluxe Edition is not very good and the discussion of the movie between Tom Hanks, Nora Ephron, and Meg Ryan leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion.  It does have a good feature called, ""You've Got Charisma"" which talks about other screen characters from the 40s and 50s who have on screen charisma.

1033069,4,6305368201,"1998.  It was a time when more and more people would be using the Internet, a time when a lot of news showcased people who found love on the Internet.

Having enjoyed ""The Shop Around the Corner"" (which was an adaptation of the 1937 Miklos Laszlo Hungarian play ""Parfumerie"") and the Broadway musical adaptation, ""She Loves Me"",  writer/director Nora Ephron and producer Laura Schuler Donner wanted to create a modernized version featuring a romantic comedy centered around love found on the Internet but yet using elements from Ernst Lubitsch's 1940 romantic comedy"".

And having struck gold with romantic comedies that starred actress Meg Ryan in ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""When Harry Met Sally"" and the amazing chemistry between Ryan and Tom Hanks in the 1993 film ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and the 1990 film ""Joe Versus the Volcano"", the filmmaker would reunite the two talents for her 1998 romantic comedy ""You've Got Mail"".

The film which can be seen as a sign of the times as it utilized then-popular Internet provider American Online (AOL) and it's popular trademark e-mail greeting ""You've Got Mail"", ""You've Got Mail"" would become a major hit in the box office as the $65 million film would earn over $250 million in the box office and would go on to also achieve success in the home video market.

And now both the original Ernst Lubitsch 1940 film ""The Shop Around the Corner"" via DVD and ""You've Got Mail""  (via Blu-ray) was released together in January 2012.

VIDEO:

""You've Got Mail"" is presented in 1080p (1:85:1 aspect ratio) and unfortunately it is a film that slightly shows its age, yet there is enough detail and better colors that makes this version much better than the previous DVD releases.

First the bad.  There are some moments where the film looks oversaturated and also soft and there are moments where you do see artifacts popping up once in a while.  While it shows up a few times, most people will probably not be bothered by it.  But for those expecting a pristine version of the film, it does have its issues which can be seen on a larger monitor/screen.

With that being said, the film still looks better than its previous DVD counterparts.  The colors tend to pop much more, you can see the skin pores on Tom Hanks' face during closeups and while some areas look its age, some don't and look very good.  So, for the most part, this is the best looking version of the film thus far.  It may not be the pristine picture quality that I was hoping for, but nevertheless, it does look much better than the DVD version.

As for ""The Shop Around the Corner"", the film looks absolutely wonderful considering it is a 71-year-old film.  The contrast levels are good, the film source looks very good for its age and I didn't detect any major problems with video quality at all.  Grays and whites are well-contrast, black levels are nice and deep and for the most part, the presentation of ""The Shop Around the Corner"" looks good on DVD.  Too bad, this classic film it was not converted to a Blu-ray release.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""You've Got Mail"" is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, Dolby Digital Francois and Espanol 2.0 stereo.

For this romantic comedy and like most films of the genre, most of the lossless soundtracks tend to be center and  front-channel driven with mild use of surround channels for ambiance.  The same can be said about ""You've Got Mail"".  Primarily, everything is center and front channel-driven and dialogue and it's musical soundtrack is crystal clear.

As for ""The Shop Around the Corner"", the film's dialogue is also clear and didn't notice any more hiss or crackling during my viewing of the DVD.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Francois and Espanol.

SPECIAL FEATURES

EXTRAS:

""You've Got Mail"" comes with a DVD version of the classic Ernst Lubitsch 1940 romantic comedy, ""The Shop Around the Corner"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

I'm not afraid to admit that I am a big fan of Meg Ryan's hit romantic comedies and especially enjoy the chemistry and pairing of Ryan along with Tom Hanks.

Back in the 1930's through the 1950's, there were Hollywood couples that would light the screen in multiple films, for today's modern films, there really hasn't been American couple other than Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, two talents that viewers fell in love whenever they were together in a romantic comedy.

And like many people who couldn't wait for ""You've Got Mail"" to be released in theaters, I was among the many who look forward to watching the film.  For one, I love Nora Ephron romantic comedies and how she is able to focus on character but also incorporate the city that a film is shot in.

She has an eye for location but also knows what she wants from her talents and Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have discussed how Nora Ephron's direction is much different than other filmmakers.  And for Ephron, her love for the Ernst Lubitsch classic ""The Shop Around the Corner"", especially for her passion towards the Broadway musical ""She Loves Me"" would lead to romantic magic for ""You've Got Mail"".

But back in 1998, this film was highly anticipated because I enjoyed watching Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan together, watching a Nora Ephron film but interesting enough, I also had a similar experience of meeting someone on the Internet with similar circumstances as the characters featured in the film.

And I was there to buy the first DVD release of the film and here we are 14-years later with a Blu-ray release of ""You've Got Mail"".  And where films such as ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"" are not dated due to technology, ""You've Got Mail"" manages to date itself with old technology via modem connection, old product placement during a time when American Online (AOL) was on top of Internet providers and also during a time when mega bookstores were not threatened by the emergence of online bookstores such as Amazon.

But still, despite the older technology and the fads of the time, I was not turned off by it.  In fact, I was nostalgic of how things were back then.

But ""You've Got Mail"" still manages to captivate me as it did back then.  Sure, it was not my favorite Meg Ryan romantic comedy especially when compared to ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"" but there is a magic that exists in the film, because of the wonderful chemistry between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.  The two can literally take on these characters and bring amazing life to them, making them believable and entertaining to watch.  And also Nora Ephron's ability to make the locations and the music selections compliment the characters as well.

Also, the film managed to bring in a pretty enjoyable supporting cast with Parker Posey, Dave Chappelle, Steve Zahn, Heather Burns and Dabney Coleman.  But also ""You've Got Mail"" would feature actor Greg Kinnear (""As Good as It Gets"", ""Ghost Town"", ""Little Miss Sunshine"") and ""Grey's Anatomy"" actress Sara Ramirez before they became popular.

Also, I was impressed at the time of how the Ephron sisters were able to modernize the film from its original predecessors.  I absolutely adore Ernst Lubitsch's 1940 classic ""The Shop Around the Corner"" and I'm so glad ""You've Got Mail"" was not a remake.  Sure it incorporates certain situations that were seen in the original film, but for the most part, everything was new and everything worked.

""The Shop Around the Corner"" is simply a wonderful romance film that is different in the fact that both lead characters work in the same gift shop but there is also a dramatic element as the shop owner thinks the lead character Alfred Kralik (played by James Stewart) is having an affair with his wife.  But this classic film is a wonderful feel-good romantic comedy that has managed to stand the test of time, even over 70-years-later...I'm still enjoying this film no matter how many times I have watched it.  And while not on Blu-ray but on DVD, the film still looks very good on DVD!

While the Blu-ray release of ""You've Got Mail"" and its video quality does show the film's age due to softness and also some instances of artifacting, there is still a good amount of detail and beautiful colors that make this Blu-ray release worth owning and worth upgrading from the DVD release.  If you were an owner of the first DVD release, a lot of the special features do make it onto this Blu-ray, but also the inclusion of the 2008 10th anniversary reunion between Nora Ephron, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in the featurette ""Delivering You've Got Mail"" (which was released in a later DVD release of ""You've Got Mail"").

Also, the biggest addition for me which I absolutely loved was the inclusion of Ernst Lubitsch's 1940 romantic comedy, ""The Shop Around the Corner"".  While a DVD, not Blu-ray...still you are getting two films when you purchase the ""You've Got Mail"" Blu-ray release and for hopeless romantics, the fact that these two films are included is fantastic!  And did I mention that you can find this Blu-ray release for under $10 on Amazon?  Awesome!

Overall, ""You've Got Mail"" is still as delightful and highly entertaining as when I first watched it in theaters back in 1998.  Sure, things have changed a lot in technology and also economic settings when it comes to the mega bookstores in today's society, but Internet romance is much more prevalent today than it was back then and more and more people are discovering love online, so the film still has relevance today.

If you love romantic comedy films, you're going to enjoy ""You've Got Mail"" on Blu-ray for the fact that you get two films for the price of one and if you enjoyed the film back then and owned the DVD, you're definitely going to want to upgrade to Blu-ray.  It's a wonderful deal and both films are highly recommended!",1336176000,12,11002,4.786433492315846
1033070,4,6305368201,"OK so it's not the best movie ever, or even close, but this is a very enjoyable film. There are a few flaws - I mean *I* for one was annoyed with Hanks's character when he doesn't come clean - however it's just a great feel-good, funny, sweet movie about two people inadvertantly falling in love.

It's cheesy, it's predictable, and it isn't a patch on Sleepless, BUT I loved every second of it. Hanks and Ryan have such chemistry, and are both so expressive, that they can carry the slightly weak script, and there are some wonderful character moments in the supporting cast (Greg Kinnear, in a small role, is IMO just wonderful here). With all its faults, it cheers me up every time I watch it - a classic romcom, and unashamed to be nothing more or less than that.

If you don't like cheesy movies, or if you don't tolerate being able to see how things are going to end from the first five minutes, then avoid this. If, like me, you are a girly girl :-), then rent it or borrow it... buy it if, like me, you sometimes need cheering up with a good helping of cheese and true love.",1335398400,,1082,4.273170731707317
1033071,5,6305368201,"What can I say, Hanks and Ryan work well together.  This is also before Ryan got that botox done to her lips (which now makes her look like a fish).  It's kind of neat to see the ""older"" technology with their computers too.",1334880000,,223,4.162790697674419
1033072,5,6305368201,"You've Got Mail (Deluxe Edition) 1998 - Meg Ryan & Tom Hanks is very good , clear picture & great sound, I just love to have this on DVD you can watch whole movie or skip to the parts you love I also love the new special features they have added which I added the information below, You've Got Mail was released in 1998. It is based on a classic film called ""The Shop Around the Corner"" a movie made in 1940. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have starred together before in Joe versus the Volcano (1990) , Sleepless in Seattle (1993) - (Based on the movie An Affair to Remember )and You've Got Mail (1998),I just love Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks they have such a great chemistry together,also love that it is set around Books and New York. In this movie they become email buddies on AOL. Tom Hanks is NY 152 (Joe) and Meg Ryan is Shopgirl (Kathleen) . After talking a while online they decide to meet and make a date. It also has a good supporting cast with Parker Posey ( Dazed and Confused and As the World Turns) as Joe's former obnoxious girlfriend, and Greg Kinnar ( As Good as It Gets) as Kathleen's former boyfriend. The movie also stars Jean Stapleton (All in the Family) as Kathleen's co-worker and confidant, and a very young Dave Chappell (American comedian, screenwriter, television/film producer) ,as Joe's friend. The soundtrack is also great.

Every time I watch it, there's more things that I catch that I didn't notice the time before which makes the movie even more hilarious, still!",1334016000,,296,4.823529411764706
1033074,4,6305368201,"One of my favorite movies.

1033075,4,6305368201,"I am not going to write 2,000 words on this movie so don't worry. This has been one of my favorite movies since I was 11 years old.

It is a purely good story. No swearing, no sex, nothing profane. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are two of my favorite actors of all time. Together in the same film can only be good.

There are some slow parts, but otherwise it is a great romantic-(comedy?) I think this is a great film for everyone mature enough to understand it. Take the time to watch it and you will love it forever. An instant classic as they say.",1332115200,,544,4.074766355140187
1033136,4,6305368201,"Hanks and Ryan are a perfect match for a deliberately  paced, if somewhat incredible, love story in New York. I found myself smiling thinking back to the dawn of internet chatrooms in the 1990s... I used them myself though of course I grew out of them and have since moved to dedicated forums for my various interests (travel, photography, music...) and dating websites for meeting potential partners. Listening again to the whirring and hissing of narrow-band dial-up connection had a nostalgic effect on me!

A wonderful feel-good story but much more. It is also the story of modern cities, where traditional family businesses are jeopardized by megastores which offer larger selections and lower prices. It is happening all over the world. Megastores in turn are threatened by e-commerce. I don't share the romantic view that it was better in the good old days of small stores, where one was forced to choose from a smaller selection of goods on offer (be it books or anything else) and had to pay higher prices. Old stores, like everybody else,  must adapt to the new world or they will inevitably disappear. Long live Amazon!",1331942400,,1130,4.9057591623036645
1033137,5,6305368201,It is a old movie by now but it is still one of our favorite movies.  Tom Hanks as usual does a tremendous job.,1329523200,,111,3.625
1033138,5,6305368201,"OK, this is a shamelessly uncritical review of a shamelessly romantic movie. It's a story where the ending is so obvious it's actually pictured on the cover of the DVD. No-one in the world could be as perfect as the two stars. The New York setting is cleaner, brighter and more sparkling than any city, let alone New York, could ever be. The dialog is sharper, funnier and more poignant than anyone who didn't have the lines written for them could come up with. In short, it bears no relation to real life.

However, every so often it's nice to watch a movie which portrays life as we wish it could be. Tom Hanks as the man of business and Meg Ryan as the dreamer are stereotypes, but such warm characters that it's impossible not to like them. The supporting cast is excellent, with Greg Kinnear and Parker Posey playing the wrong choices as weak and petty respectively and Dabney Coleman and the wonderful Jean Stapleton putting in amusing cameos. Even Brinkley is the ideal dog.

The movie doesn't dally around, but moves briskly from scene to scene. Sentimentality is rife, but doesn't overwhelm the story due to the pacing and the ability of Tom Hanks to play sentimental scenes without descending into mawkishness. The fade-out is on the embrace, as picture-perfect as everything else.

When life seems difficult to bear, let this movie give you a warm glow. It does that for me every time.",1328918400,,1396,4.666666666666667

Also love the backdrop of New York City's Upper West Side - if you live in the area, you'll get a kick out of seeing this movie play out in your neighborhood! I've watched this movie again and again and love it each time! This is also a movie I can watch with my fiance and he enjoys it just as much as I do!",1327795200,2,423,3.9302325581395348

1033187,5,6305368201,"Our family has loved this movie since it was released. Although technology has moved so fast that dial-up connection is as dated as the snail mail of the 1940 movie on which this version is based, this is still a very charming romantic comedy. We bought the Blu-Ray version to enhance our viewing.",1324598400,,297,4.622641509433962
1033188,4,6305368201,"While a lot of pure fans of ""The Shop Around the Corner"" are harsh critics of this movie, I'm not among them. ""The Shop Around the Corner"" is one of my favorite films, and is on our required viewing list each year during the Christmas season. However, I don't find it a challenge to thoroughly enjoy both films.

For the few people who aren't familiar, the plots surround a man and a woman who are pen pals who don't know each other's identities, and when they unknowingly meet it is under circumstances that cause them to dislike each other. In ""The Shop Around the Corner"", the movie starts in warm weather and concludes on Christmas Eve. In ""You've Got Mail"" the movie starts just prior to the holiday season and concludes later the next year during warm weather. ""Shop"" has pen pals writing actual letters, and ""Mail"" has the modern twist of AOL email.

This was made during Tom Hanks' unbeatable heyday. By coincidence, my wife and I a few times used to play a little intellectual movie game where we tried to line up which recent stars best filled the shoes of some of the giants of yesteryear. We were agreed that Tom Hanks was very similar to Jimmy Stewart in that he plays a variety of roles, and many of them are very good natured. I could easily see Hanks in a remake of Harvey, for example. Therefore we were amused when we later found Hanks in this movie, reprising a Stewart role.

""Mail"" adds complexities to the story which didn't exist in the original. In ""Mail"", both romantic leads start the story in other relationships. Instead of working in the same store, they are business rivals (at least Hanks' character is a rival for Meg Ryan's). They don't see each other as often, but the sense of the key scenes is there.

""Mail"" is a different type of movie from ""Shop"". While ""Shop"" is in a way a romance, it is more a comedy, with supporting roles doing a lot of the lifting on the laughs. ""Mail"" is more of a light romance, and although it has amusing moments, they are not laugh out loud funny like some of the scenes in ""Shop"".

The Warner DVD first released in 1999 of ""You've Got Mail"" is simply terrible, as most Warner DVD releases of that day were. It is VERY grainy, and is full screen format. Don't be fooled by the format claim that it is anamorphic and widescreen ... that simply isn't true. I pulled it back out tonight and found it to be essentially unwatchable compared to the HD and Blu ray programming we've become used to. Luckily Amazon streams an HD version of the movie free as part of Amazon Prime, and while that presentation won't blow you away, neither will graininess constantly distract you.

We've watched this film several times over the years, and still enjoy it.",1324166400,,2711,4.488843813387424
1033189,5,6305368201,"Just watched it on Amazon Instant Video and loved every bit of it. Wanna watch again anytime.

1033192,5,6305368201,"What can I say- I am a middle aged guy who absolutely loves this movie, and I've probably seen it 10 times. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks combine to provide an ongoing hate-love relationship spurred on by Hanks' building of a bigbox ""Fox Books"" store around the corner from Meg Ryan's little books store. This, of course, ultimately puts her out of business, after the store opened by her mother 42 years ago.  While the real life, comedic disagreement is going on, they meet by coincidence in the early days of the internet and AOL (1997 I think) with online chat, IMs and then exchanging emails.  But the story really does become compelling, and you find yourself pulled in and hoping that they overcome their mutual disdain, to find what you can see as a not-so-obvious attraction for each other.  Some may find a it another corny love story. However, I think it provides hope, that in a big and cold world, two nice people can find friendship and love with each, through overcoming their initial bias of dislike towards each other.  I know this all sounds hokey, but watch, then you'll watch it again, and again, and you'll find this on your list of all-time-favorite movies, just like me. Besides that, it is a clean and wholesome story with a really nice ending.  An average of 4 stars by over 500 reviewers can't be all wrong.  Spend the 1:50+ minutes with Hanks and Ryan, and you'll see why they became the huge stars they were then and are today.  This movie was a hit from the peak of both of their long-term and successful film careers.  Enjoy :>",1321920000,,1550,4.530465949820789

1033194,4,6305368201,"This film seems quite dated in some respects. All those dial-up modem connections and the still-new sheen of all the internet technology on display. Little did the writers of the screenplay dream that the internet would spell doom for the brief heyday of the book superstore. Starbucks has also come down significantly from its late '90s prominence on display in the film.
 I was somewhat taken aback from the disfunctional Fox family structure. Joe Fox (Hanks) has a grandfather in his 70s or 80s fathering a young daughter with no apparent mother for the child mentioned in the film. Joe's father has had a long string of paramours, mostly hitting on the nannies hired to care for his son.  His currnet paramour has produced a 4 year old son, and the father is making noises about marrying her. Joe's mother is briefly mentioned, but her absence is never explained. Finally, Joe is living with a woman he doesn't love because she can match his self-absorption and can stand his obnoxious behavior.
 Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) runs the bookstore she inherited from her mother. Apparently her father was never involved in her life and is never mentioned in the film. The film hints that Joe Fox's grandfather may have been romantically involved with Kathleen Kelly's mother. If Kathleen was the product of such a union, there may be an element of incest involved in any romantic relationship between the two.
 The film mostly follows the worn conventions. It is somewhat amusing to watch how Joe can turn on the charm when it suits him. Joe decides he wants to romance his former business rival and deftly outmanuvers her naive approach to life. Joe works both sides of the street to gain the trust and affection of a woman who formerly despised him. Kathleen Kelly is such a fundamentally decent woman, she stands no chance against the devious Joe Fox.
 The film ends with a tentative kiss growing into full-blown love. Well, maybe Joe Fox will rise above his family disfunction and treat Kathleen Kelly as she deserves to be treated.",1320451200,,2030,4.82183908045977

1033320,4,6305368201,"Rather than repeating other reviewers, I take a somewhat different angle. This flick hearkens to a time when communicating via computer, on a large scale, was new. This allowed for anonymous contacts between men and women, but the anonymity facilitated obvious questions, and these are brought out in this flick.

You, and the one you communicate with, may already be in a relationship, and it is easy to keep this a secret. In fact, maybe the other person doesn't want to meet you face-to-face because he is already married. What if he/she is grossly overweight or otherwise unattractive? What if he/she is a criminal?

How does the person you are communicating with compare with your hopes and expectations of him/her? Should you even meet face to face at all, or keep the relationship anonymous forever? The latter would enable you to cling to your fantasy of the other person.

The plot of this flick has many surprises. One thing I would have changed in the plot would involve super-businessman Mr. Fox incorporating the simple little bookstore as part of his own enterprise instead of driving it, and the woman he loves who owns it, out of business.",1308528000,3,1155,4.852791878172589

Myself included.
It's basically the beginning of the internet for personal use in the late 90's, and a love story of sorts plays out in a strange way online. To complicates things, a rivalry ensues.
I adore the cast of charachters. Even the ones with small roles, like Birdie and Joe's grandfather. I love the wording of the emails that are sent from both Joe and Kathleen. I love the locations, and the apartments are to die for!
New York is also one of the stars of this film. There are so many city scenes in this movie, and it makes you wish the New York of today was more like it was then.
To sum it up, I think this is Nora Ephron's finest film (screenplay and direction) to date. I watch it several times a year.

1033372,2,6305368201,"I watch this movie repeatedly for the New York City scenes, architecture, and building interiors - and for Tom Hank's portrayal of a type many would like to know.  (Gotta love the way he shoves the kid out of the door, too). Given that Hank's Joe Fox was allowed to be mature - why did Ephron infantilize Ryan's character?

Kathleen doesn't know what's going on financially with the bookstore - that's left entirely in the hands of Jean Stapleton's 'Birdie' character.  Ryan's 'Kathleen' bounces and cute-walks and pretend fist-fighting -- is she 4 years old? - instead of making a concerted effort to save her business.  It makes me nauseous every time I watch the movie.  I hate myself for watching this puerile portrayal of a grown woman. Why does she talk in a cutsey voice that wouldn't be tolerated in a 4 year old?  (There is one look Stapleton's character gives Ryan's that, with great clarity says, ""You are not a business-woman, but a little girl jackass trapped in fantasy land.  I send kisses to Stapleton for that look.  Ephron must have missed it).

And why does the grandfather say that letter-writing was called ""mail""?  Why?  Why?  I know he's doty (sp?) but why?  He and Kathleen's mother may have exchanged letters, he said.  ""You wrote her letters?""  ""Mail.  It was called mail"" then.  Is this just an extremely stupid edit?  Drives me nuts.  And OH MY GOD - - She's read Pride and Prejudice a hundred times, and ""I get lost in the language:  words like ""thither, ""mistience???"" what is she saying?"", ""felicity.""  She gets LOST in those words???  There truly seems to be something seriously wrong with her brain.  I mean, she's even condescending to the kids - and what the heck is bad about the name ""Thelma"" - so she's teaching kids to make fun of people's names?

And she her 'loyal' staff does whatever they choose -- oh can't mail that important invitation now - I have to work on my term paper - garbage like that.  It's infuriating.  I'd like to ram those twinkle lights up Ephron's nose.

I can actually buy that Joe Fox stays with Kathleen because he doesn't seem to want to be with a mature or remotely powerful woman - or so it seems to me.  But they ain't gonna be happy.  I don't believe he wants to be married to a baby. One last thing - WHAT are those eyebrows on Ryan?  Were they painted on?  And Heather Burns' makeup was similarly bizarre.

I think all the actors except Ryan's were allowed to do a great job.  Perhaps this was Ephron's way of getting back at Ryan for being so blonde and popular or some other affront. But then, why did Ephron allow Parker Posey to HAVE an interesting character?  In the end, I expect Kathleen Kelly will end up in a padded cell.",1293926400,5,2702,4.503092783505155

If we can't be as rich and beautiful as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, and their characters, we can at least emulate the decent way they treat each other.

You've Got Mail also has a subtle cultural optimism to it.  The film asks whether we are losing our soul or at least our charm as traditions change and mom-and-pop stores are replaced by national brands.  The film's answer is that it is already us and we're making it work.

Meg's colleague moves seamlessly over to the national chain store, as does her author.  Her mentor retires gracefully on winnings from a bet on Intel's stock.  Meg herself types not on a locally assembled clone but on a notebook computer from a Fortune 500 firm that uses restrictively proprietary technology (the Apple Corporation).  Possibly most insidious of all, Meg gets her coffee not from a local boutique but from Starbucks, and she drinks it from paper cups without a second thought.

1033377,4,6305368201,"Interesting rom-com from the late 1990s, when the internet was new and chat rooms were the in thing, when AOL ruled the cyberspace community.

Ah, the whine of a 56K modem and the AOL voice, ""You've Got Mail"" brings back memories.

First Impressions:

What if you revealed your deepest personal thoughts to someone online, never suspecting that he/she was a person that you had met in person?  In this case, Kathleen [Meg Ryan] and Joe [Tom Hanks], even though they have mildly interesting partners of their own, sneak onto their AOL accounts and chat about life.

Unbeknownst to Joe, Kathleen is a proprietor of Shop Around the Corner, a popular independent bookstore for children.  And unbeknownst to Kathleen, Joe is part of the Fox Books chain of books, a family run operation that gleefully shuts down independent bookstores, buy up their stock and then sell it cheaply.

Though this is a romantic comedy, it does make quite a scathing commentary on chain bookstores, like Powell's or Barnes & Noble, as these chains buy up independents and destroy the unique atmosphere of neighborhood businesses.  They take a stab at Starbucks as well, another well known conglomerate, as independent coffee shops struggle to survive.

As an aside, these days this is changing:  Barnes & Noble for example, is not doing well while independents are flourishing.  Interesting how things can change in 12 or so years.

The film's plot is well-run and nicely running along.  We have Kathleen and Joe meet, at first not knowing who each other is.  Then when they do, they dislike each other because they are competitors.

Then ironically they chat about each other and the problems they're having.  Joe gives Kathleen advice that actually helps compete with his own store!  Hilarious.

The movie starts taking a fall for me when Joe and Kathleen arrange to meet off-line.  When Joe discovers who his online chat-mate is, he leaves her in the coffee shop and abandons her without meeting.

I mean, how callous and shallow can you get?  The film took a turn I didn't like at this point.

Bottom Line:

The film updates and relocates the Ernst Lubitsch classic, The Shop Around the Corner (1940)&nbsp;].

Overall, great comedy and Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan recreate that chemistry I loved in ""Sleepless in Seattle.""&nbsp;]  Just wish the middle and ending were a bit more smoother.

1033577,4,6305368201,"You've Got Mail is a cute love story between two people whose personalities click despite the fact that they initially seem like total opposites.  It's a good choice when you just want to sit down and watch something happy, clean, lightly-romantic, and good for a few laughs.

The storyline isn't without its flaws, though.  It seems a little bit too convenient that both of the main characters go through easy breakups with their previous partners.  Kelly and her boyfriend just happen to have no feelings for each other, making their breakup seem like a completely pleasant and happy moment with no emotional repercussions.  Joe's breakup conveniently isn't shown, and he doesn't seem to face any emotional stress afterwards, either.  In the real world, one almost hopes that intimate relationships are a little bit more difficult to end, but in the movie we're supposed to be happy enough for Joe and Kelly that we just kind of want to get the break-ups out of the way so we can get on with the romance we want to see between the two main characters.  In the real, non-Hollywood world I've seen that e-relationships aren't quite so easy to manage, but everything falls nicely into place for the movie's main characters, regardless of the odds.

Despite the movie's improbabilities, I still enjoyed it and thought the story was sweet.  I'd watch it again with my sisters or friends for some light-hearted fun.  But don't let it encourage you to rush into internet chatrooms searching for the love of your life. ;-)  You're just as likely to meet the dreaded kind of person Joe suggests Kelly's attachment might be: married, jailbird, drinker, 150 years old...you name it!",1234828800,,1673,4.876325088339223

1033636,5,6305368201,"""All this nothing has meant more to me than so many somethings."" -- Kathleen

This captivating film from Nora Ephron about finding that special someone who makes our heart beat faster and lends love to our small lives is one of the best. While no adaptation of Lubitsch's The Shop Around the Corner starring Jimmy Stewart and the winsome Margaret Sullavan could be as fully realized as that screen classic, no one can deny the great romantic appeal and utter charm of this one.

New York is photographed by cinematographer John Lindley as a magical place for romance to bloom. Meg Ryan is disarmingly enchanting as the blossom Tom Hanks finds so much beauty in through email correspondence, not realizing until too late that he is the person responsible for putting her children's bookstore out of business, and vice versa. Set as the Christmas season approaches, there is a lilting charm to this romantic comedy which must be credited to the two stars.

Kathleen has run The Shop Around the Corner since her mother passed away. It has been a fixture in the neighborhood for 42 years. But when Fox Books opens just across the street, her little store, so personal and intimate, cannot compete with the huge discounts and coffee bar customers flock to at Fox. What she does not know is Joe Fox, who is responsible for her business woes, is also NY152, the person she is falling for online.

Her handle is Shopgirl, and since they have made a pact to only speak in generalities about their lives, neither discovers whom the other is, until they try to meet. Joe can't believe it is she waiting with her copy of Pride and Prejudice and red rose in the cafe. So NY152 stands her up, whilst Joe just happens along. Sparks of the wrong variety fly yet he cannot let her think her dream of finding someone dashed because he didn't care. It is when her store finally closes and he realizes he loves Kathleen that this film is at its most charming.

Joe works his way into her heart and discusses and advises her on her email relationship, finding ways to date her without her realizing she's being wooed. But he and his dog Brinkley finally must risk all and let her know and hope for love rather than disappointment. The final moments of this film are very special, Ryan especially wonderful showing everything she feels without saying a word. Hanks is pretty terrific here also, and the two have a screen chemistry you can feel.

Dave Chappelle as Joe's pal, Dabney Coleman as his father, and Greg Kinnear as her boyfriend, lend fine support. Both Joe and Kathleen are with someone else but the audience knows from the start that they belong together. A great soundtrack and humorous references to The Godfather offer smiles and warmth rather than outright laughter in a film with a quiet yet abundant charm. A wonderful film for anyone who still has the dream of someone.",1220832000,2,2866,4.665346534653465
1033637,4,6305368201,"Meg Ryan has always been a pretty face. Still you can see the subtle changes of her features over the years. In ""Armed and Dangerous"" of 1986, her pretty face was more school-girlish. In ""When Harry Met Sally"" of 1989, her pretty face was radiant and gorgeous. In ""Sleepless in Seattle"" of 1993, her pretty face was that of a beautiful mature woman. In ""You've Got Mail"", her pretty face was more angular because she had lost weight. With minimal make-up, she came across as a very fresh, adorable, natural beauty. It is this pretty face that I loved the most.  And then those cute mannerisms, she truly captured my heart and many others' too. Many times this cuteness was exaggerated, but hey, it's ok. It's a movie, for entertainment. Enjoy it rather than critique it.  I replayed many many times the part starting from Tom Hanks going to Meg Ryan's apartment with the daisy to start ""tweaking his project"", to the end of the movie. The section was purely one on one between Hanks and Ryan. I wish they lengthened this section. I also wish they lengthened the end where Ryan finally met Hanks the ""NY152"" email pen-pal for the first time, and of course Hanks the ""Fox"". I think the writer/director could make the ending more touching, say adding some reminiscence of old email, etc., to show again for the last time the bonding effect those email had on the both of them. They could also show more of Ryan's bitter-sweet reactions/ dialogues for being strung along by Hanks when he hid his ""NY152"" identity.  I enjoy this movie thoroughly. I just hope they will re-issue the film, via videos if not the cinemas, incorporating the above wishes. I think this film, as it stands now, will become a classic. With the additions wished for, I think the film can become a ""great"" classic.",1220659200,2,1783,4.636075949367089

If I have known, it has been this nice and somehow funny, I would have watched it long earlier. This is a warm, humorous and charming movie. Although, Katleen and Joe have not met each other before, they know each other (not by identity) from the AOL emails. They have met each other in ""Over thirties"" chatroom and looks like they have been mailing each other since then, but secretly! Both of them are involved in a relationship, however, both of them love to hear the sentence ""You've Got Mail"" when they log into AOL mails service. If they have only known this sentence actually meant a lot more to them than they were aware of. When they decide to meet each other physically, Joe finds out that his mail friend Shopgirl has actually been a business competitor, Katleen, if we could name it so. Katleen or Shopgirl, owns a little book shop for children, but at the moment her business is threatened by Fox books recently established right next to her little shop. Maybe it is not hard to imagine now that Fox books is owned by Joe or NY152! Well, when Joe finds this out at their first attempt to meet each other, he avoids to introduce his email identity to Katleen, but acts as if he was around the meeting place by coincidence. Katleen would think she had been stood up by her email friend NY152 not knowing this email friend is her biggest competitor ever! Now it is time for him to capture Katleens's heart as ""Joe the competitor"" instead of NY152 since he seems to be already in love with her! Anddddd he does so. Katleen is forgiving and love does not understand much about competition anyways. They end up happly, just as you can see it IN the picture on the cover of the DVD!

Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is the second-generation owner of a small but conventional children's bookstore in Manhattan.  When her boyfriend leaves for work, Kathleen skips to the window and watches until she's sure that he won't be returning to retrieve something he may have inadvertently forgotten.  Seemingly satisfied that he's on his way to the office, she scampers over to her computer and logs onto an ancient version of AOL where a masculine, computerized voice announces, ""You've Got Mail!""  She then settles down to read the witty and charming e-mail sent to her by her secret ""pen pal""...

The scene then switches to Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) as his voice-over reads Kathleen's e-mail.  Joe seats himself at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee as Brinkley, the golden retriever who will eventually be the subject of one of his e-mails to his ""pen pal"", reclines on the pooch cushion.  After Joe watches his manic girlfriend leave for the day, he heads back to his computer and logs onto AOL to see what ""Shopgirl"" has to say.

Their online relationship is easy-going and enjoyable, and as their communication continues, they both suspect that they may have found their soul mate in each other.

But as it turns out, Joe owns the mega-book conglomerate that is moving just around the corner from Kathleen's quaint little bookstore, a move that eventually costs Kathleen her business.  How these two meet and the effect their professional lives has on their relationship are what make this movie a pleasure to watch.  The chemistry between Tom and Meg is tangible, and the supporting cast adds to the movie's charm.

After a long work week or a hectic day when I feel the need to watch something ""happy"", I reach for this DVD and escape into the simple and carefree world of Tom's and Meg's ""You've Got Mail"".",1210982400,,1963,4.741176470588235

However, the pieces fit a little too perfectly for me, so much so that it feels packaged for maximum audience appeal. It really takes the combined skills of Hanks and Ryan to make this palatable, even likable, but it's not without its challenges.

As with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sleepless-in-Seattle/dp/B0000AOV4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sleepless in Seattle</a>, Ephron, along with her sister Delia as co-screenwriter, attempts to update a tried-and-true film classic, this time Ernst Lubitsch's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shop-Around-the-Corner/dp/B00006FDCV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shop Around the Corner</a>&nbsp;(1940), about two people who are concurrently in an antagonistic professional relationship and also anonymous pen-pals fantasizing who the other may be in real life. The novelty this time is that the story takes place at the dawn of the Internet age when people automatically set up AOL accounts with incognito screen names. E-mail and instant messaging have replaced the need for the postal system to exchange anticipated love letters. The story focuses on Joe Fox, one of the wealthy owners of a mega-bookstore chain called Fox Books, a doppelganger for Borders or Barnes & Noble. On Manhattan's Starbucks-saturated Upper West Side, he is opening one of his monstrous stores in the vicinity of The Shop Around the Corner, a specialty children's bookstore owned by Kathleen Kelly.

Much of the movie has to do with her attempts to defend her antiquated turf and ward off the inevitable cannibalization of her small business. I actually found this part of the movie entertaining with nice tweaks in the verbal interplay on corporate greed. I especially liked the sharply scripted scene in the coffeehouse when Kathleen succinctly puts down Joe's business intentions. The other side of the film is the burgeoning love story between Joe and Kathleen on AOL where under their screen names `NYC152' and `Shopgirl', they find themselves bonding and falling in love. Similar to what occurs in the original movie and the Judy Garland musical remake,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Good-Old-Summertime/dp/B0001DCYU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Good Old Summertime</a>, Joe finds out who `Shopgirl' is before Kathleen realizes that he is `NYC152', allowing for an extended courting sequence from Kathleen's sickbed through the Union Square Greenmarket and other locales.

Hanks is a more avuncular presence as Joe and not as manically funny as usual except for a funny scene where he attempts to hide his identity in her bookstore. As Kathleen, Ryan is sometimes on twinkle overdrive, but she manages to come back to her innate malleability as an actress, a quality not all that common among the subsequent generation of rom-com heroines (for example, Kate Hudson in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-Lose-a-Guy-in-10-Days/dp/B000094J7Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</a>&nbsp;or Hilary Swank in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/P-S-I-Love-You/dp/B000YAA6AU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">P.S., I Love You</a>). Most importantly, even when the material feels like retread, the pair has definite chemistry. The supporting cast is adept and filled with strong players - Parker Posey as Joe's self-obsessed book editor girlfriend Patricia, Greg Kinnear as Kathleen's intellectually pompous boyfriend Frank, a young Dave Chappelle as Joe's colleague Keith, Jean Stapleton as Kathleen's eccentric partner.

The 2008 Deluxe Edition DVD maintains all the features of the previous 1999 DVD, specifically an entertaining commentary track by Ephron and producer Lauren Shuler Donner, a brief HBO short with Ephron, a music video of Carole King's ""Anything at All"", a music-only audio track, and an interactive tour of the filming locations in New York's Upper East Side. Unfortunately, there are no deleted or expanded scenes offered in either the old or new DVD releases.

1033715,4,6305368201,"I really liked the original better - 1940's ""The Shop Around the Corner"". However, for a modern romantic comedy this one hits the spot. It alters the means of communication between the mismatched couple to email from  letters. This film has Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) as the heir to a Borders-like bookstore empire whose family is opening a new store near his pen pal Kathleen Kelly's (Meg Ryan) small childrens' bookstore. It is the same as its predecessor in that the pen pals actually know each other and do not like each other. It alters the basis of the disagreement to be that of Fox's big impersonal business delivering goods at a discount with the price being a largely anonymous and unknowledgeable retail staff versus Kelly's personal service and first editions that carries a large pricetag for the paying customers. It turns out that, even in Manhattan, people prefer to buy discount with the result being the end of Kathleen's store. The movie keeps things interesting with several little side stories and unanswered questions. Did Joe's grandfather ever date Kathleen's mother? Did Kathleen's employee Birdie (Jean Stapleton) have an affair with Francisco Franco in her youth?  Why and how did Birdie decide to buy all of that Intel stock? Then there is the whole issue of Joe's serially monogamous dad (Dabney Coleman) that plays out quite humorously and the fact that Joe has an aunt that is thirty years younger than he is. Considering Joe's mother had to be a victim of his father's philandering at some point, Joe seems to take his dad's personal habits quite casually. A very moving addition to this version of the story is Kathleen's identification of the store with her mother to the point that, when the store does finally close, she considers it to be much like her mother dying all over again.

The only thing that really bothered me was the issue of Joe and Kathleen seeking other relationships while seriously involved with other people to the point of living with them and not letting on that there was anything amiss. This seemed a bit underhanded on both their parts and somewhat undermined their likeability, at least to me.

1033717,3,6305368201,"After having seen this film at least a dozen times with my wife, who never tires of it, and having enjoyed it myself for the most part (love Meg Ryan, really like Tom Hanks), I can understand why so many reviewers here seem to believe that this is a story about Internet romance.  Hiding in plain sight however is the film's actual thesis: that mom and pop businesses (in this case mom and daughter) have an evolutionary obligation to succumb to the natural and infinite expansion of megacorporations and their box stores.  Think about the movie's plot.  The greedy corporate suit not only succeeds in crushing the local bookstore competition (the continued existence of which would not harm his bottom line in the least), he is also able to manipulate his hapless victim into actually falling in love with him even after she finally finds out it was his machinations that destroyed her mother's beloved book store.  This is all the more outrageous because Tom Hanks, as usual, embodies this role with his usual boyish charm and he displays touching empathy for at least one of the bodies flattened by his steamroller megabooks operation.  We are manipulated by the characters and the dialogue into actually sympathizing with the bad guy in this film, and that, to me, is too much.  In the finale, to the tune of Nilsson's cover of ""Over the Rainbow,"" are we supposed to imagine Meg Ryan's character working in the Book Bunker?  Or does she move in with Hanks on his sailboat?  A scene that stands out is one in which Ryan's character visits the children's section of the new megabooks and we are treated to a wondrous vision of happy children thriving among the books.  Do the producers think their audience has never been in one of these stores? Unbelievable.

In the end what I really continue to like about this film is the score with its several Harry Nilsson songs.  Nilsson's wonderful tunes and energetic voice make me overlook the disingenuousness of the plot.

1033793,3,6305368201,"You've Got Mail is a modern day version of The Shop Around the Corner.  The movie reunites Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, and director-producer-screenwriter Nora Ephron.  The trio is best remembered for their critically-acclaimed box office hit romantic comedy Sleepless in Seattle.

Although this movie has the same familiar formula, it lacks the intelligence of its predecessor.  The only streak of originality is that the plot is updated to involve modern technology.  The entire movie evolves around the Internet, or more specifically AOL.  It points out what most of us have already discovered at some point: people can meet on-line, have a loving on-line relationship but never meet in person.  And as Meg Ryan's character, Kathleen Kelly, and Tom Hank's character, Joe Fox, discover - people are quite different on-line than they are in real life.

This movie attempts to convey other important issues, the most powerful of which is the statement from Greg Kinnear's (As Good as it Gets) character, Frank Navasky, ""We are what we read.""  This movie dispels a crucial message - we live in a modern world, where technology allows us to do whatever we want, whenever we want; nonetheless, we should not allow technology to take over our imaginations.  In other words, we should not watch TV, or got to the Internet instead of reading a book.  It is possible to manage our time between all three.",1195516800,,1389,4.96969696969697
1033794,5,6305368201,"Most of criticism of this movie have focused on the notion that it is too sappy or sentimental.  I see where those critics are coming from.  However, I think their reaction suggests that perhaps they've missed the point of the movie and what makes it great.  It's not supposed to be a serious love story!

This film is full of strengths that don't get much notice in most reviews.  First, the writing is cleaver.  There are plenty of moments for quick laughs.  And the supporting characters are strong; they are a parade of various traits.  They, too, present a quick laugh.  The writing doesn't attempt to dissect any profound meaning out of the story... it just sticks to the surface.  Some people have viewed that as a negative thing, but that is a little unfair; sometimes a little surface humor is needed.

The film is clean entertainment, which is something that is often hard to find.  There is no swearing, nudity, violence, or sex.  Just fun dialog and interesting situations.  The plot is ridiculous, to be sure... two people who meet each other who also happen to be emailing each other and don't know it.  I mean, come on!  But who cares?!?  What is wrong with Hollywood these days is that it tries to take ridiculous stories and make them seem real.  Who ever said that's the way it had to be?  This movie is good fun and part of the reason for that is because it's not meant to be serious.

All of the actors and actresses were good, strong matches for their parts.  Of course, the Hanks/Ryan duo practically goes without saying.  However, there are a lot of other faces in this film, and they all acted wonderfully.

This is a great movie for almost any age group... its certainly appropriate for kids older than nine or so.  It's good for a family movie night or a date night... this is my wife's and my own favorite movie to watch together.  This movie is certainly worth owning.

In a world where nothing is what it seems, enemies truly can become friends... friends can become lovers and lovers can make an eternity together.

1033800,1,6305368201,"Watching Nora Ephron movies is a trip in the wayback machine to the 1940's, when assertive, career-minded female film characters either (1) held on to their careers and lost the guy, or (2) dumped the career and won the guy. No other option existed.  Think women have made progress since then? ""You've Got Mail"" may be all dressed up in technicolor and tricked up with a relentless pop score, but it's the same old story.  Meg Ryan's bookstore owner has a dream, and that dream is smashed to bits by megachain-owing Tom Hanks.  When she finally realizes he's the same guy she's fallen in love with online and off, instead of punching him in the mouth she cries and they embrace.  Now she can go home and forget all about that bookstore.

Just in case Ryan might have been tempted to hang onto her dream, she has Parker Posey (playing Tom Hanks' fiancee) as a cautionary tale.  Posey's character is a nasty, career-obsessed harridan, whose sole plot function is to lose Hanks to Ryan.

This is retro antifeminism at its worst, and it's difficult to understand coming from a woman whose mother, Phoebe, was a respected Hollywood screenwriter in her own right. And Ephron herself is a dedicated career writer, who undoubtedly would spit in the face of anyone who trashed HER career.  So why does she write Meg Ryan into a world where the work-related dreams of women count for nothing?

Final note: I wish reviewers would stop comparing this movie to ""The Shop Around the Corner"". It may technically be a remake, but the two films are not the same league.  Ernst Lubitsch had a sharp eye for human folly but he also believed in happy endings based on reality, not manipulative mush.

1033922,4,6305368201,"""You've Got Mail,"" which was released in 1998, is a lovely romantic comedy/drama involving love, e-mails and running businesses. Meg Ryan plays Kathleen Kelly, the owner of ""Little Shop Around The Corner;"" a small bookstore formerly owned by her mother. The shop is devoted to its customers, kids and likewise. It is a people's bookstore, which is brimming with personality and a friendly atmosphere. One of her customers is a guy named Joe, who happens to have a devastating secret to hide from Kathleen. When Kathleen finds out who he is, they become instant enemies.  Apart from her business life, Kathleen has a steady boyfriend Frank (Greg Kinnear) and sort of a pen pal relationship on the side from someone on the Internet. Kathleen and her mystery man exchange friendly e-mails and seem to connect with one another very well. The question is, should Kathleen meet this guy?

When Joe Fox (Tom Hanks), owner of a brand new super store bookstore, ""Fox Books"" comes around, Kathleen and her ""Little Shop On The Corner"" is threatened to be pushed out of business. Unlike Kathleen's bookstore, ""Fox Books"" has a more big business look rather than the quaint personable feel. Yet, the super store has the books and the business to draw the crowds, and despite Kathleen's efforts to save her bookstore, she has to shut the little shop down. All the while, she has been keeping in contact with her mystery man through the e-mail, telling him of her deepest concerns and feelings, to which he responds with advice and support. Her boyfriend Frank seems to be the kind of workaholic, oblivious kind who doesn't really connect with her as well. So Kathleen feels she has her mystery man to fall back on.

Finally, Kathleen and her mystery e-mail man make plans to meet and that's where the fun begins. Magically, as much as Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly are rivals, they actually come to enjoy bumping into one another on the street. The truth is, Joe Fox knows something about Kathleen's mystery man that she doesn't, and along the way, she comes to value Joe's helpful ear for her concerns about this special guy on the Internet. However, she does not know that she is completely playing into the hands of a rather humorous game that Joe has been weaving.

Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. How can you go wrong with these two great stars? They completely turn on the magic in this film with their uncanny knack for humor, sarcasm and drama. You've got two of the best in leading roles. Together, they make this incredible story come to such real life that you are left with a lump in your throat at the end.

The music is wonderful; the sweet wistful rock song, ""Dreams"" from the Cranberries is featured, along with a rather magical version of ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" to end the film.

You know, this is mostly my mother's movie. She's usually into the romantic films more than I am, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's not too mushy in any way. It's just a fun, romantic comedy/drama with a unique twist that keeps you watching and watching. Romance sure comes in the oddest ways sometimes. Sometimes it's the person who is in front of your face all the time, sometimes it's the next customer to walk in the store, or sometimes it's when ""you've got mail.""",1174262400,3,3254,4.68006993006993
1033923,5,6305368201,"If there's one thing that America loves besides freedom, it's seeing Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan fall in love.  And (spoiler alert) that is what they do in this film, to the nth degree!

It's totally surprising too, because when this movie starts out, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan do not love each other.  Nay, they seem to hate each other!  When watching the movie I was like, ""oh boy, Chris.  What the ""H"" is going on?  I thought it was going to be a movie about Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in love, and yet...""  And then I was like ""Hang on a minute, Chris.  Things are starting to get good.""  And things did get good.

So--as I previously mentioned in a previous paragraph--Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan do not like each other but then...and here's the part you're gonna never believe, but stick with me here: they start chatting with each other on-line and falling in love!  But here's the clincher: the on-line lovers have no idea that they're the same real life people that they hate!  I don't know how these writers come up with these things, but I am a hundred times glad they do!

There are many, many tense action and drama-packed scenes where Tom Hanks types things to Meg Ryan.  There are also, surprisingly, many similar scenes where Meg Ryan types things to Tom Hanks.  It becomes clear that if William Shakespeare or Dr. Zhivago had on-line technology, most of the great romances they wrote would also be about typing, because it's something we can all relate to.

Do I have any criticisms of this heavy-hearted masterpiece?  Just two.  One is there are far too many full-frontal nude scenes for my liking, much as I am a fan of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.

Meg Ryan plays the proprietor of a local bookstore in NYC. Her staff knows its products and are good people. Tom Hanks plays the CEO of a large chain of bookstores with all sorts of amenities like coffee, wide selection and low prices. Everyone knows that the presence of the giant will eventually drive the little guy out of business. This prompts Meg to launch a campaign against the big guy. Her struggle is doomed because, ultimately, the customers like having low prices and lots of choices.

Behind the scenes, both Ryan and Hanks have met each other anonymously in an online chat room and have started to fall in love. As long as things are anonymous, the relationship grows but it too seems doomed once they learn who each other is. Hanks is the first one to learn but he recognizes that he has feelings for Ryan.

Meg played three different characters in that movie.  ""You've Got Mail"" was the third installment for Hanks and Ryan.  I enjoyed this movie more than the two previous.  The soundtrack is outstanding and the appearance of both lead actors is exceptional.  It is a ""romantic comedy"", which both do quite well together and separately.  The joining of a complimentary supporting cast (Jean Stapleton, Steven Zane, Heather Burns, Parker Posey, Dabney Colemen and Greg Kinnear) makes ""You've Got Mail"" Nora (director) and Delia (co-writer) Ephron the best team for romantic comedies.  Nora has been with Meg Ryan since ""When Harry Met Sally"", but the finale of ""You've Got Mail"" was the best way to end the relationship with Hanks and Ryan.  Meg continues on with the Ephron sisters in ""Hanging Up"" and hopefully will continue to make great productions in the future.  Hanks and Ryan will always be ""top"" box office draws even working independantly, they have the gift of making romance, drama, actually anything believeable.  Sometimes when I watch ""You've Got Mail"", I wonder if Tom Hanks is delivering a true to life protrail of his relationship with wife Rita Wilson. Meg Ryan has the gift of true comedic style, as well as perfect form and delivery, she is in a class of her own, with the exception of Katherine Hepburn.

The music of ""You've Got Mail"" brings a wide variety of artist to the screen.  I get captured in the sounds as well as the dialoque.  Watching Tom Hanks shake a Martini to the sounds of Randy Newman's ""lonely at the top"" or seeing Meg Ryan decorate a christmas tree to Harry Nilsson's ""remember"", there is nothing better.

This movie was just the tip of the iceberg in regards to where the Internet and Email has come today.  ""You've Got Mail"" is now synonymous with the movies and the email!",1119398400,3,2094,4.761772853185596

Two strangers that get involved in a relationship through e-mail is the premise of You've Got Mail, the movie that reunites Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Hanks plays Joe Fox (F-O-X), the owner of a book megastore who comes to destroy the competition in the New York West Side, where Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) has a lovely and small bookstore.

Enemies and rivals, Joe and Kathleen live, without knowing, an anonymous romance through their computer screens. She, although tries to maintain a human and personal touch in her store (which Joe's store lacks) and is skeptic to cultural globalization, can't stand a day without logging into the place where the words of her ""dear friend"" wait for her.

These two constitute, over e-mail, a more solid relationship than the ones they have in the real world. Kathleen's boyfriend is a columnist opposed to technology and change. Joe shares his life with Patricia, a book editor so hyperkinetic she ""makes coffee nervous"". But the worst obstacles to J&K relationship are themselves.

This is a very romantic film, a little manipulative and unbelievable, but its ingenuity evokes the feeling of an old movie. Hanks and Ryan are a perfect match, complementing each other beautifully. Talent, charisma and chemistry are a combination used with success by these two actors.

The other leading character is New York City. Director Nora Ephron captures its vibrant rhythms and romantic views in such a subtle way, one can't help but falling in love with the city.

1034137,4,6305368201,"Despite its overly commercial purpose (AOL advertising), You've Got Mail still manages to come off as a quaint and likeable romantic comedy. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan attempt to replicate the onscreen magic of Sleepless In Seattle, when the pair took the Hollywood box office by storm. You've Got Mail doesn't live up to the standards of Sleepless In Seattle, but it is a good romantic comedy when judged solely on its own merits. Hanks and Ryan both turn in performances which amplify the likeability of their respective characters, and the screenplay - despite some flaws - manages to create a viable plotline that keeps the audience interested. That's why You've Got Mail is a favorite of so many movie lovers...

Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) runs a well-known children's bookstore that's an icon of the community (her grandmother started it years before). However, the sustainability of her business is put into question when a large retail bookstore chain (similar to Borders) opens right across the street. The Fox Books store soon becomes a headache for Kelly as she butts heads with the arrogant and profit-oriented son of its founder, Joe Fox (Tom Hanks). Further disturbed by a stagnant relationship with her boyfriend Frank (Greg Kinnear), Kelly logs online where she strikes up a friendship with an unknown man in the city. Battling life's travails by day, Kelly finds her solace via the emails she trades with this unknown man...

But what Kelly and her arch nemesis Joe Fox don't know is that every time they log onto the web and hear ""you've got mail,"" they're actually corresponding with one another. Without the conflict of the competing business ventures entering into their relationship, the two are a perfect match for each other. When Joe discovers (through one of Kathleen's emails) that the woman he's been contacting is the crazy bookstore owner across the street, his encounters with Kathleen become less confrontational from his end. He develops a strong love for Kathleen, but needs to uncover a method by which he can reveal the secret. When Kathleen's bookstore is driven out of business by the massive discounter Fox Books, Joe fears that revealing his identity will cause him to lose Kathleen forever...

A romantic storyline at its core, You've Got Mail has a few plot flaws that stand out. One is that a major, faceless discount corporation could drive a well-established, well-run small business out of town. Loyal customers, especially for a niche store that sells only a particular type of book, would not be driven away by the opportunity to save three percent on their purchases. Also, the idea that these two could communicate for so long without discovering each other's identity stretches reality. It's not impossible, but for such a central plot point, you would think it could have been done better.

Overall, however, You've Got Mail is Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan putting forth their best. Each has a unique screen presence that attracts the opposite sex, keeping the film out of the realm of 'chick flick' and more in a category where everyone can equally enjoy the film. You've Got Mail, although a clich of the bygone dot com era, is still a highly entertaining and interesting film. The cast manages to save the screenwriter, and Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan utilize their mass appeal to make You've Got Mail a definite must-see movie...

Things are not that easy, however, for the two, since the former is to a great extent responsible for putting the latter out of business...

It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.

The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!

Joe, after meeting Kathleen (but not knowing he's been emailing her) describes Kathleen as ""a pill"" to a friend and co-worker. Joe has no idea that Kathleen is the sweet, charming woman he's been emailing.

1034200,4,6305368201,"Much like its predecessor, Sleepless In Seattle, You've Got Mail is one of the movies that can be watched time & time again, and you'll never tire of it - except for Parker Posey's rather annoying performance. Also look out for Heather Burns, who was also in Miss Congeniality, as ""Cheryl Frasier, Miss Rhode Island"". This is the third time that Meg and Tom have acted together, the previous two being: Joe Versus the Volcano and Sleepless in Seattle. I definitely think they should act together again, although what with Meg's very frozen look, and trout pout lips, it might be a little hard.

The movie's predictable at best, but a wonderful, ""modem"" love story, based around strangers emailing each other, and never telling each other personal details. This is a terrific way of bringing the rom-com into the 21st century, although the email gets left to one side from about halfway through the movie.

Joe Fox's grandfather mentions that long ago, he briefly shared a pen pal romance with the store's previous owner, Cecilia Kelly (Kathleen's mother), and that they only communicated through letters. This may have been a reference to the movie's predecessor, The Shop Around The Corner, starring James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan.

Joe misquotes The Godfather: When Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly first meet at the cocktail party, Joe says, ""I didn't know who you were with,"" quoting the movie producer Jack Woltz. The actual line is, ""Why didn't you tell me you were with the Corelone family?"" The scene where Joe accidentally closes the door of Kathleen's shop on the balloons was unscripted. Tom Hanks actually did that, and adlibbed the line, ""Good thing it wasn't the fish."" The director thought it was so funny that she kept it in.

A lot of the supporting cast completely vanish in the last quarter of the movie, and it's such a shame, it would have been nice to bring them back for the final scenes. I also did not like Meg Ryan's hair, it's much too harsh at times. She isn't as great as she was in Sleepless In Seattle, which is a shame, as it brings the movie down a bit, and leaves Tom struggling.

Sure romantic comedies aren't everybody's cup of tea (and boy, do I know that), but I certainly recommend you getting this if your girlfriend/best friend/mum/dad/sister/perhaps even boyfriend might like this.

Plus, with great directing and writing by Nora Ephron (i should point out that her sister wrote a lot of the script too, give credit when its due) the film was bound to be great. And great it was. A wonderful story, although not completely original, this is just a very modern day version of 'The Shop Around the Corner' which was a movie a long time ago apparantly (dont know exactly when shop around the corner came around, im only 16).

1034208,2,6305368201,"I never saw ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" but based on reviews read here, Hanks and Ryan have amazing screen chemistry. Unfortunately, it was not apparent in ""You've Got Mail.""  Ryan was great in ""When Harry Met Sally,"" as the perky cutesy adorable chick, but she was also in her 20s back then.  On a 35-year-old woman, it starts looking a little ragged around the edges, and, frankly, I cringed more than once at Ryan's character during this film.  The only actress more typecast than Ryan is Julia Roberts.  Honestly, are there no other roles for  women in Hollywood other than perky and cute or whiny and self-absorbed?

Product and corporate name placement was problematic in this film, including the title.  And the Ryan character had no difficulty buying her ""tall decaf mocha caramel macchiata latte cappuccino"" from a Starbucks, at the same time lambasting the Hanks character for  being a corporate whore. Talk about a mixed message.  Ephron apparently had no misgivings about making this movie ""Product Placement Central."" Unfortunately, this completely diminished the validity of the dilemma with which Ryan's character was faced - her store closing because a corporate chain moved in next door.  Since she herself feeds the monster she's fighting, it's difficult to empathize, because Ephron's message is so convoluted in this respect.

This film had to be a no-brainer for Hanks. Just show up and collect a paycheck. There was nothing remarkable about his role.  His character lacked any depth of persona - he was a caricature of a capitalist corporate business owner whose ""love"" for Ryan (or the two children, the ""aunt"" and ""brother"") could not be understood in any meaningfuul way, given the main crux of his character.  It's no secret that the majority of men in the economic and professional position of ""Joe Fox"" lack personal depth of character because those more ""feminine"" and ""caring"" traits detract from their highest goal - making money. Men in these positions generally write off women who are supposedly as intelligent, feisty, and independent as the Ryan character, but Ephron apparently wants us to engage in the fantasy that Joe Fox, by email, has undergone some sort of psychological/spiritual awakening and is actually just a normal nice funny guy, when in his ""real life"" he is a corporate bulldog who cares nothing about workers, small business owners, or the community social and economic results of his business agenda.

The secondary characters were more likable. It's only too bad that not a single character besides Ryan and Hanks was allowed to be developed.  I've seen Dave Chappelle live, and he's a scream, so it was disappointing he was given so little time in this film. And Jean Stapleton probably would have been better served with a more important role.  Playing her against the capitalist Dabney Coleman or the bizarre retro grandfather character could have added another dimension to the film.

It is difficult to watch second-rate romantic comedies such as this if you are accustomed to seeing some of the older Woody Allen fare.  Allen's way of intermingling stories, developing characters, and weaving subplots simply cannot be matched by these other writers.  And that's a shame.

Seeing this film does not  compel me to want to see ""Sleepless in Seattle.""  Why  bother?  Hanks and Ryan apparently couldn't pull off whatever it was this time. And I would have misgivings about seeing another Ephron film, given the complete and utter corporate shill she allowed for this piece of work.",1104364800,,3534,5.053448275862069

1034240,4,6305368201,"Almost everyone is focusing on the admittedly cute love story between Meg Ryan and Tom Hank's characters.  However, there is a very profound, intelligenly handled sub-plot that forms the second 'McGuffin' of the film that most reviewers are missing.  Specifically, the impact of large chains, and not just book ones, on small shops.

There are no villians here.  Unlike what some reviewers said, Joe Fox' Fox books is not ""driving Kathleen Kelley's shop out of business"".  He does not sell at a loss to force her out.  He doesn't do thngs to prevent her customers from shopping at her store, nor does he do anything to sabotage her promotions.  He simply has a much bigger selection at lower prices.  She unquestionably is more knowledgeable about and cares more deeply about books.  Wintess thr poignant scene after her shop closes and she vists his store for the first time.  The worker there is totally clueless about how to answer a customer's inquiry, while Kathleen knows all about the subject.  Witness the scene at the beginning, before Fox Books opens, where she has a children's story time.  Clearly, she offer much more, and more personal and heartfelt, service.  That isn't enough, though, to keep her business.  Her supposedly loyal customers and supporters pay her great lip service, but don't hesitate to voluntarily go to Fox Books to buy.  That's not Joe's ""fault"".  There's nothing ""wrong""  with how Kathleen is conducting her business.  She's making no ""mistakes"".  But, his business is thriving and hers is failing.  Sadly, that's what's happening throughout the country.  People may talk a good line about how they treasure the personal, small bookstores, but they're spending their dollars elsewhere.  In most areas of the country , the small owner-run stores, many multi-generational are disappearing not through the actions of the big stores, but because customers aren't supporting them.  This is handled extremely well in this move, almost better than the love story itself.  It doesn't just do a dollars and cents narrative, it demonstraes the impact of this phenomena on the people involved.  Kudos for addresing this in a bittersweet way, with an overlying ""sweet"" story to get the message to a greater audience.

One thing.  It's not hypocritical to be admiring the delivery of this message and yet be shopping at Amazon.  Amazon really ins't a threat to the small owner-run bookstore as much as it is a competitor to the large chains (Amazon wasn't even a serious player when this film came out).  Amazon is in many ways closer to the small book shops.  More information about each book, semi-personal service, the ability to share information and, before the lawyers got involved, the ability to browse through the books at your leisure.  Small bookstores that are making a go of it are working in their respective niches or in their small towns and people who shop at Amazon tend to patronize them as well.",1103241600,2,2939,4.973305954825462

1034243,5,6305368201,"I recently saw two films directed by Norah Ephron. This one and Sleepless in Seattle (1993). Both have held up remarkably well. Curious to know the background (if any) to You've Got Mail, I did a little research. Its basic plot can be traced back to Nikolaus Laszlo's play The Shop Around the Corner which was adapted in a film of the same name directed by Ernest Lubitsch in 1940, co-starring Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart. Then in 1949, it was recycled as a musical (re-named In the Good Old Summertime) co-starring Judy Garland and Van Johnson. What we have here is the latest version of Laszlo's original story, brought to the screen again with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in the lead roles. In fact, Hanks and Ryan had appeared previously (but together only briefly) in Sleepless in Seattle.

Here's the basic situation. Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) owns a small bookstore in Manhattan which is slowly being driven out of business by a major chain, Foxbooks, headed by Joe Fox (Hanks). The two have frequent encounters at a distance, over a period of time, and obviously begin to feel a mutual attraction without ever formally meeting. Meanwhile, they begin a daily e-mail correspondence during which they share personal information. It is important to keep in mind that they know each other only as NY152 and Shopgirl. Also that Joe is involved with Patricia Eden (Parker Posey) and Kathleen with Frank Navaskey (Greg Kinnear). Eventually, she must close the doors of her ""Shop Around the Corner"" and then....

When observing Hanks's performance again recently, I was fascinated even more because he combines some of the edge of his portrayal of Michael O'Sullivan in Road to Perdition (2002) with the innocence of Allen Bauer in Flash (1984) and as Forrest Gump (1994). Hanks is among the most talented and versatile of film actors. As for Ryan, she portrays Kathleen Kelly with precisely the right balance of spunk, decency, vulnerability, and wit. She is clearly the most sympathetic character in this film as she struggles to save her bookstore while searching for personal fulfillment as a woman. Ephron's supporting cast is first-rate, notably two of my favorite character actors, Dabney Coleman (Nelson Fox) and John Randolph (Schuyler Fox), as well as Posey, Kinnear, and Jean Stapleton (as Birdie). That said, Hanks dominates each scene in which he appears. There is never any doubt (at least in my mind) that Joe and Kathleen will overcome all the barriers and complications and find in each other what their respective lives have previously lacked. Yes, this is a ""feel good movie"" but that is true of all of the best romantic comedies. My guess (only a guess) is that Ernst Lubitsch would have enjoyed it as much as I did.

It is also worth noting that Ephron skillfully coordinates the plot developments with a soundtrack available on a CD which continues to sell very well. The selections include Puppy Song (Harry Nilsson), Dreams (The Cranberries), Splish Splash (Bobby Darin), Dummy Song (Louis Armstrong), Remember (Harry Nilsson), Dream (Roy Orbison), Rockin' Robin (Bobby Day), Lonely at the Top (Randy Newman), Signed,Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours (Stevie Wonder), I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City (Sinad O'Connor), Over the Rainbow (Harry Nilsson), Anyone At All (Carol King), I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself a Letter (Billy Williams),  The ""You've Got Mail"" Suite (George Fenton), and You Made Me Love You (Jimmy Durante).",1100736000,8,3466,4.981001727115717
1034244,4,6305368201,"Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have great chemistry onscreen, and in You've Got Mail they're wonderful together.  The plot is pretty simple.  Ryan plays Kathleen Kelly, the owner of a small children's bookshop; Hanks is Joe Fox, who owns the literary megastore that is nudging Kathleen's shop towards bankruptcy.  Face-to-face they do not get along, but unknowingly, they strike up a friendship online; it's an anonymous relationship, where they have the freedom of speaking their minds and hearts without knowing the other person's identity.  There's a twist when they chat online one evening and tentatively agree to meet in person.  It winds up being one of the movie's most painful scenes, but not because they immediately identify one another...

There's much to recommend in this movie, if you like romantic comedies and are a fan of Hanks and Ryan.  They're at their best here, and bolstered by a lively supporting cast.  You've Got Mail is also set in New York City - a definite plus - and better yet, alludes to some wonderful books (children's books mainly, but also Pride and Prejudice, which the film's plot echoes at times).",1091232000,5,1129,4.936507936507937
1034245,4,6305368201,"Here's the main and completely irrelevant reason to love this movie: New York City in the fall. Honestly, it should have no bearing whatsoever on the plot, but it does -- and it's impossible not to fall in love with the bright, sunshiny, orange-leaved sheer beauty of the city encapsulated in this movie. Without even resorting to shots of Central Park in all its glory (and really, who can resist that?), ""You've Got Mail"" takes you on a lovely scenic tour of the Upper West Side, Starbucks and all. Who can resist the street fairs, the parks, the stores, the dock? It's picture-perfect, and if it's a bit surreal, I won't admit it: New York really is rather lovely in the fall.
Aside from making me want to run away to the Big Apple and work in the children's section at Fox Books, ""You've Got Mail"" also features Meg Ryan at her most adorable (""Aren't daisies just the friendliest flower?""), Tom Hanks at his most charming, and a terrific supporting cast (Greg Kinnear and those typewriters!). The story, a modernized little ""remake"" of ""The Shop Around The Corner"", is more fairy tale than realism -- two people fall in love over email, in war in real life, and however can such a thing be solved -- but it's an enchanting story nonetheless. In a time when romance on the web seems all-too-seedy and in reality, sometimes frankly dangerous, this little tale of two people sharing their most intimate thoughts long before they share a single glance is like a breath of fresh air. Sure, the technology's a little faded, but the magic's still there.",1090195200,86,1550,4.660583941605839

The reason I dislike Ryan so much is because she seems to always play the same type of character in every movie, but in this case it works really well.  Ryan plays Kathleen Kelly, an independent bookstore owner who is being forced out of business by Fox Books, a large chain of stores (similar to Borders) owned by Joe Fox (Tom Hanks).  Kathleen and Joe run into each other several times, and even though they are attracted to each other at first, those feeling turn to mutual disgust as they engage in the battle of the books.  However, both Joe and Kathleen are in dead-end relationships, and they meet each other in a chat room and start communicating regularly via email, not knowing each other's true identity.  Joe eventually figures out the truth, and he has to decide if he wants to pursue these feelings that he's developed for Kathleen online, even though they can't stand each other in real life.
At first it bugged me that Joe played around with Kathleen for the second half of the movie, witholding information from her about who he really was.  However, there's really no other way he could have handled it: if he had told Kathleen the truth right away, she likely would have been disgusted by him and tossed him aside.  Instead Joe decided to test the waters with her and see if they could spark any real chemisty in real life and not just over the Internet.  The end result is pretty cliche, but the final scene will generate a lot of ""Awwws!"" from romantics in the audience.",1081555200,5,1720,4.4696485623003195

Meg Ryan plays third generation independent bookstore owner Kathleen Kelly.  When a brand new Fox Bookstore opens around the corner, Kathleen's bookstore is doomed by high volume low cost books.  Into Kathleen's bookstore comes none other than one of the owners of Fox Bookstore, Joe Fox (Tom Hanks).  Through a coincidence Joe and Kathleen meet on the internet and are soon e-mailing and chatting with each other regularly.  At first they do not know who each other is on the internet.  Joe then finds out that Kathleen is the women with whom he has been conversing on the internet.  Now the fun and silliness begins.
Joe talks in person with Kathleen, but in his early conversations Kathleen dislikes him for what he has done to her bookstore, which she regards as her heritage.  But eventually the two start to become friendly.  Joe teases Kathleen constantly about the person with whom she is communicating, and falling in love with, on the internet.  Kathleen defends her internet partner and becomes more attracted to him daily.  Joe gets to play both sides, and of course he then knows all the answers to the questions he asks each way.
My biggest dislike is that I thought Joe should have told Kathleen sooner that he was the person with whom she was communicating on the internet.  I saw Joe's hiding of the truth as tormenting Kathleen, which I saw as a bit cruel and manipulative.  Unfortunately, the premise of the movie, especially the ending, requires Kathleen not know it is Joe until the very end.
My other dislike is that Kathleen is obviously quite intelligent.  Yet she ignores the fact that Joe seems to be so predictive of what Kathleen's internet partner is saying and vice versa.  I would have thought that at least Kathleen should have been suspicious, but she does not seem to get suspicious until near the very end of the movie, when it was about time to resolve the deception anyway.
Of course, the whole point of the movie and the reason it works is that Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks have such likable honest charm and natural acting skill that they make you believe this situation could happen.  Once you've seen the wonderful, romantic ending you are willing to forgive that the basic premise of the movie is unrealistic.

If you bracket the disturbing political messages of the movie and just talk about the ""romantic"" part then, yeah, sure it's ok.  But...

I'd have to say that a 119 minute commercial for AOL, Starbuck's coffee and Giant MegaBookstore Corp. was just too much to bear.  What was Nora Ephron thinking?

The political message of You've Got Mail seems to be that corporate monoculture (as embodied by AOL/Starbucks/Barnes&Noble/etc.) is really just grand.  That if you're a small bookstore (or coffeestore owner, or whatever) owner trying to survive against mega-conglamorates that as long as you fall in love with the enemy that it's all ok.

Kathleen Kelly's (Meg Ryan's character) consciousness of the real political struggle facing small business owners is staggeringly shallow.  There is no small irony that she and Joe Fox (Hanks' character) can go to the same Starbucks and she is oblivious to the parallels between her choice of coffee and the choice she expects her customers to make when they buy books.

That irrepressible scene toward the end of the film when she loses her business and goes in to Joe Fox's Mega-Book Corp's store is enough to make one physically ill.  She sees, lo and behold, that Mega-Book Corp really can be a wonderful, caring place.  It's enough to make her forget that she's just lost her business she'd developed for years.  And the thing that moves her to this new state of unconsciousness?  Love for Mr. Joe Fox.  Wow!

I'm not saying that Nora Ephron needed to make a politically engaged story.  It is a romantic movie, after all.  But why a long commercial for conglamorates like AOL and Starbucks?",1079568000,26,1779,4.815181518151816

1034287,5,6305368201,"Sometimes Hollywood does something right in returning to the old fashion love story with layers of reference & meaning. Invite your special other, get the popcorn, & watch this well made chic flick.
This is Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan's third romantic comedy together. The first was ""Joe Versus the Volcano (1990)"" which was made before the duo were `Mega Stars' creating a mystical if not mythical movie about losing the American Dream with its dead end jobs & forced neurosis. Many people didn't understand that this movie was created as a farce, therefore it was not a box office hit. Then came ""Sleepless in Seattle (1993)"" with the ingenious writing & directing of Nora Ephron about a man who loses his loving wife to cancer promising he will never fall in love again while taking care of their only son, moving away from everything that reminds him of his lost. Until one night his son calls a talk radio station asking the radio host Dr Marcia Fieldstone to help his father get over his sleepless nights & find a new wife...this starts the whole story moving with references to an old Cary Grant movie ""An Affair to Remember (1957)"" creating layers of clever dialog & acting. This process of style is repeated with greater perfection on ""You're Got Mail"".
At first ""Sleepless in Seattle"" seems to be the better movie, because of its focused play out of ""An Affair to Remember"", but if you watch ""You're Got Mail"" several times, you will start to understand its more subtle & multi references, that it becomes a deeper film.
This time around the references are to the movies ""The Godfather (1970)"" & ""Shop Around the Corner (1940)"" intermixed with the newer upper social scene in New York City's `West Side' (another reference to `West Side Story'?). Tom Hanks plays Joe Fox (F-O-X) a multi millionaire businessman who views the movie ""The Godfather"" as the `I Ching' (a Chinese divination book of wisdom) as the business bible, overtaking his competition without being `Personal'. He is in a dead end relationship with the cruel, hurried, & self-focused book publisher Patricia Eden acted by Parker Posey. Meanwhile Meg Ryan plays Kathleen Kelly, a cute no-nonsense blonde who inherited her mother's children bookstore `A Shop Around the Corner'. She is also in a dead end relationship with the Heideggerian (a 20th century German Philosopher against technology) social commentator & typewriter lover Frank Navasky acted by Greg Kinnear. Now for the plot...
Both Joe Fox & Kathleen Kelly, one night on a fluke, met in an Internet chat room `Over 30' & become modern pen pals via the computer. Little do they realize that they live in the same neighborhood, sometimes walking by each other in the busy streets of New York City. Both are doing well in their business, but Joe Fox's fast growing large modern discount bookstore with cappuccino maker is building a new branch a few blocks away from Kathleen Kelly's small old fashion children's specialty bookstore. Joe Fox meets Kathleen Kelly in real life at her store when taking care of his younger stepbrother & his younger aged aunt. Joe Fox's stepbrother has just learned to spell his last name F-O-X, & Joe tries to hide the fact from Kathleen. Later they both meet at a book publishing party & Kathleen discovers `just call me Joe' is really Joe Fox (F-O-X). Lines are drawn & later war is declared as Kathleen's business fails. The developing plot & dialog become very humorous especially when Joe discovers his true love from the Internet is really Kathleen when they play out the movie ""A Shop Around the Corner"". All ends well when Kathleen puts it all together at the last touching scene.
There is more to this movie that makes it a repeatable watcher. If you become tried of it, put it away for a few months & return for added enjoyment.

Here's the deal: Ryan owns a little children's bookstore that's about to get gobbled up by a mega-chain owned by Hanks. She hates him and everything he stands for and is unaware that he's the yummy guy at the other end of an online romance that's moving toward an inevitable conclusion.
You know how it's going to end. You know it from the first opening credits. You know it at every step along the way. That the Ephron sisters (Delia and Nora) could write and direct this predictable movie in such a way that most viewers fall in love with it (well, the women viewers, anyway) is a testament to their talent - and that of Ryan and Hanks. You know in your gut what the final scene is going to be - and STILL you get all choked up and mushy and weepy.

I think a lot of us can relate to this movie, meeting someone online... not really knowing each other but always hoping they are wonderful in real life. In this case, they both obviously like each other online, but in real life have this professional opposition with the companies they own - with him putting her out of business, etc.

Starting up an internet friendship, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are unaware that they are confronting one another over the net, being that they are business rivals.  When Hank's superstore book chain business causes Ryan's small book shop to close, there is much sadness knowing that the small book store contained precious memories in which Ryan's mother passed it down to her daughter.

New York City never looked lovelier; the city takes on a cozy, small-town feel, where it seems perfectly possible for two strangers to meet and fall in love.

1034384,4,6305368201,"Tom Hanks made this movie right after he finished shooting ""Saving Private Ryan"", and it was a relief to finally see him in a light-hearted movie after all the serious movies that he's been in.  I have to admit that this isn't one of those movies that guys would want to see unless they're forced into buying/renting the movie to watch with their wife/girlfriend.  That's the reason I saw the movie, but I have to admit that it's entertaining.
This is the story of two people who have parallel relationships with each other.  On the one hand, each is an entrepreneur in the book business.  Hanks plays a character named Joe Fox, whose family owns a chain of very large bookstores.  Meg Ryan plays Kathleen Kelly, who owns a small ""mom-and-pop"" bookstore.  Joe has just opened one of his bookstores in the same neighborhood as Kathleen's store, and she's losing business as a result.  They quickly become adversaries, and Kathleen is very bitter that she's being forced out of business because of Joe's monopoly over the book-selling industry.  Kathleen lashes out at Joe and blames him for her failed business, while he maintains that it's ""just business"" and isn't personal.
On the other hand, these same two people are having an anonymous relationship with each other over the internet.  They met in a chat room and have been writing e-mails to each other ever since.  They trade stories about their lives and give each other comfort and advice.  They soon fall in love and decide that they should meet.  Joe finds out that his e-pal and Kathleen are the same person, and he struggles to decide on whether he should tell Kathleen that he is the one who has been e-mail her.
The two things that sets this movie apart from other romantic comedies (a.k.a chick flicks) is that it has two big-name stars, and both of them have previously acted together in another very successful romantic comedy called ""Sleepless In Seattle"".  Those two things are going to draw people to this movie, and once they've gotten their hands on ""You've Got Mail"", they'll be pleasantly surprised.",1042502400,3,2073,4.773109243697479

I laughed out loud at some of Hank's shenanigans.  He's still the hilarious, very original comedian he was back on the TV series ""Bosom Buddies.""  Now and then Meg Ryan seemed to be mimicing herself, but she's still one of my favorites.  I like ""Mail"" more each time I see it.  I especially like how they emphasize that while telling someone off may be satisfying at first, later you will regret it.

1034421,4,6305368201,"Two people build up a loving relationship by way of E-mail; she is the irresistible Meg Ryan displaying again her repertoire of quirky facial expressions and cute bodily mannerisms. She represents  everything a man wants, incorporating in her screen persona a childish playfulness with sense and intelligence. She is in fact a male fantasy; in real life you get either one attribute or the other never the two together.
Both leading characters are successful and wealthy, living an upmarket life style. It's another part of the fantasy and a necessary background to  all such romantic comedies; to have such a film set in the slums of New York would be too depressing; romantic fantasy figures must be part of the good-life we all aspire to and don't always achieve. We want for two hours to be immersed in the life-style of the cultured middle-class; to enjoy by proxy their large, brightly lit, clean apartments and their bright, civilised banter and to imagine that we are as attractive and intelligent as they are. It's part of what makes such films so enjoyable. And it's everyone's dream to marry a successful person; who wants failure? even if you are yourself a failure.
This film is very enjoyable largely due to the performance Meg Ryan. By way of her facial expressions and bodily movements, she supplies most of the visual comedy; the idiotic shadow boxing for instance when she is psyching herself up to do battle  with the  villain across the road, not knowing that he is in fact her on-line soul-mate. The way, in the opening sequence, and still  wearing her jim-jams, she perkily hops to the computer eager to receive the first E-mail of the day. So endearing. There is no other actress (actor?) who can pull off this kind of performance so beautifully. Not even Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock - though the latter might have a good try.
Anyone who says they dislike this film - and there are some - must be a cynic.
You could make all sorts of objections to this film, not least the incredible series of coincidences; 1) the fact that they are both wealthy and intelligent and perfectly suited; 2) the fact that they both happen to live round the corner from each other when in real life they could  have lived on the other side of the world; 3) the fact that she owns a shop across from his  huge multi-store; 4) the fact that they seem to get E-mails only from each other when in real  life we all have difficulty stemming  the  avalanche.

No, it is not nearly as good as the original, but given the fact that most remakes insult the originals, this one is to be commended for updating that 1940 film in refreshing fashion.
In THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, the Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan characters get to know each other by being pen pals, and get to detest each other by working together in a retail shop together.  The updating of this to E-mail is highly successful.  Some (I include myself in their number) will find themselves put off and bothered by the crass commercialism of this particular remake.  One wonders just how much money AOL had to contribute to this film to have influenced both the plot and the title.  On the other hand, it was interesting to see that Apple for once didn't manage to pay for the rights to have Macs used exclusively in a film (one rarely encounters Macs in Real Life, but in films, it seems as if everyone on the planet uses one--the power of product placement).  While Meg Ryan uses a Mac for her E-mail, Tom Hanks uses not only a PC, but also frequently an IBM Thinkpad.  The selection may have been symbolic:  a Mac for the literate, sensitive independent bookstore owner; a Thinkpad, symbol of America's corporate elite, for the heartless capitalist.
The movie works because we come to care about the two central characters, and because there are so many well-written scenes.  Many people have noted that Tom Hanks is about as close as we have gotten to Jimmy Stewart in a long, long time, and he was a perfect choice to play the male lead.  A lot of guys seem to really dislike Meg Ryan.  This baffles me.  I think she is as cute as a button, and like her even in some of her weaker roles.  Parker Posey is great as Hanks girlfriend in the first part of the movie and occasions the best line in the film:  ""She'd make coffee nervous.""  Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, I think I have disliked in every film in which I have seen him.  The supporting cast is somewhat uneven, but with supporting players like Steven Zahn, it definitely enhances the quality of the film.
After Ryan's shop has closed, she is lunching with her former employee and bookkeeper, played by Jean Stapleton.  The latter says that she is fine financially because she had investigated heavily in an Internet stock.  Seeing the film again in 2002, I wondered how badly her portfolio had done since then, and despite her being merely a character in a film, I found myself hoping that she was doing OK financially!

They both own bookstores, Meg's is a quaint little shop called conveniently, The Shop Around The Corner (Out of homage to the movie this was based on) that's been around for over 40 years, and Tom's is a book store owner who builds his store right next to Meg's, only his is a superstore that swallows The Shop Around the Corner in one big gulp.  The first time these two meet, it seems that they like eachother, but this is before she is informed that he is not just ""Joe"" as he introduced himself earlier, but ""Joe Fox"" of Fox Books who is putting her out of business! From then on, Meg hates him and avoids him at all costs.
 Tom then decides that it's time to meet his internet friend whom he's confided in and feels close to, but his friend turns out to be the person he LEAST wanted.
 Nora took careful note in choosing the music for the film. Most of it is oldies that really portray the behavior and the mood of the actors.  Songs from Harry Nilsson, Louis Armstrong, Bobby Darin and Stevie Wonder fill this film with character.
 Once again Tom and Meg portray their true chemistry and allow us to fall in love with them all over again.
 You've Got Mail is a simple love story modernized to fit the technolgy of today.  Just sit back, relax and zoom through the connection that Meg and Tom have together; through the internet and in person.",1024444800,2,1771,4.455108359133127
1034483,4,6305368201,"In response to the editorial review, Joe's logic in prolonging his concealment of his identity should be obvious to savvy viewers.  No matter what kind of chemistry shopgirl may have with ny151 online, ultimately it is Kathleen Kelly who will be meeting Joe Fox.  Joe wants to change Kathleen's attitude towards him so that she doesn't simply dismiss him when she finally meets him.  Also, I think perhaps there's a part of Joe that would like to woo Kathleen the old fashioned way, and get her to love him for who he really is (and in a sense despite who he is -- the man who put her out of business) as he partially states in his speech to her outside her apartment.  This is an admission about the limitations of online personas.  As far as the duration of the subterfuge, different people may have done it differently, but there's certainly nothing patently incredulous about how long Joe chose to delay.
Sure the plot is a bit fantastic, and represents NY in a positive light, but, hey it's a movie story, not a documentary.  Not the best movie ever, but delightfully told and thoroughly enjoyable.",1020902400,,1103,4.630769230769231
1034484,4,6305368201,"This is the second remake of ""The Shop Around the Corner"".  The first was Technicolor musical called ""In the Good Old Summertime"" which starred Judy Garland.  References to Miss Garland's most famous film ""The Wizard of Oz"" abound in ""You've Got Mail"" (Meg Ryan hanging ruby slippers on a Christmas tree and reading the book ""The Scarecrow of Oz"" while ill, the song ""Over the Rainbow"" being sampled throughout and sung in its entirety at the end, etc.) In addition to reminding me of the two previous versions, I was also reminded of ""Pillow Talk"".  In ""Pillow Talk"", Doris Day and Rock Hudson, who hate each other, fall in love over a party line without either realizing who the other is.  Here, it's Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks falling in love over the Internet.  The plot is lightweight and predictable, but the performances more than make up for that.  Dabney Coleman, Jean Stapleton, Greg Kinnear, and indie-queen Parker Posey are all brilliant, and although neither of the leading rolls are much of a stretch for Hanks or Ryan, they are at least likeable and have more than enough star power to make this picture work.  The script is light and funny, and this film is sure to please if you don't ask it to be more than it is.",1020470400,4,1227,4.575342465753424
1034485,3,6305368201,"You've Got Mail attempts to be a romantic comedy for the end of the 20th Century. Its device is the modern phenomenon of people's meeting over the Internet, but it basically follows a proven Hollywood formula that has been around for decades. In fact, this film is based on a little-known but superior love story called The Shop Around the Corner, made over fifty years ago.
Any picture with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan would be a money maker, because the public found them so perfectly matched a few years ago in Sleepless in Seattle, which itself owed a lot to another decades movie, An Affair to Remember.
While virtually all movie romances could happen only on screen, You've Got Mail is especially improbable. Kathleen [Ryan] and Joe [Tom Hanks] 'meet' in an AOL chat room. They begin exchanging E-mail, but never reveal much about their personal lives. Kathleen owns a children's book store on Manhattan's West Side. Joe and his family build book superstores. They are preparing to open one just a block from Kathleen's little operation.
When Joe and Kathleen meet at a party, they take an instant dislike to each other. Naturally, they do not know that they have become anonymously attracted to each other through the Internet. This is one of the oldest and most successful tricks in Hollywood's book. The audience becomes involved, because it knows a secret the characters do not.
What does not work here is Joe's character. We see that he uses his company to blithely put small independent stores, including Kathleen's, out of business. His father and his grandfather find this amusing, and Joe never shows any signs of disagreeing with them. Yet he becomes Mr. Nice and Mr. Wonderful by the end of the film, without there having been any scenes to truly justify this personality change. Perhaps love does conquer all, but I am not so sure I could fall for a person who wrecked my life, as Kathleen does. Writer and director Nora Ephron may have decided this, too. When the stars finally find out that they are the E-mail lovers, the sound track goes into ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow."" Gosh, folks, the song seems to say. It's only a movie.
You've Got Mail is impeccably filmed. Ryan and Hanks remain a great screen couple. They simply were not given that much to work with this time. Ironically, Nora Ephron write both Sleepless in Seattle and the even better movie While You Were Sleeping, which Ryan did with Billy Crystal. While You've Got Mail is a pleasant enough film, we would have expected more from such a creative team.
The supporting cast, especially Greg Kinnear and the remarkable comedienne, Posey Parker, is excellent. In certain scenes, their characters threaten to become more interesting than either Joe or Kathleen. Of particular note is the scene in which she is trapped in an elevator with Joe, the elevator operator, and a high society matron. She, Kinnear, Jean Stapleton and Dabney Coleman provide the humor that is oddly absent when Hanks and Ryan are on screen.",1016841600,3,2992,4.8116504854368936

Not since Tom and Meg meat on ""Sleepless in Seattle"" this story will bring tears to your eyes and a feel for romance in New York.

1034517,3,6305368201,"There's something in the genre of New York City romance comedies that flashes all that is likely to happen in first few scenes.  These films have emerged with excruciating regularity.  The theme is universal - the clash of the wealthy and powerful with the small and weak.  The weak always manage to triumph, usually by falling in love with their adversary.  In this case, the only novelty to the theme is the introduction of the modern touch of the Internet.  Hanks and Ryan are anonymous cyber-correspondents.  Unknown to each other, they are both in the book selling trade - Hanks with a monster chain store, Ryan inheritor of a tiny children's bookstore.  Reversing the roles might have generated greater interest and modernized the film.  The plot is simply the erosion of the pair's mutual anonymity.  And the film isn't ""given away"" by that revelation.
Tom Hanks, with his usual fine talent, strives admirably to lift the role from the mundane.  The story's plot and the dialogue he's given to work with betray that endeavour.  He's left with delivering his lines with his usual expressive skill, but the text is too weak to support his talents.  Ryan, whose acting depth is on the order of the thickness of Scotch Tape [Reg'd TM], starts with a crumbling foundation on which little can be built.  The downtrodden small shopkeeper image has been done too often, and Ryan hasn't the ability to add anything new to the role.  Perhaps that's not possible after so many renditions.
The most fascinating aspect of this film is Hanks' image variations depending on whether he's with Ryan, alone or with someone else.  With Ryan he seems to withdraw into a shell of subtlety, not because of his ""growing love"" but because he would outshine her too glaringly if he didn't.  He certainly breaks the standard image of the blustering corporate executive when with Ryan, but we have no basis for understanding why he changes.  Whether he managed to be subdued on his own initiative or because Ephron coached him to take this approach remains an unknown, but fascinating, question.
If you're an aficionado of urban romantic comedy, this film will definitely appeal.  It provides a low-key fantasy into which the undiscerning may readily escape.  The story builds gently, and even the early confrontations of the protagonists aren't harsh.  Everybody's ""civilized,"" even in their confrontations.  Ryan fans will sympathize with her struggle to keep her bookstore intact.  She's practiced the role of downtrodden woman so often, it's second nature with her now.  Much of the supporting cast add fervour to an otherwise insipid story.  Dabney Coleman is always welcome as a low level, usually corporate villainous figure.  Greg Kennear also adds some sparkle.  The real prize, as she often is, is Jean Stapleton.  Watching her made me wish Ephron had given her the lead over Ryan.  Stapleton would have given
feeling to an otherwise vapid presentation.",1011225600,,2943,4.987679671457905
1034518,5,6305368201,"If you laughed at ""When Harry Met Sally,"" and cried at ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" then ""You've Got Mail"" is a movie that you're going to love. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll fall in love with these quirky, witty, adorable characters.
Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan), a headstrong, set in her ways kind of gal, has a wonderfully normal life. She owns a successful bookstore (formally her mothers) and leads a sophisticated lifestyle. That is, until she turns on the computer, logs on, and waits for those three little words: ""You've got mail."" Finding a charming friend on the Internet makes her live out her day in anticipation for what 'NY152' has to say. Unfortunately, Kathleen's normal life turns into total chaos when a chain superstore threatens her job.
Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) is your typical cutthroat businessman. He's charming. He's witty. He's ruthless. He's out to make a buck and let no one stand in his way. Yet, behind all of his character flaws lies a man deeply intrigued by a sweet, funny `Shopgirl'. With his mind on business and his heart on e-mail, Joe has to consider the repercussions to his actions in a colliding matter of business and love when he comes to discover `Shopgirl's' true identity.
Falling in love has never been so sweet. Watching the way Kathleen and Joe go from mortal enemies to completely perfect for each other is an adventure that you will adore. I've seen this movie countless times and I never fail to laugh, and cry, at this engaging storyline. I may know the script word for word and expect a particular hand gesture here and silly stance there, but each time is a new adventure. If you crave a good comedy and are a sucker for romance, watch ""You've Got Mail"" and fall in love over and over again.",1011225600,6,1741,4.6558441558441555
1034519,4,6305368201,"Actually I don't like romantic comedies because of the icing that covers them all but You've Got Mail is a sweet movie with great actors and a cute story. I remember I didn't watch it at the movies when it came out but I got a terrible cold in the fall of 1999 so I had to stay home and my bother rent me this one from the video store. I thought why on earth I would like to watch it but I was wrong - because in the end I liked it and watched it for another 2 times the next 5 days.
The story is a classic one: big fish eats little fish and little fish tries to survive but she can't. In the end little fish falls head-over-heels for big fish and they live happily everafter. What's new then? It's in the title: they know each other very well because they email each other every day but don't know that they're after each other until a certain point in the movie when everything goes crazy... that was fun.
The actors did a wonderful job. Everybody knows that the chemistry between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan works well but this time it isn't such a straight line that leads to loving each other than in a previous movie (Sleepless In Seattle). Supporting cast is great, too. Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey and Dave Chapelle are on the same level as Hanks and Ryan.
The movie is a good one because you really don't know till the happy ending what will happen next (you know after all how it is going to end - in this genre happy ending is obligatory). Kudos to the screenplay writers, they did a great job, they managed to create some level of uncertainity so when the movie ends you have a pretty good feeling that the heroes found each other, after all the bad (and good) things. While this isn't the movie of the year it is worth watching anytime you feel down, you are ill, etc... it will cheer you up. And this is why we watch comedies.",1009843200,,1834,4.169014084507042

All the rest is silence. It's easy to be a mean critic and tough to be a kind one. I will say that Tom Hanks does not give a shallow performance, but how ""nice"" can these two clandestine Internet penpals be when they're sneaking in a little flirtation on the side while living with unknowing partners, both? Huh? Director Nora Ephron comes from a family of sceenwriters, and that's her niche, not directing. In this film, it is clear that she is limited to acting out what she wants her actors to do, rather than coaxing performances out of them. The camera shots are calculated, the reactions ""dated"" of all things, and what comes as most of a shock to me, Meg Ryan's body is dressed in very tight clothes, so that you notice how thin she is...almost too thin. So is Nora Ephron. So is the plot. It has to be handled with sensitivity. James Stewart had the Tom Hanks part in the old movie version and Margaret Sullivan the Meg Ryan role. They were older and looking for love. This couple is looking for something, but love isn't the end and the beginning for them. It's nice that they reconcile at the end, but it's all so predictable, and there's so little at stake, that who cares? I didn't, and I love the story.

The story of _You've Got Mail_ is really just a modern retelling of _The Shop around the Corner_ . So instead of an Assistant Manager and a Co-Worker, who don't like each other, being pen-pals and falling in love, we have The Creator of a Barnes&Noble clone and the owner of a little book store, who don't like each other, sending e-mails to one another. Tom Hanks, as Joe Fox, and Meg Ryan, as Kathleen Kelley, do a wonderful job pulling this off. Still I think this movie is made as much by the supporting cast as it is by the leads.

Director Nora Ephron, who also did Sleepless in Seattle,  again gives these two fantastic actors a simple story and setting to let their characters take life.
The plot in this film is pretty simple.  When the audience meets Joe Fox(Hanks) and Kathleen Kelly(Ryan) they have been having a secret relationship via email after meeting in a internet chat room.  After that there lives begin to unfold, Joe's family business is Fox Books, a corporate chain of stores that sell books for cheap and specialize in running smaller book stores out of business.

I know that I shouldn't be hinting at the ending, but as this is a light, romantic comedy starring down-to-earth Tom Hanks and girl-next-door Meg Ryan, anyone who doesn't know--in the most general sense, of course--what happens in the end has probably not seen a movie in over a decade.
The love-on-line angle is not the real story, but the framework. The real story is about how Mr. Chain Store meets Miss Sole Proprietor and how they have to reconcile love and business. Yes, we romantics want them to end up together, live happily ever after, yadda, yadda, yadda . . . but we also want the princess to have her own store--or at least her own life--after marriage.
As for the framework, it had some loose ends, a lot of subplots that the screenwriter and director didn't follow through to the end. For instance, what was the deal with Tom Hanks' ""wicked stepmother"" and ""American family""? Why did they get so much attention when they didn't influence the plot beyond Hanks and Ryan's first meeting in her bookstore? They took up a lot of film that could have been used for a satisfying denoument.
After doing such a great job of showing how beautiful New York is in the fall, the winter and the spring (thereby, I've heard, not really showing New York at all), both the director and the set designers neglected New York in the summer. (Though I barely noticed because my eyes kept wandering to the costumes, which were even more fabulous than the sets.) Unlike ""Sleepless in Seattle"", which even has a better soundtrack, ""You've Got Mail"" doesn't come full circle.

1034638,5,6305368201,"There are a couple of things this film has going for it. First is the chemistry between the on-screen characters. There's a reason Hanks and Ryan were casted for this flick- it's because audiences (including myself) like to see the sparks between these two people. They were a great team in Sleepless in Seattle, and it's pretty obvious the 'magic' is still there.
The soundtrack to this movie is absolutely incredible. Harry Nilsson is perfect (the puppy song, over the rainbow), and the rest of the songs fit so well with the mood of the movie at all times. Sinead O'Conner's addition (I think it's called the lord must live in NY city) adds to the mood I talk about later, and Carol King's Anyone At All is one of the best romantic songs I've ever heard/played.
The mood to the movie is always incredibly upbeat- which is strange- most movies have their lulls or depressing moments. This movie, however, never gets itself in that rut. It's always very very cheery and bright. Although some may hate that, I can do nothing but appreciate the change of style. Everytime I watch You've Got Mail, I just think, ""I WANT TO GO TO NEW YORK!!!""
Overall, the movie just makes you feel good. It's one of my favorite movies, and is certainly my most favorite romantic film. Even techies won't get annoyed, because thank goodness the focus isn't aol or anything of that matter.",982886400,8,1368,4.633744855967078

Tom Hanks is his likable self, and Meg Ryan is the usual. I don't care for her and do not see why people are so stuck on her. She is cute, but she overacts in a way that just... bothers me. I think the concept of this picture arrives at a timely moment when many people are finding themselves meeting via computers and using technology to aid in their personal lives, which grow busier and busier as technology grows more pervasive. It also comes at a time in history when the concept of the bigger and cheaper chains overrunning the small, independent businesses is commonplace. Ryan plays Kathleen Kelly, an independent bookstore owner who struggles when Hanks's big mega chain bookstore, Fox Books, opens around the corner from Kelly's store. (Ironically Kelly's railing against the homogenization of the world parallels the way movies of this nature are made. The industry is so obsessed with making a profit that they will reuse the same story over and over and the public is gullible to buy it over and over). In person, the pair have an adversarial relationship. Online, not knowing that they are speaking to each other... not really knowing who they are speaking with, they basically fall in love. Meanwhile both have relationships in real, non-electronic mail lives... Hanks with the incomparable indie darling Parker Posey (he splits up with her after they have been stuck in an elevator and she starts freaking out because she cannot find her Tic Tacs) and Ryan with a splendid Greg Kinnear. It is a feel good movie above all, although the important issues of online communication AND corporations ruling the world are serious issues that can be debated in some other venue. Also nice... Dabey Coleman as Tom Hanks's father and also Jane Adams for only moments as a tv host-interviewer who captures Kinnear's heart during an interview. (The keen indie movie follower and Frasier fan will know Adams as Niles's plastic surgeon girlfriend Mel. They will also recognise her bit part in Wonder Boys as the pregnant waitress Oola and as the down on her luck character who never quite wins in the disturbing Happiness).",982368000,,2401,4.901719901719901

The story is fun, albeit shallow at times.  The plot is not put forward convincingly enough---the rich multi-millionnaire, owner of chain bookstore meets a burgeoise petite shop owner, falls in love just because they, so happens, meet in the cyberspace too.  Eventually, they find that they do not love the one they already had, but love the one who is a business rivalry.
Well, some would buy the story but some would not.  With hindsight, the internet may not have passed the high time at the time the film is released in 1998.  The email interface in the film can even be said as ""unreal"" and kiddy.

I found the movie just pleasant enough not to take too seriously; Ryan and Hanks have great chemistry; and I'm a sucker for New York location movies.  My favorite parts were Hanks' riff on The Godfather and the look on his face when Ryan told him he was nothing more than a suit.  (At that moment, I became aware of how far Hanks has come as an actor, how much more depth he gave to his performance than Ryan could give hers.  As one critic said when it was first released, look at the facial expressions on each of them when they're typing -- you can see how effortlessly Hanks conveys his thoughts, whereas Ryan mugs as if her monitor were a vaudeville audience.)
My biggest complaint--and I had the same complaing about Sleepless in Seattle, but to a lesser degree--is that Ephron relies too much on familiar songs to trigger emotions the story itself should be supplying.  And since the story does supply them, the music is really unnecessary.  She all but sabotaged the entire project for me when the finale was suddenly disrupted by ""Over the Rainbow.""

Let me say that I enjoyed it up to and including the point that Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) found out that it was Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) who was ""Shopgirl"", his anonymous e-mail confidant. I thought that at that point, if he really loved her, he would have fought for what she truly valued, namely her bookstore. He would have taken on the dragon, his own corporation, in some fashion to help her achieve her dream of passing the bookstore to her child. But he doesn't do that. In fact he (or the movie) gets clumsy and a little too childish. Although I like Hanks, I don't like the character he plays in this movie. He is unable to tell her what he feels, but instead leads her along in an unrealistic, childish way. And how real is it that she never catches on to who he really is? Although I like Ryan, her character is a little too unbelievable. The movie says a lot more about the power of the modern-day corporation than it does about love. If her love for the Shop Around the Corner is real, as it was depicted, can she so easily give up how she really feels when she finally realizes who her secret pal is?",975369600,3,1195,4.292035398230088

Tom Hanks is a Master Actor who gives us, once again, an excellent performance. His gestures, movements and the imitations to segments from ""The Godfather"", show us just how much he is capable of delivering in his job. His chemistry with Meg Ryan is absolutely fantastic, you can see they really enjoy working together and this is, no doubt, what makes over 80% of the movie succesful. I don't think Meg Ryan is a great actress per se, but she shines in this kind of movie, she really does. The movie takes place in none other than art mecca New York City, Hanks playing the part of a bookstore magnate, just opening a huge bookstore on the Upper West Side, leaving small bookstore owners like Ryan (who owns a charming children's bookstore ""just around the corner"") very much out of business. There's a parallel in their personal lives as well: a relationship through e-mail that don't know about... just yet. The comedy keeps developing, supported by great actors like Greg Kinnear, Jean Stapleton and Parker Posey. Typical New York landmarks are also displayed as a setting, such as the wonderful food store ""Zabar's"" (extremely expensive but full of delicacies), ""Cafe Lalo"" (much more intimate than today's ""Starbucks""), and ""Grey's Papaya"", where the most delicious hot dogs are said to be found. This movie not only will appeal to fans of the Hanks-Ryan duo, but to booklovers as well, since it revolves all around the book world, depicting the big problems that the advent of the big bookstores (such as ""Barnes & Noble"" and ""Borders""), represented for the smaller bookshops that have been around forever.",973209600,15,1719,4.830508474576271

Needless to say, even Hanks couldn't carry this god-awful mess.  The dialogue is so sappy and forced you tend to wonder how Hanks could pull off his lines with a straight face.  Meg Ryan dials in her usual ""look how cute I am!"" performance.
Here's the plot: Hanks is involved in a buyout of the bookstore where Ryan works.  Unknowingly, Hanks and Ryan engage in a cyber relationship and slowly fall in love.  A good premise, but in the hands of the overrated Ephron it falls flat.

Here's the story. Kathleen Kelly(Meg Ryan) is engaged in an online relationship with an anonymous identity and they chat a lot and converse about their love life, work, and other problems. Sounds pretty realistic, huh? Well Kathleen owns a small bookstore called The Shop on the Corner and her online buddy is Joe Fox, the owner of Fox Books, that has incidentily moved to the location just down the street. But she doesn't know who that he owns Fox Books from chatting with him online. A little twist in a lighthearted comedy, eh? Well, this is when the plot starts to get predictable, they meet and initially hate each other, but still are friends online, they both break up with their respective significant others, they meet, but only Fox realizes she's the one he's been chatting with online, Kathleen is oblivious. Then they start going out, develop a relationship, and at the end they meet and their is that moment of tenderness. Kinda saw it coming, didn't you?

In the movie, Meg & Tom made it possible for people to trust one another & even become the best of friends over the Internet.

Most obviously,  Ryan and Hanks actually have a real life relationship throughout the course  of the movie, not just a brief meeting at the end.  Also the supporting  characters are more satisfying.  They do a generally better job than  SEATTLE's to help us understand what Hanks and Ryan are looking for, and  why it seems to take an inordinate length of time for them to drop the  cyber charade and come clean.  Each of the major supporting characters has  a role to play in pushing the two characters towards their ultimate  destiny.  To be sure, the character types are quite similar to those found  in SLEEPLESS, but they're somehow more fully realized here.  Jean  Stapleton, Greg Kinnear and Dabney Coleman are all interesting voices that  we want to hear.
But I think what I like the most about MAIL is that  though the film is purportedly a remake of THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, the  love story is strangely more akin to SUPERMAN.  Ryan is Lois Lane, having  to fall in love with Hanks' Clark Kent, a man who is the opposite of  everything she admires.  Yet if affection can grow, Hanks will reveal his  true identity and let her meet her cyber hero.  In short, it's an  unoriginal device done creatively.
And that's pretty much what all great  romance is.

1034741,5,6305368201,"Perhaps the first time I watched this movie, I would have related more to the characters if I had been online at the time.  The truth is, I was so  busy writing, I didn't even think about it.  After being online for about 6  months, I realized how emotionally attached people can become through  e-mail.  I think friendships can be made online very easily, however, you  could also fall in love, as my friend from college did.  She is marrying  her soul mate this November.  I watched this video while on vacation and  saw it through different eyes and with a whole new set of experiences to  relate to.

This movie is now one of my absolute all-time favorite  romantic comedies.  Tom Hanks (dashing as always) plays Joe Fox who  anonymously writes to Kathleen Kelly (played by Meg Ryan and cute as ever).  They exchange e-mails and in the process also share secrets, divulge their  true selves and rely on each other for advice.

Both Joe and Kathleen  believe they can protect their identities until one of them decides they  should meet.  Kathleen is a sweet, intellectual, funny woman who is the  owner of a well-established children's book store.  Suddenly her life  changes dramatically when her business is threatened by a super bookstore.

There is a warmth and character about this movie.  The scenes are  memorable, funny and sometimes magical.  The chemistry between Joe and  Kathleen is at first cold and they show intense dislike for each other.  Does this ""hatred"" turn into an equally passionate, yet more  pleasant emotion?

Although much of the movie revolves around bookstores,  it is in no way ""bookish.""  This is a story about two people in  the real world who have entered the Internet Fantasy Land and are looking  for ""the dream of someone.""  Both of them are in relationships  with people with whom they have much in common, but for whom they do not  feel love.

Joe Fox plays clever little mind games with Kathleen when he  finds out her secret.  The book and the red rose tell him all he needs to  know, yet he seems intent on finding out more.

This movie is definitely  funnier on video for some reason.  OK, I must confess!  I went away for a  quiet peaceful weekend to a log cabin and after watching this movie, I was  compelled to write a review.  I had to tell you how enchanting this movie  was.  It is the perfect movie for a couple on a weekend trip or for anyone  who is a hopeless romantic.

Obviously,  with 277 reviews on this film (sadly, I couldn't read them all) at the time  I am writing mine, what in the heck can I add?  Absolutely nothing, it's  all been said, but then again, Amazon (bless their hearts) allows me to  blabber on for a thousand words should I so desire.
All that's been said,  I can concur.  It does get too cute at times.  New York seemed unbelievably  clean, the weather unusually bright and cheery, the streets and sidewalks  strangely void of traffic and crime, and yes, it has all been done many  times before.  You know what?  I think it was planned that way.  ""You've  Got Mail"" is a modernized version of Jimmy Stewart's ""Shop Around the  Corner"", and the two are quite different (""Mail"" has almost a fantasy feel  to it), yet, surprisingly, the basic story IS there.  Kathlene Kelly (Meg  Ryan) even has a book store named ""Shop Around the Corner"" thus paying  homage to the original.
""You've Got Mail"" starts by showing New York  through the clean, simple, uncluttered eyes of computer graphics.  And from  that opening scene, all the way to the end, this film is punctuated  meticulously with music and song that fits perfectly with each mood.  I  derived the most pleasure through these small nuances.  Hanks and Ryan are  two fine actors, and their eyes conveyed just the right amount of emotional  impact and at just the right moments.
So yes, this film DID work for me,  and in the same way ""Sleepless in Seattle"" worked for me.  I took this  little fantasy joyride and had fun.  And through all the light-hearted (and  sometimes bland) cuteness, there surfaced a sort of simple honesty that I  found endearing.

1034745,5,6305368201,"To those who are won't to put forth the proposition that ""They don't make `em like they used to,"" I have a rejoinder:  The two best romantic comedies ever made, EVER, have come our way since 1998; one of them is ""You've Got  Mail,"" an absolute delight of a movie directed with heart-felt care and  finesse by Nora Ephron.  It's the story of two people who meet in a chat  room on the Internet; Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) is the owner of a chain of  bookstores, and Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is the owner of a small,  independent children's book store called ""The Shop Around The Corner,""  whose continued existence is threatened by the  Fox superstore which offers  discounts and cappuccino.  Harsh competitors in the real world, they are  able to connect with one another via the net only because of the anonymity  provided by cyberspace, where neither has a clue as to whom the other  really is.  The charismatic Hanks delves beneath the businessman veneer  of Fox to give him some real humanity; he's tough in the trenches of  commerce, but he makes it clear that this is a guy whose interests range  beyond the bottom line.  Hanks lends a natural, self-assurance and charm  that makes Fox a complete character, and one you can't help but like.  And  Meg Ryan has never been better than she is here as Kathleen Kelly, a role  she was born to play.  As soon as you meet her, you feel as though you've  known her a long time; she is so open, wears her heart on her sleeve and  has a vulnerability and benevolence to her nature that make her totally  endearing.  Ryan imbues her with a joy and warmth that is almost tangible,  and she plays her with nuance that is distinctly drawn and which makes her  unique from any character she's ever done before.  There's a real chemistry  between her and Hanks, and Ryan utterly lights up the screen with her  winsomeness.  There's a terrific supporting cast on hand here as well,  which includes Greg Kinnear (Frank), Parker Posey (Patricia), Heather Burns  (Christina), Steve Zahn (George) , Jean Stapleton (Birdie), David Chappelle  (Kevin), Dabney Coleman (Nelson Fox) and John Randolph (Schuyler Fox).  This is a great story, with outstanding performances by all, the dialogue  is crisp and witty, and it's all put together and delivered so well, and  with such style and class by Ephron that it makes ""Sleepless In Seattle,""  (an excellent movie in it's own right) seem like a mere warm-up for this  team.  The music, with the choice of songs and the specific scenes into  which they are inserted, is just another reason this film works so well.  The musical interludes, which set Hanks and Ryan at different stages of  their relationship against the backdrop of New York City, are entirely  effective; the city comes alive during these scenes and adds further  character to the overall ambience of the movie.  ""You've Got Mail"" is quite  simply the second best romantic comedy ever made, and it should have walked  away with a basketful of Oscars, especially for Meg Ryan's performance.  And anyone who comes away from this one thinking differently is jaded and  needs some serious help (and I say that with a smile, folks), because this  is one terrific movie that must not be missed.

They bicker endlessly, but begin to fall in live  even before they realize they had been writting to each other the whole  time.

So do I like it?  Sure... what's not to like? Do I think it's a great film? Nope.
YOU'VE  GOT MAIL is definitely a very pleasant viewing experience... when you've  got a couple hours to kill. I'm told it made a great ""date film""  when it was showing in the theaters. It sure beats SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE,  which was way too lame, sappy and far-fetched for my tastes. Of course,  (need I say it?) Meg Ryan is every  ""over-30-single-straight-guy's"" fantasy and Tom Hanks is the  witty, urbane type that every male New Yorker aspires to be.  The  ""Oh-So-New-York"" references were entertaining the first time  'round, but got old pretty quickly. I would love to know how they were able  to close down Zabar's long enough to film the cash register scene without  causing a riot. Also, I have to wonder what kind of filter they used on the  camera lens to make ""the City"" look so neat and tidy... I mean  the background scenery was  downright pretty (the local realtors must  really love this flick). And just what did they do with all the homeless  folks you usually see on those streets?
This story did strike a personal  note: I was working on the Upper West Side, where the film takes place,  when Barnes & Nobles opened it's megastore in the neighborhood in the  early '90s. Yup, there were quite a few quaint little bookstores that  ""bought it"" as a result, just like in the movie... though I can  just picture  the owners of those unfortunate stores and their laid-off  employees, scratching their heads in incredulous wonder, as they try to  figure out the reasoning behind the movie's apparent message that corporate  ruthlessness, greed and monopoly makes for a happy ending.

Even at thirtysomething she is cute enough  to fawn over, bless her heart; and Jean Stapleton as her bookkeeper and her  mother's bookkeeper-adorable.  The clever old gal even bought Intel at  six-just adorable!  And can Tom Hanks ever handle this?  Play a male lead  with property and money and a bad dye job?  Piece of cake.  I mean, just  behave and you are plenty eligible and totally adorable yourself.  Throw in  a dog and some cute kids and a fairy tale New York, and what have you got?  You've got corn syrup!  That's what you've got.  My lord, even Dabney  Coleman is cute in this!  (And don't you just love the way his bad dye job  mustache matches Hanks' bad dye job hairdo?)
This is a diabolical,  cynical seduction of sappy-hearted lovers everywhere.  Indulge.  This is  femme porn.  Bring a box of Kleenex (actually the Ephrons anticipated this  and put a few on screen, bless their hearts) and some bon-bons.  Know that  the female lead will find true love, money and life-long security  simultaneously after going through some real fun misdirections en route.  Muggers in New York?  AIDS?  Cockroaches?  Crack cocaine?  Summer swelters?  Dirty snow?  Garbage strikes?  Smelly, polluted Hudson?  Odoriferous  poverty?  I mean, get real!  Even the two roommates that our lovers dump  are going to live happily ever after.  Do we experience heartaches?  Does  love bite?  Diss off!  This is the yellow brick road in Olde New York, and  it feels just like mainlining heroin.
Best line: As Hanks reveals himself  to Meg he uses her email handle and says, ""Don't cry, Shopgirl"" while the  sound track prompts our tears with ""Somewhere over the Rainbow.""  I mean,  this is a BIG HANKY kind of movie!

The rivalry and dislike between the lead characters  was well portrayed, but I didn't like the way Hanks' character discovered  her identity and then decided to withhold his knowledge. He seemed to be  sneering at her.
The scene where Meg Ryan looks around Hanks' bookshop  was very strange, too: what was the point of that? Was she supposed to be  finding out that big is not necessarily bad? If so, why was that not  referred to at all later?

This film is so unbearably cute, so much, that I can't help but smile and actually laugh while watching the movie, even  when nothing funny is happeining. I just love the potrait of Christmas time  in small-city-suburbian New York. The setting is just too good; snow,  christmas lights, cozy book stores, light/heavy traffic, walks in the  little parks, trees, moody music, and, well, everything else. This goes  hand in hand with the acting. The acting is impeccable -- Meg Ryan and Tom  Hanks actually look like they really belong together, and thus, the joyus  spirt runs abundant throughout the entire film. There's really no way you  can hate it; you have to love it. It's too cute(even for a guy like me) to  look over. Watch it, like it.",945388800,,845,4.655405405405405

The only negative comment that I have about  this movie is that I feel that the language content is not something that a  PG audience should be exposed to.

1035120,4,6305368201,"Me, being a hater of romantic comedies, somehow surprised myself with ""You've Got Mail"".  There was something about this film that has always peaked my interest, so after much hesitation, I finally broke down  and rented it.  Yes, I agree with one reviewer that it is extremely slow  moving at times, but if you get caught up in the characters lives, the  sluggish pace doesn't seem to matter much.  This movie strings you along,  one close call after another, while you are often wondering, will these two  ever meet?  You want them to meet.
I also liked some of the other  characters in the film.  I enjoyed the girl playing Meg Ryan's friend from  the bookstore (her co-worker). One of my favourite lines in the movie was:  ""did you have cyber-sex with him?""  ""no"" Meg Ryan  retorts.  ""Good, coz they don't respect you afterwords"" the girl  replies.  How funny!  What I don't understand is everyone talking about the  ""chemistry"" of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. It even says that on the  box.  I think if you pair any two good actors together there will be  chemistry, not just Tom and Meg.
Another great thing about the film is  the music!  I absolutely love that song ""God Must Be In NYC"".  (Both versions).
The end of the film is a tear jerker.  (So the slow  pacedness thoughout the movie is a pay off at the end). :0)",945129600,,1320,4.478813559322034

They are a combination that although Hollywood (Nora Ephron) put  together, it is obvious that Heaven had a part in the pairing.

There is a place in the movie where the shopgirl/owner,  Kathleen Kelly/MegRyan,  closes her children's book store door  for the  final time.  Kathleen Kelly  has lovely memories of growing up,  going to  work in  that store with her mother and ""twirling"" in the back  corner.  In fact,  there is a picture of her ""twirling"" with  her mother on the wall.  At the ""close out sale""  you might  notice that picture of Kathleen and her mother twirling,  and a sign pasted  on the frame  saying, ""not for sale!""
When Kathleen  closes  the door of the ""Shop Around the Corner"" for this final time,  now totally empty of books and chairs and pictures on the walls, she  removes the large bell of brass from the door,  turns off the lights;  she  takes a final look back and for a brief moment she  ""sees""  that memory of her mother twirling her as a child.  She hears the music.  It is a most precious moment.  It is enchanting.
I told Naomi Roseanna  that she always needs to remember that part of the movie.

The music is the  other problem - what was with playing ""Somewhere Over The  Rainbow""??? How is THAT romantic??  Maybe it's just me, but I feel  that the music of a movie lends a lot of feeling to it - it may have helped  many of the ""flat"" scenes.

Personally, I usually like the  more modern remakes like the new Sabrina and A Perfect Murder, but Shop  Around the Corner is a nearly perfect movie that they destroyed with this  picture.

1035538,5,6305368201,"YOU'VE GOT MAIL is a wonderful romantic comedy for adults.  There have been a lot of first-class versions of this material, including a B&W non-musical version from Ernst Lubitsch in 1940 (The Shop Around the  Corner) and a 1949 color musical version starring Judy Garland and Van  Johnson (In the Good Old Summertime).  Even as a big fan of James Stewart,  Margaret Sullavan, Garland and Johnson, I think I prefer Meg Ryan and Tom  Hanks the most.
YOU'VE GOT MAIL is basically a color version of THE SHOP  AROUND THE CORNER, but without a despairing adultery and suicide attempt  subplot.  And the script expertly rethinks the material for 1990's  Manhattan.  Hanks and Ryan no longer work in the same novelty shop as  secret letter correspondent lovers.  Ryan is now the manager of ""The  Shop Around the Corner"" for rare books; this eliminates both the  adultery and the attempted suicide from the 1940 version.  Hanks is the son  of a contractor building the equivalent of a Barnes & Noble that will  put Ryan's store out of business.  So we now have something really  interesting--business competitors who are secretly in love.  And since this  is the 1990's, e-mail is now the writing device for their letters.
This  is a lovely film, pleasantly old-fashioned, and acted to perfection by two  very appealing stars.  And its apartment e-mail plot should make it even  better on home video.  The finale sent me into the stratosphere, it's so  exquisitely romantic.  YOU'VE GOT MAIL is an absolute ""must-see""  that does honor to its very good predecessors.
