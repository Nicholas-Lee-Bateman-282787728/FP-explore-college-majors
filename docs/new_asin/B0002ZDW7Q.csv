2152186,1,B0002ZDW7Q,"Now usually, when some people say a movie is terrible, it can be a matter of opinion...after Ring Virus (korean Ringu remake)got some bad reviews I thought I'd see for myself and although some disturbing changes, this is not the case here.

Wow. This movie takes place backwards. You see the end first, then chapters are revealed in reverse and you realize ""oh, the characters KNOW each other in some way!"" I thought at first it was random characters random encounters with this weird ghost like mini stories and I almost turned it off..

Anyways, there are no surprises, everything is drawn out so long that you know what's next- just not the order! Most pathetic was the ghost and noises. Trying to remain neutral, but sounded just like The Grudge! When the show the ghost- she is crawling through the theater like she died right after watching The Grudge or The Grudge 2 of course. By chapter 1, I didn't care anymore why what was happening was happening!!

Avoid this.

I reccommend instead:

*The Grudge (Japanese OR American remake)

*The Eye (The Eye 10 (#3) was just released in theaters!)

*Ringu

*Ringu 2

*Phone

*Rasen (ringu sequel)

*Ringu 0 Birthday (sad)

*Ring Virus

*One Missed Call (2 is out in Japan now!)",1112572800,6,1227,4.704225352112676

2152188,4,B0002ZDW7Q,"My review headline is descriptive both of this film and of my reaction to it, because I am a bona fide ""Juon Junkie"" who was expecting this movie to be little more than a poorly done blatant rip-off of Shimizu Takashi's influential spookfest. Though I am forced to concede concerning the much too obviously lower production quality of this film, the storyline and the way it unfolds is in no way inferior to ""Juon's"" and is in fact on a par with, and I dare say in some instances even surpasses, what we were presented with in the ""Juon"" series. (I would have never imagined that I'd be espousing these words.) But before addressing this movie, I want to give a little background information along with some clarifications.

Despite the fact that no one seems to appreciate my efforts, I continue to persist in sharing what information I deem important in relation to numerous films which are now coming to us from East Asia; ""Jurei"" is definitely no exception and is in fact one of the 'best' and 'worst' examples.

Beginning with its title -- the film's original Japanese dual title is ""jyurei gekijyouhan: kurojyurei,"" which translates into English as ""Cursed Spirits, the Theatrical Edition: Black Cursed Spirits,"" hence, as alternately rendered, ""JuRei the Movie: Kuro Jurei."" This same film is also known as ""Jurei the Movie 2.""

(I can already hear the collective sigh of frustration going up: ""Oh, hell! -- He's going to go into another of his long-winded explanations as to why the film titles are different and so confusing."" You're absolutely correct -- so please skip past the rest of this review if you care nothing for gaining a deeper understanding into the history, background & intricacies of this movie and the series it was born out of.)

""Broadway Productions,"" a Tokyo company, has made something of a name for itself (and not always a 'good' one, quite frankly) as a major purveyor of low-budget horror (and, as some might say, of low-budget 'horrible'). They are particularly notable for the popular television series, ""Noroi no Bideo"" (""Cursed Video""), which also gave rise to two theatrical releases.

Broadway had also branched out into the 'direct-to-video' market with a V-Cinema series called ""Jurei"" (or ""Julei"" -- other romanized variations include ""JuRei"" ""Ju-Rei"" ""JuLei"" ""Ju-Lei""). The series launched with a collection of documentary-style vignettes and was released under the title ""Jurei: Shinrei ['new spirit'] Mystery File."" The V-Cinema release and its two subsequent sequels were well-enough received to give rise to a theatrical version called ""Jurei the Movie,"" which was then followed by -- oh, but you've guessed it already! :) While ""Jurei"" (the first theatrical movie) kept the same presentation format as its V-Cinema siblings (think ""Creepshow"" or the lesser known ""Nightmares""), its theatrical sequel, ""Jurei 2"" (as I shall henceforth be referring to the current film throughout this review), retained the 'vignette' style of its predecessors, but it is the first in the series where the individual episodes are ""interrelated"" rather than self-contained independent stories.

In somewhat similar fashion of the ""Juon"" series, ""Jurei 2"" ties all of its episodes, or ""chapters,"" together via an established timeline of events -- but whereas the timeline throughout the ""Juon"" series is arranged in a seemingly random and haphazard fashion, ""Jurei 2"" progressively works ""in reverse,"" from the time we witness the ""first"" attack in ""Chapter 10"" through to the film's ""conclusion"" in the ""Prologue."" Yes, the concept is bizarre and sounds highly impractical & open to total predictability, but believe me, the concept works on so many different levels in this movie and is remarkably effective & engrossing (although I must admit that the final scene was just a little bit of a letdown -- I felt it needed just a tad bit more fleshing out & exposition, but it's nothing to get hung-up on).

An unexplained series of ghost attacks occur over the course of a single day (which causes me to interpret the chain of events as something that takes place on a sort of ""seasonal"" basis, rather than on the ""on-going"" basis which is suggested in the ""Juon"" series -- but this is just my own personal interpretation). Much like in ""Juon,"" the spectral epidemic spreads in a virus-like fashion -- but it is not just some random plague killing indiscriminately, and yet at the same time there are no identifiable tangible vectors like the Saeki house in ""Juon"" or Sadako's cursed video tape in ""Ring.""

My biggest complaints about the film are in regard to what pretty much everyone will concur are the ""blatant rip-offs"" of other popular movies, particularly the ""clicking noise"" made by Saeki Kayako in the ""Juon"" series (which had a very specific meaning in Kayako's case because it was directly related to something we witnessed in the ""Juon"" universe, which helped to explain why Kayako was the only ghost in the ""Juon"" series the noise was associated with -- and, no, it's not the same reason they try to make you think it is in the Hollywood remake called ""The Grudge""). And yet, despite the fact that it 'IS' such a rip-off, I'm shamed to admit that where I responded to ""Kayako's"" clicks & croaks as being little more than curious story elements, I actually get a physical reaction upon hearing these similar sounds emanating from the ghosts in ""Jurei 2"" -- don't ask me why that is, but it is unsettling enough that if I were to hear those same noises on a dark street somewhere I'd consider running very fast and not looking back.

There is also a scene which deliberately lifts a filming technique straight out of ""Juon 2"" (V-Cinema edition).

Actually, I can almost forgive the many similarities to (and ""borrowed"" elements from) the ""Juon"" series because there is a scene in the movie which I am sure is an overly-blatant homage to Shimizu-san's influential work, but it is a scene which also seems to clearly hint that the events taking place in the ""Jurei 2"" universe are all precursors to the events recounted in the ""Juon"" universe, thereby strongly suggesting that even though the ghost attacks between the two stories are different and separate from one another that both of these events may have actually taken place within the same ""reality"" -- and that's all I'm going to say about that!

Then, too, there is the Sadako-inspired ""death mask"" thing that was pulled right out of ""Ring.""

And this thing about grown women hiding under bed blankets is something I'm going to have to inquire about, because it is just so hokey and so overused in these Asian ghost stories that it may just wind up being another one of those ""cultural"" things we just don't get right away.

The only other complaint I can lay at this film is its low production quality. It hits you right away as the title sequence gives way to the opening scene: everything is overly dark, hazy, flickery and grainy -- you can't help but notice it (somewhat reminiscent of ""Head Hunter,"" another 'good story; cheap production' for those of you familiar with this ""Dead Alive Productions"" release which is, sadly, no longer available on Amazon). But here's the big surprise: by the time you are about a fourth of the way through the movie it won't have been an issue to you at all -- in fact, you may very well find yourself ""appreciating"" the low photographic quality of the film, because as the events play themselves out on the screen and as you find yourself being drawn deeper into the story as it progresses, these qualities actually wind up giving the entire production a very haunting and surreal look & feel which seems to compliment its subject matter (can't quite say that about ""Juon""). By the time the end credits begin to roll, you will not have even cared that you had just watched the entire film in ""full screen"" format! Even so, I still would have liked to have seen what director Shiraishi Kohji might have accomplished with just a little bit more of a budget to work with.

And there it is, from a hardened ""Juonophile."" If you really (and I mean ""REALLY"") liked/loved ""Juon"" (the complete 4-part series), I don't think you'll regret having added this title to your cool-lection.",1103760000,46,8216,4.876074498567335
2152189,5,B0002ZDW7Q,"A very traditional yurei story, Ju-Rei is similar in some respects to Ju-On, but the feel and pacing of the film was considerably better. It lacks the jumbled chaos of scene progression and un-tied loose ends of the earlier film... it's cleaner, and the end of the movie is more rewarding as you find out step by step the progression of the curse and at last, the cause. The 'corner of the eye' SFX and smoky, etherial qualities to the ghosts also put them above the simpler, less eerie ones in Ju-On, and I don't think I'll ever be able to watch Predator again without flinching, after hearing that.... noise!

I've watched a lot of horror movies... everything from the old B&W classics to today's. This is one of the creepiest, if not /the/ creepiest movie I've ever seen.

It made one of my friends screech like a girl and hide under his girlfriend. I can't make any better recommendation than that. ^___^

Don't watch it alone, especially if the fluorescents in your house are prone to flickering.",1103068800,18,1001,4.612359550561798

2152211,5,B0002ZDW7Q,"I don't know if it was a rip off of the JU-ON movies or associated with it but this is a really good, dare I say it?, probably one of the best Japanese horror movies I have seen in a long time.  Scarier than RINGU but right on par with JU-ON, this is one pitch perfect creep fest.  If a movie can make me jump out of my seat not once, not twice but several times it a good one.  Check this out if you liked JU-ON.  It's very similar but different enough to stand on its own.",1143417600,4,474,3.806122448979592
2152212,4,B0002ZDW7Q,"While there is no doubt that JU-REI borrows many elements from such films as JU-ON and RINGU, this should not be seen as a negative thing. Rather than call it ""plagiarism,"" I would class JU-REI as yet another entry into a particular canon of Japanese ghost/horror films.

While not as scary or intense as JU-ON, JU-REI conjures up a very eerie and suspenseful mood, which it sustains from beginning to end. Like JU-ON, the timeline of the narrative is fractured. In this case, the events of the film occur in reverse chronology. This turns the film into a kind of puzzle, which definitely invites a deeper sense of audience participation than your usual gore-fest. In fact, multiple viewings are the only way to get the most out of this film.

Although JU-REI runs only 77 minutes, the pace is often slow, but this adds a sense of reality and normalcy to the events. I mean, real life isn't ""edited"" for maximum effect! This pacing makes the weird occurrences --say, a ghostly face suddenly peering out of a trash basket -- all the more effective. And the performances add to the realism. Too often, in big-budget ""horror"" epics, we are very aware that we're watching actors, elaborate sets and spectacular effects. In JU-REI, the story unfolds with people and in locales that are completely ordinary. Their sense of horror at the intrusion of the terrifying/supernatural in their everyday lives becomes both palpable and believable as a result. One scene, in particular, featuring one of the girls' fathers in a hotel room, is a fine example of horror creeping into one's soul, of a victim not wanting to believe what is happening right before his eyes. The girls themselves carry their roles with a natural quality that makes their scenes credible. The film is visually appealing, as well -- moody and foreboding.

In summary, JU-ON is a prime example of what a talented film maker can achieve with a limited budget, a talented cast & crew, and a true feeling for the subject matter. The ghosts in JU-REI are detached yet malevolent, eerie yet very much bound to the earth and normal human events and consequences. It's interesting that, sometimes, the horrors seem to silently observe from  afar. Other times, they're right in someone's face. It keeps the viewer guessing.

Really, this is THE way to do a ghost story. No huge mega-scenes or explosions. No CGI things flapping around. No chic characters living in expansive city lofts or country mansions.

JU-REI isn't epic in scope. It's an intimate excursion into the supernatural and menacing. If you enjoy Japanese ghost tales, it's well worth a shot.",1134950400,6,2609,4.864864864864865
2152213,4,B0002ZDW7Q,"This may be similar to other Japanese ghost/horror films, but I wouldn't know that(I haven't seen the Japanese versions of Ringu or The Grudge yet). I thought it was truly fear inducing at times, and it captured a vibe that Hollywood horror movies haven't come close to since the likes of The Shining. Anyway, this movie is dark and creepy, and I highly recommend it.",1126656000,4,367,4.661538461538462
2152214,1,B0002ZDW7Q,"If this had been just a good imitation of Ringu, The Grudge, Dead Friend, or Phone, I wouldn't be complaining. This was a POORLY done, low-budget attempt at stealing blatantly from The Grudge. The first problem is that the movie is nothing like the back of the box says. That might've been interesting. No, this movie is one of those eccentric ones that you think is several unrelated people, in unrelated stories. It has chapters. That go backwards... :(  Only several chapters in, is it clear that these people know each other somehow, as the ""ghost"" is killing the people for no logical reason. Keep in mind this is ALL backwards. Long, drawn out, but completely predictable scenes.

By then, you're so mad you rented this stupid thing that you want to just see the ending. IS there one, and how could this be SOLD?? No forests, only once is a shadowy possibly ""hooded"" figure seen... Then the ending is a twisted and turned opposite rip-off of the Grudge - like no one would notice?

2152215,4,B0002ZDW7Q,A group of school girls discover the truth to an urban legend whenone by one begin to die under strange circumstances after witnessing a black hooded figure. The result is a horrifying and scary experience. It's short running only 77 minutes long but doesn't let up for a minute. In fact the scenes are so quick you'd think that they had a 77 minute deadline or face the firing squad. The music and mood setting are wierd and unsettling and the faces of the creatures made me shudder. One note of recomedation: The film has the option of subtitles or not make sure you hit the ON button because for the first minute I couldn't figure out what they were saying. One thing I particularly found interesting when the ghost appears only one friend sees it and the other doesn't HMMM. I haven't seen a good scary ghost story since The Changling with George C Scott.

Well makes you jump from time to time but good horror for all you J-Horror buffs.  I recommend this one.",1121126400,2,392,4.243243243243243
2152217,3,B0002ZDW7Q,"You know, when I first saw this flick, I was just getting into Asian horror.  After having seen Ringu and Ju-On: The Grudge, I was definitely hungry for more, so I bought this one sight-unseen.  While I noticed that there are several elements blatantly lifted from those two movies (pale-faced ghosts, Kayako's click-click noise, faces frozen in fear a la Ringu), I actually found myself genuinely enjoying this movie.

Anyways, the plot goes like this:  several people are stalked by ghosts in a virus-like pattern (yeah, yeah...I know).  The story is told in a backwards fashion, starting from ""Chapter 10"" to the ""Prologue"", resulting in a more linear movie than Ju-On: The Grudge, but still keeping with the popular ""fragmented story"" style that seems to be prolific in Japan.

So...why did I still enjoy it?  First of all, I'm not so sure it's a rip-off per se; it seems like the work of someone who highly admires Takashi Shimizu and his work on Ju-On, rather than someone who's trying to cash in on a craze.  After all, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  Secondly, I really liked that it was low-budget.  I actually don't like to see a whole lot of computer-generated special effects in horror flicks; it makes the film look obviously fake and a lot less scary.  The grainy, almost camcorder look of Ju-Rei lends a little more realism to the story (let's face it, if the Blair Witch people didn't spill the beans, we'd all still be debating on whether or not the first Blair Witch movie was a real visual document).  Finally, while the scare techniques were lifted from other movies, they're still highly effective.

In conclusion, this film isn't a masterpiece of horror like Ju-On is, but it's still a fun ride to be had.  If you can't stand movies with obvious similarities bordering on plagiarism, then pass this one.  However, if you enjoyed Ju-On, and can remember the fact that Halloween, Friday the 13th, Sleepaway Camp, and the like are basically the same story but with different environments (psycho killers methodically killing hapless teenagers), then you can do much worse than getting this flick.",1118880000,,2129,4.858725761772853

Oh the movie has a few parts that will make you jump and its great how the movie doesn't depend on huge effects to get its point across like other horror films, but thats all it had.  The story line is just not there.  I know that Japanese horror can be irratic and jumpy and usually is a good thing but JuRei:Uncanny is so jumpy that it makes no sence.

And yet... Somehow this film works. Borrowing elements from many other well-known/successful recent Japanese horror films, JU REI: THE UNCANNY blends subtle scares and teasing atmospherics into a genuine creepfest.

Yes, it is filmed on DV (and thus has a look that can be dismissed as 'cheap') - however once the story grabs-hold, you won't even notice.

My favourite aspect of this film is the slow, creepy tempo... the director (editor) has wisely decided to let many scenes slowly unravel, holding onto shots for much longer than is expected, increasing the scares through the tension this stylistic-device creates. Viewers who lack patience, who demand MTV-styled editing, and who demand linear storylines may wish to stay-away from this film - they may not find the rewards their short attention-spans demand.

8035190,1,B0002ZDW7Q,"I will preface this review by assuring you, dear reader, that I am a devout horror fan and eager Japanophile, which means that I devour anything Japanese and/or of the Horror genre in the anticipation that it might offer something new or even pleasantly familiar for the satisfaction of those interests. The following review is written by one who gives such things a great deal of subjective benefit of the doubt and suspension of disbelief.

This is, without doubt, a top contender for the title of ""the worst Horror film in my collection"" (a collection of nearly 400 titles in that genre alone). I was curious about the film - okay, call it a morbid curiosity - as Hiromi Senno (Fujiko-san from the Shogun mini-series) had a supporting role as the main character's mother in this horror (irony intended). The image is in a very hazy and grainy 4:3 aspect ratio and appears to have been made for TV (and then transferred to DVD only after being recorded from TV to VHS). The sound is no better than one would expect from a hand-held video camera - by turns muffled or tinny, and with inconsistent volume. The acting ranges from wooden to self-conscious and always unconvincing. The story could have been interesting, if the acting and production values hadn't destroyed such pleasure as even the most devoted apologist for the genre might have derived from a first viewing (a second viewing being the sort of thing only a thoroughly unimaginative and undemanding masochist might consider). It was filmed entirely ""on location,"" not as an extravagance, but rather due to the limitations imposed by a clearly paltry budget - alleys, dark hallways of after-hours or un-occupied commercial real estate, and very likely the apartments of a few of the people involved in the production. The few moments in the film that might have provided a minor scare are handled in such an amateurish and ham-handed manner that whatever creepy atmosphere and suspense achieved in the build-up leave one feeling at best - suckered, and at worst - insulted. Furthermore, those moments of build-up, so integral to and emblematic of horror films, are so poorly edited that one often watches an actor feverishly reacting to an apparition that remains, during most of this response, off-camera; the viewer is simply left to infer the terrifying presence as the camera remains fixed on the actor. Such scenes result in the rather un-terrifying impression that one is watching an audition tape - ""Okay, Mrs. Mori, show us TERROR... that's good, keep it up... now gesticulate a bit and cry out, 'stay away - who are you...' Okay, I guess that'll do, you've got the job as the ailing grandma."" I've seen and enjoyed horror produced on a shoestring budget, but this one needed a better director, better editing, better acting... I could go on, but that should suffice. It's one thing to kill time with a bit of frivolous entertainment, but time shouldn't be killed so indiscriminately that one forgoes the usual expectation of being entertained by these entertainments.

I don't say that you should avoid this altogether; it might be that you, as others have, will find some redeeming elements in this film that couldn't save it for me. I would urge you to rent it or buy it on the cheap, though. Otherwise, the greatest sensation of horror you derive from the experience is likely to be the regret at the loss of money and time you'll never retrieve.",1345161600,3,3422,4.837883959044369

This movie is a rip-off of Ju-On only to those that have little understanding of traditional Japanese ghosts stories.
The movie begins with the final victim and proceeds downwards in a series of viganettes, entitled Chapters, that each slowly reveal a little more information about what is happening and why the Kuriokagae-onna is hunting all of these people down. I watched this with the lights off and with each chapter found myself trying to draw parallels and conlusions and match new clues against old ones. The movie kept me thoroughly engaged and engrossed.

If you've been disappointed with other Japanese horror efforts (I won't name names but you know the ones I mean), I sincerely recommend this movie. It is one of the best Japanese horror movies I have ever seen.",1186531200,,536,4.424242424242424
