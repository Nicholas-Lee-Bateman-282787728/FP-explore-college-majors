3004626,5,B000XPQ18W,"I am getting tired of seeing the ""clone of alien"" on every single thing I read about this movie. It does take alot from the Alien film, there is no way to get around that. It does a few things Alien does not, and Alien does ALOT more that this movie doesn't. But the main points, Isolation, beast going through life stages, and a snake alien like creature are really the only things that they have in common. More of a tribute than a rip-off, because the movie was still done very well. Alien is my favorite movie of all time, and this film is in my top 10. If you are a fan of the Alien films, give this movie a FAIR shot and don't get angry when things seem to be following a similar scheme. This was a Made for TV movie (no idea what network aired it) and then hit video. So if you manage to track a copy down it has that good ole, 80's horror rental feel that comes with the ""golden age"" of horror. In one review I noticed someone called it a predator clone! Well this movie pre-dates that by 5 years, so try again. Or just stick with ""alien clone"". In my life I have collected over 1600 horror films(only horror and horror/sci-fi) and seen more than I have collected. This movie is STILL in my top 10. Try it out.",1218412800,9,1218,4.100418410041841

8228910,4,B000XPQ18W,"I first saw this movie when I was a Kid in the ancient 1980's. It was weird then and it is still weird today. For a movie that was inspired by Alien this is not to bad, not a complete rip off but comes close it does a nice job trying to be original. The creature could have been done way better.",1495152000,,295,3.774193548387097

8228913,4,B000XPQ18W,"Although this was broadcast on television, I don't think I've ever heard of anyone watching this on anything except the old Trans World VHS, which I myself discovered sitting anonymously on the old rental shelf at Movies America when I was in college. It must not have made much of an impression when it was shown, but this little TV movie has a nice cult following nowadays.

The story isn't original; it's just another version of spam-in-a-cabin with various obvious parallels to ""Alien"". Instead of a spaceship crew, the victims in this one are a crew of an oil rig that are operating off the grid. After discovering a creature, various people are infected and die in all manner of grisly fashion. As said, there's nothing new, but the plot is done a great service by a capable core of salty actors, expert direction and just enough humorous splashes to keep the movie rolling.

The direction is especially good with a few neat, innovative shots thrown in to work around the restrictions for blood and sex. In a movie with violence, rape, stabbings and a gooey monster, ""The Intruder Within"" gets by with very little... And gets by well at that. At one point, a woman gives birth to a monster, and we get a shadowy shot that is effective without being explicit.

For those that like their chills without so much gore, this is the sort of movie that should be on their watch list. It may sound clichd; however, this movies does well with what little plot it has and delivers. It may not be saddled with the best TV movies ever, but it's not far behind.",1410825600,,1554,4.562724014336918
8228914,5,B000XPQ18W,"There were a lot of rip off movies made after ALIEN hit the scene.  So what.  Some were awful, some were good.  This is one of the better ones.  A made-for-TV film about workers at an offshore oil rig hitting, instead of oil, an organism that eventually starts to do them in.  I have the VHS version.  I hope a good quality DVD version is released very soon.  Recommended.",1395532800,2,372,4.304347826086956
8228915,5,B000XPQ18W,"If you are a fan of Chad Everett you will like this film. He is in a very strong role and it fits him.  This is strangely symbolic story-line; rather than science fiction and it begins to question our dependence on oil and how we think of the planet - The story is good, all taking place on an oil rig - somewhat lost at sea. I liked all the characters - This film will hold your attention.",1360972800,,390,4.0
8228916,1,B000XPQ18W,"The first thing I heard about ""The Intruder Within"" was that it was a ripoff of ""Alien."" Well... it's not. It has some props that are blatant copies of the alien monsters, but the story itself is totally different.

Does that mean it's good? No! This 1980s made-for-TV horror movie has some good moments in there, but most of it is just stretches of tedium aboard an oil rig -- not to mention important plot points (psychic dreams) that are used for dramatic effect, but never explained. Also, the monster is ridiculous.

The story follows a crew on a remote oil rig, who have been sent on a super-top-secret drilling mission -- and after many days of nothing, they're getting a little antsy. Then they get some rocks from deep in the earth's crust... and a little chestburster-like monster that kills one of the crew.

And soon a creepy scientist, who is there on... secret corporate business, discovers that the rocks they've brought up are actually the eggs of some sort of bizarre, monstrous creature from below the earth's crust. And they wiped out all life in Antarctica. No, seriously.

And of course, these creatures are not finished -- one of them hatches and attacks another unfortunate crew member, while a newly-arrived guy somehow gets possessed (don't ask me how) and rapes a young woman. It's up to the cpatain and his love interest to banish this creature once and for all... or something.

Yes, despite the descriptions of ""The Intruder Within"" being an ""Alien"" ripoff, it's actually not about aliens at all. The only real similarities are that they seem to have raided a stash of ""Alien""-themed toys, and used them as puppets for the under-the-sea creatures.

Unfortunately, my summary makes this movie sound a lot more interesting than it is. 90% of this movie is nothing but long, grey stretches without much suspense or interest, where the characters chitchat idly about their lives (did we need a LONG scene devoted to the captain TALKING about his family life?!). And the dialogue is... weird. In one scene, a woman infected by the creature begs to be killed... and the other characters just sort of look awkward. Then the subject is dropped.

There is also a lot of stuff that is NEVER EXPLAINED. For instance, the oil rig is mysteriously unable to contact their base... and it's never explained. Two unrelated characters have psychic dreams of the future... and it's never explained. It's pure plot convenience.

And the monster... ugh. It's a fairly decent rubber suit creature with a vaguely Xenomorphy head... and it's Canadian. The only noise it makes is ""Eh! Eh! Eh!""

""The Intruder Within"" has bland characters, long stretches of boredom, and a monstrous presence that just isn't utilized well. It may not be an ""Alien"" ripoff, but it's not very good.",1344124800,,2782,4.84
8228917,2,B000XPQ18W,"<strong>The Intruder Within</strong> (Peter Carter, 1981)

Billed as an <em>Alien</em> ripoff, but honestly, I didn't see that as much as I did a few other sci-fi-horror hybrids. And not nearly as awful as I was led to believe, despite some howl-inducing acting. Carter, who made only one before film before his untimely 1982 death, gives us the events on an oil well in the middle of nowhere, on a secret missions when it's supposed to be in drydock for repairs. (I didn't know they dry-docked oil wells.) They're working at the behest of Scott (<em>The Black Hole</em>'s  Joseph Bottoms, Timothy's brother), supposedly a company geologist looking for alternative oil sources. But we know better by the eerie music that comes on whenever he's on screen, right kiddies? They strike gold when they bring up a bunch of eggs--and one live creature, who bites a worker. The ""geologist"" takes the eggs back to his (surprisingly sterile for a mad scientist) lab, while the guy who got bit is looking paler and paler...

It's silly, and no better than a way to kill an hour and a half when you don't have anything else to watch, but Jennifer Warren (<em>Slap Shot</em>) in the female lead is a solid enough draw any time she's onscreen, backed up on the cute factor by Lynda Mason Green (<em>The Shape of Things to Come</em>). Playing opposite them are Chad Everett (<em>Airplane II</em> as the hunky foreman and Rockne Tarkington (<em>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</em>) as his right hand man. Cheap thrills indeed, but fun if you're in the mood. **",1312761600,,1542,4.811320754716981
8228918,4,B000XPQ18W,I think my title pretty much says it all but I will add that this movie is different than aliens and I don't believe that the director had any intentions of copying that movie. It has a pretty good creep factor and is worth seeing if you can find a copy of it. I have it on vhs and believe it should be released on DVD like the other two reviewers. This is obviously not a widely recognized film and that's too bad because it could have been a classic horror movie.,1305676800,3,465,4.065217391304348
8228919,5,B000XPQ18W,"I agree with the other guy that posted on this movie. This is well worth watching! I saw it when it aired on network TV, and I was freaked out for months. I was convinced that this could actually happen - and who's to say that it couldn't???

This is a masterpiece of horoor and deserves it's place in your horror collection. Like the other guy, I am a huge collector and this movie is definitly a part of it. Although, we need a DVD release of this movie at some point...

Another reason to watch this movie? You will never guess in a million years who played the creature - how about Bo Derek? Yup! It's true. I have the orignal TV Guide from when this movie aired, and it's gives credit to Bo Derek for the role, despite the fact that the movie's credits don't reflect this.",1287792000,5,777,4.208053691275167
