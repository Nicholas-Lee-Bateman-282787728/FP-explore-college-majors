8092766,1,B000BU1CJC,"I rated this one star, but that's only part of the story.  I bought the DVD in order to watch it with friends, MST3K style.  It's certainly viable for that, but it was punishingly slow and incoherent.  Protagonists come and go on a whim.  Space fleets change design from battle to battle, and sometimes scene to scene.  And the talking.  Oh, the talking!  This is a fantastic example of truly low-budget, low-effort animation.",1370822400,,426,4.7534246575342465
8092767,5,B000BU1CJC,"There are no words. The cover does not do it justice. This thing, this masterpiece, is art itself. It tells the story of love and loss in an intergalactic space battle that rings all too hauntingly a familiar tune to that of the cold war.

This movie makes me want to be a better person, so that I can truly deserve to enjoy this movie. I recommend it with all of my mind, body, and soul.",1288483200,7,388,4.105263157894737
8092768,1,B000BU1CJC,"Honestly, I've watched this film a few times and if it wasn't for the spolier-laden synopsis on the back of the package, I'd STILL have no idea what was going on at any given time.  Many characters are shot through the story in the space of two or three scenes and never seen or referred to again.  The title characters aren't even given proper NAMES; that's the lack of detail we're dealing with here.  It's all so random, you could chop it up, reassemble it in any order, and the result would make as much sense.  That's probably how the cheapjack producers put this together in the first place.

To put it plainly, the art designs were completely stolen from favorite Japanese anime series from the 70s and 80s.  They do weird things with the colors and don't bother to stay on model part of the time, but if you know your stuff, your mouth will fall open at the brazeness of it all.

So yes, it's absolutely awful on all levels, with no redeemable qualities, poorly made for presumably mercenary reasons, so I can't recommend this as what we'd usually call ""entertainment"".  However, if you like to laugh at cheesy movies (preferably with a group of friends volunteering ""improvements"" as the show runs), you can't get any cheesier.  This DVD could also make a great drinking game for anime aficianados, where you take a shot when you recognize what characters and scenes are being ripped off.  It's only a few bucks...it won't break you.

Oh, and if you were wondering, nothing that appears on the front cover actually shows up in the movie.",1150761600,10,1546,4.605839416058394
