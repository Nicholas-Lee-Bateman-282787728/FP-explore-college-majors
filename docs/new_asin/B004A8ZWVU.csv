4299670,5,B004A8ZWVU,"Few films have the power to make me cry.  There are the rare ones out there that have made me misty, sometimes even managing to encourage a tear or two to roll down my cheek.  There are also few films adapted from books I've read of which I've not been disappointed by the result, however small or great.  A film's impact, however, becomes abundantly clear when the audience remains in their seats in poignant silence nearly ten minutes after the end credits have started rolling, so moved by what they've seen that they take that much time to reflect and/or regain their composure.  This is the point at which film transcends it medium and becomes art.  Laughter, tears, and catharsis - this was my experience seeing ""The Help"".

Adapted from author Kathryn Stockett's mega best seller of the same name, ""The Help"" tells the story of the impenetrable and time-tested bonds between women and the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, setting it against the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement in the sweltering summer temperatures and racially-charged atmosphere of Jackson, Mississippi.  Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan (Stone) is the film's central character, an Ole Miss graduate who instead of aspiring to marriage and children like all her friends before her dreams of making a name for herself as a journalist and author.  Brought up in an era where African-American housemaids and field workers were commonplace (she was raised by a black housekeeper herself), Skeeter sets herself apart from the rest of Jackson's residents with her staunchly liberal views.  Confounded and opposed to the treatment that friends and family bear upon the help, she is even more horrified when her best friend Hilly Holbrook (Howard) issues a ""Household Sanitation Initiative"", a proposal which strongly recommends that a separate bathroom for blacks be a requirement in every white home.

Fed up with the unrelenting bias of nearly everyone around her, Skeeter embarks on a radical and risky project - to document the stories of black housemaids and share their viewpoints in the effort to open people's minds.  Starting first with veteran housemaid Aibileen (Davis) and growing to more than 30 different women over time, Skeeter's book attempts to rip the blindfold of ignorance from everyone's eyes and spur a collapse in Jackson's longstanding racial divide.

Written and directed for the screen by Tate Taylor, ""The Help"" serves as his directorial debut and considering the actors with whom he worked he had an easy time about it.  The cast is superior - Emma Stone is golden as Skeeter, a less than stellar beauty who shines nonetheless with ambition and integrity, a woman who stubbornly pursues the truth while battling quietly with uncertainty.  Octavia Spencer is uproarious as the feisty Minnie; Bryce Dallas Howard manages to incur all the intended hatred for the character of Hilly, her high nose and icy stare masterful; Jessica Chastain is delightful as the ditzy and buxom Celia Foote, her squeaky giggles, flirtatious prancing, and high, timid speech seeming to spring directly from Stockett's pages.  It should serve as no surprise that Academy Award nominee Viola Davis gives the film's most arresting performance, able to detain a viewer's heart with one raw and penetrating look, one succinctly delivered line.  The film's final scene is the most heartrending, Aibileen bidding both fond and hard-edged farewells alike as she walks down a long suburban road, one that serves as a symbol to the long road that many African-Americans have walked in their pursuit for equality.

Bottom line: Though a few things have been changed for dramatic effect (a commonality for adaptations), ""The Help"" is a movie of which readers of Stockett's novel should be proud.  Despite its obvious invitation to controversy, the film packs an emotional punch with its historical backdrop, stirring story and bravado performances.  To all the women in the audience: be it a tissue or a shirt sleeve, you will find yourself at a loss for words and wiping away tears when all is said and done.",1313280000,2,4089,5.0670640834575265

humorous, and multi-leveled film performance.
This whole film; from the acting, to the direction,
the writing, EVERYTHING!!---Top of the line all the way!
If this movie doesn't win some Oscars, then I'll know that whole awards thing is BS, pure and simple.
The 9 other reviewers (so far) have all pretty much covered all the bases from every perspective of what
can be said about this film.  All I have to say is that ""THE HELP"", will go down as a modern day classic.
""The Color Purple"", ""The Secret Life Of Bees"", ""Divine Secrets Of The Ya-Ya Sisterhood"", ""Fried Green Tomatoes""...
This film is definitely in that echelon of films for sure.
Kudos to Viola Davis, Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain...",1313280000,29,789,4.844444444444444
4299672,5,B004A8ZWVU,"The best movie I've seen in a LONG time. I haven't been to a movie theater in years. But after reading the book, I knew couldn't wait for it to come out in DVD. It didn't disappoint. I know I will watch this again many times. It's that good!",1313193600,2,241,3.938775510204082
4299673,5,B004A8ZWVU,"""The Help"" works as well as it does because it doesn't offer easy answers. This lovely and sometimes extraordinary film is not concerned with big sermons about clivil rights, religion or easy to swallow messages. The film is simply about behavior; how we should act, morally, towards other people, no matter who they might be. This thematic line is structured nicely throughout the film by zeroing in on a select group of people. This was a smart move since the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s is just too large a subject to truly flesh out in a 2 hour film. Because the film is about actual characters instead of predisposed, prepackaged lessons, the audience can take with them what they choose from the story (none of the characters have a major epiphany, each just starts to become aware of their behavior and effects, both good and bad- they all have so much more life to live). Surprisingly the film rarely gets melodramatic, and when it does it almost seems cheep and easy. Thankfully the films few flaws (structure, pacing, some silly dialogue here and there- ""You broke her heart...!"") can be overlooked due to the tremendous performances. Each actress is exceptional in their own ways with the wonderful Viola Davis stealing the film. Emma Stone is reliable here as always and proves that she can be funny and carry dramatic weight in the same film. I have always considered Bryce Dallas Howard to be a very accomplished actress and hopefully her scathing, pointed work will be recognized. Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain find a tender chemistry all their own. I have to say that ""The Help"" really, truly surprised me. I have never read the mega-selling novel from which it's based but I can tell you the film is a beautiful testament to American history and is a great display for some truly fine acting. For those who are turned off by sermonizing, preachy, obnoxious message movies (like myself), ""The Help"" is far from that. This is a tender film about real emotions and a subject that is rarely discussed in film today.",1313193600,137,2058,4.76750700280112
4299674,5,B004A8ZWVU,Outstanding!  Wonderful!  Awesome!  Acting from ALL actors outstanding.  I laughed hard and cried hard.  A must see movie.,1313107200,,122,5.555555555555555
4299675,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I read this book a few years ago and absolutely loved it.  That's why I made sure to see this film in its first opening days. I've seen some other film adaptations of books lately and have been disappointed.  And so I must say that I was completely delighted with the film adaptation of ""The Help"".  Not only did it stay true to the book, it was so well cast that every character rang true.  I laughed.  I cried.  And I felt real emotion throughout.  The filmmakers did an outstanding job and I want to shout ""Bravo"".

The story is set in Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960's.  Emma Stone is cast as a young white college graduate who yearns to be taken seriously as a writer.  Her first job is writing a column on cleaning house in the local paper and so she starts interviewing the African American women who work as maids in the homes of her friends.  Immediately, her eyes are opened to the realities of their lives and decides to turn her knowledge into an eventual book.

Viola Davis is excellent in the role of Aibileen who gives the child she cares for an abundance of love and attention.  Octavia Spencer is cast as Minnie, another maid with a strong personality who is full of grit and gumption.  And Bryce Dally Howard is cast as Hilly, an obnoxious young white social-climbing woman who we all love to hate.

The plot moves swiftly and even though the film is 2-1/2 hours long, I was so caught up in it that I didn't want it to end.  Here was a snapshot in a time of racial prejudice and the exploitation of household help in a era that has hopefully passed into history.  And yes, it also has its bittersweet comedic moments which made the film even more endearing.  I loved this film.  Don't miss it.",1313107200,9,1718,4.3627760252365935
4299676,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I laughed to the point of embarrasement. I cried a little too. And in between I fell in love with this movie. Set in Jackson, MS at the cusp of the civil rights movement, this movie delves into the lives of southern women back then. It shows the ugly reality and insidious nature of racism back in that day. But it also shows the real love and friendship between the help and the babies they raise. It also shows a glimpse of what was and was not acceptable choices for women to make with their lives back then. I loved the music, the clothing, the decor, everything seemed very acurate(according to my mother), including the racism in the south. With excellent acting and all of the above, I urge you to go see this movie!",1313107200,19,723,4.362962962962963
4299677,5,B004A8ZWVU,"""Oscar season"", as it's typically referred to, is a period of time, usually beginning in late November, and ending in late January. This year, it starts early, with ""The Help"".

""The Help"" is based on the well-known novel by Kathryn Stockett, someone who I had never heard of before discovering this film and book. For the most part, when I hear about a film that I want to see, I try to read the book prior to viewing the movie, to enhance the whole experience. Usually I get bored, or stop mid-way through one of these said books, before I end up watching the movie.

But ""The Help"" grabbed me. Stockett kept me on a leash, dying to know what happened next, and I ended up finishing its 530 pages in a few sittings. And, I'm glad it did, because ""The Help"" is not only the best movie I've seen this summer, but it very well could be the best one I see all year.

The film centers on Aibileen, Skeeter and Minny (Davis, Stone and Spencer, respectively) three very different women in Mississippi, in the year 1962. Skeeter is returning from college with a journalism degree, whose beloved childhood black maid Constantine has disappeared, and no one will tell her where she has gone. Aibileen is a maid who has raised 17 white children in her life. The word ""maid"" is pretty blandly used. She's a nanny to these children, if not a surrogate mother. Her outspoken friend Minny has never been able to keep quiet, or, because of this, hold onto a job very long, and she is hired on the sly by Celia (Chastain), a white-trash rich girl who has some grave secrets of her own. Skeeter decides to write a tell-all book of interviews from the maids of Jackson, Mississippi, which, as you could imagine, was a very taboo, and perhaps even illegal thing to take on in the time of Jim Crow, and segregation.

One of the reasons that this film succeeds is that not a single character is miscast, and there is not a single caricature. In the book, Stockett paints a vivid picture of each character, and the actors clearly got lost in their characters. Emma Stone is becoming a very important actress. I haven't seen her in a role that I didn't love her in. After getting her first notable role in 2009's ""Zombieland"", and then livening and carrying the otherwise bland teen comedy ""Easy A"", this is her first dramatic role, as Skeeter, one of the lead characters. While she sometimes blends into the background in this movie, she shines beautifully with the rest of the cast. She's definitely one to watch.

While Stone is great, this movie belongs to Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. Davis's Aibileen is perfect. She has a silent sadness about her, a lot of pride, and a great sense of anger, her expressive eyes displaying a silent protest, while never raising her voice the whole film. She handles emotional scenes beautifully, reducing the audience to tears in more than one scene. She's a early in the year front-runner for Best Actress this Oscar season.

Spencer also does a beautiful job as Minny. Octavia Spencer was the original inspiration for the character of Minny, who voiced the character's section in the audio-book. She was clearly made to play this role. She does a lot more for this movie, than just adding comic relief, however, she does plays the comedic side the best. The ""terrible awful"" that her character does in the book, is made into the funniest thing in the whole movie.

The supporting cast is dead-on too. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the town's snobby ringleader, Hilly. She's absolutely chilling, nailing the evil character. Her mother, played by Sissy Spacek is a hoot. The town's secretive lush, and Minny's boss, Celia, is played by scene-stealing newcomer Jessica Chastain, who wowed earlier this year in ""The Tree of Life"". She was completely like I envisioned her character in the book. Chastain would be perfect to play Marilyn Monroe. Just saying.  There's not enough typing space in this review to describe how much I loved the rest of the supporting cast. Everyone was dead-on.

I was under the assumption that this would be yet another disappointing film of a book loved by many. The reason for this was the director and writer. I had never heard of this Tate Taylor, and because of that, I wasn't sure that I trusted him. He had a large part in making this movie all that it was. One of the big reasons that ""The Help"" works as a movie is because it feels authentic. It was filmed in Mississippi, where it's based, it is set in the 1960's, and every feeling about the movie hits the right note.

I later discovered that Taylor was a childhood friend of the book's author. Not some Hollywood hack. I forget the many disappointing film adaptations of books I loved that were made by the Hollywood elite. ""The Da Vinci Code"" by Ron Howard, ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" by Rob Marshall, ""Eat, Pray, Love"" by Ryan Murphy. Enough said. After seeing this film, I couldn't imagine anyone better-suited to making the film.

What is special about this film is that it is not what a lot of people will probably write it off as. It's not a film designed to make audiences feel less ""white guilt"", and it isn't about how black folks need white ones to succeed. It's about good-hearted people wanting to make a change to a world that is unjust. It avoids the usual sentimentality and melodrama that typically plagues this kind of film. I don't know how, but it succeeds in that, like I thought it wouldn't.

While some changes are (intelligently) made from the book, it's almost a scene-for-scene adaptation of the book. Some things are different, because they need to be, and things are a little more concise, yet it's almost like watching an abridged version of the book, onscreen. It will stir up emotions in you that you didn't know you had. At the ending of this film, in a packed house, there was a thunderous applause. Almost everyone in the theater stayed seated through out the ending credits. I cannot remember a time where a movie evoked such emotion from its audience, that it wasn't until after the credits had ended that people actually started walking out. This is gripping stuff. Don't miss it.

4299678,5,B004A8ZWVU,"These events happened during my lifetime and I was sickened then by the prejudice against blacks that I witnessed as a young adult, but this is the first time I was able to hear the story of the black maids who raised white women's children. It was an exceedingly well told and well acted story with great emotion as well as great humor, and it moved me profoundly. I hope we watch, learn, and do not repeat these patterns today. I am thankful for white people who loved human beings and were color blind, at a time when they too were persecuted for making that choice.",1312934400,5,569,4.377358490566038
4299679,5,B004A8ZWVU,"Now we see this film wins award nominations aplenty. Biggest winner was the public. Leads of Davis and Spencer that stole the spotlight. DVD to own, not rent.
The only drawback with the DVD is the sparse bonus material. 4 min. of 2 deleted, and a 5 min. music video of one of the film's songs. Pathetically weak bonus, but then it is a 5.5 star film. Everyone asks to borrow our copy, I should have bought 2.
Oh yes, there are SUBTITLES.

We attended the opening matinee; we'll view it again, that good. Is `The Help' the soul of 60s era race relations? This worthy film based on Kathryn Stockett's #1 best-seller is equally a first-class view as true for the read. The story of 3 daring Mississippi women is as absorbing as any you'll see this year. The plot is writing a book which attempts to tell the truth about B/W relations in the city of Jackson, between wealthy whites and `the help'; but doing it anonymously. Without being fired or lynched.

There is humor in the way the Jackson Belle socialites operate, and eventually react to the book publication. Bryce Dallas Howard is the personification of Bad Girl, Hilly. Although beautiful, I loathed Hilly in the film and book, as you are supposed to. And Jessica Chastain (Murder on the Orient Express) has all it takes to be the scene stealer while playing Celia. Truly believable!
Humor erupts in how the help secretly reacts to their treatment. There's sadness at some injustice.
Viola Davis plays a slimmer/sexier Aibileen than was my mental image while reading the book. Octavia Spencer is right on as Minny. Both girls pack their roles with perfection.
The film has intrigue through the months of secret interviews.
There's a mystery related to Skeeter's (Emma Stone) own childhood maid's story, which is a larger part of the story in the book.
Skeeter, Aibileen, & Minny are the key book writers. The casting is near perfection. Should be some Oscar nominations someplace.
Some other stars too, like, Sissy Spacek, Cicely Tyson, & Mary Steenburgen (Proposal, Joan of Arcadia).

I remember reading the book and doing it as quickly as possible toward the end; and praying that all the `help' have a happy ending, but expecting some casualties. With the movie, it is evident when the story is climaxing, and then you just wish that you could make it last another hour or two. An excellent story, but then we all knew that from the book.
It is a tribute to the story that you forget it is fiction. How much is real, a docu-drama of the early 1960's of the south (& north)? We need reviews from the real-life `help' of the early 60's. Only they know!

If you view only one film this year...this should be it. See it soon, & as the film's dialogue states, ""Before the whole civil rights thing blows over."" That line brought a theater audience LOL.
As Aibileen believes, quoted from the book, ""We done something brave and good here. And Minny, maybe she don't want a be deprived a any a the things that go along with being brave and good.""

The question is will you like the story.  We did.  It was a good story that moved along at a good pace.  The characters were well developed, meaning the viewer came to care about them and like/or dislike each in his-her own way.  This does seem to accurately sum up the challenges of race relations in the south during the 50s fairly well without being preachy or out just to prove a point.

There is one thing that I will critique... The condition HIlly has is one of the first things you read about in the book, but in the movie it is construed as being a result of an incident between Hllly and Minnie. I feel that this can perpetuate some stereotypes pertaining to people of color. I was very disappointed that the movie did  not keep true to the book in this instance.

Outside of that, this movie is in one of my top 10, and I watch it often, and hope that many do as well.",1514160000,2,746,4.2027972027972025

Eugenia (Emma Stone) wants to publish their accounts of the abuse they're going through, how it feels raising white children while on the job, and the overall atmosphere of the industry. This is a FANTASTIC movie! I bought the hardcover book with this blu-ray and already can't wait to compare them. The actors' performances are stellar. It's like Desperate Housewives for the 1950s. There's scandal, drama, prejudice, and the occasional comedic line. Everything is in just the right amount. I bought it for my entertainment since I enjoyed it so much, but I have also shown it in my ESL classroom to international students, who also were entranced by it. Give this one a watch.

4301335,1,B004A8ZWVU,"This film is insufferably self-righteous and phony to the core.  Having a good ""message"" is no excuse for this kind of superficial and cartoonish depiction of race relations in a previous period.  I couldn't bear to watch this after the first 20 minutes made me want to gag with the straining situations and acting by all the white folks, especially Emma Stone, while the black women as maids were subjected to the humiliation of social mistreatment as well as being stereotypes yet managed to rise above that somewhat compared to the odious racists they work for.  The white folks are two-dimensional jerks with the exception of one named Skeeter (really!?) who wants to call attention to the maids' plight but manages only to be obnoxiously earnest and awkward--all of this so contrived and manipulative that it makes a mockery of civil rights activism.  I feel sorry for the talented black actresses in this affair, who struggle to maintain dignity and credibility in this film that feels more like a bad stage play than a realistic movie. The sanctimony of this whole enterprise spoils a sincere concern about how badly blacks were treated--and in some cases still are--with such nauseating phoniness in the depiction of racist behavior.",1498262400,,1241,5.009708737864078

4301339,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I loved loved loved this movie.  I had not heard of it before just this week.  I took a silly quiz online asking ""Which Emma Stone character are you?""  My result was Skeeter from ""The Help.""  Since I hadn't heard of the movie or book, I started reading the book.  After a few chapters (because the book was so good), I got impatient and rented the movie.  I have never had a silly/just for fun quiz be more accurate!!  My parents were Skeeter's age at this time.  From their experiences, it seemed to depict the timeframe well.  It is a bittersweet story.  From the few chapters I've read thus far of the book, it seems to be a very close rendering.  It was subtle, but I liked that they showed that children are naturally colorblind to race, and is only learned by the influence of parents, family, and/or society.  My dad told me that when he was young, he drank out of a drinking fountain labeled ""colored.""  He thought he was going to get colored water instead of the usual ""white"" water.  He was disappointed, but not as much so as when he learned later what the labels really meant.  As a child, he never would have imagined what it really meant.  The acting is superb by every single actor.  I literally laughed, cried, got angry, felt the suspense, and empathy.  I cannot say more good things about this movie.  I know it may  seem to some that the book/movie is story of a white person coming to the rescue of a group of black people.  But I felt the title is multi-dimensional.  Yes, it is literally about ""The Help,"" meaning maids.  However, it's also about ""The Help"" each person contributes to the other.  Skeeter helped by getting the truth of the situation out, while her interviewees helped give her confidence as a young woman and writer.  The secondary characters also had an interchange of helping each other.  I think the idea that we all need help and can give help is what is interwoven throughout.  Beautiful story, beautiful acting, beautiful message.",1497484800,2,1975,4.536931818181818

Although set in the early 1960s, this screenplay was so expertly written that it had, and will have, a continued timelessness to it. The characters each had an empathetic arc to them regardless of how despicable or endearing their behaviors. It is no easy feat to show complexity in every character on screen; some had only a few scene stealing moments to do so. Well deserved praise to all those involved with the film.",1485648000,,667,4.758620689655173

4302228,4,B004A8ZWVU,"Finally got around to seeing this gem of a movie last night and I wonder why it took so long.  As a movie, The Help doesn't really break any new ground since others of this genre such as ""Driving Miss Daisy"" ""The Butler"" and ""Selma"" have traveled down this similar path before.  I did not read the book, so I can only comment strictly as a movie.

The movie is all about the performances and the large cast does an outstanding job, particularly Bryce Dallas Howard as the evil, conniving Hilly and Jessica Chastain as the ditzy, but good-hearted Celia.  Emma Stone, whose star is on the rise, seems to be getting more than her share of plum roles, is solid if not remarkable as the spunky Skeeter is the emotional core of the movie.  I particularly wanted to check out Viola Davis because many have said she was robbed of an Oscar in a close race, losing to Meryl Streep in ""The Iron Lady"".  Viola's performance is not as flashy as Meryl's, it's multi-layered as she has to show rage, pain, sorrow, dignity---sometimes all at the same time.  Her complex emotions simmer just beneath the surface during the entire movie and sometimes those emotions boil over.  It's a great role and Viola runs with it.  And of course Octavia Spencer as Minny steals her scenes.  Last but not least, Sissy Spacek is a hoot as Mama.

In a large female ensemble, the biggest eye candy here, however, belongs to a guy----the delicious-looking Chris Lowell who plays Stuart, Skeeter's love interest.  Lowell is the biggest dreamboat to come off the Hollywood pin-up boy assembly line in quite some time.  With deep warm brown eyes and a tempting dimple, Lowell is seen all too briefly, but still manages to melt the screen everytime he appears.  Why this gorgeous cutie is not getting more Hollywood roles is beyond me.

The Help starts slowly, but still draws you in.  At first you think the movie is about Southern bridge parties and ladies luncheons.  As the movie progresses, the layers peel back to expose raw emotions as we confront our own prejudices and biases.  What I like about the movie is it doesn't get preachy, but uses characters we love or hate to face our own views on racism.  On that level, the movie becomes powerful and serves as a history lesson.  Facing Racism can be painful because it will always hide behind a pretty facade.",1481500800,,2329,4.606796116504855

4303131,3,B004A8ZWVU,The pacing seemed off to me-the movie lagged in places and seemed far too fast in others. I was also disappointed with Emma Stone's acting in the beginning of the movie.

4303132,5,B004A8ZWVU,"My husband and I watched this last night.  I knew I would like it because I had read the book some time ago.  At first he just thought it was another one of my nutty movies, but by the end he was enjoying it.  The movie does follow along with the book fairly well, but I think there were some changes they made to make it fit into a standard movie length.  It helps one understand the movie to have lived in the deep south during the period involved, whether one is black or white.  It may be a little painful to blacks who did not already live through the era. I'm white, and we never were of the economic strata that had ""help,"" but as a small child I was already wide eyed at the segregation the adults in the family had to explain to me, and I was in high school when the first black students came to our school.  There is enough humor in the book and movie to make it enjoyable.  If even halfway inclined to do so, you should indeed see this movie.",1470441600,16,953,4.037234042553192

4303178,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I read this book a few years ago and absolutely loved it. That's why I made sure to see this film in its first opening days. I've seen some other film adaptations of books lately and have been disappointed. And so I must say that I was completely delighted with the film adaptation of ""The Help"". Not only did it stay true to the book, it was so well cast that every character rang true. I laughed. I cried. And I felt real emotion throughout.

The story is set in Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960's. Emma Stone is cast as a young white college graduate who yearns to be taken seriously as a writer. Her first job is writing a column on cleaning house in the local paper and so she starts interviewing the African American women who work as maids in the homes of her friends. Immediately, her eyes are opened to the realities of their lives and decides to turn her knowledge into an eventual book.

Viola Davis is excellent in the role of Aibileen who gives the child she cares for an abundance of love and attention. Octavia Spencer is cast as Minnie, another maid with a strong personality who is full of grit and gumption. And Bryce Dally Howard is cast as Hilly, an obnoxious young white social-climbing woman who we all love to hate.

The plot moves swiftly and even though the film is 2-1/2 hours long, I was so caught up in it that I didn't want it to end. Here was a snapshot in a time of racial prejudice and the exploitation of household help in a era that has hopefully passed into history. And yes, it also has its bittersweet comedic moments which made the film even more endearing. I loved this film. Don't miss it.",1469577600,14,1635,4.354098360655738

I could have just paid for the movie from VUDU and it would have worked better but I wanted a physical copy too for the living room and back up.

The physical movie box and copies of the movie are fine and as promised. Highly recommend the actual movie itself.

It's so realistic and touching. Didn't win enough awards! This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I love a movie where the actors make the characters so real you forget they are acting. My only criticism is the casting of Allison Janey. As much as I absolutely love her as CJ in the West Wing and she's hilarious and lovable on Mom she just doesn't fit the part of a classy, pageant winning southern lady. Her voice is screechy, accent very phony and simply does not carry herself as a southern belle. (sorry Ms. Janey)",1462492800,,693,4.552

Make sure if you watch this you also read the book by Kathryn Stockett because it has a lot more detail than the movie.  Like all movies there is a lot edited out or glossed over that is in the book but the movie is still good and is able to lend more to some sections with facial expressions that are lacking in the book.  I would definitely recommend  both together.  I used the movie as a refresher for the book while I was writing  the paper for my class.

Where has all the time gone?

My wife and I saw this at a early showing in the middle of the week when it first came out - the theater was about 50% full which is pretty good for the 2PM time slot. Acting is very good - plot was well developed and interesting. It is based on the 2009 book of the same name. It was meant to be a semi remembrance of the authors young adulthood (right after college) in the South. It is told by 3 different people - two of them black household workers. It not only showed how the black help was mistreated but also how the social norm for the period dictated the author get married in spite of not really wanting to because that's a everyone expected. The author's mom viewed her college diploma as a nice piece of paper and nothing more.

Picture, as you would expect from a Blu-ray, was nearly perfect - sound was excellent as well.

This is a movie that nearly everyone should see so they will know how much our world has changed - at least in certain areas.

I would rate this a very high 9.0 to 9.5 out of 10 - VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR NEARLY EVERYONE!",1456012800,5,1127,4.127853881278539

Thanks to the writer, the producer for the story and production and to Mary Jane Blige for the terrific song.  Incredible character portrayal  - both the good and the bad ones. Story of the terrible time of common segregation in the deep South and the courage of a few women, who represent so many more.  Plenty of surprises - I love the stories of the senior-most women in the story, the character of Skeeter and of course the incredible 'Help'  Journalists still need to tell many important stories of the pain of discrimination and African Americans unfortunately still need lots of courage to deal with it and its results from decades of pain, suffering and economic disparity it has caused.

By the same token, there are people like Skeeter in the south who fought with the black people shoulder to shoulder for the liberty and rights of the black people.

Lord knows there have been plenty of times that I wished I could have made some of Minny's chocolate pie and given it to my boss!  Now I get why their stories had to be told.

4304442,4,B004A8ZWVU,"That pretty much sums up 2011s heralded The Help, which stars Emma Stone as an aspiring journalist who encourages black maids (Viola Davis & Octavia Spencer) to chronicle their experiences for an article as the Civil Rights Movement kicks into full gear in 1963 Jackson, Mississippi. Bryce Dallas Howard is on hand as the uppity biyatch and Jessica Chastain plays an amiable Marilyn Monroe-ish housewife.

I like films that involve rural blacks, like Mississippi Burning (1988) and Waterproof (2000), and The Help falls into this category. The movie provides a window into early 60s Southern culture and the plight of black women. Despite being snooty, Bryce looks great and Jessica looks even better, nice and curvy (she reportedly gained 15 lbs. for the role, which I wish shed keep). Emma is effective as the protagonist, but shes too good-looking for the role since it calls for an early 20s woman whos never been asked out on a date. Why sure! Nevertheless, this is a solid period drama with authentic Mississippian locations.

The movie runs 146 minutes and was shot in Clarksdale, Greenwood and Jackson, Mississippi.

I thought it would bother me that they cast Emma Stone who is not exaggeratedly tall as the main character is supposed to be, but they didn't focus on Skeeter's height in the movie. I thought they worked around it very well. I really enjoyed Jessica Chastain's performance, and of course, Octavia Spencer. They both gave brilliant, spot-on depictions of their characters, and Ms. Spencer truly deserved that Oscar!

As certain characters show their true personalities, you become so angry that you want to slap them through the screen. There are times where you want to reach out and hug Jessica Chastain's character, as you really feel for the journey she's experiencing.

4304612,4,B004A8ZWVU,"4 out of 5 because I don't like having my heartbroken. I love this movie. No corny ending, just reality. Yes wonderful things do happen, but when you are courageous and strong, expect opposition. A I said, this movie did break my heart. It wasn't just another movie about race. It was a revisiting of what could have been real events in a day when I was not alive. It reminds me of how courage is in the heart and not in the color of one's skin. It moves me and motivates me to have the courage, and the gall to do what it is right even if it's not popular. Skeeter makes herself an advocate for human rights by writing a book about the experiences of African-American housemaids in the 1960's. The turmoil is not in the fact that she writes the book - most of it comes from seeing a woman who sees African American people as human beings while her friends and neighbors see them as subhuman. Skeeter's intention is not to hurt anyone, but by doing the right thing, she is. At the end of it all, she's lost all of her friends, but gained some new ones. If you are okay with crying some, go ahead and watch this movie. Cecily Tyson's performance as Constantine is absolutely beautiful. At 90 years old, this woman can get a standing ovation from me with her acting. I didn't know I could be affected so deeply by a performance. Though her role is a supporting one, it's one of the best in the film in my opinion. The other actors and actresses also did well, my other favorite being Viola Davis. Emma Stone convinced me that she is a versatile actress, and Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain were a good duo. There is some swearing which I don't like, but overall a good movie to watch with tissues nearby.",1434758400,,1707,4.320872274143302

4304618,5,B004A8ZWVU,"The Help
 Even in a year of mediocrity in films like this one, if you wait long enough, a terrific film will come along.  The Help finally give 2011 a great or at least near great movie to mark the year.  This film has everything needed in a fine film.  The acting is first rate, the direction unobtrusive and the writing crisp and above all believable.
 Major kudos must go to Tate Taylor.  Whoever he was he is now the toast of Hollywood.  Mr. Taylor wrote the script from the novel by Kathryn Stockett.  He also directed the film.  He also, and this will work well for him financially, served as executive producer.  The film held the top spot at the box office for two consecutive weeks, ending with a ten day take of $96 million.  Since Taylor managed to make this movie for only $25, he and his fellow producers stand to become overnight millionaires.  His previous attempt at big screen success, another triple role with himself as writer, director and producer, gathered a ludicrous six thousand dollars at the box office.
 Hollywood new sensation Emma Stone in her first major dramatic role plays Skeeter, a just graduated would-be writer in 1963 Jackson Mississippi.  We know the date because part of the social background is the murder of equal rights advocate Medgar Evers, a black activists shot in the back in his own driveway by a KKK killer with a room temperature IQ.
 Skeeter, fresh from school, becomes increasingly appalled at the racial oppression reflected it the day to day lives of the people she has known all her life.  The whites are casually brutal, psychologically, legally and physically.  The blacks are frightened (with good reason-Evers was far from the only man shot down in segregationist Mississippi) and are at the mercy of a merciless system of overreaching oppression.  As a new writer, Skeeter takes it on as her task to record the stories of the maids in Jackson.
 Two of the maids are played by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer.  Davis is being talked about already for an Oscar nomination.  The suffering, the endurance and finally the courage of the maids are brought to our own movie screen by this pair of outstanding actors in a way that is moving audiences all over the country.  Bring a hanky.
 Among the supporting actors are Sissy Spacek (who also supported in last years finest drama, Get Low), Mary Steenburgen and an incandescent Cicely Tyson as the black maid who raised Skeeter.  Strong supporting roles are also provided by the women who play the peers of Skeeter, women who have married well and now employ the black maids.  We hate them, which means they did their job as actors.
 The Help un-reels for two hours and 17 minutes, which is good value for money.  It is rated PG-13 for theme only, there is none of the foul language and superfluous nudity that mars some films.  This four saw blade movie comes highly recommended.  This is the one film that is a must see so far in 2011.  You must see it.",1434412800,,2960,4.6365384615384615

4304627,5,B004A8ZWVU,"It isn't often that I reach the end of a book and want to read it again.  I had seen this book in the bookstore for so long and never wanted to read about the perpetuation of segregation in Jackson, Mississippi in 1962.  Yet, the preview of the movie adaptation of this book inspired me to pick it up, and I am so glad I did!

We are quickly introduced to a group of young white women, Skeeter, Hilly, and Elizabeth, who have been friends since childhood, and two African-American women, Aibileen and Minnie who work as the women's ""help.""  The book is told from the perspective of Aibileen, Minnie, and Skeeter, who just graduated from college and is attempting to figure out what to do with her life.  As a woman, it is very difficult for her to obtain employment as anything other than a secretary, and her mother wants her only to be married and have a family.

Skeeter is provided a unique opportunity to write and submit a book that a publishing company might publish.  Determined to address the racial injustices around her, Skeeter enlists the help of Aibileen and Minnie to publish a collection of stories from them and other women about their experience as ""the help.""  At times, the women's involvement with the book threatens their livelihood and their lives.  But they are determined to continue.

The racial tension in the town is described early on.  A discussion among Skeeter's friends describes their fear of catching diseases from African-Americans by using the same toilet seat.  To remedy this fear, Hilly, a domineering woman who fully supports segregation, suggests that her friend Elizabeth build a bathroom in her garage just for the help.  When Elizabeth builds the toilet, Aibileen is forced to show her approval for it, though the author does an excellent job of portraying the utter humiliation she feels.  Later in the book, I was shocked with the story of an African-American man who is beaten blind because he used a bathroom for whites only, even though there wasn't a sign that the toilet was segregated.

The author does an excellent job of crafting voices for the women that are individual to them.  While the book tackles a very serious subject, the story is full of humor and warmth that leaps off the pages.  We also see how Aibileen does small things to teach the young girl she takes care of that all people are equal regardless of the color of their skin.  Hilly is an antagonist we love to hate and in the end, she will get exactly what she deserves!

At times the plot was a bit predictable.  Take for example, the relationship between Skeeter and her boyfriend.  We know his political father supports segregation and that Skeeter's book and opinions will not be tolerated by her boyfriend.  Skeeter is also shunned from her organizations and loses her friends because her stance on desegregation is not understood.  A funny part in the book is when Skeeter reluctantly includes Hilly's add for building toilets for the help in a monthly women's group newletter, and to show her opposition to the idea, she tells everyone to drop off any unwanted toilets on Hilly's front lawn.  As you can imagine, Hilly is furious when there are dozens of old toilets in her yard!

The process of writing the book and its ultimate publication has a deep and lasting effect on everyone involved with the project.  The stories in Skeeter's book show how the women are not even paid minimum wage and are often mistreated.  But there are other stories that show that the friendships forged between the white women and their help which were genuine and cherished.  The publication of the book forces the white women to examine their help and themselves.  Skeeter's generosity is displayed when she shares the compensation she receives for the book evenly with everyone who gave her a story for it. Ultimately, Skeeter is more self-assured, leaves for New York, single, and ready to take on the world.  Aibileen takes over a column in the newspaper answering domestic questions, and Minnie finds the strength to leave an abusive husband.

I would recommend this book to every woman I know.  I don't think men would be as excited about the book's content, but anyone who enjoys historical fiction, a determined protagonist who challenges social norms, and humor in unlikely places will enjoy this book!",1433894400,,4324,4.77792732166891

The early civil rights movement from the perspective of maids in Mississippi is very unique.  We talked a lot once the movie was over and my kids were shocked that this sort of treatment of people took place not so long ago.  Anything that keeps the conversations going is worth my time to watch.  Helping my kids understand the world they live and why certain things are considered a big deal is important.  They are growing up well after the events in the story and are sometimes confused by racial divides.  There is good in that because that means it's not as prevalent today but understanding our history is essential to avoid repeating it's ugly parts.  This is a great way to glean a fresh perspective on a recent time period in our country.",1433635200,,925,4.458333333333333

4304702,4,B004A8ZWVU,"This is one of the few movies that was an improvement over the book in character modification. Celia Foote keeps her naivet but loses her near-mental imbalance. Charlotte Phelan is given much more humility regarding her attitude toward her daughter and her firing of Constantine. Elizabeth caves in to Hilly by firing Aibileen, but judging by her reaction to Mae Mobley's grief,  one hopes that she will re-think her attitude toward her daughter and be the mother that she should be.  Hilly is given one less child but is still...Hilly. Yule May was wrong to take Hilly's ring and pawn it, but she certainly didn't deserve to be roughed up and get 4 years in prison for it. Hopefully, Book Minny ended up taking her children and moving in with Johnny and Celia after Leroy got fired, etc., as it implies she did in the movie. Lord knows they have the room and they both genuinely like her. Aibileen was prepared to move on in both book and movie.

4304741,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I grew up in the south as a white man during the timeline of this film. However, there is something about stories where justice is being denied someone for being born a different color. that makes me want to cheer for the underdog. This is that film. If you were a woman in the 1960's in Mississippi, you became a maid, cleaned rich white women's homes, and became a surrogate parent for the babies.

Seen this movie at least four times, if my wife is present, and it is showing, we're good for seeing it again and again.

Skeeter, a young white girl, returns back from journalism school, finding her maid and surrogate parent Constantine missing, and no one will tell her what happened. She tries to get a job at a local newspaper with no previous experience, and is allowed that she can write the domestics column. (cleaning and other domestic household tips.) She has no background in this, and quickly enlists one of her friends maids as her source. as she goes deeper into this relationship, she finds that a black maid named Aibileen has been keeping a diary of her life's experiences. She shows this to Skeeter, and tells her of a story of how her only son was mortally injured in a sawmill, and because he was black, was taken, and not too quickly, and abandoned in front of the hospital, where he died. Skeeter asked her what it was like to take care of white people's children. This caused her to decide to write a book about this, which was, in the time, possibly illegal.

Skeeter sends her beginning script to a NY publisher, who insists that one source is not enough, that she needs at least a dozen. The black maids in the community don't trust her, since she is white and they have everything to lose. Minnie, who is an outspoken maid, joins the ranks and tells her story.

In the meantime, her mother's cancer is progressing, Skeeter meets and starts dating a man who is involved in politics, and her friend Hilly from her youth starts to press her to publish an article about ""separate but equal,"" legislation that is being pushed to attempt to create separate bathrooms in white home so their maids don't use the same bathrooms. This is heralded as the best thing, because it can avoid the spreading of the many diseases carried in colored people's urine. Skeeter continually resists her efforts to force publication of the details of the initiative, which drive a wedge between Skeeter and Hilly.

Hilly is Minnie's boss, and fires her. One of Hilly's former beaus, Johnny, married a girl from the wrong side of the tracks named Celia. Johnny is a successful, good-natured man, who loves Celia, Celia can't cook, and somehow is black-listed and none of the maids will work for her. Then comes Millie. Celia is desperate to have Millie work for her, so much so, that Millie is suspicious. Well, there is a catch. She has to show up after Johnny leaves and leave before he gets home. Celia has none of the aristocratic aire of the other rich white snobs, and sets her plate next to Minnie's one day and forces her to eat with her, out of sheer loneliness. Minnie stands by her and teaches her how to cook, and helps her bury her miscarried babies. The love between the two grows.

One of the maids needs only $75 to help her son enter college, and her bosses refuse to even consider a loan. The same maid later moves some furniture and finds a piece of jewelry, which she sells at a pawn shop. She is subsequently arrested and jailed, and the dam burst, bringing more maids to Skeeter to tell her story.

The funniest part of the book is where Minnie goes back to Hilly's with her famous chocolate pie, with one secret ingredient, some of her own **it in it. Once Hilly has eaten a full piece of pie, and has started a second, she continues to belittle and degrade Minnie. She can't hold her tongue. Hilly says, 'Have you lost your mind?'  She says, 'No ma'am, but you're fixing to lose yours.' She then tells her the secret ingredient. She loses it, and Hilly's mother starts laughing hysterically and says, 'Run Millie, run."" This story is then added to the book as insurance that the Jackson women, especially Hilly, will never admit that this is about Jackson.

Skeeter is ready to publish, almost. She has one more story to tell. What happened to Constantine, her surrogate mother? She confronts her mother and finds that the mistreatment also comes from her family. Skeeter gets her book published, and it becomes a best-seller. Her beau breaks up with her when he finds out, and she receives a job offer in NY.

This is not just a book about white versus-black, or ""white guilt."" As you can see, some of the heroes of the story were white. This is a story about people being mistreated, people reaching beyond what is considered the socially acceptable barriers of their class to help those who are being mistreated. This is a great movie, and if you don't like it, perhaps you got too much ""Hilly"" in you.",1428796800,,4931,4.549041713641488

4304830,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I remember my Mother saying, ""You've GOT to see this movie!""  I caught the tail end of the civil rights years and saw the racism and I couldn't understand why my Mother (who had black help herself and wasn't too nice to them) was so keen on this movie.  After it came out on DVD I watched and I loved it!  I know all these people yelling about racism and slavery.  It was a historical look at the way things USED TO BE!  Keeping a historical subject in the eye of the public makes sure you know what went on so it doesn't happen again.  You don't hear Jewish people bitching about documentaries on Auschwitz!  NO!  They say to show it at it's ugliest so people today know what happened.  I didn't read the book and people say it was disappointing because it didn't really stick to the book.  I can only speak for the movie.  I thought it was handled very well because it is still a sensitive subject.  I can personally tell you that there were others things that were more horrible that could have been shown - but it didn't.  It does show things starting to right itself.  So if you are going to be offended by black women working in white homes during segregation then just don't watch it.  It was like stepping back in time.  The home interiors.  The costumes.  The vehicles.  I saw many southern homes that looked exactly like that back in that era.  I thought Sissy Spacek was PERFECT!  I have known so many southern women like her.  The subject matter is very real.  I do remember some of it although I was very little.  I thought it was handled very well and it is an interesting story.

I've watched this movie for the first time this past weekend, and I loved it. I laughed and cried all throughout the movie, and oh, how I hated Hilly! I cheered during the pie scene and laughed my tail off when she read about it in the book. The scene when Constantine looked at the growth marks for Rachel and Skeeter, and reached up to touch Skeeter's last mark, had me practically sobbing. This movie was remarkable, and I absolutely have to read the book now. I usually read it first, but didn't manage it this time; I will enjoy rectifying that.

Found myself clicking it on from time to time, watching parts of it, hating all the commercials and the scenes that were cut, so I broke down and bought it.  Of course the 60's are ""my"" era, that's when I was in my teens, and my family background is Southern, but it isn't just me - everyone loves this movie.  It was up for a couple of Oscars; very well written and acted,  Funny parts, sad,, poignant parts, shows how Southern belles lived and how their black maids lived.  A great slice of ""Americana""; its a good history lesson for young people who weren't around then as to how the 60's really were for normal, middle class people; today, all we see of the 60's are the wild, stoned hippies - fun, but not typical of mainstream America.

It's a story, set in the 1950s, of women of courage taking action about an important issue our country continues to  wrestle with today, and is well worth seeing for the history alone. But the storytelling itself is flawed - the latter third of the film relies on stereotypes of Southerners on both sides of the black/white color line. Some are almost cartoon-like. The writer then hangs the denouement on a plot device that's more like an urban legend or an anecdote, instead of a serious attempt to conclude the film in a way that balances and/or resolves the very real issue raised in the first part of the film. I'd recommend the film for its intent, historic content, and some very good storytelling and performances for its first two-thirds, but could not in honesty give the film as high a rating as I wanted to or as the topic deserves. Give it a look-see and decide for yourself.",1419292800,,919,4.536144578313253

Really made you think It does us good to empathize with others in our own lives and treat others with the dignity we would like from others. Maybe Jesus' words of treating others as we would like to be treated by them rang true here in many moments. Well, at least the moments not dealing with pie! Wish the DVD had more extras.

I lived through them in the South and the contradictions and realities of how Blacks were often treated does ring true. Sure not everyone was as vacuous as these southern belles, but enough were to remember the bathrooms  in public that were clearly marked , men,women, and colored.  You would not think of using the same bathroom. In college, we did not allow blacks, now integrated, to take swimming classes, because that would mean that we were ""bathing "" with them!
Oh yes, the times have changed for the better. Nice to look back and laugh at how ridiculous it all was. And she captures the dialect  so well!

And I am ashamed to say that I finally understood some of the behaviors I witnessed from a beloved maid -- like using the downstairs toilet, eating separately, putting ""Miss"" in front of my first name.

The movie is true to the spirit of the original book, highlighting the subtle and not so subtle forms of discrimination practiced by white employers against black domestic employees. And, at the same time, the essential services those same employees provided for those white families. It's also a testimonial to the bravery some individuals (both white and black) were able to show that spurred the civil rights movement of the 60s and beyond.

4305054,5,B004A8ZWVU,"The Help is a film adaptation of the novel of the same title by Kathryn Stockett. It is  is about a young white woman, Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan, and her relationship with two black maids, Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson during Civil Rights era America in the early 1960's. The three very different, extraordinary women in Mississippi build an unlikely friendship around a secret writing project that breaks societal rules and puts them all at risk. From their improbable alliance a remarkable sisterhood emerges, instilling all of them with the courage to transcend the lines that define them, and the realization that sometimes those lines are made to be crossed-even if it means bringing everyone in town face-to-face with the changing times.

Though arguably guilty of glossing over its racial themes, the film rises on the strength of its cast. Outstanding performances and a delicate approach to racial tensions make this film a cut above other inspirational period dramas. Aimed at heart and conscience, it may have overdone moments but remain worthy of close attention. Perfectly written, acted, directed, and produced, it's as moving on its fiftieth viewing as on its first. Definitely,the best film of the year when it was released.",1416268800,,1242,5.174129353233831

Some characters in this film are beautiful inside and out, while others are ugly inside, cruel even... Just for the sake of being cruel. It's very satisfying to see those monsters get put in their places! If only there were more kind and beautiful people even today, the world would be a much better place to live in.

4305170,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I read the book immediately before watching the movie again. There were absolutely changes made between the two but what I really like about the movie is that the changes made sense to me. The mother is much better in the movie but it's very hard to show mother daughter love in a strained relationship through visuals. It's much easier to understand Skeeter's feelings when you have an inner dialogue. There were also other small changes but did not take away from the story, I don't think. The movie itself was emotional and thought provoking. I really enjoyed it.",1411344000,,566,4.7272727272727275

4305236,3,B004A8ZWVU,"The Help is a new film based on a novel by Kathryn Stockett that has as garnered its fair share of praise,
criticism, and controversy. Not surprisingly, the film version has been heralded as Oscar-worthy, panned
as melodrama, and judged as doing more harm than good for the race relations subject matter it seeks
to address.
The Help is the story of a white journalist who gets a crazy idea in early 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. The
idea: to capture the true stories of black maids working for white families throughout the town. The
story told captures the agony of those maids, the varied emotions from white employers, and the mood
of the town and country at a volatile time in our history.
I took none of the critic notes with me before seeing The Help so I had a fresh eye or sorts. Is the film a
tear-jerker? Sure. But it is a schmaltzy tear-jerker that uses gimmicks to evoke emotion? Absolutely not.
Funny that even its worse critics will honor a stellar cast for performances that are simply outstanding.
Lets remember that these actors are reading from an outstanding script as well. And truly each one
provides an Oscar-worthy performance.
Viola Davis plays Aibileen Clark, caretaker for a young couples toddler daughter. To say her
performance is convincing is a gross understatement. The way she cares for the child, tells her how she
is pretty and importantpriceless. I can already see her standing in front of the Academy accepting her
award. And equally as impressive is the performance of Octavia Spencer as Minny Jackson, another maid
who reluctantly agrees to tell her story. Once she opens that door, she soon learns that it is indeed a
flood gateand her character reports on a litany of abuses.
Several of the abuses Minny reports stem from interactions with her current employer, Hille Holbrook,
masterfully played by Ron Howards daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard. Also noteworthy is the
performance of Jessica Chastain as Celia Footewho hires Minny after Hille fires her. An outsider in the
community, Celia shows a positive side to the domestic help story. And lastly Emma Stone is superb as
the white journalist, Skeeter Phelan, who encourages the help to tell their true stories.",1408406400,,2200,4.885026737967914

Some of the things that they chose to leave out and some of the things that were outright redone made the story much ""less"" than the book.

4305306,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I am new to the Amazon instant video service and there is a little bit of a learning curve to understanding how the service works. So this review includes both a review of the service as well as the movie itself. I was looking to perhaps buy the movie since my cable service I needed to subscribe to one of premium services such a HBO or Showtime or Starr I am not sure which when I came across the instant video service. I rented the movie using the instant video service; I found the video service to be great in a number of areas compared to my cable service. Video service allows you 30 days from the time you paid to rent the movie before you must start to watch the movie. Once you start to watch the movie you have a normal 3 day rental, my cable service for the most part has a two rental allowance.
The movie The Help is a very good educational film about the old south on how far we have come since the days of slavery but still need to do more to overcome discrimination that still go on in some parts of the south to this day. I am really into these types of movies and recommend this to all want to study the ways of the old south after the civil war.",1406073600,,1164,4.043290043290043

4305369,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I grew up in this era in the south so may be more conversant with the issues portrayed in this wonderful movie than some.  I did not live in a family that had  fulltime ""help"" as in the movie, but I knew there were families that did although I didn't know firsthand if any of them were mistreated as I never saw it personally as a child.  But even as a young child I was troubled by what I did know and by segregation in general.  Even though I loved growing up in the south there were things of that era that were greatly troubling and embarrassing for so many of us including the killing of Medgers in MS and the church bombing in B'ham. Integration was a hard fought battle but was eventually achieved to a much greater degree than some in the north realize.  But this movie does depict some of the worst of that era but also some of the best on both sides.  I highly recommend it.",1404000000,,884,4.140350877192983

I have a hard time watching movies that show cruelty to people or animals so I was really nervous about what this might show. I was able to handle this because the worst acts of cruelty were told to us rather than shown. (Some things you can't un-see once they are burned into your memory!) I think it's really important to remind people where we came from, however, so we don't take our freedom for granted. Emma Stone and Viola Davis are excellent in this movie! I loved getting to know their characters and watching their journey. Jessica Chastain's character was so refreshing in her honesty and lack of pretense. This movie would not have been the same without Octavia Spencer's character who provided some of the humor but also the strength! I thoroughly enjoyed this film and feel it is deserving of it's numerous accolades!",1403740800,,945,4.664670658682635

For the most part I think it's because I grew up with 'southern' grandparents and many of the things that happen in the movie and the myriad of props used (food, furniture, costume, etc.) remind me so much of my growing up.",1403481600,,426,4.271604938271605

Along with the other cast members ~ esp Bryce Dallas Howard, Viola Davis & Octavia Spencer ~ Ms Stone does not disappoint. There really is so much good to say about this movie that I hardly know where to start, where to stop.
So I will simply end it here...by saying *keeping a long story short* that I highly recommend this movie!! Moving plot, flowing storyline that does not stop, excellent cast, touching & humorous ""human"" scenes, some real redeeming qualities ...if this movie had not been made already, I would be wishing that it would be!!",1403049600,,686,4.409448818897638

4305383,4,B004A8ZWVU,Some have labeled The Help as a chick flick but I disagree. Instead it is a moving drama that appeals to anyone interested in a strong story and strong characters and who have an appreciation of history. The film walked a fine line between covering a painful era and entertaining a diverse audience.,1402704000,,299,4.660377358490566
4305384,5,B004A8ZWVU,I'm the kind of person who typically doesn't like to watch the movie after I've read the book.  My own imagination tends to be more colorful than any Hollywood director's.  This was not the case with this movie.  The actors/actresses selected for this movie were perfect.  The scenes and costumes were perfect for the setting.  This was a great movie to watch with my younger kids who weren't able to digest the book.  Awesome movie!,1402704000,,433,4.706666666666667
4305385,5,B004A8ZWVU,what a remarkable movie!  Such an insight and the characters are very well developed. I could watch it again and again,1402531200,,118,4.619047619047619
4305386,4,B004A8ZWVU,"I found this movie to be very entertaining, heartwarming, and an interesting approach to a complex issue.  Having grown up in the South and having the loving support of a Black domestic worker as a child, I could certainly identify with the situations being depicted in the film.  To entertain it may have been necessary for the film to overstate the forces of good and evil and to overly exaggerate characters and their unique personalities.  This may have made the injustice of Jim Crow laws more easily understood by the viewers, many of which have no remembrance of the days when there were separate bathrooms for Blacks and Whites and different water fountains in department stores.

To the degree that this film entertains while simultaneously exposing contemporary audiences to the racial injustices of the past, then the film succeeds. Whereas the film makes reference to the assassinations of Medgar Evans and President Kennedy, it is not a documentary in any sense of the word.  For the most part the film shows that suppression of one race by another for financial gain and dominance requires group norms that support racism and injustice rationalized.  Of course within any social network there are enforcers who make sure everyone in the pack follows the pack rules and the character of Hilley is a great depiction of the person who is an opinion leader in a community and enforces pack norms, in this case racism.

The character of Skeeter is also very interesting for her challenging attitude to the racial norms of her community.  I think the film made good point that her liberal attitude had its origins in the loving relationships she had with the domestic worker that worked for 29 years in her parents home. Black women who loved and cared for privileged White children were in fact were engaged in the most radical of social actions, love of another.  Of course not all privileged White children had their eyes open to the hardships, unfairness, injustice, and poverty that the White ruling class inflicted upon the Black population. But there were those like Skeeter for whom the loving relationship formed the basis for courage to act against strict social norms of the community.

There is a reason I did not give the film 5 stars and selected 4 instead.  For those of us who lived in the era of the 1950s and 60s knows that violence was used against Blacks to deprive them of economic and political rights. They could rent but no mortgages companies could give a Black family a mortgage to buy a home.  There were constant social cues that Blacks were less than human and should be given the most menial service jobs. Skeeter and the Black women of Jackson Mississippi were taking a much greater risk of being murdered than the film depicts.

Narrative flow requires conflicts and resolutions, tensions building and resolutions that seem fair to the viewer.  Therefore there are many scenes in the film that are not very realistic but they are entertaining. This was a story, sometimes a bit overstated and sometimes understated, but it remained entertaining and attempted to deal with a topic of considerable emotional impact for the United States even 150 years after the Emancipation Proclamation.",1402444800,2,3226,4.90625

The Help is excellent no matter what medium you're using.  I saw the movie first, and did not know until the credits rolled it was based on a book.  I was impressed enough (more than) with the movie to seek out the paper version and was as enthralled with its characters and story line as I'd been watching the film.

4305395,5,B004A8ZWVU,"If you haven't seen this movie, you should. The acting is award winning and the cast is right on cue with emotion, body language and facial expressions. It's not only a story about how poorly 'The Help' was treated before and during the civil rights movement, it's about a young woman who is sympathetic and wants to change things by telling 'their story.' She demonstrates that she has what it takes to be strong and independent and show courage in the face of those who like things the way they are and do not want change. She definitely comes into her own and helps the others to realize they are stronger than they appear on the surface.

it and could not put it down untill I had finished. Sometimes I got so mad and wanted to speak up to the maids to talk back or slap them in the face. The black women nursed the white babies and yet could not eat at the same table!  They took care of the children as their own and yet could not use the family bathroom.

I watch this movie at least once a week, not kidding. I know that the director was childhood friend's with the author and that's great because together they made this incredible movie. I'm hard to impress and for me to watch something more than once, let alone once a week, is a testament. The casting was perfect, the outfits, props, I feel like I'm in the early 1960s just by watching. Perhaps it's because I relate to Skeeter, who wants to write and doesn't necessarily fit in with her peers, so she goes against the grain and suffers the consequences. I'm always sad when it's over! This is hands down my favorite movie ever.",1401235200,,800,4.486301369863014

I like how this movie saw humor in the difficult times some of our American women endured, as we overcame slowly the mistakes our early government made. I am proud of the strong people that worked to overcome those that resisted change, and was brave enough to stand up for those that were being treated unfairly.

The characters and plot were well developed. I also liked the fact that good was not portrayed as bad, nor bad as good. Characters were not rewarded for their wrongs; but, for the most part, suffered the consequences for their actions. I believe this is important, especially for youth who may watch this movie.  I've watched it twice already and plan to watch it again. Each time it's still refreshing. The main thing I disliked was the profanity (warning to those with children). Although realistic, I really could have done without it. Overall, a good watch. It exceeded my expectations. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a thought-provoking, inspiring and entertaining view into 1960's Southern life that won't weigh you down.",1398902400,,877,5.006849315068493

I read the book first (which I highly recommend) & although I was excited & looking forward to seeing the movie, I was prepared to feel some disappointment around character & plot development.  I anticipated a lack of details & depth, which the book offered the reader.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  Actually, I felt more connected to the characters in the film adaptation.  The cast of actors was extraordinary.  They  evoked an entirely new level of understanding, empathy & appreciation of the characters who brought this story together.  I have watched this movie with my daughters & it has become one of their favorites as well.  I can't say enough about this movie, except that it is one of those rare films that leave you feeling as if you just had a life changing, eye-opening experience.  I recommend this film to anyone & everyone who appreciates superb acting, incredible story lines & the opportunity to be taken along on a memorable journey.  I absolutely loved this movie!  The downside however is, I know I won't see another movie this great, for a very long time.",1396396800,,1218,4.770334928229665

The nation was under transition and this captured the picture of this transition very well.  It was very good to know that some of the younger children of one of the actors would see  fruition.

My family, thankfully trated our help with love and respect. We children truly felt that our maid was part of the family.
However, most maids worked long hours for little pay.
I remember that our maid was paid only $5.00 a day( this was 1956 until around 1966,)

Just like the book.our maid help raise me and then my first born for several years.
The book is so interesting because you get to hear the help's perspective, which we never thought to ask about.
Sadly we assumed they were happy and grateful to have a job.
I enjoy Amazon's Instant Video so much.",1395964800,,731,4.455223880597015

4305540,5,B004A8ZWVU,"""The Help"" is simply an excellent and charming film dealing with the race issue in the South of the United States in the early 1960's. The story is a simple one in which the viewer is shown how blacks were treated by whites in a very unflattering way. Most black women at the time worked as Nanny's or housekeepers for rich white women and the movies dramatizes the kinds of relationships these were and the drama that unfolded from it.

 I sat through the first showing of this movie in my Entertainment Room in awe as I had not seen a film this good in years!

 ""The Help"" was nominated for four Oscars including Best Picture and won the Academy Award, deservedly,  for Octavia Spencer in the Outstanding Supporting Actress category.

 The film was a box office smash earning over $200,000,000 on a $25,000,000 budget.",1395446400,,820,4.613793103448276

In looks, manner, and an easy, natural responsiveness with the story and characterizations.  As are all of them, exceptional in each role, with heart-pounding, with nearly unnoticeable restraint while the incivility of being alive there and then assaults each and everyone involved.

It just didn't happen.  An enormous ""fail"" as far as believability.  She's tried to use 60's social issues as a vehicle to make the rest seem realistic.  It barely works.

At the same time it contrasts the very oppressed African American population and their fears and the caste system within their own culture and how they all blended together the post WW II south.  It's an emotional journey that highlights the insecurities of each culture. It also shows how a partial percentage of a culture, in this case the racists, rule the rest of society by instilling fear and oppression utilizing the public eye.  In that aspect not much has changed since the 50's. The only problem with the film as with most films of this genre is that the racists are portrayed as the majority of the caucasian population.

4305665,4,B004A8ZWVU,"Great story, great acting, love this movie. I do wonder however, (on the directors part) whether the representations of the snooty southern women are bigoted? That was tough times back then, and to see these stories just bring tears to my eyes! A must see movie.",1390780800,,262,4.717391304347826

4305667,5,B004A8ZWVU,I love this movie because I grew up as a white child in the 50's with a black baby sitter. It is a must see for all ages to help people understand where we all came from and why we needed change.,1390694400,,195,3.6666666666666665

4305669,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I saw this movie on the big screen at least twice.  I later purchased the dvd and watched it several more times (but who's counting).  It's not all about food or even helping.  It is a rich story that should be watched by everyone, no matter what age, race or religion.

The second time I saw it was in the theatre with varied age groups.  Most of the viewers had grey hair.  It was fun to hear the audience's response.  There was laughter, gasps and sighs at all the right moments.

I feel like the story is profound and one that must be told.",1390521600,,544,4.163461538461538
4305670,2,B004A8ZWVU,"This is a feel good movie for white people. I found it so watered down and incipid that it's almost an insult to history. The dangers of being black during the Jim Crow era went far beyond not using a toilet or going to jail for stealing from your employer. This sanitized treatment misses an opportunity to illustrate those dangers as they really were and not how we would prefer to remember them. History's important, let's respect it.",1390521600,,437,4.615384615384615
4305671,5,B004A8ZWVU,Very well done movie and a genuinely new idea for a plot. Nowadays movies are mostly cliche' situations that are targeted for certain outlets such as age groups or holidays or are simply rehashed subject matter so it's hardly worth the price of admission. Very few subjects warrant even one movie let alone a trilogy or more. This story is told well and concisely and the acting is compelling.,1390521600,,393,4.7101449275362315

4305676,5,B004A8ZWVU,"During this time I was living in Greenwood, MS, and later moved to Jackson where I live now.  There is a great deal in this movie that I was unaware of, such as people putting in a separate toilet for their help.  It just never occurred to me this was a factor in some folks' lives.  While I was raising my sons and had to work we had a wonderful black woman (funny, I didn't like typing that because I never thought of her like that) who took care of my children and my home. My dad raised us to regard all peoples with respect.  Our neighborhood was a melting pot - Chinese, Irish, Lebonese, black, Jew, Syrian, Italian - all within a two block radius,  And that in Greenwood MS.  All the children played together and there was no ugliness until the sixties.  Until that time, we also studied Bible scriptures in public school.  This gave our family a different set of values from most of the white people in our area and I remember having to keep a lot of my opinions to myself, but I wouldn't change my upbringing for anyone else's.

If this is based on a true story, than one could imagine certain parts being left out, so in some portions of the movie there is a sense of ""continuity"" that seems to be missing as well.  All in all, a very poignant story that speaks so intensely about a very horrible time in our history, that African Americans, who can identify with this period of time, I'm sure don't like to be reminded of such subject matters.",1390262400,,525,4.402061855670103

I'm glad I waited and got a little distance, but -- wow -- was I wrong!  This is a wonderful film -- book or no book -- fans of the book will be pleased, and those who have never read it will be knocked out.  Sharp dialogue, intense sense of place and time -- and, perhaps most importantly. flawless casting.  I believed every character, and loved so many its difficult to choose a favorite.  It's the story of a thread of hope in a dark and tumultuous time in American history.  Full of heartbreak, regret, a vision of the treatment of African Americans that would embarrass even the most ignorant of today.  But also:  humor, great story, and --- triumph.

Mother also worked along side the help all day.  When I had to go to work teaching school to help buy my own family a house in the late 60's, I paid my mother to have help twice a week since she kept my youngest child.  That way Mother could do her running around without a grandson one day a week.  I never had help except for babysitting needs. I guess I was one of those college graduate, multi-tasking women with a husband, three sons, a job, shopping, cooking, and cleaning.

4305736,4,B004A8ZWVU,"It's pure kitsch, aside from the performances of Cicely Tyson, Viola Davis, Sissy Spacek and  Ahna O'Reilly which were beautifully nuanced. Bryce Dallas Howard as the nasty Miss Hilly and Jessica Chastian as the good hearted  poor white ditz are so badly acted, so over the top, that they come off as caricatures. In the hands of finer actresses, all of their characteristics: the malicious racism concealed by a sugary exterior, and the pathetic vulnerability of the poor girl who made it to the big house, would have made this a much better effort.
There are some pretty good analyses made by other reviewers already why this book was a fairly simple minded feel good treatment of a tragic period in American history [ yes I did read it] , but if you can put your critical brain on hold and watch with your heart [ albeit a sentimental one] the movie is enjoyable.

Sometimes Octavia Spencer's fried chicken comments and the infamous poo-pie were a bit too much, but she too did well considering what she had to work with. Viola Davis, however, is the pivot around which the whole film turns, and if you have been privileged enough to know older ladies who grew up in the south and lived this reality, she will break your heart.

If you can find it please see Nothing but a Man, with Ivan Dixon and Abby Lincoln. I saw it more than 25 years ago and I haven't been able to forget it. It's a serious treatment of racism in the south and how one man tries to deal with it. Another film which I really thought well of at the time of its release is To Sleep with Anger, which uses African folk traditions and folkways from the deep south to tell the story of a trickster, played by Danny Glover, and his effect on a family he visits in L.A. Both films are superior to The Help.",1388707200,2,1774,4.399390243902439
4305737,3,B004A8ZWVU,"Everything about this movie is a condensed slice of life, where people & lifestyles are charactures, so that we might be sensitized to the overall issue (of racism). it is not light entertainment. Whatever the intent of this movie, I did not find it hilarious, I did not find it heart warming. It was well done visually. it was well cast. It had a lovely soundtrack. Was it well written ?Perhaps, but It did not resonate with me.  As a white female, born in the early 60's I never came into contact with this kind of racism. I've met alot of African Americans who retain alot of anger for how their people were treated in the past. This is a muted extension of that anger. It made me cringe, it made me sad. Is it funny to give someone a pie that you put excrement in ? I did not see this revenge as noble, or funny...but an angry, hateful thing putting the maid on the same hateful level as her former employer. I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but that one thing pretty much embodied a passive aggressive hate that all the ""help"" harbored  leveling the field of racism (for feeling in the movie),in that the white people acted hatefully & the Help also hated, but hid it, so, both races hated. I am glad for equal rights, but this movie  revisits a hurtful era & stirs up hurtful feeling that need to be put to rest.",1388707200,,1328,4.282868525896414
4305738,2,B004A8ZWVU,"I was raised in the South, and nobody I knew had maids. I'm sure this film expresses some truth, but there just might be some exaggeration here. We never treated anyone the way this film assumes that all whites treated blacks in those days. You cannot lump everybody into a mold and say that everybody is the same.",1388707200,4,314,4.431034482758621
4305739,4,B004A8ZWVU,"This movie is well made.  It will make you cry, laugh, and consider how wrong it is it think anyone is less than you are.  I recommend it.",1388620800,,138,3.892857142857143
4305740,3,B004A8ZWVU,"about a privileged single white woman and her two black maids.  Skeeter, frustrated with the restricted gender role of her social class, wondered about her long-time maid, Constantine, who disappeared from her family while she was away at Ole Miss in early 1960's.  She couldn't fit in with her friends because of their conservatism and narrow-mindedness of racist Mississippi culture.

After Hilly's racist proposal that every home has a separate toilet for the help and her mother's insulting comments toward the help, Skeeter decided to write a book about the help in Jackson Mississippi.  In order to do so, she has to have at least five maids/nannies.  Given the repressive racist nature of Jackson society, they refused to talk to Skeeter. Only one, Aibileen Clark, decided to be interviewed by her.  Even she didn't want to talk to her about the racism of Jackson's finest households because she feared punishment.

That movie sanitized that painful chapter of America's history by shoving the Civil Rights movement to the sidelines, with mentionings of Medgar Evers and the March on Washington.  Blacks in the South feared reprisals and even death if they dare to talk about those injustices.  In the movie, Blacks get fired when telling stories about working for upper class White families and their horrible treatment by them.  The only exception was Celia Foote, who is an outcast because she came from a lower-class background and whom the snobby, closed-minded upper class women of Jackson shun.

Then there's the matter of Skeeter's nanny, Constantine.  When Skeeter came back home from College, she was greeted by Pascagoula instead of Constantine.  She constantly asked her mother what happened to her, all she got was lies and deception by her.  It wasn't until her literary agent urged Skeeter to add something about the nanny that raised her until college, her mom finally confessed about Constantine's mysterious disappearance.  Her mother fired her because she wanted to keep appearances while entertaining the Daughters of the American Revolution at her home.  Few days later, Constantine moved to Chicago with her daughter and died.

This movie is more about Skeeter's coming of age and of her discontent with traditional gender roles of her social set than it is about the struggles and humanity of Blacks who serve elite White families of Jackson, Mississippi.",1388534400,,2385,5.153246753246753
4305741,5,B004A8ZWVU,"This is a wonderful movie, looking back closely at what life was like for the help.  But it is disturbing, because it is so true.  It is not as blatant now, but an undercurrent of this same feeling still exists.  It is good to watch this - admiring the courage of the help and the writer, and be appalled at what was accepted behavior.  There are moments of humor, of course.  Overall it is an excellent movie, well worth watching.",1388448000,,431,4.3375

4305746,4,B004A8ZWVU,Expected a sappy girly movie but this was a really nice story with some really hilarious moments.  It shows the social stigma that existed in the pre-civil rights era.  It really is awful how people are treated sometimes due to their skin color(either side of the spectrum).  Great movie for young adults and adults.,1388448000,,316,4.814814814814815

This is INSANE. From the 60-90s the programming was not segregated in this way, they've even segregated cable programming. Why the split? WHat is this teaching the new generation? That we haven't learned anything STILL and why can't Hollywood STOP making films about African Americans in this position? African Americans have come a long way from any one wanting to bring this up or even writing novels about this. What is it teaching anyone. People are people and people had best get a handle on that one! No I would not recommend. What I do recommend is simply normal films about normal situations in the authentic-ness as they are TODAY.

Drives me nuts when that happens. The story is just good.  Glad we watched it, even my husband enjoyed it.",1384387200,,270,4.235294117647059
4305816,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I have watched this movie about 5 times now since I first bought it, and wish now that I had gone to see it in the theatre.  I saw the movie before I read the book, but enjoyed both of them thoroughly and can't decide on which is better.  Basically, they are both good and the movie is very true to the book in all the right ways.

The Help is set in Jackson MS in the early 1960's, when most of the rich or up and coming white families had maids.  Skeeter (her nickname due to her height and thin build, one of many things that her mother despairs of in finding her a husband) just got back from college and gets a job writing a housekeeping column under another name.  Of course, she knows nothing about housekeeping, so goes to one of her friend's maids, Aibileen, for help.  She can't go to her own, because the maid she grew up with, who essentially raised her, has left and no one will tell her why.

In attempting to get a job in NYC, Skeeter is encouraged by a big city editor, and decides to approach the maids to tell their stories and put them together in a book.  This is very risky business considering the climate of the time, where the least that might happen to them if they are found out is that they will lose their jobs.  We get to meet several of them, including the unfolding of Aibileen's story, Minny's story (the best of the lot and this actress deserved all the praise she got!), and more...plus the stories of the ""white ladies"" they work for such as the poor but hopeful Elizabeth, the ""white trash"" Celia who married the best looking man around, and the infamous Miss Hilly, who runs just about every social organization she can in the town of Jackson.  Don't worry...she gets what's coming to her with the ""Terrible Awful,"" a plot point that you will never forget.

Beautifully told, with a great script and wonderful acting, I loved this movie...and ended up laughing and crying in equal measure.  The whole 1960's look of the homes and the clothing was also well done.  But the real winners of the movie were Aibileen and Minny, whose lives I was far more interested in than that of Miss Skeeter's.  I don't know how accurate some of the movie was to the time and the place, but it definitely highlights a moment in history when great changes were beginning, including the heartbreak and pain along the way.

Highly highly recommended!",1384387200,,2366,4.406896551724138

We are, after all, human beings who suffer, love, and experience every emotion imaginable.  We all feel pain in one way or another.  There was a saying I heard many years ago, which is very true.

However, so many family friends, it was explained to me as a child during this era were ""maids, housekeepers, live-ins"", some who were teachers but doing the summers worked to feed their families as domestics. One of the major things I enjoyed about the film, it showed the love, the tenacity and the strong-will of women who took care of white women and their children especially, many times not able to care for their own families and what they had to endure.

4305900,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I'm sure that my subject line has been thrown around in Hollywood before, but this is a film which truely deserves such praise.
  While Emma Stone has seemingly proven that she can do no wrong (for me at least), it was Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer who shined in this film as it exposed both positives and negatives about the lives of ""the help"" in Mississippi during the Civil Rights movement.  Granted, there were more negatives, but that was to be expected.  This film is just a few steps from being considered a documentary.  While the plot may be depressing at times, it brings it's appropriate share of laughs and Miss Octavia Spencer is largely to thank for that.
  I was also pleased to see Allison Janney in this picture as I've been a fan of hers since ""The West Wing"".  Like Ms. Stone, Miss Janney did not dissappoint as she plays a mother who's clearly dealing with the moral conflict of not being outright racist in Mississippi in the 1960s while dealing with her struggles against cancer.  Side note:  could I get the name of the acting coach who taught everyone their southern accents...that just made it all better.
  Anyway, Viola Davis as a maternal figure who finds her oppurtunity to change what she sees as a never-ending cycle of oppression is terrific.  Miss Davis's more intraverted manners balance nicely with the outgoing nature brought by Octavia Spencer.  While Emma Stone's character traits aren't really unique or memorable except for her wanting to be judged for her mind instead of her body (i.e. she didn't major in ""husband hunting"" during her university years), it was these non-original, stock-character traits that fit her perfectly into the story, allowing the three leading ladies to develop the right amount of chemistry for this film.
  The movie stays pretty loyal to it's source material and any changes or omissions made are all right with me...maybe I like Skeeter's mother better in the film...she seemed a bit more complex than she was in the book.  It is a must-have if you want any picture that's interesting with a solid story that you just want to see through to the end.  Enjoy.",1380067200,,2132,4.762942779291553

If you are looking for action, it isn't there, but the characterization was superb. The movie depicted much of the '50s-south very well. And I might say, at least to a subtler degree, the relationship and division that was shown in ""the Help"" between the whites and the blacks was also found in the north as well. Sad, but true. It makes one wonder how humans can show so much disregard to others they deem inferior, especially  when they see themselves as ""Christians"". Although we as a nation still have a ways to go to completely eradicate that mind set, fortunately we have come a long ways toward greater acceptance toward others of different color and beliefs as us. Hopefully this movie will further ""the Help"" to bring bout continued change. Great directing! Great acting by all the actors and actresses. Hats off to all and  thank you.",1379721600,,988,4.64

It's one of those stories which presents an aspect of reality that makes one feel indignant, angry and yearning for justice.  And then the movie delivers.  The movie presents a picture of the US South in the nineteen fifties when Jim Crow was alive and ""well.""  Thanks to one young woman who was educated and an aspiring journalist with her mind on things other than tomorrow's luncheon and next week's DAR meeting, the truth of the seething racism under the pretty, crinolined surface, came out.

4305936,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I thoroughly enjoyed the story of human beings living lives through their fear of being shunned by their peers, and of those few among us who have the courage to do the RIGHT thing in the face of enormous pressure to conform to the pressure of our friends, family and neighbors. As a story about people treating each other as just that--people, who also have hopes, wishes, dreams, fear, pain, and suffering--this has found a place among my list of classics.

We are NOT all born equal (I will NEVER be an NBA player, nor a prima ballerina--I simply don't have the height or the body type). We ARE, however, all born with the RIGHT to be TREATED EQUALLY--with respect, consideration, and as another human being--regardless of the color of our skin or any other such superficial factor. I recently read something that has struck a chord: We are not all born entitled to the same outcomes, but we ARE all born entitled to the same OPPORTUNITIES to prove our worth. The Help is a movie that develops its characters and uses them to illustrate this. And it does it VERY well, with lots of humor and heartbreak thrown in for good measure.",1378684800,,1133,4.58128078817734

4305949,5,B004A8ZWVU,"This movie was awe inspiring about a fresh out of college girl trying to make her way in the world by making  a difference.  Emma Stone plays a young reporter & aspiring author who has a kinmanship with the ""help"" (servants) in her hometown.  She persuades them to do a tell all at a time in history when blacks were looked down upon and still being treated inhumanely by white folk.  I think the movie clearly shows us how much we should revere the older black women.  Not only did they raise the white children but encouraged them and gave them words of wisdom.  They paved the way for all women to go out in the work world and try to balance their home life with making a living.  These women displayed courage in the face of all the hardships they were placed through in life and are to be admired.  This movie is their voice.",1377907200,,830,4.2756410256410255
4305950,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I read many of the reviews both good and bad and I just want to say that the movie was as good as the book.  Reviewers love to take something that they could not do in their entire lifetime if they had a full staff to assist them, and run something down.  Staying on topic, the DVD was very good.  It could not (of course) give the same amount of time to the characters that the book did.  Duh! No 90 minute movie can do this.  Overall, it was a very good movie, well worth the money and the time.
To the reviewers that want to take something good and noble and turn it into something evil and racial, I've got two words to say to you: prove it!
This movie and book did a great job showing exactly what it purports to show.  It portrays black ""help"" working their lives away in white households because that is how society developed from slave times to today.  One of the maids says that her mother was a maid and her grandmother was a house slave.  This is exactly the point of the movie and the book.  Society didn't give these women the opportunity to go to college (or even high school in many instances) and make their lives better.  It demonstrated how they felt about their plight.  That was the point of the book and the movie for those ignorant reviewers who didn't get it.  Many reviewers wanted to mouth off about how this white woman (the author) didn't help the civil rights movement! It certainly helps to show people today that many black people really had the cards stacked against them in the recent past.  I don't think she comments on racial events of our day nor should she.  It was a book about the recent PAST.
Too bad reviewers don't have to be honest or smart.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kindle-6-E-Ink-Display-Wi-Fi-Includes-Special-Offers-Black/dp/B007HCCNJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kindle, 6"" E Ink Display, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers (Black)</a>",1377907200,,1923,4.787878787878788

It is very different from the book, but in some ways they kept important details intact. It wasn't at all what I pictured in the book if I compared it, but it never is. For what they were able to fit in two and a half hours, I still hung onto every visual detail, and every single word. I am never so hyper focused on movies, so that goes to show how well they did. Whether you read the book or not, I would definitely recommend this. It stays true to the heart of the story, and keeps the meaning of it intact.",1377216000,,671,3.977777777777778
4305972,1,B004A8ZWVU,"I was so disappointed with this movie. The book was so wonderful, and when we saw the movie, my husband was disappointed because I kept pointing out all the stuff that was left out. There was so much missing. They tried to get things in there - like the white lady serving a coke to the black servant, but my husband didn't catch the great meaning - which comes through in the book, but of course never in the movie. So why even include that in the movie? Anyway, i would never recommend this to movie to someone who can read.",1377129600,3,526,4.217821782178218

4305975,5,B004A8ZWVU,"It seems like the quality of movie in recent years has substantially declined.  Too often I see movies that are ""okay"", but not something I could honestly recommend to anyone else to see.  Finally, this movie delivers!  It is such a great movie and has such an important message from America's history.  I think I must have cried no less than 5 times throughout this movie.

4305983,1,B004A8ZWVU,"I'm old enough to remember the civil rights movement, so maybe that's part of why this didn't work for me. I first tried reading the highly touted book but I was so put off by the dialect that I couldn't even make it through the first page, so I don't know why I thought the movie would be better. It's not. There is no subtlety in this movie; characters are either completely good (e.g., Skeeter and Aibilene and impish Minny) or completely cruel and beyond redemption, e.g., Hilly. All of which I could have tolerated, and written off the movie as yet another over-rated chick-flick, were it not for the PIE. The whole thing was so predictable but so unlikely, and so puerile. And the joke just goes on and on and on...ad nauseum, in this over rated, overly long movie. But if you like the idea of a movie where the premise is that a socially sensitive, privileged white chick helps a bunch of poor black maids to stand up for themselves, and in the process, realize how lucky they are to know her, well, then you're gonna love this flick. As for me, my thought when the credits finally rolled was shoot that's 146 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. *sigh*",1376784000,6,1168,4.412037037037037

This movie could not have been made in Mississippi in the 1960s.  It is ludicrous to believe that the races had different diseases and that their interaction needed management by the state.  It was the height of insanity for whites to believe that the maids needed by use separate bathrooms, but were allowed to completely raise their children.",1376524800,,460,4.784810126582278

After reading the book I was very skeptical that they'd be able to bring the rich, detailed story to life.  I never thought they'd find an actress good enough to embody Aibileen and Skeeter, but they did it.  I was very impressed with the film and all of the actors, and they were very respectful with the story, not veering too far off track.  Jessica Chastain is a standout!",1375747200,,525,4.427083333333333

There was no character development with Minnie, Leroy, Stuart, Miss Celia... Very disappointing. Skeeter's mother was made out to be a good person with a good heart deep down in the movie, but the book shows what a terrible person she really is - which made Skeeter's decisions and life even more difficult.

part of my childhood, and having had a mother born and bred in Alabama. The book was hard to put down, and each character
was portrayed with a clarity that could only come from the author's real life experiences. What I took from the book was its very
clear message that all people are human beings with the same inner reservoire of feelings and that we all need to realize that
underneath surface differences, the most important race of all is the human race. The movie made from the book was as
engaging as the original. An unforgettable story!",1375401600,,679,4.573770491803279

4306057,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I have been wanting to see The Help for months now but missed it at the movies.  Having absolutely loved the book, I felt sure that the movie adaptation would be just as good.  Read my review of the novel by Kathryn Stockett here.

I watched The Help during my 11-month old's naptime, which meant that I watched it with subtitles to keep the volume down.  I think I got more out of the movie that way.  Some of the dialogue was difficult to understand, and watching with subtitles meant that I didn't miss a word.

Of course, there were some changes from the book to the movie version, but they did not bother me too much.  I did feel like some of the important scenes were omitted from the movie, especially the part about Minnie and the miscarried baby.

The casting was excellent and everyone did such a good job.  I especially loved Viola Davis as Abilene and Octavia Spencer as Minnie.  And Emma Stone is such a good little actress!  I have really enjoyed all of her movies to date.  Allison Janney was a perfect Mrs. Phelan and I thought her scenes were some of the movie's best.

The movie adaptation was not as good as the book (which was just outstanding) but it was still a really good movie.  I enjoyed it a lot, and think just about anyone would like it.

the time period i will admit was harsh and many harbored ill will and hatred for other races at that time and still do today.
It is a shame that so many think it a good movie. while there were fine actors in it, the story line is one that to me, should not be applauded for any reason.  it was so serious and race problems still are. i am not so sure this would be a good way to handle it.

I did the same thing recently with Neil Gaiman's ""Stardust"" and was disappointed with the movie version. I experienced the same with ""The Help"" but on a much lesser scale.

Overall I enjoyed the movie. It flowed well, didn't seem too long (even though it was nearly 2.5 hours), and the acting was great. The problem was, it went too fast. It stayed pretty true to the book but there is a lot of character development in the book and I felt the movie missed some of that.

I can't believe our country was at such a low point with regard to equal rights during that era. The only downside to this movie is that sometimes the characters' true to life accents can be difficult to understand, especially if you are hard of hearing (my husband could not understand half the dialog).

I don't mind these required non-movie pieces and directions, but the ""wait"" for The Help was interminable!  Then, in the middle of the movie, the DVD simply stopped.  It was a corrupt disc, I guess.  My player worked fine on any other DVD I put in it.

Great performances from an all star cast and to me, I really enjoyed the memories it brought back.  Although this type of racism was exclusive of the deep south state of Mississippi  where violent bigotry was the mainstream and many movies have been made about the horrors of racism in Mississippi, I have wonderful memories of our family having ""help"" during the 60's only it was much more of a family type relationship where they were part of our family and sat with us during meals and were part of my fondest childhood memories.  It was a time when everyone had to pull together to make ends meet when white families were so large and depended on farms and the Blacks would become extended parts of the family for their own survival as well and were never treated as less than we were.  It was just everyone helping each other as I innocently remember it and this movie brings back wonderful memories of those times.

It really depicts what life was like for blacks in the past and sadly some of that is still true today.

4306124,5,B004A8ZWVU,"The Help by Kathryn Stockett was a huge phenomenon in the literary world. It was one of those rare stories that captured the attention of readers across the board, and garnered critical and commercial success. It was no surprise, then, when the novel was optioned for a film adaptation.

As the film begins, we meet Aiblileen (Viola Davis), a black maid maid working for a young, white family in Jackson, Mississippi, 1962. She carries a sense of wisdom, as she raises the young daughter of the family, her seventeenth white baby. Despite the loss of her son, he couldn't get the proper care in the ""colored"" hospital, Aibileen finds a kind of solace through her job, her faith, and her best friend Minny (Octavia Spencer). Minny is also a maid. While she is praised for her cooking skills, her sassy mouth has gotten her in trouble with previous employers, and finds her with no job and a husband who beats her regularly.

Eugenia Phealan, Skeeter (Emma Stone), is a fresh out of college, 22 year old white woman, who has returned home, to her mother's dismay, without a husband. We learn that Skeeter has always had trouble fitting in with what society, and her mother, expect of her. Upon her return home, she is shocked to learn that the maid who raised her, Constantine, has left the family home, and no one seems to want to tell Skeeter what happened to her. Saddened by the loss of her childhood companion and eager to get a job at a big publishing company, Skeeter decides to write something important. After a chance encounter with Aibileen, Skeeter enlists her and her friends to tell their stories of being, ""The Help"" to white families.

The movie is extremely faithful to the novel, becoming one of those rare films that truly seems to bring the story to life. The cast, from top to bottom, is splendid, each actor bringing sincerity and conviction to their role. The movie is extremely deserving of all of the hype and recognition that it received. Fans of the novel are sure to enjoy this adaptation.",1370908800,,2015,4.670422535211268

But I was trying to imagine living in such fear, fear of the violence that happened to these black people simply for their skin colour. I was imagining going to bed at night, not to sleep peacefully, but in fear that you would be attacked. What a horrible way to live. This is such an important movie.

Only my Mom and I were in the area at the time. I'm white. My experience was not traumatic, just confusing and bizarre. I've never forgotten it. This movie gives me a glimpse into the mindset of those who were in charge at the time that thought separate facilities were warranted. I don't get it when people talk about the ""good ole days"" and how bad things are now as if there was truly ever a golden age in the history of sinful mankind. No. Every generation needs to hit the backspace button sometimes and that's what I see in this movie - people who have the courage and will to tap society on the shoulder and get the cultural hand moving toward the backspace button.",1370304000,,813,4.3202614379084965

Old because if you were white during the time period of this movie you can see what it was like for black maids to have to work for white families while dealing with their own problems at the same time.

I saw this movie at the theater like 4 times, and there are so many scenes in the movie that had people laughing out loud, gasping, upset, and cheering! Viola Davis is amazing, she plays her role so realisticly (how she didn't win the Oscar is beyond me!!!), she makes you feel her maid's character's pain, joy, and every emotion. She doesn't have to utter a word and you know exactly what she's feeling or thinking just from a look on her face. And Octavia Spencer is amazing as Minnie, she is hilarious and has some of the best lines in the movie and delivers them brilliantly!

The movie was very good, and I enjoyed it very much. But, the book has so many more details than the movie did, which helped to make the book so much better and those details added a lot to the story and the characters in the book. There were some differences in the story itself between the book & movie---Like how Minnie found out that Celia was pregnant, for example.
The book was written so well--That it left cliffhangers  at the end of each chapter. I didn't see any cliffhangers in the movie, and not just because I already read the book, but because there weren't any.
The only reason I'm giving four instead of five stars is because of the difference between the book & the movie, and finding the book to be better. If I hadn't read the book, I'm certain I would have liked the movie more than I did. But, it was still a very good movie that I liked very much, and I definitely recommend it.",1366761600,,1043,4.215

4306192,4,B004A8ZWVU,"For an award-winning film, I was a little skeptical about seeing this film. For one, I'm getting tired of movies based on books, are we becoming that illiterate and unoriginal? For another, I'd already seen a lot of movies dealing with the Segregation era of the 50's and 60's. It was only after hearing a good friend recommend it and seeing it on sale at Wal-Mart that I figured I'd try, awards or not. Turned out to be up my alley.
The heroine in this is my kind of protagonist, one willing to go out on a controversially risky limb to help others out, even at numerous costs. And costs really were numerous. Skeeter, a young woman who's in her early 20's and still single (causing her mother to worry if she's a lesbian) has a new job at a local newspaper, writing a column on housekeeping. While doing that, she's working on another project, a book from the point-of-view of black maids and what all they go through. Well, since it's set in one of the darkest times in modern American history, things do not always go well. A lot of times, white women won't refer to their maids as human beings or women, but as ""negro""es, though a couple times in the film, they're called the more explicit version. Once with indifference to how they would feel, and the other time with anger.
Skeeter, knowing the risks of what she's writing, takes all the risks necessary to show the blight, and her editor says some things need to get provoked anyway (I definitely agree). But while Skeeter is focused on showing the blight, a friend is more focused on a  rather ridiculous thought- making separate bathrooms for their black maids, claiming they have certain diseases that are not localized in America (I wonder if that's a nod to the miniseries ""Roots""?), which was frequently frustrating. Well, her obsession with separate bathrooms backfires on her in more than one comical way (in one instance, a ""Yard of the Month"" becomes my comical scene of the night). And she doesn't only have one problem, a maid she fired shows an apology, but just like the overt racism has teeth, so does the maid's attitude, and man does it become a truly comical storytelling device through the rest of the film. I'm not sure if I'll want chocolate pie after this movie!
There are many moments where the humor is not only knee-slapping, but also cheer-on worthy. Then again, there are moments that are deeply moving, nearly getting me to cry (I probably didn't have enough to drink for tears), so it became an appropriately-timed emotional roller coaster. Some people were completely likable, even if not 100% believable. Others were downright nasty (including one who warns that there are racists in ""this town,"" yet fails to recognize her own hypocrisy in the statement, but does evil really ever see itself when it talks about itself?), and had me glad I wasn't a kid during then.
If anything, the only real problem I had with this movie was, occasionally, it would switch back and forth from when Skeeter was a little girl to a young woman with no indication it switched times, so I had to learn at those random times what Skeeter looked like as a little girl.
Her past, each of the maidens' pasts, the racial blight of then, and the numerous story layers and twists and turns helped create a movie that not only got my attention in the long run, but also helped me see why this film got the awards it did.
Why isn't there more thought-provoking movies like this out there? Maybe we're too afraid to see where we came from so we don't repeat history?
Regardless, I truly did love this movie!",1365984000,2,3568,4.601255886970173

4306239,4,B004A8ZWVU,"I didn't have high expectations for this book when I picked it up because it's not at all like what i normally read.  I decided to read it because my wife was, and I was pleasantly surprised!  Since the story centers on civil rights, I was expecting this to come across like left-wing propaganda.  I was wrong, it was quite balanced and sensible.  I am a white male, but I was drawn into the story and I connected with the black female characters because Ms. Stockett presented them with depth, depicting something universal about them to which everyone can relate.  Our cultures may be different, but not by as much as some people pretend.  I also found The Help to be quite educational because the story vividly provides a link between the past and the world of today.  There is a lot of history intersperced into the story.  It's only been 50 years, and it almost seems surreal how much we've matured in America in such a short time.

The movie version of the book does a pretty good job of translating the intentions of the author, although it doesn't necessarily mimic the story verbatim.  I was happy they left out the part about the naked and toothless white guy.  On the other hand, some of the characters, especially Celia Foote, weren't quite what I expected.  Still, a very worthy adaptation.  Worth a look!",1362960000,,1318,4.581196581196581
4306240,5,B004A8ZWVU,I enjoyed it when it was in the movie; had to have it in my collection of very good family films,1362873600,,96,3.619047619047619
4306241,4,B004A8ZWVU,"Pros: The entire cast does a fantastic job of filling the roles that they were chosen to fill. Specifically, Viola Davis makes the most of her limited opportunity and turns her character into an appropriate central figure, while Octavia Spencer makes a fine effort of stealing every scene she's in. I would think it would take some courage on the part of Bryce Dallas Howard to play the role she was cast in, as most people, upon viewing, might be tempted to see her as the ""Godless woman"" that she portrays. I always have a little extra respect for those actors all while I'm struggling not to yell at their characters through the screen. The highlight performance to me, however, is Jessica Chastain, who depicts an individual incredibly lovable in her naivete. She just doesn't realize that black people are supposed to be viewed as second class citizens by their white - and superior (<-- sarcasm) - counterparts, which makes her the most easily likable character in the movie (to me).

Cons: I tend to struggle with works like this. On the one hand, it appears to be doing some good by shedding light on the sh***y circumstances for black people in the deep south during the time of segregation. On the other hand, however, there is room for the argument that it doesn't go far enough, and that it is arguably still detrimental to equality by continuing some stereotypes. I generally end up siding with the idea that any progress is a positive sign, and the only ultimate ""cure"" for inequality is time, while movies like this (and hopefully real world people like some of the characters in it) can help usher along the process.

But I do still have a hard time with dialog as cliche and hard to swallow as, ""You is good, you is kind, you is special."" I can't say for certain whether this kind of dialog is appropriate to the time, place, and people. I'm aware that African American Vernacular English does exist, but I'm hardly an expert on it, and as such I cannot figure out where my comfort line should be drawn with its use. Parts of the dialog in this movie seemed to make, for instance, the strong central figure of Aibileen still appear weak. Some aspects of the script were actually pretty good and entertaining, with sharp and funny dialog and a plot worth following after the first half hour or so. But then Davis gets saddled with lines like that... It really is pretty impressive that she was able to shine through some of what the author/scriptwriter decided she ought to say.

Something that bothered me on a bit more of a superficial level was the fact that Emma Stone's character was supposed to be unattractive. I understand Hollywood likes to cast attractive young actresses as ""the ugly girl,"" but they at least generally try to make her look ugly. This movie didn't even try to do that. Stone just kept walking around, looking her normal cute self, while everyone referred to how visually unappealing she was. Let's have a little more effort there, filmmakers...

Overall: A number of scenes were indeed entertaining to watch, but all too much of it just made me uncomfortable. I don't blame the movie, of course, for portraying people and situations that are all too real and have every reason to make me uncomfortable (oh yea, and pretty angry). I encourage you to sit down and watch it, and if you are able to sit through the whole thing without being bothered by the actions of any of the white people in it, tell me so that I can know I have no interest in talking to you ever again. All told, it's a decent movie with good acting, an engaging plot, and a shaky script, and that ultimately doesn't really have anything other than a decent message to make it special. While wanting to give it a higher rating because I believe in the idea behind the story, I ended up giving it a 7 out of 10 just because the movie itself didn't knock my socks off.",1362873600,,3877,4.566091954022989

4306250,5,B004A8ZWVU,"This movie is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi and tells the story of an aspiring young Southern journalist who wants to tell what it is like to work as a housemaid/domestic helper from the black woman's perspective. Skeeter, whose friends are busy spending their days in a privileged world of playing bridge, serving in the Junior League, and entertaining, wants nothing more than to gain experience as a writer so she can go to New York and work for a large publishing company. Skeeter's friends are married and living in their perfect world of owning the right house, in the right neighborhood, having babies, and depending on their black maids to do the work of raising their children, cleaning their homes, doing their shopping and cooking their meals. Skeeter doesn't date or have a boyfriend; her goal is to become a writer, which is an embarrassment to her mother, and scandalous to her friends. Despite the times, Skeeter has a deep sense of how wrong the blacks are treated and she is both liked and respected by those who work for her own family as well as those who work for her friends. This is not the case with the snobby Miss Hilly and Miss Elizabeth, who both view their maids as less than human because they are black. Miss Hilly draws up an initiative to require all households who employ black help to build a special toilet for them because ""they carry different diseases from us"". This was a time when blacks were prohibited from using the same public toilets as whites, and were also forbidden from drinking from the same water fountain, as well as many other discriminatory practices that made Mississippi such a shameful bastion of racial segregation and discrimination.

Aibileen and Minnie are the two maids that work for Miss Elizabeth and Miss Hilly, and are best friends who share their personal sorrows with each other. After Miss Hilly catches Minnie in her bathroom during a violent thunderstorm that prevents her from going outside to use the toilet, she fires Minnie and spreads lies that will insure Minnie is unable to find employment anywhere else in town. Aibileen tells Minnie that Celia Foote, an outcast from Hilly's social circle, and the woman who is married to Hilly's past boyfriend, is looking for help. Minnie, desperate for a job to support her children, swallows her pride and goes to work for Celia. It turns out Celia lives in a huge old mansion that her husband's family have owned for generations. She is a simple and sweet girl raised on the wrong side of the tracks who wants nothing more than to find a place in the world her husband was born into. She accepts Minnie as an equal, something that immediately raises Minnie's suspicions because of the prevailing racial prejudices in the Deep South against blacks. Both of them being outcasts from the circle of the Miss Hilly's world, and with reputations that are tarnished by Miss Hilly, they forge a bond slowly that will benefit them both in unique ways.

Aibileen is approached by Skeeter to tell what it is like to work as a maid and, although at first resistant to the idea, she reluctantly begins to open up about the things she has experienced over many years working in the homes of white women and raising their children. It is a dangerous thing for both Skeeter and Aibileen in the climate of racial prejudice that exists, and they must keep their project secret. Skeeter has promised that she will never use Aibileen's real name, nor her own as the writer, and encourages Aibileen to see if Minnie might be willing to also tell of her perspective as to what it has been like to work as a maid for white families. Minnie is bitter over what she has suffered at the hands of the cruel Hilly, and grudgingly agrees to share as long as her name isn't used. Before long their trust in Skeeter and the years of resentment they have felt over their treatment leads Aibileen and Minnie to give up the secrets of the white women of Jackson as Skeeter sympathetically listens and pens their stories for a book titled ""The Help"".

Minnie's desire to get revenge on Hilly leads her to carry out an act she calls ""the terrible awful"", something that is so outrageous that she is ashamed to ever tell anyone what she has done. It also is hilarious, and Hilly's slightly senile and forgetful mother witnesses it and laughs uproariously at Minnie's revenge, but this leads Hilly to put her mother in a nursing home because she is afraid she will tell everyone in town what happened and make her the laughing stock of Jackson. Eventually when racial tensions and injustices, including the murder of Medgar Evers, lead to the brutal treatment of one of the maids in Jackson, it serves as the catalyst that encourages the other maids of Jackson to open up to Skeeter about the way they have been treated over the years while working for white families, and they agree to spill their secrets, some of which are terribly sad, some of which are bittersweet, some of which are hilarious, and some of which are damning for the white families. Minnie tells Aibileen about ""the terrible awful"" she did to Miss Hilly and each maid knows that they have ""insurance"" to protect them since Miss Hilly would never let anyone believe the stories are set in Jackson once they are published, because Minnie's story of ""the terrible awful"", which is included in the many stories that will come to be told in ""The Help"", would make Hilly the joke of Jackson if anyone ever knew what Minnie did to her. As their stories are written, Skeeter prepares to include her own story of Constantine, the black maid who raised her from infancy, and how Skeeter's mother betrayed the loyalty and love Constantine had for the Phelan family, especially for Skeeter.

Once finished and sent off to the publishing house in New York, the manuscript is hastily published to coincide with Dr. Martin Luther King's march on Washington, something that will bring the civil rights movement to the forefront of America as the struggle for racial equality tears at the fabric of the Old South, revealing the humiliating treatment of blacks which has been kept largely untold in other parts of the country.

Skeeter's book comes at a time ripe for the telling. Once it hits stores in Jackson, everyone is buying it and wondering where the stories were originated because they seem to divulge things that fit with events among Jackson's white families although no mention is made of the author (simply ""anonymous"") or the town where the stories took place. As more and more interest in the book develops, Hilly buys it and when she reads about ""the terrible awful"" she knows Skeeter has written the book, but she tells everyone the book can't possibly be about Jackson. She confronts Skeeter about the book but Skeeter stands her ground and tells Hilly she can't prove anything, and Hilly can't - unless she wants to make herself and every other white family in her social circle look bad and expose the secrets which they had assumed would always be safe in the climate of white superiority, where the lives of their black maids could be ruined for the slightest reason. Now everything has changed and the tables have turned!

Finally, Celia Foote decides to make an appearance at the annual Christmas Junior League gala so she can tell Miss Hilly that she never stole away her old boyfriend, because she believes this is why Miss Hilly hates her and has deliberately excluded her from being in the Junior League and the circle of wealthy white women that form Hilly and Elizabeth's coterie of friends. Little does she realize that she is about to make herself look like a fool among the snobby women of Jackson, even though she is married to the influential son of an old monied family. She is also about to discover that she will never be accepted, even if she tries to tell Hilly of her innocence in Hilly's breakup with Johnny. Although it makes for a sad and yet funny scene, the wheels are set in motion for everything to change as the The Help's stories circulate among Jackson's citizens and expose the terrible secrets and the injustices toward blacks that have been buried in secrecy for so long

Throughout the movie are moments of extreme hilarity and moments of great sadness as the story unfolds, but the ending is one that provides redemption for Skeeter, Aibileen, Minnie, and even Celia Foote. The strength and empowerment that comes to those who have never known anything but powerlessness is the redemption, and the beginning of hope for a better life in the changing times of the civil rights movement.

Having grown up as a white child in the South during the time this story takes place, I remember so vividly how racial segregation was - the signs that separated the use of public facilities for blacks and whites, as well as a time when blacks were not allowed to ride anywhere except the back of buses. It is a time that is burned into my mind and makes me deeply ashamed of the degrading treatment blacks suffered at the hands of whites. Even as a child, I remember the downcast eyes and the role of subservience that defined how blacks were expected to behave in the presence of whites. There is no exaggeration in this book as to the black experience in the Deep South. The ending of the movie was so uplifting as I'm The Living Proof is sung by Mary J. Blige! It is simply a marvelous movie. I highly recommend it!",1362441600,,9401,4.67956469165659

4306280,4,B004A8ZWVU,"Yesterday, I had a 3 hour break in-between classes, and a free movie on my AMC Stubbs card, so I went to the movies. Unbelievably the only thing playing at my time was one of the movies I didn't want to see, The Help. Isn't it funny how the movie you never want to see always turns out to be great? The Help is based on a book by the same title, and follows a young writer, in the mid 1960s, looking for an idea. At a party, she notices how horrible people are to the African American help and decides to write their story. Of course it's a scandalous idea that can get them all killed, but Skeeter finds one woman brave enough to tell her story. This movie is funny, heartwarming, and inspirational, not to mention the acting is top notch. Viola Davis deserves an Oscar nomination for her performance, which is one of the strongest I've seen all year. The Help is an amazing story, with a terrific cast, and a big upside. It has a unique and inspiring story that takes us back to a very tumultuous time in American History, and I can't recommend it enough!",1361577600,,1057,4.263681592039801
4306281,3,B004A8ZWVU,"This movie explores an aspect of the civil rights movement that I never registered: the plight of poor black housekeepers.  Not a thrilling premise, but stay with me.  It was an entertaining picture.

The real value in The Help is not in its ""message"" or uplifting resolution.  It is the humor.  There are some good one-liners and carefully set-up punchlines that deliver mild, but reliable laughs.  The African American maids in the film have great personality and timing, and in some ways their body language and delivery make you feel for their struggle to find the humor in their awful lives.  And the spoiled-rotten stay-at-home white broads that take full advantage of their servants are such wild exaggerations of Southern belle busybodies that you have to laugh at the parody.  The humor it cutesy and simple, but I'll take well-placed and playful jokes over gross-out bodily fluid gags seven days of the week.

A clever social hierarchy study goes on.  The movie reveals the behind the scenes perspective that ""the help"" in any institution, be it a church, law firm, place of higher learning, bank, or whatever, gets to experience firsthand.  The maids swap rumors and stories about the real and imperfect lives of their employers and gossip over all the dirty secrets.  Blending into the wallpaper as a  go-fer has simpleton entertainment perks.  This is one lesson of The Help, but as the servant you always have to keep your lips sealed and avoid the temptation to talk back.  Or to grab revenge, at least not until the time is right.  There is some sweet revenge in this movie, but I won't give it away.  All I can say is that anyone who has worked in the service industry will appreciate pulling a big one over on a rude and ungrateful customer, or, in this case, a snotty and unbearable employer.

Another thought that occurred to me is how African American women went from being indentured servants in the mid-19th Century to being ""free"" but still less-thans in the mid-20th Century.  These women were not independent. They were highly dependent upon their ""masters,"" the wealthy, cozy, elitist Southern whites.  (The practice of leaving a servant to a descendant in one's will that is discussed in the movie is further evidence for how little the possessive and entitled mindset of the white ruling class had changed.)  I am sure the maids were paid a virtual pittance, although we never find out exactly.  It is clear that whatever they were paid kept them stationed in life as poor black folks, and that is the point.  They can't move up.

Overall, this was an enjoyable period dramedy.  The centerpieces of this movie were the big, bold personalities of the maids, the dopey housewives, the historical backdrop of the civil rights movement, and the ""up with people"" closing.  Keep an open mind going in, and you will find some value in The Help.",1361491200,,2866,4.797959183673469

4306302,5,B004A8ZWVU,"This is without a doubt the best film released in 2011...my opinion of course.  The message of this film and its historic significance tip the scales in its favor. It is the first film I've been to in a very long time where the theater audience stood and applauded at the end. Some may say this is just a ""guilty white folks film"", but having grown up in the South and having come of age (I graduated from high school in 1963) during the era in which this film is set, I can relate to much of the story. It is authentic in its telling of the relationship between white families, especially wealthy white families, and their ""Help"". I say that from a white perspective; but I suspect the same is true for blacks who matured during that era. This story though is not heavy handed; it is balanced with just the right amount of pathos and humor; you will be laughing out loud one minute and reaching for a tissue the next. Hard to believe this is the first directorial effort for Tate Taylor, as he has crafted a masterful work here. The casting too is perfect. Viola Davis, who we don't see much on the big screen, shows why she is such a highly regarded stage actress with her portrayal of the maid, Aibileen Clark. Octavia Spencer delivers a superlative performance too, as Minny Jackson. Emma Stone, in what I believe is her best performance, plays the lead, Skeeter Phelan, an aspiring young writer, who coaxes the stories from the ""help"" for her book, appropriately titled ""The Help"". Also look for Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter) Allison Janney, Cicely Tyson and Sissy Spacek in fine performances.

Well, guess what - the movie is superb - great actors and great storyline.  Makes you feel good in the end.  Even brought a tear or two to the eye (yup, I'm a retired Marine and I had a tear or two....and it wasn't due to gas or anything like that).

4306345,5,B004A8ZWVU,The Help was an awesome movie. Very much worth the money. It was well thought out and funny while yet teaching lessons to the viewers.,1358985600,,134,4.4
4306346,4,B004A8ZWVU,"After initially being rejected by over 60 publishers, Kathryn Stockett's The Help was finally published in February of 2009.  Since that time, this incendiary tale of the small and not-so-small abuses suffered by black housekeepers in the 1960s has gone on to sell over 5 million copies, as it spent over 100 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List.

Set in Jackson Mississippi during the early 1960s, the film tells the story of Skeeter Phelan, a young southern society girl who longs to become a writer.  When Skeeter's beloved housekeeper is suddenly dismissed under pressure from her mother's society friends, Skeeter is concerned and begins to document the stories of her friend's domestic workers.  As one black woman after the next courageously steps forward to tell her tale, the book begins to take shape, and a town will be forever changed.

My reaction to this film is somewhat hard to pin down.  On the one hand, I am always drawn to stories where someone has the courage to swim against the stream, and in so doing, brings justice to those that have been oppressed.  These are important stories to tell, for they remind us that change does not often begin in the corridors of power.  Change begins when insignificant people dare to speak prophetic truth into a world that is desperate for truth to be spoken.

On the other hand, movies like this sometimes feel ""safe"" because they are told from a distance.  Fifty years after the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, how many people would genuinely argue that black people did not suffer under white society?  So it's easy to root for the heroes, demonize the villains, and feel as if  ""the job is done.""  And there is a danger in that feeling as if the ""job is done"" because we are encouraged to believe that we can sit safely in the comforts of our own homes.

How much more exciting would it be to see a story set in the contemporary world in which someone dared to tell the story of the plight of modern day Native Americans or modern day slaves?  How much more compelling would it be to have to face our own complicit guilt in avoiding the issues and burying our collective heads in the sand?

In the end, I strongly recommend viewing The Help, and dare you not cheer as Hilly eats the pie.

4306351,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I heard this story was incredible.  I tried to read the book but had trouble with the dialect, so when I had the chance to see the movie I jumped on it.  It is the story of some very brave ladies, black and white and life as it once was in the confederate south.  The story is told with characters who appear very real and true to their time.  With dignity, humor and emotion it chronicles the lives of black maids ""The Help"" who have raised the female children of Mississippi's white families.  These children are now grown with families of their own and continue to ""employ"", although it seems more like owning these maids.  One young woman who is not married and continues to live at home wants to become a journalist and decides to interview The Help writing a book about what it is like for them to raise the children of white families while others raise their children.  Very poignant and full of issues to bring out strong feelings, this movie is one of the best I have ever seen.  There are plenty of characters to hate and many to love.  It is a very deep story with one of the best revenge plots ever!  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a well written movie with a cast of wonderful actors.",1358812800,,1209,4.3097345132743365
4306352,5,B004A8ZWVU,"This movie is thought provoking, sad, funny, scary, all at the same time. The scary part is how the white society in the south viewed & treated black people, and everyone just seemed to accept it as OK. Only people who lived through that period could understand what it was like, a short movie obviously cannot depict what the situation really must have been in everyday life. I have always wondered how Hitler could have gotten away with the atrocities he committed, and here we had something so similar going on right in the USA 30 years later. That is the only thing I can think of to compare it to, if you were black and living in the south, your very life was in danger if you stepped out of the lines, how sad people were treated that way.",1358812800,,745,4.328571428571428

4306389,5,B004A8ZWVU,"If you have not watched this movie yet, you are missing out on some amazing acting.  It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  This is about black women who endured in the 50's working as maids and caregivers of children in other people's homes.  It is about a group of women who decided that the injustice of how they were treated needed to end and what they did about it.  Most of America may not have even understood or known about the problem nor was anyone willing to tell the rest of the country about it.  It's about women who decided to publish their stories in a book to try to end injustices.  This is so much more than just a movie because it is the not too distant past that is reflected here and it wasn't especially pretty but most of the world turned a blind eye to what happened except for one woman who inspired others to write about their treatment.  It has moments where you will laugh and cry, then cheer these people for their courage.  It is truly about some very brave women and it will inspire you.",1357689600,,1028,4.209183673469388

4306406,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I own this movie. I saw it in the theater and bought the DVD as soon as it was available on Amazon. The movie by itself is very good, but the book is MUCH better! (Isn't that usually the case though)? The movie cut out entire chapters of the book and many of the characters were not as developed as they should have been. However, if you put the book aside, the movie is definitely worth watching.",1357257600,,397,4.1688311688311686

this movie to all women and most men.",1357257600,,292,4.051724137931035

4306414,5,B004A8ZWVU,This movie is excellent. I read the book first and the movie follows it almost perfectly.  The acting is excellent and the story is very important to civil rights.

4306435,5,B004A8ZWVU,"It was INTERESTING to read the reviews for this movie. Some gave poor reviews saying it it was not anywhere as good as the book. I did not read the book, but that makes no sense to me. I know a good movie when I see one. The movie should be reviewed on it's own merit. Some argued the racial issues were overblown or nonexistent. I know that argument is invalid. So what is it about this movie that provokes so much defensiveness and need to dissect and inject personal perspective?
This is a movie. It is a work of fiction (despite the fact that there are issues that were/are real). I found this movie to be compelling and the acting, by all actors for the most part, to be very good to EXCELLENT. I SAY BRAVO. JOB WELL DONE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie for it's presentation, content, and, especially, it's superb performances.",1356480000,,832,4.409090909090909

4306437,5,B004A8ZWVU,"As a young girl growing up in Vermont, we treated everyone with respect.  I never moved to the south till in my 20's and by then most of what is written here was gone.  But some still feel this way sorry to say.

It was a real eye opener for me reading the story, how could people treat their hired help with such disrespect.  Especially when they were so busy being the social butterfly and leaving the beautiful children to be raised by another.

If you haven't grown up in the South, this book is a real eye opener.",1356393600,,518,4.191919191919192

4306443,5,B004A8ZWVU,"This is a great novel adaptation with almost all of the tweaks enhancing the story, rather than detracting from it.  The only change I didn't like is with Stuart's character and the ending of his storyline.

The actors did terrific jobs and gave fantastic performances, especially Emma Stone, Viola Davis, and Octavia Spencer.  Bryce Dallas Howard was almost unrecognizable and did a phenomenal job bringing Hilly Holbrook to life.

At times is hard to remember this is solely a work of fiction - it seems like it could be based on actual events.",1356220800,,546,4.838709677419355

4306447,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I heard so many of my friends say ""You've got to read this book!""  I am so glad I finally had the chance.  It was both heartbreaking and yet it revealed the caring of one person for another in need.  Just as I was sinking in sadness the author would place a humorous moment in the story to help me continue on.  This is a must read.",1356048000,,332,3.91044776119403

However, This is not necessarily a ""feel good"" movie. In fact, I found it somewhat depressing at times. Well, I suppose that real life is not always ""a bowl full of cherries.""
Seeing this movie, one realizes how far we have come in recognizing our shared humanity.

Unless you have been a part of the ""culture"" of the 50's and 60's in the south you might be left asking yourself what these people were all about.  Well, my dears, in many cases the movie was right on about the attitudes and customs of the day.  Hillariously funny to someone who lived it.",1355702400,,404,4.220779220779221

4306489,3,B004A8ZWVU,"I enjoyed ""The Help"" but for all the wrong reasons. I loved the high production values, the beautiful lighting, the shots of ripe agricultural fields in the Deep South. I especially loved the exquisite, tailor-fit, vintage, early 1960s dresses worn by the white actresses. I got a huge kick out of the over-the-top performances. Bryce Dallas Howard, though a living person, is every bit the Walt Disney cartoon villainess. You love hating her. You grimace when she cackles and you cackle as she reaches her inevitable, and utterly unbelievable, nightmare, revenge-dream-fantasy downfall. Howard should have won an academy award. Viola Davis, who radiates soul and depth and can make you cry just by walking into a room, is the deep, rich heart of this otherwise silly film. Octavia Spencer is adorable. She's as big-eyed and woebegone as a DW Griffith Gish sister. I have no idea why Emma Stone is the star. She can't act much and she isn't a drop dead beauty. Maybe she knows someone.

""The Help"" is about black-white relations in Mississippi in the early 1960s. Jim Crow Mississippi was a terrorist state. That sounds like an extremist statement; it is not. The Mississippi Sovereignty Commission planted spies in every nook and cranny of Mississippi life. It aided at least one assassin, Byron de la Beckwith, who murdered Medgar Evers. This deadly serious, tense, historic era is reduced, in ""The Help,"" to a very pretty soap opera featuring magical Negroes - a term used to describe black characters in mostly white films who exist only to provide a means for the main, white character to grow.

You notice immediately in ""The Help"" that the white women are all slim, elegantly and flatteringly dressed, and pretty. The black women are plump, older, and plain. But, this is an uplifting film about Civil Rights, so all the black women are noble, giving, selfless, and saintly, while all, except one, of the whites are vicious, vacuous, selfish, and bad mothers. Also, all the whites are filthy rich. Was it really that way, you have to ask? No, it wasn't. Mississippi has one of the highest white poverty rates in the US. And some whites joined the Civil Rights struggle, performing the ultimate sacrifice, and giving their own lives. Still waiting for a feature film about Viola Liuzzo.

Maybe it's not such a bad thing that simplistic and overtly exploitative movies like this get made. If they interest any viewers in the Civil Rights movement, that's not a bad thing. Maybe it will inspire some to see a truly worthy film series, ""Eyes on the Prize.""

4306510,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I have to say, this is a pretty great book-to-film adaptation. The movie version of ""The Help"" really stays true to the spirit of Kathryn Stockett's popular novel. Set in Jackson, Mississippi, in the early 1960s, the film takes a close look at what life was like for the African American women who worked as maids in the homes of upper-class whites. The casting is spot on. This is the first movie I've ever seen Emma Stone in, believe it or not, and I am now officially a fan of hers. You can also see why Octavia Spencer won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as a result of her work in this film...she's fantastic! I appreciate that this is a long movie, so not as much needed to be cut from the book (though I was disappointed they omitted the whole toilet-training process, which is pretty central to the book, in my opinion). If you are like me and generally avoid film adaptations of great books because they usually, well, suck, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this one.",1353196800,,991,4.480662983425415

4306519,5,B004A8ZWVU,"After hearing about the incredible reviews that The Help was getting in theaters, I decided I should probably read the book then see the movie (which is what I usually do).  First off, I LOVED the book!  It has become one of my favorite books of all time.  I loved how it is written in the POV of the three main characters, Aibileen, Minny and Skeeter.  Such detail and so much history goes into the book of what really went on in Mississippi in the 1960s.

Now on to the movie.  Of course there were pieces left out of the book (which always happens...and I really don't like that), but in this case, it worked in a way because some of the scenes from the book were in different places in the movie which I thought worked rather well (i.e. Minny telling Skeeter & Aibileen about the ""special pie"" for Hilly before telling Celia).  Other than that, I personally adored the movie.  The actors are amazing and everyone fit their roles perfectly.

Although I adore Meryl Streep, I really think that Viola Davis deserved the Oscar for her performance as Aibileen.  She was just...I can't even put into words how incredible she was!  She really brought the character to life and I just loved the way in which she narrated the movie.  Until Doubt in 2008 I didn't really know who Viola Davis was; now she is up there as one of my favorite actresses!

Octavia Spencer who plays Minny was GREAT!  She truly deserved her Oscar for her role.  When I was reading the book, I kept picturing her as Minny.  I already knew that she played her in the movie, but it was just so easy to picture her in the book as well.  She told the truth and didn't care who heard her!  My favorite scene was definitely when she brought Hilly the pie...that special pie just for Hilly.  I won't say any more just in case people have not seen the movie or read the book; but if/when you do, you will just burst out laughing!

Emma Stone was brilliant as Skeeter (Eugenia).  I had never really seen her in anything serious like this before.  She has mainly been in comedies so at first when I heard she was in this movie, I will admit I was a little skeptical.  I am so glad I was proven wrong.  Emma portrays Skeeter to a ""T"" in my opinion.  From her insanely curly hair to her charm to the way she would mouth off at Hilly or her mother at times was great.  I do wish that we got to see a few more scenes of Skeeter and Stuart though.  And I wish we got to see her telling him about the book instead of his reaction.  But all in all, Emma gets an 'Easy A' (haha).

Allison Janney...oh my goodness.  I think that the role of Charlotte was made for her.  She was really lovable at times and then you just wanted to yell at her (especially when you find out about Constantine).  I do wish that there was more of a build up to Skeeter finding out about her mother's condition rather than it being known to her already, but I guess that's what you have to do in movies.  Still, it was quite effective.  Especially their talk towards the end.

And then of course there is Bryce Dallas Howard.  Oh Hilly.  Bryce was simply brilliant in portraying the villainess here.  She was just as sarcastic, rude, and stuck up as she was in the book.  I do wish that there was a scene (I think there may have been but it was deleted) where she convinces Elizabeth (the woman Aibileen works for) to get an outdoor bathroom for Aibileen.  However it was mentioned in another scene after the bathroom was put in.  Bryce really sold the character here and really made you hate her.  At times I forgot I was watching a movie!

I cannot recall their names, but the two little girls who played Mae Mobley (or Baby Girl as Aibileen calls her) were terrific.  They could not have been more than 3 years old when this movie was made and they were simply adorable.  Like the title of my review, that is my favorite line she says with 'Aibee'.

If you loved the book, chances are you will love the movie too.  Of course the book has a lot more detail, but this is just a magical movie that is both dramatic and comedic at times and really tells the stories of what it was probably like for maids in the 1960s in the south.",1351728000,,4159,4.259590792838875

4306524,5,B004A8ZWVU,"Having grown up in the 50's, I lived with segregation.  I didn't live in the South, but knew people who did.  I have to say, this movie was well written, trying to incorporate a way of life known and practiced by Southerners, shown through the eyes of the help.  My Mother cleaned other people's houses to help earn money for her family.  Though she was white, working for whites, she had very similar experiences.  But, I can't imagine what it was like for a black woman to work for a Southern white family.

4306547,3,B004A8ZWVU,"This movie seemed to parallel the book. I enjoyed watching it, but I wasn't hooked, where I watched it straight through. It took me two days to watch it.  It was a good movie though.  It took one person like Eugenia Phelan (Skeeter) to have a little courage to stand up for what is right, to inspire others to help and support her in her endeavor to write a book that may ease life for colored people in Jackson, Mississippi and other states. Although we won't know if there were instantaneous results from the storyline, we can gather that there will be changes to come because of our many history lessons in school. It definitely tells a story of the challenges and difficulties colored people had even after slavery.  I encourage you to watch the movie or read the book to see what life was like for colored people from a fictional perspective. If anything, for those who aren't that into history education,(like me), then I encourage this movie or book also because you can learn a bit of history from a fictional perspective.  And for those who were expecting a romantic happy ending for Skeeter, it isn't in the sense of Stewart, but in a sense of her success as a writer.

4306550,1,B004A8ZWVU,"Ehow: How can I turn a great read into a general appeal movie without integrity or appeal?

This is surely what the screenplay writers and Disney typed into google when they sought to turn New York Times bestseller, The Help, into a movie. I feel for Stockett, although she is surely happy to see her 1st novel do so well and to have sold it for the big screen. It must, however, have been a bittersweet day when she saw her baby at the premier. The book itself was a page  turner, well written, realistic and thrilling. I loved it! The movie lost all of that intensity, with the overall message of the film straying so far from what Stockett had portrayed. I can't imagine how she must have felt afterwards. I think I would have been ill once I got home. There is a review by The Cool Guy here at Amazon, in which he detailed illogical scenes and messages of the movie, I will not include these here as his review does this well. I hope he reads the book, these problems are not present there. I also feel for the actors of this film. What an amazing offer to have a role in what could have been a film to remember.  They did what they could with what was written, however, the screenplay writers and directors really took a wonderful opportunity away from them with their decision to write the movie as they did. I look forward to seeing them in films that deserve the name. As a movie, it was cute, distracting - not a 1 star but not a 5 star either. My question, were the producers, directors and editors rushed by some selling force as was portrayed by Elaine Stein when she urged Skeeter to hurry up and send her manuscript, ""before this whole civil rights thing blows over.""?",1346112000,5,1682,4.333333333333333

And this movie was absolutely great,  The acting was top notch, and to see acting royalty like Cicely Tyson and Sissy Spaseck take relatively small parts, says a lot about just how good this movie is.  The story is rich and complex.  It takes a very awful situation, segregation, and shows how there were sometimes real bonds between the white people and the black people!  It's good to see that at least a few of the white people come off as decent!

And while I can't condone the black woman who served doo-doo pie, I can't really blame her!  As an abused, disabled, woman, of low income I tend to identify with others who are also downtrodden!

4306561,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I realize now after seeing this movie,I never saw color in a person. We had colorful family reunions,so it wasn't something we saw. The Help was an emotional, moving movie that made me want to shake the  shoulders of everyone but Skeeter. The beauty of her heart was so amazing. This movie I realize is how the country should have changed and still should change,in so many ways. This is so true to life in that,it left me and my daughter raw with emotion that there was a life, like this, outside our world. It was called color. America it seems can't let go, even in 2012 over skin color issues. I mean nothing,NOTHING is different in the people in this movie and in the audiences, but one teeny thing,their skin color. Everything else is the same. Every body part of men and of women and of children is the same. This is how it is suppose to be. So The Help makes you aware, if you weren't already,that there should not be a difference. It grabs a hold of your soul, as it did Skeeters mom and Skeeters ""good riddance  ,boyfriend, but sadly in opposite ways. I recommend watching and purchasing this wonderful movie and remembering it after you walk out of the theatre or your living room  and never forget it. Be a Skeeter and  love. You will have one less sin to account for at Heavens door ,if hate isn't among them.  A very good movie with amazing actors.",1343433600,,1362,4.388888888888889
4306562,5,B004A8ZWVU,"""The Help"" is one of those films I can watch over and over.  After seeing it at the theater and about five times (so far) on TV, I cannot imagine any other actresses playing any of the roles.  All were exceptional and worthy of the many accolades and rewards they received for the film.  Emma Stone was overshadowed by some of the showier roles of her co-stars, but she gave a great performance as Skeeter.  The scene with her mother (played by Allison Janney) where the two discuss the fate of their former maid, Constantine, brings tears to my eyes every time.

An actress other than Bryce Dallas Howard, as the contemptible Hilly, may have played the role as a one-note cliche.  But Howard's portrayal of Hilly's racism was fantastic.  At times, she seethes with outright rage; at other times, we merely see it simmering beneath the surface.  But she is always frighteningly believable.  Howard makes Hilly both detestable and pitiable; her final scene made me hurt, albeit just a little, for Hilly.

Jessica Chastain broke out in 2011, due in large part to her role as the innocent and unaffected Celia.  Her scenes with her maid, Minny (Octavia Spencer), were some of my favorites in the film.  One can only hope that the trusting, respectful, and affectionate relationship depicted by the pair truly existed in 1960's Mississippi.

Saving the best for last: Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis.  These two shine both individually and in their depictions of their close friendship.  Spencer earned her Supporting Actress Oscar with her feisty, fierce performance and with the best lines in the film: ""Minny don't burn fried chicken.""  Davis, in the starring role as Aibileen, won a slew of awards but lost out on the Oscar to Meryl Streep.  She perfectly portrayed Aibileen's unwavering strength and dignity, even in the face of outrageously racist abuse.

For a film threaded with racism throughout, I was surprised at how much I laughed.  In fact, ""The Help"" portrays humor better than many conventional comedies.  We also see the damage caused by all degrees of racism.  Obviously, there is Hilly's overt variety at one end of the spectrum which seems rooted in ignorance, fear, and insecurity.  At the other end of the spectrum is Allison Janney as Charlotte.  We never see Charlotte interact one-on-one with a black character, but I would guess Charlotte would behave with respect and kindness in this situation.  We do, however, see Charlotte succumb to a kind of racist peer pressure, and it's awful to watch.  One could argue (and I would) that Charlotte's behavior is worse than Hilly's, as her actions cannot be explained away by stupidity.

""The Help"" is one of the best films I've seen in years.  So much warmth and laughter with this exceptional cast, and I recommend it highly.",1343433600,3,2792,4.872611464968153
4306563,5,B004A8ZWVU,"This 2011 blockbuster, based on the novel by Kathryn Stockett, has reminded me  of the only aspect in the ""Communist Manifesto"" that Marx had 100 % right is that the workers and the poor can be exploited under a capitalist system.
  Thankfully in America, the situation can be improved by strikes, labor unions, petitions, the ability to sue employers, and what I would call the Dickensian approach( after Charles Dickens, whose well-known literary works helped reform British societal ills in the 19th century)--writing a good and effective expose.
  In the Mississippi of the early 1960s, the last of those becomes the objective of one young journalist, appropriately named Eugenia(Greek for ""Well-born"")""Skeeter"" Phelan, a debutante, who, unlike most of her peers, feels there is more to life than bridge games, gossip, new dresses, and babies.
 A member of the Junior League, she is privy to the unjust aims of the local head of that organization, the villainous Hilly Holbrook(a firey Bryce Dallas Howard), whose petitions for the upscale homes in Jackson to have separate bathrooms for their non-white servants, due the the spread lie(highly reminiscent about those spread about Jews in Nazi Germany) that they carry different diseases than whites. These people who, while in many instances earning no real salaries, and who in some instances are willed to children by their masters, tend their gardens, clean their homes,  cook for them, and raise their children are deemed unfit to use their bathrooms!
 Also privy to this conversation is the middle aged maid narrating the story,Aibileen Clark( a world-weary Viola Davis), who works for Raleigh and Elizabeth Leefolt(Shane McRae, Ahna O'Reilly), and is the nanny to their toddler, Mae Mobley(Emma and Eleanor Henry). A neglectful mother to her child, Elizabeth, who is a weak-willed lackey to Hilly, is soon expecting another. We learn Aibileen has cared for 17 white children from the time she was in her early teens.
 In her Oscar winning turn as Minnie Jackson, the maid to the Holbrooks, Best Actress Octavia Spencer is a hard-bitten and sassy woman in a thankless job, and also raising six children while dealing with an abusive and drunken husband.
 Skeeter initially writes a newspaper column on housekeeping tips, some of which she gets from her girlfriends' housekeepers, and at home, she ponders the mysterious disappearance of the maid who loved and raised her, Constantine Jefferson(Cecily Tyson), an issue about which her ailing mother, Charlotte(Allison Janney) and her father, Robert(Brian Kerwin), are notoriously silent.
 As the Civil Rights struggle grows even further, Skeeter comes up with the idea of interviewing the maids of prominent families to inform the world of their plight in such crucial times. She contacts Harper and Row editor Elaine Stern(Mary Steenbergen) in New York, and through their phone conversations, we are led through various stages of the project's development. Notable moments in the Civil Rights battle are key to this aspect of the story as well.
 A side note to this story are the matchmaking attempts of both Charlotte and Hilly to fix Skeeter up with oil rig worker Stuart Whitworth(Chris Lowel). But Skeeter's project will have its impact even there.
 Encouraged by her pastor's(David Oyelowo) sermon about Moses, Aibileen, who keeps journals, reluctantly  begins her interview sessions with Skeeter, and Minnie eventually follows. We learn of the tragic death of Aibileen's son, Treelore, resulting from racist policies of the time, and follow  the blacks through innumerable slights and indignities.
 During a tornado, Minnie fans Hilly's dementia-plagued mother, Missus Walter(Sissy Spacek), and gets fired for not using the outdoor chamber despite the perilous weather. It is on this occasion that Missus Walter sums up Hilly's character in one sentence:""Daddy ruined you!""
 Appearing contrite due to her inability to find work after Hilly lied to other prominent families, saying Minnie was a thief, Minnie retaliates in a way that slaves --especially cooks had done in times past--by placing something unseemly in a food item and tricking the one who wronged them into eating it. Hilly will have the humiliation of having everyone in town know about it.
 There is a blatant irony to Hilly's presiding over a charity ball on behalf of starving children in Africa while treating the African descendants of her daily life with such contempt.
 As we discover, not only do those of Jackson's High Society dance to the music of those they are determined to keep as second class citizens, but Hilly's cruelty knows no racial bounds. She placed her own mother in a nursing home simply for laughing at what Minnie did to her. Skeeter gets in her digs at Hilly as well.
 Another person rejected by Hilly is the alleged bottle blonde, Celia Foote(played by Jessica Chastain with a Marilyn Monroe-like fragility). Deemed ""White trash"" by Hilly, et. al, she is married to Hilly's former sweetheart, Johnny Foote( Mike Vogel), and she is the only woman willing to give Minnie a job, especially since she needs to learn how to run a big upscale household. Minnie tends to her through one of her several miscarriages, and we see the sunny, bubbly beauty overcome social awkwardness to take a swipe at Hilly, and perform an act of kindness and gratitude that encourages Minnie to improve her life.
 The death of Medgar Evers encourages more maids to tell their stories to Skeeter despite great risks.
 Skeeter finally learns the truth about her own beloved Constantine's departure, which she is required to include in the book.
 ""The Help"" becomes a bestseller that causes quite a stir in Jackson. Hilly angrily denies the episode that all know pertains to her, and vows recriminations on those responsible.
 Aibileen and Minnie receive plaudits for their courage in church, Charlotte praises her daughter's courage, and the lives of the three female protagonists take different turns--in one case, at the expense of a little girl who loses the only person who truly cared for her at Hilly's command.
 But a final question asked of Hilly is one that could be asked of any perpetual hater with a vengeful streak: ""Ain't you tired, Miss Hilly? Ain't you tired?""

4306574,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I just LOVED this movie! Alot of OUTSTANDING actors are in this movie! It is about a young, southern woman named Skeeter, who wants to become a journalist & a novelist! So she gets a job at the local newspaper, and her job is to answer everyone's housekeeping questions. So she askes one of her friends, that she plays bridge with if she can interview her maid Aibileen, played by (Viola Davis), to help her with her housekeeping column!

 And Skeeter learns so much about Aibileen's life, as a black maid in the South during the Civil Rights era! Aibileen's friend, Minny, played by ( Octavia Spencer)also tells Skeeter about her life as a maid!

 This turns into a personal thing with Skeeter, because while she was growing up in the south, she also had a black maid in her family named Constantine, that she dearly loved, played by ( Cicely Tyson). And Skeeter learns first hand about how her bridge playing, so-called white friends, and even her family, mistreated & used their black maids! So Skeeter writes a book, about all the stories that, the black women, who were maids to white people, tolded her!

  The black women who played the maids touched my heart, especially Viola Davis, Cicely Tyson, and Octavia Spencer! THEY ARE OUTSTANDING ACTORS, AND DESERVE AN OSCAR!!  I highly recommend this movie!! It is an AWESOME MOVIE! It gives you a glimpse of how hard it was for the black people, in the South, during the Civil Rights era!! And this movie will tug at your heart, and it will also make you smile!!",1341792000,,1516,4.609665427509293
4306575,3,B004A8ZWVU,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.

The Help is a pretty good movie with some funny moments, and a good look at the other side of households in the 1960's. The new Gwen Stacy leads a solid cast in one of the best films of the year. (However, The Artist earned Best Picture fair and square; I think that Viola Davis should have tied with Meryl Streep for Best Actress, though I have not yet seen The Iron Lady, and that Berenice Bejo & Jessica Chastain should have tied with Octavia Spencer for Best Supporting Actress; it has happened before, you know...two actors winning the same award). Throughout the film, I couldn't help but think with regret over how I impulsively ended a friendship I had with a black girl last year who had never been anything but nice to me. And that I sincerely regret.

There was one aspect of a scene that I did not like, and it's probably not the scene you're thinking of. Though I will not say what that aspect is, I just had to say that.

I give the movie three stars because it profanes God's name by combining His Name wth a mild curse word, thereby making it a strong profanity. Why do film-makers feel the need to disrespect our Creator by profaning His Holy Name? The third Commandment saith, Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain.-The Second Book Of Moses Called Exodus 20:7 and The Fifth Book Of Moses Called Deuteronomy 5:11.

All the white women are skinny and ditsy. All the blacks are wise and noble (even when serving their own sh! t). The men are scenery. Where are the illiterate maids who can't tell their stories much less write them down? Where are the smart, intelligent women, who nevertheless give their kids to black women they don't respect to raise? No mention of sexual harassment. Indeed.... did anyone involved in this project ever have a maid?

4306578,4,B004A8ZWVU,"I was part of a packed, vocal, enthusiastic screening audience who appreciated every minute of this marvelous snapshot of the segregated 60s in Jackson, Mississippi, when Jim Crow laws were still in effect.

The stories, based on Kathryn Stockett's phenomenally successful (and beloved) novel, are female-centric, as they focus on the relationships among the women, black and white, employee and employer, complete with abuse of power, sincere affection, bitchiness, and well-founded fear. The men in the audience were equally vocal because men in this story are not demonized: Racism and ignorance are the villains here.

The casting is to die for:
  * Viola Davis (""It's Kind of a Funny Story"") is Aibileen, the heart, brains and soul of this wonderful story.
  * Emma Stone (""Crazy, Stupid, Love"") is Skeeter, the well-meaning young wannabe writer. She is told by her New York publisher to hurry with her book about black domestics working for prominent white families, before ""this whole civil-rights thing blows over.""
  * Octavia Spencer (""Dinner For Schmucks"") is Minny, who has most of the funny lines. I know the word ""sassy"" is overworked, but this sister is sassy! And in case you read the book, YES, she does bake that pie! (Spencer won an Oscar for this role.)
  * Bryce Dallas Howard (""Hereafter"") is Hilly, the witch we love to hate. Her comeuppance can't come any too soon and is greeted with cheers from the audience.
  * Jessica Chastain (""Jolene"") is Celia, the lost soul taken under the warm wing of her maid where she learns some necessary survival skills.
  * Allison Janney (""Life During Wartime"") is Charlotte, our writer's mother, who has her own heart-breaking story.
  * Sissy Spacek (""Get Low"") is Missus Walters, she just wants Ambrosia salad, a bit of sherry and her ""soaps."" Her glee when her nasty daughter hits a rough patch is infectious.
  * Cicely Tyson (""Why Did I Get Married Too?"") is Constantine, the elderly domestic who is wrongfully fired.
  * David Oyelowo (""The Rise of the Planet of the Apes"") is Preacher Green, the local neighborhood preacher. This adroit actor was born in the U.K.

I'm frustrated because time and space do not permit me to include all the deserving names. Suffice it to say, the talent in this cast is broad and deep.

This PG-13 film has no profanity; domestic abuse is only implied; and you will see no gunfights, car chases or blowie uppie stuff. Teenagers can learn what our world was like just a few short decades ago. They will be shocked! I've ordered my copy from Amazon.",1341446400,,2546,4.872093023255814

I was drawn in to this movie immediately. I like to learn about new things, and as I was watching it, I realized that this is a topic that I really know very little about. Most movies that cover the 60s in the south focus on the civil rights struggle, extreme racism, hatred, and politics. This felt more like dropping into the day to day lives of ordinary people. People just don't talk about this kind of stuff. Either the drama of the lynchings, church burnings or Martin Luther King take center stage, but these types of stories are very important too! They helped to inform my view of a segment of society (both black and white) that I just have never had any connection with.

I felt the love of the writer, director and actors in bringing this story to life. It seemed that they wanted to give it a feeling that only being in MS could create. It felt like a tribute to their past, their history, and the important people in their lives. It wasn't perfect, but it was compelling.

4306586,4,B004A8ZWVU,"I absolutely enjoyed this film.  Viola Davis carries her main character with so much grace and dignity - it is magical to see her portray a housekeeper who is also a nanny.  Story is placed in the deep south, during 1960s when civil rights movement is taking its momentum.  But like every movement, it takes time for it to reach rural areas and small towns.

Emma Stone plays Skeeter, a white girl from privileged family who is not looking for husband after her college graduation; she is looking to establish herself as a journalist and writer.  She is sensitive and caring person and she her physical appearance fits perfectly for her role.  Her curly hair expresses her inner rebellion of the world around her; her big eyes communicate a much deeper emotions which are hearbreaking once she starts meeting with maids who tell her their stories from their years of service to while affluent families in town.

This is a fabulous movie for every generation and both genders.  It is a reminder of time passed and it is also a humble look at strength these ordinary women had in order to server families that often humiliated them and then go back to their husbands who often treated them no better.",1340582400,,1198,4.671428571428572

She's the only one in the Junior League who notices that the black servants must silently endure insults and degradation at the hands of their oblivious employers.

I loved the book and was glad that the movie is just as good.  The cruelty heaped on the help by their snooty bosses is heart-breakingly portrayed.  Bryce Dallas Howard was surprisingly good as the nasty queen bee of the Junior League and Emma Stone is refreshing and likable as the brave Skeeter.  Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer play Aibileen and Minny, two long-time maids who risk everything to contribute to Skeeter's book.  They both give outstanding performances.

So when my full attention was caught I was amazed with myself and the book. There was no way that I could put it down until I was at the end; about 12 hours later.  I was a child of this era so it was startling to hear about it as a adult rather than a child.  What a big difference.  I have already given excellent feedback to all my friends and whoever I saw that had it in there hands at the book store.  The ending was a refreshing change from what I imagined.

In short: Blacks are terrorized by racists (was the rule) whites in Jackson, MS, most whites are evil, some actually care, most who were evil ended up caring without traces of evil (although blacks are still the help and whites are the masters!) and blacks have something to smile about in the end - but whites end up looking like saints!

This is pretty much what I expected from this film before I saw it and it was as expected.  I know it goes along with the story, but the black leads were so terrified of whites that they anticipated the feelings of the whites, did not talk back, did not think for themselves and were basically slaves in a new era.  This was shameful to watch, but this type of thing was indeed real.  THe actreses (black leads) were great and the acting was indeed worth of Oscars, but they played their parts a little too well, especially Octavia Spencer!  She over-played that ""fried chicken"" scene too much.  I would not have played that scene.  With all of the hate from whites, it was shocking when we only heard the ""N"" word about once or twice!

Of course a feel good film about blacks getting an eas in racism from whites and white seeing some of the light while only one is still a hard-core racist, could not be comeplete without making the black MAN look the most evil of ALL!  We did not see his face, but Minnie's husband was a woman beater and vicious, while the other black males in the films had minimal lines and were all willing servants and scared stright while the black women were strong!  The only strong black man was the woman beater!  This is a trend in Hollywood.  I trend I don't like!

The picture quality was excellent and the film itself was great, just much of the content is what I don't like.  Ocatavia Spence reminded me of some Amos N Andy type characters with her eye movements, body movements such as he acting nervous whenever something happened to a white character and he hands almost flailing up as well.  Either she did some great acting or this reminded me of watchin blacks in a 1930's or 40's film!  Sometimes you need to ease up on your performance!",1337904000,3,2278,4.398568019093079

Even after Stein clearly recognizes the literary/commercial merit of the work, she continues her sadistic ways by making a non-negotiable demand for a full manuscript in a completely unreasonable amount of time.  The director deftly emphasizes Stein's cruelty by having her layout her demand over the phone while gaily enjoying her evening with two male companions in New York.

4306614,4,B004A8ZWVU,"Set in early 60s Jackson, Mississippi, Tate Taylor's ensemble drama@gThe Helph is a blend of pathos, drama and comedy. It is a fable, well told and bitter sweet. Maybe some people (including me) would find it a bit too sweet. It is a good fable, nonetheless, most notable for the great performance of Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer.

""The Help"" follows the story of Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan (Emma Stone), who has just come back home after graduating college. As an aspiring writer, Skeeter attempts to interview the maids including Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) to record their story in a book. Aibileen, at first very reluctant, finally agrees. Then outspoken Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) joins. She has many things to say, especially about her former employer, a society lady Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard).

""The Help"" seems too eager to please while trying not to offend anyone. Some characters, whether they are ggoodh or gbad,h are almost like caricatures, especially Bryce Dallas Howardfs Hilly Holbrook. Even Emma Stonefs heroine lacks the depth of the character Sissy Spacek (who appears as Hillyfs cynical mother) played in gThe Long Walk Homeh about 20 years ago, a more unique and fleshed out heroine who knows what she is doing. Ifm not sure whether or not Skeeter really understands the impact the book would leave in the community.

The only person who really knows it is Aibileen played by Viola Davis. When end credits roll up, we realize that gThe Helph is after all about her character. See the film for her strong, Oscar-worthy performance.",1337126400,,1569,5.026923076923077

Loved the book...decided to watch the movie right after to compare and it was such a letdown. I understand it is hard to make a book become a 2 hour movie...a lot has to cut out, but things were changed that I didn't like and after reading the hoopla in pop- culture mags regarding the lady actors who portayed the maids?
 All I can say is Viola Davis was robbed! She deserved the oscar win. Octavia Spencer who played Minnie was fun to watch and she did a great job, but Minny's character was very subdued in the film compared to the book...Minny was much more complicated and moody...I didn't see any of that in Spencer's portayal. Viola played her character (Aibeleen)'right on' and I feel she could not have done much better...JMO, not that it means all that much.

I encourage people to read the book  as opposed to this movie even if it requires some effort. This novel is a great choice for book groups and for study in schools. It offers opportunity for honest dialogue about inquality...to identity the differences of inequalities between racial prejudice and that of social class. The book is important..everyone should read it and talk about it but the movie..well, it is okay, but that is all there is to it.",1337040000,,1507,4.549815498154982

4306620,5,B004A8ZWVU,"The first thing that came to my mind the moment I began reading The Help by Kathryn Stockett was her vernacular. Kathryn Stockett is what you will term 'white', for lack of a better word. But it's amazing how she manages to fit into the day-to-day vernacular of a 'colored' woman. Her language is free-flowing, easy and natural, and no where in the book does it feel like she is making an effort or any of it is made up. Full points to her for that.

 The story is told from the point of view of three main female characters - Aibileen, the motherly, loving, intelligent colored maid, who works as a nanny and maid; Minnie, who is a sassy, sharp-tongued maid, but clearly one of the best cooks the white ladies have ever had; Miss Skeeter, a young white female who has recently returned from college, only to find that her beloved Constantine, the colored maid who raised her and took on the figure of a real mother for her, has suddenly disappeared, and who now has the passion to share her thoughts on what she feels is needed today to make this world a better place, and who clearly does not believe in racial discrimination and wants to do something to bring an end to it.

 The Help is set in the 70s, in Jackson, Mississippi, a time when apartheid was rampant, especially in the areas mentioned in the book, and the discrimination between colored and white people was openly practised.

The story:
 Aibileen is a mother-figure, a colored woman who has spent her life, from the time she was a pre-teen, in the house of 'white' people raising their babies - 17 to be precise. And for each of the babies she has raised, she has a special place in her heart. Some have turned out to be just the way she hoped, the babies she once held in her arms have turned out to be amazing as human beings, while a few have learnt the ways of their parents and grown up to discriminate the very race that brought them up with so much love and care. Aibileen has recently lost a grown-up son, and she confesses that something inside her has now changed. Her son, educated and intelligent, was writing a book on being a black in America in the 70s, but being colored meant he could not get a decent job, and he was forced to work as a cargo man, hauling heavy stuff. It was on one such night that he got crushed and his white employer put him in a truck and once outside the colored hospital, rolled off his body and drove off. Aibileen's son died, taking away something from his mamma's life forever. As Aibileen begins her new job looking after Mae Mobley, the white baby of Miss Elizabeth Leefolt, we are taken into the home of the whites, to see the discrimination that is seeped in society and its culture.

 The same maid who is deemed fit to raise a white infant and take care of her all needs is not seen fit to use a bathroom that white guests may use. A colored maid cannot sit at the same table to eat, she is not allowed to speak to a white person unless a white person talks to her, and even while handing out a coffee cup, a colored maid is expected to first place the cup on the table, so that the white person will not come into contact with the colored skin, even by accident.

 Minnie is Aibileen's best friend, despite their age gap. A tough, colored woman, raising her brood of kids, living with a husband who is drunk and beats her up regularly, the pressures of providing for her children falls mainly on her. This is not easy, especially for Minnie, as she is notorious for having a sharp-tongue and a sassy attitude, one that lands her in trouble often. She does not hide her contempt for the way the whites treat the coloreds, and she is not afraid to speak her mind, many times at the cost of her job even.

 Skeeter is a white who is now feeling alien in her own white world. She has recently returned to her family's plantation and mansion after completing college. While her friends busy themselves with clothes, shoes, bridge parties and gossip, all the while mistreating or ignoring the colored people around them, Skeeter finds it increasingly difficult to abide by these so-called 'white' rules of etiquette. She is appalled at the way the colored are being humiliated, and she finds many loopholes in a society that otherwise calls itself 'perfect' and 'classy.' Determined to become a journalist, Skeeter lands herself a job as a 'housekeeping advice columnist', and while she has no idea of anything related to housework, she resolves to find a house help who can help her with her own column. It is in this capacity that she gets to chat with Aibileen, her best friend Elizabeth's colored help.

 As the story unfolds,
a strange friendship begins to form between Skeeter and Aibileen. Not a friendship in the beginning, it is more of a relationship that sees both women trying to understand the world of the other. While Skeeter wants to overcome the racial boundaries and tries to be friends with Aibileen and try to understand what she must be going through with so much discrimination and ill-treatment each day, Aibileen wants to figure out how a white woman suddenly is trying to reach out to her, trying to be friends, asking after her life and her feelings!

 As Skeeter begins to see more of Aibileen, she enters a circle that was till now invisible to her. While interacting with her best friends Elizabeth and Hilly, she begins noticing their attitude towards their maids, and the way they treat them. She also remembers her own upbringing at the hands of her colored maid, Constantine, and realises that Constantine must have faced many such humiliations too, even though she never complained. When Skeeter sends a job request to a publishing house editor, she is asked to write something fruitful, something that is different, something that catches the pulse of the society, something that talks about a 'change.' Interacting with Aibileen and seeing the attitudes of her friends, Skeeter realises soon what she is going to talk about.

 What begins as a relationship between Skeeter and Aibileen as the former starts to write about her life and experiences, soon grows into a bond that both begin to cherish, and very soon, Minnie also joins the two, sharing her own experiences, and the trio form an unlikely bond, an unlikely friendship.

 With racial discrimination growing and colored facing inhuman treatment at the hands of the whites, discontent is everywhere, and very soon, many colored women join Skeeter in the secret mission of writing about their lives and experiences.

 When the book comes out, the entire white society is shaken up, and its effects are felt everywhere. At the time when Martin Luther King and apartheid were a burning truth in society, the topics that Skeeter, Aibileen and Minnie deal in are sure to come with their own burning results - and they do.

 Characters:
 What I loved about the novel is Stockett's portrayal of the characters. While Aibileen, Minnie and Skeeter are clearly the protagonists, the antagonist in the story, Hilly Holbrook, is a character who is drawn to the last bit of detail. She is clearly meant to be hated, and Stockett manages to get just that out of her readers. By the end of the novel, I was cheering for Hilly's problems and humiliations - clearly doing exactly what the author intended me to do. The other character who is extremely adorable even in her quirky ways, is Celia Foote, the 'yellow-haired' bimbo, who is termed as 'white trash' by the society ladies and is made into a social outcast, even despite her many attempts to gel into society and be a part of the Jackson elites. While others derogate Celia for her 'vulgar' ways, we get to see her attitude towards her 'help', whom not only does she treat as an equal, but whose maid, Minnie, is surprised at Miss Celia's attitude, as no white lady ever treats a 'colored' maid this well.  Another character who ends up being likeable is Skeeter's mother, who is constantly trying to teach her daughter to behave lady-like, constantly nagging and telling her to wear this, do this, do that, and constantly manages to irritate Skeeter. The next character is Elizabeth Leefolt, a white who is not as rich as the society ladies of her times, but who is doing all she can to make it up. She is in awe of Hilly, her best friend, and ends up doing things the way Hilly says or wants. When faced with a tricky situation, she goes by what Hilly tells her to do, not by her own instinct. We also see her complete dependence on her 'colored' maid Aibileen, who she leaves to take charge of her infant entirely, but for whom she gets a separate toilet made out in the garage, just because Hilly didn't approve of the colored maid and the guests using the same toilet.

 The book is a MUST-READ for anyone who would like to read a narration that is set in an important historical era, an issue that stirred up the world and that was one of the biggest causes of the past, and sometimes, even today. Though it is a work of fiction, the author has borrowed instances from many real-life events. At the end of the book, she gives us an insight into her own life, how she and her siblings were brought up by a colored help, and how she never thanked her for it. She says she too had behaved like many of these white women in her own life as a child, not giving much thought to her colored help, and is now truly ashamed of her thoughtlessness. The book will make many of us take another look at the way we treat our helps, at the way we treat those in society who are at lower rungs, and many times, treated poorly because of that.

 Kathryn Stockett has given us a winner. Of course the movie received many international awards and nominations, but the book is any day much much more and much more detailed. A movie can never have the time and the logistics to completely capture the book's every detail, and it is because of this that I would recommend that you definitely read the book, even though you may have seen the movie.",1336608000,,9979,4.527777777777778

The only one who exhibited any emotion was Ms. Celia, and her story was just a sidenote.  The book had all the politically correct themes: New York Jew, good--Mississippi Christian, bad.  Working woman, good--homemaker, bad.  Poor people, good--rich people, bad.  The ugly duckling is of course the hero, and the author even threw in a passage on homosexual acceptance near the end.  The pie thing was absolutely disgusting, and infuriated me.  So this woman doesn't have the guts to stand up to her husband's beatings, but she's brave enough to do something like that?  Plus, so what if they wrote a book outing their bosses?  Skeeter benefited, but the help didn't. Their lives didn't change for the better at all, so what was the point.

I am happy this movie was made since there are so many of us living today who can relate to that period in time, who can see the injustice that people endured just to survive.

4306642,2,B004A8ZWVU,"Look, I haven't read the book nor plan to but this movie is something Hollywood pats their backs about. ""Oh, look, we've made a movie from a bestselling book about an injustice...that happened now 50 years ago! Let's navelgaze at how bad our past was and congratulate ourselves for not employing illegal aliens as maids now...oops, OK, well, we treat our maids well and pay them union wages...Oh, we don't...Oh, never mind, just watch this movie then."" I guess that means the movie about Latino or Filipina maids abused and bullied across the globe will come out in 2062.

Anyway, I found the actual movie ponderously slow. It takes a full hour and a half of buildup to get interesting. Why so much back story? We get it. Pick up the pace!

The acting is overall good bar Dallas Bryce Howard who can't act her way out of a paper bag. The token bone of a love ""story"" for Emma Stone was unnecessary and seemed completely irrelevant. There is a distinctive lack of males in this chick flick overall and even the abusive husband of one of the maids we never even see. Not that the one scene is not effective but it was like they wanted to show an African-American world where men only existed offscreen. In fact the major references were news stories of the time shown in a magazine article on Medger Evers and the TV broadcast of the Emmett Till murder. (Those of you unaware, Wiki both names and learn something of the Civil Rights Movement from something other than movies).

The story would have been better served by tighter editing, axing at least 30 minutes off the long drawn-out snoozefest start and having way way more of Ocatvia Spencer's character onscreen.

The extras are shameful. All we get is deleted scenes. Come on! This DVD was a perfect opportunity to have an actual mini-documentary on what life was really like for these maids in Mississippi in the '60s. After all, the movie is really supposedly a life lesson on the evils of racism.",1334620800,4,1954,4.60632183908046

4306645,4,B004A8ZWVU,"It's during the JFK Presidency and there are talks of civil rights by Martin Luther King but things haven't changed much for the black folks in Jackson, Mississippi and you can see the great division between them and the whites: separate hospitals, different neighborhoods, other parts of the bus and even the female maids, who take care of the little white children, are told to use a different bathroom because it is believed they carry diseases different from the white folk. It's pretty unsettling to see something that was taken as the norm and yet only happened quite recently in our history. A progressive white woman (Emma Stone) decides to get the maids to open up and talk about what it's like and after a lot of resistance (because they could easily be killed or beaten by white supremacists) they begin to share the injustices of their jobs as well as their little victory/revenge moments (which are recorded anonymously). Some of the white wives treat their maids as you would expect: some are nice, most follow the societal norm and a minority are just plain out manipulative and cruel. Octavia Spenser, who would pick up Best Supporting Actress from the Academy Awards, plays the smart mouthed Minny Jackson who gets that special moment with the pie. The cruel white girl ringleader had a mother she forces into a rest home. Until I saw the credits I didn't realize that was Sissy Spacek. Allison Janney (from the ""West Wing"") plays the mother of the main character. The budget for this picture was $45M and it has so far made over $206M (Wiki). The Academy Awards additionally nominated this film for Best Actress and Best Picture. It is based on a novel of a similar title by Kathryn Stockett.

4306648,5,B004A8ZWVU,"Rarely does a film get released with such anticipation. Not the kind of anticipation you would get from a Harry Potter or Star Wars film. Every now and again a film about a real point in time that caused a major change in history is released and since the new millennium none were priased as `The Help'

This is a film based on a fantastic book about women growing up in the deep south in the early 1960s and the African American women that helped them in their everyday lives. Yet, in this time there was only a select few that knew that times were changing. In this film that person was enveloped in a girl named Skeeter, who knew there was an important story to tell that these Black women were afraid to tell, but had no idea what it would do to two races of people.

I was fortunate to read this novel and I have to say that this was an incredible film adaption. The ensemble cast was amazing and the story is so heartwarming and uplifting. While this film does revolve around females it is by no means a `chick flick'. It is a story about hope and learning to step up and take a chance for what you believe in. Even if you have no idea what the consequences will be. `The Help is a great film that tells the story about a time in American history that is not really touched upon in such depth and this movie really brings out the humanity in the time and it is a true classic.",1334275200,,1382,4.152985074626866

4306668,5,B004A8ZWVU,"Being a movie buff, I always make an attempt each year to see as many of the Academy Award Best Picture nominees as possible, sometimes that means sitting through a few ""chick flicks"" if necessary.  But The Help had a couple of things going for it that drew me to it personally: the primary reason being that I was a small child during the era depicted in the film and I wanted to see if they got the details down right.  But there are so many more reasons to see The Help than just nostalgia; the first is a great story about the quiet people who went about their business, doing their jobs, while momentous events were happening all around them.  The second is a terrific cast of great actresses in great roles, even in the smaller parts: Octavia Spencer steals the show as Minny, she won the Oscar, but she is in some great company: Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Jessica Chastain, Alison Janney, Bryce Dallas Howard, Mary Steenburgen, and old pros  Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson have their best parts in years.  The third is a great script, based on Kathryn Stockett's novel, that gives it characters room to develop and drive the story, it never goes over the top or resorts to cheap feel-good sentiment; the cruelty and tragedy of the Jim Crow South is allowed to speak for itself.  And for some of the characters, there is no promise that life will be happy from this point on, just that life will go on, even though evil people get their way, and that is a triumph in itself.  There are some ""chick flick"" staples, especially in The Help's depiction of its male characters, with one or two exceptions, they are all weak, shallow and disinterested in how the women in their lives really feel.  I strongly recommend getting the Blu-Ray edition, which truly brings out the beauty of the Mississippi locations.  And yes they do get the details right, bringing back for me  that long ago time of Bee-hives and Bouffants; flip flops and RC Colas, and the Four Seasons blasting on the radio.",1333324800,,1986,4.53781512605042

This is a very well-told story that is extremely well acted with often subtle performances that convey a beautiful story of risk, cooperation, hope, and compassion.  My only reason for not giving it five stars, though, is the editing--there are some scenes that drag, and they go slow for really no obvious reason.  This film easily could have been 20 minutes shorter with no loss.  It just doesn't feel tight.

4306683,4,B004A8ZWVU,"It seems these days that young people tend to ignore history or to relate to it only in the amount of time they've had on Earth. Anything beyond that is unimportant to them. At the same time they tend to focus more on social and media material than on things as simple as books, limiting themselves to the intake of knowledge. With the release of THE HELP, one can only hope that it inspires them to look deeper, to find out the real story of what happened with the civil rights questions of the sixties.

Set in the early sixties in Jackson, Mississippi, the story revolves around the black maids of this racially segregated town. These are the days when separate entrances and water fountains were considered normal. And while they are called on to use separate areas, the maids are considered good enough to basically raise white children and take care of white houses.

The main character in question is Aibileen (Viola Davis), a maid who works for a respectable family, taking care of their child Mae Mobley and teaching and taking care of her as well as cooking and cleaning the house. The friction in her world has been buried beneath years of racial prejudice but comes to a head when the leader of the Junior League, Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) tells the girls in the club everyone should have a separate bathroom for their hired help because they carry germs. She's so convinced she's written an initiative and sent it to the governor in hopes that it can be turned into a law.

Aibileen knows she can not react but it doesn't set well with her either. Neither does it set well with Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan (Emma Stone). Just back from college and hoping to find a job as a writer, Skeeter has just taken a job as a writer taking on letters concerning cleaning which she knows nothing about. Seeking advice and help, she turns to Aibileen who knows all sorts of cleaning secrets. When Hilly makes her bathroom initiative know, Skeeter doesn't think much of it and pushes back mentioning it in the Junior League's newsletter indefinitely.

As Skeeter and Aibileen get to know one another, Skeeter asks her if she'd be interested in talking to her about what its like to be a maid in Mississippi, what it's like to raise white people's children only to see them grow and become more like their parents. While she turns her down at first, eventually Aibileen realizes that she needs to find the courage it takes to let the truth be known. Once she does, the two begin putting together the book that will become known as THE HELP.

Skeeter does have an ulterior motive but she's up front with Aibileen from the start. Skeeter wants to be a serious writer and a publisher in New York would be interested in the stories she's seeking. As they progress she finds that the publisher wants more than just one or two maid's tales, they need more. Aibileen first recruits her best friend Minny (Octavia Spencer), a brash and at times abrasive maid who's having problems finding new employment as Hilly has recently fired her. Eventually due to other circumstances more maids join in.

But this is just the story of the maids that is the main focus. What also comes into play here is the story of Hilly and her controlling nature as well as her racist attitudes. Hilly rules the Junior League with an iron fist and the girls that belong follow her lead to the letter. This is the social atmosphere of Jackson at this time, a world where social stature is the most important thing. All women desire to be added to their midst and fear being shunned by the League and Hilly. But Hilly's actions eventually have consequences.

The story reveals itself as the world is changing. Medgar Evers is shot at one point and JFK's funeral is mentioned. Not only do these items bring the historical aspect of the time into play but they set the tone for what the world was like during this period. This is the most important thing that young people can gain from watching this. My guess is none of them would believe that anyone could be so backwards as is seen here but it did happen.

The revelations of the stories the maids have to tell and how they are treated by their white employers brings the tale of racism to a personal level, especially those of Aibileen and Minny. And Skeeter, who was raised in this atmosphere, has her eyes opened as well as each story is told to her. It's as if she's seeing the world around her for the first time.

THE HELP is not a movie that will give details and specific incidents to young people who see it concerning the civil rights movement. But as I stated earlier, it will be a nice jumping on point for them to begin looking into it. Many would be stunned to learn that there are still areas of the country that continue on this way.

The best part of this movie is that it's not a slap in the face. It's not an attack that paints one group as superior to the other or sets one race against another. Instead it uses Hilly to represent that vocal minority that leads others by the nose and forces them to do these things they know they shouldn't, sitting back and accepting things as they are in the hopes of being part of the in crowd. It uses Skeeter to represent the people who have stood by silent but are waking up to the realities around them. And it uses Aibileen and Minny to represent those who have been oppressed and have hope for a different future.  This is a movie that needs to be seen by youngsters who don't know what it was like. Perhaps in so doing they can realize that change was needed and needs to carry on.",1332806400,,5570,4.477832512315271

4306687,5,B004A8ZWVU,"Some have criticized ""The Help"" and its depiction of racism as way too easy on the eye and cheery on the ear - slyly dodging the 'physically' violent reality of segregation in 1960's Southern America in favour of entertainment. But I think that's being massively unfair to the movie's genuine achievement - it's brilliant portrayal of the 'mental' apartheid levelled every day at black people - which ran hand-in-hand with the opposite side of the coin - the love given to white children by black maids.

Adapted from Kathryn Stockett's book and Directed by Tate Taylor in 2011 - ""The Help"" has a virtual flood of truly blistering performances from black and white actresses at the top of their game - women given meaty material they want to do justice to. It's resulted in global box office success and a whopping 53 nominations - followed by as many wins (BAFTA and OSCAR included).

While Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Aunjanue Ellis have rightly been praised for their layered portrayals - I was blown away by the most difficult role of all - that of the odious Hilly Holbrook played by Bryce Dallas Howard. She is awesome as a truly hateful white woman with meanness literally hardwired into her DNA. Hilly Holbrook sits in her car and spitefully takes pleasure as she watches a black maid who crossed her be arrested by white cops - in the bathroom she marks the individual toilet sheets with a pen to see if her black maid crosses that sanitation line. Jessica Chastain too as the blonde and ample social outcast Celia Foote - who is perceived as a husband robber but is just lost - another belter of a performance. Lesley Jordan as a mouthy newspaper editor, Sissy Spacek as a mentally ailing mum, Mary Steenburgen as a New York book editor - so many class acts.

The story goes like this - a headstrong 22-year Southern gal called Eugenia 'Skeeter' Phelan decides to become a real writer (anything to avoid her mother's constant scheming towards marriage). Her subject matter is going to be the black maids who raised the white children of Alabama and their side of the story. The author will be 'Anonymous' and the book will be entitled ""The Help"". But of course because of fear and intimidation it doesn't prove easy to document and the journey tests Skeeter's loyalties and personal courage to the maximum too (spot-on casting in the lovely and hugely talented Emma Stone). It proves even more traumatic to her 'one-of-the-gals' mother Charlotte (a stupendous turn from Allison Janney) who makes a staggeringly crass mistake on the back of white peer pressure. But to get started - Skeeter needs a cohort. So when a middle-aged maid she knows gets fired - Skeeter gets her first interviewee. Giving a deeply humane performance, Viola Davis plays Aibileen Clark. Aibileen is 53 and works 8am to 4pm six days a week for peanuts money servicing husband and wife Raphael and Elizabeth Leefolt. She's also a full-time nanny to young Mae Mobley Leefolt their 3-year old daughter (she's mothered 17 children in her life). Aibileen has also lost her grown-up son Treelore to haphazard white working practices and now her job over a trumped-up 'theft of silver' charge. But she loves children - and even when useless mom Elizabeth callously fires her - Aibileen grabs the vulnerable and hurting child Mae Mobley - and in tears - reiterates her mantra of life positivity to her (those words title this review).

Aibileen's best friend is Minny Jackson - an ace cook and rotund force of nature (despite her husband's occasional beatings). After a hilarious incident involving pie and a non-nutritional substance contained within it (a really great joke that is milked for a good twenty minutes) - she too becomes involved (an unbelievably powerful and committed Octavia Spencer). Skeeter's nanny is the elderly and wise Constantine (beautifully played by veteran actress Cicely Tyson) - a source of love, encouragement and constancy in Skeeter's life. Her disappearance after 29 years service brings Skeeter face to face with her own mother's terrible attitudes...

Speaking of the darker side - there are scenes in ""The Help"" that genuinely shock. Black people forced to use the 'colored entrance' at the side of a cinema - rich beauty-parlour white mothers talking about diseases being passed from negroes to their white children through toilets - and worst of all - the chilling reading out of the ""Mississippi"" Law Book with its craftily-worded segregation tactics and Jim Crow rules that will literally have you wincing in your seat in disbelief.

Filmed on location in Greenwood, Mississippi - the homes and interiors are all real - and Stephen Goldblatt's incredible cinematography of the local scenery gives all of its 146 minutes a deeply rich hue. Better still - it's defaulted to 1.85:1 aspect ratio - so the picture fills your entire screen (no bars top or bottom). It means that the BLU RAY image is full-on beautiful all of the time. Add to this a gorgeous and emotive score by THOMAS NEWMAN (""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""Green Mile"", ""The Road To Perdition"" etc) and the whole thing feels special the moment it opens. The only downer for me came at the film's end in the form of the ubiquitous saccharine ballad - 'Living Proof' by Mary J. Blige. It would have been far better to simply play out to Newman's affecting music - and classier too.

EXTRAS: even though it's only 24 minutes long - the 'Making Of' is genuinely informative and even moving in places. The Author Kathryn Stockett and Director Tate Taylor are from Jackson, Mississippi and have known each other since childhood. More importantly they both came from broken homes and had black maids whom they loved and admired. It was a story they felt had to be told. Combining this with the magic touch of Steven Spielberg (one of the Executive Producers) - and you begin to understand why and how the lovely tone of the film was achieved and maintained - the right people were let do the job and not some Hollywood name. At just under 12 minutes duration - the 'In Their Own Words...' extra where Tate Taylor and Octavia Spencer talk to real 'Maids of Mississippi' is too short - but what there is of it - is wonderfully insightful and uplifting.

To sum up - touching, funny, horrifying and ultimately moving - ""The Help"" blew my family and myself away.

Well done to Kathryn Stockett, Tate Taylor, DreamWorks and all the good souls who fought to see it made.

4306699,3,B004A8ZWVU,"The feeling of guilt I had when viewing The Blind Side were echoed with The Help. Like that movie, it took the issue of racism and turned it into light-hearted comedy; all the while, the African American characters were left totally under developed.

For example: *Spoiler Alert* When the one maid defecated in her boss' pie, she was simply blacklisted. If it was truly reminiscent of pre-civil-rights Mississippi, she would've been tracked down and killed! Just to pay tribute to the real horrors of the south at the time, the filmakers did throw in one KKK related murder plot, but it seemed half-hearted and lazy.

The big saving grace of this film are the performances. Octavia Spencer more than deserved her Oscar win. Viola Davis was also excellent. But that brings up the bigger problem: how come talentless pretty white actresses like Katherine Heigel and Kate Hudson can continue getting starring roles in Hollywood films while brilliant actresses like Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis are still playing maids? If anything, that's the biggest question that arises from this film.",1332201600,,1087,5.067039106145251

The story line is convincing even if you haven't read the book, and the characters are very well played by Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Emma Stone, and other amazing actors. I love the flow of the story and how the movie just grips you the minute it starts. I'm not gonna talk about the movie itself because I'm sure most people who watch it must have read the book already. It is a well portrayed movie that simply grabs your heart. Not a scene can be deleted, no more no less, just perfect. You'll laugh and cry with the characters and will want more when it ends.

It is a great movie that tells the story of what life was truly like for maids back in that time.  The fact that this was a true story made it even more entertaining and emotional.

The Help made me laugh at times, and almost made me cry.  Growing up I have always been familiar with the civil rights movement and I had a sense of what life must have been like.  With this movie I got to see a glimpse into what life was like leading up to the civil rights movement that changed our country.  And also seeing how much the maids meant to some people, and how much they were mistreated by others.  I believe that this film serves a great purpose in showing my generation how just recently, life wasn't so perfect, and how things truly were in that time.

It is a moving film and I recommend it to anyone who is considering to get it.  This film is one that I know that I will treasure for a long time.

4306725,3,B004A8ZWVU,"Reading the book first would definitely be my advice before viewing this movie because with the movie it seems to focus solely on racial tensions and that's honestly not what the book is about. The book is truly about treating people with respect and kindness. There's one line towards the end of the book that sums it up perfectly on page 492 of the book, ""Wasn't that the point of the book? For women to realize, We are just two people. Not that much separates us. Not nearly as much as I'd thought."" The movie should have concentrated more on the relationships between the women instead of nearly eclipsing that with the circumstances during those times. The circumstances were more of the background of the story, it was the women's attitudes towards one another, their bond, their courage--all of that made the book what it was. The movie merely glossed over those and made the connection between the women nearly obsolete.

I don't expect the writers and directors of films to please everyone with the outcome, but sometimes, like with this movie, it seems they barely even try. When movies like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" was being adapted into films, script after script was rejected and rewritten before they came up with something satisfactory. Now? It seems they accept the first one simply because it has a beginning and an end and then idiots pat them on the back. All this director did was pull a bunch of lines from the book and arranged them. Not only that, he BUTCHERED some of the secondary plots. I'll give you examples:

1) Octavia Spencer WAS Minny Jackson and Jessica Chastain WAS the Miss Celia I'd pictured. They are both incredible actresses. But their parts were so limited, I felt as though their characters were cheated. The scene when Celia miscarried could have been more intense, so could her meeting with Johnny, but the thing that pissed me off the most was that I believe one of the most VITAL parts of the book were left out of the film. There was a part in the book where Minny tries to protect herself and Celia from a crazy man that came onto their property and in the end Celia is the one that ends up fending the attacker from Minny, basically saving her help's life.  It also showed their true relationship--that Celia FELT something for Minny. The part when a doctor had to be called when Celia lost her baby and was hemorrhaging badly and Minny was the one who called him was the actual proof that Minny had once saved her life. Yet, there was no such scene in the movie.

2) Why bother saying that Minny even had an abusive husband in the first place if the idiot writer was just going to act like sitting at a table seeing some food gave her enough courage to leave him? Huh? Really? His point was she'd taught her white boss how to cook so somehow that translated into her taking all of her kids and leaving a man she's been with it seems for probably 20 years and put up with his crap all that time and all of a sudden it's only now sitting at a table looking at good food is going to give her the gumption to go. The sad part is, people don't even scream that this is insulting the audiences' intelligence--everybody seems to be going along with everything this movie is and not saying a thing no matter how ridiculous this film made it seem.

3) Constantine's story in the movie makes little to no sense at all. There are so many vital elements left out of that story it's a shame; and the parts that the writer of the movie put in are simply an embarrassment. The movie just made Constantine's daughter look haughty and disrespectful and that's not how she should've been depicted at all. Lulabelle was Constantine's daughter's name in the book, but apparently in the screen adaption, ""Rachel"" was somehow more appropriate *shrugs* (As if Mae Mobley didn't sound like a ridiculous name? If you're going to keep a baby named Mae Mobley, why not keep Lulabelle?), but she was just as much a victim of circumstance as any of the other women and she had a reason to be angry as well. She didn't just barge into Charlotte's house for no reason at all. Charlotte's role in the movie was also changed--she was vicious and vindictive when it came to Constantine between the pages of the book and Charlotte really did do her wrong, but we get none of that in the movie.

I'm glad I read the book first because I'm not sure what my reaction would've been had I seen this watered down movie version. Knowing the back story for the characters and their situations was its only saving grace for me. Was the majority of the acting terrific? Yes, it was. Was it shot beautifully? Indeed, it was. Was the script poorly written? I must say, it was.

The real story, the one you find between the pages of the book in which this movie was based on, is ugly and powerful and wonderful all at the same time. It'll make you laugh and cry--and this is coming from someone who didn't even want to read the book at first. The book is about women and their friendships with one another, women and their relationships with their children, women and their relationships with the help they have in their household, women and their relationships with themselves. Race comes secondary when it comes to the real story found in the book. The movie was more flashy than anything with Lafayette from True Blood (don't get me wrong, I love Nelsan Ellis, and he's amazingly talented, but it's almost gimmicky to have certain actors in films nowadays and his part kind of felt that way even though he was flawless). Also the character given to Leslie Jordan (known for his role on Will and Grace as Beverley Leslie) came off that way as well--gimmicky (esp with the cartwheel he did at the Benefit, I believe it was). That character was meant to be a chunky hard around the edges kinda guy, but he was funny.

Most people are screaming that this movie is sooooo great, and it really isn't. It's mediocre at best. The book is truly wonderful.",1331424000,12,5950,4.518105849582173

4306742,1,B004A8ZWVU,"*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***

I watched this movie and, for what it is worth, enjoyed it at the time. But upon further reflection, I think this movie is not very good.

There are good moments in the movie, but then there are other moments that seem jarringly unrealistic. In another movie I wouldn't care. But in a film that at its core purports to accurately depict racism in the 50's / 60's, this starts to become a big problem for me later on.

And yes, I know it is just a movie - not non-fiction. But with the amount of people touting this as an ""important"" or ""life changing"" movie, I think a bit of extra thinking is in order.

One of the problems to me is that the main characters seem very shallow. Skeeter is the plucky young writer who is willing to face injustice, no matter the cost. Hilly is the EVIL racist who is set on destroying black people's lives. There's also an airhead blonde who serves little purpose in the movie, and a few bad mothers tossed in for fun. The black maids are all portrayed pretty similarly. They are all shown as good, honest people, many of whom raise and care for the babies of bad white mothers.

Skeeter in particular seemed like a very unrealistic character. When the person who wrote the story makes the main character a writer, you know you are in for trouble. It comes off as self-indulgent as best. Mostly, it feels anachronistic. She's a liberal crusader for civil rights, and she arrived at this position how? From the maid being fired? I'm not buying it. Sure, there were some white people in Mississippi who cared about equal rights for blacks, but not many. And those who acted upon those beliefs were punished for it.

And that brings me to another problem I have with Skeeter. She never suffers the true consequences of her actions. Never gets fired. Never receives death threats. Instead, she gets rewarded. She gets a nice cushy job in New York. The end of the movie sees her abandoning her black ""friends"" in Mississippi and heading off to a nice career for herself, never to have to worry about race-related matters again.

What? You say her boyfriend dumped her for her beliefs? That was negative, right? Oh, puh-lease. That in no way compared to the kind of things that true civil rights advocates suffered. Losing a boyfriend would have been the least of her worries.

That brings me to another thing I don't like in this movie - how it portrays men. The men are either non-existent, or fools. Buffoons or worse. Mostly, they just exist as props for the women in the story, who comprise the main characters. Nothing wrong with that, but I would have preferred for the movie to at least made some attempt to not show every man in it as a blockhead.

The movie makes some attempt to avoid stereotypes and give the characters some depth, but still falls flat. I could not relate at all to most of the main characters. Maybe that's because I'm a guy, but I don't think so. It feels like weak writing.

The writing went off the rails in a lot of scenes. One that stood out to me was when all the toilets were delivered to Hilly's front yard, and she has this big over-dramatic public meltdown. First, I find it hard to believe that people would dump that many toilets without at least knocking on the door. Second, I don't see a tough character like that bawling in public at all. But both events served the author of the story in her effort to make us feel that Evil Hilly got what she deserved.

Speaking of Hilly... Bryce Dallas Howard stars, and man is she hot! God, what a babe. It's hard to believe she's related to Clint ""Have some tranya"" Howard. Dang, that guy looks like he was hit with the ugly stick. Okay, getting back on topic...

There were a lot of things in this movie that didn't make sense to me. Like the whole deal on Constantine getting fired. I didn't understand why the black daughter wouldn't just go around the back. Surely the white lady had entertained visitors before, hadn't she? And even if she hadn't, what's the big deal about being asked to go around back? And then when she does come in the front anyway, why is everyone so upset about it? It is viewed by the guests as an act of defiance, worthy of firing the black lady. To me, it just looks like a simple misunderstanding that the white lady would have easily explained and shrugged off. I'm supposed to believe that most white people back then were so racist that they never had any common sense at all? I don't know about that. The Constantine firing seems forced to me.

And then later, we are told that Constantine has died, and Skeeter just takes it. Hello? She still has a daughter, people! A family! Maybe you could try to visit? Maybe even apologize? Nah, that's too much trouble.

The movie has a lot of sentimental feel-goodisms that I didn't really care for. Like the cancerous mother who - inspired by her daughter - ""decides to live"" and suddenly becomes her own champion for social justice. Or Evil Hilly, who gets forced to eat it. Oh, and she also gets a cold sore at one point. Because that's what happens to EVIL people - cold sores!

The worst part is when it takes sentimentalism and combines it with a lack of logic in order to create a result that makes you feel good - until you wonder what you are cheering about. A good example is when the maid steals a ring and tries to pawn it. We're supposed to feel sorry for her later when the evil redneck cops arrest her. Why? Because Hilly is EVIL, so to heck with her. And the woman really, REALLY needs the money. It's for the children. Also, she just ""found"" the ring, she it's not really stealing. Um, no.

Yes, I know she stole out of desperation for her kids. And if Hilly had been caring enough or not-racist enough, she would have loaned her the $75 she needed. But wait a minute! We're supposed to hate Hilly because she won't loan the lady $75? That makes her racist? Hello, people! That's a lot of money for back then! Personally, I wouldn't even loan that much money to my brother today, let alone back then. Racism's got nothing to do with it.

One of the odd things about this movie is the very premise of it. A white woman is trying to ""help"" black women by telling their side of the story. But the only thing she ends up ""helping"" is getting herself a nice a job and getting the main black maid fired (along with countless others, probably). So by helping these women, she is actually exploiting them. Am I missing something? Or am I just blind? Why are other people seeing a virtue here where I'm not?

Let's face it. A book like The Help would never have been published, let alone become a hit. What white woman back then would have been interested in buying a book showing a black person's side of the story? The fact that the Jim Crow laws and racial segregation still existed shows that the vast majority of whites weren't too interested in what black people thought about anything.

Another thing that irked me was how Abilene was fired at the end after Skeeter abandoned her, but we are supposed to be okay with that because Abilene says she's going to become a writer. (Again with the ""Writer"" Heroines... Sheesh!) I didn't expect a happy ending. But become a writer? Yeah, right.

There's another thing worth mentioning. Many have taken to writing glowing reviews of the incredible acting of Viola Davis in this movie. That's much ado about nothing to me. She was okay. Not bad acting, but nothing outstanding either. I think people who do this are mostly white people who are trying to overcompensate and prove they don't have any internal racism by giving big props to a black actress. I mean, the woman is certainly talented and competent, but no more than anyone else in the movie.

I will say this. My 1 star review is not fair. The movie deserves more than that. But my review won't get read if I give it a higher rating, so from my self-centered viewpoint, 1 star it is. There are plenty of 5-star ratings already, so it's not like my rating is going to make a difference.

One thing I liked was seeing a few scenes from Clarksdale, Mississippi in this movie. Having been to Clarksdale many times, I thought this part was really cool.

Back to the story. The main problem I have upon watching this is I don't know what to believe. The world has changed so much from the Jim Crow era that I'm unwilling to accept the history of it wrapped in a saccharine-sweet feel-good movie. I would like to see a movie depicting the real struggles that took place, without a bunch of sentimental fluff. I want the harsh truth. Not a sugar-coated feel-good summer chick flick. Guess I'll keep looking.

I want to see the world the way it really was, if possible. Where blacks pulled themselves out of the hole through a lot of grit and determination, not the storybook movie lie where long-suffering blacks are finally ""saved"" by kindly, progressive white people. At least this movie made me think about that, and want to read more of the actual history. So that's something.",1330646400,75,9001,4.464394400486914

African Slaves were the first Blacks whom had brought to the ""New World"" in 1619 and it was just 12 years passing from settlement of James Town. They weren't aggressive, but aggression was upon them. If so poor, but human at least were they in their motherland; but apocryphal white gods forging ahead enslave them. Promising peace and piety sent them to hell where apostasy from their fathers' belief was mandatory.

Violence violence and a little more violence was their wage from working in their unwanted servitude in charge of others' malefactor. So gradually the common color of ""good"" became evil and the color of ""evil"" changed for innocence, a world full of Black and White.

As time passed the so called ""slaves"" start to ask for their human dignity and that was a totally new phase for violent response from the ""masters"". Black takes a long time to fade as their hope; they hadn't been giving up and reach to what they struggle for, as once Martin Luther King Jr. said: ""Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last""

Introduction

Various dissatisfactions may result in protests in a community or a society. Religious, economical, societal and political concerns are amongst the most important factors which provoke different groups and classes to counter act against the status quo. In most of the time such displeasures end in some political gained grants, trivial or general reformations in current law and mechanism and compromise and returning to pre-challenge era. But in some occasions the depth and level of discontent is in its extreme thus the protestors are looking for a fundamental reformation or in other words revolution and subversion. Overthrow can be done by civilians or servicemen, in societal level such a protest is known as a movement. In deed, social movements are acts and processes in which some (most of time minorities but certainly not always) seek their own wills.

From one aspect movements can be divided to violent and nonviolent. Many of social movements are peaceful at start, but different events may lead them to violence; and off course in some cases their first intended shifts to a major one and may be revolution. Reading history since 19th century shows that such procedures in China, Russia, France, Czechoslovakia, Iran and etc had been caused to revolution and regime change.

In China peasants were against high tax which they were obliged to pay to Emperor, but the mismanagement and not tolerating of their claim, led to emerging of Marxist beliefs and Chinese masses movement led by Mao Tse-tung who was a communist teacher. Some campaigns caused to ousting the last emperor of the Qing dynasty and establishing the People's Republic of China.

In Russia the workers were against their low wages, but the Emperor's police violently killed 5 of them, and that was the beginning of toppling Romanov's Empire. 1917 February was the time to say good bye to Kremlin, just in 8 months form then the first communist government announced by Bolsheviks led by Lenin.

In France people had some criticisms on Empire, but neglecting their demands and treating with them brutality, expanding the bourgeoisie in state convince the people for democracy rather than dictatorship. If so this regime change took a 10 year struggle but at last people got what they want.

In Czechoslovakia as well harsh communist environment, encouraged people for a Reform, which off course soon changed to a movement for Velvet Revolution (which was coin thereafter for revolutions with reformative apparatuses). That was the beginning of so called Color Revolutions, nonviolent regime changes in ex-soviet states.

In Iran off course the main demand was on religion rather than economy, but people chose to have theological based democracy rather than living under Pahlavi's dictatorship. So they decide to change and thus drove out the 2500 years kingdom in Iran and replaced a democratic Republic government.

As it's obvious form previous lines most of social movements which had been enlarged to a national extend changed to a revolutionary movements, but in America there is an exceptional case.

Social movements in America which had been known from 1960s have a longer history; it dates back to the first days of American Revolution. Since then various and different actions, rebellions and movements flourished and diminished. Each of these events had led to a reform even a minor one.

So interesting it is that despite of numerous opponent beliefs and opinions none of them were looked for revolution. All Americans believe in America as a benevolent Empire, which have been bestowed them their rights and may be it can be called ""democratic empire"", which is a self contrary term as Empire and Republic are binary opposites.

Blacks' movement in 1960s in spite of all Ku Klux Klan violent actions against them was nonviolently supporters of America as well. Off course in a short period Black Power shifted to violence under leadership of intellectuals like Malcolm X, but still was supporter and fan of America.

Women', Students' and Indians' movements have been supporters of America too. This is the exceptional identity of American social movements which despite of all different heterogeneous bona fide beliefs the overall activists are unanimously supporters of status quo and by that I mean America.

Entering of Blacks into the American Scene

""Violence is as American as cherry pie.""

H. Rap Brown (1943 - )

Africans entered into the ""West Indies"" a short after Europeans did. At first they weren't ""slaves"" but servants whom could buy their freedom; but as days were gone more need for worker was felt, thus the servants enslaved and that's all. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, an estimated total of 12 million Africans were forcibly transported to the Americas.

Slavery

The new discovered land seemed to be a ""promised land"" full of fertile lands, but much land were there, fewer men were present. Whites started to bring Blacks to there, primarily with consent and kindness and step by step interchanged their manner to kidnapping. Blacks were to be farmers or farmhands, but became indentured servants whom were enlisted to be free for more than 3 centuries.

Southern colonies was a paradise of cotton and West Indies Company as well as its eastern half was responsible for preparing demanded cotton for English textile companies. It's obvious that anybody is looking for cheaper production and so more benefit. They put at work the new black comers, low wage and high gage servants who could made money far more than their own cost.

Slavery is obscure in American Constitution, if so some hints verify it within. The Founding Fathers with no exception were slave holders. They established laws to have blacks as their property, and an obligation to send back ""runaways"" to their masters. Huge and vast lands really required man power to be cultivated.

Too many discourses and dialogues were common about the inimical nature of this phenomenon but it was commonly widespread in southern states. But Eli Whitney invented a machine for prolonging the debate on abolitionism.

If so Missouri Compromise succeeded to some extend in banning of slavery extension but it was an ignition for the American Civil Wars. 450,000 to 483,000 casualties -save economical and emotional losses- is just the Human cost of this simple statement: to have or not to have slaves, that's the question. From 1861 to 1865 Americans ""spoke daggers"" to each other to understood whether they should remain masters or simply became neighbors.

Abolitionism

The keystones of anti slavery dates back to 1783 but the organized steps towards it began years after it. Under the leadership of William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson, anti slavery campaigners succeeded in getting the slave trade to the British colonies abolished in 1807. The United States prohibited the importation of slaves that same year, though widespread smuggling continued until about 1862.

""Liberator"" read and asked for emancipation and liberation of slaves from the starting hours of 1831 frankly, if so it took 32 years for this claim to be verified. Torture was what had been done upon poor slaves, thus those religious orthodox men whom were unable to have slaves financially or there was no need for black work in their occupation echoed for ""abolitionism"".

William Lloyd Garrison was one who believed in nonviolent and peaceful campaign against slavery. As the founder of the American Anti-Slavery Society (1833-70) he let the runaways Frederick Douglas and William Wells Brown to state their wishes to Northerners in his publication (North Star). But lucky he was as Elijah P. Lovejoy another American newspaper editor martyred in Alton, Illinois in defense of his right to print antislavery material in 1837.

Furthermore Whites also raided to post offices and burnt all anti-slavery stuffs; the post director refused to accept the anti-slavery materials and congress ignored to mention the issue as well.

Underground Railroad

Fugitive slave law of 1850 which asserted for sending back the runaways from the state to state in addition of a new opportunity for white jobless called ""slave catcher"" was another violent measure facing the blacks.

As a counter measure, Blacks developed a system called ""Underground Railroad"" or ""Underground Railway"" for transferring enslaved blacks to northern states and Canada to nonviolently free them.

Using disguise and darkness 40,000 to 100,000 blacks liberated from white tyranny and of course not ""white supremacy"". Liberty Line introduced from 1830 was a brilliant hope for black peace sojourners, although it granted them Compromise of 1850 and Emancipation Proclamation (1863) by slave-holder Lincoln, which freed all slaves in the United States by the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865. but violent Civil War had begun in 1861.

Not being too late must another case be mentioned; Dred Scott a slave who sued for liberty after living in a non-slave state; caused the Supreme Court to declare the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional! A national compromise violently broke simply to not grant a black his liberty.

Civil War

Emancipation Proclamation was meant that the blacks as freedmen! could (must) attend the Union Army and defend of other freemen (whites). United States Colored Troops was established involved of 178,000 blacks.

Out-Migrate vs. In-Migrate

While for decades blacks for violently brought to Americas for servitude, after emancipation in fear of Blacks' retaliation whites thought to send back them to Africa.

Liberia

From 1817 a program called American Colonization Society emerged in Washington D.C with supports of local branches, churches, and the legislatures of Border States to transport freed and free-born blacks to Africa. The program was headed by Henry Clay and Francis Scott Key whom were from prominent slave holders. They bought a land on the western coast of Africa now called Liberia. Once forcibly in-migrated blacks then ""peacefully"" became out-migrated by whites and gained their freedom!

Discrimination

Although, if so in lip service blacks had been freed, but it was not encompassed the social rights such as right to vote and education. They were freed to be killed for defending of whites.

It took a long more time to these rights found legitimacy. By the 15th amendment of American Constitution, Section 1, that reads: ""The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude."" in 1870 Blacks found suffrage at last.

But another odd occurrence took place, for the 1st time since and then the American President impeached, Andrew Johnson (1808-1875), 17th president of the United States (1865-1869) impeached accused of ""violation of the Tenure of Office Act and the `command of the army' provisions of the Army Appropriations"" and also another one which conveys that Johnson had attempted to undermine Congress. Save what aforesaid Johnson was pro-blacks and support them, so simply and violently he removed.

Jim Crow

The last quarter of 19th century was the time for another plot against Blacks. Jim Crow laws were discriminational written and un-written codes to prevent Black form accessing to public services like: parks, restaurants, hotels and etc. furthermore, Black veterans weren't in an equal status as whites were. ""Persons of color"" weren't called ""negroes"" but no inequality against them was common. This traditional violence against Blacks went further as a new club called Ku Klaus Klan emerged.

Ku Klux Klan

Post American Civil War a secret society of white Southerners in the United States was formed to resist the emancipation of slaves; they used terrorist tactics to suppress Black people. In fact they were White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASP) whom believed America belongs to whom are 100% American. They were against immigrants whether in terms of ethnicity or religion but their major animosity was for poor Blacks. There were two in the United States, one founded immediately after the Civil War and lasting until the 1870s, the other beginning in 1915 and continuing to the present and still act violently against Blacks.

However, there were acts like Force Act in 1870 and the Ku Klux Act in 1871 which authorized the president to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, suppress disturbances by force, and impose heavy penalties upon terrorist organizations; but ""white violence"" could not tolerate it and in United States v. Harris in 1882, the Supreme Court declared the Ku Klux Act unconstitutional.

W.E.B Dubois

""Men of America, the problem is plain before you. Here is a race transplanted through the criminal foolishness of your fathers. Whether you like it or not the millions are here, and here they will remain. If you do not lift them up, they will pull you down.""
W. E. B. DuBois

William Edward Burghardt DuBois was the United States civil rights leader and political activist who campaigned for equality for Black Americans, he was the first Afro-American received PhD degree. He was one of founders of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and it was synchronous with Harlem Renaissance. This was a time for blacks to fight against white's violence literarily. Of course, some black intellectuals were predecessors to them like Harriet Beecher Stowe with her ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"". Authors like Langston Hughes (belongs to Lost Generation) draw a vivid vision of Blacks' situation in America; as he versifies:

I'm nobody, who are you?

Are you nobody too?

Then, there is a pair of us

Don't tell you know

They'll banish us

How already to be somebody?

Say your name all day long

Like a frog in the bog.

W.E.B. DuBois's doctoral dissertation was The Suppression of the African Slave-Trade to the United States of America, 1638-1870. As the editor of The Crisis, he encouraged the development of black literature and art and urged his readers to see ""Beauty in Black."" In deed he and his contemporaries were the literate nonviolent campaigners against white's violence.

Elijah Muhammad and Nation of Islam

""The Negro wants to be everything but himself...He wants to integrate with the white man, but he cannot integrate with himself or with his own kind. The Negro wants to lose his identity because he does not know his own identity.""
Elijah Muhammad
Elijah Poole converted to Islam as Elijah Muhammad was founder and leader of the black separatist religious movement known as the Nation of Islam (sometimes called Black Muslims) in the United States. He was famous for his rhetoric directed at white people, whom he called ""blue-eyed devils."" He challenged white's violence by articulating Islam rulings in Black Americans context and promoted racial unity and self-help and maintained a strict code of discipline among members. During World War II he asked his followers not to attend military service and serve for white's devil whimsical desire. He was jailed for his thoughts and speeches, but being imprisoned he was challenging with white's violence and try to find others to convert them to Islam and enter them to the Nation of Islam. Malcolm X was one of them.

Malcolm X and Black Power

""There is nothing in our book, The Koran, that teaches us to suffer peacefully. Our religion teaches us to be intelligent. Be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone, but, if someone puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery. That's a good religion.""
Malcolm X

Malcolm Little well known as Malcolm X was a black militant leader who articulated concepts of race pride and Black Nationalism in the early 1960s. Primarily he was not a Muslim, but he converted to Islam and became a minister of the Nation of Islam movement being familiar with Elijah Muhammad. He was an exception in this narrative as he believed in violence rather than violence, in deed it's his belief: ""I'm nonviolent with those who are nonviolent with me."" Whites were violent to him so he was to them as well. This is was the bone of a little contention between him and MLK.

Back Power who were movement formed by American blacks to produce social equality and equal rights and emphasize racial pride; and Black Panthers who were radical underground African American organization that was founded by Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale in the mid-1960s and advocated violence to attain liberation and equality for African Americans were largely influenced by his opinions. They were standing for violent campaign in facing of white's violence and mostly Ku Klux Klan. For this belief he sentenced years of his life in prison and actually there he met Elijah Muhammad.

However, after he came back from Hajj pilgrimage and rename himself as el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz, chose a more nonviolent way in his struggle against white's violence. That's why he was assassinated in 1965 by some which there is belief they were Blacks related to Nation of Islam!

Thurgood Marshall and Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka

""The United States has been called the melting pot of the world. But it seems to me that the colored man either missed getting into the pot or he got melted down.""

Thurgood Marshall

Thurgood Marshall was the first black member of the U.S. Supreme Court. As an attorney he successfully argued before the U.S. Supreme Court the case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954), in which racial segregation in American public schools was declared unconstitutional. He's prominent in advancing anti discriminational laws in US judiciary system. His legacy up to now is what Black community benefits form. Before his legacy white's violence even militarily prevented Black students to entering White's school, after it they become motley.

Martin Luther King Jr. and Civil Rights Movements

""Today the choice is no longer between violence and nonviolence.

It is either nonviolence or nonexistence.""

MLK

The most famous figure in American Black Community is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. doubtless. He is an American emblem of Nonviolence. King's nonviolent doctrine was strongly influenced by the teachings of Indian leader Mohandas Gandhi. Unlike the great majority of civil rights activists who have regarded nonviolence as a convenient tactic. King followed Gandhi's principles of pacifism. In King's view, civil rights demonstrators, who were beaten and jailed by hostile whites, through the redemptive character of their unmerited suffering educated and transformed their oppressors. King set about organizing the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), which gave him a base of operation throughout the South, as well as a national platform from which to speak

The Montgomery bus boycott started on December 1, 1955, when Rosa Parks, an African American woman, refused to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger, and as a consequence was arrested for violating the city's segregation law. It was an ignition for chain of nonviolent protests against segregation and racial discrimination. Sit-Ins in Nashville under leadership of James Lawson, nonviolent demonstrations and public speech were usual tactics rendered by Blacks (mostly students) to confront Whites brutality and violence.

King joined other civil rights leaders in organizing the historic March on Washington. On August 28, 1963, an interracial assembly of more than 200,000 gathered peaceably in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial to demand equal justice for all citizens under the law. It led to Civil Rights Act in coming year.

But these accomplishments were not as easy as ABC; once MLK had said: ""I'm frankly tired of marching. I'm tired of going to jail,"" for every minute reason he had been sued by whites. In 1968 days before living for Memphis he'd asserted: ""Living every day under the threat of death, I feel discouraged every now and then and feel my work's in vain, but then the Holy Spirit revives my soul again."" He was accurate, on April 4, 1968 he was shot in a Balcony of a hotel in Memphis by a violent white some like to call him James Earl Ray. He sentenced for a century a year after but even Dr. King's family doesn't believe in him as the assassinator.

If so King chose nonviolence and not nonexistence; but ""White violence"" chose nonexistence for him, even by announcing his birthday as a holyday.

Louise Farrakhan

After Muhammad's death in 1975 another group, retaining both the name and the founding principles of Elijah Muhammad's original Nation of Islam, was established under the leadership of Louis Eugene Wolcott converted to Islam with a new name Louis Farrakhan. He was leader of the New York Temple and the Nation' most prominent spokesman at the time of Elijah Muhammad' death. Although given a national post by Mohammed, Farrakhan disagreed with Mohammed' changes, and in 1978 he left to found a third Nation of Islam.

By the 1990s he had emerged as a prominent African American leader, as demonstrated by the success in 1995 of the Million Man March in Washington, D.C., which he helped to organize. In 1995 Qubilah Shabazz daughter of Malcolm X was accused of plot to assassinate him, but he didn't sue the case. Farrakhan toned down his racial rhetoric and moved the group toward orthodox Islam after a bout with prostate cancer in 2000.

COINTELPRO

During the 1950s and '60s, the bureau used covert means to disrupt the activities of groups it considered subversive and to discredit their leaders; the operations, known as COINTELPRO (counterintelligence programs), were officially discontinued in 1971.

John Edgar Hoover, ex FBI director who was 48 years at office, clarifies the mission of COINTELPRO against nationalist blacks as below:

a. preventing form emergence of a new leader who can unify Blacks.

b. preventing from violence directed by Black nationalist groups

c. preventing from popularizing of Black Nationalist groups and their leaders

d. preventing from rapid growth of Black Nationalist Organizations especially among youth.

e. targets of these operation were: Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad and ... .

Hoover also ordered aggressive surveillance of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., and tried to discredit King by disseminating derogatory information about him to the media, Congress, and others.

Conclusion

It's 2008, to a high extend Blacks and Whites have been melted, even a Black man have nominated himself for American Presidency; but still there is Ku Klux Klan (if so, underground); WASPs are still the superiors amongst nation; guys show ""noose"" to their Black friends and foes even jokingly and white's violence is still common.

Individualism is a white phenomenon in American mind as volunteerism is; in fact as George Orwell says in Animal Farm: ""all are equal but some are more equal"" and this is the true meaning of egalitarianism and Human Rights in the States. America is a melting pot, but blacks never considered as edible and thus prevented to enter the pot.

4306747,5,B004A8ZWVU,"The Help depicts the disgraceful, bigoted way in which African-Americans were treated in the deep South in the early 1960s. The film is artistic with great dialogue and sets; but it pulls no punches about the evils of prejudice as most white people in Jackson, Mississippi degrade their ""help"" (maids they hire for peanuts) while showing that the ""help"" need to be careful just to survive--one maid's cousin's car was set on fire just because he wanted to vote! The film could have been edited very slightly (maybe 5 minutes) to make it a bit tighter; but this is minor. Honestly, the entire film captivated me; and near the end there were 1 or 2 times my eyes welled up with tears--and that's saying a lot because I almost never cry!

Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan (Emma Stone) returns to Jackson, Mississippi after graduating from ""Old Miss."" Skeeter aspires to be a writer and quickly gets a job writing a housekeeping column at a local newspaper. However, Skeeter doesn't know much about housework--her parents had their maid too, Constantine (Cicely Tyson), who raised Skeeter while Skeeter's mother (Allison Janney) had herself a good time with ""the girls."" Skeeter also wants to know why Constantine left while she was away; she doesn't believe her parents' explanation.

Then come the white women in town who want maids to feel superior--and not to ever worry, not even when their own child is crying for comfort right in front of them. One of the very worst bigots is Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard); she treats her maid Minnie (Octavia Spencer) incredibly poorly and this could cause tension--Minnie herself has a temper. Hilly wants an ""initiative"" to make the ""colored help"" use separate bathrooms outside the house so white people don't  ""catch their diseases."" There is another wonderful portrayal of a maid, Aibileen (Viola Davis), who raised 17 white children while their mothers essentially ignored them!

Skeeter now wants to write a book about the lives of the maids; but they are terrified--this could even get them killed. Skeeter changes names for anonymity and Aibileen eventually agrees to let Skeeter interview her--then Minnie agrees. But after Medgar Evers is brutally murdered in Jackson, more maids want to tell their stories of dehumanization so Skeeter can get her anonymous book published by a New York City company.

There's even more. We don't know until the end why Constantine left Skeeter's family; and we see consequences when Minnie serves homemade ""chocolate pie"" to Hilly. There's also the (allegedly) ""white trash"" outcast in town, Celia (Jessica Chastain), who might hire Minnie because of politics. We see who keeps their job as a maid and who doesn't. There's also Skeeter and her first boyfriend--will they become a loving couple? Moreover, look for a fine performance by Sissy Spacek.

As for extras, I particularly liked the deleted scenes and we get a music video by Mary J. Blige.

The Help succeeds at portraying the incredible chasm between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" in the deep South at a time when simply being African-American could be quite dangerous. Fans of the actors will certainly want this; people studying the civil rights movement should also get this film.",1330560000,,3227,5.031835205992509

4306750,5,B004A8ZWVU,It is rare I actually see a movie before the Oscars are  presented.  The Help was the exception with 'thanks' to Amazon for having the DVD available with such great timing.

4306752,1,B004A8ZWVU,"I had avoided both the book, and then the movie version of THE HELP as it appeared to be yet another entry to the Driving Miss Daisy genre of feel good, simplistic examinations of topics that in truth are not easy, simple and if there is a good feeling - well, it came after a great deal of suffering, death & pain.  I finally gave in tonight and watched the movie.  I hissed at the oh so evil character very well-played by Bryce Dallas Howard.  In fact, I'll take my hat off to her for  giving some depth to what could have been a cartoon.  She plays her as a sad person - which makes the harsh lines delivered to her in the denouement seem real - despite the fact that no African American maid in the 1960s would have EVER spoken such words.  In the world of The Help - the biggest threat to the African American community is the idiocy, bitchiness or callousness of the hoity-toity ""well-bred"" white women.  This threat is swept away in a glistening fantasy of moxie that can rid The South of such pesky, foolish ladies.  This is because The Help teaches us that the combination of minority-underdog gumption and big-hearted white people trumps the ""backwards"" ways of those callow racists.  Unfortunately, The Help teaches us one thing, and history teaches us another.  Mississippi still holds segregated proms.  And, back in the 1960s, showing such ""gumption"" could easily result in death.  The worst The South had to offer its maids was much worse than the petty insults foisted upon them by narrow-minded bosses or by having to use a (yegads!) different toilet in the house.  While it makes me feel good to think those suffering ladies were surrounded in the cozy embrace of the daffy, loving White Trash bimbo who cleaves to her maid like a long lost sister, or the noble, curly-wigged liberal who risks not being popular or married so that she might bring equality to The South or that racist mothers dying of cancer both beat cancer AND become enlightened in a single moment --- well, I can't believe it once the movie stops playing.  In fact, what tasted like a chocolate pie while I was watching the film, tastes like Minnie's ""special"" pie once the movie is done.  Let's be frank.  This book is fluff.  This movie is fluff.  We all like easy entertainment.  We like to curse our villains and root for our heroes and we all want a happy ending.  However, I think it's problematic when the ingredients for this confection are portions of history that are anything but sweet.  You can't write a feel-good tale of female-bonding between do-good white women and their African American maids.  You can't have your cake and eat it it too.  The book is a lie.  The movie is a lie.  The solace I have, as I reflect on The Help, is that there WERE brave, noble, white people who wanted to bring equality to The South:  Andrew Goodman & Michael Schwerner.  They didn't end up at big job in NYC.  They ended up dead.",1330387200,27,2917,4.525812619502868

4306754,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I will not go into detail and give anything away, but this film was unusually heartfelt, not because it so well told a story, but because it told a story that, in my opinion, has not been told enough or thought about sufficiently.  The story, to simplify, is that man does not appreciate others to the extent he should and is much weaker for it.  Man's strength comes from the appreciation and love of others, particularly if those others derive their strength from a source that is generally not appreciated as a source, but as a weakness they feel exists within themselves that can become a strength when harnessed to a will to tell the truth, even when one doubts the courage to be able to do so.  I can only ask you to view this film to be able to understand my review that may not be as clear as I would like.  Other films have been made that are similar, but to the best of my knowledge, few have delivered the story and the message as well as ""The Help"".  You would have to be one cold hearted SOB (which I may approach) not to appreciate the telling of this story.  I would urge you to view it because it so well addresses a problem that still exists in our society with intelligence and humanity that is rare and fruitful beyond what we often have the opportunity to experience.

As a transplant from Pennsylvania and my wife from the Netherlands before that, our kids were born and raised in Tennessee.  Because of some of the cultural differences that exist and even strengthen our family, I will make sure we view this film together for the purpose of one of our frequent family dinner table discussions which now include a son-in-law and daughter-in-law, the goal of which is for us to check our thoughts and their alignment with our beliefs and actions.  This is an exercise we started many years ago because it makes for good dinner conversation, particularly when our kids were much younger, but it also helps teach how to have a difference of opinion without insulting and maintaining respect for one another.  But, what is important with this film is its history of race relations that my kids did not live through when violence was the method of resolving differences and hate was the prevalent emotion.  The Help is an excellent film that lends itself to family discussion what those in our family believe are important principles that we want to hold dear even though we are not perfect in out execution.

Even though I was not familiar with any of the actors, the acting in The Help is very good because it is simply believable with none of the parts being the victim of over acting and exaggeration.  I felt that these were real people being filmed in a real story.  It also seemed as if I got to know and accept the parts played as real people with real problems.  I also could not detect any deviation from the time period even though the video depiction of the age added important realism to the story.

I had heard on the news today that The Help might be up for an academy award but I did not hear for what categories it was being considered.  I believe the film should be seriously considered for best picture.  I have this opinion because the film was so well assembled, with an equal level of good acting, a great screenplay and story, etc,etc.  There were just too many good things in this movie for any to stand out except for best picture.  When I finish this review in a few minutes I will go and check the results and probably learn how wrong I was.  But then I will never understand how those people making so much money must also have the adoration of their fans and the ""Academy"".  When most other professions have to live with love or money, actors must have both.  I guess that's OK if they continue to make movies like ""The Help"".",1330300800,,3772,4.44267053701016
4306755,1,B004A8ZWVU,"The Help is an affront to anyone who actually knows or knew black maids from that time.  There is nothing positive about the two primary maids played by Ms. Davis and Ms. Spencer what with their ""I is kind,"" and ""Frying chicken makes me feel like all is right with the world,"" shucking and jiving.  This is essentially a film that was based on a book (which stole the basic facts of black people's lives without interviewing them or paying them, so isn't the author a champion of racial manipulation and keeping blacks in their places) a horrible story about the greatness of the white woman who tells the story and gets to move to New York to be  big time writer, while the character portrayed by Ms. Davis (who I held in high esteem until this garbage) gets the joy of being a fired, middle-aged black maid who in real life would most likely never work again who would wind up destitute.  As for Ms. Spencer, when she uttered her fried chicken line, I wanted to get up, reach through my television, and smack her upside her head.  I don't know what the purpose of this story was, but it most certainly was not to provide insight into the struggles of black maids or the civil rights movement because it stands as an embarrassment to both.

4306760,4,B004A8ZWVU,"Based on the best seller by Kathryn Stockett and adapted and directed by her childhood friend Tate Taylor, The Help is a personal film that is affecting in its depiction of social injustice in the treatment of black females who served as nannies and maids in the Old South during the turbulent 1960's. As an ensemble piece, it features a host of memorable, Oscar caliber performances.

A black female, Aibileen (Viola Davis), in Jackson, Mississippi, during the 1960's relates a story of life during that period where white families relied on black housekeepers to cook, clean and even raise their white children. These housekeepers in effect became second mothers to these children and did so for generations.  Aibileen works in one such household, as does her combative friend, Minny (Octavia Spencer), who works for the stern Hilly (grandly played for nastiness by Bryce Dallas Howard).  Fresh from college, Skeeter (Emma Stone) has a reunion of sorts with her old friends (including Hilly) from the community.  Absent is the local outcast, Celia (Jessica Chastain), who is shunned by the group.  Dreaming of being a writer, Skeeter has been curious about the life of these house servants and the injustices and humiliating treatment they must face that border on outright racism that has been passed down from family to family.  Even as a child, Skeeter has fond memories of her own housekeeper Constantine (Cicely Tyson) who left one day under mysterious circumstances.  Encouraged by her publisher, she decides to write a book based on the experiences of these servants.  Under the fear of being discovered and fired (or worse), one by one these black women come forth to tell their stories.  When civil rights activist, Medgar Evers, is murdered, it creates a firestorm of violence as these women risk everything to get the truth in print, and the results will forever alter their lives.

As a chronicle of a lesser known civil rights issue and injustice, this film offers some interesting insights into a modern form discrimination.  While most of the white community is portrayed as villains and almost caricatures, perhaps that's just the point: that such a backwards culture existed not that long ago.  There are a number of subplots including the attempts to set up Skeeter on a blind date and Celia's awkward attempts hide her domestic inadequacies from her husband by hiring a maid.  Then there is the fate of Skeeter's Constantine that is heartbreaking.

As much as the acting is superior across the board, the film does not quite work as a whole as well as one would hope.  The narrative seems a bit uneven so things don't flow smoothly from scene to scene.  It's the only thing that keeps the film from being even better than it is.  In a way the parts or scenes are better than the whole, and many of those scenes are quite good and authentic.  Despite its serious subject, the film does have its humorous moments especially in the infamous confrontation between Minny and Hilly where justice is served!  It is the highlight of the film.

There are any number of performances that shine particularly Davis (a standout), Spencer, Howard, Chastain, and Stone.  Even Sissy Spacek has a witty, offbeat role as an elderly mom at odds with her daughter Hilly.  But it's the film's moments that will stay with you; they buoy The Help into our hearts.",1330041600,,3361,4.901060070671378

This movie really hit home with me because I was raised in the south during the time the movie was set. Unlike the white characters presented, we were not wealthy so my experience was somewhat different. There are several instances of disturbing racism in this movie, but I see them as important to use as a yardstick to measure just how far we have come in a relatively short time. I know there is room for improvement and this movie makes you want to try harder. Great casting, very believable characters and dialog!",1330041600,,623,4.473684210526316

4306763,3,B004A8ZWVU,"Overall, a good movie, that had moments of greatness.
This movie is based on a book. I have not read the book so I can only speak to what ended up on the screen.
The story follows two women, in a small town in Mississippi, who live on opposite sides of the tracks.  One woman is a maid and has lost her inner fire, and the other woman is trying to find herself despite the social restrictions and pressures of who she's ""supposed to be"".  Both women end up working together, writing a book about the lives of ""The Help"" in their small town, a behind the scenes look at the lives of poor black women in Mississippi.
There were some absolutely great moments in this movie, some that broke your heart or even made you laugh outloud.  However, they were not as frequent as they should have been, in my opinion.  And that tells me, areas of the story were lacking. Also, I did not believe the character development of the maid was as good as it should have been.  The idea for the movie, was fantastic, but the idea needed a little more work in the writing and development department.
Sometimes a good movie gets a lot of attention, partially because it's so unusual (the story) and the timing of when it came out (nothing else like it).  While that may be true, it still doesn't make it a great movie.
I would buy this movie for my collection.",1330041600,,1339,4.314741035856573

4306778,2,B004A8ZWVU,"We get either another Tyler Perry movie about the angst of affluent black women, the ""feeling good about feeling bad"" melodrama, or this Lifetime Channel mendacity. Here we have a story about a white female who feels ""guilty"" about being part of a society that degrades blacks, and as atonement she decides that the black maid isn't so far beneath her station to converse with in normal human terms. Eventually this is a story of white empowerment over guilt, a moral victory over ignorance. But the black people are still black, and there is the consolation of knowing that if the social pressure gets too hot, you are still white, and you abandon your pretenses, and all will be well again. But the guilt of belonging to a racist society is gone, because despite the fact that you have the good fortune of living in a world of white ""privilege,"" within the confines of your mind you have satisfied yourself that you do not personally hate. But you've done nothing to change the wider culture that maintains your status, nor do you wish to.

The problem with this particular film is that guilt cannot be washed away simply on personal whim; the ugly truth remains. In the mid 1960s, James Baldwin wrote an essay about white ""guilt"" and history. ""The guilt remains, more deeply rooted, more securely lodged, than the oldest of old trees; and it can be unutterably exhausting to deal with people who, with a really dazzling ingenuity, a tireless agility, are perpetually defending themselves against charges which one has not made. One does not have to make them. The record is there for all to read. It resounds all over the world. It might as well be written in the sky. One wishes that Americans, white Americans, would read, for their own sakes, this record, and stop defending themselves against it. Only then will they be enabled to change their lives. The fact that Americans, white Americans, have not yet been able to do this- to face their history, to change their lives-hideously menaces this country. Indeed, it menaces the entire world."" In other words, those who forget history are bound to repeat it. And deeds speak louder than words.

People will say that the world has changed, and to a certain extent it has. White America accepts blacks insofar as they can entertain them, like the gladiators of ancient Rome who were nevertheless tied to a subservient social strata. We even have a black president, who serves as a ""beacon"" for American tolerance--but nevertheless is a figure viewed with suspicion and fear by many, kept on a leash so that he will not change the culture of white privilege. That is one picture; another picture is that white women, like the protagonist in this film, have the lowest unemployment rates and the highest college enrollment, while black men have the highest unemployment rates (probably double the ""official"" rate), and there are more black men in jail than in college. We may ""debate"" the reasons for this, but there is no mistaking that it has come to be ""accepted."" Heck, even Oprah accepts it, even rejoices in it; she still doesn't realize that white people still have their hands on all the levers (just look at her audience).

Anyone who thinks that this film (let alone the book)is representative the ""progress"" that we've made is deluding themselves. We've hardly moved from that place; the dogs and fire hoses are gone, but the mindset and what is set before our eyes remains.

4306783,3,B004A8ZWVU,"First, let me say that the performances are outstanding.  I was impressed across the board, but if Octavia Spencer doesn't win the Academy Award, let there be pitchforks outside the Kodak Theatre!

Now, for what I didn't like:  it's yet ANOTHER story about how a white person saved the day for a group of oppressed black people.  I appreciate the context of the times, etc., but I hate that the story had the maids empowered by a white teenager.  Skeeter may be merely the vehicle used to tell the story of what it was like for domestic workers in those times, but I think it's demoralizing for young black people today to be exposed over and over again to the concept that without white intervention, black has no hope.  Another example would the ""The Blind Side.""  It's a great movie with great performances, and despite that it's a true story, it fosters that notion that a white person is needed for a black person's success and that black people don't take care of their own.

I work for a public housing agency and each day I see people struggling to grasp hope.  So many big movies either deny this or reinforce it.

So, for the performances, I say ""GREAT film.""  For the plot, I say ""Hollywood, do more black success stories, with those successes due to the efforts of the people themselves.""",1329264000,4,1300,4.560344827586207

4306786,5,B004A8ZWVU,"New college grad Skeeter Phelan comes home to Jackson, bent on starting a career as a writer. Her friends welcome her back, but Skeeter's changed in ways that they have not.  For one thing, Mississippi in the 1960's was a hotbed of racial segregation, and Skeeter's no longer comfortable with that. Her first summer home, she observes the way her friends (mis)treat their black maids, and, gradually, convinces some of the maids to talk to her about their lives, about which Skeeter knows very little. Soon, she has a publisher interested in compiling those interviews into a book.

The Help is written and directed by Tate Taylor, who elicited fine performances from his primarily female cast. Viola Davis, as the maid Aibilene, is the lynchpin that holds the story together, showing depths of carefully modulated  dignity, strength, and emotion in her dealings with employers and friends alike. The other standout is Jessica Chastain,  who plays the  white trash bombshell who snagged the town's most eligible bachelor and is shunned by everyone but Skeeter. Her ability to project vulnerability and honesty without pathos is awesome. Bryce Dallas Howard, in the thankless role of beautiful, dyed-in-the-wool racist and social leader Hilly,  personifies the ugliness of the racial situation with aplomb. Emma Stone represents those looked their consciences square in the face and took up the banner in the civil rights movement, and as Skeeter, shows how much courage was necessary in that dangerous environment.

The Help  has taken a lot of critical flak from folks who have an ax to grind about how it presents the issue of segregation. But, first and foremost, The Help is a movie, based upon a novel,  not a sociological treatise. It's intelligent, thought provoking entertainment.  It shows how things were, and in many cases, still are, and if it brings awareness to the minds of people who weren't yet born during the 60's, it's done its job.

4306788,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I have put off watching this movie up until last night.  After all the Oscar and Academy Award buzz, I decided to finally make the time to watch it.  This movie is very raw, captivating, honest, heart-wrenching, and irritating.  It's irritating because you want to reach out and strangle Miss Hilly and the rest of her simple minded guppy friends.  This film/novel stirs up emotions from the viewers and I very much enjoyed feeling each emotion.

The passive-aggressive racism in this film is something that everyone should watch and feel ashamed and humbled.  As a minority race, I do not feel like society has evolved much more from what is exemplified in this film.  No, there aren't shootings and public outbursts of racism (as much) but honestly, the hate is still here.  You might disagree but if you are not a minority then you are in no place to disagree, sorry.

Emma Stone is a talent to watch out for.  She is so real and so entertaining to watch.  She is not like a Blake Lively or Mila Kunis.  For some reason, I feel that she is going to be the Cate Blanchett of her generation.  Classy.  Extraordinary in every role.

As for Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, wow.  These are relatively unknown actresses that made me both laugh and tear up.  I hope Ms. Viola gets properly recognized for her performance this year.

Bryce Dallas Howard is great as well even though I hated her character.  I swelled with gratitude while watching the last scene she was in.  She got put in her place and was visibly shaken- AWESOME and DESERVED.

Great film.  I'm disappointed that I didn't read the book first.  Lately, I've been finding movies very ordinary and very boring.  This one has cured my entertainment drought.

4306789,4,B004A8ZWVU,"I am an avid believer in the 90 minute movie. More than that and I can always pick out areas that could have been edited down (or out). With The Help I can't say that anything could or should be edited out--it really was that good.

I was hesitant to watch this movie due to its length (146 minutes!) so I waited a while before I made the commitment. I'm glad that I didn't see it in the theater and I'm glad I finally did see it (at home, where I could make breaks).

The story ranged from funny to horrifying and in the end good conquered evil. It really makes you sit back and reflect on how far we have come -- and yet in many ways, still not far enough. If you are interested in Civil Rights era history, social justice and feminism then this is a movie you'll enjoy.

I've never read the book so I can't comment on how closely it sticks to it, but I didn't feel as if any question were left unanswered or that any parts of the story weren't matching up.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 was due to length. I made it through but I can imagine that someone who isn't as interested in the historical time period and with little patience might not enjoy it as much as I did.",1329091200,,1192,4.038135593220339
4306790,3,B004A8ZWVU,"Considering all the praise that's been heaped upon it--not to mention Oscar nominations and other awards--""The Help"" left me feeling rather ambivalent. Yes, it features some ""very important"" themes and it begs to be called a ""movie about issues"" (namely, racism and women's rights). And yes, the actors deliver fine performances--Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Jessica Chastain, Emma Stone, and Allison Janney are outstanding, as is Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays the delightfully detestable antagonist (probably the best role of her career--certainly better than anything she did in that ""Twilight: Eclipse"" nonsense). But something about this film just lay flat. The moments that were meant to stir up emotions failed to do so, the plot just kind of meandered with no real suspense or uncertainty, and a main plot device (one of the black maids extracts revenge on a racist former employer by baking a pie that contains a decidedly unsavory and rather putrid ingredient and savoring the racist's enjoyment of it) is almost vulgarly offensive enough to distract the viewer's attention from the alleged moral indignation he/she is meant to feel for the unjust treatment the maid has received. Ultimately, the film is a disappointment, despite the strong performances of its cast, and I'll be thoroughly perplexed if it wins any Oscars at all.",1329091200,2,1341,5.271028037383178

4306793,3,B004A8ZWVU,"You can chunk this in that pile of `films to make you hate white people', for `The Help' really exposes to our generation the cruelty and just plain overwhelming ignorance of our forefathers.  Yes, racism is in full swing in this recent adaptation (and current Oscar contender), adapted from the bestselling novel of the same name.  That isn't to say that `The Help' is a complete downer of a film, because at its heart this is an inspirational (of sorts) film filled with love, hope, redemption and humor.

But MY GOD this script is all sorts of awful.

I'm just going to get out with the obvious.  `The Help' is rather mediocre.  The dialog is simplistic, the character development is minimal, the characterizations are complete clich&eacute;s and overblown caricatures and the actual plot is somewhat insulting in a way.  I can't get behind Hollywood's fixation on seeking white redemption through a barrage of race-related films where the sole savior of the black race is that one white person who sees through it all.  I mean, I know that not all whites were evil (and I'm white, so don't think that I'm coming from another vantage point here) but it is somewhat ridiculous that blacks are so often portrayed as helpless in these types of films.  They lack all convictions and courage until some bullheaded white person stokes their fire.  Sure, the fact of the matter is that these poor people were segregated in a `white world' and thus at the mercy of ignorant fools who thought so little of them as a whole, but they fought for their own rights and they made the difference for themselves.  `The Help' tries to spin that thought process towards the end, especially with regards to Aibileen, but this is certainly centered around Skeeter and the difference `she' made.

With that said, the acting here is largely triumphant and thanks to the dedicated performances, this film shines brightly.

Viola Davis is phenomenal as Aibileen.  The way she evokes such rich emotional depths in a film that is surrounded with shallowness is remarkable.  Jessica Chastain is funny, bubbly and, at her core, shatteringly heartbreaking.  Her loneliness and despair is masked by her airheaded demeanor, and she colors all her shades very well.  Octavia Spencer is witty and grounded as the comic relief here, and while I didn't find the depth I wanted to in her performance, she absolutely delivers the best line readings here.  Bryce Dallas Howard plays a ridiculous clich&eacute; of a woman, hardened and horrible, and yet she nails the tone perfectly.  And then you have a handful of smaller roles, all played with conviction and earnestness.  Sissy Spacek is hilarious and memorable, Allison Janney is the perfect springboard for Emma Stone's character and Cicely Tyson is heartbreakingly sincere as the film's core emotional impact.  Sadly, it girl Emma Stone is somewhat of an afterthought, completely engulfed by the more vibrant characters around her.

If you are looking for a more empowering look at the struggle for equality and the fight to be heard, watch 1990's `The Long Walk Home'.  `The Help' is more colorful, sure, and the acting as an ensemble is more enriched here, but the script is rather messy and really drags down the film's central themes in the process.

That said; I'm completely Team Viola come Oscar night!",1329091200,4,3329,4.914132379248659

Some characters were missing entirely, and the relationships between those who remained were not shown with the same depth.

4306798,5,B004A8ZWVU,"in the fifties and early sixties black maids/cooks in the Deep South worked (and sort of ""slaved"") for rich white women in big houses for rediculously low wages. Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis are wonderful as a long suffering black cooks and  Bryce Dallas Howard is over-the-top as an exacting rich white. In this movie the black women are shown as selfless saints and most of the rich whites are selfish demons (slave drivers?). Black and white, so to speak. A white outcast journalist, (Emma Stone) writes a book about how the maids are exploited.  Jessica Costain plays another white social outcast of the vindictive BDH.

Having lived through this era in the South, the blacks, as depicted in this movie, are a bit too good to be true. I understand the book was a lot more realistic and showed a lot more sarcasm and shades of gray and in the black characters.... the white women? pretty much as depicted!

Yes, my grandmother has told us hundreds of stories of how she would sing to their babies while rocking them to sleep in her arms as this type of life style was repeated all over the South and parts of the North as well.

It is not a well kept secret, but this is the first time I can say the truth is being told...yes it may have taken  someone from the other race to help ""put it out there"", but that was the insturment that opened the eyes of the world regarding the struggles of ""colored"" maids/help.

The movie's lush scenery and portrayal of 1960's Jackson, Mississippi helped me to visualize the setting, and it was beautiful. Of course, the white characters' problems, personal and otherwise, were very important to them, just as our problems, be they personal and perhaps petty, are important to us. It's a matter of scale.

When the Oscar nominations were made public I was disappointed that The Help did not receive more nods from the academy.  Shame on you!  The movie developed it's characters, in such a manner that you truly were involved in their lives.
The best of both worlds, I laughed so many times at the way the ignorance of people was out there, and I cried as you felt the pain of these women.
It was as if you were right next to the character of the writer as she discovered just how truly biggoted her female ""friends"" were. Also the bond developed between the characters was good and true.  This cannot be labeled as a chick flic as I think it will touch men as well.  Could well be agreat family night movie for older children.  It could open up discussion on how people were treated then, discrimination,  self-respect, and doing what is right no matter what your friends think.

4306822,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I saw the movie before reading the book. What I would like to say is read the book see the movie. What courage of spirit the Black maids had, and what courage of spirit one white women had in writing their story. It brought tears to my eyes laughter to my heart. Set in the south, the story though fiction, hits at the truth of non-fiction.",1328313600,,340,4.166666666666667
4306823,5,B004A8ZWVU,This was a wonderful story about our people and the times in which they live.  The DVD/Blue-Ray was excellent to view.  I received the disc ahead of the projected time.  I will order again with confidence.,1328313600,,205,4.638888888888889
4306824,3,B004A8ZWVU,"It was disappointing to pay rental on a movie with no closed caption.  The movie itself was quite good, but for people who need CC, it was unhandy having to back up and replay.",1328227200,,176,4.176470588235294

4306826,5,B004A8ZWVU,"From beginning to the end of this movie, you laugh, cry and search your own memories of ""the way it used to be"" and wonder how much has really changed in our society. I think everyone over the age of 18 should see this.",1328140800,,219,4.0
4306827,3,B004A8ZWVU,"I loved the book.  Loved, loved, loved it.  That is why I was so excited to see the movie.  I wanted to love the movie just as much.  I was pretty disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, I thought the actors were fabulous, the sets were gorgeous and it was shot very well.  What I didn't like is how much they left out from the book.  The characters in the movie were far too simplistic and they left so many stories out about the characters.  There were also a lot of very funny lines left out that I thought for sure would be in the movie because they were so original.  I realize that no movie can truly compare to the book, but I think the movie producers could have done better.  I was disappointed by the lack of depth.  Maybe if I hadn't read the book first, I would have liked the movie much more.",1328140800,4,800,4.096774193548387

4306829,5,B004A8ZWVU,"I read this book a while back. When I saw it had been made into a movie, I ignored it at first, thinking it couldn't possibly be very exciting. When I saw how many 5 star reviews it had gotten after a few months though I decided to give it a try. If anything it's better than the book. The book didn't make me cry.

This is one of those movies that stays with you for a very long time. Give it a chance!",1328054400,,403,3.7976190476190474
