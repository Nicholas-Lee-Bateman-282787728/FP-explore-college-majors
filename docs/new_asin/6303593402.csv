7851388,5,6303593402,"Alain Fournier's book Le Grande Meaulnes was the only book he wrote before being killed at an early age in WWI. The book is all about a mysterious student who shows up at a rural school after attending a mysterious part in an opulent chateau. He falls in love with a beautiful girl and the movie concerns his quest for her and the pains of moving from adolescence to adulthood. One of my favourite films of all time, now only available on DVD in Region 2 encoding (i.e. not playable on North American DVD players).",1172275200,3,514,4.421052631578948

This movie is the closest you might come to having a dream set to film. I read that they put vaseline on the edge of the lens, to get a fuzzy look (pre-digital effects days....).
I went back the very next night to see if I had been dreaming in the theatre, but there it was, in lovely dreamy fuzzy colors, with a mystical tale of a young man's coming of age, and mysterious romance. some of you might even see a little of Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"" in this. But this was first.....
This is film magic. Let's hope it makes it to DVD, as this particular tape transfer was less than awesome..
Try to rent it, or urge your local producer to get it set onto DVD. It would be a perfect companion piece to THE MAGUS, which also came out around the same time, and is also quite magical (and Candace Bergen was young and radiant). So get your uncle or your neighbor down there in LA-LA land to get these both onto DVD.
We're waiting!",1048723200,12,1015,4.157360406091371
