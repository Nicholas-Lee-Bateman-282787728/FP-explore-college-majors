Mr. Pigat is a patient, thorough instructor; he doesn't spent a lot of time trying to impress with his playing ability, which is terrific.",1434412800,,246,5.024390243902439

8286696,5,B001CCH2DS,"I like it. I would suggest to those who find this video too advanced to first write down the chords going by as Paul Pigat plays.  Really, he could not be more clear and still play something beyond begginer. I like the story he tells about ""woodshedding"" at the music store and how that is necessary at some point.
If you want to conquer this ,do it. Do just one tiny part at a time or order 2 pizzas and sit in front of the TV all weekend until you can play it all. This style is timeless and is worth your investment. For the already advenced player, this guy will have something you don't already know. Are you gonna let him get away with that?",1366588800,2,647,4.134920634920635
8286697,5,B001CCH2DS,"I have this DVD and Paul Pigat's Rockabilly DVD - both are excellent.

They are geared to the intermediate to advanced player. But if you're looking to add some new tricks to your playing, I'd highly recommend checking out Paul Pigat's DVDs.",1260576000,2,241,4.738095238095238
8286698,5,B001CCH2DS,"Paul has a really great, patient way of explaining exactly what he's playing.  This is an intermediate DVD but I think a lot of beginners will also benefit from it.  You can also get all the tabs from his website at no extra charge to follow along.  I thought it was great. I've gotten burned a few times buying instructional DVD's, but I would highly recommend any Paul Pigat DVD.",1235260800,3,381,4.414285714285715
