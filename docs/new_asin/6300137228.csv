7803417,1,6300137228,"My rating of one star isn't based on the quality of the movie, but on the fact that it is marketed to young children. I watch horror films for research and even now none of them have the power to upset me like this movie does. This is one of the most dark, depressing movies I've ever seen, and while I suppose it shows the negative consequences of seeking vengence, several scenes could also be interpreted as being literally Nietzschean in their depiction of the strong preying on the weak, and may send a fatalist message that some people are destined to be victims no matter what path they choose. This is definitely NOT a message we want to send via children's cinema. This is an adult film and due to its dark themes and conclusion, I think it should have an R rating. We all know that life is filled with harsh realities, but there are plenty of high quality films out there that teach life lessons via more age-appropriate storylines.",1296950400,3,942,4.482558139534884

***spoilers below***

the story is about a young lamb named chirin who lived with his mother and their herd in a meadow. chirin was more energetic than all the other lambs put together and wore a bell around his neck so that his mother could find him if he wandered too far while playing. all is good in chirin's life until one night when the wolf king comes down from his mountain and attacks the sheep in their little hut. he starts attacking one or two of the sheep and then sees chirin and charges for him. but before the wolf can eat him chirin's mother throws herself on chirin and sacrifices herself for her baby. when chirin is able to struggle out from under his mother the wolf has gone and he finds that his mother is dead, so he leaves the meadow to find the wolf on the mountain and get revenge. when he climbs the mountain and finds the wolf he tries charging him, yelling that he killed his mother, but the wolf doesn't give him the time of day and flicks him down the side of a small drop with his tail, knocking chirin out. when he wakes up he goes again to find the wolf, but this time tells the wolf that he wants to be his apprentice. sheep are weak and they hide instead of fighting, but wolves are strong. the wolf laughs him off and chirin goes off to prove himself as a wolf by trying to scare buffalo, a skunk, and a couple of ground hogs or something, but instead of scaring them they just laugh and end up pushing him around instead. chirin returns to the wolf defeated and then decides to follow the wolf around. the wolf ends up giving in and trains chirin to live the hard and lonely life of a wolf. after much time has past and chirin has grown into an adult ram, the wolf decides it is time to attack the sheep in the meadow again, this time with chirin. chirin barges into the little shack and the sheep are scrambling around everywhere to hide. one little lamb calls for his mother and she runs to him and shields him with her body, like chirin's mother did so long ago. this strikes a chord in him and he runs out of the hut. the wolf comes to meet him and tells him not to run away. chirin doesn't want to wolf to kill anymore sheep so he and the wolf fight and chirin ends up killing him. then chirin leaves, more alone and heartsick than ever before, never to be seen or heard from again.

this movie touched a chord in me, i think it would in almost anyone. when you first start watching it it seems like it will be a really fluffy vacuous movie that you'll forget 10 minutes after watching it. instead, it's almost a testament to those who have loved and lost and then let the pain of that loss lead them down a darker road. and i know that it doesn't seem like a movie for children, but i think that the way this was handled is appropriate for a children's film. there is no blood or gore, it just deals with serious issues instead of happily ever afters and the vacuous fluff we've become used to. this was made in the 70's so what's deemed appropriate now and what was then has obviously changed, but i think that films like this should be seen by children. life is not always going to be happy, not everyone you meet will be happy, and sometimes you will be in bad situations.

 the character in this film makes a choice to isolate himself and to be mean, like the wolf who killed his mom, but the way the movie ends leaves the viewer feeling his sadness and his dissatisfaction with his own life. it doesn't tell the child what should be done in a sad situation, but lets the viewer make their own decision. i actually loved it when i first saw it (as an adult) because it didn't have that happy, disney ending. i mean i love happy endings, but our society has really sucked everything out of the 'happily ever after' idea, so much so that a happy ending seems almost false or staged in film. in almost every film you know that the characters will all be happy at the end of the movie, even if they don't end up getting the guy/girl, they are happy with their lives. this often leads to young kids who grow up having to find out that life isn't a happily ever after. there will be bad things that happen and you won't always get the guy/ girl. in fact, romance may not even be the focal point of your happiness, shocking an idea as that is. this movie had an unsatisfied character and left the viewer with something to think about. chirin's struggle will stay with you after the credits. it definitely leaves an impression on the viewer. now, whether or not you want to expose your child to the fact that everything is not happy in the world and that the choices you make will effect you in some way or another is up to the parent, but this is definitely a children's film. it's deeper than it seems on the surface and gives a child something to think about. great film.",1271116800,,5180,4.441640378548896
7803419,5,6300137228,"I saw this cartoon when I was a kid. My parents use to go to movie rental place and I would rent almost everything just to have something to watch. Some people think this movie is the worst kid movie ever, and I guess it is looking at it from an adult perspective because it is sad but when I was a kid I loved this movie alot. It left a last impression on my mind. I use to get my parents to rent it over and over for me. I did not think it was any more weird than The Hobbit or Flight of the Dragons or Dot and the Kangaroo and Watership Down with the killer rabbits and that Dungeons and Dragons 1983 series that I also use to watch. I have been on a quest to find all of these strange movies on DVD just to add to an obscure collection of mine. Films like these fueled some of my artistic inspiration growing up. :-) I had not known that Ringing Bells was an anime movie. That explains it all. *lol* I don't think I would show it to my 3 year old. She would not like seeing the animals hurting other animals. I am disappointed that it is not here for purchase. I'm not paying almost $50.00 bucks for a used movie from the third party sellers either. I guess I will keep searching. :-)",1170288000,,1188,3.9748953974895396
7803420,5,6300137228,"Ringing Bell is a wonderful anime film that tells the tale of a young lamb's journey through life, and the hardships he must endure.  I first saw this when I was a small child, and I do agree that it is a powerful movie that stays with you.  I had my child watch it at about 7 years old, and would not recommend it for much younger.  I still cried the last time I saw it, but I still love it.",1169251200,,392,3.814814814814815
7803421,5,6300137228,"I have had this movie since I was a small child and I still watch it.  It is a very powerful story and it makes me cry everytime.  It was a bit too intense for my 5 year old daughter so you might want to take individual childrens tolerance levels into consideration before letting them view it.  But to have something from childhood really stay with you the way this movie has for so many really says something about its quality.  It resonates with something inside us, and I as so many others have stated will never forget it.",1134604800,,527,4.292929292929293
7803422,5,6300137228,"I saw this when I was probably 6 or 7 years old, and it's lingered  ever since. People underestimate a child's capacity to appreciate drama, and give them shallow distractions such as teletubbies or whatever. From the fact that this movie's story has stayed with me ever since I saw it as a young child (and what better way to judge a movie than its long term impact), I'd have to say it's a great film.",1129075200,5,403,4.302631578947368
7803423,5,6300137228,"Like most of the people in here, I saw this movie in elementary school, second grade I think, and I have never forgotten it.  I remember it being emotionally stirring (something you don't typically get in sugared down childrens movies)... but not disturbing, the message was received and never forgotten.  Even though I only ever saw this movie once, I remember the story.

I have been seeking this movie ever since, only remembering a movie with a lamb raised by a wolf, and that the movie was maybe called ""Bell"".

Highly recommended for the young and old",1101772800,6,557,4.711340206185567
7803424,5,6300137228,"I watched this movie when i was really young, probably about 7 years old, twenty years later I have never forgot the movie although I had some diffculty remembering the name and was ecstatic when i finally found it on the web.  This movie touches the heart although I cried at the end, I'll never forget the lessons I learned, and that life doesn't always have a fairy tale ending, one should choose their path in life carefully or it could take you somewhere you never wanted to go.  Hatred and revenge will never benefit.",1037491200,4,523,4.494736842105263

I have loved this film since I was very young and though it is very sad-it is a wonderful way to show children some of the sadder aspects of life while instilling values such as good character, bravery, love, and what it means to have a good heart.  I will show it to my own children one day and I think it is a mamorable film that anyone at any age can enjoy and appreciate.",997056000,9,491,4.104166666666667
