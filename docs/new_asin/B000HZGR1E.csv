As the story progressed and Krishna was faced with serious challenges that kicked him into his true mantle of manhood, he certainly stepped his game up with one-pointed concentration!  And I really enjoyed how this was illustrated in the movie.  I found the special effects riveting in conjunction with the action music, and the dance numbers/songs uplifting and beautiful.  It's the best superhero movie I've seen!",1240444800,3,537,5.137931034482759
8142602,5,B000HZGR1E,"Maybe even better. Though long, Krrish shows how it's the heart of a person, as well as their abilities, that make them a true hero.",1235260800,3,132,4.32
