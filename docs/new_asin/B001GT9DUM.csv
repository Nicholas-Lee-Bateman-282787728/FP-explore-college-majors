8307031,5,B001GT9DUM,"22 year old Satou is a NEET, and a hikkikomori. He never leaves the house. He just sits around drinking beer, smoking, and watching TV. On top of all this he is also delusional. He convinces himself that a group called the NHK (Nihon Hikkikomori Kyoukai) is out to get him and turn the entire country into NEETs. One day a pretty high school girl named Misaki visits him and offers to give him counseling to cure his hikkikomori condition. The 2 become closer and begin to rely on each other. As their relationship strengthens Satou is able to venture out and do things on his own. Lot's of drama and comedy ensue.

This anime is completely different from anything I've ever seen. It dark and methodical vibe are complemented by the main characters hilarious paranoia and perverted imagination. The production is top notch. Animation and music are all very good. It also stars 2 of my favorite voice actors, Chris Patton and Luci Christian. Given Satou's perverted imagination, this anime isn't for young viewers. But if you're older and want to laugh a lot and want to see a interesting romantic comedy then this anime will probably make you very happy.",1354924800,,1154,4.712871287128713
8307032,5,B001GT9DUM,"Both funny and emotionally powerful, Welcome to the NHK is an anime that definitely deserves to be watched, if not owned by any red-blooded otaku. What I like best about this series is how real it seems in the end...there is no deus ex machina situation that solves Tatsuhiro Sato's and Misaki Nakahara's problems. It just feels so right and believable. That being said, the pacing of the series feels a bit off to me, resulting in some clunky storytelling but to anyone that sticks around this really won't matter. This anime deserves its place on my DVD shelf.",1232755200,2,562,4.686868686868687
8307033,5,B001GT9DUM,Wow.  It is every bit of that good.  This is one of the best drama animes I have ever seen.  I will spare you the details on the plot to simply say that if you like a dramatic anime about people and their psychological issues get this anime immediately.  Pay for the fast shipping so you can get started watching it right away.,1231113600,2,327,4.142857142857143
