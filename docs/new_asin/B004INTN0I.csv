4387256,2,B004INTN0I,"Well... The workouts are ok. The cardio routine is kinda dancy and fun but I personnaly didn't get the satisfaction I'm used too get out of a cardio workout. I guess this is the perfect video for late pregnancy or for women that are less active prior to pregnancy. My biggest problem with this is the fact that you are listening to Christian music during the workouts and you get to do a prayer during the introdcution...  I didn't know I had made a Christian enthousiast purchase until I received the package. It was my fault, since I didn't read the description properly... Although after double checking the description, it only mentions the word Christian once, in the following phrase: ''In addition to an original upbeat soundtrack of new and familiar Christian dance music, the DVD also comes with a discount code to download the mix''.  I totally missed the word ''Christian''...  It says the DVD is featuring Chrisitan music on the product's cover, but unfortunately the picture posted on amazon is too small to be able to actually read it. Religious beliefs are  very, very, very personal, and I just think that the product should be named ''Glow - Christian Prenatal Cardio Sculpt'' so that it would be definitely obvious to which customers these workout videos are for. I respect everyone's beliefs and have nothing against anyone who wants their christianity to be included even in their exercice routine, but I'm not that kind of person and I wouldn't have spend my money on this If I had known there was religious opinions in it.",1386633600,7,1544,4.793233082706767
4387257,5,B004INTN0I,"I had been doing a Dance of Fat Fast 10 minute solutions DVD before pregnancy, and thought I could continue it into pregnancy. However, I started to get pains and odd aches after and knew I had to get something else. Plus, I wanted sculpting and not just cardio. With this DVD I've got cardio and sculpting, and felt sore the next day the first couple times I did it which is great. I know it's working other muscles than what I had been before. It's not too hard and there are modifications if you can't do some of the workouts. Now some of the cardio gets confusing, and I have yet to 100% get the hang of it, but I'm sure I will soon. And with the sculpting you're constantly setting the weights down, doing something, and then needing them for the next exercise, so I just use strap on wrist weights to avoid messing with it. The sculpting also says you need a towel, but you'll only need one if you're on a hard floor and not carpet. Either way I'd recommend the DVD and am using it exclusively for my workouts.",1385078400,,1016,4.242268041237113
4387258,3,B004INTN0I,"The ""cardio"" was not much of a cardio workout. Save yourself a few bucks and march in place while watching the news. That's about as strenuous as it gets.",1384732800,3,154,4.344827586206897
4387259,5,B004INTN0I,"I love the fact that you can do the workout throughout the trimester. It is fun and not too tedious, the choreography is easy to follow which I absolutely love. Even on days I feel very lazy, I can still do the workout without feeling exhausted. I enjoyed the music that went with it, you do not even realize that you are listening to christian music. It is fun, easy and inspiring.",1371513600,5,382,4.319444444444445
4387260,5,B004INTN0I,This one is fun and effective I really liked doing the choreography wish is not complicated and the stretching part really helped me. In this DVD we are encouraged to move freely and exercise till the end of your pregnancy. There are not many good pregnancy DVDs but this is one of them.,1363824000,3,287,4.433962264150943
4387261,4,B004INTN0I,"When I first start doing prenatal exercise, doing Tonya Larson's Glow program alone won't satisfy my cravings for exercise during my pregnancy. Since it was in the beginning of my second trimester, which means I had a lot of energy, I may be able to do more than one pregnancy exercise programs. My favorite exercise routine would be to start with a Les Mills' Body Step program which I downloaded from YouTube before I move to Tonya Larson's.
After I reached my 28 weeks however, I start losing some of the energy along with the fact that my feet get swollen easily. I find that Tonya's Glow is the only exercise program that I can do properly and actually having a good time ding it. It's quite entertaining and keeps you moving. By the end of the program, I will feel slightly energetic (will not happen every time, really depending on your physical conditions which changes everyday).",1338595200,3,888,4.662420382165605
8431014,5,B004INTN0I,"I really like this work out! I am at 32 weeks and have been doing it for a about a month and the difficulty is just right for getting the cardio without pushing yourself too hard. I love the Christian music to move to. The cardio steps are a little difficult to follow, but as long as it keeps me moving, that's all that matters!",1451433600,,329,4.076923076923077
8431015,4,B004INTN0I,Very friendly if you were not very fit before but also challenging. Good buy.,1436832000,,77,4.571428571428571
8431016,5,B004INTN0I,"Great for the not SUPER-Fit, very pregnant, or former-athletes become moms, ""who have no time for anything remotely like they used to do,"" who want to stay fit while already pregnant.  Currently pregnant with my 5th. I used to work out a ton, but was more the runner, some weights/sculpting outdoorsy type.  I haven't been that in I don't know about 8 years since having my first. I've stayed reasonably in shape, but noticed this time that I definitely have muscle weakness that is behind a lot of my aches and pains related to the pregnancy (4 C-sections too).  Getting the aerobics moves was a little challenging for me and my kids (they are doing it with me:), but we keep moving and catch on a little each time.  I'm sure it would not be a challenge for anyone who can actually dance or who does aerobics normally.  Nonetheless, it did keep my heart-rate up, challenge my muscles, but caused no sharp pains, cramping, contractions, or anything else I didn't feel comfortable with.  The total workout is 58 minutes.  If you are a die-hard exerciser, it will likely be too easy for you - but keep it in mind at the very end when you are HUGE and uncomfortable or just need to take it easier.  If you aren't in your best shape try it good modifications are clear to ease up or challenge yourself.  Look, about the Christian music stuff I am concentrating so hard on following the steps I don't hear the songs other than the beat.  If it would bother you that much, there is so much else out there for you.  She is clearly Bible-believing if you have followed any of her other tapes - we use another one for family exercise with our homeschoolers that she makes and love it.  Nonetheless, there is no proselytizing  It is a workout video.  All she says is that, ""children are a blessing from the Lord.""  If that will bothers you don't buy it, if you can go beyond it and need a mild to moderate pregnancy workout video give it a try.",1432598400,,1934,4.423728813559322
8431017,4,B004INTN0I,"This is a very pleasant workout DVD with variety, even though I'm not too keen on upbeat Christian music (thankfully you can't really tell that's what it is). The DVD packaging, however, advertises 5 cardio routines - as if you can choose from 5 different workouts, which isn't the case. It's actually 5 combinations (3-4 minutes each) that are then combined at the end to complete the 25-minute cardio portion. Overall it's not too challenging but the instructors are very pleasant and motivating.",1422316800,,498,5.0120481927710845
8431018,2,B004INTN0I,Got this as a gift to start the new year and this pregnancy off right. My last pregnancy I only gain 30 lbs but could never lose the last 10lbs so I decided to actually work out this time. BEFORE I got pregnant the first time I was doing INSANITY. I'm not saying I was ripped but in shape. I'm not comparing the two because INSANITY is NOT for a pregnant women BUT this workout did absolutely nothing for me. Now it may be because I am used to a higher level of cardio or whatever but I did the cardio and barely got my heart rate up. Didn't even break a sweat. I would only recommend this workout for people who never exercise period. If you do regular exercise I would go with something with higher intensity.,1421193600,,711,4.159420289855072
8431019,4,B004INTN0I,"This is a good and varied prenatal workout. I had been doing another, which I enjoyed, but it was not very strenuous. This one was still well within my comfort range (at 26 weeks) but gave me a little more exercise. I really appreciate the modifications for almost every move, that allow each person to work the same muscle set at a level that works for her. I did find out that it would be helpful to watch the tutorial on the moves before trying it out - I thought I'd just follow along and learn and it took a little while to pick up on some of them since there was a lot of quick footwork. By the end I was getting it but would have been a lot easier if I'd learned the moves first. Overall, good solid workout that focuses on keeping mom and baby safe and healthy. I also liked Tonya's gentle teaching style. Often workout coaches tend to get kinda loud and forceful as they try to build energy, but I liked this much better.",1416960000,,930,4.1722222222222225
8431020,5,B004INTN0I,"This trainer is very detailed oriented, knowledgeable and dummy proof. LOL However if you are out of shape might be a little hard for you. Otherwise I love that it is safe for baby and mommy. This workout made me sweat without weights; lastly it's only challenging to people who are used to picking up steps throughout the entire routine. Also it's fun and she created a modified workout and advanced as well.",1401235200,,409,4.616438356164384
8431021,4,B004INTN0I,I am enjoying this workout and would recommend it.  The exercises are appropriate and can adjust to your own pace with the demonstrated variations.  The instructor and background music are likable.,1400544000,,197,5.32258064516129
8431022,5,B004INTN0I,"This is a well-produced DVD that makes you feel like you're part of an aerobics class at the gym. The instructor, Tonya, is cheerful without being overly perky. She's easy to follow and since the two women with her are also farther along in pregnancy, you feel like one of the group. The cardio workout has 5 combinations, which Tonya guides you through before putting everything together at the end. If you're intimidated by choreography in cardio exercise, there is an option from the main menu to go through a tutorial of the moves.

I'm pregnant with my second child and wish I would have purchased this DVD during my first pregnancy!",1400198400,,638,4.696428571428571
8431023,5,B004INTN0I,"Amazing video. Perfect for my expanding tummy, and overall changing body. I especially loved the stretch section that gave me a relaxing few minutes to really think about this miracle that grows inside me.",1391126400,,205,5.0588235294117645
