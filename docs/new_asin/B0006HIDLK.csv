2188064,5,B0006HIDLK,This and every other movie that came out in 2000 is a classic. most of the stuff even after 2001 just suck. This movie is awesome and still hilarious.,1297036800,,150,4.206896551724138
2188065,2,B0006HIDLK,I've seen this movie enough times as a kid to know that this DVD is missing several scenes and it skips a lot. I would not recommend getting this.,1288310400,13,146,4.068965517241379
2188066,5,B0006HIDLK,"I saw this movie so long ago. You remember, when video stores were local and on VHS. I always remembered that, Robert England, played, Freddy Krueger. I never should've watched those movies. However, this was a great movie. For a Feature Family Film, the quality was very good! I give this the coveted 5 asterix *****.",1286323200,,318,4.696428571428571
2188067,1,B0006HIDLK,"I wish I had seen some of the other reviews on here before I purchased this trash. I had originally watched this movie, the uncut version mind you, on the Disney Channel - Yes, The DISNEY Channel! If the movie in its original state was good enough for the folks at squeeky-clean Disney, then why wasn't it good enough for the company that released this DVD? Some of the cuts, as mentioned in the other review, were completely uncalled for and if I hadn't seen the uncut version I would have been lost. My advice is to do as the other reviewer says - look for the version entitled ""The Paper Brigade"".",1220054400,8,600,4.366071428571429
2188068,4,B0006HIDLK,"IF you have never seen this movie its incredibly cheesy, but it is still great. If you liked house arrest your going to love this film.",1213920000,,135,4.230769230769231
2188069,1,B0006HIDLK,"When I bought this, I was expecting the real true movie... wrong. They took out a lot of the movie and edited a lot of stuff. I mean it's a good movie, but why cut parts out? Wasn't happy about that at all.",1210377600,20,206,3.813953488372093
2188070,2,B0006HIDLK,"This is a family/time compressed version.
There are certain points missing in the movie.
It was alright, but wasn't what I was expecting.",1190764800,11,137,5.0
2188071,1,B0006HIDLK,"If you want the real movie, look for one simply titled, ""The Paper Brigade.""  It is an enjoyable family movie containing nothing that anyone but a rabid puritan would find offensive.  A number of scenes have been cut in this version because they mention potty humor, or show what the trad vals group considers naughty behavior.  The cuts left scenes muddled, and rendered the whole thing garbage.  As far as I can tell, some dialogue was cut from one scene simply because the kids mentioned (gasp) a restroom.",1136678400,5,509,4.75

2188094,5,B0006HIDLK,"Great movie for families especially with younger children. Fun and clean. Typical storyline, young teen new kid in town faces a boring summer filled with bullies, awkward friends, a lack of money, and a crush on a girl. All solved in an entertaining and fun way using a paper route. Its a fun movie.",1432080000,,299,4.555555555555555

2188098,4,B0006HIDLK,Great family movie! Remember watching when I was younger and it was still entertaining as an adult. One of the few movies that lifts up family values and morals.,1408147200,,161,4.586206896551724
2188099,5,B0006HIDLK,"Arrived on time, brand new and sealed. Loved this movie as a child and was still pretty entertaining when I watched it again! They don't make movies like they use to!",1404518400,,166,4.387096774193548

2188101,3,B0006HIDLK,"We own the original version of The Paper Brigade on VHS.  Our family has watched it numerous times for many, many years.  We have favorite lines and parts of the video.  Gunther & the Paper Brigade is a edited version of the original movie.  It seems like our favorite parts were all edited out.  I was so excited to find it on DVD and then SO disappointed to see it was NOT our family favorite.",1395878400,4,395,4.213333333333333

2188104,5,B0006HIDLK,"I give 5 stars!
I loved watching this movie when i was in my teenage years; when i saw it on Amazon i had to have it!

Thank you :)",1379894400,,279,3.7288135593220337
2188105,5,B0006HIDLK,"I previously had the vhs tape of this movie so I was very happy to see it released on dvd.  The only thing I didn't care for were that some of the scenes were omitted, but the movie is still very funny and sends a positive message for all ages!!",1373241600,,245,3.9

2188108,5,B0006HIDLK,This definately is a collectors item. Family movies usually lack entertaining child actors. This one though excels with all the kids. Kyle Howard is superb.,1367798400,,156,5.28
2188109,5,B0006HIDLK,My students love this video. It is funny and the students can relate to the age of the characters in the story. You know that a kid likes something when they ask to see it the next time I show a movie for a reward.,1341878400,,214,3.7777777777777777

2188111,5,B0006HIDLK,The DVD version of this movie is presented in overall great quality and it is worth the price just to bring back old memories. Worth every penny despite the terrible reviews of this dvd from other people.,1336176000,,204,4.54054054054054

8041633,1,B0006HIDLK,"I was able to pick up a copy of this at a resale shop, and although the evidence suggested terrible tampering film wise, such as the Feature Films for Families tagline (subtag ""Strengthening Traditional Values Through Entertainment) and the Discussion questions on the back (because kids are too stupid to learn lessons from movies just by watching them. Amiright?) I took it home to see if it still held up to what I remembered it being. And as a standalone film it does. The kids are still great actors, the comedy still made me laugh, and I was able to appreciate Crazy Man Cooper in a better light now knowing what a legend the actor is. But this copy is also why Rated G films are such a joke, especially when there's a conservative agenda behind it. Major chunks are cut in such a sloppy and choppy manner it's like they want you to remember that there's a better version of this film out there. And you may think I'm petty for missing some bathroom jokes and lines regarding Gunther's crush on Alison, but when you think about how this company didn't think those were ""family appropriate"" it makes it look worse on them, especially when we're given such a sloppy final result of a movie that was incredible on its own. Also, what was the point in changing ""The Paper Brigade"" to ""Gunther and the Paper Brigade""? Did ""The Paper Brigade"" sound too violent? Nothing needed to be changed about this film, and I wouldn't have given it such a low rating if not for the fact that this is the ONLY DVD COPY OF THE PAPER BRIGADE OUT THERE! Not kidding, the only way to get the original, uncut version is to buy it on VHS. So unless someone can point me in the direction of the uncut version, I'm just going to give this movie a big, blurred out middle finger. How's that for Family Friendly?",1493769600,,1789,4.4407294832826745
8041634,5,B0006HIDLK,Hard to find video/CD - a favorite of a grandson and he was delighted to receive his own copy,1486684800,,93,3.9473684210526314
8041635,5,B0006HIDLK,"This movie made a debut on the Disney channel, and was first available as a VHS.  Kyle Howard as Gunther, was center stage who superbly performed several situations a boy goes through during the awakening (relationship with girls for the first time), adjusting to a new neighborhood, and some of the problems in Middle School viz. Junior High (bullying, group intimidation inter alia).  Most important with a lot of humor was how Gunther dealt with the feelings and well-being of others.  This is a great family movie, or for all ages.  There is some truth that the DVD edited out several parts of the original VHS version.  Nevertheless, enough content found in the DVD version is really good comedy.  I would give this 5 stars for the comedy despite the loss of content found in the VHS.",1464739200,,789,4.7226277372262775
8041636,5,B0006HIDLK,it's so nice to find my childhood classics like this one.,1462492800,,57,4.2727272727272725
