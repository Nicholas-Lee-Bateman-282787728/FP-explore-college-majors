7908553,4,B00000FE0M,"""Try this for a deep dark secret. There great detective Remington Steele, he doesn't exist! I invented him. Follow. I always loved excitement so I studied, and apprenticed, and put my name on an office. But absolutely nobody knocked down on my door. A female private investigator seemed so... feminine. So I invented a superior. A decidedly masculine superior. Suddenly there were cases around the block! It was working like a charm. Until the day he walked in. With his blue eyes and mysterious past. And before I knew it, he assumed Remington Steele's identity. Now I do the work and he takes the bows. It's a dangerous way to live, but as long as people buy it, I can get the job done. We never mix business with pleasure. Well... almost never. I don't even know his real name!""
This is how some of the episodes began, with this introduction by 'Remington Steele's' assistant, Laura Holt (Stephanie Zimbalist). Now you know the whole story behind Remington Steele. The Remington Steele series were about the cases Remington Steele (Pierce Brosnan) and his associate Laura Holt (Stephanie Zimbalist) cracked many difficult and complicated cases. Also starring were James Read as Murphy Michaels as their co-worker (only in the first season), Janet DeMay as Bernice Foxe their secretary (only for the first season), and Doris Roberts as Mildred Krebs (for the rest of the seasons). I thought that Murphy Michaels and Bernice Foxe were pretty necessary in the series and was sorry to them go after the first season, though Mildred is a great character! Showing occasionally was also Stephanie Zimbalist's father, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Daniel Chalmers, an old friend of 'Remington Steele'.
When Mildred Krebs attends a seance at the circus which ends mysteriously, Remington Steele and Laura Holt are thrown into a dangerous net of events which lead back to a robbery many years earlier. Will the famous duo be able to solve the mystery before their own lives become at stake?
Unfortunately, ""High Flying Steele"" is not really one of the best of the Remington Steele series. First of all, the plot is at times a bit too complicated and the story drags a bit at some points. But as always, the chemistry between the two main actors are what really makes this episode as fun to watch as any of the others. The scene where Remington and Steele practice on the trapeze is a cute scene and the ending is just as sweet.
Favorite Lines:
Laura: Mildred is a seance freak, I'm a circus freak.
Remington: Professionally, I seem to be surrounded by freaks. Somehow I feel at home.
Trivia: There's one scene where Remington Steele goes undercover as a fire breather. Pierce Brosnan ran away with the circus as a fire breather in his teens.",1052697600,2,2727,4.816631130063966
7908554,5,B00000FE0M,"One of my favorite episodes of the Remington Steele series, now being  rerun on PAXtv. This one is full of color and amusing visuals, as well as  giving some small insights into Steele's past.
Romantic-at-heart,  mother-hen secretary Mildred is attending seances at a local circus. But  the next day day Steele arrives at the office and is clubbed over the head  by a mysterious person who ransacks the files. Laura and Steele decide to  go undercover to discover who attacked Steele--and may have crippled a  trapeze artist long before.
The plot is a bit hard to follow, but it  makes up for that in the great music and the enjoyable cast of secondary  characters. The music is especially fast-paced in the scenes where Steele  climbs the Ferris Wheel, and when the basement floods. Then there is the  chilly, seemingly apathetic ex-trapeze artist, the mysterious acrobat Guy,  and the tortured custodian Max.
There is also the added bonus of watching  Steele and Laura donning leotards and tights and practicing in her spacious  apartment. The scene where they actually perform is tight and  suspenseful... a wonderful episode.",968630400,7,1129,5.027027027027027
