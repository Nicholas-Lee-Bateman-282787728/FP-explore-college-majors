8370731,1,B002I41KJ6,"When I bought this I thought it was the History Channel,but it is not, and adds nothing to the vast amount of Templar info of current times. There is little of real information on this pricey 45 minute disc. The trial of the Templars, the ACTUAL Trial is given about 3 minutes at the most, the rest being things we already know if we are Templar buffs. There were mass burnings as aftermath of the Black Friday raid, yet they seem to focus on just one, Jacques De Molay and the public execution is shown more than once seemingly as filler. A real disappointment. Rent or avoid this DVD",1394236800,,585,4.376146788990826
