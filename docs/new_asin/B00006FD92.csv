1745093,5,B00006FD92,Surviving Gilligan's Island is a great documentary that shows you what went on....off the screen. It really gives you a good idea of what the actors were like in real life. I really liked this movie and would recommend it for all Gilligan fans! A must see.,1247356800,3,256,4.468085106382978
1745094,5,B00006FD92,"Although the actors are not the original people from the show, those who played them did a fine job and the story is interesting.  This is a must see for anyone who enjoys ""Gilligan's Island"".  Worth every $.",1184976000,3,208,4.447368421052632
1745095,5,B00006FD92,"The lagoon could not sustain life. Bob and Alan put a fish in it and it instantly died.
Tina Louise was tricked onto the show by her manager. She was under the impression that it was her show.
Mrs. Howell had no breasts.
At 94 years old, Mary Ann is still hot.
Bob Denver sold his soul to the devil for eternal life, but looks like a mummy.
Russel Johnson, the professor can invent anything except for a diet pill. The guy weighs 450 pounds.",1076544000,9,441,4.2
1745096,5,B00006FD92,"Although this comedy was not well received at first, to this day it is still shown all over the world and in many different languages. This DVD tells the story of seven castaways from beginning to end. Reinactments give you a visualization of how the show came about and why it was such a success. Picture quality is superior. A must see for Gilligan's Isle fans!",1037836800,14,363,4.515151515151516
1745097,5,B00006FD92,This show was perfection.  Anyone who enjoys the classic show Gilligan's Island MUST see this Documentary. The re-enactments were great.  Much better then just showing pictures and old clips. It shows how the show was created having look alike characters play the parts of the original cast. These actors were very entertaining. Especially when I wasn't too excited about seeing new actors filling the roles. But it turned out to be perfect. The DVD menus and extras are themed very closely to the show and make for some fun amusement. This just makes me want all 3 seasons from the original series on DVD even more.  I cannot wait for that day to come.  All Gilligan Island lovers must own this DVD.,1032998400,24,700,4.713114754098361
1745098,5,B00006FD92,"This was a TV Special that was on last year in November I think. I taped it off the TV, but it would be nice to get it on DVD without commercials (there were a lot i believe).
Very Nice. Hosted By Dawn Wells (Mary Ann Summers), Bob Denver (Willy Gilligan), & Russell Johnson (Proffesor Roy Hinkley ""The Proffesor""). It includes re-enactments of things that happend behind the scenes.
I have a Gilligan website. I had known about their real names like Willy Gilligan and Roy Hinkley, and Mrs. Howell's name (Eunice Wentworth (Lovey) Howell), and the Skipper Jonas Grumby's name. Now they announced the whole Willy thing on this and now everyone thinks that's the only way I knew.
It was a great special. I'm really glad they're releasing it on DVD. I hope they'll release all the episodes, and the other two movies, The Castaways on Gilligan's Island, and The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligans Island on DVD. They're not even on VHS. Hopefully the quality on those will be better than the rescue from gilligans island dvd. I heard that wasn't very good. I have that on VHS.
GREAT MOVIE.",1030492800,5,1085,4.65625

7967487,5,B00006FD92,"This was a fascinating look into what really went on with the show. Sadly, like usual, Tina Louise does not take part in this project and you wonder if maybe they didn't even ask her. It does paint her in an even darker light as it's revealed she thought the show would be about her and the cast got a big laugh at the first read through over it. Also of note, Natalie Schaefer took the role in the pilot only because of the Hawaii locale and didn't think it would even go to series. The story of how they found Alan Hale in the studio caf is also a neat story.",1378252800,,561,4.017857142857143

7967490,4,B00006FD92,If you like the show you'll find this fun and informative.  Sherwood Schwartz wrote a book about his experiences in getting the show on the air.  There many insights about the process in this made-for-TV-movie.  I think the best part is the guy who plays Alan Hale.,1355443200,,265,4.595744680851064
7967491,5,B00006FD92,"This docudrama film from 2001 is one of (if not the best) ""Gilligan's Island"" documentaries ever! However, the film does contain some corny and cheesy points, which is something to frown upon. But asides from that, we get to see how Sherwood Schwartz got the show started, how the pilots (yes, pilots) were filmed, how the casting and re-casting was done, how the show did on the air, and why it was suddenly cancelled after just 98 episodes. This documentary shows younger actresses and actors potraying the cast and creator and other people behind ""Gilligan's Island"" in little drama segments and even has pieces with the real Gilligan, Mary Ann, and Professor! If your a fan of the 1960s series, I guarentee you that this film want disappoint you at all!",1343088000,5,757,4.786259541984733
7967492,5,B00006FD92,"If you liked Gilligans Islaqnd, you should like this story. I have looked for it since I first saw it years ago. It is an ""insiders look"" at the making of Gilligan's Island. From the first scenes with Dawn Wells to the cast luncheon where everyone saw Jim Backus for the last time, I thought it was a great view into the making of the show and follow-up of their lives.",1316390400,8,369,4.211267605633803
7967493,5,B00006FD92,"Great movie and I couldn't believe the actors they got to play the parts of the cast and how much a couple looked like the original actors. I also learned some things I didn't know about the show and the actors. It was also nice seeing Russell Johnson, Dawn Wells and Bob Denver and Sherwood Schwartz talking about the show and their relationships with eachother in the making of the show. I would recommend this dvd to any Gilligan's Island fan.",1314489600,,446,4.518518518518518
