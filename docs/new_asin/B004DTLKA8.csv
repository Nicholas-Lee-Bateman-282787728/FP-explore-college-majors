THIS MOVIE HAS MADE MY TOP BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR ALONG WITH IP MAN A LEGEND IS BORN, REIGN OF ASSASSINS, THE SORCERER AND THE WHITE SNAKE, WUXIA, AND STORM WARRIORS.

4334637,5,B004DTLKA8,For all those Martial Arts Buff's. This is a MUST have in your collection. That is all that needs to be said.,1313884800,,109,4.0
4334638,4,B004DTLKA8,Great action and special effects. The actors are new but they pull it off. The scenery is grand and the costumes are unique.,1313798400,,124,4.434782608695652
4334639,5,B004DTLKA8,This movie kicks all sorts of ass!!! If you are ok with heavy CG action movies I recommend this highly!!,1307404800,,104,4.25
4334640,4,B004DTLKA8,"English Sub-Titles!!!! Not Dubbed!!! But, there's not a lot of dialog, so you might be able to handle it.

Wow! Great special effects. However, you need to be ready for the ""thrown into the mix with little to no idea who's who"" from the start of the movie. It really needed some setup but you can muscle through that in a matter of minutes. Now, it's your normal martial arts acting martial arts movie. So, no, there won't be a nomination for an Oscar any time in its future. But! it is awesome in the fight scenes category. For a little while I got the impression they were trying to make a Final Fantasy movie out of it, and could have easily if they wanted to.

It's a good kicka$$ movie that's quick (until the tragic lovers scenes, ughh we get it, move on already).",1304726400,2,770,4.303448275862069
4334641,5,B004DTLKA8,The blu ray disk came fast and was good quality. Great movie with nice subtitles. Only strange thing is that the special fetures and previews didn't work when clicked. It may be a due to conversion issues to north american players (watched on my PS3). But the movie played perfectly through and was great (great pictures sounds). I would buy it even knowing this minor fault.,1302912000,5,375,4.696969696969697
4334642,3,B004DTLKA8,"The movies effects, fight scenes, and the evil soldiers are straight out of 300. The soldiers are identical to the ones with the silver masks. You even get the evil lord being carried on a massive throne carried by slaves along a narrow passage in the mountains.

And these heros and bad guys can manipulate earth, water, air, and fire like Airbender. Never saw the Airbender movie, and don't plan on it either. I guess if you like the fantasy super natural type of movie with some martial arts you might like this. The effects, costumes, and set are awesome though.

Basically Japanese bad lord too powerful to defeat, only way to defeat him is to train with a more powerful master which happens to be on the dark side which agrees to train him to save China. Catch is that the evil may and does take over his good side. So after he defeats the bad lord the evil is too much for him and takes over his good side. Now his companions from before must try and get him back.

If you are a Lord of the Rings, Narnia, Airbender (cartoon) type of person you might like this movie. If you want a Kung Fu flick with just pure Kung Fu without the supernatural stuff then this may not be for you.",1299542400,7,1186,4.285714285714286
4334643,2,B004DTLKA8,"Great job on capturing the ""look"" of the comic book series (""Wind and Cloud"" aka ""Stormriders""), but too bad there's no plot, character, or action. That's right! Somehow, despite the fight scenes making up over half of this movie, they've managed to drain all the life out of them! The CGI effects look cool, but only in a movie poster sort of way. Perhaps this would be more fun as a video game. Come to think of it, I've played video games with better characterization. And better dialogue. Here, the ""dramatic"" moments consist of the characters staring intently at each other, now and then uttering something either trite or incomprehensible.

This is supposedly a sequel to ""Storm Riders"" (1998), but beyond having the same two protagonists, Wind (Ekin Cheng) and Cloud (Aaron Kwok), there's not much of a link. (""Storm Riders"", while not the bestest evar, was at least an enjoyable movie with characters, plot, and action.) Wind has mysteriously acquired a love interest (""Second Dream"") somewhere in between the movies, but it's not as if we ever know or care much about her. So, the plot, such as it is: a zero-dimensional Big Bad (""Godless"") and his son are on the brink of totally crushing China (something about finding a ""Dragon Bone"" to make their victory complete). Since the ""old guard"" heroes are either too badly wounded (""Nameless"") or have cut off their own arms to stop their own evil (""Lord Wicked""), it's up to the younger generation to get some power-ups so they can defeat Godless. This is the only part of the movie that I found even remotely interesting. Lord Wicked chooses Wind as his disciple via an amusing test to show that Wind was the kinder, gentler of the two, and has Wind take a bath in the Evil Water of Evilness, which turns him into a demon. Meanwhile, Cloud trains with Nameless, and gains new powers so awesome that there's not even a word, so Nameless invents one for him. So after we're done with the training montages, we have some more fights, some more shots of people staring at each other, more CGI fests, etc. until we finally reach the end of the movie, rip the DVD out, and wish we'd just stuck it in the microwave in the first place.",1285459200,,2185,4.645994832041343
4334644,1,B004DTLKA8,"I liked the original STORM RIDERS; it is a classic. The implication of STORM WARRIORS is that it is a sequel.  This exploitation has only the remotest connection to the original Storm Riders. Two characters are called 'Storm' and 'Cloud'.  But every aspect of this chaotic, incoherent incomprehensible mess is wrong. The subtitles
are irritatingly obtuse, seem unplugged from the action which is just senseless, gratuitous violence anyway. The few CGI effects are slick, but hysterical and meaningless. Is there a plot? I couldn't find one. Nothing makes even remote sense.

I've even sent an angry email to the seller, who should have known the kind of frantic tripe this mess obviously is. There are two other reviews, both very brief. They each give five stars, which has me wondering if Amazon should exert control over reviews. I can't say these are shills; but something is very wrong.

At least I can now say I've seen the worst movie ever made. Small consolation.",1275350400,2,971,4.938650306748467
4334645,5,B004DTLKA8,"For those weather aficionados who enjoy subpar forecasting and even better martial arts action with a hint of affluent visual effects to compliment, this is the movie/documentary for you.  At first I though this was a foreign version of the low budget shows that come on Animal Planet about those idiots chasing tornados, but this was not the same thing albeit possibly on the same budget. With the fast pace action I didn't even realize the dialog was in a completely different language, and the entire program was in a perpetual state of darkness.

The standard for stylish effects and terrible english pronunciation and acting in movies like this have been set by this film.  The return of the brothers (not blood siblings) in arms to defeat a more powerful foe and learn to better harness and increase there abilities has never been so exciting.  Who knew you had to have a mud bath prior to becoming a martial arts master at barely touching the ground when you run and sword fighting, no pun intended. The sex scenes are non-existant, cresent kick or missionary whatever, as long as theres legs in the air am I right?

For those of you who also enjoy the anime of the similar title this live action movie gives a promising possiblility for other anime titles such as bleach to be created into live action.  just because I only have 2, Two thumbs up!!",1274918400,2,1355,4.648535564853557

4334676,2,B004DTLKA8,"Storm Riders or Wind & Cloud, the first movie was much better. Although the visuals are quite beautiful and grand in this one, it was definitely trying to blatantly imitate 300 (as mentioned by other readers) to the extent where it became distracting and quite frankly, annoying.

Overall, the sequel does not live up to the great 1st film, and falls flat with a simplistic and cliched storyline, and odd pacing.",1354492800,,412,4.802816901408451

It is a basically a semi-sequel to The Storm Riders and anyone who haven't seen the The Storm Riders might be lost in knowing the main characters.

The first movie had awesome effects and for all star studded actors. These fx were in the vein of the movie 300 - slowing down time for each strike and dust... lots and lots of dust.

4334685,5,B004DTLKA8,This is like a Chinese version of Tomb Raiders.  The special effects were amazing and I wish I could see this in 3D.  The dialogue is at a minimum but enough to follow the plot. This helps when reading English subtitles by providing time to look up and enjoy the movie. The quest for the Dragon's Tomb and the supernatural results reminded me of Tomb Raiders. I've seen plenty of Asian movies with a mixture of martial arts and supernatural effects but Storm Warriors takes it to a Hollywood big box office level.
