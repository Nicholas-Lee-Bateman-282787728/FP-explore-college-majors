8733182,1,B015CVRPZO,"Mansion of Bloods plethora of characters is too much to handle, especially when the film tries to go in numerous directions that doesnt give [Director Mike] Donahues motion picture any direction. The story and script flounders as the legs are cut right from underneath both of them.
