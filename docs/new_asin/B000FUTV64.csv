2591227,5,B000FUTV64,"I remember watching Voltron as a kid, getting home from school in time just to watch my favorite cartoon. As an adult it's nice to be able to catch an episode here and there on cable. I wonder though, if they'll release this is going to be the lion Voltron series or will they release the vehicle Voltron as well?",1150070400,3,313,4.233333333333333
2591228,5,B000FUTV64,"In September 2006, Media Blasters, in conjunction with World Events Productions, is releasing Voltron: Defender of the Universe on a series of Special Edition DVD boxed sets. Each set will contain about 15 episodes, all with a newly remastered 5.1 audio (created just for this release) and remastered video.

In addition to original character sketches, TV ads, and news footage, the DVDs will contain new extras created ""with help from the original producers and staff."" This will reportedly contain never-before-seen interviews that have been previously created over the years, but never made available to the public before.

In 2007, Media Blasters is also planning to release the original uncut Japanese version of Voltron, under the original translation title ""Hundred Beast King GoLion"" and the Japan-only sequel series under the translated name ""Armored Squadron Dairugger XV"" on DVD starting next year. They both will be uncut and subtitled - which is perfect for all of the hardcore anime fans out there. We get the original series they way we remembered it, and the way it appered on Japan TV - with subtitles - plus the official 52 episode sequal series to the original Voltron (which never was released outside of Japan in any form).

Originally, ""Hyakujuu Ou Golion"" ran in Japan for 52 episodes from 1981-82, but when it was released in the USA as Voltron in 1984, the show's popularity was so immense that World Events Productions commissioned Toei Animation (the original creators) to produce 20 more episodes exclusively for the western audience. I really can't say enough positive coments about Voltron, but it had me memorised as a kid. As popular as Transformers and G.I. Joe was, it was still produced by American companies trying to make money by marketing a toy-line with an inexpensively made cartoon program. I love both of those series, but it really was the more maturely-written anime programs that had stories and animation well beyond what was available in the USA at the time. Robotech might be more fondly rememberd on the websites nowadays, but Voltron will always be what started my love affair with Japanese animation -- even though I didn't even really know what ""anime"" was back then. I hope the diehard fans enjoy this DVD collection I much as I do. I even hear a new toy-line will make some kind of appearance along with the DVD release, and a possible marketing campain from Cartoon Network themselves (who will also show the series in some form). Also, please don't confuse this release with the rather bad CGI-based 26-episode ""Voltron: The Third Dimension"" (1998) that was only produced in the USA. The failure of this ""new"" Voltron franchise brought CGI animation studio Netter Digital to bankruptcy. If you never saw it -- it wasn't the worst thing around, but it was probably for the best.",1149811200,82,2834,4.987315010570825
2591229,5,B000FUTV64,"That's great. I love this anime cartoon. Great music, except for some of the 80's songs of course:) I hope they release the whole series on DVD, and not just volume 1. It was great when it went on Super Channel back in the day, and it will be even more great on DVD. I love that they are releasing all the 80's cartoons. Woohoo!",1149292800,3,328,4.061538461538461

2591581,2,B000FUTV64,"This is the original Voltron from the mid-80s.  This was the era of the Robot for teens and tweens.  Isn't it cool?!  This is also the era where ""robots"" often stood-in for living things in cartoons and comics, so the producers / publishers could pretend there wasn't really any violence.  Hey, we're just destroying machines!  I won't comment on how little that argument holds up when you really look at child development and human-looking avatars.  Anyway, Voltron has this type of backdrop in spades.  Very 80s.

Let's be really honest, even fans of the original series should admit that it's not the best television to defend our universe.  It represents early anime at its worst.  Often ""still-image snapshots"" are assembled in jagged patterns where images ""jump"" from one picture to another.  The animation itself is somewhat poor.  It is none of realistic, surreal beauty, nor the cool excess of good Japanese anime.

Perhaps what bothers me most about Voltron, though, is that its stories are inconsistent across frames of the same episode.  Not to give spoilers, I won't offer many examples.  Here's one that shouldn't reduce your enjoyment.  Our heroes are fleeing a superior force.  Scene 1 we're see them brought safely to the planet by a tractor-beam-like device.  Scene 2, we're told they bailed out.  Scene 3, we see them crash-land.  In a matter of about 5 minutes of screen time, we have 3 plot devices for the same thing.

What is good about Voltron?

If you love Voltron or want to revisit your past, by all means do it.  This product faithfully reproduces the quality, stories, and images.  You'll likely be happy.

2591610,5,B000FUTV64,"Voltron still rules.  I really think it does.  I've loved it ever since I rented a four episode VHS tape of it (3 of which are on this set).  Imagine my surprise when it showed up on Toonami.  It quickly became one of my favorite cartoons, & it still would play in my ideal Toonami.  I know I raved about Robotech for a bit, & while that is still a very good show, I find Voltron a little easier to get into.  Maybe that's just the nostalgia talking, but I don't care.  I've searched my feelings and know it to be true.  The characters are all very appealing, the humor is very funny and the action sequences are still very exciting.  I also loved the CGI series Voltron the Third Dimension, & while it wasn't as fantastic as Beast Wars/Machines Transformers (or ReBoot or War Planets for that matter) it was still a worthy follow-up that I wish would be released on DVD.  Here's a review of all the episodes, with synopsizes from the booklet or me.

1-4.  Space Explorers Captured/Escape To Another Planet/A Ghost and Four Keys/The Missing Key:  The origin story, about how 5 space explorers were captured by King Zarkon but escaped to planet Arus, where they found the Castle of Lions and reawakened the five lions that form Voltron, Defender of the Universe.  I have to admit, that although it's a little slow in the first quarter, this is a rather good pilot all things considered.  I have to admit it's better than the Transformers pilot.  A-

5.  Princess Joins Up:  When King Zarkon's best gladiator is turned into a Robeast by Haggar, not even Voltron can stop it.  Only if Allura can find a way to help will Arus be saved.  A

6.  The Right Arm of Voltron:  Haggar comes up with a plan to get Voltron out of King Zarkon's hair for good, by killing (or at least wounding) one member of the Voltron force.  Despite the obvious editing out of a certain character's death, this is an excellent episode.  I prefer this version of events because-well, you'll understand by the time we get to Volume 4.  A+

7.  The Lion Has New Claws:  After watching the Voltron Force defend her kingdom again and again, Allura is determined to help.  However, her nanny has returned to the Castle of Lions, and is equally determined to keep the Princess out of Trouble.  When Nanny gets caught up in a raid by King Zarkon, Allura must pilot the Blue Lion to save her!  I hated the part where Allura gets spanked, but that's the only bad part in here.  A-

8.  The Stolen Lion:  The mysterious Prince Bocar appears and saves Princess Allura.  He seems to be the perfect replacement for Sven as a new pilot for the Blue Lion.  But when Lance realizes that Bocar is not what he seems, the evil prince escapes with the Blue Lion and Allura as his prisoner!  The first episode I ever saw, since it was the first of 4 episodes on the VHS tape I mentioned earlier.  It is easily one of my favorites, with of the best villains of the week.  A+

9.  A Pretty Spy:  The Voltron Force rescues a pretty girl slave who ecaped from Planet Doom.  EHunk has faith in her story, but everyone is skeptical.  That night, she breaks into the castle's ammunition storage under orders from King Zarkon and plants a deadly bomb!  This is a really good episode with a memorable Robeast battle (let's just say it was by far one of Voltron's darkest moments).  A+

10.  The Secret of the White Lion:  When a majestic white lion appears to Allura, she follows it deep into the forest, believing it to be the reincarnation of her father.  The others hurry to find the Princess before she falls into a trap.  This is one of my least favorite episodes.  From the beginning I knew it was going to be stupid.  D

11.  Surrender:  When Yurak takes a village hostage, the Voltron Force must surrender or the villagers will be destroyed.  Another pretty bad episode.  The little girl is just so annoying, but I really liked the Robeast here.  It reminds me of Skullgrin from Transformers.  D+

12.  Bad Birthday:  After escaping from planet Nemon, Jai seeks out the Voltron Force to help save his hom, which is under the thumb of Tabor, a nephew of King Zarkon.  The evil lord himself has come to Nemon to celebrate his birthday, but Voltron is coming to crash the party.
Finally a really good episode.  I always love the episodes where Voltron goes to another planet.  A

13.  The Witch Gets a Facelift:  Allura's aunt Orla ciomes to visit her, but the space mice seem to reject her, as if sensing something the others can't.  The team becomes suspicious when they spot Haggar's cat attacking the mice, but they can't do anything if the Princess doesn't believe them.
My least favorite of the ones on the tape, but it's still good.  B+

14.  Yurak Gets His Pink Slip:  King Zarkon is ready to banish Yurak for his latest failure, but then his son Prince Lotor returns from his journey of conquest.  Prince Lotor turns Yurak into a Robeast and then challenges Keith to a duel.  With Keith away from the rest of the team, they are forced to fight Yurak without the help of Voltron!  This was my favorite of the 4 episodes on the tape I rented.  This one is just epic.  Even if he got turned into a robot, they still killed Yurak.  He was one of my favorite villains in the series.  He reminded me of Goldar from Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.  He did get a much cooler death than Goldar (turning into a giant & getting killed by the heroes' robot beats getting blasted by an energy wave & getting turned to dust any day).  A+

15.  Give Me Your Princess:  Princess Allura puts the whole team in jeopardy when she tries to pilot the Black Lion without permission.  Seeing no way to make it up to her friends, she surrenders herself to Prince Lotor in exchange for the freedom of Planet Arus.  But Keith and the others have a plan of their own.  A weak episode to end the volume on.  While it's not terrible, it's not good either.  C

A good start for the series & the other sets are even better.  I give it 5 stars because the good episodes are really good & there are some real honest to God special features that took time and effort to make.

There is the original first release that comes with an embossed tin like the others in this series set where the lion head is raised up a little bit. It also comes with a quad fold insert that holds the discs and it covered with artwork and an accompanying booklet that describes the episodes and other info about the series.

It also doesn't contain the booklet that describes the episodes and other info about the series! I haven't been able to confirm this yet but I heard that the flat tins do not contain the bonus content. So, if you are a collector you might want to contact the seller and make sure you are getting the correct version! If you just want the episodes than either version will be fine.

In the special features they show you the scenes (not the whole chapter) with a big CENOSRED square...so you never get to see the scenes as we did when kids.

Another deal is the dialog. Many female voices are men pretending to be women, why not replace those lines with real ladies? Want to make it better?..thats the way to improve things the right way..my though.

I pray he will be home again in time for Christmas. If I can afford it I will be buying more for him. So for all the parents out there who have a son who loved the Voltron cartoon get this and you will see the child once again. I pray for all of our troops over seas.

It has my favorite ""Voltron"" characters, the very sneaky, Jawa-like witch, Haggar the Witch, her blue, horned cat, Coba/Cova, and King Zarkon, the evil fish-man king, the main villain of the series. This boxset has the entire Season One in it, from the first episode, where Zarkon captures the Voltron Force, to ""The Witch Gets A Facelift"", the first episode that I ever saw and my favorite episode of the entire series, where Haggar and Coba go to the Voltron Force's castle, after Haggar sneaks up to and disguises herself as Princess Allura's aunt, Queen Orla, and decides to try to kill Princess Allura and take over the castle, but the Voltron Force find out that Haggar is disguised as Queen Orla, they capture Cova, Haggar reveals who she is, attacks them and almost succeeds in getting rid of them, but King Alfor's ghost nullifies her magic, so she runs from them, the Voltron Force chases after her, she unleashes a Robeast Clawbeast, runs and hides in her flying coffin, and gets away from them after they're distracted by and then defeat the Clawbeast, to the ones where Zarkon, Haggar, and the other villains get rid of Yurak and trick the Voltron Force into thinking that Sven died. There are also a lot of special features, such as interviews/coments by the creators of and the animators of the show about their favorite characters and their favorite episodes, etc., and a few other special features, too. I love this boxset and I own it! They don't have as much of the fantastic cartoons that they used to have on TV like this, ""Thundercats"", ""DragonBall Z"", ""Pokemon"", ""Digimon"", and the many others that they had as reruns in the '90's and new shows then, too!

2591644,3,B000FUTV64,"Voltron Volume 3 is a three-disc DVD set that includes fifteen episodes of the Lion Force Voltron series.  The first two discs contain six episodes, while the third disc contains three episodes and the special features.

On this set, there are seven items in the ""Special Features"" menu.  The first is labeled, ""Exclusive Composer Interview.""  This is a roughly nine-minute interview with John Petersen, the composer of the music that appeared in Voltron.  The next feature is labeled, ""The Music of Voltron.""  This is a montage of some of the cues and themes that appeared in Voltron, set to footage from the show.  The audio portion of this feature can also be heard on the Voltron soundtrack CD.

The third feature is, ""Interview with Murphy Lee.""  The opening title card of this feature claims that rap artist Murphy Lee explains his use of Voltron references in his lyrics.  However, he never really even touches on this topic, and this roughly two-minute piece sounds like an incoherent, rambling mess.  It doesn't help that the audio quality on this feature is just awful.

The fourth feature is labeled as, ""Fan Videos.""  This whole feature runs for about six minutes, and consists for four videos.  The first three videos are fan-made animated pieces.  The last video is a music video for ""The End of Planet Arus,"" a song composed by a Voltron fan named Jason Bass.

The fifth feature is labeled as, ""Remastered Premiere.""  This four-minute feature consists of footage shot at an event to promote the DVD release of Voltron.  The sixth feature is, ""1984 News Reels & Promos.""  This consists of news stories about the Voltron mall tour to promote dental hygiene and the Voltron toys, as well as a promo piece about the Voltron Express.  The final feature on the set are trailers for other properties released by AnimeWorks.

For fans of Voltron, this set allows you to obtain more episodes of the Lion Force Voltron series for your DVD collection.

On this set, there are six items in the ""Special Features"" menu.  The first is labeled, ""Buckethead Music Video.""  This is a music video for ""Viva Voltron,"" a song recorded by Buckethead.  The video includes footage from Voltron, although some of the footage is obscured by superimposed appearances by Buckethead (and the footage of Buckethead has effects overlayed on it).  This is an interesting instrumental track, but I was rather underwhelmed by the video.

The second feature is labeled as, ""The Life & Legend.""  This is a 34-minute documentary that talks about how grueling the production schedule for Voltron was, Marc Handler provides some background on the show and its appeal, information about a live event where actors dressed as some of the characters and toured the country, the Voltron Express charity event for the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and a brief mention of the live-action film that was just in the works when the documentary was recorded.

The next feature is labeled as, ""The Toys.""  In this nine-minute documentary, several people involved with Voltron talked about the toys and various merchandise tie-ins that Voltron had.

The fourth feature is labeled as, ""T.V. Ads.""  This feature includes one English toy commercial, four or five Japanese toy commercials, and one commercial for the Lion Force Voltron television show.  When you view the ads, you have no way to select which ones you want to watch.  They all stream as one piece, in the upper corner of the screen (the rest of the screen is a border featuring Voltron toys).  Unfortunately, the quality of the audio and video on the commercials isn't the best.

Another feature on the disc is labeled, ""International Voltron.""  This feature talks about how after World Events turned Beast King GoLion into Voltron, how other international markets became interested in Voltron, and would translate the Voltron version of the property into their native language.  The opening and closing of Beast King GoLion is included, as well as some shots and scenes of Voltron in English, French, and Spanish; also, the occasional scene from Beast King GoLion would be included.

For fans of Voltron, this set allows you to obtain more episodes of the Lion Force Voltron series for your DVD collection.  Through the documentaries included on the third disc, you can also get some background information on what went on behind-the-scenes for the production of the Voltron series, as well as some background on the toys and merchandise.

2591648,3,B000FUTV64,"This three-disc box set contains the first fifteen episodes of the Lion Force Voltron series.  The first two discs each contain six episodes, while the third disc contains three episodes and the special features.

When I watched this set, I noticed on the second DVD that some of the episodes looked a little fuzzy.  This is probably due to the fact that Media Blasters had to use the best masters they could find.  While video restoration can clean up some imperfections, it can't completely compensate for a lesser-quality master tape source.  However, outside of those episodes on the second disc, the rest of the episodes looked rather decent.

There are five special features included on this set.  The first is ""Original Pilot: The Voltron Trilogy.""  This is two different versions of the pilot episode, both of which are different from what ended up being the first episode of Lion Force Voltron.  The first version of the pilot is drastically different from the final product.  The second version is a lot closer to what ended up becoming the first episode, but there are still some noticeable changes.

There are staff interviews, which help to shed some light on how the dubbing, writing, and production for Voltron was handled.  Another feature explains how Media Blasters ended up having to use the original masters from Beast King GoLion in order to put these Voltron sets together.  There's also ""Robot Chicken: You Got Robo Served,"" a segment from Robot Chicken that features the Voltron toys.

For fans of Voltron, not only can you get the first fifteen episodes of the Lion Force series on DVD, but you can also gain insight into how the Voltron series came to be.  This DVD set should really be in the collection of anyone who is a fan of Voltron.",1222819200,2,1765,4.798013245033113

2591655,5,B000FUTV64,"The Voltron Force goes green with this third installment of spine-tingling, Robeast-splitting action in a stunning emerald-green box.  Although all of these episodes are built on the same basic formula, the stories are genuinely exciting, particularly the three-part Omega Comet saga--which is probably the best adventure of the series so far.  This volume also features the return of a prominent character not seen since Volume One, and introduces Voltron's devastating lion head launching maneuver.  The Green Lion Collection contains fifteen episodes, including these suspense-filled tales:

""Attack of the Fierce Frogs"": Tired of getting hit on the head by his furious father's flying wineglasses, Prince Lotor meets with Witch Haggar (yet again) to ask the crafty crone to help him dispose of Voltron once and for all.  She responds by having one of her obedient robot guards wheel in a skull-faced aquarium full of three-eyed tadpoles.  The bad old biddy assures the Prince that these harmless-looking baby amphibians will eventually grow into ferocious purple monsters and eat the five lions for lunch.  With some degree of skepticism, Lotor descends upon Planet Arus in his spooky spaceship and releases a whole mess of the slimy swimmers into the sparkling Arusian waters, where they are soon discovered by a couple of curious youngsters who just happen to be friends of Pidge.

""Doom Boycotts the Space Olympics"": With a little help from Denny and Susie, Hunk and his Voltron teammates prepare Arus for the coming of the Space Olympics by building a giant soccer and track stadium while wolfing down a seemingly endless supply of Nanny's scrumptious shish kabobs.  Then one night, as the daunting construction project is nearing completion, a sleepless Denny leaves the safety of his bed and steps outside, where the awestruck child observes Lotor's ghastly spacecraft firing a little pink man into Hunk's mighty orange earth moving machine.  The following morning, the Voltron Force laughs off the worried juvenile's urgent warnings...until the monstrous metal constructor suddenly springs to life and barrels toward their sleeping quarters like a runaway locomotive!

""Raid of the Red Berets"": Ignoring King Zarkon's sage advice that he give up Voltron hunting and start collecting stamps, the tenacious Prince Lotor calls for his band of crimson-capped android troopers to rise up through the floor of Castle Doom's fighting arena and terrorize Zarkon's alligator men.  Next, the would-be philatelist loads his olive-clad commandos into Haggar's newest Robeast and drops them onto Planet Arus under cover of darkness.  Immediately, the stylishly dressed humanoid hoodlums go to work smashing windows and triggering power outages all across the land.  Frightened and frustrated, the ungrateful citizens of Arus storm the Castle of Lions and shout insults at a bewildered Princess Allura.

""The Captive Comet"": The first part of a three-chapter thriller begins as Witch Haggar reveals that she has discovered the secret location of the dreaded Omega Comet--a massive floating sphere with the awesome destructive power of a black hole.  While Zarkon stares at his monitor in disbelief, the beastly old bag sends a starship to Sector G-29 to surround the comet with white rings of nuclear radiation so the lethal black ball can be hurled in Planet Arus' general direction.  When the Omega Comet comes within one million hectares of Arus' verdant pastures, its far-reaching gravitons will rip the helpless planet apart in an unstoppable vortex of death!

""The Sand People"": The erudite Coran receives an S.O.S. from his old friend, Professor Sawa, on the barren Sand Planet.  It seems that the despicable sapphire-skinned Witch is planning to turn the timid and docile Sand People (not to be confused with the violent Tusken Raiders of Tatooine) into vicious desert warriors.  So, the intrepid Voltron Force is dispatched to the vast wasteland to rescue the turban-wearing Professor and protect the diminutive, beady-eyed dune-dwellers.  Soon after their arrival on the waterless planet, Pidge is involved in a Herculean struggle to free the Green Lion's limbs from a nest of colossal boa constrictors.  Meanwhile, Princess Allura has befriended the aptly-named ""Sandy"" by placing her shiny red and blue bracelet on the stubby jewelry lover's tiny wrist.

""Voltron versus Voltron"": Since Zarkon and fiends haven't done anything rotten to the good people of Yadil lately, the Yadilians naturally assume Ole Blue Face has forgotten about them.  Ergo, they decide to celebrate their newfound freedom with a big Independence Day bash featuring Voltron as the guest of honor.  The Governor sends a baldheaded boy named Bobby to Arus to deliver the official invitation to the beloved Voltron Force; but before the Charlie Brown look-alike has even passed through the electric barrier that envelops Yadil's atmosphere, Voltron has already arrived...with an escort of spaceships that look suspiciously like members of Lotor's infamous robot air force!

Collection Three's extras include an interview with John Petersen, composer of the heroic Voltron theme; and a chat with hip hop superstar and avid Voltron fan, Murphy Lee, of St. Lunatics fame, whose infectious enthusiasm exemplifies the enduring appeal of 80s-era animation...ya know what I'm sayin'?  There's also a series of fan-made animated shorts and some 1984 footage of actors dressed as Keith, Pidge and Allura warning kids in St. Louis about the evils of tooth decay.  So order your Green Lion set now, and then go brush your teeth.  Let's go Voltron Force!",1197849600,,5621,5.341269841269841
2591656,5,B000FUTV64,"The second Voltron collection celebrates the orange-clad Hunk and his blue-eyed Yellow Lion.  Inside the super neat-O tin case is another set of three DVDs on an attractive but inconvenient folding cardboard holder with a terrific illustration of Zarkon and Haggar on the back.  Overall, the episodes here are substantially better than the ones on the first set.  Although many of the plots employ the usual Witch Haggar Robeast formula, they don't seem quite as repetitious now thanks to the addition of Zarkon's endearingly-evil son, Lotor, and a few new planets (Pollux, Lyra and Tyrus), minor characters (Farla, Romelle and Bandor) and Voltron weapons (the Electro Saber and the Argon Force Field).  Like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Lion-Collection/dp/B000FUTV64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Lion Collection</a>, these discs contain a total of fifteen adventures, including these exciting classics:

""My Brother's a Robeast"": The sinister King Kova, warmongering ruler of Planet Pollux, meets with Zarkon to request that his son, Prince Avok, be transformed into a Robeast so he can crush the indomitable Voltron.  With the linking lions out of the way, Kova and Zarkon will finally be able to conquer peaceful Planet Arus and divide it between them.  Since the freckle-faced Avok is Pollux's greatest warrior, his scheming father is certain that rotten old Witch Haggar can easily mold him into the most awesomely powerful monster in the galaxy.  First, though, the pugnacious Prince must defeat Zarkon's white-haired son, Lotor, in the infamous fighting arena.  This shouldn't be too difficult to do, as Lotor is so busy staring at the beautiful blonde in the audience that he can't keep his mind on the duel.  She is Prince Avok's loyal sister, Romelle...but why does she look so much like Princess Allura?

""The Buried Castle"": Three chubby children are hiking through the lush Arusian woods when a spooky old fortress mysteriously rises from the ground beyond the trees.  Fearlessly, the young explorers approach the ominous structure as lightning bolts crackle in the sky.  They are soon joined by Pidge and one of the Princess' colorful rodent friends.  The diminutive adventurers cross the wind-whipped castle's doorstep and make their way to the treasure room.  Suddenly, bony fingers pierce the creaky floorboards and seize their tiny ankles!

""The Deadly Flowers"": Strange pink and yellow seed pods rain down on Arus and quickly bloom into fragrant flowers.  Initially, the planet's citizens are thrilled with the vast fields of pretty posies that carpet the Arusian landscape...but they soon find themselves gasping for breath before falling flat on their faces!  The only antidote for the devastating flower-bourn illness is found on Lyra, a planet known to have a strong magnetic pull that renders robotic lions inoperable.  Fortunately, Lyra's mighty magnetism is neutralized by water, and the Blue Lion was specifically designed to be driven underwater.  Unfortunately, Princess Allura, the Blue Lion's pilot, was among those sickened by the aromatic blossoms.

""Raid of the Alien Mice"": Princess Allura wishes for peace while stargazing from her picture window in the Castle of Lions.  Instead, she gets a metal-munching army of fang-faced purple space vermin, sent from Planet Doom by the haggish Witch Haggar (who else?).  It's up to Chitter and his lovable pastel-painted mice pals to stop their vicious alien cousins before they gnaw through the wires that power the Voltron Force's main computer.  Meanwhile, a serpent-headed Robeast with very broad shoulders has landed outside!

""Short Run of the Centipede Express"": While Zarkon's multi-legged spacecraft soars threateningly through the cosmos, the intrepid Voltron Force navigates the treacherous meteorite fields surrounding Planet Moura, where Lotor's latest ultimate weapon, the Doomsday Gun, is under construction.  Simultaneously, within the dark towers of Castle Doom, the lilac-skinned Prince is punishing his disobedient slaves with the help of a carnivorous alligator-man with an extra eyeball embedded in his scaly neck.

""The Treasure of Planet Tyrus"": Inside a hideous skull-faced fortress on Planet Tyrus, the cleanly Witch Haggar bathes her blue feline friend in soap bubbles and tomato-red lava liquid while Prince Lotor begins his annual birthday celebration with a relaxing massage from three lovely slave girls.  Little does the Spock-eared birthday boy know that the Voltron Force is nearby, aboard a damaged treasure ship bound for Tyrus, admiring the gigantic solid gold statue sent by dear old Dad, King Zarkon.

The Special Features this time around consist of: ""Viva Voltron,"" a music video by the masked electric guitarist, Buckethead, who is known for his KFC headwear; and a featurette entitled, ""International Voltron,"" which includes the original Japanese opening and closing songs from GoLion, plus the French Voltron theme.  Also on the third disc are some American and Japanese toy commercials, and more interviews with executive producer, Peter Keefe; director, Franklin Cofod; and story editor, Marc Handler.

2591657,4,B000FUTV64,"The Blue Lion Voltron collection comes in a totally awesome molded metal case, inside of which is a somewhat inconvenient folding cardboard digipak 3-disc holder.  There are fifteen beautifully restored episodes in all, starting with the following six classic adventures, found on disc 1:

""Space Explorers Captured"": The epic story of the Voltron Force begins as the five space explorers--Keith, Sven, Lance, Hunk and Pidge--approach Planet Arus only to discover that the once peaceful blue sphere is under attack by the fiendish forces of the cat-eyed King Zarkon.  Skyscrapers crumble and pastel-colored space mice scamper as Zarkon's indigo-skinned android army marches through the burning city streets.  Before they can fully comprehend the devastation now filling their telescanners, a massive white laser beam rushes at the explorers' spaceship from a dark spiny enemy craft.  Forced to eject to escape the explosion, the young heroes fall into the cold clutches of Zarkon's reptilian robots and land in the dank dungeon of the vulture-infested Castle Doom.

""Escape to Another Planet"": As the space explorers race towards the embattled Planet Arus in the red-bellied slave ship they appropriated from King Zarkon, they are once again forced to eject amid enemy laser blasts.  The hapless adventurers land safely in Arus' soft soil and stumble through the foggy night air until they reach the badly damaged Royal Palace.  Here they meet the mustachioed castle keeper, Coran, and the lovely blonde Princess Allura.  After judging the five strangers to be trustworthy, the initially suspicious Coran recounts the terrifying tale of how Witch Haggar's energy blast split the mighty Voltron into five mechanical lions.  Then, the Princess gives the brave warriors spiffy white uniforms and officially dubs them the Voltron Force: Arus' last hope against Zarkon's evil.

""A Ghost and Four Keys"": Frustrated with his red-monocled military commander's apparent inability to capture the Voltron Force, the pointy-eared King Zarkon dispatches a giant Robeast in a fancy flying coffin.  Meanwhile, as Yurak's forces continue their relentless assault on Arus, the diminutive and impetuous Pidge grabs his puny laser pistol and foolishly runs off to tackle the rifle-bearing robots all by himself.  So, after recovering only four of the five essential keys from the sarcophagus of King Alfor, Keith, Sven, Lance and Hunk ride the elevators leading to the legendary mechanical lions and hurry off to rescue their little nasally-voiced buddy.

""The Missing Key"": Princess Allura is reunited with her childhood friends, the space mice, and the royal beauty tells the Voltrom Force all about how the talented rodents used to slip into tiny red and white dresses and dance the cancan for her.  Meanwhile, Witch Haggar's horrible piranha-faced Robeast is fully super-charged and hungry for fillet-o-lion.

""Princess Joins Up"": King Zarkon summons his most gruesome gladiators to Castle Doom's arena for a royal rumble, and the winner goes to Haggar's tower to be transformed by her magic krypto ray into the ultimate Voltron killer.  On Arus, the indomitable lions smash through Yurak's endless supply of odd looking red and gold attack ships with alacrity.

""The Right Arm of Voltron"": As Princess Allura hosts a decadent Thanksgiving-type feast to celebrate the return of Voltron and the defeat of Zarkon's fiendish forces, the unsinkable Witch Haggar descends upon Planet Arus and orders her feral blue-furred feline friend to go at poor Sven's neck with all the ferocity of a hungry vampire!

Disc 2 is loaded with six more episodes, and the third disc concludes the set with an additional three, plus a nice selection of special features, including:

A `Birth of Voltron' documentary with Ted Koplar, president of World Events Productions; executive producer, Peter Keefe,; director, Franklin Cofod; and story editor, Marc Handler.

A `Making the DVDs' featurette detailing the painstaking process used to restore Voltron's video from the original Japanese masters and recreating all of the American edits.  Plus info on how the sound was re-mastered by using a baking process to re-melt the broken down glue of the heavy 24-track audio tapes.

The original pilot, in which Planet Arus was called Planet Nim and Castle Doom was called Darkstone Fortress.

And a Voltron-themed stop-motion animation short from the `Robot Chicken' show entitled, `You Got Robo Served.'

Although Voltron is remembered fondly by fans of 80s cartoons, I think it falls short of perfection due to its obvious repetitiveness.  The plot is basically the same in every episode: Zarkon is always upset that Planet Arus hasn't been completely destroyed yet, and Haggar always has a new Robeast ready to be sent in an elaborate red coffin to destroy the Voltron Force once and for all.  Then the good guys have to ride the elevators to their respective lions, form Volton, form Blazing Sword, and destroy the giant Robeast.  The animation is appealing, the music is appropriately heroic, and the formation of Voltron is excitingly portrayed, but the show would've benefited greatly from a little more variety.  Nevertheless, Anime Works has done a fantastic job with the DVDs, especially with respect to the cool and collectible lion tins.  So buy Voltron, but don't expect it to be as great as Robotech.

2591661,5,B000FUTV64,My husband watched this show as a kid and now has my son hooked to it.  They sit together and watch it then talk about the characters! Boys love it!,1184025600,,148,3.933333333333333
2591662,1,B000FUTV64,"This review is mainly aimed at people who, like me, watched Voltron as a kid, thought it was the greatest thing ever, and are interested in watching it again just to see if it holds up.  It is *not* aimed at hardcore anime fans, who will probably think I'm stupid, unenlightened, etc.

To those in my ""target"" audience thinking about watching Voltron again, let me just tell you--don't.  Let your happy memories live on, unspoiled, for all eternity.  Because if you watch it, you will be sorely disappointed.

I just finished watching the first disc, and I will not be watching the others, because now, with 20+ more years of . . . life, I guess, now Voltron just seems to me like one long, extended ad for toys.  Every time I hear them say ""we need all five lions to form Voltron!"", which they do, over . . . and over . . . and over again, I see little 10 year old Jimmy (which is not my name) running to Mom saying, ""Mom! I need all *five* lions to form Voltron!  I'll *die* if I can't make Voltron!""  What makes it especially crazy-driving is that it's not only the good guys, or ""space explorers"" saying we need *all five* lions blah blah, but the Evil King and his Witch also repeatedly blather on about all five lions--they REALLY want to hammer this message home to Jimmy.

In addition to my little Jimmy scenario, there are so many problems with the actual cartoons, I don't know whether to laugh or to be sad.  First, the plot is just awful, bordering on non-sensical.  The action sequences are repetitive, and also make no sense.  The characters are . . . cartoonish.  The dialogue might be the worst aspect of all, if it weren't for the music, which is so bad that it makes me want to drive metal spikes through my ears.

Now, before you go thinking I'm some kind of cynical old hater (which may be true, but doesn't mean I'm wrong about Voltron's general suckiness), let me just say that this is Act III of my nostalgic tour of 80's anime, and previous Acts were much better than this drivel.

Act I was Robotech, and much to my surprise, Robotech held up astonishingly well.  Robotech is so good, on so many levels, that even by my tired old man standards, it's still awesome.  It's possible that I think better of it now than I did as a kid, that's how impressed I am.

The thing about Robotech is that there are some themes in Robotech that are clearly meant for adults, and that were simply beyond my processing capacity as a snotty kid.  For example, the whole Rick-Lisa-MinMei triangle was incredibly annoying all those years ago--back then I wanted them to get to the battles already!--but now it's . . . well, it's kind of touching and sad.  Also, the fact that soft-power (i.e. culture and the arts) plays such a central role in the defeat of the overwhelming hard-power (5 million ships!) in the 1st Zentradi invasion . . . Seriously, there are planners at the Defense Department who should be required to watch Robotech for this reason alone.

Sure, there are problems with Robotech.  Some of the action sequences are repetitive, but not to the extent of Voltron, where there's just so much filler, I think I've worn out the fast forward button.  Some (OK, all) of the music is 80's cheesy, but there's more variety in the music, so it's not quite as bad.  But overall, the Good in Robotech greatly outweighs the Bad.

Act II was ""Inhumanoids"".  Long story short, it's meh.  M-E-H, meh.  I'm not horrified that I watched it again, but I'm not dying for more.

Anyway, this is long enough already, so let me just reiterate that if you are in my specific target group for this review, my strong advice to you is to let sleeping dogs lie.  Don't go tainting your happy memories of Voltron, like I did.  You'll be sorry if you do!",1183507200,12,3749,4.437134502923977

As everyone knows, the pilot of the Blue Lion, Sven with a black uniform, gets hurt and leaves after the first five episodes.  However, the stock scenes of the heroes entering the underground tunnels to the lions in every episode is inaccurate in this regard.  Every time, it shows a pink uniformed pilot along with the others, not a black uniformed one (Sven) as it should.  This is incorrect, since Princess Allura doesn't pilot the blue lion until much later.  Also, in the fourth episode it shows each pilot standing atop his lion.  There too, Sven is mysteriously absent and the pink princess is in his place.  This must have been a shortcut with the Japanese stock footage.",1162857600,6,731,4.8
2591699,4,B000FUTV64,"Well Voltron is back! Original Voices, music, animation...and he is totally awesome. First of all let me say Im an 80s child and well, love 70's and 80's Japanese animation (ala Robotech and Mazinger Z). This series look and sound great! Colors and sound come to life like never before! This series was supposedly reconstructed and remastered from the Japanese original series and looks fantastic.

I love this kind of anime and let me say that there has NOT been any good looking TV anime in years here in the U.S. and all the shows are for retards with no plot and ENHANCED (halfazzed) computer help. Voltron is from an era when the real animators were true ARTISTS!I highly recomend this one! I did not even know it came out till I saw it at the store last nite! and wow Im satisfied!

The only drawback on the series (and any other Original Japanese anime) is that some (very few) english speaking parts don't match the animation but is not common here so no biggie. The last CON would be that at least in the origin of Voltron some dialog don't match previous conversations (the only  example I noticed was when they trying to find a way to activate Voltron). Again these are minor flaws and hardly noticeable. All in all we waited over 20 years for these great collection...Get IT NOW!

2591700,5,B000FUTV64,"Man I have said it once I will say it again; the 1980s was the best time to be a child. We had Voltron, Transformers, GIJOE, M.A.S.K., Thundercats, Battle of the Planets aka G-Force, and many other awsome cartoons. I am glad to see many of my favorite cartoons coming out on DVDs that way I can share it wth my little cousins and my own kids when I have them. Voltron ranks up there with many of the best cartoons of the 1980s and this series is a must for anyone that wants to relive their childhood. GO VOLTRON FORCE!!!",1161216000,7,521,4.1683168316831685

2591702,1,B000FUTV64,"Sorry guys, but after all the hype that was building up to the initial release of the Blue Lion Collection here, I am extremely disappointed about the final product here.

OK, first of all I was a big fan of this show back in '84 and '85....but that was when I was only like 10 or so.  So, weigh that in with what I have to say below.

So 20+ years later, even after restoration, the animation in this series just doesn't hold up.  From the crudely animated environment to the pencil like drawings of the lions and Voltron, to the terribly animated mouth movements, the animation is just horrible compared to the 3D enhanced animation we get today in modern animated shows like Justice League and other mainstream anime series.  Oh, one note about the restoration itself.  If this is restored, I'd hate to see what it was like prior to restoration.  It still looks pretty bad, IMO.

Another thing I find disturbing is the juvenile dialogue.  Very childish dialogue on top of very childish voice-overs.  I mean it's not even funny.  It's like the scrounged the bottom of the barrel to get these actors to voice this show.  I guess I'm just spoiled now that modern animated show get some top voice actors to give life to the characters.

I bought this collection with the intention of buying the whole set, but after struggling to get through the 15 episodes, I'm not gonna waste any more of my time or money on this badly aged series.  If I may say so myself, the packaging is the only redeeming feature of this set.  Shame the series itself isn't any better.

Now, if they were to ever release the 3D CGI animated version of Voltron, I'd buy that set in an instant.  That one was for a much mature audience.  Hopefully it'll see the light of day soon.  IIRC, it was only 26 episodes or so, so a 4 disc set would catch that one.",1160352000,6,1827,4.4
2591703,5,B000FUTV64,"I've been waiting for the dvd release of Voltron - Defender of the Universe.  The copy ones on other websites don't cut it, the beautiful case and artwork makes it worth it.  The animation is clearer and smoother, hence the touchup.  A must have for Voltron fans and for people who likes animation in general, brings me back to when I was young.

Con:  The only thing bad I have to say is that I have to wait for collection 2......instead of offering all at once.  NO BIGGIE!!!!!!  I still buy it.",1160352000,4,497,4.336956521739131
2591704,4,B000FUTV64,"When I first watch Voltron when I was a little child.  I was really blown away by the Japanese animation.  I always love to watch giant robots especially from Japan.  What surprises me the most was the opening narration done by Peter Cullen better known as Optimus Prime from Transformers.  When you hear the opening narration, it makes everyone as well as Transformers fans saying,""What's Optimus Prime doing the narration on Voltron?  Isn't he supposed to be on Transformers?""  Sometimes I asked myself why Optimus Prime is doing on Voltron.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the Voltron DVD collection and it's a must for every fans who are big Peter Cullen fans in which he will reprises his role as Optimus Prime in the new Transformer movie.  In Vehicle Voltron, Peter will use Optimus Prime's voice as Commander Hawkins.  I also hope that they don't add 20 more ""new"" episodes of the Lion Force because it was SO stupid.",1160352000,4,918,4.796178343949045

Voltron - Collection Two: Yellow Lion
December 12th!

Go Voltron!",1160265600,59,1828,4.787301587301587
2591706,5,B000FUTV64,"Voltron was my absolute favorite show when I was growing up. I watched every episode, I collected the toys, and acted out portions of the show in my back yard. To say that I had high expectations for this DVD is an extreme understatement. This begs the question: does Voltron stand up to the test of time and does it measure up to the high expectations of the original fans of the show? Short answer: yes it does.

But there are some aspects of the show that are a bit dated and wear a bit thin. I watched the first few episodes with my roommate. He gave me his unbiased opinion that those episodes, ""Suck out loud."" I wouldn't put it as harshly as that, but I will say this: the show does take a while to get going. There is a lot of exposition in the first few episodes, so there's a lot of dialogue and not much action. This brings me to the second point where Voltron doesn't quite meet my expectations: the dialoge is much worse than I remember. Of course you have to remember that Voltron is basically a chopped-up edited version of the Japanese show, but still the dialoge is fairly weak and seems to run in circles at times.

But the positives for this show far outweigh the negatives. The action sequences are stunning as ever. Watching it now shows how big of an effect Voltron had on other anime and cartoons in general. Seriously, if you can make it through the exposition in the first few episodes and get to the point where the 5 lions come together to form Voltron, you'll begin to see the magic in this series. I still get the shivers every time I see Voltron form his blazing sword. The strength of this show is the action, and once you hit the 4th or 5th episode, the action really begins to roll.

This collection comes in a great collector's tin and all the packaging and booklets, etc. are just plain great. I haven't found a single thing to complain about as far as the DVD's themselves. There aren't a ton of special features on this set, but the inclusion of the Robot Chicken short was a nice tough. Visually, these episodes look as good as ever. They look better than some of the other cartoons of the day. In all, this is a great show in a great package with a decent set of features. There's really nothing to complain about.",1159920000,7,2253,4.321513002364066
2591707,5,B000FUTV64,"I'm just trying to see if this was a fluke or if it's a trend , I had major scratches on disk 2 and 3, in fact, 3 became unreadable as I watched the original pilot (which was ...well, unique to watch.) I'm hoping that I just had a bad copy sent out, and the replacement set is better.

Beyond that, It's Voltron. and I am happy.",1159747200,4,328,3.8955223880597014
2591708,5,B000FUTV64,Wow!! I can not believe the Voltron Series is now available on dvd know!! Awesome! I could remember rushing home from school to catch The Thundercats and then Voltron! The Picture Quality is Great! you can really tell that people have really put some time and effort into this reproduction. I can't wait until season two gets delivered to my house!! Don't wait. Order it Now.,1159747200,2,375,4.696969696969697
2591709,4,B000FUTV64,"This is by far, one of the best little DVD sets I've come to own.  I have fond memories of Voltron, but it was incredibly exciting sharing it with my kids now, who are fortunate enough to be able to watch some of the ""staples"" of animation history in the early 80's.  They dig it, and really got into the first few episodes, which was illuminating in its own right, to see how Voltron came about.

The DVD's are well put together, great restoration process and clever packaging.  However, I think thus far the DVD extras are fairly crude.  They have an ""amatuer"" kind of feel to them, and though occassionally there is a bit of good information given, for the most part, the extras are fairly weak, and poorly produced.  but, for the most part, I don't care, it is the series itself that is great.

Add it to your collection, it is worth it.  Though, if your hoping there is a gold mine in the ""extras"" you will be venomously disappointed.",1159488000,2,939,4.38728323699422
2591710,5,B000FUTV64,"I would probably pay twice what they're asking. No, that's not a hint to the corporations to charge more, just that other old cartoon series on DVD often go for more and you get less. A lot less. Voltron has been painstakingly restored for the fans, and the fans all agree that this is as good as it gets. The picture is clearer than it ever was, thanks to the re-cutting of the Go Lion footage, the audio fantastic in 5.1 surround, and the extras are fun and informative. Even the packaging is fun, and not too tedious. This is one of my all time favourite shows from when I was a kid. I find it not just nostalgic, but still entertaining for me to watch as an adult, and now I've got my son hooked on it as well. While I know the genre has taken a turn towards graphic violence and innuendo, the creators of Voltron worked very hard to cut that stuff out. I'm not a fan of censorship, but in this instance it works and it's fun to have such an entertaining show that appeals to my young son.",1158883200,5,993,4.150259067357513
2591711,5,B000FUTV64,"First of all, my apologies to Amazon...I had this item preordered and then I cancelled my preorder today when I was able to get a copy from a national electronics chain with a price tag for a logo...TWO WEEKS SOONER THAN AMAZON WAS GOING TO GET IT!!

The packaging is great...Just one look at the tin with the head of the blue lion on the front and Princess Allura on the back shows just the surface of what is inside.

The episodes are just about as you remember them, just better looking.

Hardcore fans will notice certain minor things that are different, but they are just minor.  One of those items is that the on screen fonts used for scene locations and the end credits are totally different than the original shows...There is a reason for that.  If you watch the ""making of"" DVD feature on disc three, you will see that Media Blasters had to go to Toei Animation in Japan to get a new digital copy of the original animation film since the World Events Productions broadcast copies were to ""blurry"" to even work with.  What this means is that MB recreated each scene frame by frame, matched it up with the audio tracks, and rebuilt each episode practically by hand to give us the best experience ever.

Someone over on the Voltron.com message boards posted side by side comparisons of the new US release and a Aussie DVD release in terms of picture quality, and the US release is hands down the best.

I can't wait for the next volume to come out later this fall as well as the eventual subsequent releases of the rest of the Lion Voltron series, Vehicle Voltron and the Japanese originals of GoLion and Armored Squadron Dairugger XV

2591715,5,B000FUTV64,"While I am looking forward to this release, I have to point out that Jason Dodge'e review was just slightly erroneous. Although GoLion WAS the original Japanese series from whch the Lion Force Voltron series came, DaiRugger XV WAS seen outside of Japan, it was the OTHER Voltron (Vehivle Team). I'm glad we're getting Lion Voltron, and BOTH GoLion & DaiRugger XV in in their original forms with subtitles,(if this information is accurate) but I hope we also get the entire Vehicle Voltron series, as well as well as the 20 extra episodes WEP made for Lion Force (aka ""season 3""). And there's also the tragic ""Voltron 3rd Dimension"", a nice attempt at a revamp, but ultimately failed, still as a completist I'd still purchase it. Also it seems that the mysterious 3rd Voltron, which never was translated (known as Albegas in Japan), will finally get some explanation, and if anyone in charge is reading this, PLEASE PLEASE an official DVD release as well.",1154649600,6,954,4.823170731707317
