3883225,1,B002A58ZR8,"This movie is a ripoff of Pixar Up & Monsters Vs Aliens. The story was lame, the animation was crappy and the voice acting is boring. They should be ashamed of themselves for making this crappy ripoff. SAVE YOUR MONEY WHEN PIXAR UP COMES OUT ON DVD!",1255824000,2,249,4.319148936170213
3883226,2,B002A58ZR8,"If you can get past your anger at this not being Pixar's ""Up,"" (and really, if you were fooled, you've only got yourself to blame) there's actually a fairly enjoyable terrible movie in here.

3883227,1,B002A58ZR8,"I can't believe this rip-off movie is legal. This is NOT the 2009 movie ""Up!"" by Disney / Pixar. Instead, this is an awful rip-off created by a Brazilian company V&iacute;deo Brinquedo and created with a cover and theme which so closely resembles ""Up!"" to be nearly identical in many ways. If you look at the other movies this Brazilian company has put out it is clear they are in the deliberate business of stealing other peoples' movies in order to get quick cash. For example, when Ratatouille came out (a cute movie about a rat in France being a chef) Video Brinquendo promptly came out with Ratatoing with a very similar theme. If any US company tried this kind of activity I have no doubt the lawyers would be almost immediately knocking on their door.

Even worse, for me, this movie is being distributed in the US by Gaiam. Yes, Gaiam, the yoga-products company which promotes respect and healthy support. I was so aghast by this idea that I contacted Gaiam directly to find out if they really were promoting this DVD or if I'd made a mistake somehow in researching the DVD. They acknowledged that they are the ones actively promoting and selling the What's Up DVD in the US. So Gaiam, which I have supported for MANY years and had great respect for, is actively pushing what I consider to be plagiarized material. That upsets me to the point that I'm divesting myself of my Gaiam products, ceasing my promotions of them and of course speaking out against this DVD. I want to make sure NOBODY is fooled into buying this product thinking it is the ""Up!"" movie. It is NOT.",1251590400,22,1578,4.556338028169014
3883228,1,B002A58ZR8,"If you buy this product, you just got ripped off. This is a cheap Brizillian rip-off of the Pixar film ""Up"". Unlike the inspiring tale ""Up"", this movie is a pure poop. It is as original as plagerism and as enjoyable as cancer.
Really $13 for this piece of %^&*. I can think of a million things you can buy instead of this.
If you like this, you might also enjoy ratatolong (about secret agent rat chiefs stealing receipies), little cars, little bee movie, little panda fighter (about a panda who wants to be a ballerina and a boxer).

3883230,2,B002A58ZR8,"My coworkers and family members with children ranted and raved up Disney's Up, so I purchased it for our family to view. Unfortunately, I was far from impressed. The quality of Disney animation has really gone down these days.

3883237,5,B002A58ZR8,"This film was overlooked. Why, my mind was blown. It was funny, touching and educational. When that monster attacked the Eiffel Tower, not only did I learn the whole French language, but I also discovered 'Google', which has made my whole life much better. Before Google I was reduced to typing random addresses into Netscape Navigator, and hoping I'd get the page I wanted.
I really relate the monster character to King Kong, and how he was brutally defeated by man, who should have realised it was their fault all along. The fact that the monsters ended up enslaved and probably made to do 'favour' for the family really hits home the issue of monster abuse in the 21st century. Ever since mad scientist started creating monsters for entertainment purposes, we've seen them so badly treated in many forms of media.
The best part was when the Robot Unicorns attacked, once and for all defeating the monster, and there was a big party featuring Erasure.
I would totally recommend this film. Don't waste your money on the Disney one.",1298073600,16,1032,4.770949720670391

8358909,1,B002A58ZR8,"A cheap Ripoff! Another title that is designed to fool unsuspecting grandparents.
Video Brinquedo may have made one good movie but it cannot cover for the multitude of crimes known as What's Up Balloon to the Rescue and the infamous Ratatoing and much more. I saw this movie and like most Video Brinquedo garbage the animation is terrible. The voice actors are phoning in their performances. The English dub cast has talent but they are obviously not giving it their all. I don't blame them. I wouldn't waste my talent on this warmed over garbage either if I were a voice actor. The story this movie has is so stupid that I barely remember it nor do I care. This movie would be cruelty to children. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.

I have to say though that she and her college friends really got a kick out of how bad this one was. They probably laughed more at this than many movies designed to be comedies. Worth the few dollars just for that.",1467072000,5,803,6.169642857142857
