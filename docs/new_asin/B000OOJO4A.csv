Her vocals will capture your heart as she sings with such emotion.  Her dances and choreography are breathtaking to watch.  There is no other performer with dance skills like hers.  Heavenly influenced by her idol Michael Jackson, she uses a lot of his signature moves but still making them her own.  You cannot help but love this girl.  And I have never seen a performance where she disappoints.  She is the hardest working artist I've ever seen.",1289520000,,572,4.584158415841584
8594127,5,B000OOJO4A,"Whew! After buying the MADE IN 20 album, I've had a deep desire to buy this full concert DVD that marks the milestone where Boa Kwon comes of age.  She surely knows how to whoop it up for her homeland fans without even knowing she could possibly have some American fans as well.
BOA THE LIVE delivers moments of soulful content with ballads and funky confections like ""Brand New Beat"", ""Valenti"", ""Love Song"", ""Winter Love"" and of course, ""Lady Galaxy"".  Still, I prefer to watch this show with the sound off; No offense.  However, it's still a great Korean import in case any American wants to learn Korean, which I may end up doing in the future.  You won't be disappointed.",1229817600,,676,4.56198347107438
