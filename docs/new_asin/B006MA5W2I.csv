8500641,3,B006MA5W2I,"King of Triads also known internationally as Bad Blood is another film directed by Dennis S.Y Law(Fatal Contact,Fatal Move, Vampire Warriors).King of Triads stars Simon Yam(Ip Man,High Risk),Bernice Liu(Legend is Born Ip Man,King of Fighters),Andy On (Black Mask 2,True Legend),Ken Lo(Circus Kids,Legend of Drunken Master)

A group of Triad members escape from prison,they have a valuable item for counterfeiting money. One of the members Andy Lok gets hit by a police truck and is arrested. In fear of his life Andy testifies and informs his daughter Audrey Lok(Bernice Liu)about his plan. The other Triad members are now fighting for power to see who will become the next boss. Audrey has a half brother,Andy Lok(Andy On) who manipulates him to take out the members one by one so they can both have control of the gang.

The story is probably one of the worst,most laziest put to film. The only saving grace about this movie is that there is lots of Hong Kong actors that are new and old. Chan Wai Man is one of the senior members and he has not stopped making movies ever since the early 70s. Ken Lo which is mainly known as the baddie in Drunken Master 2 also puts out some good kicks. The action was directed by Jet Li stunt double and veteran Hong Kong actor Hung Yan Yan. You can see the effort and the great editing and shots that are put in this movie. Andy On is one of the youngest stars and his moves are amazing for not being a martial artist. This movie was also to promote newcomer Wushu champion Jiang Lu Xia of Coweb. There is all type of fighting from weapons,hand to hand,guns. Sadly the director focuses more on the villians which are extremely weak compared to the heroes,and that's why the movie is not at all succesful. Just like his other movies like Fatal Move,Fatal Contact. If you have seen those two you know the endings are not very happy. Unless you are aware of these martial arts actors I recommend you get King of Triads aka Bad Blood. If you do not know who these actors are,you will be very let down. Rent it first.",1350432000,2,2050,4.5528455284552845
8500642,1,B006MA5W2I,"There are great martial arts films, there as so so martial arts films and there are the truly bad martial arts films that make fans turn their DVD discs into shuriken. KING OF TRIADS falls into that last category. Try as I might I wanted to write something at least respective of those involved but I couldn't do so.

Taking place in present time a gang leader dies and leaves his empire to his two children. But this doesn't set well with members of the gang who pretty much run things on their own, trying to take money and power from the siblings. Little do they realize who they're dealing with. And that about sums up the plot for this movie.

Yes, there is a twist in the story that I won't spoil here for those who want to take the time to watch every martial arts film ever made, but it's not much of a surprise twist and it's not that satisfying as well. I'm not student of the genre but I've read reports that many of the stars in this film are some of the best in martial arts films but highly underused here. I don't think that's difficult to believe.

A few of the action sequences are well done with a several decent fight sequences. But on the whole this film leaves a lot to be desired. Perhaps there was much lost in translation when this film was dubbed but my guess is that's not the reason I didn't enjoy it that much. With the number of really good martial arts films out there to be seen from the classics to new releases, my advice would be to pass this one by. Short review? Yep it is but then something like this deserves it.",1339977600,2,1550,4.212121212121212
8500643,3,B006MA5W2I,"I gave this movie a shot because of the trailer. It's an overall cliche premise that deals with the families in the Chinese Triads. I have to say that the story is pretty disappointing. It begins to jump all over the place and it doesn't explain the purpose of the individuals fighting to become the head of the family.

The martial arts choreography was the only good thing about this film. The talent in martial arts was high. Very fast and agile practitioners. It almost makes up for the rest of the movie, but it's not quite there.

At best, it's a rental or a bargain bin purchase.",1334534400,,586,4.416666666666667
8500644,1,B006MA5W2I,"I expected so much more from this movie and it just was not there at all.  If you just wanted to watch the choreographed martial arts and sword play in it you MIGHT find it somewhat interesting but even that strains credibility for instance when the lead female character pulls a knife out of someone's stomach and there is not a drop of blood on the blade...HUH???  The plot was seriously lacking, the acting was sub par, the characters were one dimensional, the directing was terrible and I cannot imagine why I watched it all the way to the end. Definitely a B movie.  Save your time and watch something else, if you must watch it rent but definitely don't buy it.",1330646400,4,667,4.450819672131147
