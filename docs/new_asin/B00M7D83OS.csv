8670541,4,B00M7D83OS,Laid back leading man Warren Douglas is always watchable as is Ramsay Ames when she gives a good performance as she does here. This is a well made low budget Monogram crime film that is just fine as a b&w 1940's movie. Thats all it is and thats all it tries to be- it works for me.,1492905600,,281,3.9473684210526314
8670542,4,B00M7D83OS,"It's a 1946 crime film, while Below The Deadline (aka Jumping Joe) isn't a classic, it should not be judged in the categories of the more high budgeted noirs.

it serves its purpose.

Joe Hilton returns to find his brother has been whacked and he goes for revenge.

8670543,2,B00M7D83OS,"Director William ""One Shot"" Beaudine strikes again with this disposable Monogram crime drama. A serviceable cast and short running time helps, but ""Below the Deadline"" (1946) remains wholly deserving of its obscurity. The Warner Archive DVD offers a better-than-average transfer.",1421280000,2,279,6.0
