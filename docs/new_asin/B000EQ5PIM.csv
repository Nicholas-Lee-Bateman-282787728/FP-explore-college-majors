8112990,1,B000EQ5PIM,Truly awful. No substance at all. Don't waste your $3.99.,1494633600,,57,4.8
8112991,1,B000EQ5PIM,This is a poorly done re-cap of the movie,1462233600,,41,3.6666666666666665
8112992,1,B000EQ5PIM,"This 'documentary' was terrible. No substance at all, stock photos and pencil sketches of movie stars, including , incredibly, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the mayor of California, (according to the narrator). It did not not touch on any of the interesting aspects of the book or movie. The only amazing thing about this was that the writer was able to fill an hour and twenty some minutes apparently without doing any research on the subject.",1396396800,,437,5.0
8112993,2,B000EQ5PIM,"This dvd is basically, as described in part of the description, a video tour. Nothing related to Da vinci's code is talked about in depth, as the narrator is constantly saying ""without revealing too much"" and will continue to talk about the building or city. Although there were a couple of interesting facts, I was very disappointed because it's very boring and the back round music put me to sleep twice, that's saying alot for me.

To add to your collection for the few bucks it is - I say go ahead.",1170115200,,502,4.456521739130435
8112994,5,B000EQ5PIM,"If you like the movie and book, I think you will like this documentary as well. It's very informative and at a great price!!",1149552000,,124,4.208333333333333
