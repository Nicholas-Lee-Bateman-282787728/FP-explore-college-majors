8462032,2,B0058OR3OO,Very little substance and do not think there was remotely enough to compel any type of video. Just endless dialog going really no where.,1383782400,,136,4.708333333333333
8462033,5,B0058OR3OO,"Were I a ghost, I would live in the anchor pub. What a cool place to haunt! Anyway, this was beyond entertaining & quite spooky. The ghost hunters are all quite the characters, but this (unlike a lot of big budget Hollywood ""ghost hunter"" shows) was actually believable.",1374969600,,270,4.645833333333333
8462034,5,B0058OR3OO,Ghost hunting in England is explored here. for whatever reason I feel like you'd be more likely to find a ghost there just about anywhere. I thoroughly enjoyed this program.,1374710400,,173,4.8
8462035,4,B0058OR3OO,"I got hooked on paranormal stuff after having watched a bunch of the shows on cable. This is right up there with that stuff, probably better actually. Some cool ghost hunting action.",1362355200,2,182,4.71875
