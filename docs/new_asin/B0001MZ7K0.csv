2017730,2,B0001MZ7K0,"I've been watching Adult Swim shows for years. There are some I like more than others. I enjoy Futurama, Venture Bros, and Harvey Birdman. I'll even watch Aqua Teen Hunger Force now and again. I rented this DVD since it seemed similar to Birdman. However, unlike Birdman, it's very slow-paced and somewhat dull, with very little visual gags to liven up the otherwise very standard 70s animation look.

I'll admit, I only watched the first two episodes. Even at 11-15 minutes each, though, I was bored enough to shut it off after that. None of the jokes struck me as particularly funny, and each episode moved along at a snails' pace. The characters like to go off on tangents, which could be amusing, but just didn't work for me. The sealab itself was destroyed at the end of both episodes, so presumably this happens frequently, with obviously no continuity between episodes. Maybe the show gets more interesting as it goes along, but suffice to say I'm not interesting in finding out.

If you like watching random people stand around and say random and sometimes racey things, than you'll like Sealab. If you need a little more going on in your TV shows, try out ""The Venture Bros"" or ""Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law"" instead.",1290988800,,1229,4.738317757009346

2017733,2,B0001MZ7K0,"Let it never be said that Sealab 2021 was not funny.

It is very funny, and like Space Ghost Coast to Coast and other similar ""Adult Swim"" shows, it has perfected the art of using crude sarcastic randomness overlaid upon earnest-looking 70s art to make you laugh. (I have come to think this is kind of a cheap trick.)

But that's pretty much all it does. There's no interesting story, just the most bizarre sequence of unrelated events you can imagine. The jokes are not particularly smart, they just consistently hit that sweet-spot of randomness. The characters usually all die in every episode, preventing any plot progression or consistency. There's no original music to speak of save the catchy theme song. The animation reflects a clear minimum of effort.

In conclusion ""Sealab"" is funny, but it is devoid of other entertainment-value content. So in my personal view it is 2 stars, it's entertaining, but not really worth watching.",1186704000,6,938,4.924050632911392
2017734,5,B0001MZ7K0,Sealab 2021 is one of the funniest cartoons I've ever watched. Narrowly edged out by Earthworm Jim. This DVD has some great episodes - Lost in Time stands out as the most side-splittingly hilarious. Definitely worth the money.,1171324800,,226,4.973684210526316

2017736,5,B0001MZ7K0,"Sealab 2021, a show making fun of a short lived show back in the 70s, is like Cartoon Planet but with Sealab. A show that lasted for 4 years and passing the number of episodes of the original show. This and the second season were the best (and I never saw any episodes in the 3rd, 4th or 5th seasons) ones. Who couldn't forget the great, psychotic and racist Captain Murphy? or the innocent Dr. Quinn? or the idiot known as Stormy Waters? This had great episodes like Happy Cake Oven or When Captain Murphy was crushed and trapped under a soda machine and having a scorpion as a pet and giving him venom to live. also includes I, Robot, the episode where everybody except Dr. Quinn talk about being a robot, and Stimutacs. Recommended for Adult Swim fans and anybody else.",1155081600,,772,4.443661971830986
2017737,4,B0001MZ7K0,"Sealab 2021 is one of the best cartoons I've ever seen, and season one is best of all for three reasons.

Firstly the original show was made using stolen material.  When Adam Reed and Matt Thompson were fired from Cartoon Network in 1995 they stole the cells of Sealab 2020 (an old television that was in the vein of Clutch Cargo and a lot of other mid-50's and early 60's Hanna Barbera action shows) and made a short entitled ""Gert"" still utilizing the Sealab name (This ""Gert"" Pilot is available on the Sealab Season 3 DVD).  Later that year or early the next year they produced the superior, but still independent bare-bones cartoon Pitch Pilot for $12.00 (Available on this Season One DVD set) which they submitted and later sold to Cartoon Network - the same place they stole the original animation from!

Secondly this has the strongest plots of the seasons of Sealab.  Although the show relies on a lot non-plot derived comedy, fairly similair to Family Guy, Season One is definitely full of the strongest and funniest stories and gags.  The insanity ranges from a Predator rip-off in the aptly named episode, ""Predator"", to Howlin' Mad Captain Murphy launching his own pirate radio station in the now legendary ""Radio Free Sealab"".  This season is centered around Captian Murphy and his interaction with the crew, which brings me to the third reason that this is the strongest season of Sealab.

Harry Goz... Harry, what can you say about the voice of Captian Murphy?  He was a comedy genious.  So much so that the entire first season pretty much relies on what I've come to call the Muphy Pause.  Essentially an uncomfortable silence that results from some random insane quip that silences anyone who hears it.  Unlike the characters on the show though, the Murphy Pause leaves you rolling on the floor laughing.  The way that Harry is able to play off the madness of his character and channel it into pure comedy genious is beyond me.  Since most of the episodes from season one center around Capt. Murphy you can't go wrong!  Murphy transforms into the Hulk(""All That Jazz""), nearly get's the crew of Deep Diver mauled by a Giant Squid(""Happcake""), has Sealab decorated and subsequently nearly destroyed by a floatin', flyin', light glowin' kung-fu fightin' karate Feng Shui Master (""Feng Shui Master"").  Not to mention forgeting his lines as we travel behind the scenes of Sealab 2021 and meet the cast in the fabricated 'real lives' of the actors on Sealab(""Swimming In Oblivion"").

  Unfortunately the discs are over-priced.  Although Season One contains the best episodes of the entire series, this set has the worst special features.  At eleven minutes an episode, eight episodes when encoded as nicely as these are, and they are beautifully mastered (even my father who had never seen the show and where's coke bottle glasses commented on how good the show looked) does fill up a DVD.  This explain the second DVD but it doesn't explain the lack of special features.  In the later seasons they've included bonuse episodes and offered commentary on episodes.  But the second DVD contains only one real special feature, The Pitch Pilot.  This is only for serious die-hard Sealab collector's.  Not even the fans, you won't be a fan of this episode, I assure you of this.  They do preface the episode by saying it stinks, but this episode is so bad I can not watch it.  I did one time, and I probably won't ever again (It's not as bad as the ""Gert"" Pilot but it's awful ayways).  The only other special features are an alternate ending SCENE from, ""I, Robot"" and an uncensored end SEQUENCE that ran during the credits of ""Radio Free Sealab"".  Unfortunately the scene is funnier the way that they showed it on Cartoon Network, with the censor beeps left in.  The lame alternate ending to ""I, Robot"" isn't very funny either though it was a little funnier that the original.  Not much.  The price is high but this is such a funny show it's definitely worth it, I promise.",1154822400,2,3981,4.756559766763848
2017738,2,B0001MZ7K0,"It's easy to laud Sealab 2021 as a clever parody of classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons.  Just as Venture Bros. parodies adventure shows and classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons.  And Space Ghost Coast-To-Coast parodies talk shows and classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons.  And Harvey Birdman parodies legal dramas and classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons.  And the Brak Show parodies family sitcoms and classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons.

Cartoon Network and Adult Swim spend a lot of time parodying classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons, because that is much easier than creating new cartoons, like Samurai Jack (by far the best show ever produced by CN) which involve original animation and thoughtful scripts.  It's cheaper and more profitable to recycle 40-year-old animation and characters, and to wrap it in self-awareness with a post-modernism cherry on top.

95% of people who watch Sealab 2021 have probably never seen Sealab 2020; if they did, I think they'd be surprised to see how decent 2020 was. Sure, maybe it wasn't so in-your-face with blatant ""look how clever we are"" content as 2021.  It had loftier goals -- it sought to teach kids about the sea and to do it with cool Alex Toth character and vehicle designs.

Maybe the result didn't set the world on fire, but it was a decent show for 1972, and it can surely be said that there was never an animated program before or since that was quite like it.

Meanwhile, Sealab 2021 has numerous identical shows preceding it and following it on Cartoon network seven days a week.",1153267200,7,1508,5.068825910931174

I bought this not realizing what I was getting.  I thought I'd be getting the original Sealab 2020 (not catching it was 2021, initially).

Sealab 2021 is hilarious in its own way. It has basic jokes and alot of take offs of different things. It also has many intellectual jokes about modern societies issues. What I like best about Sealab is that it is so creative. The story never follows the next one and is always changing yet the characters are always themselves. ""Waking Quinn"" is a prime example of the originality and awkward humor of Sealab 2021. Dr. Quinn keeps getting electrocuted and having strange dreams and transformations. The best part in this episode is when it goes to Captain Murphy and Marco and its a scene of them talking using lines from the novel ""Heart of Darkness"" or the more known ""Apocalypse Now"". That blew me off my seat I was laughing like crazy. Moreover, this dvd is a valuable asset to... I suppose....an open minded individuals dvd collection.",1116115200,4,981,4.611428571428571
2017744,5,B0001MZ7K0,"Let's face it: Sealab 2021 isn't for everyone. Either you ""get"" this brand of bizarre, off-the-wall comedy or you don't. The series' style of humor tends to be juvenile, but fortunately without routinely stooping to body humor or bathroom jokes. Most episodes are peppered with hilarious cultural references. In fact, in its own way ""Sealab"" is really smart TV-- one of those shows that you can watch over and over, and continually pick up on things that you missed in previous viewings.

Season One is probably the most solid of the ""Sealab 2021"" compilations on disc.  You won't find an episode on this collection that isn't funny for one reason or another, although some episodes are clearly more memorable than others!  My take on the individual episodes:

I, ROBOT- As disaster looms over Sealab, the crew seems more preoccupied with discussing what would happen if their brains were placed in robot bodies... robot bodies with the strength of ten gorillas! (A+)

HAPPYCAKE- The captain's 'Happy-Cake Oven' is stolen, and members of the crew are sent on a suicide mission to retrieve this vital equipment. (A)

RADIO FREE SEALAB- Captain Murphy launches a pirate radio station, much to the chagrin of the FCC. (A)

CHICKMATE- Debbie's biological clock is ticking, and the guys are eager to offer their biological services. You get the drift. (A-)

LOST IN TIME- Stormy and Dr. Quinn fail to save Sealab from an explosion, which catapults them back in time. Using their knowledge of the future, they attempt to save Sealab a second time... and fail again, sending them back in time once more. And so on. (A)

PREDATOR- There's a hungry intruder on the station. Can it be stopped in time? Don't forget to use Dolphin Boy as bait. (B+)

LITTLE ORPHAN ANGRY- A dying child's last wish is to visit Sealab. Oh, and also to rob the place blind. Did somebody say this kid was sick? (B+)

WAKING QUINN- The most bizarre episode in Season One. Dr. Quinn is electrocuted, and most of the episode consists of his flashbacks and frenzied hallucinations. (B-)

ALL THAT JAZZ- Captain Murphy is trapped under a fallen vending machine while the crew is on an extended vacation. Just how long can the captain survive on Be-Bop Cola and scorpion venom? (A+)

MURPHY MURPH AND THE FENG SHUI BUNCH- Captain Murphy hires a Feng Shui master (can you say 'con artist?') to redecorate Sealab. Time to get rid of life support and all that other useless junk. (A-)

IN THE CLOSET- The entire crew gets locked in a storage closet, where the only way to pass time seems to be knocking each other unconscious. (B-)

STIMUTACS- Sparks creates a new drug... er, dietary supplement... and the rest of the crew just can't seem to get enough of it! (A+)

SWIMMING IN OBLIVION- An animated ""behind the scenes"" look at the set and cast of Sealab. This is also the first time you see the infamous ""Debbie Does Wild"" video. (B-)",1115337600,6,2895,4.748502994011976

Adult Swim was sort of hard to catch, and if you were gonna miss Sealab you were gonna miss it because the episodes were only 15 min including commercials.  Now I can see them whenever I want.  The 2 disk set is at a good price for 13 episodes, but other reviewers aren't wrong when they say that it's a waste of space.  There are 4 bonuse features.  Deleted scenes for Little Orphan Angry, Alternate endings for I, Robot, the Pilot Pitch which was previously unreleased (it's a miracle that Cartoon Network bought Sealab after viewing the pilot) and Radio Free Sealab Uncensored, which I haven't watched yet, but I'm guessing what it's going to contain, and it should be a riot.  I know there aren't many bonuses, but this show is so good, and it's a great price, so just get it even if you've never seen it before.  I can't wait till Season 2.",1103587200,,1001,4.372972972972973
2017750,5,B0001MZ7K0,"This show renewed my faith in cartoons. To take such a simple, ugly cartoon and make it so amusing is impressive. My first episode was ""Waking Quinn,"" and after watching it, I thought, ""These guys need to be noticed, this is great work."" This bizarre, existential comedy is not, as some say, a cartoon made for/by stoners. There are so many insane allusions and such a sick sense of doom, much like our own world- it is truly post-modern art in every respect. I am only familiar with the first season. I have heard that the other seasons grew worse, and of course, Goz is dead, and this is truly heartbreaking, considering how humorous he was, and how old he was. He obviously didn't take this world seriously.",1103068800,2,710,4.5546875
2017751,5,B0001MZ7K0,"I've seen Adult Swim Since the beginning in 2001, back when Home Movies, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Sealab 2021, and Space Ghost ruled the latenight program. I saw the very first episode of each Adult Swim show and the first episode of Sealab 2021, ""I, Robot"", really stood out. I love each classic episode and My favorite was ""Radio Free Sealab"". Aqua Teen Hunger Force makes a cameo appearance in one of the episodes included in this boxed set. It's a must have for any Adult Swim fan.",1101859200,,484,4.511363636363637
2017752,5,B0001MZ7K0,"Sealab 2021 is one of the funnier animated shows on tv. The poor quality animation only adds to its charm (much like South Park). The writing and voices are brilliant. This set contains 13 episodes (Stimutax being my favorite) that you will never forget. It is a little weak on the extras, though the pitch pilot is included (and boy is it awful). I don't quite understand why they needed to use two discs because I think all of this would have fit nicely on just one. Or perhaps they should have given us more extras.",1101600000,,518,4.40625
2017753,5,B0001MZ7K0,"When I first saw commercials for Sealab 2021, I had little to no interest in watching an episode.  Enter the joy of DVR, that lovely cable box that records whatever you'd like.  I accidentally taped an episode when I was setting it for some other Adult Swim programming - and thank goodness I did!!!

The first episode I saw was ""Hail Squishface,"" which, unfortunately, is not on Season One.  It was the most random insanity I have ever seen.  I can't even explain it without doing it a great injustice - it's just that bizarre.  The quote that cinched my love for the show: ""good luck finding an ass that tastes like candy!""  What the hell, you're thinking???  EXACTLY!

Season One is full of ridiculous situations, most of which involve the destruction of the Sealab and its crew.  Don't worry - they come back unharmed episode after episode... never learning their lesson... always on some incredibly self-centered and insane rampage!  The first episode, ""I-robot,"" is basically just the sealab arguing about what kind of robot powers they will have if they were to put their brains into a robot... as this is happening, the entire sealab is malfunctioning and, thus, blowing up.  The second episode, ""Happy Cakes,"" is all about the captain's love for his easy bake oven, which a crewmember has tossed out onto the ocean floor (but not before rigging the on-button with explosives...).

I cannot express enough the sheer randomness of the show.  It is hilarious.  I highly recommend this to anyone whose sense of humor appreciates the absurd, or for anyone who giggles when old 70s cartoon characters say, ""good luck finding an ass that tastes like candy.""",1099353600,7,1659,4.833333333333333
2017754,5,B0001MZ7K0,"If you grew up watching the original ""serious"" version of this cartoon (Sealab 2020), be warned that this is nothing like that! The language and humor is very adult in nature, something like a comic that might have appeared in National Lampoon years ago. The situations are bizarre, the characters are single-mindedly idiotic and the animation is low-budget and crappy and all of those things combined make this one of the freshest funniest things to appear on television in a very long time. The first time I saw this show I laughed so hard my eyes watered and when I checked out other episodes after that I found many of them to be equally funny.

A large number of Sealab episodes seem to revolve around a character operating on a single completely fallacious or extreme premise, wreaking havoc on everyone and everything around him (or her) in the process. Examples: Captain Murphy declares ""Martian law"" (as opposed to martial law), Debbie decides she must have a baby NOW, and so on. Mayhem ensues when most of the other intensely strange or stupid characters decide to follow the misguided character down their oddly chosen path. Conflict is generated when one character, usually the ""smart"" Dr. Quinn, dissents against the twisted behavior of the others. Of course, he's only smart compared to the rest of the crazy bunch. In one episode, Quinn chooses sex over reactor repairs and allows the nuclear reactor to melt down and destroy Sealab in the process.

This show will have you aching with laughter. Highly recommended.",1099353600,,1531,4.9073359073359075
2017755,5,B0001MZ7K0,"Can something be so retarded that it's brilliant? well, Sealab answered that question with a mighty yes.  Every episode has a plot that seems as if they were written by a drugged up social science professor.  The jokes may be repetitive at times, but that's just part of their charm.

I've seen people moaning and whining about the animation, and that to me is just a testament to how people seriously don't get this show.  It's SUPPOSED to look like that, it's a parody of sorts.  Most of the shows look like photoshopped versions of their original, that's part of the show's charm.  There was an episode where they only show a picture of sealab while the characters continue with their dialogue, dialogue that I find charming and quick to the point like Aqua Teen.

For the price tag...it's only 20 something dollars.  C'mon now, I wanted more episodes as well, and I know that you could fit double the amount of episodes on both DVDs, but it's still a great price.

Oh yes, for the person that called Courage The Cowardly dog an ""abomination of American mediocre toonists"", you obviously don't know what you're talking about.  Courage, along with Time Squad and Samurai Jack, are just a few of the shows given on cartoon network that have something other shows don't have, well two actually, and that is ORIGINALITY and most of all, PERSONALITY.  Unfortunately, no one appreciates them, so we're bound to be stuck with cartoons that are going to do nothing but try and be like everything else.

I sure as heck don't want every cartoon to be like Futurama or The Simpsons.  While those are excellent, everything else doesn't need to mimic them. I wouldn't have Aqua Teen or Sealab, or even Courage the Cowardly Dog if we followed that way of thinking.  These shows do in 11 minute episodes what it takes others an entire half an hour to do.

Buy this, it'll be the best twenty dollar purchase you'll make in a while.  That is, until volume 2 appears.",1098921600,8,1952,4.614492753623188
2017756,1,B0001MZ7K0,"Let's stack this lame, formulaic retread against some cartoons that are actually watchable:  The Simpsons was consistently brilliant for 8 years and can still hit some high marks.  Futurama was original, superbly-drawn, and although it was inconsistent its best episodes were as good as anything.  The Family Guy was (and is) sometime hilariously twisted.  Compared to these shows, Sealab 2021 is nearly useless.  It's visually crappy.  Its characters aim for quirky, but come up short and fall squarely on annoying.  The plotlines try to wring some humor out of bizarre situations, but it's a lost cause -- there's just no reason at all to care.  I really don't understand why people like this show.  I know it's on late at night, but I don't think I've ever been stoned and bored enough to get into lame, numbing garbage like this.  Along with the static anime, this is a low point for Adult Swim.",1098921600,4,899,4.816993464052287
2017757,4,B0001MZ7K0,"Sealab 2021 one of the new Adult Swim shows by Cartoon Network is one of the funniest cartoons ever made and one of the better toons on the Network. It's a breath of fresh air considering that Toon's network lineup consist of such awful created like ""Ed Ed and Eddy"" , ""Courage the Cowardly Dog"" and other abominations of American mediocre toonists.

Sealab humor takes place on an underwater sealab. The crew consists of a old idiotic captain, his crew which consists of Marco (the funny voice of chips reject Erik Estrada), a lovely blonde bombshell, and kid with a dolphins voice

to name a few.

The show pokes fun at the characters and at race relations and other cartoons on the air.

In one episode I saw, the episode poke fun of Hollywood using as the basis the crew, and their popularity.

It's just absolute funny.

The dvd features are limited, I did find the deleted scenes and

an alternate ending (I,Robot I believe) to be very funny, however the somewhat hefty price tag might turn viewers away, since there isn't enough bonus stuff to get the viewer to buy the set.",1097712000,4,1081,4.569948186528498
2017758,5,B0001MZ7K0,"Among all the not so great shows today, there arises this masterwork of comic genius.  It exposes cliches of modern culture and cinema with mordant insight and even parts that seem to be completely random are funny.  While characters on other shows are talking non-stop, there is on Sealab the Pregnant Pause.  For example, a few seconds of nothing but background humming while Dr. Quinn is stunned by Captain Murphy's latest idiotic idea.  Supposedly these people are here to do research and monitor the kelp harvest but they do anything but.  The writers pack every manner of improbable scenario into the confines of an underwater station that seems to blow up at the end of half the episodes.  Another element of hilarity is added in the fact that this show is based on a seventies kids cartoon that didn't even last a full season.  The style of the animation makes it look like it should be a 'serious' show, but it spins completely out of control every time.  The animation in some parts is made intentionally so low in quality, that it makes me crack up.  I find it funny even when I see the characters run because you could get almost get a more convincing motion with one of those flipbooks.  The dialog in this show is outstanding and very quotable, the mannerisms of the characters will stick in your head forever, and the satire is irresistable.  It has everything!  It is life incarnate!",1096502400,8,1399,4.66530612244898

Anyone who has a twisted sense of humor and is thirteen or over should watch this. This show also has nothing to do with the old Sealab 2020, so don't expect it to be a sequel.

If you like this show you will enjoy Aqua Teen Hunger Force too.",1096243200,4,374,4.095890410958904
2017760,5,B0001MZ7K0,"Sealab 2021 is [Adult Swim]'s demented, bizarre, and irreverent comedy cartoon about a small group of people living in a laboratory under the sea. In the 70's, Hanna Barbera made a short-lived and terrible educational show called Sealab 2020. Sealab 2021 has taken the animations from 2020, altered them, and added unbelievably bizarre, warped, and hilarious scenarios for the crew.

The thirteen episodes on this DVD are extremely funny. In one episode, Captain Murphy loses his happy cake oven and sends the crew on a suicidal mission to retrieve it. In another, Sparks gets the crew hooked on a home made drug called Stimutacs, which results in unbelievably wacky responses from the crew members. Also included are episodes with a Feng Shui con artist, scorpion venom addictions, vicious alien predators, and pirate radio stations.

Sealab is very funny, but don't expect it to be your cup of tea. It definitely has an acquired taste. Animation is very crude and simplistic, episodes are unbelievably twisted, and random occurences abound. I'd highly recommend you watch an episode or two on TV before buying this DVD. Sometimes the episodes consist of the crew bickering about something for the whole episode, such as the episode in which they discuss what they would do if they implanted their brains in robot bodies.

Also, don't let the complaints about the size of this DVD sway you. Sealab has over 150 minutes of run time, while most comedy movies are only 90 minutes. Sure, it isn't packed with extras, but it shouldn't be enough of a shortcoming to sway a fan.",1094515200,8,1572,4.946969696969697
2017761,5,B0001MZ7K0,"Well, I've watched sealab ever since the first time they showed it on adult swim, and I was immediatly (sp) hooked by the whimsical humor of the show.  Its not a show for everyone.

and for those of you who wonder why they have two dvds instead of one.  Like Cds, there are various types of sizes.  The most popular are dvd9, which are dual layerd and hold 9 gb of data, and dvd4, which are single layered and only contain...guess what..4gb of data.  Guess what kind of dvd the sealab/aqua teen dvds are?  Thats right, dvd4, so its the same price as a single dvd (which would be a dvd9)..if you truly don't belive me, put a 'normal' single dvd movie into your dvd rom (if you have one) and go to my computer then right click the dvd rom and go to properties, and it should say 9.xx gb is used on this dvd.  Then put in a sealab/aqua teen dvd, and do the same thing, it will say 4.xx gb used on this dvd.",1091750400,9,903,4.067796610169491
2017762,5,B0001MZ7K0,"ok I've been watchin peeople whine back and forth about this dvd and as to the ""2 disc"" jack. look do you not realize the reason they try to stretch it is becuase it's only one season. it's not like it had a new episode every night. adult swim when this was out only played good stuff 1 to 2 nights a week. in the end if you like the adult swim cartoons you will love this. if your not much of a fan of this, space ghost, ATHF, or harvey birdman atourney at law.....then you might as well just stay away from this dvd. great buy though for those fans who just can't get enough of those hallarious cartoons",1091491200,9,605,4.05
2017763,5,B0001MZ7K0,"First off, caveat emptor.  If you're buying this series without knowing anything other than what the reviews said, that's your own lookout. You can easily find out what's what with a little research on your part without spending what people apparently think is a lot of money.  It's a very *funny* series based almost entirely on animation cells ripped from a previous series -- SeaLab 2020.  That series was about as funny as sticking wood splinters under your toenails.  This, however, is...well, funny.  Even funnier if you sit through the horrible thing it's pulled from.

Second, on the money thing.  I really don't get that.  I bought this for 19.99 at a local store the day it came out.  I'm used to paying 19.99 or *more* for single DVD movies; getting two DVDs for that price isn't exactly a ripoff.  Right now, I've got literally thousands of examples of DVDs with less content per disc, less DVDs per package, for more money.  Two DVDs just means they had much more room for extras.  They overshot a little, but if they hadn't, then you'd be missing something that you otherwise got.  And just remember, if you think that price is a little high and wish it were lower, think of those poor 'creators' of this show and how they're only seeing a fraction of what you spent.  Even with mass production, the money disappears fast. They deserve their dime.

They deserve more than just a dime.  This is one of those rare, consistently funny cartoons.  They're into, what, season 3 now and they're still funny.  And they're still on the air.  That's more than I can say for some things that I've liked.  I hope season 2 follows 1 out on DVD quickly and that 3 isn't too far off either.

So, anyway, thanks guys [as if they're watching].  Keep up the 'good' work, because starving children in third world countries don't have quality funny-stuff like this.  And that's what makes first world countries so great....",1091404800,13,1917,4.656716417910448

2017765,5,B0001MZ7K0,"Part of the early wave of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim lineup, Sealab 2021 spoofs the campy sci-fi cartoons of the 60's and 70's as we are introduced to Captain Murphy and his crew aboard an underwater research station called Sealab.  Each of the 13 episodes contained here find the crew getting into all sorts of absurdly hilarious shenanigans, many of which end up with Sealab imploding.  Purposely tacky in terms of animation quality and containing some very off the wall humor, Sealab 2021 garnered a loyal cult following, even though it is still to this day overshadowed by other Adult Swim shows like Space Ghost Coast to Coast and Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  The DVD set by Warner Bros. however is supremely disappointing in terms of features and presentation.  Why the 13 episodes (roughly about 11 minutes in length each) are spread out on two discs is absurd to say the least (most likely done to snare more cash), and the features are lacking.  Even though we get a few deleted scenes, a commentary would have been nice, or even a making of.  All in all, this is worth picking up for die hard fans of the show (and you all know who you are), but don't expect anything else to go along with the pricey package.",1091059200,38,1217,4.585253456221198

(they did this with Aqua Teen Hunger Force & Wonder Woman, ie... stretching the disc count to MORE than necessary) anyway, great show, and at least WB gets point for releasing it in the first place.",1090800000,11,576,4.245454545454545
2017767,5,B0001MZ7K0,"Incredibly funny show. Some of us older folks might remeber the origional show, sealab 2020, quite possibly THE worst cartoon ever made. Belive you me, 2021 is nothing like its counterpart.

 2021 starts off by using old animations from the origional, and redubbing it with a VERY talented set of voice actors, including Ellis Henican, writer for New York Newsday, Erik Estrada, and of course the legend himself, Harry Goz(Fiddler on the roof, chess, many other stage productions. R.I.P.

 Abstract humor fueled with social commentary and references to many many classic movies and shows(after watching all that jazz, check out disneys ""Black hole"" and look for the ""toaster looking"" robot who tries to help the trapped captin)

 The dvd itself is good, but perhaps a bit lacking on features, but for purists like me, im buying the disc for the show, not the dvd extras. The pitch pilot is a must see. The show is a 5/5, but the disc i'd say maybe 4/5. The lack of extra's is due to how AdultSwim is marketing the disc. If you remember ATHF vol1 had few extras as they wanted to see how well it sold before going extra crazy, like they did with vol2. I'd expect the same for Sealab vol2.

 Highly recommended to fans of the simpsons, Family Guy and Futurama.

 Oh and for people who write reviews without any knowledge of the show, Yeah, there are 38+ episodes(newest season is still airing),not only about a dozen",1090454400,37,1414,4.6882591093117405

The thing is, the soda machine landed on him. That was the first episode I've ever seen of Sealab 2021, a priceless gem among the line-up of Adult Swim shows.
This show is one of the funniest cartoons out there and I plan to buy this, and the Aqua Teen one, because the thought of owning these episodes is quite a nice feeling. But as some have said, Adult Swim and Cartoon Network are only using the bare minium when it comes to the content, and that sucks they have to do that to the people that tune in weekly to catch these shows.

It's a spoof off the old 1972 cartoon ""Sealab 2020"", except that the original '72 crew has been replaced by a bunch of lunatics who probably shouldn't be allowed out of doors. Perhaps that's why they've been confined to an underwater lab where they can't hurt anybody (well, almost anybody). We loyal fans have long awaited Adult Swim gems to come on DVD, and with ""Sealab 2021"", you get the following eppys:
*I, ROBOT- News of a monkey whose brain has been implanted in a robot prompts the crew to have a long-winded ""discussion"" about the fate of their own brains.
*HAPPYCAKE- Captain Murphy is devestated to find his beloved Happy Cake Oven is missing, and orders the crew, along with a Jacques Cousteau-like narrator, to search the waters for it. Meanwhile, a giant squid endangers the life of the crew; or as the narrator sees it, ""uses it's tentacles to cradle me like a Mother's arms"".
*RADIO FREE SEALAB- Captain Murphy is bored and decides to use the lab's emergency radio beacon for a pirate radio station, starring as ""Howling Mad"" Murphy.
*CHICKMATE- Debbie questions the male crewmembers to see who will make the best Father for the baby she wants immediately, and Stormy almost learns a valuable lesson in race relations.
*LOST IN TIME- Bizarre episode in which Stormy and Dr. Quinn are mysteriously transported 15 minutes back in time to save Sealab from an explosion- even though the same explosion happens again, starting the vicious cycle all over again.
*PREDATOR- There's an invisible yet shimmery ghoul aboard Sealab that has the crew cowering in the corners. It's up to Dr. Quinn (with Dolphin Boy as bait) to capture the fiend.
*LITTLE ORPHAN ANGRY- Griffin, a terminally ill orphan, comes aboard Sealab to live out his dream. But Griffin's heart is not as pure as everyone thinks. Meanwhile, Capt. Murphy morphs into a germ-a-phobe freak as he fears a Bubonic Plague outbreak.
*WAKING QUINN- The eppy is a bit hard to follow- Stormy wants to show Dr. Quinn his new hairdryer while Quinn is in the water- yes, Dr. Quinn is electrocuted and bizarre happenings are afoot.
*ALL THAT JAZZ- In one of the funniest episodes, Capt. Murphy gets trapped underneath the BeBop Cola machine. Unfortunately for him, everyone else is at a concert. A year transpires before he is found, and in that time he loses all his teeth and becomes addicted to scorpion venom.
*MURPHY MURPH AND THE FENG SHUI BUNCH- This is my all-time fave eppy. Capt. Muprhy is dissatisfied with the disharmoy of the Sealab decor. He hires an extortionate Feng Shui ""master"" to redecorate everything- but ""Master Loo"" is a con artist who convinces the crew to buy his crap oragami and persuades Murphy to spend $50,000 on a solid gold toilet. Ofcourse, only Dr. Quinn sees through him.
*IN THE CLOSET- Capt. Murphy gets everyone stlocked in a closet, and tempers begin to flare.
*STIMUTACS- The ver witty Sparks has come up with a new drug that everyone wants,but the side effects are grotesque- and additctive.
*SWIMMING IN OBLIVION- A compliation of past episodes dominates this season finaale, including the informercials for the ""Debbie Gone Wild!"" DVD's.

2017776,5,B0001MZ7K0,"Ok, though details are sketchy, CN has stated that none of their shows will be released on dvd until it has at least 24 episodes (this magic number appearently constitutes a full season in their eyes, even though all sources aside from CN look at SL2021 as having had 3 seasons).  Hopefully this set will include no less than 24 eps and possibly as many as 33.  Even still, who could pass up any paltry amount of SL2021 on dvd, come on.  BTW, King Of (f'n) Queens?!?",1085702400,2,466,4.333333333333333
2017777,5,B0001MZ7K0,"Well if you like athf, or harvey birdman, heck anyone who watchs adult swim needs to own this set.  Along with the other sets like athf.  The more dvd's the public buys, the more shows adult swim will put on dvd.  So support the spread of dirty humor, and buy buy buy.",1085529600,2,268,4.115384615384615

8014958,5,B0001MZ7K0,Season 1 garbage... Like I said about hunger Force first season... 5 stars because I'm a fan but this season bit Sea cucumber,1494547200,,125,4.478260869565218
8014959,5,B0001MZ7K0,"I'd say this is the best season of the show, but I really liked season 2 also. I wonder if they made them back to back or all at once? Absolute classic adult swim style humor and if you're here looking at and considering buying this you probably already know what you're getting into.",1486684800,,284,4.277777777777778

8014962,4,B0001MZ7K0,"I bought this because I found out that the people who made Archer also made this.  I'm a big Archer fan.  This was their first series and it shows.  It doesn't have the level of sophistication of Archer in terms of story-writing and art.  This series is the Archer creators finding their way.  I was mildly amused and then I put it on a shelf for a while, being somewhat disappointed.  After a few weeks I decided to give it another try.  It began to grow on me.  Since then I've watched it a number of times with a fair amount of enjoyment and am glad I bought it.",1461542400,,565,4.1192660550458715
