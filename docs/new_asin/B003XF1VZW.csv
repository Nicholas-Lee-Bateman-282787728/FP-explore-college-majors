8408051,4,B003XF1VZW,"The beautiful Jeanette Moreneau (Susanne Loret) is despondent. She's been dumped by her boyfriend, Pierre (Sergio Fantoni), and subsequently gets in a car accident, becoming hideously disfigured by facial burns. Actually, she looks like a pretty woman w/ lasagna on her face, but I digress. Jeanette soon discovers that the mysterious Dr. Levin (Alberto Lupo) and his assistant, Monique (Franca Parisi) have developed a formula called Derma 28, that will restore her beauty, so she can return to her job as an exotic dancer. The formula is applied, and Jeanette is back to her pre-lasagna self.  Meanwhile, Monique grows increasingly jealous of Levin's over-attentiveness toward Jeanette. But wait, the effects of the Derma 28 begin to fade, causing Jeanette to become slightly less pretty, and Levin to desperately seek a solution. This leads him to mad, homicidal means. ATOM AGE VAMPIRE is a deliriously melodramatic sci-fi opus from Italy. Some of the best laughs come from listening to the various characters yelling each other's names- ""Pierre!"" ""Pierrre!"", ""Monique!"" ""Moniiiique!"", etc. This is dubbing at its most sublime! Ludicrous through and through, AAV registers ultra high on the schlock scale. Those unaccustomed to such fare may want to avoid its brain-smoothing effects...",1426982400,,1290,5.417910447761194
8408052,2,B003XF1VZW,"""Atom Age Vampire""
Italy-1960

Directed by Mario Bava, who also directed my #1 favorite Classic Horror Film, ""Black Sunday/Mask of Satan"".  Unfortunately, Mr. Bava also directed the flick that pissed me off recently because it was a total misnomer and had the incredibly misleading title of ""Planet of the Vampires"".  There wasn't a single vampire in it!  Not a one!

Nor was there in ""Atom Age Vampire""!  grrrrrrrr ...

This was more like a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde rip-off.  The mad doctor falls in love with the beautiful stripper (she was gorgeous ... an Italian beauty named Susanne Loret) whose face was disfigured because she drove over a cliff into the ocean when she found out her lover was leaving her *sigh*.

The mad doctor had some sort of serum he'd developed that took away the scarring (retin-a anyone?) but needed to keep killing young women because he needed some sort of something from them to create it ... the film never told us what it was.  Either that or I'd fallen asleep for a moment.

Anyway ... typical, typical.  He gets into a machine that changes his molecular structure and turns him into a monster, then goes out and kills women and all for what?  The lovely stripper leaves him anyway for the ex-lover that decided to come crawling back and our poor protaganist, the mad doctor, dies near a rosebush in the end.

It would have made a better love story ... and I just don't like that.",1354924800,,1412,4.618473895582329
8408053,3,B003XF1VZW,"Jeanette Moreneau (Susanne Loret) makes her living in the entertainment industry. This makes her boyfriend (Sergio Fantoni) mad; so he leaves for the sea. She ends up in an auto accident that and really burnt over the situation.

Along comes a brilliant doctor (Alberto Lupo) with a secret. He promises to put Jeanette back together again. In the process, the Doc falls in love with his patient. So now, his nurse assistant is only good from spare parts.

If you aree wondering how the doctor dedided to turn into a monster there are two suggested cenarios in the film:
1) He use the previous generation of the serum that is known to create monsters that need to take periodic stem baths.
2) Monsters from Japan, which were created by the atomic bomb, sneak in to the U.S. disguised as normal doctors.

Well it is show time, the police are getting suspicions and the boyfriend is back. Can Jeanette be permanently fixed before the doctor is permanently fixed by a police bullet or worse?
