8628929,2,B00H05SY0G,"This is an interview with Shaka the son of infamous Harlem gang leader called ""Preacher."" The first half of the film is Shaka talking about the organization of the gang and  the crimes with an occasion white interpreter. The last have of the film deals with how he feels about having killed people and him and his dad being a snitch.

Shaka is not overly articulate. Plenty of use of F-bomb. Might be meaningful to those who have their own Preacher story.

About 45 minutes in length.",1427932800,,484,4.540229885057471
