Then i decided to collect them all on dvd, this one however never came out with a us version of its own. Theres only the double feature including the first wishmaster as-well on a double sided disc.  I am not a fan of double side disc's cuz i keep most of my mine in dvd binders cuz of all the different titles i own. I own almost 1000 movies and most of them are horror. I love scary movies and i won't ever stop buying different ones new and old. Wishmaster 2 i found in another region and bought instead if the double feature cuz i have a phillips dvd player and although they're getting to be harder to find they are the ones that'll play every dvd of any region code. I love that about it. I now have all the wishmasters on dvd on their own cd non double sided with anyone, it cost me a lil more but it was worth for my collection. Wishmaster 2 is a fun sequel, much like the first but 3 & 4 are much different still check them out along with the first 2.",1490486400,,1048,3.943396226415094
