This forty-six minute ESPN special ends sadly, with scenes of Ali ravaged by Parkinson's Syndrome, now slowed to a crawl and silenced. But the story the comes before is a glorious one!

Both fights in their entirety. Dr. Ferdie Pacheco provides optional commentary for the Thrilla match.",1300233600,12,636,5.34
