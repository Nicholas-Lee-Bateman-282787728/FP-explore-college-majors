8733574,5,B015GV1JN4,"Love this. Had already bought the Super Relaxation DVD by Scenery Station. I put this, or the original one on TV as a visual background. What is clever is there is no soundtrack just the original sound of nature.  So I can put on music to accompany the visuals as I see fit, or just meditate / relax to the pure sound of nature. Nice approach. Keep up the good work. Will buy more.",1453939200,3,381,4.148648648648648
8733575,5,B015GV1JN4,I bought this because I always relax when I hear the sound of waves at the beach. I was delighted with the stunning scenes! The sunset in Victoria is beautiful and I loved the scenes with rocky outcrops in the water (see picture). I really felt like I was at each location. As an added bonus I found my son relaxed and played quietly in the lead up to his bedtime. I would highly recommend this DVD. With one of my New Year's resolutions being to spend time meditating each day this DVD will be perfect!!,1451692800,3,504,4.260416666666667
