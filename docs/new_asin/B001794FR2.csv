8326159,1,B001794FR2,This isn't a review of the movie as I refused to watch anything that's dubbed. Dubbing is a travesty that is only acceptable for so bad their good martial arts films.,1460764800,,166,4.387096774193548
8326160,3,B001794FR2,"A little too predictable as to characters, but not bad all the same.  The story has an interesting twist, and the quirks of some of the Israeli soldiers are very amusing.",1455580800,,170,4.483870967741935

8326162,1,B001794FR2,"This has got to be the most amateuristic movies I've ever seen. Amateur acting, directing. How in the world can anyone ever rate this movie any higher than one star?????",1421366400,,169,4.666666666666667

8326165,4,B001794FR2,"A very interesting movie.  The IDF is a very unusual.  Although the ending was very predictable, the film stol was a joy to view.",1400371200,,129,4.333333333333333
8326166,5,B001794FR2,"Touching story about a female soldier searching for her father, and a humorous look at army reserve duty in the late 1980's. The film has several comedic moments, including an army commander who doesn't realize that he's being filmed during a ""private"" encounter, and a dog that drinks coffee and can throw a ""10"" in backgammon. The English title of the film does not match the Hebrew which in translation is the assigned name of the military police operation - ""Kiss on the Forehead.""",1361232000,4,485,4.785714285714286
