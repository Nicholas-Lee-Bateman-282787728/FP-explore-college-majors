8361028,5,B000OY8NME,"Nothing will ever compare to actually being in a Redwood forest because the feel of spongy earth beneath one's feet and the aroma of enormous trees filling one's nostrils will never be captured through photography - no matter how magical the lens.  That said, 'California Redwoods' does its best to rekindle those sensations through a poetic unfolding of imagery that I find quite delightful.  Often, in meditative nature videos, there is a lot of 'quick cuts' wherein the images move from one to another very rapidly, and when that happens I find myself unable to relax into the environment.  Happily, most of the imagery in 'California Redwoods' moves quite slowly, like the trees themselves, and that allows for a nice, gentle entry into the forest.  There is music (by Raphael) accompanying the imagery and most of it I find calm and appealing.  However if the music is not to your liking, there is always the volume button (and/or you can substitute your own music).  Lastly, for me, this video serves me best when I use it as ambiance rather than as something to 'sit down and watch.'  Many times I have created artwork and/or read whilst the video played in the background - just spicing my living room with redwoods.

Happy journeys!",1316822400,4,1241,4.820754716981132

I'm a positive, 'glass half full,' nature loving person, and yet, I can't help but write this review. ""Living Landscapes"" dvd on the Redwoods of northern California is a rip-off, in my opinion.  I knew it wasn't an educational video.  I knew it would be only a series of scenic video shots, both distant and close up.  And, I knew the scenes would have gentle music playing.  But the photography is horrible and boring!  Many of the shots were filmed in the middle of the day when light is the worst for photography.  There were repeated shots where the camera panned slowly across a scene, which seems fine.  Except it moved to slowly and lasted so long it was difficult to watch.  I even found several shots that were in the film two or three times!  I kept hoping it would get better so I watched the whole thing.  Then, I took it out of the player, put it back in the case and dropped it in the garbage.",1306454400,2,1040,4.314432989690721
