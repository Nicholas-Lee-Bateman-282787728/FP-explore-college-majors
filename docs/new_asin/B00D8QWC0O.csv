8590673,5,B00D8QWC0O,"The folks at Scorpio Films Releasing are at it again and we should all be thankful for it. The latest is Dr. Frankenstein's Wax Museum of the Hungry Dead. This is the story of Charles Frank(enstein)(portrayed by Michael Thurber), a curator of a wax museum in Salem, MA. Charles is trying to build his perfect Aryan human specimen. He has had many failures which are roaming around the museum. Enter some of the most mean and obnoxious high schoolers you have ever seen. Led by the super-mean Ashley (played by Shannon Hartman) she inadvertently leads her group into extreme danger when she decides to fulfill a fantasy of hers and ""do it"" in a wax museum with her boyfriend Colton (played by Patrick Keefe). The rest of her troupe are Troy and Sam (played by Aaron Peaslee and Johnny Sederquist), 2 gay lovers that also decide to use the wax museum as a kinky place for a tryst, and Zoey (portrayed by Aurora Grabil)who has also brought her latest band crush Vermin (played by Jesse Dufault) with her. Along for the ride is sweet and innocent Katherine (portrayed by Jamie Lyn Bagley) who is trying to find her friend Ryan (portrayed by Christopher Ferreira) who disappeared after meeting with Ashley. The not so good doctor is not going to let this invasion of his privacy go unpunished (plus he could use the spare parts). He unleashes his creations on the students and their teacher Mr. Jefferson (played by Ryan Hanley). The chaos that ensues is such fun to watch that it needs a good comfy couch and popcorn. The creatures (led by Nat Silva who also co-directed) are not zombies but reanimated victims of Frankenstein. The cast was superb with standout performances of Johnny Sederquist as Sam and Sean Carufel as Frtizy (I won't spoil anything about Fritzy).  The film was dubbed (on purpose using the same actors) to give it a Euro Schlock feel and it works. Check it out you won't be disappointed.",1374451200,,1905,4.686567164179104
8590674,5,B00D8QWC0O,"Dr. Frankenstein's Wax Museum of the Hungry Dead is a must-see for any true B Horror movie fans out there.  If you like your horror movies over the top with equal parts laughs and screams then you've come to the right place.  Richard Griffin masterfully takes us on a blood-soaked ride through a wax museum as a group of teens try to survive the night.  Dr. Frankenstein (Michael Thurber) himself is a delight to watch, making the audience cringe and laugh with equal vigor.  Do yourself a favor and get a copy of this movie.",1370563200,,525,4.494736842105263
