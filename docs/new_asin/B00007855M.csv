Elizabeth Perkins delivers an outstanding performance as do several other members of the cast.  When I first saw this, I initially assumed this was about events that occurred in the early 1900's and was shocked to learn that they happened in the 1980's!!!!  Even though this isn't a feel-good, light movie, I think it is important to watch movies such as this to remind us of past injustices so that we don't let them be repeated.  It's the same reason that I watch WWII and holocaust movies.  Not every movie has to be entertaining.",1421625600,,685,4.619834710743802
7974252,4,B00007855M,"Almost unbelieveable, this film is based on a true story about a Texas firm that demanded their female workers undergo sterilization because it dealt with toxic chemicals.  Female workers had to choose between taking a job and a future with no possibility of children.  Great all around cast (Elizabeth Perkins, Laura San Giacomo & Charles Haid) about a riveting story.  Yes, it's another story about a woman facing humilation & scorn in her fight for justice but a very interesting one and one worth watching.",1178236800,5,510,4.976470588235294
