4035083,5,B002ZGW92Y,This was a cute and funny movie that definitely made my husband and I laugh so hard. We kept looking at each other because it tells how DIFFERENT husbands and wives really are. Very cute and definitely entertaining. NOT a kid movie.,1262044800,18,232,4.5476190476190474
4035084,2,B002ZGW92Y,"This was a missed opportunity to make a hilarious movie if ever there was one. The premise is four couples who are friends and each having their own marital problems decide to go on a couples retreat in order to spice up their dull marriages, as suggested by one of the couples who've been experiencing problems conceiving a child for years. They end up at a private, upscale beach resort called ""Eden"". ""Eden West"" specializes in providing counseling for married couples. (The other side of the island is called ""Eden East"" and is for singles.)

The premise has all of the right ingredients for a potentially great, fun and hilarious romantic comedy. But the problem with ""Couples Retreat"" is that the dialogue is boring, the jokes are not funny, and there are no real comedians in the movie. Vince Vaughn is OK, and Faizon Love and his ghetto-fabulous girlfriend have a few funny moments. Of the few scenes that will make you LOL, you've already seen in the previews on TV. You'll get all of your laughs in (if you laugh at all) during the first 20 minutes of the film.

During the rest of the movie the couples enjoy marriage counseling sessions, yoga, massages, snorkeling and other trivial exercises lead by a strict leader/instructor who tends to be overly philosophical. And get this - the husbands spend 2/3 of the movie bitchin' at each other. That's right, the fellas are cat-fighting while their wives enjoy themselves and eventually end up at ""Eden East"" partying with the singles. Totally stupid! Then the movie ends along the lines of ""The Wizard of Oz"" with the instructor giving each couple a philosophical lecture on love & life, and passing out carved wooden  animals??? I was so glad when this movie ended.

Your best bet is to save your money and skip ""Couples Retreat"". You'll be better off digging through your VHS collection at home and watching ""Weekend At Bernie's"" for the 99th time with your spouse. At least that was a funny movie.",1255305600,,1959,4.736070381231672
4035085,4,B002ZGW92Y,This movie is great. Great supporting cast. Each couples think there is nothing wrong with their marriages that is until they go to Eden a paradise resort ran by the very funny Jean Reno. The scenes with the yogi instructor is too good to repeat. See this movie for yourself. You will enjoy it.,1255305600,2,294,4.462962962962963
4035086,4,B002ZGW92Y,"This is a great movie for the winter...funny funny about married couples trying to find a way to continue their journey together.  Yes they find answers but it takes time and a few side trips.  I really thought this was a funny movie...kind of slowed down at the end when the relationships where trying to reconnect, but the journey was great!  Get this movie...and give it as a gift...so you will have a good movie to watch when you visit your friend's house.  Oh yea...this is a keeper. This was filmed at the St. Regis Resort in Bora Bora if you want to take a few days off with that special person....",1255046400,2,605,4.375
4035087,2,B002ZGW92Y,"Who knew relationship therapy and marriage counseling could be so much fun? Sadly, it isn't. While Couples Retreat has its moments of laugh-out-loud silliness, the themes and overall missions of each set of couples in the film are too serious to simply slide in a few one-liners and sight gags and expect it not to feel forced. Many missed opportunities for laughs (intrusive yoga instructors, Guitar Hero standoffs, and shark-infested waters could have been more comical) dull the proceedings and even funnyman Vince Vaughn seems crowded by too many others trying to steal a piece of the spotlight. With its picturesque tropical paradise setting, chances are the cast had more fun making the movie than you'll have watching it.

When seemingly happy couple Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell) announce they've been carefully planning a divorce, their married friends Dave (Vince Vaughn) and Ronnie (Malin Akerman), Joey (Jon Favreau) and Lucy (Kristin Davis), and Shane (Faizon Love) and his new girlfriend Trudy (Kali Hawk) are guilted into joining them on a tropical paradise vacation at the prestigious Eden Resort. Initial reluctance gives way to awe and excitement at the bevy of exotic sights and activities available at the retreat, until the couples realize that the relationship therapy portion is not only mandatory but strictly executed by a host of oddball ""experts"", including the esteemed counselor Monsieur Marcel (Jean Reno). Forced into compromising positions and pressured into reflecting upon the imperfections of their own unions, each set of couples must now struggle to maintain their marriages while complying with the island's rigorous regimen.

Every marriage has problems, but not all are meant to be solved. At least that's what Dave believes in this mess of generic marital issues, commonplace romance and predictable solutions. The location is certainly a paradise, but serves only to momentarily divert the eyes from the boring characters hashing out their unconvincing disagreements. Traveling to this ""Disneyland for adults,"" (or as Favreau exclaims, ""this looks like a screensaver!"") provides an opportunity for four distressed lovers to reignite the dying flames of love. What it doesn't afford is a single new idea or fresh joke.

Bateman plays his usual character, as does Favreau and Vaughn, further amplifying the familiarity of the roles and situations. Jean Reno doesn't stray far from his turn in The Pink Panther films, and the alarmingly suggestive, inappropriate yoga and uncomfortable nudity exercises strive for easy yet repetitive gags. The few scenes of therapy show the natural humor stemming from watching others discuss their relationship quandaries, the beach bodies are pleasantly frequent, and a few sequences absolutely don't belong in Couples Retreat - almost as if they were brainstormed ideas that writers Vaughn and Favreau just couldn't live without. As the four couples' love lives are dissected, demolished and then repaired, the only retreat moviegoers will find will be the back of their eyelids.

Couples Retreat is a lighthearted, sarcastic film about a group of friends who find themselves on a couples therapy vacation. Although this isn't the best movie to get psyched for a wedding, this was a movie my husband and I saw while we were dating and is fun and light hearted. This was a great film to put on in the background while working on our own wedding planning. It is laugh out loud funny, thanks to Vince Vaughn and Jason Bateman. Only in Hollywood does a group of friends attend couples therapy together! Sense of Humor Required to enjoy this too outlandish to be true film!

I believe it appeals to anyone in a relationship, not just married people. It is so beautiful where they shoot in Bora Bora, I believe, that you will want to go there, as I do! I can't wait and it has been my dream to go to a couples retreat like it, although the one in the movie is fictional. See this movie for good, clean, but not boring fun. I applaud Vaughn for his producing/acting done here and can't understand the haters. It was so difficult to film in this location because of how far off it is, just for that the movie deserves attention. Hardly any movies are made there because of how expensive it is. Totally worth the money you will spend to see it.",1438819200,,776,4.139072847682119

4036436,3,B002ZGW92Y,"I was debating whether to give this movie a 3 star or a 4 star. Too bad Amazon doesn't let you rate in 0.5 stars.
I liked the movie overall, though I admit the main reason I rented it was because Jean Reno was playing the couples therapy guru (loved his role & performance).
Vince Vaughn's character would probably be considered stuffy and uptight for a comedy, but unfortunately he just happens to be my type and I'm biased towards him.
I found Jon Favreau's character hilarious and fun for the most part; he would've been my favorite character, had he not thrown some very personally off-putting offhand remarks.
I feel the movie didn't do Faizon Love's character justice; least development opportunities IMHO due to his physical condition and the fact that his ""spouse"" is a party-girlish young woman who's way too young for him; it's as if the film put Shane there, just so there'd be a token minority. And the backstory with his ex-wife lacked the most substance - can't feel for their successfully newfound love (except the fact that it's simply stated so).
Jason Bateman's character all but ruined the entire film for me (would've considered purchasing it if I didn't had him so much). I just downright loathed his utterly self-centered and self-absorbed personality all throughout the movie. He was probably (intentionally) helpful ONCE in the entire film for something that he didn't have any personal stake, and a real jerk the rest of the time. I would've much better preferred it if Jason got things a lot tougher than everyone else in the end (and actually had to work much harder to earn his happy ending).
Also, I wish the wives had a bit more of their own personalities, too  (with the exception of Trudy). I didn't find Malin Ackerman, Kristin Davis, and Kristen Bell's characters really standing out as unique individuals, like their husbands (contrast how the wives interact with each other or when everyone else is around, as opposed with the husbands).

Then again, in the end, this is just a light romantic comedy, and a pretty short one at that. Maybe I'm setting standards too high.",1432425600,3,2106,4.782967032967033

Although the movie is funny all the way through, there are serious marriage issues and something to be learned from each of them in this movie. There is a little nudity (not in a sexual way) and some sexual innuendos. I do think this movie is not only suitable for watching at home, but also for a marriage retreat to lighten the mood and teach at the same time. It is not suitable for children in my opinion.

4037675,1,B002ZGW92Y,"This movie is hard to screen for because it has a group of actors I consider to be as funny as anyone else in the industry. And I was watching it with a date, which was my fault. I was looking for something funny but not over-the-top. I think this just ended up being one of those movies that gets neutered by the studio. It's one of the least funny films I've ever seen. Don't waste your time on this.

This is a funny movie about several different couples each having their own relationship issues and how they deal with them and each other at a, you guessed it, couples retreat.

Well these couples do have issues but the world that they enter to work these troubles out turns this from a boring chick flick into a raucous comedy. Not only does this movie poke fun at aging married couple who are still looking back to their youth, but it pokes fun at the whole ""meditation/spa retreat"" thing. There are moments in this movie when I was literally in tears (e.g. the ""Fabio"" yoga class).

4038064,1,B002ZGW92Y,"So three couples who have known each other for years and a friend of their's whose divorced and with a young girl go to a beautiful tropical island paradise for a couple's retreat (hence the title), mainly the others go at the bidding of one couple Jason (Jason Bateman, ""Horrible Bosses"") and Cynthia (Kristen Bell, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") who want to save their marriage. Everyone else goes as they figure they can have a vacation while Jason and Cynthia work their issues out, but sadly the cheap travel rate they all get comes with the clause that all couples involved must participate.

What follows is every couple finding out that not all is well with their current relationships, Jean Reno (""The Professional"") is the head of this therapy session and its quite sad to see him reduced to this type of role. The movie was written by two of the stars Jon Favreau (director of ""Iron Man"") and Vince Vaughn (""Wedding Crashers"") also another writer Dana Fox, but the jokes are very tired, stale and honestly just not funny at all.

I do remember that the tropical setting provided some great visuals for the viewer, unfortunately that's all the movie has going for it, well outside of actresses like Kristen Bell and Malin Akerman (""Watchmen"") that can easily keep the attention of most male viewers.

That in itself is reason enough to watch it, in this day of selfishness and disrespect for marriage.  It was a fun ride.  Some near nudity, a man's butt was exposed for a moment but that's all.  Nudity is implied at that point but it's for a funny reason and shows nothing else.  No sexual implications at that time either.

Four couples take a trip to help one of the couples get some help for what they believe is their failing marriage.  The other couples are just along for the ride but the tables are turned on them when they are told there is no free ride at this retreat.  You either work on your relationship or you go home.  Thinking they can just skate into and out of each ""session"" and then get back to the fun because their relationships don't need any work, the other three couples say surprising things to ""fill in the time"" and make it appear that they're living up to their end of the bargain.  Their thoughtless comments lead to some pretty funny counseling sessions and, as expected, they learn a thing or two, not only about their spouses but about themselves.

This overcooked hodge podge of irritating and annoying characters playing dysfunctional couples on a tropical retreat augmented by New Age counseling created temptation beyond physical human endurance to press the OFF button.

Yeah.  Guitar Hero that!

Nothing in this clunker works, from the starchy and contrived counseling sessions and ""exercises"", to the nonsensical shark sequence, to the goofy and trite yoga scene, to the endless quest to get to the other side of the island, the Shangri-La known as Eden East--where the singles are (wink, wink, nudge, nudge).  Through it all Vince Vaughn tries much too hard to be funny, as if he knew he had to do something to save a script and story and plot in banal freefall.  Vaughn's a talented comedic actor, but here his performance is Mission Impossible; and the rest of the cast delivers a stodgy shipment of fail as well.  At least there is plenty of eye candy in COUPLES RETREAT, and I've now become a big fan of Tasha Smith.  But not Guitar Hero.

4038152,4,B002ZGW92Y,"Okay, so a while back (a long while back) I was lambasted for scrutinizing `Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married'.  I'm about to get some more heat for this one, but in my opinion, `Couples Retreat' does a far better job handling the same scenario.  Before you start getting all antsy and inching your mouse towards the `unhelpful' button, hear me out.  Tyler Perry's successful film was decent.  It had some good acting and a great message, but Perry doesn't know how to edit himself and thus his film became unapologetically preachy and unbelievably forthright.  It just didn't carry any sense of realism.  The characters wound up feeling more like caricatures than anything else.  Now, I'm not saying that the characters in `Couples Retreat' are more realistic (I mean, come on) but I will say this; the splashes of humor (at times bucketfuls) really help create a more fluid, enjoyable and meaningful film.  Sure, the end results for most of the couples doesn't make a lot of sense (the ending did seem almost thrown together) but the process of getting there seemed to really elaborate on something real.  The film is, without hesitation, a slapstick comedy, but it has a layer of maturity within context that makes it forgivable.  Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau are hilarious here, and they deliver their lines with earnest intensity, which also helps elevate the films obvious direction.  It's a lighthearted comedy, yet it maintains a level of genuine concern that I think sets it apart a bit.  Believe me, this is a surprise to me.  I kind of expected to hate this, or at best consider it serviceable (albeit lazy) entertainment.  In the end, I was actually moved by it.  Like I said, the ending is not very believable, but getting there sheds light on some realistic scenarios and the truth that no relationship is perfect.

We already know the formula. Today it is usually just a couple where one partner is either a rat or just out to prove something at the other partner's expense. There have also been couples interactions as in ""The Four Seasons"" (1981) with Alan Alda.  However it is not the formula as much as how the story flows and the actors pull it off.  There may be a few twists and turns that add to the fun.

4038208,3,B002ZGW92Y,"Directed by Peter Billingsley (Ralphie, Christmas Story), Couples Retreat is essentially a reason for Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau to take a vacation to a tropical paradise.  Along the way they decided to make a movie.  Conveniently enough, the movie is about friends and their spouses taking a vacation.

When PowerPoint Ranger Jason (Jason Bateman) and his wife Ronnie (Malin Akerman) start to have problems in their relationship - most likely brought on by their OCD and obsession with slideshows - they drag fellow couples Dave (Vince Vaughn) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell), Joey (Jon Favreau) and Lucy (Kristin Davis), & Shane (Faizon Love) and his new fling to Eden, a vacation hot-spot for couples-building that looks like a screen saver, with promises of jet-skiing and beachside alcoholic drinks.  Unfortunately for them, they are going to Eden West, a place for married couples to get new-age counseling with team-building, psychiatry, trust exercises and oddball philosophy involving early awakenings and shark adventures.  What it's lacking, however, is fun; it's lacking Eden East, the singles side of the island.  As contrived and predictable as this is, you already know where this is going.

Despite the cast's obvious chemistry and solid acting, there was just too much kvetching about relationship quandaries to hold throughout the movie, and very little comedy for the mortar.  As I've commented on another's review, the reason the rom-coms lose steam in the last act is the requirement to learn heart warming lessons.  Made all the more unbelievable because the lessons are learned at a party on Eden East, a place and event just as vacuous as the movie itself.  I guess my appreciation for the cast set me up for failure, and potential was not met.

They believe that the only way to save their sinking ship of a relationship is to travel to some exoctic island to do couple therapy because apparently thats not available here in the states. They convinve their friends to join in on the Pelican Package which is a group discount package.

IMO, the negative sentiments about it are a result of wrong expectations.

Couples Retreat is really a romantic utopia about reviving the passion in long term partnerships.

4038242,3,B002ZGW92Y,"Vince Vaughn shares the writing credit for this mediocre-to-bad movie. The good news is the script is very good. The bad new is it's a tepid movie that sometimes sinks to the level of a bad movie. It's dull, seems really long, and it breaks the first commandment of comedies, ""Thou shalt be funny."" It's not funny, people.

Here's what I think. This should have been directed by somebody else as a drama with flashes of (very) mild humor. This should NEVER have been marketed as a comedy, it just isn't funny enough. Was ""Thirty-Something"" a comedy? Because that's what this is like: couples struggling through mid-life with their spouses, questioning their lives, searching, seeking, experimenting, kvetching. The script is good! I swear! It's interesting dialogue and very relatable. It's just not funny.

Everything doesn't have to be funny. But ""comedies"" do have to be funny. And this isn't.

I would have liked to see it as a stage play just letting the good script be its strength. No stupid computer-enhanced tropical retreat, and ESPECIALLY no stupid and unnecessary sex scenes. The protracted ""yoga instructor simulates sex during yoga class"" scene...um...""uncomfortable"" is not the same thing as ""funny.""

Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell shine as actors but are annoying as a couple who I would dread if I was friends with them in real life.

STARRING: Vince Vaughn, Jon Favreau, Jason Bateman, Kristen Bell, Faizon Love, Malin Akerman, Kristin Davis, Jean Reno, Kali Hawk, Peter Serafinowicz, Carlos Ponce and Tasha Smith

WRITTEN BY: Jon Favreau, Vince Vaughn and Dana Fox

DIRECTED BY: Peter Billingsley

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Comedy
Release Date: 09 October 2009

I don't think Vince Vaughn can help but steal any scene he's in. Couples Retreat was lucky to have him; without him the film would have been a mediocre, predictable comedy.

It's not a bad movie, but this was not what I was expecting. For a movie starring legends Vince Vaughn, Jon Favreau and Jason Bateman, and co-written by Vaughn and Favreau, it was on the verge of being disappointing. I'm a huge fan of all three, along with the rest of the cast, and have high expectations of them.

The film is still entertaining and visually nice to look at. First time director, Peter Billingsley (the little kid from A Christmas Story) captures some amazing, tropical scenery.  It makes the film more likable. It's so perfect that Favreau's character Joey has a great line describing the island looking like a screen saver.

Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell play Cynthia and Jason: a couple going through a rough patch. They schedule a meeting with their close friends, who make up three other couples, to shoot them a proposal; a romantic get-away to an island paradise. But ALL must commit in order to get a reduced rate. Cynthia and Jason decide to neglect to mention that they will all have to partake in couple's therapy.

Some of the funniest moments in the film were the montages of the couple's therapy sessions. They were well acted and cleverly spliced together, making them even more entertaining. The cast had great chemistry. They were all convincing and led me to believe they would be friends outside of the film. You can catch some hilarious extended versions of these scenes on the DVD.

Although Cynthia and Jason's relationship appears to need the most help, the film focuses primarily on couple, Dave (Vaughn) and Ronnie (Malin Akerman).

This was no surprise, as Vaughn is hands down one of the best in the biz when it comes to delivering laughs.  Unfortunately, I felt like he was unintentionally carrying the movie. And because he had to focus on bringing everyone else's share of comedy to the table, we weren't really able to indulge in his performance. Yet still, he gives us several humorous moments with well-timed dialogue that is more than satisfactory.

Vaughn and Favreau are masters of improvisation but it seemed that they didn't get to dabble in this art as they have so religiously in past films such as the flawless, The Break-Up.  Also, Jason Bateman was good for a few laughs but he too seemed to be constricted from his usual long tangents of dry, sarcastic bliss.

About 60 percent of the jokes fall short before the punch-line. There is opportunity after opportunity that could have had us rolling in stitches and instead leave us with only a soft chuckle.

Take the scene where Vaughn's character Dave is left to fend for himself in a swarm of vicious sharks. None of the other characters offer any additional comedy whatsoever. This was an unsettling occurrence repeated throughout the entire course of the film.

In another scene Favreau attempts to have an `alone time' session, if you will, and it is spoiled by an intruder. This scene had great potential but fell short. I feel he may not have been granted the freedom to take it to the next level.

Because of the highly respected, enjoyable talents involved in Couples Retreat, my expectations were set too high and thus were not fulfilled. The film was not a downer and I'm sure a lot of folks will enjoy it immensely. I look forward to all of their future projects and hope they do not again retreat from delivering their full potential of comedy.",1268265600,,3883,4.7946026986506745
4038262,2,B002ZGW92Y,"I expected to like this despite the bad critics reviews.  I liked ""The Break Up"" even though a lot of people didn't because they found it uncomfortable to watch Aniston and Vaughn fight, this was like that only not as funny (IMO of course).  It started off ok but went nowhere.  I guess this is what they mean by forgettable because I watched it a week ago and I can't remember what I disliked so much about it, just a waste of time I guess.  If there was half stars I'd give it 2.5 because there were some funny parts... I'm rambling again.",1268006400,5,541,4.223300970873787
4038302,3,B002ZGW92Y,"This was a fairly amusing film about several dysfunctional couples who decide to going on vacation together, unaware their pal has hooked them up at a `couples' retreat where mandatory counseling and `team building exercises' are involved. Most of the couples go into denial they have problems, although it becomes abundantly clear to everyone that they do.  There are several relatively amusing bits...But most of the jokes involve double entendre and innuendo and sometimes it just isn't that amnusing, just vaguely embarrasing.

I liked it... Somewhat. I wanted to see what happened to the characters and their relationships.  Minor complaint:  do think they could've put at least one male hottie in this this one. If I'm going to have to watch a film with people frolicking in their shorts making crude jokes  I at least one or two of the main characters to be hot! Instead all the male leads are out of shape and middle-aged. Yikes.  Ah well, the same old Hollywood double-standard.  *Sigh.*

This was an okay film. I'd watch it on a rainy day if nothing else was on.",1267920000,,1072,4.851648351648351
4038303,5,B002ZGW92Y,"I gave this movie 5 stars because it is a great romantic comedy, perfect if you want to escape reality for a few hours and just laugh.

4038304,2,B002ZGW92Y,"Very predictable plot. Rented the DVD and spent most of my time fast forwarding through out the whole movie. A major waste of time, talent and money.

4038305,1,B002ZGW92Y,"Having read a handful of reviews prior to watching this, my bar was set pretty low but this failed to elicit even a chuckle.  The movie rapidly sways between American Pie caliber phallic jokes (which fall flat) and painfully dry Lifetime-level relationship drama; I have no idea what kind of viewer they had in mind when they made this thing.  Save your time and money, and watch any prime-time half hour comedy at random, which is sure to provide the same level of entertainment.  The scenery was the single redeeming item here.  Watching this during a sub-zero Northeast winter provided a bit of vicarious warmth.",1267920000,9,615,4.828571428571428
4038306,4,B002ZGW92Y,"After hearing the bad reviews we were skeptical to watch it, but we wound up loving it. It's a funny movie. I think couples would especially get a kick out of watching this movie. Wouldn't let kids watch it since there are some hysterical scenes with sexual innuendos. Overall, it's a light hearted funny movie without all the nudity or cursing we're used to in comedies these days.",1267920000,,382,4.632352941176471
4038307,2,B002ZGW92Y,"Couples Retreat could have been much funnier, but turns out to be a wannabe of the old Fantasy Island TV Series.  One of the lines the welcomes spouts when the couples arrive at ""Eden West"" -was we need no money here - only smiles (gag).  There were no smiles nor laughs during the movie, just a wild hope throughout that something crazy, zany would happen - It didn't.  The humor was lost.

Vince Vaughn was the strongest character, and yet he could not pull humor out of this bland comedy.  The cast was topnotch - Malin Akerman, Kristin Davis, Jason Bateman, Jon Favreau, Kristen Bell and Faizon Love but the script did no one justice.  Eden is the tropical island resort that helps couples work out problems in the marriage.  One couple had decided to divorce due to problems conceiving, but this trip was a last chance to make their marriage work.  The other three couples enabled all to go half price, but they did not want counseling - they were there to play, to enjoy the sun and jet ski.

Counseling  is mandatory at 6 a.m as a group and then individual couples counseling sessions as well.  A satire of psycho-therapists that cause problems or complicate the couples lives ensues - whether steam baths with snow, snorkeling, yoga, New Age philosophy, or Asian teachings.  It becomes too much for all of them, and nothing is helping.  Soon they all end up on ""Eden East"" - the singles side of the island.  For some odd reason they all realize what marriage means from that vacuous adventure.

If Lucy and Desi Arnez were alive today, they could have made Couples Retreat a hilarious laugh riot.  Instead we get very rare funny moments and a bland moral lesson.",1267833600,5,1670,4.591216216216216

I am seriously contemplating a class action lawsuit against Vince Vaughn's Wild West Production Company.  I wish there was a way I could go back in time and get my 2 hours back.  I will be cursing Vince Vaughn on my deathbed for robbing me of that time.  Jason Bateman should also be ashamed.  What the heck was he thinking?  F this movie.",1267660800,6,682,4.2578125

Since my husband-to-be detests romantic comedies, I had high hopes that this would be the perfect blend of romantic comedy for me and classic, funny Vince Vaughn for him.

It did not disappoint.  It is a hilarious movie, and I think everyone can relate to at least one of the couples' situations.  It is Vince Vaughn at his best.  Yes, it is predictable in some ways and cheeky in others.  But, it is light-hearted, funny, and can appeal to a wide audience, though I would not recommend it for children.

It is not a frat boy movie or cult classic, like Wedding Crashers, but it is a great date movie, from the funny lines to the physical comedy.  I think the cast was perfect for it, and you'll find yourself quoting some of the great lines from the movie.

I had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time and I guess that lifted my expectations. The cast and previews also had me thinking I was in for a great ride.

4038400,3,B002ZGW92Y,"Couples Retreat tells the tale of the zany adventures of four couples (or maybe 3 ) who go to a retreat together.  Shenanigans ensure.  We meet the other couples through Vince Vaughn's character who along with Kristin Bell comprise the stable couple (oddly enough).  Jason Bateman is an OCD husband with his and his wife's marital issues as the impetus for the trip, John Favreau can't stand his wife, or her him and Faizon Love's character is separated and just started dating a 20 year old.

There are some light comedic moments leading up to the retreat (That's not a real toilet son!) but it seems to take too long to get there.  Once there we know what's going to happen (the ""couples therapy"" will turn out to be mandatory, check, the director makes them do crazy things, check, the yoga instructor will take overly sexualized positions with the class, check) we have but to wait and see if they are funny or not.

I'll say that overall I got a few laughs.  Mostly these came along with the dialog of Vince, John and Jason as these three are good at quick witty dialog.  For instance Vince's overreaction to a ""shark attack"" is quite funny, as is John's dialog after getting... over excited... during a massage.  Jason's whole demeanor as a super OCD guy was humorous to me as he seems so laid back in other roles.  Even Faizon's interaction with his 20 year old amused me.  No offense but the ladies were markedly less funny in my opinion in this film.  But with every joke that flew an equal amount fell (as in flat).  John's attempt to... relax himself... which could have been a very funny outrageous moment turned into a lame ""I see nothing"" sort of joke.  Vince's whole job was only there so an extended video game joke could happen later on.

On the flip side the movie also tries to take relationships seriously making for an uneven experience.  Am I supposed to laugh then immediately turn pensive to contemplate the seriousness of relationships and therapy?  Some of the therapy sessions were downright serious then at the end we're supposed to laugh at a silly joke.  I could dig the seriousness; in particular I could sympathize with Vince and Kristin's therapist trying to create a problem where there was none, but not in this movie where the next scene is a silly massage or Guitar Hero scene.

And the end was not only silly but predictable (more in SPOILER section in Comments).  So it was an uneven experience with a 50% laugh to joke ratio.  That's an average movie not horrible, not great.

Well at least they thought that's what they were doing. The resort they're staying at is a couple therapy resort. They can either get the therapy or leave and lose their money.

  I don't think Couples Retreat is the total bomb that some critics acted like it was. Vince Vaughn plays the same fast talking guy he has for an entire decade and look his buddies Jason Bateman and Jon Favreau are in the movie too. Vaughn seems to only make a movie if at least one of them is in it these days lol. I liked Couples Retreat a lot more than I did Four Christmases though.

  The film is often fun due to the cast. Vaughn playing the same guy has gotten old but he has his moments. I think the supporting cast is better though and I don't mean Bateman and Favreau either because they have played similar characters a few times already. Bateman has played a stuffy guy in the past, while Favreau has been a jerky husband in a few films. They do it well but the funniest moments are due to Jean Reno as the man in charge of the resort, Faizon Love as a middle aged man trying to keep up with his 20 yr old girlfriend and Carlos Ponce as the Yoga instructor.",1266278400,,1289,4.198380566801619

As other reviewers have mentioned, it was extremely predictable.  Despite my past support of Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn, this movie has me thinking twice about bothering to watch any of Vaughn's future films, similar to the effect that Funny People had on me regarding Adam Sandler's work.",1266192000,,640,4.97196261682243
4038426,5,B002ZGW92Y,"Well, what can be said? Vince Vaughn, the comic genius of our time, swings for the fences in this uproarious couples comedy that should not be missed. The Academy has always been biased against comedies, but they are to be ashamed if they slight Mr. Vaughn this time around. Just from the constant stream of trailers-for both the theatrical experience and the dvd/Blu treatment-one can see that this film deserves high praise. Humor of this magnitude is a rare treat to be savored, and this film, along with Vince Vaughn, will always have a special place in American Cinema. Now if only Teen Comedies were given this type of treatment....

That said, I liked it.  While most reviews here will give you the synopsis or the opinion, let me mention some of the features of the blu-ray disc.  They, of course, have outtakes and how to make a movie in Bora Bora, but one of the features that is totally worth the purchase of the Blu-ray is the couples counseling outtakes.  The director literally didn't yell ""Cut"" for some of the comedians/actors that came in for the counseling scenes.  It is hysterical.  Most of the main cast couldn't keep straight faces.  I wish they kept these scenes in the movie.  The counselors are great.

4038430,2,B002ZGW92Y,"Vince Vaughn, Kristen Bell, Jason Bateman, Jon Favreau & Faizon Love are in this movie about couples going to a retreat resort to patch up their relationships. One couple is going because they need to, the others are going cause they want to party and they want to support their marriage-in-trouble friends. Hilarious right? You'd think. I mean, we've seen Vince Vaughn in ""4 Christmas'"", ""Fred Claus"", ""Wedding Crashers"", ""Anchorman"", ""Dodgeball"", and Kristen Bell in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", or Jason Bateman who typically is known for T.V. roles is funny in ""Arrested Development"". Yet, I'm not sure if this was supposed to be funny, or the trailer just made it look like it was supposed to be funny, but ultimately, the jokes come running at you left and right, but time after time, fail miserably.

If you approach this movie in the proper manner, you might enjoy it. The movie is about love and relationships and stress surrounding relationships and and how our quirks can polorize our partner or how we get lost in our lives and forget to tell and show each other how much we care for them. Nothing funny about that. In fact, it's very truthful. That's how COUPLES RETREAT is. It is very truthful about relationships, yet, based on the trailer and its stars, you're looking for FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL, or WEDDING CRASHERS and... it isn't.

Yet, I'm confused because my intuition tells me that the creators were TRYING for the humor we got in the previous mentioned movies, but their jokes just didn't pan out. It just plain, isn't all that funny.

I mean, there's a whole scene of Vince Vaughn stumbling upon a previously stiff employee of the resort playing Guitar hero and they have a Guitar hero competition. The scene, meant to be funny, is about as exciting as it REALLY IS to watch somebody else play Guitar Hero... and that's a metaphor for the entire movie.",1266192000,3,1879,4.79320987654321

It's a story about one couple wanting a marriage counseling/vacation and needing their friends to join in to afford the retreat.  There were 4 couples that ran the gauntlet of stereotypical relationships.  The funniest part for me were the counseling sessions with the 4 couples and 4 different therapists.

Great comedies like Blazzing Saddles and Something About Mary are awesome because they have so much going on. You always seem to find something new and funny with each viewing. Couples Retreat is very funny. It is even funnier if you can relate to 1 of the 4 couples (A divorced couple, A young couple struggling with their marriage, a normal couple with kids and a couple who got married in high school because they got pregnant and feel they missed out on being single). The yoga scene and ""couples building"" scenes really are the best parts of the flick. In the end you walk away from this movie happy and with hope, which is nice in this day and age. Oh! Vince Vaughn is awesome...stop it haters!

BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Universal puts out the best discs by far. Everyone I own is gorgeous. My wife and I want to go to Bora Bora after seeing this! Great picture and sound!

It is possible!  Sure, there were crude jokes, but they didn't show any extra body parts that really didn't need to be seen.  They went as far as ""I hold some tension in my upper thighs"" and then stopped.  It still made you laugh, but it didn't make you cover your eyes.

So while this isn't all that great, by today's standards it is actually a tad above average. The plot is simple. A married couple with relationship problems gets a group rate for both them and three of their couple friends to go along with them (which makes no sense internally, because it is repeated several times that the resort has a long waiting list -- who the heck would have a group discount when you have a long waiting list?). The cast has some people I like, in particular Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell) as well as some people that I don't mind, though it also features Vince Vaughan, who I never like, and Jon Favreau, who I sometimes like and sometimes don't.

So current film comedy is suffering by an endless string of weak imitations of the Apatow Combine. But I think there is also a staggering lack of creativity at the moment. There are no great comedy directors, no great comedy writers, and no great comedy actors. Not too long ago we had people like Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks (before he shifted to dramatic roles) making lots of good comedies. But there are also some inexplicable group lapses in taste.
