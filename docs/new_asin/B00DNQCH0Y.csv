5837812,5,B00DNQCH0Y,"This is by-far the funniest show next to Family Guy!!! This also completed my collection!!!! I love everything about it from the show to the special features, deleted scenes, and more!!!! Seth Green is a freakin genius!!!",1389052800,,221,5.0
5837813,5,B00DNQCH0Y,"Still hilarious and extremely well-animated. The writing isn't flawless and some jokes fall flat, but a new one is right around the corner to sucker punch you in the mouth and take all your loose change to use in a coin-operated ride for a thorough humping. The Cabin in the Woods parody was a standout laugh riot. And yes, I listen to the commentaries, Seth! Don't stop doing them! I actually enjoy your meaningless blathering. And the Chicken Nuggets? Delicious.
More of the same great entertainment done right on Robot Chicken. What's not to love?",1388188800,2,550,4.8
5837814,5,B00DNQCH0Y,Excellent show!! I am addicted and have watched all episodes over and over. Very Addictive and hard to shut off. lol,1387324800,,116,4.571428571428571
5837815,5,B00DNQCH0Y,Robot Chicken and Seth Green are becoming my favorite pop culture things to watch.  I love to see which REAL celebreties have lent their voices to the newest skits.,1384819200,,164,4.655172413793103
5837816,5,B00DNQCH0Y,An excellent and hilarious season of Robot Chicken! A lot of memorable channel flips that had me laughing the entire season. Easily one of their best.,1383696000,,150,4.8076923076923075
5837817,3,B00DNQCH0Y,"Okay here we go...

I have watched every season of this show and yeah, it's pretty funny. I was watching it and then it suddenly hit me...

what about breaking Bad? Only instead of breaking bad it would be (switch the elemental letters) BAKING BREAD. yeah, baking bread and someone would be baking muffins. Yeah, muffins instead of a meth lab it would be a muff lab and  hey, they would be blue. Yeah BLUE muffins and violence and gore would ensue. What a great pitch. And then a further thought hit me. This is exactly what robot chicken does. And it's funny but silly and... well. Really silly.

Why do I pay money for this? It's so easy to think this s*** up yourself.
This has become too easy. I have not been really impressed by robot chicken since season two. It's kind of cool that there are guys out there making money off of people by spending oodles of time and time stop-motion-animating nerds wet dreams but come on! Is it really THAT easy? Yeah it is.
Sorry, but I think it's time to grow up and expect a little more.

I just can't get behind this anymore. It's too stupid. Good for you if you can still find something to laugh about but I think I'm out for now. When MY ideas are better than the show I'm watching, then it's time to head on to better stuff. Good luck with this fun franchise, I'm just gonna sit tight for the next thing (like maybe next season of metalocalypse unless I think up something better than that on my own!) - people, aim higher!

I'm not saying there is a better obvious alternative, but I AM saying; This is just not good enough.
I give it three out of five (and that is as a fan).
Anyone else would probably give two.",1383004800,,1661,4.257142857142857
5837818,3,B00DNQCH0Y,"I have received two different copies of this Blu Ray, and both came with a Ultraviolet code that can only be used in Canada.  Amazon needs to take this item down until the situation can be resolved.

UPDATE - After contacting Flixster, they added the ultraviolet copy to my account.  It should not be this difficult.  WB should correct this issue.",1382486400,4,347,4.639344262295082
5837819,5,B00DNQCH0Y,"I must begin by stating that I am quite the Robot Chicken fanboy and this season is my favorite yet.

There is not a single bad episode, but of course some are better than others.

The extras are terrific and I enjoyed them all.  It was interesting to go behind the scenes and get some familiarity with the people making this show.",1382054400,2,331,4.306451612903226
5837820,3,B00DNQCH0Y,Robbot Chicken season six is funny but the last five have been a lot better. I was  a littledisapointed with season six. The price could have been a little cheaper too.,1381708800,,168,4.419354838709677

5837832,5,B00DNQCH0Y,"OMG!
I hope this show never dies!
I can never get enough of Robot Chicken.
It's like one of the comfort foods of my massive media consumption.

If you're buying season 6 for starters, or because you're finding it at a great bargain, I will recommend heading back to season 1 and picking them all up in between.

This show is made to keep your attention span by changing skits constantly, and it's just brilliant. JUST BRILLIANT!
Great for the modern day adult kids who can't focus on anything for more than 5 minutes.
Each episode is usually around 11 minutes, which was made to fit in most Adult Swim (Cartoon Network) Slots.

I wouldn't recommend this for kids.

This show gives alternative views on 80s-90s-early00s-present day items like transformers to American Idol, to gummy bears.
It takes this and spins it into a tornado of awesomeness, and you're just left with this.... Man... that's a legit concept, and questions everything I ever thought while I was growing up, and/or yea... I've thought about that, but it's nice to see someone out those thoughts into a creative television show.

Thanks,

5837839,4,B00DNQCH0Y,"Seth Green and crew have found their stride.

The jokes and stories are better than ever, and Robot Chicken is poking fun at some areas that were previously off limits.

The scenes with the Avengers had me rolling on the floor, and I don't want to spoil it for you.  The first bit was funny, and the second sendoff was hilarious and likely correct.

I highly recommend RBC Season 6.",1393459200,,382,4.414285714285715
