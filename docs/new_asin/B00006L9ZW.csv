1784349,2,B00006L9ZW,"I do really like Wagner's ""Ring Cycle"" but this particular segment done

by Jerusalem & Co. is, put bluntly,atrocious. I can't figure out why the

casting director (or whoever it is responsible) chose this guy Jerusalem to play and sing the hero of heroes--Siegfried.  I would put him in some

Rossini opera, for he lacked the vocal and physical power of this Wagner hero. Excuse me, Mr. J.--no offense intended!",1163635200,3,412,4.8428571428571425
1784350,5,B00006L9ZW,"This Met production returns to Wagner's original intentions, after decades of Bayreuth regietheater productions.  While these were interesting, they make what is already a complex story harder to grasp, at least for those new to opera. Although I know the ring quite well, I find regietheater Wagner gets annoying with repeated viewing.  It tells me more about the stage director's ego than Wagner's hidden messages.  Regietheater can be very good when the director has a worthwhile plan.

I have been able to watch many Wagner opera DVD. This Siegfried is much better than the others despite flaws in singing and staging.

Vocally this Siegfried is good by today's standards, but it's Brunnhilde and Siegfried do not compare to Nilsson and Windgassen on the 1962 recording conducted by Solti.  In compensation, we get James Morris as the Wanderer on this DVD who out sings his mentor Hans Hotter on the 1962 recording.  The remaining voices are equally good on both these versions.

Visually things are very good except for a Fafner which looks like a heap of dirty rags proped up with broken broomsticks.  Act one is as perfect as any Wagner staging could be with very realistic forging of the sword, lots of smoke and sparks, plus superb acting by all, provided you accept a very impulsive Siegfried.

Act two before Fafner appears and after his demise is fine too.  Act three has spectacular projected fire, followed by Brunnhilde awakening on a realistic rocky plateau.  Behrens and Jerusalem do better than I thought they would with the duet.  What's more they look good compared to some other wagnerian singers who shall be nameless.  The total effect is very exciting.

This is the only Wagner opera DVD I have that stands up in the long run.  The Met orchestra plays very well in this performance with only a few flubbed notes in act two.  Otherwise it holds it's own despite (sound only) competition from Solti, Boehm and Furtwaengler.  Levine has not always been a favorite conductor, but here he is inspired from beginning to end.

I have only checked out the stereo LPCM sound option which is clean, highly dynamic and demanding of playback equipment.  Voices are a bit forward, but not enough to rob power from the orchestra.  Again, this is as good a balance as one can expect live.

Considering that this is a great period for Mozart opera, but not for Wagner, this is a very welcome release.",1163462400,4,2408,4.821951219512195
1784351,2,B00006L9ZW,"I must first admit that Siegfried is my least favourite opera in the entire Ring cycle. Maybe it's because of this reason that I'm disappointed by what I see and hear on this DVD recording, as there's nothing which can make me like this opera more.
I have nothing really against the staging and direction. However, these come across as being rather perfunctory. At times, the singers are left with nothing much to do for a long period of time. Things are sometimes too static for the music, which are often much more lively than the stage action.
The singing is mediocre. I like James Morris's Wanderer. Siegfried Jerusalem, though musical and mostly accurate, is a little too slender in tone for the hero. I'm not impressed by the Brunnhilde of Hildegard Behrens. The other performers are adequate but no more. The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra under Levine gives a good though not transcendant performance.
Maybe I'm being a little too harsh. But I think this opera has much potential that has been unexplored by the performers and the director here.",1038441600,12,1051,4.844444444444444

7971350,4,B00006L9ZW,"This is a fine performance of SIEGFRIED with traditional, conservative sets and costumes.  The only departure from tradition is the dragon, which looks like a giant slug with tentacles.

The cast is uniformly excellent, with the sole exception of Siegfried Jerusalem in the title role, who is vocally insecure and acts goofily.  Heinz Zednik gives a world-history class performance as Mime, shuffling and twitching, with nervous gestures and Woody-Allen-esque facial expressions which seem to come very naturally to him.  (His performance here is much better than his earlier portrayal of the same character under Boulez, which was splayed, chaotic, and all-over-the-place.)  He makes the character sympathetic without sugar-coating him.  James Morris is better as the Wanderer than he was as Wotan in DAS RHEINGOLD and DIE WALKURE.  He is still and focused, but anguished and finally resigned in Act III.  Unlike many Wanderers, he sings the line ""Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha ha ha, der Witziger...etc"" in the exchange of riddles perfectly.  (This line is a notorious rhythm-buster, especially for Hans Hotter.)

Ekkehard Wlaschiha is superb as Alberich, bitter and menacing with relaxed, powerful high notes.  Matti Salminen sings with depth and menace from offstage, and howls and roars like a real beast during his fight.  Hildegard Behrens is beautiful as Brunhilde.

Levine conducts with weight and purpose, and for once he does not drag.

Strongly recommended except for Jerusalem.  Four stars.",1411603200,,1493,5.347639484978541
7971351,5,B00006L9ZW,"Whoever said Wagner is horrible music must have rocks in their head. This Siegfried rendition is just ethereal and breathtaking. Siegfried Jerusalem is tremendous, so is the Wanderer, the Mime, and of course Hildegard Behrens as Brunnhilde. Just a monumental piece of music especially under the orchestration and conducting of James Levine. The scene sets and light effects are out of this world.",1395187200,,396,5.301587301587301
7971352,5,B00006L9ZW,"I love this production, which I first saw on the television in 1990.

It is this performance that sold me on ""Siegfried,"" which I used to dismiss unfairly--never having actually seen a production--as a crashing bore. Instead, I discovered a delightful fairy tale (albeit not for children of short attention span), with gnomes, dragons, ""talking"" birds, and a handsome hero who wakes the sleeping beauty with a kiss.

I especially enjoyed the performance of Siegfried Jerusalem, who not only portrays the archetypical hero of legend--handsome, bumptious, and more than slightly dense about life and love--but also looks the part. His reaction at discovering Br&uuml;nnhilde's identity as a female is priceless. I am amazed at Jerusalem's staying power in a role that must be physically exhausting. And let his critics have a go at wielding a heavy hammer repeatedly in tempo, while singing a full-voiced ""Notung, Notung, neidliches Schwert!"" The music in that scene is nothing short of thrilling.

Heinz Zednik plays the gnasty gnome Mime--who gets no respect--with such panache that one almost feels sorry for him, and Ekkehard Wlaschiha is delightfully odious as his brother Alberich, whose green appearance predates that of Shrek! James Morris is outstanding as the wandering Wotan, a rather thankless role, since he subsequently drops out of the cycle (It is almost as if Wagner got tired of the character); and Dawn Upshaw's invisible Waldvogel is magnificent. Although some critics complain that Hildegard Behrens is past it vocally, she certainly looks the part of the ex-Valkyrie, newly awakened to love.

The DVD provides subtitles, which I certainly recommend using to enhance your enjoyment of the story and the music.",1306195200,5,1728,5.295620437956204
7971353,5,B00006L9ZW,"Wagner - Siegfried / Levine, Jerusalem, Behrens, Morris, Metropolitan Opera (Levine Ring Cycle Part 3) is a dvd recording produced by Deutsche Grammophon and Universal Classics and was recorded in 1990. The DVD comes with a very fine booklet that contains many photographs of the performance. Karl Dietrich Grwe has written the music notes. Translated into English by Mary Whittall. I am huge fan of Wagner and consider him the king of the opera. His use of the leitmotif is legendary. Highly recommended. 5/5.",1304121600,2,510,5.083333333333333
7971354,5,B00006L9ZW,This is a production that would make Richard Wagner smile. I am so tired of the rubbish coming from Bayreuth and the rest of the Euro trash productions you see lately.,1282953600,6,167,4.419354838709677
7971355,5,B00006L9ZW,"I admit that Siegfried's brief combat with the Dragon can hardly bear comparison with Hollywood's super-dynamic, digital, computerized, Three-D,  multi-dimensional, animated, current versions of similar events, and, beyond that, only in a few minutes in which Wagner's conception strains even the super capacities of the Met team, this is quite absolutely first rate. Production values are outstanding, Levine's conducting and the orchestra, top of the line, Jerusalem an admirable Siegfried in acting and far above that in vocal prowess,  Heinz Zednik is all that can be asked for in a Mime, Behrens' Brunnhilde makes the most of her brief awakening in the Sun of Love, Wlaschiha as Alberich, Salminen as the Voice of the Dragon, Fafner, Brigga Svenden as Erde (the wisest woman in the world who is here given eternal sleep in ignorance), and Dawn Upshaw, all earn plaudits in their brief appearances. James Morris, the Wanderer, never fails to dominate any scene in which he appears. Quite an Onstage presence.
As I have written in other reviews of Wagner,  my viewing is not that of an expert in anything. I'm just a guy who found out that opera is prime entertainment, when one has subtitles to provide blow by blow understanding of what is being said and sung. While it is unimaginable to me that Wagner, or anyone else, expected an audience to sit through these marathons he has written, certainly, I could not do so, for home listening, Siegfried can provide two evenings of pleasure, unspoiled by the dread audience fatigue syndrome.",1273708800,3,1541,5.035294117647059
7971356,5,B00006L9ZW,"This is the only Wagnerian opera I can get thru 2/3rds of in one sitting.  It moves right along until Wotan shows up and he's always tedious.  But the dialogue between Sigfried and Mime get the opera off to a rousing start up to the incredible ""forging song"".  This must be the most wearing tenor role in opera requiring stentorian singing and banging an anvil at the same time....for a long time.  Yeah, its one of the longest arias in opera, but also one of the most exciting (in fact, I keep hoping it won't end) requiring great endurance.  Jerusalem is up to the task, and he looks very athletic too.  In fact, the typical fat Wagnerian type singers are absent here.  Everyone looks good, except Mime who's supposed to be ugly anyway.

But after our hero slays the Dragon the opera goes on for 2 more hours.

If you want love duets go to Puccini.......this one is like cement setting.

All the singers are well up to the task and Morris has always been a favorite bass of mine.  However, this role is pretty dull and doesn't show his characterization abilities.

I am no Wagnerite, but perhaps some of the tempi were a bit slow??  I've noticed in Italian opera, Levine is occasionally so slow as to diminish the lilt of the music, making a bouncy character ponderous.",1249344000,,1271,4.497816593886463
7971357,5,B00006L9ZW,"If you are interested in seeing this by all means buy it and forget those yahoos with their negative reviews. I have the first three operas of the Ring Cycle and hesitated on buying the third because of some of the opinions stated here but it is wonderful.  And I will buy the fourth. I watch it on my 37"" HDTV and feel like I'm sitting in the first row of the Met and enjoy them all immensely.  So a big raspberry to those cynical reviewers and a big hand for Levine and company.  You give so much joy.",1214870400,4,503,4.0606060606060606
