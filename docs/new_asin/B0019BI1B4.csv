3432074,4,B0019BI1B4,"Colm Meaney is a wonderful Irish actor who has been outstanding is every role he has played, but ""A Lobster Tale""--in which he stars--may be one of his best.  It is a low-budget, delightful, uplifting story of a Down East lobsterman who finds some miracle moss, and his odyssey thereafter.

He is joined by Alberta Watson as his wife, and Jack Knight as his son; and Graham Greene gives a terrific low-key comic performance as the local sheriff who tracks down the ""culprits"" who steal the moss.

This is a film about life and what is truly important about it, which can be viewed and enjoyed by everyone in the family, and that is rare these days.  It is light-hearted comedy at its best, and refreshingly different--with a cast that will enthrall you.",1227571200,3,753,4.639097744360902

3432076,5,B0019BI1B4,"I saw this film at a friend's house, and fell in love with it!  A warm, sweet family film in an age where all too many films contain violence or crude humor.  My two boys (ages 5 and 7) both loved the story, and it held their attention the whole time!  I bought myself a copy (which we are watching over and over again), and am giving it to my friends as gifts.

If you have children and are looking for fun, sweet non-animated movies, you will love this!",1218412800,7,455,4.078651685393258

3432078,4,B0019BI1B4,"I watched this film last night and fell in love with it. It is a beautiful portrait of the hard, poor, basic life of a small time lobster fisherman trying to make ends meet  with an old house in dire need of work, an old lobster boat with  a tempermental motor. The portrait includes the townspeople  where the old coastal town and it's atmospohere is carefully and patiently portrayed. The lobsterman  Cody Brewer ( Colin Meaney), while pulling lobster pots finds a peculiar green moss in his lobwster trap and out of curiosity puts in a can and continues his work. He has motor trouble and when reaching down to the propeller the engine starts and cuts off one of  his fingers. He  reaches into the water and grabs his finger  and puts it in the can to take it to a hospital for possible surgery. His hands is hurting sol much he plunges it into the can with the wet moss to take some of the pain away. A bright white light  occurs and he removes his hand finding the finger mended back to his hand and in perfect working condition. A miracle. This normally would be a very obsurd scene but is handled in such a manner to be accdeptable to ones mind.  A series of similar miracles take place shortly with the moss and word gets out to the townspeople  about it and we come to the essence of the film.  With each miracle the moss gets smaller so he now suspects that he has one or two miracles left in the moss. The entire town wants to use the  moss for many small  personal uses but  Cody refuses to let it be used and is hoping for some inspiration to tell him  the proper use of the moss. Eventually after  denying many temtations  a boy is saved from terminal cancer  when his son steals  the moss to help him. The story ends with the family and Cody continuing their life as before. My narrative does not do justice to his tale for it is really like a Norman Rockwell picture. The life style of the people  in this little coastal fishing town is so well done that one feels this little lobster tale is just what a small village like this deserves.",1217030400,17,2054,4.272020725388601

3432087,5,B0019BI1B4,"I am a big fan of Graham Greene (""Dances with Wolves,"" ""Northern Exposure,"" and as Slick Nikia in the PBS Tony Hillerman movies) and Colm Meaney (""The Commitments"").  Plus, I love well done cultural movies (e.g. ""Fargo"") and this is spot on for the Down East lobstermen community.  And what a lovely human story!  WHAT A FIND!!!",1237939200,,328,4.719298245614035
3432088,2,B0019BI1B4,"I enjoy all types of movies and I have a great ability to stretch my imagination. This was one of those attempts to have a serious background in a fantasy movie but the fantasy is so stretched that when the moment it first appears you can hear yourself moaning "" oh geeze "". There are many movies that can bridge this gap especially movies like the Secret of Roan Inish. The scenery is beautiful.",1235865600,,396,4.364864864864865

8273364,4,B0019BI1B4,"I was sent this film a few years ago from the Family Feature Film Organization.  While I liked the plot, some of the way the actors and actresses spoke their lines seemed a little amateur. I did enjoy the humor many of the characters showed such as the sheriff,  the over-weight mechanics., and the unique-looking Mortician.  I also loved the happy ending.  I did wish that Jake would have been allowed to tell his Dad why he gave the moss to who he did.  My very favorite part is the beautiful Irish music theme song that plays in the beginning and ending of the movie.  I have watched the movie many times just to listen to it.

8273371,4,B0019BI1B4,"*  After first viewing A Lobster Tale from a 2009 full-frame DVD version distributed by Feature Films for Families checked out from a library, I came away thinking the movie was confusing and incomplete and suspected it might be due to poor editing and direction. I liked Colm Meaney's portrayal of Cody Brewer as a stoic, self-reliant Maine lobsterman who, with his wife Martha, struggle to keep their family financially above water in a lean lobster season, but neither character has an arc. The only character with an arc is Cody's son Jake whose arc was more an inexplicable jump at the end of the movie.
*  The film creates drama by using a device in the form of a small amount of a vibrant green moss exhibiting seemingly magic medical properties. When a pharmaceutical company offers the Brewer family $500,000 to keep the moss off the market, friction occurs between Cody, who wants the moss to make a ""real difference"" and his son Jake, who is bullied and marginalized at school for his threadbare cloths and his families' hand-to-mouth existence, and sees the money as a chance for normalcy.
*  Since I liked the characters and since the run-time of the FFFF version is 1:23:09 (83 minutes) compared to a 95 minute run-time for the original movie, I bought a DVD copy to see what had been cut by FFFF. I ordered a full-frame version with 95 minute run time and received a DVD with UPC 625828230301 distributed by kaBOOM!, a division of Peace Arch Entertainment, for distribution in Canada, whose case lists FULL FRAME, Spanish subtitles, a theatric trailer and a Making Of featurette. The case list is incorrect in that only the featurette is full frame, the movie is anamorphic widescreen with 1.78:1 aspect ratio that adds considerably to the depth and framing of the images.
*  The 95 minute version of the movie confirms a Jake Brewer coming-of-age subplot, seen through conversations between Jake and his schoolmate Mike Stanton. In their first conversation, Jake mentions Mike is his best friend. In a later conversation, Mike admits that he really misses his father who drown five years earlier. In their last conversation Mike mentions that Jake should have written something in their class' get-well-card for the class bully Timmy. The end of this scene is deleted by FFFF beginning when Jake says he doesn't ""give a crap about Timmy"" causing Mike to unload frankly on Jake. The scene ends with a close-up of a pensive Jake watching Mike walk away, a look repeated when Jake later encounters Timmy's parents leaving for the hospital. Jake needs to consider whether the life of another person is worth $500,000, something the filmmakers do not address explicitly, so one must watch the final nine minutes of the movie closely to see Jake's decision.",1448582400,,2767,4.8559322033898304
8273372,1,B0019BI1B4,"This movie is NOT PG.  I bought it as a family movie, and I was watching it with my kids, and all of a sudden a guy drops his pants and you see his bare behind!
