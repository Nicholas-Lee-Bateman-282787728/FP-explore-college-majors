3983502,5,B002T44YTI,""" Young Frankenstein "" is a movie classic . Gene starred in it. Ergo., it escapes any opprobrium critics might aim at it !

3983503,5,B002T44YTI,A film that looks into the artistic and personal life of a great performer and person.  Next time I see one of his films I will better appreciate all that an actor has to do to achieve what looks oh so easy.,1406851200,,207,3.9285714285714284

3983506,5,B002T44YTI,"Wendy proves to be an excellent interviewer and Gene Wilder is charming, open and eloquent in this hour plus exchange in front of an audience in 2005. I need to add that this in a DVDR and I've watched it a couple of times and there is sometimes playback issues. As a fan of Gene Wilder I found this a treasure..and at only ten bucks well worth it!",1265500800,3,348,4.132352941176471
