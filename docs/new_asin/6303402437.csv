7845764,5,6303402437,"On Thursday, December 6, 1956, at 9:00 pm CST, the NBC television network aired PROJECT XX:  THE JAZZ AGE.  I was thirteen years old at the time and in the seventh grade, and I was in the audience that night.  The program made its mark on me, so much so, that I decided to focus on that decade in my study of history--a decision I have never regretted.  Clearly, this program was and still is a very special one for me.

It tells some of the quality of THE JAZZ AGE that almost fifth years after it aired, it was consider good enough to be issue it in DVD format for today's viewers.  The reasons for this, I think, are that

  --it was narrated by Fred Allen, a noted radio personality, whose familiarity with the 1920s and its personalities give his presentation a special, personal flavor;

  --it contains excellent film footage that is unique or certainly not often seen, including some fascinating shots of Paris nightlife; and

  --the editing and accompanying music are first rate--the program flowing smoothly through from start to finish.

What we have in THE JAZZ AGE is a unique production.  I have never seen anything to equal it since I first saw it so many years ago.

The only weakness I can cite is that the discussion of the politics and the economics of 1920s reflects the now mostly discredited New Deal template (see Amity Shlaes'  COOLIDGE and THE FORGOTTEN MAN for an up-to-date discussion of these issues).

So I recommend THE JAZZ AGE to anyone with an interest in that wonderful, vital, and productive decade of the 1920s.",1362873600,,1548,4.6007326007326
7845765,5,6303402437,"As an English teacher trying to illustrate the historical context of Gatsby, this documentary is excellent.  Fred Allen's tongue-in-cheek narration may be difficult for some students, but the issues relevant to the book are obvious and treated appropriately. It is also a fast and quick screening in classes--the first few chapters are all that are needed, up to when the documentary shifts to the expatriates abroad in Paris.",1169856000,8,426,5.264705882352941
7845766,5,6303402437,"What a masterpiece!  I remember watching this program when I was a pre-teen in the mid-fifties.  The film footage, Fred Allen's narration, and Robert Russell Bennett's musical accompaniment are nothing short of captivating.  A must see for students of that era.",1133481600,6,261,5.317073170731708
7845767,1,6303402437,"I was duped into thinking this was a music performance video. It's nothing but a documentary about the '20s. As a documentary, it's great, but definately not for a music buff (musician), like me, who collects music videos.",1019606400,4,222,4.868421052631579
7845768,4,6303402437,Best overall look at the 1920's for students and the people interested in the 20's. Music is right with the times and the film is vintage. Fred Allen is the the host and his old radio voice is right out of the Jazz Age!!,975024000,17,220,4.0227272727272725
