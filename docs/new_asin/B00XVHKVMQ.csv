I'm actually suprised, because I don't usually like watching movies like this. In short, 3 people travel to a ghost town & get imprisoned in a run down high school by this nutjob & he makes 'em kill for their food. Personally, I think they all did a good job acting & I enjoyed their characters. It's Halloween time, so it's the perfect time to watch something like this & hopefully you'll get a chance to watch it on Syfy if they happen to show it again. If not & you can find it on here used & cheap enough, then go for it. Also, I really liked the ending B)

7200505,2,B00XVHKVMQ,"Candice (Mariah Bonner), who does her pregnancy test in a public restroom, is traveling with her boyfriend Beck (Bobby Campo) and his brother Jiminey (Dave Davis) through the Florida Low country. They visit Freedom, Florida because they couldn't come up with cute symbolic names for the characters. Beck is composing a new graphic novel about feral cannibal children who live in sink holes. Warned not to stop and snoop, our threesome end up in a caged fight club where people starve, kill, eat, starve, kill, eat. If you have ever seen a captivity film, I mean like if a friend of yours once saw one and almost explained it to you, you know the formula.

The film opened with the lofty idea of eating the rich to solve world problems, but that had nothing to do with this film.  Note it was night outside, but when Beck uses his cell phone on the roof, it was light out. Not the best in genre.

Nobody acts like a normal person, leaving us screaming at the screen about their idiocy FAR more than actually being worried about a character's life. The only worthwhile characters in the show are the blonde detective lady and the little black girl. Everyone else has no emotion and are made to overact their roles.

7200539,5,B00XVHKVMQ,"Starve is actually a really awesome horror movie!  If you like seeing people trapped in a building and killing each other simply because they're really hungry and can't help it, pull up a seat and get comfy- Starve is the film on your agenda!  You know it's going to be good when it opens with the readable line ""I want to end global hunger by feeding half the world's starving people to the other half"".

It stars Bobby Campo and his girlfriend Mariah Bonner who are visiting an abandoned town.  Bobby's brother Dave Davis comes along for the ride... literally!  We see his head pop up in the back seat a few minutes into the car ride segment.  Bobby likes comic books and he needs inspiration.  What better way than to visit a town with a supposed cannibalism myth that's been floating around!  That's why he's here.  This town is so small the diner is the main attraction.  Wow and I thought *my* town was small!

While Bobby, Mariah and Dave visit the neighborhood and abandoned school late night, suddenly Dave has to use the bathroom.  Now considering it's nighttime most people would just pee (or even poo) in the bushes somewhere close by, but not Dave.  Not pee shy Dave, who insists on inviting himself inside of these homes much to the dislike (and surprise!) of Bobby and Mariah.  They go after Dave but when he's done using the bathroom they hear their car speed away.  Someone stole it!  Darn man, of all the places to have your car stolen, helpless in a small town with people starving and fighting to the death just for a morsel of food has to be the worst.  That's it.  Next year we're going to New Brunswick for vacation!

Dave and Mariah play the blame game.  Dave accuses Mariah ""You shouldn't have left that car alone!"" but of course Mariah responds ""Well, if you hadn't run off like you did we wouldn't have HAD to leave the car alone silly!""  Dave says ""Whatever dudez, I'm outta here"" and runs away (in the middle of nowhere in the dark!) leaving Bobby and Mariah alone.  As Bobby's on the rooftop of the house trying to get a phone signal to call for help a miracle happens.  The thief pulls up to the front of the house and returns their car.  Rejoice, a complete stranger found the car and returned it.  What generosity!  Not!  Instead the man grabs and kidnaps Mariah.  Bobby goes after him and... he's treated to fire extinguisher water/steam right in the face.

When he wakes up, he and his girlfriend are stuck inside an abandoned school building.  They get the privilege of hearing the morning principal over the loud speaker (Cooper Huckabee's character).  He's a very creative speaker too.  He announces that he wants to find out what people are capable of when pushed to the brink of death.  Oh, my school never offered this program!  He says ""If I starve a man long enough he'd be willing to do anything to stay in his own skin, maybe even kill you for nothing more than a sandwich"".  At least this guy isn't trying to act like a principal.  Then again he *does* have an amazing vocabulary, constantly informing Bobby, Mariah and the other starving trapped people what they're fighting for.  On a personal note he educates me in a big way.  Lots of words I've never heard of!  An A for creativity.

This movie instantly reminds me of the Hunger Games (no pun intended) because it makes me think of people killing each other to survive.  Except in this case, it's not really an official game by any means, and it's actually *hunger*-related.  This is just a little twisted game by Cooper's character.  He explains why he's playing this game later on, and it's a good one.  Not that I agree with it, but it proves anger can consume somebody beyond rationality!  The objective here is much worse than the Hunger Games though.  Well then again maybe not!  The more I think about it, the more the Hunger Games really was something incredibly twisted and sick since those killings were legalized apparently.  If someone ever found out what Cooper's been doing, well, he'd surely be in a world of trouble!

Anyway Bobby soon finds out what's going on here.  He has to face a man who claims he killed 3 or 4 people just to survive.  Bobby doesn't want to do it, but Cooper with his constant loud speaker commentary insists the fight might go on!  Bobby takes care of this hairy-faced guy better than he thought he could.  I guess shavers and razor blades aren't provided here.  Bobby smacks this guys hand really hard with a metal pole and he pulls his own gooey hand off and continues the fight.  Ew!  So hungry!  What happens next doesn't make sense.  Bobby kills the guy by jamming the pole through his chest, but when he falls over the pole is hanging beside his neck.  Huh?  I guess all that matters here is that the man's dead so Bobby can be rewarded a nice meal!

And what does Bobby win?  Food!  Soft biscuits and a rusty jug of water or milk.  Well at first he's ungrateful and tosses his plate at this demented looking ""guy"" who is basically an oversized prison guard.  He provides food to these trapped prisoners and walks around keeping an eye on them.  He's also very quiet and mysterious.  We find out who he is later though, don't worry!  There's other prisoners here, and it's hard to fathom just how many.  Sometimes Bobby and Mariah are allowed to be in the same room together.  At least Cooper has a forgiving side to his twisted obsession with starvation!  When Bobby rejects the food in anger and apologizes, Cooper forgives him.  Must be because they're in an abandoned school and well, school *is* where we learn to share and forgive.  *love hearts!*

It's never said how long Bobby and Mariah have been in here until laer, but the answer is that months have gone by.  Good Lord!  The way the story develops it makes it seem like they've only been trapped for hours and they're *already* killing each other over a tiny amount of food!  Neither Bobby nor Mariah show any signs of being around here for months, such as Bobby's facial hair.  He looks as nice as he did the moment he arrived to this dump.  Well wait, maybe razors *are* provided, hehe!

There's other people trapped here.  A small black woman who occasionally provides Bobby and Mariah with drinks, and a guy who doesn't want to kill but he's just *so* *darn* *hungry!*  Oh and how about that ""loud, ill-tempered violent woman"" that Cooper mentions over the speakers?  She has to fight... Mariah!  She blurts out cuss words just because.  Oh boy who'll win this match?  She's quite the huge woman indeed.  Much bigger than Mariah by quite a bit.  Mariah wins the fight though!  How is this possible?  By taking a pair of scissors and jamming them in the woman's head, that's how!

The movie also has a humorous side to it.  For example in one segment Bobby knows Mariah should have been given food since she won the fight, but the prison guard guy with his demented face won't hand it over.  Bobby reaches through the prison bars and grabs it, but in a moment of anger he EATS it by mistake to prove his overpowering abilities.  This upsets Mariah who deserved to eat that food.  I think it was a piece of pizza.  Wow one piece of pizza for killing a dangerous woman.  I loves me that pizza so sign me up!  Just kidding.  Anyway the humor comes when Bobby says ""Want me to stick my fingers down my throat?"" implying he'll bring the food back up so his girlfriend can have it, and Mariah replies ""You'd do that for me?""  This is true love folks!

The humor also comes in the way of Cooper's commentary.  On one occasion he mentions they better eat because there's starving people in... South Dakota.  LOL!  I was always told by my parents when I refused to eat that there's starving people in China or some faraway land- not South Dakota, haha.  I almost laughed out loud when I heard Cooper say South Dakota!  He also says ""They say women can be more cruel to each other than men.  I sure hope so- I love a good cat fight!""  lol  Cooper's commentary continues to excite.  ""In the beginning you're just racked with hunger.  Then the body begins eating itself.  First the fat than the muscles emaciation.  Lack of proteins and minerals. Disease begins to set in.  Worse is what it does to your body, your mind, your will, your spirit.  But it makes for some great entertainment!""

Surprise surprise!  Dave returns!  He wasn't kidnapped with Bobby and Mariah and was kidnapped later.  They probably should've showed how it happened.  My guess he ran off into the woods and was caught.  He's been taken to this horrific prison school building for more torturous entertainment.  The feeling, and I'm sure I wasn't the only one, is that Dave was going to come back with a vengeance and save the day like a good comic book hero Bobby can write about!  That's why he wasn't caught with his brother and Mariah.  But no, instead Dave returns as a prisoner so he was caught after all (probably by Cooper since he likes to drive around town and besides having a knowledgeable brain and solid commentary skills, doesn't do much else!)

He traps Bobby and Dave in the room together.  Oh boy!  This is a special occasion for Cooper.  ""I want to find out if blood is thicker than... hunger!""  He gets to see two brothers fight to the death!  SPOILERS- Dave blows his brains out with a gun.  He mentions something like ""You always looked out for me, now it's my turn to look out for you"".  Cooper loves it.  You can see him eating snack foods while watching this stuff on his ceiling cameras.

Let's talk about Cooper's story and why he's starving and trapping people.  I certainly wanted to know why someone is so obsessed starving people!  Here's why-

When trapping Bobby and Mariah in the cage, they listen closely like two campfire boyscouts to the twisted story Cooper shares.  A man, wife and son live in a town called Freedom.  Once thriving, but now declared a disaster area.  The government ceases land and the town becomes a forgotten footnote.  This family has their car swallowed in a sink hole.  No one knows the family is trapped down here so no one looks for them.  They have no food- just a jug of water for the motor that keeps overheating.  The only thing that keeps this family alive in fact, is that water.  They have a choice- eat or die"".

""Many scientists will tell you starvation isn't that painful.  You find out what kind of person you are when your physical self wastes away.  What you're capable of.... like killing your own son and eating him to keep yourself alive for a couple more days in the hope rescuers will come!  Someone finds the man, but he already killed his son.  No going back to society after that ordeal.  To make matters worse, methane leaked into the hole and had an effect on the man's wife.  Cooper continues- It's why she stays covered up.  Society left them to waste away and die.  Freedom is his now, so when good folks come nosing around we have a game we like to play to give them a taste what this family had to go through"".

You probably figured it out... this is Cooper's family he's talking about!  Cooper had to go through this traumatic son-killing event.  The wife is... ding ding!  That mysterious prison guard who keeps walking around!  Cooper gives Bobby a choice- starve to death or you can kill your wife and have a nice dinner.  Hmmm, I think by the next day I won't care about dinner anymore and will be hungry again, so I think I'll choose option A!  It's apparently not painful either so yeah, that one!

This movie requires suspending disbelief on numerous occasions.  Who can believe that these people would all have something in common- they're willing to kill complete strangers and loved ones just to prevent them from starving?  And there's no guarantee Cooper will provide them with a nice satisfying meal either.  He might give them something small like a biscuit, or nothing at all.  Depends if he's having a bad day or not.

I would never choose to kill just because of hunger pains... or ""pains"" rather, since it's apparently not that painful.  If I was trapped in a building and couldn't eat anything I'd just allow myself to get weak, pass out and eventually die.  At least Cooper gets what's coming to him by the end, but even the way Mariah *should* have been killed the way that car slams into her really hard only to get to her feet again (what?  NO WAY!) is hard to swallow (er, hehe.  More puns, my bad!).  The point is, the thought of killing someone just to survive isn't realistic!  Still, awesome movie.

I never even mentioned the scene where a blonde haired woman shows up to town questioning those in the diner if they've seen the missing teens.  It just so happens Cooper's there that day.  He admits he's seen them... because he wants to lure this woman to that building and have her fight to the death in one of his hunger cage matches!  You can't fool me Cooper!  She... surprisingly puts up a fight against that African American man, but gets mentally weak by saying ""I can't do this anymore!"" thus letting her guard down and getting a knife in the mouth.

Awesome story, acting and everything else.  Highly recommended.",1498608000,,13120,4.516197783461211
7200540,1,B00XVHKVMQ,"I can usually take anything because I have a strong sense of the differfence between reality and fanatasy. However, this is truly a sicko cruel-fest. There is absolutely no reason here except an indulgence in sadism.",1497916800,,216,5.027777777777778
7200541,4,B00XVHKVMQ,"I'm going to be honest, I didn't hate it. I am constantly on the lookout for new horror movies to watch, so I've watch enough really really crappy ones that maybe my rating system is a little skewed. I probably am way more forgiving than most people when it comes to horror movies. At this point, I look for something that keeps my attention, that I'm not constantly rolling my eyes through, where the acting isn't so bad it seems like a porno is going to break out at any moment..etc.

This is definitely  not a high budget movie, but is better than a lot of B rated movies I've seen. It is a little corny at times, the story line definitely has holes in it, but I didn't feel like I was suffering through like I do with many horror movies. The plot is not all that unique and has a saw aspect to it, but I think it holds its own well.

One of my favorite things about this movie is that the main characters, especially the female lead, aren't your average horror movie idiots. I especially like the fact that the main girl doesn't run around screaming like a chicken with her head cut off and doesn't fall into the normal weak minded hysterical female role that so many horror movies use.

If you are used to high budget movies with lots of jumps, amazing acting, spotless plots, you probably won't like this. If you like horror movies but have watched all mainstream, B rated and even the C rated horror movies (is that even a thing) that you can find, you probably well at least be semi entertained with this one. And again, as a warning, I watch a lot of horror movies so these days my ratings aren't always about how wonderful the movie itself is, but how it compares to all the other ones I have watched and how much I did or didn't feel like I wasted my time. This may not be a accurate representation of high expectation audiences.",1487289600,2,1840,4.293948126801153

The tormentors have a unique reason for their brutality which is revealed in a twist ending.

A group of young adults head out to a Florida ghost town to investigate the feral people who live in its sinkholes. Once there, they are trapped in an abandoned high school with other prisoners. The prisoners here are starved for days and then forced to fight to the death for a meal.

This movie was very well done. The acting is very good and the special effects are convincing. The cinematography is well executed, with the inside of the school presented in a genuinely creepy way. All told, this is an excellent film. My one gripe is that it hurt to see that boulder go through the windshield of that classic Trans Am.",1464134400,,754,4.544117647058823

Instead, I was treated to a wildly entertaining film that held my attention from the beginning to the end. Granted, there have been many films along this line in recent years, but for fans of 80s style horror-this one delivers. I enjoyed the fact the film took itself seriously and there were no attempts at toilet humor or comedy through the whole thing.

I felt the story wasn't overly complicated and it was told quite well. It had a good pace to it and was certainly captivating pretty much all the way through. There is quite a bit of gore of course, but not too much to where it's distracting from the story or becomes the main part of the movie.
