8403983,4,B003S3SNJG,"This film moves really fast 99 min seams like a half hour.  The story entermingles two story lines really well, and the up and coming actors in this film blew me away.  Yes, it's a low budget film, but after five minutes I didn't care about budget, I was caught up in the story.  There is some comedy, drama, and action.  The mafia Don (Vincent) is subtly pulling all the strings through the whole movie, and we don't see it until the end of the film.  It's the first time I watched a film over again right away, because I had to see the story play out again knowing the ending.  I think this film is masterfully done for any budget.",1277510400,2,633,4.190082644628099
