8364211,5,B002CLSOS0,"This is my DVD review for Dragon Ball Kai 3 (Dragon Ball Z Kai Vol. 3) on Japanese DVD, NTSC Region 2.
This volume contains episodes 7 to 9 in 480i widescreen, where the Z-fighters (ex. Piccolo, Gohan, Krillin, Tenshinhan) come prepared for the arrival of two more Saiyans that are stronger than Raditz, the incoming threat are Nappa and Vegeta. Son Gokustill has a long way to go before he officially returns to Earth.
What's about to happen in a tragic power struggle between the Z-Fighters and the Saiyans can be relived in the third volume of Dragon Ball Kai with true footage kinda like the broadcasts themselves. It's also part of Season 1 to all Dragon Ball Z Kai fans out there!",1482019200,,686,4.540322580645161
