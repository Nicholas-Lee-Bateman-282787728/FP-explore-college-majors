8306888,4,B001GT12XS,"Starring, again, the lovely Ana Luisa Peluffo as the female gangster 'Camelia La Texana,' this 1978 sequel to the previous year's ""Contrabando y Traicion"" (""Treason and Contraband"") opens with a 3-minute summary of that film's highlights (basically all the action and intrigue) - a sort of 'Our story so far' sequence - then jumps right into this film's story proper, which involves Camelia (Peluffo) fleeing the world of Mexican crime for a (hopefully) peaceful, semi-rural existence across the border in Texas.

There she meets and falls in love with macho and dashing caballero Juan Gallardo, who impresses her at the local cantina (which looks like any number of barrio restaurants I've been in, with its bare linoleum floors and cheap-looking wood-paneled walls - it's like the film budget was all spent on Peluffo's costumes, with nothing left over for set dressing, location scouting, blanks for the guns or much of anything else) in a round of Russian roulette with the local bully/rich guy. Then there are some romantic montages that look like cigarette commercials late '60s American television, which the humiliated bully/rich guy covertly observes (practically twisting his mustache like a silent movie villain), then sends out some henchmen to whack Peluffo and her beau...

Eventually, Peluffo and Gallardo are obliged to return to her criminal life in Mexico, where she now runs the gang previously headed (I assume - I haven't actually seen the original film, and my Spanish is less than good) by Valentin Trujillo (who's killed - by Peluffo - in the pre-credit flashback). There's various intrigues, plus Peluffo does a striptease/sexy dance for (I think) her henchmen and/or the guys in a bar owned by her gang. Angelica Chain plays Peluffo's gangstress rival (who Peluffo refers to as a ""perra maldita!""), and it all ends with a bloody shootout. (The film's title pretty tells you what the results of that are.)

Don't let my seemingly negative asides above put you off from this film, because it's very entertaining and fairly involving, despite some of the production shortcomings (e.g. gunshots are almost all Foley'd in with no concomitant muzzle flashes - it's almost like watching little kids playing cops and robbers sometimes, except that then they occasionally throw in some bloody squib action). Peluffo's the whole show here, really, with some of the most outrageous, eye-popping '70s-style outfits; plus during much of her striptease/sexy dance she's essentially naked but for a nearly non-existent push-up bra and a thong. And, she's actually a pretty good actress, striking just the right balance between Joan Crawford-esque bitch goddess and Mafia opera.",1258502400,,2688,5.232018561484919
