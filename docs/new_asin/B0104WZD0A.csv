HAHAAH she knows almost every word! I baught this dvd for her from the tooth fairy. haha",1456963200,2,310,4.271186440677966
7305045,5,B0104WZD0A,"FANTASTIC show for young boys. They will LOVE the fun intro song, and goofy antics of these ducks! My boys can't stop shouting ""BOOTY KICK!"" (as seen in episode 1), and simply saying those words will get them to stop what they're doing and shake their butts, shouting, ""BOOTY KICK! BOOTY KICK!""

Lots of silly fun, with some emphasis on gross humor that boys are fascinated with. All clean, however - nothing felt over the top or inappropriate. Your mileage may vary, depending on how sensitive you are to jokes about farts, bad breath, etc. The bad breath episode could even be said to entertain adults more than kids, as it mostly centers around Buhdeuce's job difficulties while cursed with the STANK BREATH! lol (I think we've all had moments like he experiences in that episode!)

Another fun episode features the ducks battling a sink full of dishes so dirty that the mess has literally come alive (with tentacles and all!)! lol I love how the ducks basically avoid the chore for most of the episode, going as far as playing a dish-washing arcade game rather than actually washing the dishes! :) I think episodes like this are great springboards for teaching kids valuable lessons about hygiene, hard work, and chores. And the show is so silly/crazy, it really plays with your adult expectations and surprises you with its wackiness (making it more enjoyable to watch, for adults, than the more predictable, slow, educational programs).

In other words, I think this is a fantastic show for parents to watch with their young boys, and that there are plenty of topics brought up that are great for discussion and education. It doesn't take itself seriously, which is great, and features ducks delivering bread to other ducks! lol How unique is this program? The main characters are named SwaySway and Buhdeuce! :D (You haven't lived until you've heard a 3 year old shouting those names happily! lol) I highly recommend this show and a nice visit to a local duck pond (with bread, of course)! :)",1451692800,4,1999,4.805232558139535

Edit:

It's getting boring over time and I don't want to be annoyed by this cringy crap. I'll just sell my copy.",1439251200,,237,4.130434782608695
7305050,1,B0104WZD0A,"I hate this awful show. Everything is lazy. The main charaters are ducks. I did not know that because THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE DUCKS!!!!!! They look like cartoon Rejects. There are other ducks in the show, but they a stubid stock images. Retro cartoons don't have those stubid stock images. It is not animation. They slapped a picture on the storyboard. The jokes are lazy and a disgrace to video games. That's right, they have terrable video game jokes. Why does this show exist. It is not creative and why would nickeoden make a show based off a youtube video know one watched. I understood fred because it is viral but this?? And cartoons now a days need to stop using stock images and have better animaters. This show has little art because everything else is stock images. This is like Angela Annaconda all over again. Another bad show which does somthing simular. The show got terrable reviews. Why would this be your role model. Are you trying to make crap. Don't watch it!",1439164800,6,976,4.614942528735632

8721365,1,B0104WZD0A,"This series is mindnumbingly bad!  It lacks any depth or direction.  It does nothing but enforce the outdated sterotype that cartoons are just ""kids stuff"".  It is an outright insult to the art of animation and those who enjoy it.",1474934400,2,230,4.7

8721368,5,B0104WZD0A,"This is honestly my favorite cartoon ever (and I'm in my 20s!). The world of Breadwinners is brimming with lovable characters, colorful scenery, and all kinds of silliness. Altogether it is a fun, imaginative, and upbeat show. Very enjoyable to watch!

Reviewing the DVD itself, the quality is... decent. Being a DVD and all, you'd get better quality from buying the episodes digitally online. However, the price is great for getting the whole first season! I just wish it came with some special features, too; it would have been a real treat.

I encourage you to buy the DVD if you like the show! Nickelodeon doesn't air Breadwinners enough as it is, so it's good to have the episodes on hand to watch whenever you want! Anyway, ""hasta la yeasta,"" my ""baps!""",1466640000,,759,4.742424242424242
8721369,5,B0104WZD0A,"Breadwinners is one of the most hated Nickelodeon cartoons ever created, but I can't imagine why, because this show is really original, goofy, high-energy, screwy-cartoony fun! Every minute of every episode I watch, I have a big, silly smile on my face that refuses to go away. So ignore the haters, this cartoon was simply just ahead of it's time.",1466553600,,348,4.816666666666666
