968864,3,6305104557,"Two grudging masters both skilled in fighting and magic fight it out in hopes of deciding who the greater man is.  Both with their own desciple each tries to find ways to hold the other one back.  But while trying to disrupt each other they both find them selves in trouble of their own.  Some good Comedy, and some surprisingly good fight sequences as well.  Little too much talk for my liking but the fights made up for it.  In my mind not a bad buy.",990316800,5,452,4.209302325581396

968866,3,6305104557,this is a funny movie. There are a lot of taoist tricks in this movie. Some people like that. I would call this a toaist movie. Though thier are skilled martial arts scences.,960249600,,174,4.303030303030303

Unfortunately my order was never delivered, the seller insisted that I just had to wait (its now been a month) and Amazon support told me that the order did not exist (despite it being listed in my order history). So don't bother trying to get it through Amazon.

The movie's original name is ""Duel of the Masters"" but is re-branded as ""Gods of Wutang"" for whatever reason. This is not a serious movie, instead relying on plenty of slapstick liberally mixed with taoist magic. There isn't a cohesive story that starts at the beginning and ends at the end, rather it is a string of lightly connected episodes.

The dvd I have access to (not from Amazon) is clearly sourced from a VHS recording. There are various issues with picture quality (and some tell-tale VHS artifacts), but all in all it is an unexpectedly good transfer. Unfortunately it does suffer from incorrect aspect ratio. This is compounded by it not using a single aspect ratio throughout. The encoded display size is 704x480 while 720x480 gave overall better results (some shots, mostly longer, were still overly compressed).

The audio is also fair. Surprisingly, there are two audio tracks -- one in stereo and the other encoded for 5.1 surround sound. I could not tell any difference between the two and both were english dubs. A subtitle track is also present, but empty. It should have been used to convey a few written parts (such as signs), but its absence is not critical.

The DVD encoding consists of a menu and the movie. Given this and its VHS roots it surprisingly enough has relevant chapter marks. Each episode is readily accessible in this fashion. The stereo and surround sound tracks can be selected between from the menu as well. When selecting chapters there is a brief clip played and each chapter is not just titled, but also video thumbnailed. Despite the video issues it is clear that some effort was put into mastering the disk.

If you enjoy kung fu comedy then this movie should be high on your list.",1501804800,,2040,4.687150837988827
7883314,4,6305104557,"Who in the heck makes these wack ass covers? They got the actors' names all backwards and I'm not sure the other guy on the cover is even in the movie. The face under 'sonny yue' is actually siu keung or norman chu (duel to the death, descendant of wing chun) why in the HECK did they name this godz of wu tang?  Was this ever officially released with its oh-RIDGE-inal title 'Duel of the Masters' ? Probably Fung Hak On's ONLY good guy role!
As for the actual movie, it's friggin, wait for it...  AWWWWE-SOME... i remember seeing this on Saturday morning kung-fu theatre back in the 80's.",1425772800,,589,4.394495412844036
7883315,5,6305104557,This movies is wonderfully made. Allot of funny parts in it. This is what you called old school kung fu movie they don't make them like they use too. A must see.,1424822400,,161,4.0625

7883320,1,6305104557,"I love a lot of martial arts movies, however this movie was not what I expected. The movie seem to drag, and at one point I fell asleep. I really did not get the story to this movie, as much as I love martial arts. I was disappointed.",1355529600,,234,3.8958333333333335
7883321,5,6305104557,"I grew up watching Kung Fu theater. Growing up I had this movie on VHS, and when VHS became obsolete I lost this movie... I'm glad I rediscovered it.

This movie is ridiculous in every aspect, but it combined my love of Kung Fu, supernatural, and dumb comedy. If you can't appreciate the campy 70's Kung Fu with the terrible over-dubbed english and bootlegged soundtrack (they love using Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho music) then take your uptight attitude elsewhere.. this movie is fun, light-hearted, and it appeals to me now just as much as it did to me when I was in elementary school. I can say that this movie directly influenced me to become a ghost hunter/paranormal movie & TV show junkie, and it really fueled my passion to take up Chinese Martial arts. I used to run around my yard with my brother with wooden straight swords chasing Chinese Hopping Vampires. I have a black belt ""equivalent"" (because Kung fu doesn't traditionally go by colored ranking belts) in Tien Shan Pai/Northern Shaolin Kung Fu/Wushu.

Are you expecting Jet Li? You're wasting your time giving this movie 1 star.. take it as it is and you'll agree with me that it is a solid 5 stars!",1344816000,,1165,4.650485436893204
