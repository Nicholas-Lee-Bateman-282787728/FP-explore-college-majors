7879292,5,6304934351,"This is one of the cleverest, wittiest films that I've ever seen.  The first time I saw it in the video store I almost didn't rent it but I ended up loving it and laughed from beginning to end.  It's a hilarious send up of dating as told through the lense of Courtney, a woman who's just turned 29 years old.  She is still in search of true love and marriage and the director of the documentary is her best friend who happens to be in love with her.  It is very post-sexual revolution as she yearns for all of the traditional things but is miles from being a virgin or pure in any way.  Courting Courtney is one of the rare DVDs that you could watch twice in a row.  All the segments are great and it's a sophisticated, exquisite form of humor--at least if you ask me.  The ending's a surprise as well.",1109635200,,802,4.135483870967742
7879293,5,6304934351,"I first saw this film when it screened at the Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival and I was very impressed. I'm not normally into comedies, but it was an absolute joy to watch this film and get caught up in the unique storyline and the fine performances Mr. Tarantino brought out of his fantastic cast. For Independent Filmmakers, this is a MUST SEE. You'll be amazed at the production values this great director was able to get out of a $20,000 budget. Absolutely amazing! Check it out!",1078185600,,480,4.593023255813954
7879294,1,6304934351,"The acting is terrible, the script is contrived, the lead characters aren't likable, and the dialogue is not funny. Also, the ""great moments"" are a direct ripoff from ""When Harry Met Sally"".",945907200,2,190,4.96875
7879295,4,6304934351,"For a first feature Paul Tarintino couldn't have done a better job.  This film, which only had a budget of roughly 20,000 dollars, features an amazing cast, and is filled with laughs.
The film follows Nick (Dana  Gould)as he makes a documentary about his best friend Courtney (who he  happens to be madly in love with).
The film has several  ""classic"" moments, and will forever be included in my DVD  collection.
The special features on this DVD, including an AUDIO  COMMENTARY and the TRAILER, are also great for the film buffs.
All in  all, even if your not an ""indy film"" fan, you'll flip over this  romantic comedy from Toasted Films.",945043200,,638,4.684684684684685
