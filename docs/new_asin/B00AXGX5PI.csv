8558871,2,B00AXGX5PI,"This is a DVD-R rip of a VHS with burned-in Greek subtitles (meaning you can't get them off the screen). There seems to be little accurate information about this movie available online (the description here on Amazon is only partially correct), but the original title is El Juego del Diablo, and I feel pretty confident that it was originally longer than the 80-minute version offered by Desert Island Classics. I won't review the film itself -- that would be unfair, given the circumstances -- but the two female leads do good work, and there are some decent creepy shots here and there. Maybe someday someone will give this a proper release. Oh, and if you're looking for the nudity and gore that are standard in European Exorcist ripoffs, you'll be disappointed, as there's none to be found.",1432684800,,794,4.802919708029197
