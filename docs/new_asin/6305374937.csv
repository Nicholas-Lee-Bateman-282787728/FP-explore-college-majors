It clearly shows that wrestlers are athletes and bear the scars and injuries that all athletes endure. At the same time it shows the exaggerated hype that totally obscures the athleticism needed to prosper as a professional wrestler. Students in my high school sports class benefit from watching this video to put this category of sport in the spectrum of sports in this country.",1235174400,,540,5.011111111111111

So hey, save your money and get a subscription to Dave Meltzer's 'The Wrestling Observer' and/or go out and support your local independent wrestling promotion in person!",932083200,4,406,5.029850746268656
