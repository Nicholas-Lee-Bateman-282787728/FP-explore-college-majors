6881897,4,B00QUFHWMS,"Exodus: Gods and Kings

 Many people will point out the vast number of historical and theological errors and quibbles with this film, as I will do below.  Do not let those errors or quibbles throw you off stride.  As a believer I found this film to be respectful of my belief.  It has nothing about it that we can call similar to the gross inventions of a Biblical film from earlier in 2014, Noah.  The sharpest criticism of director Ridley Scott's version of the events in the Book of Exodus involves his showing of the physical manifestation of God in the form of a ten year old boy.  While this departs from the original text, always a risky business in dealing with Holy writ, I found it rather charming and inoffensive.  If the director chooses to use this metaphor for the Almighty such a choice falls within his purview as director.
 The best part of the film for me came from the carefully shown relationship between Moses (Christian Bale) and Zipporah, his Midionite wife played by Spanish actress Maria Valverde.  Not only did those scenes show a tender love story (no issues of nudity) but the whole invented culture of the semi-nomadic Midionite people was portrayed with more strength and verity than the way over done Egyptian culture.  Zipporah wears facial tattoos.  Her clothing looks like something right out of National Geographic in terms of realism.  The wedding of Moses and Zipporah had elements familiar to those who have attended a Jewish wedding.  That part of the film I liked very much.
 Aside from the star, Christian Bale as Moses, Joel Edgerton truly shines as Pharaoh Ramses II, Ramses the Great as history know him.  In the story, Moses and Ramses grow up together in the palace, almost as foster brothers.  Ramses has the kingship as his destiny, Moses lives an entirely fictitious life, unknown to himself at this point.  Moses birth story involves a phantom general and one of Pharaohs daughters who produced an out of wedlock child.  That Pharaoh and most observers note that Moses has the most talent for rule, including the needed wisdom, does not pass by the attention of Ramses.  We can see the tension between the foster brothers.  Joel Edgerton brings this aspect of the story alive but in a very subtle way.  Ramses knows he is second rate but can never let it show that he is anything but magnificently kingly.  Edgerton's Ramses may in fact show signs of madness.  Ramses at the very least shows signs of megalomania and the kind of ruthlessness known to absolute monarchs.
 In supporting roles we find Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley and John Turturro.  None of them have a chance to do more than briefly recite their lines.  However having such actors recite the lines with conviction and intensity makes a real difference.
 The writing and dialog meet the very high standards demanded by a film that cost $140 million to make.  Ditto the production standards.  The professional levels of cinematography, sets and costuming are of the highest quality.  The washing away of the Egyptian army (sorry for the spoiler but most of us know how things turn out) carries every bit of power as the same scene from The Ten Commandments.  Different though, but terrifying in its own style.
 So, I liked the acting, production and the writing, why does this gigantic film get only three and a half saw-blades?
 Director Ridley Scott has Ramses, the Exodus and the battle of Kadesh all happening in the same time frame, which scholars claim to be a defensible contention.  But he also has the Pyramids under construction at the same time, a time error of about a thousand years.  Imagine the battle of Hastings in 1066 with an airplane in the background for a similar time jag.  We know a lot about the battle of Kedesh, the first battle in history where an eye witness account survives but it does not resemble what Scott put on the screen.
 There are dozens of statues the size of the Statue of Liberty strewn about the capital city of Memphis, not remotely realistic.  Scott moves one famous set of statues about 500 miles down stream from their actual site. Every movie director uses steel weapons in movies set in the bronze age so he gets a pass on that.
 His sins on the theological side are more of omission than commission, the Boy as God invention aside.  He never mentions Jethro, Moses father in law by name, which I cannot explain.  The depiction of the 10 plagues Scott handled very well.  We have a sense of repetitive, increasingly horrifying and dangerous plagues smashing the Egyptian people one after the other.  The Egyptian court officials act just as we might think they would-or at least could-act.  One advises the Pharaoh to more or less ride out the events, that they will pass and then Egypt can get on with Egypt's business.  Some try to explain the Divine catastrophes as merely a series of unfortunate but entirely natural events.  The filming of the various plagues is truly movie magic in the highest sense.
 And then the last plague, the slaying of the first born of Egypt while the Hebrew slaves children are spared.  Then and only then does Pharaoh allow the slaves a chance to leave their bondage.
 But I miss the scene in the original text where Arron, Moses's priest, and the priests of the Pharaoh have a magic contest in the throne room.  And I missed the whole Red Sea thing when the event mysteriously switched to the seven mile wide Strait of Tiran, a couple of hundred miles away.  And the whole episode of the Golden Calf never got a mention, only a modified visual as Moses looked down from Mt. Sinai.  And Mt. Sinai, according to Ridley Scott, seems to be sometimes on one side of the Gulf of Eilat and sometimes on the opposite side.  Too confusing.
 This mighty epic falls short of greatness but remains a worthwhile movie experience.  I gathered some $75 million world wide and should do well financially. The film carries a PG-13 rating for violence.",1418601600,3,5935,4.6976744186046515
6881898,5,B00QUFHWMS,"Captivating, lucid, and visually stunning are the three words that come to my mind for this movie. Exodus: God's and Kings takes the viewer on an unforgettable journey through ancient Egypt. The actors' acting and the visual effects for this movie leave you spellbound. I was stunned by how they made this film Biblically accurate, for the most part. The story about Moses remained as it was recorded in ancient Hebrew texts (I think this disappointed the critics, they probably wanted something ""new""). All in all, this film is a great filmfor all who want to view a film about Moseswhich remains true to the ancient Biblical text.",1418515200,7,632,4.861111111111111
6881899,5,B00QUFHWMS,"Definitely appreciate the extremely beautiful epic design of ancient Egypt! Personally I think the animation ""Prince of Egypt"" made by Dreamworks in 1998 was a better story designed especially the brotherhood between Ramses and Moses.",1418515200,3,234,5.714285714285714
6881900,4,B00QUFHWMS,"I watched this movie before reading other reviews, and came away mostly impressed.  This was no word-for-word video Bible story, but neither did it take the kind of liberties Noah did.  Exodus 2014's strength was its characters.  Moses comes across as humble, strong-minded-yet-uncertain, and one for whom words are few.  Recall that the Moses of the Bible said he was slow of speech, and that Aaron was brought on as his spokesperson, and it's easy to see that he is faithfully portrayed here.  Likewise, I loved the Ramsey character.  Yes, he was arrogant, given to arbitrary decisions, and lacking in moral decency.  However, he came across as believable.  This prince of Egypt was raised to rule.  He did not have to swagger obnoxiously, or be over-the-top in his corruption.  His superstitious fear came out with subtlety.  As for the plot, the writers infused some poetic license, and they tweaked the Bible story--but not in a heretical way (think Last Temptation of Christ for one truly offensive to Christians).

As for some of the reviews that have come out (pretty favorable from the entertainment critics, mixed from faith-based ones), I agree that the plot is not close enough to scripture to show within a church.  However, this minister would encourage his congregation to take their non-Christian friends to the show, and then talk to them about it.

Probably the greatest lines in the movie are when Moses argues with the governor of a Hebrew-slave province.  This governor says that the word ""Israelite"" indicates those who fight with God.  Moses counters, ""It means those who wrestle with God--there's a difference.""  That really sums up the movie--it is about those (Moses, Israel) who wrestle with God.",1418428800,2,1723,5.031802120141343
6881901,2,B00QUFHWMS,"This year has been one of the strongest for faith-based movies, at least at the box office, anyway. The biggest turned out to be the one film that dared to bring a little something fresh to a well-worn Biblical tale, and that was Darren Aronofsky's superhero-ish Noah. Whether you smelled what Aronofsky was cooking on that one, after enduring Ridley Scott's dull, badly cast CGI monstrosity Exodus: Gods and Kings you'll be wishing he had been similarly inspired.

A lot has been made of the ridiculous casting already so why bother making fun of it further? Movies aren't made in a vacuum; Ridley Scott has been around long enough to know that, and to fall back on the silly casting practices of old Hollywood is inexcusable. So you want a film set in ancient Egypt full of a bunch of Brits and Aussies? Then this is the movie for you. It would be one thing if the acting was good enough that their ethnicities didn't matter but that's not the case. And Scott has fallen into the trap of relying too much on the ""pop"" of technical wizardry to develop much of a human drama out of Moses' inspiring story of unshakable faith.

Christian Bale brings his typical intensity to the role of Moses, and his story is one even us heathens know by heart. Adopted son of the current Egyptian Pharaoh (John Turturro, caked in makeup like everybody else) and brother to the future ruler Rhamses (Joel Edgerton), Moses serves loyally until its discovered hes actually Hebrew. The Hebrew slaves (including Ben Kingsley and Aaron Paul, sadly underused) know the truth, but Moses is unwilling to accept it until his hand is forced. Rhamses, suffering a twinge of jealousy at the bond between Moses and his father, sees it as a chance to banish him from the kingdom. Exiled, Moses begins a family and is happy until he starts being visited by God, who is apparently a really angry little child. When an angry God-boy tells you to embrace your heritage and free the Hebrew slaves, you do it.

The problem, one of many, is that the middle section of the film sees Moses watching from the sidelines as God unleashes his terrible plagues. Scott seems especially enamored of this section because it gives him a chance to fill the screen with CGI locusts, flies, and toads. At this point in his career Scott has given in to the ""more is better"" way of filmmaking, and as such every one of his epics looks the same. Gladiator resembles Robin Hood which resembles Exodus. What happened to the guy who was able to build personal human dramas within large-scale blockbusters? It's hard to get a read on this version of Moses. He isn't particularly humble, nor does he seem all that dedicated to God's cause. The best scenes of the film are the unintentionally funny conversations he has with a very petulant God, who just wants to rain down death and destruction. The plagues are depicted in all of their horrific glory, but they're still pretty bland visually. Chariot and horse battles have the widescreen appeal we'd expect from Scott but they're hardly up to his past standard.

That's not to say there aren't some good ideas here and there. The first half of the film is hardly spiritual at all, grounding Moses' story in a dedication to family. But this idea is never fully realized and is completely lost to the fantastical, so that Moses remains a man we never completely understand. Perhaps there was a better movie left on the cutting room floor somewhere. So many screenwriters got their hands on the script something was bound to be lost in the process. Unfortunately, what seems to have disappeared is anything to justify watching Exodus: Gods and Kings when popping in a DVD of The Ten Commandments would be more fulfilling.",1418428800,7,3711,4.6871165644171775
6881902,3,B00QUFHWMS,"From 20th Century Fox and the director of Gladiator comes Ridley Scotts biblical drama about a Shepards message that rattles Egypt. After being exiled from the city of Memphis, Moses treks to an outer city where he is given a sign from god to end the slavery under King Ramsays reign. When Mosess warning is not taken to light, mass plagues begin to destroy Egypt that leads to the climatic ending as the waters rise to make way for the Hebrews to escape with Moses.

Its yet another big project that visionary director Ridley Scott puts together that encapsulates the drama and suspense that you see on the big screen. With his previous success with Gladiator, Scott presents a visually appealing look at the story behind Moses that eventually gave way for the ten commandments. Seeing as how Scotts latest work with Prometheus and The Counselor didn't sit well with everyone, some would hope Exodus: Gods and Kings could bring him back to greatness. Did his efforts pay off in this film? As thoroughly entertaining it was to watch the battle between Moses and Ramsays you couldn't help but feel winded by its bloated run-time.

With all non-fiction work and especially with the bible, staying true to the material and events that predated the beginning of time will always have elements left out. As the movie starts we meet both Ramsays (Joel Edgerton) and Moses (Christian Bale) as close brothers who were raised together under the emperors control. When Ramsays discovers that Mosess sister had brought him in from secrecy, Moses would be vanquished from Memphis for good. Never was there a good amount of interaction between both Edgerton and Bale that we could feel for both men. So when Egypt starts to get hit by signs of god your left feeling empty for his character.

I was never to doubt Ridley Scott on the special effects as the movie was visually appealing. The best part of the film would have to be the ocean parting ways for Moses to guide his people to safety while Ramsays army follows from behind. Its been heard and seen time and time again with different incarnations of the story but the oceans parting will always stick out when hearing the story behind Moses. There were parts that looked bad in CGI but you were able to overlook them by the sheer size of the movie as we follow Moses through his quest to fulfilling gods will.

Lets talk about Christian Bales performance as he is one of the best actors in Hollywood today. However, Ill say that Bales attempts here were not all amazing. Not to say I didn't enjoy watching him play the role of Moses, I just felt he hasn't been able to separate himself from previous roles and make it into one of his own. For the most part your watching Moses go from place to place while making some kind of conversation. Even his transformation from working alongside Ramsays to becoming the Shepard wasn't nearly as smooth as his transformation was with his Bruce Wayne turning Batman scenario in the Dark Knight trilogy. I just wish they could have developed the Moses character better with more story behind he and Edgertons Ramsays.

In minor roles we see Sigourney Weaver, Ben Kingsley, Ben Mendelsohn, and John Turturro who are disappointingly wasted. As for their characters having any bearing on the story was totally unnecessary as Egypts fall would be the focal point of the film. Yes some of the actors had more screen time then others but none of it mattered in the end because Ramsays and Moses were the lead actors. Youd think that with a long run-time of 150 minutes you would get some stand-out performances with some of these actors but it was to no effect. One of the problems I have with the movie was that it was nearly 3 hours long. And majority of the film focused on Moses returning to Egypt to warn Ramsays of great destruction that would lie in his wake should the people of Memphis not be freed. With a more tight script and better character development maybe audiences wouldnt be turned away by its slow pace.

I want to give Ridley Scott praise for his efforts here and for being one of the best directors in our lifetime. But time does wear down on people and we are beginning to see that with Scott. Again, he can visually appeal to the audiences with his color palette and technique but is lagging in the script department. Not saying hes going down the lines of Michael Bay but it almost feels that way as Scotts films are beginning to feel empty in ways where its all visual effects that gets his praise. Ridley Scott can amaze and surprise us as he has with Black Hawk Down and Alien, but lets hope he can dish out one more great film before his directing days are over.",1418428800,4,4667,4.5966386554621845
6881903,3,B00QUFHWMS,"""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is director Ridley Scott's modern take on the Biblical saga of Moses and the departure of the Hebrews from Egypt. It is an entertaining and sometimes emotionally enthralling movie that however misses being the sum of its parts.

""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" is visually spectacular. It features some superb special effects. The recreation of Ancient Egypt is entirely believable. The visitation of the plagues on Egypt and the crossing of the Red Sea are exciting and well-done sequences. Despite the complaints about the casting, Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton are quite reasonable as Moses and the Pharaoh Ramses, formerly brothers, now somewhat reluctant rivals. Their dynamic carries much of the plot of the movie. In addition, Christian Bale provides a plausible and highly watchable portrayal of the evolution of a skeptic into a believer. The way in which God presents himself to Moses, as a child, is a dramatic technique that won't suit everyone, although it seems to work in the context of the movie.

If the movie is not a straight retelling of the biblical narrative, it is at least a recognizable version of the story. It is perhaps most challenged in its reluctance to give the characters straight-up credit for their respective religious faiths. Moses, for example, doesn't experience God until after he gets a nasty knock on the head. The various plagues are given elaborate secular explanations, although this may have been tongue in cheek. The Ten Commandments sequence seems hurried and tacked on to the end. Anyway, this reviewer thought it was entertaining, but go see it for yourself. Cautiously recommended.",1418428800,,1653,5.141263940520446
6881904,3,B00QUFHWMS,"Nine Things About the Movie Exodus: Gods and Kings

1. This is a 3-hour epic that is kind of based on the famous Bible story of Moses rescuing the Jews after 430 years of slavery in Egypt. It takes the broad plot outline from the Bible, but makes its own story. To put it another way, I heard two people complaining behind me that it wasn't ""historically accurate"".

2. Christian Bale plays Moses, adopted son of the Pharaoh. He is an atheist, and serves as a general in the Egyptian army with the Pharaoh's real son, Ramses (who was actually born 300 years after the events of the movie, but whatever). Moses helps to keep the Jewish slaves in line. But when he finds out he is actually Jewish, his mind is blown. He does some things that get him exiled, so he goes off and gets married and has a son.

3. About halfway through the movie, Moses gets hit on the head with a rock and then sees God. After that, the personality of Moses completely transforms; you could interpret this new Moses as either a man who has found faith, or a religious extremist with possible schizophrenia.

4. The movie rides a very thin line on the God topic. If you want to believe that the story is basically true, then you are free to believe that. But if you don't think the story is actual history, you are free to believe that, too. The movie provides a possible interpretation of the plagues as a chain-reaction of rare natural disasters that had nothing to do with God, but that fed Moses' religious mania.

5.  Most of the famous plagues appear in the movie, but they go by very quickly. However, we do get a bonus scene of gigantic cannibal crocodiles. And I must admit, the climax at the Red Sea was pretty epic.

6.  For a movie about God's wrath, there sure was a lot of politics, intrigue, and talking in it.

7. The God of this movie is very much the God of the Old Testament. He is inscrutable, sadistic, bloodthirsty, and vengeful. God is definitely not Love in this movie. Ramses even directly asks Moses the Big Question: if your god is real, is such a god worthy of worship?

8. The casting of the movie is just... confusing. It's about people in the Middle East, but all the main characters are white with a vague British/American accent. Sigourney Weaver is in the movie, but she has about six lines. And whoever thought of hiring John Turturro to play the pharaoh, well, there must be a special strain of weed for that.

9. This is a very conflicted movie. And I'm conflicted about it. Visually it's spectacular. There are some amazing set pieces, fascinating scenes, and some great acting. But it does too much. It's a look at society, revolution, and the difference between leadership and slave-driver. Religiously, it tries so hard to include all perspectives that it ends up feeling hollow.
The movie can't commit to anything, so it ends up meaning nothing.",1418428800,4,2863,4.497109826589595

Although it was disappointing how this was nothing like the actual story, the CGI was pretty good and Christian Bale was a great actor. Enjoyed the movie, but we think that people should really learn the Torah if they want to make a movie about it.

I know Moses was raised as a brother to Rameses but to see it played out with brotherly love, brotherly hate and to actually see him living in wealth and authority then become a shepherd in the desert.. it really just transforms my understanding and involves me emotions in the story. Now I can feel it, I can relate to it.  The director took some creative liberties in retelling this story but with an open mind and heart, you will appreciate it.

The only relationship in the film that had any level of depth was Moses and Ramsey's, but even that was inferior to previous tellings.  Some have complained that this movie dragged on.  I actually would have liked it to have been a little longer if the characters could have been flushed out a little more.

As good as Ridley Scott has been in directing so many movies, it felt like he was phoning this one in.  Why would he want to make this if he wasn't going to take it in any unique direction and basically just made an abridged version of what we have seen before?  The only scene that had any impact was when Moses came back into Egypt and saw Ramsey for the first time since being exiled.  Otherwise it felt like a rushed bland film.

The causcasian statues that were originally black, the terrible casting and the lie that they didn't try to reboot The Ten Commandments with it destroys any real possibility the film can have a chance. Why is hollywood still so afraid to show the stories of the prophets and the Son Of Man as a person of Rich melanin?? I gauarentee the experience will leave the audience in a spell like Alex Haleys Roots did in 77' but times 100.. Its time to experience these tales as they were meant and not this total fabrication. Even Cecil B Demille although also a white wash, It was done in wonderful fashion and a great narration throughout with a stellar cast to hold down the tale during our terrible time of wide open racism and oppression to my people of color and melanin. A 1st class major studio tale of this with an all black cast is so overdue its ridiculous and screams fear from our present government and society @ large..  John Turturro, Ben Kingsley and Sigorney Weaver do nothing to add to this Fantastic tale and Epic to offer a great learning tool for this current genertion.

Peculiarly reminiscent of The Dark Knight Rises (2012) the theme of being beaten down and finding strength in defeat takes center stage within Exodus, not to mention the obvious casting of Christian Bale. This isn't a chess match or a battle of the minds between generals as much as it is a soul searching journey for Moses. He is not depicted as a completely delusional mess as Hollywood often does with Biblical characters (Willem Dafoe in The Last Temptations of Christ or Russell Crowe in Noah); specifically Moses suffers from the conundrum of comprehending Gods will. The visual scope remains on the same level of excellence as Prometheus, depicting the beloved tale in a way cinema has never been able to produce.",1514419200,,906,5.087248322147651

6881967,4,B00QUFHWMS,"Exodus has long been one of my favorite books in the Old Testament, and Moses my favorite character. I enjoyed the character's gradual transformation as he learns to trust in his God. I also like that they portrayed God as a child. What's important about this to me is that a child is not threatening. In reality, people have an innate and unhealthy fear of the living God. What better way to come to us than as a defenseless, helpless child. This makes it possible for us to approach him with less fear--as Christian Bale's character eventually did--and found himself in a real friendship with the Almighty. This is art imitating one of the greatest mysteries of Christian life--that we can become intimate friends of God, like Moses. Lastly, the portrayal of marriage of Moses as a ""total gift of self"" was well done and beautifully so. Again, art imitating Christian life--marriage as a permanent gift of self was done well.

We were able to watch it for free, so I didn't mind giving it a try. It actually started out pretty good, with a fresh perspective on some things that are not specifically discussed in the Bible. However, the last half of the movie, while entertaining, directly discounted specifics that are discussed in the Bible. The most disconcerting thing was the portrayal of God as a bratty boy intent on getting revenge on the Egyptians. It seemed the movie was trying to give some sort of scientific explanation for how God brought the plagues on the Egyptians, or how the Red Sea was parted...rather than attributing these things to an all-powerful God who can do as He wishes. The action was good, and the acting entertaining.

There is nothing remotely respectful or awe-inspiring about this film.  There is no reverence or humility before God.  It is certainly a product of the present, where the power and authority of God are denied, and where 'man' puts himself on a level with God, if not above Him.  If anybody really wants to see how this tale should be, they should watch The Ten Commandments, starring Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner.

My husband and I did not watch it from the beginning, but based upon other reviews, I am happy I did not. For one, I hated that God was depicted as a child that is not how our God is. He is not some child, and I find the symbolic representation blasphemous in and of itself. Secondly, I hated that the plagues were chalked up to natural occurrences. Nowhere in the Bible ""God's Word"" does it state that crocodiles attacked people and caused the Nile to become blood. The Lord instructed Moses to use his staff and turn the river into blood. As a matter of fact, the God told Moses to use his staff as an instrument to produce the plagues. The ""parting"" of the Red Sea was totally ridiculous as it appears that an asteroid fell from heaven and caused the sea level to drop? Really??? I also disliked Moses' relationship with God as nowhere does the Bible demonstrate Moses pleading with God to save the Egyptians, and Moses' total disrespect for God. No! Moses had one of the most intimate relationships with God (not including Jesus, of course) as God used to speak face to face with Moses. The movie was sacrilegious and highly offensive. Please do not watch! What I find to be VERY interesting is the fact that Hollywood could so easily use ""magical"" scenes in a movie, but when it comes to something that 100% occurred they dismiss it as a natural occurrence! This movie does the opposite of what it should be doing, which is introducing God to the masses, instead it disrupts the scriptures and portrays God as someone He most certainly is not.

6882053,4,B00QUFHWMS,"Exodus: Gods and Kings is the secular-driven Biblical epic from Ridley Scott that tells a ""grittier"" and more grounded version of events on the tale of the exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt, led by Moses.

The movie is highly entertaining, showcasing the epic scope & scale Scott is well-known for bringing to the screen, but while the direction is solid and the technical aspects are top-notch (especially the visuals), the script lacked emotion, though this is due in no small part to the heavy editing done to the movie, which is missing a solid hour. Now, this is not the only detractor, nor the biggest. No, it's the cast. Now, white-washing is well-known in classic Hollywood, but for it to be so prevalent is pretty bad. Not that the cast is bad (Bale, Edgarton, and even Aaron Paul were all great), but they didn't fit the roles because they aren't those roles. And, while the white-washing is pretty bad, the heavy re-writes on the script did affect the movie too.

Exodus is still rock-solid, stylish entertainment and a great blu-ray to have (especially the Deluxe Edition with all the special features), but don't expect a truly powerful movie (unless a Kingdom of Heaven-sized Director's Cut is released). Also, to clarify my rating really quick. I gave 4 stars instead of 3 because you can't do half stars, so I rounded up because the film is highly entertaining and, technically speaking, well-made in the filmmaking front.",1486080000,,1437,4.837398373983739

Nowhere is Aaron in the story at all....which in the Bible he was Moses' mouthpiece since Moses was not much of a talker...Moses begged God to let Aaron be his mouth piece.

If you're looking for a biblical rendition...run away...run far far away and as fast as you can.

6882098,4,B00QUFHWMS,"Ridley Scot has never made a mystery of his love for heroic peplums and special effects. In fact, with Gladiator and a number of other films, such as Troy, Kingdom of Heaven or his somewhat less successful Noah, he has exhibited these preferences time and time again.

To a large extent, Exodus is therefore more of the same, but on a grand and rather superb scale that can only raise comparisons with Cecil B DeMilles also grandiose but much older Ten Commandments. While one might prefer one style, author and film to the other, Exodus does stand up to such a comparison in my view.

Specifically, there are a number of features in Exodus that are deliberately both inspired and presented differently from scenes portraying similar events in the Ten Commandments. Two of the main examples are the Seven Plagues that hit Egypt and the Ten Commandments themselves which we see carved by Moses himself under divine inspiration. The first  the Plagues  are very much more emphasised with spectacular special effects in Ridley Scots films. This is true for each of the Plagues, especially the frogs, the flies, the locusts or Death itself coming to kill every firstborn in Egypt. The second example, on the contrary, is treated in a deliberately understated way. Moses is only shown as carving the Ten Commandments himself under divine inspiration, something that offers an interesting contrast to Cecil B DeMilles older version where he brandishes them to his people. Another couple of interesting differences relate to some of the films last scenes as the Jews cross the Red Sea, with a gigantic tsunami wave coming back and breaking over Pharaoh and the Egyptian war chariots and the scenes of an aged Moses as he is about to die when reaching Canaan, the land of milk and honey.

There are also some additional features in this film which are entirely absent from - or much less prominent in - the older version. As mentioned by another reviewer, Exodus contains a number of scenes showing the splendour of Memphis in general, of Egyptian architecture and of various palaces, starting by that of Pharaoh, in addition to the unavoidable pyramids.

The most innovative scene, however, is that of the battle of Kadesh, where we find Moses fighting heroically alongside Ramses II. While this is purely the authors artistic license, the scenes are rather spectacular and the chariot charge lead by Moses combined with Moses cavalry charge will remind fans of similar charges from Maximus/Russell Crowe in Gladiator or Balian dIbelin/Orlando Bloom in Kingdom of Heaven. The fact that neither the Hittites nor the Egyptians actually had cavalry around 2000 BC, but only chariots is, of course, a minor detail. Also is detail is that the battle of Kadesh took place years after Ramses had become pharaoh, as opposed to when he was still crown prince.

Then there is the acting of the two main characters. Christian Bale as Moses is just about okay, although I was not overly impressed. However, I found Joel Edgerton rather superb as Ramses, and excellent when expressing the range of complex emotions that the unloved young prince and Pharaoh could feel towards his father and his foster brother.

An entertaining film just about worth four stars.",1477872000,,3241,4.944852941176471

6882112,1,B00QUFHWMS,"First and foremost, if you are not a believer in the Bible it's time to skip to the next review.  This review is unapologetically from a Christians vantage.

I am frankly gob-smacked that the account of Moses and the freedom from captivity/slavery from Egypt is somehow NOT dramatic enough to support a movie without injecting nonsense.  It's ludicrous.  I'm not sure where even to begin, but we may as well start with Moses.  He was not unaware of his heritage, it was not some dramatic/traumatic revelation, he knew he was Hebrew.  When Moses returned to the new Pharaoh[who is NOT named in Scripture] asking him to free God's people, he was not a young man, nor was he brash.  In fact, we know Moses was the humblest of men, 'slow of tongue', perhaps having a stutter or another speech impairment, regardless, Moses brother Aaron went with him, assisting.  None of this was brought out in the film...no they had to make him out as a self-centered, arrogant jerk, a younger man with no regard for his God.
The treatment of the 10 Plagues was nearly laughable and poorly produced, as well as making Moses look like a delusional lunatic which was never the case.  The final release of the Hebrew Nation was just sadly shown, as well as the miracle's from God...again, not dramatic enough. [roll eyes]

So, if this was made for an audience of non-believers, okay, then give it a generic title: Attack of the Non-Egyptian, or something and name the lead character Baleious Stupidous, anything but Moses.  Genesis probably shouldn't be mentioned either, nor reference to the True God, Jehovah, brief though it was.  This account of Moses was given the same abysmal treatment as the thunderously awful Noah.  There was only the slightest hint of the true accounts of either men, the films instead were made in and for the film makers image.

Both accounts of these faithful men of old are dramatic enough and full of rich texture, human frailty and faith and the faithfulness and love of God that they need NO embellishments, they are perfect as told. IMHO",1475798400,3,2052,4.743661971830986

6882160,1,B00QUFHWMS,"Maybe it was asking too much of Hollywood. I suppose my decision to give Hollywood one last chance to get it right was nave. But I purchased this movie hoping that someone as respected as Ridley Scott would at least TRY.

One would think that, prior to producing a multi-million dollar movie about the Exodus, the production team might actually READ Exodus. Its a dramatic enough story, evidenced by the wild and enduring success of DeMilles The Ten Commandments. Apparently, that was asking way too much.

This dog of a movie gets a lot of historical details right and yet, so much important stuff wrong. And the longer my wife & I watched it, the angrier we got. Finally, watching it became more of a game to see what ELSE this movie could possibly screw up.

From God repeatedly appearing to Moses in the form of a child (and I still have no idea what thats about) to Moses carving the Commandments himself, this movie is about as far as one can get from biblical fidelity. Biblically, Moses was not a skilled orator. He had a speech impediment, and Aaron did the talking for him on their multiple appearances before Pharaoh. But in this movie, Aaron has maybe two or three minor lines and never accompanies Moses. The plagues are explained away half-scientifically.

If we could get our money back because Exodus is a horrible and painfully inaccurate movie to watch, we would. Maybe I could reduce our loss on the movie by reselling it, but that exposes someone else to this manure, someone who perhaps may be more impressionable than us and might actually be inclined to believe it.

No, this was money squandered. All I can do at this point is warn you not to waste your money on it. I actually broke the disc in two and mailed it back to 20th Century Fox.

Bottom line: if you are at all interested in accuracy, stay away from this movie. Far away.",1469750400,2,1856,4.541916167664671

So the writing staff when to a local Goodwill and found a 5 year old level picture story book on the Exodus.  However the pages were loose and fell out and when the writers scooped them up they became shuffled a bit.  None of the writers ever learned how to read at a five year old level so they went to the director Ridley Scott and asked for help.  He looked at a few of the pictures and explained what he thought they meant.  That is how the scrip came about.

I must admit they did get a few facts correct, the main person in the story was Moses, there was somebody called Aaron, and the setting was Egypt.  The time was about 300 years off from the Bible dating but it was in the BC period at least.  And so on.  However, in no area did it come up to the level of the 1956 Cecil B.

Turns out that he and Alfred are really aliens and they're on a mission to eradicate socialism from the earth.

6882213,3,B00QUFHWMS,"It wasn't that Exodus God & Kings was that bad of a movie.

It is more that it could have been better.

The narrative did succeed in creating dramatic interpersonal tension between Moses and Pharaoh by emphasizing the intertwined family relationships of the two characters.

While the film strives to acknowledge in its own way the broad strokes of the Biblical saga, the producers could have done a better job of honoring and adhering to the specifics of the text.

For example, though Aaron is given a supporting role in the story, he tends to look on as Moses haggles with God.

The audience is left to wonder if deity is actually communicating with the prophet or merely a delusion initially induced by a cranial trauma.

Given that the director was Ridley Scott, for all we know the entity manifesting itself in the form of a young boy claiming to be God could have been related to the creatures from the Alien films and alluded to in Prometheus.

With special affects advanced as they are as evidenced in the scenes depicting the assorted plagues, it was a disappointment that there was not a scene depicting the encounter where Aaron's rod consumed the rods of the Egyptian magicians that turned into serpents.

But I guess it was more important to focus on extra-Biblical details like raids on Hittite encampments and characterizing Moses as some kind of guerrilla in the tradition of Che Guevara or Emilio Aguinaldo.

But the story didn't make any sense. None of the characters really felt completely fleshed out, including and most especially the main protagonist and antagonist.

They did have some interesting ideas that I think could have been really neat if they'd taken the time to develop them, but just overall, it was like someone kind of just threw together a script and ran with it without ever actually reading the thing.",1457568000,8,741,4.7

The unnecessary changes the movie made to some of the characters and events in the story that, while I see where they were going, is still better in the source material. One change I didn't like at first but then enjoyed as the movie went on was Moses' pessimistic and rationalistic view of the world. At first I wasn't convinced but they didn't make him an edgy ""I will never follow or believe in God!"" character. His transition from agnostic to a religious leader was believable and relate-able.

6882549,3,B00QUFHWMS,"Exodus: Gods and Kings is a two and a half hour long action movie set in ancient Egypt. It features Christian Bale as Moses, on a quest to free the Hebrew people from slavery. Directed by Ridley Scott, it is an adaptation of the book of Exodus, the second book in the Torah. It follows the story of Moses, who at first is prophecized to be a leader, is found to be Hebrew and is exiled to the desert. He discovers God on a mountain during his travels while he is in a village, and begins his quest to free the Hebrew people from slavery. One thing that stood out to me while I was watching this movie were the omissions that Scott made from the bible. In Exodus 3:4-21, Moses is having a conversation with God explaining his mission for Moses and how he should go and free the Hebrew people from slavery but the movie doesnt have this key dialogue in it. First off, in Exodus 3:3-4, Moses saw a burning bush and thought he should go over and see this strange sight. When he is close enough God called to him from within the bush. In the movie, this scene and the ensuing dialogue is cut out, instead it is paraphrased while he is talking to an angel of God, while occasionally glancing over at the burning bush. Exodus 3: 12-21 is all guidance to help Moses free the slaves, with directions like When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain, but in the movie the angel just insists that he become a general again, this time for the lord. Not only did dialogue and events not make it to the movie, but some key characters were also never introduced. Aaron is Moses brother, and is described as someone who can speak well (4:14). He is sent by God because Moses is not the most influential or charismatic speaker, being slow of speech and tongue and never been eloquent (4:10). He is a key part of the conversations Moses has with the Pharaoh when he returns to Egypt, but for some reason he is left out and Moses suddenly delivers dramatic one liners and fluent, convincing arguments. Lastly, we missed a lot of detail when it came to the plagues. In 7:20, it says Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into blood. We did not get any of this in the film, with a scene of Jews splattering lamb blood on their doors to the rivers being tainted red and fish turning up. A lot of the interactions that the Pharaoh had with Moses and Aaron were left out, and I thought this was weird because the movie ended up running for a long time anyway. Overall, I would give this movie a 3.5 out of 5 because while it is directed well and a good watch, many important parts were not included and the two and a half hours feel both repetitive and lacking of some of the more meaningful and informative parts of Exodus.",1449273600,,2884,4.283882783882784

6882551,2,B00QUFHWMS,"This movie had special effects.  The special effects were . . . special effects.  As for the rest of the movie, have any of those people even read Exodus?  This movie was VERY disappointing.  I would have actually stopped watching sometime after the first half hour, but my husband wanted to see what ""they"" would do with it next.  It was torturous to have to sit and watch it.  It was like getting a big bowl of ice cream and having your mouth all set for the creamy sweetness, only to take a big bite and find you are getting mashed potatoes.  Now, mashed potatoes are okay if you KNOW you are getting mashed potatoes, but they are most definitely not ice cream.  And this movie was most definitely not a true depiction of what happened when the Israelites left Egypt.

I have seen The Ten Commandments close to twenty times.  We watch it every year.  I never tire of it.  It is a beautiful telling of the Exodus story, and Mr. DeMille used many historical accounts as resources.  What a pity nobody on this movie thought to do that.  If they did, it was not at all obvious.  The Ten Commandments has well developed characters, exceptional acting, and brilliant directing.  It was and is a true masterpiece.  This movie is not worthy to sit on the same shelf as the DeMille movie.

Did I mention there were special effects?  There were - lots of them.  They were okay, as far as special effects go.  But special effects should enhance a story, not stand in lieu of one.  The mystic overtones were completely out of place and added nothing to the story, although the movie didn't add much to the story either.  If you didn't know the story before watching the movie, you didn't know any more once you finished.  Any ""story"" this movie attempted was at best disjointed and hard to follow.

I have watched movies that were ""based on"" stories or books but departed from them.  If the movie is a well-told story and the characters are well developed that is okay.  A movie is a movie and it does what it does.  But in this movie the characters were SO shallow.  I would have liked to see a little bit of character development.

I rated this two stars instead of one because they used real horses and the costumes were nice.  Oh, and they used special effects.  Not that I thought they were all that great, but they did have them.  In fact, the movie seems to be mainly a vehicle for special effects.  I was writhing in my chair when the end credits finally began to roll, and I couldn't get up fast enough.

6882593,5,B00QUFHWMS,"Being familiar with the Bible and knowing that the film would differ with the biblical story in a radical manner, I decided not to watch the film; but then I did. I enjoyed it and found it thought-provoking.
I was right that the film has many events in it that are not in the Bible, and some are even contrary to what the Bible states. Among the many: The Bible does not state that the Israelites slaves built Egyptian palaces and enhanced the countrys glory. Moses was not an Egyptian general who led Egyptian forces against Hyksos, a better general than the future Pharaoh (son of the present Pharaoh), and saved his life during the battle. The Egyptians did not call out praises to Moses when he returned from the battle and ignored the future Pharaoh. Moses had two sons, not just one. The number of Israelite slaves in the Torah was 600,000 males, not 400,000.  Nun was not mentioned in the Bible as the man who told Moses he was an Israelite. God did not appear several times to Moses looking like a boy. There is no indication in the Torah that the plague of blood in the Egyptian waters was the result of crocodiles attacking Egyptian ships and chewing the Egyptian sailors. The Torah does not state that the plagues were designed to destroy the Egyptians economy, especially its food supply, and cause the population to call on Pharaoh to release the slaves. Moses did not train and lead a force of fighters to fight Pharaohs army. Pharaoh did not order his people to seek out and kill Moses. The Egyptian population did not shout curses at the Israelites as they left Egypt, the Bible states the opposite; they even gave gifts to the departing nation.
I found the film version inspirational, as I will state more fully in a moment, I thought that Christian Bale was a better Moses than Charleston Hesston in the earlier film version. He was more human. I liked many comments in the film; for example, when Moses told the Israelites to put lamb blood on their door posts and the Israelites asked him, will it help, Moses responded: If I am right, we will bless the lambs for eternity.
What I am about to say will bother some readers but it is worth thinking about. While the film version of the exodus is different than the Torah version, it may be true or at least a fair explanation of the biblical tale. The Torah itself frequently gives more than one version of a story. For example, there are two versions of the Ten Commandments, one in Exodus 20 and one in Deuteronomy 5. One version saying the son who tried to save Joseph from being killed by his brothers was Reuben, the other Judah. One says Joseph was sold to Ishmaelites, the other to Midianites. There are two different accounts (minor differences) between what occurred when Abraham sent his servant to acquire a wife for his son Isaac between the narrative and how the servant described it. There are more than a few times that the Bible tells a story which is followed by a song (such as the tale of the drowning of Egyptians at the Red Sea and Joshuas victory at Jericho), and in each instance the details in the song differ with the narrative account (for example, it is only in the song that the sun stood still). Is it possible that the story of the flood is a version of the Gilgamesh tale which was composed before the time of Moses?",1447545600,3,3315,4.497512437810945

Then my disappointment became anger as I watched this ""Alien"" version evolve.  By the time it reached the ""plagues"", which were jumbled together and not in order, it was obvious that Moses, Aaron and his very important Staff were missing in action and Ridley Scott had no intention of following the Bible. The significance of the plagues was totally ignored; no pillar of smoke by day or pillar of fire by night leading the Hebrews; some weird meteor, tornado or who knows ""what"" causing the red sea level to drop and then return as a tsunami wave; Moses riding in a covered wagon using the Ark of the Covenant as a back rest; and last but not least Moses himself (not the finger of GOD) engraving the Ten Commandments by candlelight.  An ugly, inaccurate and blasphemous rendering of the Biblical story of Moses told from a secular standpoint.

6882620,1,B00QUFHWMS,"LOL no, no, no. (so sorry if this review has what could be termed as spoilers)
There has never been a Biblical movie so far from scripturally-correct (except maybe for Russel Crowe's Noah).
This was absolute hogwash. As mentioned several times in these reviews, the portrayal of God as a child is nothing short of blasphemous. There was at NO time any passion from Moses for his people, absolutely no effort to plead with Pharaoh for their freedom. Never, at any time, any chemistry between any of the characters...except when Moses loses it and yells at God like a spoilt brat.
How he finds out he is Hebrew? Ummm, I must have dropped off during that bit!
The parting of the sea? Ok...that was interesting, but I didn't realise Moses almost drowned in that event (??)...while he stupidly stands there waiting to have last words with Rameses.
As for the tablets...Scripture tells us they were ""written by the Hand of God""...here we have Moses sitting scratching them out with a rock while the kid makes idle smalltalk.
And suddenly...boom! The movie is done.
What?
A total waste of time. A great disappointment. In this day and age, they could've done a lot better...even the CGI / special effects were weak and half-hearted...why did they bother to make this movie?
Yes, they have tried to explain the wonder and miracles of the plagues away with (modern day) science. (is this the History Channel?)
So glad I didn't waste money on the movie theatre, or on the DVD...so very glad I waited for it to show on TV first. Deleted it before the credits started to roll!
Really, if you love this tale, buy the Charlton Heston version. That is worth every minute of its 4 hours.

6882622,2,B00QUFHWMS,"This remake of The Ten Commandments follows the Cecil B. DeMille manual in that it presents Moses, raised as a prince of Egypt, in competition with Rameses II, the legitimate heir to the Egyptian throne. Once Moses discovers that he is actually the son of Hebrew slaves, the sibling rivalry goes off the charts, as it did in the two DeMille versions. Although visually stunning and well-paced, some of the dialogue is execrable. The poorest written scene is the one in which Moses and Rameses reunite after nine years. Considering the millions spent on this epic, I can't help but wonder why a writing team of four or five people didn't include at least one person who understands correct English pronoun usage. Also, unlike the DeMille version, Yahweh appears to Moses as a young child or a deus ex machina who solves problems with appropriate plagues. Also, unlike the DeMille version, the Ten Commandments are presented as an afterthought with little fanfare.  Ditto for the 40 years in the dessert. Also, no sign of the Golden Calf. Moses simply ages overnight. Another omission is that women play a very secondary role to what is basically a sibling conflict and power struggle.  I much prefer the 1956 version with all its camp, over-the-top fun, and Anne Baxter as the scorned Nefertiri to fuel all the fireworks.",1446249600,,1320,4.862222222222222

6882645,4,B00QUFHWMS,"""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" by Ridley Scott is certainly a dramatic and entertaining re-envisaging of the story of Moses, and Christian Bale does a reasonable job playing Moses as a man of action  - a prince and general turned rebel leader rather than an elderly patriarch. If you want to watch a modern Hollywood version of the Book of Exodus, purely for entertainment value, you will probably like this.

The action is well paced and exciting, the visual depiction of the magnificence of ancient Egypt is sumptuous. The battle and action scenes are well drawn - the depiction of the battle of Kadesh in particular - and the special effects are magnificent. Most of the acting is very good though one or two of the accents used were surprising: for example the High Priestess of Egypt has a cut glass English accent (she's played by Indira Varma, who is English) and a character who appears in the cast list as ""expert"" (Ewen Bremner) has a Scottish one. And far too many characters in the story were given blatantly 21st century attitudes - for example the Scottish ""expert"" produces a very secular explanation for the plagues, which is very close to what some modern scientists who think this section of the bible might be based on a real event have theorised.

If you were hoping to see either a film which reflects the viewpoint of a religious believer or that of of someone who is interested in a rationalist view of what might have actually happened with minimal supernatural involvement, you may feel that this film falls between those two stools. I also felt that the film was cut down a bit too much, apparently to fit into an arbitrary time limit, and some of the ""deleted scenes"" on the disc would have been better left in. If there is a slightly longer ""director's cut"" released in the future it may work better.

My biggest problem with the film is something which may be very much a personal and minority view but here goes. It's the fact that ""Exodus: God's and Kings"" takes the traditional view that the Pharaoh of the exodus was Ramses or Ramesses II, known as Ramesses the Great, and that the Hebrews escaped from Egypt in the 13th century BC. The date when the film starts is given as 1300 BC.

I see why that view might make sense to the ""Copenhagen School"" of biblical minimalist historians who regard the Torah (the Old Testament of the Bible) as a collection of nationalistically-slanted legends assembled between 100 BC and 500 BC and of which the earlier books are of little value as historical source documents. I can also see why someone who was only interesting in making a dramatic film of the Book of Exodus might want to pit Moses against Ramesses the Great who was possibly the most powerful ruler in the entire history of ancient Egypt.

However, this film appears to be an attempt to tell a story like the one in the bible in a way which makes at least some attempt to link in with real Egyptian history. And if you do think that something like the disasters which struck Egypt in the book of Exodus actually had a basis in history, then that was not the most plausible century to set this story.

It is less likely that such a catastrophic series of events would have occurred during the long, successful, and comparatively well documented reign of Ramesses II (1279-1213 BC) yet without any mention in surviving Egyptian records of that reign, than that it could have happened in one of the less stable periods of Egyptian history from which far fewer records have survived. This is particularly true because some of the few records which did survive from some of those earlier centuries  actually do suggest cataclysmic events which might match the biblical account.

Those reputable historians and archaeologists who think there might be a historical basis for the Ten Plagues - and although they are not currently in the majority, there are some - usually place that sequence of events between two and four centuries prior to the reign of Ramesses the Great, perhaps during the Second Intermediate Period of Egyptian history. For example it is known that the massive volcanic eruption which destroyed the island of Santorini, (also known as the Thera event) caused massive environmental disruption over a huge area of the planet, and could well have sparked off a series of ecological catastrophes in Egypt similar to the biblical description of the plagues. There is much debate about exactly when that eruption occurred, with archaeological, carbon dating, and tree ring evidence suggesting different dates but it was probably between about 1628 BC and 1500 BC  with the earlier date, which comes from tree ring data, currently regarded as the most likely.

Some historians such as David Rohl, author of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Test-Of-Time-Volume-One-The-Bible-From-Myth-to-History/dp/0099416565/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Test Of Time: Volume One-The Bible-From Myth to History</a>"" have argued that it would be more plausible to identify the Pharaoh of the Exodus with a ruler some centuries prior to Ramesses II, such as Tutimaos, of whom the ancient Egyptian chronicler Manetho was to write centuries later, ""In his reign, for what cause I know not, a blast of God smote us.""

To be fair, most historians do not agree. Some of them think the entire story of the Exodus is complete fiction and literally never happened at all, others think that a small group of slaves, too insignificant to be worth recording in Egyptian records, may have escaped from Egypt at around the time of the reign of Ramesses the Great, become part of the group of tribes who were to become the Hebrews, and given rise to the Exodus legend. Both these groups of historians think the early books of the Old Testament are a collection of myths assembled as Hebrew religious and nationalist propaganda a thousand years after the events they purport to describe, are completely unreliable, and in the words of one professor, any attempt to integrate the events of the bible into a historical narrative is, in the words of one Professor ""not only dubious but wholly ludicrous.""

I don't have the expert knowledge to argue that this view is wrong, but there's no point whatsoever in making a film like ""Exodus: God's and Kings"" conform to it, because if it is right you have absolutely nothing to make such a film about!

If you ARE going to make a film like this, and you're also going to make any attempt to integrate it into real Egyptian history, you might as well make it match the arguments of the current minority view among the experts who do think something like the events of ""Exodus"" (the bible book and this film) could really have happened. In which case you should probably set it before the reign of Ramesses the Great.

A few more points on the actual history. Many aspects of this are quite good, but others are open to challenge.

The caption at the start of the film gives the time and place as 1300BC in Memphis, capital of Egypt, but it begins during the reign of Seti the first. There is debate about exactly when Set I came to the throne, but it was probably a few years after 1300 BC. The main capital of Egypt in 1300BC was at Thebes. However, Seti I, the Pharaoh in the early part of the film, did reign mainly from Memphis. His son Ramesses II who is Pharaoh for most of the film built a new capital at Pi-Ramesses in the Nile Delta.

The depiction of the battle of Kadesh is quite good and reasonably historically accurate except that it conflates two campaigns. In real history, the city of Kadesh was captured by the Egyptians from the Hittites in the reign of Seti I, and the future Ramses the Great, who was then crown prince, was present during that campaign. A few years later, four years after Ramesses II had become Pharaoh in his own right, there was another military action at Kadesh which was the largest chariot battle in known history and in which, at one point, Ramesses nearly got cut off from most of his army and killed.

In the film, the battle of Kadesh takes place during the earlier campaign while Seti I is still Pharaoh and Ramesses still crown prince, but apart from this and from the fact that a role has been found for Moses, it takes place in the film very much as it did in real history. There is a subsequent scene when the wording of the official record of the battle to be carved onto monuments is being agreed, and in which Ramesses says that he was cut off from his troops and saved by divine intervention. The scriptwriters took the trouble to get this exactly right and the wording agreed in the film is word for word identical to the most common translation of that account as it survives on real monuments of the battle.

After seeing lots of films in which Morgan Freeman plays the part of God, the manner in which this film treats Him is very different. I'm not going to describe it to avoid a spoiler, but it was at least original.

One change from the biblical story which is perhaps representative of the way Moses is presented in this film is that he is given a sword at the beginning. The various actions which Moses or his brother Aaron carry out with their staffs in the bible are carried out with Moses's sword in this film.

Overall this film has a lot of strengths if you are looking for entertainment, though I can't help thinking that if you are looking for accuracy or plausibility it could and should have been better. As with Darren Aronofsky's recent film version of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Noah-DVD/dp/B00IZEASO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Noah [DVD</a>],"" Ridley Scott was depicting a story from the bible and had to decide whether to present it as an openly supernatural series of events or try to show how the events of the story could have happened in a natural manner. ""Noah"" went for the former route and was a better film for not trying to sit on the fence. ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" seems a little uncomfortable with aspects of the bible story but unwilling to completely abandon them, and in consequence is not quite as convincing.",1445299200,,10135,4.763532763532764

6882677,1,B00QUFHWMS,"Note: I saw this film in 3-D & in HD via XFinity On Demand.

This two-and-a-half-hour 'epic' retelling of The Second Booke Of Moses Called Exodus feels more like a lengthy temper tantrum by an atheist director who is hell-bent on shoving his ignorance down moviegoers' throats. Of course, those of us who are Christians know that everything in this motion picture is an absolute falsehood. It is not even historically accurate. The only minor thing it got right was that Moses was a general in the Egyptian army...BEFORE he slew the Egyptian and fled unto Midian. However, the events that were depicted even there most likely never happened. In Book II Section X Of Antiquities Of The Jews, the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (c. 37 A.D.-100 A.D.) saith that Moses was a general in the Egyptian army and laid siege to the city of Saba (an event mentioned in Cecil B. DeMille's epic 1956 partial remake of his own film The Ten Commandments). The depiction of God as a child is blasphemous and highly offensive.

The acting is wooden, even from Academy Award winner Sir Ben Kingsley and Sigourney Weaver, both of whom are thoroughly wasted in this bore-fest of a production. Academy Award winner Christian Bale seemed the most bored here, as can be inferred from his highly inflammatory comments about Moses, calling him the most barbaric and schizophrenic individual he'd ever read about. In my opinion. Charlton Heston is the definitive screen Moses and Yul Brynner the definitive Ramses II; Bale and Edgerton pale in comparison. There are a few good wide shots of 'Egypt,' which were most likely computer-generated anyway, like the Coliseum in Gladiator. However, that one sentence is all the good I can say about this blasphemous piece of celluloid.

Read The Second Booke Of Moses Called Exodus and see both the 1923 & 1956 versions of The Ten Commandments (the latter being the definitive screen version, in my opinion) and The Prince Of Egypt (a faithful, animated version of the Biblical story). See this version ONCE, if you must just to compare it to the Bible, and the aforementioned film versions, and then eschue it like the plague.

""god"" is portrayed like a young buddhist monk. A little boy dressed in monk garb. There is ""no take off your shoes, this is holy ground""...oh, no. Moses is caught in a rock slide and up to his face, literally in mud, as the little kid talks to him like a petulant child. (No, I'm not kidding). Moses had no staff. Aaron didn't come to meet him. Zaporah never saved them from dying by doing what God commanded when Moses didn't. The ""plagues"" started when Alligators flooded into the nile and ate some fishermen and then all the fish. From there the frogs escaped from the water and when they died the flies were the result. Moses never stood before his brother and testify of God and God's doings. The staff never turned into a snake, etc. And at the splitting of the Red Sea, Good Lord!, the tide just went down, they didn't cross on dry land and as the waters started to come back, both moses and his brother are standing in the middle of the sea and a 50' tidal wave hits them both and, even though the same wave killed Pharaoh's army, they both survived and went their separate ways.

6882706,3,B00QUFHWMS,"The Mosaic biblical epic as directed and storied by Ridley Scott has been much maligned, and not just by Christians who have taken issue with the portrayal of Moses as a seeming psychotic who hears and sees God (in the form of a young boy) and is rather tormented by his encounters though he does manage despite all of this to lead the Hebrew people out from underneath the oppression of the Egyptians, but also by the secular left who have criticized the portrayals of the on-screen ethnicities by a bunch of white actors.  Depending on where you fall on either of those issues this movie may not be for you.  But if you don't care and want to be entertained, well, then this movie also may not be for you.  Christian Bales performance as an aging psychotic Moses who is frequently in anguish leaves a little to be desired from such a well-respected and intense actor.  Joel Edgerton plays Ramses, king of Egypt, wearing doubt on his sleeve.  His depiction of the put-upon king is not fiery nor fierce.  And their brotherly rivalry comes across feeling clichd at best.  So for a long movie such as this with all of their screen time?  The result is a bit boring and your attentions will likely start drifting off toward other pursuits and wanderings.  For many the two big reasons to see this will be for the special effect moments of the plagues sent by God that the Egyptians suffer and the parting of the Red Sea.  The effects are fine, especially with the plagues (Scott is said to have done his research on how these could have been naturally occurring events versus supernaturally inspired and directed events and to have shown this on screen but while there is some moments of explanation they do not come close to satisfying the account in either their intensities or timelines), but less so with the parting of the sea and the waves crashing down on a vengeance crazed chariot driven Ramses (who survives no less! in truly unexplained miraculous fashion).  For people hungry for the spfx money shots theres a lot of movie to get through and I cant help but think that they, too, will end up disappointed.  For me this movie is closest to its okay by way of Amazons rating but for its flaws it at least heads into the 2.75 category.

Moses did not part the red sea, but they walked across it.. even waded in some places. The point of this miracle was that God, through Moses, parted the Red sea and they walked through on dry ground! Moses had a staff of which he used for many of the miracles, and that was never shown or mentioned..

Christian Bale brings the heart and soul of what Moses may have gone through from realizing he is not who he was raised to be, and had a mission that was beyond his scope.  I had to look beyond a few actors not being of the right ethnicity for that region, but I still feel they were spot on bringing the emotion needed for the parts and bringing history from the Bible and the Torah to life.",1440633600,,654,4.133858267716535

Exodus: Gods and Kings!
On the mountain you ever climbed.
You met the Lord there.
In a dream you spoke with him.
Hurry to Egypt you hurry, you're our people released.
The path will be there at all is not easy.
And many days and stops.
And Pharaoh then murmured.
The people did not let go.
And the way to the end of blocking.
But you will Bozheyu.
Brought to you homeland path.
And miraculously crossed the sea.
Moses and Joshua.
As you joined the Lord.
Joshua was an important military leader.
And the brave warrior.
You covered the retreat.
And the cavalry created.
Strategy knew.
In battle, he taught and helped.

6882886,2,B00QUFHWMS,"It is a mega flop from a historical and religious POV. It is also a mega success in CGI (computer graphic imagery). I don't know if the director decided to do a ""reality"" version of Exodus, and in so doing,  bursting the bubble of millions of devout believers , or he was carried away by some bold art inspiration?
My observations follow:

- Depicting God as an angry child. What were you thinking?

- Moses character was rather rude and pushy, even with God and the people around him

- Moses had a speech impediment (stutter) and asked God to send his brother AARON with him,  not addressed in the movie

- Ramses II, allegedly the Exodus Pharaoh died 90 years old. Did we see a 90 yo Pharaoh riding a chariot? same goes for Moses as they both were almost the same age.

- The depiction of the plague was a master piece

- In the bible, God hardens the heart of Pharaoh on Moses people. Why? to punish all the population of a whole country because their leader hates Hebrews? Wasnt easier to soften his heart and call it quits?

- Execution by hanging was not a known method for capital punishment in ancient Egypt

- The movie shows Egypt as Ramses and his royalties AND Hebrews, where are the darn Egyptians?

- Egypt population was estimated to be 3 million inhabitants. Add to that the Hebrews were 600,000 as per the bible.  Where is the rest of the population? All what the movie showed was guys wearing filthy rags dragging boulders all day long!

- Ramses II refused Moses request based on economic grounds, History does not show the impact of displacing ALL the workforce overnight on the economy of Egypt.

- Ramses did not die? The bible says otherwise in both Exodus ""not so much as one of them remained."" and in Psalms as well.

- The staff was replaced by a sword!  We can live with that I guess.

I can go on and on, but I guess the whole story makes sense under the auspices of Pope Francis whose idea about Adam & Eve story goes towards being a fable, following are his words verbatim:

 Like the fable of Adam and Eve, we see hell as a literary device. Hell is merely a metaphor for the isolated soul, which like all souls ultimately will be united in love with God.

But I was pleasantly surprised to see the master Ridley Scott use his directorial skills to weave a wonderful tale of fantasy and spectacular visual special effects.

6882971,1,B00QUFHWMS,"This movie is an absolute abomination!  Not only does it utterly mutilate the details of the biblical record (which can be expected of movie makers exercising their self-assumed right to ""creative license""), it stretches further to unnecessary lengths in order to insult the character and integrity of Moses and--as if that were not enough--it goes out of its way to blaspheme the God of the Hebrews in the most asinine way, portraying Him in His appearances to Moses as a petulant 10-year-old boy!  One wonders if even someone like Mel Brooks could have (or would have) perpetrated such a contemptible absurdity.

Whether or not you approve of the perspective of many scholars who assume a critical (and skeptical) interpretation of the biblical record of the Exodus, this movie leaves the unavoidable impression that its agenda was to present the most extreme mockery and the grossest caricature of the persons and events of this story as it was recorded in the Bible.  It could not have acheived this slanderous effect more successfully if it had been written, produced, and directed by the devil himself.

The next time you consider wasting good money and valuable time watching a ""Hollywood"" portrayel of Biblical events, you might want to ask yourself--just who is it that has the greatest vested interest in slandering, mocking, and defaming the God of the Bible, and why do you suppose this being, of all persons, seems to receive the most dedicated, loyal,  and unswerving allegience from the Hollywood establishment?

The personification of Yahweh was ludicrous, inconsistent and a confused image of Moses' God, a personage either psychotic or childishly unpredictable.  I am not a Christian, but I know the biblical record, and this movie makes a complete mishmash of the story.  Did Moses really need a love interest?

It eludes me why the screenwriter thought they could improve on a story that has lasted four thousand years, but in my opinion, they were mistaken. The deviations from scripture made no rational or qualitative sense.  Where did the ""gods and kings"" come in? I must have missed it. If you have any sense of endearment toward the deep and timeless lessons found within the ancient account, don't expect any of that substance, here. The story-line was pointless, other than to insult people of faith.

Directed by Ridley Scott. Written by Adam Cooper, Bill Collage, Jeffrey Caine, Steven Zaillian.

Assuming everyone has seen the epic movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ten-Commandments-Three-Disc-50th-Anniversary-Collection/dp/B000CNESNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ten Commandments (Three-Disc 50th Anniversary Collection)</a>&nbsp;(1956), this movie begins with Moses (Christian Bale) as a grown man having been found as a baby and raised by Bithia (Hiam Abbass) and the Pharaoh Seti's family. Him and Ramesses II (Joel Edgerton) are ""cousins"". Moses meets a man, Nun (Ben Kingsley), who tells him the truth of his birth, whom his real mother and sister is, who he is and the prophecy. Pharaoh Seti (John Turturro) dies and Ramesses II becomes king. Now Moses is Ramesses' chief advisor.
  One day, when Miriam (Tara Fitzgerald) visits the palace, Ramesses questions her if she is Moses sister. She lies to him and says ""No"". Ramesses in anger of her lie attempts to quickly cut off Miriam's arm, but Moses quickly stops that from happening and yells, ""Yes!"". This begins the conflict between Ramses and Moses since they are not blood at all.  Ramesses' mother, Tuya (Sigourney Weaver), orders Moses killed.
  Moses leaves Egypt and becomes a changed man when he sees the ""burning"" bush and a boy, Malek (Isaac Andrews), a messenger from God.

Also in the cast: Aaron Paul, Ben Mendelsohn, Anna Sawa, Sigourney Weaver, Maria Valverde, Golshifteh Farahani, David Olawale Ayinde.

6883053,3,B00QUFHWMS,"The sets, costumes, and effects were all great.  Somehow, the story didn't really ""do it"" for me.  I'm not saying that every Biblical movie has to stick precisely with the scriptures; having said that, I don't think this movie pulled off a good ""possible rendition.""  Glad I watched it. Not sure I need to see it again.",1437264000,,319,4.56140350877193
6883054,3,B00QUFHWMS,It was ok. Very little character development. Long movie not to have started at Moses's birth. Plagues were presented from a more scientific perspective rather than coming from the hand of God.,1437264000,,193,5.0625
6883055,2,B00QUFHWMS,Story line has just been done to much. This movie took it in some really obscure directions just to try to keep it interesting. Too much deviation from core story as I know it to be great for me.,1437177600,,195,4.0256410256410255
6883056,4,B00QUFHWMS,"EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS IS A GREAT, ENTERTAINING, AND VISUALLY STUNNING FICTIONALIZED STORY LOOSELY BASED ON CHARACTERS OF THE BIBLE BOOK OF EXODUS. MY MOST RECOMMENDED EXODUS MOVIE IS DEMILLE'S 10 COMMANDMENTS, WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY EXTENSIVELY RESEARCHED TO PRESENT THE MOST ACCURATE VERSION OF THE STORY EVER. YOU MUST READ THE BIBLE SO YOU CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FACT AND POETIC LICENSE, WHICH ALL BIBLICAL MOVIES HAVE TO ENGAGE IN.
EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS OPENS LIKE DEMILLE'S 10 COMMANDMENTS WITH MOSES AS PRINCE OF EGYPT, THE BIBLE ONLY ALLUDES TO THE PRINCE OF EGYPT YEARS FOR BACKGROUND INFORMATION, SO THE WRITERS ARE QUITE FREE TO WRITE WHATEVER THEY WANT FOR THIS BACKSTORY. IT CONTINUES A HOLLYWOOD TRADITION OF ASSUMING RAMSES IS THE PHARAOH OF EXODUS.  THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE ASSUMPTION OF ALL OF THE WRITERS OF SOLOMON SCREENPLAYS THAT THE QUEEN OF SHEBA IS THE SONG OF SONGS LOVE OF SOLOMON'S LIFE. EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS STUNNING SPECIAL EFFECTS OF THE VALLEY OF THE KINGS AND ALL THE WONDERS OF EGYPT AS BRAND NEW, IS THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN IN FILM HISTORY AND HELPS TO CONFIRM MY THEORY THAT THE HEBREWS BUILT THESE WONDERS!
THE WRITING DELIBERATELY LEAVES OUT THE SCENES OF OTHER EXODUS SCREENPLAYS SUCH AS THE KILLING OF THE SLAVER AND MOSES'S REPEATED AUDIENCES WITH PHARAOH BETWEEN THE PLAGUES TO ""LET MY PEOPLE GO!""  IT SEEMS TO LEAVE OUT ALL KNOWN MOSES QUOTES, EVEN GIVING HIM A DIFFERENT PERSONALITY THAN THE BIBLE SHOWS. MOSES WAS SLOW OF SPEECH AND WAS RELUCTANT BEFORE GOD TO BE THE LEADER OF HIS PEOPLE BUT WOULD NOT HAVE LACKED FAITH LIKE THIS MOVIE SHOWS AT THE TIME OF THE PASSOVER MIRACLE.
THE WRITER DOESN'T SHOW THE EGYPTIAN'S THAT ARE GIFTED IN DARK POWERS TRYING TO DUPLICATE GOD'S MIRACLES, BUT RATHER HAS THEM EXPLAIN THE PLAGUES USING A MODERN SCIENTIFIC THEORY, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FILM HISTORY SHOWS THAT THEY AND LATER THE UNREPENTANT PHARAOH ARE PUNISHED BY DEATH, THE APPROPRIATE END OF ALL WHO TRY TO ELEVATE THEMSELVES TO THE LEVEL OF GOD. ANOTHER MODERN THEORY IS DISPLAYED IN THIS MOVIE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FILM HISTORY: STRONG CYCLONIC WINDS CAUSE THE PARTING OF THE RED SEA. ALTHOUGH THIS IS THE MOST SPECTACULAR RED SEA PARTING EFFECT I'VE EVER SEEN, DEMILLE'S BUNCHING UP OF THE WATER ON EACH SIDE OF THE CROSSING ISRAELITES IS MY BELIEF OF WHAT HAPPENED. GOD ALSO PARTED THE JORDAN RIVER MORE THAN ONCE FOR THEM. THE BIBLE SAYS THEY WALKED ACROSS ON DRY LAND, SO SHOWING THEM IN THE WATER AS HIGH AS THEIR CHESTS DID NOT HAPPEN. AND DON'T FORGET THAT GOD IS NOT SUBJECT TO HIS LAWS OF PHYSICS. JESUS WALKED ON WATER!
THE FILM OPENS WITH THE TERRIBLE WORD BCE, WHICH MEANS BEFORE THE COMMON ERA RATHER THAN BC (BEFORE CHRIST).  BCE IS AN EXAMPLE OF MODERN MAN REMOVING GOD FROM OUR COUNTRY, RESULTING IN HIS WITHDRAWAL OF HIS BLESSINGS AND PROTECTIONS. AS WICKEDNESS INCREASES SO WILL PLAGUES AND THEN THE FULL DESTRUCTION OF A ANTICHRIST COUNTRY!  FINALLY, IN DISCUSSION OF THE FILM'S HANDLING OF GOD HIMSELF, THE BOY REMINDS ME OF CHRIST BUT IS MISHANDLED BY HIS NOT BEING AS LOVING AS CHRIST WOULD BE AND BY MAKING MOSES APPEAR TO BE NUTS, AS HE WAS WITNESSED TALKING TO NO ONE.
""THE LORD BROUGHT ME FORTH AS THE FIRST OF HIS WORKS, BEFORE HIS DEEDS OF OLD; I WAS APPOINTED FROM ETERNITY, FROM THE BEGINNING BEFORE THE WORLD BEGAN...I WAS FILLED WITH DELIGHT DAY AFTER DAY, REJOICING IN HIS WHOLE WORLD AND DELIGHTING IN MANKIND.  NOW THEN, MY SONS, LISTEN TO ME; BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO KEEP MY WAYS...FOR WHOEVER FINDS ME FINDS LIFE AND RECEIVES FAVOR FROM THE LORD. BUT WHOEVER FAILS TO FIND ME HARMS HIMSELF; ALL WHO HATE ME LOVE DEATH""

6883060,2,B00QUFHWMS,"I chose to give this two stars due to the great cast, graphics, and costumes. Otherwise, this movie should only be viewed from an 'entertaining' standpoint rather than an actual religious standpoint. Its a typical hollywood movie. As a person of religious faith, this movie left out many things from the Torah. Such as the fact that:
- Moses had a speech impediment and his brother, Aaron, was the one who always spoke to Pharaoh and the Jewish people. When Moses first spoke with G-d, G-d gave him the stick (which turned into a snake) and Moses would lose his speech impediment when G-d was with him.
- G-d said the first two commandments, at Mount Sinai, to the whole nation. Once the Israelites couldn't handle G-d's voice, the nation asked Moses to speak to G-d for them. Moses went up and then got THE REST of the commandments.",1437091200,,833,4.597315436241611

6883126,1,B00QUFHWMS,"I am a Christian and although I had heard poor reviews of this movie on Christian sites, I decided to watch it.  I am deeply saddened when I see Hollywood base a movie on a Biblical story and not honor the scriptural account.  Exodus: Gods and Kings is definitely offends in this way.  Each theophany (appearance of God) in the Exodus account is either absent or poorly represented in this movie.  (Spoiler Alert) ... There was no landslide at the burning bush and God did not appear as a child.  God spoke clearly to Moses instructing him to remove his sandals because he was standing on Holy Ground.  God then instructed Moses to return to Egypt and demand that Pharoah let His people go.  Moses was reluctant saying that He was ""slow of speech.""  God demonstrated His power to Moses by turning his rod to a snake and back to its original form and by causing his hand to become leprous and then restoring it.  Moses asked God's name and God said, ""I AM WHO I AM"" - This encounter was completely absent in the movie.  In the movie, Moses' sword (an implement of war) seemed to replace his staff (biblical - the implement of a shepherd - very significant identity in the Bible).  I was stunned by the portion of the movie where Moses led the Israelites in a revolt and it was the killing of egyptians that caused the Nile to run red with blood!  This could not have been more offensive to the Biblical account!  There was no war, no revolt!!!  The Egyptians experienced wrath from God alone for the 400 years they had enslaved the Israelites!  The movie completely ignored Moses' repeated visits to Pharoah to demand that the Israelites be released.  As my husband and I watched the movie, I became less interested in the fantasy that was this story and more of a critic looking for the next offense against the truth of the Biblical account!  The institution of the Passover was very poorly represented in the movie.  The people were not cowering in fear, they shared a meal, ready to leave Egypt because their release was eminent.  Once the Israelites left and the Egyptians pursued, blocking them with the Red Sea ahead of them and the Egyptians behind them, the movie completely failed to show the theophany of God!  It was at this point that God appeared in a pillar (of fire by night and cloud by day) between the Egyptians and the Israelites, protecting His people.  Further, the movie implied that it was Moses' casting his sword into the sea which somehow caused it to divide - something that was fully a miracle from the hand of God!  Once the crossing was complete, the account of God delivering the Ten Commandments to the people, and their disobedience in casting the golden calf to worship while Moses was on the mountain with God is completely absent!  It is notable here too that Moses' brother Aaron and his sister, Miriam are absent from their roles which are significant in scripture.  Joshua is present, but not accurately depicted.  The end of the movie made me say ""you have got to be kidding me!!!""  Moses is seen, an old man, riding in the back of a cart, with a box, obviously meant to be carrying the Ten Commandment stones.  Biblically, the Ten Commandments were stored in the Ark of the Covenant which was adorned in gold and hooks on the sides which held large poles.  These poles allowed the Ark to be carried by the priests.  This was the only manner by which the Ark was permitted to be transported.  Much later, when King David wanted to bring the Ark to Jerusalem, he made the error of transporting it in a cart.  This angered God as the Ark was not handled according to his commands.  Exodus: Gods and Kings is fantasy!  Sadly, people who are not biblically knowledgeable would watch this movie and assume it tells an accurate story of Biblical account.  It does not!",1436400000,3,3802,4.55081001472754

6883175,4,B00QUFHWMS,"Sometimes it's better to make a movie with unknown actors because at least in the case of Christian Bale it may be difficult to separate the person from the character he or she is portraying which in this case was my problem. When he can lose himself in the character such as Batman in the Terminor films he is very good. Here I think he was miscast. Some of the reviews were interesting mainly because many view the Bible as true source material which is somewhat questionable, after all unlike modern books, fiction or otherwise the source material in this case is not really verifiable, most if not all being hearsay so I don't have a problem with artistic license. I would imagine there is a case to be made for Moses carving the ten commandments himself rather than a divine  deity. There was after all a need, according to scriptures,  to bring what had reportedly become an unruly mob under control.  In fact much of what is in the scriptures is about control overt or inferred.

The problem is that they diverged too far from the text and minimized the miracles of God.  The little boy as God, also minimized the Holiness and basic Character of God.  While I'm sure Moses struggled with the task that was presented to him, I'm not sure the Biblical text conveys the total irreverence that Christian Bale's character portrayed.
I just hope another big budget opportunity will come along and someone will return to the Biblical text.  While it is dated, at least Charlton Heston's version was more accurate.",1435622400,,657,4.637931034482759

Granted, it is a 2  hour movie and you could read the book of Exodus a few times in that time span so some literary license was expected. But come on! Moses as a young rebel leader never happened. God, played by a little boy, never tells Moses to sit back and watch what happens. And the sea never turns red with blood because alligators attacked sail boats full of people. We turned it off after we saw Moses yelling at God..again.  I told my husband I was done and my 15 year old asked Do I have to keep watching this? To her relief, I said no.

Moses becomes a underground rebel leader rather than an  agent of God, he's training Jewish freedom fighters, archery horseback, under the noses of the Egyptians (yea right). Too far off from the framework of the Bible even when we  were expecting fictionalized details and side stories, closer to history on the main events would have been tolerable.

But don't tout it as a retelling of a much-beloved story that actually, you know, has a point. If you don't have the guts to tell the story with all it's troublesome bits.

As others have said, visual were great; acting, not bad; music, adequate. The problem with this movie is they sanitized it until none of the characters were inspiring, relatable, or even likable. This was basically Snowpiercer, but in the desert. Same emotional void, same derring-do without purpose and little explanation. Lots of death and mayhem but no actual drive behind it. And that's what was lost when they removed the strong spiritual element from the story, the drive. Why did Moses go back to Egypt? He said over and over he didn't believe the story about his birth, did not consider himself Hebrew. There were no scenes to illustrate he had changed his mind or felt differently after exile. And the first interaction between him and ""God"" was confusing and weak. If you're going to take on the most powerful nation in the world (at the time) you're going to need pretty strong motivation and drive to keep you from wetting your pants and running home. When the pharaoh starts murdering families wholesale to force information, what keeps people's mouths shut? Nothing in this movie as far as I could see served as a source of unity and inspiration to the Hebrews or Moses. Which made the entire story unbelievable.

And what the heck was the burning bush FOR if God didn't even use it. It was just there in the background. And pretty poor CGI by today's standards at that.",1435276800,,1816,4.6191950464396285

6883227,4,B00QUFHWMS,"THE FILM: Ridley Scott could do epic films in his sleep, and his sense of scale in storytelling has few equals these days. However, EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS is definitely one of his lesser efforts. To begin with, it was a fool's errand to try and remake Cecil B. DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. Secondly, a lot of choices he makes in the details of the story will not go over well with the a large part of the target audience. By now, the story of Moses leading the Hebrews out of Egypt is ubiquitous in literature and legend. Ask anyone and they'll probably be able to tell you part of it, if not the whole thing. So, the onus was on Ridley Scott to do something new and innovative to justify this new cinematic interpretation, and what the writers came up with is good and bad, in about equal measure. One major change which will certainly turn off Evangelicals is jettisoning the supernatural aspects of the story entirely, opting to ground it in history and reality as much as possible. So, the 10 Plagues and the parting of the Red Sea are straightforward natural disasters/occurrences. Then there's the portrayal of God as a petulant child, again, which will not sit well with the religious segment of the audience. Too bad for them that such a characterization is apt if you read the Old Testament thoroughly. What doesn't translate so well is the relationships among the central characters. I never quite bought the bond between Rameses and Moses, nor between Moses and his wife Zipporah. In general, the acting was fine given the talent involved, but none of them felt truly invested in the material, such that occasionally it came off more stagey/contrived than THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. The film also as a dreadfully slow pace and staggers from setpiece to setpiece with little or no emotional involvement or stakes beyond what is conjured up through some admittedly awesome visual effects. Ah, the visual effects. This is where the film comes out head and shoulders above its predecessors, and is really the only legitimate reason for seeing this. As stated before, Ridley Scott can do spectacle like no other and he doesn't disappoint here. There are a few well-staged battle sequences, and the 10 Plagues and crossing the Red Sea must have been jaw-dropping in theaters (I watched this on a Blu-ray). When all is said and done, the only reason I'm being so generous with the rating, or even really bothered buying it at all is because I'm a Ridley Scott fan and completist. Most other people would be better served by watching the Cecil B. DeMille film.

THE EXTRAS: As with most of Ridley Scott's films, this Blu-ray comes packaged with a wealth of supplementary material that delve into all aspects of production with very fine detail. Located on the main feature disc are about 15 minutes worth of deleted/extended scenes, which can viewed in 3D on the 3D feature disc. However, the bulk of the material is a 7-part documentary entitled ""Keepers of the Covenant - The Making of Exodus: Gods and Kings,"" which is as long as the film itself. My favorite part is the first segment which goes into the research on Moses and Ancient Egypt that was an integral part of the script and what appears onscreen. Christian Bale also referenced some books which I will probably check out in the near future, provided my interest on the subject doesn't wane too much. Predictably, there is a veritable mountain of information as Ridley Scott, et al go into how they filmed various sequences, achieved certain visual effects, and look at the various sets and locations. Supplementing this enormous documentary are ""Enhancement Pods"" that have the option to pop up at various moments while watching the main documentary and go still further into the filmmaking process with mini-featurettes on some of the previous topics, while also showing off hundreds of conceptual designs, sketches, set photos and storyboards. If you can think of it, it's all here. Those ""Enhancement Pods"" and photo galleries are also to watch independent of the ""making of"" documentary. Generally, I got the impression that Ridley Scott is a demanding, yet economical director. Perhaps he just needs to be more selective when it comes to the scripts he chooses rather than getting something ""good enough"" so that he can get to the aspects of film production that seem to interest him more, namely visuals and design.

OVERALL: This new interpretation of the Exodus story had a lot going against it from the get-go. First, the already iconic Cecil B. DeMille adaptation (twice over, actually), and also the changes made to the story in the service of ""realism."" Ridley Scott succeeded insofar as the film looks really good, but fails at creating compelling drama. Other than wasting the talents of the cast assembled, the film just feels sterile and emotionally distant; it doesn't make you feel anything, which is what all good stories should do. Other than that, this Blu-ray package is as excellent as any film Ridley Scott has done. The film looks amazing on Blu-ray (I didn't test the 3D disc, though), and the supplementary material provided befits the epic nature of the film. Dare I say that the bonus features are better than the film itself (and the reason for giving this set 4 stars)?  If you're looking for a good reference disc to show off your home theater system, or just like Ridley Scott films then by all means this will be worth a purchase. Otherwise, here's to hoping that THE MARTIAN, Ridley Scott's next film, is a step back in the right direction.",1435104000,22,5540,4.81112277019937
6883228,2,B00QUFHWMS,"Is there a theme going on here to make movies from the Bible close enough to be able to use the title? In my opinion, Moses in the movie is nothing like Moses in the Bible. Making God to be a child that Moses argues with is also an odd way to portray God, and the way Moses was interacted with Him. As opposed to meeting God at the burning bush and being so afraid, it changes to arguing with a small child... I didn't get that. This isn't as bad as Noah, but it's still bad. After watching it, going back and reading Exodus, it makes up a lot of stuff, and leaves out a lot as well. The character of the people, such as Moses, were not as depicted in the Bible, which changes the dynamic of the real story. I'm not sure what the purpose of this film was. I know it wasn't to be true to scripture.
If you do not believe the Bible, this film may be entertaining. However, I'm not sure why one who doesn't believe the Bible would even be interested in watching a film that is supposed to be about it.
If you do believe the Bible, I'd hope you share the same sentiment as I do. It leaves out a lot, adds too much fiction, and paints a very poor representation of Moses and God and the relationship they had.",1435017600,2,1204,4.041841004184101

Unfortunately, since God is the One who chooses how events in the Bible are to be portrayed, the way it comes out ends up making a mockery of the word of God and the warning expressed in two of the last three verses of the Bible applies here:

 18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:

 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

I would *not* want to be the target of *that* promise, as God's promises are always fulfilled.

6883305,3,B00QUFHWMS,"Let's be clear, this is the Exodus according to Ridley Scott, not history, let alone the Bible. (That said one can forgive him some license with a 3000-year-old story only set down in its current form hundreds of years after it allegedly happened.) The previously mentioned flaws in dialog, acting and casting are certainly there. However, what I loved about the film, ironically enough, was its depiction of the Hebrew God and his deeds. The artifice of Moses speaking to a child is obviously God's angel, as Moses obviously knows; the image or lack thereof is less important than what He says and does. And what he is is mercurial. Impatient. At times cold and dismissive to Moses, His servant. And always implacable. Ridley Scott does the audience a favor by showing just how brutal and savage the plagues were, as environmental and psychological warfare. Moses fights with his God, having misgivings about how destructive the events are; his God reprimands him for having cold feet and questions his loyalty. This God, true to Scripture, does not simply want freedom for His people; he wants submission and humiliation of his enemies--and for them to know he can. The arguable climax after the final plague, a mass infanticide, has Pharaoh angrily holding the dead body of his son before Moses. ""Is this your God? A killer of children? What kind of man worships such a God?"" The critical question at the heart of the film, to which Moses only responds that no *Hebrew* children died that night. Just as on Sinai his God did not respond to a proper name, Moses responds to a reasonable question about his God (and about himself) only by reference to power, and to mystery. And *this*, in the midst of an otherwise flawed movie, is a truly Biblical portrait of the character of God as displayed by the traditional narrative. He is arbitrary, seemingly contradictory, hidden behind a shroud of the unknown, and utterly ruthless against those he deems enemies. If you claim allegiance to the God of the Bible, you must grapple with this legacy of a dark, wild, powerful and bewildering Being of blood and fire, as much as love and justice.

6883412,3,B00QUFHWMS,"This is Hollywood at its best, fictionalizing the Biblical fictional story.  The acting is good and the computer graphics are great.  The movie begins with the Battle at Kadesh pitting the Egyptian Army against the Hittites.  The date given in the movie is about 1300 BC with Egypt the victor.  Kadesh is located in present-day Syria.  This means that the area of Canaan (and Israel today) was under Egyptian control.  In history, Israel is mentioned on the 1297 BC stela as being defeated by the Pharoah Ramesses (spelled Ramses in the movie).  There is no historical evidence that Moses ever existed or that the nation of Israel was held in slavery by Egypt.  The movie gives glory to the Israelites as having built the pyramids, the cities, monuments, and other constructions.

The depiction of the god of Israel as a ten-year old boy is ridiculous at best.  The Israelites believed in a multitude of gods and goddesses until their rescue by Persia from Babylon which they attributed then to one god.  This happened in the 500s BC.  The god of Israel sends down numerous plagues to molest the Egyptians.  Then this god decides to murder the innocent first-born and he has to have a sign to distinguish Egyptians from Israelites.  A very stupid god.

The parting of the Red Sea is pure fairy tale.  Such a heavy wave of water would have crushed Moses and Ramses.  But in fiction anything is possible.  The destruction of the Egyptian Army was limited to 4000 men in the movie to make it then impossible for the Hittites to take over Egypt.  But if the larger Egyptian Army remaining in Egypt could have been mobilized by the surviving Ramses, it could have destroyed the Israelites who were wandering aimlessly in the Sinai desert for 40 years.",1433376000,,1746,4.7218543046357615

6883456,2,B00QUFHWMS,"I would give this movie 3 stars or more for entertainment if it weren't for the biblical story being twisted to fit a secular agenda.  I personally try to study the Bible.  I'm not a ""scholar"" by any means, but if you've actually read the Bible and compared the different translations (i.e. NIV vs. NASB vs. NKJV etc...) you will easily note that there are many things they got wrong in the story.  For example, God is never referenced in the Bible as a child talking to Moses outside of the fire/burning bush.  The Bible clearly states in Exodus 3 that God is speaking from *within* the fire and *not* in the form of a child standing outside of the fire. This is just one example of many.  Also the secular explanation of the plagues is straight from the History channel and the Biblical explanations aren't even present in the movie.  For example in Exodus 7, the Bible states that Moses and Aaron stood on the bank of the Nile in the sight of Pharoah while Aaron struck the waters which turned them to blood and that the turning of the water to blood is what caused the fish and animals to die.  Exodus 7 also states that even the water in ponds, pools, buckets and pitchers was also turned to blood whereas the movie presents this plague, not as a wonder of God's work, but simply that a bunch of crocodiles ate each other which caused a bunch of blood to be in the river.  These are two extremely very different and conflicting views and again just one other example of the many ways in which an awesome history of the Bible is mutilated by a secular movie producer.",1433116800,9,1571,4.393103448275862

6883459,3,B00QUFHWMS,"I have truly never seen a ""Biblical Epic"" so afraid of the Bible before.

  Exodus was not a bad film per se just a little slow with undefined characters and an unclear plot unless you know all the finer points from the Bible story.  What truly disappointed however was that the plagues, etc. were all pretty much ""rationally explained"" and written off as natural occurrences.  River of blood?  No problem-Crocodiles eating people!  Plague of Frogs?  Here's a solution, they all rose from the water because of the blood!  The plagues were not portrayed as ""the awesome power of God"" type events that I felt they should be and if the viewer wanted to see the whole thing as Moses as just being crazy talking to himself and a series of natural events occurring to explain it all away it was like the writers wanted to give you that.  Why take a story from the bible and strip it of all its power?  Just who did they think the audience for this thing was?  Also-God coming in the form of a ten year old boy?  Lame.

  The biggest ""sin"" of all however came in the form of the Red Sea.  Moses parting the red sea is the absolute most iconic thing that happens in the entire bible story and every single movie that's ever been made about the story of Moses.  Did Moses part the red sea in this movie?  Nope.  It was the ""tides"" that drained the water.  Lame.

  By watering down these truly ""awesome"" events into mere natural occurrences-I think they did a great injustice to the source material as well as making a MUCH less powerful movie.  Want to see a movie that handles this bible story a whole lot better than Exodus?  Then check out ""Prince of Egypt"" from Dream Works.  That cartoon has more power and awe and much better story telling in it's 99 minute running time than this two and a half hour epic even came close to.  It's a shame really-I was really looking forward to Exodus.  Man-between the crap fest that was ""Noah"" and now the flat ""Exodus""-maybe Hollywood should just leave the Bible alone for a while....",1433116800,,2019,4.439890710382514

6883475,3,B00QUFHWMS,"I'm not interested in whether or not this movie is ""true to the Bible"" (one review's headline reflected this idiocy: ""A Secular take...well made but take with a grain of salt.""  Well, when dealing the Holy Book, I bring along a massive salt lick anyway.)

So, I'll concentrate on the story and story-telling, the performances and what the camera (and computers) capture.

It takes a lot to make these movies today.  Not one, not two, but sometimes the budgets of three studios--such collaboration was unheard of even twenty-five years ago--and ARMIES of people each painstakingly included in teeny tiny font on the credits crawl on and and on and on...almost like the 40 year trek the Hebrews endured after they left Egypt.

Now...how does this movie compare with what came before (Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 feature, The Ten Commandments)?  There is no comparison at all, in story, performances and visuals. Not to denigrate this ""masterpiece"" (although the temptation is there), but how could there possibly be?  Time, attitudes, story-telling forms and technology race on, and CB's ""masterpiece"" is simply left in the dust--at least in my mind, but not, I suspect, in most of the minds of the most of the 1,500 (!) people who posted reviews of the mid-50s biblical epic.

The story and story telling: very good. Immediately, we go inside the palace in Memphis, and within a few minutes have a pretty good take on the (aging) pharaoh and his two ""sons""--one legitimate, the other adopted--and their relationships, set up in short, punchy scenes--pharaoh Seti and Moses; Ramesses and infant son; Moses and his wife. Within minutes of the start, the boys are off to do battle with the Hittites.  From a pure story-telling strategy, this is great, because action breaks up dialogue scenes (one thing I remember from the 1956 version: talk, talk, talk!  This movie...moves) but also because it sets up the major premise of the greater conflict.

 Moses' conferences with ""God"" are handled in an intriguing fashion (no spoilers here) and the various plagues are executed in more-or-less plausible ways (including the ""parting"" of the Red Sea) and explained that way to Ramesses.  Anyway...  Nice touches with Moses and his ""other"" family, too. So, the human side is reflected AWAY from Egypt's palace and into a distant, dusty village of the time.

And Moses--what a difference from the stiff, formal, pontificating presence of Charlton Heston. (Forever intoning, Let My People Go!) No, this Moses is much more the man of action--as is befitting a former general of the Pharaoh's army. His strategy--or, if you will, his fate--is rationally explained. The action, the events and most of all, the MOTIVATION...makes sense, and that kept me watching.

Performances: uniformly good.  Unexpected casting, with John Turturro as nicely understated Seti, Christina Bale does well as Moses, and Joel Edgerton (Animal Kingdom, Zero Dark Thirty, Great Gatsby) is very good in a very difficult part of the lackluster new Pharaoh--born to the battlefield, but not the throne.  Thanks also to Director Ridley Scott, for keep the performances simmering, but, thankfully, a long way from the hard boil of Yul Brynner's 1956 grand-standing.

What we see: the movie is a delightful spectacle, full of sweep and truly epic ""showcase"" scenes, the LEAST of which is the Hebrews' exodus from the city.

This is a good one--not ""great,"" as some of Scott's previous works, but solid entertainment...and worthy entry from the 77-year-old director who has given us so much: Thelma and Louise, Gladiator, Blade Runner and Alien.

6883490,2,B00QUFHWMS,"Writer and director played fast and loose with what few facts they incorporated into this would-be Biblical account of the Exodus of the Jews from Egypt. Would not recommend to non-Believers because it is largely inaccurate (from larger facts to small details like the odd inclusion of a sword instead of the staff Moses used) and has Moses acting like he basically just puts up with God on the big things (even though God is portrayed as what looks like a homeless boy) and then does his own thing (almost like Jonah more than Moses). So unless it's an atheist seeking fodder for jokes about the Bible or Christians, I can't see why anyone would bother seeing it. Would not recommend to Believers because it is factually inaccurate in many ways.

It is arguably stunning, visually speaking. But the acting didn't stand out to me, the storyline was a lie, and the details were inaccurate. So I don't know another nice thing to say about it. It would be nice to see someone with the courage to tell the Biblical accounts as they really happened for a change. The truth in them is so much more fascinating (and exciting and action-packed) than Hollywood portrays them. Same thing happened with the movie Noah.

One would at least think that anyone who agreed to fork over that much money, time and effort making a beautiful flop might have actually read the stories they're supposedly portraying. Both Exodus and Noah come off as the person writing them once heard a story that sounded something a little like this, maybe. I would bet money that a blockbuster-size real portrayal of some of these stories they're not doing justice to were made according to what really happened (as told in the Bible), they would do well. People who make these movies without reading or understanding these accounts are missing out.

What about doing something on this big a scale, made on the book of Daniel? But faithful to the real story? Wow ... that would be a trip!",1433030400,2,1952,4.685131195335277

6883529,1,B00QUFHWMS,"VERY disappointing-- I wish I could get money back!  I didn't research enough to realize movie was written by atheist. It creates essentially a revisionst version of exodus into a hollywood cross of hercules/braveheart/gladiator.
God is barely mentioned/acknowledged and it seems it was made to look like plagues could have natural causes-- nothing supernatural.

The plot begins with adult Moses/Ramses fighting  in battle.  There is no story of the river/baby moses. Moses doesn't flee to desert, but banished there when Pharoah learns of Moses origins.
when moses first went to desert, he is armed with a special symbolic sword from pharaoh. He kills two assains. (not biblical) and frightens away men at well by brandishing symbolic sword.
Once married, he mocks zepporahs ""faith"". His encounter with God is created to look like a psychotic delusion/hallucination (although they at least include burning bush). God never declares who He is and instead appears  as a menancing, cruel 11yo  creepy child. Moses is only recruited because God needs help. ""i need need a general"". Throughout movie, God is distant, cold and cruel being who may/may not be all powerful. Since when does God imply that He is dependant on man? During  movie, moses had recurrent visions /conversation with this child. It is made to appear that make moses is having command hallucinations-- almost how Freud and some exsistentialist paint leaders from Bible as delusional.
After Moses 'vision' vs hallucinstion,  he returns alone to egypt  'just because' without explanation provided to his family. There id no mention of God or that God was directing Moses to Egypt to deliver His people.
Moses sneaks into Egypt wherein he first nearly assasinates pharoah  and then starts runs abd hides as he trains and subsequently leads an army of jewish rebels in war of Attrition. Unlike original story, there is no going to pharoah, no scene where moses demonstrates God's power. Infact, the movie start with the 2nd of 10 plagues and orders remaing to appear like they could have natural explanations. The first plague shown (actually 2nd of 10) is water into blood --instead of supernatural, it is agruesome scene where swarm of gigantic crocadiles eat the egyptians-- the amount of victims makes water filled with blood/dead fish. ( aparently crocs only wanted to eat humans.. almost like a scene from jurassic park meet Anaconda)
nowhere does Moses confront pharoah and it isn't until 10th plague that there is any mention  that plagues did not affect Jews/land of goshen. Additionally, pharoah starts executing jewish families in response to plagues and appears cruel to Egyptian people.
The final plague moses calls ""God"" a barbarian, states that "" I will not be humbled"" ( again opposite of Bible). He instructs Jews to slaughter lambs/spread blood on door post "" just in case"" and Moses has no confidence that God will come through.  (Again, fits with agnostic anti-religion view of God)
When the Jews are released, Moses leads them like a general leading refugees-- Moses makes all the decisions about where to go--God does not lead them with cloud during day/fire at night. Moses first decides to go to mountains while he waits for another 'vision'.  When Pharoah goes after Moses, he start to lose his army because his poor leadership tried to follow Israelites through the mountains( again not biblical).

The scene at Ref Sea----Moses starts wading into the sea because it ""feels right"". You don't reallly see the sea part. when Pharoah goes after, both have face to face show down and are consumed with waves-- yet both survive on opposite shore when rest of Army perished. There ia no mention of God/celebration that the Israelites are saved.  when Moses goes to mountains, he chisels out commandments while the child version of ""God"" asks if Moses will agree.

Final scene is where Moses is riding in Animal driven cart with the Ark. Ark slips and Moses catches it (Isnt this how Uzzah DIED on spot because he touched ark and Ark was supposed to be carried by priests?). Again, nowhere does the power of God get emphasized.

I normally don't write movie review. However aside from recent NOAH, this is one of the worst movie versions of bible story. It is almost as is writer INTENTIONALLY wrote God out of picture and origins of Israel were begun from war-hungey General. It apparently has been banned in Egypt-- and received poorly in Middle East. It is offensive to Egypt and Christians/ Jews. The acting is not spectacular, special effects not impressive. All caucasian actors played roles of main characters  which is interesting as given setting occurs in the middle east. I would give negative stars if I could.",1432944000,2,4704,5.008974358974359

I like the fact that it seems much more logical rather than wholly miraculous.  It's a viewpoint that God doesn't work through completely miraculous ways, rather that he works through simple means, abiding by the laws of nature, and only gives a slight miraculous nudge where needed.  It's a very interesting take, one that can be appreciated by people of faith and those who are agnostic or atheist.

I am religious and I hated the depiction of God.  I did not understand fully what they were trying to do with that representation.  However, I really liked that Moses seemed very human and fallible.  Moses wasn't perfect, but he did great things because he was willing to trust.

This film is certainly not an exact representation as depicted in the bible...however you really shouldn't expect that.  It's a Hollywood movie, and that means there will be extreme artistic liberties taken and it won't be a good source for religious truth.

As for the depiction of the heroes and Pharaohs as white people,I don't know that Pharaohs  were all white,dark skin or black, I believe they were all of those, people from the middle east are very heterogeneous and it is common to find white, even blond, dark skin and very dark skin people in the same family or group of related families. I think the movie generally used actors of light skin, but I think the choice of Moses , the Pharaohs and many others was a trial to depict middle eastern people more than anything else.light skin people with brown eyes, that's how people look like there.

What I hate most of the movies though was the pictures, they were really bad quality.

But I generally was an epic movie worth of seeing and trying to get something out of it.",1432339200,6,1174,4.47196261682243

Special effects and acting were superb. Love the contrast between this movie and the movie ""The Ten Commandments"".

6883788,4,B00QUFHWMS,"Pretty good film. The  acting could have been better. Ben Kingsley was awesome.

If you are Afrocentric retard you will not like this film, because they used Caucasians to play Hebrews and ancient Egyptians. Which is correct.

Little history to all those Afrocentric retards. The ruling class in ancient Egypt were Caucasians. Many Caucasian tribe rule over Egypt. The Greeks, the Persians, the Truks, the Romans and Arabs rule Egypt. Ruling class was never Black. Where there anicent Egyptians that were Black yes, along with Asisns.

Semtric people who were the Hebrews were Caucasians. Being Caucasian doesn't mean white, but bone structure, Caucasians has nothing to do with skin color. Also Africa does not mean Black, it's just a continent with many Ethnicities.

If having Caucasians actors offend you will not like the  film.

Director did great job with the set and costumes, and picking actors of all different Caucasian looks.

This movie of Moses was more realistic, not picturing him as this all perfect guy. Or guy that seem super natural. God was pictured as a child which I liked. It wasn't him just talking to burning bush.

Moses would argue with God, it wasn't like he just bowed down to God and did what he was told. Which was nice. And God argue back. The relationship he had with God was a normal human relationship.

Love how  God made seas into blood, by having some hungry aligators chopping on some humans for lunch.

I love the part where Moses tells God to stop what he was doing, because it was affecting everyone. Shows that God isn't all prrfect.

Love when Moses's brother holds his dead son in his arms and ask Moses, ""this is your God? What kind of God kills children?""

The movie did great job showing how the Christian God really is, not all loving, very mean, cruel, vengeful mother F-er you just don't want to make mad.

The part where sea gets parted for the Hebrews to pass, it wasn't Moses throwing his staff down like Gandalf doing ""you shall not pass"" thing, it was more realistic. The tides lower themselves so much the people could pass. Which I liked.

Very well made movie. Christians retards wouldn't like this movie, because God is really picted how he really is. Not loving and not perfect, just very cruel and selfish deity.",1431561600,,2275,4.7215189873417724

6883811,5,B00QUFHWMS,"I came with low expectations, given all the criticism of this film.  Having just watched it, however, I have to say that I was captivated from beginning to end.  Bravo to Ridley Scott for his interpretation and splendid portrayal of this, perhaps the most classic story in the combined Jewish and Christian heritage.

Sure, it departed from the account in Exodus in many important respects, but, then, it has to do so to be true to the very tradition of telling the Exodus story.  How much did Josephus embellish and depart from the account? Or Philo? Or the rabbinic legends?  And yet, in them all, the core remains intact.  What amazed me was -- after all the criticism -- how much of the original story is represented here.  Moses growing up in the house of a daughter of a Pharaoh, leaving Egypt as a result of killing an Egyptian (or two) and ending up in the tents of Jethro to meet his future wife Zipporah (even with the incident at the well), an encounter with the Divine on the mountain by a burning bush, returning to Egypt to liberate his people, a series of plagues initiated by God, the warning to Pharaoh, the death of the firstborn (by the way, if any of this is a spoiler to you, you are in sore need of attaining cultural literacy :)  ), the liberation of the Hebrews, the crossing of the Red Sea by a miraculous making of a path, the impetuous chasing of the Hebrews into the seabed, the devastation of the Egyptian army, the giving of the Law (the fact that Moses chisels it in stone with the personification of God standing beside is hardly a statement against the inspiration of Scripture, as one other reviewer seemed to think) -- it's all there, and quite faithfully if creatively portrayed.

Are there ""liberties""?  Certainly.  That's what makes it, in part, an interesting retelling -- how will Ridley Scott recombine elements known from the tradition with embellishments, imaginative explorations into what the Exodus story in the Bible does not say.  Moses the great general and religious skeptic finding his way to a firm belief in one and only one God; Moses first trying to figure out how to free the Hebrews using the strategies he knows rather than following God's lead from the outset (this was a major departure, but brilliant); actually, I better not continue with this list, as these WOULD be spoilers (not that anyone reads the 2,019th review of a movie).  The portrayal of God as a young boy is, in my opinion, brilliant.  What are you going to do to cast God?  Get James Earl Jones to do the voice-over for a CGI cosmic figure?  A God who is understated in his presentation of himself but limitless in power and determination -- not a bad cinematographic depiction.

If you want the biblical account, by all means read and re-read Exodus.  But I also have to go on the record here applauding Ridley Scott's film adaptation of this story and encouraging people to watch it as just that -- an adaptation that nevertheless tries to be deeply respectful of the Scriptural source.

Oh, and the CGI plagues are just fine.  I don't get the complaining about that at all.  The portrayal of the plague of the firstborn was chillingly effective.",1431302400,,3175,4.623885918003565

I am also a filmmaker, and the problem with these remakes done by atheists is not simply that they take God out of all of these classic stories -- its that they are taking God out of all of these stories!! Lol, let me explain.

What made ""Jesus of Nazareth"" such a great film -- that still stands the test of time -- is because the miracles that the God of those movies performed -- the same God of today, mind you -- are what made the film great!! Miracles are loved by the film audiences around the world. I believe there was even a film named ""Big Miracle"", one named ""Miracle in Milan"", ""Miracle on 34th Street"", ""The Miracle"", ""Miracle"". Need I go on? All of which people loved, atheist and believer alike. There is now need to take the miracles that God performed, out of the films, just to satisfy a nonsensical, PC mentality. Those miracles, and the mystery of God, are what makes the films so fantastical!! -- its what makes them great!!

""Exodus"" was no different than the recent ""Noah"" --  a poor shadow of previous films of the like. Its sad really, that hundreds of millions are being given to these filmmakers just so they can make a very expensive statement about their lack of faith - talk about a pricey propaganda piece!! -- while some really good story ideas are being passed up on an indie level.

I almost felt that just a voice would have done to represent God.  I'm sure it's pretty hard to figure out how to portray God in a movie.  I think I preferred George Burns in the Oh God series.  But the rest of the movie I liked.  Religious presentations could be just as exciting to people as the Harry Potter stuff and to my mind more worthwhile.  My daughter and her husband liked it too. They're half my age and they don't always like the same religious movies I do.  I still love the Franco Zefirelli Jesus of Nazareth; and my daughter and a church-avoiding close relative like the Zefirelli miniseries too.

Once again Hollywood has to water down the main purpose of these Bible stories by making the main character, God, into something that just aggravates and grinds on the nerves.  There should have been a terrific emotional response to Moses and what God's people went through to get to the promised land.  Instead, we are simply left with a so so fictional action movie/drama.

6883922,1,B00QUFHWMS,"It used to be the case that Hollywood hid the fact that it was a Jewish industry. All the major studios had been founded by Jews. They tended to hire mostly Jewish actors and actresses. But all this was kept a secret. The Jews felt if the gentiles ever found out that they would be destroyed.

One cover stratagem was to make Christian movies even if they were Jewish (Old Testament) stories. Anything that could be made Christian was. So the big film  'Spartacus' which had nothing in Christianity had some gratuitous Christianity thrown in. The movie ''The Egyptian' which had nothing to do with Jews or Christians had a ersatz Jewish element pasted over it. For many years the Oscar for best Picture was always awarded for the biggest Biblical Spectacular of the year. Some of these were real stinkeroos but they were 'important'.

But now all that is gone. Moses is the greatest historical figure of all time but the new Hollywood couldn't dig up a Jew to play him. They had to get a guy named  'Christian' . Good grief!

This is the second recent Jewish movie featuring only gentiles. Russell Crowe recently played Noah, I dodn't think there were any Jews in that film at all. When I was a kid I saw 'The Vikings' with the two lead Vikings played by Kirk Douglas and Tony Cutis - both Jews. Things have certainly changed.",1430870400,,1326,4.554621848739496

6883940,1,B00QUFHWMS,"I must say that this movie dusturbed me and upsetted me a lot. I grew up watching the 10 commandments and that movie was beautiful and it portrayed the exodus in a different way than this movie did.
I was raised catholic and I was taught religion since a very young age and I listened to stories about Moses and god's power but I also grew up listening about god's love and compassion.
This movie doesn't depict god as loving and compassionate. It shows god as vengeful, god killing innocent animals, god choosing sides, god using Moses to wage war against the Egyptians, and god as an angry child.
But Jesus depicts god as all loving, compassionate, inclusive and as a god who doesn't choose sides cause all of his creation is equal, because all of us are equal in the eyes of god.
In this movie even Moses tries to tell god to stop cause he has gone to far and then god tells him that his loyalty is wavering cause he cares about the Egyptians, I was like wtf? The Egyptians are god's creation as well, why would god be angry if Moses shows compassion to his fellow men regardless of ethnicity?
And the whole ""angel of death"" killing an innocent baby? A baby? Why would god kill a baby? An innocent? Men can kill men but god is beyond killing babies.
I can quote a line from a sci-fi movie that this movie reminded me of
""Kirk: What does God need with a starship?
McCoy: Jim, what are you doing?
Kirk: I'm asking a question.
""God"": Who is this creature?
Kirk: Who am I? Don't you know? Aren't you God?
Sybok: He has his doubts.
""God"": You doubt me?
Kirk: I seek proof.
McCoy: Jim! You don't ask the Almighty for his ID!
""God"": Then here is the proof you seek.
[Shoots Kirk with lightning]
Kirk: Why is God angry?
Sybok: Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
""God"": He doubts me.
Spock: You have not answered his question. What does God need with a starship?
""God"": [shoots Spock with lightning; then addresses McCoy] Do you doubt me?
McCoy: I doubt any God who inflicts pain for his own pleasure.""

6883972,1,B00QUFHWMS,"We can separate out the two features that characterize Exodus:  Gods and Kings, and we can treat each of them in turn.  The first is the tone of the movie.  The second, of course, is the controversy over the portrayal of God and the movies liberal bias.

First of all, this movie presumes to be an action movie.  As such, the biblical story--which centers upon the one-sided oppression of the Hebrews in Egypt and their eventual elusion of the Pharaohs army--is here hammered into a framework that allows it to include a bunch of sword and chariot fights!  The movie desires to be this rip-roaring, edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, a la Ridley Scotts Gladiator, but if youve seen that movie or any other war movie in the ancient Roman or Greek milieu in the past 20 years, then youve already seen this movie.  Scotts directing is a known quantity and it does nothing to elevate the subject into unchartered territory.  In its standard genre aesthetic, the movie is boring, and its populated by more of those faux British accents to lend it that foreign flavor.  Outside of the battles, the films only other attempted visual feats--the crossing of the sea and the plagues--are likewise underwhelming.  The plot wheels out one plague after the next, in episodic succession, and in its laborious recitation of the well-known story it serves to remind us just how flat and unconvincing CGI can appear in the service of uninspired writing and directing, and lacking the spark of creative storytelling or an original vision.

This is not to say that the story is beholden to the biblical narrative.  In fact, ideologically, the film does take many liberties.  Rather liberal liberties.  The go-to critical soundbite for this film is that it impiously depicts God as a petulant child.  The writers disdain for Judaism and Christianity, though, runs much deeper than this single choice.  When I watched Noah, that other biblical bomb at the box office, I didn't find it to be anywhere near as vitriolic as Exodus.  With Noah, even though the writer and director had their own agenda to push, wherever that film departed from expectations it at least managed say something new and to weave its novel ideas into the tapestry of the ancient worldview.  It serviced and embraced, in other words, a creative mythology.  But with Exodus, Hollywoods interpretation is solely destructive; it rejects the very premise of the biblical narrative, and it outright derides ancient sensibilities.  One of the opening scenes depicts the ritual of extispicy, prevalent in the ancient Near East, whereby the organs of sacrificed animals are read in divination.  In this scene, the onlookers at the royal court openly deride the practice and mock its imprecise results, appealing to the use of reason over against superstition.  This reaction, it should go without saying, is entirely anachronistic, and it retrojects an Enlightenment concept against the way in which ancient peoples made sense of the world around them.  It is as though the writer wishes to interject, How stupid they must have been to have believed all this.  At a later point, Pharaoh Ramses summarily, and with a sympathetic wink to the audience, executes the diviners when their intercession fails.  A similar instance of the films disdain for religion surrounds the plague scenes, in which an Egyptian court official interprets the events, quite reasonably, with appeal to science and to cause and effect.  (For instance, the waters turn red because of a higher content of clay, and this in turn leads the frogs to abandon the sea for land, which in turn breeds swarms of flies as the frogs die and decay, etc.)  As tremendous a toll as these fantastic catastrophes take on the Egyptian population, the majority of them can then be explained away without reference to direct acts of God.  It is clear that the internal logic of the film prefers these explanations.

Onto the character of God.  In itself, the choice to cast him as a child would not have been offensive.  Just as clearly as modern Judaism insists that God has no form, there is also another tradition within Judaism--possibly the oldest tradition--that does anthropomorphize God, that does depict him in human form.  Likewise, in Gods theophanies he often appears this way.  In further defense of the decision to depict him, I recall Moses at one point referring to the God-child as a messenger, which would imply some degree of separation between the boy and God Almighty (perhaps with the boy to be interpreted as the so-called Angel of the Lord).  Angels, as conceived in Western tradition, have commonly been established as pure and innocent beings, almost childlike in appearance.  But in any case, any patience that I may have had for entertaining the idea of God cast as a child evaporates when I consider the boys characterization as a raving, tantrum-prone brat.  While God has no obligation to explain his inscrutable reasoning, the God-child in the film is depicted as suffering violent mood swings, and he pursues an unquenchable bloodlust.  When Moses at last challenges him for acting inhumanely (another modern category), the God-child ripostes, leaning upon the length of the Hebrews servitude as ample justification for enacting his final plague--the death of the firstborn sons.  Moses never comes around to believe otherwise than that this act is abominable; he never experiences a change of thought, never agrees with the God-child on this point.  As far as the film is concerned, Moses alone is the hero, and his moral judgment (as stand-in for the audiences) is championed.  He can freely take issue with the Egyptians, the Hebrews, his family, and even God.  In other words, he can claim to be a free agent throughout.  To justify this direction, the film early on defines the meaning of Israel as one who wrestles with God.  Putting aside the historical or accepted meaning, insofar as the movie is concerned the above translation gives Moses carte blanche to flip the God-child the middle finger whenever he chooses.  Suffice to say, this is not the depiction of Moses that comes through in the biblical narrative, nor is it the portrait of piety that has made the life of Moses central to the Jewish faith.  If the Moses of this movie was alive today, he would opt for atheism right alongside the Hollywood producers responsible for putting this together.  Mosess motives are never driven by faith, nor do we learn why he cares so much for his people, the Hebrews, who he barely knows.  Instead, his reason for living is, as he says, to be with his Midianite wife and their family.  His love for her is the summit of his existence.  Thats all there is.  Echoes of Gladiator, anyone?

The film implies that Mosess visions of the God-child are hallucinations brought about by a head injury sustained on a mountain.  This is supported by a scene in which eavesdroppers listen in on one of Mosess conversations with the God-child...a conversation that appears decidedly one-sided, as Moses is apparently talking to himself.  And for another example, the Ten Commandments, far from being written by the finger of God, were in the film chiseled by Moses himself, with the imagined apparition of the God-child keeping him company.  The necessity for putting them down in stone, according to the God-child, was so that, when Moses passed away, his people would have a set of laws to guide them.  (Thus Moses could appease his own conscience.)  Nowhere is prophetic succession hinted at, nor is Joshua (Mosess successor) meant to have ever spoken to or seen God.  The boy, then, was Mosess personal delusion.

The plot is somewhat confused on this point, though.  As I stated above, the film wants us to believe that the plagues could be explained away as natural phenomena and that the God-child is a figment of Mosess imagination.  Likewise, the parting of the sea scene shows what can hardly be described as a parting, being more-or-less an ebbing of a truly bizarre tide.  Concerning the plague of the deaths of the firstborn sons, however, which was so specific in its effects, the movie can do nothing to explain it away as anything but divine intervention.  In my final estimation, then, the movie does everything it can to undermine the reality of God in almost every scene...yet it perplexingly declines to so much as give it a shot for the situation just mentioned.  The result is a confused mess that fails to make sense and is not edifying in the least.

A few final points to finish up.  1) The movie sets the scene by opening with a caption listing the year followed by a BCE (Before Current Era) designation, rather than the BC (Before Christ) identifier that you would expect to find in a faith-based movie.  Was this to accommodate a Jewish audience or, more likely, to devalue the spiritual meaning of the movies events?  2) Moses and the other characters consistently refer to their ancestral homeland--Gods promised land, the land of Israel--as Canaan, thereby naming it vis-a-vis its then-current inhabitants (who the Hebrews had yet to encounter but who would later become hated enemies).  This implicitly legitimizes the status quo in the land, as it belonged to a people other than Israel.  Could this be a nod to the Palestinians of today and a liberal statement on world events?  3) The title of the movie!  What on earth does Gods and Kings imply?  As for kings, early scenes lay the groundwork for a contested monarchy with an oracle that seems to predict the rise of Moses to leadership, over against Ramses, who is his dear friend and legitimate heir to Pharaoh at the royal court.  Yet Moses never once asserts any desire to lead anyone at all, and he certainly never pretends to be a king.  He denies any such ambition at every turn.  The only kings in the movie are, in fact, the two pharaohs, Ramses and his father.  One of the pharaohs administrators lives an opulent lifestyle, for which Moses chides him.  The God-child does not possess any kingly attributes either; if anything, his temperament distinguishes him as warrior-god, not divine king.  The plural kings in the title, therefore, is difficult to explain.  But what of gods?  The only fleshed-out god in this movie is the God-child, whom the movie may or may not even acknowledge as truly existing.  The gods of the Egyptians are mentioned only in passing, usually in a mocking tone, and the sense is that they have no real existence either.  The movie could have established a dichotomy between the false gods of Egypt and the true God of Israel but, of course, it denies the latter assertion and upholds the former only because the idea of gods is preposterous to a modern audience and not because the non-reality of the pagan gods might point to the reality of some other God.  So the gods title does not fit either, since the number of gods established here ranges from 0 to 1.  Finally with regard to the title, the Exodus appelation must also be regarded as unfounded.  The movie covers the escape from Egypt and briefly touches upon the giving of the Law.  But the other subjects and events of the Exodus narrative--the tabernacle, the priestly office, the Golden Calf, Korah, the wandering, the manna, the staff, and the pillar of fire, to name but a few--are all lacking.  4) Lastly, in order to set Moses up as the lead protagonist and Pharaoh Ramses as the antagonist, the movie minimizes the role of other figures in order to prevent them from getting in the way.  (The writers of this long clunker of a blockbuster wouldnt want to distract the audience with an actual subplot.)  This utter neglect applies to Joshua, who will become Mosess successor, and especially Aaron, who is almost absent from the film.  Aaron, Mosess brother, in the biblical narrative serves as spokesman for God and appears before Pharaoh, as Moses was supposed to be timid in speech.  But far be it for the manly Christian Bale to be anything but confident on film!  Here Aaron would have only been a third wheel.  Thus the divided leadership between the brothers is eliminated and never mentioned; Moses speaks to Pharaoh himself.",1430697600,,12144,4.861867704280155

6883976,3,B00QUFHWMS,"(This review is for the 3D version on DirecTV, watched on my new Sony 4K TV with passive 3D.)

I read an article not very long ago, that said that the Red Sea actually parts every once in a blue moon.  Supposedly, under the correct conditions, the sea doesn't need God -- or Moses -- to do this.  If the article was true, I think that ""Exodus:  Gods and Kings"" should have taken advantage of this information just a little bit more.  Perhaps some letterboxed text saying something like, ""Yes, the Red Sea occasionally parts, even to this day.  Is it the case that Moses just happened to arrive at the beach just at the right time?"" or something along those lines.  It would have lent a little more street cred to the tale.

I also think that the screenwriter, director, and producers should have taken even a bigger risk:  why not have the actors speak in their actual native tongue?  With letterboxing?  This technique really worked with a couple of Mel Gibson flicks -- ""Passion"" and ""Apocalypto"" in particular -- and I think that it really would have worked here.  At first, when you watch a film this way, I will admit that reading the text seems annoying.  But after a few minutes, you get used to it, and then the film takes on more authenticity.

While I am a big fan of Christian Bale, to me, he just didn't work in this role; I don't know exactly why.  Why not Russell Crowe?  I kept thinking that Mr. Crowe would have been perfect as Moses.  Maybe Mr. Crowe was approached initially, read the script, and smartly passed.  But John Turturro was probably the biggest misfire; his character just fell flat to me, a complete caricature.  SPOILER:  but the biggest mistake:  portraying God as a small child.  Really?  REALLY?  I almost laughed when this character first appeared on screen; I almost choked.

But this did look pretty impressive on my new Sony 3D passive 4K TV, as one would expect.  You really get the best of both worlds with 4K and passive 3D; 1080P per eye.  The Red Sea scene, in particular all of the seagulls, was quite impressive.  You get a real sense of texture at those points in the film.

But what would God say if he watched this film?  Probably, ""Oh, God, this film stinks.""  But then He might get mad at himself for taking his own name in vain, but not as mad as He would be at the writer and director for creating this abomination.",1430697600,2,2368,4.437209302325582

6884032,2,B00QUFHWMS,"Exodus: Of Gods and Kings

hmmmmmm. There were two major Old Testament epics within the last year or two. Noah and Exodus. I saw Noah a few months ago, and I actually thought it was pretty good. Exodus, not so much. The acting was fine. The special effects were par for the course in 2015. It took a while, but I think I figured out why I liked Noah so much better.

I think it's an unavoidable reference in my mind to previous biblical epics, and the scriptures themselves. There haven't really been any previous films on Noah and the ark. I think this is largely because there is so very little scripture on which to base the story. Any director would by necessity need to actually create a story. And, so long as it didn't directly butt heads with the scripture, there's not much criticism that can be leveled by either the general movie goer, nor even the Christian or Jewish movie goer. The director's and writers of Noah came up with a plausable, and I though very good film. I didn't dismiss the scriptural material, and had lots of room be be inventive and compelling as a full take on a story that we don't have much reference to. I thought it was grand.

Turn to Exodus Gods and Kings. The story of Moses in the bible covers an entire book. (Exodus). The reference material in scripture nearly writes the story itself. Not to mention, we've gotten this story in ""The Bible""; ""The Ten Commandments""; and other movies all our lives. When you have a story with that much scripture and other film versions underpinning it, you can do very little in the way of personal interpretation and story telling, and get away with it.  There's too much available material for this story to get the same kind of moviegoer pass that Noah gets, which had little sourse material at all.  If you're going to take on Exodus, you kind of have an ipso facto responsibility to at least not blatantly contradict the source material, or re-invent the source material. If you want an entirely new and different story about Egyptians and slavery etc., then I would think you want a different story altogether. If you did a film from the viewpoint of a slave perhaps, focussing on his or her life, and have that persons life touch or interwine with some of the elements of the book of Exodus, perhaps.  Some kind of new change of view point in order to give yourself a wider canvas and a wider artistic license.  But to bill the story as Exodus, and then make up your own book of Exodus which doesn't relate to many or even most of the key elements of the story is not going to set well.  I could be wrong.  I like Ridley Scott films by and large.  I'm not trying to be hypercritical here.  The whole thing just sat very poorly with me, and my family, and I think we represent quite a few others.  I just thought all view points should be represented here in the reviews.

Actual scripture was blatantly altered. Character motivations and qualities were changed or outright replaced with different characters operating under the same name. In this one, Moses is a multiple murderer. Not just the one killing which he felt was done in justice. He doesn't sorrow over his killing, (or killings). He never goes to Pharoe with the obligatory ""Let My People Go"". There's no reference to most of the story. Where was Aarons staff?

As for the Red sea climax of the entire story and movie........all I can say about this one is, really? I'm not trying to hamstring anyone. Film makers can do what they like. But I'm wagering that a shot for shot remake of ""The Ten Commandments"" with perhaps these same actors, and the amazing technology we have in 2015 would have gone over far far better with almost any movie goer, and this may have become a modern classic.

Exodus: Gods and Kings was just so very disappointing. And I think that's why. Too much access to well known source material, overlooked, ignored or misused,  and unavoidable comparison to the epic movie of the 1950's. It's a pity the producer and director couldn't have taken those restrictions and done something really special with them. The time was ripe.  We're in a renaissance of biblical movies.  I'll be waiting to see what the ""survivor"" guy and Roma Downey do with their upcoming remake of Ben Hur. I hope it's a much better effort that this was.",1430611200,,4294,4.532988357050453

6884065,3,B00QUFHWMS,"Rented this movie for an evening anticipating it would be on par with the Biblical epics shown on the big screens in the 50's and 60's, only with much more believable and spectacular special effects and awe inspiring surround sound. After two and a half hours of HD big screen viewing and Movie Theater like acoustics all I can say is, I wasn't disappointed with the special effects. Frankly, I found the whole thing to be lamentably anticlimactic. I can't really say it was all that bad, I just can't say that it was really all that good. It starts out interesting and then quickly flounders as Moses, after being exiled, is more or less placed in the role of a supporting actor who never takes much of a lead and performs no inspiring deeds or miraculous acts. In this rendition the character of Moses appears to have been reduced to little more than a reluctant messenger sent on errands he doesn't understand to placate the whims of small dirty boy representing Yahweh whose manifestation in no way reflects the majesty one would expect from the God of the Israelites. Egypt drudges on and on through plagues that lose all their Biblical connection as they're reduced to a series of loosely associated and barely believable natural occurrences. All in all, despite my wanting it to, this picture show never met my expectations of what I believed it could have achieved. Perhaps my expectations were just too high. Likely because I'm comparing it to that Biblical epic from 1956, Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments"".  Yeah, I know it's hard to compete with an all-star cast like Yul Brynner as Rameses and Charlton Heston as Moses, but one would think that with all of today's technology and DeMille's 59 year old epic as a template for success they could have pulled this one off.

SOME SPOILERS: First off, how do you make a movie about Moses and he doesn't even part the sea. That is like making a movie about the Lord and not including His sacrifice and resurrection. I think Christian Bale had great potential to play a convincing role of Moses. I also thought Ramses was a perfect fit. In all reality, this movie barely resembles the Biblical story of Moses. Moses does not warn about the impending plagues the Lord will send if the children of Israel are not freed. Moses is not a prophet, but a general. The Israelites refer to Moses as General Moses. Moses writes the ten commandments himself, instead of the Lord writing them.

Even with the movie not resembling the Biblical story aside, at least make a descent Hollywood fantasy version. It is not even entertaining as an action movie. I have to say the beginning ten to fifteen minutes was well done. I thought the movie was going to be great, but immediately fell flat.

6884183,2,B00QUFHWMS,"As others have noted, this is only LOOSELY based on the book of Exodus in the bible. As with Noah, Hollywood seems to feel it must down play divinity and any usual interpretation of biblical events for some sort of humanistic focus, rather than acceptance of God's directives and execution of them with confidence and grace. Instead of confidence fueled by God's grace, Moses thinks he's supposed to create a Hebrew army to free ""God's chosen people"". God appears as a sometimes petulant child who speaks in half riddles and innuendo, rather than the clear directives God gives in the bible.

The older version by Demille has some biblical flaws as well......but they are minor to the main story (for example, Aaron is absent).

The movie is a beautifully rendered historical picture of ancient Egypt and its glory, but ultimately it leaves one empty of anything other than visual beauty, kind of like potato chips when one was expecting (and hoping) for a fully loaded baked potato with butter, sour cream and chives.

If you don't like reading the Bible because some of the names or words are hard to pronounce; get the audio Bible from Amazon. I list to it every night, I listen to the entire book then I went back and list to it again, but this time I took notes to remember and for quick reference. Once you read/listen Exodus in the Old Testament, people will come to a realization of how this world is being destroyed.

There were so many flaws in this movie I don't know where to start.  When God spoke to Moses at the burning bush, He was portrayed as a little boy.  It appeared as if Moses did not have to stand before Pharaoh, and ask for the Hebrew people to be set free. This little boy seems to command all of nature and sends plagues on Egypt.. Why can't Hollywood just create a movie that follows what is written in the Bible.  This was so bad I could not stand to see the ending.  I'm sure it did not have any miracles or God bringing the Hebrew people out of bondage.  This was just as bad as the Noah movie.  It is not worth any amount of money to watch.

The movie was entertaining, but really just O.K. in my viewpoint.  It wasn't spectacular or moving in any way to me.  The special effects were fairly good.  The acting was good.  I wish I would have waited for a free version, but I don't regret renting it.  It was a fairly entertaining time, just not to the degree I would have hoped.

I liked the way the movie showed the effects of the plagues and the Egyptian explanations for them.

I didn't find it to be particularly secular as some reviewers noted.  I absolutely got the impression while watching the movie that God was performing all of this in order to free the people.  I do wish they would have showed the scene where Moses presents the Ten Commandments to the people.

I didn't really agree with the representation of the child as being God, but I didn't find him ""whiny"" as some did, well maybe at first.  I don't know why they chose that representation, but it didn't really bother me that much.  It seemed very ""Dalai Lama"" to me.

Disgusting Movie.

Definitely unfit for Children.

This Movie is an attack on Moses and his character before G-d.

6884314,1,B00QUFHWMS,"So we watched Exodus: Gods and Kings last night. Ive got to say it was the most disappointing & worst show Ive seen in quite a few years. If possible I would give it zero stars or negative stars. Yes, I know it was a Hollywood production; however, there have been quite a few of those that were actually great movies. Spoiler alerts if you want to waste 2  hours of your life on a work of fiction. They took God out of the story-No, Let My People Go, no questions or warnings to Pharaoh. No staff which Aaron used as directed by God. Youve got a petulant Moses that constantly argues with God who is portrayed by a young boy with a bad attitude and vengeance against everyone. They keep Moses as more of a general  who trains the slaves to fight (ala Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves)  rather than the Prophet he was that turned to God for direction in all his doings.
The first signs when Moses went to Pharaoh, the staff turning into a serpent-totally not shown.  Aaron as the spokesman-nope, in this farce Moses takes care of everything himself. They also took the plagues that were caused by God, thru his prophet, into just mishaps that happened to fit the plagues. The three days of darkness-only the Israelites had light in their dwellings-the Egyptians had no light at all for those three days  Hollywood changed the story again, lets give light to everyone.
Cloud by day and pillar of fire by night to lead the Israelites where they needed to go-nope, lets change it to Moses deciding all by himself which way to go. Crossing the Red Sea on DRY ground, again changed-lets start wading up past our waists in the water, also lets have Moses stay behind and almost get drowned as well.  All the Egyptians that followed into the sea were drowned and not one remained- changed again that some survived and washed up on shore.
The Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses while on Mount Sinai  engraved on stone tablets, by the finger of God; the movie decided to again take God out of the equation and had Moses engrave them himself.
If this had been portrayed as just a fiction story and not an occurrence in the Bible, it would have been an ok movie. However, when the storyline and script are already outlined for you, how and what exactly occurred, its pretty darn stupid to ignore it all. It seems to be an unfortunate attitude in this day and age that God is being taken out of all that happens and has happened and are giving tribute to man as the one who did it. This follows along the lines of other things in history  like saying that the Holocaust atrocities never happened, its just a story something that the Jews made up; that slavery and the atrocities there never happened. Just because man changes the history books and stories doesnt change the facts.",1429920000,14,2769,4.46930693069307

Yes, there were parts that were different from the Bible, but I feel like a lot of the Bible is open to interpretation anyway....after all, it is a God-inspired book written by man, not God himself. I feel like the liberties they took, didn't change the core of the story: God delivered the Israelites from Egypt. That is clear in the movie. I seem to be the only one who actually LIKED the depiction of God as a child.  I felt like the movie was also portraying a vengeful God....and using the child to portray that worked on some level (at least for me).

6884356,3,B00QUFHWMS,"This movie was interesting for what it left in, what it took out, and how it put it all together. I think a lot of people read the Bible and don't really think about what they are reading. Putting it in a visual context may make some people think a bit more. I think those who want every detail will be unhappy that everything wasn't included. I was a bit peeved about that too. Not that I needed every detail, but some things that were glossed over would have given a lot more context and meaning to the story. I know some will hate that Moses seemed to have doubts rather than be a faithful servant of God. I think that shows a human side. Surely he MUST have questioned what was happening. I didn't care that God was portrayed as a child. Aren't children the most godlike of all human creatures?

As for the effects, they were stunning. I don't think they got the scenery right. I know that the area around Giza was lush and fertile during that time period. The story said that Moses wandered the desert for 40 years after the liberation, but I don't think that Memphis and the surrounding area was desert at the time. Whatever.

The acting and casting choices were ODD. Bale is a much better actor. Not sure why he was chosen for this or why he didn't deliver. Overall, it was just okay. Some hits, some misses. I am glad I Redbox'd it.",1429833600,,1340,4.292490118577075

Moreover I couldn't care less that they showed God as taking the form of a child...I take offense to putting words and emotions into Gods mouth that he never had nor showed...that part ticked me off.

6884451,5,B00QUFHWMS,"Just to preface this; I was raised in a non denominational Christian, Bible based Church. My family went every Sunday growing up, and attended or hosted Bible studies, church camp, and youth groups. I have seen many, many different Bible based movies in church, at home, with Christian friends, etc. When I was younger I wanted to grow up to be a missionary and even went on a youth mission trip within the U.S. However as I grew older, I began to wrestle with God because I did not understand how a ""God [who] IS love"" could also deny so many people entrance to Heaven or how so many people who claim to believe the word of God would only attend church to try and ""keep up appearances,"" instead of fighting the injustices of this world. I noticed the similarities I saw between mega-church preachers and politicians and it was all so wrong to my heart. I cried to God about this injustice and began to meditate. *Side note: check out ""The Irresistible Revolution"" or  http://www.amazon.com/Red-Letter-Revolution-Jesus-Really/dp/1400204186/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y if this is what your heart cries out about  also.*

From my standpoint and in my opinion; Exodus is the most cinematically realistic, grippingly thought provoking Bible inspired movie I have seen to date.

 It portrays a realistic, artistic interpretation of this particular book of the Bible and it feels like what really happened without all of the distracting lack of modern relatability I find in other versions and I truly feel that this movie takes into consideration whatever spin the council of Nicea may have added (or subtracted) to the story to make it come to life for modern movie watchers and Bible readers. I found myself pausing the movie to feverishly jot down the questions racing around in my mind while watching. I found myself wondering how I may stop the social injustices happening today. I found myself relating Rameses to the major corporations that hold our money and our lives hostage, enslaving us to commodification, keeping us psychologically and emotionally rooted to philosophies that our overly consumeristic says are good, pure, and even 'Christian'. And I found myself wondering how I can be more like Moses in the life that I have chosen to live right now.

A good movie stirs you, brings something of your core being to the surface and enlightens your spirit to some deeper truth that you had forgotten you needed to hear. I have always enjoyed reading a mind stirring, heart tugging book and seeing it come to life on the screen. Exodus: Gods & Kings certainly makes this Bible story more life- like and relatable for me.",1429574400,,2620,4.916289592760181

I do like the depiction Scott chose of the plagues where you could argue that they are natural disasters, this way showing how Pharaoh could argue them away. Ramses was an interesting acting choice, but Bale's Moses seemed more questionably insane by the end. I did like the more personable approach to the dialogue relationship between God and Moses. In the end the movie just didn't deliver (no pun intended).
 I just wish Scott, a brilliant director, had chosen a different biblical epic and breathe something new into the bible epic genre instead of choosing a story that has already been covered numerous times with great films.",1429574400,2,697,4.957264957264957
6884471,3,B00QUFHWMS,"RIDLEY SCOTT knows what hes doing. He keeps reminding us of that fact during the commentary for Exodus: Gods and Kings, just as he did in his commentary for Prometheus. And we believe him. At 77, hes brought us scores of great movies including Blade Runner, Alien, Gladiator and Black Hawk Down. Whenever this man announces a new film, audiences world-wide pay attention.

But something went awry with Gods and Kings. Despite its splendid cast  Christian Bale as Moses!  and amazing production values, it just doesn't shine. Jeffrey Caine, one of four script writers on the project, addresses the obvious in the Blu-rays commentary.

[Ridley] said that he wanted a version of the well-known story of Exodus that was different from previous versions, especially different from the Cecil B. DeMille which was too rigorously literal in its interpretation of the Bible, Caine tells us. He wanted something that would reach an audience that wasn't composed entirely of the faithful, but not excluding the faithful.

So part of the problem may be that I am one of the faithful and I do happen to love DeMilles Ten Commandments, even with all its campy flaws. Bottom line, theres no denying the passion found in that 1956 film, a factor thats sadly lacking in Gods and Kings.

Do I have to tell you the plot? Moses, found as a baby floating down the Nile in a basket, is adopted into the Pharaohs family and raised as one of his sons. He grows into a powerful military commander, but is banished when his true origins are revealed. He discovers God and is instructed to return to Egypt and free His people  which he does with Gods help and 10 horrible plagues that convince Moses former brother to let those people go. The story culminates with Pharaohs pursuit, where he chases Moses and the Hebrews into the Red Sea, which parts at Gods command only to close on the Egyptian army after the others escape.

I confess I had visions of Scotts spectacular Gladiator in mind when this project was announced. Like The Ten Commandments, Ive lost count of how many times Ive seen it in all its versions. Strangely enough, God is missing from Scotts version of Exodus. The director is so determined to present possible logic  as in the plague sequences, which are very good  that he loses the mysticism. Even the priestess interpreting sacrifices for Pharaoh Seti is more wiseass than seer  and we see Bales Moses laughing at the process in the background.

Bottom line, Scotts scientific presentation of the plagues would have worked in a film that didn't work so hard to disprove miracles and consequences. We never believe Moses conversion to believer because theres nothing to believe in.

Foxs Blu-ray on 2-D and 3-D is outstanding, even if the climatic Red Sea crossing sequence becomes a rather ho-hum outing. Scott opts not to use Moses staff for the parting because, you know, it could be those freak tornadoes that divide the Red Sea. The plagues run rampant, frogs and locusts jump right into your theater room. Details are clearly defined, so sharp as to appear unnatural at times. (Sweeping vistas of Setis armies appearing early in the film are so uniform and perfect, I felt Id wandered into an online war game.) Scott informs how so much of the work was CGI, happily noting when actors were actually walking through parking lots and the like. A deliberately cool palette quashes the sense of place, turning the desert into a pale shadow of itself. Even a day-lit battle scene falls under a cloud that has nothing to do with dust or weather. (We saw Lawrence of Arabia; we saw Gladiator. We know what deserts look like.)

And truthfully, I missed special effects Id hoped to see. The burning bush is replaced by a boy, which might have been spooky in a sci-fi or horror flick, but has no presence here. I missed the Finger of God creating the Commandments  again, a major highlight of the original story and deleted from this version. What was the point in making Exodus if they never planned to film it? Its not much of a surprise the film only earned a 28% approval rating on rottentomatoes.com.

Needless to say, the immersive DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack is dynamic in every sense of the word. From effects to ambient background noise to dialogue, the audience is always surrounded by sound.

What I did enjoy  and what makes this Blu-ray worth its cost  is re-viewing the film combining its commentary with The Exodus Historical Guide, which plays out like a tutorial across the bottom of the screen. Scott and Caine were recorded separately; their comments edited together to provide a wealth of film tech info, anecdotal stories and valid theoretical opinions. Meanwhile, through the guide, we learn how scholars have tried to place events in the Bibles story with data gleaned from historical fact, such as when Exodus may have taken place and under which pharaohs reign; there are also various philosophical interpretations of the events. (Its the kind of material wed have enjoyed in Paramounts equally disastrous Noah.) Deleted and extended scenes fill out the bonus features.

Here's a note to directors, writers and studios: If you're going to make a film about a Bible story, keep the source material in. Thanks.   Kay Reynolds",1429574400,2,5248,4.814238042269188

I'm all for updating new stories with modern twist and technology.  But when a movie departs so far from the original story, I can't help but ask why?  This movie as well as Noah that came out a couple years back took well known Biblical stories with already pretty well defined details and changed them around for no reason.  Why not come up with something original?  Why change the source material so much that it's not even the same story?  The story doesn't leave a lot of room for ""interpretation"", really.  We know what happened with Moses and the life he lived and how long he lived in the wilderness before he came back to see Pharaoh.  We know who was with him when he went to see the Pharaoh and what took place.  I'm having a hard time understanding why they went out of their way to change the story.

Hollywood loves to rewrite every book and story to fit the mood of the director. This story is so famous and believed that I see no reason for rewriting it. Some of it was just so different that it detracted from the film.

Why is God depicted as a 10 year old child?

Why is Moses writing the 10 commandments on a rock while God watches and they discuss what they should say?

6884567,4,B00QUFHWMS,It's not quite Cecil B Deville but better.  The movie shows God's purpose being worked through nature for the plagues on Egypt.  What is also good is the way that it shows Moses as a man with the doubts and fears o's an ordinary man even though he was called for a special task.  The effect of the plagues on the ordinary people was great also.  When the movie showed Ramses with sores on his face for a long part of the movie caused by the flies and hail was ingenious on the part of the movies directors. Over all the movie was almost gifted and showed God's purpose through the ordinary.,1429401600,,590,4.241071428571429
6884578,4,B00QUFHWMS,"Exodus isn't a great film but it is a beautiful visual experience, if you're up for it. It takes the biblical story of Moses as inspiration and creates a more realistic tale about one man's obsession with freeing his people. Whether God or insanity motivates this the movie leaves up to interpretation, but in the end it's not very compelling either way due to a critical lack of plot and characters. Only Moses gets any character development, everything else is either action or spectacle.

The spectacle is super nice though. Ridley Scott knows how to film a movie and Exodus looks as good as anything else out there. Every scene, be it talking around a campfire or dodging arrows and tidal waves on a chariot, looks stunning. Watching the blu-ray on a large screen is a stunning experience that almost makes you forget how little story there is in what you're watching. The plagues, ""red"" sea tidal wave and battle scenes are just breathtaking. If you believe cinema can succeed sometimes purely in visuals then you should at least rent this blu ray, it is exquisite.

The bonus disc found exclusively in the deluxe edition has one of Ridley Scott's normal 2+ hour long making-of documentaries on it. The documentary delves deep into production, casting, direction and post-production in all manner of ways which should greatly appeal to movie enthusiasts. It's a little more focused and congratulatory than similar Ridley Scott documentaries, in my experience, but still is super interesting throughout. There are also deleted scenes and a short documentary about who Moses was (or rather how he was likely no one at all).

In the documentary you will see a lot of cut footage which is all character moments, and sadly this is what the film needed most. It's a visual feast and it's interesting to see a Moses story told in a secular way, but there just isn't enough character or drama here to recommend the movie itself. Ridley Scott mentions here that he had a 3+ long cut he loved at one point but he had to edit it down. Maybe someday, like with Kingdom of Heaven, we will see that longer cut and reevaluate the movie. As it is now Exodus is a lot of pretty images and not much else, though when Ridley Scott makes pretty images I stand up and pay attention.",1429401600,,2266,4.688442211055277

6884581,1,B00QUFHWMS,"Following the ""Noah"" debacle, you'd think Hollywood would WANT to make a biblically-based film correctly and just FOLLOW THE STORY. ""Exodus: Gods & Kings"" had SO much potential, but there was no way for it to be realized given Ridley Scott's exasperating artistic arrogance as director. It's as if Scott's attitude was, ""Hey, all you Bible-believing yahoos, I'm just gonna make up TONS o' stuff that's not even IN the Bible -- and I'm also gonna leave out a lot of stuff, too! And if you don't like it, TOUGH!""

SO many liberties were taken with the story of Moses and the book of Exodus that it made for an excruciatingly frustrating viewing experience. I mean, COME ON: God portrayed as a very annoying, smart-assed little boy?? Moses having major doubts about God throughout the story? No Aaron? No pillar of fire? No staff for Moses? No dramatic parting of the Red Sea? MOSES etching the ten commandments on tablets of stone?

But that's the kind of nonsense we get in this colossal waste of time. Once again, Hollywood gets a Bible tale unbelievably wrong. And amazingly, the 60-year old ""Ten Commandments "" is STILL the definitive film version of the Moses story.",1429315200,,1169,4.753694581280788

6884587,3,B00QUFHWMS,"Considering this was directed by Ridley Scott and Christian Bale as the lead, I had high expectations for the movie.  And though there are some things in the film that I liked, this movie like Noah left me a bit disappointed.  The visual effects are well done and stunning in their scope and detail.  The scenery was very well done.  The action sequences and the depictions of the plagues were also very well done with its mix of special effects.  The issue with the movie is that the flow is uneven and a bit plodding and slow at times.  Like Noah, I didn't expect a true to book depiction in the movie but the boy speaking to Noah seemed a bit of an odd choice to relay the message of god.  This is one of those movies that felt too long and a bit too short at the same time.  Sequences that should have been explored were not (or left on the cutting room floor) and others were too long and a bit unnecessary and should have been edited a bit.  I will agree with other reviewers who say this felt a bit too cautious in its storytelling.  Instead of just trying to tell the story as it written, they instead try to flash it up and make it into something more and end up falling a bit short.  I found it watchable and better than the previous Noah movie but still not as good as it could have been.

It was like some strange story that had one thing in common with the biblical version, the word Exodos.  Bad enough that the title would imply a bible based movie, it is not, the story, acting and even effects had no redeeming qualities.  I was disappointed and glad I rented it first.  Why steal a biblical title and make a totally secular movie with it.  Kind of like titling a movie to be about wales and featuring elephants.  Watching it will make you sad that Hollywood would go so far astray.  All then needed was a gay moses with a lesbian mother, that will probably be part two.

Portraying God as a boy is a brilliant choice by the writers and director. Crossing of the Red Sea is spectacularly done, so much better than the old 10 Commandments film from the 1950's. Perhaps the actor chosen for Rameses could have been chosen better instead of the Aryan looking actor who was used. Rameses with blue eyes? and a very Teutonic face and physique with pale skin?

6884690,5,B00QUFHWMS,"And Moses said to the people, ""Do not be afraid. Stand still..., and see the salvation of the Lord, which He will accomplish for you, today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall see again no more, forever. The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace"" (Exodus 14:13-14 NKJV). Moses spoke those words on the eve of one of the greatest miracles within the entire Old Testament: The Red Sea Parting. After 430 years of unwarranted servitude and slavery, the Children of Israel were about to experience a freedom... so complete in it's totality, that it had to be fought for and won by, the Lord Himself, through His chosen servant, Moses (Exodus 12:40 KJV). ""...And the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided"" (Exodus 14:21 KJV). Academy Award winning Actor - Christian Bale stars as Moses, in this big-screen, spectacular and riveting, epic presentation of Moses and the Children of Israel in their struggle for national, spiritual and personal liberty, from their harsh and often times, inhumane taskmasters. Director Ridley Scott (Gladiator), who lovingly dedicated the film to his  brother - Tony Scott, presents the viewing audience with yet another, superb and absolutely, brilliant film. And although, some theatrical license was taken, the basic theme and story line within the Old Testament - Book of Exodus are both - researched and respected, in it's depiction. And the unique before-and-after Red Sea Parting relationship between the adopted, one-time, Prince of Egypt - Moses, and the heir apparent, the biological son of Pharaoh - Ramses, is also focused, on. And the viewer gets a rare treat. That being: The historically accurate battle between the Egyptians and the Hittites, is also shown. Superb cinematography, costuming and dramatic, special effects are depicted in widescreen format with subtitles in both English and Spanish. This mesmerizing, 2014, edition of EXODUS/GODS AND KINGS, comes to it's audience in color on a single-disc, DVD ans is approximately 150-minutes long. And besides being historically and spiritually accurate, this compelling film is definitely entertaining. ""And the waters returned and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them"" (v. 28); ...for He (the Lord) hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea"" (Exodus 14:28 & 15:21 KJV).

Hollywood continues to disappoint time and time again when making Biblically based movies and I will no longer allow myself to be let down by watching their lackadaisical attempt at portraying an awesome Biblical story.,1429056000,,554,4.821052631578947

6884792,5,B00QUFHWMS,"Despite many areas where the movie missed something (e.g. how the killing of the Egyptian happened and the cutting out of the tedium of Pharaoh and Moses' back and forth with the mystics), I appreciated that where liberties were taken, they were taken from a modern understanding of science. Not to say an atheistic standpoint by any means, but from a logically realistic view = the mystics meekly duplicating Yahweh's miracles performed through Moses were replaced by a court counselor who tried to explain away the miracles with reason. I find this very appealing for a post modern audience. But most of all, for me (and only me as far as I'm concerned) I absolutely adored the depiction of the crossing of the Red Sea. Far be it from me, an unrecognizable undergraduate to explain the work of the supreme being, but I found this depiction more along the lines of what I have in my head when I read Exodus. Yahweh had an East wind blow all night so that the water collected away from where they would cross, then while they were crossing it is said that the water was like a wall on either side of them. In the movie this is exactly what happened, unlike Prince of Egypt (which I also enjoy) and Bruce Almighty (with the tomato soup). Only downside that got me is that the spirit of God is depicted as a young boy. Don't get it confused, most reviews say that Yahweh himself was a little boy in this movie, but when the burning bush happened the bible says that the spirit of God came to Moses, therefore casting a young British boy as the Spirit that we all trust in. A bit strange. Also the finger of God didn't literally write the covenant in the movie. Christian Bale did. Still better than Noah.",1428969600,4,1702,4.47588424437299

This flick wasn't as bad as the movie ""Noah"", but it may be #2 in the list of extremely bad movies in the past few years.
As a sci-fi  movie, it might have worked, but as a historical account, it really sucked.

I think everything was in place with this movie with the exception of the concept/depiction of 'god.'  Also, I think they could have worked to establish and deepen the relationship between Batman and the Pharaoh more.

6884956,1,B00QUFHWMS,"If you're looking for the story of Exodus, this is not it.  This is some kind of fantasy movie borrowing the imagery of the biblical  Exodus story, but it is in no way the story of Exodus.  The title itself is a dead give away that this is a bible story from the point of view of people who do not believe the bible.  It tries to discredit God and His terrifying and wonderful relationship with Moses.  It portrays their relationship as nothing more than a hallucination and dementia, suggesting that all of those miracles were just semi-spectacular acts of nature and God is just a delusion in Moses' mind.  Why is mainstream entertainment sucking up all the best bible stories and extracting God out of them?  Should've known better than to expect bought and paid-for big name companies to actually base the movie off of what scripture says.  This movie is even worse than the Noah movie, where Noah goes off on some inexplicable rampage to kill his family.  None of that is in the bible or even hinted at in the bible.  Starting to feel like these ""religious based"" movies are nothing more than a couple high up atheists attempts to explain away God.  Focus on making stories you enjoy, not an agenda to try to discredit other peoples beliefs.  No self-respecting actor, artist or director takes on a specific story or event and then completely changes the main theme and point of it.  If you don't believe in the subject matter, you shouldn't be making movies about it.  Go make your own material or make movies based off of things you support.  o.o

I will never understand why Hollywood takes a thrilling story from the Bible and completely changes it.  I understand the necessity of creating new characters and writing imaginary dialogue to fill out the story for the screen, but if they are going to change it as much as they changed the story of Moses, why not just write something completely new?  Spoiler alert: God appears to Moses as a young boy.  Moses trains an army while the Israelites are still slaves.  Said army burns Egypt's grain supply.  The Israelites cross the Red Sea at low tide.  There is much more.  Even if you take this movie as nothing but fiction, it's just not a good movie.  I was  disappointed in Christian Bale's performance.  His accent keeps changing, as though he can't figure out which one he wants to use.  There are some ridiculous plot points and inconsistencies from scene to scene.

The battle was an historic event, but I doubt Moses was one of the generals leading the battle. I knew a lot of liberties were going to be taken, but I didn't expect it to be this bad. I need to pay more attention to what people are saying about a movie. The worst part was representing the God of the Universe -- who created everything from the human cell to Canis Majoris -- as a petulant child with the emotional maturity of an 11-year-old boy. Sickening. I'm boycotting secular Hollywood movies from now on, especially ones based on the Bible. They can't be faithful to scripture.

This is Ridley Scotts version/vision of that period of time in the bible about Moses and Ramses, and freeing the Hebrews from bondage. There is no foul language anywhere in this movie, which now a days is almost unheard of.  The PG-13 rating is for the intense plague scenes. The CGI effects are very good, the battle scenes are great,  but like a few others I was not impressed with the image of God as a little boy, but as I said this is one directors version against another's. There are other things that happen or don't happen and characters that are different than in the original, but all in all I liked this movie even with the different visions the directors had.

6885208,3,B00QUFHWMS,"I truly lament the loss of Tony Scott. Together as a team, the Scott Brothers Ridley and Tony were the best, because, among their covie-making genius was effected through their attention to historical details essential to the story they were telling. The cinematography, the acting, the special effects were all superb, and necessary to the tale, but so is God and the special relationship of the ancient Hebrews, who began the greatest Theology and Religion on earth, through Abraham, Jacob, Isaac and Moses.

I was hoping for better, but the hallmark for the story of Moses remains that of Cecil B. De Mill's Ten Commandments, which portrays the Exodus as closely in accordance to the 5 Books of Moses, of the Old Testament as one could expect in a movie.

Our Living God revealed to the ancient Hebrews, aspects of his image, the only ones that we have. They are: Reason ( the logos; the word); Life; Love; Light  (energy) all of which are essential to man, and which makes this story the most important one beside the Teachings of Jesus Christ, who remarkably includes the best of Judaism in his ministry.

There is no Reason; No Life; No Love; and No Light without God. For example, if God is Love; should that not mean that there is no Evil in Love? Beyond these aspects, we do not know much more about God, except for the prescriptions of Moses and other Prophets and inspired teachers (Rabbis), throughout history.

Moses takes from God, the Ten Commandments, which are the prescribed way of behavior necessary to Love our Neighbours as we are commanded,and in this establishes that How we behave, is more important than what we believe.

For me, although the movie illustrates the dramas of the plagues, the escape of the Hebrews into the wilderness and the destruction of Pharaoh Ramses II's forces; it otherwise does not present very well,the really important lessons to mankind, imparted by God through Moses, that one's good behavior with one's fellows, and living things in general; in the most moral way, to achieve the best possible outcomes is necessary.

From the Ten Commandments emanates this foundation upon which the super structures of the theologies of 'The Book' are developed, with the inspired having written 673 protocols of behavior throughout the Old Testament.

When in doubt stick with the facts not scientific assumptions; not everything can be explained away by logic and science).  Aside from the cliche, ""god child,"" thesis that makes no sense the rest of the film was actually pretty good.

The Red Sea special effects would have been more awesome had they made it where they walked on dry land.  The water walls formed as Moses put his staff in the water.

If you are looking for something that is 100% biblically accurate, this is not the movie for you. I'm not sure why this film received such poor reviews but my personal opinion is that the purist Christians don't like it because its not completely true to the Bible, and non-christians don't like it because it is somewhat based on a book in the Bible.

In the scenes leading up to the ""parting of the Red Sea,"" Moses finally humbles himself enough to beg for guidance  but the God-child is absent and uncaring.

Then, there is no ""parting"" of the sea; a disillusioned Moses throws his Egyptian sword into the surf. (One of many departures from the biblical history.) The next morning, there's a sort of LOW TIDE; nothing miraculous or even impressive about it. So, the Jews slosh their way across. What was this scene titled in the script  ""The Hebrews Go Wading""? Moses shouts, ""Follow ME, and you will be free!""  Not ""follow God,"" you understand. The approach is entirely secular: They're following the Bearded Wonder, not anything spiritual. ... The addition of heroic music, as they splash across, only points out how mundane is the scene itself.

Later, Moses gets to chisel out the Commandment Tablets himself... looking a bit frazzled and delusional, which we are allowed (or encouraged) to think he might be. The laws set forth are not described. He is not shown delivering them to his people. They are not shown reaching the promised land. What exactly IS the point of this movie? If it was to persuade viewers toward a secular view of events, wasn't there a more exciting way to do this?

There is nothing majestic, or magical, or biblical, about this story, the way it's told here. As a non-Christian I could have lived with that  but it was BORING. Some reviewers have applauded the special effects. What special effects? Blowing sand? Vast matte backdrops? Brief cameos by frogs and locusts?

Here is my question for Hollywood: Had this been the Muslim story of Mohammed, would it have been as thoroughly gutted as this one was? I doubt it; that would not have been Politically Correct in the present climate. (It would also have been  as we all know  exceedingly dangerous.)",1428192000,4,2414,4.7214285714285715

6885398,5,B00QUFHWMS,"The American Christian Right doesn't like this movie because it doesn't portray God as magical enough nor is the Exodus of the Jews from Egypt portrayed as a Hollywood interior sound stage dance hall production, as it is in the 10 Commandments. Instead Ripley Scott's version looks and feels like ancient Egypt. Another welcome aspect is that the Jewish people are portrayed as working with God in obtaining their own liberation.  Isn't that what we really believe: That God helps those who help themselves?  Don't we really believe that our own effort is required in working God's will?  That's what you see in this film.  The plagues are presented as possibly having natural causes directed by God.  Again, isn't that what most of us really believe?  What really inflames the religious is that God speaks to Moses as a child. And who is more godlike among us than a child who still has the innocence not to be caught up in bigotry.  Ripley Scott makes the Exodus story plausible and real; something we can believe in more than a fairytale version. What the Christian Right wants is irrational implausible improbable magic. To be so wedded to superstitious magic in the 21st century is disturbing. Watch Ripley Scott's Exodus and see a great movie that you can almost believe.",1428192000,3,1277,4.830275229357798

I am religious, a catholic, but I am also extremely interested in the art of cinema. Using this stand point I will try to make the most honest review you will read, not bias in any form.
First after researching about this movie the writers, producers and director decided to go on a HISTORICALLY accurate version, not a BIBLICALLY accurate version. So please ignore all the 1 star reviews saying its blasphemous and not accurate.
As a piece of cinema art this was a great movie, the way it was created and carried out was really crafty and cool! Its amazing that Scott could actually take one set and transform it into 9 different sets within 10 minutes. The costume design was terrific and of course the acting was extremely good. As with all Ridley Scott movies the cinematography was inspiring.
Over all this movie, for the sake of history and art was very well done, no matter what the reviews rant about. I would say it would be worth at least renting it if you are unsure about it. Again I am a practicing Catholic, and my family is as well, some are even part of the church (preacher, deacon, etc), and all of them liked it over all.

But we decided to watch it as a family, and maybe it was just because I had such low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. No, it is not completely biblically, or historically accurate, but have you ever seen a Ridley Scott film that was?  He's not doing a documentary here, but like Gladiator, it's got great eye candy in terms of special effects, good fight scenes, and generally good performances.  My biggest annoyance with the movie was that sometimes I couldn't hear the actors, namely Moses (Christian Bale), very well or clearly, even though we had our surround sound on and up pretty high. We are a Christian family, but the liberties Scott takes did not bother me, and made for great discussion with our kids afterwards. My son even went and got out his bible to read about the plagues and parting of the Red Sea. I didn't think Moses came across as mentally ill either as some have said here. He came across to me as someone struggling with God, just like he does in the bible. I would have liked to see more Aaron, Joshua and Miriam in the movie, but otherwise, thought it was pretty good.

The character arc of Moses portrayed in this version made no sense. And Christian Bale portrayed the role as if he wasn't even sure who this Moses character was supposed to be. Christian Bale is a great actor, which leads me to believe the direction he got from Ridley Scott and the script must have been extremely poor. I don't often see Christian Bale botch a performance like he did in this movie. Its a shame, because there is obviously a market for the telling of biblical stories.

Bale seemed mechanical, ready to leave the scene, wanting it all to be over with -- PRONTO.  I'll say the same thing of the other actors who, at best, came across to me as stiff, carton-like.  On the other hand, the costumes, props and photography were exceptional and kept me in my seat.  The HD is spectacular!  Although this new take on the Bible Story is very good and timely, something went wrong with the acting and script.

I grew up in a Christian church and loved every minute of it, but I could never believe any of the supernatural stuff.

I am so sick of Christians getting on their high horses telling us what the Bible says and doesn't say.  They believe every word from ancient writings that were compiled over 17 centuries ago.  Translated throughout all the centuries, all subject to human error and personal agenda.

Christians want to believe in the Bible because it makes them feel they have all the answers to life.

Without spoiling too much for anyone, the core is intact but the overall story doesn't follow the bible. But that is to be expected.

6885611,5,B00QUFHWMS,"The following review comes from both secular and a relgious point of view.
Please bear with me.
As a child I read the bible. I went to catholic school and did my first communion. In my home we prayed before every meal and avidly spoke about the bible and its teachings and at night we read from the good book. My dad for many years was a missionary in Mexico and in Africa. We sang in the church choir and generally where very involved in all things related to our faith.
The issue with me is that even while my involvement in the faith was steadfast, I had questions, and many tales are not made clear. Dates and times of events are as ambiguous as our God.
As an adult I grew tired of the age old answer to all our questions: ""You have to have faith.""

I am skeptic enough now, as an adult that I shun that answer; however the teachings are rock solid. The tales (although science will tell us otherwise) are wise, the parables make sense, especially in todays world.

All this being said, I understand that NO religious movie would ever satiate the whole of the religious body. There are simply too many variables. Some are more fanatical than others, some are less, some take the words of the bible as doctrine and not stories, some see the stories as just that, and not a way of life. There is simply no denying that one cannot make one interpretation of a bible story, especially one as well-known as Exodus to appease the masses.

That being said...

This version of the Exodus story is one of the best interpretations Ive ever seen. In a world where reason has taken over for blind faith this movie is a fantastic representation of those events.
Furthermore, it answers in me questions I had as a child that the tried and true reply of ""have faith"" simply couldn't answer.

How could Moses lead his people out of Egypt? I think of myself, a man. Would I be able to walk into Egypt and tell Pharaoh? ""Let mu people go"" and then simply walk out? No. Even with the grace of God all around me. I am fallible that way. Moses, like me did not have a covenant with God, he did not know God and was acting on blind faith, perhaps madness.
This movie explains that Moses was a man of action, which he would have been (most likely) if he was raised with his step-brother Ramses.

This would explain a ton of things. This is a man, that I can understand much better, than a shepherd, told to go to the mecca of the known world (at the time), to a place where he was exiled from and start making demands.

Even the plagues and how and why they happened and the consequences thereafter are explained much better.
No movie is perfect, and this one is no exception. However in the hands of Ridley Scott this is a modern day master piece.

Some creative license must be taken if this story is to make sense to not only Catholics and believers such as myself, but to secular folks that may have a passing interest in the matter.

The production is fantastic. The direction is without equal and the acting is spot on. You will be entertained. You will have a good time and at the very least you can take what is presented, then go back to the subject matter and find out more. I see nothing wrong with that. Its a win/win for everyone.

Please, sit back and enjoy the movie. A movie that was dedicated to the directors deceased brother was made with much love and was shared with the entire world.",1427932800,5,3387,4.3196850393700785
6885612,3,B00QUFHWMS,"this movie only gets three stars because it has very good 3d in it.  the 3d version is much better than the flat 2d version by a long shot.  I would say ""Noah' 3d also was superior to the flat version as well.  You have to buy a europeon version of Noah to get the 3d version.  This one however has a 3d version in this package.  Now for the not so good part. The movie is rather bad and weak in many ways.  Moses is not a zealot here for his people , he doesn't directly confront pharaoh ,  as it is depicted in the bible.  God is a weird kid who needs spanking !  Why they allowed someone who is a atheist to make this story is beyond me.  The acting is good because this film has Excellent actors in it.  Top rated ones but they can't save this movie.  Even the parting of the sea of reeds.  NOT the RED SEA.  has not enough punch in it.  This film could have been as exciting as the great earlier versions if they stayed to the story and didn't try to interject today's mores into a older story.  The Hebrews NEVER believed in thou shall not kill. it said ""THOU SHALT NOT MURDER""  , they didn't hesitate to wipe out whole cities a few years later.  Back then when you invaded tribally you wiped out the enemy and took all of  it's land.  Only strong states tried to take territory and people.  Anyways. This movie in spite of the actors and good 3d is simply rather limp.  NOAH. was very exciting and wild and had great 3d. Although on a  lets stick to the bible level it was very flawed like this one too. But you could forgive it because it was relentless and exciting.  Not so this one.

Yet it was greatly executed, fantastic scenes, great CGI, great acting, no one but God and those who lived in those times know exactly what happened...but for now, we enjoy the power of the Divine execute his will over a nation to utter destruction, the miracles told by the ancients, and the faith it can continue to inspire in all of us. And the next time He says...""Set my people free"" do me favor....listen to the Great I Am.....",1427846400,,1173,4.3807339449541285
6885720,3,B00QUFHWMS,"Most of you know this is Ridley Scott's epic update of ""The Ten Commandments"" for modern times. Scott is well known for his sweeping and exotic visual films (""Alien,"" ""Gladiator,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""Thelma and Louise"") that fill the screen with sets and lighting and smoke and ""lights flaring in a camera lens"" action that leave no blank space for the eye to fall upon and take a rest from all the candy it can crave. ""Gods and Kings"" is perhaps the most visually stunning view of ancient Egypt under a Pharaoh that has been brought to the screen since ""Cleopatra"" and that may be it's biggest problem.

Scott spares no effort in pylons and pillars and pyramids and certainly not in the plagues to fall upon Egypt when Ramses refuses to free the Hebrew slaves. There are so many locusts and frogs and flies and maggots visible it is sometimes hard to see the sets they are filling. And they seem endless - so endless - that there is little time for the main characters (unlike Cecil B. DeMille's Technicolor epic, ""The Ten Commandments"") who seem to arrive to film a scene a few minutes before the next plague strikes. Bale's Moses does not go to Pharaoh between plagues as in DeMille's story. God has told him to sit back and watch how God handles Pharaoh instead of his own attempts to turn the Hebrew slaves into an army.

There is nothing wrong with the performances of the actors. Christian Bale plays Moses as a man tormented by a hidden past and gets even more twisted after discovering his true family is Hebrew, but he's not as ""crazy"" as early reviews seem to have implied, nor as irreverent toward God's instructions, just very questioning about his method to free the slaves vs. God's plans to do it. And he is even more leery since God is portrayed as a young boy - with a firm and angry temper - who seems to enjoy posing more riddles than explaining exactly what He wants from Moses. Using a boy as God is an interesting idea by Scott, since when Bale's character meets him, he has been exiled from Egypt and has a 9 year old boy of his own whom he loves very much and in some moments of confusion seems to see as the boy who came to him as God before his vision clears.

Joel Edgerton is a more than adequate Ramses, though I must confess his makeup kept reminding me of Leonardo DeCaprio. Having lost his brother Moses after discovering his Hebrew heritage (mostly at the request of his mother Tuya - Sigourney Weaver in a very small bit part, who wants Moses dead instead of exiled) he is as tormented as Bale's character because of his desire for the power of Egypt, but still wishing Moses was at his side as advisor to Egypt.

Great performances indeed, and not nearly enough of them. They seem to be thrown in only as a prelude to get to the visuals and based on the assumption we don't need character development to get to the next special effect (which are excellent). Speaking of visuals, the parting of the Red Sea in ""Gods and Kings"" is not to be missed. Not so much the drying up of the seabed which is very tame as the water leaves slowly while the Hebrews stand on the shore, but in it's return with behemoth tidal wave force as Moses and Ramses face off - Moses on his horse, and Ramses in his chariot - on the moist seabed bottom as it approaches.

 ""Gods and Kings"" is worth watching for Scott's direction, the all too brief performances of the actors, and the story told in modern visually epic form, but don't expect DeMille's classic film which is much more rounded in both characters and visuals.",1427846400,,3531,4.432973805855162

Mr. Scott phoned this one in, I feel. I was sorely disappointed after watching this, but decided to take it as a purely secular, atheistic entertainment piece, much like the equally non-biblical Noah...uggg!

The acting in this Ridley Scott version was indifferent. Much of the costuming appeared to be drawn from comic opera rather than what we see on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs and monuments. Yul Brynner looked and acted like a real Pharaoh Rameses II in DeMille's ""Ten Commandments"" whereas Joel Edgerton looked like he would be more comfortable in a bikie film rather than playing an Egyptian pharaoh. In the early scenes, Moses looked like someone transposed from a medieval film rather than an Egyptian prince.

3. If anyone sees dirt on anything, especially clothing, let me know, and what was the location of this epic?
4. Dialogue in which everyone sounded like 21st century middle class college speak.
5. Special effects (just one example): The tornados (well, waterspouts) looked straight out of Sharknado cheap special effects. If you haven't seen Sharknado good for you - forget B or D level movies they are at the end of the alphabet (and beyond). OK, worth watching if desperate for laughs.

6885939,2,B00QUFHWMS,"It's a handsome movie. But it's neither epic, nor deep. Feels more like Moses went on to surf the sand and sea, and all the deeper issues are glossed over, be it issues of faith, inner torment and doubt or the question of slavery. To start with the least of offenses, the bleak and ashy filter used here covers over all the beauty and glory of costumes, and leads us to believe that Egypt was a country of grey instead of magnificent colors and art. It never benefits from the high-end production in visual domain.

Characters are cardboard cutouts and their motivations never go any deeper from a petulant childish drama. Not a single issue is really shown, it's rather bluntly told at you. And it's been a long while since we had this blatant case of black face. Not to mention a complete mess of weird accents. This is pretty much an abuse of immense acting talent at the disposal here. Please, Hollywood, could you try and cast people who at least resemble the nations you are trying to depict?
Story feels like a readers digest of one of the most poignant stories from the Bible, one so deeply ingrained into western culture that it probably shapes us all in one way or another. And even like that, it jumps all over the place, so even knowing it well won't be enough to follow. In the end, we don't see any suffering, either personal or on a level of the nation that should be a driving force here, not to mention the complete failure at making a point out of the doubt-faith complete. This one doesn't go deeper than the decision of what to wear tonight, it feels.

Not a bible movie, not an epic journey of one man, not a historic journey of a nation, it all leads to couple of formulaic battle scenes that accomplish what?  In the end, this movie is somewhat offensive in terms of intelligence, faith and most of all, race.",1427587200,,1832,4.43026706231454

There's a passage in the Old Testament where Moses ask to see The Almighty's face and was told ""no man shall see my face and live."" The Israelites were known to be monotheistic, only serving one God and forbidden to worship or have anything to do with idols or home made gods.  That was the main reason The Almighty had his voice coming from the burning bush, and Moses saw no being.  Ripley showing a boy as The Almighty is an insult to all, showing a total lack of respect, lack of facts and total disregard to beliefs and values that millions hold dear.",1427587200,,848,4.3949044585987265

Too many things left out and it's almost as-if they thought they could just 'mention' things they did not show and you would get an understanding. For example, they never show the king and moses as kids (it just ""says"" that they were like brothers). So you miss much of the bond that could have been felt by the viewers if moments like that had been shown. Instead, it is just mentioned that they were like brothers but nothing in this movie gives you that feeling of them being close. Soo many other things were done in a similar way. I mean, we are supposed to know that they were close, just because the king refused to kill moses when a snitch found out that he was really a Hebrew? Come on! And also the part about Moses deciding to go to some city on behalf of the king and the leader of that community just 'telling moses' that he was set in a mainjer and the queen finds it - all of this was just 'said' not shown, and they expect us to believe it. Also the part where some 'kid' is speaking to moses as God? No way, and that someone was able it let ""us know"" that the kid was not real simply by showing moses talking to himself through that someone's eyes? The whole movie sucked and it made me just want to go and find the 'Ten Commandments' movie to un-traumatize my watching this movie.",1427587200,3,1386,4.214285714285714

6885970,4,B00QUFHWMS,"Wow!  To say that reviewers are polarized on this film would be an understatement.  It is easy to see why people that expected Bible-bound accuracy would have been disappointed; Ridley Scott departs from the traditional story in many ways.  Not quite so easy to understand why others say that the movie ""has no soul"" or is boring or is ""poorly written.""  I can definitely understand that some viewers found the movie to be truncated in some elements of the story since I also found that a few were jarringly and abruptly introduced and quickly terminated.  Perhaps a ""directors' cut"" will eventually surface and solve this problem with additional footage.  For me, just seeing the glorious depiction of ancient Egypt was almost enough to bring out the five stars review.  The costuming, sets and props are excellent representations of Pharaonic Egypt as I have imagined it from the archaeology I have studied.  I was struck by how human the Pharaoh Ramesses II was depicted and how Moses was perplexed by developments and his role as the chosen of God, as well he must have been.  The effects are excellent even though they seem, on occasion, to waffle between a secular approach and a Biblical representation.  (the parting of the Red Sea, for instance).  And this brings me to the depiction of God as a child.  I thought this odd.  Some viewers were outraged.  I accepted that God could appear to Moses in any form he wished and a child is not beyond imagining. It would not have been my choice but it was not a deal-breaker for me.  I was not put-off by the fact that Ridley Scott did not follow the letter of the Bible in this film.  To secularists it is too religious and to the religious it is too secularized.  I say, loosen up, folks.  The movie, despite comments to the contrary, is not boring and it does not make a mockery of the Biblical story. The characters seem real and approachable.  Pharaoh grieves for his son; Moses is reluctant to accept his task as leader of the Hebrews. This movie has faults, it is true but in my opinion it is worthwhile and enjoyable.  I can't in all honesty give it five stars but it is a solid four star film.  Add another half-hour or so of equally as good content to fill in the truncated portions and it would be even better . . . 5 stars?  Maybe.",1427587200,,2295,4.519417475728155

Well, well, well..

1st let me say, I was dying to see this movie. I looked at the preview and was like I just have to see it.

However, having been raised catholic and weekly religious instructions, raised on Charleton Heston, this was sooo much better. I liked the variance on the main character, made him far more likeable in my view. Also, 'god' (I believe the child was supposed to be the god-mouthpiece) was sort of a comical and slightly less evil force than otherwise would be. More childlike (which is actually pretty close to accurate, come to think of it ;-) ) stomping his foot, insisting on humbling the Egyptians. If one were a clear-thinking person, one would realise that a god that could do all of these things, could simply kill the Egyptians and free 'his' people.

6886091,1,B00QUFHWMS,This movie is nothing but one lie of the devil after another. It would take me hours to tell you how many things in it was wrong. This is not a bible story. This is man made fiction. It was written to try to make people doubt the bible. Any christian that has a relationship with God will not even begin to listen to this hog wash! Don't waste your money. Buy the 10 commandments with Charleston Heston in it by Cecil B. DeMille. It is the only good movie on what really happened back then!!!,1427414400,,492,4.135416666666667

6886106,2,B00QUFHWMS,To movie itself was well done but I think the producer should have change the name of the movie if he was planning on changing things around instead of sticking to the truth as it is written in the bible. People can be very sensitive about there faith and I guess I was a little offended. The passion of the Christ by Mel Gibson made the bible come alive and he stuck with the truth as written but this producer change the scene to what he wanted it to be not how history books foretold the store of Moses. Then they choose to have God as a little boy which was very insulting they should have just stuck to the burning bush the bible teaches us that we walk by our faith its more of a spiritual connection so the movie was way off from the truth I didn't even finish the movie. God is like the wind...you cant see the wind but you see the effects of the wind..you see how it moves the trees and blow through your hair..The just shall walk by faith not by sight,1427414400,,961,4.08994708994709

Oh wait they do, the two movies are called Exodus and Noah, both movies could have easily been titled anything else. For the critics who told the public Exodus was the greatest religious movie ever made perhaps renting the Ten Commandments or Ben Hur would have allowed that person a legitimate opinion on that subject.  Folks if you'll looking for great special effects or you simply have 2 or 3 hours to kill please rent the movie, but if you're hoping for a religious based movie that is made with all the great Hollywood effects so that the wonders of God could be shown to the world this isn't it.

The special effects were good, nicely understated, and the actor who plays Pharaoh Ramses actually does a better job than Bale. In this depiction, Moses appears not only reluctant, which scripture supports, but bumbling in everything except fighting and killing. In this movie, I in particularly did not like the way Yhvh's role was minimized. Moses' loyalty to his family was also well played.

In fact, one wonders why they are in it?  Why any actors, famous or not, agreed to be in this waste of time?  My goodness.  None of the things that happened during the Exodus, happened in order in this movie.  The scenes were disjointed and confusing and made no sense.  There was no logical flow to the storyline.  Things happened that weren't mentioned in the Bible, like tornadoes when crossing the Red Sea?  I looked at my husband and said ""now I KNOW that didn't happen!"" and proceeded to pull out my Bible and look it up.  When Moses was seen carving the Ten Commandments himself, once again I had to do a little fact checking.  Nope, Moses didn't write the Commandments himself in the Bible.  God did it and then gave the tablets to Moses.  And who was that smart ass little kid that kept showing up and throwing out statements?  God sure seemed to be having a tantrum in that little kid.

I actually wanted the film to end quickly to get my money's worth, but it did not. I found the film excessively long.

The blatant, seemingly intentional deviation from the Genesis account was disturbing and disrespectful to God. The most outrageous change was the depiction of God as a snotty, spiteful little boy.
While there are many more changes to the story that make it disheartening to watch, suffice it to say Ridley Scotts's rendition of the Exodus story does not even capture the heart of the story. It is a movie made by those who do not know God nor understand the sacredness of scripture.

6886622,4,B00QUFHWMS,"I found this bizarre movie both very entertaining and yet poorly scripted in some parts and a rather disjointed historical trail.  The cast was good
except for Ramses who just did not seem to fit the role well (the actor).  And no one in the court would (or could) address him by his personal name:
he would be Pharaoh to his underlings, except perhaps to his wife(s),  Ramses was the greatest of Kings and ruled for 67 years; not a failure this
guy and he birthed 90 kids.  No King before or after had his successes as he did.  It is not even certain that he was the King of the Exodus!  Still, there was some good moments.  The scenes with the plagues was very good, and very creepy!  And the parting of the Red Sea
(the Sea of Reeds?) was interesting though  all the Kings men were killed except the King! and of course Moses,  I found the portrayal of
God as a child a bit weird but imaginative and yes, there was a burning bush for some reason.  I was almost wondering if I was going to
see Pinky and the Brain by the bush!!  And why was Moses up to his neck in a mud puddle?  Anyhow, he did what God told him and rescued
the Hebrews and led them to the mountain (after the Sea thing) and carved the Ten Commandments himself which seemed to be kind
of a slap at the Bible.  Anyway, the ending rushes along as if the producers wanted to end this ""masterpiece"" and go home.  Watch for
the Tornadoes at the parting of the Sea...rather interesting twist I thought.  The music lacked the majesty of the DeMille Version and also
was much less reverential.  Still, It was entertaining (at times) and I  think worth watching.  I got my DVD set from Amazon; and I gave
it four Stars despite its obvious laws.

The movie had its high moments: the beautifully executed effects of the Plagues, and the parting of the ""Red"" sea or perhaps the Sea of Reeds as
many scholars believe was where the crossing was made.  When Moses fled from Egypt he wandered in the wilderness (Goshen?) for 40 years and
no doubt new the risings and lowerings of the Sea due to the tides.  But the effects were terrific though how he and Ramses survived the crushing
waters at the closing of the Sea.  I loved the tornado effects; very grand.  We hear little of Nefateri who he was going to  marry (in CBD's Ten
Comandments) and I got confused by some of the other named Hebrews such as Joshua who I think was the one spying on Moses whilst he talked
to God or Gods representative, appearing as a small boy (with a British accent don't you know!).  I liked the Burning bush scene though it seemed a
bit out of place when God or his rep (I AM) was standing right there next to Moses (in the mud pit).  The partial destruction of Ramses chariot army
(falling off a cliff!) was neat, and the Egyptian sets were quite good, except for the pyramid being built:  The pyramid age had passed a 1000 years
earlier; by 1300 BC (NOT BCE!!!) though perhaps a few small ones were built for rich individuals.  And some of the huge statues littering downtown
Memphis (not Tennessee) never existed like that;  I know a great deal about ancient Egyptian Art, Architecture and other stuff and I watch very
carefully the smallest of details.  The Gladiator director (who did this film) did the same thing in the movie;  oversized the Roman temples and such.
While the build up to the ending was good, I thought they curtailed the end a bit too soon.  And I did not like seeing Moses cutting the Ten
Commandment Tablets himself; it seemed kind of  cheap you know.  And no Golden Calf and a nasty E. G. Robinson to get his come-up-pence.
A much better musical soundtrack would have helped.  Spectacles like this need to have a more uplifting spirit to it but I was glad to see Moses
re-united with his wife and kid.  But they never showed what happened to Moses but then that is a story for another time.  I give this movie 4 STARS, not because I think it is a great movie, which it is not, but they (the producers) tried, I think, to make the story of Moses a bit more earthy
and less mystical and explain some things that happened as natural scientific happenings and not necessarily an act of God.  They never, however,
explained away the Angel of Death  that killed Ramses kid (He would have 89 more!.)  I think this is a interesting and entertaining film and if you
like sword and sandal flicks with action and good special effects then you should see this.  This film does not stress God or religion as much as
the Great Cecil B. did in the TEN COMMANDMENTS but I still recommend it.  I  got mine from Amazon.  I do recommend you stay away from
mud holes, burning bushes and little kid smartypants.  The kid may just be MR BIG!!  Enjoy!",1427328000,,4691,4.345224395857307

It was quite annoying...really. Moses and Ramses almost meeting together as the Red Sea was closing in...everyone dies except the two of them...and they were in the center?!  God being represented in this film as a little boy with an attitude. SMH. Visuals and music were good. Acting was also good.  But the deviation from the original story kills this interpretation.

Really? Points for creativity but it was just laughable. That part made it feel a little Sy-Fy channel cheezy.). Um. Moses's staff was a sword in this movie. The voice of God in the burning bush was not a voice, but instead a creepy and seemingly angry little boy that talked to Moses (who, by the way, was buried at the time, all except for his face, in a mudslide!) The boy was supposed to be God's voice at any time that God spoke to Moses. Even when he was carving the 10 Commandments into the stone tablets, the kid was there, walking around and talking to him. I was so excited when I saw the previews for this, but wow. Big let down.

I love Bale and I think he did a superb job, but when you know the actual Biblical account, this one is just horrible.  I understand that it is Hollywood, but if you're going to make a movie based on a Biblical story, at least make it somewhat accurate.  The portrayal of a god who can deliver his people through plagues and a parting of the enormous Red Sea, should not be portrayed as a tantrum throwing, vindictive, bratty child.  It was completely insulting to me.  I did like the special effects showing the plagues though.

I don't believe the director even read the bible story of the Exodus before making this movie because this movie definitely has no relationship to Exodus. God seems hateful, as well as Moses. You actually feel sympathetic to the Egyptians instead of the Hebrews. There is no truth to this story and no fear of God in how the story was told. I was actually offended at this effort at presenting the Exodus. The Bible says Moses was the most humble man that has ever lived. Christian Bale had no resemblance to that. Moses also loved God and did what he wanted, though he didn't think he would be able to handle it which is understandable because it was a difficult job. I feel like my faith as well as God, more importantly, was totally disrespected. Oh, and the Hebrews were NOT violent. There was no violence against the Egyptians from the Hebrews. By the end the Egyptians were even willing to give them their gold because of the respect they had for them. Watch the 10 Commandments, the Prince of Egypt or better yet read the Bible if you want a more biblical account of the Exodus.",1427241600,15,1249,4.387931034482759

Edit: I forgot to add, there is an assumption that you at least know the basic story of Exodus such as the seven plagues and such. If not, this movie moves through the story of Exodus at a fast pace without stopping to explain every last detail that would have made this movie four hours long and absolutely boring. That being said I think most people, even the atheist know enough about the story to get by. For the people who gave one star for the movie not being ""religious"" enough, I suggest taking a step back and take a moment to reflect. The whole darn movie is about Exodus. Some people also had an issue with the portrayal of God as a boy. First off, some how a talking burning bush is rational but presenting himself through human form is not? Second and far more important is that about 3/4th of the way through the movie it is stated that the boy is not god but is just his messenger.",1427241600,,1046,4.235

It did inspire me to re-read the story of Moses in Exodus to refresh my memory of the details of what actually happened.  Would have been more epic in my opinion to re-film the 10 Commandments with modern special effects.,1427241600,3,517,4.375

The story felt like it was rushed, and skipped, and for a Moses Bible Epic, it wasn't so epic; more like it was trying to be a boring epic that made you want to snooze into an epic nap. From that epic nap I then woke up from the special effects. Yes, it was the only good part about this movie, but that didn't stop me from closing my eyes again.

However I give the movie a 1 star rating mostly because there was no need to twist the story that much and for the very great misportrayal of God. It would be nice if for once a person who actually understands the character and nature of God portrayed Him correctly in films, instead of always leaning towards an angry murderous and vengeful being that delights in destroying others without giving reason for it (and in this case portrayed through a spiteful child no less).

Wether you believe in God or not, think about it this way...

From a theological point of view, yeah, some details were a little different than how Genesis tells it but all the important elements were there.

It didn't end exactly how I would have ended it but it completely illustrated the close relationship that they had and that's the real point.

But what in the world happened here?!?!?!? How could you take such rich material which is like a crystal clear glass of water and just throw in a dirty sock and try to ask us to drink it?!??
First off there is literally no chemistry with any of the actors. They all look disinterested to be there. All except Christian Bale who must have been scratching his head asking himself, what did I get myself into with this film?
I could not pick one scene where you could feel any passion or emotion for anything that was going on. It was like a choppy film, filled with random scenes.
In a lot of ways I feel it may not be the fault of the actors, but rather the dialogue and script itself that is to blame.
But now, lets get into why I couldn't even finish watching the film.
God is a child?!?!?? At first I started laughing, but later felt like they were crossing the line with their artistic license here.
I let the first couple of scenes slide where God is represented or symbolized by this child. But afterwards, when Bale is arguing with this child and they begin to go back and forth it sounded like a father and son arguing at the breakfast table about why he should go to school that day.
I couldn't take it seriously and found it to be utterly ridiculous. I don't think you have to be a Bible Scholar to realize that this is waaaaaayyyyyyyy out there in its interpretation of the Bible canon.
I was really hoping for something special with this film. But walked away disappointed and completely let down.
About half way through the film I asked myself, why am I watching this film again? To be entertained.but Im not being entertained. Im drinking a cup of crystal clear water but with a dirty sock in it. EnoughI turned off the movie.",1427155200,3,1879,4.371428571428571

6886934,4,B00QUFHWMS,I enjoyed this film. I really felt as though I was in ancient Egypt. The acting and direction were fine. The problem was that 1. Jehovah God was depicted as a child and 2. The part in the Bible where Moses and Pharaoh go back and forth over Pharaoh letting the Israelites go was cut out of the story. This is a vital part of the story. In this film the plagues were unleashed without warning. This made no sense and it made God look like an evil God. The plagues were unleashed because Pharaoh refused to let the Israelites go. In the film Moses only met with Pharaoh before the last plague. The special FXs were great. This version of the Exodus was very entertaining but the Ten Commandments (1956) was better.

6886963,3,B00QUFHWMS,"This was definitely view-able and moving.  Now to what extent it is depends on what the viewer's expectations are, I suppose.  When I saw Ridley Scott using Anglo Saxsons (lol) trying to pass as Egyptians, I pretty much wrote it off and had horrible expectations.  I only decided to watch this because a friend had it streaming and I didn't have to pay for it.

You know, it wasn't that bad!  While the casting was off, they still had very strong actors in the likes of Christian Bale, Joel Edgarton and others.  They were able to bring life to the characters well enough that it was entertaining.  The special effects were great.  The telling of the story was a bit more down to earth than the Charlton Heston version (though I LOVE the Charlton Heston version like it's nobody's business -- yes, back in the day they ""white-washed"" the characters as well, but you'd expect that back then... not in today's day and age).

I think Exodus Gods and Kings is worth seeing.  Having said that, I am upset that Ridley Scott and his casting director couldn't find a few good looking, talented Egyptian, Arabian, Iranian (or even Indians from Bollywood for that matter!) actors and actresses to play Ramses I, Ramses II and the other Egyptians in the court... there is absolutely no excuse for this in 2014/2015...

Whether or not it seems reasonable to compare it to The Ten Commandments I'm not entirely sure because even though the same story is ultimately being told it's being done in a very different way. I would probably need to watch it again and observe more closely some different aspects of the film with a bit more open mind.

6887024,1,B00QUFHWMS,"I had great hopes for this movie based on the cast and the director. The previews are fantastic. The reality is not. This movie would seem to want to target Christians as the main audience the rest of the religious population secondarily due to the special effects and the lack of great blockbusters these days. With that in mind, one expects a movie about a major event and character in biblical history to follow the actual bible and not commit heresy by changing the plot (which if you believe in the bible are supposed to be factual) to fit the whims of what appears to be an athiestic or agnostic story and screen writer.

So, due to the fact that this movie is a complete insult to the bible and God, and insults the Christian faith based on the history that Christians and Jews have believed for thousands of years. I have to ask myself if the actors in this movie are atheists/agnostic in spite of claiming to be Jewish or Christian.

Honestly, the Egyptians may not have worn their eyes w/ liners, it's just the artists could of simply painted black lines under their eyes to keep the art simple. Meaning, it's not like in our modern art world, ancient folks didn't have easy access to paints, their's came from plant dyes or animals, or both. Also, some Mediterrean/Asian descent ppl have such luscious eyelashes, that they naturally look like they have eye liner on. So, in the art of the ancient Egyptians, lines could of been simply used to convey thick eyelashes, not daily make-up.

4 Stars- IF one remembers this is a HOLLYWOOD FICTIONAL VERSION OF EXODUS- then, like of Ridley's Gladiator - you will be entertained! I actual enjoyed it, despite the inaccuracies. It was WAAAAayy better than then Noah version w/ Russell Crowe, that was just a very strange movie. If the director would of called the movie ""Cain,"" I think it would been more accurate. I mean, in the Bible, we don't know what happens to Cain, he just wanders the Earth, so any story would be ok to conjure up.

6887141,4,B00QUFHWMS,"So here we have Ridley's Scott's newest Epic Film about Moses and his Biblical Epic leading 400K Hebrew Slaves out of the tyrannical grasp of Ramses of Memphis, Egypt.  Well, strangely this film got critically panned as missing the mark somewhere, I think I know where, but more on that later.  But anyway, the film is gorgeously filmed, from the set design, costuming, acting, and special effects (Red Sea thing).  Best looking Ancient Egypt rendition in film, I think I've ever seen.  And on a personal note, since playing Total War: ROME II, it's cool to see this region on film this way.

Basically, the story of this film goes something like this...Moses and Ramses are step-brothers who are Egyptian Nobles in Memphis who are also Generals in the army, who fight together as brothers would.  Their dying father, (John Tuturro, Transformers) would like to choose Moses over Ramses as his successor, but because Moses isn't blood relation, he can't.  Ramses takes over and become tyrannical and the Hebrew slave life becomes more brutal.  Just prior to this, Moses learns of his true identity, and starts looking at things a bit differently.  After Ramses takes over, Moses is cast out and he goes on his ""Finding Faith"" journey thru the Sinai Peninsula.  While out there he finds a Bedouin village an he meets a young woman, marries her and settles down and has a child.  Moses climbs the mountain and is confronted by ""God"" and he finds Faith.  Years pass, and all the while the life of the Slaves back at Memphis have become atrocious under the iron fist of Ramses, dozens die by the day and are burned in bonfires.  Moses returns and starts training the slaves to fight back.  The War of Attrition goes too slowly.  So God intervenes and creates all of those ""miracles"" and stuff....the blood red river, the frogs, the locusts and all that..  Because of that Ramses lets Moses take the Hebrews out of Memphis on their journey thru the Sinai.

Well, so where does this film fall flat?  I think where it falls flat is the 9 year time jump while Moses is married and having his son, while all of the crap is going down at Memphis with the Slaves.  Had this film shown more of what was going on there while Moses was out on his walkabout, Moses' return to Memphis would have had more of an emotion impact.  This addition would have probably added at least another half hour or more, and with the film already at 2.5 hours, it'd be a bit much for theatrical releases.  So I'm wondering if we'll ever see a Director's Cut with this film as we did with Kingdom of Heaven.  That's really the only problem I see with this film...this time jump, that had quite a bit to do with the whole plight of the slaves.

Oh, one last thing, before I forget...the religious vs secular take on things.  I'm Catholic, but am one who is akin to believe the more realistic explanation for things rather than some Divine influence.  The Red Sea Parting may be explained by a massive Earthquake off the coast of Italy.  Creating the ocean pull back and subsequent tidal wave much like the 2004 Indonesian Tsunami.  No?  Historians have traced an earthquake back to this time.  As for meeting God on the mountain and stuff?  Take it for what you will.",1426982400,2,3231,4.5881326352530545

Basically, Ridley Scott is working at a whole other level here. And Exodus is every bit as deserving of viewing. He's working here on so many levels at once, obviously visually, but also with the performances of the leads, small parts with great work from John Turturro, Ben Kingsley.

Would have been way better is Ridley had been inspired by Passion of the Christ and at least attempted to make it quasi historically accurate instead of turning Moses into a Gladiator set in Egypt.

Look, they have to add material beyond what Exodus records.  That's understandable and even necessary to tell the story in movie format.  But I don't understand why specifics from the bible - which are no less dramatic - need to be changed.

Moses killed an Egyptian after seeing him abuse a Hebrew (not in self defense in some alley), then he ran (not exiled) for fear of his life.  Moses AND AARON went to Pharaoh between the plagues, presenting God's demands (he didn't show up once with a sword).  Speaking of which... Moses had a staff!  The movie never gave him one.  And that staff turned into a snake (movie never did that).  Not to mention, Moses was in the desert 40 years (not 9).  I could go on...

First, one has to be willing to sit through the depiction of God as a British boy, Moses as a white Englishman and Pharaoh Ramses as an Australian, which is difficult enough when there are plenty of a-list African and African American actors available to attempt some semblance of historical accuracy. Next, you have to be able to stomach a pale, thin, ultra European-looking Sigourney Weaver as an Egyptian princess, and John Turturro (though I'm a huge admirer of his work elsewhere) as Pharaoh Seti.

When everybody knows the story, you gotta make more of an effort to either humanize it with great characters or dazzle with mind-blowing special effects. This didn't do well on either count. Wasn't awful, it was just plodding, peopled with dull characters and no surprises anywhere.

Unless you count Sigourney Weaver looking absolutely mortified to find herself in this movie, with hardly any lines and, in one scene, what looked like an entire peacock on her head. John Turturro as Pharaoh wasn't bad, but it was just such unexpected casting that I laughed every time he came on screen. And it didn't help to have Ramses played by one of the Three Stooges.

Oh, and spoiler alert ahead....

God is an 11 year old boy? Well, at least THAT was unexpected. Weird and entirely nonsensical, but unexpected.

But it is a interesting how there seems to be a trend now -- first Noah and now Exodus -- to remake Biblical movies without... well, without much faith or God. Both movies straddle the believer fence. ""It could have been God's doing.... or Noah and Moses were crazy! Let the audience decide!""

Now, it's not that I'm against secularizing a good story. (I thought Jesus Christ Superstar was BRILLIANT!) But neither of these stories is particularly good without God as an active, equivocated participant. I spent most of the movie on my iPhone, looking up the plagues to make sure the movies was matching what I learned in Sunday school -- or maybe from Charlton Heston. I can't distinguish one from the other anymore.

Mainly the movie just made me want to go watch The Ten Commandments again. Even without today's special effects, it was somehow grander and more spectacular possibly because they committed wholeheartedly, without reservation or hesitation, to the myth (or ""fact"" depending on your point of view.) When that burning bush spoke, by God, you listened!

Yul Brenner will always be the Pharaoh and Chuck will always be Moses, even if I despise how he's used his movie-God status to promote the NRA. I missed Edward G. Robinson sounding like an impersonation of himself in that movie's unintentionally funny casting.

6887320,1,B00QUFHWMS,"Really just cannot allow myself to give this more stars.  Unfortunately, I rented it because the reviews were so split amongst great and terrible.  On the Technical level, Exodus relies far too heavily upon CGI.  I love films full of FX because they give me the ability to escape for a couple of hours, entertain me, usually no heavy handed Hollywood messages.  However, if a film lacks a good script, a solid story and good acting, Hollywood uses FX to ""trick"" the audience.  This is one of those.  Crazy since the cast is so good.
You may ask yourself ""how can one of the worlds most well known & loved stories be portrayed badly?""  The Biblical story of Moses is hardly recognizable in this rendition.  As I said, I don't care for ""message"" movies.  Evidently, the film Noah inspired Ridley Scott & the Hollywood machine to crucify yet another religious story in the crusade of chasing the almighty dollar.  What a load of hooey!  They explain all the miracles as delusions Moses has after slamming his head.  Nice,huh?  Here's a historic & religious person from three of worlds great religions being portrayed as a total lunatic.  So utterly disrespectful.
It's not worth going into all the deviations here but if you're thinking of renting this, save your money & wait until it's out on TV or Prime Amazon.  It's not good for kids.  I'm sad that there isn't more respect in our cultures to allow for diverse beliefs & thoughts.  The story of the Exodus is paramount to the Jewish people, a pillar of understanding for Christians, and so very important for those of Islam.

Edward Longshanks I.....I mean, the Hittites. Even though the Egyptian elite wore make-up,

Moses Wayne eventually suffers a serious concussion from a falling rock, which
consequently causes vivid, nightmarish hallucinations of a petulant, snotty boy
that cannot wait to reign down impressive CGI effects on Egypt. Having seen
""Lake Placid"" one too many times, we're treated to a crocodile feeding frenzy and
other stomach churning events brought about by an adept CGI and make-up team (although
they went a bit too heavy on the tan in a can). After that and many hangings by
Ramses Longshanks II, Bruce Moses leads his warrior tribe out of one section
of the desert into another. Still suffering from a terrible concussion and visions of
an angry Brit boy who had one too many playground beatings, he leads his people
to a sea; one that semi-dries from a low tide and tornadoes. The tornadoes change course,
but unfortunately Longshanks II didn't and him and his team of slave drivers drown

6887378,2,B00QUFHWMS,"Im not entirely sure if Ridley Scott even read the story of Moses and the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt found in the Holy Bible before agreeing to climb behind the camera and direct Exodus: Gods and Kings. Here we have an extremely fallible attempt at re-visiting what Cecil B. DeMille already perfected twice in two different decades with The Ten Commandments. While those movies still took artistic freedoms, they were one hundred times more close to the source material than what we see here.

In ""Exodus: Gods and Kings,"" Egyptian Princes Moses (Christian Bale) and Ramses (Joel Edgerton) are raised together as brothers. When Ramses becomes pharaoh, Moses is his most-trusted adviser. However Moses soon discovers his Hebrew parentage, and Ramses banishes him to the desert -- often a death sentence. But God has a mission for Moses: Free the Israelites from slavery. Moses returns from exile and demands that Ramses let his people go, but the arrogant ruler is unmoved, leading to a battle of divine wills.

I cant believe it took four writers to completely desecrate and butcher what many would consider one of the most vital stories found in the Bible. Even if you consider the Holy Bible just to be another great piece of literature, Exodus: Gods and Kings is a terrible adaptation for the big-screen of what many believe is a cornerstone of their faith and some respect as great fantasy. If Ridley Scott were Chris Columbus, this is his Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief versus Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone as far as imprecise and exact book adaptations go, respectively.

The acting in Exodus: Gods and Kings is all over the place in regards to performances. Christian Bale is completely wasted as Moses. He walks and stands around most of the film acting like a helpless bystander. Every once in a while hell lead a revolt against the Egyptians, but for the most part he just observes Gods spiteful punishment from afar.

John Turturro plays the King of Egypt and does his very best in the dramatic role. However, the entire time I watched him onscreen I kept waiting for him to exclaim, Im very sneaky in a weird accent. Joel Edgertons performance as the Pharaoh Ramses II shows he has the acting chops to take on better big-budget productions than this tripe. Sigourney Weaver floats through her fleeting appearances in the movie as if shes doing Ridley Scott a favor portraying the Queen of Egypt.

I won't deny it was cool seeing the plagues come to life through the use of modern CGI. The alligators ravenously devouring the fisherman and turning the Nile red with their blood is a fun scene to watch. It was also an impressive sight to see all the frogs and locusts invading Egypt and wreaking havoc. The parting of the Red Sea was a bit of a visual disappointment, however. The primitive visual effects from 1956s The Ten Commandments were more stunning than what we got in Exodus: Gods and Kings.

Exodus: Gods and Kings is rated PG-13 for violence including battle sequences and intense images. There are some gory scenes of Egyptians being eaten by alligators and animals throwing up blood. We also see the lifeless bodies of Egyptian children as their parents cry in agony over their deaths, which will be disturbing to some.

A few special features are found on the DVD version of Exodus: Gods and Kings. A featurette entitled 'Exodus: Gods and Kings  Ridleys Epic World goes behind the scenes of the film. Deleted scenes and trailers are also included.

Exodus: Gods and Kings completely belittles its reluctant hero and makes him nothing more than a raving mad bystander instead of the obedient instrument of Gods just rule. On top of that, the once powerful God is whittled down to a spoiled child who is arrogant and prone to venomous temper tantrums. The supernatural plagues found in the scriptures are reduced to natural disasters for the most part, easily explained away by convenient scientific theory. When its all said and done, the entire production is nothing more than a soulless and humanistic attempt at rehashing Cecil B. DeMilles original masterpiece The Ten Commandments.",1426809600,,4152,4.8696883852691215

He just didn't pull off the role of an antagonist worthy to confront Bale's Moses. Yes, the movie is not a play-by-play of the actual Biblical account. It's a movie, people, made to entertain. I know a lot of people didn't like the movie because it didn't follow the bible. And that's o.k., I guess. It just seems that expecting ANY film to be verbatim to any book is a quick way to blind oneself from actually enjoying said film. Of course any 'book' adaptation will 'hollywoodized' to maximize entertainment, etc. I found the story to be quite well-told, without beating people over the head with religious oratory. And I certainly enjoyed the CGI-produced 10 plagues and certainly the parting of the sea scenes. Just watch the movie knowing you are watching a movie meant to entertain and not preach.

But this retelling, in Exodus:  Gods and Kings, is as classic and beautifully directed and told, having captured the same noble, epic history, values and morals as the original.  It is as grand-standing as the original, yet modern technology and Hollywood's penchant for sensationalism did not corrupt the basic tenet of the awe-inspiring greatness of the most world-renown men in ancient Christian history.  I would have given it 5 stars, but didn't care for the way God was portrayed.

I used to love Christian Bale, but lost all favor when I watched his real-life epic, vitriolic melt-down, caught-on-camera, on the set during the filming on one of his movies.  His dynamic performance in this movie and portrayal of Moses is nothing less than awe-inspiring and demanding of respect.  Regardless of what Bale's real-life nature is, one cannot help but find him worthy as a divinely-gifted actor.  His role as Moses has made me forgive and let go of that horrible violent tantrum, and what better way to have done so than to remind us all, by playing one of the Bible's greatest men in Christian history, that we are all prone to sin, yet we are also all divine and working our way back to God.

THIS is how much watching this movie affected me.  And I'm committed to re-reading the Old Testament, so much moved by this incredible movie and performance.

Although the actors chosen were great, they did the best they could with very little dialogue, that in itself is mediocre.

I found this to be a sexist movie: male director, male producers, male writers, and the main characters all male. Too much action and little humanity. Why waste the talent of Sigourney Weaver for just a few lines? Where are the relationshipsbesides the foster brothers? I disliked watching Moses be a general and prepare an army. Seemed too unrealistic. I had to remind myself I wasn't watching Gladiator. I believe the essence of Moses is his similarity to Gandhi, to approach matters as peacefully as possible. I don't see how he had a deep feeling of revenge all of a sudden to leave his family and prepare an army then ""God,"" the child, is trying to convince him to care for the people he didn't grow up with. It's hard to follow someone and see them as a great leader when they are not consistent. Moses is an actualized being and that is the reason his people follow him with loyalty, but if he is still uncertain and doesn't even know who he is, then that would be a lot to risk. I don't mind changing the story a bit, but it would be nice to use some imagination, too many cliche scenes, poor writing, superficial characters, and hardly any leading female parts. I felt nothing when he saw his wife again. They had no relationshiphardly any dialogue. Cecil DeMille's 1956 The Ten Commandments still beats this film without any CGI.

I kept reading reviews advising the same, but I have a policy of always making my own opinions and not just follow thru in watching something that calls my attention as I expected it to be actually be better than those reviews were stating. They were right!. I am NOT that much of a religious person and I can't say that I have read the bible from beginning to end but I am aware of more than just a few books within it.
When you have a reputable good director, producer like Ridley Scott behind the helm of the project you should expect better than what this turned out to be. Christian Bale as Moses, the script did not serve him justice. Real bad representation of what we have come to learn how the ""exodus""
book part of the bible and its events within it, came to be. I kept trying really hard to ""not compare to the classic ""Ten Commandments"" by Cecil B De Mile with Charles Heston, and I will tell you this version by Mr. Scott has got ""nothing' on it!.
I was also appalled at the casting of John Turturro as the king, the minute I heard the voice and recognized as to whom was playing the role, I could NOT help but laugh at it, that was a horrible casting decision. He was not in my belief an actor strong enough to resemble and to portray such a powerful role as a king, specially during that time.
The role of Ramsey, originally played by Yul Brynner in the ""commandments'' masterpiece are very strong ""footsteps"" to follow for someone like Joel Edgerton! who?, yeah that's what I mean. (he played in star wars II as Anakin's step-brother)
Long story short, IF you like science fiction and mostly computerized special effects with some action, then by all means do like a cat and kill your curiosity and watch it, do not take my word for it. I'm glad I only rented it, instead of spending money to buy it as originally planned.

Other instances were the times that when Moses asked the mediator which is not Biblical, the mediator replies on the I Am. In fact in the entire move, there is no reference the God of Israel, the Great I AM, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In fact when Moses speaks of what he saw in the mountain to his wife, he makes no mention of God, but only tells her to have faith, but faith in what? Somehow God was left out of the movie, and in order to sell the movie, the truth of the Bible as it occurred, as well as not mentioning Gods name, probably was due to the producers not wanting to offend anyone, and in doing so make more profits for the movie instead.

6887526,2,B00QUFHWMS,"This could have been an awesome movie.  the first of it did follow adequately close to the actual story in the Bible.  there is the full expectation that a movie will use artistic license to tell the story, which will often deviate from what actually happened in a real story.  no problem there.  but the artistry shouldn't change what happened - especially when the change was less dramatic than the actual story!

for example, in the famous 'burning bush' scene, the movie shows Moses going up the mountain, in a rain storm, getting caught in a mudslide, having his head cracked open, and getting buried up to his face.  then there is a burning bush, but it's actually incidental to the scene, as instead God is a little kid speaking to the trapped-in-the-mud Moses.  that's what the movie showed.  in the Bible, the story was much more exciting and dramatic.

Moses hears Almighty God coming *from* the amazing sight of a bush on fire that's not consumed.  then God tells Moses he's on holy ground, and to remove his shoes.  then God tells him what He's about to do to release the Hebrew slaves, and what Pharaoh will do.  Moses complains that there's no way Pharaoh would listen to him, etc.  so God provides reasons both for the people themselves to believe God sent him as well as Pharaoh to take him seriously: He turned Moses' staff into a snake, and then back into a staff, and then turned his hand into wickedly decrepit with leprosy - and back to perfectly healthy.  That has awesome potential for great cinematic imagery and creativity.

but this movie shows none of that, so that even his wife doesn't believe Moses saw God, and ridicules him for believing God was a kid and that he was dumb for leaving his family - both of which would have been reasonable if someone didn't have any proof from God.  Too many sections of this movie were just like that.

6887568,3,B00QUFHWMS,"Last year two modernized biblical blockbusters came to the big screen:  Noah, starring Russell Crowe in the title role, and Exodus: Gods and Kings, with Christian Bale playing Moses. Both films took so many liberties with the Old Testament version that if a bell rang every time they veered off-course, wed all be deaf. But at least there are no fantastic rock monsters in Exodus, the superior of the two.

Exodus: Gods and Kings is Ridley Scotts attempt to retell the story of Moses and the Israelites flight from Egypt, but its significantly different from Cecil B. De Milles The Ten Commandments, which was closer to King James.

De Mille made an epic. Scott, like Noah director Darren Aronofsky, made an action movie. Theres no wandering the desert with staff and sandals in Exodus. Scotts Moses rides a horse across the Red Sea narrows and the wilderness to Midian, with a sword in his bedroll. This Moses wears a breastplate and fights assassins, and when the time finally comes for him to return to Egypt and lead the Israelites to freedom, theres more talk of rebellion than there is of a promised land. He teaches the Israelites to fire bows and arrows and leads them on commando raids. This Moses is more military leader than prophet, and theres not a single And the Lord says to be found here. Theyre Egyptians, Moses tells Ramesses, they should have the same rights, they should be paid.

Much of the language is contemporary, with liberal use of contractionssomething my 17-year-old son assures me will go a long way toward appealing to the younger generation. So you have the Pharaoh saying things like, Everybody but the Viceroy, OUT! and another ancient Egyptian saying, I didn't say exiled. I said DEAD. In Midian, Moses says, Your daughters invited me here for food. They didn't tell me there was going to be an interrogationa word that didn't exist until the late 14th century.

Maybe thats nit-picking, since Scott manages to create a visually interesting ancient world. He also uses todays superior technology to wow us when God sends 10 plagues to smite the Egyptianseven though the Nile turns blood red because of a giant crocodile that attacks everyone like an ancient Jaws. And later, when the Red Sea rushes over the Egyptians, we briefly see sharks swirling around them in a feeding frenzy. All that too will probably go a long way toward appealing to a new generation of teens and tweens whove grown up playing action-filled video games.

Still, as often happens with action movies, whats sacrificed is dramatic build-up, and Scott takes plenty of shortcuts in this area. Theres not much depiction of slavery, for example, so theres no real sense of release and relief when the Israelites are finally let go. And Moses own backstory takes a backseat to the action. While De Mille sent Moses off to Ethiopia and then had him return a conquering hero ready to serve his Pharaoh (and further ingratiate him over the Pharaohs own son), Scott takes the opposite approach. We follow Moses into battle and watch him fight, while upon his return the sibling politics are slighter. In fact, if you aren't familiar with the story, it might be tough at first to figure out that Moses is the equivalent of an adopted son. Later its revealed how he came to be in that situation, but the order of information makes us care less about Moses or understand how conflicted he is between love of his adopted people and his hereditary people. Maybe thats because in Exodus: Gods and Kings, we really don't understand the depth of Moses connection to the slaves. Thats glossed over.

In the Bible, Jesus turned water into wine, but the way remakes are going these days, you get the feeling that a contemporary director would have him making frozen margaritas instead. Exodus: Gods and Kings will probably appeal most to lovers of action-adventures and audiences not that familiar with the biblical version. Like Noah, its a slick-looking action film that looks great in HD and includes a fully immersive DTS-HD MA 7.1 soundtrack.

6887619,3,B00QUFHWMS,"First off, I just want to say that Ridley, you're still the best at this game. Even in this sub par effort that pales like a...really pale thing...next to your other historical masterpieces of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator/dp/B00470TOV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kingdom-Of-Heaven/dp/B000SW16NU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kingdom Of Heaven</a>&nbsp;the epic sweep, accuracy, vivid detail, and gorgeous sets, costumes and visuals really set Exodus: Gods and Kings above the rest of your historical imitators. Added to pitch-perfect CGI, you brought the Ten Plagues to vivid, horrifying, unforgettable life. More on that later.

Secondly, Ridley, when you shoot for epic, you hit the bulls-eye. Exodus is a movie featuring spectacle of Biblical proportions (wait a minute...). The scope of ancient Egypt is vivid and powerful, and the might and majesty of the civilization is awe-inspiring. The battles are massive  and the plagues of Egypt - easily a 5 star highlight of the movie - are brought to life in disgusting, brutal, icky detail (The flies OH THE FLIES!). The parting of the Red Sea and subsequent destruction of the Egyptian army (to spoil God's three-thousand-year-old bestselling book, which you should absolutely have read by now) is an immensely epic and magnificent set piece. THAT is why we have giant screens and loud speakers and cardboard cartons of chemicalized popcorn - to bring such spectacle to life!

So it begs the question, Ridley. Why wasn't there MORE of it?

Why did Exodus lack any sort of bite or originality whatsoever? It is more of a slog than an adventure; and if it was trying to be gritty it failed to give any sort of power, insight, or emotion to the proceedings. Let's compare and contrast Exodus with other Biblical epics. The classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ten-Commandments/dp/B000J0XJC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ten Commandments</a>&nbsp;is a film (sorry, Motion Picture Event) literally constructed out of cheese and Cecile B. De Mille's own hubris. It's a pretentious epic filled with spectacle, ridiculous lines, giant sets, and FREEDOM. And yet, its sincerity and ambition could have served Exodus well (plus: any movie that has Yul Brynner sitting on a cobra throne is an instant win). What about last year's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Noah/dp/B00JB3NUHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Noah</a>? Noah is bat-guano insane. It's muddled and crazy and ridiculous and above all, absolutely unforgettable and original - things that Exodus really needed. Even the animated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prince-of-Egypt/dp/B005MKZMRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prince of Egypt</a>&nbsp;had more color, energy, and emotion than this. Exodus failed because Exodus played it safe. It lacked an edge, power, drama that it sorely needed.  Exodus is NOT a bad movie. Not in the least, by any definition of the word. It's just been done better by other people, many times.

The writer's attempts at edginess begin and end at making Moses a maybe-delusional, slightly unlikable military commander, and making God appear to Moses as petulant, spoiled little boy with a British accent. It's an interesting stylistic choice that sadly adds nothing to the movie and is completely pretentious. Ignoring the troubling religious aspects of this, I, a Christian, would actually would have respected Exodus more if it were MORE edgy or controversial. At least it would have stirred some emotion in me. But again, there are worse problems with Exodus.

The cast is mostly wasted. Aaron Paul, Ben Kingsley, Maria Valverde, and Sigourney Weaver are all squandered in thankless cameos. To their credit however, Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton, Ben Mendelssohn, and John Turturro all give good performances.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christian-Bale/dp/B0091WAN3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christian Bale</a>'s Moses is conflicted and grim, but he manages to bring a humanity and a subtlety that serves Moses well.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joel-Edgerton/dp/B006O5YHUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joel Edgerton</a>&nbsp;is the most interesting part of the movie as Rameses, a spoiled, egotistical, hubristic pharaoh of a failing kingdom - so kudos to his moving performance. Mendelssohn and Turturro play the governor of the slaves and Moses' adopted pharaoh father respectively, and both give worthy, scene-stealing performances.

In the end however, Exodus is brought down by its slow-moving plot and by-the-numbers delivery. Its wasted cast, lack of edge or emotion, or insight into its complex characters certainly don't help. But as I said before, Exodus is absolutely NOT a bad movie. Far from it, I recommend that everyone watch this movie on the biggest screen they can find. The epic and the spectacle is NOT to be missed. The plague scenes are worth the price of admission alone. Ridley Scott may have trouble finding the right scripts, but he certainly doesn't have trouble with giant battles, ancient pyramids and palaces, or Biblical-style shock-and-awe. Is that enough to save it? You be the judge.

6887627,1,B00QUFHWMS,"I want to be honest, as a religious- jewish I'm deeply ashamed this movie don't represent the story as in the bible and show my nation history in grim light.
Let start that in the movie moses is shown as a psychopath and schizophrenic person who imagine characters and events.
after that it shown that the event in which in the bible moses is killing an egyptian soldier after he hit an elder hebrew slave but in the movie it shown as casual murder after he was angry and the egyptian just called him a slave.
but it doesn't end here- in the movie there are two hebrew slaves who are spying for the local ruler (there isn't such event in the bible story) and characterize them as money greed traitors, a very usual anti-semitic way to show the jewish people.
beside of this in the movie zipora has a belief that the near mountain is sacred and in the movie end in implied that by that this is the sinai mountain in which the tablets given to the israeli people. (just because zipora believed in that not because it actually was)
in the bible story there wasn't any egyptian assassins who sent kill moses. there wasn't any situation according to the biblical story that moses sister Miriam was in the royal palace nor the scene in which pharaoh threat to cut her arm.
I think it is totally needless to mention that the whole movie opening 35+ minutes is all made up.
and also the part where it shown hebrew people in a military practices and rebellion in the bible story the hebrew do not fight by armes and just trust god to do it for them. moses do not mentioned in the bible as great general or any military talented.
Also in the judaism god do not have or ever had a physical character, unlike it shown in the movie (as a child with british accent) and do not want any revenge in the egyptian people as shown in 01:38.
did anyone noticed that in the movie there isn't even one time that moses demanded from pharaoh the famous quote ""let my people free""?
I have to say that the new interpretation for the crossing the red sea is refreshing but moses didn't caught in the water and also in the movie there is no mention for the ""song on the sea"" (it preserved still today and jewish sing it in prayers) that the hebrews sings for praised god for the miracles it did for them.
Also in the end of the movie moses is shown in carriage but in the bible he lead them in the desert by walking in the front.

before I'll conclude I must mention that I do find it's secular perspective on the biblical as positive and believe it were similar but by taking that story to the harsh ground of reality that hard is devastate its moral message and the inspiration it had.
to conclude this is very disappointing movie which first inaccurate at best and in bad is misleading and harmful for these who don't know the hebrew true biblical story. I definitely do NOT want to watch it again.",1426377600,5,2873,4.330241187384044

6887631,3,B00QUFHWMS,"As I write this review, I do hope God doesn't think I'm reviewing Him. However, after you see this movie, that's just about what you may end up doing. I have a mixture of emotions that are going to be difficult to sort out. Frankly, giving this movie three stars is kind.

Let's preface what I'm about to say with one thing--this is not Ten Commandments and Charlton Heston. It's not even close to being a remake, so put those thoughts quickly behind you. I suppose you can criticize the original movie for having committed the same sins as this one does, but back in the 50's it was a different world. In this day and age, we should know better, and Ridley Scott didn't do the movie any justice by laying aside certain aspects that needed more attention.

Oh, don't get me wrong. Computer generated images today makes Ten Commandments look very amateur in comparison to the technology available in the 21st century. If you love to watch disaster movies, purchase a ticket, sit down, and watch the plagues arrive. You'll be thankful that you didn't have to partake in that experience--water turned to blood, plague of frogs, plague of flies, livestock dropping dead, plague of boils, plague of hail, and death of the firstborn (mingled with the plague of darkness). I think gnats and lice are in there somewhere, but I was too mesmerized by the flies to notice.

Why am I so critical about the remainder of the movie? Well, if I were a staunch believer looking for a hundred percent complete Biblical accuracy, you won't find it. God appears to Moses not only in a burning bush, but in the form of a child throughout the movie. He's an arrogant child, by the way, and a tad on the bratty side who challenges Moses at every turn. After Moses returns to Egypt, he begins to train and build a small army thinking that's the way God wants it done. The Almighty, however, tells him that he's doing a lousy job and it's time for him to step aside and watch how he's going to take care of matters. Afterward the plagues begin.  Having a child being a conduit for the voice of God is an interesting choice, but I don't really think it worked for a variety of reasons.

The other criticism I have is two-fold.  One, the dialogue absolutely stinks; and two, the casting is terrible. Whoever wrote the screenplay didn't write a believable script.  Good golly, the modernness of the prose was absolutely ridiculous, along with some of the lines. The cast, on the other hand, contains an entire mish-mash of various ethic groups from blue-eyed Egyptians to a God-like child speaking with an English accent.  Yes, I know that the Ten Commandments had all white people in that one, too, but as I said we should have evolved into making a movie close to reality.

As far as Christian Bale's acting is concerned, I have no complaints about his performance. Actually, I feel sorry for him having to deal with such terrible lines. Edgerton, who plays Ramses, is okay. Frankly, the infamous Yul Brynner is a hard act to follow.  The remainder of the cast adds very little effect to make the story any more worthwhile.

Moses, by the way, really doesn't like the way God works. The audience is bombarded with that one question, which I find interesting to my own questions about faith.  As Ramses holds his dead son in his arms brokenhearted, he asks Moses a poignant question. How can you worship a God that kills innocent children? Perhaps that is a question that we all wrestle with throughout the movie and afterward, for many die because of His wrath. God in child form says to Moses that he's noticed something--that Moses doesn't always agree with him. I think every human can relate to that comment.

The costumes, the sets, the computer generated scenes are some of the best you'll see on screen.  I only hope as they rolled the credits there was a statement that said, ""No horses were harmed in the filming of this movie."" If you're a horse lover, you may cringe watching them suffer God's wrath as well.

As far as spirituality in the story, I only experienced one part that moved me emotionally. It was watching the Hebrews kill lambs and spreading the blood on their doorposts. There is no reference to it being the first Passover as was shown in Ten Commandments or why they are even doing it, but if you're a Christian or Hebrew it's that significance of salvation that is noteworthy.

So that's Exodus in a nutshell. Oh, and the Hebrews were freed from slavery.  Now comes the fun part. Will Moses be able to handle the complaining and idolatrous Israelites as they return to their homeland?  Well, you'll have to crack the Bible to find out what happens next.

Oh, and please, whoever in the world is remaking Ben Hur, DON'T SCREW THAT ONE UP TOO!  It will be blasphemous.",1426291200,2,4768,4.587058823529412

Afterwards, I wanted to get out my Bible and re-read Exodus, but the movie was 2 hours and 30 minutes, so that will have to wait till tonight! This movie took the classic story from the Old Testament transformed it to a modern interpretation for viewers to follow along. I said interpretation as there were liberties with this movie, but in the grand scheme of thing it worked.  Subtle differences, Bible references parting the Red Sea, while in this movie, the sea retracts due to an unexplainable low tide.

6887689,3,B00QUFHWMS,"In 2014 we have seen Darren Aronofskys Noah and heres another biblically-inspired film. Ridley Scotts Exodus: Gods and Kings follows the famous story of Moses, played by Christian Bale, the same role Charlton Heston played in The Ten Commandments in 1956. The new version has great visuals and production designs, but the 150-miunte epic movie lacks something, feeling somewhat empty.

Maybe it is because of the films strange pacing. The first half of the plot is very slow, with Moses in Egypt fighting alongside with Prince Ramesses (Joel Edgerton), and then Moses exiled from Egypt. The second half including the crossing of the Red Sea is too fast, jumping from one scene to another, without leaving much emotional impact.

Or maybe it is because of the lack of character development. Moses is described here as a sort of revolutionary  he carries a sword, not a rod  but despite Christian Bales intense acting, we are not convinced, as we are not allowed to know much about Moses and what he thinks or feels.

Like in Prometheus, Ridley Scott attempts at large-scale storytelling, but ends up with a long a dull movie with dazzling visuals.",1426118400,,1146,4.917098445595855

6887692,2,B00QUFHWMS,"What a shame.  I was so looking forward to seeing the biblical story of Moses with special effects that would totally capture the absolute wonder and awesome, unmatchable power of God, Jehovah, the Alpha & Omega, the Great I AM.  I thought at the very least, the special effects would be awe inspiring even if the story line fell short.  Unfortunately that wasn't even the case.  The Exodus starring Charleston Heston was a much better depiction of the miracles that God performed through Moses than this contemporary version.  It was also sad that the storyline was so vague as if trying to tiptoe around the truths of this biblical event. For some strange reason they did not associate the plagues as being a demonstration by God through Moses, rather the plagues seemed to occur in a haphazard sort of way with no announcement to Pharaoh of the pending plagues.

Overall, this was a giant disappointment, to all other Christians out there, don't bother, rent the original with Charleston Heston, at least it leaves you satisfied that you've witnessed the truths of the story in as much as mortal man is able to depict them.",1426032000,4,1126,4.778350515463917

6887694,2,B00QUFHWMS,"I was really disappointed in the films biblical accuracy. Moses had a sword instead of a rod/ staff, the plagues were blamed on natural occurrences not on God's wrath. The Red Sea didn't part at all and didn't start with the pound of Moses staff. I don't know if Moses even got married let alone had children. And I don't know if he was involved with a Zipporah. Just so much about this movies plot was confusing. It didn't tell us who the people were that Moses married into, if they were Jewish and it was such a quick marriage it just didn't seem real. I think Ridley Scott rushed through parts of the movie that should have been more detailed, like the marriage, how Moses found out he was a Hebrew. It was so uneventful that it was barely covered to know if he even really realized he was a Jew. I just totally didn't like this movie. If you want to see an sort of exciting movie, see this. But if you're looking to see the Movie cause it's about the bible, don't cuz it's really not that much about the bibles version. One more thing, the choice of actors should have been more ethnic, instead of all these well known white actors and actresses. That was a downer for me, I mean Sigourney Weaver as an Egyptian?

Instead of God writing The  Ten Commandments with His finger, Moses carves them while God looks on. And what is the reasoning behind having a child play the part of God in the movie? I don't know.

OK so how many of us were actually there and witnessed the real life and story of Moses? I certainly didn't. Personally, I liked the movie because it was a little more realistic than what Hollywood normally puts out.

The story says that Moses parted the Red Sea. In the movie it shows them crossing the sea due to low tide. What's more believable? Many natural disasters go unexplained even in today's world. Most of the time science can give a realistic answer but not always. When people say this movie isn't ""FACT"" well of course not, it's a ""MOVIE"". I agree with some others that having a child in the movie play the part of God, ""the burning bush"" was a bit much and I really didn't like that, but I did like the movie overall.

If you are looking for a ditto of the movie ""The Ten Commandments"" with Charlton Heston, you may want to avoid this one. Even I say, no one can beat Heston.

Moses only speaks to God after being hit on the head in a rock and mud slide. And from then on, when God speaks to him it is through the image of a young boy. From the time he is hit on the head Moses is basically a bumbling idiot. The biblical plagues happen consecutively with no warning to Pharoah by Moses or God. The only warning comes before the killing of the first born or Egypt by the angel of death. The Nile turns red and all the fish are killed as a result of Nile crocodiles attacking a boat, killing all that are on board, and then turning against each other in a feeding frenzy. Moses is caught in the Red Sea along with Pharoah. They both survive on separate shores. I could keep going. Entertaining as a movie but don't expect accuracy.

6887889,4,B00QUFHWMS,"""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" has been unjustly maligned. It certainly has its weak points (clearly a victim of executive cutting, as the awkwardly rushed script attests) but it is a ancient tale told with Ridley Scott's remarkable knack for the historical epic. His world building is incredible, as always, and the cinematography is painterly and focused. Joel Edgerton also turns in a powerfully sympathetic performance as Ramses, stealing the show from Christian Bale as Moses, and also features a rollicking religious epic score from Alberto Iglesias and Harry Gregson-Williams. If you're a fan of Scott's epics, or simply Biblical/historical epics, this one is worth a view. I'm hoping that eventually the original four hour cut will be released to Blu-Ray, as I have a hunch it will solve much of the theatrical version's flaws. In the meantime, Scott has presented an interesting, thought provoking, and often exciting take on an old story, and while it doesn't come close to the heights of ""The Prince of Egypt"" or ""The Ten Commandments"", it is still a worthy entry into Hollywood's Exodus canon and a lesser triumph in the artistic career of Ridley Scott.",1425772800,,1159,5.0732984293193715

If you are going to use the title EXODUS, and the names MOSES, MIRIAM, JOSHUA, CALEB, and RAMES altogether plus talk about GOD..... people have the right to assume that the rendition will be a much closer to the book of Exodus in the Bible.

8693045,1,B00QUFHWMS,"What's not to hate with this Ridley Scott disaster film?  I was set to give this film the widest latitude- I am a Christian and usually love to see high tech applied to biblical stories.  I don't mind a few interpretations here and there as long as the awesomeness of God is shown and the overall themes come through.  This film, however, managed to make one of the most fascinating stories of mankind BORING.  I think Ridley Scott was asleep when he made the film.  Or absent from the cutting room.  The film is a series of events- there is no reason for any of it to take place.  Gone is the theme of a powerful prince who finds humility through his true identity; gone is the theme that God is more powerful than man and THUS, justice will be done no matter how evil anyone or any kingdom can ever be; gone is the HOPE that because God is a worthy and just God, the poor and downtrodden will be delivered and the promise of redemption and salvation will come true; gone is the theme that a man becomes more worthy when he becomes true to himself, even if it means suffering 40 days and nights in a desert, losing all his worldly powers and riches and goes from princedom to shepherdom; gone is the incredible parallel between Moses' story and the coming of Christ, the Lamb who is sacrificed to save us all from the Angel of Death.  There is a reason the bible stories last so long in the imaginations of man:  they speak to the human condition in incredibly powerful ways.  Ridley Scott took all the good stuff out and left only the skeleton.  It became very, very boring and disjointed.  I found myself filing my fingernails, then my toenails... then, eh, I just decided to end the misery right before the last plague.  Even the promise of the massive wave I had wanted to see couldn't make me waste any more of my night.  Bummer.",1531267200,,1835,4.358823529411764
