8059358,5,B0009CTTKQ,"Great characters, great story, great anime, great music. The best of everything. No kiddy anime hear. A serious heart wrenching story about a secret agency that finds adolecent girls and provides care for them under the guise of the Social Welfare Agency, secretly they give the girls cybernetic bodies, and condition them to be assasins for the government. They are asigned handlers who are responsible for there conditioning and missions. They become trained assassins but they still have human emotions.
I have been a fan of Anime since the late 60's when Speed Racer came to America, and have seen just about all of it. The Gunslingergirl Series had me swept away with a gammit of emotions like no other. To bad there were only 13 episode. and the last episode is a real tear jerker.",1147910400,,787,4.794117647058823
8059359,5,B0009CTTKQ,"Volume 2 is just as awesome as volume 1. Here we get more into the lives of the 5 girls, you just have to get this anime, its so beautiful!!!",1135296000,,141,3.7333333333333334
8059360,5,B0009CTTKQ,"I've come to hate television because there's always nothing on,nothing interesting,nothing remotely entertaining. There's a real crisis:producers,tv execs,hollywood big shots all lack of creativity,innovation. But i found out recently that music films and anything creative is like food,in order to be a well-balanced individual we gotta have our daily dose of ""healthy"" entertainment,not the kind that questions our intellingence (like the reality show crap...).So for me to achieve that i had to look elsewhere,and i found everything that i need watching Anime. Gunslinger Girl in all honesty is one of the best out there,its not your average series,the people behind it are true artists. The show is captivating,smart and above all entertaining.

I think it's a good investment buying any Gunslinger Girl DVDs,buy them all,you won't regret it. Hollywood has given up,instead of releasing good quality movies,they're fighting over teens downloading their crap on the internet,and all the shows on tv look the same,you're smarter than that:Get Gunslinger Girl,now!",1127088000,4,1065,5.69811320754717
8059361,5,B0009CTTKQ,"The second DVD of this series (and the middle DVD since this is a short series of three DVDs) gets more into the lives and stories of the girls of the social welfare agency.  We are introduced to two new girls of the agency and get more in to the story of the others.

If you are unfamiliar with the story of Gunslinger Girls, there is an agency in modern day Italy that takes in young girls that have had a traumatic event happen in their lives and are unable to cope with life in a normal way.  The girls are implanted with cyborg parts and go through a very intensive training program that is referred to as ""conditioning"".  Thes process erases their prior memory.  Each girl is hand picked by a fratello, or ""brother"", that takes care of their every need and makes sure that they get the correct amount of conditioning.  This is what makes up a majority of the Gunslinger Girl universe.  The handler really controls everything the girls do and the they really have a special bond with them.  Don't let this scare you off.  This is not at all done in poor taste.  The love between the girl and the handler is more of a brother/sister or father/daughter relationship.

I really enjoy the attention to detail that this series takes with the art direction and the gun detail.  The music is also top notch.  There is mostly classical type of music, but they also use music by the Delgados, which is awesome!

This disk gets more in to the ""enemy"" that they are facing, but the most of the story in the series still deals with the lives of the girls at the agency.  This series gets away with the central ""bad guy"" type and goes more in to the lives of these girls and their handlers.  If you can get past that, than you will really enjoy Gunslinger girls.

The extras on the disk include interviews with all of the voice actors for the girls.  They are about five minutes each, and are very candid.  There are also clean opening and closing credits as well as some special stuff on the animation of the characters.

Anyway, if you already bought the first DVD, chances are you are most likely going to purchase the second.  If you haven't taken a look at this series, you won't go wrong with a great but short series.",1126137600,3,2216,4.36919315403423
8059362,5,B0009CTTKQ,"the second disk is so good as the first one, with Elsa's murder without being solved gives desires of getting you the third and finish disk of the series, I hope to buy it soon to continue enjoying this series, pity that only they are 13 episodes.

El servicio de esta tienda es exelente, no dejen de comprar aqu nunca.",1125792000,,319,4.316666666666666
8059363,4,B0009CTTKQ,"Volume 2 of this series continues to chronicle the lives of the girls of Section 2, or the ""Social Welfare Agency,"" which takes in terminally ill or injured young girls and rehabilitates them into cybernetic assassins.  It is an unexpectedly tender show which focuses as much (if not more) on the quiet moments in between missions as on the action itself.  Particularly touching is the story of Angelica, who came to the agency after being run down by her own parents in a car, and now suffers continual long-term memory loss.  We also meet Elsa, a cold and distant girl whom the others fear.

Extras on this disc include clean opening and closing sequences, another ""cel-building"" demonstration, dossier files for the girls and some trailers.",1123977600,4,743,4.92
8059364,4,B0009CTTKQ,"Gunslinger girl is a great anime, but i find it too short and it needs more to the story. despite the shortness, its cute and awesome.",1123113600,,134,4.1923076923076925
