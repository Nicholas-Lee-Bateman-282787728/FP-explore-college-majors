1634335,4,B00005NKSD,"What is it about Canada that produces genuinely unsettling, disturbing, non-cop-out horror films, from 'Black Christmas' to Cronenberg to this? In a clotted market of tired spoofs and increasingly desperate sensation-mongering, 'Ginger Snaps' is the real, slow-burning, mind-worrying, nerve-fraying thing. In its story of a teenage girl attacked in a nocturnal wood by a werewolf-type creature who begins developing animal characteristics and destructive tendencies, the mark of Cronenberg is evident: not just in the squelchy creature effects, but also in the interest in the various stages of metamorphosis, in the way the characters and the environment around her deals with the move from human to animal, and the way the modest house turns into a cavernous horror chamber in the protracted climax, blurring the lines between disgust and affect.
But this transformation is more familiar and mundane than an accidental meeting with a lycanthrope. Ginger is a moody 16 year old who is finally beginning 'the curse' - she changes from a childish dependence on her younger sister to the more adult world of sexual exploration and female body changes. Here the horror world belongs to Angela Carter and a film like 'The Company of Wolves', where body horror and the wrenching change from child to adult meet. But 'Ginger Snaps' is not merely a metaphor for menstruation - Ginger begins developing male characteristics, such as body hair and a tail, and this hermaphroditic trauma is part of the film's originality.
'Snaps' may be ultimately conservative, locating destructive change in a world of indifferent or silly parents, creativity-crushing teachers, drug-taking or (unprotected) promiscuity. But this is a movie utterly faithful to the world-view of its outsider, brooding teen heroines. Although there is humour, it is not the smarmy character-audience complicity of most teen horror movies, but a mark of the privacy that keeps the viewer to an extent outside. From the opening sequence of a child playing with the bleeding lumps of a mutilated mutt, to the mock-up suicide friezes created by the sisters for art class, to the sickly, unfathomable mise-en-scene, making unexceptional suburbia seem like the most grisly place on earth, to the character of Beatrice, long, dark-robed Goth mistress, with forbidding fringe and intimidating lurch, who Never Smiles Once, 'Snaps' is a celebration of the weird, slightly creepy kids. Like us.",1001376000,12,2443,5.364583333333333
1634336,5,B00005NKSD,"It is a crime that horror tripe like ""Valentine"" was given wide release in US theatres yet a film as fantastic as this one goes straight to video. Is it because of the strong female characters? The open discussion and realistic portrayal of teen girls enduring puberty? Perhaps it was thought that characters with actual depth might confuse US audiences. Or maybe none of the US studios wanted to release a Canadian film that made theirs look so bad. Personally I think that it was due to the string of fantastic offerings for the 2001 summer movies and there just wasn't room for anything marketed at an audience that doesn't have drooling problems. This is easily the best horror film in years with complex characters, a very black sense of humor and a script that isn't a mishmash of everything you've seen before. It builds tension relentlessly right up to the pull no punches ending. Keep an eye on the two stars-they have long solid careers stretching inf front of them if their work continues to be of this caliber.",997488000,4,1022,4.683333333333334
1634337,4,B00005NKSD,This movie was definatly not your average horror film. I had many likes and dislikes like for one how Sam and Gingers sister found a warewolf cure so fast that startled me but the fact that I think Kris Lemche (Sam) is like the hottest guy on the planet made me like the movie more! I also thought Gingers parents were funny they shouldve been shown more. In this flim ther were an excellent cast they all played there parts so well. Especially Kris Lemche! We should see him more in the us!,996537600,2,491,4.290322580645161
1634338,5,B00005NKSD,"I'll be honest, I went to see this film expecting a run of the mill slasher. Ginger Snaps is anything but.
Ginger and Brigette are two sisters who share an unusual and morbid bond. The opening sequence, a succession of bizarre and gruesome mocked-up photos showing one or the other of them in death scenes sets the tone for the film and is blackly hilarious.
The onset of puberty and a bite from a strange creature turns Ginger into a sex-crazed and violent monster and alienates her from her sister for the first time. It is at this point that Emily Perkins as Brigette comes into her own in an astonishing performance that captures perfectly the awkwardness and desperation of adolescence. Brigette, for so long in her elder sister's shadow, suddenly has to take control of the situation and does so admirably.
If I have one criticism of this film it is the last 15-20 minutes which do revert to slasher gore and mayhem and frankly go on too long... but even this does not detract sufficiently from the rest of it to prevent a 5 star rating.
See this film immediately!",995241600,,1070,4.578125

As I'm sure many horror fans can relate, I've reached a point where an over exposure to disappointingly bad horror has left me cynical and skeptical. For this very reason, I nearly completely overlooked Ginger Snaps. In a sea of low budget horror crap, Ginger Snaps is a true gem that risks being swallowed up by waves of trendy teen exploitation slashers. Ginger brings a breath of fresh air to the teen horror genre with its biting wit, intelligent script, and downright scary atmosphere.
Sixteen-year-old Ginger (played by Katherine Isabelle) and fifteen year old Brigitte (Emily Perkins) are sisters with a disturbing, if not enviable, bond. Their sibling connection runs deep and they share an understanding that is totally unique from the world they live in. Although their existence is a dark one, they live in a world that is truly of their own creation. And the only thing that stands to destroy their bond is the monstrous (literally) effect that puberty has on Ginger.
Ginger and Brigitte are both late bloomers, and when Ginger finally gets her first period, events are set into motion that will ultimately tear the sisters apart. As the girls are hunting up trouble late one night, the scent of Ginger's first blood attracts a vicious werebeast, and the attack that ensues is more than subtly suggestive of the violent changes that take place in the bodies of all pubescent girls.
Far from being just another teen slasher, Ginger Snaps is a movie about familial bonds, social exclusion, and the very real horrors of adolescence. The film's examination of menstruation and female sexuality are brave, to say the least, and honest. The metaphorical &#8220;curse&#8221; that is menstruation is intelligently explored through the development of Ginger's more bestial characteristics. This film is one of the only horror films that I would hazard to call &#8220;feminist horror&#8221; (which both excites me and saddens me because I was hoping that one day I would invent the feminist horror genre). And even though the scriptwriter is a woman (Karen Walton to be precise), I am constantly blown away that Ginger was directed by a man, John Fawcett. I say this because there are many subtleties of the female adolescent condition that are apparent throughout this film (but, this is probably a subject best left for one of my future analytical film critiques).
I hope that this talk of menstruation and feminism doesn't turn off our male readers. Ginger Snaps is also masterfully hysterical. I dragged the boyfriend to see Ginger with me the first time and we were both rolling in the isles. I wouldn't call Ginger a comedy, per se, but the dialogue is more often than not darkly comical and bitingly sarcastic, not to mention witty and intelligent. Also worth noting are the special effects. Ginger's budget was measly by Hollywood standards so don't expect to see any amazing CG monsters. Instead, you can expect to see a return to the good old days of animatronics, silicone, and light tricks. Personally, I'm glad to see it. The film feels altogether more organic thanks to the sf/x choices. It is interseting to note that the design for the werebeast cannot be adequately described in terms of the werewolves that most of us are used to. The feel is much more feline, more feminine than your typical werewolf - furthering the film's theme of the animalistic female.
In my opinion, Ginger Snaps is a revolutionary film in the werewolf genre. I've read articles that compared this film to A Company of Wolves (and if that helps to convince you to see it, then great) but I would be reluctant to compare this film to any other. It truely stands in a class of its own.",991353600,14,3682,4.8740031897926634
1634340,5,B00005NKSD,"Ginger Snaps had a short theatrical release here in Australia last year (October 2000) and although I missed it at the cinema I was able to catch it on video a week or so later (it is now a $3 weekly hire!).  Basically, I was amazed at how such a fine piece of modern teen/horror crept under the radar and has still largely gone unnoticed.  This movie has all the best elements of Heathers, the Howling and Buffy, from the dark opening sequence through to the memorable, gory end. I don't want to go into too much detail- you can get that from other reviews but if you like intelligent dialogue, high school teen angst, horror movies and Mimi Rogers as your all American mom, you won't anything better than Ginger Snaps.  You must see this movie- NOW!",990921600,,751,4.427536231884058
1634341,5,B00005NKSD,"I just saw this film and it ROCKED!  Basically, it's sort of the run-of-the-mill horror film about two sisters, one of whom becomes infected with a werewolf virus.  But it takes the genre to a new level.
A lot of people have compared this film to ""Heathers"" for its similar treatment of suburban teenage angst.  Fair enough, but what makes this movie special is the way it works the werewolf archetype into a metaphor for female sexuality.  Ginger (the werewolf) and her sister Brigitte are 16 and 15, but neither has begun menstrating.  This delay makes for a powerful onset when the ""female curse"" (the film's term) combines with the werewolf virus.  Transformation is always popular with adolescent boys (pokemon, ninja turtles, transformers, gobots etc.) and hollywood monsters have always been used for metaphors for human experiences and stages and (werewolf: our animal nature; vampires: death and disease; mummies: resurrection; frankenstein: God and parenting)  This is the first film that has encompassed both transformation and monsterhood and applied it distintively to women.
Additionally, this film should be credited with its intelligent handling of drug use.  Without glorifying drugs, Ginger Snaps depicts one of the supporting characters as a pharmalogically wise and sympathetic drug dealer.  His character brings out a more complex view of drugs (appropriate when they are not divorced from their spiritual and medical significance) in a scene that looks a lot like heroin preparation.
The two main actors, Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle, have great chemistry and pull off the very difficult job of delivering Buffy/Heathers/Scream/Jawbreaker type comedic lines without breaking the seriously frightening mood the film creates.",988761600,8,1753,5.462962962962963

1634381,2,B00005NKSD,"Hello readers,

It was a typical Monday night. Hazel and I were bored and playing the usual What would you like to do? game while I procrastinated on writing my sequel to Beyond the Veil, A Veil of Stars.

Do you want to watch a movie? Hazel barked at me.

Yes, but I want to watch something inspiring, I said. Hey, maybe a werewolf movie, since Im writing about werewolves! And so folks, this is how we came to watch Ginger Snaps on Hulu last night. And OMG, do I wish I hadnt. Of all the inspiring movies we could have filled our eyeballs with last night, I chose this horrifyingly bad flick and I want my hour and forty eight minutes back. Think of all the amazing, awe inspiring words that I could have written today that may have been inspired from watching an amazing, awe inspiring werewolf movie (do any of those exist?)...but no. Instead you get this review :P

Numerous problems abound with Ginger Snaps, including characterization, pacing, special effects, and the writing itself. Katharine Isabelle as Ginger seems to be trying to hold this entire film together herself, while the other actors are clearly struggling with their parts (with perhaps the exception of Kris Lemche as Sam). This unintentionally funny/horror movie does not know what it wants to be, and it suffers for it with a title that does not match the tone of the film. Hazel, being easily entertained, bless the little dog, gave this film 2 stars. I was not so kind, so it only receives a measly one star from me. Harrumph.

This film follows the lives of sisters Brigitte and Ginger as they stage their own deaths and go to school. Things quickly take a darker turn when Ginger swiftly approaches puberty (and by that I mean she starts spewing blood at very inconvenient times) on their way to prank a snotty, popular chick. A werewolf, smelling her menstrual blood, attacks and she is bitten. We follow her journey into lycanthropy (and this could not be any more boring if this film tried, which it clearly didnt). Emo, expressionless and uninteresting Brigitte skulks throughout the entire film as she tries to hide her sisters curse and cure her. When we finally do see Ginger in her most glorious werewolf form, I was disappointed to see that she quite resembled the love child between a bat and a pig. And while most of the film is lacking in sufficient action, the ending is so gratuitous that it quickly loses steam into its very fitting, but altogether unsatisfying conclusion.

The puberty=werewolfiness angle was bad enough. But the biggest problem Hazel and I had with this movie was the suspension of belief. I don't mean that I had trouble believing werewolves were really pig/bat mutants, but none of the actors would be believable in any setting except for Ginger. If you were thrown into the eviscerated remains of a dog you would be horrified, not merely humiliated and if you suspected your daughter of murder, you would not simply light a match in the house, forget your husband, and start a new life with your kids! It was moments like these, AKA bad writing, that pulled Hazel and I out of the story and prevented us from fully enjoying what I believe was a good story buried in the rubble. Somewhere.

Now Hazel was not nearly as harsh on this movie as I was. The acting is alright, the cinematography solid, if not a bit bland, and the gradual transformation of Ginger was well done, if not a bit tedious. The adjusted score for this film is 1.5 stars.

1634416,3,B00005NKSD,"Most lists of the best werewolf films of all time are bound to have Ginger Snaps ranked fairly high, and so when I got my hands on the DVD I was eager to experience what I expected to be a modern classic.

Naturally, I was in for a big letdown.

Ginger Snaps isn't a terrible movie, but it's not what most reviewers lead you to believe, either. Yes, it is a werewolf movie--but only just. Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) spends most of the film gradually becoming more and more wolfen, but the character was pretty far out there to begin with and being bitten by a lycanthrope really just accelerates her transformation from teenager to woman. Eventually Ginger does go wolf, but the climax isn't particularly exciting or even as moving as it should have been. The werewolf effects leave a lot to be desired, and lycanthropes from the 40s and 50s generally look better. And as for internal logic, forget it. The script leaves multiple plot threads dangling, and in particular hangs the girls' mother out to dry after spending a lot of time turning her into a major character.

So what does Ginger Snaps get right? Characterization and interraction. The relationship between the two sisters is almost painfully realistic. Lycanthropy aside, their interplay is witty, heartfelt, and true to life. Perkins and Isabelle have a tremendous chemistry, and their evolving relationship as Ginger metamorphosizes is fascinating. In fact, if I hadn't been caught up in the dynamic being played out between the two, I wouldn't have finished watching the movie. In a way, it's a shame the werewolf angle wasn't either more fully developed or simply dropped. As it is, it's more of a gimmick than a real plot point. It would have been great to see Ginger's lycanthropy better realized, but of course some will say this isn't supposed to be a traditional werewolf movie, but rather a character study about two sisters coping with growing up and apart. I buy that--but such a story doesn't need werewolves to make it interesting. At times, the thin werewolf element is more of a distraction to the real story, not an enhancement.

Ginger Snaps may be well shot and directed (it certainly is) and both Perkins and Isabelle may deliver bravura performances (they do), but it's not much of a werewolf film. The filmmakers deserve credit for trying something different, but unfortunately they just miss the mark. A little more lycanthropy might have made all the difference.",1438128000,,2450,4.86810551558753

1634459,4,B00005NKSD,"Ginger Snaps is a coming-of-age tale of a young girl blossoming into a beautiful woman... wolf... a beautiful womanwolf. Our titular character, Ginger, and her younger sister, Daria (I mean, Brigitte) are your typical late 90s/early 00s goth-esque suburban angsty teens. They take staged suicide photos and do other social outcasty things that don't make them very popular at high school. Around their neighborhood, a few dogs turn up missing... their lives... a few legs, heads, etc... causing our morbid little teens to go snooping around, which naturally gets Ginger bitten by a werewolf. As bad as that may be, it pales in comparison to her real problem: She's having her first period.

 Like most girls experiencing their first visit from Aunt Flow, Ginger becomes irritable, moody, rambunctious, hyper-sexual, gets hair in odd places, grows a tail, and starts killing random neighborhood dogs. Her behavior becomes increasingly erratic while Brigitte and local convenient werewolf expert, Sam, try to find a cure for lycanthropy, for whatever reason. What follows is a lot of teenage girl screaming, melodrama, and a girl accidentally slipping on milk and dying in their kitchen. This starts a chain of events that leads to Ginger murdering school personnel, threatening and/or hitting on her own sister and running off to a party to kill and/or have sex with Sam. Meanwhile, the siblings' mother, having found the body of Milk Girl, brings Brigitte to the party  to find Ginger. They make a blood pact because it was a good idea at the time I guess, and Brigitte gets infected with the PMS, then she and Sam start trying to find a cure for lycanthropy again. I really don't understand the werewolf sub-plot or why they keep trying to force-fit it into a film that's obviously about the natural progression of a woman's menstrual cycle.

 Anyway, Ginger kind of eviscerates Sam  and tries to get Brigitte to feed on him with her, but she won't because the PMS hasn't yet taken hold of her mind. This upsets Ginger, now fully transformed into the Period Beast, and turns the sisters against one another, ending the film tragically with Ginger's death by Brigitte's hand.

 The thing about Teen Wolf (I mean, Ginger Snaps) is that, while entertaining and all-around well made, it's built around themes that someone who isn't a teenage girl with an oddly co-dependent relationship with their sister would be able to fully relate to. It's a niche film that doesn't work well as a horror movie, a werewolf movie, or a teenage drama, but does work well for being just what it is; a very specific combination of all three, with dark comedy strewn all the way through. It's not the best werewolf movie. But it is a movie with some werewolves in it. And, at the end of the day, isn't that all that really matters? Isn't it?

On a scale of one to ten, I give it ""Jesus Christ on a bicycle.""",1416268800,,2886,4.814141414141414

1634471,4,B00005NKSD,"Scream Factory continues its campaign to preserve the overlooked classics of horror with its high-definition release of Ginger Snaps Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack Special Edition. On the surface, the movie is a wonderful addition to the werewolf sub-genre that is rarely toyed with. Dig deeper and you find commentary on the difficulties girls face as they journey into womanhood. It should be required viewing for every male so they can form a sense of empathy for their female friends and family.

Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger Fitzgerald (Katharine Isabelle) are sisters and the best of friends. Theyre also the town outcasts and parade their obsession with death in front of their classmates, teachers, and family. As they walk home one evening, Ginger is attacked by a ravenous beast.

Her wounds heal at an astounding rate and she soon realizes that her body is undergoing two very extraordinary changes. One is fairly normal for all teenage girls: the arrival of her menstrual cycle. The second change is an ever-accelerating transformation into a werewolf. Can Brigitte save Ginger from her insatiable bloodlust before she fully turns into a voracious creature of the night?

Ginger Snaps Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack Special Edition is presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.78:1) accompanied by 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo Sound. The video perfectly captures an independent flavor through autumn hues and a grainy real film look absent in many movies today. Viewers will find themselves surrounded by the frightening sounds of growling beasts and other eerie disturbances.

As is usual with most Scream Factory releases, Ginger Snaps Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack Special Edition comes loaded with an exhaustive amount of bonus material. New interviews with actors Emily Perkins and Jess Moss, Make-up Effects Artist Paul Jones, Composer Mike Shields, and more can be found. Audio commentaries with Director John Fawcett and Writer Karen Walton are included. We also get deleted scenes with optional commentary by John Fawcett and Karen Walton, cast auditions and rehearsals, a theatrical trailer, and TV spots. A Creation of the Beast featurette and video presentation of the New Women in Horror Panel Discussing Ginger Snaps rounds out a robust batch of great extras.

The version of the movie featured on the Ginger Snaps Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack Special Edition is Unrated. Theres a lot of graphic violence and gore in this fine example of a Lycanthropy-centered film. I would consider it to be R rated because of strong language, adult situations, and scenes of female werewolf nudity. Gingers hairy upper torso makes a cameo appearance during the movies exciting and emotional conclusion.

Ginger Snaps Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack Special Edition is an essential addition to every werewolf fans home entertainment library. Rarely does a horror movie come along that infuses such immense chills and thrills while so beautifully capturing the pain and awkwardness we all feel journeying from childhood to adulthood. In my humble (yeah, right) opinion, this is the wolf-woman equivalent of the touching-yet-disturbing vampire tale Let the Right One In.

Ginger Snaps Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack Special Edition is available right now here.",1410998400,7,3251,5.252408477842004

1634480,5,B00005NKSD,"Movies as metaphors (that is a movie whose plot discusses a topic while not exactly using the original idea as the plot) work either extremely well or fall flat on their face. I can't recall a movie as metaphor ever just sort of working. When they fail they do so miserably. When they succeed they just make the movie that much better. Such is the case with GINGER SNAPS.

While most teen movies discuss the problems they all face (i.e. acne, dating, peer pressure) it is rare that they discuss things like puberty, especially the monthly changes that women experience. Sure it was touched on in CARRIE but never to the degree that it gets in this film. And here it combines the literal changes right beside the metaphorical ones.

Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) are two awkward sisters, outcast among the teens in their school. Obsessed with their kinship, given to that dark and brooding teen sensibility and a fascination with death, the two have made a pact to die together at 16. Ginger is there, Brigitte is a year away.

One night when they sneak out of the house, they are attacked by something that has been killing animals in their neighborhood. It turns out the creature that attacks them is a werewolf and while Brigitte survives intact, Ginger has shredded limbs and bite marks. As they run to escape the attacking werewolf they cross a street in front of a van that smashes the werewolf.

Returning home they notice immediately that Ginger's wounds have already begun to heel themselves. As the days progress more changes in Ginger become apparent: a sense of empowerment, a confidence that was lacking before, an aggressive nature against the bully that constantly taunted Brigitte and a certain amount of sexual appetite heretofore unseen. Unaware of most of the changes their mother (Mimi Rogers) explains it all as her daughter ""becoming a woman"". But Brigitte knows the truth of the matter.

As the bond between sisters begins to weaken while Ginger slowly changes, Brigitte finds a friend in Sam (Kris Lemche), a weed selling greenhouse owner whose van was the vehicle that killed the werewolf. He wants to know exactly what it was he killed and a picture Brigitte dropped has given him a clue. Their friendship grows while the sister's bond lessens, all in the hopes of finding a cure for Ginger before it is too late.

All of this is the meat and potatoes of the story but it is the garnish that makes this film work on all levels. The usual werewolf concepts are turned on their head in some cases and explored by the sisters in their search for a cure. An incredible amount of humor is mixed with the cautionary tale here that works so well that you find yourself fearful one moment and laughing in the next. Not since SHALLOW HAL has a tail garnered this much screen time. All of it jells to make a movie that is both frightening and fun at the same time.

Isabelle's performance here as the changing Ginger is wonderful as she transforms not from human to monster but from backwards semi-Goth to high school temptress. It's not just the make up and appearance that makes the change work so well it's the performance combined with that.

Equally up to the challenge is Perkins as the backwards Brigitte. The make up department had to work equally well to give her a plain Jane look, not quite homely but an appearance that doesn't give her a chance to stand out. Here too if it were not for the performance she offers the make up would not have worked.

I remember seeing this long ago when it first came out and not thinking much of it. I'm glad I had the chance to revisit this film. I found myself captivated by the movie drawn into the story and enjoying it much more than I did the first time around. Scream Factory has outdone themselves with the quality of the movie, offering a clean yet not overly done print that surpasses any offered before. The extras give us a glimpse into what the director, writer and crew were attempting here (and succeeding at) and are as enjoyable as the movie. In the end this is one to add to any growing horror fan collection and worth watching for all others. You won't be sorry you did so. Now it's time to see if Scream Factory will do the same with the sequel.",1409356800,2,4254,4.586842105263158

1634482,5,B00005NKSD,"Brigitte and Ginger are two teen sisters who only have each other. They are death obsessed, hate everyone they know, and their childhood suicide pact is starting to become a subject of serious discussion. But everything changes for them one Fall, when older sister Ginger gets her first period at the same time that their town is being plagued by vicious werewolf attacks on neighborhood dogs. It's not long before Ginger is attacked too, and when she survives, she begins to change. As her problem worsens, Ginger becomes more appealing and also more powerful, and soon the real problem becomes Brigitte's. Ginger's aggressive, sexual, violent and possessive sides break free, and Brigitte must do her best to reign in her sister until she can find a cure with the help of the school's drug dealer and some creative thinking.

Ginger Snaps, starring Emily Perkins as Brigitte, Katherine Isabelle as Ginger, Mimi Rogers as their clueless mother, and Kris Lemche as drug dealer Sam, was released in 2000 (I seriously thought it was a little older; has a very 90's look to it, but I guess it was pretty close) and has been a cult fave ever since, spawning 2 sequels (which I have yet to see in their entirety) and a lot of positive word of mouth among horror fans everywhere. This film is definitely two things, a werewolf movie and a female coming of age film, both with a feminist slant. Don't let that scare you off. Yeah, a lot of it is pretty man-haterish, but thankfully, the character of Sam, even though he's a drug dealer (and around this time, these kinds of films loved to make the school drug dealer the dreamy, secretly good guy), does a bit to not make all males look like total creeps. It's enough to save the film from going overboard with the anti-male stuff. One also might thing, after a few minutes into it, that, ""Oh god, this is going to be a movie about bickering, emo teens being overly dramatic about EVERYTHING!"" Well, it actually manages to avoid going down that hole too. Again, it skirts the edge, but never goes over to the point of not being enjoyable as a genuinely great horror film. This is probably because the werewolf attack comes up pretty quick in the film, and after that these girls are dealing with a real problem, and not just, ""Oh, life totally sucks, just because."" So, yeah, at first, coming into Ginger Snaps, some red flags might go up, but the film never really goes down those roads you may be feeling wary of. Instead, it proves to be a really good film with a very interesting twist on the werewolf subgenre, a subgenre many folks feel is mostly not very good (I tend to disagree, but whatever). The visuals are cool(this isn't the tame, PG-13 kind of horror, this is the unrated kind), genre-fave Katherine Isabelle is always hot, the acting is great, the story is well done... it's a really, really great movie! I don't know what the general consensus is on the sequels, but I definitely wanna check them out when they come to Blu-Ray.

Speaking of the Blu-Ray, this is another great release from Scream Factory that is loaded chock full of extras. As Bonus Features go, this is what Blu-Ray should always be like. It's inexcusable when it isn't. ""Ginger Snaps"" comes with trailers and TV spots, a production art gallery, two very informative commentaries (one with director John Fawcett, the other with writer Karen Walton, who does come off as not a big fan of the male sex at times, ha), deleted scenes with optional commentary, auditions with the film's two main stars, an effects featurette, a panel of female writers and filmmakers discussing the film, and most importantly, an excellent featurette about the making of the film that is loaded with interviews from cast and crew!

1634486,3,B00005NKSD,"Ginger Snaps is a cult classic that I never checked out until recently. It's enjoyable for its dark humor, stylish cinematography, and cool music. The gore is tame, subplots are left unresolved, and some of the acting is sub-par, but it's good for a watch.

The Blu-ray looks decent but should look a lot better. It's marred by edge enhancement and compression issues that Shout! Factory are notorious for, and for whatever reason they refuse to correct these problems. All of their releases have poor encoding and they ignore complaints. It's gotten to the point where horror Blu-ray fans hope that other labels get their favorite horror films (like the upcoming Dolls release).",1408233600,2,679,5.008849557522124

1634495,5,B00005NKSD,"MOVIE REVIEW: Canadian horror opens in the prefab suburban neighborhood of Bailey Downs where some kind of wild animal dubbed the Beast Of Bailey Downs  is killing the local dogs. But, Bailey Downs is also home to the emotionally troubled teenage Fitzgerald sisters, Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) and Brigitte (Emily Perkins). The two sisters have a bizarre fascination with death, they recreate death scenes and photograph themselves in different methods of demise, as well as have a suicide pact. But, the older Ginger is starting her menstrual cycle and when the sisters are out one night looking to kidnap the dog of local mean girl, Trina (Danielle Hampton), Ginger has her period and the blood attracts The Beast, a wolf-like creature that attacks and savages her before its run over in pursuit of the girls by local drug dealer, Sam (Kris Lemche). But, Gingers wounds start to heal soon after and within days her behavior starts to become more and more aggressive and the anti-social Ginger starts transforming into a flirtatious high school vamp. But, an increased sexual libido and interest in boys isn't the only thing growing as she is also starting to sprout thick hair in interesting places and a tail not to mention shes developed an appetite for the neighborhood dogs. Now Brigitte fears for her sister and turns to Sam, the only other witness to have seen the Beast, to try to help her save Ginger from becoming a monster. But as Gingers behavior becomes more and more dangerous and her nails and teeth are starting to grow and sharpen, will it be Brigitte and Sam that need saving?

Director John Fawcett, who co-wrote along with Karen Walton, creates a moody and sometimes gruesome tale that uses lycanthropy as an obvious metaphor for coming of age and the development of sexual urges but, despite the obviousness, he works it quite well into his horror flick that not only reminds us of the confusion of our teens but, provides plenty of chills and thrills as well. He populates his flick with characters that come across as real teens and not caricatures and only the sisters parents (Mimi Rogers and John Bourgeois) seem to be more your stereotypical, clueless adults but, it serves the story to have them oblivious to Gingers changes with mom happily babbling about how her daughter is a woman now and dad not wanting to hear about all the bloody details. Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins both really come through and give good performances as they basically carry the movie. Both women portray their respective transformations appropriately with Isabelle going from angry Goth girl to sexual predator to monster quite well, giving Ginger both an air of danger ready to explode and a sympathetic sadness of a young girl whos becoming something thats beyond her control. Perkins takes the shy girl used to hiding behind her more protective big sister, and turns her into a strong willed young woman ready to both fight the monster her sister is becoming but, at the same time, save her as shes not willing to give up on her despite Gingers increasing homicidal tendencies. A major part of why the film works is because of the performances Fawcett gets out of his leading ladies. Add to that his mix of teen angst movie and bloody horror flick with a dash of satiric humor and you get a very underrated flick that is considered a cult classic by many myself included. Ginger Snaps is not perfect, its slow paced at times and while that gives time for character development, it also takes it a while to get to its tense and bloody last act. The make-up FX are a little rubbery but, I still prefer the practical approach over CGI any day.

DISC REVIEW: I am so very happy that this cult classic has finally been given the love it deserves by the awesome folks at Scream Factory. This label just keeps delivering these wonderful editions of horror cult classics and giving fan favorites and obscure guilty pleasures the respect they deserve with pristine restored prints and engaging extras. Ginger Snaps is finally presented in its Anamorphic Widescreen glory (1.78:1) and has a nice DTS 5.1 sound mix. I don't have the best sounds system but, it sounded really good to me and the picture was clear and had only some mild graininess in some of the darker scenes but, this is a low budget horror movie and that is just fine. The colors are rich but, not over-saturated so, they look natural and the picture is certainly better quality then any other presentation before it. There are some nice featurettes and deleted scenes along with commentary and new interviews from director and co-writer John Fawcett and Karen Walton as well as leading lady Emily Perkins. Obviosuly the presence of star Katharine Isabelle is sadly missing but, Scream Factory claims communication with the actress representatives went unanswered. Too bad. Otherwise this is a must buy for fans of this Canadian cult classic horror.",1405641600,2,4925,4.839857651245552

This entire movie is about the horrors girls go through during puberty, represented by the changes that occur after a werewolf bite. The movie has some jump moments but is more for those who truly appreciate the horror genre than those who are just looking for a reason to inch closer to the person sitting next to them.

Pros:
1) Excellent casting
2) Unique spin on werewolf story
3) Well shot

Cons:
1) Story element of teenage girls being fx masters was a little much that seems to creep into too many horror films.
2) Committed the unforgivable sin of the werewolf head only being able to snarl instead of truly emote.  Whatever happened to changing heads for different expressions.
3) Teeth are too big for mouth to close.  This is more exasperated in the 2nd and 3rd movies (especially 3rd).",1400025600,,559,4.616161616161616

1634523,4,B00005NKSD,"I love werewolf horror but I have to admit there is a real lack of good werewolf movies out there. A lot of them are acquired taste or just end up falling flat. That wasn't the case with Ginger Snaps though. Despite a small budget its still an excellent horror movie that breaks the mold that has plagued past and current horror releases. Rather than introduce a bunch of unlikable stereotypes then immediately start killing them off; we actually get an original premise that has a plot and characters. Sounds funny to say that about a monster movie but it really is absorbing. The strongest part of the movie is probably the acting. The whole cast did a good job portraying their roles but the real starts of the show were Perkins and Isabelle who played the macabre obsessed Fitzgerald sisters.

The Fitzgeralds are the social outcasts of their school but their lack of friends doesn't weigh them down because of their very close (and believable) sisterhood. After a late night prank takes an unexpected horrific turn Ginger (Isabelle) is cursed with lycanthropy. As time goes by Ginger's attitude and appearance change drastically. While Ginger shrugs it off as puberty Brigitte (Perkins) believes it to be something else. Terror slowly unfolds as Ginger becomes more erratic with Brigitte desperately trying to put everything back to normal. All the while their hilariously inept parents are oblivious to what is happening to their daughters even as bodies begin to pile up toward the end. As bad as that is it only gets worse with full moon which is only days away.

The movie held my attention to the end and the main cast was great. The effects are pretty impressive given the overall budget of the movie. The beast itself is pretty terrifying in some scenes which is owed to good cinematography. Though there are times when the effects and werewolf look very fake. Though that is how it is for virtually all werewolf movies, but monster fanatics have learned to appreciate. Its a good horror flick with a strong cast, good plot, and some nice gore layered on top. Arguably its one of the best werewolf movies ever made.",1395273600,6,2127,4.7771739130434785

The undercurrent of puberty issues, the angst and parental problems, it all fit together so well. Honestly, the creepiest parts of the movie were the mother hahahaha. She was just so out there. Anyway, I will now be looking for the other movies in this series- and I will definitely be recommending this to friends, family, strangers, aliens, whoever I run into.

1634584,5,B00005NKSD,"Every horror fan gets tired of the same mindless recaps with vampires, werewolves, ghosts and zombies. There are so many flicks made after a big hit, but they just don't ""get it"" quite the same. Ginger Snaps is thankfully a good werewolf offering for a change, not something else that's cheesy and a wolf man rip off. While not necessarily a one of a kind that's so shockingly different and unique it should make history, it does manage to breathe new life into a sub-genre so doused with repetitiveness it's been sinking a long while.
Bridgette and her sister Ginger are Goths, big time. They're the typical teenage outcasts who find everything at school stupid and ignore their parents, instead preferring to make it through dinner rolling their eyes at their mother's comments. Their father is a clueless dad who is the more submissive of the relationship, while the mother stands out as one wackedly weird authority figure. Her enthusiasm at the oddest moments made me raise an eyebrow or two, and although this strange subplot isn't explored, it's there to add yet another unusual layer.

Tragedy - to them anyway - strikes. At fifteen Ginger has finally gotten her period. Bridgette, still blissfully dry, doesn't adapt too well to her sister's changes. That night they're out walking when a large werewolf comes out of nowhere and delivers a nasty, vicious, fun-to-watch attack. The girls obviously think it's a dog, and naturally don't get help when Ginger starts healing a little too quickly. Fast forward to a few more changes and Ginger sporting sleazy outfits and obtaining a massive sex drive, and you have a freaked out Bridgette who's desperate to save her sister before it's too late. But too late for what? Her turning into a werewolf and eating the town, or her just growing up and apart from her dark haired sibling and sampling boys and real life?

 Where Ginger Snaps stands up the tallest is in its unique social commentary, different ""out there"" story, and exciting exploration of things rarely touched upon. Werewolf legend and the change stand in for the coming of life for women and the hormonal punches they're delivered. I'd say its original and one of a kind, but nothing really is these days. In fact, I read a short story when I was a teenager where the change is also associated with lycanthropy in a young lady. Either way, it's more cool to see a movie about it, especially when they chose two Goth girls to deliver the piece.

The pace is strong and healthy; it begins with massive eye candy - pictures of various suicides and murders of the two girls in question for a school project. Their over the top way of responding to the teacher and it's delivery was laughable - great stuff! From there we get a major attack, blood here, blood there, changes here, changes there, finished with a serious, dramatic ending. Ginger Snaps wasn't just about morbid comedy, it also explored loss, sister dependency, and the reluctance to change.

On the acting side, Bridgette is played well by Emily Perkins. Her look and personality have the Goth thing down real well, although I've always thought she widened her eyes a bit too much, looking like she's overacting. She did it in IT, she did it here, and she does it with the sequels. Katherine Isobel looks gorgeous as sibling Ginger, heating up the movie with each scene, especially when she starts prancing around like some kind of sex goddess. Sorry, no nudity though, but damn close. Drug dealer werewolf assistant Sam does his thing and was a favorite of mine. He had the look and personality to keep my eyes glued.

John Fawcett, as the director, proved he has talent - good use of the steady cam and screwed up angles. He needs more work to show us what else he can do. The detailed and creative script co-written by both he and  Karen Walton is thankfully devoid of many glaring plot holes and inconsistencies. It's never mindless but it IS fun, while speaking clearly about issues that can matter and aren't spoken up nearly enough. This wasn't another tale glamorizing the high school experience, but instead displayed it in more realistic light.

Despite all the praise, Ginger Snaps is speckled with flaws. A big gripe was the boyfriend of Ginger - or should I say bed buddy? It being a sexually transmitted disease was mildly interesting but executed the right way. His whole subplot thing seemed stupid; I didn't enjoy any of his scenes and saw no point. It seemed too easy, and didn't wrap up with a worthy conclusion. Also, didn't he seem to change faster than Ginger, or is it just me? And as yet another thing, the 'cure' seemed too unrealistic. How would Sam instantly know that, be able to get it, know how to use it, and then have it work? The odds are slim.

 The werewolf itself wasn't anything amazing, as low budget clearly held the highest influence. It almost looks like an inflated hairless rat, and not much screen time is spent on this odd offspring of the lycanthrope legend. Still, the monstress isn't the same as other movies, so it's easily a forgivable slight.

Ginger Snaps is a genre fan's orgasm waiting to happen. Blood, gore, sex appeal, an original enough take on an old  favorite, dramatic attacks, and a depressing ending - worth more than one watch.",1379635200,,5268,4.720348204570185

It's an awesome film and I think it was wonderfully done. Bravo!",1375833600,,354,4.661290322580645
1634655,4,B00005NKSD,"This story was a nice change from the old reliable werewolf standard of male dominated roles as the beast. The story was not deep nor was it superficial to the point of not having any substance to it. The movie was written to draw the attention of the younger crowd of movie goers, but it has enough substance to cross generational divides and not a turn off to anyone under 70.

I first noticed Perkins (Brigitte) and Isabelle (Ginger) when the two were working on DaVinci's Inquest (Canadian version of CSI sort of) where Perkins was a regular for many episodes and Isabelle made at least a few guest apperances. Both girls played call girls with Perkins working the streets and Isabelle working at an escort service. I was impressed with there acting in the 04 and 05 seasons (or there abouts) and have seen both several times since. They both performed their tails off in this movie with very believable roles as high school girls doing weird and strange things and then to express such raw anger and aggression (Ginger for the most part) to the point of I'd steer clear of these two in the hallway.

The creature started out looking cool with the short and fleeting glimpses that we were fed and we weren't given a real good look until very near the end of the movie. When I did get a good look at the werewolf I was very disapointed at how plastic and fake it looked so it took a little away from the story, but not much since they waited until the end to give us a good look.

All in all this was a well produced girl version werewolf that kicked rear with the biggest credits going to Perkins and Isabelle for their performances and to the director for getting so much out of these girls.

1634691,4,B00005NKSD,"Ginger Snaps, in and of itself, is a decent, but not great, horror movie. What makes it stand out is two things: first, the way it tried to tie something as horrific as becoming a werewolf into something as human as a girl growing into a woman. It may seem like a rather obvious comparison, but it's done in a tongue-in-cheek way that makes the movie entertaining. Where the movie really shines is with it's two leads. Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle are two actresses that are far more talented than either has ever gotten real credit for. Emily is great as the awkward younger sister who has to take matters into her own hands, and Katharine shines as the older, tougher sister that the movie essentially revolves around. If you can watch this and figure out how Katharine Isabelle never became a huge star please explain it to me? She's hot as HELL, and a really talented girl.",1358812800,,885,4.572327044025157
1634692,5,B00005NKSD,"For Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) and Brigitte (Emily Perkins) Fitzgerald, life in their suburban hometown is a vast and meaningless void. That all changes on the night of Ginger's first period. While out walking, the girls are attacked by a ""wild dog"" and Ginger is left badly mangled. She survives but somehow she is...different. Her moods swing and her body is responding to these changes in different ways. Now, as her new taste for life and her craving for flesh escalates, little sister Brigitte is in race against time to try and save her sister before the next full moon where Ginger could be changed forever as well as save their town from something far deadlier than her sister's first heavy flow day.

 I've known about this movie since 2000 when Artisan Entertainment sold it as just another entry in their generic line of straight-to-video titles. It wasn't until Jennifer's Body came along and I started to draw parallels between the two movies that I finally decided to give Ginger her long overdue day in court.

Both stories have familiar themes. Both involve a pair of young girls, one of them ""dies"" and comes back ""cursed"" while the other watches as her friend/sister goes from normal to monstrous, classmates and neighbors die and, in the end, the weaker one becomes victorious but must commit a final act of mercy to set her loved one free as well as getting ""marked"" in the process. But where Jennifer was the popular cheerleader, here both Ginger and her little sister Brigitte are like Needy. They're outcasts due to their inability to conform with the ""happy, shinny people and only have each other to depend on. Once Ginger begins to change, her popularity increases amongst the guys while she slowly starts turning her back on her sister. In the end, the underlining story to both movies is really the death of a lifelong bond which, for many of us, is all to tragically true.

Casting here was pitch perfect as both Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins really do look like they could be related. They are both gifted actresses and I can only hope to see more of their work expand past the Ginger trilogy. Mimi Rogers (Lost In Space) provides an equally strong comedic relief as the Fitzgerald's loving albeit totally clueless mother.

The writing here, as in Jennifer's Body, was well written utilizing a snappy rhetoric that helps prevent both films from being dated especially here in Ginger Snaps being that it is now over thirteen years old and still feels as if it was made just yesterday. Longevity is key to helping any movie sustain throughout the years. Case in point, look how old and dated Clueless feels now.

Possibly the best thing about this movie is the actual werewolf.  Given that this is a low budget, Indie movie, there is no CGI effects here.  All of the creature FX was done on camera using the old fashioned make up and appliances and the end results are pretty terrifying.  There's something sadly missing today when studios insist on using Imaginary Reactions from the actors in lieu of actually giving them something tangible to work with.

Unfortunately, this neo teen classic, like the bigger budgeted aforementioned follower, went under nearly everybody's radar and ended up performing dismally at the box office. As of right now, various studios here in the U.S. mishandled the DVD release. Currently, First Look Pictures owns the rights to Ginger Snaps but they are releasing the same full screen, bare bones edition Artisan used thirteen years ago meaning a cropped picture and a horrible 2.0 sound. There is a Canadian Collector's Edition with an anamorphic 1.78 widescreen disc, 5.0 surround sound, and loaded with special features available still but they are becoming increasingly harder to find and even more pricey. Personally, I own a copy of the even more rarer Ginger Snaps: The Trilogy box set that includes the Canadian editions of all three films. I was fortunate enough to find it for $30 at a Half Price Books. Just take a look at what the Amazon Marketplace sellers are asking for this OOP set.  For the casual viewer just interested in seeing what all the fuss is about, get one of the current copies being sold.  But if you seriously want to add this to your collection, I say go the extra mile and the extra buck and seek out the Collector's Edition.  You'll be thankful you did once you see all it has to offer.",1358553600,3,4389,4.774406332453826
1634693,5,B00005NKSD,"One word is all it takes to describe this box set and that is AMAZING.  Finally, all three chapters in the Ginger Snaps series together in one box set and, best of all, the original is in its full 1.78 aspect ratio that director John Fawcett originally intended his film to be seen and loaded with tons of special features including two commentaries, deleted scenes, a ""making of"" featurette, rehearsal footage, casting auditions, the trailer, tv spots, and more unlike the dry bare bones ""full screen"" edition that Artisan Entertainment put out back in 2000. Unfortunately it seems this set has gone out of print and was apparently only sold in Canada under their Seville company logo but I strongly advise any fan of Ginger's to seek this out.

1634696,4,B00005NKSD,"Ginger Snaps is one of the more interesting horror films out there.  Kudos goes out to the writers for spending a considerable amount of time building a really elaborate and well-executed storyline.  While there's several portions that are sort of hard to sit through due to hearing about female problems such as menstruating in alarmingly gross and realistic detail, the film succeeds in keeping an interesting pace containing a werewolf-like creature that haunts the woods and encourages the people to stay indoors.

It's about two teenage sisters that probably look older than the characters they play, but when one of the sisters is on the receiving end of a surprise werewolf attack one night, she quickly discovers that what she tries to convince herself are normal, sexualized sensations for a teenager going through puberty later than most, is actually an entirely different and more frightening matter- the thick hair growing on her body is a sign that she's becoming a beast.  Her desire for blood fuels her to do the craziest things to the boys she meets, and even the janitor in one segment later on.

Plenty of dogs get killed in this movie.  The impudent cheerleader that feels the need to criticize the two sisters while playing sports outside eventually regrets it.  The mother of the sisters is probably my favorite actress in the movie.  She constantly defends her daughters as going through typical female problems (even though the husband seems sort of confused and grossed out which is hilarious) but eventually all these issues have to be tossed out the window as the realization that her daughters are involved in something more extraordinary comes to light.  The amount of blood and the way it's utilized is pretty intense too.

I really like the relationship between the two daughters.  They fight like normal sisters whether it be boy troubles causing tension or because one sister is trying to get through to the stubborn other during difficult to comprehend dilemmas, but like good sisters will do, they always stick up for each other even during the worst of times.  Honest writing there.

Overall, perhaps the movie drags for about 15-20 minutes near the middle, but by the end I was REALLY terrified of the things that were taking place.  I guess another problem is that the cure for the werewolf transformation was sort of sloppy and rushed with little in the way of a convincing explanation, but other than these minor quibbles, I was really impressed.  Great atmosphere, even better storytelling, and a wonderful movie.",1355529600,,2553,4.974117647058823

Snappy acting

A couple of sisters (Emily Perkins, Katharine Isabelle) with vivid imagination are misunderstood.  One gets bit by a ""you know what"" and the fun begins. Naturedly this is mistaken for a different type of change in life.

All the elements are there:
Caring (haven't got a clue) parents.
Blond with nasty attitude antagonist.
Drug dealer that does werewolf studies on the side.
Lots of neighbors with tasty pets.
Occasional gratuitous sex scene (the camera breaks away before the sweaty parts.)
You get the idea.

Will a cure be found and they all live happily ever after or is it curtains for the victims(s)?

The movie does have its unique way of mixing the standard elements to come out with the average ""nipper"" story.  The only social redeeming value is the sisters' fidelity.

Ginger Snaps 2 Unleashed (2004)
Living off reputation of Ginger Snaps

The original ""Ginger Saps"" had a unique approach to biting and sisterly love. I will not go into detail incase you missed the original. I would also suggest you watch the original first.

This movie however is just a run of the mill standard blood and guts clich. You have the common wierdies and the standard abuse, a few tasty and tasteless scenes. Lots of anticipation and a little action. The decease sister plays very minor parts with no direction. And ""Ghost"" Tatiana Maslany is practicing to be the new Patty McCormack (""The Bad Seed"" 1956).

They even run the obligatory ""stay in the car"" scene to ground.

A third movie is made ""Ginger Snaps Back"" they get back on the track of two sisters. It is much better and looks like they threw some money and thought into it. You can skip ""Ginger snaps Unleashed!"" and it will have no impact on viewing ""Ginger Snaps Back""

------------------------------------------------------------
Ginger Snaps Back - The Beginning (2004)
Beware the red and the black

Third time is the charm. This is the third movie ""Ginger Snaps Back"" in the ginger snaps series and in my opinion the best. The first ""Ginger Snaps"" of course always get the privilege of being unique as a different more caring wolfy sisters. The second ""Ginger Snaps 2"" however was nothing more than an exploitation film relying on the reputation of the first film.

They seem to have found more money for this prequel and took acting lessons as this film was beautiful and well organized. There were a few overdone ""Blair Witch"" type scenes but they did not distract form the over all feel. It was a bit darker but would have been impossible to make otherwise. You may also notice that they had to go out of their way to show the sisters periodically as the story and some of the other actors were acting rings around them.

During the early exploration of the continent (1815) a group of people built a fort on the edge of the known world. Through a series of misfortunes and events two sisters Bridget and Ginger are lead to the fort by a mysterious native. There they encounter some odd characters and something unspeakable howling outside the fort.

Is it safer inside or out side the fort?
What is seen in the future and must it come true?
Is the bond of sisters stronger than any adversity?

1634740,4,B00005NKSD,"For those that love horror movies, a good werewolf movie can be hard to find. Newer movies of this type tend to show too much wolf, and make the creatures look like cartoons with an overuse of CGI. Older movies often just look like what they were, puppets or people in costume. Getting the audience to suspend disbelief and build a relationship with the characters can also be a monumental challenge in a werewolf film- where the concept is easily made absurd. However, Ginger Snaps really does an excellent job on all challenges.

The look of the actual werewolf errs toward the side of the old, but not in a distracting way. Also, much of the movie is about the transformation- and the effects team does a great job to that display. With the transformation goes the character development, which I would describe as seamless and involving. There is also a tongue in cheek element, which adds the perfect dash of dark humor. If it weren't for the slightly cheaper looking werewolf and a few small plot holes, this would be a five star rating. However, I give it a very solid 4 stars and recommend it for any fan of the genre.",1354233600,,1125,4.541871921182266

1634747,1,B00005NKSD,"Two very close sisters in high school dream of committing suicide.
One turns into a warewolf, goes on a killing spree, and her dorky sister
sticks by her side the whole time.
The main vehicles that are supposed to induce terror in the veiwers
are hours of hyperventilating, bug eyed, stupified behavior in the
sister as she watches her sister transform into a warewolf, and
many gallons of bright red paint liberally splashed on everything.
After watching this, a strange numbness has set into me, as if
I am supposed to be scared, horrified, ANYTHING, but there is only
a void of time wasted on this absolute nothing.

I am guessing people liked it here because it shows two troubled, suicidal
high school girls, but they aren't appealing in any way,
have no personalities, act stupid and bland, aren't attractive,
don't dress well, and in general I would have to think that
psychiatric care would have been their best option.

While I do understand there
is a market for movies about troubled teen girls, loners making their way
through what can be the horrific atmosphere of a modern high school,
this movie doesn't take advantage of the setting by having more competent
actors with more to work with for a story.

These girls seem to be deficient mentally from the word go, the way they
stumble around and stare blankly at everyone who even makes the mistake of
trying to say something to them.

They think they are cool rebels, in their own little cool world of drab
Adam's Family style clothes, doing their best to imitate Wednesday Adams' style
of deadpan, dead-eyed morose freakiness, only Wednesday would occasionally come out with
some humorously biting sarcasm, put down or comeback. These girls never say anything
to give the slightest indication of any type of brain activity, as if the fumes from
all the red paint paint liberally splashed around the walls of their family home (oh,
that's right, it's supposed to be blood) have destroyed all their brain cells.

The most interesting thing about this, and I use the word interesting loosely, is
how the two sisters are almost joined together throughout the movie like siamese twins.
The complete devotion of the two girls to each other and the total exclusion of the
outside world by them, made me wonder if there was some sort of incestuous lesbian subplot
that would emerge, which would have at least brought a bit of interest in an otherwise
banal, amateurish and agonizingly boring movie.
But alas, it was not to be. That would have added a bit of novelty to this total yawner.

Apparently the devotion of the younger homely dowdy sister is the result of not having a bit
of independence of spirit or thinking or the ability to ""get a life"". Her only means of
self expression is to hyperventilate when her sister turns into a werewolf
in a way that would normally send a person into asphixiation.

No plot, acting abilities or character developement is displayed at any time.",1328832000,3,2943,4.770137524557957

Drama, drama, drama, sister has a final conflict with the werewolf.

First, it deals with 2 sisters obsessed with death and want to commit suicide together. It is very unique and can relate to many teenagers going through puberty and high school. i found this movie as an instant classic. The acting is quite good. But the downside of the movie is the werewolf. It doesnt look much realistic, but thats okay, because the story makes up for it all the way.

1634799,2,B00005NKSD,"That's the essential point being made with this movie.  It's a ""grrl power"" themed message that females can be werewolves too.  Who'd have thought women would ever shatter THAT glass ceiling.  Somebody's not minding the constant ""patriarchal oppression"" of women in society if we're allowing them to turn into fictional raging blood thirsty beasts from hell.

Or was this meant as a metaphor for what feminism has turned women into?

I'll add, Katharine Isabelle (Ginger) is a very good actress, she stole the movie.",1309305600,3,516,5.095238095238095
1634800,4,B00005NKSD,"OK, I'll come clean: I think ""An American Werewolf in London"" is the best werewolf movie ever made, and one of the greatest horror movies of all time (although it's just a 'horror' movie about like ""Pulp Fiction"" is just an action movie).  For me, ""American Werewolf"" redefined what could be done in the horror genre -- a really smart script that mixes dark humor (remember the scene in the theater?) with darker images of blood spray and savagery.  The director of ""American Werewolf,"" John Landis, already had a big hit with John Belushi and ""Animal House.""  And then, after ""American Werewolf,"" he was tagged to direct what became the most famous music video of all time:  Michael Jackson's ""Thriller.""

So what's all this have to do with ""Ginger Snaps?"" Well, a lot.  This movie feels very much like ""American Werewolf"" at first.  I particularly liked the way John Fawcett (co-writer and director) assumed the viewer has a brain, and has already seen ""American Werewolf"" and/or some of its descendents.  We all get, right away, that there's a werewolf chewing on the neighborhood's dogs and, just a day or so later, that Ginger gets bitten and begins to have, uhh, issues.  But the quick and witty dialogue between Ginger and her sister, and the adept twisting of 'teener' movie cliches into something better (think ""Heathers""), just doesn't last -- to the detriment of the movie.  I got the feeling that someone (I dunno... maybe the producers and distribution folks sweating more about revenue than story & nuance?) insisted upon a more conventional horror film.  And so that's what we get, in the last half of the film.

The good news: The first half is smart and darkly funny, more often than not.  And in the second half, moving into a more traditional 'monster eats friends & family' mode, the special effects are surprisingly good, and not just for a low budget film.  I'm serious -- the FX are really good.  (Of course, the angry adolescents among us could scream about a scene or two where the latex is a bit too shiny, etc., but I'm not interested in that;  I think the special effects are excellent, all things considered.)

The bad news:  In the second half, I did find myself wishing for the wit, irony and genre-challenging elements that are so much a part of the movie's first 40 minutes or so.  But ... they really don't surface much in the movie's second half.  It's just another (but well done) werewolf movie from that point on.  But it is worth watching!

1634801,4,B00005NKSD,"The Fitzgerald sisters, Bridget and Ginger, live lives filled with unintentional dark humor. They're a morbid pair, outcasts at their school. They pass the time planning a joint suicide, exploring their options by faking their deaths and taking pictures of the results. When the next-door neighbor's dog is disembowled by an unknown predator, they find themselves completely unmoved. Nothing can move or shock these girls.

To ease their ennui and get a little revenge, the girls decide to kidnap the dog of a popular girl and school and fake its death, another victim of the thing that is eating household pets in the neighborhood. But when they arrive at the girl's house, the dog is already dead. Their fun ruined, they're about to leave when an enormous beast knocks them to the ground and makes off with Ginger. She manages to escape, but not without serious wounds. Remarkably, though, the injuries heal rapidly, leaving not a mark.

Ginger begins to change--hair on her chest, pain in her joints Unfortunately, Ginger has also just gotten her first period, and after a farcical discussion with the school nurse, decides that all the changes are due to her newly raging hormones. It isn't long, however, before the girls have to abandon that theory--it's not hormones, but lycanthropy that is causing all of Ginger's problems. Worse yet, she's had sex and passed it on to the boy she slept with.

This dual discovery puts Bridget on the hunt for a cure. With the help of a local druggie, Bridget turns monkshead, better known as wolfsbane, into an injectable form. She tries it on the boy, with success. But Ginger is further gone, and has already killed. She's bound to be caught; already, their parents have found fingers in the backyard. And Ginger is finding that life as a werewolf isn't so bad--she has a power that the rest of us outcasts can only dream of.

There's a reason why so many horror movies feature adolescent protagonists, beyond the obvious box office draw. Adolescence is a frightening time of transformation, and it's one of the jobs of horror movies to externalize our fears and turn them into fantastic creatures that we can explore and conquer in the safety of the theater. Puberty, sex, teenage ostracism--these are true fears, real world fears, the Ginger Snaps depicts. You can run from them, face them head on, or attack from the flank with dark humor and horror.

However, one is a bit hesitant while the other one is enamored by the thought of how great their suicides will be.  They are obsessed with death. The opening credits continue this obsession with suicide by showing stilled photographs of the girls positioned in many different suicide acts.  The Fitzgerald sisters are not exactly what you would call popular, they are outcasts.  One night Ginger is attacked by a wild dog and her world is never the same after that.

Ginger Snaps is another movie about werewolves and the hunger they crave.  However, this film is set apart from other werewolf movies and puberty is used as a representation for turning into a beast.  Brigitte is determined to find a cure for Ginger's ""illness"" while Ginger's ""illness"" is getting the best of her, her inhuman strength and appetite for `life'.  No matter how much Ginger's appetite for `life' gets them in trouble, Brigitte stands by her sister's side.  But it might cost her her own life, by Ginger's own hands (or say we say teeth).

While this movie didn't really provide any real horror it was overall entertaining and exciting.

1634827,5,B00005NKSD,"Ginger and Brigitte Fitzgerald are sisters, incredibly close and fascinated with death. They are also complete outcasts at their school because of their weird attitudes and photo projects of their mock deaths. There have been a rash of neighborhood dogs being killed, so Brigitte decides to play a joke on a bitchy classmate (who shoved her into a dead dog). The plan goes awry when the creature killing the dogs attacks Ginger seconds after getting her first period. Ginger survives the attack. Her wounds immediately start to heal at a rapid pace. After the attack, Ginger's behavior changes drastically: she shows interest in boys, smokes pot, exhibits extreme mood swings, and starts to physically change. Brigitte watches her sister in disbelief and is convinced she's turning into a werewolf. Can she convince her sister and find a cure before it's too late?

Anyone who knows me well knows that I go through obsessions with books and movies. I will reread or -watch things I really enjoy repeatedly over a period of months sometimes. This is one of my obsessions. This film has just enough camp/cheese, suspense, and good story to be the perfect movie. I love the fresh take on werewolves. I usually seriously hate werewolves because it reduces good characters to competing in pissing contests in the pack and being extremely moody and annoying (see the Anita Blake series and the Twilight Saga). Women are generally not in positions of power in the pack and are treated as inferior or as property, which really makes me angry. This film, thankfully, has no werewolf pack and has a fresh interpretation of werewolves. The Hollywood vision of werewolves transforming at the full moon and being defeated by silver bullets is abandoned. The focus is on the transformation of a teenage girl into a werewolf in the span of a month, as an allegory for womanhood and growing up. The animalistic behavior represents the bodily urges of a young woman. She becomes a different person, as one should in a transition from childhood to adulthood. This is shown physically through her slow transformation into a wolf. Brigitte, since she is still a child, is completely terrified by the transformation. She tries everything she can to stop it, but the advancement in the cycle of life is inevitable.

The acting is great. The sisters are completely believable and creepily close at the outset of the film. I personally related to the girls. Who didn't feel isolated or misunderstood in high school? Katharine Isabelle, as Ginger, carries the film well in her change in mood and demeanor as the film progresses. The effects are surprisingly well done, despite being an indie film. There is a lot of blood and gore, plus the deaths of about 4 dogs. The director opted to use prosthetics and makeup to achieve Ginger's transformation which I think worked wonderfully. CGI would have looked way too fake and dated the film. The changes are at first understated not even recognized by the characters. It's not until later in the film that the viewer realizes that the small changes have added up and drastically changed her appearance. I liked that she looked oddly beautiful even in the late stages of her change.

The main musical theme is so hauntingly beautiful, featuring a cello in the melody. Similar themes in the movie are nice, but there are some laughably cheesy moments because of other musical motifs. I think the cheesier moments were intentionally poking fun at the teen horror genre. The climactic face-off at the end of the film between Brigitte and werewolf Ginger was so suspenseful. The first time I watched it, I couldn't look away and I was on the edge of my seat.

There really isn't anything I didn' t like about Ginger Snaps. One can definitely see its effect in recent cinema, especially in Teeth and (unfortunately) Jennifer's Body. I think Ginger Snaps is what Jennifer's Body really wanted to be, but failed miserably. I hope the tradition of gynocentric horror films continues.",1287792000,3,3995,4.914074074074074

It is up to Bridgette to find a cure or stop Ginger before she gives in to her bloodthirsty new desires and becomes a snarling beast!

GINGER SNAPS is unquestionably one of the smartest, wittiest, and most unique werewolf offerings in recent Horror. The film's brilliant writing is only further enhanced by Emily Perkins and Katherine Isabelle as the Fitzgerald sisters, whose cynical performances truly bring the dark nature of the material to life in a hilarious but understated fashion. Like THE COMPANY OF WOLVES before it, GINGER SNAPS takes the cycle of the werewolf and uses it as a metaphor for the girls' transformation into womanhood. By leaving out cell phones or any other modern technology, dressing the cast in a generic wardrobe, and his use of sepia tones, director John Fawcett has given the picture a timeless quality that doesn't show a single sign of aging now one decade after its initial release. The mournful musical score also lends a classic Gothic sound that recalls the Universal monster movies of the 30's and 40's.

Due to obvious limitations when dealing with costuming and practical FX, it is rare to see a quadrupedal creature that isn't born out of computer animation. While the wolves in GINGER SNAPS are rather stiff and oddly-shaped, it is still refreshing to see a physical beast that the characters can interact for a greater impact and reaction on-screen.

GINGER SNAPS is a modern classic, and a shining example when it comes to creating a superb Horror film on a limited budget.

1634832,4,B00005NKSD,it took me a long time to see this movie and now i understand why the movie has the prasie it has. it is a very good horror film and more intelligent than most films in this catorgy. it is about two goth looking sisters obessed with death. one night the older sister is bitten by a werewolf and starts changing both in her persiollity and phyically.. in that aspect it is methpor for what women go thought at that stage in thir life.(at least i think they do) their are not too many flaws. it is just at the end when the sister turn in to the werewolf it degengrates in to a typicall werewolf film. but still if you call yourself a horror fan and having not watched this go and buy it now! or at leaset rent it,1281139200,2,710,4.042553191489362
1634833,5,B00005NKSD,"Two sisters that do everything togather suddenly find something wedging itself between them in the form of - lycanthropy. They ar eout one night, something happens that is hard to see, and the next thing you know there is a bad thing happening in te happy little sandbox these two suburbanite kids had managed to build for themselves. This leads to dark and dark moments, things happening that you don't expect, a run for a curative, and an ending you will like if you like your horror crual and your answers unanswered.

Ginger snaps is one of those movies that didn't have great ratings at first because it was different. It broke many of the ""werewolf rules"" when it came out and played, making some of the purist watchers a little angry. It also had something of a teen vibe, only the teen vibe involved teens getting picked off and a wolf runing on two legs and not being nice about what it liked to do. That was one of the things I liked about it and one of the things thta proved a nice point - if in doubt, turn to another country for your horror fix.

One of the things that helped this movie was the acting. The bond between the sisters was a buyable thing and, in pplot turns, it could have all kind of unhappy camper moments. It also allows for an ending you can't predict because you can't say if one sister can pull the trigger, if one can maw the other, or what exactly can happen.

Another thing that worked for the movie was the use of a good looking wolf that was kept out of the spotlight enough to keep you on your toes when it emerges. That doesn't mean there are not a lot of bad things here, either, or that there aren't an armada of memorable lines. The gore, the give; it is nice enough to cover up any flaws.

Basically, you have a movie that has gotten the love it should have gotten from fans that know horror, pushing the critic voice to the back of the line. That is what should happen, too, because people with an outlook are not always there to throw stones. And I don't profess to be some guru that can lead you to the West - I only give opinions and think you should research and see if you agree with the people that like the drippy, bloody, mean way that movies like this fall.

1634857,3,B00005NKSD,"This is a better than average horror film.  For sure it has all the necessary traits of a classic horror film, blood, gore, violence, and more, but it also has a decent plot.  I'm surprised by the depiction of teen smoking on their high school campus, but that's a side point.

These two sisters have this fascination with death.  They pose as dead people for countless photos then share them with their classmates.  However, when one is attacked by this unknown creature, their fascination with death becomes a fear of it.  The older sister gradually transforms into a werewolf so that by the end of the film she's completely lost her humanity.  This film borrows a little from ""An American Werewolf in London"" in that Ginger doesn't really want to be a werewolf but she has no choice.  Her sister teams up with a greenhouse gardener (who also grows marijuana) to concoct a remedy for the werewolf transformation.  However, by the end of the movie it's too late and Giger has completely ""snapped"" and goes on the killing spree one figures a werewolf would embark upon.  Oddly enough there is no law enforcement investigations into any of the killings, no nosy neighbors who try to find out what's killing their dogs

But as said above, this is not really a bad movie.  It's not for the faint of heart, but it does have a storyline one can follow.  That storyline is engaging enough to keep your interest throughout the film.  As with so many other films it won't win any awards, but it does reflect at least some thought on the part of the writers and producers.",1260489600,,1563,4.595667870036101

1634877,5,B00005NKSD,"i delayed wathing ginger snaps for years because of the dvd cover. it gave me the impression of some really cheesy 90's b movie and i didn't want to waste the time. but. a friend strongly recommended that i watch it, and thank god i did. this is one of the best paranormal movies i've seen.

the story is about two sisters and one night walking home, the elder, ginger, gets bitten by a 'dog'. slowly the bitten sister begins to change, in a social sense as well as a physical sense. she begins taking an interest in a boy she and her sister previously looked down upon, she distances herself from her sister, brigitte, with whom she shared a very close bond before the bite, and she even experiments with drugs. in addition to this her hair begins to change colour and she grows more of it all over her body. she even grows a tail. brigitte becomes concerned and looks into many possibilities, one of which is that her older sister was bitten by and is now changing into a werewolf. she then goes about trying to find a cure, while having to deal with ginger, who is getting cravings for blood and is changing into something that is less and less like the sister she was once so close with.

what mkaes this movie different than a lot of other paranoral horrors is that there is a really stong femenine voice present in both of the sisters. other than buffy, women play the wilting heroine in horrors, and in alot of other genres as well. not so in this movie. ginger has a very powerful personality throughout the whole movie. even before the change, she'd stick up for brigitte when she got picked on and would talk back to people who would speak against either her or her sister. after the change she exuded an even more pronounced air of self- confidence. she doesn't show doubt. brigitte on the other hand at first seems very timid and meek, which she might be, brigitte displays an inner strength that ginger lacks. she resists the temptation of power, which she would get if ginger bit her and she turned into a werewolf. she seems like a follower at the beginning, but she's just loyal.

something else that makes this movie interesting is that it's an allegory of puberty for girls. after ginger gets bitten, she also gets her period for the first time. then when she is reacting weird to being bitten by a werewolf, adults just assume she's acting so abnormal because 'its that time of the month' instead of seeing it for what it is. it's a great social commentary on how society tends to deal with women as something foreign and potentially scary, especially around menstruation. the funny thing was that it was women voicing these views. the mom just fluffs off ginger's moody behaviour as 'growing up', and the school nurse does the same thing when ginger tells her about her symptoms. all of the ginger snaps movies have some sort of feminist theme if you look for it, but this one is the most blatent and deals most directly with how as a society we choose to perceive women as foreign, evil, and abnormal.

even without the allergical reference this was an awesome movie. it was fast-paced and suspenseful. on my top five list for paranormal movies of all time!",1251849600,,3178,4.512152777777778

If you're just looking for straight up horror Ginger Snaps might not be the right film for you, it focuses more on the human side of werewolves and entertains more than it shocks. The story and the two lead actresses (Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins) are what make this movie great.

The US release of the DVD is pretty bare bones and only comes with the trailer as a special feature, but the Canadian edition has a commentary track and a ton of deleted scenes. One complaint I've noticed a few reviews is that the movie has a constant orange tint to it, they blamed it on the use of an orange lens in the camera that was used to film the movie... having seen the movie a few times on TV (IFC) I have to debunk this, the version played on television has absolutely no orange tint and the colors are great. I'm assuming that the orange tint must be due to a poor transfer or something, I own both the American re-release and the Canadian box set and the orange tint is way worse on the American release.",1241827200,2,1274,4.330543933054393

But I did want to encourage anyone who does like this movie to seek out the sequels.  The writing is better and the production values are as well, particularly in the third film (THE BEGINNING) set back in the American Frontier days.

I wonder if this was like the Mad Max series: the original MAD MAX was a cheap drive-in movie that they could afford to make at the time.

1634897,5,B00005NKSD,"""Ginger Snaps"" A Howling Good Time

""Ginger Snaps"" takes the old cautionary tale of Little Red Riding and turns it on its furry ear.  Instead of Lon Chaney Jr. howling at the moon and chasing poor unsuspecting girls through the woods - enter the Fitzgerald sisters, Ginger and Brigitte (Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins) two slightly morbid, teenage sisters entering puberty who are about to experience ""the curse,"" and put a whole new humorous lycanthropic spin on the phrase ""that time of month.""  Ginger has ""the bite"" put on her by a werewolf while walking through the woods with her sister.  She then begins to experience ""the change"" much to the horror of her younger sister Brigitte.  Ginger begins experiencing cramps, ill temper, hair in strange places, and a new found ""taste"" for boys much to the horror of Brigitte who must hide her sister's secret, clean up the mess, and find a way to help end the terrible curse before Ginger ""snaps"" again!

""Ginger Snaps"" is a horror at it's best. The film benefits greatly by a strong cast, particularly Perkins and Isabelle as the Fitzgerald sisters, Kris Lemche as a dope dealing, knight in shining armor/love interest, and Mimi Rogers - who is a real hoot playing a well meaning but ineffectual ""Beaver Cleaver"" house mom trying to help her teenage daughters deal with the trials of puberty.

Though Karen Walton and John Fawcett's script was written tongue in cheek - the film has many genuinely horrific moments.  There is more than enough blood, gore and entrails here to keep any bonafide horror fan happy.  That being said, because this Canadian film production had a tight budget, it relies primarily on acting, atmosphere and suspense building to deliver the scares - probably a plus rather than a minus.  Our lycanthrope is seen only in glimpses a la ""Alien"" until near the end of the film. Thankfully, the makeup and special effects it does employ are innovative and decently done.

Director John Hawcett does a fine job creating a dark chilling atmosphere.  He moves the plot at a good pace, deftly interweaving moments of horror and humour. Though the scares come fast and frequent, Fawcett wisely takes the time to give us glimpses into the amusingly macabre life and relationships of the Fitzgerald sisters.  Their situation may be fantastic and comic, but the Fitzgeralds, though misfits, are in many ways average teens, dealing with everyday teenage problems (problems with parents, teachers, peers, bullies, boys, etc.) and thus draw empathy from the audience. The gritty dialogue and snapshots of high school life help to underline this realism and contribute to the viewer's willing suspension of disbelief.

The only place where I felt the film didn't quite work was the ending which seemed  clich when compared to the innovativeness of earlier parts of the film.  I won't go into any in depth criticism and spoil it for those who haven't seen the film, but suffice it to say that perhaps the reason for this may have been that it was written with a sequel in mind (""Ginger Snaps"" ultimately became a trilogy).

As a caution, though definitely not gratuitous, some may feel that  the language, gore, nudity and explicit sexuality is over the top.

Though not perfect, ""Ginger Snaps"" is still the most innovative horrifying piece of  lycanthropic lunacy to come down the pike in decades.  I highly recommend it to fans of the genre. ""Ginger Snaps"" is a howling good time!

So begins a tale of two girls and their problems at the local high school. Ginger and Bridgette are the 'odd' ones at school, the school Goths and the people everybody always look upon with a bit of distaste. They think they're weird, but some of the guys think Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) is hot.

Of course, if the two girls didn't have their own problems at school to think about, there's been something killing the local dogs. Brigette (Emily Perkins) finds this out one day when a nasty little thing called Tina Sinclaire pushes her down at gym.

Right into a dead dog.

Ginger's had enough with Tina. She's the girl that drives her crazy, and she wants to do something about her. So, with the props left over from their 'Death and Suicide' school project video, they decide to play a prank on Tina, using her dog as a target.

When the girls get halfway there, Ginger has the most unexpected thing in her life:

Her period.

Both of the girls are a few years late at their periods, but that's not the thing they need to worry about.

When a nearby child spring-action toy moves, they know something's with them.

Then Ginger gets torn off into the forest.
-----

All in all, Ginger Snaps is a very, very good movie. It's taken an old genre and mixed it with a bunch of things teenagers go through: school life, personal problems with parents and fitting in, angst, relationships and all of that good stuff. Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins as Ginger and Brigette make amazing actors and they play their Gothic rolls personally, as if they were the real characters.

1634918,2,B00005NKSD,"Wow.  I heard so many good reviews for this movie but was blown away by how bad it is.  I just don't get it.  Maybe because it starts off with a good idea (that quickly evaporates) people got hooked by their first impressions?  The good idea is, as so many here have noted, equating changing to a werewolf with menarche.  But halfway through the movie that idea is dropped.  It seems like they director was also somehow attempting to tie lycanthropy to drug use, or maybe to teenage depression and suicide.  But there's no real follow through with that either.  It's like someone got a lot of ideas that seemed deep while they were doing drugs, but those ideas look really dumb to someone sober.  In the end, it all turns into a cheesy and boring horror flick.

None of the characters are likable, so I didn't care what happened to anyone.  And as with most cheesy, slasher pics there's little sympathy for the dead.  Even the mother has a disturbing idea about the father at one point that totally comes out of nowhere, causes you to lose all liking for her, and then is dropped just as meaninglessly.  Nothing that happens matters to the viewer.  It just drags on and on.  The main sister, Brigitte, is too stupid for words and you spend the last half of the movie yelling at her for her inaction and flubs.  The actress playing her has one annoying expression.  You can see it on the box cover.  Gaping mouth and bugged eyes for the entire movie.  Plus for some unknown reason she wears a terrible, cheap, obviously fake wig, which is incredibly distracting.  I spent much of the slower parts, and there were many, watching its part slide farther down towards her ear and then move back up to center again.

Maybe standards have gotten so low that angsty teens think this is good, the effects, the acting, the plot.  Trust me, those comparing this to werewolf classics like American Werewolf in London, The Howling, Dogsoldiers, even Buffy are on crack.  I didn't give this one star because that's a movie I can't watch for even half an hour.  This, I forced myself to watch to the end - only to get loose ends.

1634920,5,B00005NKSD,"The Fitzgerald sisters, Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) and Brigitte (Emily Perkins), are social outcasts. Considered weirdos at their highschool, their deep relationship w/ each other is pretty much all they have. They live in a typical sub-division, w/ it's endless rows of non-descript houses. The girls don't seem to be bothered by their isolation or separation from the ""normal"" (aka: dull) folks around them.  In fact, The Fitzgerald's are the only interesting people in their entire town! They have a romanticized view of death, and a jet-black sense of humor about it. Their school film project is a bloody (literally) riot! One night, Ginger and Brigitte are attacked by a lycanthrope, and Ginger is badly mauled on the very night she starts her first period. Soon, she begins to change- growing claws, sprouting hair in odd places, and sporting a tail! Now, not all of this can be attributed to Ginger's recent menstruating madness. Most of all, Ginger's personality undergoes a bizarre change. She becomes increasingly agressive, hostile,  and downright psychotic, causing Brigitte to seek help from the local drugdealer (Kris Lemche). Between the two of them, they come up w/ a possible solution, but it could prove to be just as bad as Ginger's murderous state! I love this movie! Through all of the horror, gore, death, darkness, etc., the bond between the Fitzgerald's holds true. Brigitte is willing to risk anything to save her sister, even her own life. Emily Perkins is an amazing actress. Katherine Isabelle is great as well. Mimi Rogers portrays the girls' oblivious mum w/ humor and perfectly empty-headed facial expressions. GS is a movie w/ depth and heart within its impaled and oozing ribcage. It's also a fantastic werewolf movie! Highly recommended...",1184630400,2,1775,5.159722222222222
1634921,5,B00005NKSD,"Let me begin by saying that Im a huge fan of the horror genre. I have read the foundational works of H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley and Bram Stoker. I have seen many of the werewolf movies like Howling I & II, American Werewolf in London, Dog Soldiers, Beast of Gauverdan, but none, NONE have come close to the pathos and sheer characterization that Ginger Snaps has. Two girls who are inseparable, struggle with becoming women and undergoing their first menstrual development into womanhood. Both are fascinated with death and live typical ansgsty suburban lives. Both experience first hand the absolute horror of becoming werewolves. Plainly said, this movie takes the metaphor of growing up and turns it upside down. Like Joss Whedon's Buffy, these girls have to confront what it is to be female and what it means to be an outsider.

After renting this movie I have now purchased all 3 of the Ginger Snaps movies. While the second two don't achieve the magnificence of the first, they are worthy of the title (the 3rd is actually a prelude that tells the story set in the 19th century). I highly, highly recommend these movies to enthusiasts of the horror, werewolf and supernatural genre!",1183420800,,1221,4.842105263157895

It isn't among my very favorites, but it is a good, solid werewolf horror flick with a few new twists that make it very worthwhile to watch.  Like all traditional werewolf movies, it has a terribly sad ending.  But if we wanted to laugh, we'd watch ""Teen Wolf,"" now, wouldn't we?",1173484800,5,626,4.271186440677966
1634924,4,B00005NKSD,"Foremost, I gave this film four stars because the end-product is pretty impressive considering the fairly scant budget (I'm thinking Mimi Rogers probably took about a quarter of that five mil). So, while it is not the quality of higher budget films, it does take some significant risks . . . which is tremedously refreshing.

Both Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle (who play sisters) do a fantastic job with their roles! And, like others said, their chemistry is surprisingly vibrant. Likewise, Kris Lemche (who plays Sam, a young ""horticulturalist"") is shockingly engaging. (If anything, I'm actually glad to see him in a role which demonstrates his immense talents . . . ""Final Destination III"" nearly destroyed his career!!) As far as ""the talent"" is concerned, there are no ""bad"" actors here . . . in fact, Mimi Rogers' dedication to this indie-horror was AMAZING! (Her portrayal of a well-intended, but completely oblivious suburban mom was spot-on!)

As others noted, the special effects are, well, not good. BUT, that's okay!! Because special effects do not reside at the heart of this film (who needs another Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow?!) Instead, we have a film which catalogs the (potential) trauma of being an adolescent with striking honesty. And while the comparisons to De Palma's ""Carrie"" are legitimate, it is VERY important to note that Carrie's telekinesis was triggered by the onset of menstruation (it was DORMANT, waiting to awake), Ginger's transformation is not the result of a dormant power . . . she is merely a victim of circumstance. I think this is a REALLY important distinction . . . and each  are equally as interesting!! Each makes its own statement about adolescence.

Moreover, I appreciate how this film addresses the science behind folklore. This is a new trend in horror . . . and contributes an element of realism to the most unrealistic of situations (We see this is ""28 Days Later"" and in the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake). The idea of ""infection"" is a very appealing one!! And, the explanation of how the ""cures"" work, very interesting!!

This film is an overall success. The script is solid, the acting is great, the premise is ""smart,"" . . . the cinematography is adequate at best (but don't let so-so filming deter you!!) It shows the complex bond between women in a respectful way (especially the relationship between the mother and the daughters).

The whole thing is very unsettling and stays with you.

How they deal with the gradual transformation is interesting becasue she doesn't just start turning into a violent sexual beast, if anything alters but enhances Ginger's personality. I highly recommend it.",1165795200,3,622,5.038834951456311

1634939,4,B00005NKSD,"""Ginger Snaps"" is a low budget werewolf flick from Canada but that statement hardly does it justice. What we have here is one of the most intelligent horror flicks that have been produced in recent times. What it lacks in special effects it more than makes up for with superb writing and a cast that's capable of making it all come together.

Ginger and Brigitte are teenage sisters that are struggling through the very awkward years of puberty. They help each other through all the confusion and trials by imagining morbid fantasies of their own suicides and making pacts that they will stay together forever whether living or dead. But things become far more taxing when Ginger is bitten by a werewolf and starts to turn. Her pubescent changes are now exacerbated by her gradual transformation into a lycanthrope. With her growing power comes a previously unknown popularity at her school that separates her from Brigitte along with her concern and help.

The choice to combine both feminine pubescence and lycanthropy is pure genius. ""They don't call it the curse for nothing"" is the tagline of the film and really displays this films split themes. It's both a story about growing up and a horror yarn based on werewolf mythology. The cast are simply fabulous! Emily Perkins' Brigitte suitably appears insecure and apprehensive about life in general. Her character struggles to look people in the eyes and has an almost pathetic look that she cowers behind. Katharine Isabelle is also awesome as Ginger. She oozes both adolescent nonchalance and sexual energy throughout the film. I found myself laughing hysterically several times throughout due to her morbid one-liners and looks of disgust at the world around her. While her transformation into a deadly beast may have been a difficult one as an actress, she pulled it off beautifully, remaining both expressive and sexy in equal doses. The other actress that deserves a mention is Mimi Rogers, not simply due to her being the most well-known of the cast, but due to her role as the sisters' mother. She portrays an extremely caring mother that's totally detached from the reality of her children. It's a demanding role and she performs admirably.

""Ginger Snaps"" is almost totally devoid of cliches and manages to be both very funny and quite horrifying at times. It's not all that gory (although dogs do not fair well in this film), but it is a little bit disturbing in its use of violence and teenage struggles in tandem. For such a low budget movie I think the special effects are really very good, yet those used to Hollywood blockbusters should not go in expecting too much. The transformation effects are fantastic, yet the actual werewolves once completed are rather fake looking. But I'm willing to accept that due to the unique qualities of this film and find it to be thoroughly entertaining as a film that traverses several genres. Check it out if you haven't already.",1158192000,3,2936,4.891566265060241

1634942,4,B00005NKSD,"""Ginger Snaps"" like Brian De Palma's film of Stephen King's ""Carrie"" is an entertaining horror flick that uses the analogy of transforming into a werewolf and comparing it to the onset of puberty and the effect of sexually transmitted diseases like AIDS. When 16 year old Ginger is bitten by a werewolf on the night she has her first menstration she becomes infected and begins to gradually change. Ginger suddenly becomes sexually active and begins infecting others at her high school. Meanwhile her younger sister Bridgett tries desperately to find a cure for the two of them. We feel sympathy for the girls (less so for Ginger with her screw you attitude towards her parents)as they descent into ther own private trap unable to escape as they transform.

This isn't for the lighthearted this is an intense horror flick deftly mixing satire, horror and drama. This low budget production like ""Dog Soldiers"" plays with the conventions of the genre and is entertaining to boot although isn't a feel good movie by any stretch of the imagination.

1634946,4,B00005NKSD,"I initially wrote a long, stupid introductory paragraph, but screw it.  Here's the essence:  `Ginger Snaps' is probably my favorite werewolf movie, not that that is all that much of a prize, and is a rare horror movie that works on a horrific, humorous and human level all at the same time.  Check it out.

The films centers around two teenaged sisters, Ginger and Brigitte, living in ultra-bland, suburban Canada.  They're antisocial, death-obsessed types, willingly associating only with one another.  Long story short, Ginger gets bit by a werewolf, and this causes considerable strain on their relationship, as Brigitte searches for a cure and a way to cover Ginger's tracks, all while Ginger becomes more and more strange, what with her turning into a werewolf and all.

Key to the film's success is the likability of Ginger and Brigitte, played by Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins respectively.  Teenagers on film are usually loathsome, particularly pseudo-gothic types like these, which makes the sympathetic nature all the more surprising.  Yeah, they are somewhat exaggerated, as these sorts always are on film, but they still maintain a core humanity and believability.  More to the point, I just think that there relationship is legitimately sweet, and this allows the film to be surprisingly sad as things grow more and more difficult.  They're the total heart of the film, though there are some other effective characters, such as their hopelessly, exaggeratedly clueless mother, and Sam, fellow student who tries to help them. (After he accidentally splatters the original werewolf all of the road.)

The film has got a lot of humor in it, smarter stuff than in the average horror-comedy, with much of it relating to standard teen issues along with, ahem, menstruation.  Much of the latter is fairly disgusting, but hey, that's what makes it funny.  There is a point to this, of sorts, as Ginger gets bitten shortly after beginning her first, ughnn, period, and the film relates the two, uhh, transformations to one another.  This is kinda clever, I think, though it ultimately doesn't add up too much.  Nevertheless, it does allow for some effectively uncomfortable humor and some vague, quasi-feminist commentary.  (Also, it provided fodder for the tagline my roommate came up with:  The only thing worse than a werewolf is a moody werewolf.  That's pretty damn funny, I think.)

Sadly, the fx in this film tend to be pretty weak.  The werewolf designs pretty much sucks, but they don't show it to you too much. (They'd look quite a bit better in the sequels.)  Furthermore, the climax is staged effectively enough that it's pretty tense in spite of the shoddy fx work, and has got some fairly brutal werewolf action.  It's also got a bit of gore in it.  Not a ton, but it's there.

This DVD is ultra-cheap, as well it might be, cause it's junk.  Poor picture quality, no extras and, most unforgivably, in full-frame.  Note to DVD companies: I. HATE. FULL. FRAME. D. V. D. S. Still, we don't appear to have any other choice, unless we wanna import something.  Aw well.

Yeah, I'm done I guess.  Just a very cool movie that works in a couple different ways.

1634947,5,B00005NKSD,"Gingersnaps is one of the most original and savvy horror movies of the genre.  The story centers around two teenagers, sisters who represent opposites on the spectrum of physical beauty.  They aren't interested in boys or the shallow social life of their local high school.  Sexual harassment and peer hazing are endured with wry boredom by our heroes.  These girls are jaded--partly by the lack of meaning in their lives and by the superficial values of adolescence that judge them by their appearance and ability to fit in.  They play out their lack of interest in life by their fascination with filming one another in elaborate death scenes.  Everything changes when one of the sisters becomes a werewolf.

""Gingersnaps"" is brilliantly filmed in bleak suburbia by Canadian John Fawcett (director of Taken, and Queer as Folk), and co-written by Fawcett and Karen Walton.  The actresses are superb; Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle are perfect as misfit teenagers.

This hip underground horror film is substantial entertainment.  It succeeds as a good quality werewolf film and it provides pithy cultural observations.",1149552000,7,1123,5.223463687150838
1634948,5,B00005NKSD,"This is one of my all time favorite movies and without a doubt, one of the most criminally underrated and misunderstood.

I wrote this review for ""Ginger Snaps"" the same day I wrote a review for ""The Hitcher"" (1986), both movies that struck me deeply the first time I saw them years ago, both movies I've watched since many times and gained a deeper appreciation and understanding for them. While for the most part they have little in common, for the purpose of my review, they have interesting things in common: They are both low budget movies billed as horror movies and thus unfairly viewed and written off as ""cheap horror movies."" However, the truth of the matter is that both films are *excellent* pieces of cinematic art (yes, art) with first rate acting and two movies with some of the best characterization I've ever seen. In ""The Hitcher"" the relationship between the Hitcher John Ryder and the young man Jim Halsey is endlessly fascinating, subtlely nuanced, and astonishingly complex. The same goes double for the relationship between sisters Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald.

The tragedy is, in both of the movies, there is little recognition or appreciation of the amazing characterization and relationship, because ""it's just a dumb horror movie."" Indeed, even many of the positive reviews for ""Ginger Snaps"" say ""Wow, great movie! One of the best werewolf movies ever!"" That's nice, I agree totally, it is a great ""werewolf"" movie, indeed one of the best, but where's the kudos for the characterization, for the tight plotting and emotional range, the acting? Sadly, too many people think because this is a ""horror"" movie that it can't also be a jaw-dropping study of human nature and make you think as well.

My last tie-in with ""The Hitcher:"" While C. Thomas Howell does a good job in ""The Hitcher,"" Rutger Hauer drives the film with an earth-shattering performance. In ""Ginger Snaps"" though, we're in for a real treat - unlike the former movie mentioned, this film has two Grade A performances from both actresses portraying the sisters, Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle. Filmmakers should take note - you give these fine actresses a role with some meat on it, they will deliver the goods, and more.

""Ginger Snaps"" takes place in a typical suburb. The main characters are the sisters Brigitte and Ginger. Both would probably be considered ""Goth"" but more than that they are viewed as cynical, dark, socially maladjusted, and being fascinated with death. They are very close, some would say disturbingly close, and in the early part of the movie we get a wonderful view into the world they share and the pithy barbs they trade about the outside world they despise. Unlike most sisters, they film themselves (often tragically touching - ""Bury me in this dress"") killed by their own hand in disturbing and explicit ways, and ostensibly have their own suicide pact. We are shown their room, which is like a grim, dark cave, and their relationship with their clueless but well-meaning parents. We come to understand them and their world, and to sympathize with both of them.

Then comes the hitch. Neither of the girls have gotten their periods, which is abnormal at their age, and speaks volumes about the way they've held the outside world at bay. The suburb has been terrorized by a beast of some sort, mauling dogs and such. The beast attacks Ginger (probably because she was menstruating) and then has a run-in with Sam, a guy who works at a local greenhouse and sells pot to the high school kids. And all of a sudden, everything changes.

Ginger turns into a more normal, outgoing, and sexually voracious young woman virtually overnight. The viewer doesn't know if she's turning into a werewolf or just going through puberty and going through teenage growing pains, but the movie, with a wicked sense of innovation, builds and shows an elaborate parallel between menstruation and ""the curse of the werewolf."" It's such a simple and ingenuous concept, we have to wonder why no one came up with it before.

Ginger and Brigitte grow apart. Brigitte worries that Ginger is becoming a werewolf, or worse, a vapid teenage whore, while Ginger regards her little sister as stuck in childhood, clinging to old things and holding her back. It's a fascinating look at the growth process and why the things we hold dear as children and teenagers are not often the things we hold dear as adults. It's also an incredible study of growing up and growing apart.

I don't want to give too much away, but the relationship between as the relationship between the sisters grows more and more distant and strained, it evolves and takes turns the viewer cannot imagine it taking at the beginning of the movie (back when you thought you had the movie pigeonholed). The relationship is further complicated when Brigitte enlists the aid of Sam to help Ginger. Ginger doesn't like this at all, and it's utterly fascinating to see react the way she does when Sam comes to the football field for Brigitte, and Sam and Ginger's confrontation in the greenhouse. The movie goes places and makes observations that a first-time viewer wouldn't think it is capable of. But it is capable, of that and much more.[...]

I guess at this point I should give a few words to some of the other good things about this movie, however I am running close to my word limit. The ancillary actors, particularly Kris Lemche as Sam and Mimi Rogers as the mother, are all very good. The setting is well taken advantage of: somber autumn days in a dead end suburb. The special effects are fine, and have held up surprisingly well over the years, but they won't blow you away by any means.

The music from this movie is fantastic, mostly because of the opening and ending scores. The song that plays over the end credits, in fact, is one of the greatest (and best fitting for the moment) songs I've seen/heard from a movie ever. Whenever I watch this movie I watch through the credits because it's so good, and fits so well with the ending. It gets me every time, and unfortunately, it's not available on the soundtrack, and the composer has the beginning, but not the end theme, on his website, which is unfortunate, because I'd really like to obtain the end theme.

In conclusion, I recommend this movie for horror fans and fans of werewolf movies. I recommend it even more for viewers with a discriminating eye who like horror movies but like movies with top notch acting, characterization, and an unparalleled look at human nature and an enthralling study of the relationship of two sisters. This movie gripped and moved me deeply, and I recommend it very highly.

One last note - I didn't write this review to get everyone to agree with me, I did it so people who read this know why I love this movie, and I hope it will help people to appreciate this film more, on another level.",1146268800,6,6855,4.760942760942761
1634949,5,B00005NKSD,"What would you do if you found that your sister was turning into a werewolf?  This is the problem that faces Brigitte (Emily Perkins), when her sister Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) suddenly reaches womanhood and hairiness at the same time.  The two young Goths, fascinated by suicide, loners in a normal high school suddenly find themselves at odds after years of close companionship.  Ginger dives into a whirlwind of appetite - sex, drugs, and violence.  Brigitte finds herself alienated, desperate to help a sister who cares less and less every day.

At first Ginger's powers are almost welcome.  A chance to get even with the world and be free from the limitations of society and parents.  But the change that is coming over her isn't a slight allergic reaction to moonlight.  Inexorably, her body changes, and she must confront countless contradictions between her actions, and her remorse each step of the way.

For Brigitte the horror is losing a sister and waging a desperate struggle to reverse the process.  Once Ginger was the leader, but now Brigitte must find her own power in a effort that becomes more painful as Ginger sinks into bestiality.  Brigitte becomes the cleanup crew, the fixer, and the loyal friend.  She also delivers much of the subtle sarcasm that keeps the audience unprepared for the tour-de-force ending.

Somebody should have warned me about this film.  For some reason I got it in my head that this was something on the lighthearted side of horror.  Instead it is one of those dark films that cross over from horror into the bleakest noir.  The acting is surprisingly good, building gradually from hokey teenage horror to a kind of fevered tragic pitch that leaves you stunned in the final moments.  The effects are a bit amateurish, but the impact isn't.  The film has a surprising number of layers, from coming of age to self-realization.

There are no extras on this DVD.  No subtitles, no languages, just the film and the trailer.  And just for once I would actually like to hear the director comment of explain something of the concept of the film.  But this is a low cost production, and I'm glad the transfer was successful.",1144972800,46,2164,4.823369565217392
1634950,4,B00005NKSD,"Ginger Snaps. What can I say about this movie? I saw it when I was seventeen years old on HBO and instantly fell in love with it before the opening credits were through. Gore and cheesy effects aside, I have to say this movie is brilliant. It was a pretty original spin on the werewolf theme. If you like animals, especially dogs, you might have a hard time watching this at some parts. For being a low budget film, it gets pretty graphic.

I love the relationship between the two sisters, Brigitte and Ginger, and how Ginger's transformation, which they at first mistake for puberty, tears them apart, but they are still connected by their sisterly bond.

The acting is great; I think they did a great job casting the leads, Ginger and Brigitte, the score is beautiful, and the story is captivating. I do have to say that the opening credits are still my favorite part of the movie. I think it portrays the relationship between Brigitte and Ginger very well and you also get a glimpse into their dark and sarcastic realities.

Two sisters, barely a year apart, obsessed with death, with beign different, are suddenly thrust into a nightmare when the older, Ginger is bitten by a werewolf. Slowly she begins to change, she confuses a need for violence with lust, she spreads the disease and her now shut-out sister is left to search for a cure. The brilliance here is the emotional connection between the sister, tense, taunt humor and the twist of searching for a cure rather than a way to kill. There are also some very believable teen-age moments here and lots of great tension. The final moments of special effects with the mechanical monster-werewolf are horrible but the movie is excellent.

1634961,5,B00005NKSD,"In my perpetual quest to find werewolf movies that are not utter tripe, I stumbled across Ginger Snaps.  I didn't know quite what to expect from a film with such an unconventional name.  I got the ""snaps"" part (you know, wolves snap at people) but not the Ginger part.

Ginger, as it turns out, is Ginger Fitzgerald (Katharine Isabelle), a sulky goth chick preteen who is about to become a teen in a hurry. Her younger sister is Brigitte (Emily Perkins), who hides behind her hair.  This dark duo, shades of Ghost World, enjoys staging gory death scenes and photographing them for art class.  The girls are pros at it too, and the photographs we see plastered over their basement apartment are simultaneously disturbing and amusing.

The two girls are the daughters of Henry (John Bourgeois) and Pamela (Mimi Rogers).  It's telling that the girls live in the basement together.  They have a lot of freedom, a result of the parental strife going on upstairs.

As a young male, I remember coming back from junior high to high school and suddenly noticing that certain girls had blossomed into vivacious women.  I wasn't the only one who noticed either.  Ginger Snaps takes the perspective of the girls going through puberty, most specifically from Brigitte who is the younger of the two sisters.  But of course, puberty just wouldn't be the same without a little lycanthropy.

As Ginger puts to the school nurse: ""I've got hair in places I didn't before, I'm having weird urges, and there's a lot of blood.""  Sounds like a typical teen, right?

And that's what makes Ginger Snaps such an excellent film.  It's not about werewolves.  It's not about the usual blarney about how a werewolf is a man's inner beast.  We've seen all that before.  Yeah, men have the capacity for horrible violence.  We see it so much in the movies now that it's hard to get upset about it.

Transposing the angst of puberty into a parable for lycanthropy is a brilliant stroke.  We watch in horror as Ginger hurdles towards hot chick status: she wears tight-fitting clothes, starts wearing makeup, and goes after the boys.  She's becoming a woman and a werewolf at the same time.  It's only through the lens of a horror movie that we understand the horrors of womanhood.  And by horrors, I mean blood.  Lots and lots of it.  Menstrual blood, people blood, blood dripping from mouths, guts torn open (mostly dogs).

Throughout, the film stays true to its roots as a teen horror that's about teens. They curse, they smoke pot, they ogle each other, and sometimes they're just plain mean. Now imagine all those traits in a werewolf driven by hormonal rages that replace lust with rage, with the superhuman strength to back it up...and you have Ginger Snaps.

Ginger finally does snap, despite her sister's best efforts to restrain her.  Brigitte allies with the drug dealer (Sam, played by Kris Lemche) whose van killed the original werewolf to manufacture a cure, but Ginger's changes go well beyond vamping into weird territory when she starts growing a tail.  And then the hunger starts and somebody dies.

The acting is superb, the music appropriate, the special effects up to par without using CGI.  Every actor pulls their weight admirably.  The parents act like concerned but clueless adults and the daughters act like angry, sarcastic teens.

I often reference how movies sometimes fail to stay true to the characters.  This is another way of saying that happy endings should never be forced.  Ginger Snaps never shies away from the stark realities of broken homes, social pressures, or biological changes.  The ending is harsh but appropriate.

""Out by sixteen or dead in this scene but together forever,"" swear the two girls over and over before the changes begin.  They never had a chance.",1124150400,20,3772,4.814641744548287
1634962,3,B00005NKSD,This DVD was very shaky but when I worked with it it started to work alright. The movie itself was OK. Not exactly what I had expected but as far as a vampire movie it was a B,1123459200,,175,3.6315789473684212
1634963,4,B00005NKSD,"No wonder this is considered a ""cult classic""....the screenplay is extremely well written (by Karen Walton...it would take a woman to do justice to a lot of this subject matter), the acting is generally excellent (especially Emily Perkins, whose expressive eyes alone are worth the price of the DVD), and the entire concept is relentlessly amusing, entertaining, and at times a little scary.

The special effects are uneven...the gore and small details (like severed fingers) are well done but the werewolves are a bit lame (who cares, they only play a minor part of the movie, and there is so much else to enjoy). No gratuitous nudity, no trite and predictable situations, no silly ""teenage monster-movie"" behavior (""my friends have all disappeared and a monster is loose....I think I'll go for a walk""), just a surprisingly sophisticated, clever, and (at times) downright hilarious plot.

You have to pay close attention to the dialog, because it touches on all sorts of issues unrelated to werewolves and horror movies...ditzy parents and lunatic school nurses, the ""monstrous"" side of puberty, positive and negative social interactions, sisterly bonds, etc.

Katherine Isabelle (Ginger) delivers some of the cleverest lines in recent memory....Brigitte (her glum, deadly serious sister): ""Now you've done it....you had unprotected sex with Paul and now he has contracted the disease"" (werewolfism....and believe me, he has a BAD case). Ginger: ""Oops"".

Black humor is knee deep in this movie and no target is off limits, from a detailed description of the menstrual process by a deranged school nurse (you will love Ginger's response to this) to the complete irrelevance of school counselors, parents, and the police (who never make a single appearance, despite numerous mutilations and murders).

From chipping dead bodies out of their parents freezer with a screwdriver to smoking weed in the back of a landscaper's truck...you can't ask for a better way to spend your time than watching Ginger and Brigitte as they wade through blood, gore, prehensile tails, and the nightmares of puberty.",1122768000,2,2096,5.263473053892215

The two female leads (both unknown to me) did a great job as the two enmeshed, morbid sisters.  Horror fans should enjoy this one--while the effects aren't great, the suspense is maintained throughout.  No nudity, no fake scares--just good writing, acting, and directing.

1634965,4,B00005NKSD,"Battling the typical teenage hormones and angst, plus the chest hair she's been sprouting since being attacked by a large dog-like animal, Ginger's in no mood.

A fresh and funny take on coming-of-age movies, the story about Ginger's transformation is seen through the eyes of her sister, Brigitte (Emily Perkins).  Following Ginger's molestation by dog, Brigitte is alarmed by her older sister's sudden emotional distance (not to mention her new interest in aortas).  Once a somber and self-isolating goth girl, Ginger (a succulent Katherine Isabelle) is hysterical as she trolls her school's hallways, in new sexy getups, arousing poor pimply faced saps.  Still dressed in unbecoming shades of black, gangly Brigitte tries to hold things together and save fellow students from lunchmeat fate, while trying to find a cure for her sister.

The sibling dynamic really holds the movie together, increasing the creep factor--the horror that Brigitte feels as she loses her closest friend and how far she will go to protect Ginger.  Good acting from both Perkins and Isabelle.  The werewolf effects are, as are all werewolf effects, pretty lame.  Luckily, not too much screen time is devoted to the actual beasties and most of the plot lies in Ginger's personality (ie. increased sexuality) transformation.  The ending isn't as strong as I had hoped, but the acting and humour make up for it. I've read that the sequel and prequel are also entertaining, so I'm looking forward to watching those as well.

**If you're looking for other interesting werewolf movies, that are more psychological than outright gore, I might recommend The Company of Wolves--an oldie but a goodie (based on a feminist retelling of Little Red), erotic in an old-fashioned ""don't go off the path in the woods, darling"" way.  In terms of scare-em and gore, Dog Soldiers made me really jumpy despite goofy-ass name (effects are so-so).",1122595200,3,1905,5.132686084142395

1634968,4,B00005NKSD,"Ah... it does my heart good to see that the first decent werewolf movie since ""An American Werewolf in London"" came from independent roots.

Look at the current trend of remaking all the Japanese and Korean horror movies. Look at Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" from the UK. Look also at the immensely talented Guillermo Del Toro and the fact that his best movies (Cronos and Devil's Backbone) are both essentially foreign films.

Maybe there's a trend there. Maybe Americans don't know how to make original horror movies anymore. I certainly hope not. But regardless, this is a worthy contribution to the werewolf genre, and fits nicely with ""American Werewolf in London"" and ""The Howling"" - despite the rather shoddy FX by hackmasters KNB, the story managed to rise above its budgetary constraints.

This is a bloody horror film, and the final creature could use a bit more in the special effects department.

1634975,3,B00005NKSD,"Decent little flick Ginger Snaps is.  Let's just say it's more decent than many other of the more hyped werewolf horror movies out there for instance the latest and dumbest ""Cursed""

Only thing that annoyed the hell out of me is being a life long horror/werewolf fan and since i've been reading about Vampires and Werewolves since I was freaking 5 years old I got tired of the humanoid type of were/semiwerewolf that Ginger was.

For God's sake never mind the fact that for some reason she and that other werewolf liked exculsively killing dogs for some reason, as if she and the other werewolf never actually was able to come across anyone else late at night.  Forget about the reason why she never killed that kid she first had sex with in the car when she had him there alone, and the movie deludes you into thinking she was transforming for the first time and the she comes back to her sister with the guy still alive but with another dog dead.  HUH? Makes no sense to me.

 Furthermore never mind also the fact that if this kind of crap was really going on, and people knew about it, and judging from you what you see in the movie, they did, you'd think they put their dogs inside the house with them at night, (DUH! common sense anyone?) which really did not make a whole lot of sense.

Plus unlike many other conventional werewolf movies she never really turned into a werewolf until the very end of the movie.  What kind of werewolf movie is that?  I mean she did not turn into a werewolf, and then at daybreak turn back into human form and had no recollection of what had happened the night before, what she did and who she did it to and vice versa.

Whenever she killed people, she did so more as a human than a werewolf.  She looked more like a demented evil version of Avril Lavigne (If that's even possible) than a cursed lycantrhope.  She killed simply as a killer or murderess like any other psychopath in those crazy Halloween or Friday the 13th or SAW or what you have type of movies. Not as a cursed damned animal that had no choice in what it did and to whom that the werewolf really is.  She knew full well what she was doing, she was alert, she just gave up caring.  Doesn't sound like the traditional werewolf movie to me.

Not too much of a big fan on the soundtrack.  Loved the music score though by Mike Shields.

You want a  soundtrack that rocks?  Ever see the film Queen of the Damned?  With Stuart Townsend and Aliyah?  Even though the movie stunk like you wouldn't believe, the soundtrack rocks big time.  Much more so than Ginger Snaps, but that's my point of view. You if you're like Canadian, you may have a different opinion since the movie and the music is more local to you.

Trouble with movie is it needed to find out what it's identity was.  A werewolf movie or a killer flick?  Whatever, like I said decent but it aint nothing to howl about.

1634976,4,B00005NKSD,"There are usually two problems with werewolf movies: (1) they all tend to look and feel the same, and (2) they never have the budget they need for good werewolf FX.

(2) is a big problem for Ginger Snaps, but in (1) it definitely excells.  Using the ""curse"" of the werewolf as a metaphor for the ""curse"" of puberty, it's the first new life I've seen breathed into the werewolf film in quite some time.  The two lead actresses are excellent as Ginger and Bridget, with Emily Perkins (Bridget) truly shining as the dedicated, dowdy sister of werewolf Ginger.  Her search for a cure is well-crafted, and the eventual cure she discovers is, AFAIK, unique in werewolf films.

The end of the film is something of a let-down, partially because  of the low-budget FX.  The director wisely keeps the werewolves in the shadows for most of the film, but when we finally get a good look at them, they're neither very wolfish nor very well-crafted.  But by then the interest in the story will fiorgive the low-budget animatronics.

By not following all the Hollywood conventions, and by giving a new spin with the metaphors, I definitely recommend this film.",1111190400,,1145,4.71356783919598

1634978,4,B00005NKSD,"Deat-beat sisters Brigit and Ginger are currently in their anti-establishment phase, and right proper candidates for the Prozac parade in their little suburban wonderland. Lucky enough at being at the bottom rung of the social ladder, nothing would please them more than to fade into obscurity. But Life takes an unexpected and exciting turn, when Ginger is very nearly dispatched by a strange lycanthrope in the woods.

Their miserable lives (and soon to be more complicated existence) wouldn't be complete without their sociopath for a mother, played by Mimi Rogers, a Stepford Valley wannabe who is as distant as Pluto in the goings-on with these troublesome greasy-haired waifs. Will she hide the human finger she finds in the backyard, or will she confront the girls over cake?

This strangely enjoyable horror flick felt like a wicked treat, more decadent than death by chocolate, when devouring late at night. Get a gang of your close friends, some pizza, and icecream and prepare to hoot, holler and chill up your spine. A movie for those who don't take themselves too seriously, but just a tad enough to recognize that ""Ginger Snaps"" is a bit distinct and has a flaver all its own.

I'm not going to go into a long synopsys of the film, plenty of other people have done that thus far. What I will say is that this is a solid werewolf film. I don't want to say that the story  has been ""updated"" so much as the circumstances have been (ie: seriously, what would YOU do if you were bitten by a werewolf while YOU were in Highschool?)

The acting by both of the leading young ladies is great, the gore is not overdone and beliveable and there are very few, if any, plot holes to take issue with. The only reason I'm not going to 5 stars is that, I will admit, the film slows down towards the end  in comparrison to the begining.

Period.  What follows is nothing more than the fact that Ginger though repelled by her fate, still enjoys the bloodletting and feeling of power her lycanthropy brings.  Younger sister must like it too because near the end of the movie, well, no spoiler, but let's not make this some kind of ""classic"" movie.

Think of Birch and Johanssons characters in `Ghost World' but younger, less witty and a whole lot more morbid and you'll get the idea. Indeed they are completely obsessed by death and suicide. Then one night two terrible things happen. Ginger gets `the curse', her first period, much to the delight of their mother and the kooky school nurse and the horror of her sister. And she is pursued by a werewolf that succeeds in biting her before being splatted by a passing van. And then she starts to change...

Neil Jordan's 1984 Angela-Carter-inspired `Company of Wolves' used werewolfhood as a metaphor for male sexuality and the threatening face it presents to young women. This film turns that conceit around and uses werewolfhood as a metaphor for female sexuality and the threatening face it presents to young, erm, women. In Jordan's film the conclusion was, in effect, cool it girls, really, whatever Granny may say, the wolf is not so very much to be feared. In this film the wolf is every bit as scary as you always thought it was. It's a nice, original, intelligent horror movie. A hybrid of the horror and high school genres, it also rather invites comparison with Rodriguez's `The Faculty' but is loads better, and loads darker, than that was.",1105660800,3,1370,4.905172413793103

Now Ginger is undergoing two sets of changes; those into womanhood and those into lycanthropehood.  It is up to Brigitte to try and keep things under control and help her sister.

As the changes and suspense mounts, Brigitte becomes more and more desperate to find a cure for her sister.  Eventually their mother (played excellently by Mimi Rogers) gets involved and seems suspiciously understanding.

Although the series is named after Ginger, it is Brigitte who always gets top billing.  This is because the series actually revolves around her and her relationship with Ginger.  From the first moments of the film the pace is almost breakneck.

You'll know its good in the first scene where the little boy is playing in the sand box.  What is he playing with though?  If  you like gore there is plenty of it.  The movie is sick and twisted at times as well.  The main characters themselves have very dark and sick senses of humor and they are kind of outcasts in their high school.  They take quite a gothic aproach to life.

Death is one of their favorite subjects.

I don't want to say too much because that will spoil the film.  In my opinion this is one of the best horror movies out there if not the best.

1634987,4,B00005NKSD,"Ginger Snaps (John Fawcett, 2000)

It has been many, many years-- twenty-two, to be precise-- since I have been as deliciously shocked by a movie's opening scene as I was by that of Ginger Snaps. The previous movie to do it to me was Friday the 13th Part 2, when that cat jumps through the window. While Friday the 13th Part 2 then immediately dropped into the gutter and stayed there, Ginger Snaps stayed just that good.

The Fitzgerald sisters, Ginger (Katharine Isabelle, soon to be seen in the Earthsea miniseries) and Brigitte (Emily Perkins, one of the main characters in the miniseries of It a while back), are suburban teens who are obsessed with death and carnage. They get a taste of the real thing when a local werewolf (who is the author of that excellent first scene) savages Ginger while the girls are out late at night. Needless to say, Ginger is all set to become a werewolf herself, unless she and Brigitte, with the help of the local drug dealer, Sam (Flash Forward's Kris Lemche), can find a cure. Problem is, Ginger's not sure she wants a cure, because along with lycanthropy comes all sorts of nifty side benefits.

Ginger Snaps is a fantastic film in just about every regard. The characters are well-drawn and worth your time, the situations are alternately (and often simultaneously) horrifying and hilarious, and there are enough twists in the tale to keep you wondering what's going to happen. This low-budget thriller, which never gained wide release, has become a cult smash on video, and it's easy to see why. You may have to go out of your way to find it, but do so; it's fresh, funny, hip, and... Canadian! ****",1101686400,3,1641,4.651724137931034

Okay, I admit, I haven't seen every werewolf movie ever made.  But the best of what I've seen doesn't rise above B-grade, and usually not that high.

This film, on the other hand, is amazing.  Outstanding acting and directing, one of the best scores I've heard in a long time, great story and terrific script.  The only weakness was in the area of special effects, but this is so much more drama than horror that to me, that hardly mattered.  If you don't like horror, watch it as a drama.  If you don't like drama, watch it as horror.  And if you don't like either, you might enjoy it as a comedy--watching Mimi Rogers as the sisters' uber-suburban, perky (step?)mother, carrying a tupperware container with two human fingers inside through a sort of goth-rave is only one of the funniest moments.",1100649600,,825,4.680555555555555
1634990,4,B00005NKSD,"When Brigitte made a blood pact with her sister Ginger, she probably didn't think at the time that it would include lycanthropy. Unfortunately for her, when Ginger gets bitten by a werewolf, that's exactly what it means.

""Ginger Snaps"" is a surprisingly fresh and original take on the werewolf story, and despite some technical flaws is a very well-made movie. Its a tale told with a sense of humor, but also a strong sense of what works in a good horror film. This is no brainless teen slasher flick. One gets the same feeling while watching this movie that one might get from Stephen King's ""Carrie,"" both in terms of story and in terms of talent. This feels like an early work from a new artist, but the talent shows through the minor mistakes.

The comparison to ""Carrie"" comes through so strongly for me because of the shared theme both works have of transformation. Both are about teenage girls whose bodies are just entering womanhood, but for them this natural transformation is accompanied by a supernatural one. For Carrie White, her confusion was complicated by burgeoning psychic powers. For Ginger the transformation is less subtle -- she's turning into a werewolf. The changes in her body that normally come with menstruation are soon overshadowed by another set of changes... including a tail.

""Ginger Snaps"" is by turns funny, sad, shocking, and quirky. The way Ginger and Brigitte attempt to deal with Ginger's new complication and how their relationship is portrayed through this seems completely natural and believable. While the movie's special effects are definitely suffering from low-budget syndrome in parts, overall the snappy dialogue, solid characters, and original story keep the film moving along just fine.

1634995,4,B00005NKSD,"Just got a copy and watched a very underrated and excellent horror film from Canada. Ginger Snaps is one of the best werewolf films since the early 80's An American Werewolf In London, The Howling and Wolfen. The other werewolf film that can even rise up and stand up to Ginger Snaps is Neil Marshall's Dog Soldiers.

This film takes the standard werewolf story and gives it a tone that is very close to some of David Cronenberg's films. The story deals with a couple of teenage sisters whose preoccupation with goth and death adds to the film's subtext of teenage angst and alienation within the confines of the high school environment. The sisters are played wonderfully by Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins. Isabelle plays the title role of Ginger while Perkins that of the younger sibling Brigitte.

The werewolf angle is used as a metaphor for puberty, especially the body changes a girl goes through towards becoming a woman. It is this use of a standard horror convention to explain the idea and concept of sex which makes this film very Cronenberg. Ginger Snaps is not all subtext and metaphors. This film has scares and blood aplenty. The make-up FX used for the werewolf is believable and there's not a CGI to be seen to give the effects that artificial look to them. These effects --- like those in Dog Soldiers --- owes much to those films listed above.

It seems that the upsurge in horror films these past 5 years have come from low to mid-budgeted efforts. It just goes to show that throwing loads and loads of cash to make a horror film doesn't mean it'll turn up good. Ginger Snaps shows that traditional horror filmmaking is not dead, but still alive and making a serious comeback.

A few months later I said to myself ""fudge it"" and rented it. Later that night I found myself sitting in my basement watching what has turned out to be one of my favorite Horror/Goth films. It isn't as much of a horror film as It leans towards being more of a movie for strange people or Goths. As are our two Main Characters, Ginger and Bridgette. What makes it so interesting is the Acting and humor. I'm not talking Army of Darkness humor, Ginger snaps manages to be intelligent with its humor; something rarely found nowadays. As in many direct to video movies, there are the parts that are just plain out stupid and could have done better. Ginger Snaps avoids this with only having 2 or 3, but they don't change the plot or cause huge errors of stupidity in the flow of the film.

The DVD simply sucks. What are the features?
A) Movie
B) Trailer

That's it! No Scene selection, commentary, sound options or anything else. The reason why it was direct to video in the states is because it's an Independent film (I think) from Canada.

He thinks this is a major complication, but Willow replies: ""Well, I like you.  You're nice, and you're funny, and you don't smoke, and okay, werewolf but that's not all the time.  I mean, three days out of the month I'M not much fun to be around either.""
The relationship between lycanthropy and menstruation is explored for pretty much everything it is worth in ""Ginger Snaps,"" a macabre hybrid of the horror and coming-of-age genres.  The screenplay by Karen Walton has lots of bite, in both directions, and even when the ending goes all horror show, director John Fawcett manages to not lose the focus on all the levels this film is operating on.  This might not be a great horror film, but it is certainly a memorable combination of gags and gagging.
The story is about too sisters who are bored to tears in their suburbian Ontario track development.  Ginger Fitzgerald (Katharine Isabelle) is 16 and Brigitte (Emily), called ""B,"" is 15, and for fun they stage and photograph tableaus of their own deaths.  Their mother (Mimi Rogers) is concerned, not because of their fascination with death or their goth wardrobe but because neither girl has had her first period.  The girls are social outcasts, which only strengthens the bond between them and it clear that all they can really count on in this world are each other, which is good.  Because they are going to need that bond big time when the fur begins to fly.
That is because on the night of the full moon Ginger gets her first period and is attacked by a werewolf.  Now she is growing hair and other interesting things, not to mention more and more irritable (the tagline for the film is, of course, ""They Don't Call It The Curse For Nothing"").  We are not sure how this story is going to play out except for one thing: Trina Sinclair (Danielle Hampton) is going down for her treatment of the Fitzgerald sisters (one teen queen should never take on two goth sisters, especially in any support involving sticks and hitting).  The story also involves Sam (Kris Lemche), the good boy who is trying to help ""B"" find a cure for Ginger's problem and Jason McCardy (Jesse Moss) the bad boy who is introduced by Ginger to a whole new level of badness.  Then there is mom, who provides her own twist as she starts to put the pieces (literally) together.
""Ginger Snaps"" works best when it is exploiting the horrors of puberty through the lycanthropy metaphor and when the bond of sisterhood comes into play.  It is not until we get to see a werewolf up close and personal that we realize how low-budget this film really is, but that is a small price to play for being witty and showing some flair (even if the title is a rather lame joke).
The ""Ginger Snaps"" DVD version is totally stripped down.  You get the movie and the trailer.  There are chapter stops but no list of scenes and no alternative languages.  However, you do get most of the neat music that plays over the end credits while you look at your two options.
Apparently ""Ginger Snaps"" was enough of a cult hit to take the next step to horror movie trilogy.  ""Ginger Snaps: Unleashed"" (aka ""Ginger Snaps: The Sequel"" and ""Ginger Snaps 2"") is already out on DVD and late this year we get ""Ginger Snaps Back"" (aka ""Ginger Snaps 3,"" ""Ginger Snaps III: The Beginning,"" and ""Ginger Snaps: The Prequel,"" which finds Brigette and Ginger in 19th Century Canada having more werewolf fun.",1087430400,7,3539,4.60828025477707
1635001,4,B00005NKSD,"This was a refreashing movie for a difficult genre.  There has been a few decent movies of late; Wolf and Dog Solider most notably.
But before that it was a very questionable batch, some of the Howling movies come to mind, the series that just got worse as time went on.
They take a different twist on the genre with this movie.  Based on two morbid sisters living in a small Canadian town.  They are outcasts and seemingly love it.  They use their morbid fixation to attack the people around them.  Which they see as an example of a life that they would rather die than enter.  Their dysfunctional mother and father, their peers, and teachers that can't seem to understand them.  So they work on visual projects involving suicide while sneering at everyone outside their world.
This continues until one night Ginger(Katherine Isabell), is attacked by something in the woods.  They don't get a good look at it, but it is animal like and doesn't appear to be normal.  They manage to run off though Ginger is badly wounded.  She heals rapidly but starts to show strange symptoms.  As well as an increasingly feral and aggressive attitude.
This movie was a perfect example of how you don't need a big budget to make a good movie.  It was also pairing the girls transformation into a werewolf with her sexual awakening and movement into being a woman with her first period.
It isn't a horror movie in the strictest sense.  It is more of a dark comedy exploring the relationship between two misfit sisters.  Their dark attitude contrasted with the overly cheerful and strange attitude of their mother.  Whom is overbearing and the dominating figure in their life(and in her marriage) but almost sickeningly sweet and traditional.  This character is wonderfully played by Mimi Rogers.
I feel this movie is breathing life into the werewolf genre.  Which has mostly lain dormant since Wolf, and was suffering even before that, watch it just for that.  Or the fact that they don't let the werewolf aspect overpower the story, it is more about the bond that the sisters shared.  The way they faced a seemingly opressive and foreboding world together until suddenly that bond is broken and the friendship is all but abandoned.  That is what really drives the movie.

1635004,5,B00005NKSD,"I don't know how they did this.  Ginger Snaps is a very atypical werewolf film... and it's low-budget to boot.  Yet the film makers managed to produce a quirky, scary, funny, clever, original, and engrossing flick which uses werewolfism as a metaphor for puberty!  (Or is that the other way around...?)
Ginger Snaps is not for everyone.  You need to have a taste for horror movies, and strange ones at that.  But for a select few, this movie surges head-and-shoulders over almost any other werewolf film out there.  (A tip on buying the DVD, however: the American version of the DVD is simply terrible.  Go to Amazon.com Canada in order to get the wonderfully well-done Canadian version of this fantastic movie's DVD incarnation.)

One night on the way to give a little payback to another student Ginger is attacked by a beast but she gets away before the beast kills her well Ginger starts to have some weird new feeling and urges. I'll stop now so i don't ruin it for anybody who hasn't seen it yet. I give it 10 out of 10 skulls!!!! If you like werewolf movies or even horror movies just buy Ginger Snaps.

1635006,5,B00005NKSD,"This is honestly one of my favorite movies of all time. Thematically, it's reminiscent of several other films with strong female leads -- Foxfire, Lost and Delirious, Bandits, and Girl, Interrupted come to mind first -- except that this time they got it right.
The difference here is the tone. In most of these other films, the sense of earnestness is almost overwhelming. This film, however, doesn't take itself too seriously at all, even when it's dealing with serious subjects. It allows its more serious subject matter to exist on an allegorical level, which works in the heightened reality of a horror film.
Basically, what I'm saying is that it's wonderful and exactly the kind of movie I'd love to be able to make some day.
Now, as for the DVD itself? Don't get this one. No, really. It's Full Frame and it's completely without extras, except for a single trailer.

Well, Ginger Snaps has an interesting plotline, terrific acting from all cast, particularly from Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle, and some creepy wolf effects. Now, I have seen a few werewolf movies in my time, most with better effects, but it wasn't the werewolves that attracted me to this movie. What attracted me to it was the characters - Ginger and Bridgette were brilliant characters, very well written and well played! It was their relationship, not the horror, that makes this film shine to me.
  Also, being a teen, I kinda get what they are going through (even though I'm not a teen girl and not a werewolf!), with the whole growing-up thing, relationships, etc. I find this a very interesting angle in the film.

When I first watched it, I believe the movie had just came out, in America, and I was either 12 or 13, so the movie sat well with me (I am indeed an odd child). The disturbing slide show in the very beginning of the movie made me laugh and kept my attention for the 'real gore' later on. As the movie progressed I was entranced by the beauty of the movie, the blend of soundtrack and film was perfect, and the actors fit their parts well. The devotion of Bridgette to Ginger, and Ginger to Bridgette (though she didn't want to show it) was beautifully pulled to its peak at the end of the movie, when (well I don't want to spill the ending) but when Bridgette's love for her sister is finally put to the test. Most of my friends hate this movie, but I love it. A warning, if you don't like a lot of blood and gore, even though it's well, fake, I wouldn't watch this.

1635013,4,B00005NKSD,"Teenager Ginger Fitzgerald experiences one hell of a fertility ritual in this cleverly written horror flick from the mind of emerging Canadian dramatist Karen Walton.
Suicide-obsessed sisters Ginger and Brigitte (nicknamed ""Bee"") have created their own isolated world actively in opposition to their suburban surroundings and cookies-and-milk mother (played by Mimi Rogers, with just enough twitchiness). With artsy-goth flair, they enact and photograph gruesome death scenes that they then present as school projects, and wear matching bird skulls around their necks. In other words, these girls were off-kilter BEFORE Ginger gets bitten by a werewolf and starts to become a creature of the lunar cycles herself.
This unlikely coming-of-age film could be called a (very) twisted version of the sixth-grade filmstrip Julie's Story-remember that one? We were all sent home afterwards with a pink plastic pouch of slender tampons and Noxema, plus a sure knowledge of what to do if your first menstrual cycle shows up in the middle of dance class. Ginger and Bee are late bloomers-both nearly sixteen and without a single visit from Aunt Flo. Their mother-a suburban fashionista in appliqud sweatshirts-eagerly awaits the arrival of her daughters' womanhood, but Ginger and Bee want nothing to do with it. They are trying so hard to be anything but average that when Ginger's monthly visitor does arrive, she says in frustration, ""God, kill yourself to be different and your own body screws you! If I start sniffing around tampon dispensers moaning about PMS, shoot me, OK?""
Ginger's realization that she is afflicted with ""the curse"" and the werewolf attack happen within moments of each other. The movie creates a parallel between the moon-influenced werewolf changes and the 28-day menstrual changes. Suddenly, Ginger is moody, sprouting hair in new places, and more aggressively sexual. Bee takes action, finding a botanical cure that is apparently even more potent than Extra Strength Midol-but Ginger may be too far gone to be saved.
The first half of this movie is delightfully wicked and funny, with the kind of truth to the sisters' morose relationship that could only have been penned by a woman. When the movie gets serious (this is a horror flick after all, and Ginger does ""snap""), it brings up some new questions for a feminist audience, but it never stops being the wonderful popcorn pleaser that it's meant to be!
This is a better horror movie than most out there, and it has, hands-down, the best audio commentary I've heard.",1078790400,5,2539,5.180048661800487

When I got home that night, I put it in the DVD player and saw it didn't have any bonus features. Another bad thing. But then after I hit play, I was captured after the first second. The movie wasn't cheesy, it was amazing.
The opening credits was about as gory as it got, showing death scenes of Ginger and Brigette, and there were a few lame scenes, like when a character gets pu and walks away with a syrnge sticking out of his neck. At least it was funny.
The werewolf effects however, they just made me sad. I was raised on Sci Fi and Horror, so I've seen some amazing graphics in my time, and this indie film just didn't have them. Mimi Rogers was also the only cast member I had ever heard of, but I will defentally be looking for more things with Emily Perkins and Kathrine Isabell. The way that they played their parts, two gothic teenage sisters, was amazing. If you're looking for a horror-slasher film, buy Nightmare on Elm Street, but if your looking for a good horror movie with a lot of blood, amazing acting, and 'dead dogs on every lawn', then rent GS. It's well worth it. I, personally, cannot wait until Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed comes out.

1635021,4,B00005NKSD,"I live in Canada, and this film played in only one theater in my city. I saw it with my girlfriend a thursday night, and it just completely went over my expectations. Let's be clear, this film won't impress you with its storyline, dialogue, exceptional intelligence, or anything in that range. Ginger Snaps had a pretty low budget, but they didn't waste it. There are pretty graphic murders and gore, for fans of the genre. But it's not the only point that could potentially make it interesting...the characters are nice, the relationships are developped, there are surprises, the atmosphere and terror are both rendered in a very appropriate way. The whole movie is simple: two sisters living in a very normal town living in a very normal house go in a very normal high school. One day, one of the sisters is attacked by a mysterious beast, but she's still alive. Later on, the two sisters discover that she changes, not only physically, but in her behavior too. Wait, even though there's a high school, this is not a high school movie, or at least it's not the usual high school movie, for the parts where they're at school. I will say that Ginger Snaps has nothing to do with clichs of any kind...really. The acting is okay, except maybe for Mimi Rogers, but for the rest its very acceptable. The music is good too. The atmosphere is scary enough, and the relationship between the sisters is interesting. This film is a werewolf flick, but it's not only about the beast killing people...it's much more than that. Ginger Snaps tells a classic tale, taking elements of today, but not the ones that would make it a main-stream movie. And that's nice. The gore effects are really amazing at times, and again, they're not the kind of soft-core gore that you find in teen slashers today...in Ginger Snaps, you'll see intestines, cut off body parts, and blood...a considerable amount of it. So, overall, this is a whole lot of fun to watch, especially on an autumn night, when you're alone in the house with or without your girlfriend. You really get in the movie, it's a very nice little film. It's strange; they made an original movie with an unoriginal story...",1065484800,5,2160,4.686842105263158

Second, the people who said ""this is stupid,"" are stupid as well. Why am I the expert? Because I've seen just about every horror movie you've ever heard of and a mountain of ones you'll be glad to never see. That, and I rule. I am right and those that disgree are wrong. Agreed? Good.
This is a classic that unfortunately went straight to video in the States. When I rented it, I had no idea what to expect, but I was extremely surprised at how great Ginger Snaps was. It's inteligent, suspenseful, funny, gruesome, engaging and diabolical.

At first I thought, wow, we might actually get to see an intelligent ""teen"" horror film for once. Oh, well; I was wrong. Instead, like almost every teen movie I've ever seen, the depicted teenagers are stereotypically stupid and ill-mannered to an obnixious, embarassing degree. Every teenager in this movie does at least one of the following things: fights, cusses, smokes, gets high, has sex, listens to garbage music, and generally disrespects all adults. And all adults depicted are ineffectual. And of course, high school is depicted as nothing but a playground, a gathering place for teenage transgressions. And to make matters worse, the sisters' parents and family life are entirely dysfunctional. The mother has concerns about her daughters' coming of age, but she's so comically depicted it's stupid. Too bad, because this could have been an interesting, intelligent subplot between a loving mother trying to raise her off-beat daughters in a cruel world. But as far as the horror/werewolf elements of the film, they are surprisingly good, and thus, the only thing that saves Ginger Snaps from total failure. While I haven't seen tons of teen films, ... If Ginger Snaps had been made with that sensibility ... it would have been a near-brilliant film. The other flaw in the film might be its deadbeat ending. ...

1635034,4,B00005NKSD,"Despite having a goofy title, ""Ginger Snaps"" is a very effective horror movie. Like all the best horror films/novels, there is a real-life subtext to the horror elements. Sure, this movies is about werewolves, in the same way that George Romero's cult classic ""Martin"" is about vampires, but both films use the monster as a metaphor for the transformation from kid to adult and all the [] confusion and guilt and, yes, terror of that transformation. And, too, this movie takes an interesting look at the role of women in society and how girls are ""taught"" to be women. It's not preachy, but it is thought-provoking. And bloody.
The lead characters of ""Ginger Snaps"" are 3-dimensional and their relationships with one another feel authentic. By the time that things start getting seriously out of control, you feel connected to Ginger, her sister, and the drug-guy who's trying to help them, and that makes the ensuing chaos much more effective on a gut level.
The pacing on this movie is perfect. At the beginning, we encounter these two sisters who are rather morbid but otherwise quite likable. When one of them gets bit by a werewolf, however, everything begins to change. The older sister, Ginger, is the one who gets bit and it happens coincidentally (?) at the same time that she has her first period. At first, she and her little sister are only mildly freaked out by the weirdness that ensues. Sure, she's growing a tail and all of a sudden has taken a very STRONG interest in boys, but things don't get really insane until the last third of the film.. at which point all hell breaks loose.
I wouldn't say that ""Ginger Snaps"" belongs up there with the all-time greats (""The Shining"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Martin"", ""Parents"", ""Videodrome"", etc.) but it's totally worth seeking out. Good acting, great script, dark humor, and some seriously scary moments.. what more could you possibly ask for?",1045440000,2,1908,4.820121951219512

I realize that not everybody is into having letterboxed versions and this may not be a movie that you need extras, so the above cautionary note may not apply to you. In that case, the U.S. version should be okay for you.",1043798400,,491,4.655172413793103
1635036,5,B00005NKSD,"A deliciously gory and even erotic horror film about a teenage girl's sexual awakening. However, Ginger doesn't want to make out with boys--she wants to tear their flesh apart! A fantastic film filled with excellent dialogue (Mimi Rogers gets some of the most hilarious lines in the film), sharply drawn characters, and effective horror scenes that mingle terror with arousal--how *does* that guy resist Ginger's bestial advances? More a man that me!
The pre-credit sequence sets off a mood of dawning horror in the midst of surburban banality, and the first werewolf attack is excruciatingly tense and gruesome. The relationship between the two sisters is very real, touching, and, at the end, bittersweet. Kudos also to the filmmakers for not allowing any CGI in this film-- this is all latex, corn syrup, and a guy in a cool werewolf suit.
GINGER SNAPS is I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF meets HEATHERS, or THE FLY meets GHOST WORLD. A bold new film that re-invents the werewolf movie and at the same time the teen drama, GINGER SNAPS gets my highest highest recommendations.

1635038,5,B00005NKSD,"Fans of Xena and La Femme Nikita may remember director John Fawcett from some of the best episodes on both shows. Now he brings us his film ""Ginger Snaps"". A bizarre screenplay from Karen Waldon, this brilliant movie is a gross werewolf story that serves as a mask for a much more gruesome tale: teen-years. By accurately showing the ""horror"" teenagers can go for in discovering their own bodies, their own changes, their own ""powers"", this movie is what ""The Craft"" could've been. Think of it as ""Carrie"" with a werewolf twist.
Ginger and Brigitte Fitzpatrick are a couple of teenage girls living in a really dull suburbia. But these are not your typical American-Pie-gals. Gin and Bri are true outcasts, with a serious contempt for everyone else in their school. On the night of her first menstruation, Ginger is attacked by a werewolf, and when she suddenly starts becoming one, no one will be safe, not even her dear sister.
One of the strong points for this movie is the transformation from human to wolf. It's a great thing that they decided not to go with CGI effects, but rather they used some very old-fashioned make-up tricks. Two thumbs up for that! It made me remember those all-time classics like ""The Howling"" and ""An American Werewolf in London"". Also, it portrays the horrors of adolescence in a dark, cerebral way (also with a very twisted sense of humor) that puts to shame all that nonsense from no-brainer teen flicks like ""American Pie"". The cast is wonderful. The two sisters (complete strangers to me) are great, and Mimi Roger's as their mom is a marvelous and funny character.
Now, for such a good movie, this edition is a crying shame. I hope the people at Amazon.com decide to include on their catalog the excellent Collector's Edition made in Canada, with full biography of the cast and crew, 2 commentary tracks by John Fawcett and Karen Waldon and several other features, including a slideshow of Ginger and Brigitte's school project. Wherever you get it, be sure to watch this movie. It barely got some attention at theaters over here, but I can guarantee you that you're standing in front of a future cult classic.
Also, for all Xena fans around the world, Lucy Lawless has a small voice cameo in this movie as the woman in the school's PA system.",1039737600,7,2279,4.714285714285714

1635040,3,B00005NKSD,"Like DOG SOLDIERS, another werewolf movie (which I found to be great fun), I had heard a lot about GINGER SNAPS before I saw it. What's weird about this is that it, like DOG SOLDIERS, didn't get a theatrical release in the U.S. Now to not get a theatrical release in the U.S. and to still hear plenty of positive buzz about a film that's got to mean something right? That's right!
 Let me start off by saying that I am a movie fanatic. I watch a lot of movies. I mean a lot of movies and for something that went straight to video in the U.S. to stand out to me that's saying something. GINGER SNAPS does just that. It stands out. It doesn't seam cheap or low budget and I'm sure for a Canadian made movie that it probably isn't.
In the film, sixteen-year-old Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) and fifteen year old Brigitte (Emily Perkins) are sisters with a disturbing bond. Their sibling connection runs deep and they share an understanding that is totally unique from the world they live in. Although their existence is a dark one, they live in a world that is truly of their own creation. And the only thing that stands to destroy their bond is the monstrous effect that puberty has on Ginger.
GINGER SNAPS is a rare horror genre gem. It's a movie about the bonds of the family, society, and adolescence.). It's also quite funny at times. I wouldn't call it a comedy necessarily but like the brilliant DOG SOLDIERS it is somewhat of a dark, horror comedy.
In my opinion, GINGER SNAPS will be the film that reinvents the werewolf genre that has lain dormant pretty much since the mid-eighties. After this film and DOG SOLDIERS, Hollywood will no doubt start trying to cash in on the werewolf craze again. (I've already heard that Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven are working on one and there's another project with werewolves and vampires called UNDERWORLD with Kate Beckinsale.) I welcome this though. I like the concept of werewolves. However, I must say that topping this (and DOG SOLDIERS) will be a feat and Hollywood may just have its hands full.

1635041,4,B00005NKSD,"""Ginger Snaps"" is a suprise sleeper.  Like ""The Company Of Wolves"", this film deals with the aspects of puberty and the metamorphosis of a girl... becoming a woman.  Sure there's a werewolf storyline here, but the heart of the movie comes from the relationship between the two sisters, Brigett and Ginger.  Without these intimate characters, this could have been just a campy low budget movie.  There is a bit of campiness to the film, but it doesn't overshadow the plot.  The effects are low budget, so don't expect ""An American Werewolf In London"" Rick Baker wizardry here.  But you should expect an enteraining horror film with characters you care about.  Katharine Isabelle (Ginger) and Emily Perkins (Brigette) are fantastic and hopefully have promising film careers ahead of them.  Heads Up:  There is a Canadian DVD version of this film that offers a Widescreen Format and loads of extras (including some great and crucial deleted scenes)",1036627200,7,945,5.04516129032258

The characters are very fleshed out, and the relationship between the sisters is more the focal point than the werewolf story. Rather than describing it as a horror film about two sisters, I'd call it an exploration of an extremely close relationship between two sisters who are faced with the problem of one being bitten by a werewolf. Their relationship changes as Ginger (the bitten sister) changes into a werewolf.
And in keeping with the genre, it does follow some of the rules of teen horror films. However it does it subtly enough that you don't feel as though your watching something formulaic, but your appetite for the genre is satiated.

It stars the lovely young actress Katharine Isabelle who plays Ginger, the teenage victim of a freaky looking lycanthrope. Needless to say there is a lot of blood, gore and special effects in this movie.

1635046,5,B00005NKSD,"Such is the oath taken between sisters Brigette (Emily Perkins) and Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) at age eight, ""Together forever, united against life as we know it.""
Living in the terminally-boring Canadian town of Bailey Downs, the two sisters are willing outcasts, although one gets the very-real sense that Ginger has every intention of forcing Brigette to adhere to their eight-year-old oath of suicide.
With a totally obvlivious mother (Mimi Rogers) and a cypher-father, the two sisters indulge their morbid side, taking a series of false-suicide photos for a class project.
When Brigette is picked on by one of the popular girls during a field-hockey match at gym, the two sisters plan revenge -- to kill the girl's dog and make it look like the mysterious ""Beast of Bailey Downs,"" which has been cutting a bloody swath through the town's pets, had done it.
But, in an ironic twist, while hunting down the dog, Ginger experiences her first period -- and the blood attracts the Beast, who mauls Ginger.  The two sisters flee, the Beast follows, and gets spattered all over the road by Sam's (Kris Lemche) van.
Ginger begins sprouting hair in odd places, getting new urges, growing a tail, watching her fingernails become talons, and noticing boys.
Sound like puberty (except for the talons and tail)?  It should, because the female cycle, puberty, and lycanthropy all become hopelessly intertwined in this incredible film.
I've always been a fan of horror, although my tastes run more for the old Hammer and Universal films.  This movie, and Dog Soldiers, two non-US werewolf films, have revitalized my interest in the genre, long-dead after ""American Werewolf in London"" sparked it briefly.
The Artisan DVD is bare-bones, no chapter stops, no behind-the-scenes, merely the options to play the movie or watch the theater promo.  Still, I can listen to the opening music from the ""title page"" of the DVD over and over again.
Still, it is an excellent movie, one I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who loves werewolf movies.  It may detract from some of the more common myths (the full moon doesn't have anything to do with the change, silver bullets are nowhere to be seen, and lycanthropy is treated more like a virus or disease than a mystical affliction), but it remains true to itself.
I won't reveal any more, this is a must-see film.

Ginger Snaps is a new and inventive twist on the classic 'werewolf' tale.  It's supsenseful through its whole course, and it tapped deeply into my emotions and kept them running on a high throughout the whole movie.
Ginger Snaps mainly follows the story of two very close-knit sisters through a journey showcasing their love for one another, their pain, and their misfortunes.  The sisters, Ginger and Brigitte, have very dark qualities to them however.  They stage their own deaths quite frequently, and they're very much outcasts of society and teased on by their peers.  All of this brings them closer together however.  One night while walking through the woods together, Ginger is attacked by some sort of savage beast, but her sister manages to get her home safely.  Or so they think.  Ginger slowly starts developing werewolf type characteristics.  But through this however, the sisterly bond remiains intact.  It seems as if nothing can come between these two devoted sisters.
The movie is very well made, and I constantly found myself glued all the way through. I deeply felt and cared for both sisters and admired their unbreakable bond and even became a tad bit envious of it.  Lots of people go through their entire life without becoming this close to someone.  Ginger Snaps isn't a movie just about werewolfs, it also taps into your emotions and tells a wonderful story of sisterly bond and devotion.

First the good news: the first half (or less than half) of the film was actually pretty good.  We're introduced to the two outcast sisters, pulling their antics for attention, and getting hell from their classmates.  If we had been given some sort of plot to follow through on this it could've ended up being a good film.  Additionally, the acting is above par, especially the lead.
Unforunately, once we're introduced to the supernatural element (extraordinarily lame effects) of the ""werewolf"", it all goes downhill.  The plot is tossed together as they go along and the drugdealer ends up being the hero.  He's one of the better characters, but he's not nearly enough to pull it out of the gutter.
I give it one star for the acting, and another for the possibility it showed in the beginning.

Vampire's went from being soulless evil bloodsuckers to misunderstood addicts and serial killers went from being horrifying to quaintly fascinating.  Now, we get Ginger Snaps, a well-crafted film that attempts to expand the genre while still maintaining some good scares.  For the most part, it works.  Ginger and Brigette are a typical pair of brooding sisters.  Neither one seems to fit in with in-crowd so they hang out together and shoot disturbing photographs.
Then, one night they are attacked by ""something"" which bites Ginger.  I think you can guess what happens from there.  The twist is that Ginger is now beginning her period.  She is becoming a woman at the same time she is becoming a werewolf.  I wonder which is scarier for her.
The film gets high marks for this clever premise (Werewolfism as sexual awakening), but loses them in the execution.  Ginger develops mad-scientist syndrome -- ""I'm fine, you're the one who is screwed up!""-type of thinking.  It's irritating watching a character be so self-destructive.  The other problem I have is their parents.  Mimi Rogers WAY overreacts to one situation and almost turns this into a screwball comedy.  Also, the movie is really more teen coming-of-age drama until a climactic (and pretty good) ending.
The Canadian DVD has way more extras than the American version.  If you like the movie try to track it down.  If you're just curious about the movie, though, the American version is just fine.

(and I do realize that feminist horror movies are few and far in between) Bottom line: If you are looking for a quality and entertaining werewolf movie, Ginger Snaps is your best bet.  If you are looking for a feminist horror experience, skip the ""stepford wives"" and go directly for Ginger Snaps.",1015200000,3,813,4.704225352112676
1635063,5,B00005NKSD,"Although there are a few horror movies that make their way into wide-release theatres and are truly worth it (The Others, Jeepers Creepers), there a few gems that are always kept undertow. Ginger Snaps is definitely one of them. After reading many positive reviews for about half a year, I finally got my hands on a copy. And I loved it. I place it high on my list of horror movies.
 The story tells the tale of two goth sisters, Brigitte and Ginger, who have always stuck by each other's side. While attempting to play a trick on someone at night, Ginger is viciously attacked (Incredible directing during that scene!) by what seemed like a wild dog. After this, Ginger begins to change dramatically, and not the way a growing young woman should change.
 Ginger Snaps, while in itself is a horror, has plenty of dramatic elements. The bond between the two sisters is shown tight in the beginning, and throughout the movie when it begins to loosen, we can truly feel the feelings of Brigitte as she watches Ginger change and as she does all that she can to save her sister. Emily Perkins (Brigitte) and Katherine Isabelle (Ginger) perfected their roles, and gave a lot of depth to their character, making the movie more enjoyable. The mood is set right in every scene, and there is never an off scene. It looks as if John Fawcett definitely knows how to set the mood. And I praise the special effects department of Ginger Snaps. The werewolf looked great and was never once hokey looking.
 While Ginger Snaps never made it to wide release here in the states, I hope it finds a fan base on dvd (Very jealous of the Canadians who have a special edition) & video. It deserves it.",1013990400,3,1676,4.543046357615894
1635064,4,B00005NKSD,"First - the movie is brilliant.  What the film makers and cast did with only $3 million puts most $20 million films, ""horror"" or otherwise, to shame.  The writing, acting direction, music and cinematography are all top notch, with the occasional blemish more than forgivable considering the budget.  God - I'd love to see the film they would have made with some real money.  The only reason I can fathom it didn't make $50 million in the theaters is that TVA International had no desire (and/or budget) to market it.
So how is the story - the most important part?  Believe me - when I first heard ""werewolf movie"" my first thought was ""Yawn"". Luckily - I read so many ""love this flick"" comments on AICN and other sites, I decided to risk the $4 for a rental.  I was blown away as the movie exceeded every expectation I had (which were admittedly pretty low when I first pressed ""play"").  The characters are real, believable and you really want them to get through this.  Unlike so many recent ""horror"" films that follow the ""Abercrombie ad teens hunted one by one by a faceless slasher while they make 'horror movie rules' jokes"" formula - it is not self or pop culture referential.  The humor is great and totally organic to the characters and not the ""nudge, wink, we are in a movie"" type that we keep seeing today.  There are some good scares, but they are made so much better because you really do care about the Fitzgerald sisters and what happens to them.  They look, act and talk like 15-16 year olds would  -  not 26-year old fashion model ""teens"" adding even more to the believability.  The last shot before the credits role is... well... that would be a spoiler - but suffice it to say that it is perfect, unforgettable, and cements this one as a ""must own"".
As others have said, the American version is OK for just viewing the film, but If like me, you want to add it to your collection - seek out the Canadian Collector's Edition version for only a couple of bucks more (don't panic when you see the price - one Canadian dollar is worth about 60 US).  Widescreen, Dolby 5.1, commentaries, animated menus and tons of supplements.  The American version of the DVD (from Artisan, who were smart enough to snap up ""Blair Witch"" but were clueless about the real gold they had here) doesn't even have a scene selection menu, so the best thing I can say about it is that you don't have to rewind it at the end of the movie.",1013644800,4,2428,4.446952595936795

1635067,5,B00005NKSD,"I literally just finished watching this movie, and i want to write this out while it's still fresh in my mind. It's so good i'm going to leave some things out, for brevity, or so as not to spoil it if you haven't seen it.
  The horror genre is about as played out as they get. Worse still is the teen-geared slasher (Please God, don't ever make me look at that Scream mask again). So, imagine my delight when a movie that fits that pigeonhole still surprises me, keeps me interested, and, wonder of wonders, actually scares me from time to time. This is a gorefest, sure, but a top-of-the line one.
  The premise, first of all, is pretty clever. Use the transformation from human to something wholly unfamiliar, brutal and horrifying as a metaphor for the changes young people, specifically young women, face when ""the curse"" kicks in. In the case of our antiheroine Ginger, these two coincide.
  The night her first period begins, she is mauled by some enormous beast we hardly see, in a panicky sequence filled with quick cuts and shaky camerawork. (This technique may irk some viewers by being too stylish; i thought it added chaos and confusion to the scene in a way that worked.) After the attack, her body begins gradually to, uh, blossom, in ways that terrify and fascinate her, and that may seem eerily familiar to pubescent girls. Odd sudden hair growth, new body parts sprouting up (Ginger starts growing a grotesquely realistic tail), and new shall-we-say ""hungers"" are perfectly normal parts of becoming a woman, or so she's told by out-to-lunch guidance counsellors and gee-whiz June Cleaver wannabe Mom.
(The ""grownups just don't understand"" thing may seem clich now, but it didn't when you were 15.)
  The acting is great all around. Katharine Isabelle does a fantastic job of portraying Ginger's combination of horror and pride at the transformation she's undergoing. Emily Perkins does equally well with the more subtle job of sister Brigitte's on-the-one-hand fear for her older sister's health, and on-the-other-hand underlying envy that this metamorphosis is leaving her behind as her sister becomes, well, whatever she's becoming. There are a couple levels here, and the two actors are so good, they hold it together seamlessly.
  They also nail every opportunity for comic relief. The dialogue is sharp and lifelike, way beyond the drivel that Hollywood seems to think flows from the mouths of teens. The effect is that the humour keeps the story from getting bogged down in grimness but never distracts you from the fear running through each scene.
  One other note on Perkins' performance. She carries the emotional weight of this movie; as Ginger becomes less and less human, we see Brigitte transforming as well, deperately trying to save her doomed sister. The script gives her a bit more to do than scream and run, and she takes full advantage. The credit for my emotional response to the tragedy of this story is mostly hers.
  And the special effects. Well, as several other reviewers have said, bravo for shunning the CGI route. For all i know the decision to use puppets and real-life models instead of scream-at-thin-air-and-we'll-draw-it-in-later stuff might have been due to budget. Whatever. It works. The beast itself appears only rarely and briefly, building suspense and actually making us afraid of what's behind the next corner. (remember why ""Alien"" was good?)  When we do see it, the creature dodges the risk of being, well, silly-looking, as many latex-and fur horrors are, and is as menacing as it needs to be. The film at times had a B-movie feel, i assumed that was intentional. I didn't need it to be slick and expensive-looking. I just wanted well-made, and scary. This movie more than delivers. It exceeded my expectations.",1011571200,3,3773,4.929022082018927

1635069,5,B00005NKSD,"Or, at least, it got in mine. Like a song that keeps playing, I found myself alternatively laughing and being depressed over this film for the following week (watching it over and over only slightly lessened this). I think, like me, anyone who didn't fit in during their high school years will immediately identify with the main characters. I think that this movie works as a horror film for all the reasons that most horror movies are fun to watch, but not scary. Horror, true horror, doesn't rely on things jumping out at the screen when you least (or most) expect it. The scariest form of horror is psychological. Ginger Snaps doesn't go for cheap scares, it pulls you in with it's unusual approach. Try and name a villain in this movie... there isn't one. Anonymously masked killers don't scare me. My loved one changing in front of my eyes... now THAT scares me. By the by, the collectors edition is available on DVD in Canada, and it contains all sorts of juicy features that this one doesn't have (like widescreen).",1010448000,6,1022,4.651933701657459
1635074,5,B00005NKSD,"Ok, well when I first heard the title of this film, I had no clue what it was about.  Then I saw the trailer and I thought, ah, another stupid American teen ""horror"" flick.  But THEN, I read some reviews on-line after the film had come out on DVD.  And I was quite surprised to learn how many people thought it was a really good movie!  In fact, one site even named the Canadian release one of the best 10 DVDs of the year!  Wow.
Based on such reviews, I decided to buy the DVD, sight-unseen (glad I did!).  The version I got was the Artisan American version (pretty inexpensive used if you can find it).  The Canadian version is the better DVD though, as it is the ""special"" edition with Dolby Surround, widescreen, commentary, featurettes, screen tests, etc.  The American version is full frame and only as a trailer...it's pro logic sound, too, not Dolby surround.  Apparently, the film was a matted widescreen, so you probably see more of the film on the American version, but it's about 1.85:1, I think, so the difference isn't that much.
Anyhow, the film is very good!  I join with the appraising chorus.  It deals with two Goth-y teen sisters, one of whom (Ginger) gets bitten one night by a wild animal.  From that point on, a strange metamorphosis comes over her.  This is a werewolf movie and it takes the subject matter quite seriously.  The two leading actresses are really good and don't spend the movie pouting or trying to be glamorous.  Instead, they actually ACT believably.  This is not a ""Scream"" film or a ""I know last summer blah blah"" film.  There are true horror elements here as well as a true emotional base.  You care about the lead actresses as well as the story (unlike most American films which sadly have devolved into a series of chases or CGI scenes that don't really add much to any perceivable plotline).  In fact, the special effect work in this film is almost an afterthought.
Now, I'm a film buff, so I've seen a lot of movies.  Take my word, this film is EASILY one of the best horror films I've seen in a while.  It is to monster horror movies what ""Sixth Sense"" is to ghost stories or ""The Haunting"" (original 60s version) is to haunted house movies.  Strong 5 stars!!",1010275200,4,2208,4.481203007518797

Also it was a little too serious for me. It had pretty good acting and special effects, but that is where it stops. Any parent that is as stupid as those portrayed in this film should be taken out behind the woodshed. All in all I think that I was generous giving this movie two stars.

1635078,4,B00005NKSD,"This was so nearly one of the best horror films ever... As a rule, most horror movies, let alone werewolf movies, tend to be unimaginative rehashes of the same old cliches.  This, most definitely, is something different.  But it's not perfect, not quite.
I rented the video after reading several glowing reviews; for the main part i agree with them.  I also had the feeling it would appeal to the slightly twisted sense of humour i share with the friend i watched it with.  And it did.  We were cackling so loudly at some points we got told to shut up by the neighbours; what i love about the film is its comedy.  Most of the time it goes way beyond black humour to something else entirely.  Fortunately, it's also hysterically funny, at the expense of the bitchy, popular victims of Ginger's transformation.  ""Shallow grave?""  ""Seems appropriate."" is the one liner i can't get out of my head, but there are many other moments in the first half of the film that made us giggle.  The faked death scenes have to be seen to be believed - best title sequence in the world ever. The second half is different, though, as a sense of inevitability descends, and the gloom pervades more than anything.
I was hugely impressed with the characters, and the relationships between them; the fact that Bridget is the heroine at the heart of the film rather than the frighteningly assured
Ginger makes for a far more interesting experience.  The way she moves from being the younger sister reluctant to act on her own, to the smart cookie who calmly deals with each new crisis in a surrealy adult way was incredible to watch.  The girl literally never smiles, but she conveys the weight of the world while Ginger gets to go off and have all the fun...  Total kudos to the actresses and writers for putting such a different spin on things...
Other points include an interesting spin on werewolf mythology: the virus concept that's been used for vampirism before, and the use of monkshood/ wolfsbane to cure it.  Loved the scenes when they prepare it like they're about to shoot up.  So deliciously ironic.  Ginger's confusion about what her condition actually means is memorable: the way she starts dressing, and the moments when she sashays down the school corridor like a panther on the prowl to wolf whistles.  And the classic line: ""I had an ache, and I thought it was for sex, but its actually to tear everything to *(...) pieces."" So true.  The way her hair changes is also cool...
And Mimi Rodger's performance as their mother is sublime. A truly inspired character for most of the movie, the moment when she changes all the rules near the end is totally unexpected.  Did not see that coming.  My only quibble is that it's not given any sense of follow-up or closure.  More of that later...
Ok, was not impressed with the animatronics.  It fared slightly better than Buffy's laughable efforts with werewolves, but this is just another case of film makers not realising that more is less. We did not need to see as much as we did of the final beast, and it didn't add anything to the story.  It only had emotional impact while it bore some resemblance to Ginger.
My main reason for only giving this four stars is the ending.  I notice with some trepidation that no-one else has mentioned this in reviews, so maybe it was just me.  It was one of the worst endings to such a good film that i have ever seen.  Infact, the whole of the last act goes downhill in an attempt to make an action sequence in the basement that was previously not nearly so scary...  The reason it annoyed me so much at first was that Bridget spent so much of the film being a quirky, smart character.  Then she descends into the basement, and acts pretty much like any other silly horror heroine.  Why did Sam think he had a chance in hell of injecting Ginger?? Why does Bridget just wander around with the syringe and never use it, either on herself or Ginger...  Even if Ginger has to die, a better ending would have had Bridget picking herself up, using the cure and getting on with life instead of still being trapped in the same tableaux of death with Ginger that the movie began with.  There's no doubt that the character progresses, but she seems to revert in the end; and it's just not satisfying.  There are so many directions this could have taken, with its themes of the sisters preferring death to adulthood.  Bridget grows up mentally and emotionally; Ginger grows up physically, but nowhere near as mature as her little sister.  I was literally screaming at the screen as the credits rolled; if the point was to leave every thread left untied, they succeeded.  Every tantalising hint that had been dropped before was just left hanging; including where the girls' parents were.  That was a whole other story in itself that needed answers.  (...) the creature didn't feel like Ginger anymore at the end; and this lost the impact of Bridget killing her...  Maybe it was just me, but it all felt unfinished, and not just so a sequel could be tacked on later...  In many ways, this ruined what had been a truly original, highly entertaining film.  I recommend it; but I would also recommend another ending entirely...",1007337600,6,5188,4.590662323561347

Check out what you get on the American DVD from Artisan: the movie. And a trailer. And it's NOT EVEN LETTERBOXED! That's, like, complete adding-insult-to-injury.
Check out the American packaging too, it makes it look just exactly like the cheesy teeny-bopper horror film this definitely IS NOT. 'Hungry like the Wolf.' Give me a break.

1635083,5,B00005NKSD,"Without doubt the best horror movie of the year, and one of the best movies in general as well.  In it, we see Ginger transform into a wolf as her period starts.  Perhaps the use of monstrous change as a metaphor for the teenage years has already been done on Buffy (Oz!), but the R-rating means that this film can be a lot more explicit, and thus more harrowing.  Thankfully steering away from lesser horror flicks such as Urban Legend and I Know What You Did Last Summer, this has plenty of gore and plenty of scares on top of that.  There are a lot of jumpy moments and the pain that Ginger goes through is palpable.  Performance-wise this is fantastic, with Katherine Isabelle thrusting herself into the limelight (she'll also soon be starring in the much-discussed Christopher Nolan project, 'Insomnia') and Emily Perkins coming close behind.  Mimi Rogers is a great bargain as the mother who wants to understand her children, even if it is an easy role to play.  Yet the most distinguishable thing about 'Ginger Snaps' is the fact that it is also very sad, with themes of friendship and sisterly solidarity running throughout the movie.  Not since 'Scream' has there been a horror movie such as this that has the ability to make its audience think as well as jump out of their seats.",1005436800,,1289,4.62280701754386

1635086,5,B00005NKSD,"As everyone knows adolescence can be pure hell.  Peer pressure, self image issues, dating, sex, parents, and school are all sources for teen angst.  Not to mention those frightening physical transitions our bodies begin to undergo as we transform into adults.  Of course the ultimate cause of all this turmoil is the greatly increased levels of hormones raging throughout our circulatory systems, hormones that are instigating these scary physical changes as well as creating hypersensitive emotions.  Its really quite surprising no one has made a film that draws a parallel between adolescent change and lycanthropy. Well, thats not quite true; there have been a few- ""I Was A Teenage Werewolf"", ""Teen Wolf"" etc.  But they were all from a male teen perspective (BTW, in case you haven't noticed, male teens undergo far less dramatic changes in their bodies than do females) never from a female teens POV.  Until now that is.
  Screenwriter Karen Walton and director John Fawcett have given us a very intelligent and frightening horror film (and to get these two qualities in combination in a horror film these days is something of a rarity).  This isn't one of those plotless teen exploitation date movies that Hollywood churns out with nauseating regularity, it really is a very well made little film that will appeal to almost any discerning horror fan.  I am a firm believer that the vast majority of the really good horror movies to have been made over the past few decades are coming from the indie circuit.  ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Halloween"",
""Evil Dead"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" are good examples of quality indie horror films and now, I think, ""Ginger Snaps"" belongs on this list as well.
  For me to have any kind of emotional charge with the events happening in a horror movie I have to be able to believe in or somehow relate to the charcters in the film.  In ""Ginger Snaps"" Karen Walton's fine script goes a long way to providing me with that emotional investment but it would not have been as nearly complete if not for the extremely fine performances of Emily Perkins as Ginger's sister Bridget and Katharine Isabelle as Ginger.  These two young ladies are exceptionally fine actresses and a I hope they get the chance to do bigger and better things in future, they deserve it.  Fawcett's direction is sure handed and professional.  I particularly liked the way he holds off showing the creature until the end.  By giving us quick glimpses of the werewolf only serves to heighten the suspense.  As for the creature itself I think it is of the same quality as that of ""An American Werewolf In London""; there is no CGI, its all done with animatronics.
  So, if you like horror films and werewolf movies in particular you need to see this one.  I bought ""Ginger Snaps"" based upon the convictions of the reviews here and elsewhere, needless to say I was not dissapointed and I'm sure you won't be either.",1004572800,4,2926,4.786852589641434
1635087,5,B00005NKSD,"This movie is so good, I won't even bother trying to explain it.  This is easily the best werewolf movie I've ever seen, and one of the best horror movies in the last 30 years.  I rate this right up there with the Evil Dead series.  You are just a sick person if you don't see it.",1004227200,,280,3.8771929824561404
1635088,3,B00005NKSD,"Like so much the victims that we see in them time after time, some horror film cliches deserve to live. And, of course, some deserve to die.
But just like any film where lots of people are attacked and mauled, not all the deserving cliches croak in ""Ginger Snaps.""
This Canadian, straight-to-video-in-the-U.S. sleeper hit is the story of two teenage misfits,Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) and Brigitte (Emily Perkins) Fitzgerald, who are obsessed with death and black-humored pranks. At school, they're taunted with the word 'freak' and at home, they're lulled to sleep by brainless suburban parents. To keep themselves amused, they arrange ""deaths""--stunts set up to look like the real thing--and take pictures of them for art class. But one night, while trying to kidnap a bully's dog, Ginger and Brigitte meet an unexpected surprise while out late at night. What happens after that brings a new meaning to ""the female curse.""
Beginning with the neighbor's dog, Ginger slowly builds up an uncontrollable urge to ""rip living things to pieces"", as she aptly puts it. While in the beginning Ginger tries earnestly to resist, she's indulged her now-natural inclination for blood by the end of the film and pays the ultimate price for it, but only after making the transition from human to beast.
In the shadows of Ginger's bombast is Brigitte, her younger, quirkier sister who's always followed Ginger's lead. But once her older sister begins to let go of who she was, Brigitte finds herself thrust into the role of an unwilling, scared heroine. The only tragic part is that her heroics come too late to save her sister.
On the positive side, ""Ginger Snaps"" has a better, more beliveable story than either ""Wilderness"" or ""An American Werewolf In Paris"". There's no local legend or family history to speak of, and we don't see the werewolf untill Ginger is actually attacked. There's also some believability in the sense that the seemingly unknown cast lend an appropriate sense of the ordinary to the suburban hell Ginger and Brigitte call Bailey Downs. Nowhere in this film is the  glossy, picture-perfect, party-hardy, brainless MTV lifestyle element that wrecked ""An American In Paris"", so forget about sticking around after the credits for a music video or two, because it ain't gonna happen. This film doesn't have a Hollywood ending, either--Ginger is accidentally killed by Brigitte after she completes the transformation from teenager to werewolf, leaving Brigitte to quietly sob over the beast's dead body. There is no salvation. No un-wolfing, just death and a string quartet during the credits.
Even more importantly is the subplot between Ginger and Brigitte. Once Ginger has her period, things begin to change between the two sisters. In the beginning of the film, they're tight buddies and live in the basement of their house and think up new pranks and new ways to die. At the end, they don't even know eachother anymore. Many other reviewers like to compare Ginger's horrific transformation into a werewolf to the hell of female puberty, and in that sense, this film is quite possibly the first foray into a new sub-genre--feminist horror.
In addition, the gore in this film is truly terrifying, whether it's in the films and photographs Ginger and Brigitte make of faked, horrific deaths for an art class or the actual carnage of mauled bodies and ripped-up dogs. Unlike in some Hollywood films, the remedy for werewolfism, or lycanthropy, is a syringe full of some hard-to-find plant that combats infection by producing white blood cells--a believable, if too-late cure.
But that's where the film's freshness ends. On the down side, ""Ginger Snaps"" has the heart of a typical teen slasher flick, in which a social reject finds a macabre and grossly exaggerated way of repaying the school bullies for all the petty tormenting teenagers put eachother through. Ginger herself has a huge problem with peers and authority, like many teens, simply because they're repressive, cruel and ignorant. Once Ginger begins her transformation, she predictably begins to get revenge. And you guessed it--the beautiful people DIE after she begins stealing and killing their dogs. When the dogs aren't enough, she starts killing actual people, beginning with the bully-tease that taunts them in gym class and ending with her sister.
Along the way, Ginger undergoes the standard human-to-werewolf transformation. First, she gets the pointy-curvy fingernails, then the sharp, pointy teeth. Then streaks of white hair on her body. Towards the end of the film, her face has completely changed and the transformation comes full swing in the back of a van on the way home, complete with slimey mutations and moaning and human limbs taking on canine attributes; the actual werewolf is an animatronics classic.
But it's a classic we've seen many times before. After a few viewings, it seems almost as if ""Ginger Snaps"" can't live without both the new and the not-so-new in order to keep the story moving. True, if this is a film about a teenage werewolf, then the audience has to find something to tell them exactly that; the craft is in HOW it's done. To have Ginger howling at the moon, transforming, going out and killing and coming home again would be a waste of time because we've seen that before. However, to take such an horror film protagonistas a teenage social misft and put that character in a typical revenge scenario is also a waste of time because moviegoers know, even if they don't watch horror flicks regularly (myself included), that the ""disgruntled-protagonist-gets-revenge"" is one that's been used in films for nearly three decades.
So while the disgruntled protagonists in ""Ginger Snaps"" right all the high school wrongs in the form of bloody murder, the film itself could learn something from Ginger in the ways of rejecting what have become standard, uninteresting horror genre cliches.",1004227200,,5898,5.0741503604531415
1635089,5,B00005NKSD,"""The Wolf Man,"" ""An American Werewolf In London,"" ""Werewolf of London,"" ""The Howling,"" ""Curse of the Werewolf,"" and...""Ginger Snaps.""  That is how I would rate this great werewolf film based on the past cinematic lycanthropes!  This film is not just a werewolf film, however, it is a wonderfully frank and intelligent horror/ teen film although categorizing it a ""teen"" film does it a diservice.  Film captures the werewolf pathos that only a few select films have mangaged to to sort of capture Lon Chaney Jr's original ""man.""  The believable characters give credit to the horror genre in the vein of Stephen King's and Siodmak's best work.  There is real power in the sister relationship and credit is due to the two fine actresses, Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle.  The special effects are awesome not cgi-crap but old-school animatronics that look refreshingly new and unique.  This is a fun, thoughtful film that is great for Halloween or anytime of year.  You're not a true horror OR film fan if you don't give this disc a whirl. Only and I do mean ONLY gripe is with the DVD itself:  Rent this one until they relase the Canadian special edition disc, but do RENT it or they may never feel that it will sell well enough here to warrant the SE disc!",1004227200,5,1259,4.712328767123288
1635090,5,B00005NKSD,"GINGER SNAPS ranks just under AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON in my list of the best werewolf movies ever made. It's amazing to see such a well-made horror film that centers on young people, especially these days. It takes its subject very seriously, yet still manages to inject shades of dark humor at times. My favorite aspect of this film is that things never happened the way I expected them to, and given that I'm a lifelong horror fan, that's not something I normally see. I highly recommend GINGER SNAPS to anyone who likes to get scared while not having their intelligence insulted.",1003795200,5,589,4.728155339805825

If you want something with more substance, then check this movie out. As one poster noted, it really is a shame that this movie was so passed over. Guaranteed to be a cult classic, Ginger Snaps will scare the living daylights out of you, or at least make you squirm.
Ginger, one of the two main characters, gets bit by a not-so-friendly woodland creature and starts to change bit by bit into a werewolf, with her sister watching with horror and fascination.",1001894400,,605,4.771428571428571
