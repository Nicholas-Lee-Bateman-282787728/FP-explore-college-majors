4368292,5,B004FGA2LM,"I have watched the majority of 3D Blu-Ray's released so far. The Ultimate Wave Tahiti is the best 3D release to date. Tahiti is a place meant to be filmed in high definition. Add 3D to the mix and you have a reference quality 3D Blu-Ray. As of now, I think this is as good as it gets in 3D home entertainment. The depth on this film is pretty amazing. The underwater scenes with the fish look incredible in 3D. A few scenes did have extremely minimal ghosting, but for the most part, it was hardly noticeable.

As for the movie itself, it is really good. It's much more then a surf film. It's educational as well. You learn a little about the culture of Tahiti, how the islands were formed, and daily life. You also get to experience the natural beauty of Tahiti. The surfing scenes are excellent.

Overall, I highly recommend this Blu-Ray to everyone who has a 3D setup. This is as good as it gets right now for 3D. You can't beat the price either. For only $15, you can't go wrong. Most of the 3D Blu-Ray's are in the $30 range. Ultimate Wave Tahiti blows the majority of them away for 3D content.",1301011200,,1099,4.278846153846154
4368293,5,B004FGA2LM,"Awesome 3D effects.. if you just bought a 3D tv, this is one of if not the best films to showcase this effects. The coral reef section in 3D is amazing.. feels like you're underwater. The film story itself is just not that great, not really much, but my 5 star is based on the amazing 3D effects.",1300838400,,296,4.120689655172414
4368294,4,B004FGA2LM,"I'm not too much into surfing, but this dvd has some very good 3D effects, very powerful waves, pretty scenic also. I bought this not only for the decent price, but because it's one of the newer releases from IMax theaters. There are great surfers in this movie, kids & adults... this is a unique & different movie in my library, somewhat educational... I recommend.",1300233600,8,366,4.6461538461538465
4368295,4,B004FGA2LM,"The images are very beautiful and 3D effects are very good....

But not to much Surf on the video and you can not see the 3D effect when someone is in the wave, only when the board comes very close to the screen.

Slater appears more acting than surfing.

But anyway, I liked the movie because the sea and all the images are very beautiful.

But do not expect a typical Surf movie with several surfers catching and destroying the waves.",1300233600,3,436,4.345679012345679

4368299,5,B004FGA2LM,"OK, this Blu-Ray shows great 3D.  Surfing photography has excellent traditions and techniques, and this movie uses them all. 3D cameras are placed underwater, at the surface of the waves, on the surfboards themselves, in helicopters, and in the faces of some beautiful women.  The camerawork is top rate and the 3D production is as well. The material lends itself to 3D, as we are looking through the tubes of waves, down their crests, and through their glistening faces.  The Blu-Ray also gives nice 3D graphic rendering of the science of volcanic island formation, and also of wave development, transmission, and breaking. Some of the most easily understood science, and made so by the advantage of 3D graphics.

This Blu-Ray will look better on a bigger screen, so a 3D projector would be best.",1298937600,65,797,4.925373134328358
4368300,5,B004FGA2LM,"I saw this film at the IMAX at USC and had been chomping at the bit for months to see it because of my love of surfing and my admiration for Kelly Slater, Raimana and watching Chopes explode!

Surfers that are expecting a Taylor Steele, Jack McCoy, Matt Beauchesne or any other of the latest surf auteurs high performance surfing flicks will be somewhat disappointed.  At first.

As a guy that grew up loving the ocean and riding waves, this movie really impressed me in its scientific approach to the mechanics of how, why and in what form do waves exist?

If you're going to use a case study to explain the mechanics of waves; Teahupoo is the perfect mutant model to study.  I have never been to Teahupoo, but know people that have, and to hear their stories of sitting in the channel on a boat watching the lineup while the ocean just kind of drops out and forms this perfect thick monstrous slab of a wave, just mere meters in front of them, is mind blowing.

The interesting thing about the mechanics of waves is that there are all sorts of examples.  Which is why the World Surfing Tour tries to search out the best wave types all over the world to find the most well rounded surfers that can excel the best in all wave types; reef breaks, beach breaks, lefts, rights, powerful big waves, smaller waves, faster waves, etc..

What's cool about Ultimate Wave Tahiti is that you kind of get it all in a short film.  You get great surfing by great surfers.  A beautiful backdrop and culture.  And best of all you get a great education on the how and why waves exist.

I recommend this movie for both the surfer, the arm chair surfer and anyone interested in the science of waves.",1296604800,25,1681,4.4045307443365695

I watched this IMAX thriller with the mindset of an experienced Riding Giants movie viewer.

In fact, after this film ended and I took a breath, I figured that the whole movie viewing experience was rather relaxing.

4368319,4,B004FGA2LM,"Going into this review I was a little apprehensive about
what I would experience.  After all, the initial 3D releases
I reviewed from IMAGE were pretty much hit and miss --
either being very good, or amongst the worst 3D I have
seen to date.  In this case, The Ultimate Wave Tahiti 3D
hits the mark in ranking within the very best of the Image
offerings.

As someone who is as totally unfamiliar with surfing, I
was delighted to find it to be the perfect subject matter
for an immersive 3D experience.  The Ultimate Wave Tahiti
joins 10-time ASP world surfing champion Kelly Slater
and Tahitian surfing legend Raimana Van Bastolaer as
they seek to ride the ultimate waves of Tahiti's famed
Teahupo'o.

For those that think this is just another surfing documentary,
think again.  The Ultimate Wave Tahiti takes us on a
wondrous journey across the island's volcanic paradise and
beneath the depths of the ocean where you'll explore the
stunning, fragile beauty of the reef's habitat.

If you have ever wondered what makes the perfect wave,
you'll come to learn that it's a combination of wind, tides
and distant storms.  You'll also discover that these ""demonic
waves"" are the heaviest in the world, giving its riders a
rush of facing death and surviving.  No doubt, these
dangerous waves of Teahupo'o continue to claim lives
yearly.

Beautifully photographed and expertly staged for 3D,
I found The Ultimate Wave Tahiti to be a highly enjoyable
watch.  The Imax cameras ride the waves alongside the
surfers from above and below the water surface, giving
the viewer the ultimate POV experience against the
beautiful backdrop of Tahiti with its lush, green volcanic
peaks all brought out in amazing 1080p clarity.

The footage taken below the ocean surface is very
tranquil and beautiful.  The cameras capture various
life within the coral reef including fish, sting ray, sharks
and whales.  These images are breathtaking, rivaling
those presented in Warner's Deep Sea and Under The
Sea 3D presentations.

The overall 3D quality is top-notch.  There is a
tremendous sense of separation.  Clarity is at its
fullest here with images that remain consistently
stunning throughout -- including footage shot
underwater.  Colors are vivid and true to form.

Is there ""In Yo' Face"" moments to be had here?
You bet! Surfboards, body parts and coral reef
are just some of the things that poke out from
the screen.  And, because this documentary
was specifically staged for 3D you'll find footage
cleverly filmed behind branches and flowers that
provide an amazing sense of depth foreground
to back.

Saw only seconds of ghosting in what would be
a scene where it would be expected.  In this case,
a campfire dance by night were small traces of
double imaging could be found in tree branches
above.  If you blinked, you missed it.

The film's soundtrack may not be the punchiest
I have ever heard but truly, it's an immersive
experience all its own.  There's defined audio
separation across all the channels and the
surrounds add ample support to water activity (from
above and below) that make you feel as if you
are in the middle of all the action.

CONCLUSION

As you can plainly see, I have nothing but raves
for The Ultimate Wave Tahiti 3D.  It ranks as one
of the better IMAX 3D documentaries available.
Additionally, it's now available for under $15 which,
in my opinion, falls into the acceptable range of what
a 45 minute 3D documentary should be priced at.

Certainly your decision on whether to purchase will
depend on your interest on the subject, but I was
rather surprised how much I enjoyed this IMAX
feature knowing nothing of the subject matter.",1453075200,2,3648,4.86709886547812

While even in 2D this is a great looking film, I was disappointed that this was billed as a video about an incredible surf break.  That being said, most of the movie was about the island of Tahiti, and had minimal video of monster waves being surfed.  I gave the video four stars, because as a 2D movie it looked awesome, and there was some surf footage.  The actual footage of the surfing is just like any other surf video about the spot (minus length of course).  I was hoping for some different POVs.

4368446,5,B004FGA2LM,"The Ultimate Wave Tahiti 3D follows pro surfer Kelly Slater as he travels to the island nation for their near mytho-like wave season. The film has more meat to it than I first expected and actually goes through the history of the island and goes to show some of the customs of the culture.
I found one scene in particular pretty amazing,which showed the dangers of the Tahiti waves by showing a layout of a church with surfboard tombstones. That in a nut shell shows how serious these people take their surfing.
The 3D is exceptional. I had to rewind one scene several times because I actually thought water flicked up in my eye from a wave. I was perplexed by this strange phenomenon and came to the conclusion that my (left) eye must have thought water was really splashing in it and a nerve must have twitched or reacted to the fake projectile. Pretty amazing if you ask me.

Pros: Amazing landscape. Awesome 3D.
Cons: I thought it was just a tad too short.

Bottom line: If you own a 3D TV I would venture to say this film is a must have.",1357430400,,1042,4.365979381443299

In fact most movies are not shot on this type of film so they don't look as great. Which is why people expect too much from 3d often , but not with this one, the film and scenery makes for a excellent 3d feature. Even in 2d the message is clear that tahitti is one of the last places where man hasn't destroyed the reefs. It's primeval and beautiful. The surfing aspect is good too, with incredible surfing scenes from waves that have far too often killed people. The music on here is great surf rock too and that just adds to the enjoyment , you even get some science about how the islands and waves are formed. This is educational too and the idiots out there whose brains are fried and don't liek nature or travel films should look elsewhere.

When we watched it for the first time, the I thought it had some of the most realistic under water scenes I have every scene.

I have an active shutter system that does justice to all the vibrant colors and the images in this movie simply perfect. There was almost no ghosting except for a second or so.

4368497,3,B004FGA2LM,"Pretty good movie to feel immersed in the action. It's good for a short (45min) experience in detailed 3D. It's not really focused on Kelly's best surfing since it's more of a documentary style filming. It has a few quirky moments where somebody decided to try to ""take advantage"" of the 3D kitsch and made some silly animations that didn't really add to the film, in my opinion and it has some rather striking scenic shots as well... but my girlfriend and I were both finding ourselves asking when they would just get to the surfing finally. Nevertheless, it's a good flick I can wow my surfing aficionados with on my 3D set and not take 2.5 hours of their time to do it. It's worth what I paid for it.",1326758400,,703,4.374045801526718

Expect to see more than just surfers doing their thing. The disc shows us everything from an involved fire dance (wicked) to lush Tahitian environs (both above and under the water).

All was crisp and vibrant, with some really amazing scenes that helped demonstrate the possibilities of the technology.

Particularly cool bits: dancing girls (and fire flinging dudes... if that's your thing), colorful turtles, a beastly barracuda, spectacular sea ray shot, and scintillating surf action.

All of these scenes are AWESOME, and definitely worth the price of admission (the cost of ONE 3D movie theatre ticket where I'm from). You won't be dissapointed....unless your TV stinks",1325635200,,742,5.262711864406779

There are a handful of 3D films available there including ""Safari 3D"" and ""Mummies 3D"".  This was an overall enjoyable film with some less than exciting narrated parts, but my favorite parts were the underwater scenes of fish swimming in the coral reefs. This is where 3D is a must.  You virtually swim through schools of fish and come face to face with sharks, barracudas and stingrays. My daughter and I were in awe.  I felt like I was snorkeling through the coral reefs - what an amazing experience to be able to relive some of the most memorable times in my life! I am going to add to our collection of 3D movies with underwater filming because I was so moved by the beauty of these scenes.  The visuals of Tahiti and the surfers in the waves are also exciting.

The story and the narration are really bad. There is no story line to keep you watching. You don't see much of Tahiti. Even when you think you will be watching great surfing scenes, those were disappointingly short and the angles don't give you any awesome feeling.

Kind of a travel video with little or no plot, but with good (not great) 3D. It is cheap enough so it does give you a quick and cheap idea on what 3D should look like, but don't expect a mega-million dollar video/movie production. The water/waves spilling out of the screen ""can"" really be cool, but it was overdone too many times for me. Would I buy this again after viewing it... probably yes. I have shown it several times to friends who are visiting as a quick example of what 3D can do, but I doubt if I will ever personally watch it a second time.",1319587200,,795,4.2368421052631575
4368516,3,B004FGA2LM,"I'll start off by saying that of the ~20 3D Blu-Rays I have, this one has some of the best, and some of the worst (in terms of distracting/headache inducing) that I've noticed.

The ""movie"" (documentary) clocks in at 45 minutes from intro to end credits. At first I thought this short runtime would be a bad thing, but while watching it (and I hate to say it), I found a lot to be somewhat boring. The title itself is very misleading - there's very little surfing in it, and of that, most is not impressive (or at an angle where you can't see what's going on). When the movie starts off by talking about ""The most dangerous wave on earth... The demonic wave,"" ""The greatest surfer ever,"" and ""The waves expected to get big and gnarly,"" it's a bit of a letdown when you really don't see anything like that in the film. It's a real mixed bag, with a small part focusing on the surfing and the rest focusing on Tahiti scenery (some facts-via-CGI images, some ""festival"" shots, some nice landscapes and some people just hanging out). If you're expecting surfing or seeing much of Kelly Slater, you'll be disappointed.

Most of the surfing/kayaking/rafting shots are shot with a camera mounted to the front of the board (or kayak) facing the surfer - this lets you see them balancing on the board and waves crashing.. but no idea of what's going on in front of them. This works for 3D, but at the same point you kind of want to see what's happening (more than ONLY people rowing or balancing). There are some far-away shots of surfing at times (mostly towards the end), but it's just not very impressive.

Most impressive of the shots are some of the landscapes.. but the 3D on them is lacking (almost seeming very 2D like, with very little depth). In fact, it seems like 2/3rds of landscape shots feature a beautiful landscape with a tree branch right in front of the camera to show SOME 3D. You basically get a postcard image, with a bush/tree in the foreground, right in your face. This happens SO MUCH that it becomes somewhat funny and predictable.

Overall, I just found the documentary to be somewhat boring. No connection to the people, a few interesting shots, but overall very forgettable.

But the reason you buy this is for the 3D - how is that? Well, it's some of the best (and the worst) I've seen in a Blu-Ray 3D format.

Most of the shots look very good - including some underwater shots and some of the ""mounted on the board"" shots. The CGI, however, looks the best and is very in-your-face. In fact, it's got  pop-out moments constantly. So for that.. great!

The problem comes with the multiple camera to produce the 3D effect. So many times, one camera will get splashed with water while the other is dry (giving an odd effect), or one camera will have lens-flare while the other doesn't. Or underwater objects will appear in one camera and not the other. It just comes off as somewhat headache inducing as it happens so frequently.

The first time I watched this, I fell asleep during it. The 2nd time, I made it through it but realized I wasn't missing much.

There definitely are some cool parts to it (mostly the CGI shots), and it's a good demo disc for 3D, for those scenes. Just don't expect much from the documentary itself. I wanted to love it, but ultimate I was somewhat let down by it. For the 10-bucks I paid, I'd say it was worth it for the ""GOOD"" 3D shots, but it's not something I'd watch in full again.",1317945600,,3434,4.4625199362041466

I recommend: watch this movie while drinking a Mai Thai.  Then go outside (somewhere preferably sunny).  Put on some shades and listen to some ocean noise on your ipod.  If you still don't feel like you are in Tahiti, just repeat the process (movie, mai thai, sun with ocean music) until you are somewhat convinced.

One of my favorite characters in this film is the little guy, appears to be about 7 years old, learning to surf and also has fun in the water with the local surf instructor. He's a real scream to watch. I am not in the least bit into surfing but this movie is  treat to watch again and again.

4368532,5,B004FGA2LM,"Wow, all that is needed to be said. But I shall say more. Simply breath taking 3D and at some parts I found myself ducking out of the way of the oncoming surf board I kid you not. Maybe I should not have been sitting so close to the big screen.

All kidding aside the views are breathtaking. The underwater shots were amazing. There were however some scenes where people were sitting so close to the screen that when trying to look at the background it made my eyes crossed some what. It could have been the weird multicolored surf board directly behind them in the distance that caused the most strain. It has to be one of the better things I seen in 3D yet, and for less than 12 dollars is hard to beat. There was a point where my friends 6 year old was trying to catch the fish that seemed to be floating just out of his arm reach. The detail was so apparent for the canoe scenes where you can visualize the depths of the canoe and the man rowing it. After watching this, if i could pack up and visit Tahiti tomorrow I would. I simply had no idea of the beauty. There was way to much eye candy to remain focused at just any one thing on the screen making this 3D movie worthy of watching a few times because it is impossible to catch all the detail in just one sitting.",1308355200,,1272,4.108433734939759
4368533,3,B004FGA2LM,"Not much to say, the whole film is about surfing and how waves created.

Pros: Only 1 scene where waves crash and water splash into the screen I though it got on my glasses. Beside that the whole film look very sharp as color and sharpness.

4368534,4,B004FGA2LM,"Like most short IMAX movies, this one is a demonstration of 3D technology combined with some educational content. It is not only about surfing and surfers. Rather, it is a sequence of beautiful visuals mixed with short stories about Tahiti and its underwater world, with a snapshot of geological history of Tahiti, it tells you how such huge waves are formed and why it may be so risky to surf them, and finally shows you amazing video footage of surfing, taken from a surfing board, from underwater, and right from the water surface between the waves. Those who shot this movie must have been quite daring to shoot this film as it was shot!  It does not have a consistent plot, but it offers 40 mins of relaxation. This is a kind of movie which has to be watched in 3D and not in 2D. It works nicely to show 3D to someone who has not seen it, but it is not too likely that you will watch it more than once - unless you are dreaming of surfing in Tahiti, of course....",1307664000,,968,4.2896174863387975

The 3D just sucks you in to the colors, power and majesty that is experienced by the brave few that venture out in these ""monsters"". The clarity and stellar 3D photography of the ""docudrama"" shows you things in such a way that just wasn't possible in the home before. I use Samsung 3D equipment. This 3D documentary had no artifacts I found annoying. The sound was great... the picture stellar. If you have had any thoughts of purchasing 3D equipment for playback on your home, now might be the time. The selection and quality of 3D titles is increasing. Come join us in seeing these 3D titles without the hassle of standing in line etc. The reproduction in the home is as good or better than the theater experience.

This is 3D done right.
Everything just pops right out at you.
Amazing.
A cute and touching story that is perfect for adults and kids alike.
The music, direction, pretty much everything is done well.
Probably the best 3D movie I've seen so far.
A must have for 3D owners, I'd also recommend it to 2D Blu Ray owners.

There are about 15 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and another 12 around 25% and 1 graphic makes it to 35% BUT, nothing special in the 3D department. Only 5 minutes of underwater fish scenes deserve a 3D applause.

***  Nice scenery and under water footage  ***

MY 3D RATING = GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

There was nothing spectacular about this is was merely a short view to pass the time. I guess it depends all what you like and as I said the scenery was great....rich colors & the 3D is ok.

As for myself I found the ""Dinosaurs: Giants of Patagonia"" more entertaining also the ""7 Wonders of the Solar System"" was a good watch. As far as the best Imax I have seen it is ""Under the Sea"" narrated by Jim Carrey.

  If you can pick this up for about 5 to 10 bucks it is an ok purchase and yes that is what the price will be after a while. As for myself I watch all my 3D on a Mitsubishi Diamond 73 inch with a Samsung C-7900 3D blu-Ray player. So my equipment is not subpar.

  I have maybe 15 to 20 3D titles and this along with ""Space Staion"" narrated by Tom Cruise are among the lowest when it comes to replay value.

  Among those that I like beside the 3 I have already listed.. I would say Coraline - Despicable Me - Tangled & Resident Evil was pretty good as well when it comes to 3D.

  It is all a matter of taste and I can not tell you that you will or will not like it. What I can tell you is that for my taste it was just so-so.",1302739200,7,1263,3.8115384615384613

4368548,5,B004FGA2LM,"What a great film.  It really shows the beauty of both the islands and 3d technology.  Some of the most spectacular 3d I've seen yet, had to wipe the water from my eyes a few times.  It really has a nice diverse selection of eye candy, from fire dancing to scuba diving on a reef to surfing, all fit nicely into the 3d format.  The scientific part of the movie is also entertaining and informative, explaining the mechanics behind waves and how they form.  If you are expecting a movie full of surfing and primarily focusing on that then don't watch this.  It was partially put out by Tahiti's tourism industry, so it shows you many different things you can do in Tahiti.  However it is done beautifully and really pulls you into the movie.  It made me ready to hop on the next flight out to Tahiti and rent a bungalow over the water.  And what's more for $15 and some of the BEST 3d I've seen I would say this is a must have 3d blu ray for anyone with a player.",1302480000,,962,4.184782608695652

I especially liked the underwater filming where the 3D looks GREAT!  This disk won't disappoint and is money well spent as versus so many of Hollywood's overpriced discs.  Production values are quality and it's very interesting.  I had to check the carpet in front of the TV to make sure it wasn't wet with fish a flopping the action is so real.  If you get seasick take your pill before watching this.  The extras not done by Stephen Low were ho-hum, but the disk has does have some previews of upcoming 3D productions.

Okay (so-so), educational, some oomph, but where is the ultimate wave? Was a waste of Kelly Slater (world champion surfer?) as you would have expected the producers/directors to capture something dramatic/sensational. I have seen far better wave tunnel surfing on TV and in the movies, but certainly not here. Not much of Tahiti is captured, kinda gives a feeling of being a deserted place of untold beauty.

Also perhaps the introduction of the film and the actions of splashed waves could had been more dramatic in its 3D effects too. At least you can sit back and enjoy the other great 3D effects of the ocean, surfboarders & the two sexy sheilas.

8427805,5,B004FGA2LM,"First and foremost I do not give any spoilers in my review, what I do offer is a short review of the quality of the film and the Watch-ability.

  What a visual treat to behold! This movie / IMAX film was simply incredible. The camera system used was an IMAX 3D setup and you can obviously see that this was filmed using this awesome 3D technology. I have a vast 3D collection and consider myself to be a 3D nut aficionado, and have had the pleasure of viewing a TON of 3D content. Because of this, I can give you an honest and educated review of the latest avaiable 3D content.

  Please keep in mind that not all 3D TV's are made the same, and some do a much better job at displaying 3D than others. Luckily I have an amazing 65"" 3D setup that displays 3D as it was meant to be seen. So when a 3D film is 'redone' or 'converted' it is fairly easy to recognize It is so easy to see that this was not a 'redone; or 'converted' film. Because it was filmed entirely in IMAX 3D, the 3D aspect really shines through, and does so with some of the best 3D shots/scenes I have 'ever' seen in 3D, and again, I have seen A LOT.

  Sometimes the 3D depth in this film is just breathtaking, it will really bring Tahiti right into your living room.. For example, right away in some of the very first scenes of the film, it almost seems as if water is pouring right out of your TV. There are also a few absolutely in your face 3D moments that will have you reaching for a towel as you will swear you were just drenched by that last wave.

  Yes it really is that great. I especially liked some of the underwater scenes which made me feel as if schools of fish are swimming right there in my living room,  and not to mention the close up 3D shots of  the sharks coming right at the camera!! Finding a film done this well only comes around every now and then.

I could keep going but don't want to spoil it for you, So I suggest that if you are at all thinking of buying this.
 Then may I suggest that you JUST DO IT. I promise you won't regret it, and your whole family will thank you.",1492128000,3,2071,4.051597051597051
