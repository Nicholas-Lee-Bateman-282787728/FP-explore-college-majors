5146024,5,B008B918A8,"Easily one of the best ""post apocalyptic"" films I've seen. Those bitching about inconsistencies and unbelievable parts obviously didn't watch until the end, because everything is revealed and tied together in the last sequence.

This movie is not ""slow"" as many say, but takes its time to carefully develop the story. My attention was held through every scene, in no small part because of the excellent cinematography and subtle use of music to strike just the right tone.

My only complaint was the performance of the main character's fiance, which was rather wooden and flat. But, thankfully, he was in very few scenes. On the other hand, Nicole Kruex delivered a perfect performance and her traveling companion was pretty good for a child actor.

If you want a gory slasher with lots of explosions and shooting (and there's nothing wrong with that!) then there are plenty of other places to turn. If you instead want an artfully developed and compelling human drama about loss and regret with a backdrop of zombies, this is the one for you.",1404864000,,1043,4.88135593220339

then as I watched on the pieces didn't make sense...
Then at the end I was like Whoa!
Wow what a movie... IT was AWESOME!
The movie had me confused, but once I saw the end, it all came together and everything made sense.

5146028,1,B008B918A8,"I really don't mind introspective post apocalyptic movies if done well. However the character usually needs to be somewhat more than insipid to begin with. Sure the lead character is easy on the eyes, has great post-apoc fashion sense, and a quaint if annoying accent, but it isn't enough to get past the over acting and poorly written character.

I couldn't sit through more than 30 mins. I gave it an honest try, but come on. The audio tracks clipped constantly, cut to harsh silence often (where the completely cut the nat. sound tracks), and a lot of visual ques made no sense at all. Case in point; the barn/garage scene. She raises the butt of the shotgun to hit the infected (no idea where it came from or why it was just chilling out on the floor) and then we hear (a very cheap and WAY too loud) gunshot. I mean seriously! All they had to do was have her strike at the infected and start to turn the gun around and it would have made sense. I also love when the pack magically goes from the top level of the barn to the ground floor ...and they are all killed by being gently pushed to the ground. Obviously they could have had a million dollar budget and they would have still turned out garbage because post staff was very lacking.

5146035,2,B008B918A8,It had a level of interest but the story line was too confined to the characters and didn't develop much of what was going on around them. As a result it was a bit confusing and too symbolic.,1394582400,,191,4.052631578947368

5146042,2,B008B918A8,"Ahhhhh.... no, not even close. Apparently the actress has a bunch of friends writing reviews, considering the pointless name dropping that takes place in the 5 star reviews here on Amazon...lol seriously, how does everybody else rate it one- two stars and it gets 6, five star reviews all mentioning the lead actress by name?... Oh, and comparing her and this movie to, Charlton freaking Heston in ""Omega man"" is about as ridiculous as you can possibly ever get...
Anyway,
The cover; decently done and is what actually got me to watch this dreck.
The lead actress; Cute and her costume was ok... I will not be remembering her at any point, and refuse to mention her name as it may actually help her in a search engine result...lol
Good premise, but it gets way deluded, the freaking constant cut away scenes are absolutely frustrating and super pointless and super long...Hint, I watch apocalypse movies to see what the characters will do in the apocalypse... not so much for watching what there life was like with there retarded boyfriends before TSHTF...
Oh, heres a big one... Her best Idea in the movie is to go back to GROUND FREAKING ZERO, in New York to find survivors! REALLY?! SMH>>>
Then of course theres the fight with 10 infected, ravenous, slavering, zombie dudes that literally have her pinned to the ground and are about to feast on her brains and she simply just gets up.... thats it... just stands right up and all the zombie dudes but one simply die right on the spot and she shoots him off camera....WTF???? Worst zombie kill ever! Apparently the world found out too late that all that was needed was 4 seconds of playing dead when a zombie horde attacked, and to spring up at the last minute would drop them on the spot....UGHHHHH..
The boy is a pointless plot dragger.
OK, I've beaten this one pretty bad... Honestly, it's not the worst apocalypse flick I've ever seen, seriously. thus my super generous 2 star rating... the her remembering her past life and stupid prose when she gets into those segments are literally intolerable, and the fight scenes could definitely have been a whole lot better. but its watchable, albeit for the sections of snore that you'll have to FF through.",1390435200,,2205,4.715025906735751

5146046,3,B008B918A8,"The first time I saw this, I was doing stuff online, and periodically watching this film as white noise in the background. However, the ending sorta peaked my interest, and I did some research. The budget was only $13,000 dollars. So I re-watched the last half of the movie again and gave it my full attention. Overall, it was not that bad of a movie FROM A STORY LINE PERSPECTIVE. Does this film have some faults...YES. As some other reviewers have stated, someone dropped the ball when trying to depict the world after it had collapsed. The one that stuck out most was ""her difficulty in finding food"" or something along those lines during one of her narrations. What she couldn't find a can opener??? And none of the countless abandoned homes or stores shown (with full stock) had edible food? I could probably write about a dozen more problems with this aspect of the film, but you get the point. As for acting, Nicole Kruex does have talent, but they should have explained her accent a little bit more, like she moved to the US in her late teens or very early 20s etc, instead of when she was 10 I think. Seriously, in the beginning of this film, I thought it was taking place in England. ***SPOILER*** ***SPOILER*** ***SPOILER*** The ending is open to interpretation, but seriously its not that confusing; if you paid attention to the last 20 minutes of the movie. In a nutshell, she was married and had a son. Her husband comes home infected and he is obviously violent-psychotic, she kills him (and were lead to believe she kills her son, because he's infected now-presumably by Dad attacking them, but they don't fully show this happening. So this woman has a total mental breakdown (or selective amnesia); wanders around and has encounters with figments of her imagination (i.e store clerk, movie patron, Jake especially), whom are concoctions of her own brain trying to get her back to reality . And in the final scene, you see her laying on a floor, where I took it as she was infected from her husband as well during the attack, and before she transformed into a zombie(28 days later types), the events of the entire movie played through her head (a quasi Jacobs Ladder movie type of thing). That was my interpretation, since the last scene moves from her being out in the roadway in some town being confronted by imaginary Jake (AND after realizing what had happened to her), we see her on a floor with that kinda infected look.

Its an OK movie for a cold rainy day, especially if you really having nothing better to do...it is better if you understand the deeper dynamics they tried to convey, but with a $13,000 dollar budget...it really fails to accomplish this...I gave it 3 stars, because according to Amazon grading, 3 stars means OK..

I tried to watch this film all the way through but the lack of lighting, horrible story line and the slower than crude oil development are just some of the highlights.  The narration starts out with A 10 year old girl from Ireland just moves to the US by herself where she supposedly grows up but still has an English accent and speaks in only English reference nothing American in her at all.  Just the flaw in describing the main character as she walks around endlessly telling her story to you.  It is one of those movies you watch when you have the flu and can't think anyways.  I read all 3 of the 5 star comments, it looks like they were written by the cast and crew of the film.  It is just too slow for me.",1382054400,2,756,4.115646258503402

Obivously low budget which wouldn't be a problem if this movie made up for it with the acting/ storyline. Unfortunately no. At some point when casting or making final edits with the script I would imagine that someone working on this project would have taken a step back and asked ""does this make sense? Does this fit with the storyline? How do I want the actors to make this believable?"" ect.

It isn't due to low budget issues mind you but due to disjointed nonsensical events and narration.  When the movie starts we get the impression that some calamity has happened and it's post apocalypse America at it's worst.  Just infected and very few survivors.  OK, so far so cool.  But then our protagonist states during her narration, ""there is very little food..."" What??!!  Do the infected eat canned food and fruit and stuff too?  If they do, the non-infected don't have to worry about getting attacked, right?  So, no people and infected running around, but the canned food has disappeared or something?  OK, then at 24 minutes or so we get our first true sighting of the ""zombies"" when they attack out protagonist who is in a barn(?) looking for supplies (food?) I guess.  When the infected attack, she backs out the door pointing a double barrel shotgun at 8 or 9 zacks moving toward her.  When she fails to, or can't fire the shotgun, the infected slap it out of her hands and proceed to bring her down and claw, scratch and try to bite her.  Miraculously, she is able to push off the infected guy on her (who prolly weighs 200lbs), stand up and then...well that was where I had the problem.  The infected didn't attempt to get up after her, they all just laid there reaching for her and snarling until she kicked one in the head and he collapsed and the rest just didn't move or something, I don't know, it was very confusing!  Then after this 'brutal' encounter she says ""it's like this all the time"".  Pft!!  You should be so lucky to have infected just fall over when you slap them!

5146066,5,B008B918A8,"I've spent more than my share of money on movies (seriously, I own over 1000!), and recently I've begun picking up some indie films.  Most, to be honest, suck.  I find myself wondering how the filmmaker(s) ever got the financing for their horrible films.  In some cases, their budgets exceed that of some famous Hollywood films.

After the Dawn is not one of those films.

In a world where everyone with a camera thinks they can make a movie, the filmmaker's of After the Dawn shine through like warm sunshine on a cold winter day.  The duo of Nicole Kruex and Mitchel Jones breath fresh life into the often overdone and boring typical zombie/infected/apocalypse movie.  Listening to the film's commentary, you can hear them laugh about the trials and tribulations they had to go through to make this seriously micro budget film.  But don't let the budget fool you, this film looks and FEELS very big budget, with one particular shot that would have even made the great Alfred Hitchcock proud.

The film never lags, has a brilliant twist that is so cleverly done that some people might not even get it on their first viewing.  Luckily this film warrants far more than a single watch.

Nicole Kruex is a Hollywood star still trapped in the world of indie films, but don't expect that to be for long.  She masterfully guides us through the nightmare of a world that she inhabits, both by her narration and through her wonderful acting that proves that even indie film actor's can play subtlety with grace.

Mitchel Jones, who is wearing so many hats on this film it's crazy (cinematographer, boom operator, director and even a pair of legs!), knows when to keep the camera moving and when to let the scene breathe, something that too many indie filmmaker's don't do (aren't we all a little sick of shakey cam??).

5146069,3,B008B918A8,"First - not bad, acting was good, script was well thought out and film quality was okay, but by the end, I was ready for it to be over and doubt I will re-watch it.  Really needed a lot more action puncutation and some more energy - my regret, is that if you look at the ""infected"" make ups in the special features - hey - there was some really GOOD make ups done, but we barely get to see it in action - with the care in the make up that was evident (in special features), this could have been so much more of an exciting and re-play value film....or as Moses would have said....""Let my Zombies, go!""",1357689600,6,601,4.050420168067227
5146070,2,B008B918A8,"the lead actress is quite good in this one. She carries the movie quite well. the main problem here is the microbduget. A bugdet of a camera and little else. the character goes around a world where stores still are full of product and have lights on etc. Some scenes where the infected chase her are good but others make no sense. FOr instance six of them jump on her , she manages to defeat them off camera?. They did the best they could with abdolutely no money though. It's similiar to videofilm of the 80's, where some folks decided to make a movie with no money or experience. In spite of that , the lead actress is quite good, perhaps she had lessons? The boy is good too. But the budget makes this one for fans of microbudget or made by first timers with a camera fans only. I love bad movies though, I give lots of 3 star ratings for movies that most people would rate as one star , but this one was just beyond low budget that it's hard to say two stars wasn't generous.  the sets here are  outside shots mainly , they couldn't find any good areas that look overgrown, so they just filmed deserted streets. To be fair , they probably had a few thousand dollars if that to make this. So you have to give them some credit for writing etc.",1356134400,2,1245,4.205020920502092
5146071,5,B008B918A8,"Nicole Kruex and Mitchel A. Jones first wrote a great story and then turned that story in to a great visual experience.  AFTER THE DAWN is beautifully shot and competes on all levels, from sound design to editing to cinematography,  with films of much larger budgets.  The story captivates the viewer and the role of Cassie is believably acted out in every scene with perfection by Nicole Kruex.  The supporting cast was well casted by the team to pull the entire film together with very believable characters.

One of the best ""post apocalyptic"" stories available on DVD today.",1351555200,4,578,4.857142857142857
5146072,5,B008B918A8,"This movie is more a work of art!  From the excellent camera work to superb acting. Director Mitchel A. Jones showcases true talents as well as does the beautiful and talented Nicole Kruex. If you are looking for a stereotypical apocalypse film, well sorry this may not be for you. Though if you are looking for a riveting film that makes you think, with a very unique plot twist I highly suggest ""After The Dawn"".

In my opinion it is more of along the lines of something Alfred Hitchcock or George A. Romero would have done, with pride. I look forward to more films from this duo. It truly is a shame that mainstream Hollywood is not taking lessons from independent films makers such as this instead of doing remakes of remakes which are lack luster to begin with.

Kudos to the movie. In short a great film, billed as horror it really is so much more!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/After-the-Dawn/dp/B008B918A8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">After the Dawn</a>",1351468800,4,998,5.148148148148148
5146073,4,B008B918A8,"This movie was awesome, no really,It has a sci-fi tinge with some truly horrifying moment .

We are huge fans of the classic BOY AND HIS DOG,And you can see alot of what they were trying to say in '75 and these filmmakers,If they had even heard of that film,Were too young to have even guessed there might be similarities.

Nicole Kruex is amazing and evelops her character to another level and makes the flashbacks aid her story and makes the ending,WELL as shocking as BOY AND HIS DOG shocker finis.

Congrats to all involved from Midnight Releasing to Nicole and her director Mitchel A. Jones.",1349049600,3,596,4.60377358490566
5146074,1,B008B918A8,"In a post-apocalyptic America, a young woman toting a firearm and accompanied by a mute boy goes in search of her brother. There's little action or suspense along the way, the use of voice-over narration becomes a bit grating, and the occasionally surreal touches create more muddle than interest. The cast and crew probably had great fun during filming but it all comes across as nothing more than a home-movie trying to palm itself off as a feature.",1348963200,7,451,4.794871794871795

I had a hard time following it. The ending was dubious at best. It was a waste of time for me. There were loads of unecessary scenes, IMO, like the Romero movie scene.......In the end the movie was low budget which is not bad but I could see car lights in reflections, zombiews smiling and acting stupid........",1517788800,,478,4.9875

8526562,2,B008B918A8,"I gave this movie 34 minutes and found it to be disappointing. The story was slow and plodding, made worse by the continuous narration and hand held camera work. The flashback scenes of life before the devastation did nothing to shape the main character or make her endearing. There were also failures of logic such as bowl of fresh fruit on a dining room table that somehow never rotted after (months ?) of time. And another scene of horses corralled behind a fence without access to food or water, yet somehow were still alive and healthy. Too bad. It could have been better.",1513296000,,577,4.611650485436893

Sure there are many technical problems with low budget films but the plot is worthy of some praise.  Similar plot speculation has been raised about The Walking Dead.
