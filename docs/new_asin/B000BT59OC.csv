8092084,4,B000BT59OC,A couple of the early scenes did not play.  My husband liked it anyway when we found our cheap old dvd player was the only one that could play this DVD.  He saw it on TV in Germany many years ago.  It is nice even though I don't speak German I've seen enough Treasure Island movies I know what they are talking about.,1430352000,,317,4.0
