5931422,5,B00EOMJB5A,"Good movie, huge history channel buff. Yet another DVD only easy to find on this site. Recombined to all my friends.",1385337600,4,116,4.571428571428571
5931433,5,B00EOMJB5A,"Great documentary, true to the facts as opposed to the much more famous movie (Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway) that had some major embellishments and inaccuracies.  Definitely worth checking out.",1432252800,,195,5.5
5931434,4,B00EOMJB5A,"I only gave this 4 stars because I wasn't aware at the time that the documentary that is on it is the same one that is on my Bonnie and Clyde (Warren Beaty & Faye Dunaway) blu-ray which wasn't the end of the world but the other documentary on it wasn't all that great, mainly just about the BAR. I was really hoping that since it was a ""brand new"" History Channel dvd that it would be NEW stuff or at the very least the REAL facts (they still had it in there that Bonnie shot the cop (cant remember his name off hand) point blank in the head) which really irritates me since the facts are there but then again i can't be too surprised with History Channel distorting facts since they put their label on the new Bonnie and Clyde movie and 90% of it was bulls***. But this review isn't about that movie.
Overall, this was a good documentary but outdated since there have been things that have been proven wrong and these falsities are still present in this.",1430870400,5,955,4.252747252747253
5931435,4,B00EOMJB5A,"This DVD has two programs about Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, the infamous crime couple. The first documentary is from the History Channel. They include actual footage from the 1934 ambush killing Bonnie and Clyde while ending their cross country crime spree. The History and A&E channels often produced first rate documentaries and this is no exception. Despite almost an hour length, the viewer meets Clyde's sister, Marie Barrow, in a candid interview along with historians and experts on the crime duo.

I didn't care for the second program entitled ""Man, Moment, Machine: Hunting Bonnie and Clyde."" The second program featured actors playing Bonnie and Clyde. To me, they did a satisfactory job not much else. The second program explained how the Ambush took place.

There were the only two programs on the DVD. There were no extra features.",1428796800,6,848,5.093525179856115

5931439,3,B00EOMJB5A,"This was a good DVD. There were a few inaccuracies in one of the stories. I really liked learning about the BARS. They video showed excellent drawings and videos of how these guns worked, and why Clyde was able to out-gun police. I never knew the BAR was that powerful just by reading about the gun. It was quality video, too. Only gave it 3 because the videos were not very long and some poor research in one. Also interviews of authors in both added to story.",1420502400,,461,4.310344827586207

5931460,1,B00EOMJB5A,"I'm certainly no expert on the history of Bonnie and Clyde, but considering all the facile generalizing and slanted personal opinions, uh I mean ""facts"", that dominate, I doubt anyone is going to get ""the real story"" on the reprehensible couple here. By all means, please do skip Bonnie & Clyde: The Real Story.",1393459200,,311,4.777777777777778
5931461,5,B00EOMJB5A,"Great, historically acurate documentary of the infamous 1930's couple running amuck across the states most affected by the great depression of America.",1391817600,2,151,5.909090909090909
5931462,5,B00EOMJB5A,"""Bonnie & Clyde: Real Story"" gives the viewer a better look and insight into two of America's most interesting gangsters. While their crimes are not glamorized, this documentary gives the viewer real insight into their unusual story and why after decades people are still fascinated.  Bonnie Parker was a young waitress when she met Clyde Barrows already with a record and a penchant for robbery.  I don't believe they knew at the time, their eventual historical notoriety.  In many ways they were a product of their time. The 1930's was a period of great economic strife for many, but hardship was already embedded in Clyde Barrow's young life.  Clyde started stealing at an early age and his record had police monitoring him even when he tried working legitimately. Ironically, In some ways the constant presence of the police might have helped Clyde steer into criminal behavior. According to the biography, Clyde couldn't hold jobs for long with the police coming around to question him all the time.  This documentary offers compelling commentary from Marie Barrow (Clyde's sister) and excerpts from letters between Bonnie and Clyde and from Blanche Barrow's memoirs. The viewer gets a detailed glimpse of personal moments as well as harrowing events of their two year crime spree.  Bonnie  tried to get Clyde to ""go straight"" at the beginning of their relationship and her letters are quoted. But after Eastham prison, Clyde was visibly hardened and his crimes seemed to reflect that change. In a rush to escape one of their hideouts, Bonnie and Clyde left behind a camera with the now, famous poses of the young attractive couple. After photos made the newspapers, Bonnie and Clyde became popular and peaked public interest. However, too many mistakes and unfortunate associations and ""misfires"" that left a  trail of grisly murders, their life on the run led to a violent end. ""Bonnie and Clyde: Real Story"" is an excellent documentary!",1390003200,13,1944,5.053125
