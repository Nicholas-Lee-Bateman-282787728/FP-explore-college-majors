2068192,5,B00028G6M6,It is really an eye opener for western medicine into prevention and time proven wisdom...we have so much to learn from Indian culture!,1215302400,6,134,4.869565217391305
2068193,5,B00028G6M6,"I also enjoyed this DVD. It is set mostly in India with some footage from Western Doctors who also practice Ayurveda to do the studies in Greece. They really check all signs in patients like Chinese medicine. Most of the DVD had subtitles to help you when the accent was thick or when they didn't speak English to help. The shots of the landscape was beautiful & pulls you into going back to embrace it. The simplicity & less stress in the villages lifestyle was inspiring. Yes, indoor plumbing & washing of hands with natural soap is one of the great realizations of modern medicine, but not much else has help except in some ways for trauma.

In the DVD, a long time Indian Doctor even eats mercury before your eyes after using a mixture he makes to neutrilize it's toxicity so it doens't kill him. He says doctors ALWAYS tries their formulas on THEMSELVES, not animals or patients to make sure it works fast.

There are many testimonies from people who have been cured of cancer for 14 years & still going, 80% blindness from diabetes as been reduced to only moderate seeing dificulty like most people who just need glasses, etc. He was very charming with a great sense of humor. He says anything can be cured, he has studied western medicine to understand more, but cannot undrstand why western teach that the body cannot be healed.

Such that blindness which according to western medicine by a leak of blood in the tiny blood vessels in the retina is treated with lasers to plug to hole. But they never adddress the reason for the leak. It will just keep happening. Ayurveda & also Chinese medicine address WHY the blood vessels are weak in the first place & what foods to eat & not eat to strengthen them again.

I know a man in his 50s who has hypertention & on heart medications who still eats processed foods. He has blood spots in his feet. It is the cappilaries leaking blood in his feet from weakness. When he went on a diet, not reducing sugar or fats or meats, but just reducing artificial ingredients, the blood spots faded & disapeared. When he slipped again, they returned... so he has stayed off artificial so he never has to see them again. He also of course, report increase in energy, better sleeping, more positive outlook on life, better ability to concentrate & work, etc. All because the aritificial ingredients aren't there to stress his body out, taking what daily energy it can to keep the body from getting cancer or tumors or dying that day.

There's no such thing as an eye tick meaning nothing, every mole, every wrinkle, even little blood vessel you see as an imperfection is a sign your body is telling you that it is being stressed out by the foods you eat, your sleeping habits, alcohol you overconsume to be social, etc. No one listens in the west especially doctors until you are at death's door. Drugs only treat the outside symptoms, such as sneezing from a flu instead of the toxins itself or to increase your own body's ability to fight it off faster. Even OTC drugs for coughing has been proven in studies to not reduce the amount of coughing, parents said there was less, but was proven taht it was exactly the same. The same for antibotics for earaches, it does not speed healing at all studies have shown. What causes earaches is too rich a diet in deserts, dairy & processed foods most times.",1143504000,26,3339,4.539867109634551
2068194,5,B00028G6M6,I'm not going back to any traditional physician again after watching this dvd... It's really unfair that so many people is suffering and they don't know about this antique science that can heal almost anything in a natural way...,1140739200,18,229,4.897435897435898
2068195,5,B00028G6M6,"There is so much more to HEALING, than being treated by doctors who look at symptoms and who prescribe farmaceutical drugs that do more harm than good.
Being a rheumatic patient, and having used the most horrifying drugs for over 10 years(I was even given a chemocure for a year! LEDERTREXATE), I decided to QUIT, because there was NO improvement whatsoever, on the contrary. The doctors declared me totally irresponsible. I couldn't walk one step without 2 crutches and they predicted I would soon end up in a wheelchair. Well... after having started alternative medicine, like acupuncture,kinesiology EFT, immunics, PLUS vitamins, minerals, anti-oxidants, supplements and a grain-free-diet, 5 Tibetan Rites (Yoga), my condition has improved significantly. Less pain, inflammation reduction. Immune system has improved. I sometimes need 1 crutch. Most days I can even do without. Who said that natural healing is NOT possible.
This movie shows beautifully that alternative medicine is capable to heal serious and also chronic diseases, without chemical drugs with its burdening and harming side-effects or even an operation.
Allopathic medicine is too involved in curing symptoms and doctors are totally focused on the disease. We desperately need other and better ways of healing.
Don't hesitate to consult your M.D. when you're ill, but don't swallow everything they say or prescribe... Use your brain and intuition as well.",1135555200,30,1427,5.4324324324324325

8023854,5,B00028G6M6,I love this film. It inspired me to start studying ayurveda and I signed up for a course and got a certificate as an Ayurvedic Wellness Counselor. This movie is very interesting and inspiring. It takes you around India and shows you how different Guru's are practicing the ancient healing art of Ayurveda and other traditional medicines. The sound track is great as well. If you are at all interested in healing and ayurveda you can't miss this one!,1275436800,6,449,4.69620253164557
8023855,5,B00028G6M6,"I've been a fan of Ayurveda for a few years, read some books, and thought I had a fair idea about it. This film still blew my mind!! It goes beyond what most popular books will tell you, you see real tradition in different aspects, from city to the jungle. There are some truly amazing personalities of healers presented. You will see creation of advanced preparations, treatment of serious disease, and generally how this tradition is practiced where it was born shrouded in legend, and where it has accumulated its wisdom for thousands of years.",1257033600,10,547,4.768421052631579
8023856,5,B00028G6M6,"As a nurse, I often have taken notice that while my degree is in science, I feel that my profession is an artform.  This movie shows the art and science that is Ayurveda.

I knew little about it going in, but feel a lot more informed and am inspired to study it further.  My uncle had Acute Leukemia and was told he'd die in 6 months.  He went away to an Aryuvedic doctor, and was given medications to take and a diet to follow.  (I only remember carrot juice as being something he had to drink, every day.)  He went into total remission for many years.  When his disease came back, he sought out the same doctor, but found him dead of old age.  I mention this, because one of the really sad things about this movie is shows that the most experienced trusted doctors are rather old, and they believe that the study should be from guru to student.
I did not look to the movie for proof of the effectiveness of the treatments, but really just for an examination of the medicine as it is practiced, and of the culture that has sustained it.
It gets a tad bit long at the end, but it delivers.  It is an excellent introduction to this ancient system of medicine and care.
I also loved the numerous mention of the importance of being in touch with nature and her rhythms.  I think that pagans in particular would LOVE this movie, as it does delve into astrological medication, as well as gem therapy.",1241654400,12,1395,4.310344827586207
