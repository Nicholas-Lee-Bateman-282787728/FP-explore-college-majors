Since neither one of them can be killed the only way to achieve victory is to return to one body. If Hakuoro does this he must be sealed away to control his dark side. That would mean leaving Eruru behind. Just as they have discovered their true feelings or each other.

This anime got weirder as it progressed. It's kind of like a cross between Inuyasha and Record of Lodoss War. I really enjoyed it. It has a great story, great voice actors, a great soundtrack and great animation. As I said, toward the end it gets kinda strange. All of a sudden, mecha, high tech research labs and cloning are taking place in a feudal age world. It doesn't get too far out though. It's easy to follow at least. The drama and action are amazing. The only complaint I can really have is that Hakuoro and Eruru didn't realize each others feelings till the end. There was plenty of time to develop that, but they didn't. It did have a good ending though. Overall, this anime is excellent. I recommend Utawarerumono to any anime fan over the age of 10.",1354579200,,1210,4.401785714285714

Young children no go a few cuss words sprinkled here and there. Older kids parents choice. I thought the quality was well done, I also enjoyed songs. I would be interested if they made a movie to fill-in the futuristic scenes about Hukaro and the scientist.",1188950400,5,407,4.71830985915493
