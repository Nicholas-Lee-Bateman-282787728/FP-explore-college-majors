It was released in Japan from  Jan 1st 1963 until Dec 31th 1966  (4 years) with 193 episodes  in total in B/W films. In Japan the watching  rate was usually more than 30% and the highest marked astonishing 40.7 %.  In USA, the on air was discontinued by the claim of parental  movement  insisting the story contains strong brutal actions, so only early part of  the total episodes were available  outside of Japan. The original Tetsuwan  Atom was written in  the form of Manga (comic) on the monthly books started  from  1951. The author Tezuka Osam (Tezuka is the family name) was the best  manga writters in history and in his lifetime he wrote more than one  hundred fifty thousand pages of manga manuscripts (about more than 500  manga books) and directed  many animation films for commertial TVs and non  commertial experimentals. Outside of Japan, very small part of his huge  amount of work is known. Atom is just 1% of him.  The Atom series  contains many classical SF spirits and rich ideas. The design of the  machines and buildings are elegant decora style possibly Germanic. This  Atom series influenced many Japanese kid at that time to make many  engineers to have desire to make humanoid robots with intellect.  etc, etc,  Enjoy",966124800,12,1466,4.817813765182186

7841989,5,630323917X,"Astroboy, or ""Tetsuwan Atom""in Japanese original title (literaly Atom with iron arms) was the first TV animation series in Japan which started in 1963. I was a kindergarten kid then, and TV was still new to our family. TV was still monochrome then, still I could feel ""clolor"" of the scenery. It was my first encounter with Manga...  Tezuka Osamu, the Manga artist who created Astroboy is ""God of Manga"" in Japan. Tezuka was the founder of the present Japanese Manga and animations. When ""Lion King"" was released from Disney, many Japanese fans are furious that the animation is replica of Tezuka's ""Jungle Emperror/Kimba the White Lion.""  This Astroboy series is a story of boy-shaped robot who has human heart. Classics, but never loses its fascination.  END",886896000,6,760,4.968503937007874
