6354518,3,B00JC5ED7A,somehow documentary in nature. Lack a bit of character of a movie,1424390400,,65,4.5
6354519,5,B00JC5ED7A,"This was an incredible movie.  The fact that the character development was so strong was unexpected.  This got me interested in Kyokushin Karate...I've practiced over 10 different styles, but now focus on kung fu, TKD, hapkido, aikido and bagua zhang.
One of the main bad guys looks like the singer from Fine Young Cannibals.
DO NOT SKIP THIS MOVIE!",1422403200,2,349,4.898305084745763

6354524,5,B00JC5ED7A,"Martial Arts movie enthusiasts will love this historically inaccurate but well choreographed movie that superficially addresses the life of Mas Oyama. If you want an accurate biography of the karate innovator, do not watch this movie. However, if you like a good story with close to realistic martial arts, enjoy this yarn. One should consider this flick a terrific graphic novel brought to the screen. Nuff said.",1420156800,17,413,5.17910447761194
6354525,5,B00JC5ED7A,"THE BEST MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN

This is probably the best martial arts movie I have ever seen...bar none.  First of all the KOREAN FILM INDUSTRY is technically proficient and that excellence is reflected in this film...unlike the old BRUCE LEE /CHUCK NORRIS films which are at a  more elemental level of film making IMHO.

There is a lot of cultural conflict going on which an OCCIDENTAL can not fully understand ( reasons being  inability to understand the language spoken in the film,  probable lack of nuance in the subtitle translation, lack of focus on this historical aspect in our high schools & college curricula )  .  For instance, this film takes place in Japan right during and after the end of WWII.  It shows the racism KOREANS experienced at the hands of the JAPANESE.  Although  I can not fully understand all the nuances  this historical revelation is fascinating nonetheless.

This film is a biography( fictionalized according to WICK)  of MAS OYAMA a  real  live TAEKWANDO icon; and founder of the ubiquitous eponymously named  TAEKWANDO schools in the USA .  Practitioners of TAEKWANDO will get even more out of this film.  But, I loved it.  Having a background in TAI CHI this film resonated with me.  THE BOOK OF 5 RINGS by MIYAMOSO MUSASHI  is the protagonist's bible.  The protagonist goes into isolation in a harsh environment.  Without being a spoiler...you will love this part.  A series of martial arts challenges are  laid down.  You have to watch to find out what happens in these many challenges.  Finally,  I would be remiss if I failed to mention the love interest angle.  Yoko is a beautiful Japanese geisha.  Our hero plays the  chivalrous Sir Galahad.  Love sparks are kindled.  What is special about  love in this movie is the effect love has on a sentient being who is trying to walk the path of a warrior.  You will need to watch the film to see if 1 human can reconcile being an ultimate savage in a fight while reserving a part of himself  as the preserve of love and tenderness.

I owned this movie 5 years ago and loved it.  I played it over and over again.  My opinion has not changed.  This is one of the greatest martial arts films of all time; and very beautifully filmed.  This film  teems with historical relevance.  A must see for martial artists and anyone who likes a dramatic story which reveals the little told  history ( in the USA at least )  of Japanese racism towards Koreans.",1419984000,12,2447,4.625292740046838
6354526,5,B00JC5ED7A,"I ONLY WISH I COULD GIVE IT A 10 STAR RATING. NO SPOILERS, BUT IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS IS BASED ON AN ACTUAL PERSON'S LIFE, AND WHAT A LIFE IT WAS. GREAT ACTION SCENES AND THE PLOT CONTINUES TO MOVE THRU OUT. DON'T PASS THIS ONE UP. NO WIRE WORK, JUST GOOD OLD FASHIONED MARTIAL ARTS. GREAT FILM, WELL DONE.",1498953600,4,312,4.048387096774194

6354546,4,B00JC5ED7A,"This movie is about a Korean copy-cat martial artist following in the footsteps of Japan's Miyamoto Musashi in order to gain recognition and revenge in the WWII era. Action and story are good, but I'm seen this before in other Musashi movies, so there were no surprises. It was a typical ""hero survives"" tale. It was interesting to see the racial divide between Koreans living in Japan, and the director's stance on Americans at that time as well. Well worth the watch, even if it is slow going the first 5th of the film.",1476748800,,521,4.553191489361702

Certainly the script writers could have done some research and cited the Korean Hwarang warrior-philosopher Won Gwang Beop Sa, the buddhist monk who taught the youth of the Hwarang Taek Kyong, which is featured in the movie.

The film includes Several unbelievable scenes, as do most Kung Fu films.  This film, however, excels in philosophical explanation of Japanese and Korean views on martial arts.  The plot unfolds in some surprising ways.  The life purpose of the main character caught my attention.  Yet, I do not believe making one's aim to become the greatest fighter in the world even at the cost of losing one's loved ones and turning back on commitments is a worthy principle to follow.  Likely, some will not have an issue with the values in the film.  Some scenes are not suitable for kids.  Yes, I'm a parent.",1440720000,,735,4.862903225806452

Japanese arrogance toward other Asian races, American occupation of Japan after WWII etc. This all acts as a backdrop for the fights the main character ends up in. The fights are actually very realistic. You aren't going to dodge every hit, block everything, magically avoid being cut by a knife etc. In a real fight you'll get tossed around, get punched, hit, whacked with a stick, cut with a knife and this movie portrays that. What makes Mas Oyama's brand of Karate unique is that it focuses on real fighting. You take a hit and keep going until your opponent can no longer attack you.

6354759,5,B00JC5ED7A,"I liked that it was based on a real person.  I don't expect it to be the most accurate, but at least it was a good story line to follow.  The fight scenes were well choreographed and didn't seem to defy the laws of gravity.  Would have liked it if they had some information at the end credits to tell a little more about what he did with his life.",1425772800,,347,3.9285714285714284

This was and is a remarkably good movie... well directed... well produced... and the actors were more then just good. I will not even hint at anything that might be a spoiler, if this is the first review you are reading... stop right here and watch the movie, you will not be disappointed. This movie has everything you would want in it and was based on actual events. Read the book also.",1528416000,,553,4.226415094339623

Nice to see it again on Prime.

Wish action could be better. Hollywood should really remake this one.

Story is a bit drawn out.

But overall, like the story.",1501372800,,185,4.352941176470588
