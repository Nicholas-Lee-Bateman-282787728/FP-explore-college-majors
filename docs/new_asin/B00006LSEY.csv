7971913,4,B00006LSEY,"Not great but not bad sort of sci-fi thriller.  A group of scientists get kicked out of a deep cavern when the military find they can use the cavern for their own purposes.  Then the military commandeer the scientists when they realize they need them.  As you can see that is what stuck most in my mind.  The OBNOXIOUS military leaders.  Anyway this group of mismatched organizations find strange, dangerous animals and even more dangerous humanoids.  The cave people are not monsters but humans that have lived eons in the cave systems and evolved to live well in their environment but view any intruders murderously.  I have the VHS version which is not bad quality but I would like to see a US region DVD released very soon.",1423785600,,727,4.6328125

7971917,4,B00006LSEY,"I just finished watching this movie and I must admit I didn't have high hopes. However, this turned out to be a good movie. During a test of a low frequency transmitter, two men and the transmitter disappear. A team is dispatched to search the caves where the test took place - caves that have never before been explored. But what waits below they could never imagine.

This story turned out to be quite original, 20 years before THE DESCENT.  The script is far from perfect but it works, and the acting may be the best aspect of the movie. Violet Pretty makes the film that much better.  Oh - that's Anne Heywood, better known from the 1967 adaptation of D.H. Lawrence's THE FOX. It's hard to believe that anyone who was born with the name Violet Pretty would want to change it.

They did a pretty good job in creating the atmosphere and the mood, and there were some pretty chilling sequences.  When it comes to special effects, well, it is a B-movie from 1984, but I recommend this movie because of the story.",1182902400,9,1012,4.448648648648649
