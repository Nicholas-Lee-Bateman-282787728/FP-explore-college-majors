1943304,2,B0000TGAAU,"This film is disappointing relative to Piglet's Big Adventure or the Tigger Movie because it is difficult for the younger children (who are typically the most enamoured with these characters) to follow. The story is not linear - it requires understanding that the characters are remembering last Easter at certain times.  This caused confusion in for our daughter age 3. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, Rabbit's bitterness disturbed our daughter and required continual reassurance that he would be nice again.
The songs were nice, the animation fine. Since this film went right to DVD, I expected lower production values, but standards were well maintained. I think the film works well for older children, but was disappointed in it as a movie for our young kids, particularly since Pooh stories are movies that should be among the most accessible to the youngest audience.",1079481600,9,878,5.183098591549296
1943305,5,B0000TGAAU,"Very likely one of the best , if not the best, animated features that Disney has ever produced. This imaginative and funny film captures the essence of the Disney magic and conveys the triumph of empathy, forgiveneness, and steadfast friendship over bitterness, recrimination, and selfishnesss.  The story line, color, dialogue, and music are wonderful and captivating, even for us older guys who may be viewing it alone or with our grandchildren.",1079308800,2,447,5.295774647887324
1943306,1,B0000TGAAU,"My 3 year old loves Piglet's Big Movie and the character Roo, so I thought this would become an instant hit with him.  However, neither one of us could sit through it.  He was very upset that Rabbit was so angry for the majority of the movie and is too young to understand why.  Being a Disney film, of course it has a happy ending but it took too long to get to the themes of friendship and love that these Pooh movies are all about.  This movie just wasn't fun.",1079136000,36,463,4.054945054945055
1943307,4,B0000TGAAU,"Sometimes a narrator's got to do what a narrator's got to do-and in this happity-hoppity new Pooh cartoon, that means messing with Rabbit's tidy, organized mind. In homage to Charles Dicken's A Christmas Carol, the narrator shows Rabbit what the future will be like for him if he continues to deny little Roo and the other critters of the Hundred Acre Wood their Easter fun.
On Roo's second Easter, the whole gang is expecting an enjoyable, egg-hunting bash like they had last year, with Rabbit serving as their Easter Bunny host. What they don't remember from last year is how disappointed and frazzled Old Long Ears got when the gang wouldn't follow his Easter instructions with precision. The gang ended up having a grand time, but Rabbit secretly swore that he'd never play Easter Bunny again. And he meant it-until he ruins this year's Easter celebration AND the narrator convinces him that his friends will become so distraught over his denial of Easter that they all move away, leaving Rabbit bereft, draped in cobwebs and alone in the Hundred Acre Wood.
Sinister narrators aside, it's a wonderful lesson for children on how friendship has to be a two-way street, and how laughter can trump tidiness on any given day, especially holidays!
For those of you parents who have been swindled by Pooh movies in the past, rest assured, this one is actually a new feature, not a clumsy cut-and-paste job of old television cartoons. Not only that, the songs are the hummy, lively tunes we expect and crave from a Pooh cartoon, not the overprocessed glock that some recent Disney straight-to-video productions are trying to pass off as ""musical classics.""

1943322,4,B0000TGAAU,"Even though the title suggests that this is only about spring, the story instead involves Easter.  Some of the residents of the Hundred Acre Wood are prepared to celebrate Easter only to discover that Rabbit has canceled Easter without telling them, expecting them to clean his house as a substitute for hunting Easter eggs.  Rabbit no longer wants to be the Easter Bunny and expects everyone to forget the holiday to suit him and his sour mood.  Hed rather spend time in his garden talking to his carrotswhich he has named.  Somewhere along the way the plot strays and for lack of a point or an ending, they rush to use the plot of A Christmas Carol to turn Rabbit around.  For no reason at all, theyve also added a few forgettable songs.  At worse, its just another cute movie featuring cute characters.
David Ogden Stiers does a great job as The Narrator.",1504396800,,858,4.57516339869281

1943377,5,B0000TGAAU,"Just in time for Easter, here's a review of one of my all-time favorite Easter classics (aside from Rankin/Bass' Easter Bunny Trio), Winnie the Pooh: Springtime with Roo! Believe it or not, this was Disney's first Easter cartoon in 70 years, the only other one up 'till then was the 1934 Silly Symphony short Funny Little Bunnies, which was sadly never included with this movie on any format since 2004, when this originally debuted on VHS and DVD. That's what makes Springtime with Roo all the more remarkable, on top of being Pooh and his gang's very first Easter adventure in animation (they had Easter adventures in books before, but never in animation until this, and again in My Friends Tigger and Pooh's ""Easter Rabbit"" in 2009, and a Easter-y version of A Christmas Carol to boot! Leave it to Rabbit to make a mess of things at Easter with Spring Cleaning Day in its place, you'll just have to see why he made it that way, if you hadn't seen this before! And believe me, you and your little ones are sure to enjoy it! This was also one of just 2 home video-exclusive 2D Pooh movies to NOT reuse old footage, excepting the very beginning, which was reworked from The Tigger Movie in 2000 and again in Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie in 2005. The only other one that doesn't reuse old footage is Pooh's Grand Adventure from 1997, which STILL isn't on Blu-ray as of 2016, even with its 20th anniversary coming next year! The 2004 VHS and DVD had some great bonuses; like a sneak peek of Pooh's Heffalump Movie and 2 episodes of The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, as a sneak peek of what would be the Growing Up With Winnie the Pooh DVD collection! But sadly, the 2014 DVD had no bonuses, as the Blu-ray disc only has a dance-along music video as its only bonus feature. It's a shame the classic Pooh episodes never resurfaced in this 2014 DVD/Blu-ray release. At least every year at Easter, I look forward to this instant Easter classic, every year since it debuted in 2004, whether it's on VHS, DVD or Blu-ray! If you're a life-long Pooh fan like I am, I'm sure you might enjoy it that much yourselves! Happy Leap Day AND Easter, everyone! ""BBFN, Bye-Bye For Now!"", to quote Roo, imitating Tigger's famous bye-bye!",1456704000,,2225,4.551122194513716

He literally throws some of the characters (abuses them is more like it), he yells at them in their face, he throws numerous fits and throws objects. For the majority of the movie he is upset, cranky, anxious and frazzled. They took it to an extreme. Even my 3 year old realizes this and gets upset during the parts when Rabbit is on screen. It's really disappointing to see this, as I grew up on Winnie the Pooh and don't remember the show being this mean and stressful to watch.

1943438,1,B0000TGAAU,It pains me to have to give a Pooh movie 1 star but I did not like this one at all. First off its more abOut Rabbit than Roo. Secondly and mostly Rabbit is mean and nasty in this movie. Instead of being his normal cranky self he's down right hateful. I love Winnie the Pooh and how my 3 year old boys love and know all the characters but Rabbit's character not only makes you dislike him but fear him. I do wish the real reason had been included. I'm not big on movies that omit the true reason behind Christmas or  Easter but unfortunately I've come to expect that. I just wish they hadn't made Rabbit so nasty. I don't plan on letting my boys watch this one again. I don't want them to dislike Rabbit's character or think that's how one behaves when upset.

1943444,3,B0000TGAAU,"This one was a bit disappointing, in comparison to ""Piglet's Big Movie,"" and some of the other great Pooh flicks. Rabbit is so unkind, and selfish. He's his usual grumpy self, multiplied by ten! I suggest, if you want to buy this one, to wait until your child/ren are age four or older before permitting them to watch. It's easier to explain rabbit's unkind behavior to older children, and provides for a great opportunity to have a discussion about being kind and hurt feelings, after watching this movie. It does have a happy ending. I'm not too fond of Easter movies that aren't Christ-centered, but when you watch Disney movies, you can't expect to get anything that makes mention of God. That being said - I was prepared for the Easter bunny, and the imaginative story.

1943450,4,B0000TGAAU,"While practically every cartoon character ever created has, at one time or another, saved Christmas, there are precious few animated specials or direct-to-videos with a springtime, Easter or even an Easter Bunny.

This made-for-TV Disney animated feature is one of the few. It makes sense for spring to be a cherished part of life in the Hundred Acre Wood, with its rolling landscapes, shady trees and colorful flowers.

There is so much niceness among Pooh and his pals -- and this is a good thing in this age of ""edgy"" cynicism, even in children's entertainment -- we can still look to Eeyore for lovable, relatable gloom and to Rabbit for lovable, relatable angst and neuroses. In other words, they're for us adults in throws of life's drama.

David Ogden Stiers is a marvelous narrator, by the way. Very Sebastian Cabot.

Rabbit adopts a Scrooge-like role in this story, which features original songs and overall is a very attractive production. Only one extra feature is basically a song player -- I would have liked to see a few episodes from the Emmy-winning ""New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" series.",1395360000,,1109,4.882978723404255

I had to preorder this with the DVD separate because it is not a Blu-ray combo pack like the other disney blu-rays but came with a Digital HD code and that's an up. I got them for $24.00 (Just as much as the single Blu-ray would cost). And I also got a free Pooh mobile with it. THUMBS UP!!!!!!

Yet, my daughters and I always wanting more Pooh Bear, I piped the movie into one of my editing programs and quite expertly cut out Rabbit's poorer behavior and words, cut a couple of songs, and ended up with a very nice 30 minute cartoon that would fit with the old TV series.  It was an excellent way to salvage this work, and the only way my kids would tolerate it.  With my work, you can't tell it was ever edited.  (-;",1376784000,5,730,4.492424242424242

1943489,4,B0000TGAAU,"I think I first seen the trailer of this film is when I got the VHS of Piglet's Big Movie (which is wonderful for Piglet Fans). And in April 2004, I got the VHS of this from Ireland (which is a PAL VHS Cassette). Unfortunetly I'm not sure I would play the VHS again as the tape is getting almost interfiernces when it comes to old VHS Players. (in Ireland, But I live in UK and still have the TV with VHS Player stuck in together which works fine TBH)

Until just about months ago while I was browsing [...] DVD Reviews of a Region 1 DVD like This one. Which ONLY Difference from the Region 2 DVD is it has 2 Episodes from the nostalgic TV Series in the 1980's (TITLED: The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh)

1. Honey for a Bunny
2. Trap as Trap Can (To me, it has random plot and hilarious parts like Papa Heffalump (voiced by Jim Cummings, Also voiced Pooh and Tigger recently. But Papa is even more stout and round than Pooh is. (for obvious reasons...) :P) got covered in flour while on his search for Junior! (His Scrawny Heffalump Son)

And now the reason WHY I have got a Region 1 DVD of Springtime with Roo that is because of the two episodes weren't on the Region 2 DVD. Thats what difference.

In My Opinions about SWR that its a really good film that has adapted a Charles Dicken's famous Christmas Story. though the 2 Episodes on a R1 DVD were more welcome. :)

5/5!

This one isn't quite on par with those, but it's not nearly as bad as the Valentine DVD or the Growing Up with Pooh DVD's.  Those truly must make Walt Disney cringe in his grave.  My daughter has no interest in those, but she does ask for this Springtime DVD often.  Rabbit is quite cranky throughout most of it, but not so much as to scare my daughter.  In fact, she turned to me and said ""I like Rabbit!"".  She knows that's just how Rabbit is.  She's more excited about the fact that there's lots of Roo in this one.",1269216000,2,664,4.306451612903226

So I love it too!!!",1253059200,,314,4.25
1943493,4,B0000TGAAU,"I do not understand the criticisms of this little movie I've been reading here...  Simply put, Springtime With Roo is ""A Christmas Carol"", only Easter-style w. Pooh characters...  Each of the Pooh characters performed their roles appropriate to themselves within this theme...  I thought it was darling...  There are always good social lessons within the Pooh renderings -- Rabbit, in himself, is a perfect opportunity for a parent to start working with their children in understanding this type of personality -- a personality they will run into again and again throughout their real lives...  Just because someone innately comes off as rather crabby, does not mean they are not a good person... Within reason in working with our young ones (carefully), this is an opportunity to teach them that most of us deserve second chances, and to not look at someone who comes off crabby as the trait that defines them...  Looking at people a little closer, we can often see and find other redeeming qualities...  This is exactly what I feel this movie is about and, again, it IS a good lesson and opportunity for us in working with our very young children (safety issues come first, of course...)",1251936000,,1189,4.915

1943495,1,B0000TGAAU,"I agree with the reviewer who said it's almost painful to watch. While it's true that this is, indeed, a different Winnie the Pooh video from all others (of course, this *should* be a ""given"") and the story does have a positive message (hidden somewhere for older viewers to understand), the movie is not for small children. The timeline is confusing to follow, the movie shows very little about Easter or celebrations, and Rabbit is indeed angry-- and even sometimes nasty-- throughout almost the entire film. The shame of this is that Pooh's audience is made of the youngest viewers. For me, it was annoying to spend 50 minutes reassuring and explaining things to my boys (3 and 5), and none of us was completely soothed by the last 10 minutes (? if that?) of ""everything's ok now"".

Another complaint I have is that there is also relatively little seen of Roo, and when he's present, he is sad, disappointed or ""trying to just hang in there"" because of Rabbit's behavior. The title is good marketing, but not accurate. In fact, there are long scenes between Rabbit and the narrator-- which is not fun for little kids.

I don't mind them using the ""A Christmas Carol"" storyline, but this version is weak, confusing and even scary for young children. At least with Dickens' performances, we adults can rely on costumes and other cues for timeline changes, not to mention our years of experience in understanding these things. It is not the case with this film, leaving kids behind. One reviewer makes the valid point that it's not terrible for young children not to be able to follow the story. I agree, but when the focus is on Rabbit (not one of the favorite characters like Roo or Pooh or even Piglet), and he spends almost the entire time getting upset and being mean to his friends, it's a shame-- not to mention the wrong message. I've put this DVD away for a few years when my kids are old enough not to be scared, able to follow the story, understand the message, and not mimic Rabbit's atrocious behavior.

If you're simply interested in a Easter-related movie that has the Disney Pooh characters in it for an hour, this is it-- there are plenty of children who will watch it just because it has the right characters. However, if you're at all interested in a reasonable story for young children to enjoy, you're better off finding something else.",1233360000,6,2357,4.64748201438849
1943496,1,B0000TGAAU,"I usually love everything Winnie the Pooh that comes along.  This movie is almost painful to watch.  There aren't any catchy songs, the storyline is stretched thin, and Rabbit's character is downright mean (I might even go as far as to say that he's abusive, while the other characters try to make excuses for him).  The only glint of wit in it is when Tigger makes a Dickens reference, as this is an unabashed and abyssmal rip-off of a Dickens classic.  Even my children are less than thrilled with it, and at ages 2 and 4 they are usually easy to please, as long as it's animated.  The younger child is now afraid of Rabbit.  Don't waste your money on this one: Pooh's Heffalump Movie, Piglet's BIG Movie, The Tigger Movie are all so much better!",1208217600,2,748,4.463235294117647

I don't understand why Disney decided to make an ""Easter"" DVD that had nothing to do with Easter. I mean they could have done a ""springtime"" DVD (as the show's title would imply) with their own made-up holiday, but that's not the case here. I imagine that non-Christian parents wouldn't want their kids watching anything having to do with Christian holidays, whereas Christian parents will likely be confused and disappointed by how this DVD repeatedly tries to explain ""the true meaning of Easter"" without ever even alluding to Christian doctrine. I certainly don't look to Disney for spiritual enlightenment, but neither do I expect from them such pointless and confusing children's fare.

At one point, Rabbit actually physically throws the other characters out of his house in a way that is almost violent.  For anyone who has grown up loving what the Pooh stories were originally all about, this film is a new low.",1132531200,15,566,4.696969696969697

How could they enjoy Easter without him....the Easter ....Rabbit?? huh?. Roo is set on having an Easter egg hunt so Tigger and Roo try to convince Rabbit to change his mind. Only when the narrator steps in and shows him the future without his friends does he realize the err of his ways. So Scrooge....um, excuse me.....Rabbit hooks up the best easter egg hunt, Roo teaches him the importance of holidays and what good friends are made of and Rabbit gets crowned the Eater Bunny again. It's very colorful and sweet. It doesn't teach the real meaning of Easter but it's Winnie the Pooh. It's for young children. Reviewers should also consider that not everyone celebrates Easter.

Rabbit has never been drawn so mean faced and so mean spirited talking as at the end of this movie (before he does an about face).  My younger kids couldn't figure it out. I predict this DVD will be available in large quantities used.  This is probably Disney's worst Pooh effort and totally out of character from the original A.A.

1943514,2,B0000TGAAU,"""Springtime With Roo"" would be better titled ""An Easter Carol,"" seeing as the story is a rip off of the classic Dicken's tale. The storyline is that Roo is very excited for his second Easter egg hunt, but Rabbit decides not to do Easter this year. Instead, he wants to have spring cleaning day. So the narrator takes rabbit(Scrooge) back in time to see the way Easter was last year. Then the narrator shows Rabbit the future and what will happen if he dosen't have Easter.
Disney usually has an entertaining story that everyone can get interested in, but they failed to do that with this Pooh film. There also aren't any jokes to laugh at. Only small children will have a good time with this film. The two Easter themed episodes from the popular series ""The Wonderful World of Winnie The Pooh"" which are extras on the DVD are better than the movie itself. The rest of the bonus features are games for little kids.
This film won't please your entire family, only little kids.(...)",1081555200,7,979,4.568181818181818
1943515,4,B0000TGAAU,"Spring time is in the air, and the beloved characters from the Hundred Acre Wood are gathering together to enjoy a new season. But something is rotten in the state of Pooh Corner. Rabbit, who always takes the role of the Easter Bunny, has decided that there shall be no Easter this year. Disheartened, the creatures all return to their homes after escaping Rabbit's commands to clean his house instead. Roo, however, is quite upset, and Tigger decides to approach Rabbit about the matter. By looking back in the book, Tigger learns that Rabbit grew bitter towards Easter because the previous Easter, everyone managed to ditch him and his ever-finicky plans to have everything in order, and have fun on their own.
Tigger learns the reason, but he can't remedy the situation. No one can. No one, that is, until the ever-present Narrator steps in, this time taking Rabbit to the Pages That Haven't Been Written Yet. In Dickens style, he shows Rabbit that if he had his way (no Easter, everything his way), then the other friends in the Wood would leave. Will Rabbit repent? Is it too late for him to change?
It's true, the plot might be a bit above and beyond the average toddler's capacity to comprehend. In the effort to mimic the allegory by Dickens, they stand a chance of losing their younger viewers. But it's not exactly a high crime, in my opinion.
This film also fails to capture the true essence of Easter. Not that I expected it to, you understand! But it might be a good idea to remind your young viewers that Easter is about more than eggs and bunnies, ribbons and flowers. It's a time to celebrate new life yes. But to celebrate the new life that is given us by God, through his Son Jesus!
The film is still cute - although certainly not among the best stock that Disney has produced. I think kids will enjoy this, but I also think it would be important to find something that reminds them of the true reason to celebrate Easter. I would suggest ""An Easter Carol"", from Veggie Tales.",1081036800,5,1994,4.557103064066852
