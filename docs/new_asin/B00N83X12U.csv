6612872,5,B00N83X12U,"It's rare that I take the time to see a film I know next to nothing about. I heard that there was this movie called ""Copenhagen"" and that it was a coming of age story. Something attracted me to it, and I decided to watch!

Wow! This film has a beautiful, loving pace to it, and a complicated love. The characters are deep and intertwined. The scenery and cinematography are gorgeous -- large credit goes to Copenhagen.

This film is as much about falling in love in relationships, as it is with discovering the beauty of a city. It's a vacation for two hours. Wonderful!",1412985600,10,570,4.419047619047619
6612873,5,B00N83X12U,"If you like quality independent film, don't miss this terrific movie set in beautiful Copenhagen. Solid writing, directing and cinematography, as well as excellent performances by Gethin Anthony (Renly Baratheon from #GameOfThrones) and the amazing young Frederikke Dahl Hansen (would be surprised if she doesn't win some acting awards for this film!). Cool soundtrack too!",1412812800,18,373,5.8

6612879,5,B00N83X12U,"This movie is a sleeper and a half, That I was really glad I took a chance to watch, Perhaps one of the best coming of age films, Frederikke Dahl Hansen was such a joy to watch, she had this presence about her. William is Americas biggest A-hole but when he meets Effy she gradually starts to teach him a thing or two about life. William is on a mission to find his Grandfather who abandon his father when he was very young. He finds a letter from his father who abandoned William when he was young also, his fathers last wish was to take a letter he wrote for Williams grandfather to read so that he would know how he felt about him, so in the process of trying to locate the grandfather ends up asking Effy for some help and then the adventure begins. The music is also very enjoyable, especially ""Stay the Night"" and ""Vi to er smeltet sammen"" which basically a major part of the movie.",1494201600,3,888,4.229411764705882

The characters that the actors portray are so real and amazing.  This is a critically acclaimed independent film which I feel deserves an Oscar more than most films out there. The actors are so diverse in their talents that it makes the film even more stunning than the backdrop of the film.  I cannot wait to see more from this director and these actors.  Loved  The diverse levels explored in this movie, the emotions, the empathy, And the reality explored  in the varied circumstances portrayed in this movie.  ",1493078400,,684,4.603305785123967
6612881,5,B00N83X12U,"It's easy to pass over this little gem of an independent film when you're scrolling through titles on Netflix.  I finally decided to check it out and I was blown away. Young Danish actress Frederikke Dahl Hansen gives an amazing, effortless, spot-on performance as a young lady with wisdom beyond her years, but who may be in too big of a hurry to grow up. Gethin Anthony (Game of Thrones) also does a great job playing the kind of self-centered, immature, womanizing jerk nobody likes.  This is one you'll want to watch more than once.",1492387200,,536,4.631578947368421

6612895,5,B00N83X12U,"It was beautiful to see a self-absorbed boy evolve into an honorable, caring man in this lovely film.  SPOILER ALERT: Yes, this treats the difficult subject of an attraction between a slightly underage girl and a slightly older, of-age young man.  But it so redeems itself by showing the man taking responsibility - as he should as the older party - and refraining from hurting the girl by taking advantage of her love for him.  In a world of too many shallow films portraying very pathetic values, this is a character-driven charmer.  And I'm making it sound more serious than it is.  It is very sweet and romantic and a fun jaunt around Amsterdam to boot!",1468713600,9,657,4.629310344827586

6612905,4,B00N83X12U,"Copenhagen Level 33 Entertainment  2014 Not Rated DVD version

This independent film is festooned with 6 award logos on its front cover.  It is the first feature-length film by the writer/director Mark Raso.  Nominally the lead character is William, played by Gethin Anthony but in reality Id have to say the lead character is Effy played by Frederikke Dahl Hansen.
William is an obnoxious ass of a character and initially its impossible to empathize with him.  To be fair he ended up the third wheel of a 3-person trip to Europe, with his best friend and his best friends girlfriend.  He and the girlfriend are competing for the friends attention and naturally he loses out.
It is only through his relationship with the local girl Effy that we find any reason to feel sympathetic for William, and the only reason she seems to find him interesting is that they both are struggling with unresolved feelings about absent father figures.

I wasn't able to determine how old Hansen was when this was filmed, but shes playing the role of a 14 year old girl [Almost 15!---I am guessing that is the legal age of consent in Denmark] and she brings to the role a wonderful adolescent sexuality.  No, there is no nudity in the film and although its unrated, in most countries it would probably score the equivalent of PG-13 [in the US, given our persistent squeamishness about sexuality it would probably get an R just on the basis of thematic material and an occasional swearword].  The film for me was worth watching to see Hansens performance as Effy.  I give it a B.",1447113600,2,1560,4.681318681318682
6612906,5,B00N83X12U,very good.,1445558400,,10,4.5
6612907,5,B00N83X12U,"Can't say enough about this film, clearly everyone but Puritan American squeamish moms are loving and raving about this film and I am glad to join their ranks.  It was mesmerizing, the performances, the story, the somewhat unbelievable open ending ?! but OK, I cannot wait to see a sequel and hopefully the challenges and happiness for these characters.  The filmmaker says its 50/50 whether he'll do a sequel, I can only hope he sees that he can't leave the audience hanging and his characters unresolved.  He owes us, right?

For the squeamish moms - a note that unlike the hypocrisy of the Puritan Americans who send their teens to die in war, but won't let them drink for another 3 years, who either let moms pass all kinds of crazy anti-human laws to vilify human activity and consent in any and all dimensions to send consenting beings to prison, or let them be sent to prison based on crazy historic laws that carry forward from a century past - a note that unlike here, the age of consent is 15 in Denmark, and the character tells us she's days away from being legal, later confirmed by the mother in the story recognizing her birthday.  Yes, some of the smoke, love, swear... omg imagine that.  Human beings living lives.

Fantastic, makes Americans think about barbaric puritan views, criminal prosecution destroying good human lives, and their plain ole vilification of good human contact by consenting beings.  Fantastic performances, fantastic story, fantastic execution of their story.  We want a sequel.",1443571200,3,1518,4.852713178294573
6612908,2,B00N83X12U,"I would have given it more stars, but hated the constant swearing (really didn't add anything, and made the character unlikeable) and the smoking, come on, this is the 21st century, we all know smoking can kill you, so why introduce it at all, and a 14 year old girl, too smoking and drinking/ What kind of message does it send.  Would have been redeemable without all that.",1440979200,3,374,4.5
6612909,5,B00N83X12U,"One of the best summer love films I have EVER seen...comparable to Unmade Beds (2009).

The acting, music, story, characters, atmosphere all just click perfectly together.  The film contain very strong Lolita-like undertones.

Copenhagen (2014) is about a young American (claiming to be Canadian) in his twenties, by the name of William who travels to Denmark on a quest to find out more about his father's heritage and family.  Lets just say he was not on good terms with his recently passed away father.  Accompanied by his best friend Jeremy and his jealous girlfriend Jennifer the bickering trio part ways after a ""very interesting night"" at a pretty swanky hotel.  William who is an angry and deep down childish and yet sensitive young man by a blind-chance makes acquaintance with a young, drop dead naturally gorgeous, black eye, blond hair Danish girl who at first is willing to help Will...until the summer days take them on a ""perhaps"" life altering adventure...

The film made a deep-lasting impression on me...

I was completely taken aback by this film...that is in a very positive way.  Copenhagen is not only a film about an interesting love story, it is also shot in a way that captures the picturesque beauty of Copenhagen and its people and culture.  This almost feels like a film a young Woody Allen would make.  Not to be missed...Every men dreams of such a love story...Only few get to experience it.",1440374400,3,1421,4.854771784232365

It was hard to imagine that the leading "" American"" roles were by English actors. The tense edgy emotions raised by the film when the audience realises that the woman in the film was just 14 years , the moment in the art gallery with the girls profile positioned next to an ancient Greek ( ?) bust was eerie and a master touch. It all ends as it perhaps should. Some great cameo roles, particularly the girls mother who played Rita in the Danish TV show. I watched it three times.",1433548800,3,609,4.545454545454546

6612920,5,B00N83X12U,"This is truly an exceptional movie.  It does faintly remind me of Before Sunrise, but the depth of what remains unspoken sets this movie apart from anything I have ever seen.  William is searching for what is missing.  He thinks it is his grandfather, when in reality, it is this amazing young lady.  They have mutual lack of a father figure.  She never knew hers, and his was pretty awful.  I get the impression that Effy has never had a healthy relationship with any male figure and had to grow up way too fast.  William has no respect for women and has failed to grow up at all.

Anyone having issues with the age difference is missing the point entirely.  There are many ways to love someone and in one day, William learns how to do that very thing.",1429315200,5,753,4.359712230215828
6612921,5,B00N83X12U,"I was surprised at the reactions to this movie. I enjoyed the journey of self discovery (teen) and the maturity that comes through even when your behavior has been reckless in the past. I did not watch this movie with a big moral magnifying glass, but as a love story that had to be put on hold.",1426636800,5,295,4.192982456140351
6612922,1,B00N83X12U,"This is a love story about an adult man in his 20s and a 14 year old child. I watched this movie on Netflix and they were somewhat accurate in their description about how a man's view of women is changed by his encounter with a 14-year old girl. So I knew going in that I would be watching a movie about a relationship between two people with a huge age gap.  However, I thought I was in for another treat like ""Beautiful Girls"" starring Timothy Hutton and a young Natalie Portman.  In that movie, Ms. Portman was actually 14 and Timothy Hutton was 36.  It too was a story of a man needing to grow up and young girl wanting to grow up too fast. There were moments in that movie that made me a little squeamish, where the young girl was flirting with the older man and he even flirted back a little.  But that relationship was handled APPROPRIATELY!  At no point did the adult male use the girl to satisfy any selfish needs.  Instead, he learned from her, about the beauty of innocence and youth and applied that insight to his relationships with other adult females.

Another reviewer pointed out that this movie, Copenhagen, could easily have been made with the actress playing a slightly older age (she was 19/20 when it was filmed) so clearly playing her actual age would have made no difference and I likely would have given this movie a 4 or 5 star review.  Twenty minutes in and I was enjoying it, until the relationship started to get somewhat romantic.  So I stopped watching because I could not subject myself to a minute more of this disgusting attempt to normalize immoral and evil behavior. I turned to the reviews to see if maybe I was misinterpreting the signals...but nope.  So, I'm writing this review as a PSA to other people who enjoy indie romances.  This movie is just a filthy attempt to normalize abhorrent behavior.  It's dressed up with beautiful European scenery and the actress is very good.  But in the real world, there is nothing acceptable about an adult having a romantic/sexual relationship with a child. There are NO justifications.",1426550400,7,2065,4.563685636856369

You can't help it but love Effy's character from the beginning to the end. She is sweet, quick and witty. William's immature shell is shed quickly through the story and a soft, caring young man is seen.

6612941,5,B00N83X12U,"Although it can be said this is a coming of age story, I think there's more to this film than that. The young lady is, at least to me, mature beyond her years, I was shocked when she reveals her age. In many ways, she's far more mature than the fellow she falls in love with, who is apparently around twice her age. William is a hard character to like at first, but Effy provides a kind of catalyst to his development in the film. I think the final question is, what happens after the film's conclusion? That is perhaps where the viewer becomes the most involved in the movie. Obviously, the first question is does William deserve someone like Effy ?Are her feelings real? Is what we see in this film a new realization of Romeo & Juliette, "" Ill lay fourteen of my teethand yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but fourshe is not fourteen..."" which is the first thing that popped into my head when she tells William her age. Of course we all know how things ended up for Juliette, but my feeling is, given enough time & if what we viewed was real, this could be the happy ending Shakespeare denied his audience. This film may ultimately be a kind of touchstone for each viewer, is the moral/legal problem the deciding factor, or love? I choose love, because if it isn't, Romeo & Juliette becomes an empty stage with empty characters. I think the same goes for this film, without the emotions being real, this movie becomes a Nabakovian, emotional dystopia & that doesn't seem to me to be what I am hoping for. So, for me, the girl gets the guy because Shakespeare already wrote the other ending.",1415404800,28,1595,4.373737373737374

This is how the movie is described:

""When William, an immature twenty-something traveling across Europe, finally gets to Copenhagen, his father's birthplace, he meets the youthful but wise Danish girl Effy. Together they set off on an adventure to find William's grandfather and along the way develop a unique relationship that changes their lives forever.""

Well, Effy is not youthful...she is, in fact, an actual youth.  As in she is 14 years old.  I'm really sorry for spoiling the plot ""twist"" of this movie right up front in my review, but the way this is billed couldn't be further from the movie as it actually is.  While they are careful to just insinuate the ""romantic"" feelings between the two, it's still deeply disturbing to me that this man in his late 20s is having this type of relationship with a 14 year old child.  Not OK.

The two of them do not go off on an adventure...William goes to find his grandfather by himself at the end and it feels very shoehorned in at that point.  The real point of this movie is the relationship between William and Effy.  And that is sort of sad because the plot actually would have worked as well in my opinion if she had been over the age of consent.

The acting, especially by Effy, was quite good and the city looks lovely, but this is not a coming of age film.  Not for at least another 3 or 4 years...or it's about 10 years too late for William.",1413676800,16,1415,4.484375

8676530,5,B00N83X12U,"This little movie is both provocative and poignant...and keeps you somewhat conflicted by the magic between its 2 incredible leads. It's both a travelogue of Copenhagen and the journey of 2 people in search of a connection. To life. To something..

William is a caustic and bitter young man; clearly  a bit of a jerk. He and his best friend are sleeping their way across Europe as they make their way to Copenhagen where William can discover some link to a Danish father and a family he never knew. It's fairly easy to comprehend that some of his anger issues are tied to this void in his life. When his friend meets a woman and ditches him William is left alone and meets the iridescent Effy who agrees to help him find his way around.

William and Effy probably have some of the best chemistry I've seen on the screen. This is both troubling and magical because we know that Effy is too young for William. At least chronologically.
Besides the more obvious elements of what's going on is the nuanced more subtle ones that brings the beauty of these 2 people coming together. And what these details accomplish.

If you're not put off by the fact that Copenhagen does allow smoking publicly (which has nothing to do with the plot) and are open to see where these 2 end up then I definitely recommend this film.

8676532,4,B00N83X12U,"I would not say this was an extraordinary movie. However, it is a rather sweet  love story of another kind,  and the characters are engaging.  I thought that William, the self-absorbed 28-year-old American millennial is an interesting character.  He is ""sophisticated"" on the surface, yet still an immature child, as so many millennials are.  The Danish Effy was a delightful,  precocious 14-year-old who outsmarts him at every turn. Both Willliam and Effy  are somewhat adrift because of their families' dysfunction.  They are both victims of that dysfunction. The story was a bit too  ""breezy"" at times for me.  A brush with even possible pedophilia is no laughing matter. I thought that Effy looked much older than 14, which lessened the impact of the theme of the story. The best thing about the story is that both William and Effy did right by themselves and each other.  William is well on the way to becoming a real man.  Effy will finish growing up. Very sweet little story about the pangs and errors of growing up.",1501113600,6,1023,4.816091954022989
