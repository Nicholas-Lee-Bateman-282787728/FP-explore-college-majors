5212879,4,B0090SI4HO,"Arnold Schwarzenegger may be getting a little long in the tooth, but he's back in an action movie and it's not bad.  ""The Last Stand"" has a cartel boss (Edward Noriega) staging a spectularly good escape from federal custody in Las Vegas and high-tailing it for the Mexican border in a hot car with an FBI agent as hostage.  Schwarzenegger is the sheriff of the small Arizona town on the border where the cartel boss plans to cross into Mexico, with a few of his thugs clearing the way.  The premise is a nice setup for lots of car chases, gunfights, one-liners, and some redemptive behavior for the good guys in the small town.

Sommerton Junction happens to be half-empty, with the mayor, the football team, and most of the citizen out of town for a big game.  Sheriff Ray Own, former LAPD police officer, is in charge and expecting a quiet weekend.  Not so much; first a gang of gun-toting mercenaries murder a farmer, then they shoot up a police car.  Owens soon learns what the FBI already knows, that the cartel boss is headed for Sommerton Junction, and help will not get there in time.  Owen rallies his deputes and the remaining townspeople for a last stand.

The plot is pretty flimsy, but the action keeps the movie moving fast enough to make it all work.  Luis Guzman and Jaimie Alexander are good as Owen's plucky deputies, and Forest Whitaker almost steals the movie as a frustrated FBI agent.  There's a good car chase through a cornfield, and a great mano-a-mano confrontation on a bridge.  The movie doesn't take itself entirely seriously and neither should the viewer; recommended for Arnold fans.",1358726400,,1614,4.6643109540636045
5212880,3,B0090SI4HO,"Arnold is back and gives it his best in this new film on quite a different take from the Schwarzenegger we have all known as we became mesmerized to the big screen. Although Arnold is not as young and funny as in True Lies, not as series as in Total Recall, and not as strong as in the Terminator, the Sheriff he portrays in this Western is still entertaining. His job as a cop on the Arizona-Mexican border is to protect his territory, while preventing crime. Trouble brews as he meets a no-good Cartel boss with something real bad up his sleeves, and Arnold has to put it to a stop. Sheriff Ray Owens must gather his crew, not fit for the job, and stop the Cartel boss from building a portable bridge in Mexico. Arnold must defend his border, but his helpers may need a lot of backup. The bullets go flying, the story-line bursts with exciting action, and fighting gets heated up as it sets off the flames for the final showdown. Overall, this film is entertaining, and acting is good. Highly recommended for Arnold Schwarzenegger fans, and those who enjoy Westerns!",1358640000,7,1068,4.510309278350515
5212881,4,B0090SI4HO,This Movie was Awesome and Action Packed and Big Arnold really did a Good Job since his Last Film which was Terminator 3. And some of the Actors in it I didn't like Like Forest Whitaker which I f#$%ing Hate and that One Ugly old Fat Mexican Guy That is A cop in this movie those are the Only Actors I hate in this Movie that is why I give it 4 Stars But Overall this is a Good Action Film. If your Looking for another Kick Butt Action Movie with Arnold this is it.,1358640000,,464,3.8947368421052633
5212882,3,B0090SI4HO,"I remember weeks ago seeing back-to-back trailers for this film and Sylvester Stallone's ""Bullet to the Head.""  Sly's film looked ridiculous and stupid, not to mention he is after thugs that took his daughter.  How original.  But then Arnold's movie trailer comes on and it seems pretty clear we are going to get good guys and bad guys in an unlikely shoot-out, but damn if it doesn't look like fun.  And damn if it isn't.

Schwarzenegger plays Sheriff Ray Owens, a small town cop on the Arizona-Mexico border.  Coming his way from Las Vegas is an escaped cartel boss (Eduardo Noriega) in a souped-up Corvette ZR-1.  In a ridiculous and convoluted scenario, this occurs during a transfer supervised by FBI agent John Bannister played by Forest Whitaker in a performance about as lame as his character's  management of the transfer.  Maybe Whitaker just couldn't understand director Jee-woon Kim's instructions.

The fun really starts when Cortez (Noriega) approaches the border town.  You see Cortez is also a professional race car driver.  Think about it.  In an earlier set up, Cortez has sent a cadre of henchmen ahead to prepare a portable bridge over a ravine into Mexico.  Since everyone is out of town at a football game, the sheriff will have to defend their border with an out-of-shape deputy (Luis Guzman), another pair of deputies new to the job (Zach Gilford and Jaimie Alexander), the town drunk/ Iraq War veteran (Rodrigo Santoro) and town gadfly (Johnny Knoxville).

Arnold is at his self-deprecating best as the tired veteran of the L. A. police force just looking for a little quiet time.  The film is exactly what it promises, nothing more.  It's fun.",1358640000,3,1669,4.9035714285714285
5212883,4,B0090SI4HO,"Just saw the movie...
First thoughts are it was very, very good to see Arnold back in action!
Arnold looked older, which was expected, but he looked good.

Arnold definately looked slow at times with his movements & acting. I could tell he is rusty!
However, he did play a good Sheriff & had a few memorable lines.  He also showed some of his Strength & Fighting ability from the past in the films major fight scene.

Arnold, had a good supporting cast(including the humor of J. Knoxville, and the solid performance of Forrest Whittaker), so that took a lot of pressure off Arnold to take on the whole persona & load like he has in some of his past movies.
Meaning, all eyes were not just on Arnold!!!

The storyline was good! Acting was good enough to make the movie work!

It was just Awesome to see Arnold back & he will only get better with more movies to come.

I give this movie an overall grade of a B...

Thanks for reading my review & thanks to Arnold for returning to acting!!!
I have missed ya big guy!!!
Im ready to see you in another Terminator!!!",1358553600,22,1060,4.3232323232323235
5212884,5,B0090SI4HO,"The Last Stand is a movie that must be nominated for 2014's Oscar for Best Picture or at least shortlisted for that. The reason is that Arnold Schwarzenegger himself puts in a performance worthy to net him the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Oscars, the People's Choice Awards and even the Golden Globes. When you read my review of his mighty fine piece of thespian method acting, you, too, will understand why.

The plot is simple, which alone should give this movie plaudits because it follows the ""Keep It Simple, Stupid"" formula. Schwarzenegger plays a retiring border sheriff by the name of Gerhard Knoblauch, and his deputy is none other than another equally highly regarded method actor, Johnny Knoxville. Together, they make up the law enforcement team in the tiny, American border city called Los Brokeback. They have to face a drug cartel boss called Felipe Calderon, who busts out of an American courthouse to hightail it back to his homeland of Mexico, that cesspool of murders, drugs and unbelievably unfettered corruption in all walks of society (are Club Med's down there still honoring coupons?)

Of course, it's up to Knoblauch and Knoxville to stop that burrito from making it into illegal alien land, AKA, Mexico. The plot unfolds in such a seamlessly perfect way that explains why I'm calling for acting awards for Schwarzenegger. For example, every time Schwarzenegger opens his mouth to, I presume, deliver a line or two of dialogue, there is always this ungodly-sounding, thick, unintelligible Austrian accent that distorts everything and makes him speak in non-stop broken English. I mean, for an actor to be able to produce this fine piece of showmanship that has him looking like he's an Austrian refugee who's only pretending to be an American actor is breathtaking. Absolutely breathtaking.

And don't even allow me to start on that brilliant supporting thespian named Johnny Knoxville; he is easily a cross between Lionel Barrymore and Jack Nicholson! Throughout The Last Stand, Knoxville's character comes up with increasingly intellectual ways to try and stop the Mexican burrito drug lord from making it back to Mexico. For instance, in one pivotal scene, Knoxville actually staples his balls/a/c/k to some cattle, which promptly stampede away, thereby elongating his body part. In another equally high-minded scene that is extremely relevant to the highly complicated plot development of this movie, Knoxville actually staples his butt cheeks together, then shoves a toy car into his a***, all the while dangling out of a helicopter and bungee jumping. All of these actions of brilliance work to actually stop the Mexican burrito from making it back to Mexico, thereby allowing Knoblauch to apprehend him and send him back to where he belongs (Barack Obama's White House, which makes him a citizen through the Dream Act!!).

Folks, please, please, please do yourselves all a damn favor and see The Last Stand. I know, I know, I know that you probably have no money at all since Obama has failed to bring the unemployment rate down from January 2009, when he was inaugurated, but you at least caught a break through Obamacare, which raised your healthcare premiums! Yes. If you want to see the greatest movie made in the last 70 years, see The Last Stand.",1358380800,3,3289,5.040441176470588
5212885,5,B0090SI4HO,"""Governator Ah'-nold"" is back. This R-rated action flick is targeted strictly for the fans of R-rated action flicks; I was surprised to discover that I am one of them! This fast-paced bullet-riddled comedy is entertaining from the first frame. I've never laughed through a bloody shoot-out before but our screening audience had a great time. Korean director Jee-woon Kim (""The Good, the Bad and the Weird"") brings chop-socky experience and a great sense of humor to the screen with non-stop, clich-ridden energy.

All the humor is character driven, so let's talk about the characters:
  * Arnold Schwarzenegger (""The Expendables"") is a weary sheriff in a little bitty (fictitious) Arizona border town, just putting in his time until retirement. He saw enough action in Los Angeles and was tired of blood, so he has moved here to relax.
  * Luis Guzman (""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"") is his chief deputy. He's not a coward, but he IS a realist, so when they hear that a high-powered jefe from a drug cartel is headed their way, he's thinking maybe they could look the other way ""just for a little while...""
  * Zach Gilford (""Crazy Kind of Love"") is one of our hero's hapless deputies. The first thing he does is break his nose while target shooting because he doesn't expect a high-caliber pistol to kick.
  * Jaimie Alexander (""Thor"") is another deputy, scared spitless, but she's game.
  * Johnny Knoxville (Lots of TV) is one of the local yokels who volunteers to help our hero; but this gun lover INSISTS on being deputized. I laughed at his metal military helmet dangling on a rope as he is helped to cover.
  * Eduardo Noriega (""Blackthorn"") is that aforementioned jefe, skillfully driving a singularly designed Corvette muscle car. He is smart, tough and determined.
  * Forest Whitaker (""Repo Men"") is with the FBI; the stunningly clever jailbreak happens on his watch and he WILL bring back his prisoner, the most wanted drug kingpin in the Western hemisphere.
  * Genesis Rodriguez (""Casa de mi Padre"") is a lovely FBI agent taken hostage by that nasty escapee.

We have memorable thugs, a wonderful assortment of townspeople (some of whom have great reasons to stay in the diner), muscle cars, great use of a corn field, unlimited firepower, lots of blood, several humorous through lines that pop up at just the right moment, one little kiss and some appropriate profanity. I'm putting this one in my Guilty Pleasures file and look forward to Amazon telling me when I can get it on DVD.",1358380800,9,2503,4.835680751173709

The role of sheriff Ray Owen lets Arnold be a hero without making it a joke to be older and wiser. It completely acknowledges that Arnold is not 22 years old anymore and he doesn't try to pretend that he is. I'm surprised at some of the negative comments because really?...you people knew going in that it was an Arnold-movie.

So I wasn't expecting much out of this.  It didn't do well at the box office.  But I think it turned out to be on of his best movies.

His semi-retirement is disturbed when a high-level Mexican war-lord escapes from custody in an amazing way and heads toward Mexico in a supercharged car. Many officers are killed during the chase. Our semi-retired sheriff turns out to be the only man left to stop the war-lord from getting to Mexico.

The Last Stand gives me everything I expect from this film. I get to see a lot stuff I own in real life getting abused and pushed to the limits of what they can do. My 500 S&W looks so good here. I got to see My 2013 Corvette (I own the zo6 and not the ZR1 but still sexy) pushed to the limits of what it can do and yes it's capable of doing almost 220 mph. The new Camaro vs. Corvette scene in the corn field is very good. The cast seems to give it all they have and you can never go wrong with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the drivers seat of any action film or a Camaro. The gun fights are pretty good as well. The cast is all funny when they need to be.

5213721,4,B0090SI4HO,"Released in 2013, ""The Last Stand"" stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as an aging sheriff of a small border town in Arizona. When a drug kingpin (Eduardo Noriega) escapes FBI custody and apprehends a suped-up corvette to make it to Mexico, the sheriff & Co. are the only ones who can stop the thug from freedom. The members of the sheriffs cadre are played by Luis Guzmn, Jaimie Alexander, Rodrigo Santoro, Zach Gilford and Johnny Knoxville.

At some point during the first act the movie struck me as a cinematic descendent of 1977s The Gauntlet mixed with elements of the mythic Western. Later on, a car is blown full of holes in an overdone and amusing way followed by an aggressive bus sequence, both reminiscent of that Eastwood flick. While the tone is quasi-realistic, theres an amusing edge. I also like the camaraderie of the deputies and the sub-themes of redemption and honor above filthy lucre. While not as good as The Gauntlet IMHO, The Last Stand comes close and is the perfect solution for when you need a thrilling, fun and inspiring action flick.

The film runs 107 minutes and was shot in New Mexico and Las Vegas.

5213815,1,B0090SI4HO,"If I could, I'd give it zero stars. This movie is the epitome of boring nonsense. Despite his overpowering macho presence on the poster, Schwarzenegger appears briefly and mostly sitting down, unless, of course, he's shooting something. He puts hardly any effort in to acting, although there's not much required in his role. I guess he had a few bills to pay. You'll be ""treated"" to a ill-formed compilation of the standard sole savior plot, escapes, chases, shoot-'em-ups, and stultifying dialog. Even Forest Whitaker looked bored, unfortunate since he's in the film far more than Arnold. If it's on your list, cross it off. If it's not, then just forget it.",1441584000,,659,4.945945945945946

5213824,4,B0090SI4HO,"Let's face it, if you enjoy Arnold it is probably because of the action and adventure and, lots of times, the campy fun that his flicks tend to deliver. For me, The Last Stand is a bit of a throwback to his 80's movies but with much better Fx. Overall, this is quite fun with Arnold as a long-time cop who saw it all in Southern California and is now enjoying his final working years in peace and quiet as the sheriff of a small Arizona town, near the Mexico border. That all comes to a horrific end with some very bad guys, including a very rich cartel boss, heading his way. There are some great chase scenes and a wild and crazy shoot 'em up. A very good cast (including Forest Whitaker, Jaimie Alexander, Eduardo Noriega, to name a few) adds to Arnold keeping his town ... uh ... sort of safe. A lot of good one liners add to the mix.",1439769600,2,838,4.147239263803681

5213875,4,B0090SI4HO,"In his 1st leading role since stepping down as the governator, this movie was nevertheless released with little fanfare and did not do much @ the box office.  As such, I really was not expecting much, but figured it was a great price for an action flick.  Truth be told, I was surprised by how entertaining I found this film to be.

Arnie plays Ray Owens, a cop who saw a lot of ""action"" when he served on a narcotics task force for the LAPD.  After a violent career, Ray decided he wanted to settle down and finish out his law enforcement days as the sheriff of a remote town in Arizona, right next to the Mexican border.  About his biggest police duty is to write out a parking ticket in this small town.

His plan for an easy twilight of his working days is working great until the leader of a Mexican drug cartel (played by Eduardo Noriega) gets away from the FBI.  The cartel leader is similar to the real-life El Chapo who escaped from a Mexican prison by riding a motorcyle through a custom built tunnel underneath his prison.  Instead of a motorcycle, this guy drives a souped-up Corvette to get away.  As he is a race car driver as well as a kingpin, the ""fun begins"" when he gets behind the wheel.  He chooses to cross the border in Ray's small town, and the cavalry is too far away to help poor Ray & his deputies deal with thugs hired by the cartel.

Such is the outline of the plot.  It's the first time I have seen Forrest Whitaker in awhile and was good to see him again.  Jamie Alexander portrays the loveliest deputy I've seen in quite some time!  The Arnie of today is not the intimidating presence of Arnie of the 80s, nor does he claim to be.  In fact, Arnie wears a long sleeve shirt throughout the entire film and does not take off his shirt a single time.  Hence, people who are wondering how buffed up he  is these days are apt to be disappointed.  While Arnie in his prime would have made mincemeat of the villain in this film, the thug is more than a challenge for his persona of the aging Sheriff.

All in all, a fun movie.  Not a ""can't miss"" but it's way better than I thought it would be and well worth the price of admission.",1438646400,,2156,4.224938875305623
5213876,4,B0090SI4HO,"Arnold Schwarzenegger, arguably the greatest action star in movie history, leaves politics behind and returns to the big screen in his first starring role in close to a decade with THE LAST STAND. Basically a remake of the classic western HIGH NOON with bigger guns, it's hard to imagine a better vehicle for Schwarzenegger to get back into the game with. Tense, exciting, explosive, and sometimes wickedly funny, this is the kind of picture that Schwarzenegger was born for.

The plot is simple. An infamous drug lord escapes from the convoy that was supposed to deliver him to death row, in a special edition race car no less. His army of loyal thugs goes ahead of him to the Arizona border town of Sommerton to literally build a bridge for him into Mexico. Sommerton's sheriffthat would be Schwarzeneggerand his small, inexperienced cadre of deputies are the only thing standing between the rogue convict and escape. Can they stop him, and will anything be left of sleepy Sommerton after the smoke clears? Director Jee-woon Kim does a fine job of piecing together a first-class thriller that mixes action, mayhem, and laughs to good effect. Kim sets Schwarzenegger up perfectly, and if the star of all-time action greats like PREDATOR and COMMANDO is getting a little long in the tooth, he nonetheless proves he's still more than able to carry a picture. An able supporting cast does a fine job as well, particularly Edwardo Noriega as the vicious drug czar, Forest Whittaker as a federal agent desperate to recapture the escaped criminal, and Jaime Alexander and Luis Guzman as a couple of Schwarzenegger's loyal but understandably very scared deputies.

Long-time Schwarzenegger fans will find THE LAST STAND very much to their liking. If it's not quite up there with hits like TRUE LIES or THE TERMINATOR, it's still a terrific actioner that serves up a full plate of entertaining thrills.",1438128000,,1895,4.955974842767295

5214296,4,B0090SI4HO,"American critics seriously missed the boat on this one.  This 2013 action film was Arnold Schwarzenegger's first starring vehicle after returning to the movies and it was widely dismissed as a failed comeback effort when it's actually one of the best movies of the big Austrian's career.  The story concerns a Mexican drug kingpin named Gabriel Cortez (Spanish actor Eduardo Noriega, very good) who escapes from federal custody while being transferred to a maximum security prison for execution.  Since The Last Stand is nothing if not eccentric the escape is no mere shoot-em-up--it involves construction equipment, men sliding ninja like across building rooftops with grappling ropes and some colorful misdirection.

In addition to being a cartel kingpin Gabriel raced cars in South America professionally under a pseudonym so his plan is to drive a souped up Camaro that can go 200mph across the country to a small Arizona town where he has a heavily armed team building a temporary bridge that will allow him to cross a canyon back into Mexico.  Unfortunately for him the sheriff of that small town is Arnold Schwarzenegger--he and his small and mostly inexperienced crew of misfits is determined to hold the town until the FBI and SWAT arrives.

The fast car getaway scenes unexpectedly allows The Last Stand to include elements of 1970's fast car movies like Vanishing Point and Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, along with the more expected shoot-outs.  Korean director Jee-woon Kim (The Good, The Bad, the Weird and I Saw the Devil) making his Hollywood debut gives a master class in how to direct action scenes, constantly finding imaginative ways to stage and film his action set-pieces without ever resorting to heavy CGI or the incoherent fast-edits that American directors badly use these days--what's happening is always clear which makes the scenes more exciting to watch.  None of the action scenes feel perfunctory or completely predictable--Jee-woon Kim clearly takes great pleasure in making movies and he's very good at it.

The Last Stand also makes nice use of supporting cast scene-stealers like Forrest Whitaker, Johnny Knoxville, Luis Guzmn and Peter Stormare who are all allowed to chew the scenery enough to make their screen time memorable.  Arnold Schwarzenegger will never be a great actor but the campiness that can sometimes infect his performances is kept in check, allowing him an iconic bigger-than-life presence not unlike John Wayne in his better late career roles.

If you like action then The Last Stand is a must-see.  Director Jee-woon Kim made some genuinely great movies in his home country before trying out his luck in Hollywood.  While The Last Stand lacks the gravity of some of his darker efforts like I Saw the Devil, A Bittersweet Life and A Tale of Two Sisters, all of which are amazing, it compares pretty favorably to The Good, The Bad, The Weird which is one of his lighter and sillier films and feels like a cross between Sergio Leone and a Looney Toons cartoon.  The Last Stand never quite becomes that nutty but it's fast paced, inventive and a lot of fun.  It's also one of those rare movies that's just as enjoyable on repeat viewings, possibly even more because it's easier to appreciate how well the action sequences are shot and edited when you already know what's going to happen.

The Last Stand is one of those movies like John Wick and The Raid 2 that simply gives me a lot of pleasure every time I watch it.  The Last Stand may not be a classic--the screenplay never really comes close to matching the ingenuity of the direction--but it's still a blast to watch.  It's also one of those rare films like The Terminator and Predator where someone actually figured out how to use Arnold Schwarzenegger perfectly.  It's too bad The Last Stand was a critically panned flop but it's probably one of those movies like The Long Kiss Goodnight and Dredd that will find an appreciative audience on home video.",1435881600,,3957,4.923308270676691

Arnold is kept covered in as many jackets and layers of clothes as they could find to hide his ""Governor body."" Forrest Whitaker does his usual tantrum style acting and employs his three basic faces. I am now convinced that a roomful of monkeys can write a screenplay. Jokes fall flatter than the bad guys with ""military experience"" that constantly run from cover and concealment to chase down one person. Every encounter Arnie had with a villain you could almost hear the screenwriters STRAINING to squeeze out ""The Line"" that must be in every Ah-nahld movie. But it never came. Just more painful and poorly written drivel. And talk about ""product placement!""

Arnold here is an over sized old man playing a small town's serif,

It is a nice action movie with a couple of great muscle cars, an a lot
of automatic weapons. The cast is not that bad and the jokes and
funny scenes seem almost real, well at least more real than the action.
Schwarzenegger does seem old in this movie but still he is not all that bad.
Maybe he must start thinking of laying back a little, and maybe start directing
(ha ha).

""Yeah, the fugitive guy is definitely coming this way. We just got shot at by his men!"" -Sheriff

Arnold does not register as an Arizona sheriff with me so the character is immediately difficult to accept.

5216884,1,B0090SI4HO,"First off, I like Arnold, and his genre.

But this movie is a stinker. Predictable mush (loud, explosive mush) with a script with so many holes in it that you could drive a Corvette through it (a small sample: where are the State Police? Where is the National Guard - you only need a phone call to the Governor, where is the media? Does the FBI only own one helicopter? ... and on and on...). The script was so bad that you can almost see the actors wince - along with you - as they deliver the lines. The script even telegraphs (telegraphs?, no, more like screams) the final line 5 minutes into movie, for heaven's sake.

My guess (and hope) is that the stunt and special effects crews wrote the next day's script each evening over a brew.

Really Mr. S.? Hopefully ""you'll be back"" in something better.",1429660800,2,804,4.382550335570469

5216924,3,B0090SI4HO,"Movie was Ok... not great, not terrible.

Arnold did fine.  Some funny scenes with Johnny Knoxville.

The movie was just ridiculous.  Here are two reasons why.

1. The overall premise was just unbelievable.  You're telling me a that billionaire Mexican drug lord gets sprung by his henchman and he decides to drive - TO DRIVE - from Vegas to Mexico in a stolen Corvette - by himself?  Really? And the police can't catch him in the several hours it takes to drive to Mexico, because the car is too fast... Really?  And apparently the cops that do manage to catch up to him can't use spike strips?  Really? Ridiculous!

2. Suspension of disbelief? Nope.  Too many times I thought, ""That is just ridiculous and completely implausible!""  Here's an example: a corvette gets used as a ramp to launch a Suburban into the air at 100+ MPH.  Then continues to drive away away at 100+ MPH--- really?",1429574400,,888,4.615384615384615

It's been a long time since I've seen a good action movie of this caliber.  In this one Arnold plays a character that's vulnerable, facing old age and tired of seeing good people being killed in the line of duty.  If your are a fan of the action genre, it's not a film that lets you down.  I got this in the five dollar bin and don't pay any more for this.  For the price it's worth your five dollars...no more though.  I like Arnold better in this stage of his career because he's not playing a super human and a character that people can relate to.

5219249,2,B0090SI4HO,"Formulaic movie with a lot of blood spraying from shooting, and a huge hand gun that you know will be used against the bad guys. There is no suspense or interesting acting. Actors are probably doing their best to pull up this script. It's okay for what it is...a shooting move. I intentionally don't say action, since the script part is so anemic. Arnold is there to add star power, but it is still a B or C type of movie. If you are bored and looking for quick entertainment I guess it's okay, but I would not repeat my mistake the consciously choose this movie unless the selection is very poor, there are much better action movies.",1425081600,,634,4.38135593220339

5219688,4,B0090SI4HO,"This is a fairly average movie. The reason I gave it a high rating is because of the stunt car driving, and the black Corvette Z is out of this world. You've seen Bullitt and Vanishing Point, no doubt. Well, this isn't as good as those legendary car chase movies. But I'll put this Corvette Z against any car on film. It's a fire breathing monster, and that's true to life of the car, and the stunts were spectacular in the extreme. The only thing that puts the two classic movies in front of this is that the classics depict the madhouse driving for much longer periods of time.  It's surely not the cars, because this Corvette is bleeding Ferrari blood, and it's much faster, more responsive, quicker, sleeker, and Black Hole black.",1424476800,,734,4.518796992481203

5219746,4,B0090SI4HO,"Let's be honest, the return of an action star like Schwarzenegger to the action genre after a long absence could have gone horribly bad and I was surprised to see that this film did not fall into any of those traps.  The plot was more believable then I expected, not too predictable and provided some enjoyable characters to hang out with along the way.  Nice balance of humor and action as well.

It still had some flaws that could not be ignored, like the idea that driving a really fast car being the quickest way to get out of the country from Las Vegas and that no law enforcement agency between the two locations had the resources to stop it.  Also, I feel Forest Whitaker was very under utilized in favor of the pretty but shallow bad guy and his accomplice.  But even factoring all those issues and a few more minor ones, I still found myself happily suspending disbelief and enjoying the ride.

5220090,4,B0090SI4HO,"Arnold Achwarzenegger stars in this thrilling 'THE LAST STAND' movie, a film which is true to 'Schwarzenegger Style', is packed with fast paced action and adventure. As a semi-retired LAPD Officer from the Narcotics Division, now... in a small time, 3 police car town called Sommerset which is the boundary line between the United States and Mexico, he assumes the role of Sheriff Ray Owens. All is calm until one of the local farmers is found dead. With his suspicions aroused and a call from the FBI, puts him on the confrontational path of a third generation, prideful, spoiled-rotten, drug king pin - Gabriel Cortez, who intends on crossing the Mexican border through U.S. Sommerset territory, in hopes of evading a rightful arrest by the FBI. As a master race car driver, Cortez eludes the FBI only to run smack into the no nonsense, no backing down, all or nothing Sheriff, Ray Owens. The two of them face off in a climactic test of wills and strength, in this all encompassing shoot-out, action drama, that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat with your eyes riveted to the screen. You won't be bored watching this movie... Nina Kish",1422230400,,1150,4.72636815920398

This movie was classic Arnie!  LOVED it!!  I thought this particular movie was perfect for him to play at this point in his life. I loved the plot, I loved the supporting cast, I just loved the whole story.  I've watched it several times now and it's a just a fun time every time!

5220151,4,B0090SI4HO,"Not a bad movie, it was a great way to spend a quiet Monday night! Arnold isn't as fast as he used to be and you can tell they choreograph the fight scenes with that in mind. But it was a solid story. The beginning is really slow but if you can make it past the first 25 minutes it picks up quite dramatically! Johnny Knoxville provides the right amount of comic relief without going over the top which you need in a movie like this where people are dying left and right. I have nothing bad to say about this. My favorite scene was the lamp post one, where Johnny character's tries to knock it down. Full of laughs!

I will say Forrest Whitaker doesn't really add anything to the movie. His character is always one step behind. But Arnold is the man and it was good to see him on screen again. Good movie.",1421020800,,805,4.160256410256411

5220199,5,B0090SI4HO,"I really loved this movie. My 22 year old son said it didn't do very well at the box office; maybe it was because Arnold had been out of the movies for eight years. This movie must have been one of the first movies; he did after being California Governor. Personally, I voted for him. Maybe it was his divorce; who cares! No one is perfect in this world; we all sin. That said: Arnold plays a sheriff, like no other. Luis Guzmn, plays a latin deputy. Forest Whitaker plays agent, trying to capture a criminal. There was a character, who stocked up all kinds of weapons; he was funny and he named his guns. I thought their was enough action, to kept me going through the entire movie. I liked the car race between the two cars. I didn't like the FBI female Agent in the car with the wanted criminal. PLEASE! What happen to average-looking or plain authority women on the job? I liked the scene in the diner with those old people. Old people can be so funny! We like the funny lines that Arnold Schwarzenegger says, in his movies.
No sex, no nudity - is a big plus. I would definitely recommend this movie and Escape Plan (movie). If you are a true fan, like me, you will love this movie, too. I seen it several times!",1420675200,3,1216,4.268398268398268

5220885,5,B0090SI4HO,"Well, he was right.  He did come back.  And it is with a sort of new character that still epitomizes what we expect of Arnold, The Last Great Action Hero!  This time out he is trying to while away his retirement in a sort of sleepy little border town where the biggest danger is eating the overstuffed omelets at the local diner!  He has a rather sardonic Deputy, another deputy that is easy on the eyes, and a young rookie.  None of these folks are prepared for a no-holds-barred invasion of their territory by a gang of mercenaries trying to get a drug kingpin back into Mexico.  They're doing it the hard way: they've bought their own bridge with them!  Without giving too much away, I would just like to say that Forrest Whitaker's character of an FBI Agent has set that agency back about 30 years.  The so-called brilliant plan the drug lord uses to escape from the FBI's custody is nothing short of silly, and the reaction of said Whitaker's character warrants editing on a major scale.  I know some folks who are past agents and they must have cringed just looking at this part of things.  Did I mention the 200+ MPH Corvette this guy's henchmen stole for him to drive over the border in?  No?  Well, it doesn't really matter.  The thing isn't all that important until the last part of the film, and given what it goes through before we get anywhere near the end, the fact that it still exists stretches the boundaries of belief!  The humor is wonderful, the local gun-hoarding nut case turns in a great performance, the action is fast and furious, and Arnold really delivers!  ""How you feelin' Sheriff?"" he's asked.  ""Old...""  You may be old Arnold, but you're still loads of fun to watch on the big screen!",1418256000,2,1715,4.498381877022654

The story is about a retired Narcotics LAPD officer that helps a tough small town to fight some crime. But situation becomes dangerous when Gabriel Cortez,a notorious drug lord escapes from the FBI.Their new mission is to stop the dangerous criminal from escaping to Mexico.

Kim Jee-woon handles actions sequences very well as they are stylish and definitely will provide lots of entertainment to action film fans. But with regards to Schwarzenegger,he becomes less credible and realistic as an action hero and the film somehow takes a fall from it. Despite the fact that he can still do well as a physical actor,his ability to have that action figure persona that drove millions of fans into watching his films definitely is lacking in his comeback. Too bad that we are simply treated to high testosterone action film elements and nothing more as there is nothing new in it.",1416614400,,1094,4.908108108108108

Watched this solo late at night because it was free and I thought it was a remake of Walking Tall (1973, starring Joe Don Baker), which, of course, it is not. That would be Walking Tall (2004, starring Dwayne Johnson). Similar, time-tested David and Goliath premise -- small-town sheriff takes on band of criminals. Seems outmatched, but victorious after much carnage.

As with all these movies, it all about the journey. We know Ahhnold will terminate his weak and flabby opponents and that we will like watching him do it. The joy - or expected joy - is in how he gets there: supporting cast, story line, effects. In Last Stand, those elements are, in the immortal words of Randy Jackson, just ok, dawg.

There isn't much I can say about this film that hasn't already been said in other reviews about this movie.  There are some things that I could call right at the beginning of the movie.  Right away I knew that the mayor's car was going to get trashed and I also knew that the big revolver was going to get some use in the big battle at the end of the movie that we all knew was coming.  I also could call that the female agent in the drug dealer's car was helping him escape.

5221836,2,B0090SI4HO,"It's a typical (bad) action movie.  A small podunk town turns into a small war zone thanks to a drug lord and his buddies.  But what do you know?  This little podunk town happens to have the terminator as their sheriff!!  So basically, you've seen this movie before many times...

They also try to sprinkle some comedy around which just makes things so much more awkward and frustrating.

From the beginning of the movie, they try so hard to let you know that this is a sleepy town full of sleepy people doing sleepy things.  Inept cops doing silly stuff because ""it's so slow"" out there.  It's almost like Pixar's Cars with Arnold in it.. with gun fights and car chases...  The cops, the farmer, and the inhabitants... they seem to  exist mainly to push the plot forward with their idiotic small ""town-ness""  So yeah, we get that... they're just ignorant small town folks.. we get it..  Every bad decision that could be made is made.

The bigger problem is that big city FBI boys are almost as dumb and slow as the small town folks.  The most annoying of them all is the arrogant FBI captain barking at everyone despite the fact that he's lost the criminal in the first place and failed at every turn capturing him. ""Oh, they're building a bridge.  The sheriff was right!""

You wonder if the police/FBI academies have any standard procedure manuals and if these characters ever read any of it.  One of the deputies gets killed after being told by Arnold ""Negative, fall back.""  Well, he kept on walking anyways...  Oh, yeah, he didn't know how to handle a gun, either...

Oh, also, next time you transport a super criminal, maybe you should use a chopper straight from the prison to wherever you're taking him!!  Not in a 20 car parade for everyone to see...

Also, what's the gas mileage on a ZR1?

So yeah, it's a frustrating movie all around.. these characters are so frustrating, we actually started to root for the bad guys.",1411171200,,1930,4.562682215743441

5221860,3,B0090SI4HO,"Definitely not impressed with this over the top, Hollywood cluster F. It was basically a lot of shooting, a lot of things blowing up, with an extremely far fetched storyline and absurd visuals and scenes. I wasn't watching this movie with too many expectations, but there's a TON of 4 and 5 star reviews and I can't see how.

Call me crazy, but I walked away from this movie with nothing. I know (only from this movie now) that 50 caliber shots to the shoulder are just uncomfortable. I know that a knife wound to the leg (both technically, hands, and a deep puncture) is easily walked off. That a body flies through the air when shot off of a tractor and leaves barely any wound. That puns and one liners are still in style.

I was not impressed. I know it's not supposed to be realistic... but it was so absurdly over the top with the cliches, the bad acting, and horrible plot line... that I was literally in pain after watching it. That's not to say I didn't laugh a few different times throughout.

Was it worth watching? I guess. I had to sit on a desk for work... and stare at a phone that didn't ring. So... it was worthwhile then. But if I had to take my own personal free time and watch this... I would have been extremely upset. If I had to buy this movie, or pay for a ticket in the theater... I would have lost my mind.

For entertainment value knowing it's a mess of a Hollywood production... I give it three stars. Any more than that, is absolutely criminal.",1411084800,,1473,4.287769784172662

5221889,4,B0090SI4HO,"I have been a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger since his Conan movies. Lately, Other than some cameo roles, he has not made any feature role movies.  When this one came out (The Last Stand) I intended to see it at the movie theater even though it did not get good reviews; however, it quickly was pulled and I forgot about it.

When this DVD came out I decided to purchase it.  I did not expect much when I viewed this DVD but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this film.  Besides Arnold, Forest Whitaker was the co-star along with many other good actors. The movie began a little slowly, but quickly became an action packed movie with lots of real bad guys, fights and shoot-outs.  In order for any action movie to be good there must be conflict and vicious adversaries.  This movie has everything you would want in an action film.

Yes, it is true that Arnold is looking a lot older but in my opinion he still has that believable movie presence as a big tough guy out for justice. As an old guy myself I appreciate old Arnold still making action films. I don't know why this movie did not become more popular but I liked it and will view it again in the future.

A REAL SPEEDING CAR!
Realistic blood splatters, waiting for the CSI gang to pop up and mop up the carnage.
Maybe a little ""over the top"", and I hope the FBI and others watch these movies for ""IDEAS"" to avoid these situations.
Maybe the reason officers should NOT just be 2 in a car,  but the next 2 backups should be there around the corner, even in the BIG City.
Possibly good training for all officers, situational ethics - if they got a gun and shooting, shoot back to kill.

5223121,2,B0090SI4HO,It's an okay movie if you're bored. Acting is bad and story is bad. Skip unless bored out of your mind.,1405468800,,103,3.9523809523809526

5223127,3,B0090SI4HO,"Old Arnie not trying to be young again and having a few self directed laughs, funny to hear his Austrian accent in a Tex-Mex border town but there you go, suspend reality for a little while. Good surrounding cast, predictable story arc but you don't click play on this without knowing that.  Better than I expected which wasn't award winning entertainment.",1405382400,,356,4.836065573770492

5223200,5,B0090SI4HO,"I first watched this movie on Netflix and really enjoyed it.  Yes there is a lot of typical Arnold stuff throughout the movie, not to be discouraged because the supporting cast is very good.  There is a lot of action and a descent story.  Arnold retires from the LA police force and takes on the job of a small town Marshal only to find out there is an escaped ruthless drug lord headed for his town.  Arnold and his crew of misfits plan to make a stand to hold off the menace while the feds try to get to him for help, that's the basic story.  I recommend this movie because it is fast paced and entertaining, set back your popcorn and have a good time.",1405296000,,654,4.158730158730159

5223203,2,B0090SI4HO,Arnold's character is far too relaxed. And then the action involving the escaped convict is extremely dubious and contrived. Where was the helicopter coverage during the breakout? We can hear helicopters whizzing overhead ... five minutes later!!,1405209600,,246,5.675675675675675
