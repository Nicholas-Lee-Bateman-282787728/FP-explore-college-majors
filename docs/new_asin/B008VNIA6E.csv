8531075,2,B008VNIA6E,more a history lesson than a tour of the building. disappointing.,1434240000,2,65,5.0
8531076,2,B008VNIA6E,"more about the history of spain at the time of Philip II.  Very little about who, how, when and where the Escorial was built.  Learned more about it reading Wikipedia.  Very disappointed.",1412380800,5,187,4.78125
8531077,2,B008VNIA6E,"There's some nice footage of the Escorial here, but I was hoping for more information on the architecture, the workers who built it, what happened to the monastery in subsequent centuries, how it became a tourist destination, etc.  Instead I got a lot of theological history, which would turn off viewers who don't care about Roman Catholic beliefs.  I would have appreciated more video of the building itself, and less propaganda.",1410739200,4,431,5.056338028169014

8531079,2,B008VNIA6E,"I have visited El Escorial twice, once with a tour group, and I was really looking forward to seeing an in depth view of the amazing structure and its contents.  Instead, this is a didactic tutorial about Catholic beliefs, the reformation, and the Counter-Reformation efforts of Phillip II, while wandering to sites such as Toledo and Avila as well as others.  Most of the shots of El Escorial were from above, and many of those taken inside were poorly lit. For me, it was too much cultural history and not nearly enough information about the building and its environs.  The makers of this disappointing tutorial did not even show the magnificent library or the alabaster masoleums (""The Pantheon of the Princes""), nor did they focus on the art which is located at El Escorial.  Instead, we are shown works such as El Greco's ""The Burial of the Count of Orgaz"" which is located at the church of Santo Tome in Toledo, Spain.  As a broad cultural history of the time (but with too little about the featured place itself), it is fine, but if you want to see El Escorial and its contents, look elsewhere.",1371686400,8,1101,4.625641025641026
