5717031,5,B00CDV4NTS,Another awesome season to one piece. Really enjoying the Ennies Lobby arc a ton and a bunch of great action in this box set.,1376265600,,124,4.208333333333333
5717032,5,B00CDV4NTS,"This is so far the best set I've bought and the cheapest, totally worth it I highly recommend it !",1375747200,,98,3.95
5717033,5,B00CDV4NTS,"The Enies Lobby Arc is finally getting dubbed and Funimation shows why it's one of the best companies to dub anime. The episodes go from the start of the invasion to the first part of Robin's backstory. All of the voices are done great for the most part (only one I didn't like was Oimo). The lines are not exactly the same as the Japanese version, but they don't detract from the plot and they can even make it funnier at times. The only thing that I didn't like was that the subtitles were for the Japanese audio only and there weren't any for the English version along with dubbing unnecessary parts like a sweepstakes that was only available in Japan. All in all, this is a great dub that is glorious to see in HD and should be watched by anyone who calls themselves a fan of One Piece.",1374883200,3,790,4.273333333333333
5717034,5,B00CDV4NTS,12 episodes and it's worth it lots of action and finally getting into some of the best arcs in the series.,1374883200,,106,4.095238095238095
5717035,5,B00CDV4NTS,Ok the straw hats have gotten a lot tougher through the alabasta and skipiea arcs. This arc Enies lobby will take the fights even further. Luffy mastered his basic devil fruit powers in alabasta. He goes to much higher gears letteraly in this one. The other straw hats do as well. From here on out it will be direct manga story. All action and story progression. In my opinion best arc of them all.  After this arc goes right into the thriller bark arc. This is amust buy for one piece fans and newcomers don't miss your chance!!!!!!,1374278400,,533,4.438775510204081

5717045,5,B00CDV4NTS,"We are one more dvd away from the new world arc!! I only have the thriller bark arc yet it still delivers. This is an awesome Shonen jump series. Next to my other favorites such as Blue Exorcist, Twin Star Exorcist, One Punch Man, Naruto, and Fullmetal Alchemists this a good yet super long story.",1475107200,5,297,4.418181818181818
5717046,4,B00CDV4NTS,"Only a month's wait between Voyage 4 and Voyage 5.  Sweet!

As we return to the present time after a (mostly) joyous romp through Luffy and Ace's childhood, Luffy overcomes his grief at the loss of Ace and realizes that he must send a message to his crewmates (and the world) before disappearing for 2 years to make himself stronger for the New World.  Over these final 12 episodes of what I believe to be the first half of the series we check up on just about everybody that Luffy encountered during his journey so far.  The 9 Supernovas (besides Luffy and Zoro) as well as a few other familiar faces embark on their own adventures in the New World.  The aftermath of the War of the Best precipitates a shakeup in the World Government as Sengoku and Garp retire from the Marines and several vacancies appear in the Shichibukai.  Most of all we check up on all 9 of the Straw Hat Pirates as they find ways to occupy themselves for the next 2 years.  Zoro and Sanji (and less directly, Robin) establish new relationships with familiar characters while all of the Straw Hats find ways to improve themselves.  The Voyage ends with Luffy traveling to a secluded island with Silvers Rayleigh to learn how to use the ""haki"" that is already strong in him.

And with that Season 8 concludes before the end of calendar year 2016.  With an excellent chance that Season 9 will wrap up before the end of 2017.",1474416000,10,1397,4.464566929133858

5717064,5,B00CDV4NTS,"Hey Folks,

Another great voyage put by Mike and the entire staff. The dvd starts us off after the CP9 defeat and the funeral of the Going Merry.  The straw hat crew remains in Water 7 planning and re-grouping for their next adventure. We see several special guest throughout the dvd. One gives us a much needed glimpse into Luffy's background.  The other one foreshadows a upcoming event that might have everlasting repercussions. There are a few fillers episodes but very entertaining and insightful.  If you are following or/but haven't seen it this dvd will continue the one piece tradition. If you have seen it before the dvd just takes you on a similar journey the original did. I loved the voices and there a looking how the studio records the voices. Hopefully the reviews haven't spoiled once for you. Go out and pick up a copy today. Please continue to support One Piece here and the hard and authentic work they put into it. Thank you

Sincerely, (just another huge fan) Elizar Garrett",1392508800,,996,4.7011494252873565

5717071,5,B00CDV4NTS,A great start to the fight to save Robin. This will be one part of the series you don't want to miss.,1383264000,,101,3.6363636363636362

5717074,4,B00CDV4NTS,"Continuing from where season four left off, the Straw Hats, Franky Family and Galley La shipwrights regroup and begin their rescue mission of Robin and Franky and their apparently hopeless attack on CP9. Once again this set follows the group fight an onslaught of mostly generic nameless marines in order to open the gates of Enies Loby. While many of the marine groups have unique quirks, they just aren't memorable at all compared to previous villains or even the marine groups in the last Voyage. Oddly, we see more of the group fighting the generic marines than we do of the much more creatively unique one-scene characters introduced here, with most of the fights being repetitive scenes of the Straw Hats sending masses of marines flying with (apparently) no real challenge. The most unique villain introduced here is the bizarre chief justice Baskerville, but he doesn't get any proper fight scenes this Voyage. The only noteworthy fight is the battle with the giants Kashi and Oimo, which includes a nice callback to a previous storyline and manages to get a few good laughs in, as well as being an appropriately impossible obstacle to face for the supposedly inpenatarable Enies Lobby. These fights verge on tedious because of the pacing of these episodes, which are padded out by up to six minutes of recaps. It's not that the sequences themselves are slowly paced, but you essentially don't get as much new material as you would expect for 12 episodes, with most episodes revolving around (and padding out) just one key moment. It doesn't help that these DVDs don't include a chapter at the end of the recaps!

The action picks up on when Luffy challenges Blueno at the opening of disc two and introduces Luffy's new fighting style: second gear. This fight begins to deliver what we've all been waiting for as the confrontation with CP9 becomes significantly less one sided, and Luffy's second gear adds an exciting new element to his fighting that seems plausible but unexpected given his well-established abilities. Of course, this also whets the appetite for the even more surprising and action-packed fights that the arc has to offer in later sets. This Voyage also introduces a new trio of CP9 members, but only their funny quirks are introduces and CP9 spends most of this set talking rather then fighting. The Voyage concludes the first episode of Robin's flashback, but as the first of four episodes this is essentially all set up, with the real story tantalisingly kicking in just as the final episode reaches its cliffhanger.

The audio and video are the same as the previous season, offering the equally excellent English and Japanese versions in 5.1 and stereo respectively along with English subtitles for the Japanese version. Extras include some chatty (and mostly off-topic) US commentaries on episode 265 with Mike McFarland (ADR director), Colleen Clinkenbeard (Luffy), Alexis Tipton (Fukuro) and Phil Parsons (Jabra) and on episode 275 with Mike McFarland, Eric Vale (Sanji) and Brina Palencia (Chopper). The 'On The Boat' interviews are slightly funnier this time, featuring Patrick Seitz (Franky) [14:34] and Sonny Strait Strait (Usopp) [14:19]. And Finally there is the usual textless opening and closing (with the original logo), Marathon Play to skip the intervening credits, and trailers for other FUNimation DVDs.

While this Voyage mostly includes generic and forgettable fights, and is almost entirely set-up for the more exciting later episodes of the arc, thanks to the Luffy vs Blueno fight there is enough in this voyage to make it enjoyable and exciting on the whole, and the last few episodes really build up the hype for the upcoming voyages.",1378339200,,3688,5.0426229508196725
