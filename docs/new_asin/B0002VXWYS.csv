8033460,5,B0002VXWYS,I have turned into a Lawrence fan since Mr Welk died.  I was in my twenties when I married and my husband and I would visit my in-laws on Satuday evening.  They were always watching Lawrence Welk.  Since my husband died in 2000 I would catch the show here and there on Saturday evening.  Was surprised to see it was still on.  Started checking the internet and found I could still purchase some of the old VHS tapes.  Brings back a lot of old memories.  The tapes are like new and the color is great.  Thanks for the memories!,1357776000,,526,4.242424242424242
