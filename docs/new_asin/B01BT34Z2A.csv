If you go to the movies and just watch people acting you'll never feel the connection, However, if you look at both characters, understand what they are going through, you feel the connection; it was powerful enough for me to say I enjoyed this movie very much. Letting loose isn't so easy in this world when everyone always cares what others think first before themselves. .",1467763200,,418,4.819444444444445
8751341,2,B01BT34Z2A,"Some liked this movie, I guess. I didn't like it. It was once again great actors in a movie that just gave them no chance to shine. You could almost feel their chargrin in trying to pull off their roles. The writer / director was trying to be unique and artistic, but from the very beginning it just left me cold. There were some nicer scenes in Europe between them, but even that somehow didn't take. I could recommend movies with these actors which would get into your all time favorites list, but not this one, for me at least.",1465603200,,530,4.31
