6452149,5,B00KW85PFK,"Loved watching Foyle's war on pbs with closed caption (cc). Do Foyle's war bundle pack have cc or subtitled for deaf and hard of hearing (sdh)? If so, then I would order it for sure.",1425427200,,182,4.228571428571429
6452150,5,B00KW85PFK,"Foyle is a Police Detective in England.
From the beginning of WW2 he is solving murder mysteries as his country changes radically.
I have always been in awe of the bravery of the English in those times.  They 'carried on.'
I began watching the British mysteries, liked the main characters very much (their lives change and unfold as the episodes continue). WW2 stories that I feel are very accurate are occurring around him. The British settings, homes and living styles are so accurate for those times.
Michael Kitchen, superb as Foyle seems to be the conduit for the emotions and opinions pro and con about happenings as they unfolded.
I recommend this series highly. They drew me in, broke my heart sometimes and taught me things I never knew about the war in England. .
I watched them on Netflix one by one, and will watch them all again because I am going to order this set on DVD.",1423094400,3,886,4.572327044025157

6452152,5,B00KW85PFK,"Foyle's War is addictive It's a great who-dunnit series that's well-acted with drama and a bit of British dry humor. It's also a historically accurate commentary on what was happening in England on the home-front during WWII. The costumes and sets are expertly done. You'll become quite attached to the main characters. As for me, I'm rationing each episode for myself in this complete set like a bottle of good Brandy.",1420502400,3,419,4.915492957746479

6452154,5,B00KW85PFK,"We quickly became addicted to this BBC TV series.  It quickly became our favorite movie-watching.  In addition to being highly entertaining, it is very educational as well.  Set during WWII in the south of England, the series is soaked in the culture of Great Britain at that time.  Everything-- the writing, the acting, the production--is top notch.  Michael Kitchen (Foyle) is astonishing.  We love having the whole series so we can see it again and again.

8662116,1,B00KW85PFK,"Great show, horrible work on producing the disks.  Many skip, drag, pixilate and literally stop.  It is very frustrating to spend so much money and get so excited about watching Foyle whenever I want only to get crappy disks that don't work.  I tried other disks in the player and the disks in other players - it is the disks.  One would have been tolerable but probably one in ea. set had a problem that made it difficult, if not impossible to watch.  Good luck",1441411200,,462,4.3882352941176475
8662117,5,B00KW85PFK,"I love ""Midsomer Murders""; however, there is no series like ""Foyle's War"". Perhaps because I am just such a history buff, I enjoy the historical aspects that surround each plot, it being after WWII and how England is coping. Enter a WWI soldier, Foyle, and he is so good at what he does that one believes that he really is Foyle! He and John Nettles of ""Midsomer Murders"" should win an Emmy for their performances...they are superb!  The writing in this series, the believable scenery and the great supporting casts make this my #1 pick of all time for mystery/drama series. You can't go wrong buying this; believe me!!",1436313600,,619,4.678899082568807

8662122,5,B00KW85PFK,"we absolutely love it;  I originally bought it for my husband's birthday which is in June
but couldn't wait to give to him as he has watched on Netflix and loves Foyle.  Also
got the new release and the bonus so we are in heaven having our own library of it.
One of the early discs was a little ""sticky"" but we got past it and the rest of the collection
is great.
thank you.
