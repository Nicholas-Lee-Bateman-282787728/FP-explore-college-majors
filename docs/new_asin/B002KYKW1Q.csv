3945182,5,B002KYKW1Q,"Susan's workout's are intense, interesting and absoultely push me to my physical peak. At the same time, the workouts are easily modified for those who are just starting or need a lighter routine. The shuffle feature is so fun and the music is great!",1256342400,,250,4.704545454545454
3945183,5,B002KYKW1Q,"As someone who just recently had a baby and was in great need of getting back into shape, I strongly recommend this workout DVD!  I have been lucky enough to actually work out with Susan as my personal trainer.  She is fun, knows what she is talking about, brings lots of energy, and pushes you to your full potential.  The video highlights all of her intense but doable exercises in a fun yet challenging way.  You don't feel like you have just wasted your time after completing the workout, which I've found happens with most workout DVDs.  If you can't workout with Susan as your trainer, the DVD is the next best thing! I strongly recommend it!",1256169600,,648,4.504273504273504
3945184,5,B002KYKW1Q,"This is an awesome workout!!  If you want to feel accomplished, good about yourself, and tired from a great all-around workout that is NOT boring, check out Susan. She used many modalities of exercise including elements of pilates, ballet, and aerobics. I cannot stress enough that this is a great and balanced form of exercise. Try it - you'll love it!",1256169600,,353,4.786885245901639
3945185,5,B002KYKW1Q,"This DVD is awesome! I'll admit, I've bought many a workout tape in my life, and this is by far the best. One perk is it actually contains the original music - which is all fun and upbeat! So many workout tapes have generic songs or cheesy re-recorded ones. So that's definitely great. Also, the workouts themselves are fun! Susan's a great motivator, the perfect personal trainer you'd want! There's no intimidation or anything which is another plus. While the workouts are definitely tough, they're not exhausting so it's no problem to use the DVD on a daily basis. There's no burn out. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who's a fan of Susan Hyatt's music or just wants a new workout DVD to change up their routine!",1256083200,,722,4.604651162790698
3945186,5,B002KYKW1Q,"The Susan Hyatt Rockstar Workout DVD ROCKS!  I work out 4-5 days a week and like to mix up my routine with workout dvds.  I have to say, with all of the various dvds that I have tried, this far surpasses them all!!  It's challenging, yet VERY doable, and Susan is NOT annoying in her delivery.  I find most of the trainers in workout dvds to be quite annoying.  There is ZERO annoyance factor with this one.  She is very clear with her directions, and gives great demonstrations.  On top of it, you can set the dvd to shuffle the workouts, which mixes up the order of the exercises.  I have to say, that since I started using this workout dvd, I have seen amazing results.  My butt and thighs are firmer, abs more sculpted, and my arms/shoulders are much more toned.  I definitely feel like my body looks longer and leaner!  The music, which Susan Hyatt wrote and sings, is AWESOME!  It definitely gets you pumped up and motivated to burn calories, up to 800!!!  Finally, the pop ups are a clever and fun reminder to keep you focused and on track!!!

Overall rating:  A+++",1255651200,2,1072,4.3979591836734695

Susan Hyatts has zero ability as an instructor

8372289,1,B002KYKW1Q,"I have dozens of dvd workouts, and this is among the worst.  I was expecting an exiciting workout from a ""rockstar"".  She has no personality, and the moves are totally boring -- nothing original or fun.  The production looks as if it were done by kids in middle school.  Will donate to Goodwill -- not recommended.",1289952000,2,314,4.553571428571429
8372290,3,B002KYKW1Q,"She might not be the best choice for a workout video, but the short work out truly makes you sweat. Plus you feel your muscles really working. Susan Hyatt also says what you're thinking, and truly motivates you. Yes, it's not as polished as other workout videos, but it gets you're  heart pumping!",1265155200,,297,4.60377358490566
8372291,5,B002KYKW1Q,"While I have never been one to enjoy traditional training techniques, I had the privilege of receiving personal training from Susan a while back and I can guarantee that her workout is great, fun and effective! I love the fact that she constantly changes it up, so I don't get bored and that she uses different types of cardio, stretching & toning exercises for almost instant results. Her non-traditional approach is refreshing and I highly recommend her DVD!!",1261526400,,461,4.923076923076923
8372292,5,B002KYKW1Q,I am so impressed with this DVD! The unique concepts are fantastic and I can feel the fat burning off me every time I work out to this never boring DVD. Highly recommended! Love the music too!,1260403200,,192,4.216216216216216
8372293,5,B002KYKW1Q,I love this workout!  It's intense but fun too!  Just what I need!  After a month of sweating it out like a Rockstar I'm starting to see results!,1260403200,,145,4.107142857142857
8372294,1,B002KYKW1Q,"This dvd was so amateur! Can't believe they produced this for everyone!!  She doesn't even transition , just jumped from one workout to another.",1259020800,4,144,5.0
8372295,5,B002KYKW1Q,"As a devoted attendee of hardcore classes at my gym, I'm always a bit leery of workout videos and all the promises that are made, as they usually don't deliver. This DVD totally proved me wrong! Susan mixes things up in a way that flows effortlessly, yet is never boring or repetitive. The shuffle feature is a fun way to get a mixed up and totally different routine every time, and the ability to easily modify any of the moves to be made more or less challenging is also a huge plus. There is something for everyone: jump rope, yoga, pilates, ballet, kettle ball and even kickboxing (my personal fave). All of those are mixed together with a killer soundtrack that is sure to get your butt moving! I wear a heart rate monitor while working out to the video so I can keep my heart rate up and see the calories burning off! I have found that my calorie burning is almost identical to what I achieve during a kickbox class. Not a lot of space to space to work out in? Not to worry, as the moves are done in a way that don't require a huge amount of space. Best of all, you can complete the workout in 25 minutes. It usually takes me that long just to drive to the gym and find a place to park!",1258329600,,1192,4.1645021645021645
8372296,5,B002KYKW1Q,"I had never heard of Susan Hyatt but I ordered this DVD hoping for something more fun than traditional workout fare. Series like the Firm tend to be a bit drab. Even Jillian Michaels' DVDs are very repetitive and a bit boring albeit difficult. This dvd is divided into beginner and intermediate sections...each section is 20 minutes. I was disappointed because I wanted 2 intermediate chapters but this changed when I did the beginner section. Both are very challenging!

I applaud Susan for creating a DVD with variety and lots of creativity. There's jumping rope, funky pilates moves and lots of cardio bursts/dance-esque moves full of energy.

I hope more DVD instructors follow Susan's lead and create more interesting videos, more interesting scenery and have more variety! It keeps exercising fun and not as dread-inducing.",1257724800,5,829,5.133333333333334
8372297,5,B002KYKW1Q,"I love this DVD!  Whether I have twenty minutes or forty-five, I always feel like it's worthwhile to take the time for a workout.  Susan keeps you moving and the time actually passes quickly.  I also like her personality.  Not to cheesy or perky, just positive and encouraging.",1257465600,3,277,4.708333333333333
