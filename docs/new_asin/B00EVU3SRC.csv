5948567,4,B00EVU3SRC,"""The Attack"" (2013 release from Lebanon; 102 min.) brings the story of Amin (play by Ali Suliman), a successful Arab-Israeli surgeon who is about to receive the highest honor any doctor can receive in Israel for his professional accomplishments. His wife Siham (played by Reymond Amsalem), also Arab, is not with him, though. The next day a suicide bomber in Tel Aviv kills 17 people, including 11 children, and severely wounds scores more, when setting off explosives in a restaurant. Many of them end up in Amin's hospital and he tries all he can to save lives. Later that night, he is called back to the hospital. It turns out Siham was killed in the attack and all signs point to her being the suicide bomber. Amin simply refuses to believe it when pressed by the Israeli police. At this point we're only 25-30 min. into the movie. Was Siham a terrorist? Is Amin being set up by the Israeli police? Could Amin possibly have completely misread his wife? To tell you more would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, the movie is based on the 2007 book of the same name by Algerian author Yasmina Khadra. I haven't read the book so I cannot comment on how this compares to the book. Second, many people are unaware that Arab-Israelis make up about 20 percent of Israel's population, and are often very torn in their feelings for their country (Israel) and their spiritual brothers and at times roots in Palestine and other Arab areas. Third, the movie does an excellent job exposing those tormented feelings of Amin as he is on a path to find out what really happened leading up to the attack. As one point Amin is upset with everyone and everything and one of his Jewish friends offers ""Don't let grief your spoil your perspective"" but that's of course easier said than done. This movie flew by in no time and had my attention from start to finish. Beware, the hospital scenes where the wounded are treated make for difficult viewing (I closed my eyes a few times). Bottom line: ""The Attack"" is a great addition to the collection of movies looking at the Israeli-Palestine conflict (another recent movie I'd readily recommend on this topic is ""A Bottle In the Gaza Sea""). As such, ""The Attack"" deserves and needs to be seen by both sides. But to give you an idea how absurd things have become, the movie has been banned by all Arab countries, for the ""crime"" of filming part of the movie in Israel. My oh my.

I saw this movie in early July at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, and I'm happy to say that the screening where I saw this at, was very nicely attended, giving me hope that there is a strong demand for this movie, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray. If you are in the mood for compelling movie that adds to the debate on the Israeli-Palestine conflict, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The Attack"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1378339200,16,2934,4.565464895635674
5948568,2,B00EVU3SRC,Read the book first. 30 minutes before the movie ends I wondering how they are going to wrap up it the way the story goes. Well they didn't bother to do that. Instead they change the tone of the story. Although there is a similarity in the guilt feeling in the film to the novel it comes off in the film as though it is his fault. I also didn't appreciate how they changed his relationship with the other doctor. They minimized her role and trivialized their relationship. She was a crucial character. Really hated the whole video thing and how he gets into that argument in the end with the doctor.,1449446400,,599,4.357142857142857

5948580,5,B00EVU3SRC,"Brilliantly done!  Excellent soundtrack and acting from unknown (to me) actors.  My takeaway from watching this so very sad film is that hatred and violence never accomplish anything.  And I mean this for both sides of the conflict.  One can only hope that there will be a sea change in the hearts and minds of Israelis and Palestinians, each of whom have their own point of view.  What is heartbreaking is that this probably won't happen any day soon.  Or maybe, like the Berlin wall, the hatred and discontent will simply vanish one day.",1418342400,,539,4.680851063829787

5948586,4,B00EVU3SRC,"This is a movie about an Arab-Israeli doctor who lives and works in Tel Aviv. One day his wife doesn't come home and she is suspected of having carried out a suicide bombing. Most of the movie is about the doctor trying to find out the truth. He also has to deal with issues of being an Arab working and living in Israeli society. The acting is pretty good in this movie. Ali Suliman is a fairly well-known and accomplished actor who always does a good job with his parts. While this is a somewhat new take on Israeli-Palestinian relations as far as movies go, for me, the movie lacked a bit of spark. It was somewhat muted at times and it didn't seem like there was a necessarily a lot of character development beyond the main character.

5948594,5,B00EVU3SRC,"This is an excellent film though I believe some people who watch it are not yet ready to absorb it or appreciate it. Due to a lot of symbolism in it, people may walk out of it the first time they see it feeling it slightly sides (51% on the Israeli side) rather than depicts the much more horrendous suffering of the Palestinian people in general and of Palestinian children in particular. In that context, it is true, it doesn't give a compelling reason why she committed the suicide attack. However, if one were to watch the film more than once, the depth and symbolism becomes much more apparent. The film makes the husband rather than the wife the hero and his internal struggle into understanding why she committed the act. Without giving away the last part of the film away, once we understand what is in the video film and how the husband reacts to his Israeli friend's question: did you find out who was behind it, we understand his position and the position, his understanding (though not justification) of Arab Israeli who are caught in the mist of this very complex conflict. I show this film to my students at the university and it surely holds them focused for the entire period.",1396396800,2,1192,4.574766355140187
5948595,4,B00EVU3SRC,"Amin Jaafari (Ali Suliman) is in an unusual place.  He is a rare Arab who has found a place for himself and his wife, Siham (Reymond Amsalem) in Tel Aviv.  Amin is a renowned surgeon in one of Israel's most prestigious hospitals.  On the day he receives one of medicine's highest honors, a Palestinian suicide-bomber kills 17 people in a restaurant, most of which are kids at a birthday party.  Hours later, Amin is called back to the hospital to identify a body, believed to be his wife.  It is and she is suspected of being the bomber, not another victim.

Early on, Amin is treated poorly by the police, suspected of being aware, if not involved, in the terrorism.  Eventually cleared, he is released but is scorned by his neighbors and others.  A few friends remain loyal, but Amin cannot believe that after 15 years of marriage, he was unaware of his wife's intentions.  This confusion and uncertainty leads him on a detective-like mission to find out how this could have happened.  It leads him back to a small town in the Palestinian Territory where he gets closer and closer to the answers he seeks but perhaps doesn't want to hear.

The film directed and co-written by Lebanese native Ziad Doueiri is often hard to watch and even hard to imagine but we all know, events like this are real.  Doueiri manages to keep a somewhat balanced perspective, but the killing of children is hard to balance in my mind.  From Doueir's perspective, while he never condones the particular act, he never goes back to the victims either.  In any case the film certainly doesn't give us hope that there will ever be a solution to this Middle East conflict given the festering hatred between the sides.

The Blu ray transfer comes in 1080p and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Detail is excellent.  The colors are honest but don't stand out as filming is often done in low light.  The exteriors are in dusty browns and grey, perhaps consistent with the geography.  Skin tones are very good.  Excellent video presentation.  The audio comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option.  The film is surprisingly a very quiet affair outside a few scenes at the hospital.  Even as Amion travels to the Palestinian territory, events are rather subdued.  No yelling and screaming here.  Perhaps Doueiri does have a bias.  In any case the dialog heavy film is clear and well-focused.  Not much goes on in the surrounds, not even Eric Neveux's fine score.  Extras are minimal.  A 4  minute interview with Doueiri, a trailer and some photos.  Subtitles come in English only.",1396310400,,2540,4.691609977324263

5948602,4,B00EVU3SRC,"This movie was very intriguing.  It was never preachy while still showing a very nuanced view of he Israeli - Palestinian conflict.  While I certainly didn't change my personal belief that the Palestinians are nothing more than a gang of angry, hate-spewing clansman who would murder a thousand innocents to kill one Israeli soldier - I began to see the complexity (or possibly, the futility) in trying to stop the pent-up vitriol from being passed from generation to generation.  Hopefully, the premise is wrong and a charismatic, sane leader will emerge from the garbage heaps of Gaza and the West Bank and imbue the masses with some sanity. Maybe then they can move ahead and create a better future for the next generation.

5948605,2,B00EVU3SRC,"Incredibly, financed by Jews, helmed by an excellent Lebanese Christian director, one wonders instead of making a film about the Palestinian murderers of tens upon tens of thousands of Maronite Christians in Lebanon between 1970 & 1990 nearly exterminating the entire Christian community if it were not for the IDF's intervention, since the 1980's murderers of thousands of Israeli civilians, including the slitting the throats of babies, and stabbing top death a mother of six in front of her small children, and recently caused the amputation of a leg of a one year old baby, why this talented director would make this false, cunning and insidious pro-Palestinian propaganda that seeks to justify their murder and maiming of Israeli civilians including children? Why cunning?

Here's the emotional story of a successful Palestinian (Israeli-Arab) doctor working at a Tel Aviv, Israel hospital who discovers that his Christian-Palestinian wife carried out a suicide bombing in a restaurant that murdered 17 civilians, 11 of whom are children, leaving 8 maimed for life. Arrested & interrogated, the Israeli cops release him once they supposedly cleared him of suspicion that he knew his wife was a terrorist (one of the big holes in the script). Convinced she's not the bomber, he gets his wake up call when he receives a letter from his wife sent from Nablus, a West Bank city which makes him realize that his wife indeed was the suicide bomber. Upset, he decides to investigate how, who, and why she'd do such a dastardly act of murder & maiming of the people he has grown to live among, and especially being married to him - a prosperous loving husband and doctor who had been able to successfully assimilate into Israeli society, even winning its medical world ""Oscar"" award for his excellent work, bestowing on her the perks of his job, nice house, American Jeep Cherokee, etc.

Seeking answers, he goes to Nablus determined to meet those who convinced her to strap on the suicide explosives belt, making her into a martyr for the cause of liberating and recovering every inch of territory of Palestine as Jews have no claim to it and do not belong there, and neither does anyone else (Christians, hint, hint). Facing danger as he is perceived as a ""collaborator"" perhaps working for Israeli intelligence and therefore persona non-grata, staying at his family's villa with its great view of the city, layer by layer he discovers some of his relatives may be involved, and when he finally meets the Shiek who he believes sent his wife to her martyrdom, he turns out to be a priest who tells him that his people aren't fanatic crazy goons but people fighting for their freedom & dignity, and that his wife was a heroic martyr who acted in revenge for Israeli atrocities vs the Palestinians, in particular a mythical ""massacre"" in Jenin. Doc goes there and finds rubble next to a beautiful high rise apartment building where supposedly the ""massacre"" had occurred, therefore justifying her actions in murdering and maiming Israeli children. He goes back to Tel Aviv chastened and wiser about his heroic wife.

This of course happens near the end, and to anyone not educated with the history of the conflict between the Arabs and Israel, it will create sympathy for the wonderful, peace loving, victimized Palestinians. Matter of fact, there is even a scene of Israeli soldiers abusing such Palestinians at a road block (if anyone had behaved that way trying to obstruct the work of soldiers, for example US troops in Iraq or Afghanistan, or acted the way the Palestinians did in Syria or any other Arab country, they would have been killed immediately). However, as articulated in The Attack, Israelis are obviously held by a different standard. They can be abused, but are not allowed to react because if they did, they would be judged as oppressors. And then there is the ""separation wall' with barbed wire on top making it look ominous, like the Palestinians are imprisoned, yet, Nablus seems prosperous, for certain ain't nobody starving there. Homes are beautiful, streets alive and crowded with shoppers, beautiful city without a sign of an ""occupation"". It's never mentioned that the wall was put up to stop Palestinian murder squads or suicide bombers from entering Israel which is why this star-crossed doctor's wife went to the lengths she did marrying a man who could give her access to blow herself up in a restaurant crowded with mothers & children, a fact that is hinted at but not elaborated, namely: this doctor was merely a tool, a facilitator. Of course it's never mentioned that King Hussein of Jordan's Bedouin army during one weekend in September 1970 killed an estimated 10,000 Palestinians who tried to overthrow his kingdom, a number that Israeli self-defense actions have never, ever reached, including the mythical ""Jenin massacre"". Nor is it mentioned that the IDF invasion of Jenin happened after hundreds of Israeli civilians were murdered and maimed by Arafat's goon squads.

One of the biggest holes in the story...when the doctor drives off from his expensive suburban home in his American Jeep Cherokee, the camera is viewing this from a car behind him, which starts following him. There is no payoff to this as we're never told who is following him, is it the Israeli cop, his nephew? To think that the tough Israeli cop will not tail this doctor is absurd, yet this is left hanging without resolution. Neither is there a payoff to this doctor considered a much despised ""collaborator"" allowed to go about free. He's hated even if his wife gave her life for Palestine. Yet, we've all seen on TV the brutality perpetrated by Palestinian vs suspected collaborators and additionally aside from their genocide against the Maronite Christians in Lebanon, we've seen Palestinians brutally killing each other when HAMAS and PLO fought over Gaza, murdering fathers in front of their wives and children, killing collaborators and dragging their bodies tied behind motorcycles throughout the city (see You Tube). So for this doctor, in all likelihood leading the Israeli cops to the killers, to go free is ridiculous as we're dealing with a mighty smart, brutal bunch of ruthlessly violent people, not the nice ""occupied"" victims we're led to believe they are who in 1929 before they were occupied, slaughtered the entire unarmed Jewish population of Hebron and since 1948 have murdered and maimed thousands of Israeli men, women, teens, children, and even babies whose throats they slit last year (in addition to 100 doctors and nurses they murdered and mutilated when they ambushed an unarmed Jewish medical convoy on its way to Mount Scorpius in Jerusalem in 1948).

What's baffling is while the US makes movies like Lone Survivor about Americans as heroes, most Israeli films are blatantly anti-Israeli and pro-Arab...it's as if the Israeli people in their quest to seem morally superior to the Arabs so busy slaughtering each other in Syria and elsewhere, are intent to help their merciless enemy achieve what they have not been able to achieve by war and terrorism: demonizing Israel with outrageous films, and these short-sighted Jews are digging their own graves, which is why I found this simplistic, utterly cunning Palestinian film so deeply disturbing.

As a film, it's well directed, well acted by a strong cast, beautifully photographed and edited, music is moody and appropriate (why I gave it two stars instead of one) definitely another major victory for the exceedingly effective Palestinian PR machine, this time contributed by an excellent self-righteous Lebanese Christian filmmaker backed by Jewish & French money, supported by Israeli crews and actors who ignore the damage they're inflicting upon the already terrible image of their country.

Israelis may be great warriors fighting with valor on the battlefield, but they are losers with PR, decimated by the biased anti-Israeli US & International media, UN, and films as this one, etc. The Palestinians who have grasped the power of film as a PR tool must be laughing at their smug, self-destructive enemy exploiting their weakness aspiring to live up to their self-proclaimed image as a civilized democratic society. Well, Israel, the Palestinians don't play by your rules, but rather, they use them for furtherance of their one singular powerful objective: your destruction, well articulated when the doctor travels by cab in Nablus listening to a fiery message of a Palestinian leader pronouncing a death sentence for Israel.

I personally believe, (and frankly I care not who agrees or disagrees) The Attack film will appeal to the wealthy, liberal much misplaced so called ""intellectual"" leftist cowardly American, European and Israeli Jewish Palestinian apologists who forgot history; it should appeal greatly to Palestinians, Arabs (even as it was banned in Lebanon guilty of being too liberal in its portrayal of the Israelis & fact that the director dared filming in Israel...), Nazis, other Zionist hating racists both gentile and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish-American Brooklyn based Neturei Karta Israel hating fanatics, and the uneducated in Middle Eastern history gullible general American, anti-Semitic European public looking for - and with this film, successfully justifying Palestinian atrocities against Israeli civilians, children included of course.

In conclusion, The Attack could have been a breakthrough film had its director focused on its true cinematic theme: ""The obsessed with a cause will do anything to achieve their agenda regardless of the pain they inflict not only on their enemy, but their own"". A lost opportunity I'd say, difference between good filmmaking and great.",1390176000,12,9701,5.119318181818182

5948609,4,B00EVU3SRC,"This Lebanese-French-Israeli film is the most even-handed presentation of the excruciating, long-standing detente between Palestinians and Israelis I have yet to see.  I would recommend, perhaps surprisingly, that as many North Americans and Europeans as possible see this work of art, ponder, and discuss it.  We here especially in the United States are simply out of touch with, and don't know enough about, the complexity of this aggravated issue, one that has had far-reaching often devastating effects in not only the Levant but also in all of the Middle Eastern Islamic and Christian world.  The next-to-final scene of a brilliant Palestinian Arab surgeon, favored by the Israeli establishment for his work in securing the health and well-being of its society and finally confronted by a Palestinian Orthodox-Catholic priest, in the glowing, Rembrandtesque ambiance of an historic Christian church in the West Bank is an emotional and artistic masterpiece.  In it, with the stimulus of the gentle, exquisitely articulate priest who draws out this man of science, he comes to terms with himself; what he has perceived to that point as his betrayal by his beautiful Orthodox-Catholic wife, also Palestinian; and, the meaning of the Intifada.  It-- and the entire film-- is almost Biblical in its revelations-- and intimations-- for him personally, and for the greater society of his troubled homeland.  Bravo!

5948614,5,B00EVU3SRC,"This is set in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and concerns a married Arab couple living in Tel Aviv. He is a top surgeon and she is a stay at home wife who one day blows herself up as a suicide bomber (opening of film). The journey he makes as a result emotionally is wrenching. You come to know him really, really well whereas i doubt she is really knowable to anyone.

He represents the rest of us, caught on war's sidelines, wanting to do the right thing yet torn in two on a daily basis. He knows nothing about terrorism because he is a typical top surgeon. He lives to perform surgery all day and night long if necessary. Everything else is tangential. With his wife dead, he is forced to look at his non surgical life.

I was utterly spellbound by this film. I loved this every bit as much as the Irani film THE SEPARATION from a year or so ago. These films are showing me the Middle East like no news show has ever done.

5948618,5,B00EVU3SRC,"God and His Son, the One and Only ""Begotten"" Son, Jesus the Christ, have NOTHING to do whatsoever with mans religions.

 All man made religions have been using Tyndale's collection of compiled scriptures as an excuse to kill in Gods or His Son, Jesus the Christ's Name. In the Torah, in Zephaniah 3:9 it states that God will turn to the people of the world a ""Pure Language"" in the latter days. This was said 610 years by God before He became Yeshuah ha Messiah in Bethlehem. He (God ) chose the name Jesus because ( that name had to be spoke in the English language which at that time didn't exist either ),  evil cannot tolerate the name of Jesus.

 Every time His most Holy Name is spoken if evil is around it (Evil) cannot hold itself still, because of the Power of that name Jesus..

 Then in that same verse God say's He wants us to all praise His Name, (Jesus) in that ""Pure Language"", all in accord and of like mindedness, so in order to do that, God inspired William Tyndale to translate all the collected scriptures from the original languages of Hebrew, Greek and Latin into his English version of scriptures which then in turn became the Alpha Bet, Dictionary and Lexicographical Syntax of the English Language, which in turn eventually became known as the King James Version Bible or England's Great Bible, then thus the English Language became known to the small island nation of England, better known as the British Islands. . As if this wasn't a great enough feat for God, He then inspired William Shakespeare to write his famous Prose literature , Poems, Sonnets and Plays for the template of this ""Pure Language"", and if that don't connote ""Perfection"" in a way that cannot be replicated, I don't know what would myself.

All this killing in the name of an all knowing and Loving, Forgiving and compassionate God has to stop now... it's Satanic... and it must not be aided any longer by those of us who love God with all our hearts... pray to God so He will hear us out of all this craziness... Only pray as He wants us to pray, not like man wants us to... pray ""In Secret!""

 Matthew 6:5-7

5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in SECRET; and thy Father which seeth in SECRET shall reward thee openly.

7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.

Talk to God, not just about Him!

Lets end this stupid murder garbage, its sick behavior that stems from hatred bestowed on us by and through those who don't believe they can talk to God.",1388016000,,2847,4.406488549618321
5948619,4,B00EVU3SRC,Having been to Israel many times this movie has the backdrop of Tel Aviv and made me realize how close the enemies really are to the city.

5948621,3,B00EVU3SRC,"Racism, terrorism, controversial societal conditions; these are all hot-button subjects and ones that get a lot of attention whether it be in the news, in social forums or in the movies.  Since 9/11, these have become even more common, and while not every film that revolves around terrorism stakes its home in the 9/11 tragedy, its safe to say that they owe the attention they receive to the social consciousness every living person took home from that event.

A film like The Attack had a great opportunity to answer some questions that many unrelated to the issues at hand may have about the social environment in the Middle East.  With a strong core story that follows one mans quest to uncover the truth about his wifes involvement with a terrorist act, The Attack sets us up for what promises to be a very informative and engaging thrill ride.

Sadly, the ball was dropped here.

For me, The Attack suffers from too many unanswered questions and not enough clear character development.  When we get to the big reveal, everything feels so anticlimactic that we are left just as inquisitive and confused as we were in the beginning, even if our main protagonist acts as if all questions are answered.  It also fails at depicting a logical series of events, for the actions of the protagonist are never met with a reasonable end.  In other words, there is no way that he would have survived his abrasive inquiry of such a quiet and secretive faction and yet, he walks away with his answers, unscathed.  It makes very little sense, the way that this was mapped out, and it saddens me that the approach was more along the lines of a non-plausible Hollywood thriller as opposed to a direct and gritty look at real life scenarios.  What makes this approach all the more disappointing is that the pacing and dynamics of the film are of a more relaxed drama, and so the film winds up being slow AND unrealistic and so it just kind of becomes boring.

I hate to sound all Debby Downer here, but the more I think of the this the more Im baffled at how much potential was squandered here.

On a positive note, Ali Suliman is VERY good here.  Despite having some pretty ridiculous character development, he handles the reality of his characters grappling with his situation really well, and he sells it in its entirety.

Like I said, the core story is a really rich one.  A successful man who is happily married finds himself questioning everything when his wife is not only killed in a terrorist bombing, but is being accused of being the terrorist herself.  It had so much opportunity to really flesh out the inner madness that the husband was experiencing (which is does, to an extent) and then show the counterbalance of what that truth really represented, but it feels so underwhelming that all context is lost and the impact is pretty much nonexistent.",1386201600,9,2851,4.660678642714571
5948622,5,B00EVU3SRC,"This is an extremely important movie. It obviously was made on a very low budget. When the Israeli arab surgeon recall scenes of his honeymoon, both actors are the same. A very tiny flaw in a remarkable movie. The surgeon receives an prize, the first awarded to an Israeli arab, in a major Jewish hospital. He discovers the same day that his wife died as a suicide bomber. He tries to trace the roots of her disaster, and when he enters Nablus, the viewer is in Dante's hell: the very first taxi driver turns on his TV, where there is a Mullah prediction the destruction of Israel. He does find one of her advisers,, who praises the deed, and when on return to Israel his Jewish friends want to know why he did not go to the police for debriefing, he realizes he is not part of the Jewish state. As Albert Memmi wrote so long ago the Cartesian description of the colonized mind (in The Colonizer and the Colonized), the doctor must probably continuei his life elsewhere. The movie appears at the same time as The Gatekeepers, in  which the leaders of the Mossad regret their actions, and imply that only with negotiation can there be peace.

5948625,4,B00EVU3SRC,"A professionally done drama by a Middle Eastern producer that gives us a glimpse of believable characters along with newsworthy scenes of streets, highways and cities that few of us have ever visited. It benefits from a strong contemporary flavor. Yet, there are a number of logical lapses and unanswered questions along with underlying issues of moral ambiguity. If you don't mind subtitles, keep in mind that this film is drawn from today's headlines.  It will therefore offer special appeal to news junkies and students of ethnic divisions and conflicts.  The latter are overtly manifested, in real time, by the absolute censorship and refusal of certain Middle Eastern governments to allow this film to be screened in their countries.",1384732800,,738,5.19327731092437

5948627,5,B00EVU3SRC,"""The Attack,"" directed by Ziad Doueiri and based on the novel of the same name by the brilliant writer Yasmina Khadra, is quite simply one of the  best movies I have seen  in several years. It is refreshing to know that writers and directors are still doing work that should not  be missed  by thoughtful movie-goers. It is one of those films that you simply have to take the recommendation of whoever reviews it pretty much on faith as too much information will spoil it for you.  The film is about a suicide  bombing in Tel Aviv  with a heartbreaking twist to  the plot that asks  exceedingly difficult questions  about the ongoing Israeli  and Palestinian conflict.  (I read that the film has been banned or refused release in every Arab country for the crime of having been filmed in Israel. That should tell you something about  just how controversial this movie is.)

Ali Suliman as the Arab physician Amin Jaafari and Reymonde Amsellem who plays his wife Siham Jaafari turn in excellent performances; but the supporting actors are just as good as there is no lackluster acting  by anyone here. Filmed on location in Tel Aviv in both Arabic and Hebrew, the movie is subtitled and is almost two hours in length although it seems much shorter.
