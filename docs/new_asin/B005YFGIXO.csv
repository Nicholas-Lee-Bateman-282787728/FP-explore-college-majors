4905706,5,B005YFGIXO,"We love the book ""Stellaluna"".  What joy to find out it is a movie.  My children have watched it over and over again.  They just love that silly, sweet Stellaluna!",1390348800,,163,4.366666666666666
4905707,5,B005YFGIXO,"My almost four year old grandson loves bats, so he very much enjoys this dvd.  I thought it was very well done.
The animals are cute and appealing, and the predator-an owl-not too frightening.",1361750400,,192,4.647058823529412
4905708,1,B005YFGIXO,"We love the Stellaluna book and this DVD completely veers from the tone and warmth of the book's story.  It was a major disappointment. The movie guts the story, introduces the baby birds as snarky, adds terrible characters (a spider that wants to be a superhero and some tropical birds who want to make Stellaluna into something she's not) and has completely unneccessary ""scary"" parts.  I say scary with some qualifications - our kids are sensitive to such things and many of our friend's kids would not find this scary.  It also has the owl continually threatening to eat/harm the baby birds and Stellaluna as a subplot. This movie is not worth anyone's time.  There are so many movies that are much better.",1357948800,14,710,4.747967479674797
