2934032,4,B000V9KERE,I was hoping that there would be more from Catherine Bell but found this an enjoyable movie to watch once twice a year. Bell & O'Hara each have many other movies that I watch much more often.,1350086400,,191,4.1891891891891895
2934033,5,B000V9KERE,"Wonderful, fun movie for family viewing - well worth the higher than normal price for DVDs. All in cast are enjoyable to watch - especially Maureen O'Hara.",1343174400,,155,4.777777777777778

2934035,5,B000V9KERE,"A very charming movie. Maureen O'Hara is as great as usual. Her whit hasn't dampered in her older age.

I can recommend this movie to the whole family.

An elderly lady in need of some company she pays for a cab to Canada.",1219449600,,222,4.1395348837209305
2934036,5,B000V9KERE,"I have long been a fan of Maureen O'Hara.  When this filmed aired on TV, I watched it, taped it, and loved it!  Ms. O'Hara truly shines, reminding her audience that she truly is a great actress.

As in several of her more recent films, Ms. O'Hara's character begins this film somewhat cold and distant -- even cranky.  She soon warms up though, and she and Jason Beghe have great chemistry together.  Jason Beghe's Mike character begins what he believes is a short fare, only t find himself on a long roadtrip.

Catherine Bell and Haley Joel Osment also have wonderful scenes together.  There are so many very touching moments in this film.  Efrem Zimbalist Jr also has a small role, and it is definitely wonderful to see him here.

I am very glad that this film has made its way to DVD.  It's a movie for the whole family with a postitive message.  Maureen O'Hara is wonderful, and she should work more often.

If you're looking to buy this film, don't hesitate -- it's well worth the small pricetag.",1194652800,9,1001,4.5
2934037,5,B000V9KERE,"Finally!  Been waiting a long time for Cab to Canada to make it to DVD...Lifetime Movie Network doesn't show the movie near enough, and it is a very good, heart-warming film.

Maureen O'Hara is her usual brilliant self.  She and Jason Beghe, as the crusty-yet-lovable Mike, are good as the cabbie and his ""fare"" & to watch them become friends on their journey is touching.

The other side is Catherine Bell as Sandy, Mike's girlfriend, who helps care for his irresponsible neighbor's little boy, played by a young Haley Joel Osmant.  The scenes with Bell/Osmant are touching as well, as you watch them forge into a respect and friendship with each other.

All in all a great feel-good, heartwarming movie, about the value of friendship and the joy of being alive.  I'd recommend it to anyone, and as said, THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS OUT ON DVD!",1190592000,17,844,4.700680272108843

8217491,5,B000V9KERE,"Lovely movie, Maureen O'Hara was beautiful as usual.  The movie was wonderful and arrived way before scheduled, I just ordered it and in a couple of days it was in the mail box.  It was in my wish list for a long time and I was shocked to see how much the price had decreased so I bought it quickly.  I hope many others buy this wonderful movie to add to their collections as they will not be disappointed.  All the actors were exceptional.",1486771200,,440,4.2023809523809526

8217493,5,B000V9KERE,"This is a wonderful tv movie that I saw when first on one of the three big stations (ABC-NBC-CBS). Other reviewers here talk about it being reshown on cable in recent years. Since you sell this at such a high price, Amazon, can you also manage to do a deal to put Cab to Canada on Amazon Instant Video for 3 or 4 dollars a view? I'd love to see this movie again. Maureen O'Hara was grand in this film and charming. But until I win the lottery, I'm not going to spend the 2014 listed price for this DVD. How about negotiating a deal to make it available at a reasonable price on Instant Video? I bet tens of thousands of Maureen O'Hara fans around the US and the entire World would pay to see this. You could get a lot more Instant rentals for this than you get for Howard The Duck or Hudson Hawk or Heaven's Gate, three films you now instantly rent which are among the worst and least popular films ever made.",1418774400,,909,4.141242937853107

8217495,4,B000V9KERE,"Saw this movie on lifetime a years ago and liked it. I wanted to add this movie to my collection but, when I saw the prices for this movie the other day I was shocked to say the least. It is way too much money to pay for any DVD movie. They shouldn't be allowed to charge so much money for a dvd movie.. Disappointed!! And annoyed! I don't have this kind of money to spend on this DVD movie.. And the price has been so high for the past four years now. In print or out of print they have had these prices so very high for the past 4 years...Can't be out of print to me if it is still being offered . CRAZY! Don't pay these prices for this dvd boxset and they will lower their prices...The prices never seem to go down to a affordable price and this is going on 4 years now. And they say because it is out of print but this movie has been around at these very high prices at least 4 years.",1402444800,4,888,3.8846153846153846
8217496,5,B000V9KERE,Maureen O'Hara was wonderful in this role. This was a wonderful story and I can only hope that she will make more good family quality films for us to enjoy. She is just delightful!,1391990400,,180,4.323529411764706
