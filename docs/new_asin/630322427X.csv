610722,4,630322427X,"I used to watch this show regulary. Loved the relaxed, friendly feel to it. Thought I revisit the series and brought this video. It introduces you to the characters well..[I believe this is the first episode of the series]. You get to meet the Mc Gregor family...a nice bunch of people..with very fine looking sons. Matt McGregor is the father...the famous man from Snowy River. This story revolves around the race he did many years ago...to catch a horse. It, also, introduces a family feud. Fine performances all around. A warning to all you Hugh Jackman fans though..he isn't in this episode. He appears later on in the series but than Guy Pearce is in it..so...[big smile]",989366400,26,676,4.786324786324786
610723,5,630322427X,"I have watched this movie several times and each time I watch it, I seem to like it more.  It is a good family movie.  Movies about Australia and horses are always my favorites.  Andrew Clarke and Wendy Hughes were  excellent in their roles.  I would like to see more movies with these two  people.",957312000,13,298,4.327272727272727
610724,5,630322427X,"Snowy River, The McGregor saga, the Race, is awesome! It is one of the best ""Snowy River"" episodes ever made! Andrew Clarke plays great at the lead role Matt McGregor. Along with his daughter Danni(Joelene  Crgnorac), his oldest son Colin(Brett Climo), and other son Robb (Guy  Pierce), he competes with Oliver Blackwood(John Stanton) and his son Frank.  Meanwhile Robb is trying to win Victoria Blackwood's (Amanda Douge) heart  away from Luke McGregor(Joshua Lucas): Robb's cousin from America who is  fighting to get Langara(Matthew's property) from him. Matt and Oliver also  try to run Kathleen Oneal(Wendy Hughes), a widow with her young son  Michael(Ben Geurens) who are home from England, off her property. I  strongly recommend this video! It is a great family video full of fun,  rivalry, love, and competition.",950832000,32,821,5.253846153846154

The Grand Duke

610829,5,630322427X,"Snow River: The McGregor Saga ignores the two Disney movies and is more based on the poem. The series was filmed in Australia and it aired on here in the states on the Family Channel, known now as ABC Family. I recall watching it as a kid on the weekends. Sadly, The USA DVD releases have been lazy, releasing only a handful of episodes. Here is the pilot movie called ""The Race"" which had an American showing up on the McGregor farm claiming to be a long loss nephew, who happens to have an agenda against the family.  It's great first episode (well actually it is episode one and two wrapped into one).",1347148800,2,604,4.345132743362832

I have the triology 1-3 and and my daughter bought thr Race
The race listed seperate It is different than the race on the triology, On the Race, it shows the terrific down hill run as was in the original man from snowy river.
With that said this triology movies are very comparable to the original man from snowy river.

610909,4,630322427X,"A throwback to simpler shows on television.  Shows you could watch with younger children and not have to explain the double-entendres and deal with the potty humor. The plots are simple and definitely not full of post-modern self-awareness.  I vaguely remember this show broadcast in syndication.  Funny how the two young leads have become successful film stars (yes that is a young Guy Pearce of Memento and LA Confidential fame and a young Josh Lucas of Sweet Home Alabama and Stealth fame) playing Aussie Rob McGregor and his hotheaded American cousin Luke.  I guess some of the other Australian actors have gone on to bigger things in their country.  Andrew Clarke has done a lot of American TV guest roles.  Wendy Hughes guest-starred on Star Trek Next Generation as a love interest for Capt Picard.  However, what Artisan has done (and the reason I docked it a star) was take two episodes and combine them into a 90-minute movie, so you've got two unrelated stories.  Now I believe Artisan has been incorporated into Lions Gate Entertainment.  What Lions Gate should do is release this series in season sets.  (SPOILER: Josh Lucas only appears in Season 1; apparently his character dies in the last episode of the season -- sorry ladies. In reality he apparently got disillusioned with making a TV show in another country, Hollywood hypocrisy and teen idoldom, and quit show biz for a year, moved to NYC  to go back to college or taking acting/voice classes - claiming he worked with a dialect coach to lose his southern accent -- the accent he speaks with here is the one I've always heard him speak with when not in ""character"" so I think he's having some fun with the public...Don't get me wrong: I like him as an actor; here he's a little green around the gills, but some raw talent shows through)",1127001600,,1807,4.722929936305732
610910,5,630322427X,"I watched the series on Family Channel, and it has always been one of my favorites. I only wish more of the series was out on DVD. This DVD is formatted as a single movie by tying the first two episodes together. Though it leaves the primary conflict somewhat hanging, and there is a clear division between the episodes, enough is resolved to make the story stand alone. The quality of the writing and acting is among the best done for television, and is superior to that of the movie ""The Man from Snowy River"" and its sequel. There is a good mixture of drama, comedy, and a little adventure. It is something of a western (set in Australia), though it is no shoot-em-up. The story was sufficiently interesting to keep me watching, until I moved somewhere that didn't have the Family Channel. (a grave disappointment) I am amazed that the show hasn't gone much into syndication.
For the general viewer:
If you are looking for a captivating story with some action, romance, and drama, this is good. If you're looking for an action-thriller or heavy sex, pass it up.
For Parents:
* no gratuitous sex or violence
* no objectionalbe(to me)morals
* story probably not too interesting to small children
Note: There is some minimal physical violence. There was fisticuffs between two young rivals for a girl's affections, and an angered parent roughly handled a teacher that had physically abused his daughter. (Nothing excessive - He was clearly reigning in his justifiable anger. The abuse itself was not shown.)",1089763200,39,1507,4.8

Have searched Blockbuster to Amazon and so far I believe this is the only one released to date.

610913,4,630322427X,"I was a fan of the Snowy River TV series, but unfortunately the last season didn't air on American TV.  This was, of course, the season where Duncan Jones (Hugh Jackman) came to town to fill the void when Guy Pearce's career (he played son #2, Rob) took off.  Hugh appears in five episodes, all available on amazon.com.  They are:  Comeback (Duncan Jones comes to town), The Grand Opening (Duncan proves himself), Black Sheep (Duncan's deep dark secret is revealed), Prince of Hearts (Duncan merely provides the occasional remark regarding the main storyline which does not involve his character), and The Grand Duke (Duncan must choose between the high country and the sea).  Hugh Jackman does not appear in the next episode, New Business, as Guy Pearce returns, but the ramifications of his storyline are discussed among the characters.  It was wonderful to see a younger Hugh, and I love hearing him talk in his native accent.  Only Black Sheep is a truly goofy episode (but Hugh gets much better at having nightmares on camera by the time he is cast as Wolverine).  If your goal is to see as much as Hugh Jackman as possible, then these episodes are highly recommended.",1076457600,33,1173,4.772277227722772
