215757,5,6300183920,"This is, perhaps, the mother of all tear-jerkers. And this is, without a doubt, Lana Turner's finest performance. She plays a beautiful woman who becomes involved in a horrible accident and to avoid having her son be haunted by the scandal must go away and seek a new identity. There is, of course, much more to this dramatic soaper, but I don't dare give anything more away. It is truly an emotional experience, but the best part of the film is Turner. She is magnificent and proved once and for all that she had the skills to match her beauty and glamour. Constance Bennett, as Lana's bitter mother-in-law, also turns in a fine performance in what would be her final role.",974678400,28,674,4.578512396694215

215966,5,6300183920,"LTs performance the last 30-40 minutes is heart wrenching.  I always thought of her as somewhat of a lightweight who coasted on her looks, but here she really delivers the goods.  I have to admit laughing at a couple scenes during the first half that seemed especially contrived and melodramatic, e.g., a collapse into a snowbank due to emotional distress.  Generally not something to laugh at, but....judge for yourself.  But the last third of the picture--WOW.  She was/is entirely convincing as a fallen woman, drunk, addict and loving mother who had more than atoned for her ""sins.""  If the courtroom scenes don't move you, you have no heart.  This is a definite watch if you like Douglas Sirk films or Turner's other vehicles such as Peyton Place or Imitation of Life.

215968,5,6300183920,"Lana Turner stars as Holly Parker, a shop clerk who marries a wealthy man (John Forsythe) with political ambitions.  She loves him, but his long absences drive her into the arms of a slimy playboy (Ricardo Montalban) and her mother-in-law knows all about it.

This was the third Ross Hunter-Lana Turner movie and like the others, it features a glamorous woman in designer gowns who lives in a palatial estate, has her heart broken and it's all delivered with much sudsy melodrama.  This film has even more to offer:  The star allows herself to appear old and pathetically, even grotesquely ugly and gives a genuinely heart-tugging performance.  Don't watch the trailer first, as it spoils the whole story and it's a really good script with lots of dramatic twists and turns and an ending that left me sobbing.

Lana Turner is good in the role of outsider-turned-socialite and Forsythe and Montalban are, too.  Keir Dullea is well-cast as an attorney and Burgess Meredith excels as a loathsome criminal.  The story is poignant and should ring true to all parents and children.  Recommended.",1332892800,,1089,4.93956043956044

216013,4,6300183920,"Lana Turner's last major hurrah was this sleek update of the classic Alexandre Bisson play, ""Madame X."", previously filmed in 1929 starring Ruth Chatterton (and again in 1937 with Gladys George).  Produced by Ross Hunter (the man who had dragged Ms Turner back into box-office paydirt with ""Imitation of Life"" and ""Portrait in Black""), this tried-and-true melodrama was the perfect material for Turner's acting talents.

In MADAME X. (1966), Lana Turner plays Holly, the vivacious young wife of up-and-coming diplomat Clay Anderson (John Forsythe).  Holly has it all, but Clay's globe-trotting lifestyle unfortunately allows Holly to fall prey to the advances of notorious ladies' man Phil Benton (Ricardo Montalban).  During a bitter fight where Holly tries to leave Phil once and for all, he accidentally falls down the stairs.  Faced with going to trial for his ""murder"", Holly's icy mother-in-law (Constance Bennett) forces the bewildered Holly to stage her death, and stay out of Clay's life forever.  Many years pass before Holly, now a drunken, broken old woman, emerges in New York, once again accused of murder.  But this time the past is more than a memory away...

In MADAME X., Lana Turner proves (sadly really for the final time) just how wonderful she could be when the material was first-class.  Holly was reportedly one of her favourite roles, and I'm sure she held the experience in fond memory (especially as she later waded through such dreck as 1969's ""The Big Cube"" and 1980's ""Witches' Brew"").  Constance Bennett is splendid as the witchy mother-in-law (she sadly passed away shortly before the movie was released); Burgess Meredith is appropriately slimy as the blackmailer trying to ride Holly's coat-tails.  Keir Dullea co-stars as Holly's adult son.

A classic, ultra-glossy tearjerker.",1256774400,2,1812,5.253472222222222

The cast is excellent (Lana Turner, John Forsythe, Burgess Meredith,
Ricardo Montalban, Joan Whats-Her-Name)but the plot and the schmaltzy
dialogue plus the tear-jerking conclusion leave me laughing and that's it.
Why was this movie made ?  And as late as 1966.  This is a 1940'-50's film,
in my opinion, and outdated by the Sixties.  But so many people seem to like

216016,3,6300183920,"A lot of people love this movie and so do I--but probably not for the same reason. Not for nothing was this the last gasp of the Ross Hunter tearjerkers in the ""Imitation of Life""/""Back Street"" mode. By the mid-Sixties, this type of hokum was far more comic than melodramatic--just look at the ridiculous casting, which includes a 40-something Lana Turner (who'd just played Sandra Dee's mother/stepmother in her last few pictures) as a young bride. . . having her first child! Surrounding her with inappropriate actors like bland John Forsythe (as her middle-aged ambitious ""young"" husband) and veteran Constance Bennett (who somehow looks more like Lana's younger sister than her mother-in-law) didn't help realism. Cheesy production values and anacronisms (all the women are dressed in the height of Sixties middlebrow fashions--in scenes taking place thirty years earlier!) just add to the fun.

216061,5,6300183920,"Although a box-office failure on its initial theatrical release in 1966, MADAME X has since become a cult classic beloved by drama queens of both sexes everywhere.  Bad timing and bad reviews (this is the film which inspired famous critic Pauline Kael to write scathingly and unjustly of Lana Turner, ""She isn't Madame X - she's Brand X.  She isn't an actress - she's a commodity.""), along with the huge shift in public taste which happened in the mid-sixties (just compare this film with the equally over-the-top but much more ""gritty"" and ""realistic,"" WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF, also from 1966) killed MADAME X in the theatres and basically ended Turner's career as a first-rank star.  But then a funny thing happened.  When MADAME X was sold to television in 1967 and received its initial screening, it stunned executives by attracting the highest ratings of any motion picture ever shown on TV to that date.  SInce then, MADAME X has been a television perennial and a fixture on the afternoon matinee circuit.  For nearly forty years, MADAME X has been playing somewhere on TV every week.  In industry parlance, this one has ""legs,"" and it just keeps on playing and playing...Why?  Because, quite frankly, this is the melodrama that breaks the mold!  MADAME X uses every trick in the book to reduce you to a helpless pool of unstoppable tears and uncontrollable emotions.  It shamelessly piles up the cliches until you can't resist any longer and just get swept away by the breathtaking, glorious, audacious melodrama unfolding before your astonished eyes.  Lana Turner plays Holly Parker Anderson, who makes a horrible mistake and endures the sufferings of Job for the love of her child, and tops it all off by dying tragically just before her otherwise-inevitable redemption.  Another reviewer has commented on MADAME X's rather tortured production history, so I won't rehash that here, except to say that film historians now believe that the great Douglas Sirk initially agreed to come out of retirement to direct Turner in the project, but was prevented from doing so by ill-health.  Producer Ross Hunter nevertheless met with Sirk on numerous occasions, gaining his help behind the scenes.  Hunter also employed Sirk's favorite cinematographer Russell Metty and his designer Jean Louis, who have no difficulty supplying MADAME X with the lush, polished, sumptuous, truly Baroque surface appearance characteristic of the Sirkian melodrama.  From the glossy, upper-crust lifelessness of the Anderson mansion to an exceptionally sleazy Tijuana hotel, the film presents a vision of reality which could exist nowhere outside the classic ""woman's picture,"" of which Hunter was the last and perhaps greatest purveyor.  The direction (by an otherwise unknown TV figure) is so fast-paced and hieratic the whole thing comes to seem almost like Japanese Kabuki - highly stylized on the surface, deeply emotional underneath.  The montages, the wipes, the fades-to-black and a host of other cinematic devices already hoary with age forty years ago are used with such speed, conviction and authority that the whole thing seems possessed with a ferocious visual energy that keeps you riveted to the screen almost in spite of yourself.  Lana Turner pulls out all the stops and gives us what has to be the single greatest performance of her career.  Always shockingly underrated as an actress (and for the most part wasted in stupid MGM costume dramas), Turner acts this role as though she knew she would never get another chance to show us what she could really do.  Pouring a lifetime's worth of her own tortured emotions into the part, Turner rises above a script so overstuffed with ancient cliches and bizarre twists-and-turns that you practically have to scrape the mold off of it to produce an unforgettable portrayal of a woman born to be misunderstood, manipulated and abused by everyone around her.  The first part of the film presents us with the Lana we know and love from IMITATION OF LIFE - gloriously blonde, dripping with jewels and adorned with the finest couture ensembles (notice that Turner wears a different outfit in every scene).  Her necessary metamorphosis from glamour to gutter horrified Turner, who screamed at her own reflection and wore a veil to the set when she first saw herself in the old-age makeup she wears in the final sequences, but I find a beauty and truth in Turner's exhausted, worn-out visage as Holly Anderson's life reaches its heartbreaking conclusion that is far more affecting than the gorgeous mask she wears at the start.  The physical transformation is completely believable - she looks like a totally different woman and it is easy to accept that her own husband would not at first recognize her, but the lost beauty of Holly's face is more than compensated for by the beauty of her soul revealed via Turner's astonishing acting.  Her expression when she finally realizes just who her attorney really is ought to have won her an Oscar nomination all by itself - it is a crime that MADAME X's financial failure denied Turner the Academy recognition that she so richly deserved (then, as now, the Oscars tend to award financial success along with artistic merit...)!  The chemistry in these scenes between Turner and her lost son Keir Dullea (whose own performance is unbelievably touching) is amazing - the unexpected emotional bond between them is almost palpable, making what would otherwise be ridiculous hokum into a totally convincing tragedy.  Constance Bennett came out of a long retirement to play the ultimate mother-in-law from Hell and she burns up the screen as Holly's antagonist, creating a riveting portrayal of a woman whose vanity and unhealthy attachment to her own son ruin everyone's lives in the end.  Ironically, Bennett showed up on-set with a brand-new facelift just at the start of production, and she and Turner fought constantly over who would be shown off to best advantage, but their personal antagonism only adds to the raw emotional tension onscreen.  Some have said that Turner and Bennett seem much too close in age for comfort, but this accidental circumstance only enhances the situation and underscores the Oedipal jealousy so crucial to the plot.  The last scenes of this movie would wring tears from a rock, they are so sad and tragic.  On the male side, John Forsythe as the ambitious husband (who looks so much like Blake Carrington at the end of the film that it comes as something of a shock) and Ricardo Montalban as the trashy lover are quite simply, perfect.  If you are looking for a film that combines stunning visuals, gorgeous photography, a riveting story, and heartfelt emotions, this is it!  Although sadly out-of-print, find a copy of this movie now and watch it with your mother, your girlfriends, or your boyfriend if you want a real, old-fashioned ""Night at the Movies"" that will show you what human drama is all about.  Why this classic hasn't yet been released on a DVD (so that we can see it in glorious widescreen) is beyond me.  Along with Sirk's IMITATION OF LIFE, MADAME X is the ultimate ""chick-flick"" and the ultimate movie soap opera.  They don't make them like this anymore, but I wish that they did.  If you are suffering and need a good cry, this is the movie for you to get it all out of your system.  Thank you Ross Hunter and Lana Turner for leaving us this amazing emotional experience!  There have been seven versions of this story, but this is the MADAME X that people remember.  It is a Grade-A classic for the ages that will just keep playing when so many others will lie forgotten in the vaults.  See it as soon as possible and have some Kleenex ready!",1137283200,8,7679,4.931677018633541

216064,5,6300183920,"""Madame X"" was already an old story before Lana Turner and producer Ross Hunter decided to adapt it to the big screen. It was written in 1909 by Alexandre Bisson and had already had several movie adaptations, including one in 1929 which had made its star, Ruth Chatterton, the first major new dramatic actress of the talkies. In the early 1960's, Lana Turner was looking for a great vehicle which would reactivate her independent production company. After screening the 1937 version of ""Madame X"" (starring Gladys George), Lana eagerly discussed the idea of another remake with Ross Hunter. Hunter was the last of the producers who specialized in ""women's pictures,"" and he easily sold the idea to the executives at Universal.

In 1962, Turner and Hunter bought the story rights from MGM and entered into a co-production deal involving Hunter's ""crew"" and Turner's own Eltee Productions. However, filming was delayed until April 1965, mainly due to disagreements over the script. Lana Turner hadn't had a really great role since 1959`s ""Imitation of Life"" (which was also produced by Ross Hunter), but her extraordinary performance in ""Madame X"" turned out to be the greatest of her entire career. It's simply a crime that she wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. Nearly all her fans both then and now agree that if ever Lana deserved an Oscar it was for ""Madame X"".

Lana Turner plays Holly Anderson, the wife of a wealthy diplomat. Neglected by her husband Clay (John Forsythe), she is slowly led astray and seduced by Phil Benton (Ricardo Montalban), a wolf with the ladies. When Holly tries to end their affair, Phil loses control of his temper, and during their struggle, he falls down a flight of stairs and is killed. Holly leaves Phil's house and goes to her mother-in-law, Estelle (Constance Bennett), desperate for help. But her mother-in-law has always resented Holly and already knows of her affair with Phil (she hired a private detective). Knowing that this is her chance to be rid of Holly, Estelle gives her an ultimatum: give up her family and leave the country, or else be tried for the ""murder"" of Phil. Estelle also convinces her that the scandal would wreck the lives of her husband and young son.

Holly reluctantly agrees, and she heads for Europe while her husband and son are told she died in a tragic accident. As time passes, she sinks into a life of alcoholism and prostitution, and she becomes addicted to absinthe. While staying in a Mexican hotel, she meets Dan Sullivan (Burgess Meredith), an experienced conman who gets Holly to be his partner in a blackmail scheme. But when she finds out that Dan's intended target is her husband, she shoots Dan and then faces a murder trial, known only as Madame X. Ironically, the young lawyer assigned to defend her is her own son (played by Keir Dullea), now grown up and eager to win his first case. Although neither know of the secret which ties them together, they grow very close to each other as the trial progresses. As the trial nears the end, Holly's strength and will to live diminish, while her son becomes more determined than ever to win the case for her sake.

Although ""Madame X"" was not the financial blockbuster that Turner and Hunter had hoped for, over the years it has gained the reputation it deserves, as a classic tear-jerker. Lana Turner stated that the role of Madame X was one of her personal favorites, along with Sheila Regan (""Ziegfeld Girl""), Cora Smith (""The Postman Always Rings Twice""), and Georgia Lorrison (""The Bad and the Beautiful""). While touring the country promoting the film in the Spring of 1966, she said this to one reporter about her performance: ""I'm not a method actress, but the only way I can reach that kind of emotion is to call on situations and experiences in my own life. It's not easy to do because you lock them away. But it's the only way to get to that same level of intensity."" Lana Turner had indeed suffered through much tragedy in her life before filming ""Madame X"" and I doubt if she could've given such an amazing performance early in her career. Like previous reviewers, I am puzzled why such a wonderful classic like this hasn't gotten a DVD release yet. If you love classic tear-jerkers then get this movie in ANY available format!",1125446400,55,4270,4.758434547908232
216065,5,6300183920,"A film reviewer who has little respect for Lana Turner's abilities as an actress once wrote that in this film she gave the best portrayal of a hangover of any actress he'd ever seen.  Turner's directors all have said that she was a vastly underrated actress who was capable of memorable performances, that she was at her best portraying characters that she could identify with, and that she had little self-confidence and required sensitive direction.  When you watch Madame X, be aware that Turner's personal life, if anything, was even more tragic than the events in this film.  Three miscarriages, two abortions, a suicide attempt, multiple marriages--some of which were to abusive men, the murder of her father when she was only nine years old, the sexual abuse of her daughter by one of her husbands, the ghastly Stompanato murder, her daughter's confinement in a mental hospital and subsequent suicide attempt, Turner's struggle with depression and alcoholism, and more horrors haunted this actress's life.  A writer once commented that Turner's early life was characterized by desperate poverty, abandonment, and sadistic cruelty.  That Lana Turner managed to overcome all of this and sustain a movie career for more than thirty years is remarkable.  Although the plot devices in this film are hokey and manipulative, Turner plays the character with absolute conviction and honesty.  Her tear-drenched scenes with her little son, her desperate pleading to keep him seem to come from some place deep in her soul--not from mere acting.  She is also totally convincing as she portrays Holly's addiction to absinthe.  The courtroom scene in which she appears to crack under the pressure is harrowing. What other actress of her generation managed this kind of acting? Bette Davis comes close, perhaps.  Davis, by the way, was an admirer of Turner as was another great actress, Julie Harris.  This performance and Turner's performance in Peyton Place and in Ziegfeld Girl were her best.  She overcomes mediocre material to create  unforgettable performances.  Where's the DVD version of Turner's Madame X?",1101772800,31,2106,5.210682492581602
216066,5,6300183920,"I have always loved Lana Turner, but I believe that this is her best work yet.  She portrays a weak like person, until she is pushed to the limits her love for family out weighs the love she has for herself.  The role she played in ""Imitation of Life"" is almost compatible but this is heart wrenching.  Break out a box of tissues, because you will be totally consumed with this movie.  This is what acting is all about.  Watch it by yourself for the first time, so that you may be able get the full effect.",1092009600,11,506,4.175257731958763
216067,5,6300183920,"Lana Turner is terrific as the pawn of destiny in this elaborate soap opera; it's a plot that could fill five seasons of daytime drama, all wrapped up in one improbable but incredibly entertaining film. It isn't Shakespeare, but for suds, it's tops.
Turner plays Holly Parker, the ""little shop girl from San Francisco"" who marries a man of immense wealth and ambition, and as a package deal, along with the mansion in Connecticut comes his implacable mother, who has plans for sonny boy, and tells Holly she should have ""stayed on the other side of the counter"".
John Forsythe plays Holly's husband Clay Anderson with charm and elegance, and Keir Dullea is their grown son. Ricardo Montalban (who starred with Turner 13 years earlier in the charming comedy ""Latin Lovers"") is the man who tries to seduce her, and Estelle, the scheming mother, is played to the hilt  by Constance Bennett, in what was to be her last film.
Burgess Meredith does a marvelous turn as a slimy character Holly meets in a Mexican motel, and the way the rooms are decorated in these scenes is priceless; kudos also go to the make-up department in this section of the film, and Ms. Turner's ability to transform herself. This film proves that she was exceedingly underrated as an actress.
Well paced direction by David Lowell Rich, a lovely score by Frank Skinner, and lavish gowns by Jean Louis make this a memorable melodrama, and save your biggest hanky for the end, which though contrived, is still good for many heartfelt  sobs. Total running time is 100 minutes.",1087948800,23,1542,4.771535580524344

216115,5,6300183920,"There has never been, and will never be, a film that better depicts life's happiest and saddest events.  The movie opens with ex-salesgirl, newlywed Holly Anderson (Lana Turner) being welcome to the Anderson mansion and meeting her live-in mother-in-law.  Her husband, Clay Anderson (John Forsythe), is a rich, politician-on-the-rise.  They live the life of the socially prominent, always mindful of their public images.  Soon, an heir is born and Holly is a perfect mother.  But to be successful, Clay must, and does, travel extensively.  Lonely and bored, Holly succumbs to friends' urgings and fullfills her social obligations on the arm of a single, male friend.  This causes a series of tragedies, culminating in a surprise twist, and an ending that only a rock could get through without crying.  In her role as Holly Anderson, Lana Turner exposes the depths of a woman's soul and the expesses the breadth of a woman's love.

216118,2,6300183920,"Lana Turner stars as a woman who marries above herself into a powerful family, earning the dislike of her mother-in-law.  When she becomes involved with a notorious playboy who dies accidentally, her mother-in-law uses it as an excuse to get rid of her, forcing her to leave the family and her child, assuming a different identity.  Her life spirals downward out of control, until she ends up in jail, charged with murder and being defended by her now grown-up son.  There are a lot of holes in this story which relies far too much on coincidence and the stupidity of its characters to advance the plot.  Turner is the standout of the film, shedding her typical glamour as the character falls apart.  She makes the most out of the role as its written.  The supporting cast are given two-dimensional characters to impersonate.  John Forsythe barely registers a performance, while the great Constance Bennett barks out her nasty character.  The music telegraphs all the emotions at the start of every scene.  I'm not a fan of soap opera, but I can watch it if it's handled with a subtle touch.  Subtle wouldn't be the word for this movie.

Lana Turner gave a classic performance and the supporting cast couldn't have been better.
