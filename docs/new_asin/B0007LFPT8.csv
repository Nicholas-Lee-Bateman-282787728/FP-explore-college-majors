2217704,1,B0007LFPT8,"I rented this film, expecting some sort of cute history of Mediterranean culture--perhaps a touch dry and slow-moving, yes, but something that taught me a little, and perhaps even had subtle philosophical undertones. And, of course, to hear the many beautiful languages.

Well, I got the languages, but not much else. The history lesson did little more than list a few facts like a history textbook, perhaps understandable because the professor was speaking to an eight-year-old, but nonetheless rather dull.

Then the interlude of the three women and Malkovich was nothing short of silly. They were all speaking four different languages, which might have been interesting--if they hadn't kept HARPING on it. Dear God. It might have said something about communication or culture, but because they came right out and said LOOK THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SAYING ABOUT COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE, it killed any subtlety or deeper meaning. It was like a newspaper article. They told us what they were going to tell us, they told us, and then they told us what they told us. Over and over. (Listening to Malkovich's dreary monotone didn't help either.)

Everything about the dialogue was stilted and scripted. People were saying things like ""it was an arduous task, indeed"" to an eight-year-old; sentences were long and senseless; and the conversation kept dancing around actual politics to talk about some sort of utopian or distopian fiction that had everyone sighing and moping. It wasn't that it was difficult to comprehend--quite the contrary. It was so BLUNT and direct that there was no attention to actually making a movie at all. It was pointless political rambling.

And finally, the ending. Senseless, really. It didn't tell me anything about the fragility of life or the horror of terrorism or the corruption of mankind. Why? Because I had no emotional attachment to the characters, because there WERE NO CHARACTERS. There was no plot whatsoever. No continuity, no character development.

So I, well-known for crying in every movie, book, and television show that has even the hint of tragedy, was laughing my head off at the end that anyone could make a movie so INANE.

I love politics, philosphy, and languages; I like to learn about history; I love movies with beautiful scenery and deep hidden meanings.

This was THE WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Period. Reading all the other reviews, I realize there was nothing I missed or didn't understand in particular--I just thought it was poorly planned, poorly acted, and poorly done in general.

A resounding two thumbs down.",1138492800,11,2592,5.0256410256410255
2217705,4,B0007LFPT8,"The air of naivete that annoyed some of the viewers of this film was probably intended by the filmmaker to evoke the nearly universal expectation that peaceful behavior will protect us against violence.

It is to the filmmaker's credit that he also provides us with a moving survey of the notable accomplishments of several thousand years of civilized endeavor.  He reminds us of what there is to lose.

We are further meant to be taken by the voices and thoughts and histories of the three women.  They are oracles who gently dispute with one another, giving us a nuanced view of our modern world.  They and the captain epitomize civilized and tolerant discourse.

The filmmaker is skilled enough to know that he must also make us care about the professor and her child.  If we do not care, we will not be receptive to his terminal message.

This film is an eloquent rejoinder to the monomania of true believers.  Its power derives from its dramatization of the fragility of our world of nearly common values.

It is a beautiful prayer for tolerance.  The freeze frame on the captain's horror-stricken face shows us what the filmmaker urges us to understand and remember.",1128038400,4,1172,4.781094527363184
2217706,3,B0007LFPT8,"A Portuguese woman and her young daughter take a Mediterranean cruise ship while absorbing ancient historic sites and artifacts. Slow moving and clinical, the emotionless dialogue and blase photography forces the viewer to concentrate on the history lesson of western civilization, which evolves into a thematic comfort zone of it's own, until the preposterous climax, sure to incite emotion in the unsuspecting, and sedated viewer. ""A Talking Picture"" leaves one speechless.",1127520000,3,475,5.704225352112676
2217707,3,B0007LFPT8,"It is July 2001, months before the September 11 attacks on the United States. Rose Maria (Leonor Silveira) and her daughter Maria Joana (Filipa de Almeida) are on their way to Bombay to meet Joana's father, who is a pilot. They take a cruise and arrive at such places as Marseilles, Athens and Naples. Rose Maria is a history teacher and loves the fact she is finally able to visit the places she is always teaching about. And she is fascinated by the people she meets and the customs she learns.

 At first glance Manoel de Oliveira's ""A Talking Picture"" seems to be a travelogue piece showing us some of the most beautiful places on Earth. The movie doesn't seem to be about much yet I enjoyed watching the movie.

 After you watch the movie try and think back to what happened in the movie. You'll find the movie tells a little story, but, it takes on big subjects. You may also enjoy the film because, like a cruise, it moves at a gentle, calm pace. There is almost something lyrical about the movie. The charm of seeing these destinations and meeting these characters was enough for me to want to finish watching the movie. Some in fact may become so bored with it they won't even wait until the end.

 But what is ""A Talking Picture"" about and why does it matter that it takes place before September 11? Well you see the captain of the ship, John Walesa (John Malkovich) entertains three lovely ladies, all international beauties. They include Catherine Deneuve (""Belle de jour"", ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" and Truffaut's ""The Last Metro), Stefania Sandrelli (star of several Bertolucci films; ""The Conformist"", ""Partner"" and ""1900"", she also appeared in ""La Chiave (AKA The Key)"" and Irene Papas (""Z"" and ""Zorba the Greek""). These four people all speak different languages and yet they understand each other. They talk about world topics, such as politics. At this point in the film the movie addresses terrorism and has a chilling conclusion that makes the movie seem all too real.

 I realize after watching the movie some may find the conclusion pointless and ask themselves what was this all about? But if you think it over you will see the movie has a universal message. And its appeal should not be limited to a selective audience.

 The movie was nominated for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and is the lastest film from the now 96 year old Oliveira. I have yet to see any of his other films but I could tell just by watching this movie he is a man of extraordinary talent. I hope many of you come to enjoy this film as much or more so than I did.

 Bottom-line: Granted the movie is not full of action and moves at a slow pace but it has a certain charm to it that won me over. There is something gentle and calm about the movie. Plus the locations are amazing.",1119225600,7,2791,4.515873015873016
2217708,5,B0007LFPT8,"Portuguese director Manoel de Oliveira at age 96 concocted this strange little film that suggests and artist/philosopher glance over his shoulder about all of civilization and the development of culture and language and then a rather ominous look toward the future.  Part travelogue and part captured conversations this film may not be for the movie going public as much as for those who yearn to expand their cultural horizons.  It may wander around and lose focus, but it is such an elegant little journey that it bears watching repeatedly.

The time is July 2001.  Rosa Maria (Leonor Silveira) is a history professor in Lisbon and takes her young daughter Maria Joana (Felipe de Almeida) on a Mediterranean cruise to Bombay, India where the two will meet up with her husband. They board a cruise ship and for the first hour of the film mother gives daughter a verbal history of teh ports of call.  The ship stops at Marseilles (where the first strange famous lady  - Catherine Deneuve - boards) and after a walk through the streets of the port, dining on bouillabaise and learning about the Greek origins of the port as an introduction to the world of Greek civilization, the two return to ship.  The next stop is Naples (second strange lady - Stefania Sandrelli - boards) and the two wander Naples and journey to Pompeii to see the ancient ruins, mixing information of history and myth, the warmly rich instruction from the mother shares.  Then at Athens (third strange lady - Irene Pappas - boards) and the two visit the Parthenon and the Acropolis aided by the friendly information by a Greek Orthodox priest (Nikos Hatzopoulos) who illuminates the sites as well as the differences between Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic religions and symbols.  The ship's next stop is Egypt where the two view the pyramids and chat with a fellow Portuguese actor (Lu&iacute;s Miguel Cintra). The final stops include Istanbul, where the cross between Muslim and Christian faith is explained using the great mosque as example, and Tangiers where the two shop and ship's Captain Walesa (John Malkovich) secretly buys a doll for Maria Joana.

Finally back aboard ship Captain Walesa invites the three famous women to his table and there is an extended conversation among the four, each speaking her/his native tongue.  This plays like a string quartet as the various melodies are in French, Italian, Greek and English, and the conversation surveys languages, the various cultures, and the joys of communication even in this 'Tower of Babel' setting.  The Captain invites Rosa Maria and Maria Joana to this illustrious table the next evening and the Captain asks Irene Pappas to sing. During the song the Captain mysteriously leaves the table only to return with the quiet news that while in the last port terrorists placed time bombs on the ship and asks the passengers to prepare to evacuate the ship.  The climax of the movie is jolting and to reveal the ending would destroy the joy of the story.

At first this beautifully photographed film (cinematographer Emmanuel Machuel) appears to be just exactly 'A Talking Picture' with all of the history and travelogue atmosphere.  It is with the gradual introduction of the 'three Norns' and the American Captain's involvement that the message becomes more poignant and philosophical.  Setting this story in the summer months exactly before the terrorist attacks of 9/11 in New York provides the chilling poignancy that makes this film not the simple tale it first appears.  It serves as a shocking reminder how no matter how rich the history of our 'civilization' may be, it is fragile and tenuous in times such as these when random acts can destroy so much we hold precious.  In Portuguese, French, Greek, Italian, and English with subtitles.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, May 05",1115683200,11,3822,4.960815047021944
2217709,5,B0007LFPT8,"watching this film is like taking a cruise with a beautiful and intelligent portuguese history teacher who tells you all you need to know about the things you see. very, very pleasent up untill the ending, which packs a political message that you may or may not agree with.",1110153600,5,273,4.591836734693878
2217710,3,B0007LFPT8,"While I agree with the points made by the previous review (or should I say I disagree with the reaction of the audience at that particular theatre) I disagree to a point on the lack of ""realism"" of various individuals speaking their own native language and ""somehow"" understanding one another.  I am a Portuguese-American and find it very rare to ""discover"" a Portuguese-speaking film that is not Brasilian-Portuguese.  Which those of Portuguese or Brasilian descent will tell you that the expression of the language is very different.  So, when I come across a ""continental"" Portuguese-speaking film, it has my full attention.  Portuguese-made films available in the U.S. are very few and far between. And this is a market of which Manoel de Oliveira has cornered.  Whether one is fan of Mr. Oliveira's work or not (Personally, I'm split either way), I am thankful that there are attempts being made by Portuguese directors and actors to make these films and make them available in the U.S. without having to pay an arm and a leg just to purchase a DVD.

Having said all that, regarding a review of the film... it is not terribly ""unbelievable"" to have such a dialogue take place among Europeans.  Since the joining of the European union there has been an inter-mingling of the cultures, foods, currency, and languages of many European countries due to the erasing of borders.  I visited Lisbon, Portugal about 4 years ago only to be amazed by the diverse cultures, languages, etc.  It's not to say that we Americans do not have this in large populated cities such as New York, etc.

One example I found interesting.  Many of the restaurants had menus with 4 or 5 different languages represented.  I have yet to find this in the U.S.  My father speaks 4 different languages and is a history major, and he found ""Um Filme Falado""(A Talking Picture) ""believable"" for the diverse languages AND the historical accounts of exploration, conquest, Moorish captivity, religious persecution, the effects of England and America on the rest of the world, etc.  I could go on and on.

It is not uncommon to be at a table in Lisbon, for instance, and witness this type of exchange.  One example, when I was there I was not quite comfortable speaking Portuguese fluently.  I was raised speaking it, but my Portuguese is equivolent to that of a 3rd or 4th grader.  But I understand it quite well.  And someone that I was with spoke fairly good English.  So, there were times that both of us would flip back and forth. Sometimes speaking and answering in either language.  And their are many Europeans who speak 3 or 4 languages FLUENTLY and do just that.  This is something that Americans lack.  They may have taken a second language in high school but may have never seen the value of this and did not keep up with it.  Some people have a fear of what they do not understand.  So they ridicule it or avoid it. (enough preaching)

The movie may be slow at times, but I watched it with the idea that is was a docu-drama.  Hey, it's a mediterranean cruise as well.  If you've ever wanted to see what it would be like to  sail to Portugal, Naples, Istanbul, Egypt, etc., this movie has it!  The characters, including the captain played by John Malchovich, prove to be outstanding ""tour guides"" and ""historians.""",1109030400,5,3294,4.708041958041958
2217711,3,B0007LFPT8,"At the age of 93 (2003), Manoel De Oliveira decided to make a film that would offer the sensuality of travel, the beauty of mythology, the innocence of a child, and the heady intellectualism of a salon. The resulting film, A Talking Picture, is a tall order, even for a film director whose accomplishments span decades of writing, directing and producing.

In order to combine these broad stroke goals, Manoel De Oliveira created a conversation-filled film in which a beautiful history professor and her daughter travel by ship from Portugal to Bombay, stopping at historic sites. At each site she teachers her daughter, in a melodic, chimeric voice, about the past, how it ties to the present, in a language that is understandable to children of all ages. To infuse the salon, Oliveira throws in a sea captain (poorly cast with John Malkovitch) and three vibrant women, talking politics--personal and worldly, a la 'My dinner with Andre"". To make it even more cosmopolitan, each character speaks in their own tongue.

With all that conversation, history and thought, why does this movie fail?  The intellectual banter is too heady, incongruent, and dated, and John Malkovitch is downright creepy. The movie has no tempo, so there is no sense that we are going to actually learn anything.

What works: the sweetness of teaching the daughter about mythology, history, how the past intertwines withthe present. The beautiful backdrops of port of calls. If Oliveira had simply left this a sort of travelogue film it might have had a chance of working.

The film's first 20 minutes or so is worth watching. Enjoy that part and then shut down the DVD player.",1222387200,3,1653,4.931654676258993
2217712,1,B0007LFPT8,"The movie starts off as a very SLOW tour of famous places around the Mediterranean. A mother gives her daughter lessons about history and architecture at each port their cruise ship stops at.
Then the focus changes to the ship captain's dining table, where he has invited a French woman, an Italian, and a Greek woman. Somehow, magically, they can all understand each other's languages. The captain seems to fancy himself quite the debonair ladies' man, but he is SO effeminate, that it's laughable. He was creepy, is what he was. This Malkovich is one LOUSY actor, or maybe it's just the stupid script lines he was given.
The topper was the unbelievable ending. Due to some kind of bomb threat, the captain orders everyone to abandon ship. The little girl runs back to her room to reclaim a doll, then when she and her mother return to the deck, OH NO, the lifeboats have left them behind! (Wait, isn't the captain supposed to stay behind and be the last one to deboard???)
So the ""noble"" captain stands up in the life boat and SLOWLY (did I say SLOWLY?) starts unbuttoning his jacket, making like he's gonna jump in the water to save them, all the while yelling at the two to JUMP, JUMP!

2217713,1,B0007LFPT8,"SPOILER ALERT! This movie can hardly even be called a movie. Watching it is basically like following a very serious boring history teacher around as she explains random facts from ancient history to her daughter during their vacation. Other people join in with the boring facts, such as a priest who explains in detail what they will see inside a ruin they are about to enter, ""There will be a column on the left, blah, blah, blah."" The only cute thing about the movie is the little girl who is also boringly serious but has a sweet face. In the last five minutes of the movie, the director for some reason changes the movie from slowest-documentary-style-fiction-on-earth to low-budget-horror-film. The cruise ship starts to sink, the mom and daughter don't make it on time to the one escape boat (yes, suddenly there are only 12 people on the ship instead of the hundreds we saw before), and they are blown up. I wouldn't normally tell you the ending but this is such a ridiculous ending, and so mean after you've watched this mom and daughter for the whole movie, that it must be exposed before you bother to watch it.

2217714,1,B0007LFPT8,"Fortunately, this movie is so boring --at times rather childish without childlike charm--that not many viewers will stick it out to it's ridiculous end.

It is NOT educational as some reviewers claim.  Historical ""facts"" about some of the places visited  are, in fact, half-truths or outright distortions of historical evidence.  For example, while viewing the pyramids in Egypt, we are told that they were built by Jewish slaves.  If we Google ""who built the pyramids,"" we see the absurdity of this assertion. The mass immigration of Jews to Egypt did not occur until a thousand years after the pyramids were built. The identity of the actual builders is difficult to ascertain, but the historical evidence that exists suggests that the workers--many of them willing and dedicated--were certainly not foreign or necessarily enslaved.

Interestingly enough, the the most emotional misstatement of the film again casts a bad light on the people native to the Middle East, the Arabs--Irene Pappas makes a peculiarly overwrought and out of context statement blaming the Arabs for burning the library of Alexandria. In fact, historians have blamed Christians or Romans for this tragedy as well as possibly Moslems...it could be all three, no one knows for sure.

In the midst of a pseudo philosophical conversation at the ship's captain's table, one of the women veers completely off the ""topic"" to deliver a bumper sticker explanation of ""what's wrong"" with the arabs.

At the end of the movie, all this gratis arab/moslem smashing makes sense. The weird (vaguely perverted) captain whispers to the gals at his table that bombs placed by arab terrorists have been found on the boat and asks them to stay seated until the announcement is made,at which time they are to walk calmly and slowly to the lifeboats.

The mother and child find themselves stranded on the exploding ship because the child ran back to their cabin to retrieve a little arab doll she promises to protect. THE MESSAGE:Get it?! Arabs are bad and only cause disaster for anyone who likes them. This is propaganda not drama, and clumsy, bigoted propaganda at that.",1172966400,6,2128,5.057142857142857
2217715,5,B0007LFPT8,"I am disappointed and quite annoyed that many dislike this film and other works by Manoel de Oliveira.  This is a magnficient picture, one of Manoel's best, and it's really a deep, humanistic, and sad film about the current world situation and the world itself.  The film is filled with beautiful shots, great dialogue, intelligence, charm, and thought provoking themes and culture, yet, most people (and many critics) intensely dislike this work.  Perhaps after 2 decades of smug, aggressively cynical, ""ironic"", and arrogant attitudes in film and pop culture, people have suppressed their humanistic instincts, and that is the underlying reason that they cannot appreciate a film like this.  It shows that people don't really change (a conclusion that this film comes to), and that we ignore history at our peril.  We should be grateful that we have Manoel de Oliveira in our midst, a true treasure.  He is 99 years old as of this writing (and is still making great films), and the fact that he is sharing his wisdom and sense of art with us should make us priviledged.",1156377600,5,1071,4.889502762430939
2217716,2,B0007LFPT8,"This is a pretentious film that tries hard to impress us with a tone of high culture and with portent for civilation as a whole. But really, it is just a windy exercise.

First of all, the relationship betwen the mother and the daughter is a windy one. As the two make their journey on a cruise ship through the historic cities around the Mediterranean, the mother remains the perpetual pedagogue. I was reminded of the cautions issued by Ivan Illich, the philosopher of the homeschooling movement. He worried that many parents might interpret any call to homeschool simply as an invitation to move the classroom into their family lives - to use their time with their children as an occasion to cram more information into the youngsters, to accelerate them along the learning curve. And that's exactly what the mother in this film is doing. She stands perpetually in loco educator. She is intent on making this trip with her daughter ""An Educational Experience."" So I didn't find her to be a sympathetic character.

For her part, the daughter in this film seems perfectly content to have a walking curriculum for a mother. She reinforces her mother's pedantry by asking leading questions - about Napoleon and war and the Ottoman Empire. Like that would happen!

Then the conversation around the Captain's table is totally phony. I didn't particularly object to the fact that everyone understands everyone else's language. Europeans are notably polyglot. So that cinematic license wasn't much of a stretch. But the meringues of philosophy that the characters froth out, are all just too airy and aimless.

And they contain jarring notes of misinformation. The Greek lady claims that when America's Founding Fathers voted on what language would be the official language of the new United States, Greek lost by just one vote. I had always heard that it was German that lost by that single vote.

In her turn, the French woman aboard (played by Catherine Deneuve) states that the principles of the French Revolution inspired America's democratic Constitution. I think it was the other way around. The American Revolution and Constitution preceded the French Revolution.

Perhaps the writer and director of this film meant these ""errors"" to be sly commentaries on the actual chauvinism people harbor even as they declare in favor of the unity and equality of all mankind. I don't think so though. The movie's overall tone is generally one of such earnest instruction, that I believe these ideas may reflect the filmmakers' real misunderstandings.

John Malkovich is, as ever, creepy and subtly perverse in his role. Although he represents America in the international mix on board, his attitude actually better captures the sort of European male chauvinsim that persists to this day. He is incapable of seeing women as individuals. He sees them only as abstractions, as exemplars of charm or of the regrettable lack of charm.

The other characters, including the mother and daughter, are rarely shown in close-up. They are mostly shown from a distance great enough to make it impossible for viewers to see their features. I probably wouldn't be able to recognize any of these actors (outside the well-known Malkovich and Deneuve) if I saw them in other films. Again, this may have been intentional. The filmmakers may have wanted to be sure the characters stood, not as individuals, but as representatives of mankind. But I found myself straining to see a face, a unique expression.

In spite of all these failings, I was almost drawn into the movie during its final third. The quiet formality of the dialogue, the tender folk ballad that the Greek lady sings - almost made me care about the ending.

But not quite. On the whole, this movie is more histrionics than history. It attempts to be a travelogue through mankind's past and projected future. And for that, I think you're better off renting Rick Steves.",1155600000,8,3906,4.967840735068913

They can be monuments of stone, like the Pyramids or the Acropolis, or they can be people who have outlived their glory, like the three fading, aging celebrities on board the ship.

In any case, this is a disjointed, poorly produced movie.  The acting is stiff, and the recurring scenes, such as incessantly watching the bow of the ship passing through water, or crowds waving from the docks, are contrived and repetitive.  Even the constant questions posed by the little girl, and her seemingly patient mother, grates the nerves after a few minutes.  And the conversation between the women and the Captain is nonsensical, with each one speaking in their own language but understood by all.  That might be OK for French and Italian, but would hardly be the case for the Greek language (unless one were Greek).  In any case, the conversation of these people, including the Captain, were so self-centered as to be obnoxious.

2217720,1,B0007LFPT8,"I hesitate to announce my opinions to the world in a forum such as this but am moved to do so by the amazement I experienced when reading the glowing report in the synopsis provided for this movie as well as several of the reviews listed below. It is as if I have seen a completely different film.

This starts out as a travelogue of sights around Europe as experienced by a woman and her daughter and I presumed some coherent story line would evolve sooner or later. It never does. There are two and only two sequences in the entire movie: 1)the travelogue gimmick (although there are several) and 2) people sitting around a table talking with dialogue which gives new meaning to the word ""shallow"". That's it. I'm not kidding. Symptomatic of the inane direction (among several other faults too numerous to mention and starkly visible by even amateurs such as myself) is the ridiculous repeating shot of waves moving over the keel of the moving ship as the mother-daughter duo moves on to the next travelogue / history lesson sequence. It is truly embarrassing to see this over and over home movie camera type shot from a director who has been in the business for some 7 decades. A first year film student would receive an F for this type of lame-brained visual crutch. After about # 5 or 6 it actually gets pretty funny and provides some temporary relief.

When I arrived, at last, to John Malkovich's appearance, I thought that finally there would be some redemption from the exhausting tedium, that something - anything would start happening. Not so; his role was as irritating and meaningless as everyone else's and I watched in utter amazement that he would ever have consented to be a part of this amateurish nonsense. The script surrounding the never ending table talk by Malkovich and three women aboard the ship masquerades as something deep and philosophical but is instead vacant and self important cocktail party talk. Presumeably, some metaphysical, cosmic connection exists which allows all the participants in this conversation to understand one another since each person is speaking a different language. That's what passes for clever in this thing.

I remain astonished at the whole experience, particularly the very end which was the absolute crowning moment of cinematic imbecility. Those of you who have not seen this movie are forewarned - you'll probably not see any another such example of writing and directorial incompetence even if you go out of your way to find it. Well....there were a few episodes of ""Gilligan's Island"" which were worse, but that was television.

This movie is perhaps not as bad as Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" but is far more annoying since it not so bad as to be morbidly entertaining (as is ""Plan 9"") and pretentiously tries to make some last minute statement about terrorism as a rationale for its own existence. But by all means, go out and rent it. Invite some friends over, break out the munchies and watch with the same amazement I felt. Alcoholic beverages may be required and in generous quantities. At the shocking conclusion and as the credits are rolling, turn to your friends and see their stark expressions and open mouthed wonderment at what they have just experienced. You will be known as one who really knows how to do something unique as a party host. Then put on ""Plan 9"" to take away the pain.",1141689600,10,3371,4.767123287671233
8048234,5,B0007LFPT8,"Manuel de Oliveira was the voice of the Poruguese Cinema. His filmography is exquisite, sometimes pretentious, sometimes flippant, but nobody can deny his goal to show us the harmony of a world that him and us would like to live but that, pitifully we have to crash ourselves against the sphere of reality, everytime we read the news..

That's why he is for so many, supposedly intelectual , loaded of flippancy. But after all, the good cinema  is art at its purest essence.

The film is a journey (Remember Ulysses' gaze from Angelopoulos?) through the Mediterranean Sea, in which we'll find four absorbing ladies.

Intelligent dialogues ( 45') with a poetic license (Three women speaking each one in her native tongue, French, Italian, Greek and Malkovich in English) that toast is a true celebration for the fusion of these tongues.

8048235,4,B0007LFPT8,"It is a good movie to review the discoveries done by the Portuguese along several centuries. A little too didactic, though, but provides
a good lesson about Portugal and western Europe history - this one coming straight from the Greek civilization, as stated by the
University professor (mother of the little girl to whom she explains everything). Both, mother and daughter, are on a maritime trip from Lisbon to
Mumbai, and at every opportunity, both go to see remains of the glorious days when the Portuguese spread their culture and religion in the world, besides their language. Actors are fabulous, except, perhaps, the little girl, sometimes too self-conscious as her role as actress, keeping a stiff neck when she should look at what her mother was pointing at, or simply looking at her while explaining things. The presence of John Markovitch (I think that I am misspelling his last name), and the actresses he sat down with in the ship are a gift to the viewers. The final scene is anthologic. Recommend this movie to all ages!",1455926400,,1036,4.858757062146893
8048236,1,B0007LFPT8,"One of the worst, most tedious films I've seen in a long time.  This film had so  much potential;  an amazing cast of actors, beautiful locations...and yet the script, the photography, and the dialogue was atrocious.  A high school AV club could have made a better film!  Save your money and look elsewhere.",1453766400,,307,4.716981132075472
8048237,1,B0007LFPT8,"Tedious, pretentious, boring.

From the photography, to the direction, to the god-awful script, this movie is bad. It's as though the film maker was trying to make the world's worst film. If that was his goal, he succeeded.",1453766400,,223,4.868421052631579
8048238,4,B0007LFPT8,"Interesting, in a class by itself.
Several years ago I rented this movie and I totally failed to appreciate it.
Although I don't fully agree with all of the mother's explanations to her child, the movie is overall amusing, even educational. Perhaps closer to a 3 1/2, but I would nevertheless recommend it...",1442966400,,308,4.830188679245283
8048239,1,B0007LFPT8,"The ending of this movie makes no sense at all. Picture three of us sitting on the couch, frozen, popcorn halfway to our mouths which are hanging open in astonishment. My girlfriend said, ""What the heck just happened?!"" My theory, in answer to her question, is that the director ran out of money for the film and had to cut it off.",1438732800,,331,4.354838709677419
8048240,2,B0007LFPT8,"A tepid, awkward travelogue interrupted by tepid, awkward dinner-table philosophy and put to rest by an awkward ending apparently intended to imbue the film with meaning through tragedy. The only success in the film was capturing John Malkovich's expression at the end of the movie and holding that one successful moment frozen through the credits.",1325376000,,348,5.345454545454546
8048241,5,B0007LFPT8,"This film,""A Talking Picture"",is literally that,a film-travelogue of a Portuguese Professor and her daughter ,who engage in a history lesson while the two travel around the Mediterranean,the cradle of the civilization that Europe emerged from,while they visit its major landmarks on a Mediterranean cruise. The mother explains to her daughter the meanings of `myth', 'civilization', 'nature','mosque' etc. the tour stops off at Pompeii, the Acropolis, and the Pyramids. Throughout, little Maria Joana acts as blank, baffled slate, soaking in the contradictions of history. Poised to the point of stiltedness, the parent-child exchanges are strictly informational: the inquisitive girl asks leading questions (""Which Middle Ages are we in now?""), and her impassive mother disgorges reams of encyclopedic dialogue. Jean Luc Godard drew heavily on this in his latest film,Film Socialisme. This is a straightforward riff on a Mediterranean cruise as history. I could not take the mother and daughter relationship as anything but symbolical,a hook to put the film's clothing on. No mother however clever talks to her daughter in this way. Similarly later on in the film when the Captain of the ship (Malkovitch),talks with the 3 famous women at his table and they all speak in their own tongues-Greek,Italian,English and French-I did not feel any discrepancy, merely poetic license,as they all seemed to understand each other. Love,women,politics and language are the topics presided over by the effete sea-captain. Europe used to have people who spoke more than one language. There is a sense of nostalgic innocence about a timeless beauty that no longer exists. A fable. A millennial crossroads of Western Civilization explodes into a contemporary newsflash.

But it is not only the shock of the film's ending that exposes the deficiency of any such notions, the false sense of security that we, as viewers, share with the film's protagonists. All along the way, as Maria Joana and her mother, Rosa Maria (Leonor Silveira), disembark at successive stops on their odyssey, we begin to discern - in the film's dispassionate loquaciousness, in the director's deliberately static camerawork, in the subtle and not-so-subtle ironies that colour the intellectual colloquy between mother and child as they navigate A Talking Picture`s otherwise childless world - a subversive undercurrent that gradually turns the rich pageant into a full-blown jeremiad, a bittersweet goodbye to the West and its legacy. The little girl's journey is given primacy,before the ship's arrival at Aden,in the Arab world. The West seems old and childless:the elderly fisherman,the Orthodox priest,the actor in Egypt,the 3 distinguished ladies,the  captain. Maria Joanna is burdened with an awesome responsibility as the single vessel capable of preserving the legacy of the past for the future. Like the small dog who becomes the anchor of the boat,her daunting destiny leaves us close to the edge. In her hands the future is fragile. Her serious mien seems freighted with preconscious knowledge of the task's enormity. Stories of heroes, protectors and goddesses are presented,receding mistily into the realms of ruin,myth and legend:mermaids,muses,the myth of the statue of Athena inside the Parthenon that inspired the wisdom of philosophers,playwrights, musicians. Who protects Greece now?With the face of the broken Sphinx in Egypt,we sense a civilization that no longer believes in its own protective myths. The camera lingers on the monuments when people are gone,mute,abandoned by history. Globalised English,not the original Greek dominate,marginalizing culture by commerce.

The closer exchange between East and West e.g. the Suez Canal,has put them on a collision course. Reversing Ulysses journey home westward away from war,the mother and her daughter travel eastwards towards the absent father, towards war,the spectre of September 11th in front of them. In this Homeric reversal speech becomes a decadent luxury devoid of action. Words have become descriptive,as Helen says at dinner,""No Civilization lasts forever"".",1324339200,3,4100,5.57784911717496
8048242,1,B0007LFPT8,"This is the only film to which I've given a one star rating.  I wish I could give it a zero.

I watched the first part with some interest as an attractive young Portugese woman and her pretty little girl take a cruise from Lisbon eastward.  I did find it a little boring as the woman, a history teacher gave lectures to the girl about the sites.  I kept expecting something interesting to happen.  I wondered if this was some kind of travelogue?

Then there was the introduction of the ""stars.'  Whatever possessed John Malkevich and Catherine DeNeuve to appear in this film totally escapes me.  However I thought that finally something interesting might happen.  No...it was an unendurable, pretentious conversation of the worst type.  I ended up fast-forwarding through it, missing Irene Pappas's song.  Yuk!  Malkovich, a brilliant actor was embarrasingly creepy here.  I wonder if he ever watched it.

Then....oh gee I don't want to spoil the ending for those of you who are really going to buy this....Suffice it to say that it should have happened earlier on.

I cannot think of one good reason to see this film.  There are many better travelogues and if you want to hear Portugese spoken, I'm sure there are far more interesting language tapes.",1289952000,2,1251,4.775700934579439
8048243,1,B0007LFPT8,"In addition to all the other one-star reviews, with which I agree, what annoyed me about the film is the sheer fraud of it.  It trades on all the good things -- the glories of Western civilization and history, the great European tradition of conversation, the understated European style of film-making -- but it makes such poor use of them all as to actually cheapen them.  The film simply rings false from beginning to end.  Let's see: a history professor mom has raised a daughter to age EIGHT who needs to ask what a myth or legend is?  Or a mermaid, for crying out loud?  And a Roman Catholic Christian who prays (the fact is prominently stated) has raised a child who has never heard of Moses or pharaohs?  Oh, but this is not a real mother, it's a cardboard cutout -- and it talks like a dumbed-down textbook, not like a woman to a child, despite all the efforts of the excellent and charming actress Leonor Silveira.

The film is filled with Chekhov's guns that do not go off at the end.  Nothing, literally nothing is made of the episode with the fisherman's dog, or the seemingly suggestive encounter with the suave Portuguese actor.  The much built-up conceit of the captain's table conversation in four languages without translation collapses when the Portuguese mother and child join the table: no magic after all, not a modern-day Pentecost, simply people who know English, French and Italian -- not unusual for Europeans (although adding Greek to it is a stretch) -- but don't know Portuguese.

And the platitudes they spew in those languages!  I am sure this was intended as sparkling wit and nuance.  Let's see: (1) Love is a tyrant; (2) The world would be better run by women; (3) The cause of terrorism and religious fundamentalism is lack of ""convergent values"".  And so on, interspersed with pseudo-historical cliches such as that Arabs spread Greek culture to Europeans.  I feel sorry for the excellent Catherine Deneuve and the other actors (even the abominable, embarrassing John Malkovich) who had to work with such awful script.  On second thought, no, I don't, they chose to do it.

I understand that Oliveira has a following; I have not seen his other films; and I allow that some things may have been lost in translation.  But on balance... no, we didn't ""not get it"" because we are uncultured swine.  This emperor really has no clothes.",1244764800,4,2365,4.726829268292683
