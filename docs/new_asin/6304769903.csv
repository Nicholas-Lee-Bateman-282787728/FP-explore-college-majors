7877793,4,6304769903,I saw this on VHS many years ago.... I loved it. I thought I would buy a copy on DVD. I cannot find a DVD of it. I imagine it might be another lost piece of Americana... I hope not ! Does anyone know of a company that has made the transfer to DVD and if so where can I buy a copy.,1363996800,,280,3.4603174603174605

7877795,5,6304769903,"I have viewed copies of this video from the public library. This is an entertaining and historical video about how this little company in Minneapolis - Burma Vita Company - became a success with the red signs found along rural highways. This video shows lots of old cars from the days during and after the great depression and World War II. It has lots of great rhymes, some of which are serious in nature, but most are just plain fun. For older people, this video will bring back memories of the cars they once drove on the highways. I recommend this video highly. You'll really enjoy it!",1002153600,8,589,4.514018691588785
