4194498,5,B003U6GZUA,"I've been watching Britcoms for nearly 40 years and Rev. is one of my favourites.  Tom Hollander is brilliant and U.S. audiences who have seen him play villain like characters (Pirates of the Carribean) will be won over by his Rev. Adam Smallbone.  I have watched this series repeatedly because of it's humourous, feel good-ness that speaks to everyone no matter what beliefs they hold.  I look forward to Amazon carrying season 2 and I believe they are starting to film season 3 in the near future(?)

4194499,5,B003U6GZUA,"This is might be the funniest, wittiest show on BBC, ever.

It's a damn shame they haven't published a Zone 1 version, though.",1340150400,5,126,4.478260869565218
4194500,5,B003U6GZUA,"Absolutely hilarious! What a surprise! I've never thought of Tom Hollander as being remotely funny but the cast of characters in this series make a 'gas' to watch! I was home alone and couldn't help but reflect at the way I laughed aloud at every epi. Steve Evets (Colin) and Jimmy Akingbola (Mick) are my absolute favs! Those two characters come across so genuinely real, I started to believe that Steve Evets is the mischievous, immature, miscreant and that Jimmy Akingbola is REALLY a drug-addled beggar! I'd never seen these 2 actors in anything before to make a comparison but their performances in Rev. were truly engaging -- I love it when Colin and Mick come on screen! I just hope that S2 is not messed up with the addition of a baby :( At that point, I'll probably stop watching as the 2 main characters Rev. and his wife, in my opinion, need the freedom on NOT being parents in order to continue the hijinks depicted in the series.",1465516800,,942,4.547058823529412
4194501,1,B003U6GZUA,"I had a few laughs from this show, especially with Nigels character.  Unfortunately, episode 3 didn't work for me.  To sum up the episodes problem very briefly, a larger church led by Darren temporarily joins with Adams (Revs) church and soon Adam wants the two to separate again.  There are a few laughs along the way, and although Darren is certainly portrayed throughout as the antagonist, both sides actually have serious issues.  During a service near the end of the episode, one of Adams regulars, Colin, molests a woman from the other congregation.  (At no point in the writing is it called molestation or sexual assault, its only he touched her bottom etc.).  She bolts out of her seat during the service when it happens and yells as she runs away.  Darren (still the crazed antagonist) wants the assaulter to be barred from attending again, but Adam, not acknowledging there is a sexual assault to address, defends the accused by saying hes been a regular for 15 years and uses scripture to try to manipulate Darren into not pressing charges.  Of course, for Adam none of this is actually about forgiveness or healing, and he certainly shows no regard for the victim  he wants the congregations to separate again, and promotes inaction toward an accused molester to do it.  Would the confrontation have gone the same if it was Adams wife who was touched instead of someone he didn't really known from a different congregation that he wouldnt have to see again?  (And the archdeacon backs up Adam even though he has no real motivation to do so as laid out in the episode, and the two congregations then separate.)

At the end of the episode, Adam and Colin talk privately.  This would have been the perfect time for Adam to share the Good News that even though he did something terribly wrong, Jesus died to pay for his forgiveness, but its not that kind of show either.  Adam does not remind him of the Gospel, does not tell him he is still loved and forgiven, and does not really address how molesting someone can have very long-lasting effects.  Instead, Adam chides him with What you did was wrong, you know that, don't you? and No, but you cant do that.  Its horrible for women.  People lose their jobs because of that sort of thing.  Worse, Adam actually says thanks to him because the act of molestation made the other congregation and its leader leave like he wanted.  Colin admits what he did, and gives no understanding or acknowledgment of it being wrong (his response to the thanks for molesting is You can always count on me, Vicar), and we also get no indication that Adam or the archdeacon will have any follow up by means of counseling or even prayer.  They don't seem troubled by episodes end that they have a regular attender whom they know has molested at least one person.

Adam is not enduring or proactive here  there is an absence of him praying and expecting God to do something to separate the churches like Adam wants, and we see him fail in his earlier confrontations with Darren  but he is instead reactive and jumps at the opportunity to use molestation as a way to manipulate the other congregation into leaving.  Seeing clergy belittle sexual assault that happens openly in their midst and then thanking the perpetrator for it for furthering their agenda is simply not funny.  Its actually too real a depiction (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spotlight-Blu-ray-DVD-Digital-HD/dp/B019NB5EVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spotlight (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital HD)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Invisible-War/dp/B008MIYKLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Invisible War</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hunting-Ground-The/dp/B0169JWTI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hunting Ground, The</a>).  Is this show a comedy?  Then make me laugh and keep laughing.  Is this show a drama?  Then have comedy and seriousness in the right places.

For those of you reading this who have been sexually assaulted to include molestation or something else, Im sorry it happened to you, it was not your fault no matter who you talked to, were nice to, smiled at, sat by, or what you did or didn't know at the time, or if clergy or another leader didn't care.  I wrote this review for you to say that you matter.  If someone else is reading this and thinks its overkill, I hope its because something like this hasn't happened to you or anyone you care about.",1465171200,2,4491,5.126373626373627

4194503,5,B003U6GZUA,This is such a great show!  It entertains as well as educates and inspires.  Tom Hollander and Olivia Colman are simply fantastic as is the supporting cast.  It's an amazing series that I believe is relevant to viewers from atheists to devout believers of all denominations.  Bravo to the writers and actors!,1462752000,,308,4.865384615384615

4194505,1,B003U6GZUA,"I adore Tom Hollander, but this isn't my kind of humor, a bit too broad.",1462406400,,72,3.8666666666666667
4194506,4,B003U6GZUA,"This series is about an Anglican priest, but it is not exactly what I'd call irreverent, especially for a British show. Rather, it's questioning and ""real"" and it has a lot of humor, too. Adam Smallbone is the vicar of St. Saviour's in the Marshes. It may have been in the marshes once, but now it's a London inner-city parish suffering from congregation decline.

Adam has only been there a month. He moved from a cozy rural Suffolk parish with his supportive but no-nonsense wife, Alexandra, who works as a legal aide lawyer. Other regular cast include Nigel, Adam's serious-minded curate, Colin, semi-homeless and given to pithy observations, and Adoha, a loyal congregant known for rapturous responses.

Adam believes, don't get me wrong, but he is not pedantic or self-righteous. One of my favorite episodes is where popular evangelical Pastor Darren uses St. Saviour's while his church is being remodeled.  Darren is big on the catch phrases but his smile never reaches his eyes. After the first service, Adam tells Darren he doesn't want him back:
Darren, barely suppressing a sneer: ""What exactly is the problem, Adam? We're all partners in the Gospel, aren't we?""
Adam: ""But the thing is, I don't necessarily think that Jesus is absolutely the answer to every single question.""
Darren: ""He is, though.""
Adam: ""Well, I don't think so, I'm afraid. I think that faith must encounter doubt, and all I get from you is certainty.""
... Darren: ""OUR God is a success."" And he doesn't mean Adam Smallbone's God.

The Archdeacon, consummate politician that he has to be in that job, for once comes through for Adam. Which is a change, because many times his comical approach to Adam and his parish leave you wondering. Such as when he chides Adam on attendance: ""You know how the wealthy parishes grumble when their money subsidizes empty churches.""
Another good episode is ""The Rival"", where a popular radio preacher (played by Hugh Bonneville) makes an appearance. At least the rival has his own doubts. It's a very interesting episode.

""Rev. Season 1"" first aired in 2010 with 6 episodes. They total 180 minutes of thoughtful and humorous television. The DVD set shows the episodes in 16:9 aspect ratio and Dolby Digital 2.0 sound. English subtitles are available. There are no bonus features on the DVD set.

In the U.S. it would be rated ""R"" for language and situations, but it's tame if compared to an American movie.

Adam talks to God: ""I know, deep down, of course, that if God make his existence clear and irrefutable, it would overwhelm us and deprive us all of free will and independence. But, right now, just for once, now I feel like being overwhelmed.""

As an Episcopal/Anglican priest, lots of this resonates and you always have to try to find the humor, like telling the workmen to f---off! Laughed till I cried! Yep, the Church can be funny and we have to laugh ta ourselves. Wherever you find humans, you had better be ready to laugh. This is better than the Vicar of Dibley (though the V of D cast was superb, and who can top funny woman Dawn French?) because it is more believable and the situations are situations I run into!

4194528,4,B003U6GZUA,It's interesting to me that Tom Hollander is one of the developers of this show.  It certainly seems to show accurately the sad condition of the church in England today.  It also poses interesting questions.  I feel that it might not fly in the US where the question of the Rev's true faith would horrify the US zealots but as an English person I find it worth watching.,1404777600,3,370,4.411764705882353

This is the first TV show that nails a pastor's life spot on. The producers really ""get it"" in terms of the constant and crazy challenges of contemporary parish life. Adam is also perfect in his vacillation between very human emotions and a genuine trust in God to see him through. On top of all that, it is simply hilarious at times and poignant at others.

8405663,5,B003U6GZUA,"Happened upon this series, and fell in love with it. Tom Hollander, plays The Reverend Adam Smallbone, the Vicar Of a Church that is failing financially and in every other manner you can think. His wife played by Olivia Colman as the Mes Vicarage, as she is called is tremendous. Both of these actors play characters unknown to us, very humorous at times and very sad at others.

Essentially, the Church is put on trial. This is a Church like no other, few members who are all characters and all need the Vicar in one way or another. A homeless gent played by Steve Evets, a Church assistant played by Miles Jupp, an older woman who needs the Church, played by Ellen Thomas, and the next highest priest in the hierarchy, played by Simon McBurney. Other people come and go but these are the best. You will grow to love them as the Vicar does. 3 seasons, and it seems the third is the last.
