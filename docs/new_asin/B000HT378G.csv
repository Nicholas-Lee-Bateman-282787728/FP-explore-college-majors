8141143,5,B000HT378G,"I saw Mark Britton about a decade ago and bought his DVD and CD to show to my friends.  He is a fantastic comedian who will keep you laughing throughout the entire show.

This particular DVD has some of his best skits on it, and is a particular favorite of mine and my family.",1420761600,,276,4.092592592592593
8141144,5,B000HT378G,"Even though I recorded it in 2005!

I hope to attempt to get it on Netflix this year. But I digress.... I dunno how they have ""NEW"" copies as I am the only one who had the new copies... Unless the printing company kept some back to distribute themselves (that'd be just wrong if they did that).  Anyways, if you get this, it's always great to compare it to my newest release on here so that you can see the evolution of a real, true touring road standup comic.  My newest is listed under ""kidwok"" or ""chinaman"".  Thanks for taking the itme to read this! NINJAZ4LIF3.",1391731200,,566,4.311320754716981
8141145,5,B000HT378G,"Side-splitting funny!!  Chinaman pokes fun at music, movies, and menus.  Hot dog fried rice?  Why not?  I watch this DVD again and again, and it never gets old...",1383350400,,162,4.678571428571429
8141146,5,B000HT378G,"What can I say. 4 movies. Lots of violence. Horrendous acting. Yet, sitting down to watch these with a couple of friends we had a lot of laughs. Don't buy if you are looking for serious acting or quality story, etc. But then again, what ninja movie in the 80s/90s was like that? :P",1291334400,4,281,4.222222222222222
