8319278,4,B001LO0Z36,"Even when the jokes are lame, the nudity tame and the timing not quite on the game, ""Miss Nympet's Zap-In"" is a treat for the title alone. Directed pseudonymously by Herschell Gordon Lewis in 1970, it is a sexy take on the popular Rowan and Martin's ""Laugh-In"" TV program. The entire cast is having fun in this, probably the best of the burlesque films. It must have been a fun shoot. Catchy music from the director's Robert Lewis is a welcome contribution.

Thank goodness someone dug up this long-lost nudie classic. How did they do it? I have been wondering about this film for more than 30 years. I first read about in Flynn and McCarthy's excellent movie history, ""Kings of the Bs"" in 1979.

Congratulations yet again to the remarkable Something Weird video company. Their retrieval of long-forgotten exploitation and grindhouse films is a valuable contribution to movie history.

If you haven't discovered the films of Herschell Gordon Lewis you are really missing something.",1275177600,7,981,4.933333333333334
