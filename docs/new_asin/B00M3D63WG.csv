8669992,5,B00M3D63WG,This is a very helpful tool for caregivers.  I wish I had known about it when my husband was first diagnosed with FTD.  I have learned some of my reactions to certain scenarios have been wrong even though I thought I was doing the right thing.  Now I have a much better understanding.  I highly recommend this DVD if you have a loved one that has FTD.  It is a horrible disease and this information will make it more manageable when you understand what is actually happening to the brain.,1494806400,3,488,4.377777777777778

8669999,5,B00M3D63WG,"Very informative.  Very helpful.  Teepa keeps her audience engaged and learning.  And the information she imparts is invaluable.  I highly recommend this DVD set to professional caregivers and to family members alike - especially if your loved one has experienced loss in the areas of impulse control, initiating tasks, completing a sequence of tasks, or understanding and producing speech.

These DVDs will help you understand WHY your loved one is changing and will give you practical techniques to reduce your own stress while providing the best help for your loved one.  After watching these two DVDs (3 hrs.) I am requiring the entire staff of my assisted living facility to watch them.",1413331200,4,691,5.125

I was at the seminar and also had the opportunity to speak with here at break time.  I was very enlightend when I left there. My husband has Frontal Temporal Dimentia and it really helped to understand the journey. I bought the DVD""S to help along the way.",1410566400,6,369,4.545454545454546
