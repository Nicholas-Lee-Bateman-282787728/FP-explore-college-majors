7923132,3,B00004TX4A,Please don't purchase this film on DVD at all. Instead get the VHS because it is great and much better,1212537600,,102,4.15
7923133,5,B00004TX4A,"I know I know, this film is just as old as the way I remembered it when I was growing up but I can tell you that it is a great kung fu film to watch. This is like pre Jackie Chan/Jet Li kinda film. Give it a try. I guarantee that you will love it.",1212537600,2,247,3.4285714285714284
7923134,4,B00004TX4A,"I usually agree with that ""Morgoth Dude"", however with this one I must dis-agree.  I too have approximately 240 of these old school kung fu movies, and I feel this particular one ""5 Element fung Fu"",,is not entirely that bad.  Infact it's pretty decent.  Lots and lots of old school kung fu fights.  The story is pretty good and equally inportant, the DVD transfer acceptable.  Not a bad put out from the Wu Tang Crew.  I purchased this movie for approximatly $3.96 (Canadian)at Walmart here in Toronto,,and I would have paid $10.00,,it would have been worth it!!",1149552000,3,563,4.752577319587629
7923135,4,B00004TX4A,"You can buy this ALOT cheaper than advertised here and for either price its a good deal. Especially for Kung Fu Fans. No scence in telling the plot funner for you to find out, and i see so many of these flix i may get it half way confused with another film. But i do no this is a pretty good one with some good fight scenes hang in there for the final battles and you'll get your Kung FU craving all satisfied!",1082851200,,410,3.9518072289156625
7923136,3,B00004TX4A,"This movie has a lot going for it, and also has a lot of thisngs that hold it back.  First off i think the story is an interesting idea.  The story follows Cheng San Feng (the creator of Tai Chi Chuan), as a young man studing as a disciple at Shaolin Temple.  It shows how Feng learned Shaolin style which he would latter use to develop Tai Chi.  Its your classic revenge plot so its entertaining.  It has some good fight scenes, two that stand out are the last scene and the resturant scene. Ok now the bad points.  The fighting is good but suffers from alot of camera cuts breaking up the action.  The begining is a little difficult to understand until about halfway through. The movie also has some scene with some pretty bad camera work, many times cutting out one of the characters.  Overall its a good middle grade Kung Fu movie.  Also features the C.R.E.A.M. Wu-Tang clan music video.",1040428800,3,891,4.41717791411043
7923137,2,B00004TX4A,The title made me think of mystery of chess boxing featuring ghostface killer. No where near that level. This movie could have been better. Pretty sinister villian that uses the Black Palm technique. Good end fight. but it was too much like Invincible Armor.,1005177600,,258,4.886363636363637
7923138,3,B00004TX4A,"Good story, great action, and a neat final showdown, with some creative  styles and shapes.",969062400,,91,5.066666666666666
