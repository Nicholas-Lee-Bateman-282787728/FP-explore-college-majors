I would much more like the program to be an DVD but I am happy to get it any way I can. Peter Ustinov did two presentations of this type. The other was Mozart Mystique. That show has not been available for any years and I have searched for it for many years. Ustinov has a very special way of telling the story of Haydn (and Mozart), but the real value of this recording is the quantity of music. I have a The Great Courses offering of Haydn and it lacks the music available in this offering. In fact the music in this piece is of several performing groups, something lacking in the Great Course presentation.",1401667200,,746,4.26056338028169
8223539,5,B000WIDMLY,"Sadly, this wonderful 1994 program about the life and music of Franz Josef Haydn (1732-1809) is no longer available other than through a single, vastly overpriced copy of a VHS tape here. This is a great loss to music lovers that enjoy visual arts, for this is a masterpiece of music, history and humor that more than capably exemplifies everything there is to know about the life and music of Papa Haydn.

The late Peter Ustinov is commentator for the program, first visiting Haydn's birthplace in Rohrau, in rural Austria near Hungary, and making the link between Haydn's German upbringing and the Hungarian connection to his music that would later grow exponentially through his decades-long service to the Hungarian Esterhazy family.

This program includes a great many oustanding performances of Haydn's music by now famous performers including conductor Adam Fischer and the Austro-Hungarian Orchestra performing symphonies, conductor Peter Schreier leading The Creation, the Takacs Quartet, and pianist Israela Margalit, who also wrote the script, playing the piano sonatas. One of my favorite performances is a cello concerto by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miklos-Perenyi/dp/B00005YMO9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miklos Perenyi</a>.

My favorite visuals have Ustinov's discussing the Farewell symphony, No. 45, that Haydn wrote to let the prince know it was time to give the players a vacation so they could be with their families. In the sequence, the players depart one-by-one until one two remain playing at the end. In another sequence, Ustinov portrays a falling asleep listener awakened by the famous note in the ""Surprise"" Symphony No. 94.

This is the best program I've seen about Haydn by far and its absence is an incalculable loss. Internet evidence indicates PBS produced it; the Arts & Entertainment cable channel broadcast it back in the days when A&E actually carried artistic programming before it became enamored with cleaned-up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sopranos/dp/B002OID4VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sopranos</a>&nbsp;reruns,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hoarders/dp/B0039ZBM0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hoarders</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gene-Simmons-Family-Jewels/dp/B000VWQTVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gene Simmons Family Jewels</a>&nbsp;and similar programming.

Thankfully, I taped it from A&E and burned my tape to DVD so I can watch it whenever I want. If you've never seen ""Celebrating Haydn,"" here's your chance until a company like Musical Heritage Society someday buys the rights and makes it available again.",1312934400,3,2751,6.6305555555555555
