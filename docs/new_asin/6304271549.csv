825755,5,6304271549,"They say hell is repetition, and this may be what Bava had in mind when he crafted the story to this film, Lisa and The Devil.  Haunting, erotic, at times violent, and almost completely hallucinatory, this indeed is the stuff-the modus operati if you will,from which the devil indeed works. The deeper into the movie the viewer is allowed to journey the more the discovery that, like the onion, there is no real center once all the layers have been stripped back.
  First and foremost, this is Telly Savalas's film.  As far as I'm concerned, it's one of his finest moments on screen the way he so suavely portrays refined evil.  He gets all the good lines:  ""What does tradition mean to a poor devil like me?  Work and fatigue!""
  Trying to understand the film, however, is another matter.  I've seen this film three times and I still am none the wiser.  One way to look at it, since Savalas's character is blatently the devil and is very much in control the entire time, is that he works with the manequins out of boredom.  He manipulates them like wind-up toys, gives them a little illusory feeling of freewill and then sits back and watches the particular scenario of the moment play itself out.
  Having seen many of Bava's other films, I know well enough by now that many of his films are about the style, and that any substance is strictly up to the viewer to determine.  But what style!  Every successive shot after the opening credits is a fascinating excursion into funereal worlds of claustrophobia and flashback and altered states of consciousness.  One of my favorite scenes is when Lisa is creeping closer to Leonardo's chaple/workshop.  This is Bava at his finest, because it is not the seen with which he scares us so well, but the what we thought we almost saw that will stay in our minds long after that airplane has complete its journey.
  The version I viewed was the Image release of 2000.  There are no extras.  The Anchor Bay video release I own had two deleted scenes.  I'm not sure, but I believe the extended scene of violence is included.  The sound quality is wretched.  Even with my headphones on, I was hard put to hear well.  The transfer itself is so-so.  At times you can see the wear and tear on the film edges.
  None of this should deter you,however, from enjoying the film for the masterpiece of Bava's it is.",1019088000,,2345,4.543062200956938
825756,3,6304271549,"Mario Babas works always have a specific atmosphere. This work also is one of his films, which is in his style. Furthermore, Telly Sallas who really looks like a devil played in this film. Actually, story of this film is not interesting, but other effects are good. People were killed in a mansion, which is with spirit of devil. Some scenes and ideas of this film are similar to Psycho, first of all, the murderer who cannot forget the lover, he remain the body of his lover in the room in spite of she was already dead. Then he kills people. Frankly speaking, there are some unreasonable scenes, which are not necessary. Sometimes, it is absurd and is not connected with the plot; finally, it makes the film to be not thrilling. This is a vulnerable point of this film. Usually, Italian horror films have some splendid effects for vision and sound but the plot is weak and stubborn. This film also shows features of Italian horrors directly.",1003017600,,943,4.619047619047619
825757,3,6304271549,"Often when reviewed by ""professionals"" this film is refered to as lacking in a comprehensible plot.  This is probably a misconception passed on through reviewers who have not seen the complete film ( it has been chopped up and reconcieved into different versions ) or ( more likely ) are simply passing along information from other reviews made on these earlier versions.
This goes to show that most customer reviews will probably be supeior to the ones offered by these professional guides ( do we think for moment that Lenord Maltin, or even his assisstants, have seen a fourth of the movies in these ""books"" ).
The plot is pretty straight foward ""ghost-dream-in-haunted-house.""  It is an excellent movie ( personally I don't think it is Mr. Bava's best, but in no way does that mean that it is not worth seeing ).  Fans seeking ""giallo"" horror will probably be disapointed, it lacks the over the top gore and surrealism that are the staples of that genre.  Fans of ""Hammer studios"" style horror will love it: it is beautifully shot, atmospheric, and for a horror film well acted: in general higher quality actors usually find themselves playing villians in horror films, they are usually the better roles and do not require the amount of ""traditional good looks"" that is required of the other actors, and european horror films most definately go for pretty faces ( why not it's probably going to be dubbed by bad actors anyway ).",1000252800,2,1432,4.7854251012145745
825758,4,6304271549,"In the liner notes of Lisa And The Devil/The House Of Exorcism Alfredo Leone ask Mario Bava that if Mario had carte blanche (a blank check), what movie would he make? His answer was this movie, Lisa And The Devil, which is Bava's most personal film.
Lisa (Elke Sommer) is a foreigner in a tourist group (it's never explained what country she's from, or what country they're visiting). While admiring a fresco of the devil (which looks amazingly like Telly Savalas), she hears music and is drawn to it, abandoning the tourist group in the process. This leads her to a man(Telly Savalas) carrying a life-sized dummy. Lisa recognizes him as the devil from the painting and from this moment on the viewer is taken for a nightmarish journey that's hard to tell which is actually real or a hallucination. Not that the end result is a mess, far from it; it is remarkable how Bava holds such a non-linear plot together so well where other filmakers before and since failed and it's easy to see why this is Bava's favorite film. The cast ensemble is excellent and so is the direction. It's definitely one of his best.
Unfortunately Leone couldn't find a distributor for this film. Seeing the success of The Exorcist, Leone had Bava reshoot some scenes that had Lisa ""posessed"" (spouting profanities, spewing pea soup, and so on). Bava balked at filming material he felt was blasphemous, so he walked and Leone finished filming the scenes, edited them into Lisa And The Devil, and called it The House Of Exorcism. The end result is really pathetic and an insult to Mario Bava's movie. There is an audio commentary with Leone and Elke Sommer which is enjoyable and provides some of the information in making Lisa And The Devil but mostly tries to justify the filming of The House Of Exorcism. In my opinion he fails.
The DVD special features include beside the commentary, a Mario Bava biography, Bava's and the cast filmographies, a theatrical trailer for Lisa and the Devil, two theatrical trailers for House Of Exorcism (whoopee), a deleted softcore sex scene between Silva Koscina and Gabriele Tinti, a photo and poster gallery, and liner notes by Bava scholar Tim Lucas. Too bad there wasn't an audio commentary by Tim Lucas on Lisa And The Devil; his knowledge is incredible and he's always interesting to listen to.
As bad as House Of Exocism is, I still recommend getting this DVD not only for comparison's sake but for the Leone/Sommer commentary. Otherwise, get the Lisa And The Devil DVD which is available seperately.",987292800,11,2518,4.777522935779817
825759,4,6304271549,"Lisa and the Devil
This movie opens with Lisa and a tour group viewing an ancient fresco of the devil on a wall in a quaint little Italian town. Lisa wanders away from the group and sees a man who looks like the picture of the devil in the fresco. Everything goes to hell from that moment on.
The cast consists of Italian actors mostly unknown to me, except Lisa is played by Elke Sommer and Liandro\Satan is played by Telly Savalas. The other characters are a young man who looks much like a satyr, his mother, a rich couple and their chauffer, and a mystery man.
The bad part about this film is that Elke Sommer couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, but she is very beautiful and I suspect that was the merit on which she was cast because although she's in almost every scene, she really doesn't have that many lines. She's the beautiful victim, the screamer, a face-maker, and a sounding board for the rest of the cast. Fortunately the rest of the film is well-cast with actors who do a good job in presenting this tale.
The good part is that this is the most successful attempt at filming a nightmare that I've ever seen. Although the plot is linear in progression, the logic behind each scene is dream logic. Strange and unusual events occur, but the characters seem to accept these events without hesitation and try to keep moving forward with what they're handed. Murder and mayhem abound, all in the context of surreal horror. I suspect if Fellini would have made horror films, it would have looked much like this. Toward the end, the audience is given something that looks like an explanation for events, but it's a sham and a ruse and the audience knows there will be no happy ending for these damned.
Bava gives us beautifully filmed, fun to look at movies. It's not only the narrative that intrigues. I haven't seen everything Bava has done, but I've liked everything I've seen so far.
I give it four and a half toe tags.",986688000,3,1936,4.441011235955056

Only to say that the extra scenes (ie the sex scene between Alessio Orano & Elke Sommer, and Sylva Koscina's protracted demise) are there.  They are not included as extra  footage as in the original LD,  but Alfredo Leone (producer) included them  in the ""bastardized"" House of Exorcism.  This film is not the  best film to start an interest in Euro-art house/trash, or in Mario Bava,  but it is fantastic none the less.  Please make sure if you are not aware,  that you watch Lisa and the Devil first, and not House of Exorcism as it  might jaundice your opinions of the maestro at work.

825761,4,6304271549,"The new Double-DVD of Mario Bava's great LISA AND THE DEVIL and it's re-edited abomination version HOUSE OF EXORCISM is a must for euro-horror fans.  Bava's original version of LISA is one of the best lyrical  euro-horror films ever.  The presentation here looks just like the old  ELITE laserdisc which also suffered from some slight digital  artifacting...nothing awful, but it isn't perfect.  Everything about this  move is great- the music, the style, just the general feel of it...it's  also completely unconventional.  Of course, than there's the re-edited  HOUSE OF EXORCISM version which added new ""exorcist"" type scenes  and rearranged the film to make it accessible to audiences in the mid-70's.  It's bad, of course, but it's great to have both versions together to see  exactly how the film was damaged by the re-edit....this DVD in a way is the  euro-trash fan's version of the Criterion ""Brazil"" DVD!  As  far as extras go, the DVD unfortunately does not have 2 alternate scenes  that were on the ELITE LD - one being an alternate extra gory scene of  Silva Koscina's death and the other an alternate erotic scene between Elke  and Orano.  The DVD does contain the extra 'unfinished' softcore sex  scene, though, so why the other 2 scenes were left off is strange and  disappointing.  Other extras include the uncompleted L&TD trailer  (also on the LD) plus 2 trailers for HOE.  There's a very minimal  ""photo/poster gallery"" (lasts 23 seconds! ) and some minimal  filmos and bios.

825901,5,6304271549,"This exquisite Bava work makes it easily onto my list of very favorite films. It is too subtle, serious, and non-linear to ever be a popular film and it is obvious that Bava was not aiming for such status. He was making a film that he, as an artist, would like watching himself.

This film has a foundation concept that is beautifully unfolded: All of the characters are doomed from the beginning. They are writhing in the inescapable grip of fate, but that fate is itself spun out of the desires, choices, and actions of the characters.  The film has the feel of a beautifully colored ritualistic dream-like spinning of wheels that go nowhere but into ever deeper darkness. The activity of the characters is horrible, agonizing, and empty at once. And the master stroke here is the characterization of the Devil who presides over them. He is never hurried or concerned about his nightmarish task of gathering the characters into their doom. He is calmly busy and amused throughout. He has a certain vulgarity that is clearly only the actual vulgarity of the characters that imagine they are sophisticated and even romantically noble in their unquenchable desires. The Devils comically blas progression through the story is only the emptiness of the frenzied mannequin characters.

Many viewers of this film get frustrated with the story line that is like a knot they cant untangle, as though untangling it would clarify the film for them. But that is to miss the mark here.  The story-knot can in fact be untied with patient repeated watching of the film, but doing so doesnt clarify anything because that is not the essence of the film.  The apparent mess of the story line is the mess of their lives which have been hopelessly warped by their desires, choices, and actions and the thick romantic veneer that seals them into doom (wonderfully voiced by the score).  This film feels at first like a shapeless dream, but it is a vision more real than the waking consciousness of the characters that cant wake up from themselves.  Im afraid its all too late, my friend.

I would like to note also that this film contains some of the most masterful use of color that Bava ever employed.  The moment of the deaths head in a wedding shawl of green and white is fabulous.

Im not trying to sell the film any more than it tries to sell itself. It is what it is. Take it or leave it. I take it and treasure it.

The House of Exorcism is not even worth talking about except as a criminal act of commercial philistinism.",1440201600,2,2511,4.632882882882883

A haunting air of menace pervades the entire movie and the soundtrack perfectly maintains the mood throughout. The lush cinematography makes it a gorgeous and fascinating journey with a shadowy mansion and the labyrinth of Italian streets particularly foreboding. Many images evoke the paintings of old melancholy paperback covers. Elke Sommer is perfectly cast as the 'damsel in distress' and her plight unfolds in fine fashion via Bava's masterful direction. The atmosphere is thick here and the lighting is very stylistic as is the case with all of Bava's films. In fact some of the best cinematography of the gothic horror subgenre can be found in his movies. There are some racy elements including a scene where Sommers is chloroformed and menaced by a lust crazed villain and indeed a sexual undercurrent pervades the film, but the emphasis is on her gradual descent into a world of isolation and paranoia.

826106,2,6304271549,"In Toledo (Spain, not Ohio), a woman named Lisa wanders away from her tour group after seeing Telly Savalas walking the street carrying a lifesize, human looking puppet.  Lisa is creeped out, and instinctively knows that Telly is up to no good, but does she remain in the relative safety and anonymity of her tour group?  Please, if she did, Mario Bava wouldn't have this delirious, demented mash-up of a film called ""Lisa and the Devil"".  After straying down a few side streets, Lisa, in short order, manages to meet up with Savalas and his puppet again, injure and perhaps kill a man who is getting a little too friendly, and then climbs into an antique limo for a ride with an elderly man, his much younger wife, and her driver/lover. The car has problems and the quartet winds up at an isolated estate in a forest where everyone seems to know Lisa, or at least someone who looks like her.

Trying to describe what follows would be pointless because it's more a feast for the eyes than for the brain.  There are murders, blood and gore, supernatural shenanigans, and necrophilia, but don't be fooled; these parts never add up to a plot. Which is not always a bad thing.  Some of my favorite Italian gialli have come up short on plot points, but have loads of style and suspense.  And I'm a huge fan of Mario Bava, although even the best directors have their off days.  For me, ""Lisa and the Devil"" is Mario Bava's off day.  It's eye candy, but after awhile, it gets tiresome watching these extremely odd people stuck on this crumbling estate, their numbers dwindling as Lisa, herself, meanders around, witnessing various horrors but in no apparent hurry to escape.  Savalas sucks on his trademark lollipop throughout the proceedings, which, while adding a certain camp factor, detracts from whatever menace his character seems meant to exude.  Alida Valli, who revitalized her career playing horror movie villains, is on hand as the blind matriarch of the estate, and she's so deadly serious that she seems to have drifted over from the set of a completely different film, perhaps an Ibsen movie. By the ending, it all seems like a disjointed episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""Night Gallery"".  I've read comparisons of this movie with movies by David Lynch, and while that all may seem logical on paper, or in a thesis, when watching the actual movies, well, there simply is no comparison.  Bava has style to burn, but Lynch has a cinematic elegance that Bava can't touch here.  Lynch's set pieces (in the absence of recognizable or explainable plots) pull you in, his creations (for the most part) are recognizably human; Lisa and her cohorts seem unreal, like characters made up by writers, with little relationship to actual people.  Which may be the point.  See the movie and decide for yourself.",1317254400,,2804,4.738683127572016
826107,1,6304271549,"""The House of Exorcism"" has a long and tortured history. Starring Telly Savalas and Elke Sommer, it was originally made as ""Lisa and the Devil,"" a psychologically challenging horror film by Italian giallo master Mario Bava. Producer Alfredo Leone (under his directorial alias Mickey Lion) removed huge swaths of the original, completely re-edited the film, and shot new (much more graphic) footage of Sommer with Robert Alda as a priest, which it was thought would improve the film's box office revenue in light of the success of ""The Exorcist."" The film bombed.

Watching ""The House of Exorcism"" is like a traumatizing bipolar nightmare. It is clearly two entirely different efforts forced together in unholy celluloid matrimony. The film begins with Elke (as Lisa Reiner) on a European tour, where she sees a scary fresco featuring the devil. She is drawn into a shop where Telly (as Leandro) possesses her while wearing a beret. It's a very creepy and effective beginning to the film, but is quickly ruined by the shift to the sanitarium where Lisa unleashes profanity and vomit on priest Robert Alda and some extreme scenery chewing erupts on both sides of the restraints (""Who are you, you infernal demon!?!"") In a nod to commercialism that Bava refused to contribute to, the film amps up the eros with a return of Alda's former strumpet as temptation from the Devil. To say that this doesn't fit the atmosphere so painstakingly crafted by Bava in the original is an understatement.

Back in the creepy and brilliantly atmospheric home of Maximilian (Alessio Orano) and his mother, the blind Contessa (Alida Valli,) Max covets Lisa due to her resemblance to his dead love. This part of the movie is really, really creepy, and the scene involving the skeleton in particular really grossed me out. Confusing violence and murders begin, but not all is as it seems. There are plenty of unnatural mannequin hijinks, body double diversions, and Telly talking to himself nonstop, providing some backstory that doesn't fit this version of the movie well at all. Note also Telly's near-constant use of a lollipop, which he used in real life to help him quit smoking; it would become his trademark on ""Kojak"" very shortly after this was released. After some truly Oedipal violence, and some more exorcism nonsense from Alda and Sommer, the film comes to an uneasy conclusion. It couldn't come a minute too soon.

The film is like night and day. The original Bava footage is that of a stylish and reserved film full of mental horror, genuine suspense, and subtlety. The added exorcism footage that was spliced in, on the other hand, is profane, gross, derivative junk (Robert Alda even gets to battle flying snakes) that does nothing but ruin the work of a genuine master of the art. While it can be difficult to find, look for a copy of ""Lisa and the Devil"" in its original form and watch the film the way Mario Bava envisioned it.",1286668800,2,2926,4.859719438877756

The film begins with Elke (as Lisa Reiner) on a European tour, where she sees a scary fresco featuring the devil. She is drawn into a shop where Telly (as Leandro) possesses her while wearing a beret. It's a very creepy and effective beginning to the film, but is quickly ruined by the shift to the sanitarium where Lisa unleashes profanity and vomit on priest Robert Alda and some extreme scenery chewing erupts on both sides of the restraints (""Who are you, you infernal demon!?!"") In a nod to commercialism that Bava refused to contribute to, the film amps up the eros with a return of Alda's former strumpet as temptation from the Devil. To say that this doesn't fit the atmosphere so painstakingly crafted by Bava in the original is an understatement.

Back in the creepy and brilliantly atmospheric home of Maximilian (Alessio Orano) and his mother, the blind Contessa (Alida Valli,) Max covets Lisa due to her resemblance to his dead love. This part of the movie is really, really creepy, and the scene involving the skeleton in particular really grossed me out. Confusing violence and murders begin, but not all is as it seems. There are plenty of unnatural mannequin hijinks, body double diversions, and Telly talking to himself nonstop, providing some backstory that doesn't fit this version of the movie well at all. Note also Telly's near-constant use of a lollipop, which he used in real life to help him quit smoking; it would become his trademark on ""Kojak"" very shortly after this was released. After some truly Oedipal violence, and some more exorcism nonsense from Alda and Sommer, the film comes to an uneasy conclusion. It couldn't come a minute too soon.

The film is like night and day. The original Bava footage is that of a stylish and reserved film full of mental horror, genuine suspense, and subtlety. The added exorcism footage that was spliced in, on the other hand, is profane, gross, derivative junk (Robert Alda even gets to battle flying snakes) that does nothing but ruin the work of a genuine master of the art. While it can be difficult to find, look for a copy of ""Lisa and the Devil"" in its original form and watch the film the way Mario Bava envisioned it.",1286668800,2,2926,4.859719438877756

826110,2,6304271549,"Lisa and the Devil (1973) and The House of Exorcism (1975) are variants of the same Mario Bava horror film.  Lisa and the Devil was intended to be one of his more personal horror tales, but it's subtleties (at least for a horror film) were associated with little popularity and the film was a big money loss for its producers.  Trying to recoup their losses, the studio re-edited the film, shot a bunch of new footage and changed the plotline to cash in on the popularity of The Exorcist, resulting in The House of Exorcism.

Lisa and the Devil is largely a mood piece in which a young woman wanders through a confused gothic landscape and mansion for which she has some sort of unexplained, supernatural connection.  There are a lot of beautiful images and creepy set ups, but what might have been a great horror film is sabotaged by some very uneven acting, lousy dubbing, heavy-handed use of music, and fairly predictable plotline excesses.  The gratuitous violence is to be expected in a Bava film, but it winds up solely gratuitous and not shocking.

If about a third of ""Lisa"" was edited out, removing some of the worst acting and plot cliches, the film would be more effective, especially emphasizing the disorienting, surreal mood that hints at a dreamlike logic.

As flawed as Lisa and the Devil is, House of Exorcism bombs beyond belief.  With scenes almost literally copied from The Exorcist, complete with chapped lips and green vomit, the film clumsily tries to integrate newly filmed demon possession sequences with footage from ""Lisa"".  The acting is even more stilted and the compositions and visual design lack Bava's visual flair.  Even if you enjoy films that are ""so bad they're good"", this just winds up being dull and annoying.  One can sympathize with the producers, who cut this mess together because ""Lisa"" generated no interest with distributors -- ""House"" wound up making some box office dollars.  Perhaps its greatest notoriety now is that Woody Allen showed a clip of it in Annie Hall, cracking a joke that the film was proof perfect that society was coming to an end.",1197244800,2,2097,4.794444444444444
826111,4,6304271549,"Lisa and the Devil is one of those wacky horror films that doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense, but it's bizarre, stylish and just coherent enough to be an interesting ride.  It involves a tourist who's entryway into one goofyass night is a painting of the devil she sees in a village square.  After the painting, she runs into Telly Savalas(he looks like the devil in the painting), who's carrying and talking to a giant doll.  Then she runs into an old love of hers(who looks like the doll Savalas was carrying), accidentally kills him, and hitches a ride with a rich couple and their driver(who's also banging the wife).  The car breaks down in front of a mansion owned by a blind woman, her son, and their butler....Telly Savalas!!  From that point on, it's one bizarre night of hallucinations and murder and sex and dolls and lollipops.  This isn't one of those movies that throws a bunch of weird stuff at you and then slaps you in the face with an explanation in the closing minutes.  It does through you little helpful hints here and there so you're not completely lost or anything.  As strange and vague as the movie is, I wouldn't exactly call it hard to follow.  But in the end, you'll most likely have more questions than answers(unless you're one of those high falootin' film snobs who seems to have an answer for everything).  You won't be able to deny it was unique though!  This is one of my favorite Bava films.  It kinda sets the tone for similar ""dream logic"" horror films that would come out of Italy in the later years like Argento's Inferno or Fulci's The Beyond.  Needless to say the modern filmgoer will chalk this one up to being pointless and stupid.  Hey, at least it's quite unlikely this will get remade!",1184371200,,1739,4.514376996805112

This is considered by some to be cult favorite Mario Bava's masterpiece, although the producers thought it was so non-commercial they insisted Bava shoot new scenes and re-edit it to make it into a more traditional horror flick.  Probably a wise choice, because the director's cut is more pretentious and confusing than frightening.

  Still, it looks good, Savalas seems to be having a ball playing a butler/Devil, and Elke Sommer is gorgeous.  If your taste in horror turns away from slash and gore and towards the visual and contemplative LISA AND THE DEVIL may satisfy.",1091836800,3,767,4.906976744186046
826186,5,6304271549,"This DVD double feature of LISA AND THE DEVIL and the remix HOUSE OF EXORCISM is the only way to see Mario Bava's masterpiece! Anyway, LISA AND THE DEVIL is a dazzling horror movie made the only way that Mario Bava could possibly direct it. It's like PSYCHO by way of the Brothers Grimm: Lisa Reiner (Elke Sommer), a tourist lost in Toledo, Spain, encounters a blind Contessa and her unbalanced son and their lollipop-sucking butler (Telly ""Kojak"" Savalas), along with a whole mess of bizarre occurances. This movie defies all logical explaination; you must see it to believe it. Telly Savalas is the highlight of the movie; he steals every scene he appears in (This is where he discovered what would become Kojak's trademark!).
As for HOUSE OF EXORCISM, it is one of the better Italian imitations of THE EXORCIST, with a great performance by Robert Alda as the priest who must deal with a possessed Lisa. Unfortunately, the re-editing takes away much of the mysticism of LISA and often comes off as ridiculously humorous. However, this movie comes with a commentary by Sommer and producer Alfredo Leone which is a must for Bavaphiles and film buffs alike.
Of all the Mario Bava movies that have come out on DVD that I own, I have to say that LISA AND THE DEVIL/HOUSE OF EXORCISM is the most essential. I also recommend the following: Dario Argento's SUSPIRIA, Lucio Fulci's THE BEYOND, Don Coscarelli's PHANTASM, and of course, Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD. In fact, watch all of these together for some real spooky horror-movie fun!",1081814400,4,1531,4.781132075471698
826187,5,6304271549,"I found ""House of Exorcism"" more entertaining than ""Lisa and the Devil"".  The possession scenes by Elke Sommer are quite amusing, adding some humor to the proceedings.  Also, it is sexier than ""Lisa"" (including Elke Sommer's scene) which enhanced the viewing and the pacing is great, while ""Lisa"" moves along at the speed of a pbs documentary. The Catholic Priest character is lacking in ""Lisa"", but does give the movie more of a plot.  It does jump around somewhat, but then ""Lisa"" doesn't make a whole lot of sense itself.  All in all ""House of Exorcism"" is the preferred version.",1079740800,3,582,4.79
826188,5,6304271549,"Italian director Mario Bava (1914-1980) is one of the giants of the horror film genre. His films, no matter what the plot, always promised great style mixed with scenes of murder and mayhem. Bava's big break into the industry came with his 1960 black and white classic ""Black Sunday"" starring fan favorite Barbara Steele. This was only the beginning, as Bava churned out a series of gruesome shockers over the next seventeen years. Perhaps Mario's biggest contribution to the horror field was his 1972 picture ""Twitch of the Death Nerve,"" also known as ""Bay of Blood."" It doesn't take too long to realize ""Friday the 13th"" shamelessly cribbed from Bava's bloodbath. The director's inventiveness goes far beyond hacking up a few unfortunate souls, however, as ""Lisa and the Devil,"" a movie which first appeared on our shores in a radically altered form called ""The House of Exorcism,"" shows. This movie is a wildly inventive jaunt into the inner recesses of the mind of a tortured woman. The Bava legacy continued with son Lamberto, one of the guiding lights behind ""Demons,"" an instant cult favorite with gorehounds worldwide.
Tourist Lisa (Elke Sommer) finds herself in an increasing series of ultra horrific and bizarre circumstances after viewing a huge mural on the side of a building in an Italian town. After looking at the picture, she wonders off into the heart of the old city where she soon encounters a man (Telly Savalas) wearing a beret who exactly resembles the figure in the painting. Horrified at the similarities between this man and the painting, Lisa flees and wanders aimlessly until a husband and wife pick her up in their ancient automobile. The car breaks down near a dark, creepy looking estate where none other than the man Lisa saw earlier works as the butler/head servant. The family living at the home agrees to allow the stranded travelers access to the house in order to phone for assistance. It quickly becomes apparent that things are not what they seem inside the walls of this sprawling estate. Over a socially awkward dinner served on a table the size of a football field, weird activities take place. The family doesn't seem to get along all that well and there is some peculiar importance attached to a chocolate cake with sprinkles (!). Lisa eventually discovers that a family member delivers the cake to a locked bedroom upstairs, supposedly to a member of the family who permanently lives in this room.
Meanwhile, the man and wife who helped Lisa clash over the wife's infidelity, a behavior that will soon have ghastly consequences in this house of horrors. As for Savalas, he acts the part of butler but also seems a more important figure than his position merits. He spends most of his time wandering around the house startling Lisa, or fiddling around with his human figures made out of wax. Even worse, our hapless heroine witnesses Savalas stuffing a corpse in a coffin in one of the rooms on the estate. This corpse just happens to be a mysterious man Lisa encountered in the town shortly after seeing the painting. He continues to reappear to her in the house and on the grounds of the estate, often seeming to change in age between each encounter. The horrors of the family eventually rise to the surface with the result that Lisa emerges from her dream state and decides to fly back home. But wait! Bava played with your mind for over an hour and he isn't about to let you go this easily. Is Lisa truly free of her nightmare or is she about to enter an even deeper dimension of terror?
On the surface, the film makes little sense. But what appears to be a random mish mash of bizarre scenes actually does assume somewhat of a structure if you pay attention to the first five minutes of the movie. It is my opinion that the bizarre painting Lisa sees on a trip to Italy provides the viewer with a possible key to deciphering this weird movie. I propose that Sommer's character undergoes a sort of hypnotic interaction with this painting that somehow transports her back in time, a process which then helps explain the following sequences. The movie is a dream or break with reality in the mind of Sommer's character, nothing more or nothing less, and therefore must assume a fractured, nonsensical tone. Isn't it slightly odd that Lisa doesn't have a boyfriend or husband, or if she does he is not with her on this trip? That might explain the mysterious male that seems to have some bizarre link with her character. Perhaps everything we see is part of Lisa's unconscious taking on corporeal form. Whatever is going on, I think it is important we remember that we are seeing events from the perspective of this confused woman and are thus dependent on her cracked perceptions. How can we know what is going on when Lisa herself has little idea of the weirdness swirling about her? I truly enjoyed the film and appreciated Bava's attempts to do something different.
I also liked the performances. Savalas intrigues as the butler/devil, an ominous figure always looming in the background happily tormenting Lisa. Sommer is also a lot of fun to watch as she bumbles from one grim situation to another, even going so far as to shed her clothes in one scene (bless her soul!). The other performers are lesser talents, something we should expect and accept with Italian horror. The DVD recognizes the utter wackiness of this film with a plethora of extras well worth watching. I usually turn up my nose at movies that seek to confuse the audience, but I really enjoyed this one. I can't wait to see the hacked up ""House of Exorcism"" so I can compare the two.

826189,2,6304271549,"Gaudiness, soft focus photography, an overemphasis on zoom shots (especially as far as shocked faces are concerned), awful (stilted) dialogue and a lot of old mansion baroque (seventies style). Reading that you might have mistaken this strange film for a hybrid of ""Love Boat"", ""Murder she Wrote"" (minus an iota of coherence) and, perhaps, a snuff film (well, the sensibility thereof at least). The film does have some merits as an unintentional comedy, and the opening minutes are eerie (before that damned zoom function starts taking a front seat). The constant and consistent zooming in and out and in and out, peripeteia, is more than a little annoying after a while, it spoils the film somewhat. Overall, a decent venture, worth a look if you're into seventies kitsch or want to see what all the fuss was about.

""The face of Satan expresses a quality that reflects the pleasure in evil,"" says the tour guide.  The local villagers also believe that ""only the power of the devil keeps the fresco from ruin.""  Later, Lisa encounters a bald man in a shop who resembles Satan in the fresco.  She later sees him carrying and talking to a dummy he was examining in the shop.
It gets weirder.  Lisa then encounters a living likeness of the dummy, a guy who kind of looks like Omar Sharif, who calls her Elena!  She is very freaked out and flees.  However, she is unable to find the main square.  She fortunately gets a ride from Francis and Sophia Lehar in a nice classic car resembling a Model A or T.  The car makes its way to a large desolate country mansion, where the butler is none other than the dummy-carrying stranger!  Not only that, a sensitive young man sees her and also calls her Elena!  What is going on here?
""The entire setting is right for a tall tale with a setting of gloom and tradition,"" says Sophia while at dinner.  We have the right ingredients, a dark night, this house, it's all so spooky!""  That about sums up the atmosphere for this movie, where things go from weird to weirder, with a murder that starts the ball of madness rolling.
Lisa And The Devil underwent quite a butchering under American hands, where much of the original was cut, with extra scenes with Robert Alda as Father Michael were added to become House Of Exorcism, which was the original title of Bava's film.  Never fear--this is the original uncut version.
Also included after the movie are three scenes cut as they were thought to be too explicit for a ""mainstream horror film"":  an explicit sex scene, the more gory parts of a murder, and a bedroom scene.  Including these things in the final cut might have spiced things up just a wee bit.
If the love theme to the movie is familiar, it is Rodrigo's ""Concierto of Aranjuez,"" the tune forming the highlight of Miles Davis's Sketches Of Spain.  Of the performers, Telly Savalas comes off best as the lollipop-sucking Leandro the butler.  Was this a prelude to Kojak, I wonder?  This is his show all the way.  Alessio Orani portrays Maximilian as a tortured soul, a sensitive young man living under the thrall of death.  And yet another sinister role for Alida Valli (the Contessa), best known for coming out in Dario Argento's Suspiria and Inferno.  Despite being pretty, neither Elke Sommer (Lisa) nor Sylvia Koscina (Sophia) shine bright, displaying a hollow, antiseptic beauty.
More a psychological, atmospheric thriller like Black Sunday, but not as good despite being in colour.  It will take at least two or three viewings for the movie to make sense, and given time, one may like this better, but what a twist ending!",1058400000,5,2842,4.606361829025845
