8231913,5,B000YDBPCK,"This is a touching movie, and you will never see the ending coming.  I loved the beach setting and I loved the whole movie.
I recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good simple little foreign film, which I do..",1393977600,,209,4.225
8231914,2,B000YDBPCK,"One of the two primary reasons I was disappointed in the film is because it's somehow marketed alongside gay-themed films.  The second is because it's a dysfunctional look at sexual relationships.  And finally, I didn't like the story.

To my first point, the key players are all straight - the father, the son, his brother, the girlfriend(s), even the best friend.  The only gay theme is finding out the friends father sees a masseuse and engages in sexual activity with another man.  It's definitely not a key point of this rather disjointed film that opens up several plot lines, but fails to dig deep into most.

The key plot is basically a guy trying to do better in life and not follow in the tracks of his janitor father (who becomes bedridden early on in the film).  To that end, he has sex with his brothers girlfriend who is in jail because the brother is infertile - let's not even go here.  It's pretty dark, and pretty depressing.  Not much happens, I didn't care for most of the characters, and like other reviewers found it boring, all the while hoping and waiting for the end.

There's nothing happy or hopeful in the film, though some might think the end has some redemption, I found nothing.  I would not recommend, and I certainly wouldn't watch it again.  I give the story line 1 star, but the acting and direction is OK, so in the end, 2 stars.",1381017600,2,1365,4.504065040650406
8231915,1,B000YDBPCK,"did not enjoy it, will never watch it again.  I thought that the acting was poor, the plot could have had a lot more incite, and a couple of the actors were poorly casted.",1374105600,,171,4.029411764705882

8231917,5,B000YDBPCK,"Just want to say that this movie shows a young adult taking care of his father (not seen much today) and holding to the only job that allows him to do just that.

Not much social life.

Just online learning and a couple of friends.

Just the monotonous safe life many of us chose or had to choose.

...

So he changed venues and even though he may never go up the social ladder, still by changing he now may be happy.

Just a good friend or a good woman is Sometimes all we need.",1361232000,3,479,3.9894736842105263
8231918,2,B000YDBPCK,"Being a true blue movie lover of all genre, I rarely come across a movie that I truely don't like.  I found this ""indie"" or foreign flick to have little to contribute to enjoyable viewing nor even just a story to tell. It is unbearingly slow and a bit difficult to follow. I don't think I have ever rated a movie, ""I Hate It"".  I guess that's so because someone cared enough and found supporters to get it made that they feel they had a true contribution for us to contemplate. So, I will just leave it that,""I Don't Like It"", period.",1350777600,2,534,4.2254901960784315
8231919,4,B000YDBPCK,Very good movie for adults. Takes place in Spain with a lot of love and kissing. One of the sons tried to get his father's bank money to start a business. The plot is kind of nebulous. No one was a winner in this movie. Movie was purchased from Amazon.com,1340496000,5,255,4.12
8231920,5,B000YDBPCK,"Azul oscuro casi negro, is a Spanish film that should have received much wider attention. It tells the story of Jorge played by Quim (unfortunate first name that) Guttierrez, who is a 25 year old janitor. He hates his job but uses it to care for his sick father. He has had some sort of stroke which has left him incontinent, losing his memory and mostly very nasty. Jorge is constantly looking for a better job, but finds his past to be a mill stone around his kneck.

Then old flame Natalia returns to the block. She is an international jet setter and has friends to match. Despite an obvious love for Jorge he is unable to get over the social division between them that is caused by wealth. He also has a brother who is doing time. This is Antonio, he has met a girl in prison during drama class, and wants to marry her and more importantly get her pregnant. Things get rather messy when Antonio finds out he is firing blanks due to a strangulated testicle. That is not a plot spoiler by the way, and if things were not bad enough, Jorge also has a stoner mate Isreal who uses his apartment to take pictures of a gay masseurist who always finishes his clients off with more than just a hand shake.

So the scene is set for an often funny, often sad and mostly fragile tale of love, misunderstanding, class and family loyalties. It is not the best film ever made, but it is original and has clearly had a lot of love and thought gone into it, and that is evidenced in almost every shot.

I however, thought this was an understated gem. I particularly liked the voyeur Israel played by Raul Arevalo who manages to pull off (no pun intended) the stoner, loser and thoughtful son with issues without appearing contrived. Marta Etura as Paula is also convincing, touching and likable as the confused Paula. Director Daniel Sanches Arevalo has made an original piece of cinema and done so with a virtually unknown cast and this really should have got a lot more attention. For fans of European cinema this is one that you really ought to see if only once - recommended.",1339200000,9,2066,4.431578947368421
