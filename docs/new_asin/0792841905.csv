145204,3,0792841905,If your a Tupac fan as I am then you'll appreciate him in this role but the movie itself lacks a lot the detectives so happen to do whatever they please without anyone asking any questions just not very believable but overall a fun movie not to be taken serious but that's ok that's just not what kind of movie this is,1462406400,,318,4.145161290322581

145413,2,0792841905,"Gave this movie a try because it starred (co-star really) Tupac Shakur and his performance in this was good. He plays as a distressed corrupted cop, partnered with another corrupted cop, where they find themselves trying cover up a murder of an undercover cop they committed by placing other random suspects to take the fall. Their objective is to stay above water and proceed like nothing ever happened, even it means to kill again. Although most of the cast did a decent job, this drama flick fails in delivering an entertaining story. Plot is so thin that it doesn't give the actors much to go on, making it a boring movie.",1461024000,,626,4.648648648648648

145533,4,0792841905,"Very underrated film. This is Tupac Shakur's last movie before his untimely death and I really felt this movie didn't get the recognition it truly deserved. Too many all star veteran actors in this movie to be so overlooked: James Belushi, Dennis Quaid, Lela Rochon, James Earl Jones, special appearance by: Kool Moe Dee and the list just goes on and on. Basically, it's a movie about 2 dirty cops (Belushi and Shakur) killing drug dealers, rapist and whoever was found innocent by a court of law and free to walk the streets. They decided to take the law in their owns hands killing these criminals making these crimes look gang related and case closed. Problem was, the last drug dealer they killed (Kool Moe Dee) was actually an undercover agent working for the FBI and the boys must find someone to pin the murder on before it's too late and comes back on them. Twist, turns, betrayal, this movie has it all. A must see film for any suspense movie fan.",1411344000,6,956,4.563953488372093

145535,4,0792841905,"Good movie, love the 90s music tempo and style of the film. But if you want to see Tupac in his last movie, this is the one. Shows the side of corrupt cops trying to cover themselves and how far there willing to go. Sadly was Tupac last movie he completed a week before he died on Sept 13th 1996 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Glad to see him on this last final act, irony shows that he plays a cop even though his lyrics and lifestyle revolved around police but he was a terrific actor and was gone wayyyyyyy too young at the age of 25.

145566,4,0792841905,"Like most people reviewing here, i bought this film to see Tupac, had he not been in the film it's doubtful I would have been interested.  Having now watched it, I was quite surprised at how good the film was, especially considering the lack of promotion it seemed to get (in England anyway).

Tupac and James Belushi are cast as two crooked cops who set up drug deals, take the money and then kill the dealers, dishing out their own kind of justice.  It all goes badly wrong when they mistakenly kill an undercover cop, and have to continuosly scramble to cover their tracks.  Tupac is perhaps surprisingly cast as the better of the two cops, the one with a conscience, a less imaginative director would have probably cast them the other way round.  Belushi plays the cop who will do anything to save himself, and to be honest, though Tupac is good in the film, Belushi does steal the show, Pac has more of a supporting role.

There are many twists and coincidences in the plot, and it does keep you on edge, but it is not without it's faults though, the poor ending being the main problem.  Overall though this is a very watchable film, and obviously Tupac's final screen performance, recommended.",1132272000,13,1199,4.574766355140187

These 2 cops sell cocaine to dealers, kill them and then throw away the drugs but they make a mistake when they kill a DEA Agent instead of a dealer. Things spiral down from there in this edgy urbanesque action thriller. Not much when the story is hammy.

145571,3,0792841905,"James Belushi and rapper Tupac Shakur in his final performance before his death are corrupt detectives who murder an undercover DEA agent and try to pin the murder on someone else. With the help of Belushi's stripper girlfriend, played by Lela Rechon, the two go on a rampage trying to find the perfect suspect to tag the murder to. When the murdered DEA agent's colleagues keep asking questions, the cops feel even more pressured to produce any evidence that distances them from the murder.
Belushi and Shakur make for a good team in an otherwise average crime thriller. Belushi is the more brutal of the two as he goes around kicking and blasting while the more sympathetic Shakur is trying to keep it together and also seems to feel some form of guilt over the crimes that he and his partner have committed. As is often the case in films like this, the deeper the two cops get in trying to cover up their crime, the more their world seems to fall apart. Real criminals that they have arrested are acquitted because they have used the stolen evidence in other cases, some of their phony witnesseses are buckling under pressure, and the man who they try to stick the murder charge to turns out to be more than what they expected. Through it all, Belushi and Shakur have a real chemistry and the audience often finds itself rooting for these guys who are in all honesty, complete jerks.
Many of Shakur's hardcore fans often praise his performance, which is real good, but Belushi is the one carrying the team here. Not to say that Shakur does not give an excellent performance but his role is less-defined so without Belushi, the film doesn't work. He is the one we all love to hate here. A scumbag homicide cop with homicidal tendencies who seems to keep testing his luck in every area. Shakur is more or less the guilty conscience of the duo. The more the story progresses, the worse he seems to feel about what he has done.
The interesting thing is how Shakur's character compliments Belushi's. Once the two are no longer functioning as a unit, Belushi is lost in our eyes. The little sympathy we felt for his character is gone. The way that he distances himself from Shakur is one of the few noble things that he does in the film but unfortunately, without his partner to save him, he is beyond help. He is now just a renegade without a purpose and we as an audience know that wherever he is going, he is in for some trouble.
""Gang Related"" is not an excellent movie. The story seems to wear thin in some areas but the film's two leads really keep this one above water. James Belushi turns in one of his best perfomances in some time in a role much different from what you're used to seeing from him. Shakur, in somewhat of a low-key performance is absolutely brilliant. Many people criticize rappers for trying to pick up a second paycheck without mastering the acting craft. Shakur is so natural as an actor, you would think it was his first love. It is a shame that Tupac never got an opportunity to be all that he could as far as acting goes. ""Related"" is not exactly an original concept but it is worth the time spent as it takes you for a nice little ride. On a side note, the Pac-influenced soundtrack of the film also helped give it a more professional feel.",1060819200,10,3270,4.4790619765494135

145594,3,0792841905,"It's Jim Belushi's acting that saves this film, yet his character is too dumb to be credible, as is the premise of the film.  He's a vicious corrupt cop who doesn't check anything twice, just shoots and doesn't ask any questions--later or at any time.  Yet because of Belushi's strong acting talents, his character is almost believable.
He and his partner, played by a wildly overacting Tupac Shakur, have a nasty profitable scam going:  they set up trades with drug dealers, then kill the latter for the drugs which they can sell again.  Here's another problem--any money cops use for set ups has to be authorized by higher ups, then accounted for.  There's no mention of that in the film; how do they get away with keeping the money?  It's also mentioned that they've pulled this 11 times.  OK, so after all those times, NOBODY on the force investigates how it is that so many drug dealers have died after a set up put in place by the same two cops over and over?  Also not credible.
The two thug cops kill a drug dealer who turns out to be an undercover DEA agent and fellow DEA guy Gary Cole pulls in and starts hassling the precinct for answers.  Cole also overacts here; he's a caricature, not a character.
However, as an upscale attorney, James Earl Jones does a fine job, as does Dennis Quaid as a surprising suspect the thug cops have framed for the murder of the DEA agent.  Yet the surprise that comes with discovering Quaid's real identity is another plot point that severely strains credibility.
The film seems to be a collection of characters thrown together to flesh out a collection of random, often non-credible, and distinctly unrelated story segments that have not been thought through.  Even the ending is disappointing--you can smell it coming a mile away.
In spite of all the above, this is not a bad film because the pacing and momentum are strong enough--along with the acting of Belushi, Jones, and Quaid--to carry it through to its predictable end.  Belushi is on screen most of the time and he's a lot of fun to watch.  You're thinking no cop can be that dumb, but his acting chops make you feel that if a guy could be this crude and vicious, then, OK, maybe he COULD be that dumb.

I don't deny 2Pac is by most accounts, an average actor, and in this film, he really makes James Belushi look like garbage.
Which, to be honest, isn't hard to do--he's never learned that comedy is his terrain, as it was his brother's.  His forays into anything else come off as useless, by comparison.  He's just walking through the occasionally inventive script, and likely was rooting for his paycheque at the end of each shoot.

7792234,3,0792841905,"When released this film didn't garner much attention. It did decent business at the box office but nothing to brag about. With the passing of Tupac Shakur interest increased and fans clamored for any and all things Tupac. Now the film makes its way to blu-ray courtesy of Olive Video.

Det. Frank Divinci and Det. Rodriguez (James Belushi and Tupac) are two corrupt cops more interested in making money than in doing their jobs. This isn't to say they cant get the job done that they're paid to do, they are good at finding bad guys. But becoming bad guys they find themselves in more trouble than expected.

The two have stolen drugs, sold them, took the money from their mark and then killed him. Who would notice a dead drug dealer, especially if the detectives investigating the killing were these two cops? Problems arise when their latest mark turns out to be an undercover DEA agent.

Given the job of finding the killer the pair come upon a homeless man (Dennis Quaid) and pin the rap on him. They even get Franks girlfriend (Lela Rochon) to testify that she saw him do it. But their plan starts to unravel on several levels. Rochon begins to have second doubts about what she is doing. Worse yet it turns out that Quaid is actually a wealthy businessman who went missing some years ago. His lawyers turn up to rescue him and with that everything begins to fall apart. As the duo tries to figure out what to do clues to the real killer begin to mount.

What makes the movie interesting is that it is told from their perspective, two corrupt cops as opposed to a mainstream hero trying to solve the mystery. Instead we have the reverse with two killers who have the means to cover their trail easily but who create so many mistakes that their tension over what to do next becomes ours as well.

Its difficult to sympathize with these two main characters but before the movie ends you find yourself wondering if perhaps they will do the right thing. Therein lies much of the tension found in the film. That desire to make atonement for past indiscretions while at the same time knowing it will results in the loss of your freedom and perhaps the loss of your life makes you wonder if either is willing to go through with it. At the same time you wonder if they will indeed get away with it all.

Tupac showed that he had a career ahead of him as an actor with a meaty role like this. He does a fantastic job and is quite believable in the part. Its a shame he never had the opportunity. Ive said for years that Belushi was a better actor than people have given him credit for. He started off in the shadow of his older brother John and then was pushed into comedic roles only for a time. His handling of dramatic roles showed he could do both.

While its nice that Olive has released the film on blu-ray for fans of the film and of Tupac they once again show no effort to present anything but the movie itself. Extras are non-existent. As they move forward lets hope more of their releases see some effort on their part for things that some would enjoy. In the meantime at least the film is offered in a well done format with a nice print to work from. If you enjoy gritty cop dramas then you're bound to enjoy this one.",1502323200,,3226,4.375626043405676
