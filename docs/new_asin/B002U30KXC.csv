8380922,5,B002U30KXC,"Whacked out silly Spanish-language, Mexican-made Blue Demon vs. an extraterrestrial menace flick from the early 60's.  (I don't believe any subtitles are available).  This time BD has to fight aliens with a leader that takes the form of a large fake spider that screeches out her orders in a voice one can barely understand.  Sometimes rather dark that one can barely make out the goings on in the invaders lair.  I think it was filmed that way.  Still the DVD is good quality.  Recommended for fans of Mexican wrestling hero films.",1419638400,,532,4.791208791208791
