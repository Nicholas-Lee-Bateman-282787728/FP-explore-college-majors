1640963,1,B00005OCKI,"What is this? I bought the dvd on impulse during a 5-min ""pick-up-something-else-run"" at the videoshop.
The dvd consists out of nothing else but ridiculously close shots of a burning fire. 95% of the time the images are taken in angle in which you would have been admitted to the severe burns trauma center if you had filmed it yourself! Nowhere on this dvd do you see an actual full size, normal fire burning... and you may forget seeing the flames dance because they're always shot in close-up or from a weird angle. The dvd does not ""flow"" but is rather a cut-and-paste job of bad images that jumps into many different angles but not a normal-eye view ... not relaxing at all.
The only OK thing is the music, but not the christmas version cause that's a mix of butchered european classics! And trust me, I'm from Euope and I know my songs! LOL Unless you have $20.00 regret-money to spend, this will be a very big disappointment...",1067558400,20,934,4.5325443786982245
1640964,1,B00005OCKI,"I agree that this is the worst fireplace video of them all. The makers just don't seem to understand that if watching a real fireplace is soothing and cozy then they should try to recreate that experience. They don't. Instead they fade shots in and out, most of which are annoyingly close up (as though you are sitting with your nose an inch from the fire). Just as you are adjusting to the shot and starting to relax, the shot switches again. It's like sitting to down to watch a fireplace and having to move to a totally different part of the room every minute or so. That wouldn't be relaxing, and neither is this DVD.",1042588800,18,621,4.362068965517241
1640965,5,B00005OCKI,This is a very convincing fireplace. I bought this because I don't have a fireplace in my house. This is actually a two dvd set. One disc contains the Fire with your choice of just the fire sounds or night music. The second disc contains your choice ofthe fire or Christmas music. These disc features 5 audio choices. You can just listen to the fire or the fire with music. You can also listen to just the music without the fire sounds. The dvd starts with a match being lit and than you see different shots of the fire on the logs. Most of these shots are about 5 minutes than it changes to a different shot. Sometimes the fire gets bigger on the log. The sound on this disc is excellent. I liked the occasinal popping of the logs. The fire atthe end ends with just embers. This is 60 minutes long. This is a very romantic dvd to watch with your sweetie. It's also should be watched when you want to relax. It almost put me to sleep watching the flames. The Christmas one is also useful during the holiday season. I would rather both music choices had been on one disc but I'm happy with this relaxing and romantic fireplace.,1021420800,21,1126,4.291079812206573
1640966,1,B00005OCKI,"As a conisseur of fireplace video programs, I would have to say that this is by far the worst.  Or should I say ""blurst.""  This DVD's technical shortcomings amount to visual misspelling, and I'm afraid I can't recommend it to anyone.",1009929600,20,233,4.658536585365853
1640967,1,B00005OCKI,short and sweet where is the fire? You sure don't see it in this DVD. At no time do you see the flam top to bottom. I wanted the DVD so my large living room TV could simulate a fire place but this simulation would have to include burnt eye brows.,1006128000,9,246,3.843137254901961
1640968,1,B00005OCKI,"Well what can one say? Not much really..
Here is an hour of DVD that shows a fire burning to give you the feel of having an open fire, Heat not included (Unless there is something wrong with your TV)
I would not  bother to be quite honest, but if someone out there does not know how to  use matches, then this could be just the ticket.",964051200,6,335,3.985074626865672
1640989,2,B00005OCKI,"This past Christmas I recorded 4 hours of the Yule Log from WPIX TV NYC on my DVR.  I had to upgrade my equipment and get a new DVR box so I lost my recording sad to say.  I looked online for a good dvd to replace what I lost.  Unfortunately the Yule Log isn't for sale. :-(
I thought this would be a similar recording.  Boy was I wrong.  Although the music part is very good-(there is a Christmas track and an Evening track to choose from) The fire itself is ridiculous!!!!  The person who videoed this didn't take into consideration that maybe people would want their TV to look as though it had a fireplace inside it, just as the Yule Log from WPIX did.  Is it just me or would anyone else think this silly - to have the fire burning and then to zoom in to one flame so it looks like I have 1/4 of a fire burning in the fireplace on a corner of the log.  The Original Yule Log does zoom in and out but yet it still has the WHOLE fire burning.  Not just one small area showing.  This is a total disappointment for me.  I bought this to play  on a cold winter's eve and to pretend that I have a real fire burning where my TV stands.  Is this too much to ask? LOL!!!
Come on guys.....let us pretend a bit.  BRING THE YULE LOG FROM CHRISTMAS DAY that's played on WPIX tv.  Someday maybe someone will make something similar......and this I will surely buy. OR at least show the whole fire burning and stop cutting off the rest of it. I don't even see the tops of the flames when it's totally zoomed out.  :-(
I do have to add that I approve of the music selections and I still play it occasionally, since this is all I found that came close to the original.  PS.....it says live fire sounds with the music track..... we could BARELY hear anything other than the music playing when we selected to hear both.  :-(  BOOoooooooo!!!  and bah humbug!!",1235779200,,1843,4.123595505617978
1640990,5,B00005OCKI,This DVD is so realistic it actually made people feel warm! THe fire is bright and then burns slowly down. THe musio is beautiful. IT is classical and one set for Christmas and another for just enjoying a winter fire. IT is easy to operate with on screen instructions. A fine DVD for anyone without a fireplace who wants that special ambience.,1231200000,,343,4.548387096774194
1640991,1,B00005OCKI,"I was expecting a video that had a constant feed of a bunring fireplace, BUT instead, this video is a constant panning in and out, back and forth, up and down of a fire.  The camera never stays put and there is never a full screen shot of the fire.

If you are like me and want a redneck version of a fireplace to view on your TV, this is not it.  This is more like a CSI version... getting closeups and such.

:(",1227657600,,413,3.880952380952381
1640992,3,B00005OCKI,"The variety of fireplace views and choices are very nice and peaceful along with the crackling sound.  However, the style of Christmas music is a poor choice for relaxation.  The music is up beat and fast paced which contradicts the purpose of relaxing in front of a fire.  I can only enjoy this fireplace setting by keeping the music off.  I like the fireplace video by itself, but I cannot recommend the DVD as a whole due to the mismatch of the music.",1225584000,,454,4.433734939759036
1640993,4,B00005OCKI,"This was a gift for my son. He had the original VCR tape and was always played on Christmas eve and Christmas day and then, it finally gave up the ghost! He was thrilled to have his ambiance back again and is very pleased with the quality.",1203897600,,239,4.1063829787234045
1640994,1,B00005OCKI,"The reason MOST people buy a video of a fireplace is either for kitch value or to actually replicate the exact view of a fireplace in action. In either case, you are expecting a continuous view/loop of a stationery framed image of a fireplace with a fire in it. A rectangular box containing a fire. This is not the case with this DVD. If you are looking for what I described above, this is definitely NOT the video for you. I truly feel the packaging and description are misleading, except maybe that they use the word ""visions"" plural.",1196294400,,536,4.479591836734694
1640995,3,B00005OCKI,"The view of the fireplace is not seen at all. The fire is more of a closeup of different angles / times. The picture quaility is good though. This DVD is not in widescreen. It is 1.33:1 (standard). The soundtrack / music is all classical music, which is ok with me, except the modern tunes. Please, ""Jolly old St. Nicholas and Up on the housetop"" is not what I would consider pieces to play in the classical style.

The music is in either Dolby surround or DTS, and your sound options are: 1. Fireplace only, 2. Music only (in either surround)or 3. Music and fire (in either surround). The music is too pronounced in the foreground, if you were to turn the sound down because the music is ""waking the kids up on x-mas eve"", you won't hear the fire crackling.

I would have perfered a fireplace from edge to edge, STATIONARY video and better mixed levels between audio and fire sounds.",1132272000,,884,4.450617283950617
1640996,5,B00005OCKI,"I bought this DVD, despite warnings here that it was a ""waste of money,"" because it was the only DVD that offered a wide screen mode.  We have moved to an old house where the fireplace can no longer be used.  It seemed like the perfect time to put a flat screen TV right where the fire screen would be.  What fun!  We bought an extra DVD player so that all we have to do is change the input and voila we have the fire because this DVD is always running on that second player. It is amazing how much having this DVD on in the background warms up the room (well, maybe it is all the electronics producing the heat).  This is no longer a two-DVD set; the whole scene is now on just one dvd which can be changed to play fire crackle with or without  music.  We like the music selections, but we play the DVD so much that we get tired of what's on the DVD.  Now we play other music on our stereo speakers while keeping only the fire crackle going on our TV speakers.  We work at home and used to have a news channel running in the background; now we mostly have this.  The change of perspective on the fire works well for our use because we don't sit and stare at it, but rather just glance from time to time while enjoying the fire's sound and ambience.",1104969600,3,1249,4.061224489795919
1640997,4,B00005OCKI,I bought this DVD to put on during our family Christmas and everyone loved it.  I mostly wanted it for warm background sound (I used the fireplace sound only option) and to make the TV less of a black hole in the living room.  It worked great!  It's also very relaxing for those of us who like to go to sleep with the TV on but don't want to be distracted by actual TV shows or movie playing.  Nice soothing VERY realistic sound.  I found the Christmas music option not very soothing but the night music is okay.,1086739200,3,512,4.183673469387755
1640998,1,B00005OCKI,"This was a pathetic excuse for a DVD. From the instant it started to play, I knew I had wasted my money on a piece of crap. After watching the DVD, I went to a friend's house and made a better film on MiniDV. PLEASE DON'T BUY! SAVE YOUR MONEY!",1070323200,9,243,3.88
7948756,5,B00005OCKI,"I really like fireplace videos.  This one is very pleasant on a cold rainy day or an evening or at bedtime.  Beautiful fireplace glow, flames, crackles.  I used to own this same one when it came on VHS.  Was glad to replace it with a dvd.",1520208000,,238,4.108695652173913

7948762,5,B00005OCKI,I use this in my computer lab at school during Christmas time.  I live in an area that is very warm and there is hardly ever any need for a fire in the fireplace.  Students love it.  Great product.,1413504000,,197,4.0

7948764,1,B00005OCKI,"This video is divided into segments of a real fire. Why divid it up into segments? I'm guessing they were going for the modern impressionistic surrealism angle. Instead of a pleasant video of a fire place you end up with a bad art school project. A long close up of a burning log? I've never seen anyone stick their face four inches from the fire to view it. A close up of a fire is not tranquil. It's disturbing. Panning across the burning logs??? Not quite as disturbing as the close up. But you tried. The best part of this DVD is the picture on the front of the case.

There are several really nice fire scenes. But over all not worth owning. If you can get a seller to give it to you for free and pay shipping it would be worth having. You'd end up with a spare case to put a good DVD in. Oh ya, and the picture on the front.",1352505600,,830,4.03030303030303
