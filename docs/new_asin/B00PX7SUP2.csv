8689629,5,B00PX7SUP2,"Superb picture and sound quality for a truly delightful film.  Loaded with inspired comedy, yet genuine emotion to give depth to the characters, even during the brilliantly silly resolution.  A film to be enjoyed!  Can you handle this much fun?",1472342400,2,244,5.05
8689630,4,B00PX7SUP2,"this movie gets better as it goes along...it has some silly parts, and some hidden gems! I bought this because of Claudette Colbert (it is not ""It Happened One Night"") and was happy with it...the quality is good...I enjoyed Miriam Hopkins (her second movie and first with Ernst Lubitsch)",1428019200,9,287,4.877551020408164
