Sure it was cheesy with the blood being a bright tomato red, but it was exactly what I expected. The special effects were exactly what I remembered from my childhood TV viewing. I think the best line in this movie was, ""It was her maggotty head you found in the basement."" Perfect. Then when I googled the star, Jack Jones, and found out he sang the ""Love Boat"" theme song, it just tied everything together with a nice big bow. I loved it.",1379030400,,582,4.15929203539823
2441810,4,B000BTGY3C,If you are a Jack Jones fan I recommend this film only because he does do some singing.  The movie is enjoyable and has a twist which makes for a good movie.,1272758400,,157,3.90625
2441811,4,B000BTGY3C,"When I first saw this film I was 10 and it was on channel ""Z"" (remember that far back?) It took me almost 20 years to find it on Vhs , and when I finally did, the picture was faded, and the sound was kinda muffled, but I bought it anyways for 49 cents. I am looking forward to the dvd release, and I would like to see it restored, for all its worth, it is a good story. Maybe hollywwod will remake this , like black christmas and many others",1166054400,,441,3.857142857142857
2441812,3,B000BTGY3C,"From Media Blasters/Shriek Show comes another entry in The Pete Walker Collection in the film The Comeback (1979) aka The Day the Screaming Stopped, which was both produced and directed by Pete Walker (House of Whipcord, Frightmare, Schizo).  Starring in the film is popular, Grammy winning crooner Jack Jones (Juke Box Rhythm, Airplane II: The Sequel) in one of his few, silver screen roles.  Also appearing is Pamela Stephenson (Superman III), Bill Owen (The Secret of Blood Island), Sheila Keith (Frightmare), Holly Palance (The Best of Times), daughter of legendary actor Jack Palance, Peter Turner (The Krays), and David Doyle, probably best known for his role as `Bosley' on the late 1970s television series ""Charlie's Angels"".

As the film begins two things happen, the first being the arrival of American pop singer Nick Cooper (Jones) in England and the second being the brutal murder of his ex-wife Gail (Palance) in his English penthouse apartment (she was viciously hacked to bits with a sickle by an assailant dressed up like an old lady, complete with granny mask).  So Nick, whose career has been in the toilet for the last six years (primarily due to Gail railroading his career), has come to London to produce a new album, and his manager Webster `Web' Jones (Doyle) sets him up at a large English manor, complete with recording studio.  As Nick arrives at the manor he meets the caretakers, a couple named Mr. And Mrs. B (Owen and Keith, respectively) and settles in proper.  Later that evening Nick is awoken upon hearing unexplained noises but he eventually writes them off as his imagination.  As Nick begins working on his album he gets friendly with Webster's executive assistant (i.e. his secretary), an attractive blonde woman named Linda Everett (Stephenson).  Anyway, the nighttime noises continue, along with the appearances of Nick decomposing ex-wife, both of which ultimately lead to Nick having a nervous breakdown and spending a few weeks in the hospital (seems someone's been playing a game of hide and seek with the maggoty, decomposing corpse of Nick's ex-wife).  Upon being released from the hospital Nick visits his penthouse to discover the walls have been scrubbed and the carpeting replaced...now keep in mind Nick never visited his pad after Gail was dispatched so he's got no idea what happened there, or why his place smells of antiseptic.  Nick returns to the manor, which seems a bad idea to me, and this is when the stuff really hits the fan as Nick learns the noises and visions are not related to any mental fatigue but stem from a carefully orchestrated plot to destroy him...why?  And by whom?  You'll just have to watch and find out for yourself...

I did enjoy The Comeback but I thought it suffered some similar issues I saw in one of Walker's other, previously released film, specifically The Flesh and Blood Show in that they were both just so slow and plodding (the latter did have a lot more nekkidness, though).  The film here runs roughly 100 minutes, but Walker could have easily slashed off 20 minutes or so in favor of a quicker pace.  The one thing this film does have over The Flesh and Blood Show is the violence is actually depicted, which didn't hurt in helping to keep the viewer's attention.  Another positive element over that pervious film is there's more of a connection between the viewers and the characters.  In The Flesh and Blood Show there's not much in the way of character development so I never really cared much what happened to them, and while I didn't relate much to the characters here, at least they had some depth.  Of the various Walker films I've seen to date, most all seem to be of the `whodunit' variety, and all feature lots of misdirection.  As the story progresses here we're given any number of possible suspects, some having what appears to be clear motives, while others are suspects based primarily on the fact they act so weird.  You may guess who the killer is here, but it's unlikely you'll understand the reasoning behind the acts, as the insignificant hints dropped along the way amount to so little.  Jones did all right, his past experience primarily consisting of episodic television work (he's probably best known for his singing The Love Boat theme song) as he seems to know his way around a set, but the real standout for me was Walker regular Sheila Keith, as her characters usually include a not so subtle creepiness (she was great in Frightmare) that just fun to watch unfold.  There are a couple of solid scares, the one at the end worth sticking around for, along with a couple of graphic murders.  Perhaps the most bizarre part of the film involves David Doyle as there's a scene where we see him, in his home, dressing up like a cabaret singer, complete with gaudy makeup and huge, false eyelashes, the intent being, I suppose, to display a side of him that might somehow indicate he's capable of murder (drag queens are unpredictable, I guess).  As I said, the ride here is pretty slow overall, but things do pick up considerably near the end, within the last twenty minutes or so...you might guess who the killer is, but I'd avoid spending too much time trying to discern a motive as it will be energy wasted, especially given how everything's detailed at the end.

Here's a bit of oddness...the back of the DVD case on this Shriek Show release states the picture is in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), but it's actually presented in open matte, full frame.  The picture itself is decent, but does come across a little soft.  As far as the audio there's two options, English mono and English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, both of which come across well.  Extras include an audio commentary track with producer/director Pete Walker, moderated by author Jonathan Rigby, an original theatrical trailer, photo gallery, film notes, and trailers for some other Walker films including House of Whipcord (1974), Die Screaming, Marianne (1971), which is mistakenly listed as `Die Screaming Maryanne', Frightmare (1974), The Confessional (1976) aka House of Mortal Sin, and The Flesh and Blood Show (1972).

By the way, if anyone out their from Media Blaster/Shriek Show is reading this, how about a DVD release of Walker's Schizo (1976)?  I haven't had a chance to see it, but it was previously released onto DVD and is now out of print, prompting those third parties willing to sell to ask for some ridiculously high prices (I'm interested in seeing the film but I ain't paying four times the original DVD price for the privilege).",1163462400,12,6560,4.846016114592659

8092738,1,B000BTGY3C,"This is one film that should have never ""come back.""  It was so dreadful, that poor Jack Jones probably regretted the day he ever decided to star in this turkey.  The only thing worse that this piece of low budget, cinematic garbage was the blond hair that someone actually thought would look good on Mr. Jones.  After subjecting myself to the torture to watching the first half of this monstrosity of movie making, the only redeeming thing I could think of was to write this review to warn any fellow human being to steer clear of this pitiful loser.",1452902400,,551,4.545454545454546

8092740,4,B000BTGY3C,"Hilariously if completely unintentionally campy horror flick.  In the tradition of the  best of the bad '70's horror dramas there's bad music, dreadful make-up effects, great bad acting, and wonderfully  weird and inappropriate pauses in the storyline to run down one rabbit hole or another for absolutely no reason.  I don't think this film was meant to be so but to me it is nevertheless uproariously fun and entertaining to watch.  I don't  believe it'd actually frighten even your grandma though so don't watch it thinking you're going to get a big scare.",1440806400,,559,4.956989247311828
8092741,1,B000BTGY3C,The DVD jacket for Shriek  Show release of The Comeback states this is anamorphic 1.85:1 as does Amazon. WRONG: It is 1.33:1. The transfer is pretty good for a 70's film. No subtitles. Would give it 2 stars but deduct 1 star for lying about the aspect ratio,1422144000,,257,4.354166666666667
8092742,3,B000BTGY3C,"What can I say...it's old, retro and predictable. Typical storytelling of the era with characters that are not likeable..and most tims wierd.  If you have nothing to do and like funky retro flicks then this is for you.",1416096000,,218,4.7368421052631575
8092743,2,B000BTGY3C,"In the opening scene we see Gail ( Holly Palance ) pop star Nick Cooper's (Jack Jones) separated wife get killed with a scythe across the face. Nick is attempting a comeback. Although he is described as a sinful gyrating pop star, his music is more akin to Andy Williams. At night Nick has visions of his rotting wife and hears her voice, although only the killer knows she is dead.

This is the film where the killer where's a hag mask so that the people (s)he kills can't identify him (her). The film was mildly camp. Once the killer is revealed and why, it only gets worse. I didn't like it. Lovers of old mildly campy films might like it. I prefer ""House of Whipcord"" for era camp.

F-bomb. Near sex. near nudity.",1415923200,,717,4.343283582089552
8092744,3,B000BTGY3C,Not really that bad a movie even though the plot line is somewhat silly to me. Acting could be better as well but it's still a movie you can get through on a rainy day or have a cold.

8092746,5,B000BTGY3C,"Director Pete Walker's (FRIGHTMARE, HOUSE OF WHIPCORD, SCHIZO) film THE COMEBACK is about a musician named Nick Cooper (Jack Jones), who goes to stay at a remote mansion in order to get away from the city. He's trying to re-start his career after an ugly divorce. Meanwhile, back at his penthouse, his ex-wife Gail drops by and is brutally murdered by a masked maniac! Upon his arrival at the massive estate, Nick meets the housekeeper, Mrs. B (The wonderfully wicked Sheila Keith- FRIGHTMARE, HOUSE OF WHIPCORD), who seems to know an awful lot about Nick's music career and personal habits. She and her husband are a spooky pair indeed! At night, Nick hears odd sounds and a female crying / screaming. He even sees a rotting corpse in the hallway! Is he being haunted by ghosts, or is the answer more mundane? What does all this have to do w/ whomever killed Gail and why? THE COMEBACK is a macabre mystery w/ gruesome shocks aplenty. While not as well-known as some of Walker's other films, I believe it deserves a much wider audience...",1389052800,4,1039,4.683060109289618
