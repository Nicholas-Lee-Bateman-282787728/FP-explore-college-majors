7858799,3,6303994288,"This video is the second in the P.R.O.B.E. series, a collection of films about the Preternatural Research Bureau.  Although well-written, these videos have a low budget, and their primary appeal is that they feature actors and even characters from the Doctor Who television series.  If you're a fan, these videos are for you!  If you're not, it may be hard to fathom the appeal.
The story: When P.R.O.B.E. is threatened with closure, Liz Shaw (Caroline John) finds herself in direct conflict with her superiors, including her old friend and ally Patricia Haggard (Louise Jameson, reprising her role from ""The Zero Imperative"").  Liz hopes that her investigation into strange events at a public school will demonstrate the vital need for the Bureau.  But she soon finds the fate of P.R.O.B.E. inextricably linked with the lives of three young men, each of whom has something to hide...
The always enjoyable Peter Davison has a prominent role at the Winterborne school.  It should be noted that this is not a program for young children; essentially a horror story/mystery, there is a murder, mild gore and other adult situations.  Nothing that couldn't be seen on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", but a bit much if you're expecting Doctor Who.
There is a sequel of sorts entitled ""The Ghosts of Winterborne"".",1050969600,,1301,5.023255813953488
