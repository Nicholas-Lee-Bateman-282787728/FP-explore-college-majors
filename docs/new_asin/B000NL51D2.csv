2772189,1,B000NL51D2,This was suppose to be another edition of the midnite special series but I received a duplicate of the 1st I ordered and it was in terrible condition too.,1269561600,,154,4.344827586206897
2772190,4,B000NL51D2,This is a must have for those who enjoyed the show in the 70's.  Just the Steely Dan performance alone is worth it.  Those great 70's outfits are classic.,1262044800,7,154,4.275862068965517
2772191,4,B000NL51D2,"The Midnight Special Series used to be on NBC on Friday nights at midnight in the 1970s.  There was always a few artists featured per episode.  Usually each artist got a couple of songs, with commercial breaks between each song, and as I recall, the show was 1 hour long.  Comedians were also featured on most episodes and Wolfman Jack was the show's host.

Unfortunately, the video series is released as a per year basis, so instead of getting particular episodes with artists you want, you end up with some artists/songs you like, mixed with absolute dreck/schlock you don't want to see.  This means don't spend too much on any particular DVD, as most just arn't worth it.  Also, all are mixed into Dolby 5.1 surround sound, but few particular performances have sound quality worth the trouble it took to mix them.  You do have the option for stereo on them, so that will probably be good enough for most people.  1970s TV was all originally broadcast in mono.

Fortunately, the 1973 and 1974 DVDs are among the best ones of the whole series, overall.

On this particular 1973 DVD, you get more bang for the buck than most.

Most of the video is live, but I suspect some lip synching or pre-recorded backup is done on some of them on the DVD performances, especially Johnny Nash on this one.

The Doobie Brothers are just OK, as they always are.  They just don't create any great sparks here.

Billy Preston's performance of ""Circles"" is pretty good.

The Steely Dan performance is worth the money spent alone, as it is the original touring lineup of the band with Denny Dias and Skunk Baxter on guitars (Walter Becker on bass).  There is probably no other video footage, let alone audio, of the original band live, except the live audio B-side of ""Bodhisattva"".  With ""Do It Again"" on the ""More 1973"" DVD, it just makes you yearn for more and wonder if performances of ""Dirty Work"" or ""Midnight Cruiser"" are lurking in the vaults somewhere.

The Jim Croce performance of ""Leroy Brown"" is pretty good, and it must have occurred not long before he died in the plane crash in Sept. 1973.

Interestingly, Seals and Crofts actually are way better than you would expect, when you see them live, vs. listening to their studio cuts.

""Bang a Gong"" is sped up too much, and Marc Bolan's falsetto gets a bit wearing after awhile, as it probably has some coke-fueling in there.  It doesn't help that his backup singers falsetto too much, too.  Sounds like some goats got out of the pen.

For some odd reason, on War's ""Cisco Kid"", Papa Dee Allen is missing but it appears his percussion kit is there (weird).  There must be a story on that one.

The Argent performance is a lip-sync and they seem a bit awkward.  They were probably better actually live.

This DVD closes with an absolutely devastating Edgar Winter performance of ""Frankenstein"" with Ronnie Montrose on guitar.  What a rockin' stompin' performance!  Also almost worth the price of the DVD alone.  (Review update: I have been informed by someone that the guitarist is actually Jerry Weems, not Ronnie Montrose).

The comedy segments are OK but as in all of the DVDs, you get just a snippet instead of the whole routine.  At least you get some vintage George Carlin.",1220745600,65,3222,4.647787610619469
2772192,3,B000NL51D2,Having just received my set of DVDs. Seeing these stars doing live shows is great. Video and audio are poor.,1190160000,10,108,4.45

2772194,5,B000NL51D2,Classic groups at a memorable pint in time on a memorable stage. IF you are of this era you will be transported  back and if you are not  you will be surprised at the early influences that have guided many of the groups today.,1417305600,,226,4.113636363636363
2772195,4,B000NL51D2,Great selection of rock and pop TV performances from back in the day.  Wardrobe and hairstyles are so fun to revisit...an extra bonus.,1413849600,,134,4.826086956521739
2772196,5,B000NL51D2,"There are performances on here you can find nowhere else.
The quality is good, and I personally feel that the 1960's through the 1980's were the high water mark of rock.",1401494400,2,169,4.483870967741935
2772197,5,B000NL51D2,"Very excited to revisit those classic performances from the 70's from The Midnight Special: I remember
having to stay up past my bedtime in high school, as TMS aired after Saturday Night Live, which ended
at 1 in the morning. Drowsy but fond memories of appearances by The Doobies, Bowie, Fleetwood
Mac and more. And you couldn't ask for a more iconic host than former disc jockey Wolfman Jack.
AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!",1393804800,4,421,4.861111111111111

2772201,5,B000NL51D2,"Total running time on this is 78m and i rate this entire program for 1973 Excellent+!!
Your going to find when you watch this that the Fade-In to the program starts sometimes with introduction,sometimes not.
Also when the performers finish their song,that is the end of the Midnight Special program on all of the artists.
I was a little surprised by this,not a big deal.
The disc i received was a Noisy Disc but played through with no troubles.
Oh man it was really cool seeing this old program again.
Check out the clothes,hair styles,facial hair,you have to watch all of this to really appreciate the time and effort that went into this program.
No Wolfman Jack on this particular volume.
You get 3 xtras with this and they are photo gallery,George Carlin-runs 6m,Robert Klein-runs 7m.
I thought Carlin was good,check out his hair and Klein i rate excellent.
I highly recommend this 1973 program,watch it all the way through and you'll like it too.",1370649600,2,950,4.763636363636364
2772202,3,B000NL51D2,"This is a fun look back at the music and musicians of the '70s.  I wish, though, that it was the whole season and complete episodes, and not ""the best of.""  As I remember from the original broadcasts, each week a different musician would host--Helen Reddy, John Denver, whoever was hot.  It was very cool and different from other musical shows that were being presented at the time. (Man, were they/we ever that young?!  So despite the ""best of"" feel of the discs, I think it's worth your time.  You'll find yourself remembering songs/groups you hadn't thought of for a long time.",1318291200,6,580,4.647058823529412
