7760189,4,B01GGPI1R6,"Zombie Holocaust is one of those films you either love or hate
If you love this film for what it is
This two disc edition is for you
I've payed the same price for limited editions from Twilight Times (1/2 the time they were not worth the price)
The previous blu ray by Shriek Show  released in 2011 almost 5 years ago crazy!
Is average at best  with very little extras and sells brand new for $20.00
This is the way to go in terms of plenty of bang for your buck!

The Strongest thing about this film besides the over the top practical gore f/x
is the Cast
Ian McCulloch
Alexandra Delli Colli (who also worked on the New York Ripper) she is just old Hollywood beautiful watching this film in a HD resolution you'll notice that.... We don't get actress like this anymore timeless beauty! She also gets to actually acts this time around not just be a housewife nympho!
Sherry Buchanan who didn't go on to do much which i don't understand she to had this very unique look very pretty girl she stands out in every scenes she's in!
Donald O'Brien,
Walter Patriarca,

Director Marino Girolami took two Horror Sub genres Zombies & Cannibals and mashed them up to make
Zombie Holocaust
Once the film goes outside NYC
you start to get this sense of deja vu that could be because it was filmed on the same sets as Lucio Fulci's Zombie

The film is more a straight Cannibal film sprinkled in with over the top kills, nudity, gore, and a handful of zombies
Most gore hounds will wanna see it at least once but, it's a typical Cannibal film all substance no real style
One Huge positive there are no killings of live animals Thank God!
So Marino Girolami did the right thing and could of followed previous directors that did that ""cheap"" and very evil filming practice
When the zombies do finally show up most of them look very good but, they make a cameo
As far as scale and production value Marino Girolami did a hell of a lot with what he had he recycled from another film to make this one and pulled it off in many ways this is a Grind house exploitation hybrid
This was 1980 Italy was still making profit in horror films

BTW: Not for Children this film is Rated X (The Gore is on the same level as a Lucio Fulci Film it's rough and hardcore and nothing and i mean nothing is held back also you have Alexandra Delli Colli fully nude) It was a title on again and off again the list of the Video nasty in the UK

I'll admit it this is one of those films every time i view it i come to appreciate it for what it is even more........ 7.8/10
Update 9-4-2016
I'll try this again i updated this review ages ago after checking out one of the disc the update never appeared
If you do get the second version (By Severin) and it has a small green sticker on it you're in luck and got the free limited Barf Bag Replica
Not sure how close this comes to the old swag Theaters actually used to give out
I was able to pop in one of the disc and check out various scenes and the extras on that disc
This is overall a great purchase even upgrade from the previous rushed Shriek Show blu ray/dvd combo pack
This Collector's edition is solid with plenty of cool extras (The only thing it's really lacking is some type of Audio Commentary
But, I'm a sucker for commentary tracks
The extras i watched i really enjoyed
*****Voodoo Man- Interview with Star Ian  McCulloch this is very cool he talks about his career from going to the top straight to the bottom
Those are his words (I wish they were able to get him to do a audio commentary for one of the Cuts
It's a interesting & enjoyable interview
**** Ian McCulloch sings 'Down by the River'  he was much younger when this was put out
Not sure i'd guess mid 1960's It has a very Dean Martin/Rat Pack sound to it..... impressive vocals even though it's not my cup of tea
** New York Locations then and now you see original scenes from the film then the location now  (This was interesting but, very plain)  almost all the locations look the same pretty much  This would've been better if they got Sean Clark Horror's Hallowed Grounds to do this extra But, he might be contractually obligated into only doing stuff for Scream Factory/Shout
***** Interview with Actress Sherryl Buchannan  (This i really enjoyed she is a major stand out in this film) She is spotlighted and discusses her big break being a model at age 19 then doing various films  (Great interview Sherryl seems very honest about some of the mistakes she made one being in a adult feature film and never told until after the fact
The PQ on disc two Zombie Holocaust isn't flawless But, it looks much better and actually restored unlike the original blu-ray",1467158400,30,4642,4.3452655889145495

7760193,4,B01GGPI1R6,"First and foremost, I have to mention the company Severin Films. They bring out such amazing high quality Blu-rays. Jam packed with special features and total Fan base perfection. Doctor Butcher is no different. I was super excited to finally see the film in two different ways. The total grindhouse experience. The original Zombie Holocaust and then the edited and rearranged American Version Doctor Butcher M.D. I grew up with Zombie Holocaust and its was during those day's with the 1980 craze of Zombie gore that ran wild in the 70s and 80s. One was always trying to outdo the other. There are so many example's of the zombie films of the 70s and 80s but very few really stand out and are worthy to remember. I think Zombie Holocaust is worthy because of all its craziness and twist and turns that was done to the film, being edited, changed, altered and basically turned into two different films.

Severin Films has honored this 80s Grindhouse treat with a lovely two disc Blu-ray. Now you the fan can adventure into which one you want to watch. Feeling like the original Zombie Holocaust, pop it in, feeling a little weird pop in the American rearranged version Doctor Butcher M.D. This Blu-ray production is a total treat filled with special features and totally uncut perfection.

If you're an Italian Gore Hound, then in my viewpoint this is a must see Zombie Film. Zombie Holocaust yes uses all the clichs and basic stuff you would expect, but it also is one of those of an era that cant be forgotten.

Starring one of my all-time favorite Horror Icons. The one and only master of European horror roles Ian McCulloch. If there is one actor that has garnered a fan base of Cult style entertainment it is Ian. All one has to look at is his ultimate career. For in my viewpoint the greatest Zombie film ever Fulcis gory masterpiece of grindhouse perfection the one and only 1979s Zombi 2. Who can forget the alien egg invasion classic Grindhouse cheesiest 1980s Contamination. Ian was pure Cult actor. Its always a total treat to see him once again.

Now for the American version, Doctor Butcher M.D. the one and only Donald OBrien was added. OBrien is a total bad ass star of many Cult style films, mainly the Spaghetti Westerns that was all the craze in the 60s and 70s. He starred in such greats like 1975s Four of the Apocalypse, 1976s Keoma, 1977s Mannaja, just to name a few. He was a master in the grindhouse style of films. He shinned in many memorable rolls, and his part in Zombie Holocaust a.k.a. Doctor Butcher is a prime example of one of those roles you will remember after seeing it.

This version being brought out by Severin is so important because its Uncut, unedited and brought out the way it was meant to be seen. Its fully restored which is a total bonus for any fan, or lover of this style of entertainment. It gets no better when a company knows what fans want, and need for their collection, and Severin Films is that company that knows what fans want, and this production of this Blu-ray is a golden ticket of perfection. You get 2 Disc, the Zombie Holocaust Version and the Doctor Butcher M.D. version. Double the dose of blood, gore and scalp removing, vocal cord cutting and all the bloody mayhem that made grindhouse films, Cult status perfection.

Directed by Marino Girolami who was a cult Italian film director. In honesty he was so much more than just another cult film maker. He had started making films in 1943 and did so all the way up to 1992. He left a vast array of Italian Films on many different subjects from comedy, action, crime, drama. Cult fans will always know him for his darker, films. But one thing I can guarantee you is that his films will always be remembered. He left a lasting legacy for all the Cult film lovers who continue to watch his films today.

I also have to mention the master behind the music. The one and only Nico Fidenco. Many fans of Cult films might not realize the importance this music man had on the world of Grindhouse entertainment. He was a part of so many Cult style films. His music always stood out and gave a total clarity of just what you were watching. From Spaghetti Westerns like 1973s Those Dirty Dogs, to six of the long running Emanuelle series of the 1970s. From 1975s Black Emanuelle, to 1977s Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals. To dare I admit one of my personal over the top, wild, asinine, cheesy film favorites, 1981s Porno Holocaust (Just because it's so dam weird). Nico was a god of his style of music and these films shine with that reality, and Zombie Holocaust is a prime example of his mastery.

I think what is so funny about the production of this film is all the changing and editing and chopping and rearranging that took place with this film. The U.S. as we know changed it to Doctor Butcher M.D. This version added a little over 2 minutes of a film that was not finished called Tales to Rip Your Heart Out, and plus adding a new music score. There were many other shots edited and pieced together. Thankfully Severin Films has brought to life both versions, fully restored and totally uncut, which makes this worthy to own for any fan of this wonderful gory entertainment.

Overall:

I cant stop praising this release. Severin did a fantastic job in giving a perfection in Cult Entertainment. I have a feeling that this will be mentioned in one of my segments for Top 2016 releases. It looks fantastic. All the added features are truly brilliant. The packaging needs mentioning. Standard Two Disc Blu-ray holder with reversible, wrap around artwork, so you can switch it to Zombie Holocaust or Doctor Butcher. Also each Blu-ray Disc has the beautiful artwork on it. The first 5,000 Copies comes with a Barf Bag, yes you read that right, and thats pure perfection in advertisement. I highly recommended this Blu-ray.

To me its a must own Cult film that has never looked or been treated better than this ultimate version by Severin. What are you waiting for? Buy this classic Cult, Grindhouse gore fest. This is totally Perfecting the Blu-ray experience.",1473379200,4,7657,4.840978593272172

7760199,4,B01GGPI1R6,"*I received a review copy of this film set in exchange for an honest review

ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST is a film thats been on my radar for many, many years.  I remember seeing the VHS cover long ago, when I first started watching horror flicks (this would have been around 1983 or so), but I never had the chance to give it a look.  Thats a shame, too ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST is schlocky by todays standards, but back then I probably would have found it terrifying.

Imagine my surprise to discover just recently that DOCTOR BUTCHER, M.D. is the same film.  When I say the same, I mean its literally the exact film as ZOMBIE HOLOCAUSTexcept it has a few updated scenes thrown in to Americanize it.  Thanks to Severin and CAV releasing them together in a 2-disc Blu-ray set, I had the opportunity to watch them back-to-back.  And interestingly, the Americanized version is not nearly as good as the original.  But regardless of which is better, theres no denying the interesting legacy the films have produced, nor the huge entertainment value youll gain by watching them.

To alleviate any confusion, Im only going to discuss ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST in the rest of this review.  DOCTOR BUTCHER, M.D. has a few extra scenes and an updated score, but neither adds anything to the original film.  If anything, the added scenes look ridiculous compared to the rest of the film, and the music sounds like something 60s stoners would listen to while getting high.

ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST is shot fairly well for the most part, however the cinematography is certainly dated.  There are several quick-zoom-in shots that are used as an attempt to add intensity to the scenebut any veteran film watcher will tell you these no longer work.  The HD transfer is sketchy, and the film is still full of grainy images and barely visible low-light shots.  I have to wonder how bad the original source material was.

The acting in ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST is much like it is in every other cannibal/zombie film from this time period.  The men are gruff and take charge from the get go, while the women ae helpless and do a lot of screaming and moaning when in distress.  These stereotypes made me a smile a couple of times, particularly when I thought about how they compared to horror characters in todays films.  Most women in horror films these days are just as tough as they are pretty!

The special effects in the film are outstanding, particularly for that time period.  Theres plenty of carnage, and gore-hounds should definitely be satisfied here.  The cannibals enjoy tearing open live victims, and the results are gruesome to behold.  I tip my hat to the special effects team, for sure.

This Blu-ray set of both films is a big win for me, and Ill gladly add ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST to my list of Favorite Italian Zombie flicks.  Oh sure, its got its flaws (the zombies walk like six-year olds pretending to be Frankenstein), but they are a big part of what makes the film so much fun.",1470873600,3,2934,4.66147859922179

8762888,5,B01GGPI1R6,"WARNING SPOILERS!!! ""...and He Makes House Calls!"" Retire all your blurry and dark Paragon and ThrillerVideo fullscreen VHS tapes of this Americanized version of ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST (released by Terry Levene's Aquarius Releasing in 1981) because Severin Films found vault elements of this much-requested title in New York and released it on a two-disc Blu-Ray set (with the original Italian film, which was previously released on DVD by Shriek Show with a reversible cover), loaded with great extras that brought back long-suppressed memories of my time seeing films in Times Square. I prefer this version over the original or one reason: Walter E. Sear's effective electronic music score, which adds a lot to what is basically a mash-up of  Italian cannibal and zombie genres, making the film move at a much quicker pace (Nico Fidenco's score in the original adds nothing to the film in my opinion).
  The film opens with unrelated footage from an unfinished 7-part 1978 zombie anthology film called TALES THAT WILL TEAR YOUR HEART OUT (There is more footage of this film as an extra on the Blu-Ray, where we also learn Wes Craven was also one of the seven directors). We then watch as some disguised stranger enters the morgue of a teaching hospital in New York City, where he saws off the hand of a male corpse. This hospital has been experiencing a series of missing body parts and organs, so they set up a trap for the thief. We then see the thief cut out the heart of a still-living patient (some trap!) and begins to eat it, but he is caught by Dr. Drydock (Walter Patriarca; CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE - 1980) and it turns out he is an orderly at the hospital named Toran (Turam Quibo; ADIOS SABATA - 1970, using the name ""Joseph Persaud""), a native of the Moluccas tribe in the West Indies who pray to Kito, the Cannibal God. Before Dr. Drydock can question him, Toran bolts and jumps through a hospital window, falling to his death (an obvious dummy loses its right arm when it hits the pavement!). Nurse Lori Ridgeway (Alexandra Delli Colli; NEW YORK RIPPER - 1982) notices that Toran has the symbol of Kito tattooed on his chest, a symbol that represents a tribe of cannibals in the Moluccas Islands. Lori knows this because she is an anthropology nut and she has a ceremonial dagger with the symbol of Kito hanging on a wall in her home (it ends up missing).
  We then see Lori traveling to the West Indies with Dr. Peter Chandler (Ian McCulloch; CONTAMINATION - 1980), N.Y. Express reporter Susan Kelly (Sherry Buchanan; EYES BEHIND THE STARS - 1977), whose newspaper is financing this expedition, and jack-of-all-trades George Harper (Peter O'Neal; his only film), Once they arrive on one of the islands, they are greeted by Dr. Obrero (Donald O'Brien; GHOSTHOUSE - 1987) and he assigns Molotto (Dakar; real name: Alejandro Dakar; ATOR, THE FIGHTING EAGLE - 1982) to guide them on their expedition to find the tribe that worship Kito. That night, Lori finds a severed, rotting head (complete with maggots) in her bed, along with the symbol of Kito drawn in blood on the sheet. Dr. Obrero assures Lori that if the natives wanted her dead she would be dead (How comforting!). The next morning they begin their expedition through the jungle (without Dr. Obrero), but it is obvious that Molotto is not leading them to their intended destination.
  The party lose some of their native crew to spiked booby-traps and they are eventually taken prisoner by a tribe of cannibals, who devour George alive (they slice open George's stomach and chow down on his intestines; they even poke out his eyes with their fingers and eat them!), but just when it looks like curtains for Peter and Lori (Susan is nowhere to be found), some rotting zombies appear in the jungle and scare the cannibals away. Lori, Peter and Molotto run quickly through the jungle and discover that Dr. Obrero is waiting for them. Just what is he doing in the jungle? Peter grows suspicious of Dr. Obrero and rightfully so. It seems the not-so-good doctor wants them to leave the island as quickly as possible. But just what exactly is he up to? Peter aims to find out and takes Lori with him (they decline Dr. Obrero's offer to have Molotto show them the way). After surviving zombie attacks and other jungle booby-traps (Peter kills one zombie with the spinning blades of an outboard motor to its head), they finally discover what Dr. Obrero is doing. They think they see Susan, but it turns out to be a zombie wearing Susan's scalp! We see Dr. Obrero operating on a still-alive (but hairless and scalpless) Susan (he cuts her vocal cords because her screams annoy him!). Dr. Obrero is actually the Dr. Butcher of the title and he is trying to transplant living brains into dead bodies, thereby being the first person to successfully perform a brain transplant. All his previous tries have been failures (which is why there are zombies everywhere) and he tells Peter that he hopes to expand human life by over a hundred years, but he believes he needs civilized brains for his operation to be successful. He plans on using Peter's brain to reach his goal. Will Dr. Butcher be successful?
  Filmed on the same sets as director Lucio Fulci's gut-munching classic ZOMBIE (1979; also starring Ian McCulloch), this film bears striking similarities to that movie. They both contain extreme gore and eating of body parts, the zombie makeups are nearly the same (although both are done by different special effect makeup artists) and contain some amazing nudity from the female cast (Alexandra Delli Colli does a totally nude sequence at the end of the film that will remind fans of cannibal cinema of Ursula Andress' scene in MOUNTAIN [SLAVE] OF THE CANNIBAL GOD - 1978. Alexandra is a beautiful woman and this is why nudity is important in horror films!). This was director Marino Girolami's (VIOLENT ROME - 1975; A SPECIAL COP IN ACTION - 1976), here using his ""Frank Martin"" pseudonym, only horror film (he passed away in 1994). He was the father of exploitation vets, director Enzo G. Castellari (THE LAST SHARK - 1981; THE NEW BARBARIANS - 1983; LIGHT BLAST - 1985) and actor Ennio Girolami (THE FEAST OF SATAN - 1971; DAY OF THE COBRA - 1980). The screenplay of DR. BUTCHER was written by Romano Scandariato (EMANUELLE AND THE LAST CANNIBALS [a.k.a. TRAP THEM AND KILL THEM] - 1977) based on a story by Fabrizio De Angelis, director/writer of such films as OPERATION NAM (1989) and KILLER CROCODILE (1989).
  But the real treat on this double Blu-Ray set is not the films at all, but the interview with 86 year-old Terry Levene, who regales us with the history of Aquarius Releasing (They distributed some of the goriest Italian films during the '70s, including the unredeemable BURIED ALIVE [a.k.a. BEYOND THE DARKNESS - 1979; just listening to Levene's opinion of this film is worth the price of admission!], MAKE THEM DIE SLOWLY [a.k.a. CANNIBAL FEROX - 1981] and 7 DOORS OF DEATH [a.k.a. THE BEYOND - 1981], all heavy moneymakers for Aquarius). Levene looks like a balding and slightly overweight Jewish man who has a fondness for saying ""So on and so forth..."", yet his knowledge of the films he distributed and the history of ""The Deuce"" (Times Square) are second to none. I could have watched him talking for over two hours and be satisfied with my purchase (Levene had an office above the Selwyn Theater, located in the heart of The Deuce, where I originally saw this film.), but there are many other extras on the disc, including: a tour of Times Square with Temple Of Schlock's Chris Poggiali and filmmaker Roy Frumkes (STREET TRASH - 1987), who share many stories about their time at the Deuce; an entertaining interview with Gore Gazette's Rick Sullivan, who discusses the William Castle-like promotion he did for this film (The ""Butchermobile', a flatbed truck where Psychotronic Video's Michael Weldon played a victim to Gary Hertz's Doctor Butcher, while Sullivan ballyhooed the film over a loud speaker), his encounters with Bill Landis (whom I have nothing but bad memories of, but that's a story for another day) and the U.S. Postal Service raiding his house for selling underage VHS videos of Traci Lords (Sullivan said one Postal Agent told him, ""If you used UPS, we wouldn't be here""!); and so much more. This may be my favorite Blu-Ray set of all time (it even comes with a replica barf bag, which was originally handed out to patrons when it played in Aquarius Theaters). Thanks, Severin, for bringing back all those memories I long thought I forgot! Everyone who has ever stepped foot in Times Square should search out this Blu-Ray. It's essential. The film is Unrated.",1510790400,,8658,4.792364367046216

So anyway, back to the Severin Blu Ray. Perfect HD transfer, tons of interviews, 2 different versions of the film, trailers, reversible sleeve, and what Blu Ray would be complete without a barf bag? And at a really sweet price. Well done, Severin. Classic Italian gore, classic English dubbing, and a great score.
