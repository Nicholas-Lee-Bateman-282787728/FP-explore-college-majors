6161565,5,B00HF98SU8,If you family can't get enough of Po and the Kung-Fu Panda gang this is a great collection of stories from the cartoon series. Over 2 hours of entertainment and adventure!,1403568000,,171,4.548387096774194
6161566,5,B00HF98SU8,"My son loves Kung Fu Panda; this DVD is great because when he is done playing with other things in his room and becomes bored, Kung Fu Panda holds his attention.",1402876800,,161,4.225806451612903
6161567,5,B00HF98SU8,"This appears to be the third collection of Legends of Awesomeness episodes, after 'Good Croc, Bad Croc' and 'The Scorpion King', to be released.  They  continue with the same Panda Bear- Dragon Warrior silliness, a story with a simple moral, and colorful graphics which delight our family no end.

DreamWorks is slowly putting these out from their hit cable series.  The episodes run about 20+ minutes, and they pack a lot of comedy and character in each.  Here they include: Master Ping, Shifu's Back, Terror Cotta, The Midnight Stranger, Shoot the Messenger, Secret Admirer and Huge.

The  voice overs, even without Jack Black, and the stories are great.  Our kids laugh and giggle while, good intending but can't help himself, Po, invariably, has to clean-up the mess or make amends for not listening, not paying attention or just simply getting in trouble while at the same time fighting off goofy villains, all to Shifu's and Tigress' chagrin.

More's a comin'- Sweet!",1395014400,3,973,4.9937888198757765
