1877006,5,B000092T5X,"Director Jorge Olquin's Eternal Blood (Sangre Eterna) is one stylish and creepy little horror film.  Budgetary limitations are overcome with creativity by the talented director, cast and crew.
Four friends, all ""Goths,"" are enthralled by the vampire role playing game Eternal Blood.  To them, especially their ""leader"" M, the game is an essential part of life.  Unfortunately for them, they run afoul of some nasty real-life vampires lead by the appropriately named Dahmer, causing their dreamed up horrors to become all too real.
The director wisely steers clear of the many cliches of the vampire sub-genre, focusing instead on a reality that can be bent, twisted and ultimately cracked.  His characters, especially M, are not the typical hard partying idiots that crop up in so many horror films, but are instead lonely outcasts who have found a sense of community and home among the ranks of the Goth culture.  As a result, the viewer can readily sympathize with their plight and root for them.
The spfx are well done and not overblown or over played.  The score, accentuated by several Spanish Goth bands, is excellent, perfectly complementing the visuals.  The sets and cinematography are atmosphereic and rich in detail, aiding to the suspension of one's disbelief.
All-in-all, a great film.  See this film if you are a horror fan, or if you are looking for a few creatively off-beat chills.  You won't be disappointed.",1057536000,6,1426,5.05982905982906
1877007,5,B000092T5X,"i quite simply loved this movie!! after seeing it reveiwed in fangoria magazine i was itching to view it.
The film is above independant standard and loses nothing in the fact its made in chile.
The goth scenes and vampire makeup are really well done and for once a little time and thought has been spent on doing a good plot.
The music in the movie is also spot on and the language barrier again poses no problem to your enjoyment.
Give this movie a spin and Razor blade Smile too, you won't regret it !",1057276800,2,503,4.25

1877009,2,B000092T5X,"This movie makes the vampire-genre look like a board game. ""Roll the dice and see where your vampire destiny takes you."" is pretty much the moral to this movie. The only reason I'm not rating this junk one star is because it was a pretty brave step to take ""vampire movie"" to this new area, but it was a waste of my and their money and time.
Don't look sad, Chile, you have many more chances in the future to try again. For our sake, I hope not...",1056844800,,447,4.090909090909091
1877010,3,B000092T5X,"A good effort was given to shoot this movie. In a place were local horror film makers do not exist (Chile), it's good to see that some people take time and money to develop an area that is not quite explored in this part of the world... The movie itself: A Journalism student called Carmilla is attracted to a guy (called just ""M"") and starts playing a Role Play Game called ""Eternal Blood"" were they play vampiric characters along with other friends. Soon ""M"" discovers that some of the guys he knows are acting strange and starts to fear that perhaps the game is more real than he ever thought...
Good make-up, excellent opening credit sequence (the best part of the movie, some say), perhaps a little bad acting from some minor characters (kind of El Mariachi...). But A LOT BETTER than those old vampire flicks from Jess Franco.
I recommend it only to extreme Horror & Vampire fans anyway.",1056585600,5,893,4.5875
7988751,3,B000092T5X,"I admit when I first watched this movie years ago...I thought it was horrible just horrible. The only good part was see the ""lead"" girl naked. I quote lead cause about a third of the way through the focus shifts from her as the main character to one of the males. All that was before I got more interested into plot development and mythology. As years went by and I thought about it, its not a bad movie. While the twist at the end has been done before in some ways it still works. Plus there is an interesting theory used for why violence was used in the Inquisition and medieval trials. Its differently worth checking out.",1299110400,,624,4.3418803418803416
7988752,5,B000092T5X,"This movie is now one of my favorites, sure it may not be Oscar material but its definitely a fun, mystery, and gore filled flick. I love that it is foreign and introduces you to an incredible soundtrack that really fits all the scenes. I was a little confused at first but this movie is a must-see for anyone into vampires and the gothic music subculture. The outfits and atmospheres the characters get into are also well put. Good movie to play at a party or gathering with likeminded people.",1261267200,,494,4.5
7988753,3,B000092T5X,I do not recommend buying this at full price. Look for it used. It's ok but you are being ripped off if you pay full price. It's not that good.,1253404800,,143,3.8
7988754,4,B000092T5X,"""Eternal Blood"" (aka ""Sangre Eterna"") is a vampire flick from Chile that is a very unique if unfocused film.  Don't let the cover art deceive you; this is not any action-packed gorefest.  Traditional and standard are the last things this film is.  Rather, it seems to be a coming together of a lot of different aspects and stories into one film and it's almost magnificent.  But due to some really bad pacing issues, forgettable characters, and elements that don't seem to blend together or are introduced then forgotten, a film that could have been amazing has to settle for just being well above average.  Good enough for me.

The initial premise of ""Eternal Blood"" is a group of Chilean goth kids who get into a vampire role-playing game.  The scenes where they play the game are exciting as the imaginations of the players come alive onscreen and we see them battling vampire-hunting nuns and priests in red and black blasting away with shotguns.  The whole thing is very exciting to watch and when a female player rips a hunter's head off and holds it above her mouth to drink the blood from the dangling esophagus I knew this flick was definitely for me.  Unfortunately, this premise is quickly discarded and the vast majority of the rest of the film is sadly violence and gore-free.  What is is, however, is unique.  The friends begin attending vampire-themed parties and one character in particular sees this as a bad influence as his friends drift apart from him in favor of the drugs and company of strangers.  Also, he thinks the hosts of the parties is a vampire who is controlling them all.  Yeah, that could be a problem; especially when nobody else seems to see what he's seeing.  Is it time to get start dipping silver bullets in holy water or does homeboy just need to chill out?

I know I said the characters are forgettable, but that's not entirely true.  Lead actress Blanca Lewin does a great job and exudes a certain low-key charm in her role as ""Carmilla"".  It's worth noting that the characters are all referred to only in their role-playing names.  An interesting choice for sure. I also enjoyed a brief scene on the bus where the friends get a little rowdy and mock bite each other.  My favorite bit was when one asks an lady holding a chihuahua about her pet bat. The troubled ""M"" begins a romance with Carmilla that is never really explored or given value aside from a pretty hot sex scene. Much of the film is spent building up the tension on whether or not M is losing his mind, which is a pretty great idea. Unfortunately, the story elements don't always gel together.  There is a professor Romero in the story who is seen lecturing about Catholic history which if handled better could have given the story a punch in the gut, but punches are definitely pulled and I feel it fails to tie-in with the story and becomes just another bit of jumble. There are aspects of counter-cultural exploration, fantasy, psychedelia, horror, romance, social commentary, and psychological thriller in this film with a twist of Hitchcockian suspense.  This sounds like the movie of the decade when I say it like that, but again I wish the elements had been tied together better.  The climax pulls a triple-whammy on you and really puts this one in the must-see category for me.  The DVD includes an alternate ending that would have killed it and I'm really glad they cut it off in favor of an abrupt ""Ah-Ha!"" twist that leaves you with a twisted smile.

The end result is a story that feels confused and rambling at times, but still delivers on several levels.  Vampire fanatics owe it to themselves to give this a watch.  I haven't seen anything like it and that alone warrants a hearty recommendation.  It's also nice to see people who are even more obsessed with vampires then I am starring in a film.  Makes me feel normal. ""Eternal Blood"" is good times that could have been great, but it sure beats the hell out of most of the vampire titles out there.  The music rocks, too.  The really ironic thing about it is that it ends right at the moment it feels like the story is really getting started.  Bummer.

3 1/2 stars, rounded up for a new take on an old genre, which is always worth a look.

Also, do yourself a favor and watch it in Spanish with subtitles because the lip-syncing on the English dub is absolutely horrendous.",1252800000,3,4346,4.5880829015544045
7988755,5,B000092T5X,"Don't let the cover of DVD fool you. This movie has great characters, music, gothic dark fashion. Has a great story line with a twist at the end.  I also liked the extras in the main menu includes a fashion show, music videos. The director opens a door to the underground life in the country of Chile.  I love Chile Goths !!!!!!",1229904000,,328,4.274193548387097

7988757,3,B000092T5X,"Ok this is a cool flick but I must say I was thrown off by the roll playing game deal.
I always thought nerds and geeks played roll games like D&D, maybe I am wrong.
The movie has some stuff in it that is pretty original and the screener I saw was balls to the wall blood and guts, not yet rated. I hope they did not chop it up to bad for the ""R"" rating.
You should see this film if you like the blood suckers, forget the party poopers who were cutting this movie apart, it's worth your time.",1153094400,3,492,3.881188118811881

7988759,3,B000092T5X,"I only rented this because my favorite band, the Chileans LUCYBELL did a song for the movie. I was expecting a typical dumb vampire flick with terrible acting, etc.
Let me say, this was better than most of the hollywood glossy garbage that has been coming out as of late. Kudos to the director for making the most out of a small budget. The plot is interesting, as are the loner, goth teenage characters. While the acting and script (Chilean slang) left a bit to be desired, I was still mildly surprised, and was glad to see that there was actually some thought put into this project. I will be keeping my eye on this director.",1077840000,2,627,4.413793103448276
7988760,3,B000092T5X,"Some people may not like this movie, but aside from Bela Lugosi in the original Dracula of the 30s, no vampire movie has ever exactly been considered Oscar material. Sangre Eterna is no exception. However, it does manage to keep you entertained, which is what a movie is supposed to do. Right? It may be low budget, but it is a good combination of gore, mild suspense, and a fairly good mystery. The only thing I could think of that would make people not like this movie is that it's in Spanish and it might be confusing if you can't understand the language, but I'm pretty sure that the DVD comes with the English dolby option so there really shouldn't be any problem.",1065744000,5,669,4.4471544715447155
