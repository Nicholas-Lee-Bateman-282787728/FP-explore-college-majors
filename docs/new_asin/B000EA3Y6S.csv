""The Penguin"" (as Mr. Bingham calls himself) shares his journey to fitness with honesty and sincerity.  The DVD takes you through the basics of beginning running, including the proper clothing, nutrition and attitude.  It will change your life!",1139961600,3,353,5.051724137931035
8107885,5,B000EA3Y6S,"John and Coach Jenny's approach has really changed my life!  I have wanted to run for many years - only to keep thinking about how I wanted to do so, but never with the nerve to tackle this ""dream"".  Between John and Coach Jenny, this ""dream"" of mine is becoming a reality.  John's humor and humble approach convinced me that if he could do it, I could, too! Coach Jenny's wealth of knowledge and comfortable approach gave me the right tools to not be afraid and tackle my dream one step at a time.  I never would have thought about a run / walk approach.  Then again, I never would have thought about running a half marathon ... or maybe even more!  Who knew?  This DVD is both entertaining and very informative.  I have watched it numerous times already ... and each time I pick up just a little bit more!",1139184000,5,807,4.298013245033113
8107886,5,B000EA3Y6S,"John and Coach Jenny's methods have really opened up a whole new world to me. I never, ever thought I would be a runner...let alone enjoy the process! They really do emphasize the ""fun"" of it all. I now look forward to my run/walks and have even signed up for my first marathon this coming June! Yikes!

John's story is so inspirational and well told that I figure ""if he can do it....I can do it!""

Get this DVD. John clearly explains the jargon and lingo that can sometimes be intimidating for the newbie.  Worth every penny. Life changing!!!",1138665600,4,544,4.474747474747475
8107887,5,B000EA3Y6S,"The title of this DVD is a bit misleading.  While runners, and people who want to start running or walking, might get the most out of it, the health information on this DVD will benefit anyone who wants to lose weight or just get into shape.

The DVD is a great mix of John Bingham's hilarious and inspirational stories about going from a couch potato to an athlete and Coach Jenny's practical advice on how you can make the same changes in your life.  The DVD has solid, easy to understand information on things like good nutrition, buying the right shoes, and how to start a training program.  If you want to get into shape, but don't know how, this is the DVD for you.",1138579200,2,671,4.344
8107888,5,B000EA3Y6S,"Run For Fun is both informational and entertaining.  Great tips on all the basics, from running form, run/walking, work out schedules, to what shoes and clothes to buy.  But I really loved that it teaches running is not intimidating, anyone can do it, no matter how fast or far you run. I have never seen a DVD that captures the spirit of running like this DVD does. Very inspirational and funny too.",1138233600,4,400,4.541666666666667
