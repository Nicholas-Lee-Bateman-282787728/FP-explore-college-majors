8398542,5,B003JYTN5W,"This is a fun collection of 3 1930s Westerns, the first one, Two Fisted Law even has John Wayne and Walter Brennan. Walter Brennan looked old even then. Tim McCoy is the lead hero and does it well, bringing a quite cool to the role. McCoy loses his ranch to crooked cheat named Russell, and sets upon searching for silver to buy it back. But Russell hatches a plot with Walter Brennan, who plays a dirty deputy.
Border Law is about a Texas ranger who seeks to avenge the death of his kid brother. It's a fun one with Buck Jones as our hero.
The Phantom Cowboy is a weird addition. The acting and dialogue could have been inpired by Ed Wood it's so odd. The weirdest part is the sidekick, Ptomaine Pete, who delivers his lines like the Cowardly Lion on crack. The hero is played by actor Ted Wells,who seriously can't act; so much so that he's fascinating to watch. The plot involves a masked bandit who happens to be identical to our hero. The phantom is not our bad guy however. Anyway it's a fun movie in a cheesy bizarre sense. Also there are some movie trailers included to round out this fun DVD.",1273017600,2,1101,4.323671497584541
