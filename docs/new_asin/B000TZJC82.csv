This volume has been sitting in my review pile for weeks waiting to be reviewed. Before I put it in I asked a couple of people I know what their opinions of it were and for the most part I got some favorable reviews and while I'm not necessarily saying that this first volume was bad, I will say that I found way too many aspects of it done poorly. The writing can border on cheesy, the animation looks like something that Walt Disney dreamed up after a weekend bender and the story has left me less than impressed thus far. I'm not going to recommend it to others but if you find yourself bored with nothing else to do, this anime might help you kill  a couple of hours at least until you find something better to do or watch.",1213747200,,783,4.178807947019868

 Fans of the manga series will be glad to know that this is in fact the more recent TV series adaptation and not the ""Phoenix 2772"" movie from 1980 (which is based on the tone of the manga rather than any actual story arc).

If you're not familiar with these stories you may want to read up on the Phoenix series before committing to this.  The message in Phoenix is as simple as it is far reaching. Life, Love, Death, Power, Resurrection, Redemption, Renewal.

The first 4 episodes contain story arcs from Dawn with Nagi and Saruta and Queen Himiko.  Episode 5 starts the Resurrection storyline with Leon and Chichiro.  If you are familiar with the Phoenix series or even Tezuka you will find some of the scenes (especially the growing bond between Nagi and Saruta) really effective in this format.  Dawn is frought with battles and death, and while it's not gory, seeing Tezuka's doe eyed Disneylike animals slump over in death could be disturbing to some.  Same with human deaths.

Quality is consistent with an animated TV show not as smooth as movie quality animation but computer effects do make things look sooooo much better then an anime TV show of even 10 years ago. Sometimes however, it seems a bit out of place and distracting.  I also wish the they could have edited the commercial cuts somehow.

While I will continue to buy these subsequent volumes as they become available I wonder why they didn't release what I believe is a 15 episode series as a box set.  Maybe because they are testing the waters?

Extras include a textless opening and closing credit sequence....and that's it.  Seems a shame with the Phoenix series having such a rich history. You'd think they could have at least found one Tezuka geek to do a documentary or commentary track.  Or a booklet.  Or a color postcard of Osamu to frame and put in my shrine.  Or a coupon for 20% off Tezukaworld.

But no matter, I am very happy to have this in my collection and would guess that most any Tezuka fan would feel the same",1194307200,16,2142,4.574803149606299
