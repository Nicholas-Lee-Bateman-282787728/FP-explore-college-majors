5794864,1,B00DELKA2U,Just got this and am extremely disappointed!  Live_Evil's download of this series was a thousand times better in picture quality and sound.  The English subtitles in this are also completely incorrect! They are so bad I don't believe they even got somebody who was Japanese to do them.  The  main reason I bought the set was to get proper subtitles. Save your money!  Just download the series.  There was a special edition of this series released in Japan which is unfortunately not available here  and really should have been used for this box set considering it was released last year.  I believe this is the edition that is available for download.,1406332800,3,650,4.792792792792793

5794867,5,B00DELKA2U,"This 42-episode, 1978 series was based on the first Harlock manga series (published in Play Comics from '77 - '79) by the legendary Leiji Matsumoto and directed by the equally renowned Rin Taro (now Rintaro), and was animated by Toei.
The series, in Japanese with English subtitles, is here presented in perfect form, retaining the original Japanese main and episode title cards, credits text, eyecatches and next-episode previews, and with crystal clear audio & video.
It was previously released here, in TV syndication only, in the not so perfect form of Captain Harlock and the Queen of a Thousand Years, a version concocted for Harmony Gold by Robotech 'creator' Carl Macek, who expanded the Harlock series to the then-requisite length of 65 episodes (the minimum needed for weekday 'stripping') by intercutting scenes from another Toei Matsumoto series, New Tale of Taketori: Queen Millennia, which also featured female invaders.
Prior to this there were two 2-episode video compilations, released by Family Home Entertainment, but adapted by or for ZIV (formerly General Service Studios; under both names they provided studio space and facilities for many well known TV shows of the 50's & 60's).  Both were feature cuts, with the original opening animation, sans credits and with a new rock theme song, at both ends, the first of episodes 1 & 9, closely adapted but with the supporting character names 'Americanized', the second of episodes 2 & 3, for some reason given a 'camp' treatment and goofy new supporting chara names...
But anyway (I could go on all day about ZIV's poor treatment of their 80's anime imports), thanks to producer Discotek Media and releaser Eastern Star (apparently a division of Toei) we can now see this series as it was meant to be seen!
As for the story--well, you wouldn't want me to spoil it for you, would you? (Younger fans may snarf at the quality of the animation, but remember, as some famous old guy once said, the story's the thing, or something like that anyhow.)
Matsumoto fans may also want to check out Eastern Star's superb releases of the Galaxy Express 999 TV series and movies, though at present only the first set of the latter (episodes 1 - 38 of 113) is available; the first two films include the Viz Video dubbing; all three include original theatrical trailers.
Get 'em all (from Amazon of course); you won't regret it.",1385337600,8,2378,4.930174563591023

But now I must truly say that this 'old-school' 1970's anime is now my favorite show ever, not just my favorite anime show, my favorite show period. I stumbled across the first episode while looking for movies on Cracked.com and with no pre-expectations and knowledge I started watching it. Of course with a title like 'Space Pirate Captain Harlock' one can't help but make certain assumptions, but what really threw me off was the unexpected relationship Captain Harlock has with an orphaned 7-year old girl named Mayu, whom he risks his life to visit after a years' absence to give her her birthday present. I had been expecting things like space-battles, gun-fights and other pirate-y shanagins, but not this. The scene where he and Mayu reunite was so sweet and moving (think Pixar-film sweet and moving) that I knew then that here was something special, something I had not encountered in a long time: a powerful and commanding hero with the heart and humility to spend time with a little girl who thinks the world of him (we actually see her praying to God to delay her birthday a year or two so Harlock won't come visit her and be arrested). This is what really hooked me, and after finding the whole series available on HuluPlus, I dove in.

The world of Captain Harlock is set in the far future, around 2977 AD. The whole Earth has been united under a one-world government (the United Federation of Earth). Mankind has finally achived the peaceful and idealistic life liberals are always seeking after, and now they live in both a Utopian and distopian world. It is Utopian because technological advances have enabled food and luxury items to be produced in vast quantities on other planets and moons by robots, enabling humans to cease working and to enjoy an unbridled lifestyle of sloth and wasteful indulgence. With the threat of hunger removed, both the ruling class and the citizenry alike pursue a life of unending entertainment and because of this they have become a lazy, spiritless and cowardly race of men perpetually pacified by soap operas, fashion shows, horse and dog racing, baseball, golfing and alcohol. The decay of the natural world and the blue oceans are taken as a thing for granted and the Seas of Space offer no hope or allure to those who can't see past the golf-club in their hand or the winning grayhound at the race-track. It is indeed a 'perfect' world - for those who have forfeited a life of sacrifice and integrity for one of hedonistic-based comfort. However, the Government controls all these manufactured pleasures, and because it still fears a possible revolt, it bombards the civilian population with sublimal images on TV screens to keep them from questioning their way of life or how pathetic they have become as a people. The Prime Minister of the Earth (who is never named) is a perfect example of this: instead of being presented as an all-powerful evil dictator, he is instead a short, mild-mannered, laid-back man who cares only about golfing and dog-racing and the winning of elections. He is 'evil' not because of the things he does, but what he doesn't/refuses to do. Even when the military is called out to do something, the solders all seem board and sleepy  - evidently the desire to be entertained trumps the desire to wield power; incompetence and apathy are the rule of the day and there is virtually no crime or dissident at all. However, there are Space-Pirates. Apparently, this 'perfect' world is not quite perfect for everybody...

Enter Captain Harlock. The most feared and hated of all the space-pirates, Harlock is disgusted by the state of mankind and has rebelled against the government, and when we encounter him for the first time he is robbing a transport ship filled with food, alcohol and diamonds. He takes to food and dumps the booze and diamonds into space to show his contempt of the world's hedonistic lifestyle. Harlock is a man who is clearly out of place in history (and still would be if he were around today). The picture of him on the front case of this DVD collection does him full justice: he is a tall stoic Germanic Caucasian with a distinct European aristocratic air of nobility and refinement about him, coupled with a sense of rugged American defiance and individuality, as well as possessing a code of ethics and a sense of chivalry. Wrapped in a great black-and-red cape and sporting an eyepatch and a long facial scar that in no way diminishes his good looks, Harlock stands or sits gazing out silently upon the Earth or into the depths of the stellar seas from the bridge of the Arcadia, his great space battleship, his innermost thoughts a mystery, his plans and desires unknown. He and his sidekick crew of misfits live independent and free, cruising the galaxy at liberty under their Jolly Roger 'flag of freedom' and are terror and a thorn in the side the faint-hearted rulers of an otherwise perfectly established government world order. Because of this, the government blames Harlock for everything that goes wrong, including the recent and inexplicable bombings of astronomy facilities and the killing of astronomers all over Earth, for which Harlock is placed under the death penalty without even the consideration of a fair trail. Harlock, however, has little fear of the government and often flies the Arcadia over the cities, landing wherever he wants, much to the annoyance of the top military commander Kiruta, who sees it as his God-given mission to kill Harlock in whatever devious way possible.

It is during this spiritless age of decadence and sloth that an ancient alien race called the Mazone makes ready to conquer and occupy the Earth. The Mazone have long ago staked out the Earth from the times of the most ancient human civilizations, if not before, and they view it as their secondary homeworld and they claim to have every right to take it as their own. They appear in the form of beautiful women, sometimes more alien-like, sometimes indistinguishable from human woman, and many are secretly on Earth, setting up bases, collecting intel, mingling with the general human population, and getting things ready for the great invasion fleet that is slowly making its way through vast distances of space to 'their' other homeworld, Earth. Only Captain Harlock and a few brave astronomers and scientists who are keeping a close watch on the skies suspect something is wrong, but the Prime Minister and the other government leaders ignore and make fun of them, and soon the Mazone infiltrators begin killing off all who suspect that the Earth is secretly under attack. In spite of being woman, the Mazone are quite ruthless beings, possessing technology greater then man's and by holograms, illusions and other devious devices they wage intense emotional/psychological warfare on their enemies. Soon Harlock and the 41 crew members of the Arcadia are the only force that stands in their way, trying to protect an Earth that hates them from an enemy who wants to destroy them - a very depressing state of affairs when one really thinks about it. Indeed, there is a subtle undercurrent of loneliness and sadness that runs throughout the show. Captain Harlock doesn't really have a true home apart from the Arcadia; a 'normal' life on Earth is not an option for him, although his crew members are free to leave the ship whenever they decide that a pirate's life is not for them. Oddly enough, it is little Mayu and her fellow orphans who seem to have the best and most normal of lives, as they get to play outside in nature, are read classic stories and attend church. Mayu is Harlock's one true tie to Earth, and when they visit each other in between adventures and battles he seems to be the most happy and at peace, though that peace never lasts long, and as the stakes rise both he and Mayu suffer greatly for their friendship.

But in spite of the grim odds, it is the colorful characters and the greatness of the Arcadia that gives this show depth and personality and hope. Harlock and his crew are strong archetypes - Harlock is a powerful Romantic (in the old meaning of the word) hero; a man who is commanding but not cruel; stoic but not cold; a fierce fighter, but not vengeful or sadistic; gentle, but not weak. His First Mate, Yatteran, is a short pudgy braniac who, when not engaged in battle or giving random info, spends all his free time building endless intricate plastic models - from perfect mini replicas of the Arcadia to those of ships and planes of yore. He has a very child-like personality, and often dashes about the bridge zooming his planes around in imaginary warfare. He is very resolute and positive, and I quickly fell in love with his character. There is the newcomer, Tadashi Daiba, the young hot-headed son of a murdered astronomer who is out for revenge and has much to learn about being an outlawed pirate and a man. Then there Kei Yuki, a sweet blonde who serves as the navigator, and Dr Zero, a soft-spoken drunken doctor with a dubious medical history who has trained his pet kitten, Mii, to steal booze from Masu, the hyper knife-wielding cook who rules the kitchen with an iron fist and is often chasing Mii and Harlock's pet bird, Tori, up and down the corridors, waving her knives and threatening to to carve them up into dinner entrees if they steal any more food. The most interesting character, however, is Miimi, an alien woman (not a Mazone) who has no visible mouth but has a very beautiful voice and a very feminine nature. She plays a harp and is often seen drinking straight from the bottle, but for her, booze is a natural part of her diet. Actually, owing to the nature of their lives and the endless stress of fighting the Mazone and escaping Commander Kiruta's traps, Harlock and the bulk of his crew are shameless alcoholics. In the future, almost all the booze is bubble-gum pink and cheap, and Harlock slams it back continuously from a crystal glass, although his tolerance must be very high, as he is never shown to be actually wasted. But one must not be fooled: one minute the crew is passed out in the corridors in a state of seeming intoxication, then suddenly the enemy is spotted, the alarm blares, Harlock starts bellowing orders, and 20 seconds later we're in the middle of an epic space-battle. In this show things are never quite what they seem.

But it is perhaps the Arcadia itself that really takes the cake. This epic pirate ship is a cool blend of a spaceship, WWII battleship, the Black Pearl and fighter jet. Designed by Harlock's genius best friend in defiance of the government and as a symbol of hope and freedom for those who seek it, the mysterious and powerful Arcadia is the glue that holds Harlock and his crew together. Captain Harlock often steers it by hand using an old-fashioned ships' wheel (see case cover) and it is full of surprising gadgets and devices that come well in handy in tight spots, much to the surprise of the prideful Mazone. The cowardly men on Earth flee as its dark shadow passes over their dull tranquil cities, and at their peril do the Mazone confront it. There is no ship like it, and it is the pride and joy and dominion of the space pirate Captain Harlock: the two are inseparable - there is no Arcadia without Captain Harlock, and no Captain Harlock without the Arcadia. The ship became as familiar to me as the Enterprise of the original Star Treak series and watching it kick Mazone ass while violating all the laws of space-physics put me into a state of child-like joy - fist pumping included. This show, while serious and dark at times, is also just plain FUN; it is vintage Escapist Entertainment, and I would come home from a hectic day at work with the sole intention of crashing in front of an episode or two. I found myself giggling, really giggling, at the antics of some of the heroes; each character stands out unique and lovable and I was always cheering them on throughout all their trails and crazy adventures.

Another neat thing about this show is that because it was made in the Seventies, you have a world that blends futuristic technology with modern technology that now - in the year 2013 - is almost obsolete. Hence, you have spaceships but no email; super computers but no cell phones. Harlock and Mayu have to sit down and write actual letters to each other, and personal info and data is stored on cassette tapes. Telephones are still attached to the walls and the Arcadia requires a lot of hands-on attention in order to function. After a failed attempt on his life, Harlock sends a short teasing fax message to a foe from space, and good old-fashioned WWII-esq tanks and fighter jets are just the thing to send out against alien starships. I got quite a kick out of the technology mish-mash (I still remember when phones were still attached to walls and having to record music onto cassette taps) and it added another clean layer of enjoyment to the show. Plus, space was still a more mysterious place back then, a 'sea' of opportunity, and the imagination had more leeway to have fun in it.

 And last but not least, this series contains a delightful amount of Political Incorrectness: The social structure of the Arcadia is quite patriarchal. The women Masu, Kei and Miimi are not in the top positions of power - although Kei is the navigator and often on the bridge. They are quite content with their positions and duties - they never bitch at/behind Harlock or talk back to him or detonate any drama bombs in regards to their lot aboard the ship. They may voice objections or concerns upon occasion, but they always respect Harlock's authority and decisions - even if they don't always agree with or understand them. Captain Harlock clearly is 'The Man' - the captain-king of the Arcadia and everyone knows it. His genuine masculinity is manifested in every facial expression, every gesture, every command. His character showcases his superior gender, code of honor, race, intelligence, physical form, values and moral judgment. He is no moony sappy sissy. He is not shown to be in a constant state of weakness or indecision (which actually make his few moments of weakness and indecision more powerful). There are many things going through his head that we never know about. He is allowed his privacy. There are no Negro overlords back on Earth pulling his strings and telling him what to do; no shallow, cutsie, bug-eyed, bloated-booby woman waiting in his bed to provide that now-mandated 'romantic' touch to the story. Miime, who has pledged her life to him after he saved her, is not his simpering worry-ridden bedmate (i.e whore). She is a woman who, while having no official position aboard the Arcadia, is very devoted to Harlock, and the traditional and very feminine ways in which she ministers to him (playing the harp, bringing him wine, offering quite words of advice, concern or consolation in her beautiful voice) was so surprising and delightful that she quickly became one of my favorite characters. Subsequently, she understands the Captain better then anyone, and because he confides in her she knows things the other crew members don't. Their relationship is never expressed in a romantic or physical way (though it is a tender and moving one just the same) and while Harlock sometimes acts aloof or distant with her, Miimi never takes offence at him or demands that he alter his way of behaving around her. It is not Miimi's goal to 'change' Harlock (in the way human woman often want to change their menfolk) but to mearly stay by his side and quietly support him in all his endeavors, whatever they might be. Her most moving statement: ''I am the woman who has offered up her life to Harlock; I'd follow him into the depths of hell if he said he was going.'' Let the feminists yowl all they want - we need more human Miimis in this world. Her attention is not just limited to Harlock, she also aids the rest of the crew, often helping Dr. Zero when others are hurt or sick.

Indeed, there is very little in the way of romance (which I found refreshing) in this tale and the story doesn't suffer for it at all. Captain Harlock has a mental list of top priorities and screwing around is apparently nowhere on it. Although strong and handsome, he is no womanizer and never tries to take advantage of anyone; he appears to have withdrawn himself emotionally and often physically from the rest of his comrades and remains wrapped in a cloak of quiet continuous melancholy. While he does care about the rest of his crew, he doesn't seem to really need them - at least not for personal or social reasons - and he makes very few demands on them in return for allowing them to live on-board his ship, and when not engaged in robbery, repairs or battle everyone pretty much spends their time goofing around at leisure. Despite the fact that they are both young and attractive, there is no chemistry between the Captain and Kei, and Harlock prefers to spend most of his time alone is his large, elegant cabin in the back of the ship, drinking, dozing, brooding and playing his ocarina. Only Miimi is allowed to be with him for long periods of time and they often will duet together with harp and ocarina while beautiful stars, planets and space-scenery go past the grand old-style viewing windows. These scenes are indeed quite romantic without actually being romantic. Harlock is a man of mystery, and he retains that mystery (and hence his charisma), for although we are treated to two excellent backstory episodes, they are only small windows into his past; we never find out how he got his scar or lost his eye. He seems to have doomed himself to a life of self-imposed exile, and while he could easily assassinate Earth's pathetic rulers and raze entire cities to the ground (yes, the Arcadia has that much firepower), he makes no demands and takes no human lives. For such a stoic privet man he is a very complex and interesting person. Also nice about this show is that there are no lame potty/sex jokes, no excessive amounts of blood spurting all over the place, no vulgarity, and, best of all, no nasty internal drama wars between the heroes (Tedashi does often have issues following orders though...).

With the hierarchy of crew members firmly established and Harlock at the helm, the Arcadia is run with the efficiency and elegance of a Swiss watch, in spite of the drinking binges (and occasional brawling), and thus these space-pirates wreck havoc upon legions of Mazone battleships and incur the wrath of the Mazone Queen, Lafresia. In contrast with the Arcadia, the Mazone are a matriarchal society - all the commanders, spies, assassins, soldiers and scientists are female. There is no male Mazone in a position of power to be seen. Queen Lafresia is a fitting and ruthless opponent for Harlock, with her deep, cold, authoritative voice and her determination to take the Earth matches his determination to defend it, something that puzzles her greatly. The funny thing is, is that while Harlock retains complete control over the Arcadia and has the devotion and loyalty of his crew to back him up, Queen Lafresia is often plagued with mutiny, rebellion and strife among the ranks of her warriors and scientists; she is often forced to execute, blow up, and kill many of her own people, who are expected to execute and blow themselves up upon failing a mission or capture. Harlock and the Queen develop a vague grudging respect for one another as leaders, but that doesn't get in the way of their desire to kill each other, and as the series progresses towards its somewhat predictable conclusion, the more fierce and desperate they become.

I'm quite sure that this anime was intended for children (there is a narrator to help explain things) but I enjoyed it thoroughly as an adult. My complaints are few: there are some storyline and animation glitches, some head-scratching 'huh?' moments that never quite get resolved or explained, and my personal pet peeve was that there were too many interesting characters that got introduced that only lasted for the duration of one episode. The music score, I would quickly like to add, is very classical, with triumphant drum rolls and horn blasts, somber piano, violin and harp themes, as well as poetic songs and cool pirate chants. The best of the OST though is Mayu's/Harlock's ocarina song, which is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard on any show or anime. You can also find a better translation of the opening theme-song in full on YouTube as well as the ocarina theme. As for the animation itself, I can only describe it in this way: simplistic yet rich. There are a lot of still shots and posturing, but seeing as Harlock looks just as epic standing still as he does when moving about, I really didn't care. I actually enjoyed the animation style more then I have other, more modern styles.

About the case and DVDs themselves: The case is sturdy enough, and the cover images on front and back are great. But the DVDs are stored overlapping one another, so you must be careful when taking them out, especially disks five and six, which are hard to remove. There are no bonus features and no previews, and the visual quality is better then on HuluPlus, but the overall images don't change. Each episode is roughly 25 minutes long. Note well, however, this is NOT an English-dubbed series. It is in full Japanese but the English subtitles are very good and the voice-acting is excellent.

5 Stars all the way -  thank you Rintaro and Leiji Matsumoto for such a wonderful story and characters. I intend to enjoy them for the rest of my life. I'm just puzzled why this series took so long to be available on DVD. I'm glad I became a fan when I did. I am now off to explore more of 'Leiji-verse'.",1378944000,55,22739,4.836886719753403
5794870,4,B00DELKA2U,"For the first time ever in North America, Captain Harlock has received an official release, featuring all 42 uncut episodes in one boxset. Like all animated series in Japan, Captain Harlock originally started as a manga series in 1977 by Leiji Matsumoto, the creator of Galaxy Express 999 and later became an anime series in 1978. The anime series provided to be successful not only in Japan but around the world. In France and Quebec, the show is known as ""Albator"" and in Latin America, the show is known as ""Capit&aacute;n Raymar"".I find the show to be very enjoyable, with tone being much more darker than Galaxy Express 999 and the art style very interesting to look at, though, like all of Matsumoto's works, they all look alike. My favorite character in show is obviously Captain Harlock. To me, Captain Harlock is the embodiment of hope yet he's very mysterious. Throughout the majority of the show, we, the audience, don't know much about his past other than he was wrongly accused of crimes he didn't comment. We are also guessing what is his connection with the little girl (which we see later on as the show process). It's a great show and runs at a great pace. This boxset comes with 6 discs with 7 episodes per disc and comes with a thick casing, with the DVDs overlapping each other. This may be a concern for those who don't want damaged discs, but likely the holders are very tight and secure. In terms of picture quality, the show looks fantastic in motion; there's a lot of grain throughout, but keep in mind that the show was produced using cell animated and was shot on film. The animation may snuff in comparison to modern day animation, but I think it has its charm. If I were to guess, the DVD uses direct transfers from the Japanese releases of the show. Unfortunately for those who like English dubs, this set is presented in Japanese with English subtitles, but it is worth noting that this series has gotten dubbed into English 3 times. The first dub produced in early 1980's was by ZIV International and was for episodes 1, 2, 3 and 9. For episodes 1 and 9, the ZIV dub was respectful towards the material, but episodes 2 and 9, not so much. The second dub produced in 1985 was called Captain Harlock and the Queeen of a Thousand Years. Produced by Streamline Pictures' Carl Macek, it combined both Captain Harlock and Matsumoto's own Queen Millennia. The third English was produced in 2009 by William Winckler Productions. Producer William Winckler, known for the English version of Tekkaman the Space Knight, wrote, produced and directed the English-dubbed compilations along with Toei Animation. I predict that the Winckler dub will probably get an official release by Shout Factory judging from their releases of Gaiking and Starzinger while the ZIV and Thousand Years dub most likely won't get an official release, however, both are available on video streaming sites such as Youtube. I highly recommend this set for fans of Leiji Matsumoto, sci-fi and Captain Harlock. While the lack of English dubs may be a drawback for some, the addition of English subtitles and great video quality with all 42 uncut episodes makes this set worth owning.",1377907200,29,3176,4.755434782608695
5794871,2,B00DELKA2U,"I was keen on revisiting this show as I had fond memories of watching it as a pre-teen in the late '80s-early '90s. It turned out what I had watched then was in fact the Harmony Gold bastardization of this Japanese series with another, unrelated series by the same writers, much like what Harmony Gold did with their Robotech series. Since I love the original Macross series (that was amalgamated as part 1 of Robotech), then it would stand to reason that the original Harlock series would also be superior to the American adulteration.

This show is famous, but surprisingly, it isn't very good. The basic plot synopsis is compelling, and there are some good episodes that support that. However, true to form of far too many Japanese TV shows and movies, the plot pacing is very poor. The good episodes that move the plot along can almost entirely be found in the first ten or so episodes, and then in the last 5-10. As is often the case, it's like the producers were given far too many episodes for the story they wrote. And yet, when it's time to wrap it up, they offer major plot developments at the 11th hour, things that could have been developed into a bunch of compelling episodes, but instead wrap it up in a matter of minutes.

The story could have been compelling and epic, but fails in spite of itself. The enemy army, in spite of being portrayed as an insurmountable behemoth, is nothing more than powerless paper soldiers. Within the scenarios that the show sets up, the development and plot arc is not believable in the least, and instead of becoming engrossed in a story, it feels more like the viewer is at the whim of whatever convenient plot element that the writers came up with. The would-be titanic struggle is reduced to a bumbling, punchless slog. Without going into drudging detail, the immediate, nuts-and-bolts elements of the universe that the writers create isn't validated or upheld by much of the moment-to-moment occurrences that are presented. Twists can be presented without sense or care of explanation, which further degrades the cohesion of the fabric that holds the overall premise together.

The music, for the most part, is also terrible. At least it's sometimes funny. During scenes of would-be horrific slaughter or tense space battles, the producers placed upbeat, loungy music with bongo solos. What is the obsession this show has with bongos and electric piano as soundtracks for space war? Also, would it have killed the producers to have everyone who played an instrument on the show to learn more than one song? Instead the viewer has to agonize through yet another playthrough of a poorly disguised ripoff of ""Greensleeves"" every time someone pulls out a harp or an ocarina (this happens a LOT). The song is likely supposed to have been intended as thematic, as a sort of anthem to the emotions that those sections were to communicate, but in fact it rather smacks of half-baked preparation.

The basic plot and characters are on the other hand interesting. And although I do feel I wasted my time watching this show, and I still wish I could at least have the option to see the Harmony Gold series I remember fondly as a kid, I do recognize the original Harlock series, as most Japanese animated series, is immeasurably better than what the West has had to offer to a similar audience. But that doesn't make this show worth watching. Sadly.",1448409600,,3390,4.750424448217317

5794880,5,B00DELKA2U,"Of course, the effect is somewhat muted by Discotek's track record so far - but it doesn't change the fact that we are beginning to see titles released stateside that many of us never even dreamed of actually getting.

Captain Harlock! Fist of the North Star! Cutie Honey! Mazinger Z! Devilman! On official, legit, subtitled DVDs!

In addition to that, the DVDs are sourced from Toei's own remastering efforts which provide us with lovingly restored, film-sourced video with all the grain that comes with it. Granted, the audio is always a bit lopsided, but that has more to do with Japanese studios' failure to maintain their audio masters (it's a bit tinny), but it's still better than the less legitimate fan offerings we have been given so far, and this looks marvelous played on an upscaling blu-ray player.

I bought Captian Harlock, Space Pirate 2013 movie and it is in English, and I thought the TV series would be the same, but no, it's on Japanese, and I hate reading subtitles. I grew up in Argentina watching this TV series and it is great and for that I would give 5 starts, but I'm sorry I can't. I can't believe there is not a version in English, I can't find one anywhere online, and a version of Captain Harlock TV series dubbed to English would be nice to have. Some one needs to come up with it. Just saying....

8592574,4,B00DELKA2U,"Leiji Matsumoto created a number of iconic manga and anime characters, but Captain Harlock is arguably the most impressive; with the others it might take a minute or two of staring before the name comes to you, but with Captain Harlock EVERYONE who knows a thing about anime or manga will recognize him at first glance.

So who is Captain Harlock?  Well, at base he is a good deal Captain Nemo:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/20-000-Leagues-Under-the-Sea/dp/0870216783/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</a>.  Add to that the honorable parts about being a pirate and the cowboy performances of Clint Eastwood and John Wayne.  Finish up with a number of lone or hopelessly outnumbered samurai, both fictional and historical, and there you have him: noble, taciturn, rebellious, fighting for honor and friendship rather than planet or country.  In 2977 Harlock and crew have turned their backs on humanity, which has combined great scientific advances with corruption and decay, until the arrival of the murderous Mazone species bent on conquest changes everything.  Soon the heroic captain, crew, and ship are repeatedly risking everything against hopeless odds for a humanity not worth saving.  All in all it is a lot of fun!

Problems?  Yeah, quite a few.  First, the animation is almost forty years old, and, boy, it looks it.  Someone could make a Blu-ray version I suppose, but I wonder why they'd bother.  (I've seen the far older&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Astro-Boy/dp/B000E3LGDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Astro Boy</a>, and it looks better.)  Maybe it has something to do with Leiji Matsumoto's style, and on that matter, I'll leave it to you.  Does the sight of wooden steering wheels, pirate flags rippling in the ""winds"" of space, or a colossal wooden ship's sterncastle on a spaceship bring a tear to your eye or a face palm?  Judge ye accordingly.

Second, the series is uneven and perhaps too long.  42 half hour episodes is 21 hours of time, and at least parts of this seem a bit repeated.  Most every show of any length has a backstory or two of important characters, tracing their histories.  Ever seen ALL the main characters get a history episode or two?  You will here.  (I was waiting for the bird and the cat to get one, and by golly they got partials!)  However, one perverse result is that the true major characters arguably get less history than they truly deserve.  Part of this no doubt involves leaving some mysteries to be solved later about the central characters, but Leiji Matsumoto could have helped that by not twiddling with them and thus changing them, particularly Harlock's.  (Suffice it to say that this Harlock differs from all the later ones.)

Third, the longest substory, at least seven episodes, involves Queen Lafresia discovering Captain Harlock's weakness and exploiting it, thus making it long enough to be a a little repulsive, and the all too convenient results disguise what with less hype (and less luck) would be rather unpleasant.

Still, for Captain Harlock fans this is a must buy; for others this is a key point in anime history, as any knowledgeable viewers of (among others)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-Exile/dp/B003VOVW7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last Exile</a>&nbsp;can tell you.

Note: This series represents another triumph due to the efforts of Discotek Media who are also responsible for the release of the old TOEI classics&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horus-Prince-of-The-Sun-Little-Norse-Prince/dp/B00PEA6K0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horus, Prince of The Sun (Little Norse Prince)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wonderful-World-of-Puss-N-Boots/dp/B000F48DAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wonderful World of Puss 'N Boots</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Animal-Treasure-Island/dp/B000BLI5Q4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Animal Treasure Island</a>.

8592577,5,B00DELKA2U,"First of all, I only bought this because I love the 2013 movie, and I wanted to see what the original TV show was like. I absolutely didn't expect to become so enthralled by it! From the first episode, I found myself drawn in to themes superior to anything I'd ever seen in anime from this period. It started off slowly, with just a few intense moments in the beginning, then with each episode it built more and more into the plot until I was staying up past 3am just to watch one more episode! I was very sad when it ended, but it was a near-perfect wrap up. There are some things that you should take into account if you're not a fan of English subs and anime melodrama like I am. There also isn't very much fight action beyond the ship to ship battles that are, frankly, imaginative. However, this allows the emotional aspect to be expressed to an unexpected degree. Like I said before, if you appreciate character over action, this would be a wonderful show to add to your collection.",1455494400,5,988,4.375

Audio:
The Japanese Dolby Digital 2.0 audio tracks came through just fine with no problems here.

Video:
The series was originally broadcast on TV in 1978, and the video converted here for DVD release looks gorgeous except for a couple spots where theres some sort of interference from original tape source materials most likely. The video quality here is very nice and crisp. The dialogue subtitles are white with black detail for good reading as needed. For the intro and closing themes as well as the background vocals, there are blue subtitles with black trim.

In Summary:
Space Pirate Captain Harlock is the kind of show that doesnt get made anymore. In Harlock, you get a strong, focused adult protagonist who knows right from wrong and will sacrifice himself to preserve this if need be with he and his crew overcoming great odds in the process. Im very glad to see this series make it to the U.S. intact finally for future American anime fans to experience. Also, theres actual closure instead 13 episodes and a wait and see if we can catch up to the manga practice prevalent in todays anime.",1450828800,2,1256,5.147058823529412
