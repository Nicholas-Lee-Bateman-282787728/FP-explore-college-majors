4466581,5,B004U7DOV6,"This rendition of Hamlet is one of the complete series of Shakespearean plays produced by the BBC for British television in the late 70s, early 80s. Knowing this fact it is understood the sparse but essential production values invested in these telecasts. Some of Shakespeare's play were produced in full, some in abridged versions. This version of Hamlet was a complete version. The notable cast members were Derek Jacobi as Hamlet, Clare Bloom as Hamlet's mother, and Patrick Stewart as Polonius.

Jacobi starred in this production following his masterful role in ""I Claudius."" Therefore, his role as the Danish prince suffers a bit from over-identification with Claudius. Considering how good he was in ""I Claudius"" the comparisons are inescapable. He pulls it off, however, and he plays the tortured soul of Hamlet convincingly without hamming it up too much. The ""To be or not to be"" soliloquy is especially noteworthy.

Patrick Stewart too starred in ""I Claudius."" It is interesting to note that the character he played in that mini-series, Sejanus, shares many characteristics with the character he plays here, named ironically enough, Claudius. However, he plays this character without any undue references to Sejanus. His acting is especially forceful, and his convincing portrayal of Claudius positively wreaks with authority and treachery. The rest of the supporting cast are competent without robbing the spotlight  --  for good reason, because the action is in these title roles.

All in all this is a decent production of Hamlet. For such a good play and such a fine production as this one, why settle for a shortened version?",1357776000,6,1640,5.173584905660378
8441230,5,B004U7DOV6,"My absolute favorite version of Hamlet.  Derek Jacoby's performance was more human and believable than most, and his interpretation made sense of some elements of the play that had always puzzled me. I highly recommend it!",1518652800,,222,5.166666666666667
8441231,1,B004U7DOV6,"The picture is horrible (electronic ghosting, remember 50s antenna TV reception), very poor sound quality, bad lighting and amateurish sets. Pass this one up!",1478649600,,158,5.625
8441232,4,B004U7DOV6,"This has a lot of good moments, but also lost a lot from my memory of it, seen on PBS some 30 years earlier.  I remembered Jacobi as brilliant, alive, real, the play making sense in a way it never had to me before.  Now it seems a little over-theatrical and overwrought for a filmed version.  Jacobi has wonderful moments, but there are times where his voice smooths out and I feel like Im listening to a poetry reading, not a person.  And there is fake crying, forced emotions and tearing passions to tatters sprinkled throughout the cast.  Perhaps Patrick Stewart holds up best as Claudius; macho, prideful but just a touch paranoid.  He rarely pushes, and seems the most 'human' being in the production.  Robert Swann makes Horatio a grounded, sad figure, carrying the secrets and the sadness of his lord and friend with quiet dignity and sadness.  When Jacobi is on, he is terrific, funny, and going right to the scary edge.  When he is reciting, things can be slow going.  He also feels old, the wrinkles around his eyes making him seem more his mother's brother than son.  Jacobi was 42 when the film was made, not much older than many others whove played the part on film (although the madness, passion and hope of youth is such a key element that I long for a Hamlet played by someone under 30.).  Olivier was 41, Richard Burton 39.  At least Branagh was a slightly younger 36 and Mel Gibson (whos Hamlet I feel is underrated) a comparatively boyish 34,, allowing at least a little of the Oedipal themes to not seem grafted on.  Ethan Hawke was 30 when he played the lead in Michael Almerydas re-imagined modern version, which I liked quite a bit, but which drives purists up the wall. This is a solid telling, worthwhile for being largely complete and uncut, and, if only occasionally brilliant, rarely less than good either.",1452384000,3,1834,4.585889570552148

8441235,5,B004U7DOV6,"Ambrose video 1984. Part of ""The Complete Works of William Shakespeare"" Produced by the BBC & Time-life Films. Produced by Shaun Sutton. Directed by Jack Gold.

There are many versions of this production and several beautifully illustrated and annotated books. Everyone has their favorite. Yet the only way to be a true favorite is to watch other versions.

This just happens to be one of my favorites as the actors do not outshine the characters. This is close to a minimalist stage production. This is close enough to the writing that it makes for a good classroom presentation.

It is best to know the story before watching the presentation. It starts out with three witches that tell a Scottish general Macbeth that he will become king. Macbeth's wife eggs him on as suggesting that he dispatch the existing ruler and cousin Duncan to move the process forward. Little did Macbeth and Lady Macbeth (or we for that matter) suspect at the time that they would encounter more blood and supernatural forces to correct the situation.

You may find this a tad more layered than you think as we must decide if the hero Macbeth is really the bad person as suggested by Malcolm and Angus.

Do not over look the politics of the time as they are sometimes overlooked in other presentations.

We also get some or our best quotes as in Act IV, Scene 1"" Double, double toil and trouble, fire burn, and cauldron bubble""

8441236,5,B004U7DOV6,"Wow! Was Derek Jacobi ever this young? (Looks like Cadfael's grandson.) Stewart great as the usurping king, stepfather.
Derek J is so vibrant and inspiring in the part of Hamlet, cannot help but be moved by ""Shake-a-speare""'s words.
I only wish that it could have been made into an interpolated HD DVD since this is pretty fuzzy picture, but it is from an original VHS recording unretouched.",1395100800,,391,4.850746268656716

8441238,5,B004U7DOV6,"The whole cast ensemble is great in this play.  Jacobi is a believable, (and physical) Hamlet, and he makes Hamlet the psychological puzzle that Shakespeare wrote about.

8441239,4,B004U7DOV6,"This isn't as good as BBC's ""Hamlet"", but fair is foul and foul is fair.  It seemed they needed more special effects for ex. why couldn't they show Banquo's ghost at the table instead of just an empty chair?",1368748800,,207,4.3076923076923075
