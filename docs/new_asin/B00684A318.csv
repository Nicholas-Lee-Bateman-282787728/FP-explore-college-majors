8494596,3,B00684A318,"In this dvd, the therapist is at a workshop and a lady volunteers to use EMDR on her social anxiety.  Essentially, the lady is asked to instill a nurturer, a mother figure, a protector, a calm place, etc.  After these are installed, she asked the lady to give an example when she felt ostracized or a social outcast.  The lady said at the workshop and then at work.  The therapist then asked the lady to think about her home life and the volunteer said she saw herself chasing after a car with her family in it.  The volunteer then started talking about angels and so forth.  At the end, the lady said she would try to be more social at work.

In my opinion, the therapist didn't do anything but just sit there and ask the lady questions.  The lady seems to have been resolving her own issues without assistance from the therapist.  The DVD doesn't give you an update so you don't even know if the lady achieved the results she sought with EMDR.",1430870400,4,945,4.354285714285714
