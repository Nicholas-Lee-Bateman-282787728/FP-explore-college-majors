8517058,5,B007I1Q512,The director/writer/star of the movie (Matt D'Elia) knows what he's doing. It was like nothing I've ever seen before and I appreciate that he appreciates filmmaking so much. You can tell. Perfect if you like dark humor and artsy films. Amazing.,1424131200,,244,4.975609756097561

8517061,5,B007I1Q512,"In a world of Transformers and 3-D blockbusters, American Animal stands out as a strikingly unique beast of its own.  When you see Transformers the experience (usually in the form of gigantic explosions) begins in the theatre and ends as soon as you leave.  Once you leave that movie you don't remember a damn thing; nothing sticks.  When you leave American Animal you can bet that something will stick, stab, wrench, and probably salt the wound.  It's impossible to not leave the movie without some impression, and whether it's a good or bad one, it still makes you think and forces itself to be memorable.

  D'elia has created a very unique vision and he channels that vision with a relentless and driven ferocity that is admirable on its own.  D'elia's world is familiar but never predictable, and after a shaky start the movie forges on with double the intensity.  He creates a very tangible tension and his unpredictability is what makes him so dynamic, he's impossible to love but impossible to hate.  He gives himself 100% to the movie and there's nothing timid or unsure in his performance and no question of his devotion to his vision.

  The movie was at times challenging, disturbing, hilarious, and sad; but it was never boring or contrived.  It was like riding a crazy horse towards a burning stable, and I enjoyed the ride.",1337040000,5,1338,4.760869565217392
8517062,5,B007I1Q512,"When I first walked into the film, I wanted to have an open mind about what I would be watching, and I can honestly say I'm glad I did. American Animal was really interesting as it combined the feeling of an art-house film, with the song ""Lazy Sunday"". I thought it had some genuinely funny moments, while raising a couple social issues that are pretty present in my life. I had a fun time watching it and made me happy to see an Indie director put his work on the screen.",1337040000,,472,4.197802197802198
8517063,4,B007I1Q512,"AA was definitely an experience... One of the most unique art films I've seen. At times it reminded a lot of American Psycho and Requiem for a Dream. Some parts seemed a little over the top and melodramatic but overall I thought it was a very interesting and well done film. It was also interesting to make the connections with the various movie nods within the film itself (for example: Gangs of New York). Whenever I consider writing a screenplay I always want it to center around a main character whose mental health is questionable but he can't be called outright crazy, I think that the writer/director/star Matt D'elia did a superb job of it in the film and it made for a very entertaining and layered story that seemed somewhat one dimensional at first.",1334793600,,760,4.637037037037037
