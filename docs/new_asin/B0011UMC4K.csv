3068215,5,B0011UMC4K,"While looking on a web site that sells old TV series, I came across The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.  Since I loved the movie I thought if the price were right I would purchase it.  It excelled the movie by far.  Great romance and imaginative witty comedy.  I fell in love and watch the entire series over and over.  The Captain was a ghost from the late 19th century, who haunts his Maine oceanside home.  His nephew, a money grubbing single man fears his ghostly uncle, but decides to rent the cottage, once again.  The handsome Captain scared away all previous tenants...until the lovely widow, whose financial state prevents her from leaving.  Captain Gregg decides to allow her to stay on a TRIAL basis, but a rift between them sends her packing...momentarily.  She returns and after falling asleep the first night, he appears in her bedroom, admitting unbeknownst to her, that he had been searching for her all of his life...how was he to know that she hadn't been born yet.  He further states, that he would have taken her with him on his ship and shown her the world had either he been born in her time or she his.  It is the beginning of one fun filled adventure after another.  I would buy it again if it comes out on DVD, especially if there were special features.",1203206400,13,1267,4.4847161572052405
3068216,5,B0011UMC4K,"As a life-long fan of theatre, film and tv, I feel that it is about time that those who control this product release it to the many millions of fans of quality comedy and superlative acting.  The rapport and respect between Hope Lange and Edward Mulhare as actors and characters jumps out at you as a unique and special opportunity to view performers who are in total command. To see an intelligent, humorous, caring and touching interaction between all of the characters on the show should be reason enough to release the remastered dvds.  The fact that is will be overwhelmingly profitable for those involves in the product should be secondary.",1203206400,21,646,4.8108108108108105
3068217,5,B0011UMC4K,"If The Ghost and Mrs. Muir is really coming to DVD, I'll be thrilled!
This is a great show....Edward Mulhare is a super hottie as Captain Gregg and Hope Lange is gorgeous as Mrs. Muir. A terrific romantic comedy sitcom.....well written, well acted and a fun show! Did I mention Hope Lange won the Emmy for it?  Definately an influence on later sitcoms with a romantic angle.  Also, some of Gene Reynolds', from MASH fame, early work!",1203206400,21,433,4.6103896103896105
3068218,5,B0011UMC4K,"I first started watching this show in 1968 when I was 12 years old and it is STILL my favorite show of all time. The Ghost and Mrs. Muir is such a wonderful show with great acting (all the stars were nominated for Emmys and Hope Lange won twice as best actress), wonderful comedy (Charles Nelson Reilly was--and is still, I think--the funniest man on the planet), and heartstopping romance (I've read that this was the first real romantic comedy ever done for TV). I plan to buy this show for myself and all my friends. PLEASE bring this out on DVD!",1203206400,23,549,4.392156862745098
3068219,5,B0011UMC4K,"I first saw this show at age eleven and fell in love with it, and the Captain! Candy and Jonathan Muir were kids I wanted to be friends with, everyone needed a housekeeper like Martha, (played perfectly by Reta Shaw) and Charles Nelson Reilly was in top form. Now, 39 years later, I still love this show and can appreciate it as an adult. Mulhare and Lange had great chemistry and it showed, without using double entendre's and/or smarmy jokes and suggestive language so prevalent on more recently released sitcoms. The show also boasted guest appearances from well-known actors and future award-winners such as Richard Dreyfuss, William Daniels, Eileen Brennan, Bill Bixby, Shelly Fabares, Jack Gilford, Jonathan Harris, Shirley Booth, Harry Nilsson, Mark Lester, and Kenneth Mars. Even after being canceled by NBC and picked up for another year by ABC, Miss Lange snagged back-to-back Emmys for the two years of the show's run, and Edward Mulhare and Charles Nelson Reilly were also nominated.

This show also has the most memorable speech to ever hit a comedy series of the sixties, and it came in the pilot episode:  I can never forget it -- it comes at the very end of the show when Captain Gregg whispers to a sleeping Carolyn:

""I never once allowed a woman on board my ship, but if I had known you a hundred years ago, I would have carried you off to sea and shown you how beautiful the world can be. I've met my match in you. Lord knows I waited for you, and hunted for you. How was I to know you hadn't even been born yet? No... you won't remember any of this when you wake up, Madam. You shan't have that advantage over me. How sad, that you were not born in my time, nor I in yours.""

Triple sigh!

This series is well-worth seeing in its own right without comparing it to book or movie and as other reviewers have noted, I will be first in line to buy it; released on REAL DVD, not video downloads!

EVERYONE needs to see this show!",1203120000,46,1945,4.480225988700565

3068223,5,B0011UMC4K,"I, too, watched the show growing up. Like all who have posted here, I loved the chemistry between Mrs. Muir and her ghost. Reta Shaw's quick quips kept me chuckling and Charles Nelson Reilly had me rolling on the floor laughing decades before the expression existed! And I just adored Gull Cottage. Yes, I would buy the DVDs as soon as they could be issued.
Maybe the holdup is due to having two networks involved? If that prevents a single box-set from being issued, I'm sure we'd purchase TG&MM piecemeal as fans did with Here Come The Brides...and I'm equally sure the networks/studios could find a workaround if there's money to be made... It worked for Buffy. ;-) Nothing but bootlegs? Blast!",1377993600,3,697,4.721311475409836
3068224,5,B0011UMC4K,"This was one of my very favorite shows in my younger days. I do have the original Rex Harrison/Gene Tierney movie on DVD but I would love to have the tv series as well. To this day I still think Edward Mulhare was one of the sexiest men ever to grace the small screen; I used to watch 'Knight Rider' not for David Hasselhoff or Kit the Talking Car, but for ""Devon Miles""!

I was thrilled to unexpectedly see him in a number of episodes of the British 1950s 'Adventures of Robin Hood' tv series (also highly recommended for wit and charm!)

Please please PLEASE bring this wonderful vintage series to DVD!",1374969600,3,604,4.383928571428571
3068225,5,B0011UMC4K,"I'm not a huge fan of tv shows- but this show is not to be missed.  It was based on a movie and a book, so this gem of an old sitcom started out with much more depth and thought than usual.  The stars, Edward Mulhare and Hope Lange, provided unforgettable performances as a couple who grow to care for each other despite different planes of existance.  The characters are both strong minded- she a modern widow, he the ghost of a sea captain.  The difference in eras provides clashes in expectations.  The series was romantic, clever, and well written.  Rather than seeming like a gimmick, the sea captain/ nautical angle adds charm and style.  If it were professionally released, I'd buy it in a heartbeat despite not owning much in the way of tv shows.",1373760000,4,754,4.5
3068226,5,B0011UMC4K,"How can we deprive future generations of the opportunity to enjoy this touching, funny, witty, charming, warm, poignant love story? Why can't the moguls at 20th Century Fox realize that this situation comedy is beloved by many and should be released on DVD?

""The Ghost & Mrs. Muir"" is an American sitcom based on the 1947 film of the same name, which was based on the 1945 novel by R. A. Dick. It premiered in September 1968 on NBC and then continued on ABC until 1970.

The characters are captivating and interesting. Martha, the housekeeper played by Reta Shaw, is a hoot!  Her delivery is top-notch, and she provides one of the many comic elements in this series. The main cast: Hope Lange, Edward Mulhare, Charles Nelson Reilly, Reta Shaw, Harlen Carraher, Kellie Flanagan, and Scruffy the dog, work well together and make the fantasy of Gull Cottage a reality for those of us who watched the series in our youth.

Aside from the comedy, ""The Ghost & Mrs. Muir"" had many touching moments, especially between Captain Gregg and Carolyn Muir.  In fact, in the pilot episode, at the end of the day, Captain Gregg whispers to a sleeping Carolyn:

""I never once allowed a woman on board my ship, but if I had known you a hundred years ago, I would have carried you off to sea and shown you how beautiful the world can be. I've met my match in you. Lord knows I waited for you, and hunted for you. How was I to know you hadn't even been born yet? No... you won't remember any of this when you wake up, Madam. You shan't have that advantage over me. How sad, that you were not born in my time, nor I in yours.""

Let's get this wonderful series on DVD, so we can share something beautiful, humorous, and chaste with our children, instead of sharing films and series that glorify the most base of human qualities.  We need more shows like ""The Ghost & Mrs. Muir"" and less shows like ""Honey Boo-Boo.""",1373414400,7,1894,4.453757225433526

Can we count on anyone resurrecting this treasure? or will our hopes die in vain? I hope not and this will be released on dvd and make our tv viewing life better. What is on tv now isn't worth my time to watch but these old shows are and we are willing to pay for them so what is the hold up.

The entire cast was great, and the love angle made it work. It was just for fun, and not meant to be an exact remake of the original film.  Why was the show cancelled, I wonder?",1355270400,7,461,4.1

One episode was about trying to get rid of nosy ghosthunters...when they see the chandelier swinging, they notice there's a string attached to it...when they trace it, you find the housekeeper is pulling it...when they ask her what she's doing she says, ""pulling a string"".  Hilarious.  Another funny episode is titled ""Way Off Broadway"", they're all trying to put on a serious play but between the kooky characters and on-stage blunders, it comes across as a comedy...and it is FUNNY!

The best episode is called (i think) ""The Medicine Ball"", at the end Hope Lange is dreaming of being at a party with the captain in his time.  Amazing nostalgia.",1250985600,5,1097,4.642487046632124

I too, along with my sister and brothers, spent many an afternoon with our chins resting on our upturned palms, watching with eagerness the next episode in this charming slice of warm and witty family entertainment which also treated us to early glimpses of the rising stars of the 60's & 70's. I loved Gull cottage and wanted to live there when I was little(In my vivid imagination that is!)The characters were all so loveable....The dashing  Captain, the formidable Mrs Muir and her adorable children Candy and Jonathan and their pet dog Scruffy, Martha the housekeeper,Claymore and his scheming ways and of course the loveable locals of Schooner Bay.

The series had good old Reta Shaw as the housekeeper whom I enjoyed in Pollyanna as a cook. She sure fits the role as a domestic engineer.

I've seen the film with Gene Tierney and Rex Harrison and frankly prefer the television series.

3068278,5,B0011UMC4K,"I, like so many of the reviewers, saw this series when it was aired in the late 1960s.  I was already a romantic, but this series completely caught my heart.  As far as I know, it was the only TV series based on the 'hopelessly in love across time' idea - though the book and movie 'Somewhere in Time' used the same premise, and of course the series was based on the R.A. Dick book and the Gene Tierney/Rex Harrison movie.  At the time I hadn't seen the movie, but the story of the dashing Captain Gregg and the woman he loved and found too late rang in my heart for years, to the extent that the 'forbidden love' aspect featured in my first published book, Song in the Silence.  I will purchase the whole collection as soon as it is available, but please, put it out in universal format, as I live in the UK!

3068280,5,B0011UMC4K,"I remember coming home after school back in the 70's to watch this show on TV and I can still hear the music now. Such a simple carefree existence that seems so lost at times nowadays. Unfortunately, the last time it was on (pay) TV in Australia was some 7-8 years ago. A generation can come and go and not have the opportunity to appreciate the simple joys that this show can bring, as it has given me.

At the heart of the show was the wonderful chemistry that Hope Lange and Edward Mulhare brought to each character, it was pure joy. There were so many magic moments, most of which I felt came not from the written word, but from a look in their eyes, to a slow dance back in time. When you looked into their eyes, you felt as if you could feel the heartache of knowing that they could never be as one together, knowing that the distance of time would forever keep them apart.

While the show only lasted two seasons, it left it to your imagination as to what might have happened to the characters had the show went on. Perhaps it's better to leave you wanting more than to question whether the show lasted that one season too long.

Let's hope that the distributors come to their senses and release this wonderful series on DVD soon. I know all good things take time, but for us fans, the wait has been long enough, but I'm sure that in the end, it will be well worth the wait!!",1209772800,11,1382,4.2272727272727275

3068286,5,B0011UMC4K,"There's something about this show that captures the imagination in ways that no ordinary love story has ever done.  When you think you've had your fill of classic romances, this one is a cut above the rest.  The premise itself is so unique that after watching it, you will never think of the concept of ""hauntingly beautiful"" in the same way ever again.

  ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" television show was adapted from a movie and a novel of the same name, whose principal characters are a ghost of a former sea captain and a beautiful young widow. Though I highly encourage you to see the movie and read the book to experience the full scope of this story, the television series adds a dimension to the characters of Mrs. Carolyn Muir (the widow) and Captain Daniel Gregg (the ghost) by developing them over the span of two years.

  The synopsis of the television version of this story can be found in the show's pilot episode, which explores how the Captain and Mrs. Muir met. (It aired on NBC from 1968-1969, then on ABC from 1969-1970.)

  Recently widowed, Carolyn Muir moves her daughter Candace and son Jonathan along with her housekeeper Martha and little dog Scruffy from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Schooner Bay, Maine.  Wanting to continue her career as a writer, she rents Gull Cottage, a house along the sea coast, from real estate agent Claymore Gregg.  Upon visiting the house, she is told that it is haunted by Claymore's great uncle, a sea captain who died a century earlier, supposedly from suicide.

  Not easily swayed by ""ghost stories,"" Carolyn decides to move in, but she soon comes face-to-face with the spirit on her first night after Captain Gregg makes several attemps to scare her family out of his home. In anger, he not only tells her that his death was an accident, but that he intended Gull Cottage to be a home for retired seamen and that he resents having her family living in his house.  In a verbal clash, she tells him that they have no intention of leaving, and what ensues becomes a battle of the wills ... or is it?

  What needs to be emphasized is the underlying romantic tension that builds from the moment Mrs. Muir sets eyes upon Captain Gregg's portrait in the parlor of the house.  When they finally do meet, in stormy darkness and candlelight, their feelings are explosive and the attraction is undeniable.  How they agree to co-exist in the house is worth the watch.  It is the catalyst for their relationship over the next two years.  A strikingly poignant scene illustrates this when he comes to her as she sleeps and confesses his feelings about her,lamenting that he died a hundred years ago, wishing that they could have shared a life together. All the while, she is never aware he is there as he lovingly watches over her.  One could see why the angst in this story is what gives it its beauty.

  This ensemble cast and it's ability to mix drama with light comedy has made it one outstanding show.  It is worth the watch and should be considered a television classic of enduring value.

Having seen the original film with Rex Harrison/Gene Tierney (which I also own), I was interested in seeing how they would handle a series based on this story.  The pilot stuck very close to the parts of the film where Mrs. Muir first comes to Gull Cottage.  All in all, I thought this was a wonderful, romantic series with great interplay between the lead characters.

Hope Lange and Edward Mulhare had the starring roles in this romantic comedy, their chemistry so hot the screen sizzled!  (Edward Mulhare  sadly missed the Sexiest Man of the Year award, by being born in the wrong part of the 20th Century, otherwise, it would have been Brad Pitt who??)

Candy and Jonathan Muir were kids I wanted to be friends with, everyone needed a housekeeper like Martha, (played perfectly by Reta Shaw) and Charles Nelson Reilly was in top form. Now, 39 years later, I still love this show and can appreciate it as an adult. Mulhare and Lange had great chemistry and it showed, without using double entendre's and/or smarmy jokes and suggestive language so prevalent on more recently released sitcoms. The show also boasted guest appearances from well-known actors and future award-winners such as Richard Dreyfuss, William Daniels, Eileen Brennan, Bill Bixby, Shelly Fabares, Jack Gilford, Jonathan Harris, Shirley Booth, Harry Nilsson, Mark Lester, and Kenneth Mars. Even after being canceled by NBC and picked up for another year by ABC, Miss Lange snagged back-to-back Emmys for the two years of the show's run, and Edward Mulhare and Charles Nelson Reilly were also nominated.

This show also has the most memorable speech to ever hit a comedy series of the sixties, and it came in the pilot episode:  I can never forget it -- it comes at the very end of the show when Captain Gregg whispers to a sleeping Carolyn:

""I never once allowed a woman on board my ship, but if I had known you a hundred years ago, I would have carried you off to sea and shown you how beautiful the world can be. I've met my match in you. Lord knows I waited for you, and hunted for you. How was I to know you hadn't even been born yet? No... you won't remember any of this when you wake up, Madam. You shan't have that advantage over me. How sad, that you were not born in my time, nor I in yours.""

The stars, Edward Mulhare and Hope Lange, provided unforgettable performances as a couple who grow to care for each other despite different planes of existance.  The characters are both strong minded- she a modern widow, he the ghost of a sea captain.  The difference in eras provides clashes in expectations.  The series was romantic, clever, and well written.  Rather than seeming like a gimmick, the sea captain/ nautical angle adds charm and style.  If it were professionally released, I'd buy it in a heartbeat despite not owning much in the way of tv shows.",1373760000,4,754,4.5
3302723,5,B0011UMC4K,"How can we deprive future generations of the opportunity to enjoy this touching, funny, witty, charming, warm, poignant love story? Why can't the moguls at 20th Century Fox realize that this situation comedy is beloved by many and should be released on DVD?

""The Ghost & Mrs. Muir"" is an American sitcom based on the 1947 film of the same name, which was based on the 1945 novel by R. A. Dick. It premiered in September 1968 on NBC and then continued on ABC until 1970.

The characters are captivating and interesting. Martha, the housekeeper played by Reta Shaw, is a hoot!  Her delivery is top-notch, and she provides one of the many comic elements in this series. The main cast: Hope Lange, Edward Mulhare, Charles Nelson Reilly, Reta Shaw, Harlen Carraher, Kellie Flanagan, and Scruffy the dog, work well together and make the fantasy of Gull Cottage a reality for those of us who watched the series in our youth.

Aside from the comedy, ""The Ghost & Mrs. Muir"" had many touching moments, especially between Captain Gregg and Carolyn Muir.  In fact, in the pilot episode, at the end of the day, Captain Gregg whispers to a sleeping Carolyn:

""I never once allowed a woman on board my ship, but if I had known you a hundred years ago, I would have carried you off to sea and shown you how beautiful the world can be. I've met my match in you. Lord knows I waited for you, and hunted for you. How was I to know you hadn't even been born yet? No... you won't remember any of this when you wake up, Madam. You shan't have that advantage over me. How sad, that you were not born in my time, nor I in yours.""

Let's get this wonderful series on DVD, so we can share something beautiful, humorous, and chaste with our children, instead of sharing films and series that glorify the most base of human qualities.  We need more shows like ""The Ghost & Mrs. Muir"" and less shows like ""Honey Boo-Boo.""",1373414400,7,1894,4.453757225433526

One episode was about trying to get rid of nosy ghosthunters...when they see the chandelier swinging, they notice there's a string attached to it...when they trace it, you find the housekeeper is pulling it...when they ask her what she's doing she says, ""pulling a string"".  Hilarious.  Another funny episode is titled ""Way Off Broadway"", they're all trying to put on a serious play but between the kooky characters and on-stage blunders, it comes across as a comedy...and it is FUNNY!

Tierney was too stiff, prim and proper, while Lange is charming and natural in the role of Carolyn Muir. I also prefer Edward Mulhare as the Captain. This is one of the rare cases when the television series was actually better than the movie that preceeded it.",1225584000,10,636,4.352941176470588

3302775,5,B0011UMC4K,"I, like so many of the reviewers, saw this series when it was aired in the late 1960s.  I was already a romantic, but this series completely caught my heart.  As far as I know, it was the only TV series based on the 'hopelessly in love across time' idea - though the book and movie 'Somewhere in Time' used the same premise, and of course the series was based on the R.A. Dick book and the Gene Tierney/Rex Harrison movie.  At the time I hadn't seen the movie, but the story of the dashing Captain Gregg and the woman he loved and found too late rang in my heart for years, to the extent that the 'forbidden love' aspect featured in my first published book, Song in the Silence.  I will purchase the whole collection as soon as it is available, but please, put it out in universal format, as I live in the UK!  Thanks, and I so look forward to it - Elizabeth Kerner",1215475200,10,865,4.155688622754491

I cast another vote at putting the series out on DVD.",1215216000,9,347,4.4375
3302777,5,B0011UMC4K,"I remember coming home after school back in the 70's to watch this show on TV and I can still hear the music now. Such a simple carefree existence that seems so lost at times nowadays. Unfortunately, the last time it was on (pay) TV in Australia was some 7-8 years ago. A generation can come and go and not have the opportunity to appreciate the simple joys that this show can bring, as it has given me.

At the heart of the show was the wonderful chemistry that Hope Lange and Edward Mulhare brought to each character, it was pure joy. There were so many magic moments, most of which I felt came not from the written word, but from a look in their eyes, to a slow dance back in time. When you looked into their eyes, you felt as if you could feel the heartache of knowing that they could never be as one together, knowing that the distance of time would forever keep them apart.

While the show only lasted two seasons, it left it to your imagination as to what might have happened to the characters had the show went on. Perhaps it's better to leave you wanting more than to question whether the show lasted that one season too long.

Let's hope that the distributors come to their senses and release this wonderful series on DVD soon. I know all good things take time, but for us fans, the wait has been long enough, but I'm sure that in the end, it will be well worth the wait!!",1209772800,11,1382,4.2272727272727275

3302783,5,B0011UMC4K,"There's something about this show that captures the imagination in ways that no ordinary love story has ever done.  When you think you've had your fill of classic romances, this one is a cut above the rest.  The premise itself is so unique that after watching it, you will never think of the concept of ""hauntingly beautiful"" in the same way ever again.

  ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" television show was adapted from a movie and a novel of the same name, whose principal characters are a ghost of a former sea captain and a beautiful young widow. Though I highly encourage you to see the movie and read the book to experience the full scope of this story, the television series adds a dimension to the characters of Mrs. Carolyn Muir (the widow) and Captain Daniel Gregg (the ghost) by developing them over the span of two years.

  The synopsis of the television version of this story can be found in the show's pilot episode, which explores how the Captain and Mrs. Muir met. (It aired on NBC from 1968-1969, then on ABC from 1969-1970.)

  Recently widowed, Carolyn Muir moves her daughter Candace and son Jonathan along with her housekeeper Martha and little dog Scruffy from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Schooner Bay, Maine.  Wanting to continue her career as a writer, she rents Gull Cottage, a house along the sea coast, from real estate agent Claymore Gregg.  Upon visiting the house, she is told that it is haunted by Claymore's great uncle, a sea captain who died a century earlier, supposedly from suicide.

  Not easily swayed by ""ghost stories,"" Carolyn decides to move in, but she soon comes face-to-face with the spirit on her first night after Captain Gregg makes several attemps to scare her family out of his home. In anger, he not only tells her that his death was an accident, but that he intended Gull Cottage to be a home for retired seamen and that he resents having her family living in his house.  In a verbal clash, she tells him that they have no intention of leaving, and what ensues becomes a battle of the wills ... or is it?

  What needs to be emphasized is the underlying romantic tension that builds from the moment Mrs. Muir sets eyes upon Captain Gregg's portrait in the parlor of the house.  When they finally do meet, in stormy darkness and candlelight, their feelings are explosive and the attraction is undeniable.  How they agree to co-exist in the house is worth the watch.  It is the catalyst for their relationship over the next two years.  A strikingly poignant scene illustrates this when he comes to her as she sleeps and confesses his feelings about her,lamenting that he died a hundred years ago, wishing that they could have shared a life together. All the while, she is never aware he is there as he lovingly watches over her.  One could see why the angst in this story is what gives it its beauty.

  This ensemble cast and it's ability to mix drama with light comedy has made it one outstanding show.  It is worth the watch and should be considered a television classic of enduring value.

Having seen the original film with Rex Harrison/Gene Tierney (which I also own), I was interested in seeing how they would handle a series based on this story.  The pilot stuck very close to the parts of the film where Mrs. Muir first comes to Gull Cottage.  All in all, I thought this was a wonderful, romantic series with great interplay between the lead characters. Since TV Land and Nick At Nite seem more concerned with running Fresh Prince marathons and adding movies to their schedule, I doubt we'll be seeing this or any of the other classic series returning to those channels anytime soon.

Even at that shakey picture, this series had a magic that utterly enchanted me with its warm humor and the impossible romance you longed to see realized. From the moment I laid eyes on Mulhare, like Mrs. Muir, I had to think Magnificent. Seeing him, as well as the rest of that wonderful cast on pristine DVDs would be heaven. And, Charles N Reilly's humor was the perfect, non silly comedy foil to the darling Captain.",1203292800,70,577,4.254545454545455

Hope Lange and Edward Mulhare had the starring roles in this romantic comedy, their chemistry so hot the screen sizzled!  (Edward Mulhare  sadly missed the Sexiest Man of the Year award, by being born in the wrong part of the 20th Century, otherwise, it would have been Brad Pitt who??)  The agony of this love story, always together but never being able to truly be together is just one aspect that makes this show a winner.
