5943346,5,B00ETAZEHQ,....... 200 motels.......200 motels......... a mantra for all rock groups that ever hit the road. Some may not understand the imagery which only means that they need to have a word with Rance Mohamid in the tiny little room viewing this DVD at least several more times!,1389571200,3,269,4.74468085106383
5943347,5,B00ETAZEHQ,"One of the best movies ever made.  Period.  It was shot on video, so has lots of special effects (psychedelic) than films for decades afterward.  The ""plot"" is somewhat subjective and some may think rambling, but is truly a psychological tour-de-force that challenges societal norms.  The background of solving the ""Orchestra Question"", the theme of ""Touring Can Make You Crazy"", the brilliant songs and score, the simple yet evocative sets, the juxtaposition of fame versus loneliness, the roles played by Theodore Bikel, Ringo Starr and many others, all add up to a video well worth viewing over and over again.  This, as you may have guessed, it the end of the review.",1384300800,6,671,4.955357142857143
5943348,4,B00ETAZEHQ,"""...if you have to ask, you'll never know.""  So...what, were you expecting something like ""Gone With The Mothers?"" or ""Citizen Zappa?"" or even ""Frank & Motorhead Do America?""  Frank Zappa, God rest his soul, never meant for his work to be ""discussed.""  He knew who his ""demographic crowd"" was, he played to and FOR them (Dig his version of ""I Am The Walrus""), and...well, thank God Dweezil is still out there playing his dad's music.  If you don't understand it, fine (that was really sort of the idea), but there's always a ""Sheila E"" or a Bon Jovi"" DVD 4 U...",1381276800,3,561,4.524752475247524
5943349,3,B00ETAZEHQ,"I've had '200 Motels' on VHS for years, and was always kind of wondering why it and 'Uncle Meat' have never been released on DVD. Well... I kind of see why, now.
  The only real 'advantage' of this DVD over the old VHS version is that the DVD is in wide-screen, while the VHS was obviously a pan-and-scan. Other than that, this DVD version has all the drawbacks of the VHS version. It is somewhat grainy, the colors look a bit washed out, and all the 'special effects' seem even more cheesy and dated than they did when I first viewed this film in the 1980s. Besides that, the film, as a film, is pretty much an amateurish hot mess.
  While there is no doubt in my mind that Frank Zappa was one of the most innovative composers and musicians of the 20th Century, as a film maker... well... not so much!
  Still - for any serious collector of Zappa material - this DVD is a must! If nothing else, at least for bragging rights.",1380585600,14,925,4.257142857142857
8609312,4,B00ETAZEHQ,"The widescreen edition of this film is not cropped for 1.85, it is stretched.  All the performers look squashed and fat (which a few were, but that's beside the point).  The advantage of this version compared to the proper ratio of the MGM DVD-R is the commentary track from Mr. Palmer.  Even though Palmer is mostly congratulating himself and trying to diminish Frank's role in the directing, there is enough here to make it an interesting listen.",1452988800,,448,4.792207792207792

8609315,5,B00ETAZEHQ,"as i mentioned in a comment above... the fact that it's widescreen isn't an advantage... it was shot in 1970 on 2"" videotape in PAL standard definition in england.  the VHS wasn't a pan-and-scan; it was the original aspect ratio.

in addition, tony palmer's commentary is pretty difficult to listen to... it's clear he had no appreciation for frank's aesthetics.",1415059200,3,362,5.016666666666667
8609316,5,B00ETAZEHQ,"Classic Zappa and truly creative, unusual and a little bizarre. Very enjoyable musical journey through the mind of musical genius Frank Zappa.",1414195200,2,142,5.5
8609317,2,B00ETAZEHQ,"One can't really give this many stars, but it is a curious and valuable bit of history, and certainly captures a moment in time. I saw this stoned at a drive-in theater as a teenager when it first came out. We all thought it brilliant at the time. How one's perspective changes . . .",1413590400,,283,4.163636363636364

8609319,4,B00ETAZEHQ,I have looked for this for years as a DVD.  I expected certain things as I saw tis at the midnight movies back then.  I am positive that some scenes are missing (Cowboy in the restaurant with the waitress ...)  It was a demeaning sequence but I can't believe it was cut for that reason.,1400976000,2,286,4.163636363636364
8609320,5,B00ETAZEHQ,"Hilarious. Very good music. Forgot that Theodore Bikel was in the movie, along with late friend Jimmy Carl Black. Brings back some memories.",1394582400,2,140,5.130434782608695
8609321,3,B00ETAZEHQ,"""200 Motels""  was okay, but confusing.  It was visually fast and distorted, as well as slightly humorous.  The 1968 film ""HEAD"", by the Monkees, was much more profound.",1390435200,,168,4.928571428571429
