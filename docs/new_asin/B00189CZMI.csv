3413240,5,B00189CZMI,"The Stulbergs did an admirable job in documenting life on ""The Mesa"". The Mesa is 15 square miles of harsh land that is home to veterans, teenage runaways, old hippies, and a variety of pets. The veterans within the community are mostly dysfunctional and a bit aggressive. Weed seems to keep them relaxed and is used as the main form of currency within this ragtag community. They are disillusioned with the U.S. government, no surprise there, but they keep to themselves and bother no one.

I have to say, I applaud these people for giving up life's amenities, to rough it on abandoned land which offers nothing by way of food and very little clean water. The land itself is a refuge for those who couldn't deal with the hustle and bustle of civilization. Despite finding their Shangri-la in an unforgiving desert, I would like to point out a few ""cons"" of Mesa living, as I see them:

1. Lack of hygiene and sanitation is a problem for these desert dwellers. Without a steady and fresh source of water, bathing is a luxury and eating food on dirty dishes is the norm. Some resort to bathing in the Rio Grande which is a five-mile hike. Also, the property around their homes is usually littered with trash of some sort, be it plastic bottles and papers or abandoned vehicles.

2. Housing in the Mesa is nothing more than shanty architecture. It's unattractive on the outside and does a bad job of keeping one warm. But, ""home is where the heart is"" as they say so it works for them.

3. Lack of security can be a problem, especially to those who are single parents. The community refuses outside help from the law but they will band together when necessary. On the other hand, it may not always be a reliable way to deter potential criminals. Only time will tell.

4. The nearest town is 25 miles away. What happens when there's a serious accident? Only a few individuals have running cars, and they don't live right around the corner from their nearest neighbor. So then what?

Living off the grid, smartly, would involve planning in terms of housing, farming, sanitation, and energy conservation. I didn't see any of this here. Of course, this is to be expected from people who just want ""out"" from a society they no longer feel a part of. It's the pack-your-bags-and-get-out-of-Dodge approach.

I'll end my review with this thought: This documentary is sobering for only one reason: We as a society may have to live like those on the Mesa after some future catastrophe. Will we be any more prepared to build a better community?",1321142400,,2531,4.6236080178173715
3413241,5,B00189CZMI,"Off the Grid is a great documentary about what it's really like to live on the land. There is a 15-square-mile tract in northern New Mexico known as The Mesa. Dropouts of all ages come from across the U.S. to live on The Mesa, where ""roughing it"" takes on a whole new meaning.

The Grid offers only a place to flop. (You have to build your own shelter). People have no electricity, no running water, and (almost) no rules. On the other hand, they can smoke dope, fire guns, and rant about the government all they like. Predictably, it is much easier to live without rules in theory than in practice; a few bad apples steal and the residents have to decide how to react. (They do NOT want to call the police).

The fascinating aspect of this film is the people who end up on The Mesa. The viewer wants to know why living with nothing is better than making a few sacrifices for an easier life. There are a few answers, although the reasons that people choose to live on The Mesa are varied. One particularly-memorable character is a young father who takes his small children out of school and brings them to The Mesa to live.

I enjoyed watching Off the Grid on my comfy sofa in my air-conditioned home. For something different, this film is great.",1266451200,5,1246,4.408695652173913
3413242,4,B00189CZMI,"OFF THE GRID: LIFE ON THE MESA is an engaging documentary.  It tells the story of a group of individuals who choose to live away from most of society in the Northern New Mexico desert. These people live in makeshift homes or vehicles with no electricity, little food and so little water that as one ""mama"" puts it they often eat off dirty dishes because they would rather have the water for drinking than washing.  Aging hippies, teenage runaways, and ex military men many with emotional challenges seem to make up a large portion of the population.  There are children being raised there as well though one single father's four kids are returned to their mother in Connecticut during the course of the film.  I appreciate that the filmmakers treat their subjects with dignity and let them tell the story with their own often articulate voices.  The main conflict in the movie occurs when a group of vegan teenage runaways begin stealing from other residents they feel are hoarding food.  We are told that this is resolved by a delegation of ""mamas""  visiting the teens but I would like to know more about how exactly this was resolved though the filmmakers were hampered by the teenagers' refusal to be filmed.  Still, this is a well made film with a fascinating subject",1248825600,5,1271,4.719457013574661
3413243,5,B00189CZMI,"The Mesa is a desolate area of 15 square miles in New Mexico where around 400 people are joined together in a loosely knit community that tries to live ""off the grid"" of modern conviences, paid work and legal restrictions.

As someone who came of age in the counter-culture of the late 1980's, some of the Mesa residents reminded me of the sort of middle age hippies I met at Rainbow Gatherings. However, the Mesa also includes a large number of military vets and others drawn to guns and aggresssive behavior. What brings these folks together is a committment to ""roughing it"" in order to live outsides the rules and requirements of mainstream society.

Whether you view these people as well intentioned freedom seekers or dangerous crackpots really depends on your perspective. Personally, I found Mesa to include a little bit of both.  For example, I really liked Stan, an older man who kept pigs and goats, apparently trying to live off the land the way his family had been doing for generations. He also seemed to be a very kind hearted fellow, willing to take in and mentor runaway teens who had nowhere else to go. There was also Mama Philips, a former psychiatric nurse dedicated to providing stability and emotional nurturing to her neighbors. On the other hand, Mesa did seem to have a large number of very troubled individuals. For instance, one of ex-military guys spoke of ""eye for a eye"" revenge killings as the best solution to community conflicts.

The subject matter is indeed interesting. But I give this doc 5 stars because of the high quality of film making. The cinematography was excellent, the scenes well edited and the whole package put together in a way that manintained my interest throughout. By the end, I really did care about these people and the community they live in.",1211673600,19,1801,4.762820512820513

8268908,5,B00189CZMI,"This is an extremely interesting documentary because it gives us a glimpse of a group of people who have deliberately chosen to take a different path. For various reasons, these folks have carved out an alternative community on the northern New Mexico prairie. Through interviews we learn that they consist of aging hippies left over from the '60's, younger army vets back from the endless Middle East wars, many of whom are burned out, suffering from PTSD, and disenchanted with the American government, and a seemingly endless hoard of drifting teenage runaways. You could hazard a guess that if some of these desert denizens were actually in a large city, they'd be homeless. But in the vast emptiness of the southwest mesa, they cobble together makeshift houses and a radically different way of life, with varying degrees of success and skill.

I had to resist an urge to make judgments, to feel sorry for these folks, to even look down upon them. At times they seemed pathetic, particularly the 17-yr. old runaway girl, cute in her freckles and reddish hair, but so vulnerable and naive. Her dazed expression and stoned manner of speaking harkened back to the same hippies and flower children of the ""Stoned Age"" of the '60's. Sure enough, she admits to extensive drug use, with plenty of dope and crack, takes up with a guy twice her age, and ends up pregnant. She tells us her mother was and is a heroin addict who actually injected drugs into her then she was a small child. Nice home life, eh? We see her sitting in a truck thumbing through Mothering magazines, trying to give the impression that she is optimistic about her future and the future of her child. We wonder if she is continuing to drink, smoke and use drugs during the pregnancy. But at the end of the film we learn that she gave birth to a normal and healthy baby. With a child there is always hope.

Virtually everyone in the film seems to smoke cigs, dope, and drink, and shooting guns and/or blowing things up is also a popular activity among the men. I realize that, just in writing that last sentence, I am not presenting a very positive picture of the community. I do believe that there are positives. For one thing, these folks should be congratulated for seeking out a radically different way to live in the 21st century. Not for one minute do I think that city or suburban dwellers--I am one of them--with all of our time and money and houses and cars and possessions, are more righteous or moral than the citizens depicted in this film. The mesa dwellers surely consume far less electricity....water.....power.....gasoline....and so on. They pollute less. They spend less time in frivolous pursuits, such as surfing the internet. Essentially they are living a much more raw and basic existence. They have to be ingenious and inventive and innovative in figuring out ways to feed themselves and their families. In the city, if we are hungry, we go to a restaurant or to a grocery store. How much effort or determination does that take?

In the film we see an elderly gent who raises a few pigs, sheep and goats. He is shown to be a very thoughtful, kind and caring person. He is the unofficial foster parent in the settlement, and is constantly taking in a seemingly endless stream of runaways and/or orphans. It is sad that there are so many of these throwaway children wandering so far from their homes. They leave for various reasons: my mom's a drug addict, my dad's an abuser, I couldn't stand all the rules, I hated my life, I got into drugs, etc.. Fewer and fewer kids have stable, loving homes, with caring adults as parent figures, to provide a solid base. The family unit as we once knew it, i.e., Ozzie and Harriet, Ward and June Cleaver--is almost non-existent.

This film presents an alternative 'family'. The group did not appear to be bound under a set of strange beliefs; nor were they held in sway under the stern leadership of some cultish religious figure like Jim Jones. They did have an elder or two, and the fellow who played the mandolin seemed to me like a pretty smart and nice guy. They have set up a loose structure or council which proves itself capable of making prudent policy decisions. Their guiding principle seems to be a desire to live with more freedom, to get out from under the restrictions of job and mortgage and TV. I do believe our possessions, and the jobs we perform to get the money to pay for those possessions, can become a form of economic servitude. That is not a problem with these folks. They are not worrying about their bank accounts and 401K's.

I've spent some time in Arizona and New Mexico. The winds and heat can be brutal. I imagine that the desert dust would get into every little nook and cranny of some of those patched-together dwellings. But that is just another part of life for our Mesa dwellers. They are tough and determined people. I would say that many of them embody the American spirit of independence, determination and ingenuity.

My wife looked on the internet and found listings in at least six states for communities of this type. I highly recommend this movie, and I sincerely wish nothing but the best for the mesa dwellers.",1423526400,,5186,4.649945474372955
