1970116,4,B00013WWSO,"Compared to the other offerings from Rain Forest (Trois & Trois II: Pandora's Box), this film was much better. I really enjoy
movies where you think you know what's up, but find out things aren't always as they seem. This movie really delivered on that account. Very impressive and enjoyable. Great cast of beautiful people.

1970177,5,B00013WWSO,"This gets 2 thumbs up. Very good melodrama / suspense & thrill filled. This one resembles the African American version of the famous movie Fatal Attraction. Vivica Fox & Shemar Moore's performance very well done. The acting , supporting cast ,film location & music makes this a very good movie for evenings / late night veiewing. No Crash-Bang-Boom nedded for this one. The dvd is much than the Televised version.",1360022400,,413,4.914285714285715

1970179,5,B00013WWSO,Shemar was SIZZLING in this movie. Yes it a B movie and not some blockbuster movie but it was really good. Shemar definitely did his thing in this.,1356825600,,147,4.285714285714286
1970180,5,B00013WWSO,"As a Shemar Moore fan, I rented this movie, not expecting much of a movie I had never heard of.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Fine acting and loved the plot including the surprise ending.",1352246400,,187,4.470588235294118
1970181,5,B00013WWSO,"MOTIVES is a beautiful movie played by beautiful people showing Blacks as human - successful, greedy, sexy, plotting, humanitarian, selfish, ambitious - all the faults and good qualities which make us human. Excellent acting, settings, music and an engaging, twist filled plot make this a winner. Whatever you do, do not stop this movie when you think this ends, there is a very important scene at the end of the movie after the credits start which explains why things happened as they did and adds a powerful punch to the movie. I wish I could give this 10 stars.",1322352000,,564,4.707070707070707
1970182,2,B00013WWSO,"Personally I really disliked this movie. It seemed like a A+ high school film project. Good, but  very amateur.

But you will like this movie for any of the following reasons
- The great cast
- The sex
- If you love black men or black women

The plot line seems to be thrown together to keep this from being a porno.

I wouldn't recommend this to any of my friends. But this might be the movie for you. You might enjoy it even if it doesn't have a well thought out plot line. The actors and actresses do a good job with the script given to them. It definitely has the potential of being a very enjoyable movie if you're into that sort of movie style.",1290124800,,650,4.094488188976378
1970183,5,B00013WWSO,This movie should have been as big as Two Can Play That Game!  Just buy it and you'll be happy you did!,1284163200,,103,3.6818181818181817
1970184,5,B00013WWSO,With a super sexy cast that draws you in this is one of those movies that you were glad that they made a 2nd movie for. You have to watch both.,1283212800,,143,3.6451612903225805
1970185,2,B00013WWSO,"I didn't think that the movie was going to be Oscar-worthy when I bought it, but it was even worse than my expectations. If a permanent pout and useless dialogue is your cup of tea, enjoy. As for me, I'll watch Criminal Minds for free.",1271635200,,235,4.2444444444444445
1970186,5,B00013WWSO,"MOTIVES is mysterious, suspenseful, exciting and very sexy. I like Motives it's about betrayal, trust, telling lies and praying that person keep secrets.",1261785600,,153,5.695652173913044
1970187,4,B00013WWSO,"Since the beginning Motives keeps you wondering, it's a sexy thriller with an ending that no one should tell you, actually you must see it for yourself. It's interesting, with good rhytm and it's not that long... and not that expensive :)

A perfect film to stay at home, with popcorn and cold outside :)",1259712000,,304,4.527272727272727
1970188,5,B00013WWSO,"I loved this movie. Sharmar Moore and Golden Brooks are great in this movie. Its a sexy suspense thriller about love, sex and betrayal, and murder. I like the fact that this is not a ghetto movie, a drive-by, or a gang thing...or a movie about the inner-city struggle. Its a movie about affluent blacks who are flawed. Its dark, its edgy, and its a thriller.  Its a very exciting and very intriguing movie to watch.",1253232000,2,415,4.4605263157894735

1970191,5,B00013WWSO,THE PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT  AND IT WAS RECIEVED IN A TIMELY MANNER. I HAVE TRUELY INJOYED IT AND RECOMMEND IT AS WELL AS THE SITE TO OTHERS.,1218672000,,138,4.111111111111111
1970192,4,B00013WWSO,"I've followed Rainforest Films for a while now. I have to say that I love all of their movies. Especially MOTIVES. It's gritty, sexy, and the plot is very good (even though I didn't figure what the heck happened until the end). I also like the fact that it shows affluent blacks with class and dignity. You don't see that alot in movies these days. In my humble opinion this has the whole package in terms of a great indie film.",1203379200,,428,4.296296296296297
1970193,4,B00013WWSO,"One thing which I enjoy about these films (black erotic thrillers) is that they really show that black films can be made about a lot more than just gansters and comedy.  This film has a moderately complex plot, good acting but is rather predictable.  It's not fair to compare a film like this to the other erotic thrillers from bigger production companies where they have more money and more experienced cast members.  The company Rainforest Productions based in Atlanta is moving in the right direction with films such as the Trois series and this one.

Vivica A Fox is always a pleasure to see on screen.  Both her and Shemar Moore are good actors when cast right, but they are no Hallie Berry and Denzel Washington.  At times their acting seems rather forced and over the top.  With experience they will get better I'm sure.  As far as the story is concerned, it was nice but in the introduction, most can tell that Shemar's so-called best friend is a rather shady character and so is he.  It's not hard to figure out who is trying to frame whom a little more than half way into the film.  But as I mentioned before, this is still an enjoyable film.  Even if you're able to figure everything in the film out well before the ending, it's interesting to see exactly how the events unfold.

If you're looking for something really challenging and very suspenseful, then perhaps a Law & Order episode would be better for that.",1200873600,,1424,4.562992125984252
1970194,5,B00013WWSO,"This was actually a good movie, considering it was a low budget one.  It was well directed and the plot was on point. Anyone who is a fan of the starring actors in this movie should really go out and buy it.  It is a true keeper!",1183334400,,229,3.851063829787234
1970195,5,B00013WWSO,"This movie kept me guessing from beginning to end!! I could not believe the outcome! If you like surprises, this is definitely the movie for you!",1181174400,,145,4.615384615384615
1970196,5,B00013WWSO,This movie starts out as the usual boring plot of the millionaire playboy cheating on his beautiful wife and using money in influence to get everything he wants. Then it turns into a mystery of who killed the woman who was using the playboy to get what she wanted.  Very nice acting and even the music score keeps you involved and wondering who done it. I never saw this picture in the theatre and assumed it was direct to DVD but after seeing it I'm happy of the choice to get this one. I'm not giving the ending here but it will keep you drawn in to the very end. I highly recommend that you got a little time to kill and nothing to do with the significant other then put this on and call it an evening. You will not be disapointed.,1168473600,,734,4.1328671328671325
1970197,5,B00013WWSO,"While lounging around the house this weekend, I watched motives after deciding to view a few flicks I have seen in a while.  I must say, I was once again impressed by this film (held to B movie standards, of course).  Even though I've seen this film before (more than once), it still managed to hold my attention from start to finish.

It is my understanding that there is to be a Motives 2 some time here in the near future (2007).  I look forward to viewing it, while hoping it won't be a disappointment.

I would reccomend Motives to others.............",1165881600,,556,4.465346534653466

1970199,5,B00013WWSO,"This was a great film. It left me with my jaw hanging open.

I believe there was a flaw though, WHY couldn't they have picked someone else to play Allanah? I mean, it doesn't make sense. What man in his right mind would cheat on a woman like Vivica with Golden Brooks? She looks like a baboon or a lion.

Oh well.",1154390400,4,313,4.032258064516129
1970200,3,B00013WWSO,"This is a thriller that is low on intelligent scripting but high on grit and edginess.  Good for males who want to sit down with the guys, have a couple of beers, and not be challenged.",1153872000,2,185,4.138888888888889
1970201,4,B00013WWSO,"I enjoyed the movie very much. It's suspenseful and has a few plots going. That keeps you guessing throughout the movie.

1970203,4,B00013WWSO,"I purchased this movie from Wal-Mart, just because of Shemar Moore. I had never heard of this movie prior to buying it and I really enjoyed it. Although some of the scenes were a bit tasteless, I was surprised by the ending. I can generally predict the who-dun-it plots, so I give this a thumbs up for its unpredictability.",1146528000,,323,4.491525423728813
1970204,3,B00013WWSO,"I was on a bit of a Shemar Moore kick, after seeing his very capable performance in Diary of a Mad Black Woman, and I decided to get this film to see more of his acting.  In this film Shemar Moore plays a pretty boy (in fact throughout the film he's often referred to as a ""pretty boy"") and scoundrel, who has an extramarital affair with dire consequences.  Shemar Moore is, as usual, impeccably gorgeous and I must say that his acting in this film was not THAT bad considering what he had to work with.  It is however, not a five star performance; but then again Moore is not a 5 star actor.  Some of his dialogue is somewhat corny, and I am not sure if this can be attributed to the screenwriting or him-I suspect the latter, because this seems to be a commonality in his performances. Of course, the immensely talented and beautiful Vivica Fox always does a great job; she and Moore have some chemistry, but Vivica outshines him and seemed to be a bit too much woman for him (Shemar Moore) who looked like a boy-toy in their scenes together. Joe Torry and Sean Blakemore give the best performances in the film (they are VERY good). Victoria Rowell is as usual beautiful, but is a bit over the top at times, and Mel Jackson tries his best with the dirth of material he's given. Overall, the film has plenty of beautiful people, and was decent; though not a great film, it was not a bad film either-though I could have done without the graphic sex scenes.",1146268800,7,1456,4.361623616236162
1970205,5,B00013WWSO,I enjoyed this movie very much. It put a different spin on the love interests and was very suspenseful with great acting.  I loved the surprise ending.,1140998400,2,151,4.592592592592593
1970206,4,B00013WWSO,"I don't know how many of you have seen this wonderful movie. I have seen it! Insightful independent film set amongst an ensemble cast of characters, starring Shemar Moore and lovely Vivica A. Fox. The dubious Emery Simms (Shemar Moore) embarks on a sinister course, secret rendezvous leading to blackmail and murder. His reputation seems to precede himself, a beautiful wife home and career. He tried to represent but to no avail hunted and captured by the game.",1140825600,,462,4.935897435897436
1970207,5,B00013WWSO,"I saw only a portion of this movie one morning on my way to work, and couldn't stop thinking of it all day.  Needless to say I couldn't find the movie because I didn't know the name until I asked someone about a movie with Shemar Moore, Vivica Fox, then at the time I didn't know the girls name from Girlfriends, the TV show, that's exactly how I said it to him, he automatically said ""Motives"".  I went to walmart that night and found it and purchased it.

I can say this with a smile on my face, I was surpised at the story line, and it kept my attention to the very end. Some things kind of gave you hints that everyone involved was doing something tricky, but I had no idea as to how it would end, I tell you this ""Simply Outstanding""",1124323200,7,738,4.075862068965518
1970208,4,B00013WWSO,"This movie is it, It has a steamy plot that will push you to the edge of your seat cursing at the screen.

I would recommend it to anyone.

Not to mention that the gorgeous Shemar Moore stars in it!!

Just a little bummer, why isn't the soundtrack available?",1124150400,4,258,4.224489795918367
1970209,5,B00013WWSO,I happened upon this movie one day on Starz in Black and fell in love. So much so that I ran out and bought it and have probably watched it a half a dozen times. The story and the acting were outstanding and OH! what a plot twist! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,1121817600,3,250,4.02
1970210,5,B00013WWSO,This movie was off the hook.  Ms. Fox need to win an award for this movie.  Everyone should see it.,1112054400,2,99,3.9
1970211,4,B00013WWSO,"I was truly surprised at what a good movie ""Motives""
turned out to be. To be honest, when I
rented this film, I expected to find yet
another tactless, corny tale of urban extremes.
But what a surprise!

I would recommend ""Motives"" to anyone. This is
an engaging movie that you actually don't mind
sitting through from start to finish. Of course
there is a bevy of beautiful people and heated
sensuality, but the acting is no disappointment
either.
Moore does great and Fox delivers another
convincing portrayal of a jilted woman
(but this time without going over the
top.....well, not so much).

I believe this is a movie that you
wouldn't mind seeing more than once.
Great suspense and attractive actors
certainly help.

This is a great movie for those searching
for a nice thriller to add to their
movie collection.",1107734400,29,817,4.73943661971831

1970214,5,B00013WWSO,I have found Hidden Treasures = black movies that goes straight to DVD. I ordered about ten of them. Some were corny but Motives was excellent. The director/writer/producer reminds me of the Cruel Intentions series but for black people. This movie is excellent and I recommend it.,1104969600,7,280,4.9787234042553195

MAN! THERE HAS GOT TO BE A SEQUEL TO THIS MOVIE. I AINT PLAYING. YOU JUST GOT TO!! PLEASSSSEEE. I GOT A GOOD PLOT FOR THE NEXT MOVIE. WHO I NEED TO TALK TO.

HA! HA!

BUT THIS MOVIE WAS EXTRAORDINARY. I ALWAYS PATRTONIZE BLACK MOVIES. I HOPE THIS WAS NOT A TRUE STORY CAUSE I WOULD HATE TO THINK THAT SOME GUY IS ROTTING AWAYS IN PRISON FOR A SET UP BY HIS BEST FRIEND.

There is a powerhouse cast in this movie: Shemar Moore, Vivica A. Fox, Golden Brooks (girlfriends), Joe Torry, Keisha Knight Pullam (Cosby show), and rapper Lil' Zane... This is the first black movie I have seen that I liked and had suspense, drama, and was a thriller... and was not a ghetto flick...

Its about betrayal, cheating, and payback... I like movies like this because people think they can getaway with anything... Movies like this show people that you could do whatever you want but you will get caught soon or later...

If you like suspense, drama, and Mrs. VIVICA... then you will love this movie....",1098144000,10,778,4.6231884057971016
1970217,4,B00013WWSO,"Motives is one of the most suspenseful movies I have seen to date. Even the ending keeps you guessing because you don't know if Vivica's character was a part of the plot to pay her gorgeous husband, played by the beautiful Shemar Mooore, back for his erotic infidelity. Not to mention the way his best friend set him up. It was brutal. But as they say, keep your enemies close and your ""friends"" closer. Some of the actors were lame and I agree that more should have been explored with the two detectives. However, despite some small shortcomings in characters and actors, Motives was a very good movie. I'd like to see Shemar in more a--kicking movies. Work those abs, baby!",1097193600,4,675,4.586776859504132
1970218,4,B00013WWSO,"This is definitely a keeper.  Even though Shemar Moore's performance is a bit wooden, he still plays well against Vivia Fox's superior performance.  The story and the  sex scenes are more than enough to justify getting this movie.",1096416000,2,230,5.0
1970219,5,B00013WWSO,I found the plot to be very intriguing...Shemar Moore and Vivca Fox was awesome in this movie. I wonder why it didn't go to the box office because it would have been a smash hit. My husband bought the movie home for movie night and I watched this movie...it was soooooo good. I would recommend it for everyone to watch.

1970220,3,B00013WWSO,"Ok, so maybe this was not a movie that will reach the Academy but with so few African American movies out there we should be thankful that someone is making a drama with a majority all black cast.  The plot could have been stronger and the acting was aiight.  But let me tell you, the sex scenes are enough to have you to rent it on a Saturday night - with a date of course.  check it out.",1092009600,,389,3.9615384615384617
1970221,2,B00013WWSO,"I cringed, I cringed, I cringed at the weak and disjointed storyline, the bad acting and the bad costume & make-up (for the women especially). Admittedly, my expectations were high due to recommendations, as well as the fact that Vivica Fox (2 Can Play That Game, Soul Food) Co-Produced the movie.

The story could have been so much better if it wasn't so patchy in key areas i.e. the drama in the ""opening scene"" - which unfortunately didn't follow through in the main story, and the fact that there was no real depth or background to any of the key characters.

There is a host of talent in this film, which again was unfortunately wasted. Sean Blakemore's ""love/Hate"" relationship with Shemar Moore - could have been explored in greater detail. The ""stars"" of the movie Vivica Fox and Golden Brooks came across unconvincingly and reminded me of ""Sunset Beach"" extra's (i.e. watch the scene when Golden Brooks breaks down in front of Shemar Moore). The worst acting came from ""Ren n Stimpy"" the detectives (Victoria Rowell and Mel Jackson) who were vital to the plot, but whose roles weren't taken seriously enough. However to end on a positive note, the best acting came from supporting cast member Joe Torry, who helped convince me that this was not a comedy. I would have liked to see more of Keisha Knight Pulliam (Cosby Show).",1091491200,12,1333,4.741379310344827

I was surpirised at the wide spectrum of cast members.  Shamar Moore (Y&R) Vivica Fox (Big screen) Golden Brooks (Girlfriends) Keisha Knight Pulliam (Cosby Show).  I was skeptical, but the plot was well put together and I liked the fact that the director didn't feel the need to ""get ghetto"".  Well-to-do people of color getting caught up is cool.

1970225,5,B00013WWSO,"After receiving numerous emails and calls from individuals asking me to watch this movie, I finally decided to do so.  MOTIVES was pretty darn good, and Shemar Moore's character did somewhat remind me of my character, Jaylin Rogers, in Two's Enough Three's A Crowd, as many said he would.  Shemar did a superb job keeping me entertained and I was blown away even more when I saw an old school mate of mine, Sean Blakemore, kicking it down in this movie as well.  The most amazing thing about the story was how unpredictable it was. Usually, a writer can tell where a story might be headed, but this one left me scratching my head thinking...how clever the ending was.  This movie is a must for your DVD collection and thanks to those who encouraged me to watch it.

This movie would have sold out if it were at the theatre.  Shemar Moore and Vivica A. Fox, played there roles perfectly.  The way the movie ended will be mind boggling.

Anyway i thought it was a great movie the actors were very convincing and the ending leaves you with building rage that stays with you until you pull out the dvd and put it back in it s case. all in all it was a good movie and finally a black thriller the only bad thing is that it wasn t released in theaters so it won't get the props it deserves.,1078617600,,583,3.8666666666666667

I hope that they do a sequel to this movie surrounding the same cast and some new faces too.. they are wrong for the cameo appereances they gave Kesha Knight Pullam and Zane.. I think there roles should have been a little more developed.. bottom line pick this movie up.. I hate that they don't have a soundtrack for this movie..
