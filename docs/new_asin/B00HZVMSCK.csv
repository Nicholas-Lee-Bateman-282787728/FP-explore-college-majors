8637652,5,B00HZVMSCK,"I am a bit the blind (American) man describing an elephant by its trunk, because I do not speak Japanese, nor did I spend time in Japan other than in Narita waiting to travel elsewhere. But I watched bits of Yuki Kashiwagis Third Solo Live performances on YouTubes and found them more than fascinating, so I ordered and received the DVD from the Amazon network.

Yuki is, or was, one of the most popular members of the Japanese pop idol troupe, AKB48. While the troupe performed, narratives ran on TV in which some idols played fictitious characters, while others represented themselves. Reality and fantasy blended to create an otherworldy resonance.

Four AKB members, called The Four Heavenly Queens, performed on stage a fifties-like song entitled Classmate, a song about loyalty, where Yuki, who was known as Black in the narratives, looked forlorn and depressed. Another member played a psychopath, who giggled during the performance, perhaps because she would avenge Blacks subsequent murder, seemingly foreshadowed in the performance, in a most bloody fashion.

Yuki was reborn as a bubbly entertainer under her own name and quickly rose to feverish idolatry, culminating in her being apotheosized into a kami (Shinto God). A prerequisite is for an idol to pledge celibacy and vow to give all of her love to her followers alone, which Yuki did publicly. To me the signature song on the DVDs is where Yuki levitates above the huge congregation, all waving an effigy of her, which is also a Jungian mandala, as are so many symbols in the concert dome, and sings about how she forsook her hometown, family, and friends to go on her quest. She could only see them now on the backs of her eyelids as ashes falling from her volcano. It gave me goosebumps (after I translated it).

I believe this 3rd Solo performance is Yuki's deification ceremony. And why I think it is so cool is because one can watch the arrival of an actual god on earth in real time, instead of having to read about such a thing occurring thousands of years ago.",1471305600,,2036,4.7920227920227925
