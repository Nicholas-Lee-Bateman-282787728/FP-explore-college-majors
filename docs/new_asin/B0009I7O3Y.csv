The notion of diversity means so much when you are confronted with these characters of different races, sexualities, desires, and interests who all seem to share similar insecurities and pain. More than anything this film humanizes young people. The producer of the film allowed every word and shot to come from these teenagers who are in so many ways so incredibly mature and intelligent and broken. Something about this being a pre-911, pre-cell phone, and largely pre-Internet look at teenagers' lives also gives the film a time-capsule quality as well. Amazing to watch. I don't think I am overstating it when I say that this film represents this country and the millennial generation to a greater degree than most other films of any budget I have ever seen, and I would do anything to learn where they are all now 15 years later.",1428105600,,882,4.809210526315789
8107925,2,B0009I7O3Y,"If I wanted to watch high school students being annoying I could probably just go to the Youtube. I think where this fails is that there are so many students profiled that it's hard to show anything in depth. Some of the students definitely have lives of struggle but you only get a surface view of how the feel, what they think, how they cope etc. It's a very shallow view of the students.",1349481600,,390,4.283783783783784
8107926,5,B0009I7O3Y,It was a very interesting documenatry. I was a kid during the late 90's so this was interesting to watch. It was cool to see that kids then were pretty much the same as when I was in high school. this movie is also somewhat depressing.,1348444800,2,235,4.130434782608695
8107927,4,B0009I7O3Y,"Just a slight word of warning, the girl I remember most vividly from the movie is cut from the DVD--Silva, the Armenian.  Really pissed me off cause I was trying to show her scenes to my wife who is Armenian and I thought I was going nuts until I realized she's not on the DVD.",1164758400,3,277,4.036363636363636
