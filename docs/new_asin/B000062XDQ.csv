Disc 3:  Elements of Robotechnology 7
This collection contains the second best installment in the ""Elements of Robotechnology"" series.  Here's a rundown:
1. Robotech Deleted Scenes:  As most know, Robotech was made by editing together three separate Japanese Anime series:  Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada.  TONS of edits had to be made to seamlessly edit them together.  Presented here is a HUGE collection of cut footage, totaling about an hours worth of view time. Overall, this is definitely a must-see.  The clips are presented in Japanese.
2. Merchandise Gallery:  Slideshow presentation format of various galleries of Robotech merchandise set to the Robotech theme (which you'll be sick of hearing afterward).  TONS of merchandising (clothes, toys, books, games, videos, etc) was done for Robotech.  Approximately 20 minutes worth of footage.
3. Robocon 10 Footage:  This was supposed to be interviews with talent at a Robotech convention done in 1996, but IT WASN'T ON MINE.  No link or whatever.  Searching through the chapters though I found two commercials for Robotech.  DO I HAVE AN UNINTENDED COLLECTOR'S ITEM HERE???
4. Video Game Clips:  Two clips for two Robotech based video games.  Clip 1 for an unreleased N64 game.  Not bad, kinda likes like Starfox and those Star Wars X-wing/Tie Fighter shoot-em up games.  Clip 2 for a soon to be released next-gen system game.  AWESOME graphics.  Looks like a keeper.
5. International Clips: Two scenes of Robotech in French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese.  Clip 1:  Rand peeping on the girls at Annie's party, Clip 2:  The Regess confronts the gang in the Hive.  Clip 3:  A Robotech Pepsi commercial in Spanish???
THE VERDICT:
Many feel that the New Generation story arc is the best out of all three of the Robotech story arcs, including the Macross Saga, and with good reason.  The ultra-cool mecha and the ULTRA-INTENSE action as the freedom fighters literally run and fight for their lives against the Invid and make their way through a post-apocalyptic and treacherous world is awesome!!
If you've never seen Robotech, simply put YOU MUST.  The action and the drama are compelling, clearly showing why Robotech became a pop culture icon.  It is the series that forever put Japanese anime on the map in the US.  If you did grow up with Robotech, give these a watch again.  They're great for a trip down memory lane. You can't lose!!!  Hopefully someday a sequel will finally be made to tie-up some of the loose ends.

1684450,5,B000062XDQ,"This box set contains the following: Robotech Vol. 13, Robotech Vol. 14 and Robotech Extra Disc 7. Since the first two discs can be bought seperately, my review will focus on the extra disc.
The first extra on the disc is one thing every Robotech fan has dreamed of. A bunch of select deleted scenes from Robotech. They are set up in the order of each volume. However, there are a couple cuts that they didn't show. Like the complete bath scene in Mospeda and the scene where Annie gets the front of her shirt ripped off. The Minmei shower sequence is in here, but it is edited for content. And there are even some short scenes that were cut out for time that really shouldn't have been cut. However, that doesn't mean that these deleted scenes aren't worth watching. There actually some really great scenes like uncut songs sung by Minmei and Lancer and a long scene where Lisa and Rick meet Miria's baby. And there are a couple of eechi jokes. Like when Bowie stumbles around a clothing store and accidentely picks up some panties.
The rest of the extras are pretty much standard. There is a video library of Robotech merchandise. Old Robotech fans will really get a kick out of this. The other extra is video previews of Robotech video games. The first one is a really low-quality N64 game that never made it, but the second is really cool looking Macross game that has graphics similar to Jet Set Radio Future. It's coming out for X-Box, so get ready all you X-Box gamers! This looks like one fun game.
Then are a couple of extras that are sort of hidden. The first one is on the main menu. Select the International Clips and press down. The New Generation symbol should be highlighted. Press enter and you'll get to see a Robotech TV preview. The other extra really isn't hidden. Go to the International Clips menu and select the Promo Clip. When you press enter, you'll see a Spanish commercial for Pepsi Robotech glasses.
And you've also got the excellent finale to the New Generation saga on this box. It's actually better than the Masters or Macross finale. So I strongly recommend buying this box set. GET IT NOW!",1017187200,,2123,4.545691906005222
1684451,5,B000062XDQ,"The Zentraedis has united to the forces of the Earth, the Meltrandi also, the Emperor Zentraedi and their dissident forces have been eliminated, the masters of the robotechnology have been defeated, now it has arrived the time of the United Earth of looking for other planets and systems to colonize.

The serie come with new ships and for the first time the warlike nature of the human race is exposed: this time we are not invaded, we are not the defenders, we don't protect anybody, we have arrived until the end of the well-known Universe, only to destroy what is not governed by our thoughts.",1014076800,2,2045,4.693593314763231
1684452,5,B000062XDQ,"Ah, finally, the last one arrives. it has been a joy and a pleasure to watch these series again, having previously seen them when i was young, and on old, terribly recorded video cassettes. i applaud ADV films for putting them out. it has made the dreams come true of this man who still dreams like a 12 year old boy.
what i find exceptional about Robotech are the characters, the plot, and the way the story stimulates your own imagination. the question, ""What if?"" keeps popping in your mind as you watch. I love the Robotech saga, and know that all who watch will enjoy them as well.",1013644800,9,586,4.385321100917431

7957755,2,B000062XDQ,"I paid top dollar for Generation 1 and 3 of Robotech when they first came out on DVD. I'm a big fan and was waiting for years hoping the DVD's would be released. Almost bought the VHS tapes, but held off for these DVD's.

Of course, since that time the series has been released at least 2 more times in different formats. There is one complete collection with all 3 generations in one set for $90 or so. That is the one that fans should buy.",1243209600,,441,4.127906976744186
7957756,4,B000062XDQ,"Robotech: The New Generation - Legacy Collection 7 is a three-disc DVD box set that was released in 2002 by ADV Films.  The first disc contains the episodes: ""Annie's Wedding,"" ""Separate Ways,"" ""Metamorphosis,"" ""The Midnight Sun,"" ""Ghost Town,"" and ""Frostbite.""  The second disc contains the episodes: ""Birthday Blues,"" ""Hired Gun,"" ""The Big Apple,"" ""Reflex Point,"" ""Dark Finale,"" and ""Symphony of Light.""

The third DVD in the set is labeled as ""Extra New Generation 2- Elements of Robotechnology VII.""  This DVD contains all the special features included in this box set.  The first extra is a collection of scenes from Macross, Southern Cross, and Mospeada that didn't make the final cut of Robotech.  Some the scenes include mild animated violence.  The scenes are split out by which DVD they appear on.  All of the included footage has the original Japanese language track.

The next feature is labeled as ""Merchandise Gallery.""  Here, you can see slideshows of catalogs advertising the various pieces of Robotech merchandise.  However, the slideshows are done in such a way that the viewer has no control over how to view them.  They slideshows also move at a rather rapid pace, so it can be hard to pause on something you want to take a closer look at.  This section also includes designs for the fashion doll line, an activity flyer, an ARCO Toys sellsheet, the press kit for the Robotech novels, and the RDF Fan Club packet.

Next is a feature labeled as ""Video Games.""  This includes video clips from Gametek's never released Robotech Crystal Dreams videogame, as well as prototype footage for the Robotech Battlecry videogame.

The ""International Clips"" has two clips included.  The first clip is the scene of Rand trying to spy on the girls when they're in the shower.  The second clip is the confrontation the band of freedom fighters has with the Regis at Reflex Point.  The clips are available in English, French, Spanish, Portugese, and Italian.  It's disappointing that the original Japanese versions aren't included.  This menu also includes a Spanish-language commercial, which appears to be promoting Pepsi and Robotech drinking glasses.

On the main menu, there is a hidden feature.  There is an RDF logo near the bottom of the menu, and if you click on it, you can watch the promo piece sent to television stations to convince the stations to air the show.  Personally, I thought this pitch reel was done in a rather cheesy manner, and am actually surprised that it helped to sell the series.

It should be noted that the back of the box for the third disc, as well as the inside card, claim there is footage from RoboCon 10 included.  However, according to the official Robotech website, this feature ended up not being included on the final product.

Overall, this is a decent DVD box set, even though I am a little disappointed that the RoboCon 10 footage ended up not being included on the extras disc.  However, I would still recommend this box set.",1236643200,,2976,4.88622754491018
7957757,4,B000062XDQ,"This boxed set is generally great, however, there are two major problems with it.
Firstly, if you're planning to get a first edition version, gold box version of ther Legacy Collection 7 (New Generation), be aware of two flaws:
(1) The other box for New Generation Legacy boxed set (#6) is green. The gold box for #7 is mistake, and ADV will be re-releasing a second pressing with a box in green that matches soon.
(2) Any references on the first printing to convention footage in the extras is incorrect. They couldn't get the rights. It's not included and the packaging and advertising is wrong. This will be corrected in the second printing (green box version)
Secondly, my extras disk had a weird problem with it under the Southern Cross deleted scenes. One deleted scene, a long shot of Nova Satori, was set at the end of track. My Sony DVD player hiccuped on it and wouldn't display it. I don't now if this is a problem with my DVD, my DVD player or the DVD pressing itself.
I suspect strongly that it's the DVD itself, possibly with a screwed up pressing, as my DVD player had no problem with the rest of the disk, and since it occured at 0:00 left on the track (as per my display). I think the Master disc may have been defective, especially given all other mistakes on the gold box release.
My advice - wait for the green box re-release. I hope ADV will have fixed all these bugs in that version.
(More info on these problems can be found on Robotech.com)",1021507200,9,1464,4.446096654275093
7957758,5,B000062XDQ,"So this is how it all ends(at least in the show).  I own all of the books, as well as a fair quantity of Merchandise, and I can tell you that this is a great conclusion to the show.  I have been waiting for them to bring out the Third generation ever since I first heard about it way back when I was a kid watching the show on TV in the 80's.  They did a great job on choosing voices that are aproipriate to the characters.  I won't spoil any of it, but trust me on this one.  Great Show!!!",1018310400,,490,3.8118811881188117
