6016605,5,B00FPENIHS,"Gem or a product showing you the difference of 1950's and Faith compared to the movies today like the TV's ""Bible series"" and movies like Noah and Exodus. Truly something the whole family can watch and quotes scripture, something it seems today that most don't like to do. Maybe the power of the scriptures is too much for the ungodly to hear.",1447891200,3,343,4.548387096774194

6016607,5,B00FPENIHS,"Excellent collection of Old Testament short films. Elijah, Samuel, & Joshua are some of the rare gems found in this older collection of movies. Lower budget yes, but entertaining & educational as well. Very accurate too. These are not documentaries but short stories about 30 min each. Over 4 1/2 hours long! This is also found in a DVD collection called The Living Bible however in that collection you are forced to purchase the Jesus section which was voiced over from the original with Nelson Leigh. When they did that, it wrecked the Jesus series part of the set because they did not use Nelson Leigh for the voice over but some other person who's voice does not fit the part. Here, you can buy just the Old Testament portion. Good idea VCI!

OLD TESTAMENT encompasses events and characters, from the book of Genesis to the book of Malachi. The stories are full of love, hope and faith. Includes 14 Old Testament stories: 1. Abraham, Man of Faith 2. Jacob, Bearer of the Promis 3. Joseph the Young Man 4. Joseph, Ruler of Egypt 5. Moses, Called By God 6. Moses, Leader of God's People 7. Joshua, The Conqueror 8. Gideon, The Liberator 9. Ruth A Faithful Woman 10. Samuel, A Dedicated Man 11. David, A Young Hero 12. David, A King of Israel 13. Solomon, A Man of Wisdom 14. Elijah, A Fearless Prophet.",1429574400,10,1304,4.548936170212766
