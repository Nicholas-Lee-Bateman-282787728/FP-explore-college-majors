6282048,4,B00IN3KZ9C,"NOTE: THIS BLU RAY IS THE CONCERT ONLY!  RUN TIME ~86 MINUTES.  ONE MUST PURCHASE THE MORE EXPENSIVE ""DELUXE EDITION"" TO GET THE BOOKLET AND VIDEO EXTRAS.

Received promptly on release date.  Sound is good (2 CH only); blu ray picture is very good.
Billy Joel and band are rockin' but I don't understand a few of the song choices given the audience.",1400544000,12,349,4.492063492063492

6282056,2,B00IN3KZ9C,One of the worst sounding concerts I have ever heard.  Even my wife asked me to turn it off.  Maybe the Russians enjoyed it.  From my concert stand point - IT SUCKED!!!!!,1454803200,,170,4.25
6282057,3,B00IN3KZ9C,"There was a moment between Billy and Alexa, which aired during the original special back in the 80s, where he was sitting at the piano and she was playing with some beads oblivious as only a sweet child can be of the fact that her daddy was making up a little song about her ...""my Alexa you are everything to me"".  My absolute favorite moment from this documentary and it is not included.  Heartbroken.",1451520000,,403,4.4324324324324325

6282065,5,B00IN3KZ9C,"Watched this on television recently, saw how good it was and I headed here to buy it. Great perspective here from Joel to his band mates chronicling their historic visit to Russia back in 1987. Included in this his daughter and ex-wife Christie Brinkley. Great documentary from start to finish.",1427760000,,294,4.9

6282068,4,B00IN3KZ9C,"At the invitation of the Kremlin, Billy Joel took the first large-scale rock tour to the Soviet Union in 1987, performing his greatest hits in Tbilisi, Moscow, and Leningrad as a good-will ambassador to a nation in the throes of change. In doing so, he became one of the powerful cultural influences that brought about the dissolution of that nation. Gorbachev introduced perestroika in 1986 and added glasnost in 1988, so Joel's concerts were of a piece with the new freedoms and opening to the West that transformed the Soviet bloc.

There are several ways to buy the concerts: as a two-CD set, as a DVD or Blu-ray, or in deluxe editions which pair a DVD or Blu-ray with the CDs. The audio recordings present 11 tracks that weren't on the original LP, called simply ""Concert,"" while the video discs include seven songs not on the original VHS release, entitled ""Live From Leningrad."" The sound and picture are excellent, as are the performances of Billy and his band. Although he strained his voice a bit early on in the tour, he managed to overcome the problem and put on exciting, energetic shows.

The 75-minute Showtime documentary added to the deluxe editions makes a strong argument for buying one of them. It captures the warmth, intimacy, excitement, and chaos of the tour, offering not only numerous clips from the concerts but also behind-the-scenes activities, a travelogue, and meetings with Russians. The many people involved (family, band, crew, producer, translator, and others) reflect on the pains and pleasures of the experience. Billy took his then-wife Christie Brinkley and baby daughter Alexa along; young Russians embraced them wholeheartedly and they reciprocated the feelings. The deluxe booklet contains new essays and archival photos.

I really enjoyed this set. It takes you back to one of the peaks of Billy Joel's career, and it remains a vital historical document.",1421884800,4,1897,5.035031847133758
6282069,5,B00IN3KZ9C,"I totally thought that this included the documentary, but it didn't. I still love Billy Joel so I kept it.",1420156800,,106,4.35
6282070,5,B00IN3KZ9C,"One of the best Billy Joel concerts on DVD.

6282075,3,B00IN3KZ9C,"This is a Blu-Ray disk but is only 2 CH audio output.  Priced at around $20 I thought it would be 5.1 audio.  The blu ray picture is very good and sound is good other than not having the punch you would normally expect from a Blu-Ray.  I don't think Billy Joel fans will be disappointed by this concert, but some would enjoy it more if the sound was better.",1408752000,2,357,4.071428571428571

6282078,4,B00IN3KZ9C,This is a very good program.  It has a lot of information about Russia.  And Billy Joel isn't bad either.,1405555200,,105,4.2
6282079,3,B00IN3KZ9C,"Billy Joel is one my favorite musicians so I was looking forward to watching this DVD. I was under the impression that the BLU-RAY version of this ALSO contained the documentary that aired on Showtime back in February. It doesn't..and that's my misunderstanding - my fault. I also figured that the audio would be available in 5.1 DTS since just about everything I've bought regarding music concerts in the last couple of years have had that option. It doesn't. Only stereo. I think this release could've been so much better than this. I guess if you want the documentary you MUST purchase the ""Deluxe Edition"", It's a great concert but I'm left a bit disappointed.",1405296000,7,664,4.782608695652174

6282088,4,B00IN3KZ9C,"I've had this on VHS since it was originally released back in the '80's. I don't know why it's taken so long to release this, but I'm glad they finally did!

8643517,4,B00IN3KZ9C,"Excellent video footage and song selection.  Although, it was sad to observe how impaired Billy Joel became especially towards the end of the concert when he removed his shoes and spun on top of the piano on his stomach.",1515542400,,220,4.641025641025641
