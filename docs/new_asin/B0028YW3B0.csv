8357191,5,B0028YW3B0,"It was definitely a prejudice of my generation that psychedelics, or entheogens as they are now called, have consciousness expanding properties, and worthwhile applications.  What a pleasure then to hear that others who are respected pioneers in various fields, including Dr. Albert Hofmann, the ""father"" of LSD and thinkers of the caliber of Aldous Huxley agree with me.
I am glad that there is renewed interest in acid, DMT and ecstasy, and this video is an informative examination of acid's early history and the pioneers in its research.  Important history for anyone seeking to further their understanding. I also purchased LSD - Problem Child and Wonder Drug - from Amazon which is a complementary DVD of the 100th birthday of Albert Hofmann.",1360281600,7,748,5.122950819672131
