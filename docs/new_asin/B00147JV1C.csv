2 were pretty worthless, one was a mere ok, but this one is really excellent.

The DVD explains how your D300's functions work and how to use a consistent ""workflow"" for setting up your camera before the shoot, at the location and before and during the shot in a shooting session.
It touches the most important menu settings and gives you a good explanation of them, along with a recommendation. (The menu system will be covered in full in volume 2 of this DVD)
The other DVD's covered the menu's in full, but it was no more than summing up a list of them.
Furthermore it gives you a quick but usefull course on photography topics such as exposure, metering, focus, DOF, white balance, flash  and composition.
The pace of the DVD is fast, which means there is a lot of information packed into it.
But we have a rewind button ...

I also have seen the two ""Through the Eyes of a Pro"" DVD's by Blue Crane Digital which are of the same high quality. Good tips on photography illustrated by real world examples.

To sum it up, if you want video training for your Nikon or Canon, check out Blue Crane Digital's website and see what video's they have for your camera model and photography in general. These are the only DVD's you will need. And watch future releases! ;)

Nikon produces a large and very detailed manual, but in reality, their manuals are difficult to use - at least for me.  Fortunately, I had been using a D80 and much of the experience was transferrable to the D300. The DVD is far more than an instructional video for the D300 as it has considerable information on photography in general.

Once into the body of the D300 information, the chapters are well organized and easily understood. The DVD stresses learning to use the camera in a way that many of the settings will become useable without taking your eye from the viewfinder. Do the exercises as they will make using the camera much more efficient and in the end will free you to do what it is you want to do -- make images! The D300 is a powerful and incredibly flexible camera which will more than serve the needs of any photographer.  The DVD will allow you to appreciate the instrument you are holding in your hands as you and it manages every aspect of the image you want to make. If there is a shortcoming in the DVD it's the amount of time spent in the more advanced functions. However, as they mention, this area will become a separate version to be released later this year.  For my use, that can't come too soon.  A final comment - The DVD shouldn't be seen as a ""view it once and you'll have it all."" It is a very user friendly presentation and will become a tremendous resource allowing you to use and appreciate the power and flexibility of the D300.

8254642,3,B00147JV1C,"This is the third in a series of training tutorials I have purchased from the USA - all of which, incidentally, work perfectly well in my DVD player here in the UK.

The title of the product is an ""Introduction to the Nikon D300"" camera. Anyone who is already conversant with the complexities and techniques of other digital cameras and has upgraded to the D300 will probably learn very little from this product. For those of us who are beginning a whole new chapter in photography by converting to digital for the first time, there is much to learn and understand and this tutorial is quite reasonable in achieving the goals required.

If, however, you are new to photography altogether and the D300 is your very first camera, there may be certain areas such as the correlation between film speeds, shutter speeds and aperture settings which need to be understood before you sit down and watch this DVD.

The presentation is rather wooden but not as monotone as some I have seen. If, however, I were to make one truly constructive criticism, it would be that the speed of delivery is often too fast.

The only way to learn through these tutorials is to sit down with a Nikon D300 and follow what is being said. I found too many instances when the presenter made one point and by the time I had looked at my camera and back again at the screen he had already moved on and I had missed something. This was especially evident towards the end of the DVD and gave me the impression he was in a hurry to be elsewhere.

All that said, this particular DVD runs for approx. 2 hours and compares very well to others. Criticisms about it being for beginners are misplaced - because it is INTENDED to be an introduction to the camera and is not for advanced users.

The presentation ends with recommendations of two further Blue Crane products called ""Through the eyes of a Pro"" which, we are informed, contain more advanced instruction. I already possess these products and will be studying them very shortly. So watch this space.

NM

Addendum. I have now studied ""Through the eyes of a Pro (Volume 1)"" and found it to be very different from what I was given to expect. That product contains no specific instructions relating to the Nikon D300 camera whatsoever. See my review of that particular product for more information.
