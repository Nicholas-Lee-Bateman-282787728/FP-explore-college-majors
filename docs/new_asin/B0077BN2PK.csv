8511676,3,B0077BN2PK,"The Khans of Bollywood as it's titled led me to think there would be more of a varitety of songs among the four Khans but most of the songs are with SRK, then Saif Ali Khan.  There were like one or two songs with Aamir and Imran which was kind of disappointing.  Especially when you put a picture of the four of them on the front, it's misleading what you get inside.  If they had more songs by the others, I would have added another star.  Having said that, the songs are a good mix of recent and not-so-recent hits and if you're a SRK lover, then this would be a good choice to add to your collection.",1356912000,,603,4.084745762711864
