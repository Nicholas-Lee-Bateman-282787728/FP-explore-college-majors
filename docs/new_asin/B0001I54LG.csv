8220697,4,B0001I54LG,"Conte builds up 5 basic rhythm tracks (some with a band), demonstrating the use of overdubs in the studio to get the effect he wants. He likens himself to a chef mixing different spices, a good analogy. He plays congas, bongos, cajon, timbales, djembes, shekere, caxixi and more. He demonstrates an interesting technique for 2 tambourines. He demonstrates how to give a latin feel or a funk or pop feel to the same basic track by varying the percussion patterns.

He shows how to add 'percussion color' using lot of toys, effects and small instruments. I didn't think he was as good as Airto in this part but you can still learn a lot.

He's recorded with Jackson Browne, Andy Narell, Madonna, Toto, Pat Metheny and many, many more artists.

Overall, a very useful video for the percussionist who wants to move towards the professional level.",1210550400,5,842,4.7534246575342465

I have more dvd's about percussion, but I like this one a lot! I can advise this one to everyone who will see what you can do with percussion.",1135728000,5,262,4.1568627450980395
