5597604,4,B00BEIYLWA,"""Ginger & Rosa"" is the story of two inseparable 17-year-old girls who ditch school together, discuss religion, politics, and hairstyles with equal fervor, and dream of lives more promising than their mothers' frustrated domesticity. The time is 1962, and the girls have begun to take independent paths. Rosa (Alice Englert), who was raised by an inattentive mother, is troubled and shunned by other kids and their parents. She smokes cigarettes, longs to find love, and is nearly oblivious to the mounting tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, believing it is all in God's hands.

Ginger (Elle Fanning) is far more serious. She writes poetry and is concerned about nuclear war. There's considerable tension between her and her mom (Christina Hendricks) and intellectual, atheist father (Alessandro Nivola), who was a conscientious objector during World War II.
 Timothy Spall, Oliver Platt, and Annette Bening deliver excellent supporting performances as Ginger's gay godparents and their friend Bella. Director Sally Potter re-creates the era convincingly. Those who are old enough to remember the fears of the Cuban missile crisis will find the film captures that tension and uncertainty of that time.

""Ginger & Rosa"" is an atypical coming-of-age movie given an interesting spin by its time frame and depiction of a traditional type of family life that could simultaneously offer security and restlessness.

DVD bonus extras include deleted scenes, cast interviews, audio commentary with director Sally Potter, and two making-of featurettes.",1374883200,,1562,5.495833333333334
5597605,4,B00BEIYLWA,"GINGER & ROSA is a quiet, relatively uneventful tale of two British girls growing up during the era of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Those who want a conventional storyline with plenty of suspense and fast action will, understandably, find it rather dull: GINGER & ROSA is driven almost entirely by character, themes, and dialogue. Yet, there is an indescribable magic to this film. After a slow, uncertain start, GINGER & ROSA slowly hypnotizes its audience with very real characters and multiple issues. The big global issue of the the Bomb is juxtaposed very well with the smaller interrelationships between the characters.

Ginger, the protagonist, is an aspiring poet, and the film itself is structured a bit like a poem. It addresses the complexities of growing up, inseparable friendship, the pain that comes when something disrupts it, and many other things. As one who's battled with depression on and off for most of his life, I found GINGER & ROSA very illuminating about the nature of despair, melancholy, and all of that.

While intrigued, I still wondered for most of the first 80 minutes or so, ""Where is all this supposed to be going?"" Nothing terribly dramatic ever happens, but, like a good poem, the fine ending and resolution made me glad I'd stayed with it.",1374710400,3,1274,4.920930232558139
5597606,5,B00BEIYLWA,"This story of rebellion and betrayal focuses on a remarkable teenage girl caught in a political, social, and emotional tornado. But don't let the teen angst warning siren fool you: Sally Potter manages to steer the film safely away from predictability. Dialog, photography, soundtrack, and editing are all artful. Every performance is top-notch, especially Fanning as Ginger.
If you're a Potter fan you'll find this perhaps tamer than her other films but certainly not weaker. If you're not a Potter fan, give it a try; this might be the most approachable film she's made.",1374537600,5,572,5.095744680851064
5597607,2,B00BEIYLWA,"Two girls grow up as best friends, but drift apart as they near adulthood. They become active in nuclear disarmament and one of them gets involved in an inappropriate relationship. Well, having slept through much of this film, I cannot go into further detail on the storyline, but I can tell you that the highlight of the film is near the end when Ginger (Elle Fanning) has an emotional outburst that exposes the affair. Overall, this is a pretty dull film that could have been more interesting had it been spiced up a bit.",1370822400,3,523,4.574468085106383
5597608,5,B00BEIYLWA,"This remarkable, small film arrived and departed in the blink of an eye. There were only a handful of people in the audience when I saw it. I did not know who the director was and I had never seen a movie with Elle Fanning. If you like quality acting then you should definitely buy the DVD of this film. This film has the the kind of performances that we rarely see. And Elle Fanning (who was only 13) gives one of the best performances I have ever seen by any actor at any age. If you want to see an actor completely disappear into their role this is a film you will watch more than once. Be prepared. This film was advertised as a ""coming of age"" film about two teenage girls who are watching their friendship disintegrate; however this film takes in a lot of psychological ground and slowly builds to an emotional intensity that is searing.",1367107200,16,843,4.3081761006289305
5597609,4,B00BEIYLWA,"""Ginger & Rosa"" (2012 release from the UK; 90 min.) brings the story of two young women, Ginger (played by Elle Fanning) and Rosa (played by Alice Englert), growing up as 17 year olds in 1962. As the movie opens, we see the mushroom cloud of the atomic bomb which was just unleashed over Hiroshima, and indeed the nuclear threat hangs over the movie from start to finish. Ginger and Rosy are ""BFFs"" as it would be called these days, even though they are very different. Ginger is the romantic poet who will quote Simone de Beauvoire (""who?"" asks Rosa), and when Ginger wants to protest against the nuclear bomb, Rosa retorts ""we should pray"". In the end, they do both, going to church and then going to an anti-nuke demonstration. Meanwhile, Ginger's parents are having their own domestic problems, Roland being the free-spirited professor who want to ""break the rules, all the rules"". Rosa certainly notices the troubles too as she starts to fancy Roland. At that point we are about half-way into the movie, and to tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience. Will Rosa and Roland become an item? Will Ginger's mum and dad find a way to solve their marital issues? What will become of Ginger and Rosa's friendship ""for life""? You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, British writer-director Sally Potter does an outstanding job transporting us 50 years back in time, when indeed it was a different world. In that sense, this does not feel like a movie made in this day and age, but rather a late 60s or early 70s drama. Second, the use of the nuclear threat to advance the story line works surprisingly well (it includes the Cuban missile crisis, as experienced from afar in the UK). Third, the acting performances are ace throughout, although special kudos to Elli Fanning, featuring flaming red hair, who exudes a confidence and screen presence that belies her age (she is still only 15). Last but not least, kudos also for the excellent soundtrack, featuring music from those days. I literally hadn't heard The Shadows' ""Apache"" in ages (maybe even decades). There is also a number of jazz tracks from the likes of Thelonious Monk and Dave Brubeck.

The screening I saw this at the local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati was very well attended, I am happy to say, which gives me hope that there is an strong appetite and demand for this movie. Bottom line: this is a little gem of a movie, a tender yet at times intense coming-of-age saga and family drama. This is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, but if you are in the mood for something small yet personal, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Ginger & Rosa"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1366329600,27,2723,4.682672233820459

5597735,5,B00BEIYLWA,"Ginger and Rosa are two teenage girls finding their paths in 1960s England. Conveying the naivete of growing up in the 60's, where all things seem clear cut, this film examines the freedoms and risks of the generation. The contrasts between the two characters, childhood friends, are jarring, as they often are in real life. Whilst Ginger looks like the one who is going to challenge attitudes, it is actually Rosa's behaviour, and that of Ginger's parents, that rap hard against the prevailing conservatism of the day. At times inspiring admiration, at other times inspiring disappointment, these two central characters, and the fantastic supporting cast, will certainly make you think and feel.",1422662400,,696,5.223214285714286

If you saw her somewhat smiley interpretation of Aurora in Maleficent recently, this movie shows her acting chops much better than Maleficent.  It's two girls struggling with their relationship while dealing with the growing threat of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile crisis in 1962, although the two girls are actually in Great Britain.

Otherwise, the over-hyped end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it theme is an intermittent distraction, and not done very well.

5597820,3,B00BEIYLWA,"Thought the story was interesting, but the plot details were a bit predictable.  And hard to empathize with most of the characters, except Ginger (Elle Fanning).  Film was very dark (figurately and literally) as it showed the two girls dealing with the possible end of their world while they are still growing up while their personal lives are also torn up by their dysfunctional families.

Of course, the world as we didn't end up as we know, but the two teenage girls were damaged by their personal situations.

Not much of a message to convey.  Script definitely needed more in the way of resolution or decision-making by most of the characters.  Just left with a blood mess for everyone..",1391385600,,692,4.773109243697479

It is never really speeds up and if you don't give it a chance you will miss all the nuance. The movie moves subtly and the scene is more important than the action or dialogue. The acting is superb because so much is portrayed with such a gentle movement. The action of Ginger dragging her hand in the water in a bored and thoughtful way stuck with me much more than the words she spoke. If you enjoy a typical American movie with action and strong guidance through the story you will be disappointed in this movie.

5597896,3,B00BEIYLWA,"Elle Fanning plays Ginger, a London teenage girl living in the early 1960s. Her best friend is free-spirited Rosa (Alice Englert, daughter of Jane Campion and Colin Englert), but their long, sister-like friendship changes, as it becomes clear to Ginger that her parents marriage is falling apart. Also, it was the time of the Cold War, and people including Ginger are getting more and more afraid of the possible nuclear war.

Elle Fanning turns in a strong performance as a vulnerable teenager afraid of nuclear annihilation, who gradually realizes that the world around her would be crumbling anyway if it were not for Cuban Missile Crisis. Her parents marriage has long been teetering on the brink of collapse. Her friendship with Rosa is not what it used to be.

Sally Potter tries to re-create the atmosphere of the post-World War II era, an increasingly more anxiety-ridden nuclear age, but for all her best effort, the time she depicts looks very distant. What is more impressive is insecure Ginger and her world surrounded by flawed adults (impressive supporting cast includes Annette Bening, Christina Hendricks, Jodhi May, Alessandro Nivola, Oliver Platt and Timothy Spall), but even this story, if stripped of its 1960s settings, is after all a familiar coming-of-age tale.

Ginger & Rosa is written a directed by Sally Potter, who is still best remembered as director of Orlando starring Tilda Swinton. It was an ambitious work, of which success is because of Derek Jarman's muse Tilda Swinton, who went on to become an Oscar winner. In anything, Ginger & Rosa will be remembered as a film that discovered Elle Fanning.

5597899,4,B00BEIYLWA,"Set against the backdrop of the Cold War, ""Ginger and Rosa"" is a complex tale of two adolescent girls, best friends from childhood, coming of age in early 1960s England.

Ginger, so named because of her flaming red hair, is the more socially awkward of the two, and it is she who has recently become obsessed with the threat of global nuclear annihilation. Rosa seems a bit more worldly and experimental overall, more willing to take a dip in that tantalizing pool known as adulthood with all the attended mysteries - and risks - it has to offer. This creates a bit of a problem for the two when Rosa becomes romantically involved with Ginger's handsome step dad who has recently separated from Ginger`s mom.

Ginger struggles to find herself amidst the Cuban Missile Crisis, Ban the Bomb rallies and the tumultuous lives of the people around her. Failed marriages, unfulfilled lives, unreliable friendships - these become the preoccupations of a young girl who has the added concern of a world seemingly on the path to blowing itself up to deal with. Or is that broader concern just a convenient way for her to deflect and sublimate the pain brought on by her relationships with her mother, stepfather and best friend, not to mention the perfectly ordinary growing pains common to adolescence?

Writer/director Sally Potter doesn't feel the need to answer that question, and one of the movie's strongest assets is that it doesn't deal with its subject matter and themes in black-and-white terms. It feels real precisely because it doesn't pigeonhole its characters or provide a neat, carefully planned-out narrative for the audience to follow. We're allowed to observe these people from an appropriate emotional distance and to render our own judgment - or lack of judgment - on them. They may be screwed up, but we see a lot of ourselves reflected in them, even if we don't care to fully admit it.

Elle Fanning turns in a remarkably self-assured performance as Ginger, and she receives excellent support from Alice Englert as Rosa, Alessandro Nivola as the step dad, and Christina Hendricks from ""Mad Men"" as her mom. Moreover, Timothy Spall, Oliver Platt and Annette Benning appear as unconventional but sympathetic neighbors who Greek-chorus their way through the film.",1383868800,,2274,4.960629921259843

The other characters just fall apart as the betrayer prattles on about free love and other nonsense. This tale takes place in the 60s, everyone awash in hippy-feelings as this monstrous act unfolds. The fact that they are adrift without social and moral moorings makes it hard for them to articulate just what exactly is the wrong that has been done to them. I have a coworker who was able to do something similar, leave behind him a familial train wreck that included suicide and endless pain for everyone but him. He comes to work smiling, happy, the new young girl on his arm, and we wonder how he does it. The human capacity for self-delusion is astounding.",1382400000,,936,4.544378698224852

The movie is not perfect, but Elle Fanning is so good in this movie that she sustains it through the end. She is in almost every frame of the movie and she is truly amazing, interpreting a young teenager in early 1960s London. Physically, she reminds me of a young Drew Barrymore, particularly when she smiles. The recreation of that particular time is excellent, even if the movie probably was done with a small budget. There is also a pleasure to see some wonderful actors, as Annette Bening, Timothy Spall and Oliver Platt  as support players. Alessandro Nivola is also good in the ugly role of an extremely selfish, clueless, and self-centered father.

5597972,3,B00BEIYLWA,"A decent, well-presented film with good intentions (despite quite a few suggestive scenes) from director, Sally Potter. I didn't live during the sixties nor have I ever been to the UK. My parents were pre-teens doing homework under the street lamps in some third-world country, so I can't go to them for experiences about the cold war and the nuclear threat either. But all that doesn't matter. I think the point of the film wasn't to tell a historically accurate story, but to show the life of a teenage girl who is struggling to come to terms with her parents' disintegrating marriage and her evolving friendship with her hormonally-charged best friend.

My only gripe with the film is that the story is supposed to be about best friends, Ginger and Rosa, yet I came away from it not being able to see Rosa as she is viewed through  Ginger's eyes at all. I didn't know what Ginger thought about Rosa, or how she came to the conclusion she did at the end. (Though, admittedly, I was touched by its message.)

Elle Fanning faltered in some parts (junkyard scene, for instance), but was amazing overall. I wish the actress who played Rosa was written with more emotional depth. I felt something missing from her. I didn't truly understand her or care for her much. I'm not sure if this was intentional. Everyone else was good, but not three-dimensional, except for Alessandro's ""Roland"", who I thought was great in a very unethical way.

5597976,4,B00BEIYLWA,"I have never watched the same film two nights in a row. Until now.  ""Ginger & Rosa"" starring---let me emphasize this---STARRING 13-year old Elle Fanning.  In this 2012 production from Great Britain, the youngest of the Fanning sisters gets top billing oversuch established stars as Annette Bening, ""Mad Men's"" Christina Hendricks and Oliver Platt.  OK, it only makes sense she is recognized for the top spot.  After all, she is the main character in this London-based film as it addresses the expected Armageddon emanating from the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.  Intended or not, the film is a coming-of-age showcase for Fanning's prococious talent.

  Affecting an Enlish accent with her usual blonde tresses dyed red (eyebrows, too), Fanning is cast, appropriately enough, as Ginger.  She is a perceptive, sensitive teen who tries to be pleasing
to all, but is not afraid to speak her mind.

  Ginger has a world view and is rightfully fearful of being incinerated in a nuclear holocaust as the Soviet Union and the United States play Russian Roulette brinkmanship that could eradicate civilization.  Her fears are not based on youthful over-reaction or paranoia.  The possibility of mutual disintegration, particularly in North America, all of Europe and the British Isles were legitimate concerns in the early 1960's.  It's the closest our world has come to all-out nuclear war.

  Rosa (Alice Englert) despite being Ginger's best friend, is oblivious to politics and believes love and God will solve all problems.

  Taking after the political/social values of her quasi-beatnik/pacifist father (Alessandro Nivola) who is estranged from Ginger's more traditional mom (Hendricks), Ginger attends a Ban the Bomb meeting and peace protests.  An inappropriate relationship develops between two members of the Ginger/Rosa families which causes emotional pain to Ginger.  But, instead of directly dealing with this conflict, Ginger overly-obsesses about the possibility of nuclear war as she subliminates the more immediate, real and personal problem that is causing her additional stress and near-emotional breakdown.  Finally, in the most-intense scene of the film, both extended families meet and Ginger, in a teary whisper of revelation shares the secret that has torn her apart,  This candid confession may prove fatal to one family member but the possible death is never made clear.  And that's all I'm saying.  I've given hints but no total spoilers are being offered in this review.

  Elle Fanning acts with youthful charm and, at times, adult emotion.  She's an actress with talent, poise and timing way beyond her years.  Her performance as Ginger, particularly in the revelatory scene alluded to above, is the most powerful and insightful acting by a young female of this age since Natalie Portman's debut in the mid-1990's with ""Leon: The Professional"" followed by ""Beautiful Girls.""  In the 2013 awards season, Fanning was nominated for Best Young Actress by the Broadcast Film Critics Association and Best Performance by an actress in a British Independent Film.

  Written and directed with sensitivity by Sally Potter.  She worked in collaboration with a great cast that pulled together during their five-week shoot in Dungeness, Kent, England to create insighful cinema.  (According to IMDb, the film has earned $1,005,700 as of May 31, 2013.  Probably cost much more in production and talent costs.  A sad commentary on the mass, movie-going public who obviously prefer bloated, repetitive green-screen monstrosities over thoughtful film-making.  Such is the lot of the independent film community.  Hopefully, the secondary market of DVD sales/rentals and pay-per-views, etc. will help the producers to recoup their investment.)

  Special kudos to cinematographer Robbie Ryan for his active, free-form shooting throughout the film.  Specifically, the last scene where he perfectly lit Fanning's face as she interpreted a voice-over poem of hope and forgiveness.  The lighting caused an amazing metamorphosis as Fanning's face seemed to mature into an older and wiser young lady with attendant thoughts, understandings and perceptions in conformance with her physical change.

  ""Ginger & Rosa"" is honest film-making populated by well-written, fleshed-out characters showing the human condition from altruistic, humane idealism to boorish, deluded selfishness.  Director Potter's latest creation earns four stars out of five.  Strongly recommended.",1377993600,5,4466,5.5022091310751104

5598012,4,B00BEIYLWA,"Watching Elle Fanning's career blossom has me saddened over what happened to her sister, Dakota.  When Dakota came onto the scene in the early aughts, she was the next big thing.  Now her sister has proven to not only be the better actress, but to be the one with more cinematic curiosity.  She shows such depth in selecting her projects, working with the likes of David Fincher and Sophia Coppola and delivering outstanding performances in a slew of films.

`Ginger & Rosa' is no exception.

This was a surprising film for me, in many ways.  First, the only other film of Potter's I've seen is `Orlando', and I found that to be a seriously misguided mess.  When I saw her name splash across the scene during the opening credits I cringed a little.  Next, I had no idea what this film was about, outside of a friendship between the two title girls.  I kind of expected this to be a lighter film, and when the opening scenes came to life with teenage flaunting and flirting and awkward carelessness I figured I was going to get exactly what I expected.

And then things shifted.

The weight of the film came crushing down as the political and environmental and eventual moral cruxes of the film's core came to life.  The basic premise follows two young girls, Ginger and Rosa, who grew up together.  Daughters of two friends, the two girls have a bond that cannot be shaken, despite serious attempts by life to do so.  Growing up in London during the Cuban missile crisis of the 60's, both Ginger and Rosa have some serious issues to contend with.  Let alone the looming threat of extinction, but Rosa is a fatherless child and Ginger's own parents are splitting up.  Color that in with some sketchy actions between Ginger's father and Rosa and you have Ginger backed into a corner and completely torn at the seams as to what to do and how to proceed.  Her political activism and her father's constant encouragement to break the rules and be her own person have her confused as to where life is going to take her, and her idealism and love of poetry truly make her a free spirit, trapped by the world around her.

Elle Fanning is a revelation here.  She gets so much of this young woman absolutely correct, and colors her in to perfection.  The rest of the cast is also top notch though, with Alice Englert haunting in the background and Timothy Spall, Oliver Platt and Annette Bening serving as not only some mild comic relief and also some moral compasses in a sea of moral dilemmas.

Sally Pottor's construction here is rather beautiful and calls to mind Jane Campion (who just so happens to be Englert's mother).  She gives us overlays of scenes that come together quietly to develop characters and themes, and she allows the cinematography (stunning) to soak in the atmosphere and present us with something truly jarring.  It comes together rather nicely in the end, building to a climax and then simmering in a way that allows the audience to make their own decisions and draw their own conclusions.  I felt that some of the development (especially regarding Rosa) was too light and could have used a firmer hand, but the film has so many pluses that it is hard to fault it much.",1376265600,,3184,4.584805653710247
