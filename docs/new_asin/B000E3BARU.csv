2485370,3,B000E3BARU,"This budget DVD set contains three horror movies on 2 DVD's. There are no extra features and no chapter indexes. The movies play as soon as you press the icon labeled ""play"". Still, you get three decent horror movies for less than $10.

Leviathan(1989): This sci-fi-horror ""popcorn"" film is an homage to Alien(1979) and The Thing(1982). It's directed by the late George P. Cosmatos(Rambo First Blood Part II, Tombstone). It stars Peter Weller, Daniel Stern, Amanda Pays, Richard Crenna, Ernie Hudson, Lisa Eilbacher, and others. Three underwater mining crew members in the not-too-distant future are poisoned after drinking contaminated vodka found on a derelict Russian boat. Their body parts morph into a slimy, lethal monster. This film uses blue lighting and fake fish to simulate an environment under the ocean. It also recycles costumes from 2010(1984).
I used to watch Leviathan on the Sci-Fi/SyFy Channel in the 1990's. The music score by Jerry Goldsmith is good. Leviathan is a well-made popcorn movie from the late 1980's.

Lifeforce(1985): Lifeforce was a critical and commercial failure in 1985. Tri-Star Pictures recut, rescored and re-edited the US version of the film. This DVD preserves the UK version of the film. In Lifeforce, three space vampires make it to Earth and prey on humans. Instead of sucking blood, they suck your ""elan vital/lifeforce"". A British officer(Peter Firth) and an American astronaut(Steve Railsback) race against time to save the Earth. A young Patrick Stewart played Doctor Armstrong.
French model/singer/actress Mathilda May played the film's sexy antagonist.  Tobe Hooper directed the film from a screenplay by Dan O' Bannon and Don Jakoby. The film was based on the 1976 novel The Space Vampires by Colin Wilson. Time has been kind to Lifeforce. Species(1995) and Star Trek have borrowed ideas from the film. John Dykstra crafted the film's 1st rate visual effects. The late Henry Mancini composed Lifeforce's epic, energetic, sweeping music score. Some music cues in the US version were composed by the late Michael Kamen.

Burnt Offerings(1976): A house rejuvenates itself after killing people off.

This budget DVD is worth the money.",1328745600,7,2183,5.279538904899136
2485371,3,B000E3BARU,"I haven't had a chance to watch the other films and to be honest I'm not familiar enough with them to know any difference but this version of Life Force differs from the version I've seen.  It watches like a rougher version of the final edit.

I know this movie backwards and forwards, it isn't the greatest film but is memorable because it was the first R feature I saw underage in theaters.

There are extra scenes and extra dialogue that were cut-out of the theater version.  The musical track differs from the regular version somewhat.  Striking differences in the score are the more ""scary scenes"" where the pathologist is being attacked by the guard and where they are being attacked by the soldier ghouls on the helicopter.  The score on this version just doesn't work in some scenes.  I think the music was re-edited again afterwards to improve the score.

There are other subtle things like sound effects and voices being different. Some of them here sound a little half-baked compared to the theater version (the radio voice discussing the plague in London wasn't as intense).  Although, it is kind of cool to hear the mix like this compared to my theater version VHS tape from the 80's.  Kind of reminds you why there is an army of people who work on a film, each version changing and getting tighter.  Also, how these little subtle things add up to effect the effectiveness of the whole movie.

While it was cool to hear some of the extra dialogue, I can definitely see why it was cut-out.  It added nothing and some of it was way too On-The-Nose.  The final editors must have zapped the words ""space vampire or vampire"" out of the theater version multiple times.  This expository dialogue on vampires really sounds silly.  They also condensed some of the dragging scenes found on this version (The space ship vampire chamber, Carlsen opening the vampire's casing).

If you're a fan of this film and want to see some of what was cut-out, check it out.
If you're someone wanting to watch this film for the first time (if that's possible), SKIP THIS DVD.  It is way inferior to the finished theater version.",1323043200,3,2117,4.645161290322581
2485372,3,B000E3BARU,"Just picked up this triple feature because I wanted Burnt Offerings, and for the price, I figured I might as well get more bang for my buck. I already had Lifeforce in a single disc edition, so my thought was that I could get rid of it after getting this. For starters, Lifeforce is in need of an anamorphic transfer (maybe the blu ray will get released?), but here, you get the same letterboxed print as on the single disc. HOWEVER, the big difference is, on the single disc version of Lifeforce, the audio is in 5.1 surround--on this triple feature, it's only 2.0 stereo!!! Bummer.",1319328000,4,583,4.509433962264151
2485373,5,B000E3BARU,"This isn't a review of the three movies in this set, but it is a review of the set itself: excellent (not totally pristine, but regular dvd quality) prints of all 3 movies; no ""frills"" (no subtitles/captioning) but if you're looking for 3 decent movies (none are great, but all are entertaining) for CHEEEEEP look no further.  Not some schlocky package where some huckster transferred old VHS onto dvd (we've all see that!), but very nice treatments.  All widescreen, and, yes, this is the version of ""Lifeforce"" that is apparently extended, as it is quite close to 2 hours long (I think 1hr 56 min.?).  Don't hesitate because of the price...nothing at all wrong with these versions of these films.  ONE note: I haven't seen any other dvd version of ""Burnt Offerings"", but this showed some fuzzy light saturation moments, which very well could have been intentional in the original film, as they seemed to fit ""artistically"".",1318636800,,925,4.872611464968153
2485374,5,B000E3BARU,This is another triple feature that is an excellent buy. Going for $6.95 at this current date you get three really good horror movies. First you get Leviathan which is a creature feature. Next up is Burnt Offerings which is one of the better haunted house movies. Lastly you also get Lifeforce which is a space vampire movie. I bought this set for Leviathan because it was a cheaper price than the single dvd for it. What I ended up getting is Leviathan plus two other bonus features which I didn't have. All movies are presented in the widescreen format. Leviathan is anamorphic 2.35:1. Burnt Offerings is anamorphic 1.85:1. Lifeforce is Letterboxed 2.35:1. This means Lifeforce is not anamorphic widescreen and will have the large bars on the top and bottom of your screen. Leviathan and Burnt Offerings are together on one disc. The second disc contains Lifeforce by itself. There are no special features for any of the movies unlike on the single disc versions. Leviathan was a bare bones disc to begin with. Burnt Offerings came with a director and star audio commentary which this set does not contain. Lifeforce doesn't have the additional 15 minutes of footage that was not shown in theatres like the single retail disc has. So overall you are getting no special features with this triple feature but you are getting a great price on this set. The picture on all three movies is excellent.,1299024000,22,1397,4.776859504132231
