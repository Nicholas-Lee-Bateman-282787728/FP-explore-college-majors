4897934,5,B005W2BWQW,I bought the first 3 disc sets from Fry's Electronics which where also on sale for about $20 and for the amount of content in each set this is a bargain.  I just began watching One Piece and though some would argue that one dub is superior to another I am enjoying the English dub for this collection and would recommend anyone on the fence to take a leap of faith and get this collection.  With the amount of episodes you get for only $20 it's a bargain.  I was absorbed and the day it arrived I watched all 4 discs (which each have about 2-3 hours of content) in one marathon and now I can't wait for my next order to come in march to keep watching.,1330646400,,651,4.0703125
4897935,5,B005W2BWQW,"Funimation does it again with One Piece : Collection Four. This is what I, and most anime fans believe what a box set should be (aside from collections that have every episode). Gathering multiple volumes is too tedious a task, especially seeing that usual volume sets have like 6 episodes.
Volume 4 is great because Tony Chopper is introduced, a very interesting character who adds to the comedic dynamic of the Strawhat crew. Also you meet Luffy's brother, who is another solid character.

Must own if your a One Piece fan trying to get rid of volume clutter....and def worth buying if you have the other 3. I'm now ready for the 5th collection with Usopp on the cover which is out the 13th of March!",1330128000,,702,4.571428571428571
4897936,5,B005W2BWQW,"Through ice and snow, through desert heat,
Luffy finds ways villains can get beat!
He also adds members to his crew, learns the ways of the Grand Line, Fouls everything up, saves kingdoms, helps people and confuses them by never quite acting like a pirate, just a very chaotic hero. With a nearly bottomless stomach, a love of kicking bad guys butts and a goal of becoming king of the pirates.",1329177600,,393,4.549295774647887
4897937,5,B005W2BWQW,"As others have stated in reviews under some of the other of the three collections, this collection is great if you are just starting out into owning a One Piece set.  I am assuming nothing new under the sun for the 4th installation from the previously released (3) sets as the first three were pretty much what you'd expect.  Great quality audio/video for the price.  The total run-time of each previous collection clocks in around 650 minutes total (26 episodes per set), this set states 600 minutes containing 25 episodes presumably to end it coinciding with the end of Season Two, Fourth Voyage which appears the approach (to encompass full 'Voyages').  If you've never watched One Piece, I suggest starting at the beginning.",1326067200,2,728,4.894308943089431

4898043,5,B005W2BWQW,"There are no words to describe this show except for Epic.  At first I thought this show was going to be a silly kid's show with not the best animation style.  After thinking this for many years, and mocking it for the always remembered 4kids version, I decided to take on the beast of an anime with 500+ episodes.  Best decision I have ever made.  It starts of really rocky at first, but once you reach Arlong park, the necessity to keep going urges you on.  After entering the grand line the story just gets better and better.  As the straw hat pirate's ship grows in experience and crew mates, my interest continues to grow.  Once I reached Water 7 there was no going back.  The story line that the author/mangaka, Eiichiro Oda, created is the most incredible tale I have ever heard.  Not only does the world make you forget all about your own, but the story and characters make you want to leave reality and join the Mugiwara (strawhat) crew.  No show or anime has ever made me feel this or at least to this extent.  I have now rewatched the whole show two times all the way through and have dragged a lot of my friends into this addictive tale.  They would have it no other way.  Oda is a master at story telling to the point where I was crying with every character and even over the loss of a certain ""nakama"" I never thought I would cry over.  The only other word is Brilliance.  Sheer Brilliance.  This show is my favorite anime of all time. I would say it is also in my favorite top 3 stories of all time, if not top 2. :)  Thank you for your brilliance, Oda, and for caring about us over here, Funimation. :)",1377129600,7,1617,4.249180327868852

Cooming Soon One Piece Collection Five Review",1339891200,35,2584,4.754464285714286
4898087,5,B005W2BWQW,"Back in 2002 I began reading One Piece after a trip to Japan. 10 years later and we finally have a product that accurately reflects why so many people love this series.

The comedy is spot on, the voice acting is flawless, and they don't gloss over the best messages within the story. If you're a History buff and a fan of classic novels and movies, it's especially fun to spot the overlapping themes in each story section. The theme of 'The Master Race', Stalin's Purge, some Lawrence of Arabia, a bit of El Dorado and even Gulliver's Travels!

Don't let the art style fool you, this adventure is great for kids and adults. If you appreciate a good laugh and a few plucks on the heartstrings, this is a show you really shouldn't pass up.",1335225600,3,738,4.419117647058823
