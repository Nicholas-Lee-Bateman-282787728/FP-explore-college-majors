5090528,3,B007J3ISKK,I was a little disappointed that this video only has two episodes.  The other Dino Dan have several episodes on each.,1342569600,11,117,4.571428571428571

5090535,5,B007J3ISKK,Who you gonna call!?! DINO BUSTERS! The only bad about this is that my two year old won't stop watching it.,1477180800,,107,4.142857142857143
5090536,5,B007J3ISKK,"My son loves Dino Dan.  He would binge watch it every day, if we would let him. It's a cute, fun show and lays out science experiments so the children can see how hypotheses lead to experiments which provide answers.  And there are dinos to boot!",1474329600,,246,4.326086956521739

5090539,5,B007J3ISKK,"I bought this for my 4 year grandson.  He has now watched it many times, and dances and sing to Dino Busters.  It is well worth the price.
I intend to buy more Dino Dan DVD;s",1471564800,,174,3.8055555555555554
5090540,5,B007J3ISKK,"My kids have enjoyed Dino Dan shows in the past.  They are currently ages 6 and 9, and admittedly, Dino Dan is probably a little young for them.  My son was terrified of dinosaurs when he was younger so we avoided the show, but as he was able to distinguish real from fake (or extinct) things, etc he started to like them.  So, we have watched a few.  I enjoy this show because its kind of old school...its not as current or modern as many shows out there.  I guess I am ""old school"".  The actors do a good job and don;t come off as cheesy as some kids characters.  Trek is Dan's younger brother and he encounters dinosaurs just like his older brother.  This show runs for approx. 90 minutes and is based on Trek.  He has many adventures.  My kids know the theme of the Ghostbusters movie but have never seen it.  I liked hearing the movie and seeing the references :)  Totally old school!  So, this is a fun take on an old classic in a family friendly, dinosaur seeking, educational and cute show.  I recommend this show for young kids, who will enjoy learning about dinosaurs.  I received this DVD for free for the purpose of my review through NCircle Nsiders but all opinions are my own,",1470873600,,1190,4.321266968325792
5090541,5,B007J3ISKK,My 3 year old grandson loves Dino Dan!,1470873600,,38,3.875
5090542,5,B007J3ISKK,"As always with the Dino Dan dvds, this was another great one . My 4 year old loved it and asked to watch it again after it was over. Trek tells his friends the story of a haunted house, which turns out to not have ghosts but instead has dinosaurs!",1470614400,,247,3.96
5090543,4,B007J3ISKK,"Trek's newest adventure was a hit in my house! The new release in the Dino Dan series titled Dino Busters was especially entertaining for my three boys. In the episode named after the title, Trek and his friends are called into a mansion to attempt to eradicate it of it's dinosaur infestation. Parents will be taken back in time when the original Ghostbuster theme song melody plays with its newly adapted lyrics. The DVD boasts six more episodes including Show & Dino, Paws & Claws, Survival of the Biggest, Dino Rocks, Flashy Dinos and Carnivore Contest. As is typical of the releases in this series, this DVD has a running time of around 90 minutes. My kids were excited to dig into this DVD and watched it twice within the first week we had it. It would make a great addition to any dinosaur fan's video collection!

5090548,5,B007J3ISKK,"This is a 45 minute DVD that keeps the interest level of kids very high throughout the video - they love it! The show is perfect for little kids who are starting to be interested in dinosaurs and this DVD does an excellent job at teaching while being very fun to watch - there is suspense, some thrills (kid appropriate), and makes kids think. I would suggest this DVD for kids three to seven or so - ideal sweet spot.",1455667200,,418,4.2375

5090574,4,B007J3ISKK,"My budding paleontologist not only loves Dino Dan, but she hopes to marry him one day. Needless to say, this DVD was a hit. Our schedule conflicted with the standard air time on cable and she was sad to miss her favorite dinosaur program. I poked around the web to find a few good DVDs and found the episodes (2) to be reasonable and the price was a decent value.",1404345600,,363,4.2

5090576,4,B007J3ISKK,"My boys love dinosaurs and they love Dino Dan, it is informative and engaging for children however, there are only two 15 minute episodes on this DVD. 30 minutes is fine while I'm making dinner or something but I sure get tired of the same two episodes over and over and eventually the boys stopped asking for it because they wanted to see other episodes.",1381708800,2,355,4.476923076923077
5090577,5,B007J3ISKK,"These books were for our dinosaur crazed nephew, after buying dvd's like this, he is a little ""expert"", well done and  easy enough for the younger set to understand.",1379548800,,165,4.689655172413793
5090578,4,B007J3ISKK,"My kids love Dino Dan. Videos are educational and entertaining. I think they are cheesy, but you don't have to worry about inappropriate dialogue, situations, etc like with some videos marketed toward children.",1378512000,,210,5.393939393939394
5090589,5,B007J3ISKK,I have a 2 year old and a 4 year old. They both love this show. It's calm and educational unlike other dinosaur shows that are scary. It's about a boy named Dan who wants to be a paleontologist with he grows up. He sees dinosaurs as he studies them but no one else can see them. It's a very cute show and they discuss everything from dinosaur's diet and type of habitat to their feathers/scales. It's one of the few shows I allow my boys to watch. I love that its interesting enough to keep their attention but doesn't show dinosaurs as scary or fierce creatures.,1374796800,,563,4.271028037383178
5090590,5,B007J3ISKK,"You've made my Nephew ESTATIC with this as a gift. He had to call me to tell me how much He LOVED Dino Dan, then my sister got on to tell me how much she liked it as well.",1372982400,,171,3.41025641025641
5090591,5,B007J3ISKK,please read my other reviews on these dvds  im very strict on what they watch  these are great and educational at the same time,1369612800,,127,4.25
5090592,1,B007J3ISKK,But I don't care to much for Dino Dans out take on dinosaurs. Its like when scientist tried to make Pluto not a planet. I don't want to hear things my whole life and have some kid tell me otherwise.,1369180800,,198,3.975
5090593,5,B007J3ISKK,I got this for my 2 year son who lovvvvvesss Dino Dan. It came very fast and he watches it over and over again. I will have to purchase more episodes for him.,1367798400,,158,3.8181818181818183
5090594,4,B007J3ISKK,yes my son is obsessed with dino dan... this dvd can very quickly and we are happy with it.  The only down fall is that it's only two shows... so pretty much what you'd see on TV.  Wish there were more episodes for the price.,1362441600,,225,3.977777777777778

5090615,4,B007J3ISKK,"Both my son (18.5 months old) and daughter (age 4) really enjoy watching the Dino Dan adventures! I feel that this DVD is super kid friendly and that even though there are sometimes some suspenseful and exciting moments, they are totally kid friendly keeping any type of scariness at bay! Since my daughter has seen the Dino Dan DVD, she's gained an interest in learning more and about dinosaurs! I love when either of children want to learn more about and ask questions about something new!",1345507200,3,491,4.72093023255814

5090617,5,B007J3ISKK,"Unfortunately I didn't bought it through Amazon, but I got it today at a local Store for $4.99. My granddaughter loves this show ever since she watched it for the first time back in 2010 when she was around 10 months old. She loves Dan, the dinosaurs and has learned a lot with the show, at only 28 months she can identify every single dino on the show by name. It has developed her interest in dinosaurs, which is weird given the fact that she's a girl; but who cares, it makes her happy just to sit down and watch it every day. Before I bought the DVD, I had to record the entire season on my DVR. The show is very kid, friendly, the perspective on the dinosaurs is different, the CGI's are great. It's is a show for kids, not violent and very imaginative, which makes me mad when I see horrible reviews saying that Dan has mental issues. As an adult, when you watch a TV show that is directed towards kids, you have to put yourselves at a kids level to actually enjoy it. Don't be judgmental and you can actually learn a lot of something you might not know. It took me maybe 5 episodes to quite understand the whole deal, but when I saw that our toddler was enjoying it without being scared and learning form it. I sat down and learned to love the show!!! To be honest, it took me longer than my grandbaby to learn how to say ""Euplocephalus"" than it took her. If you are a Dino lover then this is the show for you.",1343952000,8,1417,4.156363636363636
5090618,5,B007J3ISKK,"I didn't buy this video from Amazon, I found it at our local media store for $4.99. My 4 year old son immediately went crazy over it because it had a kid on the cover with a T-Rex. He's a big fan of Nigel Marvin already, but to see a child in a show about dinosaurs? He was so excited. The show is perfect for him - it's full of computer-animated dinosaurs that interact with Dan and simple dinosaur facts. The storylines are easy to follow and the scenarios are things a little boy like my son dreams of (sleeping in a dinosaur museum, teaching dinosaurs to do things, etc). The animation isn't extremely realistic, but it's good enough. My only complaint is that it's a continuous play dvd, so if I'm not paying attention it'll just start over again (and of course my son doesn't bring it to my attention), so even though we've only had it for a couple of days he's already watched it 7 times. He would watch it all day if I let him - he really loves this show! Definitely recommended for dino-lovers in the preschool age group.",1342656000,,1030,4.314432989690721
