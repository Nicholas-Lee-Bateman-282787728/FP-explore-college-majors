8636972,1,B00HWOFCY6,"One star is being much too generous for this 'movie', I guess you can't put down 0, the girl in the erotic pose on the cover is nowhere to be found on the DVD, except on the top cover of the disk, in fact the only naked butt you'll see is on a few of the male 'stars'. There is nothing really erotic about this movie, unless you think 2  minutes of quick obscure shots of female breasts, this is surely a deceptive marketing gimmick to sell a western that could be included in a cheap 10 western pack in the $5 Walmart bins",1404432000,11,523,4.028846153846154
8636973,1,B00HWOFCY6,"I would recommend anyone saving their money on this one ... terrible story, I guess that was expected, but the quality of the film was virtually unwatchable, green stripes and stars down the sides and a very blurry image throughout, definitely save your money with this one don't buy it!!",1398470400,15,288,4.78
