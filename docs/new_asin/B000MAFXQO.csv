2727793,5,B000MAFXQO,Everyone should watch this movie at least once. I don't even have the words to express how much this film touched me.,1212278400,4,117,4.363636363636363
2727794,5,B000MAFXQO,"Forgiving Dr. Mengele tells the exceptional story of a Holocaust survivor named Eva Kor who shocks many other Holocaust survivors--and others--when she declares that she forgives the Nazis for their actions during World War II. In particular, Eva forgives a Dr. Mengele who was performing horrible ""experiments"" on identical twins; Eva and her sister Miriam were subjected to these tests.

The film allows us to understand why Eva has chosen to forgive Nazis and Dr. Mengele in particular: she wants freedom from her emotional pain and scars by forgiving them. She does not forget; but she does forgive. That's pretty amazing.

Of course, we also see Eva try to explain her position to other Holocaust survivors. Predictably, most are not interested in forgiving the Nazis--and that certainly includes Dr. Mengele. There is one heated exchange between Eva and another Holocaust survivor at Israel's Holocaust museum that will make quite an impression upon you.

Another remarkable segment of this film is the time we accompany Eva as she goes to meet a former Nazi doctor--the only one acquitted after the war ended. We se the doctor express great remorse and he treats Eva like a lady. Eventually the doctor goes with Eva and other Holocaust survivors of Dr. Mengele's ""experiments"" on twins to participate in a healing memorial ceremony on the grounds of Auschwitz in Poland.

Look also for the rather human way that we find out Eva isn't exactly perfect: when she meets with Palestinians Eva becomes much more reticent to feel anything like remorse for the conflicts in the Israeli occupied territories. When her own Holocaust museum burns to the ground by arson, Eva once again admits that she will have ""to work on forgiveness.""

The DVD comes with a few extras; there's a printed brief interview with the director and there are printed web links to websites connected with this film.

Overall, Forgiving Dr. Mengele gives us a noteworthy and intimate look at a woman who chooses to follow an idealistic path to self-healing after the horrors of the Holocaust. She makes a controversial decision to forgive the Nazis; and we see Eva teach young people why she forgave them even as we see people challenge Eva for forgiving the Germans.

I highly recommend this film for students of World War II; and people who want to see a person successfully reach a rather lofty goal of forgiving brutal enemies and murderers will be riveted to their seats as they watch this film.",1195516800,6,2473,4.944578313253012
2727795,5,B000MAFXQO,"Could you forgive Dr. Mengele, the Nazi ""angel of death?"" That was not a theoretical question for Eva Kor. She and her twin sister Miriam spent 10 months in Auschwitz and, along with many other twins, were separated from their families and subjected to Mengele's horrific experiments. After liberation by the Soviets as a ten-year old, then ten years in Israel, she relocated to Terre Haute, Indiana in 1960, where she raised a family. She returned to Auschwitz for the first time in 1984, and then again for the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the camps in 1995. On that occasion she did the unthinkable: she read aloud her personal ""official declaration of amnesty"" to Mengele and the Nazis. To be liberated from the Nazis was not enough, she said; she needed to be released from the pain of the past. To extend forgiveness, she says, without any prerequisites required of the perpetrators, was an ""act of self-healing."" Others in the Jewish community were outraged that she dared to do this. Most interesting of all, Kor was clearly uncomfortable with extending forgiveness to or empathizing with the Palestinians when she traveled there. Still, this is a remarkable exploration what she calls ""the feeling of complete freedom from pain"" though the act of ""forgiving your worst enemy.""",1184371200,,1294,4.967741935483871
2727796,5,B000MAFXQO,"Eva Mozes Kor was 10 years old when she and her twin sister Miriam and the rest of her family were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland.  Soon after arriving, the twin sisters were separated from their other family members and were then subjected to sinister medical experiments performed by Nazi doctors.  The chief perpetrator of these horrific events was the ruthless and cruel Nazi SS officer and doctor Josef Mengele also known as the `Angel of Death'.  Upon being liberated from the camp in 1945, Eva and her sister Miriam were the only surviving members of their entire family.

The premise of this documentary focuses on the power of forgiveness and its ability to heal even the most painful of wounds and memories.  Eva Kor did what some might see as the unthinkable for most people.  Astonishingly, she actually forgave Dr. Mengele and the Nazi's for what they did in the concentration camp.  Other surviving twins from Auschwitz (who were also victims of Dr. Mengele) express their views here and they don't have the same capacity to forgive these heinous acts.

For several years, Eva Kor traveled around the world and lectured in several places defending her reasons for forgiveness.  Whether it was in Germany, Israel, England, or the United States (she currently lives in Terra Haute, Indiana), she met with considerable resistance and opposition to her views.  Knowing what happened in Germany and other countries during the Holocaust, this would be an understandable emotional response for many people.

I can't even begin to imagine the pain and suffering that Eva Kor has gone through and I honestly don't know if I'd be able to forgive in the same circumstances.  What I can do is greatly admire her courage to come forward with these views and I respect her desire to heal herself and live a better life.  There is no doubt that Eva Kor is a special person with a kind heart.

`Forgiving Dr. Mengele' is a sincere and affecting documentary and it is well produced in my opinion.  The message contained within is an emotional one and the images in this program will stay with you long after you've seen them.  This is recommended viewing for everyone.",1179878400,35,2181,4.8382749326145555
2727797,4,B000MAFXQO,"Forgiving Dr. Mengele tells the story of Eva Mozes Kor. As one of two twin girls taken to Auschwitz, she refused to die from the diabolical Josef Mengele's experiments. Her death in the camp from an unknown bacterial cocktail would have meant the end of her use as a guinea pig; her uninfected sister then would have been murdered with a poisonous shot to the heart so the Nazi doctors could cut the two open and compare notes. This proud, unapologetic woman says she came to the camp refusing to die, bitterly cursing the children who had before she arrived.

Now a real estate agent in the United States, Kor goes on a personal mission to Germany to meet a Nazi doctor at Auschwitz found innocent of war-crime charges because he didn't commit any atrocities in the evil hospital. Documentarians Bob Hercules and Cheri Pugh capture Kor as she argues with other survivors who say forgiveness is impossible. Kor won't listen. She opens a Holocaust museum in Terra Haute, Indiana, and tours the world to prove that she can forgive, but never forget.

Forgiving Dr. Mengele is the surprising tale of a victim who chooses to forgive rather than live her life in pain any longer. It is personal and fascinating, letting Eva's personality unfold in all her strength and weakness.",1177200000,14,1273,4.755656108597285
2727798,5,B000MAFXQO,"I can't begin to express the great need for the whole world to see this Documentary about a Jewish woman who not only survived the horrible depraved experiments of the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, but came to a place in heart to forgive him and other Nazis. A person like this rarely comes along in a world filled with great hate and unforgiveness. This is a true story of one such woman, who came to discover that the only way to be freed from her burdening experiences of the holocaust was through forgiveness. She takes you through her long journey from Mengele's depraved experiments on her and her dear sister Miriam to her crusade to tell the world what deep healing can be found through forgiveness. Having come from a Jewish background myself, I often pondered the question of forgivenes towards Germans. I clearly believe Mrs. Kor is right! I can only say, that she is a very special woman who I respect and admire very much. Regardless whether you will agree with her or not, she must be heard! So yes! I can't encourage you enough to go out and get this wonderful DVD about a most courageous woman. To her husband and two children, you have been blest to have such a wife and mom.",1177027200,4,1189,4.483870967741935
2727799,5,B000MAFXQO,"I saw the 60-minute version of ""Forgiving Dr. Mengele"" at its world premiere at the Florida Film Festival and found it memorable and moving.  The main theme of this documentary is the question of who benefits most from the act of forgiveness:  the criminal or the victim?  It's different from other Holocaust movies because the emphasis is on finding forgiveness rather than determining guilt or assigning punishment.

The film focuses on the story of Eva Mozes Kor (now in her 60s), one of the twin girls featured in a Holocaust photograph that intrigued co-producer Cheri Pugh.  The Kor girls, along with other twins imprisoned at Auschwitz, were human guinea pigs for medical experiments conducted by Nazi doctor Josef Mengele.  The crew follows Eva around the world for four and a half years as she initially tried to gain information about the earlier experiments conducted on her ailing sister in order to save her life.  After her sister's death, Kor changes her mission to spreading forgiveness.

She encounters much resistance in her travels to London, Israel, the West Bank, Auschwitz, Berlin, Chicago, and even in her home town of Terre Haute.  Few people embrace her philosophy and many are openly hostile and even violent towards her ideas.  Kor's forgiveness is what she needs to do to survive her horrible memories and accept her sister's lifetime of physical suffering.  She's not doing it for the benefit of the Nazis.

This is obviously not a one-size-fits-all solution to healing emotional wounds, and the majority of viewers probably won't agree with her.  The way that director Bob Hercules presents Eva's story, however, is touching, thought-provoking, and worthy of an audience.

2727800,5,B000MAFXQO,I considered Ms. Kor's memoir and apologia for her admirable attitude very enlightening as to what she'd been through and as to her thinking on her experience.,1394409600,,159,4.925925925925926
2727801,5,B000MAFXQO,"I stand in Awe of what Eva Mozes Kor has to say to all of us. It felt as though she was speaking directly to me, to my soul.

I have lived a life filled with anguish and rage.  The people who gave birth to me should have raised snakes and not a child.  From physical and sexual abuse to emotional abandonment.

After watching this documentary, I realized what I think Eva was trying to say, and that is to forgive in order to live.  Forgive because you are alive and can be free of the past, not forgetting it for a moment, but allowing it its place in your life.

There is nothing I can ever watch that will move me more than this.  If Eva Kor can forgive, then I can forgive.  And in my forgiving, I can find some peace.

This woman deserves the Nobel prize and more.  History will remember her as the one who never forgot, but the one who remembered and lived anyway.",1389830400,2,870,4.094674556213017
2727802,4,B000MAFXQO,"This concentration camp survivor went through brutal experiments that made her sick and caused her twin sister's kidneys to stop growing.  Their parents and 3 other sisters had been gassed the first day.  She seems to feel it is her purpose to give public speeches that the holocaust was just as horrible as the history books say and that forgiving the nazis has profoundly healed her pain.  Other survivors openly express shock, confusion, skepticism, or even outrage that she would say this.",1380758400,,493,4.987804878048781
2727803,5,B000MAFXQO,"A special thanks to Eva Kor for sharing her experience, strengths, and hopes.  I had the opportunity to meet Eva this past June when she provided a well-organized tour of Birkenau-Auschwitz for 80+ people.  Her thoughts on ""forgive, but never forget"" are an inspiration to current and future generations.",1378425600,,304,5.183673469387755
2727804,3,B000MAFXQO,"Eva Mozes Kor was one of the identical twins who were used as guinea pigs by Dr. Mengele at Auschwitz. She tells the story of her experiences and those of her sister, including the fact that the rest of their family were murdered, and that her sister eventually died of kidney failure due to the poison she was given by Mengele. So it may seem a little strange for Eva to decide she needed to forgive not only Dr. Death, but all the Nazis, and indeed all Germans.

Her argument is that forgiveness lifted a large burden from her heart, and I have to respect that. But I side with those survivors and others who argue that forgiveness must be tied to atonement. She has not asked for apologies, but oddly enough she has gotten some.

Toward the end of the film, she goes to the West Bank to meet with Israeli and Palestinian peace activists, and has a great deal of trouble with it. Here she is on the other end, with people who want to tell their stories of pain. They are not eager to forgive Israel for their pain. Frankly, Eva came off as rather impatient and unsympathetic.

Eva also created a Candle Holocaust Museum in Terra Haute, Indiana, where she lived. Students toured it, and asked her questions, and it was very important to her. So she was also not in a forgiving mood when someone burned it down. I noticed the commentary did not mentioned the clearly visible spray-painted message ""Remember Timmy McVeigh"" on the outside. I'm not quite sure what that's all about. But Eva built an all-new museum which was open not long after. The post-script points out that the arsonist was never found.",1336694400,4,1604,4.505154639175258
2727805,5,B000MAFXQO,"I am shocked by the few negative reviews of this documentary and even more so by the many ambivalent reviews of it!  This documentary must receive a five star review.  To personally forgive people and groups who have harmed you heals one personally, but more importantly, promotes a culture of forgiveness that helps heal the entire world.  Although I have not known horror as Ms. Kor has done, I also have experienced the sweet saving grace of forgiveness in my life, and experienced its blessed benefits.  This documentary is a 100 percent success, and Ms. Kor's work is completely on the side of the angels.  I encourage everyone imprisoned by bitterness to see this documentary and find the joy and hope of forgiveness that Ms. Kor has found.",1335139200,,746,4.796875
2727806,3,B000MAFXQO,"This is a very moving documentary detailing Eva Mozes Kor and her experiences at Auschwitz death camp. As a twin at Auschwitz, her and other twins like her, were the subject of heinous experiments by Dr Joseph Mengele. Mengele was an camp SS physician, whom was obsessed with genetic experimentation on twins.. This is a story of personal triumph in the face of death so that Eva and her twin sister would be reunited and also survive..

This will take you on a guided tour of that triumph and the will to survive in a place that death was the commonplace and it was in the millions(though exact numbers are not known).. You will see Auschwitz itself along with many surviving twins from the horrible experiments that will share their opinions on Eva's notion of forgiving the Nazis..

I gave this a 3 because of the controversial nature of this documentary which was in fact so controversial that the United Nations cancelled the screening of it. This documentary titled forgiving Dr Mengele is Forgiveness on a personal level alone, most of the interviewed survivors, in fact I think all were outraged by her presumption to forgive all nazis, on all crimes against humanity, to also on behalf of others both surviving and dead..

Now for the bad news(why this is a 3 not a 5). All survivors were against her in this notion to forgive the nazis, mostly because she was taking it upon herself to publicly forgive all crimes committed on her, others and on behalf of all the 6 million dead...She has isolated herself among other survivors because of this, with other survivors stating on the documentary ""She has no right to forgive on behalf of those that cannot forgive""..What I mean by cannot, is either they died in the holocaust (which survivors publicly said that nobody has the right to forgive on behalf of the dead,which out of respect is true) or those that cannot forgive because of how traumatic those events still are to those surviving today... Also, you see her adding some insult to injury upon other survivors by (without prior consultation among survivors)taking it upon herself to look up SS doctor Hans-Wilhelm Mnch. Mnch whom was a Nazi party member and SS physician at auschwitz, was interviewed and also invite to accompany her to the 50'th survivors anniversary at Auschwitz. He accepted her offer.. This I think was the major insult to survivors, they were outraged that a survivor would take an ss doctor reported to have done lethal injections on inmates, in the camp to a survivors anniversary...

Over this controversy I am forced to give this a 3, as this seems mostly one person taking it upon herself to forgive all nazi murderers for every survivor and victim alike...

Small note: Joseph Mengele was reported to have done genetic testing on twin children and people up until his
reported death in 1979 in south america..After watching this documentary I was compelled to disagree with her taking to the public on everyones behalf on forgiveness for a man that obviously continued his unethical experimentation till his death years after ww2..He was also in the practice of giving women illegal abortions till he was forced to flee again. He was also in personal contact with Adolf Eichmann and proceeded to flee again after his arrest..This man was not sorry for his crimes and obviously nor did he have a problem conducting illegal and experimental research on people well after the war",1328486400,2,3420,4.819420783645656
2727807,3,B000MAFXQO,"I don't think the ideas behind this film are bad, but I think they need to remain in context. Eva had to deal with this by finding a way to forgive, to carry on her life. Yet, she should not represent herself to be the opinion of all victims. The full length film (close to 120 minutes) clearly shows the objection of other survivors, who cannot forgive, which gives this film more authenticity.

Societies are constantly trying to spin history one way or another. Eva doesn't ask CRITICAL questions that should have been asked to the Palestinian's she met in this film. She never asked what THEIR opinions were of their life, their world, their leaders and their knowledge of recent world history. She never asked about what they honestly know about WWI or WWII. (For instance, what role did Hitler play - in their minds?) If anyone wants to discuss these issues, and come to some agreement - it would be important to FIRST establish common ground. Eva and the people who helped set up the meeting never discuss history and perception. In fact the person who suggested this to her comes off as a bit of a coward for sending this woman off into a very difficult situation.

Because history has a way to rewrite itself, I believe all people who watch this should also spend time reading and / or watching other historical documentaries. One famous book that adds a lot of value is ""While 6 Million Died"", by Arthur D Morse.
It would also be good background to watch this group of videos:

The First World War - The Complete Series
The Complete Story: World War I - Robert Ryan
The World at War
Russia's War: Blood Upon the Snow
Victory at Sea - The Legendary World War II Documentary
Man's Search for Meaning (Book by Viktor E Frankl) -First-hand account of being in the camps
Holocaust - Ravensbruck & Buchenwald
World War II - The Lost Color Archives
The 50 Years War - Israel & The Arabs

With this knowledge, can we truly understand the entire background of how the world found themselves in ANOTHER World War soon after WWI ended (called the War to End All Wars). Most important are the HISTORY lessons to understand as to why WWI happened, who was involved on either side, what the outcome was and how the outcome lead to WWII. How Germany and Japan played a role in WWII. I don't want to take away Eva's great impact on young people. But I believe that Eva doesn't see the impact of these WWI and WWII histories to the context of dealing with younger people, who probably have little no background on this, as well as the Palestinians she met with, who are simply NOT taught World History according to Western teaching standards.

After watching these above videos, you could also watch videos (or read well rated books) about those leaders who used genocide as a common domestic policy throughout history:
Japan's WWII soldiers in China
the Congo Genocide involving the Hutu,
Stalin's policies and actions while in power of the USSR (Who potentially killed upwards of 25 million of his own people!)
Chairman Mao Zedong (who potentially killed between 25 million and 70 million of his own people!)
Even the previous Syrian ruler Assad (the father of the current leader) was been accredited with killing an entire city of people in his own country in the 1980's (supposedly a faction of the Muslim Brotherhood) overnight - potentially killing 20,000 people without a trace of the city.

My hope in writing this review is that everyone take a closer look at history and the context of knowledge for each generation and each nationality. Germany, after WWII has gone out of their way to teach their children and every new generation about their role in the Holocaust. Yet this is never discussed in these films. Japan has been faulted in not teaching enough about their role in WWII to younger generations - see the paper titled ""The Textbook Controversies in Japan:What History is Taught?"" written by Aaron Cooley.",1301443200,3,3918,4.679245283018868
2727808,5,B000MAFXQO,"This was a remarkable documentary because what Eva Kor has done is remarkable- and yet, it is the the basic teaching of most religions. Eva had to be brave and strong to survive Auschwitz. But how much braver, I feel, she is in continuing to stand by her realization that forgiveness is the path to empowerment and healing- when faced with the anger of other survivors who feel that it is a betrayal to forgive what was done to them.
""Getting even has never healed anyone""
Yes, Eva is human, and her handling of the meeting with angry Palestinians does not go well. But that does not detract from the movie in anyway. Eva was willing to try, and that shows her spirit and her desire, and her humanness.
This movie is a must see for anyone who tries to walk a religious path.

2727809,1,B000MAFXQO,"""Forgiving Dr Mengele"" is an unnecessary long documentary about a Holocaust survivor's tragic experience under the hands of Dr Mengele in the Auschwitz concentration camp.  You will be filled with remorse until the moment she meets with Palestinians (unless you're prejudice towards Palestinians or ignorant about the Palestinian-Israeli issue).  While she was meeting with Palestinians who were telling their tragic stories under the Jewish immigrants (Israelis) rule after they took over Palestine, the Holocaust survivor's reaction and demeanor towards them was surprisingly cold, which was appalling considering that she was a victim of the Holocaust.  This documentary is a demonstration of how people can attempt to gain sympathy from others by telling their tragic stories of others oppressing them, yet have no sympathy when they are part of a group who is oppressing innocent people for their own personal gain. It shows that history won't teach some people a lesson.",1294185600,10,976,5.493333333333333
2727810,5,B000MAFXQO,"""Forgiveness is a seed for peace"" - Eva Kor

All our lives would be greater touched by Eva's message. I have met and interviewed her several times, and there isn't a time that went by that I am not enthralled by her ability of compassion and forgiveness. While many survivors do not see her idea of inner peace, through forgiveness and how most of us non-survivors cannot grasp is that it is about her self healing. Not to be haunted by her past anymore, and by forgiving those her trespassed against her, she can move on.

You will be empowered and strengthened by Eva's message, and it will leave you with more thoughts on how to better your own life and heart. Many people say, ""I wish I had an ounce of her strength"" and it is true...she is a light in which we can follow boldly.

If we could all forgive, we would be better healed.",1292630400,,836,4.312101910828026
2727811,4,B000MAFXQO,"Eva Kor is the reason to see this film. She is charming, heroic, and a model of strength, determination, and love in action. She and others like her are living proof that evil's victories are always temporary.

I was afraid to watch ""Forgiving Dr. Mengele."" Hitler was one of the most evil men who ever lived, but, as far as I know, Hitler didn't personally kill or torture anyone. Josef Mengele, on the other hand, used medical tools and procedures to torture innocent victims at Auschwitz. Mengele focused on children, and on twins. Mengele is the stuff of nightmares.

I hesitated before popping the DVD in the machine. In combat, Mengele won the Iron Cross for rescuing two German soldiers from a burning tank. Retired from the front and sent to be ""camp doctor"" at Auschwitz, he destroyed countless innocent lives. After the war, Mengele escaped, with the support of many German and South American friends, and died a free civilian's natural, comfortable death in 1979. I began thinking about what kind of hell would be appropriate for a Josef Mengele. I wondered what he thought about before he went to sleep at night.

Once the DVD began playing, I quickly realized that ""Forgiving Dr. Mengele"" isn't about Mengele at all. It's about Eva Kor, a delightful and inspirational human being. She's a real estate agent in Terre Haute, Indiana. Kor, a well-dressed senior citizen with a Mitteleuropa accent, is shown bustling about, hammering in lawn signs that advertise property for sale, guiding potential buyers, and making grilled cheese sandwiches for her two loving children and her husband in their modest suburban home. Kor is a woman of action, not reflection. In spite of her age, she moves like a bullet, directly toward her target. She acts, rather than sits and ponders. You know she loves her family because she feeds them. Her daughter describes Kor as ""unhesitant,"" and the viewer agrees. Kor is shown giving inspirational speeches to school children, and opening up her own, small, Holocaust memorial museum. Kor and her twin sister Miriam were survivors of Mengele's torture.

Kor met with a former Nazi doctor, Hans Munch. Munch had resisted Nazi commands to take part in selections that condemned prisoners to death. He also engaged in ruses to protect prisoners' lives; former prisoners testified to this after the war. Munch was acquitted of war crimes. In 1995, Kor and Munch together issued a statement condemning the Holocaust. Kor forgave Munch. Kor was asked if she could forgive Mengele. After much thought, she said she could. Kor was challenged and her stance was rejected by other survivors.

The film shows Eva Kor at home, in schools, and at her museum. It shows her meeting with Munch and speaking with him at Auschwitz. The film also shows other twin survivors saying that they can't forgive Mengele. Finally, there is a brief, awkward and out-of-place meeting between Eva Kor and Muslim Arabs, lead by Sami Adwan. Kor appears to be the only Jew at the meeting. She is confronted by several Arabs who, while glaring at Kor with undisguised hate, proceed to tell her that Jews are responsible for all the problems in their lives, and that Jews never lived in Israel before 1945. They're wrong on all counts - they get both their facts wrong and their approach. It is simply distasteful to recruit an elderly, female, Holocaust survivor, get her alone in a room, and harangue her with blatant anti-Semitism. The film doesn't comment on this encounter. No conclusion is reached. One wonders why it was included.

There are a few things I wish the film had done differently. I would have liked more background on Kor's biography. What was life like after she left the camp and returned to Romania? How did she travel to Israel, and then the US? Most importantly, I never understood Kor's definition of the word ""forgiveness."" What does it mean to forgive? What does it mean to forgive Mengele? If he were alive today, would Kor hope for legal proceedings against him? Is Kor's insistence on forgiveness rooted in any religious belief? The film records the destruction, by fire, of Kor's Terre Haute Holocaust Memorial Museum. No one has been caught - but are there no clues the filmmaker's can bring to the viewers' attention?

My reservations are small. ""Forgiving Dr. Mengele"" is a moving, engaging, and inspirational film. Eva Kor's abundant life and her insistence on love make it so.",1290124800,3,4420,4.893190921228304
2727812,1,B000MAFXQO,"I guess I am writing the only negative review here, but I wasn't alone over at Netflix. This film really disturbs me. Not because Eva chose to forgive the Nazi's who probably do not deserve it, to each his own, good for her. It disturbs me because the tone of the film is that somehow she is better than others and it suggests, and so does she, that others should forgive the Nazi's for horrendous crimes against humanity. It is an irresponsible tribute to self proclaimed martyrdom which seems to put down everyone else. And then she rolls her eyes at the Palestinians???? Please. What a hypocrite. Eva, and the film makers, seem to forget, or never realize at all, that not only is trauma involved in what happened, but grief is also a huge part of what these survivors are dealing with. I resent the fact that anyone would ever put any kind of rules, timeline, or expectations on a grieving person. If she is able to forgive, that's just wonderful. But it is plain wrong to put that kind of burden, that kind of expectation, on another human being. Others are not less than, weak, or inferior human beings if they don't have it within themselves to forgive the Nazi's, or anyone else for that matter. Forgiveness is a personal choice. Personally, I don't know how you forgive someone who isn't asking to be forgiven, never apologized, or never understood why their actions were wrong. And Eva is dead wrong. She says no good has ever come from getting even or seeking revenge. That's complete BS. We all fight to change things and make them better, sometimes in the name of others who have been harmed. I will never forgive those responsible for my daughter's death and I will fight for revenge and to get even until the day I die. And because of that, good things have happened and will continue to happen for others. Eva's view is so limited and naive and for others to praise it is completely undeserved. Forgiveness is a wonderful thing when someone is ready, willing, and able. It isn't necessarily a flaw when someone is not ready, willing, or able.

2727813,5,B000MAFXQO,"What an incredible and a thought-provoking documentary. It really begs the question of what forgiveness really means. A definite must see for anyone familiar with the Holocaust and the role Dr. Mengele played at Auschwitz concentration camp.
This documentary deals with some of the surviving twins that served as experimental guinea pigs for the infamous Dr. Mengele who meet once again nearly 50 years later to discuss what his atrocities did to their lives even after leaving Auschwitz.  It is a heartbreaking story but one that needed to be told.  The idea and the concept of forgiveness is different for everyone and as one of the survivors pointed out, she didn't feel one could find forgiveness while still in the midst of fighting for one's life.  But for many of the survivors, even fifty years after the liberation of the camp, there is still no room for forgiveness in their heart.  A very informative and heartbreaking story that is now a part of recorded history for future generations to have as reference.",1281830400,2,1019,4.906976744186046
2727814,5,B000MAFXQO,Excellent!  Excellent message and the fact that she had the audacity to stand against many that felt she had no right to forgive makes her phenomnal.  Forgiving is not forgetting.,1277683200,,179,4.933333333333334
2727815,5,B000MAFXQO,"This is an incredible story. I would never tell anyone who had been a victim of violence that they ""should"" forgive the perpetrator. However, for Eva Mozes Kor forgiving Mengele, and all the Nazis, was a powerful, positive emotional experience and she encouraged others to consider it as a way to move beyond the emotional trauma they carried after leaving the concentration camps.

Eva and her twin sister were victims of Dr. Mengele' medical ""experiments"" at Auschwitz.  Eva nearly died in the camp as a result, and when she was very ill she willed herself to survive because she knew that if she died Mengele would kill her twin sister, then conduct an autopsy on both girls' bodies.  She refused to give him that opportunity.  After Auschwitz she married another concentration camp survivor, moved to the U.S., had children and became a realtor as well as an activist.

There is much to admire in Eva Mozes Kor, whether you agree with her public statement of forgiveness of the Nazis or not.  Her determination to survive in order to save her sister, and then her determination to build a new life after being freed from the camp - moving first to Israel, then marrying, then moving to the U.S. and beginning a career.  She became a community activist speaking to students about her experiences at Auschwitz and she set up a Holocaust Museum in her home town of Terre Haute, Indiana.  After arsonists destroyed it she raised enough money to rebuild it.  When her twin sister was ill she donated one of her kidneys to her sister.  Kor is a fighter, and it has led to her having a long and productive life, despite the horror she endured as a child in Auschwitz.

However, the film includes several clips showing Kor talking with other holocaust survivers, and Jews who were not in camps, about the issue of forgiveness. Some became quite angry with Kor's public statement of forgiveness. One woman's perspective was that she feared forgiveness would lead to the world forgetting what had been done to the Jews in the Holocaust. Another person argued with Kor that forgiveness is only deserved when the person to be forgiven has shown remorse and taken a significant action to atone.  Kor replied that with the work she and others have done, the holocaust will never be forgotten, and that the issue (for her)of forgiveness was NOT one of whether the Nazis deserved it or whether their victims have a moral obligation to provide forgiveness. For Kor, forgiveness is an action taken willingly to lessen the power of the trauma she endured - the only way for her to move beyond the tragedy with any sort of peace.  She saw this as giving her power.

I highly recommend that parents watch this movie with their children when they are teenagers.  Learning of the Holocaust in school is one thing, hearing the story from a survivor is a very different experience and one everyone should experience. It is also a great foundation for a discussion about the moral complexities of the concept of forgiveness.",1275264000,2,3002,4.757225433526012
2727816,5,B000MAFXQO,"Eva Kor gives a powerfully moving account of her internment at Auschwitz and the medical experiments performed on her and the other Jewish twins by the Angel of Death, Dr. Mangele. How does one truly survive such horrific circumstances? Eva tells of her transformational journey into forgiveness that brought her from merely surviving to living once again. She wrestles with the notion that forgiving is forgetting what had been perpetrated. Though we must never forget these atrocities so that they never happen again, forgiveness is the only way to take victory over the Nazi monsters' attempt at extermination. A must see for young and old alike.",1267660800,,649,5.132075471698113
2727817,4,B000MAFXQO,"This documentary is different from most holocaust remembrance movies because the main character here is a survivor, not a victim.  This is an important distinction that is brought up throughout the movie.  It is also what makes this tale interesting, different, and hopeful.

This movie is about a feisty Jewish woman who never gave in or gave up during her stay at Auschwitz. She came to America and fought just as hard to secure her real estate profession, create a Holocaust museum in Indiana, and stay current with Israel.

She also did something profound.  On a personal level, she publicly forgave the German doctors who experimented on her, her sister, and the other twins at Auschwitz.  And this is where the story really takes off.  Guess who gets most upset with this statement of forgiveness: The other holocaust survivors.  It is this clash of survivor/victim and hate/forgiveness that elevates this movie from a feel good theme (i.e. forgive and life is good), to a reality theme (i.e. you must live your beliefs every day).

She says that by forgiving, her hate is gone and she is empowered.  While she is no saint (she definitely has issues with the Palestinians), she is alive, strong, and pretty fearless.  She is a testament to what she preaches.  I was impressed.",1264377600,5,1282,4.857142857142857
2727818,5,B000MAFXQO,"For many of us, the virtuosity of forgiving is a given.  It's good to forgive, we say, and wicked to hold a grudge.  Curiously, however, it's not at all clear what it means to forgive, nor whether forgiveness is always virtuous.  Is forgiveness primarily directed at self-healing, letting-go of resentment and pain?  Is it primarily directed at offering the transgressor a fresh start?  Is it a mode of justice, or is it antithetical to justice?  Can one forgive if the transgressor doesn't express remorse?  Are some actions unforgiveable, such that forgiving them is morally wrong?  Can one forgive a dead transgressor?  Can one forgive on behalf of others?

""Forgiving Dr. Mengele"" invites us to reflect on these sorts of questions by focusing on the extraordinary life of Eva Kor.  Along with her twin sister, Eva was a human guinea pig in Dr. Mengele's notorious ""genetic experiments"" at Auschwitz.  (Eva's sister would eventually die from the after-effects of the experiments.)  Like all survivors of the death and concentration camps, Eva was incredibly scarred by her experiences.

Seeking documentation about the experiments she and her sister endured, Eva (who was then in late middle age) sought out and met with a Dr. Erich Munch, the only Auschwitz physician exonerated at war's end.  This personal encounter, in which a German expressed deep remorse over what Germans had done to Jews during the Third Reich, persuaded Eva that the ""enemy"" had a human face.  Moreover, she came to the conclusion that dealing with her own pain was her responsibility.  As she says, ""victims need to take responsibility for their own healing, just as perpetrators need to take responsibility for their crimes.""  So she publicly forgave the Nazis for the crimes they committed against her as a ""life-changing experience, to be free of the pain.""  ""Getting even,"" she asserted, ""has never healed a single person.""

This is an extraordinary enough story had the film ended here.  But what makes the film an excellent reflection on forgiveness is its honesty about the critical responses to Eva's forgiveness.  Other survivors who are interviewed insist that forgiving when it comes to Nazi atrocities is a denial of what happened; that it's a violation of justice; that it's a disguised form of forgetting, and thereby encouraging, atrocities; that only Nazis who atone, in deed as well as word, qualify for forgiveness; and that Eva has no right to forgive on behalf of other victims (this last is a misdirected criticism, since Eva is clear that she's forgiving only on her own behalf).

Moreover, the film makers point out that Eva has a great deal of resistance to forgiving Palestinian terrorists, thereby gesturing at the psychological complexities and blindspots that must be taken into consideration when examining forgiveness.
