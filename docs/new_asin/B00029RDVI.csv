8158974,5,B00029RDVI,"Classic British film from the war stories of British funny man, Spike Milligan. Wonderful story of England in the early days of WW2. Some parts funny, some downright sad, but a great document of ""how it was"" I think. Look for Arthur Lowe (Dad's Army, Bless Me, Father) and Geoffrey Hughes (""Onslow"" from Keeping Up Appearances) in very good roles. One I'll definitely share with my new garndson when he's old enough to watch films with grandpa.",1386547200,,444,4.779220779220779
