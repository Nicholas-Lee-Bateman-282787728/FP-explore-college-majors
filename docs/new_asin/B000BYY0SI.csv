8094547,4,B000BYY0SI,"A cop named Jake Walker (Blake Bahner) has just started in his new district. He's a friendly, helpful guy, who tries to give people a break. Meanwhile, one of his fellow officers, named Kilpatrick (Addison Randall), has taken over a rag-tag white supremacist group, and turned them into a well-tuned gang of killers. Soon, these thugs are terrorizing and murdering the minority community, including some folks that Jake has helped. Jake reads about this in the paper, at home, while his gorgeous wife does her exercises in her wonderfully sheer, frilly underwear! Jake's biggest problem seems to be that she's too much of a distraction! He does find a way to better manage his time, resulting in soft core love, complete w/ sultry cheeez-o-phone music! DEADLY BREED (1989) is about Jake's mission to stop these homicidal haters, and their piano-playing leader. AMAZING FACT #1- Apparently, as long as a cop gives a criminal a good talking to, he will change his ways instantly and lead a life without crime. AMAZING FACT #2- Classically-trained, pianist, Nazi cops only drink brandy between killings. AMAZING FACT #3- It's easy to get away w/ multiple murders, as long as you're under the leadership of an eeevil cop w/ a mustache. AMAZING FACT #4- The best way for the police to deal w/ a white supremacist group is w/ dynamite. Co-stars William Smith (INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS) as ""the Captain"". Be sure to stick around for the bible verse at the end...",1510531200,,1456,4.875
