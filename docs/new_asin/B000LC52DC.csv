2702426,4,B000LC52DC,"if you're a fan of zach galifianakis, then you know to expect his absurd one liners. if you haven't seen any live shows of his besides his comedy central special, then you may not be familiar with zach's hilarious habit of abandoning his routine and fully engaging the audience. both of these talents are on display in his first dvd. also are hilarious fake documentary footage of zach's ""twin"" brother seth. Those interviews and the behind the scenes footage are great, but sometimes can be jarring when inserted into the standup footage. that's why i gave this dvd 4 instead of 5 stars. it was done by the same people who made the comedians of comedy, which was awesome as well but suffered from the same problem. all in all though, the dvd is incredibly funny and definitely worth it if you're a fan of zach's. hopefully we'll get a zach stand-up cd soon also!",1176163200,,863,4.574193548387097
2702427,4,B000LC52DC,"Enjoyable set from Zach G. A bit self-indulgent and lazy, but hey - he'd be the first to admit to that! Funny pop culture writer. There's also an ongoing segment with his ""twin brother"" Seth, who seems to be channeling Christopher Guest.

Overall, 3 & 1/2 stars.",1175817600,,262,4.574468085106383
2702428,2,B000LC52DC,"I saw Zach's special on Comedy Central Presents a while back and thought he was genius.  I bought this DVD with high expectations, but they were definitely not met. It seemed to me like he barely told any jokes. He just spent 15 minutes making fun of someone in the audience. The interview with ""Seth"" is by far the best part.",1175644800,4,326,4.344262295081967
2702429,3,B000LC52DC,"If you are a Zach fan, then you will love this DVD.  If you are not and are simply looking for a stand up comedy DVD, then move along.  Zach is brilliant in that kind of way, that most people are turned off by it.  If you watched the movie Out Cold, and wanted more from him, this will probably not be the place to start.  Check out Comedians of Comedy that features Zach and he has the ability to play off of others really well.  Here, it is almost an artist with too much tools to play with and not enough direction.  Featuring lots of ""characters"", including an interview with his ""twin"" brother Seth Galifinakis.",1174780800,3,616,4.267241379310345
2702430,5,B000LC52DC,"Great comedian, Great performance and presentation almost like a movie at times. Love his alter-ego fake brother Seth, he cracks me, my friends, interviewer Brian Unger and I'm sure the rest of the world CRACK THE HELL up.",1174176000,11,222,4.868421052631579
2702431,5,B000LC52DC,"This dvd is hiliarious, showing Zach doing what he does best, making us laugh.  Topics range from family, failed career, politics, etc.  The Seth Galiafinakis footage is also priceless.",1174003200,11,185,5.344827586206897
2702432,5,B000LC52DC,"This is an intimate look at the comedy of Zach at his rawest. A funny man being hilarious. Just plain perfect! Plus, Seth get a ton on-screen time. ""It's always Fugees and Funyuns.""",1173830400,4,181,4.515151515151516
2702433,5,B000LC52DC,"Slightly bitter, slightly depressed; but all in all, a great set from Zach. Some of the interstitial pieces don't work as well as you'd want, and he flubs a couple lines here and there, but either you love Zach's work or you don't.",1173484800,8,231,4.395348837209302

Also, randomly, but for whatever it's worth, I did not enjoy the Hangover or think that anyone was particularly funny in it, so you don't have be a Hangover bandwagon guy to dig this guy's stand-up. It's just friggin hilarious, and if you disagree you definitely hate America and don't support our troops.

Galifianakis does a kind of offbeat hipsterish thing, so he tends to polarize people. Either you think he's hilarious or you're wondering if he's for real. Or maybe both. If you're unsure where you'll fall, I suggest you find one of his SNL monologues, and if you like that, you'll like this (and the converse).",1437264000,,731,4.7109375

Usually its an indication of a bunch of poorly written music being passed off as comedy, but the piano was more of a backdrop for this performance. Zach used it as more of a transition element. The arrangement of this video was a little odd, but I could not stop laughing so I would say it was successful overall.",1437004800,,421,4.341772151898734

effeminate 'brother' really added that much.  Actually, Galifianakis kinda annoys me.  You ever get into a conversation with a guy who majored in Philosophy and after a few minutes it's clear they're trying to screw with your head?  They'll throw out some half baked idea and you answer them and then they just look at you and smile as if they believe they are holding the mysteries of the universe.  Whenever I run into those kinda of people, I think to myself 'eff this guy; he's stoned.'  And rude and I want to kick him in the dick.  All the while he's staring at you like the cat who ate the canary. So then you play along and say something like ""Everyone knows that the missing link is really psychedelic mushrooms."" or ""the people who missed the bus didn't realize they were already there... or did they?""

He has good stuff, and then his not so good moments like any other comedian, so it really comes down to what you're looking for.

I'm not sure if he was really hung over but I believe it and it adds to the humor. He plays the card of someone in pain to such hilarity and it seems so real and natural that you almost believe he's completely losing it. But then he snaps you back into his own inside joke.

2703820,5,B000LC52DC,"Unorthodox is the only way I can describe Zach Galifiankis' standup in his special Live at the Purple Onion. From his dry humor to the cut scenes of Galifiankis playing his own brother, his unique brand of comedy is sure to give you a good laugh with your buddies any night of the week.
Live at the Purple Onion was filmed in late 2005 and released in early 2007, before Galifiankakis had reached fame with his role in The Hangover films. The special was directed by Michael Blieden and shot in San Francisco. It features Brian Unger, who interviews Galifiankakis who is pretending to be his fictitious brother Seth.
Galifiankis saunters through his hour set at The Purple Onion in a drunken tirade of dry comedy and insults directed at the audience. This act could not work better for him. Imagine listening to the funniest guy in your group of friends tell jokes as you catch up over a drink at the bar and you will have Live at the Purple Onion. The special begins as Galifiankis sits down at a piano, playing decent, completely out of place lounge music and using self-deprecating humor for the audience's enjoyment.
I must warn you, if you do not enjoy raunchy comedy, this is not the show for you. In fact, that's really the resounding theme of the special. Galifiankis starts out with jokes about frequenting Chuck E. Cheese, and that's when he's sober. As the special progresses, he becomes more intoxicated, and that's how the special is meant to be viewed. Seriously, sit down with some friends, have a couple beers, and enjoy the ride.
It is nothing to be taken seriously. The show lacks any political or social commentary (except for a few jokes about the Bush administration) and is really just a lighthearted take on his own life. The special frequently cuts out to Galifiankis portraying his own fictional brother, Seth.
Seth, the effeminate, anal-retentive, social-conservative is being interviewed about his brother's life and ""success"" by Brian Unger, which adds to the already outlandish humor of Galifiankis. Even Unger can't keep his composure as ""Seth"" berates his brother for his ridiculousness. It's a satire within a satire, a joke on a joke. Nothing in this special is meant to be taken seriously. Galifianakis is the friend who branches out after a couple drinks at the bar. He's the guy everyone remembers cracking up the class in high school. He's not telling jokes. He's just there to have a good time. He concludes the spectacle with a boys' choir singing ""The Greatest Love of All"" and ripping off cue cards revealing numerous anecdotes about his social dysfunction.
The special even gives insight into Galifianakis' life away from the stage. He talks about mental illness, his family, and several other personal subjects. Basically, if you enjoy Zach Galifiankis or alternative comedy, this special has everything you need. My advice: get together with some friends, turn on the special, and reminisce about the good times. This is Galifiankis before he got big - it's him in his element. It's the closest you will get to seeing him as an ""I saw him when"" and it couldn't be a better time.
I highly recommend this special, especially to the college guys who have a free night. Galifianakis is a brilliant comedian, who, by isolating himself through his comedy and social awkwardness, invites the entire audience to join him for a laugh.",1379203200,,3369,4.84055459272097

I did not laugh even once.  I did not even smile once during the show.  How does he think he is funny by asking for someone to get him a beer while playing the piano?  He questioned this man in the front of the audience incessantly about why he was there and said how he was messing up his audience genre.  Of course he didn't use the word genre because I think he is not intelligent enough to even hold a normal conversation let alone sound intelligent! Also, what is the point of the guy interviewing his twin brother?

Anything for the art.  And that's how ""Purple Onion"" feels to me, more like performance art based on comedy than a concert video.  All the flubs and rambling and awkward moments during the live bits are part of the persona and universe Zach creates as part of his overall product.  I found all of it hilarious and charming.  In fact, it's the hardest I've laughed in years.  Tears in the eyes kind of laughter.  If you're tired of slick, polished comedians whose routines just blur into one joke after another by mid-show, this is a breath of fresh air.  The mockumentary interview segments with his fake twin brother add nice texture to the experience in my opinion, and are just as funny as the stage jokes.  Look, Zach's schtick is that he's a clumsy oaf of a comedian, barely a professional, just hanging in there.  He pulls that off masterfully.  Experience it as if you're watching a play rather than a concert and if you have a sense of humor somewhat outside the mainstream, you should enjoy this video.",1316649600,,1243,4.579185520361991

With that being said I was really disappointed by this feature. The laughs were few and far between and the awkward situational humor of his I so much enjoy fell flat and was far to awkward to even render it as funny. This has really been off-putting for me and has greatly lowered my own opinion of Zach G. Hopefully he gets his act together and comes out on top.

He spent a third of the video picking on one poor old guy which was amusing for a few minutes but became painful.  He spends a third of the time looking at the camera flashing goofy looks for his ""DVD"" or talking about the name of the DVD.  That only left the last third for comedy.

I know people know him as the idiot, but he can actually play a fairly wide range of characters. For a second I was all like, ""Wait, is this his actual brother?"" Maybe I'm just retarded. Ha. Nonetheless, it's hilarious. The only downside is at times it seems he just kind of improvises, and it's still pretty funny, but it gets kinda repetitive and dull after awhile. However, the funny parts are REAALLLY funny (which is most of it!). Plus you get to see his real side, which is still pretty funny. And it shows that he's kind of a normal person (kind of), which just shows how talented he really is. I mean, I legitimately believed he was a bipolar / unstable / schizophrenic drunk at times.

Zach turns in a nightclub performance filled with polite titters from the audience and not much from Zach. Even his trademarks explosive tirades against audience members, which usually punctuate his otherwise quiet, dry presence to great effect, are flat in this performance.

Some interludes of Zach and his entourage driving into town seem intended to convey the impression that Zach is an intelligent individual afflicted with some mental frailty, but these bits aren't funny -- and since his frailties are likely fictional, humor would have been the only reason to include them. Relatively more amusing are some interview bits with his ""twin brother"" Seth Galifanakis.

Altogether this is a slightly amusing video requiring great patience, and a willingness to get very little reward for exercising that patience. For better clips of Zach at his best, you know what url to go to.",1284508800,2,979,5.144654088050315

The fact that I couldn't even finish the DVD should tell you what I thought about it. He cracked a few jokes in the beginning which got my hopes up but over the 40 minutes that I could bare to watch they ended up being the only 2 jokes that I laughed at. For the majority of the time he is just talking to the crowd and not being very funny about it in my opinion. The rest of the time, they show pre-recorded skits where he is pretending to be his twin brother or with his group of friends and I felt that both of those were pointless and even more dull than his stand-up portion.

But he was really obnoxious in this video...  I didn't even watch the last ten minutes because I wasn't laughing at all.  He picked on one guy in the audience really hard the entire time who obviously didn't take it very well, and insulted the audience repeatedly to the point of being awkward.  And to be honest, even aside from that, his speech delivery was off and the jokes just weren't very funny.  Maybe the pressure is getting to him?  I just never had such a bad impression of him before, but this performance has almost completely ruined any draw I had to him and his work.  Not at all like what I've seen of him previously.

2704228,5,B000LC52DC,"Zach Galifianakis, in my opinion, may be the funniest person ever. You can see other actually funny comedians are influenced by him (ie Demetri Martin). The idea of making comedy an art is something I've thought of for so long. If you are picky about your comedy and love seeing something different and intelligent, Zach's your man...... or Seth.... you'll see",1245110400,3,360,4.918032786885246
2704229,3,B000LC52DC,"The type of standup Zach does here is uncommon but hardly unique or revolutionary.  Steven Wright and the late Mitch Hedburg both do this sort of comedy, and both do it better.  The gig looked painful and Zach appeared to bomb, more or less.

The DVD would probably have been awful if it had been an unedited recording of that gig, but the other stuff they spliced in does keep it watchable.  But there's nothing here that I would call hilarious.",1244937600,2,446,4.469135802469136
2704230,2,B000LC52DC,"I saw Zack Galifianakis on Comedy Central Presents and I thought he was hilarious.  He was also good in the movie ""Out Cold.""  So I expected this DVD to be really funny.  However, this material was no where near as good as the stuff from his half-hour Comedy Central special.  I think he may have been drunk during this routine.",1244851200,2,328,4.416666666666667
2704231,2,B000LC52DC,"so--apparently  if you like his comedy central special and not this it's b/c you're too stupid to get the subtle ""humour"" on display here. you don't get ""the real zach."" well, the real zach is just not as funny as the ""mainstream"" zach--i think this special showed a burned out man who had had little sleep and far too much to drink and forgot he had a dvd to film--yuck. i wasted ten dollars on this. but nice too know it's too ""highbrow"" for me, what  with the cruel mockery  of a paying audience member for being old and bald and the uproarious hilarity of inventing an effete rube  ""twin"" brother to ape on. haw haw.

there is one joke where he says he asked his costumer for an outfit that would highlight his alcoholism,and  i  happen to think that is what this dvd does. i enjoy this man's unique comedy so very much but this just wasn't very funny and goes nowhere, and worst of all is rather mean spirited, which i always appreciated the lack therein of such in zach's comedy.  i would say this is worth a rental but not a purchase. he seems touched by nihilism, extreme sorrow, and an oddly misplaced  anger and woebegone bitterness throughout this performance... but that might be ""your thing"" -if so,  do buy away, amazonians!",1230854400,7,1238,4.4622222222222225
2704232,5,B000LC52DC,"I will start this off by saying I love this DVD. I get Zack. His timing, his style of border-line losing-it delivery and the way he pretty much hates everything. A man I can easily relate to. If you have seen Zack live (I saw him once at Berklee in Boston) you'll love this. His comedy is very... odd... so I understand how it can be very iffy when it comes to Zack. You either love him or 'he is ok' or you hate him. So taste aside, this dvd is very well made. It never drags, except for that one part, but that's ok. It was funny. The Seth Galifianakis interview is hilarious though I hate Brian Unger... for personal reasons. I say buy this if you like Zack, if you don't like Zack, grow a sense of humor, and if you are on the fence about him, get it on netflix.",1230768000,2,766,4.0130718954248366

2704264,4,B000LC52DC,"I read a lot of reviews on here before I bought this DVD and it made me kind of nervous.  A good portion of the negative reviews (and even some positive reviews) said steer clear of this DVD if you liked the ""dumbed-down Comedy Central Zach"", but I didn't find this to be the case.  I couldn't stop laughing through most of the DVD, so much so that I had to rewind it a few times because I was missing a few one-liners.

My only complaint is that I could have used more stand up, but it in no way detracts from the DVD as a whole.  The extras were great (albeit short) and the cut scenes to random...Zachness...were all pretty hilarious.

Don't be frightened away by the ""It's not for you Comedy Central Zach fans, It's only for us uber intellectual and gritty college types"",  the sh** is funny.  It is however super inappropriate for certain age groups, so don't buy this for a family reunion or anything like that.  Buy this DVD now...and you might want to do a few prep-crunches to get your abs ready for the oncoming juggernaut of laughter.",1213574400,3,1045,4.350515463917525
2704265,2,B000LC52DC,"It shouldn't be called ""Live at the Purple Onion"" but more ""Semi-Live at the Purple Onion but More Fake Interviews with my 'Brother.'"" There's barely any stand-up in it. I love his comedy, he's one of my favourites, but this DVD isn't worth it.",1204848000,4,244,4.568181818181818
2704266,4,B000LC52DC,"Zach talked about this video on the Onion AV Club. He talked about how it was his intention for this to lack the gloss of the normal production. It shows at times and before understanding his intention can put you off.

It's very much Zach, so similar to his mantra, that he doesn't care what other people think is funny, only what makes him laugh.

I enjoyed it, the interview helped me see it in a different light as well.",1202860800,,424,4.2875
2704267,5,B000LC52DC,This Zach Galifianakis DVD is one of my all time Comedy favorites!  The first time I watched it I had to pause the DVD every 5 minutes to catch my breath 'cause I laughed so hard! I've watched it so many times since -  and it still has me laughing! He is so brilliant... there's no one like him for timing and delivery... and his acting is superb... just check out the interviews with his brother Seth! I've bought this DVD for gifts and everyone I've given it to adores him now... You can't go wrong... Zach will never let you down!,1199059200,,533,4.215686274509804
2704268,1,B000LC52DC,"I first saw Zach Galifianakis on Comedy Central Presents.  That was one of the best CC shows I've ever seen.  His jokes were funny, and the way he blended the piano into it was beautiful.  I bought this hoping to see more of that.  If you liked the Comedy Central show, skip this one and save your money.  You won't like it.

To say that this DVD does not match up to the CC performance is the understatement of the year.  There are a number of things which cause me to give it a ""Hate it"" rating (I would have given it zero stars if possible):

1.  It's not continuous stand-up.  There are bits of a stand-up routine with ""bonus"" materials mixed in.

2.  The stand-up routine just isn't funny.  I could count the number of times I laughed on two hands.  At 35 minutes into it, with 25 minutes remaining, I found myself hoping it would end quickly; that's how bad it was.

3.  The ""bonus"" materials aren't funny at all.  In fact, they're annoying.  Interviews with ""Seth"" and videos of them driving down the road; yeah, that's why I bought the ""Live at the Purple Onion"" DVD...

4.  A good part of the stand-up routine is simply him making fun of the audience.  And not in a good way (like when he said there was a hyena in the audience in the CC show), but in a ""move on, already, because this isn't funny"" kind of way.

All-in-all, this DVD just wasn't funny.  Maybe this is the normal Zach, and if so, I'll have to look elsewhere.  It certainly isn't the Zach that I saw on Comedy Central Presents.  In fact, I don't see how the two could be further apart.",1194048000,11,1559,4.238907849829351
2704269,5,B000LC52DC,"I really enjoyed this dvd.  It's not for everyone.  If you have a broad sense of humor you should enjoy it.  I've never seen this guy perform on stage before this, but I thought it was really funny.  Good stuff.",1190332800,3,211,4.2
2704270,5,B000LC52DC,"Zach Galifiankis is the truth.

His style of comedy isn't stand-up comedy, it's entertainment. Zach Galifiankis is one of very few comedians who can entertain you in ways funnier than 99% of the stand-behind-the-mic for 30 minutes on a Comedy Central special comedians. I'm not knocking those comics, some are very funny, but Zach's not a ""Hey, my girlfriend is so different from me because.."" kind of guy. He puts on a great show, and it's rare to find someone with the ability to take you on a ride like this because it's not the cookie-cutter comedy that TV networks throw sitcoms at.

His brother, Seth Galifiankis, is also hilarious here. Interview segments with NPR's Brian Unger (I know, what!?) are nothing less than brilliant, who else but Zach and Seth could pull the whole thing off? The outtakes and deleted scenes are a must, they're not just extra content to fill up the disc. Replay value on both the main feature and the extras is very high.

Buy two, because if you're like me, you'll immediately want to give this as a gift to let others experience it. For $12.99, you shouldn't think twice about buying this.

2704271,4,B000LC52DC,"The stand-up portion of this DVD was funny, I wouldn't quite rate it 5/5 partially because of a rather unsuspecting use of cursing in contrast with his Comedy Central Presents shows.  Still Zach is a very unique comedian that deserves some acclaim.  There were also other segments to this DVD that gave it almost a documentary feel, the interview with his twin brother Seth which was hilarious and the road adventures with his friend Joe was also great.  Overall I think this is a great product for somebody looking for a breath of fresh air in stand-up, as long as a little bit of cursing doesn't bother you.",1181260800,,609,4.62037037037037
