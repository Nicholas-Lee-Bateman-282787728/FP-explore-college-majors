8345495,5,B001V69LXY,"Violetta's pathetic attempts to rouse herself from her deathbed? My eyes stay dry. The wrenching end of Madama Butterfly? I utter a wistful sigh at best. Rodolfo is the last one to know Mimi is no more?  Tough luck, Rudi.  But I'll confess to you the second act of this virtually unknown opera by Kienzl had me bawling like a baby. Ill-fated love is one thing, but despair over a wasted life, time that you'll never get back, strikes at the very core at what it means to be both human and mortal.

The first act is a pretty standard love triangle melodrama (with an odd comic interlude where the chorus does a little bowling in between anti-semetic jibes directed at one hapless citizen).  The second act, however, takes place 30 years later where characters (not all) are reunited and face the consequences of their actions all those years ago. We get a melancholy aria sung by the mezzo looking back to her younger days. A supremely beautiful scene where the tenor teaches a group of children some of the beatitudes (I believe this part, ""Selig sind"" is often performed separately as a concert item in German speaking countries). Then a harrowing finale where a dying man begs to receive forgiveness from his brother. Then when those kids come out for a final refrain, I'm a blubbering mess.

Kienzl's music is heartfelt, easy on the ear, but dramatic when it needs to be (see the burning barn and the hospital scene). Think Humperdinck meets Eugen D'Albert for comparison.

The production is a fine one. Though the action is updated to what looks like the 1910/1940 periods, it doesn't do much damage (though it makes that bowling scene a lot more sinister) and the singers, especially Jurgen Muller in the title role, are first rate. Though the first act admittedly drags, the rewards come at the end. Don't deny yourself this discovery.",1387411200,3,1841,4.719626168224299
