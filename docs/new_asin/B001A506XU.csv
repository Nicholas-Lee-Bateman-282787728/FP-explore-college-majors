8276020,3,B001A506XU,This movie was okay. Not great. The story line didn't make since. The acting was bad too. But not entirely a waste of time. Parts of the movie had it's moments. Not a movie I'd watch more than once. Then I'd forget about it. I wish they'd make a movie based on the true story of Mary's death & stick to her ghost story. It in itself is a good story. would be creepy too. LOL,1447459200,,374,3.9342105263157894
8276021,1,B001A506XU,"If it wasn't for my mother having a small part in this movie, I would have never bought it. Even she agrees this movie is a scham. A lot of dead air at certain points throughout the movie, as if maybe they had forgotten their lines. Just another poor attempt to profit on an old legend.",1248739200,,286,4.125
8276022,2,B001A506XU,"Chicago may claim the story of Resurrection Mary as its own, but the ""ghost hitchhiker"" story is truly one of the most ubiquitous ghost story legends out there.  Knowing how familiar the legend is, I wondered how the writer and director would go about giving this film a unique distinguishing quality.  To my surprise, they did manage to give this film an identity of its own.  Unfortunately - and not so much to my surprise - the end result just isn't very good.  Unanswered questions, an unlikeable and unsympathetic main character, story elements that make no sense and, in one case in particular, seemingly have nothing whatsoever to do with any part of the story - these are not the attributes of a good film.  Don't count on the ending to make up for any of the film's problems, either, as Resurrection Mary goes out with the mildest of whimpers.

Even if you don't know the specific story upon which this film is based, you surely know the legend in one variant or another.  A lovely young woman in a white dress wanders along a dark and lonely road, a passing motorist picks her up, and she mysteriously disappears when the car reaches a local cemetery (where she presumably lies ever since the night she was killed on that very road).  That's the gist of the legend, but here we first spot Mary at a wedding reception in Chicago's Oh Henry Ballroom.  She catches the eye of Shawn (Jason Ryan Lovett), who pursues her - quite in vain - with little concern for his fiance.  Still, it's enough for Shawn to broach the idea of putting off the engagement.  Matters deteriorate further when he and Amy end up picking Mary up along the road and giving her a ride.  It's a recipe for disaster, one which leaves a guilt-stricken Sean fairly obsessed with Mary and determined to right the wrong that changed his life forever that night.

This Resurrection Mary is not just some old ghost that disappears from Sean's life forever.  She's not even a ghost in the true sense of the word - not so long as she does the work she has agreed to do for the devil himself.  There are a couple of mildly creepy scenes along the way, but all hopes for a satisfying horror experience are dashed by the time the film reaches the halfway mark.  The story itself isn't all that good and Sean is just insufferable as he goes about his search for the truth, but what bugs me the most are the story elements that are presented yet never explained.  Take, for instance, the whole deal with the coins - not explained.  There's one victim the ghost of Mary targets for having helped Sean - not only did I not see what she supposedly did, I can't for the life of me figure out how it would even be possible for her to have done it.  And what's with the German-speaking lady who makes a horrendous discovery at a strange house?  Maybe I missed something somewhere because this scene struck me as having no connection whatsoever to the rest of the movie.  It's like some practical joker snuck this inexplicable scene in under the director's nose.

Resurrection Mary did surpass my low expectations, and I have to give the filmmakers some credit for adding a few wrinkles to such a familiar ghost story, but I wouldn't go so far as to recommend this film to any of my fellow horror lovers.",1244592000,,3262,4.4932203389830505
8276023,4,B001A506XU,"I loved it.  Plain and simple.  No, this isn't a big production.  But good story and some strong acting carries the film.  I'm from Chicago, so I have an affinity for this tale.  They did it right.  Not a gory slasher, but a tense, thoughtful, thriller.  Couple of the smaller roles were inhabited by weak actors (background or one-liner characters) but not distracting enough to take me out of the story.  Main actor may have been a bit mopey.  But I think it worked.  Definite recommend.",1241049600,2,489,4.5813953488372094
8276024,1,B001A506XU,"I kept watching hoping it would turn the corner... what a disappointment.  Cheesy acting plus bad transitional filming make what could have been a good movie (I understand this is based on a true story/legend from the Chicago area) into a jumbled mess.  The lead actor is so unsympathetic that I found myself hoping either he would really do himself in or Mary would have her revenge.

Unless you're from Chicago and know the background of this story, you may enjoy it just for that reason.  Otherwise, I'd pass on this stinker.

Mary is coming after those who made this movie and she ISN'T happy!",1236643200,3,597,4.647619047619048
8276025,1,B001A506XU,"The ""Resurrection Mary"" ghost story is a great one, but this diluted and dull adaptation of it was so BORING!  Sometimes fans of horror will at least get a kick from how poorly made a film can be, and maybe there will be a scare or two along the way.  Alas, that is not the case with this one.  The script, the acting, the camera work were all dreadful.  Our ""hero"" doesn't seem bewitched; he's constipated.  His poor fiance Amy never should have hooked up with this loser in the first place.  The actress playing ""Mary"" was quite beautiful and did a good job with what was written for her.  I might even have laughed at some of the poor filmmaking if the entirety wasn't such dreck.  For example, the exterior of a car driving down a country road at night is shot in color.  Cut to the interior where a young couple are arguing.  The ""trees"" the viewer sees out the windows look like they were cut out of black construction paper by kindergarten students.  Joe Estevez's overacting was mildly amusing, but it wasn't clear whether or not his coughing was the character or if poor Joe actually has emphysema.  Please DO NOT waste your time or money on this one.",1235692800,,1160,4.419811320754717
8276026,5,B001A506XU,"I watched this movie last night:  it's great!  So great, I am going to order it today.  The fast pace and good acting made the 90 minutes whiz by.  I'm from Chicago's South Side, and like many children, was told the story of Resurrection Mary when I was just a child.  Once, my Mom and a friend were walking past Resurrection Cemetery on Archer Road at night when frightened by something/someone; and my Mom is not easily scared.  The use of the Willowbrook Ballroom (a lovely place I've been to several times) is a definite plus for Chicagoans, as is any local footage.  This movie is a MUST for any ghost story fan, not just haunted Chicago enthusiasts.",1212796800,,655,4.5
