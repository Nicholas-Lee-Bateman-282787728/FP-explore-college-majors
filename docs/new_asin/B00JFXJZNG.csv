8650629,2,B00JFXJZNG,"""Rolls Royce Baby""(1975) was directed by Erwin C. Dietrich. This movie is about a wealthy woman (Lina Romay) who has made her fortune from the photos taken of her. She now lives in a big mansion with her butler with nothing to do but pleasure herself, or to seek pleasure on country rides chauffeured in her Rolls Royce where she finds hitchhikers to join her in some frolicking in the back seat. This movie is Lina Romay, in the buff, from beginning to end. I found this film quite boring, and repetitive, but I can't say I hated it (how could one!) so it gets somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. For something else with Lina Romay that I found much more interesting on so many levels perhaps check out Jess Franco's ""Female Vampire"".",1454803200,,732,4.470149253731344
