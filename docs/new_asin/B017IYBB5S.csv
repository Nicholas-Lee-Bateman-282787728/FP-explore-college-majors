8739471,5,B017IYBB5S,"I'm an experienced woodworker and luthier from a well-known Pacific university, and loved every minute of watching  and learning from Mr. Taylor. Although I had only a passing interest in chip carving this was a great find because the teacher's warm style and wealth of information is both fun and useful. For example he tells you up front that you can do everything with just two knives, not a closet full of expensive tools, so right there you know he is the real deal. This is a learning tool you will want to watch repeatedly, and perfect if you've never seen this art done up close. Also a great example of how to teach. Fun and worth every penny.",1508457600,,652,4.4789915966386555
