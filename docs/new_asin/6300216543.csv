261230,5,6300216543,"This is based on a true story, a widely known fact, of which I was unaware until having watched the movie.  I thought it was great.  Great cast, reminiscent of 70s NYPD and the unimaginable corruption that burned through the department like the smack flowing rabidly and unforgiving thru the veins of junkies congregating in the infamous Needle Park in the 1970s.  The city was grimy and so were the people trusted to run it.  This depiction of a real life hero means that much more when the world around him is a perpetual smog surrounding and consuming even the most morally sound of men. Serpico was the epitome of  New Yorks finest, a term referring to the police department of NY hardly earned as a whole back in the decades of filthy cops infesting the boroughs, not only turning a blind eye to crime but participating in it together while wearing a uniform fit only for those who live and die to serve and protect. Ironically, Serpico didn't wear a uniform.  He didn't need it.  He was a natural born officer; honest and hardworking, selfless, and ethically sound, sacrificing the bonds and comradely he may have cherished if it hadnt meant that his morals and judgment would be fogged and subject to manipulation or pressure to maintain loyalty to his fellow officers who disgraced the badge, not by breaking a law here and there, but by using the badge to hide the malicious crimes that they committed sometimes for the entirety of their careers, never seeing the Justice they so dutifully earned; a one way trip to Atica, or Rikers.  Some were brought to justice and during this decade preceding the 80s when Brooklyns skyline illuminated with flames, and a whole new set of problems plagued the big red forbidden fruit, and we watched as the NYPD became great again.  Proud and strong.  Honest and trusted, New Yorks finest were just that.  Sometimes it takes a superhero to change a city or restore it to its former glory. Sometimes it takes one man willing to remove the cape and armor and follow his conscience...humanity would be undeserving of the title if we lacked the ability to sense right from wrong; we would no longer be human if we stopped caring.

In a nutshell (the size of the moon) ; GOOD FLICK.",1514764800,,2223,4.642857142857143
261231,5,6300216543,"This is the gritty true story of an honest, dedicated cop caught in a corrupt NYC police department involved in extortion and bribery.  Frank Serpico is a nonconformist, a true individualist, and many in the department hate. fear. and distrust him for it.  Serpico is so courageously honest and concerned to enforce the law that he and two other honest cops take the investigation of corruption (which involves the highest levels) to the NY Times, after failing to get action at any departmental level.  I won't give away the climax, except to say it is both tragic and triumphant.  The powerful theme is honesty.  The movie has a very beautiful musical score.  Al Pacino's acting in this film is better than in The Godfather series, just as this film is much better than The Godfather series.",1514678400,4,793,4.794117647058823

It was technically ok but it left me very very lackluster about the pending resolution of the story.  As I remember, when I saw it on first release in the theaters, I felt much the same way.

The tragedy for me about this movie was that the direction could have gotten really dark and intense, delving into the underworld of NYC in 1970 with the dealings between corrupt cops and organized crime etc. Instead it just shows Al Pacino crying like a baby in every scene to different people about how corrupt all the other cops are and not doing anything about it, because what can he do? except complain to new people about it ... until **spoiler alert - he finally gets shot in the face. The end. There were no twists, no interesting social commentary, no intriguing plot lines. It was literally just Al Pacino whining for 2 hours ...

MOVIE REVIEW:
I very much enjoyed learning about the true story of Serpico and along with it some great time-capsule elements of old New York. The romantic interest scenes and related acting were not very compelling and barely functioned to show that Serpico was human and had normal desires to connect relationally, which I supposed was to make sure the character was likable and we didn't see him as a heartless whistleblowing outcast. That aside, I felt the best parts of the movie were the police focused scenes, whether the antagonism from his enemies or the support of his allies, or the busts on the street, and of course the main story of his struggle to reveal the corruption and the gripping drama of that story as it unfolded.  Al Pacino is as compelling as always.

THE TIMELINE OF THE STORY AND OF SERPICO'S LIFE (spoilers ahead)

Sept 1959: Joined the NYPD

1967: First corruption report

1970 (April): he gives the NY Times his story

1971 (February, 10 months later), Serpico was shot during a drug arrest.  The movie shows Serpico laying there bleeding after the other officers left but doesn't make it clear how he ended up getting taken to the hospital; per Wikipedia, it's shocking to note that they really did completely abandon him and he only survived b/c an elderly tentant in the building called emergency services and stayed with him.

1972 (June, 16 months later); Serpico resigned the polic force, and the movie states he moved to ""some area of Switzerland"". Per Wikipedia, he stayed there almost a decade before returning the US, and lists him as of 2015 as living in upstate New York (town of Stuyvesant)

1973: The Serpico film was released 1973, based on book by Peter Maas (also published 1973) (Peter Maas was also later the author of 1997 best seller ""Underboss"" about Sammy ""The Bull"" Gravano).  I was curious how it was possible for a book to be released and the movie based on it also released in the same year (how fast can they film and release a movie!?), and found this:
The Producer Dino De Laurentiis bought the rights to make the movie after having read only the first 20 pages of Peter Maas's book, before the rest was even written. Some instinct!

The impetus to check the timeline of the whole thing was that I'd just seen ""All The Presidents Men"" a month ago and had that whistleblower movie fresh in my mind, and wondered if the 1970s whistleblowing in the police force was concurrent with the whistleblowing in the US government.  I looked into that timeline; and it turns out that indeed the Watergate scandal was made known to the public that same year, beginning with the newspaper story in January 1973.  I'm trying to guess about the zeitgeist in the minds and impressions of the public in 1973 when both Serpico and Watergate were revealed.  Of course, with Snowden's whistleblowing movie and I don't need to mention the current political climate, I guess revelations of secret corruptions and people's sense of it is not a zeitgest limited to the early 1970s.",1501891200,,3053,4.733962264150944
261320,5,6300216543,This movie is phenomenal. Some of Al Pacino's finest work.,1498953600,,58,4.9
261321,4,6300216543,"Very good! I am usually careful with the films from the 1970s as they sometimes can be slow or weird but this one is not like that. It is an interesting true story and consists of fast-changing scenes from both personal and professional events of the main character. Everybody is now used to the cop movies where it's all action and their real lives are just fragments. But this one is more 50-50 life and job. The film is so well done and so realistic - it's almost like watching a documentary. Nothing is sugar coated or made pretty - the New York City looks disgustingly dirty but not on purpose - just the way it used to be (and still largely is). The actors look like real people, the acting is superb - you never feel that they are actors. But what I love the most is that this movie makes you think - here's the real story of how the hell one person can fight against a huge ring of corruption within the very department that is supposed to investigate and prevent it. And, against all odds, this person does achieve real result, the kind of result that was historic and really helped to clean up NYPD. It is really on the backs of people like Serpico that the world stands. Taken from his biography: ""Serpico was the first police officer in the history of the New York City Police Department to step forward to report and subsequently testify openly about widespread, systemic corruption payoffs amounting to millions of dollars"". Another similar crime movie from the 1970s era that I love for fantastic realism and very interesting story is ""Gloria"", not the crappy re-make with Sharon Stone, but the original from 1980 with Gena Rowlands. Highly recommend if you like this one.",1498953600,2,1687,4.552631578947368

261324,1,6300216543,"Movie 6 of 1973 and 6 overall of movies from my lifetime that I decided to give a chance.
As shallow as it sounds I must be honest that one of the reasons I haven't seen many of the films of my life is because the titles alone didn't catch my interest. This effort to watch these films is to correct that. ""Serpico"" is one such film. The esthetic along with the title gave the impression that I would be bored. By and large I'm impressed with these movies so far and am happy that my prejudices have been proven wrong. I was not, however, wrong about ""Serpico."" I won't sugar coat it, I hated this movie. I can't think of a time I was more bored watching a film. My wife went to bed early and before it was over I ended up sorting and organizing things I had been meaning to get around to for years while I tried to pay attention. Perhaps that means you should disregard this review. I'm fine with that, but I had to be honest. I paid strict attention for the first hour but this movie simply couldn't keep my attention. There is just no story other than the uncompelling conflict of Serpico's rise to become a gold shield Detective. I did like the very beginning and the acting was top notch from Pacino to, really, even the slightest bit part. Pacino was thoroughly Pacino. The ending was akin to ""frankly Scarlet I don't give a damn."" In the end I was just plain bored and hope I never have to sit through this again.
Pros:
If you love Pacino a must see I suppose
Great acting
Solid beginning
Cons:
Predictable ending (and not due to the beginning)
Conflict was uninteresting
Quite possibly one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. A loathsome slog through the never of the mundane. I cannot overstate how much I hated this movie. A TOTAL waste of time and money.

Next week I continue 1973 with ""The Wicker Man.""",1494720000,,1823,4.299418604651163

Instead, he gets a bad rap for not being as rotten as the rest of his colleagues. While the movie and the ending was ok, there have been other movies and documentaries that have shown the corruption that happens within the police department (especially the NYPD). I loved the shots of old New York, and the setting gave it a great feel. But the movie (at least for me, seeing it this late), failed to live up to expectations.",1455580800,2,601,4.181034482758621

Serpico is one of the very few clean cops left in the NYC and does a great job resisting the temptation of a quick buck.  His relentless fight to stay on the path less traveled is one that should be admired.  The story is almost a reflection of the current police corruption in my native Mexico.  The corruption in Mexico (as in the movie) is apparent at all levels within all police department.

262057,4,6300216543,"More than forty years after it was made, the name Serpico is still synonymous with heroism. The multiple award winner features arguably one of the most successful actors and directors to ever grace the silver screen, but was Frank Serpico really a hero? Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) wanted nothing more than to be a police officer in New York, but once he gets there, he finds that things aren't as he'd hoped. The department is full of corrupt cops, but Serpico wants no part of it. He has no intention of turning them in, but when he won't take the money, everyone just assumes he already did, making Frank a target that has to act in order to save his own life. At first this film seems like just another police tale, that's been blown way out of portion by Hollywood, so why is it considered one of the top 100 films ever made? The combination of Al Pacino's infectious personality and Sidney Lumet's methodical and innovative story telling. At the time Serpico was made, Al Pacino was the brightest star in Hollywood and for good reason, he just has a way of getting people behind whatever character and project he's associated with. As for Lumet, he is known as an innovative director for simply trying things that everyone had available to them. Lumet uses different angles and close ups to make things more intense and exciting, as well as methodically going deeper into the story. It's this combination that made Serpico much more than simply another cop movie and a film that should be seen by all movie lovers.",1441497600,3,1518,4.625925925925926

262341,5,6300216543,"I see people are giving this one star because they think it is long and boring. I watched this movie in theatre when I was 10 years old and was inspired by every minute of it (Yes, I know it is R rated but R rating then was nothing then like it is now. And, in case you think my parents were not attentive, the did forbid my viewing of The Exorcist and The Rocky Horror Picture Show...hehe). Anyway, other more eloquent reviewers in the 3 and 4 star category have hit the nail on the head on why this movie is fabulous. All I can add is that the '60's and '70's era dramas just seem slower (compare Bullitt's chase scenes to anything on screen in the last 30 years) but that is part of their charm and the era's understanding of drama. In the current age, it is tough to sell a drama because action is the money maker. Sit, relax, and be ready for a storytelling knowing some ideas need to be conveyed with subtlety we are no longer use to in our culture. Serpico is a story that is even more relevant today that in was in 1973.

One thing that struck me is in the police academy graduation scene. The cadets are advised that everyday their lives will be on the line as well as their CHARACTER and INTEGRITY. In light of today's police abuse, police militarization, and ongoing police corruption and lawlessness, I think it is important that every time an individual officer or police union pushes for more protection and defensive/offensive protocols to save their lives, there needs to be an even harder push to ensure officers are able to finish their shift with their character and integrity intact because that is the real value of a human being. This is one of the underlying themes in this exceptional movie.",1414886400,,1715,4.410094637223975

262485,5,6300216543,"Al Pacino, in a magnificent, true-life portrayal of a courageous, police officer who went on to become an undercover, gold shield detective within the narcotics division was so absolute in his integrity, that he was one of the few who refused to take bribes, pay-offs and a cut in all the funds that were confiscated and brought in from drug busts. His fellow police officer's and co-workers from various divisions that he was transferred too, had their own unique little way of 'encouraging' him to cash in on the drug money that they took in and keep his mouth shut, while doing it. Unable to bear the pressure, he incognito went upstairs on them and was transferred to yet another division. This time for his safety, because no other officer wanted to work with him. Betrayed by lethargy from the higher-up's who were supposed to protect and come through for him, coupled with a wavering, immature, fear filled girlfriend who, when he needed her most, moved out. The climactic stage was set for the final curtain of Officer Serpico's, life. Death. By a group of his own. Police, killing police officers. Treachery personified? Oh, yeah! Big time! What a sad day that was not only for supremely brave Officer Serpico but even more so, for the cowardly, back-stabbing, narcotics detectives who mercilessly, set it up. And for what? For money that didn't know that they existed? For pieces of paper with monetary value which they lusted for by way of their greed? And to get it, they would sadistically plot to kill one of their own? Which they swore to partner with and protect? Their rationalization and justification was death to one of their own, because one of them was honest and refused to be greedy like they were, so they allowed a bullet to go to his head. Miraculously, he survived because the bullet went through his jawbone and face, instead. Yet, no sooner did he recover, he went to testify before a committee about the widespread corruption within the police force. Particularly within the narcotics division. His tremendous testimony not only indicted many of his fellow officers for bribery and racketeering but also for attempted murder of a police officer. Himself, as their target. With the hearings over, warrants issued and arrests made, a truly heroic, Officer Serpico having exposed the treacherous foes within the various police divisions, packed his bags and with his only true friend, his dog, he left the United States. In search of some much needed and well deserved, peace. I wish you well, Officer Serpico. I wish you the very best. Thank you for having the courage to do, what you did.

262725,5,6300216543,"Masters of Cinema UK non steelbook. This is the reason for the blu ray era. Not just the immaculate film reproduction but also the enlightening 43 page booklet included within the case. We learn that the movie was shot in just 51 days. The one outstanding experience I had whilst watching was the perfectly formed sense of time and place. The pealing paint on office walls, the colour in the clothes but most of all those wonderful old, old cars. I watched on projection as I sat on the stoop of a New York street.

The movie is about the laws within us and not just the laws written. The character of Serpico is one of self reliance. And love. You see that in the way he chooses a pet dog. In the way he responds to the chatter of a neighbour. He falls for her and her for him. Some call it intelligence. Compatible humour.

At some point you know you are going to learn the reason for him becoming police. I understood that reason. Ignorance is no way forward. I really enjoyed reading about what it takes to win an Oscar. Acting for an Oscar requires only an exaggerated visual performance. We should replace best with most says Karina Longworth, former chief film critic for LA Weekly. Accents do it, make-up (especially scars), deformities or drastic weight loss. She describes Pacinos acting as devoid of vanity. He is Serpico.

The only other thing worthy of note is that it is proper widescreen, no black bars. So take a trip back to the early seventies. When you had room to be. But society was the same.",1397260800,,1513,4.4548736462093865

262728,5,6300216543,"Sidney Lumet had a great feel for institutional corruption, whether in a police department, a diocese, or a TV network. Here it's the New York City police, and you can see how Peter Maas's book on the real Serpico must have appealed to him. But his way into such stories is through character, and Al Pacino gives us a here a stubborn, honest, not-always-likable man who simply can't stand it that so many police are on the take -- not always in a very big way, but to Serpico, you're either honest or your not. And of course, his colleagues in the police department soon find out that he won't take money -- he doesn't hide the fact that he won't -- and you have this absurd situation where his colleagues don't trust him because he's honest. The story of the movie is of Serpico's increasing isolation, and the psychological toll it takes on him and on those who love him. He never goes Howard Beale-crazy, but he becomes paranoid too, and yet he wants to remain a cop. By the end, after a series of transfers into new precincts and jurisdictions where his reputation precedes him, he is distrusted before he even starts, and in his final assignment, in a Brooklyn narcotics squad, we see his new colleagues making him do the most dangerous work and hesitating to help him when he gets in trouble. ( I had recently watched John Wayne in ""Red River,"" and Pacino's stubborn, willful sense of his rightness is similarly troubling, even though he is more clearly ""right"" than Wayne's character.)

Lumet's direction is excellent. You don't get pretty pictures -- just an unobtrusive rightness about the setting and cinematography of every scene. The same is true of movies like ""Network"" and ""The Verdict"" with their very different settings. And action is always tightly tied to character revelation, so that none of the gunfights and chases seem gratuitous.  Lumet also knows that you can't treat serious, systemic corruption -- corruption that goes ""right to the top"" of an organization -- and end a narrative with a sentimental kiss-off.  As in ""The Verdict"" and ""Network,"" the ending of ""Serpico"" is dark, consonant with the story.  Remember the scene where Serpico is testifying to the investigating committee?  All the high-level corrupt actors are still there, still in charge.  There's a tough-mindedness about Lumet that one can't help but respect.

The supporting cast of largely unheralded actors is excellent, and Pacino (in 1973 just a year out from ""Godfather"" Part 1) gives a performance of great intensity that nevertheless is not all about chewing the scenery -- and, as we know, Pacino can chew scenery better than anybody (see ""The Devil's Advocate""). Given that Serpico, as an undercover cop, is often himself ""acting,"" the focus and discipline of Pacino's attention to the character is impressive. For me it's a great American movie.",1394064000,,2850,4.8639175257731955

The story follows Frank Serpico, an ambitious and idealist policeman from his first days at the police force as he is exposed to a routine police corruption and to his final days in the force as he invests all his energy in fighting these corruptions. Al Pacino's Performance as Serpico is one of the best in his career, he plays it so cool and professional that it's easy to forget that back in 1973 he was still at the beginning of his career. He makes character of Frank Serpico unforgettable. The film itself is very credible and honest with no clichs that are often appear in this kind of genre. New York has got a terrific look here. every place in this film whether it's bars or shops or buildings is memorable.

Without those brave and courages creator-producers these words you would not now be reading, as much what is represented in this movie only a few stories of the larger picture of a well practiced barbarism that allows individuals to take this kind incorrigible envy seen as the norm and not notice their entire thought word and deed are pathetic vindictiveness. These movie moguls aid in passing off hate mongering in all it's venues as religion and govern-ment  have intended and as a result are continuing their dark agenda for now a few millinia. The protocol questions that mankind has to answer are easily solved whence the imposter powers that be are allowed to wallow in their self created incompetence and eventually die while those who count ( individuals that value their one and only mortal existence) continue not in some bogus gormandizing pragmatist imaginary life orientation bigotry , instead without those value destroyers actually have created happiness forever ,an entire 180% turn around. Just not even an addendum to this 60's 70's era look busy flurry of dung. This movie gave the guild an income for a short time. I can see them giddily giggling behind the seen.

262896,5,6300216543,"I love this performance by Al Pacino - Frank Serpico said Pacino played Serpico better than he did himself. Clearly Pacino got Serpico's dry sense of humor down. It is interesting to see how as the movie progresses and things get intense and dangerous for him, Serpico's sense of humor and lighthearted energy is sapped but he holds true to his principles. To this day NYC cops are pissed that Serpico rained on their parade. I am grateful that he had the integrity to do so, and that he survived to continue to be an inspiration and a voice for justice in the world.",1381795200,,567,4.461538461538462

It's fun to watch actors  performing in their young, beautiful years who've since achieved the pinnacle. It's not fun -- for me at least -- to watch performances essentially about one good cop vs a whole department of bad cops. Bad Cops cringe me up. For those who derive pleasure from watching films about police department graft, greed, bigotry, insincerity, and xenophobia, it would be hard to beat 'Serpico.'",1378598400,,523,4.876404494382022

I could see the very same police corruption and brutality portrayed in Serpico in the 9th PD Precinct streets in Philadelphia. My landlord in Philly had several apartment buildings.  A high ranking PD officer made the rounds once a year asking $100 for each apartment building. My landlord refused to pay. We had street cleaning on alternate sides of Green St. on Tuesday and Thursday. Every Tuesday and Thursday car 914 would park on Green St. between 22nd and 23rd, Two officers would write up tickets for any illegally parked vehicle. The street cleaning times were 7AM to 3PM. At exactly 7AM the two officers in car 914 would put the tickets on the cars. They never missed a street cleaning day. In Philly all police were on the take. The money went into a pot. The higher ranking police got a bigger cut than patrol officers. Al Pacino at his best. The real Frank Serpico is still around. He has a website.",1378598400,,967,4.525714285714286

262995,5,6300216543,I remember seeing this movie for the first time on TV when it was new. I liked it because it reminded me of when my uncle first became a cop in New York City.

263039,4,6300216543,"I didn't see Serpico when it was first released.  I was a year out of high school and was doing other things with my time and money rather than going to a lot of movies.  But Al Pacino was a hot property in those days. The movies were replete with new themes, reflective of the times, (the end of the 1960's) and it was interesting to see the images from 40 years ago.
  I met Sidney Lumet, years later, on another movie set.  By then, I'd forgotten that he'd directed one of my earlier favorites, ""Fail Safe.""  It generated quite a buzz in 1964.  Anyone wanting to understand the zeitgeist of the Cold War would do him or herself a favor by watching that movie.  Then ponder what a cultural distance was traveled between ""Fail Safe"" and Serpico.",1376179200,,746,4.355072463768116

At any rate, this film was awesome as it touched on his career and disillusionment on the NYC PD amongst the corruption in law enforcement.  I enjoyed it, perhaps just as much as Prince of the City.

Thanks for the quick delivery service.  Bravo!  Bueno!",1375056000,,368,4.584615384615384
263041,5,6300216543,Young Pacino is great in this real life movie about corruption and the cops who take money.  It keeps you on edge watching.,1373328000,,123,4.3478260869565215
263042,5,6300216543,"""Serpico"" is based on the real-life experiences of Frankie Serpico, an honest young NYC cop who risks his life by exposing corruption running rampant city-wide on the force. Gritty and grim, this film retains its freshness in its impact on this viewer who had not seen the movie since its release 40 years ago.
Al Pacino's performance, in only his second feature to receive top billing, contributes quite well to an argument that Pacino is one of the truly great actors of our time. With DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman entering into movie viewers' lives around the same time, it might become a little too easy to overlook Al Pacino's work. I would encourage film lovers to really dig into the Pacino catalog to share in my appreciation!
Despite Serpico seeming to be a ""one man show"" by Pacino, there are also strong performances in key supporting roles, including Cornelia Sharpe as a free spirited girlfriend who helps Serpico develop his undercover self, Barbara Eda-Young as the love of his life who leaves him out of frustration for having to share in his sufferings, and the great but under-appreciated character actor John Randolph as Frankie Serpico's empathetic chief. Tony Roberts portrayal of Bob Blair, Serpicos one friend in the justice department, comes off a little stiff and forced at times; otherwise, the overall cast makes the story so real.
Director Sidney Lumet places us right in the heart of the darkest recesses of a 1960's crime-infested New York City, and Al Pacino makes us feel like were watching Frankie Serpico in his quest to fight for what is right. Forty years may have passed since this movie's release, but ""Serpico"" stands the test of time as a ""must-see cinematic classic!",1372636800,,1704,4.899653979238754
263093,5,6300216543,"I watched this on DVD and I think that Al Pacino gave a stunning performance as Frank Serpico, an honest NYPD officer who gets mistreated by other officers who bribe him money that were taken away by criminals. But, Serpico keeps saying ""No"" to them, which is a wise thing to do. I am also happy that Serpico stopped at nothing to bring the bad NYPD officers to jail and restore order.",1371513600,,385,4.361111111111111
263094,5,6300216543,"""Serpico"" is a perfect blend of fine acting, great story, and thoughtful direction. One of the best movies from the 1970s, it shows you don't need car chases and special effects to make an exciting film.",1371254400,,203,4.666666666666667

263096,4,6300216543,"Like many great actors, Pacino is always Pacino.  It's part of why we watch him.  In Serpico the contained energy and dramatic ""economy"" of his performance is still recognizable in his more recent roles, but there is a smouldering pressure in Serpico (as there is in Michael Corleone in the Godfather) which today more often explodes in ""big"" scenes.  To convey the same explosive potential while containing it seems to me a higher form of the actor's art.  But then today almost everything in movies explodes or burns, so Pacino is in the mainstream.  It's a movie worth watching carefully.",1369440000,,591,4.87

The picture quality and sound really enhanced the experience of the story and the experience of life on the streets of New York. For those of you who are not familiar with the story, Serpico is a young and idealistic New York police officer in the bad old days of rampant corruption. Trained and assigned to work undercover (plain clothes) he discovers as much crime within his ranks as on the streets. He attempts to bring the corruption to the attention of his superiors and is met with hostility and denial. In the end, he is put in harms way by his own fellow officers and is shot for his trouble. I'll not give away the entire ending ... but leave it to say that he recovers, else we would not have this riviting story. The story is in the grand tradition of French Connection but much better (at least I think so). The performance delivered by Al Pacino is, of course, superb.",1365033600,,1012,4.4171122994652405

It was moving so slow and I just wasn't into it. We were told by a friend that it gets better so we decided to finish it. I am glad we finished it because it got much better.

In the end, it was a decent movie and I'm glad I watched, but probably not one I'd watch again.",1363910400,,416,3.5714285714285716
263147,4,6300216543,"The movie ""Serpico"" is a very fine movie. It is important because it demonstrated that Al Pacino could carry a successful film as the star.  The supporting cast was excellent as well.  This movie is based on the true life story of a New York City police officer who joined the force as an idealistic young man only to discover that the force was full of corruption.  The more he fought against the corrupt policemen that he worked with every day, the more corruption he discovered and the more he found that as a single man trying to uncover the wrongdoing of the force and trying to make a difference in a positive way, the more frustrated he became.  Eventually, when he found all other avenues closed to him, he went to the media, the New York Times and a commission was finally formed to investigate the issues in the department.  For his trouble and trying to do the right thing, Serpico was shot and almost killed by fellow police officers.  At one point, he was told that a police officer who did not take money when it was offered could not be trusted.  Since Serpico could not be trusted, a conspiracy was formed to eliminate him.  His idealism quickly became frustration and cynicism.

Serpico lives on in real life in Europe.  This movie is based on a book by Peter Haas and the account is pretty much true to life and not fictionalized. The women in his life and his family are pictured and add realism to the story and also are a sounding board to the frustration that he experienced during these years. Serpico grew as a person and during the course of the film, Al Pacino shows himself to be a brilliant actor. This early film helped set him as a versitile and talented actor.  This film was made after ""The Godfather.""

This movie was not the first or the last about the issue of corruption in police departments, LA Confidential comes to mind, but it is certainly one of the best.  Since this film is set in the sixties, it may seem a little dated now. It should however, stand the test of time and does show a great actor as he begins towards his greatness.",1363651200,6,2075,4.428947368421053

6/05: That is a great performance by Al Pacino. The story holds up well. However, it's not very complete. To watch Serpico is to see the fascination of the development of a character in Al Pacino. Also, Serpico is unique in combining authority and sub-culture in one person, and it works very well. I love the three parts about this film: the scene where Serpico explains his desire to be a cop, the moment when he finally gets the gold shield, and the final ending where I see him with a sheepdog and the closing statements. It is interesting to see him grow his beard and hair long while doing his job. All in all, Serpico is almost a near classic.

8/11: When I think of Al Pacino, I think of Serpico. What a great performance. Unfortunately, the film isn't up to par as I hoped. The biggest drawback of it is the pacing. At times, it moves well, but much of it is very slow. If you look at the opening credits, especially the cast, you will notice that it only shows Al Pacino's name. That's it. The film is all Al Pacino as Frank Serpico. And that's one of the coolest on-screen characters I've ever seen. The hair, the clothes, the hats, the attitude and the whole get-up, I love it all. I also love the story, the hopelessness of it all, being defeated by the morass of the system. The ending is a classic. All in all, Serpico features the finest work in Al Pacino's career. I am raising the rating of Serpico from `8' to `9'.",1312848000,,1461,4.3090909090909095
263283,5,6300216543,"Sidney Lumet's film ""Serpico"" is a brilliant depiction of Peter Maas' book on this simple, angry, and compassionate man who would end up turning the NYPD on it's head with the Knaap Hearings and firsthand eyewitness accounts of police corruption.

Frank Serpico, now 73, is played by a young Al Pacino straight off the first installment of the ""Godfather"" trilogy.  An idealistic young man who expects nothing more than to do what a police officer is actually supposed to do--protect the innocent and fight crime wherever it is found--finds himself in the NYPD of the early to late 1960's.  This a time in which the Italian American mafia had grown in power very significantly, before the Joseph Pistones and Henry Hills and Sammy Gravanos of the world appeared.  Lumet's skill in filming pre-Giuliani NYC almost reaches the level of Martin Scorsese.

From the first frame of the film one can see what is coming.  Serpico's alienation from his lazy, alarmingly serene fellow police officers is at first harmless, but when he realizes the reasons for their serenity (a cop gives him an envelope filled with 300 dollars for no apparent reason) the nightmare begins.  Naturally he believes that taking it to an authority figure in the department will start some kind of investigation.  He is told (and this is taken directly from the book) that if he decides to make any trouble over it he will be discovered ""facedown in the East River"" once all the investigations are over.  The Commissioner seems almost annoyed that he has to be bothered with any of this.  Doesn't Serpico know that the guys take money from mobsters and shake down drug dealers?  What planet is he from?

This story is almost biblical in nature and Lumet certainly took pains to make the other cops (with the exception of one or two other honest cops who tried to help him) around Serpico look agents from some Satanic agency a la Miss Baylock in the Omen.  Obese, cruel looking, base and violent, his position of honesty and refusal to participate even one inch in any division's dishonesty makes you fear for the guy.

In the tradition of the saints, he remains joyful and full of life despite his untenable situation.  Girlfriend after girlfriend come and go, at first enjoying his joie de la vivre and then being overwhelmed by his moods of agitation and fury at the corruption surrounding him.  Pacino does all this with his trademark intensity: perhaps the best scene in the film, also taken from the book, is when he humiliates a mobster who he arrests on the street for running numbers and who is a good buddy of all the men he works with.

Running from official to official, he is screwed around with to the point where one can visibly see him losing faith in the system.  His best friend, a more formal but equally just cop (Bob Blair played by Tony Roberts in an understated, realistic performance) uses all the connections he has to get Serpico a hearing on police corruption.

It happens, but not before Serpico is set up by a group of his fellow officers and shot in the face.

This is a tale for the ages and one which should not be forgotten.  The might of one strong, good man truly cannot be nailed down by a thousand weak corrupt ones.  Recommended to all, along with the book of the same title by Peter Maas.",1295827200,4,3296,4.656303972366149

Coming out right after the Godfather, this is the film that was all about Al, though the Godfather is a timeless classic it is often looked at as Brando's movie, while Serpico gave Al the chance to shine and demonstrate just how talented he was as a lead actor. The script is a fantastic adaptation of the book of the same name and Sidney Lumet does an incredible job, proving himself as one of those great directors that continues to do brilliant work throughout multiple decades. It's the story of a man, isolated by his co-workers because of his morals and intolerance to corruption, the abuse he endures because of it and his prevalence through any obstacle that gets in the way. It is a moving character study that can only be accomplished this well by an actor with incredible talent.

263288,5,6300216543,"Ever heard of Al Pacino? Well, I'm sure you have. Ever seen Scarface, The Insider, Heat? Or how about Dog Day Afternoon, The Panic in Needle Park, or Scent of a Woman? Yeah, he's been in numerous movies ever since the early 70's, and I'm sure you recognize at least his face. But in case you haven't noticed, Al Pacino is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of 20th-century cinema. In fact, he's one of my favorite actors of all time, and there's a very good reason for it: this guy can really act. He's been parodied several times on film and on TV, but that's because everyone knows how good he is. From The Godfather trilogy to Insomnia, his performances are MORE then just solid gold. A professional method actor, he simply becomes his characters, whether they are fictional (Ricky Roma) or real-life (Lowell Bergman). He's not Al Pacino in The Godfather trilogy, he's Michael Corleone in the Godfather trilogy. He's not himself in Dick Tracy, he's ""Big Boy"" Caprice. No matter how you look at it, this guy is a living legend among actors. However, if Glengarry Glen Ross or Carlito's Way doesn't impress you enough, then maybe Serpico will.

When The Godfather was released back in 1972, it made Pacino, who was unknown at the time, a movie star. Studio executives already saw him as a ""profitable"" performer, but it looked like Pacino was concentrating more on cinematic material rather than money, because his next movie didn't look and feel like a typical Hollywood-style film. Serpico is based on the real-life story of Frank Serpico, a cop who refused to adapt to the corruption that took place in the NYPD. The film was made back in the early 70's, and the budget looks pretty modest from the looks of it, but that's beside the point. What really matters is how mesmerizing this movie is. This is a carefully-directed tour de force that showcases not only Pacino's spectacular acting talents, but also gives us an incredibly solid character study of the man who would become famous in police departments everywhere. Here is an individual who is honest and is fully dedicated to his work, but who is also tormented by the fact that the people he is working with are secretly breaking laws. This would result in him fighting against corruption, with some severe sacrifices along the way. I must say that Pacino plays the part perfectly, of course. The appearance, the mannerisms, and the ANGER of Frank Serpico are shown with real strength and heart. This is one of his greatest roles.

Aside from the fact that this movie showcases young Pacino at his best, the movie is photographed beautifully and written extraordinarily well. Director Sydney Lumet breaks away from over-the-top action and suspense and delivers with a slow and steady pace, which I think is really appropriate for this kind of film. The supporting cast (Barbara Eda-Young as Laurie, Tony Roberts as Blair, John Randolph as Sidney Green) is all-around excellent. The music by Mikis Theodorakis is a pleasure to listen to (except during one specific sequence, in which the music sounds as cheesy as the theme for a 70's cop show).

After my first viewing of Serpico, I instantly fell in love with it. It has quickly become one of my favorite films of all time. I think that the movie is going to get better and better after repeated viewings. In conclusion, this is a great movie, and if you're a fan of Pacino, then you have to see this film. Too bad, though, that the DVD has now been discontinued. You'll have to buy a new copy as quickly as possible, or just purchase a used one from here or elsewhere.

There have so many crooked-cops-themed films in the past 30 years that this film has lost a lot of its shock-and-awe. The long hair, wild clothes, beads, etc. really date this film, too, it being so early '70s in looks. It's almost become a ""period piece"" as if it were the Roaring Twenties except its the Hairy and sleazy Seventies.

What hasn't changed over the years is Pacino's acting, of course. There have been very few films in which he starred that didn't display his talents to the fullest. This film, along with Dog Day Afternoon and few others, put him ""on the map,"" making him a big star. He's been a ""star"" ever since.

263292,4,6300216543,"It was Al Pacino's first big screen masterpiece of acting. The Godfather was really Marlon Brando's showcase vehicle, and The Godfather, Part Two was a year away, while Dog Day Afternoon, also with Lumet, was another year further out. Pacino's Frank Serpico covers alot of ground in his time on the force, and the two and a quarter hour film moves so briskly that it seems much longer, but in the good sense. As a biopic, it wisely focuses on the meat of the man's public impact, not a cradle to grave psychodrama. We see the thousand little ways that corruption breeds and spreads. Not only is evident it out and out graft and bribery, but in parking ticket quotas, freeby lunches, and the like of countless seemingly harmless acts. Serpico will have none of it, as he is shunted from precinct to precinct, and mocked by his fellow cops as a goody-goody, untrustworthy, and dangerous- all because he's decent and ethical. The non-stop harassment eats away at his insides and his mind, destroys his relationships with women, and lands him on a mission to clean things up, by whatever means he can.

  However, bureaucracy slows down his quest, until he connects with another cop, Bob Blair (Tony Roberts), who guides him across minefields of political machinations, until they both decide to go public to the New York Times. Consequently, Serpico is abandoned on a drug bust, by his partners, and shot in the face- the point at which the film begins, then proceeds to its coda. The film ends with Serpico going public at the Knapp Commission hearings, and then we get the credits telling us of the aftermath. Sidney Lumet had a perfect grasp of the streets and the times in this film, and the old clichs about them not making films like this any more is true. Compare this to the Academy Award-level `issues' films of recent vintage- The Hours, Million Dollar Baby, Monster, or this year's Brokeback Mountain- and there's simply no comparison. Realistic, but poetic, films like this are just not made by the damnable Hollywood machine any longer. And few independent films can afford the budget and time needed to craft so meticulous a work- Joe Carnahan's recent Ray Liotta vehicle Narc being a welcome exception. Yet, films like this, Dog Day Afternoon, The French Connection, The Conversation, Taxi Driver, All The President's Men, Apocalypse Now, and the like, still tug at the American psyche. Surely, there will be a time in the not-too distant future that such films will be welcome again?",1222300800,,2496,4.813519813519814

I'd even go as far to say that Lumet might have been one of the pioneers of movies that inspired the best directors of today to ask questions like ""is that what would really happen"" and ""is that how a person would really respond"" before allowing a scene to get printed.

Serpico still had its 70s era movie making quirks, but overall it was ahead of its time for making you feel ""truly involved"" with its characters. And having a young, talented Al Pacino in the cast (as the lead) certainly helped make an award-winning film.

Serpico is based on the real-life exploits of a NYC cop that is credited with exposing broad, long-standing corruption in the NYC police department (Serpico was a cop from 1959 - 1971). Clearly this exposure was not wanted by his colleagues. And the 1973 movie is a dramatic documentation of what Serpico went through trying to be an honest cop.

The movie gets a bit long in the badge by the final 30 minutes, but the suspense of seeing if/how Frank Serpico collars his peers keeps you interested.

263342,5,6300216543,"Sidney Lument made a brilliant move choosing to direct Serpico. And executive producer Dino De Laurentiis made a brilliant move choosing him to direct it. This is the film that put Al Pacino on the map.

With realistic acting and realistic actors - no makeup and flashy costumes and shots- Serpico has a gritty realistic feel that makes the story stand out even more than it would have otherwise. Al Pacino showcases his acting technique in the portrayal of a beleaguered New York cop who just wants to do his job. When he finds himself amidst high levels of corruption and money payoffs, he sets out to make it right. Unfortunately, the higher up he goes, he only discovers that the corruption is higher up than he could have thought.

Time has been good to this film and it still shines over 30 years later as a superb police film and real-life dramatization. Frank Serpico is a hero in the true sense of the word: putting his own life on the line in order to stop corruption.

The DVD package is great, and includes several special features including a making of featurette where director Sidney Lument talks about his quick and dirty directing style (and the fact that Serpico went from filming to theatre in only five months). There's also a short about Serpico himself, and the book by Peter Maas, that the movie was based on, as well as a brief short with Lument detailing his favorite scenes from the film.

I expected this movie to match the caliber of those movies but was greatly disappointed.  The movie lacks a lot of action and is extremely predictable.  To me it was extremely boring, with the main focus of the movie dealing on police corruption.  Sure it was corrupt back then but so are so many other organizations and businesses, I really do not think it was necessary to make a movie out of something that lacks exciting material, maybe the movie would of been much better as a documentary rather than a feature film that really has very little content.  The movie dragged on and on and could of been summarized in 10 minutes.",1174089600,4,742,4.590909090909091
263394,5,6300216543,"This early 70's classic starring Al Pacino as Frank Serpico , a NYC police oficer who's fight against corruption led to the Knapp Commission hearings and reforms , is a film that still pacts dramatic punch. While somewhat dated and Pacino's hippy cop act can seem almost campy 35 years later, his overall performance in this is still one of his best and following the Godfather established him as a major star.

The supporting cast is excellent as well, with so many guys playing tough ,jaded NYC cops from the era.

I guess the definition of a classic is a movie that represents it's era and yet can be viewed and enjoyed years later. Serpico certainly meets that criteria.",1171152000,3,674,4.65546218487395
263395,5,6300216543,"""The Godfather"" may have alerted us to the great actor Al Pacino but that classic first instalment of the trilogy was really Marlon Brando's movie. It was Sidney Lumet's ""Serpico"" released a year later, that confirmed his status as a movie star in his own right. This true story of an NYPD cop standing alone in the midst of corruption on a staggering scale, is both compelling and engaging. Pacino immerses himself in the role and it's not only his appearance that changes as the movie progresses. It seemed as though I could see the exhaustion gradually wearing him down from the sheer stress of trying to do his job with integrity, while enduring the hostility of his colleagues and the futility of fighting a system he couldn't beat. I loved every minute. I love these old-school New York movies anyway (made back when cars still had yellow licence plates) and even the music, by Mikis Theodorakis and arranged & conducted by jazz legend Bob James, was brilliant. Supporting cast give great performances, especially Barbara Edna-Young as Serpico's long-suffering girlfriend Laurie but this is essentially Pacino's movie.

The DVD extras include the original theatrical trailer, and a couple of documentaries: ""Serpico: from Real to Reel"", a very interesting one that tells the story of how the book by Peter Maas got made into the movie, ""Inside Serpico"" is another short with Sidney Lumet telling us about some of his methods making the actual movie, there's ""Serpico: Favourite Moments"" with both producer and director telling what some of their favourite scenes in the movie are and finally, there's a Photogallery of stills with commentary from director Sidney Lumet also talking about how the movie was scored.

This is a must for any Pacino fan or any lover of classic movies.",1169251200,3,1786,4.969899665551839

Albeit now a bit dated as far as the film's scenery and dress goes, it still timelessly captures the essence of the NYPD back in the 60's and early 70's.  Anybody intelligent knows that corruption still goes on in many departments (and many other industries too), but back then it was epidemic, and needed grand jury investigation.  That said, most police officers are commendable, honest, caring people that perform their duties very well, and proudly so.  But for those that flouted the law, and accepted graft, this film is an indictment to say the least.  This is, in my opinion, one of Al Pacino's finest moments and the direction by Sidney Lumet was brilliant!  One of the best films of the 70's, and a 'must see'.",1161648000,3,856,4.704697986577181
263398,3,6300216543,"Having read the book and watched the movie at least twenty times in the last ten years, I can honestly say that this is the story of truth--truth about what honest cops are sometimes faced with.  Whether crooked cops are ""meat-eaters"" or ""grass-eaters,"" they are still crooked.  For cops and cop-recruits it all begins with ethics.  This is the story of numerous ethical, honest and professional men, yet sadly it is also about crooked cops and, the movie leads the viewer to believe there are more crooked cops than honest ones.  This could not be further from the truth.  One should not get carried away with the liberties that Hollywood takes from time to time.  The impression the creators attempted to leave the viewer with was sadly accomplished.  Ask people like Ray Kelly, William Bratton, John Timmoney, or Richard Pennington if they would have so easily dismissed complaints of police corruption so easily.  Policing in America is a team effort and only those fit for duty can play.  The misrepresentation and sensationalizing of the few bad acts unfortunatley leave a wider impression for the public.  The creators of the movie ""Serpico"" act as if the representations in ""Serpico"" are ubiquitous solipsism.

It's an important story -- what makes a man fight against corruption, year after year, at the risk of his own life? We need more people like that, they are too few and far between.

I watched this movie for the first time last night. I've seen Al Pacino in many, many films. He's been one of our greatest actors for over 30 years, familiar to us all.

And yet, when I watched Al Pacino in ""Serpico,"" he was so convincing ... I forgot it was him. That's the highest praise I can give an actor.",1155600000,,651,4.078125
263400,5,6300216543,"Al Pacino had appeared in ""The Godfather"", but was not yet the film icon that he started to become, in part, because of ""Serpico"".  Francisco Serpico was an honest Italian cop - courageously honest.  When he saw widespread corruption among New York Cops everywhere he was offered the opportunity to participate in the payoffs that the police were receiving left and right.  Initially, Serpico simply abstained.  The corrupt cops became of suspicious of Serpico - at one point in the film he is told ""who can trust a cop who won't take a payoff?""  Because of his dedication to honest police work and a burning desire to ""do the right thing"" Serpico goes from a non-participant in the graft to actively fighting it.  He is understandably frustrated over and over when his reports to the police authorities are met with not much more than ""you're doing a good job, Frank, keep up the good work and we'll reach out for you when the time is right"".  The right time never arrives and Serpico, prodded by his friend Bob Blair (played by Tony Roberts), brings his complaints outside of the department - first to the Mayor's office, then finally to the New York Times.

Serpico is treated by his fellow police officers initially as an eccentric goody-goody, then later subjected to death threats.  The film is bookended by a sequence in Serpico's life when he is transferred to a narcotics division then probably set-up for assassination.  The point-blank bullet that Serpico's partners lead him into doesn't kill him and Frank is alive today, lecturing at police academies and for organizations interested in having a ""lamp lighter"" - giving support to those who have the inclination, but perhaps not the courage, to speak up about things that are plain wrong.

Now, thinking about the film later, I wonder what was going on in the minds of the other policemen.  Presumably, many of them didn't WANT to be crooked cops.  Certainly the ""extra"" money that they received was tempting - perhaps they looked at those extra dollars as compensation for what was not a lot of pay in a dangerous profession.

Serpico is one of the most visible examples of someone ""doing the right thing"" against incredible odds, even as his life was threatened.  This is a good story that needs to be told and Sidney Lumet and Al Pacino tell it well.",1155254400,,2317,4.7575
263401,4,6300216543,"It was so refreshing to see a masterpiece of storytelling transferred to a brilliant film. The special features with directors et al was very enlightening into the integrity and balance of the film. I never thought about the great acting I kept thinking of them as real people and felt like I was a fly on the wall of this incredible and terrible series of events in the life of Serpico. I think that is the key - if your not reminded of their acting ability because you are so involved in the story it has to be great. Pacino was totally believable and authentic in this role and I personally find this my favourite role for him. So to wrap up the waffling all I can really say is regardless of the fact this film is 30yrs old (approx), it stands with precious few as remaining a brilliant and topically relevant film. Bloody fabulous.",1153008000,,836,4.4
263402,4,6300216543,I read Serpico's bio after seeing the movie and fell that the movie stayed very true to the book.  I knocked down a star since Serpico's love life isn't done that well.  We have a scene where the police corruption is eating up at him so badly that he can't have a relationship.  I thought that the scenes with his first girlfriend were pointless and didn't add to the character development much.  The heart of the movie is Serpico's fight to be a different type of cop.  Then he must fight the system to expose corruption.  It's also great to see Pacino's work before he tried to be too hammy.  He can convey a lot of emotions in one look and doesn't have to resort to yelling a la Scent of a Woman/And Justice for All.,1147305600,,719,4.242647058823529
263403,5,6300216543,"The story of police officer Frank Serpico who, practically single-handedly, took a stand against the enormous corruption within the NYPD, and paid for it dearly, is still fascinating and still relevant; and thanks to a killer performance by Al Pacino, this biopic by Sidney Lumet stands the test of time. Serpico isn't quite as timeless as Pacino's and Lumet's second collaboration - the classic Dog Day Afternoon (also based on a true story, but with a bit more liberties taken) - but it rises entirely thanks to Pacino, who turned Serpico into a universal icon of integrity and idealism, with his beard, long hair and penetrating stare, as a hero who fights within the establishment and against it.

Along with The Godfather saga and Dog Day Afternoon this is one of Pacino's greatest performances, and one that earned him an Oscar nomination, and helped make him one of the prominent American actors of the 70's, alongside the likes of Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman. Serpico was a part of the revolution in American cinema in that period, which was becoming younger, darker and grittier - and like films such as Taxi Driver, A Clockwork Orange, Dog Day Afternoon, Straw Dogs, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, Midnight Cowboy - it stands the test of time. It's definitely not the best of that list, and it's not high on the list of all-time essential classics; but it's fascinating, gritty, realistic drama, with an important message, and for Pacino's performance alone it's worth every minute.",1145836800,2,1516,4.921875

263454,4,6300216543,"Serpico, 1973 film

The opening lists the names of the people who worked on this film, adapted from the Peter Maas book. The first scenes show a wounded Serpico being sped to a hospital. Serpico thinks back to his beginning as a policeman. He will be tested as to his character while fighting crime. Serpico is taught how the system works while he is on the job. An arrested rapist is encouraged to inform on his playmates; Serpico uses diplomacy and learns more. Serpico joins the Identification Division to advance his career. Serpico gets the label of ""weirdo"" and hangs out with artists (or beatniks?). Serpico's grooming allow him to be well disguised. He learns that who you know is important (as in other fields of work).

The story continues and shows Serpico's experiences at work in New York City. His police partners work hard at their job. Serpico works undercover. He trusts his handler; but is his trust misplaced? The political reality is that the system exists with the knowledge and tolerance of the rulers. [This is another example of the feudal system, as in politics; those who swear fealty to the ruler are always rewarded.]

The Commissioner tells the police brass to go ahead and investigate corruption. But rumors about Serpico abound among the police. Serpico will talk, but he won't testify against the other policemen. He is warned about what can happen if the force is not with him. [Can any institution be reformed from within?]

The 'NY Times' prints a front-page story, and the Whitman-Knapp Commission starts to investigate. Serpico is transferred to Brooklyn South to work on drug dealers; this could be dangerous. Then a drug bust goes wrong and Serpico is shot. His gold shield (#761) came through (he is now a first-grade detective). But the wound damages his hearing in his left ear and affects his left side. The film ends by showing Serpico making a speech. But what has really changed since then? There are parts in this film that suggest it was oriented to a foreign audience. The film suggests no answers to the recurring problem of big city corruption. Would placing the police in the Civil Service system prevent corruption? Does it work with other government agencies? Or is corruption inherent in our civilization, like human error?",1143590400,,2278,4.8785529715762275

263456,4,6300216543,"One of the more underrated performances of Al Pacino's gifted early career, SERPICO was filmed in between THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER, PART TWO, and was quickly followed by another incredible performance in DOG DAY AFTERNOON.

Pacino plays frank Serpico, a New York cop who couldn't be bought. Based on the biography SERPICO by Peter Maas, Producer Martin Stegman and Director Sidney Lumet capture perfectly the gritty realities of Frank Serpico's tenure with New York's Finest, when for a time it seemed that Serpico was alone in his refusal to take graft and his resistance to the system that allowed it to flourish. Other cops hated him. These qualities nearly cost Serpico his life, as he went to the New York Times to expose police corruption.

The film is an artifact of its era (the early Seventies) and maintains a steady but not frenetic pace. SERPICO's visual and stylistic influence can be clearly seen in such TV cop dramas as the old KOJAK, and today's LAW & ORDER and NYPD BLUE.

Pacino embodies Serpico's mix of innocence, frustration and impotent rage at the machine even more effectively than Maas's book does. He also plays out Serpico's rather unconventional Sixties lifestyle to the hilt, a lifestyle that made Serpico a pariah amongst his fellows. Watch carefully: The ""be-in"" party scene beautifully foreshadows Pacino's performance as SCARFACE Tony Montana in the Club Babylon ten years later, and Pacino's depiction of Serpico's assumption of disguises (as a junkie, a deliveryman, and a Hasidic rabbi) are moments of humor in what is overall a rather grim biopic.

Serpico was eventually shot in the face by a pusher while on narcotics detail, and lay unattended and bleeding profusely while his fellow cops went after the perpetrator. Although he survived, he left the force and retired overseas, having spurred the Knapp Commission to investigate police corruption.

The DVD has merely obligatory special features. Martin Bregman's retrospective is so monotone that it induces sleep, and Lumet's commentary is too short and insubstantial to keep the viewer's attention.

Let me start by saying to those who haven't seen this movie yet: Just avoid it, and don't be fooled by all those positive reviews.

I was fooled by the posiitve reviews in here, and i thought a movie with Pacino must be as good as these reviews, well, its not.

I can understand that people who saw it back then (70s) must've found it a great movie, and im sure it was. But we have entered a new mellinnium, and this movie cannot compete with today's modern movies.

Don't get me wrong, cause i like alot of 70s movie, but this just isn't one of the good ones.

This movie has aged, it had a poor plot, a poor editing, it had multiple characters with no goal, and a boring plot line.

The only good thing is Pacino's acting, he was good as usual, but even his acting couldn't save this movie from sinking.

I gave one star only for Pacino's acting, but for the rest, well a fat Zero. Take my advice and avoid this movie at all costs.",1132617600,7,939,4.126373626373627
263458,4,6300216543,"I simply cannot understand why only 45 people have reviewed this movie.  SERPICO is a classic of 1970s cinema and of Lumet's film catalog.  Watching SERPICO is like taking a big breath of fresh air.  I love returning to the realism of the 1970s.  Lumet's camera always seems to cut right through all of the muck, casting a bright light on his character's lives, situations, and surroundings.  SERPICO is the true story of a virtuous cop in a corrupt system.  A veteran of the plain clothes unit, Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) lives and breathes the streets of New York.  We follow him from his graduation from the academy and observe his entire progression as a cop in the force.

Pacino is at the top of his art form: he lives and breathes this cop.  Things start going badly for Serpico because he is the only plain clothes cop in the city who is not accepting bribes from the local gangsters and underworld.  While Serpico lives in an idealistic world in which the cops are cleaning up the streets and making New York a safer place to live, the other cops are merely using the force to make a very good living.  They give no thought or care for crime.

As Serpico begins to seek advice and counsel on how to improve his situation, he begins to realize just how far the corruption goes.  SERPICO works because it traps our character.  He is a cop.  He has always wanted to be a cop.  He cannot just quit.  But he can't turn to anyone for help either because the whole force is corrupt.  What is ironic is that in a world of drugs, murder, and money, Serpico's greatest enemies are his fellow police officers.

SERPICO is not a terribly uplifting film.  It is inspiring to watch a man whose character is so unquestionable that you feel bad for your own inadequacies and failings.  But it is also hard to see a good man suffer at the hands of a corrupt system.  Please: see this movie and give it the reviews that it deserves.

Based on a true account of a clean cop trying to stay that way in a sea of corruption, director Sidney Lumet portrays Serpico as a man searching for justice to the brink of obsession, costing him everything from his lover, his career, and nearly his life, in the process.  Though he was robbed of an Oscar for Best Actor, Pacino is unbelievably brilliant as he displays all the strengths and vulnerabilities of the title character.  His performance alone makes Serpico one of the finest crime/cop films of the 20th century, and is worth the price of admission alone.  Future Oscar winner (and later Scarface co-star with Pacino) F.

This movie is really entertaining because of how real it feels.  THe actors are no-names and the scenary is very raw and all shot on location.  Director Sidney Lumet portrays the police oficers as regular people and does not get into any shoot-outs or truly heroic moments that so many other cop films depict.  There are no car chases and there are no true moments of valor in this film, unless you count Serpico's epic battle to bring the whole corrupt system to an end.

Al Pacino's performance in this film is fabulous and is very convincing.

It's one of those movies that brings me to an abrupt stop when I'm channel surfing although I don't come across it that much lately.  Many people may have forgotten or never knew the story of the New York City policeman named Frank Serpico.  However, his revelations about graft and corruption in the NYC Police Dept were a major event in the city.

Al Pacino does a terrific job of bringing the character of Serpico to the screen.  His unassuming but tenacious effort to just be an honest cop makes for a different sort of hero.  From practically his first day on the job he is confronted by offers of bribes and he soon comes to realize that it is systematic throughout the force.  Every time he thinks he's found someone to hear his protests he's reminded that everyone is part of the problem or afraid to do anything about it.  The way the whole story is woven makes for an interesting movie but it is the acting that raises the level even higher.  This seems to be just the sort of role made for Al Pacino.  The script enables him to be more than just a cop.  There is a romantic and social side of Serpico.  However, that may only have been as an opportunity to show the effects of his obsession and frustration with reforming the system.  His achievement ends up being a pyrrhic victory.

Some of the scenes seemed a bit exagerated but my biggest complaint about ""Serpico"" is quality of the cinematography.  Each time I've seen it on TV it looked like we were watching a very used video.  I haven't purchased or seen a new DVD version but I trust someone was able to clean it up.

His work in Serpico is full of the beauty and rage of classic poetry.

Lumet's direction is street-smart, bordering on documentary style at times, absolutely riveting from the first image of a gravely wounded Serpico to the last shot of Serpico with his dog, all alone in the world with his integrity.  Lumet also manages to bring in humorous scenes, such as the one in which Serpico and other cops try marijuana and get the munchies--sounds silly, but it's not.  Lumet is an actor's director and lets his cast establish the momentum of the film.

The supporting cast is uniformly impressive, with Tony Roberts as an interesting foil for Serpico and a host of solid character actors playing various cops who are hostile to or just plain weirded out by Serpico.

The extras are not bad, although I was hoping to find out more about the ""real"" Frank Serpico.  He does have an interesting website and is very much alive and well, in spite of all the tragedy he has faced.

Actually, this movie shows that there are 2 ""real Frank Serpicos,"" and one of them was Al Pacino in 1973.  The only slight criticism I have of the movie is a tendency to make Frank look too good and everyone in the NYPD (almost) look like a scumbag--he almost comes across as Saint Francis, not just Frank--but, it's a movie no matter how gritty it is, and some oversimplification goes with the territory.  In any event, Serpico is a great 70s film, a great police film, and a document of the genius of Al Pacino.",1116288000,,1713,4.586885245901639

Its interesting to note how Pacino(Serpico)gives such a haggard appearance as a police officer/detective.

263529,5,6300216543,"Mention 1970's cinema and SERPICO is one of the first 5 films that comes to mind.  This was the first Pacino tour de force in a film that has staying power through today.  Sidney Lumet created a materwork without equal. I always said that had it been released a year later it would have garnered more than the 2 Oscar nominations it did (Pacino as Best Actor and Best Screenplay-Adapted, for Waldo Salt and Norman Wexler).  The film is true to the best seller by Peter Maas and accurately follows the actual record of events (The Whitman Knapp Crime Commission, Serpico's tours of duty with the NYPD)without adding any fluff.  The secondary performances are outstanding, with John Randolph spectacular as Sidney Green, Tony Roberts rock solid as Bob Blair and the drop dead gorgeous Cornelia Sharpe (where is she these days).

263530,5,6300216543,"I've always said in my personal meetings with coleagues and friends that Pacino is much more than an actor ; he's a nature force .
But back to Serpico. This movie not only remains as cult movie and one of the most`powerful works of this tireless film maker as Sidney Lumet was in that age. Serpico meant a breakthrough with the ancient patterns of good citizen and virtuosi cop.
Serpico is a simple inmigrant citizen who lives in a little department ; he brings in his mind the ancestral illusions for being part of the american dream . His inner sense of justice is not influenced for any other kind of ideology . In this sense he's naif ; suddenly he's inmersed in a double face world; the eternal game of make the things appear right ; though they are rotten really .
His search for the sense of justice prevails and becomes nowadays, in a kind of romantic knight ; but he , besides the prize he must pay for his behavior , goes ahead no matter what. Don't forget that in times of hipocrisy ; any sincerity is associated with cynism.
This film is part of the amazing sextet together with Twelve angry men, The pawnbroker , The offence ,  Network and Equus ; that in my opinion express the most remarkable works of that extraordinary film maker.",1088553600,5,1247,4.421739130434783

I had to hit pause a couple of times during the movie to truly appreciate the goodness.  I have only recently come to the conclusion that Pacino is ^&%*&^% UNBELIEVABLE!!  This guy is not only just a raw talent, but he could pick them also.  People always talk about the DeNiro Scorcesse connection, but Pacino Lumet relationship is unstoppable.  The gritty realness that is felt on the dirty pavement of New York is a welcome change to the bloated stuff that I have seen recently at the movie theaters.  Not only do I like the acting in this movie, but I also like the story.  The two go hand in hand to produce a classic that I should have seen a while ago.

263532,5,6300216543,"Fantastic film with Al Pacino in the title role playing Frank Serpico, a real-life NYPD detective whose integrity nearly cost him his life (by disgruntled co-workers) and definitely cost him his career. This movie made Pacino an icon during the 70s, and he's never slowed down since. The plot is that Serpico goes undercover to ferret out other cops who are on the take.
When we first watched this film it was on TV, and about 15 minutes from the end we suffered a power outage - and we freaked out, ran outside, up and down the block, looking for a neighbor who maybe still had power. No such luck, of course: the whole area was blacked out. It was about 3 years later that we rented it in video and finally got to watch the rest of it.

263533,5,6300216543,"SERPICO, is one of my favorite movies of all times. I love everything about this film especially Al Pacino who gives the performance of a lifetime. Pacino was so convinving as undercover cop Frank Serpico that it is scary. This film defined the way police corruption is looked upon in the eyes of everyday policemen and it also became one of the first films in the 1970's to explore the antihero in its most complex form. This movie was s smash hit at the box office in 1973, when it was release and it was nominated for I believe five Academy Awards including Best Picure of the year and the Best Actor for Al Pacino, sadly enough neither the film or the actor won the coveted award. A lot of people say that it was The Godfather that Pacino proved that he was a great actor and even though in The Godfather he did an excellent job as Michael Corleone, it was in SERPICO, that I feel he was at his very best. He did follow with other great films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and BOBBY DEERFILED and he was brilliant in both but it was after watching SERPICO for the first time that I became aware of Pacino's brilliant acting talent. This film is a MUST if you care about excellence in acting or if you just one to see a great movie.  I highly recommend the book in which the film is based on it is also excellent. You should read the book first and then see the movie to get a better understanding of everthing that the character goes thru but either way if you see the film first and read the book after is no biggie.

263554,3,6300216543,"Any film directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Al Pacino should be great, but ""Serpico"" is mediocre at best.  Chronicling the true-life story of Frank Serpico, a police officer who exposed corruption in the NYPD, the film comes from that exquisite golden age of cinema, lasting from the late '60s through the late '70s, when paranoia infected the country and our most trusted and honored institutions were becoming suspect.  It's got the grainy, neo-realistic feel that so many of the films from that time period had (and as many of Lumet's own films had), yet it never really works.  Lumet's pacing is poor; no scene lasts longer than a minute or two.  While one would think this would make for a film with some narrative drive to it, just the opposite happens.  It's as if in the editing room all of the important parts of each scene got left out, and what we've been given as a final product is an outline of Serpico's story.  No characters beyond Pacino's is really developed, and even he struggles to make something substantial out of his role.  This came directly on the heels of ""The Godfather"" from the year before, the film that put Pacino on the map.  ""Serpico"" gives testament to Pacino's abilities and range as an actor; his performance is quite different from that of Michael Corleone. But for me, it's not until his mesmerizing performance in ""Dog Day Afternoon"" from 1975 that Pacino really flexes his acting muscles and shows what a true cinematic treasure he is.
26 years later, Pacino was to star in ""The Insider,"" another thriller where he played a character who helps to expose corruption, this time in the world of corporate America.  My advice is to see ""Serpico"" for the place it holds in Pacino's career, but then see ""The Insider"" for a suspenseful, terrific movie.
Grade: C",1060560000,4,1799,4.722044728434505
263555,5,6300216543,"Out of all the performances he did in the 1970s, Al Pacino's amazing, realistic performance in Sidney Lumet's 1973 film SERPICO is by far his most underrated.  Even though the movie was a success and critics praise this as one of Pacino's best roles (I would agree to that), SERPICO was sandwiched in between the two GODFATHER movies which contained Pacino's most famous role of Michael Corleone.  It seems that some have forgotten this film, but luckily I read about it recently and now have discovered how great this movie really is.  It was also a groundbreaking motion picture - the first movie ever to expose police corruption among the NYC departments.  Corruption was known to exist in police departments, but it remained largely underground and unknown to the public.  When the original book was published followed by the film version which became SERPICO, it exposed the public to a hidden evil that was lurking right under their noses and how one honest cop tried to change all that for good.
The film is based on a true story, on the life of Frank Serpico (Pacino).  It begins in the late '60s and ends in 1972, during Serpico's five-year ordeal as a NYC undercover cop.  When we first see Frank in his younger years, graduating from training, he's an idealistic man who wants to help people.  It's clear from the start that Serpico is not your average policeman: he is honest, a do-gooder, wants to help people, by-the-book, and his facial and top hair are extravagant.  He hates wearing the uniform and becomes a part of the plainclothes division.  As time rolls on, Serpico notices that various police officers are taking money from criminals as well as bribes, and also beat the criminals mercilessly.  It's all drug money or the like, and Serpico wants no part of it.  Throughout the movie, he constantly ignores the copious bribes offered to him by his peers.  Thus, Serpico hops from precinct to precinct hoping to work with honest cops, but it turns out that every precinct in the city is even worse than the last one.  Frank wants to expose this police corruption, but his so-called ""friends"" give him false promises and drive him towards frustration.  He begins to snap, it damages his relationships, and when he says that he is all alone in this case, you can't help but believe him.
Serpico's story is not a triumphant one.  For all the good he tried to do and for all the effort he tried to do to put an end to rampant corruption, he is constantly spit on for his actions.  Pacino really gives an effective performance throughout.  He starts off as a nice, humble guy who wants to do the right thing at the beginning, and by the end the right thing almost causes him to lose his life.  This is a really great showcase for Pacino's talent.  Sidney Lumet directs the film with gritty expertise.  You really feel like you're there in New York circa 1970 and it just adds to the painful, grim realism of the film.  The special features on the DVD are also good, the best of which is a short but rewarding two-part documentary on the making of the film.
SERPICO is a towering achievement.  It deserves more credit that it gets.  Here is a movie that features one of our greatest actors in prime form and a wrenching story told the way the real Frank Serpico would've wanted it: honest.",1055721600,6,3304,4.618150684931507
263556,4,6300216543,"For many viewers of my generation, the definitive Al Pacino performance is the Cuban drug lord Tony Montana in Brian DePalma's 1983 ""Scarface"" (""Say 'allo to muh lil' friend!"").  But for me, the cream of Pacino's crop was in the 1970s, and among his great performances in that decade was in the 1973 movie ""Serpico.""  In this feature directed by Sidney Lumet (who also directed another Pacino film, 1975's ""Dog Day Afternoon""), Al plays a cop who joins the force with the best of intentions.  He's honest, sincere, and treats criminal suspects impartially--qualities that should enable an officer to advance in his field.  Instead, Frank's kindness and humanity make him an object of scorn and contempt among his peers, who engage in shady dealings and suspicious activity.  Frank's job ultimately takes a toll on his life, both professionally and romantically, and by the end of the movie, he's transformed from an eager-to-please cop to a jaded officer.  The movie is an effective and scathing commentary on police corruption, and it earned Pacino his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor (he was previously nominated for Best Supporting Actor for 1972's ""The Godfather"").  The DVD offers a decent picture and surround sound for a movie of this age, and the extras include retrospective interviews with the filmmakers.  I was disappointed that Pacino isn't featured in any of these interviews, but aside from that, I thought they were overall informative.  I'd hesitate to call ""Serpico"" a classic, but it's a fine and gritty drama that has an award-calibre performance by Pacino.",1049500800,32,1591,5.111969111969112
263557,5,6300216543,"After years of having to live with the previous VHS release, with its sides cropped and its colors faded, I was more than pleased to finally see ""Serpico"" as originally intended, in widescreen, and gorgeous Technicolor.  The score and audio tracks have also been cleaned up in this Paramount re-release, and it's worth every cent.
Sidney Lumet is often thought of as an actors' director, more so than a cinematic genius, but ""Serpico"" more than delivers in both arenas.  Al Pacino's portrayal of the eccentric Frank Serpico -- a NYPD cop of unyielding integrity -- is one of his best roles ever.  He's animated, tough and very human in his role, and one can sense that a lot of the real Serpico rubbed off on him.  ""Serpico"" also boasts an excellent supporting cast. Aside from Tony Roberts, who was already well-known from his roles in Woody Allen movies, take a look at these then-unknowns, who would soon either make it big, or be regulars in cop and crime movies:  Alan North, Jack Kehoe, Tony Lo Bianco, Richard Foronjy, F. Murray Abraham, Judd Hirsch.
Director Lumet is featured in the two ""making of"" featurettes that are included on the DVD, and it's fascinating hearing his method of shooting and his and producer Martin Bregman's reminisences.  I had only wished that Pacino was also included, but since I don't buy DVDs for the bonus material, not a big loss for me.
This is one of the best transfers of a preservation print from the 1970s, an era of notoriously quickly deteriorating color negatives.  Thank you, Paramount, for giving ""Serpico"" the TLC it deserved.",1045440000,15,1577,4.797047970479705
263558,2,6300216543,"I bought this dvd based on the reviews I read, well let me tell ya, this movie is very dated. The direction is very poor. Time in this movie moves very fast, the only way you can tell that a year has passed is by the length of Pacino's beard or the growth of his dog. The story is boringly (is that a word?) told. It would make a great re-make done by a better director. Maybe in the 70's this was cutting edge, but I found it as interesting as an episode of Matlock. Now with that said, Al Pacino is the bright spot in this black hole of a movie, his acting is the only reason I could stay awake. So if your an Al Pacino fan....and you have to own all of his movies then and only then get it, but if you just want to watch it once to see a great preformance by Al, RENT IT.",1041811200,3,774,3.813664596273292
263559,4,6300216543,"Al Pacino became a star thanks to his role as Michael Corleone in The Godfather.  The film that cemented Mr. Pacino as one of the best actors of his generation was Serpico.  Based on the Peter Maas book of the same name, Serpico is the true story of a New York undercover cop who seems to be the only honest cop on the force. Due to his honest nature, the other cops are leery of him and refuse to accept him as a real cop.  To that end, he moves from precinct to precinct in search of a friendly work environment, but wherever he goes, he finds the same old situation.  Serpico then goes to the higher-ups in the department, but they too have no use for his accusations.  Finally, he goes public with his accusations and that triggers an investigation into the dealings of police officers.  Serpico becomes a marked man and is nearly intentionally killed by another cop who while Serpico is on an undercover operation.  Mr. Pacino brings a realistic approach to the role and you feel sympathy for Serpico.  He is not a great man, he has his faults, but he believes in what he does and he takes a stand for his belief that policeman should serve the public and not illegally benefit from their position of power.",1041206400,3,1212,4.403587443946188
263560,5,6300216543,"Before anyone who is expecting a good old-fashioned Good Cop V.S. Bad Asses action thriller, hold your horses. Although it is unlikely that anyone who really enjoys a piece of fine motion picture should be disappointed by ""Serpico"", there are no nature-defying stunts, bloodthirsty lengthy shoot-out, or high-speed downtonw car chase. All you will get, is a near-perfect blend of gripping story (based on true event), mesmerizing performances, and skillful yet subtle and minimal directing. ""Serpico"" is not a story about a supercop on his way to solve a gruesome crime done by some twisted psychopath, with extreme force or genius instincts. Yes, ""Serpico"" is a courageous and heroic figure, but he is also as down to earth as your next door neighbor painting his house. This is about a personal struggle, a tough test on a individual's hope, faith, and moral. While this movie may not be described as an epic masterpiece, it is indeed a milestone in cinematic achievements.
By this DVD, Paramount did a great job preserving this film that made Al Pacino being reconized as one of the finest actor in our era. The picture is sharp and clean, though at time the colors may seem muddy. The 5.1 Dolby Digital is as good as you could expect from a sound track remastered from it's mono original. Whileas it may not give your surround system a good workout, it does provide a better dimension to some of the much-needed ambience.
For extra, ""Serpico: from Real to Reel"" is a short documentary about the birth of this movie, and ""Inside Serpico"" is a longer behind-the-scenes featurette which reveals more lights from the history, production, and the public reaction upon its release back in 1973. Most part of these documentaries conisists largely of newly-filmed interview clips with producer Martin Bregman and director Sidney Lumet. To top it off, there is also a 2 minutes, yet somehow redundant ""Serpico: Favorite Moments"" interview clips with Bregman and Lumet each talking about their favorite part of the movie. All these could be string together to be a more fluent featurette, but I guess by seperating them this way, they could make the Special Features resume looks more impressive.

263561,4,6300216543,"I just have few comments about this movie... I really appreciated the excellent directing & the excellent performance by Al Pacino.  The turmoil Serpico felt as to wanting to be a good cop, but also knowing the shame of being assoc. w/the known to be corrupt police force was compelling to watch.  The pressure he was under was tremendous.  As some others have said, it WAS a real-life horror/suspense story.  When the other cops confronted him in the park I thought it was LIGHTS OUT for him!  I liked the part when he first met the bag-man, and he fooled him about the mouse who sniffed out heroin.  I knew right then there was serious trouble ahead for Serpico.  The understated, subtle, pressure-cooker acting from Pacino was the best!
I just had a few problems-- the movie ""did not age well"" as someone else said--it had a tv movie feel.  But I still loved the time capsule effect of seeing NYC back then, and also the close-minded views of the cops vs. hippies & gays, and also how the free-spirit girlfriend ended up being ""traditional"" after all.
It was also very confusing for me keeping track of all the cops & Serpico's allies.  But all in all I'm so glad I saw this movie!  Now on to Dog Day Afternoon!",1030579200,2,1214,4.4772727272727275

Assuming that the real Frank Serpico was accurately depicted, my estimation of that man has, if anything, doubled as a result of my years as a cop, trying in my own way to follow in those grand footsteps. Pacino simply nails the walking-on-eggshells, lone-wolf, and frankly courageous aspects of the character. The perfectly realised portrayal of the concommitant self-destructive turmoil which poisons Serpicos personal relationships as an almost inevitable result, should have garnered him with the Best Actor Oscar that year. A young and brilliant Pacino at his stone-best before he started caricaturising himself.
Lumet at his zenith. If you love Lumets directing, please seek out the hidden gem ""Lovin' Molly"" from about circa 1974 starring Blythe Danner, Anthony Hopkins and Beau Bridges. Trust me, it will affect you.
'Serpico' has lost none of it's impact despite being close to 30 years old. Please rent it, buy it, or, if you are truly brave, live it.

263603,4,6300216543,"Al Pacino is a short man, but one won't recognize that because he gives such awesome performances.  In 'Serpico' Al shows us he just doesn't do gangster roles.  Based on a true story, 'Serpico' is about an honest cop who is caught in a dishonest police department.  The beginning sequences are dreamy and happy, but soon it becomes much darker.  Soon Serpico realizes being honest is more dangerous then being corrupt.  The entire department is against him and there are physical attacks on him.  It goes to the point where he loses his girlfriend.  That was good though because the girlfriend was a bad actress.  That was one of two main flaws of the movie.  Some of the acting was bad and the screenplay was weak.  Oh well, one can't expect brilliancy at every turn.
The other star of the film is the director, Sidney Lumet, who is one of the most underrated directors I know of.  Lumet films are always set in New York and always involve tough characters.  Although he uses limited ideas and settings, his films are always good.  They never become tiresome and one knows they have spent their time well watching them.

Sidney Lumet directed Pacino as the real life hero cop who took on police based evil in the New York Police Department.  Pacino gets completely into the role...he becomes Serpico, an honest open-minded hippy cop in the '60s pitted against his corrupt disgusting colleagues and the higher ups who not only allow the corruption, but (as the film hints at) conspire to crush those who try to expose it.
  You must see this film uncut, as many of us saw it only on TV with much of the intensity cut out.  Of course the film adds some extra drama to it not in the actual Peter Maas biography, just as Alan Parker did in Midnight Express.
  Some tidbits:  They actually had a year long TV series Serpico in 1975.  And watch for the newly finished World Trade Center in the background (during the actual events it wasn't yet finished...not nitpicking...just something of interest).

Serpico is an easy-going guy with very clear morals about what's right and what's wrong.  As he moves from precinct to precinct in dire hope of finding an honest place to work, all he finds are more and more corrupt cops...and it seems to be driving him insane both morally, and insane because the cops aren't comfortable with cops who don't take money.  The film does a great job of displaying how the corruption is corrosive and unjust to the people of our country...but esp. interesting is that this wonderfully directed Sidney Lumet film is really very much like a suspense adventure chase...but at a much slower speed in which you can watch as things crumble and go to pot.  Pacino plays the role in an understated manner...perhaps due to his knowledge of the real Frank Serpico, or maybe a creative choice.  Either way, it's not his usual boisterous way...no crooked looks, no playful grins, etc.  You'll forget Pacino is in this character.

7806445,5,6300216543,Al acted wonderfully in this inspiring movie based on the true story of going against curruption and the frustration and terror of being alone; risking it all to for what is right. In doing so the real Serpico changed NYPD. I loved the time this story took place. The film was perfect and what I expected. I did not need it to be anything other than it was.,1516665600,,357,4.264705882352941
