8403492,5,B003RCIM3U,I really love the short little workouts on here and will usually add 1 or 2 on to a longer workout. I especially love the Abs segment which uses a medicine ball. I usually hate Abs excercises but he makes it fun! I also love his Ab Lab DVD.He seems like just a really nice guy and I enjoy working out with him-this DVD is a favorite of mine and I have an awful lot!,1428969600,,365,3.88
