8488854,5,B005XP6HHM,"I was really impressed with this video. It's great for beginners as well as more-advanced pilates enthusiasts. The production value is extremely high, with a very helpful basic introduction which includes dioramas explaining the basic theory of pilates. Ellie is clear in her instruction, the workout flows nicely, and then hip-hop at the end is a fun way to ""wrap"" it all together. I would love to see more videos from this duo - especially from Ellie. I was sore for two days after doing it for the first time and still love doing it on a daily basis. MAKE MORE VIDEOS! Highly highly recommend.",1329177600,,596,4.685714285714286
8488855,5,B005XP6HHM,"I am a stay-at-home mom that has no time for the gym. I LOVE pilates but get bored of the same old mat routine. This is such a great blend of toning and strengthening exercises with the added fun of a great hip hop routine. It uses parts of my brain that haven't been used in awhile- and I'm burning calories!
Highly recommended.",1326240000,,329,4.238095238095238
8488856,5,B005XP6HHM,"I love this workout!  The Pilates portion is easy to follow, and not at all cheesy like some other Pilates DVDs I have done in the past.  You can follow either beginner or more advanced moves, so it's great for all skill levels.  The Hip-Hop portion is really fun as well.  Each part is broken down slowly at first, and gradually builds up to a faster pace.  Overall, this DVD is a great option for people like me, who prefer to get a great workout at home instead of spending money and time at an expensive gym.",1324598400,,512,4.237113402061856
8488857,5,B005XP6HHM,"This is an amazing exercise DVD. It is the perfect combination of core strength training and cardio workout- I highly recommend it! The pilates portion of the video is just the right length and accommodates both beginners and advanced pilates students. Although I'm not a dancer, I enjoyed the hip-hop routine and it really got my heart pumping! It's a lot of fun and you will be glad you bought it.",1324080000,,399,4.633802816901408
