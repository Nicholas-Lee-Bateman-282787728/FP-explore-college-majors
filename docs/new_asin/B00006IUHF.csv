7969556,4,B00006IUHF,"In the first shot of the film, Protestant minister Jean Barnery (Charles Berling) is leading a funeral procession. The year is 1900 and one of the great patriarchs of one of the great manufacturing families/dynasties has died and the entire village dressed in black has turned out to mourn his passing. Assayas frames the shot to look like Gustave Courbet's famous painting of a mid-19th century funeral procession. Although this film will deal with the changing fortunes of two families (one a cognac manufacturer, the other a porcelain manufacturer), this shot and this film is less about history, and its various disruptions and continuities, than it is about Jean and the ascetic devotions that provide the substance and sustenance of his life. At the graveside he tells his congregation that everything in this world will disappoint and that we must live this life in preparation for the next. Though Jean will leave the church, he'll never entirely abandon this ascetic philosophy.

The film, based on a famous novel by Jacques Chardonne (an aristocrat who later favored collaboration with Nazi Germany --although this fact does not feature in this film), is divided into three one-hour sub-sections, each sub-section covers a ten-year span of time and centers around Jean's dominant devotion(s) of that particular period. The first section focuses on Jean's (largely successful) attempt to distance himself from the worldly concerns of his wealthy family of porcelian manufacturers, his largely unsuccesful devotion to the church, and his on-again off-again devotion to his first wife Nathalie (Isabelle Huppert) and daughter Aline (Mia Hansen-Love). The second sub-section focuses on Jean's (mostly unsuccesful) attempts to flee the world of responsibility (business and family ties) and find happiness far from the madding crowd in the Swiss mountains with his second wife Pauline (Emmanuella Beart). And the third sub-section focuses on Jean's decision to return to the world of business and family responsibility and his (partially successful) attempts to save the family's porcelain business in Limoges.

The first sub-section is the least satisfying section of the film as too many characters are introduced with very little attempt to explain their relationships. Of course part of the pleasure of watching an historical epic is figuring out who is who and how they will figure in the over-all story, but Assayas, who has made his reputation on small films that focus on only a handful of intimates over a relatively short period of time, seems out of his element here and really uninterested in painting a rich panorama of intersecting lives/destinies. However, once we accept that Jean is the only character that Assayas really cares about and his the only destiny that we are being asked to contemplate, we adjust our expectations and spend far less time caring about the rest of the players. Assayas certainly seems more interested in the particulars of cognac and porcelain production than in the particularities of any of his supporting players.

How much patience you have for this epic (that is really not an epic but one man's coming-of-age disguised as an epic's coming-of-age), will depend on how interesting you are in Jean's perpetual un-happiness and inability to find any satisfaction from any of his changing devotions (religion, love, family, porcelain). The only other character who peaks our interest is Jean's first wife Nathalie (Isabelle Hupert) who we find to be even more obsessive and demanding and perpetually unhappy than her ex-husband. Unlike Nathalie (whose singleminded devotion to an ideal is frightening even to Jean), Jean does undergo a kind of third-act/death bed conversion, but instead of suddenly finding religion, he finds that life is meaningless without love. Of course this revelation only comes after years of being utterly incapable of loving anyone or finding any joy in life (with the sole exception of one brief Bergman-esque moment beneath a cherry tree).

Assayas (born in 1955) was not exactly a young man when he made Les Destinees (2000) but he was a man who had only made a few features at this point in his career, most notably Irma Vep (1996) and Late August/Early September (1998) which are both films about artistic identity. My guess is that he made Les Destinees as a way of figuring out his own artistic identity/destiny (and perhaps as a way of identifying and overcoming his own faults). Certainly we can read the films interest in quality goods as a way for Assayas to examine his own interest in quality films and what it takes (and what one must sacrifice) to maintain an almost ascetic devotion to quality in an age with fewer and fewer connoisseurs who appreciate quality. Jean's ascetic devotion to quality never seems life-affirming until the very end at which time he seems filled with a kind of life-affirming understanding and forgiveness (of his own and other people's faults) that his earlier self would never have allowed. And this seems to be the revelation that Assayas found in this material: that we can be several selves throughout our lives and that when we look back on our previous selves we may not even recognize those earlier selves. Luckily for Jean, he saves his best self for last. Like Jean, Assayas is at his best when he merges his love of tradition/craft with his love of life-affirming youth and innocence. The merging of these traits is most evident in his masterpiece Summer Hours (2008) and, to a lesser extent, in his latest film, Something in the Air (2012).

Assayas just doesn't seem comfortable with the historical epic. He does not spend enough time creating a rich tapestry of characters that the genre requires and he never sufficently develops or foregrounds the importance of the historical material (ie the working class's changing attitude toward their aristocratic lords). So for most filmmgoers this is a three star film at best. But for Assayas fans the film has added interest as many of his familiar themes--identity, rapidly changing social conditions (as well as radical shifts in personal perspective), devotion to a craft--- gain new valence here, hence my four star rating.",1369267200,2,6207,5.129446640316205
7969557,5,B00006IUHF,"The story of a man (a very good performance by Charles Berling) over a 30 year period,
starting at the beginning of the 20th century.

It explores what matters to him -- the women in his life, his morality, and later
his porcelain factory.

It poses some important questions; how does one balance morality, passion and
being an artist?  And when is the pursuit of perfection a vice or a virtue?

There are flaws; some interesting plot lines are simply dropped, and other less interesting ones
get more time than they need.  Isabelle Huppert, while always good is surprisingly a
bit one-note, and Emmanuelle Beart can't really pull off being an old lady.

But this ultimately felt like more than the sum of its parts.  By the end
I felt moved and thoughtful, and it's 3 hour length, while deliberate, was
never boring.

Critics were very divided - some coldly dismissed it as dull and seemed angry at
Assayas for betraying his earlier hipper, more energetic films (I'm just impressed
by his range), while others, like me, were really taken in by the Dickensian sweep.",1308268800,3,1066,4.724324324324324
7969558,4,B00006IUHF,"Beautifully shot and directed romance with a beautiful heroine. Emmanuelle Beart. Slow paced, graceful, and scenic. This movie is truly a work of art but a great movie no. Dialogue is vapid, trying to be insightful. I did enjoy it greatly anyway like a piece of museum art.",1220572800,,273,4.708333333333333
7969559,2,B00006IUHF,"What happens when Europeans apply their methods of closet drama to make an ""epic""?

You have the usual main characters whom you don't like at first sight and want to get away from as quickly as possible once you get to know them better.

You have no action whatever on screen for the entire 165 minutes (not three hours).

You have brief glimpses rather than scenes.  For instance, WWI is three glimpses, none of which involve battles or anything as vulgar as that.

You have a lot of talk, which is believed by the characters and by the filmmaker to be profound and insightful, but which is merely stupid.

You have people who are able to manufacture misery out of thin air.  Even when they're living in an idyllic Swiss villa with no need to work, they manage to be miserable.

You have the work of a factory lovingly portrayed with many, many glimpses.

It is sad that people have been made to regard such posturing as art, and even sadder that some people take such sick observations about life seriously.  The only profound remark in the entire film is that love is what matters.  True, it is; but this film does not illustrate that.  Still less does it make the audience feel that.",1157846400,4,1187,4.4953271028037385
7969560,5,B00006IUHF,"I read the reviews of quite a few people for this film and would like to comment on certain things omitted from their analysis. For starters, this is a movie about LIFE, so where to start with life? Pick a time zone for the beginning and end of the film. The comment of one intelligent reviewer was that the movie had no ""meat"" in the beginning or end and that the ""meat"" was in the middle, but he just doesn't understand that this is merely a movie about life. Why cut out the trip to America? The movie tries to realistically portray business problems and the problems with competing internationally, and it shows how management tried to deal with their problems, and portrayed management as being inept, which happens in life!  This reviewer says there is no substance in this movie, but I submit that the reviewer did not pay attention while watching the movie.
This is a wonderful movie about life and the problems of life and relationships, and of love that dies, and a man that is brave enough at the end of the film to admit his shortcomings in life and to finally realize that love is everything, and that without love there is nothing, and this comment concludes the movie, while flashing back to the ballroom dancing, in the beginning, in the year 1900, when this couple was young and in love, which gives the movie closure; characters that you don't like are supposed to not be liked!!
I liked this movie very much and watch lots of international movies and like French films, and this is one of the best films I've seen in quite some time and gets close to a 10 out of 10 rating in my book. The movie appears to start and end abruptly, but keep in mind that this is only a movie about life, and that the starting point and ending point are merely moments in time.",1077408000,20,1776,4.414634146341464
7969561,3,B00006IUHF,"Every story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. In the case of the film ""Les Destinees,"" the beginning is in 1900, and the end arrives three decades later. In the middle is the meat of this film, and this includes:

A scandalous divorce
An idyllic soujourn in Switzerland
The First World War
The fortunes of a porcelain producing family
The inside of a swinging Parisian nightclub circa 1930
A religious conversion
An adulterous affair
The stock market crash of the 1920s
The production of several lines of porcelain
Cherry picking

And I have probably missed a few things...

Now while this DVD may last three hours, there is enough material in this film to make a mini-series. This is a sumptuous epic--gorgeous sets, marvellous scenery, wonderful costumes--but somehow or another all these lovely trappings just left me cold. It was like consuming a beautiful but hollow cake--perfect icing, but nothing underneath. The story was just too involved to condense adequately and meaningfully into three hours. There were many scenes that added nothing at all to the main thread of the story--the enduring nature of love. Many of the scenes could have been very comfortably cut from the film--at absolutely no loss to the plot. What was the trip to America all about? It added nothing--except, I suppose, it helped qualify ""Les Destinees"" as an epic, and the bar scene with all the wild young ones, and the religious conversion. Chop, chop chop--all worthless.

Charles Berling was excellent as the minister who dumps the church, but Emmanuelle Beart as his wife, Pauline was too wooden and pouty for my tastes. She trounced around the sets like a little girl. She looks good, but the acting....Now I am going to add here that I usually LOVE French films, and consume a regular diet of foreign films. This was a disappointment. If I rate ""Les Destinees"" against other French films, I would probably give it two stars, but if I match it against most of the tripe out there, it starts to look better, so for this reason, I am giving it three stars. If you are a French film fan, you may very well be disappointed in this--displacedhuman",1043193600,27,2135,4.793478260869565
7969562,5,B00006IUHF,"The production of porcelain and cognac are the axis around which this film revolves.  The film documents and dramatizes the sacrifice involved in maintaining quality during hard political and personal times.  Covering several decades, the film intelligently probes philosophical themes of love, duty, family, and death.  The acting is superb. Be aware that the movie is some 3 hours, so allot the time.  One of my favorite scenes is the waltz scene; the grace of this dance is captured by the turn of the head of Pauline (Beart).",1038873600,18,529,4.9772727272727275
7969563,4,B00006IUHF,"LES DESTINEES is another one of those period pieces that reminds us of how magic cinema can be.  Set at the turn of the century the plot revolves around a triangle of two women and a man who rediscover themselves at the cost of the changes the world endured in the time of the great wars.  The importance of family is approached in a pungent way, fighting as it does here against the discovery of honest love: how far will a man of means risk his profession and his marriage for the love of an outsider?  Though the story has oft been written and told, much of the success of this film lies in the capable acting hands of Isabelle Huppert, Emannuelle Beart, and Charles Berling.  Erring on being a bit too long, the technical aspects of this film seamlessly hold your attention - a vital stage for some fine storytelling and acting.",1037232000,15,832,4.4183006535947715
