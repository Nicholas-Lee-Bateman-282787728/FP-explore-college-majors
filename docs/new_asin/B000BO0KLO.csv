2430950,5,B000BO0KLO,"I have everyone of the DVD`s of Hunter so far and I can`t wait for the next one. It was absolutely one of my favorite TV shows and anyone who is a Fred Dryer and/or Stepfanie Kramer fan will love these DVD`s. Buy it, I promise you won`t be disappointed.",1156204800,,253,4.08
2430951,5,B000BO0KLO,I wish this show was still on the air. I thought it was the best detective show ever on TV. Every week's episode was a totally different storyline. The chemistry between Stepfanie Kramer and Fred Dryer was comparable to Bogey and Bacall. I can't believe it has been over 20 years since the 1st episode aired. Long live Hunter in re-runs and on DVD.,1156118400,2,348,4.453125
2430952,3,B000BO0KLO,"Hunter, Season Three is selling for the same price as Season One and Two.

The first two seasons were single-sided DVDs, season three has gone to the double-sided disk.

The producer of the Hunter series has increased his profit margin and the consumers, may suffer--I don't have much faith in the quality of double side disks.

Follow-up--I was watching the ""Crossfire"" episode and lost the sound.

I won't buy anything else on double-sided DVD.",1149552000,6,446,4.986486486486487
2430953,5,B000BO0KLO,"If you read the earlier review that stated that these are the syndicated versions, don't fret too much, because it's not exactly true.  The only episode that's been cut is The Cradle Will Rock and that was due to music rights issues.  The remaining episodes may have a few music changes, but otherwise are the real deal.

Season Three is the best of the seasons of Hunter.  There's plenty of action for the action fans and the dialogue and chemistry between Hunter and McCall are smokin'!

One thing that old fans of the series may have forgotten is how funny this show is, and many of the funniest bits were improvised by Fred Dryer and Stepfanie Kramer.  Check out the hilarious banter in From San Francisco with Love, and experience the depth of Hunter and McCall's feelings about their partnership in Change Partners and Dance.

Order this DVD and you won't be sorry.  And when you're done, get season two!  Episodes like The Big Fall, Rape and Revenge and Burned are top notch and won't disappoint.

Hard to tell I'm a big fan, huh?",1143331200,21,1037,4.586956521739131
2430954,5,B000BO0KLO,Excellent if you like old cop shows. I am a big fan of the old cop shows so i would recomend this series to all.,1141948800,2,112,3.52
2430955,5,B000BO0KLO,I love Hunter.  Thank goodness they are releasing the series on DVD.  The episodes look great in digital format.  Best TV show ever -- and I do mean ever.,1140739200,3,154,4.241379310344827
2430956,5,B000BO0KLO,"This season had some of the best episodes in the Hunter series. ""High Noon in LA"", ""Any Second Now"" and ""Shades"" are some of the best! It's great that after all this time Hunter is finally being released on DVD! I just hope it continues and all the seasons are released. Including the couple of new episodes that were filmed and never showed during the hunter revival a couple of years ago!!!",1140739200,5,392,4.458333333333333
2430957,2,B000BO0KLO,"This set of ""Hunter"" included my favorite episode, 'The Cradle Will Rock', guest starring Chaka Khan.  I was very disappointed to find out these are the syndicated episodes and not the full and complete episodes that originally aired on NBC.  Therefore, some of the scenes have been edited out of several of the episodes.",1138924800,17,321,4.925925925925926
2430958,5,B000BO0KLO,"This show is still good!  Sometimes, it gets a little slow when a 'romance' develops; but otherwise, it's dynamite!

The generic has been changed.  It's softer at the beginning with the kids shown before a drug deal; but once the dead blond is seen, the main theme roars out with Hunter and McCall!

Here are my comments on some of the key episodes:

Overnight Sensation: Excellent beginning!  A reporter is obsessed about sinking Hunter.  That episode is well played and very believable.  Good story too.

High Noon in L.A.: This is a follow-up episode from the 'rape and revenge' from season 2.  The plot is very good still.  I'll admit that this Mariano is somewhat less sleazy than the rapist.

From San Francisco with Love: yes, there is some romance in this one.  However, it is short and when Hunter's new love interest is a cold-blooded killer; it's great!

True Confessions: A woman's sister is drugged and raped by 3 young men.  She dies during the assault.  The 3 men get off on a technicality and then the sister is outraged.  When each suspect dies one by one, Hunter suspects the sister.

Love, Hate and Sporty James: This episode is the result of what happens when a small-time hood plays with the mafia.  Sporty James made a deadly mistake sending his girlfriend to her death!  Dealing with the mafia is deadly enough, but f..... with them is much worst!

The Contracts: Another great episode where a kidnapping is staged.  However, when the gardener is murdered; Hunter gets on the ball fast!

Bad Company: WWF fans rejoice!  Big John Studd guest stars as the #1 terrorist muscles.  His battle with Hunter is fun but unrealistic...How can an ex-footballer (even though he's 6'6"") deal with a former WWF champ?  Great performance for Studd however as he sells this very well and we're fooled into thinking Hunter takes him out!

Double Exposure: Good story about a burglary ring which turns to murder.  McCall goes undercover to investigate.  George Clooney, as the 'brain' behind the scam, offers an excellent performance.

If you enjoyed the series back in the 80s, then you'll love this collection!  I can't wait to get seasons 4, 5 & 6!

Until next time,

Charles D.",1136592000,5,2186,4.744

2430994,5,B000BO0KLO,"Steve Cannell peddled a stack of these dime novels and we ate them up. This series features Stephanie Kramer in the role of DeeDee McCall, who is in a lot of the drama. Fred Drier stars as Rick Hunter, and together with DeeDee break every rule, disobey every order and disregard every constitutional right ever thought of in the face of every civil rights legal debate ever argued. Now that we've got the stuff that doesn't matter out of the way, let's just consider the following: a lot of pointless car chases, extreme gunplay, dead bodies piling up like cordwood, total disregard for authority, more broken down doors than an Israeli police action, poindexter bureaurocrats, lawyers that make Matlock look smart, ... to sum it up, a hell of a lot of fun. I think what really makes it all palatable is miss Kramer (by the way, they never were able to make her look bad, no matter how hard they tried); easily one of the most beautiful actresses of her time who can really act... makes you forget the cold pizza and warm beer ...sammy",1407110400,,1035,4.56989247311828

2430997,5,B000BO0KLO,"In my opinion, the third season is the best so far.  I haven't ordered #4, but I am going to.  Hunter ruled on Saturday nights for a long time and as long as I have the DVDs, he still does.  Good action.",1362960000,,203,3.7857142857142856

2431003,5,B000BO0KLO,"They don't make cop shows like this any more.  I watched every season of Hunter when it first aired on TV, and am proud to welcome this latest addition into my collection.  Of all the seasons of Hunter, this is my favorite.  There were some great storylines, and the increased role of the Captain made for some conflict and daring policework on behalf of Rick and DeeDee.  There's also a lot of great music on this season, and we see the story unfold of what happened to DeeDee's husband.  It is unfortunate this is where the boxed releases of Hunter ends.  The only criticism I have is that the discs are two-sided, and sometimes that means they skip or stop playing.  This is a must-see season for all devoted Hunter fans.  It's also great for people who are fans of good, gritty cop shows.  If you are a fan of LA-based cop shows, there is a good new show, Southland, that might give fill your need.  It's nice that they are still trying to make things in that genre.",1241913600,,970,4.368715083798882
2431004,5,B000BO0KLO,"When my husband and I can sit down and watch a show together because we BOTH like it, that says something.  Great show.",1228176000,,119,4.173913043478261
2431005,3,B000BO0KLO,"This 1986-87 Season of this police drama wasn't too shabby,but could've done better and left us mourning the loss of Hunter & McCalls former superior officer(Capt. Wyler)after only 1 season since Bruce Davison left the show in the Spring of 1986 just before Hunter's Third Season was underway.

As a matter of fact the 3rd Season of this police drama is also the season when Los Angeles police Capt. Charlie Devane(Charles Hallahan) joins the cast and crew of Hunter as Hunter & McCall's superior officer replacing Devane's predeccesor Capt. Wyler(Bruce Davison) at the fictional Metropolitan Police Department in L.A. since Wyler supposedly got promoted to Deputy Chief & transferred to Downtown L.A.

Capt. Devane was the most successful, most sophisticated, and smartest captain on this show and had co-starred on HUNTER the longest out of all 4 of the superior officers that the inclusive, but not so popular police investigators Sgt. Rick Hunter(Fred Dryer) and Sgt. Dede McCall(Stepfanie Kramer) ever had throughout Hunter's whole 7-year run on NBC, since Devane lasted on the show from the 3rd Season all the way to the 7th Season when McCall gets replaced by rookie police Det. Joanne Molenski(Darlanne Fluegel)in the Fall of 1990 who then got eventually replaced by Hunter's old flame Sgt. Chris Novak(Lauren Lane)in the Winter of 1991 before this police dramas cancellation in the Summer of 1991.

In addition, the 1986-1987 Season was also the season when Hunter & McCall's street-savy informant buddy Sporty James(Garrett Morris) joins the cast and crew of the show and when Hunter & McCall's doofus fellow officer Det. Bernie Terwilliger(James Whitmore, Jr.) departs the show after his last appearance in the ""Overnight Sensation"" episode, which was the Season Premiere to Hunter's Third Season, plus this was also the season when Hunter & McCall's streetwise fellow officer Lt. Ambrose Finn(John Shearin) started coming out more often helping Hunter & McCall in their homicide investigations as well as the season that showed Finn the most and was a hell of a lot more competent than Bernie was.

I was also intrigued in the ""Requim Of Sgt. McCall"" episode when Hunter and McCall temporarily got reunited with their former superior officer from Season 2 now(Dep. Chief Wyler)who helps Hunter, McCall and Devane out on a homicide investigation that backtracks all the way back to when McCall's husband was killed in the line of duty explaining how Hunter and McCall met before they were even partners when McCall was still just a patrol sergeant while Hunter was already a sergeant working investigations.

I also agree with Rykre that HUNTER's 4th Season should be released on DVD and that the 1987-88 Season of HUNTER should've been released a long time ago, since HUNTER's 1986-87 Season has already been on DVD for nearly 3 years now along with the fact the first 3 season of HUNTER have already been on DVD now for the longest time among other things.

Therefore, I can hardly wait till HUNTER's Fourth Season comes out on DVD, since they've already got the first 3 seasons on DVD and since it's been about 2 years since HUNTER-Season 3 has been on DVD, so I don't see what's taking them so long to bring HUNTER's 1987-88 Season out on DVD, especially since the Fourth Season of Hunter is even better and a lot more upgraded than the first 3 seasons along with the fact that this season takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""COME HOME TO NBC"".

This 1986-87 Season also had some pretty interesting guest stars in it to like
*Lydia Cornell in the ""Straight To The Heart"" episode after her co-starring days as the foxy Sarah Rush on TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT

*Dean Stockwell in the ""Bad Company"" episode before his co-starring days on QUANTUM LEAP

*Lauren Tewes in the ""True Confessions"" episode after her co-starring days on THE LOVE BOAT

*Jared Martin in the ""Shades"" episode after his co-starring days on DALLAS

*Ken Tigar in the ""True Confessions"" episode during his co-starring days on DYNASTY

*Ismael Carlo in the ""High Noon In LA"" episode during his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA and DAYS OF OUR LIVES

*Wrestler Big John Studd in the ""Bad Company"" episode

*Singer Chaka Khan in the ""The Cradle Will Rock"" episode

*Ray Wise in the ""Crime of Passion"" episode after his co-starring days on DALLAS

As a matter of fact, a Hunter-Season Four DVD would make a nice X-Mas gift this year if it were to get released by early December of 2008.",1214784000,3,4489,4.894598155467721
2431006,4,B000BO0KLO,"This is one of those great shows whose consecutive releases on to DVD may be halted because most fans of the show believed that the show was getting better and stronger later into the future seasons.  With only a mild appeal for the first few seasons, it's very likely that Anchor Bay feels that the show isn't selling well enough with the first few seasons so they may have decided to give up continuing the releases on DVD.

That's a shame, because many of us ""Hunter"" fans felt the the best episodes were when we were getting use to Charles Hallahan as Hunter and McCall's boss.  The earlier shows showed that Rick Hunter wasn't treated with any respect from his boss or the police station in general.  This was a bad start for the show.  If Rick Hunter's superiors had no respect for him, how could we, the viewer, find respect for him?  The first few seasons conveyed a bad image for Rick Hunter although I still appreciated the show.  If it wasn't for the gorgeous Stepfanie Kramer as Dee Dee McCall, I would have given the first two seasons a miss.  So, simply put, when Rick Hunter got more respect, the show became more respectable.  And enjoyable.

I hope season four will come out soon.  This is where the show just keeps getting better and better.  We Hunter fans need to keep voicing our concern for this show or they may just scrub the whole project altogether.",1179792000,8,1375,4.5
2431007,4,B000BO0KLO,"Of the three seasons of Hunter released, so far this is the best.

2431008,4,B000BO0KLO,"Hunter was one of the last successful crime show television series that did not try to be an accurate (or more accurate than normal)police procedural.

Former LA Rams football player Fred Dryer plays Rick Hunter, a tough-as-nails LA homicide detective partnered with DeeDee McCall, an undercover specialist.

The two were as Mutt and Jeff as you can get, and the plots and acting could be downright silly, but it was a fun and entertaining graduate of the Aaron Spelling school of crime drama, and as such, it has its own intrinsic value which is one judged properly by the common TV viewer, not highbrow TV critics who would recommend program that Hunter fans wouldn't watch it they were paid to do so.
