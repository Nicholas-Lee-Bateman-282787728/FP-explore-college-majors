7983470,2,B00008G8QV,"One of the first things I did was to open the DVD on my computer, so I could print out the music I expected to find.  There wasn't any.  Instead, at the beginning of the DVD they tell you how to BUY the written music.  This is pretty outrageous when most music instruction comes with PDFs, or booklets that allow you to read along with the visual instruction.

The only way to learn the licks is to is to constantly rewind stop, play, go back,  - you get the idea.  Since you also are playing a guitar at the time, manipulating your laptop, or DVD player isn't exactly a snap.

The instructor is OK, but tends to leave out some fingerings as he demonstrates the licks, assuming you'll remember it from a previous bar.  This gets a bit annoying until you figure out his modus operandi.

As several others have mentioned, you don't get all of the music taught either.  The only reason I gave this two stars, instead of one, is that with the extra effort mentioned above, you CAN learn the material, assuming you're a reasonably competent guitarist to begin with.",1283472000,,1060,4.44559585492228
7983471,2,B00008G8QV,"When the product description states ""Each riff and solo is played up to speed"", my expectation was that each riff and solo of these songs is examined in their entirety on this CD.  My expectations were FAR from met.  On most of the songs, only the intro riff and perhaps a mid-song riff is explained.  I have only watched about 1/3 of the DVD so far, but none of the solos have been shown yet.  This DVD will only be satisfying to the utmost beginner that is not interested in playing whole songs.  I wish I could get my money back.

To further infuriate me, this (and every Hal Leonard or Cherry Lane DVD I own) will not play on my home computer's DVD drive.  I've contacted customer service and they have not replied or tried to help.  All other DVDs I own will play in this drive.  The DVDs will play in my home theater's DVD player, though.

For the record, the other Hal Leonard and Cherry Lane DVD's I own are:
> Metallica: Guitar Legendary Licks 1983-1988 (Cherry Lane/Hal Leonard)
> Metallica: Guitar Legendary Licks 1988-1997 (Cherry Lane/Hal Leonard)
> The Best of the Allman Brothers Band: Guitar Signature Licks (Hal Leonard)",1179964800,,1137,4.529411764705882
7983472,3,B00008G8QV,"I bought this DVD thinking that the instructor teaches the entire song.  Wrong!  While the instructor breaks down solos and riffs which makes it incredibly easy for people to play, only fractions of the song is explained.
I guess it's cool to be able to play signature riffs and solos, but I'd like to learn how to play the entire song.  Only being able to play like a minute out of 6 minute Metallica song isn't worth buying a $20 DVD.
And the fact that the instructor does a wonderful job of explaining makes it worse.  With his instructions, I could be playing any Metallica songs in no time (both James' and Kirk's parts)  But, that's not the case here.  It would've been the perfect way to learn hard Metallica songs.. but they stopped way way short of accomplishing that goal.",1069632000,6,782,4.51063829787234
