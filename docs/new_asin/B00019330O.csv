1979182,5,B00019330O,"ABC and Hallmark should be commended highly for putting forth this outstanding program. Dreamkeeper is absolutely brilliant in every possible way. Production, direction, writing, acting, effects, cinematography, etc... everything was remarkable. It was inspiring, moving and educational all at once. I cannot recall ever being so moved by ANYTHING on TV. This show has restored my faith in television programming, and I know many other people feel the same way. I hadn't seen or heard any advertising about Dreamkeeper but just came across it as I was channel-surfing; it stopped me in my tracks and kept me enraptured throughout the conclusion last night. Amazing.
This is a must-own along with any possible tie-ins, i.e. resource & educational materials, as the content is of such a high caliber.
I hope the ""head honchos"" over at ABC and Hallmark get this message and know how much this program meant to alot of people.
For what it's worth, I am a ""regular white guy"" but my wife is Cherokee and African-American and we both were held speechless throughout the entire program.",1072742400,239,1079,5.067415730337078

1979234,5,B00019330O,"Words fail me, actually. To be able to watch a Storyteller make his stories come to life in such a beautiful powerful way that's just inspiring and wonderful.........what can anyone really say.  The stories are funny, amazing, memorable. Got to laugh though, at the first story about this young man on his first Vision Quest. The fellow goes up the Mountain to fast and pray. Then, he has these INCREDIBLE visions, and yet is too young to realize how blessed he was to get them.  He thinks nothing has happened. He fails to understand that, yes, he DID get a vision. And, not just one. So the kid goes back down the mountain in tears.  Then, an old man tells him , and in such a unique way, to go back.
But, that's not so much what this story is even about. It is more about a young man who is not ""connected"" to his roots, his family; and how he finds his way back to a place of power and balance. At least, for me it was that way. Hope you take the time to sit and enjoy this. Its a once in a lifetime super special movie.",1523232000,,1024,4.135678391959799

1979317,4,B00019330O,"My kids have watched this film countless times, and it is a favorite of our family.  The storytelling sequences are especially, beautiful and I disagree with the amazon reviewer who called the special effects cheesy - I am normally a snob about special effects but in this movie I find them really interesting, and unique.  They add the dreamlike, otherwordly element to the storytelling, and the use of what looks like stop-motion or reverse-motion, and shuttery, flickering camera-work is especially effective at capturing the idea of giving a visual dimension to the spirit world.  Some of the sequences are just so darned cool, and I've never seen film-making quite like it.  Get off your high horse and appreciate how original this movie is!  Really, it's gorgeous, and a totally unique creation in the history of movies.

You can tell this film was made with love, and the storyline is sincere, funny, peppered with wisdom and grounded in reality.  I appreciate the way they show some of the realities of Rez life and don't gloss over the struggles.  It's a very human film, that spans a broad spectrum of history and human experience.  The breadth of this work cannot be understated and I feel it is truly a remarkable achievement.  The stories have such good messages, and there's some really good lessons in there, I feel it's good for the kids to see and learn from.  I was especially moved by the story of the Chinook woman who sacrificed her life for her people, and by the story of Tehan, the red-headed man who was adopted by the Kiowa and fought for them.
Some of my favorite actors are in this movie, and it's great to see them all on screen together.  Gary Farmer is great!!!  The lead actor is the weakest of the bunch, in my opinion, and has some amateurish-sounding moments, which bugged me at first, but I'm starting to appreciate that he's not the world's best actor, because he seems like a real person. And the fact that he acts and sounds like a real teenager helps this movie feel more human and easier to connect with than most stuff on TV these days.

Much love for everyone who took the time to make this film!",1439856000,,2139,4.624338624338624

I am not a big fan of CG in film but in this case it added so much.  But what struck me the most was how universal the Native 'myths'/stories are.  I am sure Joseph Campbell would agree.

As far as the quality of the special effects go, I just use my imagination while watching.  The same way I use it in books.  Long treasured books fuel my imagination so much that when a movie is made of that book, the special effects can never measure up to my imaginings.  It is a shame that in this time, more families don't take the time to tell tales of truth or fiction with lessons held within them.  It helps to bond each other as well as instruct.  So, Dreamkeeper is a keeper in my video collection.",1419638400,,645,4.2727272727272725

I am an old man now, but it has always been the story tellers in my culture that keeps our culture alive for those who want to learn, and everything in the natural world will teach you about your own life if only you take time to 'listen' as Chief Dan George talked about.

She lived most of her life saying she was french, which I thought when I was a kid..One day she took me aside an told me she  was  Part Indian to but keep it a secret. When I told my sister later she wouldn't believe me, but later she did find out in the ancestry site..I have always been drawn to Indian ways, especially with Animals. Watching this movie made me realize how much I am connected to their beliefs. This Movie should have been in all the theatre's but I never saw it.

I remember when in school all the books were about how savage the Indians were, never showing their great power, spiritual beliefs an how they give back to the Earth..If the white people followed that thought, we might have a better Earth..not stripping it bare.

It speaks volumes not only about the Native-American culture and their stories and philosophies, but also about the state of consciousness all men are in. Each tale has so much truth and character in each of them, and they all weave seamlessly around a story about the struggle we all face to empower ourselves, forgive ourselves and those who have forsaken us, and just find ourselves - to accept the place we are along the journey so that we can take our best step forward.

1979428,5,B00019330O,"DREAMKEEPER is a beautiful and powerful film.

Shane, a 17-year-old Lakota Sioux who owes money to loan sharks and has all sorts of other troubles on his mind, travels with his 87-year-old grandfather from their South Dakota reservation to an inter-tribal pow-wow in Albuquerque, NM. Along the way, Grandfather spins a number of old myths and tales from the Lakota, Cheyenne, Mohawk, Kiowa, Blackfoot, Chinook-Salish, and several other tribes that teach Shane a great deal about how to approach this life and what follows it. The myths themselves are wonderfully played-out in realistic non-animated fashion, and the 180-minute film is evenly divided between Shane & Grandpa and the stories Grandpa tells. The costume design and settings in the myth sequences are as good or better than those in even the very best western films: DREAMKEEPER truly puts you there among the Indians. The cinematography and acting are also splendid throughout. Amazing special effects too.

This film could have turned out really sappy, but despite the Hallmark, it's not. The realism is stunning, especially for a made-for-TV affair. Some violence and generally disturbing material, but no serious gore or sex/nudity. Grandpa's tales include everything from the ribald ""What's this? My balls for your dinner?"" to the transcendent ""Quillwork Girl and Her Seven Star Brothers.""

It's very good, gave it 4 stars instead of 5 partly because there's one part of the movie in which there's a stereotype of a white ""new age-esque"" character who's an ""Indian wannabe"" as the grandson character calls him. This felt cliche and stereotypical, even though there's a parallel between that modern day character and an adopted red haired white man in a Native American tribe in the 1800s. Also, the scene in which a vehicle filled with gorgeous, young Native American girls stops on the side of the road to offer a ride to the stranded grandfather, grandson, the wannabe and a band of gang-bangers was reminiscent of a similar scene in the movie Dumb and Dumber - just doesn't seem plausible.

Hmmm, maybe. I liked that this movie tells stories from a variety of Native American tribes' oral traditions, because it helps to keep the stories going and it helps to educate people who don't know these stories. I especially liked the parts with John Trudell and Gary Farmer playing the trickster figures, Coyote and Iktomi. Those guys are great.

1979542,5,B00019330O,"Wow... ""native at heart"".. did I write that?  That sounds new agey in and of itself.  But let me explain.

Native friends I have absolutely LOVE this movie, ranking either at the top or darn near the top of their favorite movies that are completely about/starring native americans.  This has replaced Windwalker as everyone's all time favorite.  They universally rank it above common IMDB rankings, like a 9 or a 9.5 at worst.

White friends I have, who feel an affinity for real (not new agey, I don't have any new ager friends) native american ways, or an authentic respect for native cultures, or who have been doing red road ceremonies for years (not new age stuff either) absolutely LOVE this movie, and really really get it.  Those I ask to rank it suggest an IMDB 9 or 9.5 level ranking at worst.  Those I have shown it to once always ask to see it again not long afterwards, which they don't ask for nearly anything else.

Normal mainstream types who mostly like explosions and action heroes will not like it nearly so much, will not get some of the subtle humor (they are stone faced while the indians in the room are rolling), won't get subtle references to rez life, will not understand the cultural subtleties, will just in general not ""get it"" or understand why indians think its so great.  They might rank it a 7 at best but don't know why we think it's a 9 or 10.  It is still good, it's just what is so great about it is not 100% cross-culturally compatible.

Whether new ager types would like it more than normal mainstream types I couldn't tell you, this review is mostly for the 'skinz...  but I suppose they would like it more than average, but more because it's trendy to like nonmainstream stuff and not because they get it at all...

The ""amazon.com editorial reviewer"" definately has no clue and you can ignore it if you are native or native at heart.  The weak points are totally forgiveable and are overcome by all it's strengths.  Just buy it and you won't be disappointed.

If you only see one ""indian"" type movie (not a hollywoodized 'dances with wolves' or 'last of the mohicans', but I mean where the leading main stars are indian as well instead of some sidekick or some white person raised by indians type of story) this is the one you will want to get bar none.  Nothing else (short of Windwalker) even comes remotely close that i've seen so far.

The special effects are a bit of an acquired taste... it's neat to see a ""modern"" movie with native themes, but if you show it to grandpa on the rez who never has seen TV from the last 15 years he might be a bit disoriented.  :)

One thing I find interesting is that it is incredibly authentic.  Almost too authentic.  Brief sections of ceremonial songs and prayers which I was told by some elders that are not ever supposed to be recorded, played or sung/said outside of proper ceremony are in there at least in part.  I don't remember seeing this in any other ""indian"" scenes in movies that I remember, the actors were always smart enough to fake what they knew wasn't meant to be recorded normally or just stuck in hey yah hey yah hey yah.",1350950400,,3124,4.449912126537786

The movie depicts many aspects of the level of poverty that exists modern day.  The movie captures the challenges and difficluties that exist within the Native culture present day and shows the struggles within the family of passing on the cultural and family history to todays youth.  Dreamkeeper is a well put together film that covers numerous aspects of the sacred connection of the Native plains people and their culture.  The director made great effortstime in researching and talking with Native people to capture and depict many of the concepts and characters within the film.  One cannot make a film of this caliber without the help from the Spirit world.

1979558,5,B00019330O,"Good effort from director, writer, cast and crew to provide an entertaining yet authentic storytelling experience particularly in portraying the stories in a variety of creative cinematic ways; in scene location; prop authenticity and acting naturalness. Particularly creative were the stroboscopic time lapsing effects with coyote in enhancing his stories. The few special effects used were just enough to enhance those stories without overwhelming the imaginative oral aspects. Also, good to see was a tie in with contemporary on-and-off-the-res life and a few of the problems as well as accomplishments of native peoples.

In the interviews I found it refreshing to see acknowledgement paid to the universality of humans in the tradition that we have the swimming creatures; the flying creatures; the walks-on-four creatures; the walks-on-two creatures as our categories vs. the artificially narrower and divisive national, cultural, religious and ethnic categories created by organizations and groups. I would even take it one plane higher and just say we are all one category - life or just carbon creatures. There is more genetic, biological and personal variation between individuals within a population than between populations of peoples.

I'm from Australia so our local indigenous channel (National Indigenous Television - NITV)aired this movie, and from the moment I watched it I was hooked!

The truly fascinating thing I loved about the movie was the stories being told by the grandfather, and being passed onto his grandson. I like the fact that they were stories passed on from generation to generation, and that kids these days (well maybe not all but most)really don't know much about the stories of their culture or the traditions of where they came from.

On the surface, it strikes you as a bit unoriginal:  troubled teen takes a road trip with a parent/grandparent/sibling/etc and the two find a bond of love that overcomes a conflict introduced at the outset of the story. Yeah ... it's been done.
But not quite like this.

All the actors in this movie, with one stereotypical exception, are Native American. I have worked in the IHS on different reservations over the past several years and I can tell you that the movie delivers a fairly accurate portrayal of the heart and soul of the protagonists and their families. To me, it was very touching to hear the stories and see the movie play out. There are timeless truths that reach the heart of all people, regardless of heritage.

There are cliches, and moments you can see coming a mile away, but overall it is put together in a package that is fascinating, heartwarming and even informative.

This film caters to the mainstream in more ways than can be described here.  Primarily, the stories all deal with subjects that are visually appealing and acceptable to mainstream American audiences.  For example none of the stories push the envelope in  any way, whenever there is a love story it is between a man and a woman in the same age category when in fact in many indigenous cultures love and marriage between people of different ages groups were very common as marriage was not for love nearly as often as the film would have people believe.  Also love for clan or blood was not prevalent when in fact in many tribes you would do a lot more to sustain a clan or group than you would for a spouse who belonged to another group or clan.  Also in many cultures a third gender category existed and none of this was shown at all.  Another thing the film did was to adhere to what people already believe about Native Americans.  For example, why did the story need to be centered at Pine Ridge to show the poverty that some Indians live in.  Why couldn't it be centered around the Mashantucket Pequot territory where there are mini mansions and well off Indians. Anyway in all I did not enjoy this film though I praise it for being a film that utilized Indian people in many roles from behind the camera to the actors.",1313884800,3,1495,4.384057971014493

On the way, the grandfather tells stories, stories that reflect on the life of his grandson and the values that he should realize in his own life.  The stories are based on various Native American tales and interweave the mundane with the magical.

It has great special effects, but more than that is it is a story that should inspire and give a small glimpse into a different worldview.

Spider and Coyote are my favorites in this; two tricksters trying to out-trick each other and the only one who wins in the end is (spoiler alert) Spider's wife.

All of the stories interweave and center around the grandson learning his true heart, his true value, and where his true power comes from.  Highly recommended for teens and for those who are asking themselves some of the same questions.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dreamkeeper is an excellent film! Of 88 speaking parts, 87 were Indian, about time.

The camera work in this film is outstanding. The stereo cameras provide an almost
perfect match to the workings of the human eye---these facts from the special portion of the DVD.

Perhaps the most meaningful thing to me, are the legends from the Old Ones of our tribes. Have Cherokee blood from both paternal and maternal sides of family and Creek from paternal bloodline as well.

Some of our relatives were taken to Oklahoma to reservations there. The herding of our people to these pens broke the spirits of many. This, in my opinion, led to the reservation conditions we see today.

The stories are listed in other reviews here and will not duplicate the excellent efforts put forth there. The fact that Indians are shown telling the legends of our people is very meaningful.

Thank you to Robert Halmi,Sr and Jr the Producers;
John Fusco, one adopted into the Nation, for his Script;
Director of Photography Jon Hoffin;
Music by Stephen Warbeck;
and the directing by Steve Barron.

This is and outstanding work by so many of the Real People. Recommend it highly.",1296950400,5,1291,4.89908256880734

Being a eight or sixteenth cherokee but full blood in my heart something no one can take from me i must say one of my favorite stories is the one about the kiowa who accepts the texan as their own. Because whats in ones heart is more important than the colour of ones skin in a sense. The way the colours are done are spectacular offset creating a beautifully enchanting otherly world. Watch for john trudells appearance as coyote it is spectacular. I also must mention that while great morals can be learned from the stories i find them very funny too as i have always found the humor of the first nations people to be.

1979602,5,B00019330O,"If we feel our two-footedness, we are all natives on this planet.  The richness of this perspective is uniquely spoken and palpably felt through these oral stories drawn from multiple Native American traditions.

One of the most convincing strengths for me was that 87 out of 88 actors/actresses were natives. Their consultation, as well as that of other native professionals  throughout the film, was actively saught and heeded seriously.  This diligence truly shows.  Profoundly so.  I was particularly intrigued when an elder and member of the acting team confirmed later (under added features) that the ""white"" film director consistently gave priority for their own way of expression rather than requiring scenes and lines be done to suit his preconceived vision.

I am not a ""native"" in the sense this term is used here.  Still, even when I felt like a guest, I knew I had been given a privileged glimpse of an ancient people's treasures, interwoven skillfully with modern life.  I felt transported between past and present native reality, but more importantly into their ""other worlds"" of spirit, dreaming and sacred myths.  While permitted to travelling along with a grandfather and his troubled grandson on this red path, I gained more connectedness and reverence.

Although the visual effects were indeed fascinating, for me the power of these stories would not have necessarily required such cinematics.  At times I was almost a little overwhelmed/distracted by them.

The myths speak for themselves.  I can easily appreciate that native peoples might encounter even deeper significance in them than I have, as an outsider.  I am glad if this is so.

The stories that Grandfather told were all carefully chosen to illustrate a point to his angry grandson about an event in the young man's own life.  I could see the universality of the themes, so I question why this movie is not really ""for a white audience"" as some reviewers had mentioned.  Indeed, my friend paused the video after the hilarious Coyote/Spider story, and told me an almost identical one from Europe.

I tell stories from around the world because I wish to show respect for diversity by learning more about a people.  One of the best ways to do that is to learn the stories from that people.  The more tales that I learn and share with others, the more I realize the universal human experience we all share.  So many stories from around the world share common elements, and even similar plots.  If you trace the stories' origins, you know that while some stories migrated with contact among people, some stories evolved convergently--independently of each other across time and distance, but are still the same story.

This beautiful movie is for EVERYONE, not just those with American Indian blood, because of the shared experiences we all have.

But I think we are all writing about it because it is so thrilling to us, we have to say something!

The 17 year old grandson is in trouble in this modern life, and rejects his grandfather's devotion to ""the Red Road"" and the stories which form its core and guidance, as irrelevant to the sad state of Native American existence. The family has been abandoned by his father, a victim of alcoholism, and suffers from the shame of it. (Remember the abandoning father theme of Smoke Signals as well?)
The old ways didn't give strength and guidance to his father, what do these stories offer him, except a cruel reminder of the weakness and irrelevance of his cultural background?

During a journey to transport his grandfather the storyteller to the big Powwow, and their pony to sell there, grandfather tells 12 stories from different native cultures, all extremely thrilling, exciting, and colorful, and each one addresses a different concern of the grandson! By the end of the film, grandson has become a hero who saves the gang members who were trying to kill him, causing them to reconcile with him; learned respect and generosity toward the dorky white boy who wants to become a wide-eyed participant in Indian culture as he idealizes it; has met and reconciled with the father he was hating, who is likewise clued in by grandfather, and promises to return and walk the Red Road; has found pride in himself and his background; has learned to love and respect Grandfather and make the role he chose his own; and sees himself as a seeker of the Red Road on a vision quest. And the pony will not be sold!

Along the way, Grandfather tells Shane the stories of the Native peoples.  This is not just the Lakota stories from Pine Ridge, you also have the story of a young Multnomah Indian who sacrifices herself for the health of her people, the young Cheyenne quill worker who becomes Starwoman, stories of both Spider and Coyote, the two tricksters.

The imagery on this 2 and a half hour special is amazing.  The directors have gone to a lot of trouble to create a mystical landscape for the stories to take place and the work far exceeds any 'made for TV' label I've ever seen.

This is also a groundbreaking event.  Of 88 characters, 87 are played by Native actors.  The Native traditions, including patterns of speech, are respected in this story.

There is no prettying up the reality of life on the rez, of the disaffection, rejection of tradition of the younger generation.  It really gets across that we never know the whole story and that forgiveness is self-liberating. The final scene gives such HOPE that ethnogenocide is not a fait-accompli: there are still elders who can pass the wisdom, the language and the traditions of all the First Nations spread across Turtle Island and STILL suffering under continued attempts to make them vanish.",1210204800,3,790,4.880597014925373

1979678,5,B00019330O,"This is one of my most favorite movies of all time! I love Native American history and lore. This movie allowed me in to view the intimate and wonderful tradition of passing down ""story-telling"" to ones decendents.

Most movies on Native American lore cover one story, but this movie does an excellent and breath-taking job of covering many stories, all the while following along one main lore(Eagle Boy), along with the present day situation(with the grandfather and grandson). The interaction between the grandfather and grandson was very endearing and entertaining and had me laughing out loud in some parts. Having a teenage son myself, I related to the grandson's attitude and enjoyed watching the change that took place in his heart.

The presentation of each story, within the story, is so excellent that it could stand alone as a movie in itself. There are at least a dozen mini stories, and they are all excellent. My favorites being about Thunderboy, The Kiowa Texan, and The Done Pony. Each story had an excellent message and I highly recommend it just for that reason alone, as it is great for every day life lessons to children and adult alike. The feeling and emotion of the entire movie is inspirational!

I watched it in one sit down and couldn't take my eyes from it.
This film is mesmerizing and teaches lessons that have left a great impact on me as a person, as well as my spirit. It makes me want to get in tune with who I really am as a person and where I've come from. It stars all real Indians and gives me an understanding of their people. This is the work of art that can teach us as people to be accepting of our elders and ancestors. We must show our respect and honor them because without them, we would not exist. I get the message and others should, too. I'd recommend this movie every chance our get. The Indian storytelling should be heard all over the world.

1979717,5,B00019330O,"This film was a true find. I had not heard of it before, but I was so pleased to find Dreamkeeper. There have been so many eloquent reviews before me, so I will just add a few things.

This film will appeal to many people with varied interests:
Fantasy film audiences will enjoy the legends and well-done special effects, bringing to life stories that rival the great tales of ancient Europe or the Middle East.

Those who want to see a film that portrays native peoples in a positive, affirming way will enjoy this. Dreamkeeper tries to be honest about modern reality as well as giving the viewer an appreciation of past traditions and their relevance to today.

I love the bonus features that the DVD medium provides. I enjoyed the production featurette and the director's audio commentary track. I would have liked to have either a second audio commentary from the author, John Fusco, or have him included in the commentary track with the director. I wanted to know more about how Fusco felt about the story that he wrote and the film, actors, etc. This was a missed opportunity.

Also, a widescreen presentation (instead of full screen) would have been preferable, and subtitles. How about a new, director's cut version with some more goodies and deleted scenes?

Finally, I think this is a film that has a long future ahead of it, as it gets discovered by more people. Because it was a made-for-cable TV miniseries, it did not get those important reviews from the theatrical release film critics, or the festival circuit exposure. As a result, it will take longer for this enduring work to find its place in the film world.",1188777600,5,1628,4.698245614035088

The stories that grandfather tells are brought to life with real actors, sets, and special effects. I thought it was all nicely done.

I wish there were more movies out there that show that there is no such thing as ""American Indian culture"". American Indians have always been a diverse group of people with very different languages and traditions, scattered across a vast continent with very different habitats.

Although, naturally, ""Dreamkeeper"" can only scratch the surface of the many different Native American cultures, it manages to convey the message that these different cultures exist and that everybody can learn from other peoples' myths and stories - if they are willing to listen.",1186963200,4,733,5.3652173913043475

1) If you've never been particularly moved by Native American stories, this movie may change that.  It's hard to describe, but within the fantastical context of this movie, which uses the present day and the past equally to great effect, the Native American stories ""make sense"" in a way that has never happened to me before.  The Amazon reviewer complained about the over-reliance of computer generated effects, but I disagree and think the effects were used judiciously and atypically enhanced the stories.

2) This movie is great for families.  My eight-year-old boy and five-year-old girl were enthralled, but I would recommend splitting up the three hour movie into two viewings.  My youngest was crawling all over me by the end, but I just couldn't turn the movie off!

3) This movie is worth owning.  You'll want to see it more than once.

4) I actually did not realize this was a TV movie until I came back and read the reviews.  The production values are amazing and no expenses were spared that I could see.

1979747,5,B00019330O,"""I want to tell you a story as it was told to me.""  This is the thesis of this wonderful three hour film.  A grandfather tells his grandson (who has forgotten how to be an Indian) the Native American legends.  The grandfather is a dreamkeeper who orally keeps the legends, culture and history of his people alive through stories passed down. Shane is a modern day 17 year old on the Res (the actual Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota) who embraces the gansta lifestyle.

By the end of the story you'll discover like Shane has that each of us as to walk the road of life (Good Red Road).  Shane story is parallel to perhaps an ancestor of his named Eagle Boy who lived a thousand years ago.  They are both on a Vision Quest (unknowingly to Shane).  One of the many wonderful things about this film is that it doesn't just focus on the Lakota Nation legends, but many others for a more fuller experience.  I will focus on a few major legends below to give you insight on the film:

1. Legend of Bluebird Woman and High Horse (Lakota):  This is truly a treasure and the first of the many legends told by grandpa to hopefully help Shane resolve his conflicts (internal and external).  You learn that a man's worth is in the good deeds he does.  A real woman wants to be won with honor and not simply given away.

2. Legend of She Crosses The Water And The Thunder Spirit (Mohawk): This is almost like a dream world in the sky.  This is truly visually stunning and another legend about love.  You'll learn that we must always honor and respect the power of nature.

3. Legend of Tehan, The Red-Haired, White Kiowa (Kiowa): This is based on an actual story of a white man who became a true Native American.  You will realize that a man's heart and spirit are more important that what blood he comes from.

4. Legend of Dirty Belly And The Dun Pony (Pawnee): This legend is truly inspiration, because it teaches that you should never count anyone out, because the least can have the ability to be the greatest.  This legend has a message of faith during hard times.

5. Legend of Quillwork Girl And Her Seven Star Brothers (Cheyenne): This has to be my favorite legend, because it's simply dreamy!  This is a creation story about the Big Dipper, showing us how dreams can guide us.  We all should follow our dreams to realize our true destiny in life!

6. Legend of Raven (Chinook): This is a story of unselfishness, which Grandpa obviously tells Shane to inspire him to stop being so selfish and to start thinking about others.  One must always think of community first in times of hardship.

7. Legend of Ekuskini And The Ghost Hunter (Blackfoot): This is a story about letting go and leaving the ghost of our past behind so we can embrace our future.  We must all let go of our parents, while keeping their love deep within our hearts.

Shane Chasing Horse is a dynamic character, because he is not the same person he was at the beginning.  We can learn a lot from our elders, and Grandpa makes sure that he tells Shane the importance of the stories in the sacred oral tradition. This film is a cultural treasure and the production value is as good as any blockbuster.  I learned a lot about Native Americans and it made me proud to experience part of my own culture.  After seeing this film no one will look at Native Americans again as those guys only used as props for John Wayne to resolve his conflict and become the the hero.  In this filmatic masterpiece you'll discover many Native American heroes who will inspire you to walk the Good Red Road!

The bonus soundtrack is a treat as well, and for the price this dvd is a bargain!  You will be truly enlightened and entertained!  To be  honest, I watch this film at least five times each year and I never tire of it, because it always leaves me wanting to know more about the Native American legends that helped shape a great people.

1979764,5,B00019330O,"The other reviews do a good job of singing the praises of this movie, so I just want to add a few things:

Dreamkeeper does a brilliant job of weaving the traditional stories of the past with the present.  Even my 12 year old commented on how well the stories were connected to the main plot, and brought together at the end.  The Amazon reviewer who implied otherwise was obviously not paying attention or not as smart as a 12 year old.

Also, the special effects are outstanding.  My boys who have been raised on Playstation 2 games and Star Wars movies were blown away.  They LOVE this movie.

Finally, this is the only movie we own that is loved by every kid that views it here.  We have had several parents borrow it only to end up buying their own copies.  What makes this movie so special is that it is not patronizing or condescending.  While I agree that it was not made for white people, anyone with an appreciation of other cultures will  enjoy this movie immensely.",1142208000,26,977,4.402234636871508

1979767,5,B00019330O,"The three hour length made me put off watching this DVD (it's actually from a television miniseries), but once I started watching, the time passed quickly (although I did watch it in two segments).  At the risk of sounding crass, it reminded me a bit of some of the Disney efforts of the fifties to teach children folk tales and legends (Paul Bunyon, Johnny Appleseed, etc.), only the tales and legends are from the Native American tradition, and very authentic, as I understand it.  The director makes use of modern techniques to create special effects (helpful as some of the legends involve supernatural effects, such as a rock turning into a bear).

This is basically a road trip story, with an old Lakota man telling stories to his grandson as they drive from South Dakota to an All Nations Pow Wow in Santa Fe, NM.  The young man is in trouble with a gang, so he's anxious to get out of town.  The old man is trying to get the young man back on track, but instead of lecturing him, as they travel, he tells the young man stories from their tradition that make an appropriate point.  When the young man starts to talk of his love for a woman (how he got in trouble to begin with), for example, his grandfather tells him a story from the tradition about a young man who loved a woman.  The stories are fascinating and like all good stories, express universal truths, for example, that being able to have whatever you want doesn't lead to happiness.

I know the DVD cautions about children, but honestly, I had trouble thinking of ANYTHING in this film that might be objectionable.  I guess there was one story that someone who was prudish might have trouble with, but given television these days -- including commercials -- I wouldn't hesitate to rate this as ""family viewing.""  I expect I will be rewatching this in the future, and the stories -- and their lessons -- will stay with me.",1134086400,48,1891,4.535294117647059

The stories are timeless.  If you want to feel something stir inside of you... to feel a bit more understanding and connection, then, please, see this film.  It was good from beginning to end.

1979769,5,B00019330O,"Let me first preface this by stating that I am one of those people much more interested in contemporary Native American issues such as water/ land rights and language retention than I am in the spirituality stuff. The way I see it is that for every European like me there are probably a hundred that are awaiting a wizened medicine man to tell them all the secrets of the universe and bless them with long life...blah, blah, blah.....

Taking this into account I was a little bit cautious about 'Dreamkeeper' which I received as a Christmas present from my sister. How very pleasantly suprised I was. The story starts on the Pine Ridge Reservation and a young man - Shane - being co-erced by his mother into taking his Grandfather hundreds of miles away to the All Nations Powwow in New Mexico. Shane reluctantly agrees and so the real story starts.

Along the trip the Grandfather - a storyteller - relates stories that are relevant to Shane in understanding events happening in his own life and that of some of the people they meet along the way. I won't divulge too much else about the story except to say that Shane meets his estranged father and there is a reconciliation between the two. By the end of the trip Shane has also 'found' that there is more to himself than he believed.

The stories presented are great in terms of detail to attention, covering a broad breadth of Native American cultures and never neglecting humour - love the ugly woman in the cave. The acting performances are exceptional; Eddie Spears who plays Shane makes an excellent stroppy teenager (I work with them on a daily basis!). Sheila Tousey is as excellent as ever - has that woman ever acted anything less than superbly?

I cannot recommend this film highly enough, it explores so many issues and emotions like hope, faith, desire, anger and in a simple yet meaningful way. It will appeal to most new-ager types, but given my own respect for the film it will also appeal to a much broader spectrum of people.",1131408000,50,1996,4.614084507042254

However, my curiosity got the better of me and I bought it and put it in he dvd-player, turned down the lights and began my three hour viewing adventure.  I was immediately aware that this was actually a well made movie.  The story centers around a native indian and his grandson.  The grandson who is beginning to take the wrong road, but is fortunate enough to spend time with his grandfather to spare him that journey.  The grandfather who is a story-teller takes his grandson on a day's journey and it is during this journey and during the stories that we see a plethora of tales of life as an indian, from 100 years ago to 400 years ago - tales of magic, triumph and good morals as well.

What I have learned from studying Native American culture is that there is much for all of us to learn from their stories and the spirits. The way I handle life has changed since my study of the culture and although my skin is white, my spirit has been touched by stories from the elders and movies like Dreamkeeper.  This made it difficult to read reviews for this movie that said how white people cannot possibly understand it, that it was not made for whites to see.  Exclusion like that encourages cultural division and that's too bad.  I REALLY liked the movie and would recommend it to any race.",1125100800,14,759,4.4

1979785,5,B00019330O,"Three days later, and the powwow music is still playing in my head...

If you love fantasy movies and want to see something really different, Dreamkeeper is a must-see.  Native American legends are so generally little-known that the film's story-telling segments have the feel of a completely original fantasy world.

The stories are told within the framework of the modern-day story of a young man on the run, who agrees to take his storyteller grandfather to a powwow in New Mexico. The outer story is enjoyable--the grandfather delivers some pretty funny lines with a wonderfully deadpan expression--though not really that different from what I've seen in other Native American movies.  Still, it's got gorgeous scenery, a gorgeous young man, a funny grandfather, and horses, so who can complain?

The legends are fun and exciting, with some fairly interesting special effects.  Actors tend to deliver their lines more as if they were declaiming than acting, but I assume that's part of the storytelling style.  The grandfather tells several stand-alone stories, and the epic story of Eagle Boy, told in many parts through the film.

There wasn't any section or this show which failed to grip, interest or entertain. This is the most fun I've had in front of the TV for a long time.

Plus, it comes with the soundtrack CD included!!! You can't get a better deal than that.

One other note--Pulfrich type 3D glasses (black and clear eyes, not red-and-blue)work excellently with many of the scenes.  The snake is even cooler in 3D!

1979786,5,B00019330O,"Dreamkeeper brings to light the harsh reality of the Native American peoples. The ""white"" world is drawing the young people away from their traditions and history.

Many Peoples have only had an oral tradition both of the Nations history and Teachings. As the Elders leave the Wheel and return to Creator, their Stories are lost, and thereby the teaching of a new generation.

It points out both that the Young are turning away from the Elders Teachings and a potent reminder that the Young are our only hope for the future.

Youth are turning to gangs for a sense of belonging, to drugs and alcohol as an 'escape' from Rez life. This movie can help them see that they have a strong heritage in their Blood that they can be proud of, that their People are a great people and they can also be proud of them.

Hopefully to remind them, as was said by the Grandfather in the movie:  ""There is no I, there is no Me, in our language!"".  Life is about the People as a whole/clan/family.

The stories cross several cultures, and are not just from the Lakota's or Tetons as a whole.  This story is great and ABC and Hallmark should be commended for thier efforts to bring cultural diversity and the diverse culture of America into the forefront.

This movie, as well as others such as Medicine River and Smoke Signals, are great ways to introduce non-natives into the cultures, humor, and lifestyles of the original Americans, and the special effects and wonders introduced is much better than the concept of indian princess and the ethnocentric movies of the past.",1113696000,11,846,4.929577464788732

Where was his CD headset and attempt to flee? I believe there is an endless amount of material untapped from Indians about creation, courting, history, and kinships, but nobody's listening or wants to listen. I predict the film industry will at some point be forced to tap into indigenous and other minority cultures in film simply because looking at whats on TV and in theaters now, they have run and are running out of material! The film could have done without targeting the Kiowa as the bearers of white adoption. Many tribes took enemy captives, but the Kiowa resisted white encroachment the most, are credited with some of the highest casualty rates on whites on the southern plains, and didn't back down to the US Army. That particular story was a cheap shot!

The Amazon reviewer --Jeff Shannon, should be removed from critiquing movies he has no knowledge to critique. This is not the Wizard of OZ. There is power and wisdom, compassion and ageless stories that can heal and promote positive change when applied where they are respected.

Also, the portrayal of natives in mainstream media is embarressing and offensive (yes, even in this day and age--things actually haven't changed that much since the days of John Wayne).  We need to honor and remember the great contributions native people have made in their communities, and in their traditions that were alive long before other groups of people immigrated here.

Scratch the attempt part out, and that would be a more accurate depiction of this wonderful and amazing film.  From the storyline to the carefully recreated costumes, this film is definitely worth buying.  I think it's especially positive for young people, as many could find a connection with the modern storyline as well as with the traditional legends.  I've recommended this movie to all of my friends Native and non-Native, and look forward to enjoying it with my children some day.",1080432000,3,560,5.188888888888889
1979836,5,B00019330O,"The movie told my lifes' story! I like Shane...had wondered off the ""Red road""...my teacher & I worked hard & I finally got back on track! The movie also painted a picture of how I think on a daily basis...that is...looking at situations from both worlds and finding the solutions and resolutions. When people have never experienced ""visions"" and ""vision quests"" it's hard to explain them! Many salutes to those who keep ""showing"" the true ways of my people! I was born in the Black Hills of SD...the ""Paha Sapa""...some scenes in the movie brought back many memories. Thanks to ALL!

1979859,5,B00019330O,"A really great formatted movie I have seen in years. This movie I watched on TV and it kept me bound to the TV as I also recalled reading about a couple of the stories they put on film. That of the Great Serpent Iya that I have recalled him as. It is a great honor to now have a movie as great of many that has been filmed, also of Crazy Horse, Dances With Wolves, and many others that depicts the true nature of Native American Life in the now as well as the past. It is so sad the way the Native Americans were treated then and the life they live now due to the past, it is movies like this that brings a true meaning to the now Native Youth as well as the elders and young adults. Hoka Hey to DreamKeeper, Mitakuye Oyasin (We are all related). With Wanbli Eagle), we soar, to Hehaka (Elk) we love and defend, to Mato (Bear) we stand strong, and to Tatanka (Buffalo) we will strive for our rights of a True American. Native Pride, Heart and sole. Too all, Mitakuye Oyasin

1979861,5,B00019330O,"I felt sad and regret that this beautiful culture shown to us by the Native American is disappearing from our midst and what a crying shame that would be if we were to lose the beauty of their stories, their morals and their cultural backgrounds.  Let us just hope that this culture can withstand the bombardment of the white man and maintain its own beautiful background and its own wonderful outlook on life, love, beauty and people in general.  It breaks my heart knowing how much we lost when the white man tried so hard to totally decimate these wonderful people.  May the prejudice toward them finally end and may they start sharing w/us more of their wondrous ways of life.  I only wish I could have lived among them many, many years ago before the coming of the white man.  Keep your spirits and your culture.  You need them and we need them for ourselves also.  We can surely use all the help we can get.
Thanks to all who make these wonderful movies about these incredulously spiritual and intelligent peoples.",1072915200,7,1020,4.571428571428571

1979863,5,B00019330O,"We got up out of the middle of Pirates of the Caribbean to see the second half of this.  I really didn't expect to see such a great production again on television, but, then again, I see from the other reviews that Hallmark had a hand in making this.  From ""Decoration Day"" to ""Dance with the White Dog"" Hallmark makes memories for everyone and now they've given us ""Dreamkeeper"".
I was glad to see many familiar faces in this film from my all-time favorite movie ""Dances With Wolves"".  These actors' dedication to telling the story of their past should be given priority, I feel, over all the other races that have come to call America home if only because all of us ""others"" tread on the dust of these people as we move about in our  daily lives.
As time goes on we're being made aware of the huge cultural loss that we're experiencing as this race quickly disappears.  I see my own Greek-German heritage slipping quickly away even as I try to help my wife teach our kids about her Hispanic heritage.  The heat has been turned up under the melting pot and I'm afraid not much will remain in the next few decades to pass on.",1072828800,11,1125,4.384615384615385

1979865,5,B00019330O,"Amazingly I was able to catch the whole movie on tv and I though it was wonderful. The writers were able to take a collection of legends that are terrific on their own, and weave them together in such a way as to create a masterpiece.
I though the acting excellent, and I can't say there was even one actor that I remember thinking poorly of. It was truely a good movie and I would recommend it for all who are fascinated with Indian legends as I am.",1072742400,3,450,4.125
