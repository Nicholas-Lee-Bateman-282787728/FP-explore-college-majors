368256,5,6301802497,"A radio company is desperately trying to find a young girl to be featured on their new program, Little Miss America. Rebecca (Shirely Temple) and her Uncle Harry (William Demerest) go to the company to audition. After hearing only a few measures of Rebecca's song, Tony, the talent agent, knows Rebecca is perfect. He rings down and says that's enough, and the man  thinks that Tony doesn't like Rebecca. But Tony had every intention to hire her. He goes crazy trying to get her before she leaves the building, but doesn't.
He goes down to his farm, and little does he realize that Rebecca is living right next door with her Aunt Miranda!
When he finds out, he wants to set her up for the broadcast, but Aunt Miranda doesn't want Rebecca to be a radio star.
This wonderful movie is hilarious and innocent Rebecca is a very memorable character! This movie is wonderufl.",972691200,9,868,4.636363636363637
368257,5,6301802497,"Rebecca (played adorably by Shirley Temple)  knows how to charm her way into everyone's heart. In this classic, she auditions for a radio show.  Tony (the show's talent agent, played by Randolph Scott) realizes she is  perfect for the job.

Unfortunately, there is a misunderstanding and  Rebecca is sent away.  Since her stepfather feels he has done all he can to  coach and guide her, he decides it might be best if she went to live with  her Aunt Miranda at Sunnybrook Farm.

Rebecca loves the farm and is soon  helping to look after the animals, getting into mischief and meeting the  neighbors.  By some strange twist of fate, the neighbor turns out to be the  show's talent agent.  Now, the only obstacle is her persnickety aunt who  doesn't want her in the radio business.  Her stepfather also reappears to  see if he can cash in on Rebecca's newly found fortune.

There are some  great slapstick moments and plenty of one-liners.  Rebecca also tries a  tiny bit of matchmaking, sings, learns to tap dance, makes lasting friends  and even bakes some cookies.  After all, she is very self-reliant!

Shirley plays a talented orphan, Rebecca Winstead, who wins a radio contest, and despite some twists and turns in the plot, eventually finds stardom in New York.  The film closes with Shirley and Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson in a great tap routine to Raymond Scott's hit, ""The Toy Trumpet.""  William Demarest, Gloria Stuart, Jack Haley, and Randolph Scott are among the featured character actors in the film.

This film - in both B&W and colorized versions - is a must-have for Temple fans of all ages.  It features English fake stereo and mono soundtracks, a Spanish soundtrack, and subtitles in both languages.  Enjoy.

368404,4,6301802497,While the movie was good  it unfortunately is a bit formulaic in nature a song and some dancing by Shirley in the prototypical situation a money grubbing agent (in this case her uncle ) looks to make piles of money in the big city using Rebecca's (shirley's talents) to do so. Shirley does her usual cover up for the greedy relative/agent and then auditions for a harried casting agent who misunderstands the program sponsor has decided that Shirley has the right stuff for the radio program and sends her away  mistakenly believing that the girl who auditioned  just prior to Rebecca (Shirley Temple)is the child chosen for the radio program. when he discovers he has made a mistake he begins to frantically search for Rebecca who has been sent immediately to Sunnybrook farm to live with her  spinster aunt.

Randolph Scott, Jack Haley, William Demarest and the people who played the Aunt, the Radio Program Director and the Demarest's evil wife were totally inept.  Their acting was terrible.  Even Shirley, who was way past her prime in this has annoying moments...how many times does she say ""I'm very self reliant!!""....uggh!!

Another thing, she seems to be trying to hard to be cute and loveable, which by this time she had outgrown.  She was 9 going on ten or maybe even 10 going on 11.  She was no longer the adorable little tyke of ""Bright Eyes"" or ""Baby Take a Bow"".  What makes it even worse is that she sings a medley of her earlier hits ""Lollipop"", ""Animal Crackers"", etc. which adds insult to injury.

There are some cute songs in this but the plot is threadbare which is not helped by the bad acting.  I remember watching this movie as a child when they would rerun Temple movies on Saturday mornings and I didn't remember it being this flimsy.

Its not a good movie by any means.  Not a bad one either...just mediocre.  I wanted to shake the daylight out of those stupid, bumbling characters in the film who were trying to act like ""The Three Stooges"".",1304380800,,1234,4.509009009009009

368432,4,6301802497,"Despite it's title, REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM is not a re-telling of the classic Kate Douglas Wiggin story.  This is one of the most charming films that Shirley Temple starred in, and I enjoy revisting it often.

Temple plays Rebecca Winstead, a young radio singer who is discovered by talent scout Tony Kent (Randolph Scott).  There's only one hitch: Rebecca's frosty Aunt Miranda (Helen Westley) who isn't about to have her niece go into showbusiness.  You can pretty much guess the rest...

This little gem runs at a brisk pace and is filled with warmth and humour.  Temple gets to share the screen with some of her regular cohorts (Helen Westley, Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, Jack Haley, Gloria Stuart and Randolph Scott).

The musical score includes such delights as ""An Old Straw Hat"", ""Happy Endings"", ""Come and Get Your Happiness"", and ""Parade of the Wooden Soldiers"".  Temple also gets to sing a medley of her greatest hits.

The cast also features Phyllis Brooks, Slim Summerville, Ruth Gillette, William Demarest, and Dixie Dunbar.  Look out for a young Mary McCarty, playing Florabelle, the singer with ""mike-fright"" in the auditions scene.",1178236800,2,1151,5.074468085106383
368433,5,6301802497,"Shirley Temple earned great fame as a child actress in Hollywood; and this movie shows us why. Shirley Temple sings and dances her way through many numbers, including ""An Old Straw Hat"" and an olio of her classic melodies including ""Animal Crackers In My Soup"" and ""On The Good Ship Lollipop."" Temple shines like no other child star ever did; and we will have to wait a very long time to see another quite like her.

Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm stars Temple as a young child named Rebecca Winstead who has incredible talents; she even wins a radio gig as ""Little Miss America"" just based on her being herself when she sings. Of course, even a musical needs something of a plot; therefore there's a misunderstanding and Shirley and her stepfather (William Demarest) go away thinking they lost the talent contest. Her stepfather takes her to Sunnybrook Farm which is run by her crusty old aunt Miranda (Helen Westley). Miranda agrees to take care of Rebecca on the condition that the stepfather never returns. Fortunately, though, instead of being sad about her very different new environment, Rebecca is an upbeat, optimistic kid who takes to the farm rather well.

Things begin to snowball much faster when it turns out that just by pure coincidence (oh, sure) the man who ran the talent contest lives just next door to her Aunt Miranda's home. At this point in the film many questions arise: Will he finally recognize that Shirley is the girl who won the talent contest? Even if Shirley is recognized, will her Aunt Miranda let them put her on the radio? And what happens when her stepfather ultimately hears of all this fuss going on? No spoilers here, folks; you'll have to watch the movie to find out! There are some funny moments using slapstick, too.

The DVD offers us the motion picture in both black and white as well as color. This movie was originally filmed in black and white and then colorized. The DVD lacks extras except for some clips from Heidi and Little Miss Broadway.

The cinematography shines with the characters being filmed very artistically within the confines of the screen and the choreography of the dance numbers is terrific. The finale, ""The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers,"" showcases Shirley Temple and Bill Robinson dancing wonderfully and this will thrill you!

Overall, I highly recommend this for Shirley Temple fans; and people who want to watch classic movies with their children will enjoy this film, too.

Enjoy!  Great job, everyone!!!",1178150400,16,2474,4.83451536643026
368434,5,6301802497,"Of all the Shirley Temple movies I have watched, this showcases her talet the best. Sweet storyline for ""America"" Littlest Sweetheart.""",1174348800,,135,5.476190476190476
368435,4,6301802497,"Shirley Temple's movie career was in its peak years when she made this movie that capitalizes on her best characteristics.  Though she says she is eight years old in the movie and she even looks like she could be eight, in reality she was about ten years old.  Shirley was a veteran actress who was cute and charming with little effort.

This movie primarily shares the title of the book with the same name.  Beyond the title, the movie is quite different from the book.  Rebecca Winstead (Temple) is the ward of her stepfather, Uncle Harry Kipper (William Demarest, a veteran actor who would later be a regular on ""My Three Sons"").  Unfortunately, Uncle Harry has issues with keeping a regular job.  Good things appear to be happening when Shirley auditions and gets a job with Tony Kent (the late great Randolph Scott) as Little Miss America.  Because of a misunderstanding, Rebecca and Uncle Harry left the studio and disappeared, putting Tony Kent into serious trouble with his biggest sponsor.

Uncle Harry takes Rebecca to her Aunt Miranda (Helen Westley, who appeared in several other Shirley Temple movies) and dumps Rebecca.  Rebecca meets her cousin Gwen Warren (Gloria Stuart, who decades later would appear in one of her most memorable roles as elderly Rose in the blockbuster ""Titanic"") and Aloysius (Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, in his third appearance in a Shirley Temple film).  As Rebecca tells us many times in the movie, she is self reliant and she manages to charm everyone she contacts, even grumpy Aunt Miranda.

Rebecca accidentally encounters Tony Kent, who is still looking for her.  It turns out that Tony has a house right next to Aunt Miranda's house.  Unfortunately, Aunt Miranda is against Rebecca appearing in a radio broadcast and Rebecca, Gwen and several others have to go to great lengths to get Rebecca out of Aunt Miranda's house and into Tony's house for her first radio broadcast.

The radio broadcast is successful, but too successful because Uncle Harry is listening and decides that he wants Rebecca, or at least her money.  We also learn that Uncle Harry has a new wife, whose only desire is money.  Things become a little tearful when Uncle Harry shows up with a lawyer and court papers that prove that Uncle Harry is Rebecca's legal guardian.

Will Rebecca escape Uncle Harry's clutches?  Will Gwen and Tony end up happy?  What about perpetually grumpy Aunt Miranda?  Will she see happiness?  Many answers await you!

I enjoyed this movie.  I thought the movie had a good balance of comedy and pathos, and I thought the movie had good pacing.  However, I know that younger audiences, who are accustomed to faster-paced movies and have different standards for comedy, may fail to find this movie funny or interesting.  You may want to keep the differences in era in mind if you are buying this movie for a younger person who is unfamiliar with Shirley Temple.

Shirley Temple is perfectly charming in this movie.  She sings.  She dances with Bill Robinson, who was a phenomenal dancer.  Shirley is cute and charming and even though portions of this movie seem contrived and unbelievable, it is easy to ignore the plot problems because of Shirley.  Shirley Temple fans will enjoy this movie, as well as Randolph Scott fans and Gloria Stuart fans.  I strongly recommend this movie as one to watch if you are just starting to appreciate Shirley Temple.

Enjoy!",1173484800,,3399,4.865853658536586
368436,3,6301802497,I bought this for my three year old niece - she thought it was boring.,1168300800,2,70,3.7333333333333334
368437,4,6301802497,"It's almost strange to look at these ""Shirley Temple films"" at various stages of your own life. You view them differently as you grow older. It also depends, I suppose, on how familiar you are with 1930s films. Many of them are dated, especially with the language, songs and comedy of the period, so you have to acclimate yourself.

After a decade away from her films, I viewed this one recently and found both good and bad things about watching it. The positives, however, far outweighed the negatives and I believe this is one of Shirley's more entertaining efforts.

After starring now for about five years, it's obvious how comfortable she had become in her roles. She looked extremely confident in here and why not? She had her act down pat. She even performed one song that was medley of her hits from previous movies. Yup, she was a veteran at the ripe old age of 10 and at the peak of her career in the 1930s.

In this movie was the normal mixture of characters, meaning a crabby old woman, a nice young couple that you wanted to see get married, a couple of wacky cronies, good 'ole Bill Robinson nearby....and the regular happy ending. The wholesome and pretty woman in here was Gloria Stuart. She was the same lady  in 1997's ""Titantic.""  The leading man was western star Randolph Scott and the old biddy was Helen Westley. The goofballs were Slim Summerville, Jack Haley and William Demarest. This was one of the better casts in the Temple movies.

The only drawback, really, was the total lack of credibility, scene after scene of things that made no sense...such as an entire orchestra and chorus setting up inside a quiet farmhouse and the occupant (Westley) unaware of it??!!! There are a number of scenes that just leave you shaking your head in amazement. So....you just have to suspend all belief and just enjoy the comedy, Shirley's tremendous talent and appeal, and all the pleasing songs and dances in here. That done, you've spent an enjoyable 80 minutes.

Made during the Depression years when Americans desperately needed to feel good, Shirley Temple was perhaps the best at filling that need. Some 70 years later, she still ranks as the greatest child entertaining in United States history and her films still put a smile on one's face. She still makes us feel good.",1145491200,20,2292,4.7007481296758105
368438,5,6301802497,"Rebecca of Sunnybrook farm is a delightful and perfect movie. It is so good you can watch it over and over again without even getting bored. Shirley Temple is absolutely charming with her cute songs, lovable charm and happy songs. I love the songs she sings in this movie. They are happy and have great tunes. Also Phyliss Brooks does a wonderful job of singing. Along with the rest of the cast who each warm your heart. This perfect movie is full of comedy, cuteness and class.",1121299200,2,478,4.505747126436781
368439,3,6301802497,"I don't think I read the book when I was a kiddie, but when it comes to this particular title I really can't remember. But from what I understand, this Shirley Temple movie is extremely different from Kate Wiggin's classic novel for young readers (and those young at heart!).

I found the colorization a tad annoying, and plan to look for a b&w copy. It's a sweet movie, as all Shirley's movies are, and also so nice to see the young, beautiful Gloria Stuart. (Just in case you don't know, she played the very old lady in the 1990's ""Titanic."")

It's so hard to rate these movies on a scale of one to five. On its own merit, it's deserved of the 3 1/2 stars I indicated in the title. But compared to most of the garbage showing in the movie theatres today, this movie deserves 50 stars.",1096675200,10,786,4.304054054054054
