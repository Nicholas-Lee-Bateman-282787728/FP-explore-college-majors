The wisdom contained in it, however, will probably not be understood nor appreciated by those who have little regard for the Bible or its wisdom but for those who take God seriously and believe that every word of the Bible is God-inspired, finding this book was like finding a buried chest full of valuable treasures.",1517529600,,380,4.588235294117647
