8718996,1,B00YSFZB70,"I love True Blood, but I made the mistake of waiting to purchase the series until it was over. The first two seasons are being redistributed, and have been made in Mexico. Unfortunately, those discs are very poorly made. On the newer, nicer TVs, the images are distorted around the edges with a little blurring. The pictures just aren't crisp.  I already had the first two seasons, made in Mexico, and I ordered from Amazon in the hope that they wouldn't be the redistributed versions. I sent them back because they were. I was lucky enough to get seasons 3, 4, 5, and 6, in the well-made versions.",1460160000,,598,4.537037037037037
