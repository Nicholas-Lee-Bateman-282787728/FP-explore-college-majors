8446803,5,B004XDY9ES,"I found out about this documentary thanks to amazon.com and my interest in WW II movies and documentaries.
This is the story of a son who did not get to know his father who died as a bomber pilot in WW II when he was shot down by a German pilot...
Very recommendable.",1361664000,,267,4.056603773584905
8446804,5,B004XDY9ES,"The story is told in a factual and straight-forward manner but the pain and sadness is clearly evident as the documentary unfolds. There were no winners in this conflict such as when the German fighter pilot describes the grim details of the aerial combat and shooting down of the Allied bomber over Berlin. As the son (who was only 2 months old at the time) hears the firsthand details of his father's death, it is an unforgettable moment. This is a story of family, courage and war told in a poignant manner which I highly recommend.",1308096000,,535,4.583333333333333
