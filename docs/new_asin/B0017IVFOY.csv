Keeping this extremely short I personally enjoyed this film much more than I ever expected. As usual nudity was a little over the top for my taste but the film keep it from becoming sleazy which is something I personally have never seen in a B-rated horror film before. The nudity wasn't crucial at all for the film and could of done with out I feel but keeping it from becoming over the top sleazy and using it as a true catalyst to the films sequences to distinguish between the powers of heroin and what a dealer can make an addict of this drug easily come to terms with doing and finding love with someone who is in the same ordeal as you was well used to distinguish these roles. The horror of this movie was secondary and not so much the main focus of this film. I feel it was actually well constructed for the most part. If the horror would of been left as solely psychological this would of really turned out much better. Also if they would have excluding a scene where a DVD is given to a main character in person and just had the DVD mysteriously arrive at the one main character's home this would of been a better angle.

As for the second film, Bizarre and Deadly Perversions, I fast forwarded through 99.9% of the film. What I did get out of it was that the main protagonist is mentally ill, with a penchant for sexual deviance as to fondling unconscious women, which after divorce from his wife, leads to breaking into homes of single white females and using chloroform to subdue them unconscious and then disrobe them, molest and touch them, and then pose them nude and still unconscious and take photographs of them. I personally can't get into any type of film like this. This would also be including most rape revenge film, including but not limited to, The Last House On The Left (1972), and remake in 2009, I Spit On Your Grave (1978) (remake in 2010, and I Spit On Your Grave 2 from 2013 and 3 from 2015).",1446076800,,2085,4.387596899224806
