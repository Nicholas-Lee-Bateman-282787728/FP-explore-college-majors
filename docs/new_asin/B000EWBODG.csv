8216509,3,B000EWBODG,"In a welcome act of cinematic sado-masochism, this little pit bull of a movie sinks its jaws into the neck of the fortunate viewer and simply won't let go. In early 1980s London, Scotland Yard and the IRA are agreed on one thing. They each must get their hands on a criminally inclined machine operator before the other side does. Why? Because this elusive alchemist, aptly named The Magician, can, with a little help from his trusty printing press, transmute paper into 20 pound Bank of England notes of the highest funny money quality. As the 3 sides (Bobbies, Paddies & Paperboys) maneuver...

Presto! Chango! Deus ex machina!

The Magician's accomplices come to believe they've stumbled onto an outsider with the ability to usher them out of this contentious triangle and into Happy-ever-after-ville with their pockets lined with legal tender. One of them, like some Iron Age prophet, even remarks, ""This man! This man has dropped out of the sky. We got lucky!"" Is he Messiah? Nemesis? Or, as detective George Byrne (Clive Owen) first believes, just another ""wanker""? The FBI helpfully confirms that he's, at worst, a nothing special U.S. citizen visiting London on business. His day job? Selling time-shares. Although, as the action plays out, he's shown to have such a pathologically arbitrary attachment to the truth that he really should be selling used cars.

His name is David Katz, and in him writers Jeff Pope and Terry Winsor have fashioned a character worthy of the best of David Mamet's ""confidence cinema,"" i.e., HOUSE OF GAMES, THINGS CHANGE, HOMOCIDE and THE SPANISH PRISONER. As portrayed by Jay Acovone he's this pit bull of a movie's alpha pit bull who seems to have no problem at all squaring every circle as he runs circles around all competitors and collaborators. He's the real magician.",1151020800,7,1812,4.953947368421052
