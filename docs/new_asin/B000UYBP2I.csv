8215598,5,B000UYBP2I,"A good introdcution to Beowulf for children. The cast is first rate and the script contained many alliterative passages, so it maintained poetic integrity with the original. I used it with a third grade theater class.  I told them the story orally first, then showed the video. The initial preparation was important, since the poetic text could be a bit difficult to follow without preparation, but worth the challenge.",1517356800,,419,5.072463768115942
