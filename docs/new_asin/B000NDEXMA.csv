8177247,1,B000NDEXMA,"Buyers beware!  I got this DVD because I thought it would contain some new and exciting episodes of Bob the Builder.  As it turned out, it only has old episodes - Muck Gets Stuck - Lofty to the Rescue plus the one where Bob fixes Farmer Pickles hay bale shed and the one where Pilchard gets stuck in a tree after a storm.  I wrote to Hit Entertainment about the DVD, and told them I thought they were intentionally misleading consumers.  They pointed out that the wording on the DVD says a ""new release"" NOT ""new content.""  But no where on the DVD is it clearly written that these are old episodes - no mention of classics, children's favourites.  They don't even have the names of the episodes on the DVD cover.  If you are looking for a new DVD, this isn't for you.  If you don't have the episodes mentioned above, then it's not a problem.",1189641600,17,841,4.312101910828026
