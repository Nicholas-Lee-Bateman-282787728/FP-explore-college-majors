6817826,4,B00PLYU46A,"The distributor didn't do this wonderful little film any favors by retitling it from its original title of ""CHRYSALIS"".  While zombies/infected do play a role in the story, it is really a refreshing story of love and adversity, challenges and strength, and of starting over when it seems that all is lost.

This was shot entirely on location in Gary, Indiana - a truly post-apocalyptic landscape which is both eerie and awesome. The production value is simply over-the-top. The acting is very good and the actors are just real people - not Hollywood prom kings and queens with a smudge of dirt on their nose. The grit, the loneliness, the fear, and the perspiration are palpable.

Those who expect a bust-a-zombie-a-minute splasher movie will be disappointed; those who are willing to look into the depths of storytelling will be pleasantly surprise by this little gem.",1423526400,10,869,4.979310344827586
6817827,3,B00PLYU46A,"Originally titled ""CHRYSALIS"" (retitled perhaps to prevent it from being confused of the film adaptation of the Ray Bradbury story of the same name), it's a dystopian ""neo-Adam & Eve"" type story involving what the ""long-term"" effects of a zombie holocaust might look like -- though technically what we are dealing with are not quite ""zombies"" in the classic sense, but are more akin to the ""infected"" of ""28 DAYS LATER"" with Romero-esque human flesh eating ghoul tendencies.

We're introduced to a world where it's been a couple of decades after the catestrophic events which laid the world waste, both as a result of the global plague itself and of the world governments' desperate response in attempting to deal with it -- all of which we learn about through the introduction of a mysterious third character who had sifted through the rubble of the old society trying to uncover any information that would help piece together the grim details of what led the dwindling handful of uninfected survivors to be reduced to scavenging through the ruins of a long collapsed civilization. Even though this newly encountered individual whom they'd offered circumstantial protection is met with initial skepticism, the promise this new person brings about several scattered bands of other uninfected survivors who are rendezvousing at a designated gathering place and are intent upon reclaiming, fortifying and rebuilding the city sounds like an appealing idea to them, but in order to make the journey they not only have to deal with physical ailments which occasionally hamper their efforts but must also become ever more vigilant against the exponentially increasing onslaught of the infected which suddenly seems to spring out of nowhere virtually overnight, which causes more suspicions to be raised.

There's a certain gritty realism that's to be experienced with this movie; the fact that we don't have to stare at impossibly ""beautiful"" people whose make-up jobs might make them look, at worst, as if they'd just woken up out of bed really helps to give this movie that convincing edge, and the acting is fairly decent as well. But ultimately, some may come away from this one as not really being all that inspiring, whereas others may find it quite a refreshing take on the subject matter that's drizzled with a fairly good deal of originality, thus making this one either a ""hit"" or a ""miss,"" depending on the audience and how much they hope to expect from its premise. As a recommendation, this is definitely one which should be given at least one viewing consideration just to see where any further opinions about it may stand.",1422835200,7,2631,5.018306636155606

6817832,4,B00PLYU46A,"again not an A-1 movie but it did keep my attention to the very end ,I actually hope they do a  follow up continuing with the birth of the child in question.",1435622400,,157,3.90625
6817833,5,B00PLYU46A,Great service good product,1435363200,,26,5.75
6817834,1,B00PLYU46A,"I am not surprised by someone rating this a 4 or 5. Guess they haven't seen the dead series or anything with zombies. Nothing changes. All after your brain and the only way to kill them is blow their head off. Now, how many times can you do it. Our government trying to make us stupid is succeeding.
But of course that's just my two cents worth. I try to expand my brain rather than rot it.",1426982400,,390,4.077922077922078
6817835,5,B00PLYU46A,"Great Movie! I liked the original name of Chrysalis instead of Battle Apocalypse but in no way does the new name hurt the integrity of the movie. Well acted, Well directed, and entertaining. I have seen a lot of zombie/post apocalyptic movies and was very pleased with the unique story line.",1425254400,3,291,4.7254901960784315
6817836,5,B00PLYU46A,Loved this movie - saw it when it was titled CHRYSALIS and am purchasing this DVD to support the cast/crew.,1425254400,2,107,4.4
6817837,5,B00PLYU46A,"I HATE horror/zombie movies and I must say that I loved this film. I saw it when it premiered in Chicago and was pleasantly surprised by the acting and the depth of the movie. I like the original title of ""Chrysalis"" than this new one of ""Battle Apocalypse"" though.",1424822400,2,265,4.428571428571429
8688686,4,B00PLYU46A,Movie has a good plot and is well acted. Takes place 20 years after initial zombie apocalypse and the struggle to survive is real. Loved the ending!,1509062400,,148,4.518518518518518
8688687,5,B00PLYU46A,"I am always looking for good zombie/horror movies ,there are so few of them around. This movie was excellent. The acting was good, the plot was good ,there was nothing about this movie I did not like.",1492041600,,200,4.4324324324324325
8688688,5,B00PLYU46A,"For a low cost post apocalypse movie, well done.  Movie touches on many issues of post society living that usually get glossed over.",1489536000,,132,4.739130434782608
8688689,1,B00PLYU46A,"Poor acting, low budget and poor storyline.",1471824000,,43,5.285714285714286
8688690,2,B00PLYU46A,"OK.  For a zombie film devotee it's an interesting concept, somewhat lacking in execution.  I found it a decent addition to my collection, but it mainly for the fanatics and the unwary.",1464998400,,185,4.75
8688691,5,B00PLYU46A,"The Walking Dead. Fear the Walking Dead. Dawn of the Dead. Night of the Living Dead. All have one thing in common. They are some of the best zombie movies ever made. World War Z is another honorable mention. My personal favorite is a tie between Dawn of the Dead and The Walking Dead TV series. This movie is about the end of life as we know it and how surviving humans are ""the walking dead"" almost as much as the zombies! If you like the Walking Dead, this movie is highly similar and should be a favorite of yours soon. Rated R for violence and gore.",1463184000,3,553,4.177570093457944
8688692,5,B00PLYU46A,"Yes my name is A Zohimsky, no I am not Adrienne Zohimsky, one of the makeup assistants in the movie. I am however her older sister and we just happen to have the same initials.  That being said, of course I would be critical but you know this turned out to be an awesome movie.  I was extremely surprised at how I was glued to the TV throughout the entire movie and I do have a hard time making it through most movies.
Long story short, I highly recommend!!!!!!",1461974400,,461,4.168539325842697
8688693,1,B00PLYU46A,Not a good movie at all,1456099200,,23,3.0
8688694,3,B00PLYU46A,"The cover of the DVD and title are deceiving. While reference is made to a past cataclysmic confrontation this is not portrayed in the movie. This is a low-budget horror flick (no special effects) where the emphasis is on the main characters and the psychological effect isolation, fear, violence, endless drifting and foraging has had on them.  The infected humans are not really zombies (as in walking dead) but do have much in common with them. That said it is worth viewing, having more intelligent dialogue than most zombie movies.",1450828800,2,536,4.955555555555556
8688695,1,B00PLYU46A,"Booooooooo. Get the bad rotten tomatoes to throw at my cheap screen.

It seems to be a trend that low budge movies are getting buffered by fan boys and people attached to the film to make it appear to be a quality film. It's pretty frustrating as a movie watcher to think you are going to watch a quality movie only to end up with this horrible, low budget, low quality movie.

I get this movie was made for $35,000. I love a good low budget movie. But I said good. This was the antithesis of a good well done low budget movie.",1449878400,,527,4.106796116504855
