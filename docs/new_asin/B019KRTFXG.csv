I famously hate any kickboxing workouts but the one on here (i think it's called Foxing) is fun and hard! I love advanced workouts and this one fits the bill. Yes, it's expensive but they are worth it!",1452988800,5,331,4.1875
8745494,5,B019KRTFXG,"I have all of the previous Fusion Fitness Dream Body workouts, and this is another great set!

There are six workouts in all, and they are a mix of cardio and toning. What I mean by that is that the instructors don't separate out the cardio drills from the toning drills.  For instance, in Gorgeous Guns, you'll be doing squats while doing shoulder flyes, and in another part of the workout you'll be doing static lunges while doing triceps pulls with the band.  Because the workouts mix both, you'll be getting a cardio effect in every workout, while also getting your toning in.

I've found that the Dream Body mix works really well for my hourglass shape; when I do their workouts, I get leaner and more toned.

To do the workouts, you'll need:

*  a yoga mat

*  a pair of two-pound dumbbells

*  a resistance band

* a playground ball

The Dream Body workouts are always a fun mix of plyometrics, cardio, toning, and barre work, and these new workouts are a lot of fun.  They may be a slight step down in intensity from the previous Dream Body workouts, but they are still tough and have left me gasping for air.

Although the workouts are billed as being thirty minutes each, a few of them are longer.  Here is what you get with this set, which comes in a thick jewel case that holds all six DVDs:

*  Hard Core  --  30 minutes and taught by Brooke; focuses on the core muscles

*  Batalicious  -- 38 minutes and taught by Amy; focuses on tabata drills

*  Dream Booty -- 34 minutes and taught by Sadie; focuses on drills that target the backside; they call it ""butt camp"" for your booty

*  Foxing -- 31 minutes and taught by Erica; focuses on kickboxing drills, with some toning for your larger muscle groups

* Gorgeous Guns -- 44 minutes and taught by Darby; focuses on sculpting exercises for your arms and back

*  Hustle HIIT --30 minutes and taught by Joscelyn; focuses on high intensity interval training (HIIT) drills where you push all out and then recover, before moving on to the next exercise.  This is my last-favorite of the set, but I still find it to be a tough workout.  At one point, Joscelyn leaves the front of the room to walk around, and when she comes back, she's completely off-count, and yet expects us and the background exercisers to switch up what we're doing to keep up with her; on top of that, her microphone is so loud that at times she's barking orders at us (and I truly don't mean that in a mean-spirited way -- I have to turn down the volume on this one when I do it since she yells so loudly).

In each workout, there are four background exercisers, who follow along with the instructor.

The DVD set also comes with a twenty-one-day rotation guide and meal plan so you know how to use the DVDs.  The rotation calendar includes both the two workouts you'll be doing that day (which includes two workouts from this set or one workout from the set along with a thirty-minute jog or walk twice a week), along with the foods you should be eating each day.

For the meal plan, there are seven different options laid out for you.  For instance, the rotation might call for Meal Plan B, and then you'd eat all of the meals that are spelled out in another page of the booklet for that day.

If the frantic pacing of the previous Dream Body workouts was too off-putting for you, this new set is probably a better since it feels a little more slowly-paced.  Also be warned that, just as with the previous sets, there is no mirror cueing, which can sometimes make it hard to follow along.

This is another fun and fabulous Dream Body set, and I look forward to more releases from the Sweat Lab series!

UPDATE ON 2-21-16:  If you're interested in trying out the style of these workouts to see if they're for you, search for ""Sweat Lab"" on YouTube.  Fusion Fitness has been posting short workout segments (that are different from the material on this DVD set), and they range in time from about three minutes to about ten.  Doing them will give you a feel for if you ""click"" with these workouts or not before you invest in them.

Also, I wanted to add how effective these workouts are, even in their shorter length.  When they first came out, I just tried each one once since I was doing another rotation, but I've been using them for the last two weeks, and I can tell that I'm losing weight and toning up.  I've been using one Sweat Lab workout per day, and then following it with thirty minutes of a Barlates Body Blitz workout.  The combo is working really well for me, and the cardio in the Sweat Lab workouts is so intense that I find I don't need to do a one-hour session of cardio.",1451260800,10,4622,4.369718309859155
