4892068,5,B005TMY00K,"Just finished watching ""The Magnetic Monster"" released by Kino Lorber under license from 20th Century Fox.
Ivan Tor was a unique blend of movie producer and writer who created hard and realistic science fiction movies based on the known scientific facts of his era.
""The Magnetic Monster"" is the first of his Office of Scientific Investigation trilogy of movies which centered around the daily activities of A-Men - G-Men who investigated scientific crimes.
When the local branch of the OSI receives a call from a frantic hardware store owner that all the clocks in his store have stopped at exactly 9 p.m. in the evening and that every metal object in his store has suddenly become magnetized, two A-Men are sent out to investigate and discover that the sure of the unexpected magnetism can be traced to the research lab of physicist who has rented one of the upper offices in the same building of the ground floor hardware store.
The two A-Men discover don radioactive gear and discover that the physicist is dead from advanced radiation poisoning and that his colleague has disappeared.
It turns out that the new element that they have created is a magnetic monopole; and the it absorbs all forms of energy, causing it to double in size.  A thorough scientific investigation shows that it will destroy the Earth unless it can be fed an overdose of energy to destroy it.
""The Magnetic Monster"" does echo some of the concerns raised before CERN went online; and is a tense doomsday thriller about rouge scientists, who unchecked, can unleash chaos.
Strongly Recommended!
Five Stars!",1467590400,3,1583,4.906716417910448

4892073,4,B005TMY00K,"When this movie came out, the so-called Atomic Science was murky in the public minds.  As in WAR OF THE WORLDS, a Geiger Counter was still a ""ticking time bomb"" to post-WWII Americans.  Scientists were both respected and feared, with good reasons.  Einstein was still the term for a genius.  We could forgive the errors in the movie's publicity and artwork because most people didn't care, but wanted to be thrilled.  It worked then, before annoying film-school ""Historians"" were born.  You can still enjoy this movie, as long as you skip the horrible Audio Commentary.  Unless of course you WANT to throw up.

The movie deserves 5 stars for its remastered HD, which cleans up most optical trash except for an occasional vertical line.  I saw it in the theater and on TV more than a half-century ago, and now it looks great.  HD does magnify the shortcomings of old movies that had just a couple of special effects guys working in their garage.  ""You know,"" as the Historian always says, it takes a long time at the end of today's movies for the effects credits to roll.  (Not many stay in their seats, unless there is a reward at the very end.)

But ""now back to the"" headache-inducing Audio Commentary, as the ""Film Historian Derek Botello"" would say several times in his hoarse voice between coughs and irrelevant audio inserts from the actual movie.  (Timed when he had nothing to say.)

This has to be the worst, most incompetent, error filled, plagiarized commentary I have ever heard.  He obviously reads straight from old science fiction encyclopedias.  Only one autobiography is actually properly attributed.  He jumps all over the place, back and forth, about the actors and director(s), and often provides short giggles on what he finds hilarious. He uses the phrase ""you know"" in most sentences, making you wonder if he knows.  When the explosions stock footage appears at the end of the movie, he admits to not knowing if it was from the German film GOLD, which I think is like a church pastor not knowing if something is from the Old or New Testament.

 He might as well have read the box liner for his misinformation.  For examples:  ""a young scientist's experiments with a new radioactive isotope cause it to double in size every twelve hours, a nearby town's existence is threatened by the deadly radiation.""  1) The scientist who actually created the isotope was in his 60's and not played by Carlson.  2)  The doubling cycle was 11 hours not 12.  3) The threat was the enormous burst of magnetic attraction, not particle radiation.  Three strikes, you're out!

If you want to subject yourself to the Audio Commentary, take an anti-nausea pill.  The Historian is critical of ""the fact the monster is not seen,"" but goes on to say that the main character's eyes might be harmed by looking into ""a periscope"" at it.  He is pained by ""kind of having unintended consequences"" and by ""proactive morality kinda like most science fiction.""  He uses phrases like ""at the end the tide is turned"" and avoids ""blowing up half the planet.""  The planet is NOT going to blow up if the isotope is permitted to keep cycling;  the planet might have become unbalanced and flown out of its orbit.  At the end of the movie, he jokes again:  ""What kind of realtor would have a sign like that?!""  The sign simply said that the house was for sale.  What an awful mistake!  Imagine the panic as the Director tries to get a real house sign, fails, and has to have a painter do one. Time is money, and Historians forget that.  Studios have Standby Painters now.

Not satisfied by trashing just this movie, the Historian claims that Carson died as a skeleton in the movie he directed, RIDERS TO THE STARS, which was actually the fate of another character.  Does the Historian ever really watch these movies?  I quickly became convinced that this narrator was only watching the movie out of the corner of his eye.  How many times can anyone say 12 hours instead of 11?

The Magnetic Monster was NOT ""born of electricity.""  The isotope was created by bombardment of a lower element with alpha particles for 200 hours, making Serranium (which probably is like the similar L. A. street name).  Historians do not know nuclear physics?  Not taught in film school?

The most ""works okay"" comment that is NOT okay:  stock footage mismatch with the new footage.  He quotes a joke from the modern movie ED WOOD about making a whole movie around just stock footage.  MM had a low budget, shot in 11 days, and Ed Wood himself had almost no budget.  Is it kind to make fun of MM and the late Ed Wood for doing their best?  The Historian apparently prefers straight horror movies to science fiction.  He refers to the hash written about in Monsters of Filmland and Fangoria, werewolves, etc., stuff the late Forrey Ackerman loved.  He characterizes MM as being too much a mere scientific documentary.  Well, I have worked with so-called Lone Wolves in high-energy physics, and if the American Tax Payers knew how their money was wasted, they might appreciate more scientific documentary-style exposes.  Science fiction came close to educating, and we should appreciate that often-futile attempt by a dedicated company way back in the 1950s.  Science is taught by football coaches today, right?

""You know"" there is a bodily function that could be used appropriately on this sickening  Audio Commentary, but Blu-ray discs cannot be safely edited with corrosive fluids.  ""You know.""",1465862400,12,5457,4.75880469583778

4892083,5,B005TMY00K,"This is a very imaginative and effective thriller from a bygone age. Yes, there are flaws in the plot that make the threat of worldwide Armageddon and the cyclotron bombardment of the evil element solution seem a little farfetched, but it is refreshing to see a ""monster"" movie that doesn't involve a giant dinosaur somehow freed from Arctic ice suddenly appearing in New York to stomp the city into ruins or a slimy, many-toothed Zorctron threatening to take over the planet and eat all its denizens ala Buck Rogers. This is a thoughtful thriller and a ""scientific"" product of the dawning of the atomic age. The suspense it generates works as well today as it did in the 50's when it was first released, even though it was never a box-office smash. Richard Carlson as the main protagonist trying to ""kill"" the magnetic element threatening the world, does a very credible job with the role and there are no distracting romantic sub-plots. The tension is made to build steadily from beginning to end and the tension is very real if you have the kind of imagination that doesn't require Godzilla or alien invaders from another world as the antagonist.

4892089,4,B005TMY00K,"THE STORY:  As for the plot... remember an episode from the old 1966 Johnny Quest cartoon series entitled ""The Invisible Monster""? The writer of that episode must have almost certainly watched THE MAGNETIC MONSTER; the basic premise & creation of the creatures in both scripts are almost identical: 1) rogue scientist accidentally creates a mass of energy that comes alive. 2) The ""monster"" consumes everything in its path, growing larger and larger and destroying everything around it. 3) If left unchecked, it will eventually become large and powerful enough to literally destroy the world. 4) Hero ""kills"" the monster by overfeeding it electricity. I'm not knocking the script nor the film. ""The Invisible Monster"" was one of the scariest episodes of the original Johnny Quest. Heck, if you're gonna copy something you might as well copy from the best!

THOUGHTS: This is a really fun film with a great cast of actors, featuring Richard Carlson & King Donovan as our two intrepid OSI agents (The ""A"" men). And keep your eyes peeled for a couple of old school character actors in small roles: Billy Benedict (from ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"" movie serial and The Bowery Boys films), as a nervous appliance store clerk, and a very young Strother Martin, (""The Wild Bunch,"" ""Rooster Cogburn,"" etc., etc.), as an airplane co-pilot. Producer Ivan Tors insures that the film treats itself and the threat very seriously. His ""OSI"" themed trilogy of films, (THE MAGNETIC MONSTER, RIDERS TO THE STARS, and GOG), all take a much more hard science-based approach to their storytelling. In the case of MAGNETIC MONSTER especially, I think it works to the film's advantage; certainly making it quite unique compared to most of the other, more fantastical sci-fi / creature films from this same era. Unfortunately, those viewers who demand tons of action and an actual physical creature running amok will likely be very disappointed, so don't say you weren't warned!

THE DVD: Please be aware that this MGM release is a DVD-r not a standard DVD. If you have an older DVD player, you MIGHT have some trouble getting the film to work in your player. Thankfully I didn't. My old JVC player and my sort of new entry-level Sony Blu-ray unit played this DVD-r of THE MAGNETIC MONSTER without any issues. However, YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary). The transfer used is very crisp and clean for the most part, with only a few occasional instances of scratches and print damage. Most of these lesser quality scenes occur towards the end of the film when footage from the German sci-fi movie GOLD (1934) is used for the climactic scenes featuring the super-duper ""Deltatron"" underground energy generator. Casual viewers might not notice, but learned genre fans and old film buffs will be able to spot the jarring difference in print quality when the action shifts to the underground Canadian power facility in Nova Scotia. The almost 20-year age difference between the old German footage and the newly shot stuff is pretty apparent. Another giveaway is that Richard Carlson & King Donovan get dressed up in heavy overcoats and hats for no real reason as they enter the underground complex and examine the Deltatron equipment. The most obvious goof is Carlson putting on a large, foppish workman's cap, only to take it off and toss it aside in the very next scene. These clothes changes were done in order to match the new footage of Carlson (and Donovan) with the actor(s) from the old German film. Suspend disbelief, use your imagination and just enjoy the film! I purchased THE MAGNETIC MONSTER from public domain outfit Sinister Cinema several years ago. The copy from SinCin is tolerable, but the print used here for this MGM release is of much higher quality. I took a bit of a gamble buying this MGM on-demand DVD-r without having actually watched it beforehand, but I am very happy to say that it was well worth the money and I'm pleased to have a sharp, upgraded copy of this interestingly offbeat sci-fi film. Nice job, MGM! 4 STARS",1395100800,11,4023,4.887262079062958

4892091,2,B005TMY00K,"I guess I will be the dissenting opinion; as of this writing, no one has given Magnetic Monster less than 3 stars, whereas I can't give it more than 2. MM is a lesser movie, and not nearly on par with the best the 50s had to offer by way of American scifi flicks. It pales in comparison to movies like Them, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Thing from Another World, The Monolith Monsters, 20 Million Miles to Earth, Forbidden Planet, It Came from Outer Space, Tarantula, The Mole People, and others. Not all of these are superb movies, but all of them are far more entertaining than The Magnetic Monster.

MM suffers from the same problems as a good many scifi films from that era. Unlike any of the above listed examples, MM is filmed in a documentary style, which also characterized some of the lesser film noir of the same time period. Exposition is handled mainly through very boring voice-over narration. In this way, instead of conveying information and through interesting character interactions or suspenseful plot reveals (watch The Thing for a perfect example of how it should be done), we have to listen to the protagonist drone on and on in sci-babble through his voice-overs.

In addition, the movie makes liberal use of Air Force stock footage leading up to the climax. The climax itself consists largely of re-used footage from what I believe is the 1935 scifi movie, Trans-Atlantic Tunnel (worth a look, BTW).

All of the above alludes to the main problem with MM: a bland, uninteresting script which never draws the viewer in after the fashion of the better scifi movies from that era. Most of the movies I listed above make a sincere attempt to present entertaining dialogue, and those with less complex scripts still create suspense through competent pacing and editing. Some of them, such as Them and The Thing, inject some humor into the script, thus investing the movie with another level of entertainment, while also fleshing out the characters a bit more. MM possesses none of these attributes, which is somewhat surprising, given Curt Siodmak's involvement with the film. He was both a competent writer and a reasonably talented director (perhaps not coincidentally, he conceived the story for Trans-Atlantic Tunnel).

Anyway, Magnetic Monster is worth a look, I guess, if you are a connoisseur of 50s American scifi; but I suggest you go in with low expectations.",1388966400,2,2393,4.857843137254902

4892097,4,B005TMY00K,"I remembered this movie from the 1950's, especially the ending.  Like GOG, a horrible, incredibly stupid movie from roughly the same era, this one was also produced by Ivan Tors, who seemed to specialize in science adventure / science fiction movies and shows, and he does some of his ""dumb and dumber"" routine in this one.  In GOG, F86 Sabre jets are scrambled and go up to shoot down a mysterious, evil plane, but after take-off, they magically become Starfire jets, no more Sabres.  In The Magnetic Monster, they use jets to transport the monster element quickly, and the reverse happens:  The plane takes off as a Starfire and then is shown refueling in flight as a very different Sabre jet.  I guess he used stock footage and managed to screw up both times but in opposite ways.  And there's some similar pseudo-drama attempts, such as early on when the police are called to isolate an area and they have orders to ""shoot to kill"", very dramatic but silly and unrealistic.  It seems they really were reaching to create drama at all cost.  I was not impressed...

However, unlike GOG, this movie, The Magnetic Monster, has decent acting, likeable characters, much better sense of realism, a plot, and at least a shred of scientific basis, and it's worlds apart.  It's actually a good movie, certainly dated in many respects but still viable and fun to watch.  Richard Carlson, the ubiquitous  and deservedly popular actor, stars, with a strong supporting cast, an actual plot, and suspense.  I really enjoyed watching it.  Of course, the memorable ending was the best part for me.  Audio and video quality are very good, too.

The chief stylist for General Motors in its heyday was Bill Mitchell, and he said something very true, along the lines that an old car will look old, but if it was styled correctly it will still look good.  This movie is old, it looks old, but it's not a bother and yes, it still looks good!

4892100,4,B005TMY00K,"This is the first in a trilogy of OSI (Office of Scientific Investigation) films made by Ivan Tors.  The second film is Riders to the Stars.  The Third film is Gog.

Think of this film as a sci-fi version of Dragnet.  The agents are serious fellows following a serious threat.  There's a narration and time reminders announced throughout.  Loads of gadgets and doodads that glow are also present so we'd have something flashy to look at.  Otherwise, it's just two agents on the trail of some hot isotope (thingy whatsit whatever).  They run around with geiger counters and hazmat suits, when they're not throwing fistfuls of washers at ceilings.  It's all very officious, they have the equipment to prove it, including a computer brain they call the maniac.  Part of this movie involves finding out what is causing rare cases of magnetism, the other part deals with how to stop/kill this itty-bitty thing in a canister.  The use of the term `monster' is more than a little misleading.  It's just a tiny element that was minding its own business when some loony scientist got the bright idea to bombard it with alpha particles.  I must admit, I only got a C in physics so all the super duper jargon was lost on me (things having to do with mega cycles, energy fields, critical mass, radiation, atomic weight).  Let's just say they didn't skimp on explaining things they needn't have bothered with.  But when they cry out in frightened voices that it's doubled in size, yet need a microscope to see any change, it's a little disappointing for those of us who like our MONSTERS on the big side of large.  I don't want to hear that it imploded a building; I want to see it happen!

Oddly enough, it is an engrossing film, and in spite of the lack of monsters as we know them, pretty entertaining.  I liked it.  I especially liked the whiz-bang ending even if it was lifted from a 1934 German sci-fi thriller called Gold.  As a whole, this movie is effective; it makes a point and presents it in an absorbing fashion.  I'm definitely keeping it to watch again.

4892109,3,B005TMY00K,"Ivan Tors, the Hungarian writer/filmmaker/producer will be known by his fans for his sci-fi and animal films. But most of all, using scientific fact (or what was thought as ""fact"" during that time) rather than focus on scientific fantasy which earned Tors his admiration of many sci-fi followers.

In the 1950's, Tors created the Office of Scientific Investigation (OSI) trilogy featuring the films ""The Magnetic Monster"", ""Riders to the Stars"" and ""Gog"".  As part of MGM's Limited Edition Collection, ""The Magnetic Monster"" and ""Gog"" have been released on DVD as part of their made-on-demand program.

""The Magnetic Monster"" is directed and co-written by Curt Siodmak (""The Invisible Man Returns"", ""The Wolf Man"") and Ivan Tors.  The film stars Richard Carlson (""It Came From Outer Space"", ""The Little Foxes"", ""Creature from the Black Lagoon""), King Donovan (""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""The Defiant Ones"", ""The Hanging Tree"") and Jean Byron (""The Patty Duke Show"", ""Invisible Invaders"", ""Jungle Moon Men"").

MOD PLAYABILITY:

Part of the worry of viewers who had bad experiences with MOD DVD's is its manufacturing.  Granted, those problems were a long time ago but so far, I have not had any problems with MGM's Limited Edition Collection.

With ""The Magnetic Monster"", its printed quite well with printing on top of the DVD, it's not a plain silver disc with letters. If you didn't know it was MOD, you would think it was an actual DVD release.

As for playability, I played ""The Magnetic Monster"" on my Blu-ray player and DVD player with no problems. I then played it on my Mac and PC, no problems whatsoever.

VIDEO AND AUDIO:

""The Magnetic Monster"" is presented in black and white (1:33:1 full frame).  As far as picture quality goes, the film has been manufactured using the best source available. The picture quality for ""The Magnetic Monster"" does have quite a bit of scratches and some damage but fortunately, it doesn't hurt the overall film.  The film is watchable, some frames have more scratches than others but for the most part, ""The Magnetic Monster"" looks good.

As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital.  You do hear a little hiss on ""The Magnetic Monster"" but overall, dialogue can be heard quite clearly.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Magnetic Monster"" comes with a theatrical trailer.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to 1950's sci-fi films, Ivan Tors films tend to have respect among fans, mainly because there is not so much fantasy but writer Ivan Tors tries to put as much science fact into the overall story and thus giving viewers a chance to learn from the films.  And while sci-fi fans who appreciate older sci-films will be nostalgic with the release of both ""The Magnetic Monster"" and ""Gog"" on DVD.

""The Magnetic Monster"" was rather interesting because sci-fi films at the time would focus on aliens landing on Earth but rarely does anyone full delve into the science of what can affect Earth.  With the OSI trilogy, these stories were well-thought out at the time and thus, Ivan Tors really had a lot of fans who followed his work.  And with this film, what if scientist who are always constantly trying to invent new things, end up creating a monster?

Sure, in today's society, we often see these storylines involving virus and diseases that are killing humanity but back then, in 1953, what if someone thing harmed Earth's rotation and also was a radiation risk?  Bare in mind, this film came out during the Cold War, people worried about the effects of radiation and after World War II, seeing the effects of nuclear bombs inflicted in Japan, needless to say, ""radiation"" has long been a worry for humanity, especially in the United States in the '70s and seeing what had happened in Russia with Chernobyl and Japan during the recent Earthquake and Tsunami disaster in 2011.

But that was radiation?  What about magnetic energy, the other problematic situation that develops in the film.  No one really thought about it back then, but watching this film...one wonders if it freaked anyone out.

""The Magnetic Monster"" is a low budget sci-fi film but because there is no monster that is seen and focuses on the use of science to help viewers understand the risks and seeing how it can affect humanity, Ivan Tors knows how to write that into his films without being too cerebral and making it accessible for viewers.  The special effects may seem cheesy today but I suppose back in 1953, it may have excited some viewers.  And for others, they may have realized that some of the stock footage shown was from the German film ""Gold"".

While the film may seem outdated and over-the-top for viewers today, still ""The Magnetic Monster"" manages to be quite entertaining.  The fact is that Ivan Tors films were intelligent for its time and they may have not have large budgets but somehow they made these films work.  Classic Sci-fi fans may enjoy it, others may find it too farfetched for their tastes, but for what it is...I enjoyed it as a classic '50s sci-fi film, nothing more and nothing less.",1335571200,16,5038,4.860655737704918
4892110,4,B005TMY00K,"This science fiction black-and-white movie moves well, builds mystery and suspense, includes a little romance, and is complete with gauges, knobs, and the gigantic on-off switch which is a standard prop in many sci-fi-B's.  We even get the wise old scientist gasping his last words pleading to save the world.  Like Frankenstein (1931) or Forbidden Planet (1956) an ethical question is raised about responsible scientific research.  The age of the lone investigator is over.  Complex technology and its consequences can't be fathomed by one person and so the recluse is obsolete.  I'm not sure that that conclusion is valid even today in view of the humble beginnings of Bill Gates or the late Steve Jobs.

The audience has to be a little forgiving regarding technical explanations that are fudged or special effects that are not on-the-nose; but that's true of most sci-fi movies made prior to computer graphics.  The monster itself is a tiny speck of some mysterious material that, presumably keeps growing by pulling on everything around it like a magnet and converting the surrounding energy into mass, eventually to become so heavy as to throw the Earth off its orbit around the sun.  We get a fuzzy picture of it and it looks vaguely like the Andromeda Strain (1969).  As usual in Hollywood, what you think you see is better than what you do see.

Unlike the mediocre Ivan Tors TV production of Science Fiction Theater (1955-7) the scenes are well edited with none of the indiscriminate cutting and zooming of another one of his monstrosities, Hawaii Five-O (1968-9).

The background of this story is post World War II, the Bomb, and the evolution of a new bourgeoisie, the technocrat, played by clean-cut Richard Carlson.  In those days a war veteran could go to school on his GI Bill and become a draftsman or even an engineer.  The myth generally accepted by 1953 was that a tech certification was the sure road to success.  That belief was reinforced in 1957 with Sputnik and in 1969 with Armstrong on the moon.  The myth was to be shattered following the post Viet Nam recession and the aerospace collapse of 1970.  In view of what's happened since, a sequel to the movie would have Richard Carlson slogging hamburgers or pumping gasoline.

At the cataclysmic end, mighty bolts of electricity kill the element and the Earth is saved.  It's a bleak noirish scene reminiscent of Metropolis (1927).

A line from Things To Come (1936) spoken by distinguished Sir Cedric Hardwicke sums up the sentiment of this movie: ""Stop this prow-gress before it is too late.""  The issue over the forbidden fruit of knowledge was to surface again with the Hadron Collider near Geneva, built 1998-2008.  In our search for the God Particle we're just liable to get more than we bargained for, a black hole right here on Earth; which is not a bad slant on the next remake.

Incidentally, science is not sure that a magnetic monopole is possible, or can even be defined by vector analysis, let alone radiate a forceful reach.  Don't hold your breath waiting for the answer because the question is still open and may remain so for ages to come.",1328400000,25,3132,4.823970037453184
4892111,4,B005TMY00K,"I bought ""The Magnetic Monster"" purely based on the two five-star reviews that preceded mine on Amazon. I had never seen this Ivan Tors film, but the two reviews gave it good marks, so I figured I couldn't go wrong, since I really enjoy old black-and-white science fiction movies from the 1950s. Having recently bought ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gog/dp/B005TMXXX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gog</a>,"" another Ivan Tors production from the man who also created the groundbreaking ""Science Fiction Theatre"" television series that sparked my lifelong interest (and career) in science and technology, I had high hopes for ""The Magnetic Monster.""

But I have to say I was a little disappointed. The film begins with an intriguing idea, and it has Ivan Tors' typical dedication to getting the science (mostly) right. A scientist, working alone in a makeshift laboratory, creates a new element by radioactive bombardment. It has the disturbing property of doubling in size every 11 hours, a violent transformation accompanied by powerful magnetic emanations that wreak havoc in the surrounding area. Unrestrained growth of the element threatens all life on earth, and could destroy the planet itself. After some interesting and reasonably accurate detective work leads them to the element, Richard Carlson and his team of scientists figure out that they must apply millions of volts of electricity to it to fission it into two inert parts. So far, so good. But the only place in the world with the required electrical capability is an undersea Canadian facility--and that's where ""The Magnetic Monster"" goes astray, in my opinion.

Similar to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Island-Earth/dp/B000FVQLKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Island Earth</a>,"" the last third of ""The Magnetic Monster"" is completely different than the rest of the film. Apparently this is because a lot of it is footage reused from an earlier movie, the German film ""Gold."" The different ""looks"" of the two parts of the film are literally like night and day. The first part takes place mostly in bright daylight or well-lighted laboratories, and is crisp and sharp. The last part is grainy, dark and contrasty--so dark and contrasty that it's sometimes hard to figure out what's going on. The juxtaposition of the two wildly different parts is, to me, quite jarring, as is the obvious need to tailor the script to match the reused footage that was available. What starts as a thoughtful, well-paced scientific mystery ends in frenetic ""alarums and excursions,"" blinding lightning bolts and repeated explosions that seem out of character with the rest of the story.

If I had it to do over again, I probably would not buy ""The Magnetic Monster."" It's an okay film, and it was worth seeing once, but I doubt I'll watch it again any time soon. One of the criteria by which I judge movies is whether or not I think I'll ever be interested in seeing them again, and in that respect ""The Magnetic Monster"" falls short.",1326067200,60,3068,5.3875

In science fiction anything is possible with LHC. If this magnetic monster is created by the giant machine, then all hell should be loose on the world. The ""living thing"" could draw out all magnetic matter and capture the electrons leaving material drain of its capacity to channel electricity.

8486439,4,B005TMY00K,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of 'The Magnetic Monster' released by Kino Lorber in 2016.

'The Magnetic Monster' is one of three movies produced by Ivan Tors in the 1950's that featured OSI (The Office of Scientific Investigation.)
This movie has been released previously but this is the first time on Blu-Ray.

The focus here is on the science in science fiction.

BLU-RAY & EXTRA'S: The picture was shot with a 1.37:1 aspect ratio. The pictures is clear but as noted below, the extensive use of stock footage is more noticeable because of the excellent picture quality. There is an audio commentary, which is always welcome, by Film Historian Derek Botello. This is not the best commentary track you will ever hear. I prefer commentary tracks that stick to the movie at hand. This one has the usual biographies of everybody involved with the movie and not a whole lot about the movie itself. Nevertheless, it is there and is better than nothing. There is also a bunch of trailers of other science fiction movies from Kino Lorber.

PLOT/SUMMARY: The movie opens with a scene in a hardware/appliance store where everything is going haywire. Magnetism seems to be disturbing everything. Two agents, Jeff Stewart and Dan Forbes, from OSI (Office of Scientific Investigation) are sent there. They discover that the souce of the magnetism is coming from the second floor of the building. They find a dead person in a laboratory along with massive radiation in the room. They figure out through use of a Geiger counter and help from the outside that somebody has removed something from the lab and has boarded an airplane. The plane returns to the airport and A famous scientist is found dying from radiation poisoning. Before he dies he tells the scientists that he has bombarded a radioactive isotope with alpha rays. This isotope is doubles and releases incredible magnetic energy once every 11 hours. If something is not done to stop this pattern then the earth will soon be thrown out of it's orbit dooming the planet. The only hope is to neutralize the isotope by bombarding it with electricity but they have to find a source powerful enough as not even a city generator has enough electricity to do the job.

PRODUCTION & COMMENTS:  I liked 'The Magnetic Monster' as I liked all of the OSI movies. These movie have all been criticized for being slow and sometimes boring. It is fair criticism but I don't mind the slow pace. What I like is that all of these movies focus on science and scientific explanations for everything even if the science isn't accurate. I much prefer this than non-sensical action sequences and overly heroic protaganist's that rarely seem believable.

Of the three OSI movies, I like this one the least though it's close with 'Riders to the Stars.' I prefer 'Gog' over the other two.

Even though there is no real 'monster' in this movie, there might as well have been. The scientist's had to come up with a way to defeat the radiocative isotope much the same way they do in most monster movies.
In fact there are no monsters in any of the OSI movies in the normal sense of the word. 'Riders to the Stars' deals with a mission to outer space and 'Gog' deals with robots used for scientific purposes that have been taken control of by a foreign enemy.

This movie was made in 1953 and was released by United Artists. It is disputed as to who actually directed this movie. The editor Herb Strock is sometimes given credit because he was the editor and editing in this movie was a more important than other movies due to the use of stock footage for much of the climax. It is also said by some that Curt Siodmak was fired early on but others say no. Curt wrote many excellent screenplays and wanted to be known for directing like his brother, Robert, but did not come close to being a successful director.

The other two OSI movies were 'Riders to the Stars' and 'Gog.'

Much of the footage from the climax of the movie was taken from a big budget German movie from the 30's called 'Gold.' The actors wore outfits that matched the actors from 'Gold.' I felt that they did a pretty good job of working the stock footage into the movie and making it meaningful.

I have watched this movie in standard DVD form also. The problem with Blu-Ray versions of old movies with practical special effects is that the effects don't 'blend' as well. It's a lot easier to see imperfections. The transition from stock footage to new footage is easier to see. An effort was actually made to make the newer footage look like stock footage.

This movie stars Richard Carlson playing Dr. Jeffrey Stewart. Carlson is a 1950's science fiction icon and starred in one other Ivan Tors OSI movie. That one was 'Riders to the Stars.' He is best known for his role in 'Creature from the Black Lagoon.' He also starred in 'The Maze,' 'It Came From Outer Space,' and 'Valley of the Gwangi.'

I don't believe it was ever made clear where the professor who created the isotope was taking it when he boarded the plane. He knew it had to be constantly 'fed' and I'm not sure what he was doing on the plane. Perhaps he was just trying to escape criminal prosecution for the death of his lab assistant?

There is a sort of forced romance between Jeffrey Stewart and his wife. I guess every picture from that time period had to have a romance angle. The only angle here is that Dr. Stewart wants his wife to eat more because she isn't 'fat' at 4 months pregnant. That's it for the romance.

RECOMMENDATIONS: I'm giving this release 4 stars. Due to their brevity, I feel like most of these old movies should be packaged with another movie or should be priced lower but I am happy to have them available even if they are a bit on the expensive side. The movie is decent, the print quality is excellent and you get a commentary track so it's not bad, just not good enough for 5 stars.

Recommended for all 1950's science fiction fans.",1515542400,3,5928,4.582625118035883
