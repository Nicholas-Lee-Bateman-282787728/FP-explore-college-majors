8162745,4,B000LP5D2O,"This DVD is a double-feature of ""The Velveteen Rabbit"" plus ""The Nightingale.""

I saw the ""Velveteen Rabbit"" when I was a kid and it struck a chord with me that has lasted all these years well into my adulthood. I had a stuffed rabbit a lot like the title character back then and the story reinforced my bond and affection for my fluffy childhood friend. To this day, I truly believe that inanimate objects pick-up our energy and emotions and store them up somehow.

I searched high and low for this production, including suffering through a number of remakes that completely distort the original story. This is the one and only original version to be found anywhere else physically or online including Redbox and Netflix. In fact, avoid at all costs the remake of ""The Velveteen Rabbit"" on Netflix. The story was radically altered and in fact, in my opinion, their version is ultimately unsuitable for children.  This production is a beautiful ""old school"" hand-drawn animation with a warm storybook-style narration. There is a memorable and endearing quality here that is hard to describe but easy to recognize. I hope you cherish this story the way I have. If you've been on a quest for this title in this form like I was, rest assured, this here is the version you want.

Going back to the double-feature aspect of this DVD, truthfully, I've yet to see the other feature (""The Nightingale""). That is an extra treat that, in my view, comes along for free with a purchase that is already a bargain on its own even if you're just buying it for ""The Velveteen Rabbit"" as I did.",1293926400,7,1577,4.661870503597123
