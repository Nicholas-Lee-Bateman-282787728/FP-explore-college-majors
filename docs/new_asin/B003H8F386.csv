8396843,1,B003H8F386,A complete disappointment. Very very very little Bowie but for a few sentences. Others talking about him in such a slow and monotonous presentation. There are way better DVDs out there.,1517529600,,185,5.0
8396844,3,B003H8F386,Very informative.,1479254400,,17,8.0
8396845,2,B003H8F386,"This DVD uses the word ""rare"" AND the word ""unseen"" FOUR times on the back cover and TWICE each on the front.  In tiny print on the back they define ""unseen"" as they believe it's unseen since first broadcast, and that would perhaps be true if you never, ever used YouTube.  They define ""rare"" as indicating it's never been released on DVD before.  HA!  No, nobody has gone so far as to take three YouTube videos, and cut them up in true Burroughs fashion (sarcasm intended) and intersperse them with one another flipping back and forth in time periods so it's almost humorous.  It's the full Russell Harty Interview, 1999 NY Interview when he talks openly about drug use, a Press Conference in the 80's and a bit of rehearsal footage as Janet Street Porter does an interview.  There is brief comments by John Landis (Into the Night) and Julien Temple (Jazzin' for Blue Jean.  What saved it from 1 star was the brief interview with Carlos Alomar and another with Peter Frampton.  Those were a bit ""rare and unseen"" with me.  Very short 1-2 min segments in the chopped up 64 min. of YouTube rehash.  Oh, and all the Bowie music used is performed by Steve Riks who tries to sound like Bowie (and fails) while they show clips of Bowie singing.  They go out of their way to include all sorts of disclaimers to avoid being sued. In fact, this one is such a mess, if you can find it used, and super cheap it's almost funny enough to buy.  It's a hot mess.  Hey, wanna buy a video?  HA!",1466294400,7,1478,4.386029411764706
8396846,5,B003H8F386,"Since he is gone now, all footage is rare. This is more than worth watching. It could be just a bunch of interview clips put together for money. It doesn't matter - you can't find these all on youtube.",1452729600,,201,4.17948717948718
8396847,4,B003H8F386,Interview DVD of different periods of Kylie's career. NO actual singing done by Kylie herself.,1441411200,,94,5.333333333333333

8396849,4,B003H8F386,Highly recommend this documentary for Bowie fans.,1407801600,2,49,6.142857142857143
8396850,3,B003H8F386,"Over all not a great DVD, most clips I had seen before.  There were a few facts I had not know.  For a Rolling Stones fan it was a good purchase.",1332806400,,145,3.6451612903225805
8396851,5,B003H8F386,It is in the dvd that I knew more of who Richard is. He is a man to be praised for. Such a man of God and of integrity.,1300320000,5,119,3.1379310344827585
8396852,3,B003H8F386,"A little bit disappointed after I receive my copy. It's indeed a NTSC and region o which is for US standard.
But the whole dvd, after I finished watching, there's no performance, only the interviews! I thought it's gonna includes some performances which we didn't get to see from a concert or a tour dvd. But it's all interviews from early years until recently. Since Kylie has so many TV show and performances in Europe which American fans never seen before. I saw a lot of them on youtube. The dvd cover is also a performance not a interview!",1293753600,28,544,4.505050505050505
