4159344,5,B003NIGL5Y,"Based on Vera Brittain's 1933 autobiography (a must read, still in print) of the years 1914 to 1925, it is the powerful true story of how the First World War tragically affected her family with the loss of her fiance, her best male friend, and then her beloved brother, all needlessly killed in combat.

(For those concerned about the Region 2 format, all computers with a DVD reader and easily available software will play this media.)",1414886400,7,436,4.7368421052631575
4159345,5,B003NIGL5Y,I read this many years ago and loved it. I'm so disappointed that it's not offered in Region 1 as a DVD. PLEASE reconsider!,1402012800,5,123,4.166666666666667
4159346,5,B003NIGL5Y,"Some time ago, I saw this in VHS and found it so powerful. I agree with other reviewers who state that this, in so many ways, is intensely relevant in 2014. Please pursue DVD conversion. VHS players are now vintage and this wonderful series is lost to almost all.",1401321600,2,263,4.387755102040816
4159347,5,B003NIGL5Y,I agree with all the other comments. I have VHS and the book. All are wonderful. Please release in DVD format for USA Thank you,1380499200,2,127,4.12
4159348,5,B003NIGL5Y,"I have the VHS of this wonderful mini-series, but am afraid to watch it too often for fear it will wear out completely, and then where will I be???

Anyone who has read Vera Brittain's moving, devastating, beautifully written memoir of the same name will want to see this adaptation. Cheryl Campbell is everything you'd want Vera to be; she IS the author, leaped off the page and come to life. Even for those who haven't read the book will love this testament to youth, resilience, love, and loss.

I don't know how we can persuade the powers that be to make this available on Region 1 DVD, except to say: PLEASE MAKE THIS AVAILABLE ON REGION 1!!!

But in the meantime, we have Brittain's marvelous book --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Testament-of-Youth/dp/0297858319/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Testament of Youth</a>-- a must read for anyone interested in WWI, Great Britain, nursing, early 20th-century feminism, literature, friendship, and love.",1348963200,20,995,5.576158940397351
4159349,5,B003NIGL5Y,I saw this production when it first aired on PBS and also own the book.  I have the VHS version but really would like the DVD.  Don't know how we can impress upon the appropriate organization to make this available in the U.S. format - but I'd be first in line to buy it!,1294790400,28,271,4.0
4159350,5,B003NIGL5Y,"I've only seen the video tape and don't understand why this brilliant interpretation of the remarkable, inspiring autobiography of Vera Brittain, Oxford scholar, World War I nurse, writer, witness, woman's rights advocate has not been made available to Americans. When else, if  not now, during war time, will we need to see this heartening production?",1281225600,24,352,5.4

New version vile",1490486400,,37,6.6
8401151,5,B003NIGL5Y,"I'd watched it, when it came to Spain, dubbed to Spanish, years ago, and I loved it then, but now, hearing it with the real voices of all the actors, and being able to compare it with the new film, I loved it even better.",1458950400,,221,3.933333333333333
8401152,5,B003NIGL5Y,"We watched this 1979 version after reading the book & seeing the 2015 movie. Much preferred the 1979 version. It takes almost no liberties with Vera Brittain's script (whereas the 2014 movie compresses the story into 2 hours and has some melodramatic moments which are not in the book). So I am in agreement with the previous reviewers.

Note - we waited for quite a long time before getting the 1979 version because the description states that it cannot be viewed in the US. However, we were able to watch it  very satisfactorily by using the DVD drive on a laptop and projecting from it to a TV.",1454889600,4,597,4.518518518518518
8401153,5,B003NIGL5Y,"I have the tapes of this marvelous production and have also read the book.  Both are superb.  Unfortunately, the 2015 film does not even begin to hold a hat to the earlier version.  Part of this is because it is pretty difficult to put into 2 hours (the more ""up-to-date"" version) what the version with Cheryl Campbell and Peter Woodward includes in 5 hours.  This longer version has superb character development and really gives the story as one can read it in the book.  This is the version that should be available in Region 1.  The 2015 version is simply a rather sad reflection.",1453766400,,583,4.5576923076923075
8401154,4,B003NIGL5Y,"You can play this on your computer using VLC, a free media player.",1445817600,,66,4.153846153846154
8401155,2,B003NIGL5Y,"Overall, I thought this film was a pretty feeble interpretation of Vera Brittain's classic 1933 memoir.  It is long (about 5 hours) and detailed, and it is much more faithful to the actual sequence of events than the shorter 2014 film version is.  But the main characters are all washed out: Vera is too dowdy and girlish, Edward (though perhaps the best of the younger characters) too flat and uncomplicated, Roland too courtly and too old, Edith Brittain too whiny.  There is very little chemistry between any of the pairs of people who ought to have chemistry, except for a nice brother-sister dynamic between Edward and Vera.

The filmmakers sought to evoke the agony of the war years by using voice-overs of famous World War I poetry at key moments.  While this was a clever idea, it was not executed very thoughtfully.  For example, Wilfred Owen's poem ""What passing bells for those who die as cattle . . ."" is inserted in 1915.  It was not a 1915 poem!--it was from 1917, by which point the mood of the war had changed completely.  I do give the filmmakers credit for their efforts to depict the brutality of the war--particularly noticeable at Victor's death and in the German ward at Etaples--but it was too often too clumsily done.

Although the 2014 film version of Testament of Youth is far from perfect, and can seem almost like a different story to those who know the book well, I think it more successfully conveys the gist of the memoir and the interpersonal dynamics among the five young adults than this version does.  I am waiting for a serious BBC version of the story that combines fidelity to the narrative with a bold and probing interpretation of the story!",1437955200,4,1681,4.667796610169492
8401156,1,B003NIGL5Y,the copy did not work on two VCRs. I wish it did. I would love see this program. I am very disappointed it didn't work.,1436400000,,119,3.8
8401157,5,B003NIGL5Y,"I saw the PBS video; now I'd like to purchase this for a college library as a social history discussion starter for history classes.  For many students, history is not interesting until they see a film that captures their emotions and stirs their curiosity about the historical context. But unfortunately, this is not available for US consumers.  Bummer.",1432857600,,354,5.086206896551724
8401158,5,B003NIGL5Y,"When are we ever going to get a Region 1 DVD?  I love this series (and all of vera Brittain's books) and still have my VHS tapes, but my VHS is going the way of the dodo bird soon and I don't want to be forced to watch Region 2 on my computer.  Please, Amazon, BBC, whoever, please produce this on Region 1 DVD!",1432425600,8,311,3.84375
8401159,5,B003NIGL5Y,"If you're at all interested in the status of women, watch this terrific series about a woman and the devastating events that happen to her, and others, in World War I and later into the 1920's.  It's fascinating.",1427155200,,212,4.578947368421052
