8547068,3,B00A6QPORM,"Christina Ricci being in this made it immediately worth it for me, but the movie was really not the best quality. I expected a 3D film to be better in the way of special effects and camera work, but it's almost as if somebody with little to no direction skills rented some high-definition 3D equipment. The plot wasn't so bad, nor was the acting (Christina always delivers), and I loved watching the burning house scene in 3D. Those flames looked amazing! I probably wouldn't buy it if I had a second chance, still.",1390780800,,515,4.548387096774194
