Segments flow naturally as if you were getting private instruction. Great balance of instructional dialog with quiet reflection.
The Yoga Nidra segment alone is worth the purchase!
LOVE LOVE LOVE it!",1359676800,4,322,4.872727272727273
172211,5,0941062236,"Very well paced and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.  The beginning yoga segments, especially the floor and seated exercises are very relaxing and great for relieving back tension.
The setting is also gorgeous",1359676800,,223,5.194444444444445
172212,5,0941062236,"This is an amazing video. In addition to getting great yoga instruction, this DVD was shot in a stunning setting and has wonderful music. This video is professionally done and in my opinion, is a definate have-to-have for anyone beginning/continuing on their yoga path. Do yourself a favor and order immediately. You will love it!!!",1358035200,,332,5.054545454545455
172213,5,0941062236,Great DVD with plenty of options whatever your level.  The best part is the instructor explains what is happening and why so you not only improve your yoga posture but increase a greater awareness of your whole body.  This has become my favorite!,1357430400,,246,4.6976744186046515
172214,5,0941062236,Kathy's instructions are so helpful that I actually could do the crow!  I almost feel like I am in a classroom setting because it feels like she is actually walking me through each of the poses.  I have many yoga DVD's and this is one of the better ones.  She doesn't rush through the poses and explains the poses in a way even a beginner can understand!  It's a keeper!,1367452800,3,370,4.242857142857143
172215,5,0941062236,Very thorough education about the benefits of yoga and posture alignment. I've been doing yoga for 15+ years and I loved relearning the basics in the beginner series.  Kathy is a natural teacher and the backdrop is beautiful.  Can't wait to go try the rest of the dvd!,1367280000,4,268,4.5625
172216,5,0941062236,"Kathy's voice, her instruction, the beautiful setting, and relaxing music all blend perfectly to create an experience that opens your body, releases your mind, and soothes your spirit.  This DVD is perfect for the beginner and masters in yoga of any kind. I suggest you buy a couple, because you will want to give it as a gift!!!",1365465600,,329,4.672413793103448
172217,5,0941062236,This is an excellent yoga DVD! Kathy provides 180 minutes of easy to understand yoga instruction set to calming music.  Kathy teaches you body awareness and reminders of how to breath correctly and moments of meditation. She gives instructions on how to do poses correctly. She explains body parts/muscles being worked on in poses so that you know how your body is being helped by the movement. Using this DVD makes me feel that I am doing something good for my body and mind. I look forward to my yoga workouts with this DVD.,1365206400,6,526,4.595744680851064
172218,5,0941062236,"Hatha Yoga on the Forgotten Coast is a very user friendly video. Its suitable for anyone from the beginner to the more seasoned yoga student. Ms. Jansen is extremely knowledgeable about the body and gives alternate instruction for those of us who may need it.  An impressive teacher in a divine setting! I would recommend it to anyone wanting to connect or reconnect mind, body and spirit.",1364428800,,389,4.8059701492537314
172219,5,0941062236,"After a decade of searching, I have finally found an excellent yoga DVD!  Kathy Jansen presents 180 minutes of thorough, well directed, intelligent yoga instruction set to soft ambient music or waves hitting the shore, along with tranquil Gulf coast scenery.  Kathy's voice is calm and relaxing to listen to.  Reminders to breathe are incorporated throughout, as are moments of meditation.  She gives excellent explanations of how to do poses correctly and WHY.  She also explains body parts/muscles being worked on in poses as well as how the body is being helped by the movement.  It increased my understanding of what I was doing and the benefits of yoga.  Kathy also teaches you body awareness when she calmly instructs, "" Notice what you are feeling"". All details have been thought through.....even the mention of putting your tongue beneath teeth to relax jaw as you work through different poses. Kathy has included something she calls ""Brain Gym"" to help motor-neuron  development.  As a teacher of children with learning  and  motor problems, I was impressed with her understanding and inclusion of these movements. Her desire to help others is also exhibited in the final self help section of the DVD with help for things like carpel tunnel syndrome, hydrotherapy for arthritis, and a beautiful, relaxing meditation.  After only three sessions of using the beginners  sections of the DVD, I have already noticed improved balance and ability to do different poses. Best of all, going through the DVD leaves me feeling very relaxed and pleasantly aware of how great my body feels.  Kathy is extremely well educated in yoga and massage.  Her passion for yoga and good health comes through in every part of the DVD.  You can tell how important it is to her to teach yoga and  how motivated she is to help others.  This comes through in everything she has incorporated in her video.  Lastly, I know already what I will be giving friends and family for Christmas this year.......""Hatha Yoga on the Forgotten Coast""!!!!",1363651200,13,2021,4.979104477611941
172220,5,0941062236,This yoga DVD is one of a kind! There's such humanness and effortless grace to her instruction. The scenery is beautiful and Kathy adds such a unique style to this practice.,1362096000,,173,4.612903225806452
172221,5,0941062236,"One of the best yoga videos I've ever seen.  I used to be very into yoga but haven't practiced reqularly for a couple of years - I was worried this would lose me, but her instruction was so good I was able to keep up - nor did the routine feel too overtly ""beginner"" - I think it would work perfectly for any level.  I'm so happy I found this video! Hope there's a follow up soon!",1361923200,,380,3.9220779220779223
172222,5,0941062236,"I found this video to be very well filmed with an amazing amount of yoga content for students of all skill levels. The video was filmed on beautiful St. George Island, Florida and I love to practice yoga at home with this DVD & enjoy the sounds of water & the nature of SGI all around me. Great for relaxation & I really enjoyed the skills taught in the self help section of the video. In my opinion, this DVD is a must have for any Yoga lover!!",1361750400,3,445,4.068181818181818
172223,4,0941062236,"I have been lucky enough to take Kathy Jansen's classes. Now I have her DVD for home and travel. For me, as a former dancer who has practiced yoga for many years, finding Kathy on the Forgotten Coast was like a gift from the sea. She is incredibly knowledgeable about all aspects of the body, which comes from her integrated professional background as a massage therapist, dancer, and certified yogi. Do not get the idea that Kathy is a teacher only for the already proficient. Her skill and background enable her to teach at all levels, because she understands individual bodies as well as The Body. Kathy believes--and shows--that yoga can benefit everyone. Standing on your head may not happen. More strength, stretch, balance, and equanimity will.

Just as important as her knowledge and skill, if not more, is that Kathy is dedicated to yoga in all its aspects. She has a passion and a mission, which is why she made the DVD. It's extremely accessible to students on all levels and offers not just a series of asanas, but an approach to breath (spirit) and practice (making yoga part of life) that is inspiring. And FUN.

7793499,1,0941062236,"I am not an experienced Hatha yogi, so I need to see how the postures are performed by the instructor.  This video has some full body shots that allow you to see how the posture should be held, but most of this video is a face shot.  I do not care what the instructor looks like, I do care about how to hold the posture appropriately.  Hatha yoga is about holding postures appropriately, so being able to see how the postures are held is key.  The teaching technique is poor, to me, compared to other yoga DVD's that I do have.",1438041600,2,527,4.188118811881188
7793500,5,0941062236,I love this DVD.  I am new to yoga and it has a section that is perfect for beginners as well as later on for the more advanced.  I particularly love the gentle restorative section.  I had a hip replacement last winter and find this segment very beneficial for tight muscles post surgery.,1423180800,,288,4.39622641509434
7793501,4,0941062236,"I like that it's divided into sections, so shorter workouts can be done if time is limited. Also, she added additional sections on massage techniques and a 30 minute yoga nidra which is excellent! Those were in addition to the beginner, intermediate and advanced workout sections.
  The only problem is that often the camera is on her head, when I'd like to see her leg position. That happened mostly in the beginner section and I was familiar with those moves so it wasn't critical.",1400198400,,483,4.738095238095238
7793502,4,0941062236,"Wonderful DVD,  easy to follow, relaxing, and has 3 levels of Yoga all on one DVD.  She explains why each pose is helping you in a very low soothing voice.  Ocean view, and low zen music.  Very Good",1384560000,6,198,4.131578947368421
7793503,3,0941062236,"When I ordered this DVD, I was hoping to have something that flowed from one pose to another.  The most basic level doesn't really seem to, and the intermediate level is hard for me to keep up with.  A level between the basic and intermediate would probably be ideal.  I haven't had the courage to even try the advanced level.",1375142400,,326,4.4
7793504,2,0941062236,I actually thought that a prior review about the DVD arriving opened was a rare occurence but upon my purchase of the same DVD Mine is not wrapped either. Actually mine does not have the sticker to ensure that the item is new either. I actually bought a different DVD & it arrived perfectly wrapped.,1374537600,,299,4.454545454545454
7793505,5,0941062236,"I love this yoga DVD! It has all you need to get a satisfying workout-I am an intermediate and this offers a great balance of beginner, intermediate & advanced stages. I sometimes just want a good stretch after work and the beginner segment is perfect for that-I use it to relax a lot. Apalachicola & St. George Island, FL is BEAUTIFUL :) Keep up the good work Kathy Jansen, you have a forever fan!",1370736000,5,398,4.391891891891892

7793507,5,0941062236,"This Iran excellent video for beginners, or anyone who has experience practicing yoga but would like a relaxing routine. Her focus on the breath makes this video more valuable than most.",1369526400,,186,5.032258064516129
7793508,3,0941062236,The content itself is ok. But the DVD case is not shrink wrapped which makes me think that someone opened and used it before.,1368748800,,125,4.25
