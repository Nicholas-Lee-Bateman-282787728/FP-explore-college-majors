8421584,1,B004B7NVP4,"This disc is a DVD-R, not a pressed DVD, which means it costs more than it needs to and it is likely to have quality problems.  WTTW was also thoughtful enough to include the original commercials. :(  This is a shame, because these programs hosted by Geoffrey Baer are wonderful and easily worth five stars. There are terrific extras in the form of episodes from Chicago Stories and the original 1999 production of Chicago's Lakefront.",1487635200,,435,4.786666666666667
