If you are a admirer of this SciFi great series you know it does follow a story line and has its highs and lows but the one thing that you could count on with the team SG1 you could always enjoy how there stories evolved and had good endings. The four stories in this volume are an inspired part of the continuing story line and end with the team trying to put an end to there most hated enemy ""Apophis"". This episode has a real big bang!",1256342400,,619,4.12396694214876
