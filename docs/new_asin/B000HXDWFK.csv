8142491,5,B000HXDWFK,"I bought this for the movie Detonator, not the sequel.  One of Pierce Brosnan's early films, also has Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame (yes, Patrick Stewart is famous for more than just Star Trek but who really pays attention to that?)  Very entertaining and campy.  Fun movie.",1365724800,,278,4.75
8142492,4,B000HXDWFK,"USA has the best made-for-tv movies, and I think these two were some of the best of those.  Both are worth watching, though I far preferred the 2nd one to the first.  Detonator II/Night Watch came out right before Goldeneye, so Piece Brosnan wasn't quite the superstar he is today.  I was only looking to buy Detonator II/Night Watch to replace my VHS copy, but the double-feature is so cheap, might as well have them both.",1246752000,,423,4.5394736842105265
8142493,5,B000HXDWFK,"I'm a big Pierce Brosnan fan and don't understand why he's not a bigger star than he is.  I've enjoyed every movie of his that I've seen, from movies like Noble House to Laws of Attraction to Detonator (both), he does a great job.  I already had Detonator on VHS and couldn't pass up the chance to get both on DVD.  Well worth the little I had to pay, both are as good as the much hyped Peacemaker with George Clooney and Nicole Kidman so if you saw and liked that one you should like the Detonators.",1242518400,,500,4.134020618556701
