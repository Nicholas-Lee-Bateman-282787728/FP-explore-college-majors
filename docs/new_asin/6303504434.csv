7849116,5,6303504434,"Anyone with any interest in Kenneth Anger should see this film. The imagery and symbolism is profound. It is truly an historic peace. I have seen most of his work and this along with Anger 3 which consists of Kar Klub Kommandos, Lucifer Rising, and The Invocation of My Demon Brother are his most important work. Both are very very hard to find and very expensive.",1103846400,7,364,4.53030303030303
7849117,5,6303504434,"Anyone with an interest in underground film or occultism, especially Thelema, should check this film out. Of Course as a ""Crowleyite"" Ken's film is very rich and extreme and he combines some striking imagery  with some beautiful music. I have no idea what the music is that he uses  but he manages to relate the on screen imagery to it perfectly. I have seen  two versions of the film with different soundtracks - One of them had a  soundtrack consisting of old pop tunes and I found this version to be not  as good. Anyways - check it out!",945043200,13,540,4.414141414141414
