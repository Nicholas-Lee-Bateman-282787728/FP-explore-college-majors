7893567,5,6305701180,"After getting quite a few ""new school"" ski movies Global Storming stands out as one of the best.
Lots of big mountain and a good new school segment.  As is the fashion in ""extreme sports"" movies, there is a soundtrack heavy on punk music.  However this isn't the case for every segment, and the music is almost perfectly matched for each skier/segment.",1047168000,,352,4.661290322580645
7893568,3,6305701180,"The reviews here defenitely overrate this movie.  The footage is pretty good, there are a lot of cool mountains and fast skiing down steeps.  However, it lacks variety and gets boring after a while.  It would be ok if it were only 30 minutes but then it is just too repetetive.  The whole film lacks outstanding runs or jumps or tircks that you want to rewind and see over and over again like other ski movies.  The rapping session is painful.  The film is better than some but not the best.",1010275200,5,491,4.34065934065934
7893569,3,6305701180,"Having bought this video on the 5-star reviews by all the Amazon reviewers, I was expecting an epic ski movie along the lines of ""The Blizzard of Oz.""  Although the movie is good, I don't think it comes close to any of the Greg Stump videos.  Ironically, it seems as if this movie is a rip-off of some of Stump's original, cutting edge films.  In fact, I would say it is a cross between Stump's videos and my own homemade ski videos, which admitedly, I parodied in my own flicks.
I am not totally down on Global Storming.  The skiing, scenery and soundtrack are pretty good, although some of the photography and sound quality isn't top notch at times - no DTS.  I just didn't find it too original -- i.e. I thought it was basically a generic flick.
It is good, however, to see a good ski movie on DVD.  I have essentially scrapped my VHS and most of the tape that go with it.",976060800,9,875,4.240963855421687
7893570,5,6305701180,"If the opening sequence of this movie, with its Metallica soundtrack, doesn't get you pumped to go skiing, best you take up badmitton.  The soundtrack is only gravy for this well- filmed ski movie, the locations will make you want to take a month off work and travel...(what doesn't make you want to take a month off work?)  I particularly enjoyed the Telemarker who ripped 45*-50* slopes Lurk-style, old,old school!  Get the DVD version, crank up the sound, and get ready to make some turns...",973728000,4,494,4.788235294117647
7893571,5,6305701180,"Excellent skiing, excellent cinematography, and really excellent soundtrack.  Great use of chapters so you can replay exactly who/what you want to see.  A bahgan price.  If you've read this far you need to own this.",967593600,,215,5.085714285714285
7893572,5,6305701180,"This movie was incredible! anyone who enjoys the new type of skiing, such as 70 foot cliffs, rodeo 720's, and any awsome trick you will see it in here!",955497600,,151,4.241379310344827
7893573,5,6305701180,This movie had some sick moves in it and it had a great sound track. Good mix of powder skiing and tricks. Best skiing movie I have ever seen,952646400,,141,3.896551724137931
7893574,5,6305701180,This is the best ski movie (next to Scott Gaffney's 1999).  The soundtrack is rockin' and the skiing is awesome.  Brad Holmes' rap is great too.  buy this movie.  you will be blown away.,951091200,7,186,4.382352941176471
7893575,5,6305701180,This is the best extreme and freeskiing movie ever!  Seth Morrisons fight with the avalanche is incredible!  You even get to see Brad Holmes's music video!,949449600,,155,4.923076923076923
