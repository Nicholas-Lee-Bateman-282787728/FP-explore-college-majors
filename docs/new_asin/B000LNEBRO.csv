8162346,5,B000LNEBRO,Saw this as a kid on PBS and it still holds up.  Great movie to show the little ones.  Love the idea that we must keep growing as people and that it is essential to dream beyond our own circumstances.,1436832000,,200,3.975
8162347,1,B000LNEBRO,"I still have the video version and wanted to get the DVD, since I no longer have a video player. I was very disappointed to read the reviews saying that the DVD for sale here has been edited...and that the ""mystery"" elements are gone. I'm not buying the DVD now and instead I'm going to look for a decent used video player. This company could have made two versions if they felt the need to sanitize the film for today's over-sensitive public. A warning label could have been provided. One wonders what they'd do to a fairy tale. Good grief.",1409270400,,541,4.42
8162348,5,B000LNEBRO,"Love it! My grown- up children are loving watching their childhood movie again.
It is a great family friendly movie!",1395360000,,116,4.85
8162349,1,B000LNEBRO,"To start, the one star rating I have given is for the fact that this original TV show that aired long ago in its entirety has been edited for the DVD release.

I was going to buy this DVD because I want all the wonderworks programs on DVD, and now I won't because people are saying its been edited. And, one reviewer said the DVD producers said they cut parts because they thought people would be offended. Geez... This is NOT North Korea OR China where everything must be censored!!! This is a FREE country. Why would they censor this program for??? It's not THEIR problem if people are stupid enough to get offended over something. It is OUR right to be able to buy NON edited programs. Who the heck do they think they are?!? If people don't like it, they can re-sell it. Geez... Why ruin a good program for the rest of us who are not so stupid that we get offended over everything?

Anyway, I am really glad I read the reviews. I am really disappointed and I'm glad I didn't waste my money.",1345507200,3,993,4.276595744680851
8162350,5,B000LNEBRO,"This story video can be a springboard for lessons about prejudice, social differences, tolerance, and multiculturalism. I have used this video in my classroom for the past 8 years, in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade classes.",1340755200,,216,5.027777777777778
8162351,1,B000LNEBRO,I bought 2 Gryphon DVD's and come to find out THIS IS NOT THE TV RELEASE VERSION OF THE FILM.  IT IS EDITED!!  MAJOR parts of the movie are missing!!!  We called the distributor up and apparently it has been edited because some parts of the original might offend people???????  The original was truly a family film!,1268611200,6,315,4.473684210526316
8162352,5,B000LNEBRO,I work in an elementary school and this was shown to our third graders as part of their reading. This film got a thumbs up from all classes who stated that they would love to see it again.,1215648000,,188,3.973684210526316
8162353,2,B000LNEBRO,"I'm very, very disappointed by the DVD version of this film.  I saw the original a long time ago and was enchanted by it, and for that reason I bought a copy for my granddaughters to enjoy.  However this version cuts out nearly all of why the orginal was so good, all the magic, wonder and spirit of the original version are gone and nothing is left of why Ms. Ferenczi was so very special.  Very disappointing, in spite of other reviews I took a chance but feel cheated by the editing of the film.",1190332800,10,498,4.221052631578948
