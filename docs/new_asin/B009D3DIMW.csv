5317182,1,B009D3DIMW,"How did Amazon think this was a smart move?? Hundreds of people await the release of season 2 and 3, yet they waste time putting this together! Give us season 2 and 3!!",1348531200,8,168,4.121212121212121
5317183,2,B009D3DIMW,"Most of us bought Season 1 when it was released however many years ago. Then they re-released Season 1 like 1 or 2 years ago (for whatever reason). Now they are releasing 2 different ""best of Season 1"" and now the 24 hour marathon. This is ridiculous and makes absolutely no sense. Just release Seasons 2 and 3 already. Stop doubling up and wasting our time and your money making DVDs the fans don't want to buy.",1348185600,86,412,4.363636363636363
5317184,2,B009D3DIMW,"This looks like a best of all three seasons - after comparing the episodes with the actual list of Episodes on IMDb.  I also agree with the other two.  I have S1, and would dearly LOVE a complete set of S2 and a complete set of S3, not a mix of all three.  Those of us that watched and loved the show, I'm sure would all agree on that.  Come out with complete sets of S2 and S3 and yeah - then I'll buy.  I had thought about this one until I read the reviews and then did some further checking.  Thanks but no thanks on a 8 disc 24 hour Marathon.",1348185600,9,546,3.830357142857143
5317185,1,B009D3DIMW,"odd way to release episodes, i think.  is there some royalty issue or prohibitive clause that doesn't allow for releasing all season episodes in order? most of the purchasing public would prefer that over a hodgepodge. maybe won't spend the money on this version.",1348185600,38,263,4.9772727272727275
5317186,1,B009D3DIMW,"This show is in my top three all time favs list and I'd give my first born for S2 and S3 on DVD. But just S1 (which, let's face it, most fans bought soon as it was released some years back) and S2 and not even all the episodes in either? Sorry, I'm not parting with cash for that ripoff! PLEASE, give us a DVD release of S2/S3 complete and I'll bite your hand off for it. But not for this travesty.",1348185600,50,398,3.8658536585365852
5317187,2,B009D3DIMW,"I don't know why you can't find a ""complete"" series on-line
Of the 24 hours they selected, they left out important episodes like:
the actual series finale, the introduction of Noah, and linked episodes like
Cody's adventure with Hezekiah Horne.",1372636800,5,244,5.125
5317188,4,B009D3DIMW,"this is a great cast of characters playing well written episodes.  for just good wholesome western programming, this is a good prospect and was well worth my time.",1367193600,,163,4.821428571428571
5317189,1,B009D3DIMW,"I too have been waiting for years since I purchased Season One for Seasons two and three to come out.  I see that I can now purchase season three, but where is season two??  C'mon already!",1366588800,,188,4.194444444444445
5317190,4,B009D3DIMW,I have found season 1 and 3 but I cant find season 2 anywhere online or in store. Having season 2 would help before I see 3 lol....,1364515200,,131,3.7142857142857144
5317191,5,B009D3DIMW,"This is a wonderful show that I have loved for a long time. I enjoyed how this collection of episodes was put together, because it gave me the opportunity to see episodes from the 2 & 3 seasons that haven't been available for a very long time.",1362441600,,243,4.191489361702128
5317192,5,B009D3DIMW,I bought this for my dad who has alzheimers for Christmas. The only thing he's interested in anymore is TV and mom's getting sick of the same old Lucy  and Beverly Hillbilly shows. I bought a bunch of old western series and they love them!,1361750400,,239,4.311111111111111
5317193,5,B009D3DIMW,This was a great western series. We wish Season 2 would be availabe. Just ordered season 3. This maraton is great a mixture of the 3 seasons.,1360627200,,141,4.2592592592592595
5317194,5,B009D3DIMW,i loved this show and they all work and all in color.  thanks you for these now i am waiting for season 3 with the wedding in it i hope.  i have not seen all these for a long time and i have alway wanted the tv series so i can watch them any time i want to.  THANKS YOU VERY MUCH  I HAD THEM WATCHED IN 3 DAYS. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE SERIES. AND I WILL BE HAPPY WITH THE THIRED SERIES TOO IF THEY ALL WORK.,1360540800,,408,3.5
5317195,5,B009D3DIMW,Like everyone else I'd like to see years 2 & 3 on video. At the same time I'm happy to get anything I can. As for the video I'm thrilled with it. Great quality and a good selection of episodes. Are some good ones missing? Yes but it's a good time filler until yr 3 (which is due 01/29/13) & eventually yr 2 are released. However we have to wait until copyright & other legal issues are worked out by the new distributor. So this video (which is what the review SHOULD be for) is well worth the money if you truly love the show.,1358380800,,527,4.0285714285714285
5317196,1,B009D3DIMW,"I, too, have been frustrated re the slow release of Season 2 and Season 3 of the Young Riders.  But now I found an answer. Hulu.com is offering, for free (with some commercials inserted) Season 2 if you can see all the episodes on your computer. Meanwhile I await the release of Season 3 on DVD from Amazon which I will buy.",1357776000,,324,4.225806451612903
5317197,3,B009D3DIMW,"I LIVED for this series as a teenager growing up in Texas....riding horses and being of Native American heritage....LOVED IT! I almost died when I saw this boxed set at a large retail store...so in my 40s now, my mom giggled and bought it for me for Christmas.....imagine my surprise when it is NOT the entire series (which shouldn't a box set be ALL of them??) There are bloopers in the editing (spots will replay as if you hit rewind!) and blank spots where a commercial would have been...just really crappy editing!

I KNOW that us die hards would kill for a NICE box set of ALL of the season!  WHY not just do the series justice and release them already!  This is an ok compilation...but it would be nice if it were A: complete and B: in order!!!
Just my 2 cents worth.....",1356739200,9,777,4.381944444444445
5317198,1,B009D3DIMW,"All I have to say is, SERIOUSLY?? Who are the idiots releasing these, my feelings are shared with the other reviewers.",1354752000,,118,4.666666666666667
5317199,3,B009D3DIMW,I almost bought this set because I love this show.  But I just saw a recent article that TGG Direct (the same company that released this set) is going to release the Complete Third Season sometime in November 2012.  They're also working on some roadblocks to Season 2.  So it's getting closer!  I guess we just need to be patient.  I have Season 1 as well and there's always streaming if you need a Season 2 or 3 fix.  I like this box set only because it's SOMETHING but I probably won't purchase it.,1350950400,2,500,4.26595744680851
5317200,1,B009D3DIMW,we want seasons 2 and 3. what is the big hold up? I think everyone would be more than happy to pay top dollar for the whole set.,1350518400,,128,3.607142857142857
5317201,2,B009D3DIMW,"Unfortunately, fans are in a conundrum with this ridiculous release. We all want seasons 2 and 3 released in their entirety. We don't really want to buy this hodge-podge, but the fact of the matter is....if we don't buy it, the powers that be will say ""see, nobody cares about this show - why should we release seasons 2 and 3?""

The only way to get seasons 2 and 3 released is to buy stupid releases like this. So, I'm torn. I don't wanna waste the money. Then again, I would love to see (and own) season 2 and 3 episodes that I've not seen in years...and I want to convince these idiots that complete season 2 and 3 releases are worth doing...

still pondering whether or not to buy....",1350086400,,688,4.2846153846153845
5317202,1,B009D3DIMW,I agree with everyone - I want season 2 and 3.  Release them and be done with it - make the fans happy.  We're the ones spending the money.  What a load of crap - we all have season 1.,1349913600,,184,3.55
5317203,1,B009D3DIMW,"the Garr Group bought the rights for TYR from MGM/Sony and due to contact by many fans to TGG, they plan to release full season discs. The message I got from them was ""please be patient, as we plan to release full seasons, however it may not happen until 2013"" and they went on to say that they are still going over all the licensing to make sure they have full rights to release every episode in every season. I get that, as sometimes music rights expire, or estate lawsuits take place concerning an actor's appearance, etc . . . .

Now I see there's an Amazon pre-order option for what is billed as the complete Season 3 of Young Riders releasing this month.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Young-Riders-Complete-Season-Three/dp/B009OE2O1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Young Riders Complete Season Three</a>&nbsp;It says it's one disk though, which I don't get how they can fit 23 (might be 24) episodes on one disk . . . BUT - I'm ordering it because I want TGG to know that I'm serious about wanting this full series released ASAP!

Lord knows we've waited long enough, and I will be ordering sets as gifts along with probably needing to replace my own sets after watching them to death. Might as well get my point across with $$, so they will follow through.",1349827200,5,1304,4.977064220183486
5317204,1,B009D3DIMW,"We have been waiting over 6 years for Seasons 2 and 3 to be released and they produce this? Where on earth is the logic with this release. This must be the only TV series in history that has not been released in full on DVD. The thing that worries me is that this is going to be a very poor seller and they will use it as a guide to not release S2&3. Whoever is responsible for future releases of this great series, pull your finger out and give the fans what they want!!",1349049600,7,471,3.968421052631579
5317205,1,B009D3DIMW,I agree with everyone else... just give us seasons two and three!!!!  We're waiting!!  WE WANT THEM!!!  WE'LL BUY THEM!!!!,1348963200,18,122,5.0
5317206,1,B009D3DIMW,At first I thought they were finally releasing the second and third seasons! I am disappointed to find out this is not the case! I have been waiting for years for seasons 2 and 3 to come out! What an evil and deceptive trick to play on fans!!,1348617600,,242,4.0625

8539871,1,B009D3DIMW,Poor quality: Half of the movies would freeze up and not continue or start up but skip over much of the movie.,1440288000,3,110,4.045454545454546
8539872,5,B009D3DIMW,REALLY ENJOYED THIS OLD PROGRAM,1425168000,,31,5.4

8539876,4,B009D3DIMW,Thanks,1404950400,,6,6.0
8539877,5,B009D3DIMW,Great to have these available episodes on DVD while waiting for the full seasons to finally be released. Quality is crisp and clean and I no longer have to fast forward through the old Odyssey Channel commercials on my VHS episodes I recorded back in the 90s. Box case is wonderful to have on display in the entertainment center and is made a great gift to my sister who is also a die-hard fan and recently had a 1860's Pony Express themed wedding. A must have for all Young Riders Fans as it preserves some of the best television ever made. Can't wait to finally have all the episodes on DVD.,1379462400,,593,4.351351351351352
