This film was original released in 1942, is presented in Full-screen format, b&w and runs for about 109mins (1hr 49mins).

5132352,5,B0085A9K62,"When I was in grade school in the 1960's this film was a staple that was televised every Sunday afternoon during the Veteran's day or 4th of July weekend on WNEW, Channel 5 in New York along with ""Destination Tokyo"",""Bataan"", ""Action in the North Atlantic"" and ""Thirty Seconds over Tokyo"" but out of all of them, this was my favorite of the bunch then and still is today !!

This is a typical big budget""Grade A"" MGM Production with a superb cast headed by Robert Taylor {LT Gregg  Masterman}, Charles Laughton {Rear Admiral Thomas}, Walter Brennan {Chief Yeoman Johnson}, Brian Donlevy {LT Commander Roberts} along with a slew of well known/regarded character actors - Henry O'Neil, Chill Wills, Douglas Dumbrille, William Tannen, Douglas Fowley and Byron Foulger as a pharmacist`s mate compelled to go above and beyond his duty  in a very novel way !!

Also in a starring role is their command - the WW 1 era destroyer the U.S.S. Warren brought back from near scrap heap condition. C. Laughton's characther {his nickname is ""Old Iron Pants""} is excellent in giving a fire and brimstone address to the ships company when recommissioning her {including quoting John Paul Jones ""I have not yet begun to fight""} and also realistically tells the crew {and the 1943 viewing audience} that ""We are compelled to fight this generation's war partly with the last generation's ships"" - a truism  in 1943.

This production is an good example of MGM product - entertaining and effective movie -making on many levels in particular in showing that a unrequited love between a man {W.Brennan} and his ship {the Warren} far from being ridiculous can seem real and even touching due the sincerity and dignity of W.Brennan's performance. B.Donlevy is properly restrained as the veteran officer recalled to duty from the retired list and now picked by Laughton to assume command of the Warren and a raw crew to whip them into shape. Donlevy gets command of the Warren due to a ""smarty pants"" manuver by R. Taylor's smooth and {initially} supercilious rich, well connected staff officer who also is Laughton's chief aide. Laughton then gives Taylor his ""commer-uppence"" by unexpectedly {and with barely restrained relish} appointing him to be the executive officer of the Warren thus throwing together two very different types of officers that will have to learn how to work together regardless of class, education and smoking preferences {Pipe vs cigarette}. The veteran commander {Donlevy} will by grit, experience and example teach the hotshot young officer {Taylor} what command responsibility in a warship really entails and this is a major theme within the story-line.

 While the Warren is working up to full efficiency she is unexpectedly assigned to be the flank guard of a large Pacific convoy commanded by {of course} Laughton outrageously {but enjoyably} over acting and sprouting some wonderfully fruity dialogue including such gems as ""I've always wanted a crack at one of those pagoda masted buzzards"" and an emphatic ""Shot in the Rear"" but I won't reveal what or how that one plays out! While on the way to the convoy several unexpected situations develop almost simultaneously thus complicating the command, control and fighting ability of the Warren at a critical moment in a unexpected clash with the Imperial Japanese Navy. These obstacles /problems will bring out the best of the officers and men of the Warren in regards to their fighting ability and their humanity.

Amid the slew of outstanding performances, Robert Taylor remains the center of the film - brash yet compassionate, inexperienced yet competent, initially resentfull of being picked to serve on the Warren and gradually coming to realize how and what the command of men in wartime entails. Taylor seems to enjoy playing  this role and his performance is really excellent. The production values are very good and Robert Z. Leonard, a very competent long serving MGM ""house director"" moves the movie along smartly. This isn't an all time classic film but judging it as a movie of it's time as a entertaining, rousing, flag -waving, WW 11 drama /adventure with some unexpected twists - I recommend this film and enthusiastically give it a 4  star rating.",1350000000,9,4220,5.022889842632332

5132354,4,B0085A9K62,"Nice to see this one ""Remastered,"" but a dual-layer factory disc would've rendered a more detailed picture.  Definitely a WWII ""Flag-Waver"" (not that there's anything wrong with that), with a plot that encompasses, and sometimes veers between, Drama , Action, Comedy and Pathos, you nonetheless will be greatly entertained.  A very fine cast, Robert Taylor, Brian Donlevy, Charles Laughton, Marilyn Maxwell, Chill Wills and Walter Brennan, who steals the movie every time he appears (which is quite a feat itself against a well-cured ham like Laughton!), helps to bolster a linear plot that like their ship, drifts off course every so often.  A welcomed better-late-than-never release......",1340928000,4,690,5.490566037735849
5132355,4,B0085A9K62,"The viewer must place themselves back in the dark year 1942. The Allies were getting whipped on all fronts. Hollywood ""answered the call"" by providing films which were emotional and inpirational. STAND BY FOR ACTION is an excellent example of this type of film.

The plot for the film is the ship WARREN which is a WW1 era four stack destroyer. Ships in storage were rushed back into service to replace wartime losses. (In fact, the Imperial Japanese Navy puts about 40% of our 1935 Navy on the bottom.) The movie is heavy in sentimentality but fortunately gets thick into naval combat near the end of the movie.

Its great to see the classic actors; Donlevy, Laughton, Brennan, and of course Robert Taylor... who virtually plays ""himself"" as a sissy Harvard Grad who thinks the Navy is only a social club. He sobers up nicely in the movie and I enjoy his character.

Charles Laughton portrays a great stuffy admiral and has a major character in the film. Of course we all know him from THE MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY. This isn't such a bad movie to teach some leadership skills on unusual problems.

Me being from a Navy family, the ship's portrayal is good and any destroyermen will enjoy this film. The film's restoration to DVD is good quality and I waited for its release. Not an ""epic"" film, but still first rate.

I'm still looking for the navy film where the GM/loader drops his asbestos gloves in the 5""/30 turret and cooks his hands handling spent shells. Whats its name?",1340236800,17,1475,4.614503816793893

This is an up-date on this film being in the navy for about thirty years there are several discrepancies that I have noticed. first they do not ask the executive officer to handle any emergency on deck, or the yeoman, that is the job of the boatswain mate he is in charge of the deck, if either of those two previously were injured,and the captain were incapacitated the ship would be in peril, as for wearing of the typical uniform the only one who wore it properly was Walter Brennan, this was Hollywood's decision and they messed up big time.

5132373,3,B0085A9K62,"Interesting film. Too broad a mix and therefore misses the mark.. If it had focused on just naval operations and the relationships of men at war it could have been one of the greats. Especially since whoever wrote the screenplay knew some naval warfare tactics. If I recall correctly from reading the Last of the Tin Can Sailors the warfare final series of scenes seems like it is telling the future of the actual battle to come in Leyte in the Pacific.. That in itself is amazing. But instead it does a cross of greatness with a ridiculous 'operation petticoat' angle which is completely out of place and played for laughs. A feel good film that doesn't know whether to go drama or comedy and therefore tends to the surface with excellent performances by a first rate cast with some great lines, mostly given to Laughton, and a lot of navy culture. It still could have been a serious powerful film with just Laughton providing the mixture of wisdom and humor (with just a little bit of toning down on his delivery--less G&S and more The Cruel Sea), and it would have been great. I have to say I'm very over Walter Brennan. Talk about an overexposed actor and playing the same shtick, grating voiced character in every film. Enough of it. I now feel he ruins a movie if he's cast and I automatically lose 20 percent or more interest in watching a film if I see his name attached. How did he get so much work? Just imagine all the great character actors who lost opportunities to work, to develop rich and unique characterizations themselves, and be seen due to his constant hiring.",1441929600,,1581,4.5508771929824565

5132380,4,B0085A9K62,"Other reviewers have mentioned the great military look and feel of this film and the all star cast which steps up to the plate. This film is almost entirely on board a ship and the military practices and confrontations are engaging and exciting. However, what needs to also be reviewed about this film is the way the film makers actually achieved two films in one. About half way into the movie, the storyline goes in a direction that no viewer could have expected and (without giving the story away) you feel like you have changed the channel and are watching a different film with comic undertones. By the end of the film, it all seems to fit together but the story is so implausible that logical people might have problems with this film. If it is approached for entertainment purposes only, anyone can enjoy this movie but as a military film it is more glamour than substance.",1437436800,,880,4.611464968152866

However the main part of the film deals with navigating in rough seas and a battle with a Japanese Battleship.  The combination of action, drama and humor makes a nice combination for a film of the period. Hope this helps.
