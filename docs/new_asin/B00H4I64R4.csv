He remembers his grandmother talking about the hanging.  it was great to hear more of this part of his family in a little more detail.  Thanks for putting this together. !,1467936000,,246,4.4222222222222225

8629883,5,B00H4I64R4,I found out about Bad Tom Smith through a distant family relation and I purchased this out of curiosity. I didn't know what to expect but I thought it was well done and very interesting in terms of going through the history of not only Bad Tom but also the Appalachian/Kentucky history of that time period.  Overall - well done and very interesting.,1401667200,,349,4.5396825396825395
8629884,5,B00H4I64R4,"I bought this to see if my knowledge of Bad Tom Smith matched with this documentary-- it did and, good or bad, Bad Tom was my wife's Great-Great-Great Uncle.  He was her grandmother's Uncle and she had heard a lot about Bad Tom all her life.  I learned a few things about Bad Tom that I did not know.  I did not realize he was a ""Dandy."". My wife and I always pictured him as an unkempt person maybe in bib-overalls, etc.  I do know that his sister was Nancy Ann Smith and she was half Shawnee Indian which would have made Bad Tom half Shawnee.  From the pictures I have seen of him on line, he very well could have Shawnee ancestry.  From this depiction of him, I think his life could very  well be made into a movie.  The narration by Tom Wopat of Duke of Hazard fame was good.  Apparently there is a lot of interest out there about Bad Tom.  Good job.",1396656000,,854,4.090361445783133
