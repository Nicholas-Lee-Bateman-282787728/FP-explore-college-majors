3711288,5,B001N4K6K6,"Wow, This is a great instructional series that takes you all the way to Black Belt!  I have black belts in two styles of karate and have studied styles without belt ranking and nothing I have learned so far comes close to Krav Maga.  Easy to learn and retain.  Get it!",1245196800,9,268,4.215686274509804
3711289,4,B001N4K6K6,"Instructor Cohen's 6 DVD series of Krav Maga lacks the professional expertise of format that Darren Levine's now out of production series excelled in. This presentation lacks the instructional reinforcement of material that made Levine's so easy to learn. Also,Instructor Cohen's pronounced Israeli accent takes a bit of getting used to. That said,this series has a lot to offer. Instructor Cohen definitely knows his material.",1242950400,13,427,5.584615384615384
3711290,5,B001N4K6K6,"Amazing product. As someone who has practiced various fighting systems (and martial arts - there is a difference) for almost 2 decades, I can say that this was a very impressive DVD. It stays focused, handles all the necessary aspects, and has enough material for even expert level exponents (while still offering something for even the most basic beginner in the first 2 DVDs). The techniques and applications get more advanced as one goes through the 6 DVDs, and I would highly recommend this DVD set to anyone. Also, and this is important, it actually has the 6 DVDs (unlike other series advertised as '5 DVD sets' that only have 2).",1311724800,8,636,4.738738738738738
3711291,4,B001N4K6K6,"This DVD series is very functional if looking to add it as part of a regular self defense practice. Mr. Cohen covers the basics of striking with hands, elbows, shoulders, knees and kicks. He also shows the basics of physics and weight transfer for making them effective, although he does not go into detail as to why this is important. I like the fact that Mr. Cohen takes the time in his series to show you the direction of pressure for chokes and wrist locks. This is very helpful for a beginner considering if he did not show this the moves would be ineffective for wrist locks and time consuming for chokes. What I feel is left out of most series is the fact that if you are going to fight you are going to get hit. If you decide to take on a person with a knife plan on getting cut and if you try to disarm someone with a pistol it will fire in the process. Mr. Cohen shows very good techniques that emphasize personal safety and safety of others(besides your attacker).

The only real negative things that you can say about this series is that the film quality is not Hollywood and some of the techniques shown take way too much time to pull off in a real life situation. However it is a very nice set of DVD's to get yourself or family members introduced to self defense. and that's NO B.S.",1302825600,4,1297,4.272357723577236
3711292,5,B001N4K6K6,"This is great set of DVD's for anyone interested in Krav Maga, Mixed Martial Arts or basic no nonsense Self Defence. The filming is high quality and allows one to follow the action so as to be easily able to copy the techniques shown. Each of the discs covers a different topic, demonstrating likely attack scenario's, and how to defend against those attacks. Whether you're a seasoned martial artist, or a complete novice, you will find these DVD's very useful, and amongst the best available on the subject of real self defense",1284163200,,529,4.760869565217392

3711294,5,B001N4K6K6,"This is a great Krav Maga series; Cohen is an excellent instructor. I use it as a addition to my other training, but this series is a great foundation for a beginner or a supplement to experienced martial artists.",1277510400,7,213,4.487179487179487
3711295,5,B001N4K6K6,"I've been taking Krav Maga for about eight months and sometimes watch these videos for a little treat on the side. Some of the techniques differ from those we do in my IKMF class, but that is not necessarily bad.

This guy knows his stuff and I enjoy listening to the Hebrew accent as he slaps around the skinny guy on the DVD cover.",1266796800,5,333,4.203125
3711296,3,B001N4K6K6,"This is a good series of DVDs.  It does start from the very beginning, so some of it is very basic punching, kicking, and blocking.  But then it moves into some much more advanced techniques, including grappling and weapons.  So, it does indeed seem to cover the range of skill levels that it claims to, from yellow to black belt.  The techniques seem very reasonable (I hold a black belt in Goju Ryu myself).

The production quality is fine.  No bells and whistles, but everything is well lit with a nice, clean, light-colored background in the studio (which helps the visual presentation) and things are shown from a variety of angles.

A number of reviewers have commented on Mr. Cohen's accent. While it is thick, I had no trouble understanding what he was saying.  So no problem there.

Mr. Cohen does often blow through some combinations very quickly (too quickly I think).  The rewind button on my DVD player got a good workout from me going back several times to figure out what he just did.  The DVDs would have been better if more time was taken to break the techniques down in more detail.  He does explain what he's doing most of the time, but doesn't really go into the finer details of it.  And there were some techniques that he threw in from time to time without ever explaining what they were.

If you have other martial arts training, you can probably follow what he's doing without much difficulty.  But if you're a brand new beginner, I think you'll need more explanation of what's going on.

And definitely don't try some of these things at home without additional explanation because some of the moves are quite dangerous.  There are some head cranks in there (twisting the head violently to break the neck), a number of joint locks, and some gun disarms.

On the gun disarms, I didn't hear much about gun safety on the DVDs, which concerned me a bit. (I've done some competitive pistol shooting.)  Although he was obviously using a dummy gun on the DVDs, he didn't really explain that before jumping into the techniques (NEVER, NEVER do this sort of stuff with a real gun, even if you think it's unloaded).  And in executing some of these techniques he didn't really explain the risks of what happens when (not if) the gun goes off in real life (you can't crank a gun around to the side with your opponent's finger on the trigger and expect that it won't go off while trying to wrench it from their hand...even if you don't get hit with the bullet, you're not likely to maintain a grip on the top of a semi-auto when the slide cycles).

I give the series three stars because on the positive side, Mr. Cohen covers a lot of ground and there's a lot of good information there.  Because I have other martial arts background, I felt like the series gave me a good orientation into Krav Maga.  On the negative side, the verbal explanations of the techniques could have been more thorough, particularly for that part of the audience with no prior background, and particularly for those techniques where inexperienced partners training at home could really hurt themselves or each other without further explanation.

As a side note, I have to say that as the series went on I was feeling more and more sorry for Mr. Cohen's assistant who was the recipient of much of the mayhem in the DVDs.  Although Mr. Cohen was obviously pulling his punches in the demos, he was often making at least light contact, and his assistant seemed to get up off the floor a little more slowly after each time.",1263168000,44,3505,4.578525641025641
3711297,5,B001N4K6K6,"If you can get past the accent, you can get into more martial arts helpful knowledge than in any course out there!
The first night I popped the DVD in I was throwing punches like a pro and could take down anyone with a handstrike.
Give it to the ones you love to make sure they won't be victims!
100% Awesome.",1256256000,6,309,4.081967213114754
3711298,4,B001N4K6K6,"I'm new to Krav Maga, having taken it up as part of a personal fitness program.  In looking for material to augment the instruction classes I've signed up for, I researched all the video programs I could find.  After reading the reviews by experienced Krav Maga students here and at other sites, I decided that Alain Cohen's set would be the best suited to accompany my classes and give me something to practice to at home.

I have only watched the first two videos so far, yellow and orange, because I don't want to get too far ahead of myself.  I have found the vids to be exactly what I was looking for.  As others have said, Alain's accent is rather thick, but after you've listened to him awhile you don't notice it as much.  Plus, all the moves are introduced with English titles, so you can read what he is going to demonstrate.  There is nothing fancy about the videos, but Krav Maga isn't a fancy Martial Art - that's why I took it up.  The videos are well produced, straight forward instruction.  Each move is clearly explained, and shown from various angles.  I am pleased with this set of instructional videos and would purchase them again.  Well suited for beginners who plan to advance in the sport.",1256083200,20,1213,4.493150684931507
3711299,5,B001N4K6K6,"If you're looking for movie production quality you'll be disappointed. I on the otherhand was absolutely delighted.

That's actually one of the things that I LIKE about this production. Yes, his accent takes some getting used to but the techniques go far beyond what's covered in the Lavine series. I also think that they are better illustrated & introduce the veiwer to the more combative aspects of Krav Maga as opposed to the glorified Tai Bo that seems to have become the norm. You're not going to be shown how to throw a punch in this video. I would say that it's more of an application based set than techniques. Still... I think that the variety of content has the Levine series beat for those who are looking for something a bit ""meatier"". (They actualy could compliment each other to a significant degree I suppose.)

While each technique is not detailed to a nauseating level... they are demonstrated well enough that a discerning student of Krav Maga (or any other art) can  pick them apart. The lighting is better than that of the Levine production... as it's much less ""Hollywood"". I purchased the other DVD series long ago & have also acquired some of the Kapap material as well. IMHO there's more to this type of product than the production methods. Cohens strength is in his unique knowledge based on his training of security  personnel in Israel & Internationally.

If you enjoy DVD content that goes beyond the basics (giving you more than kickboxing) I think that you'll be very happy with this series. I think it makes a much better companion to student training than the other set.

8323225,5,B001N4K6K6,"The six DVDs in this set will take you belt by belt all the way to black belt. Each video is a different belt rank.

I have a 2nd degree Black Belt in Tang Soo Do (Moo Duk Kwan), a Black Belt in Shotokan, and have studied Muay Thai for about 5 years, so it was easy for me to pick up and practice the movements demonstrated by Kohen.

Those who do not have a pre-honed hand-eye coordination should not buy these videos, but should head down to a local dojo and train the old fashioned way.

Kohen does have a Hebrew accent, but it did not bother me at all and his English is good.

I would highly recommend this video to all previously trained persons interested in Krav Maga, as it is straight forward and to the point without any fancy Hollywood dung. This is real Krav Maga, not the ""McKravmaga"" or the ""Tai-Bo Krav Maga"" being taught in most dojos in the US today.",1372204800,,868,4.179640718562874

8323228,1,B001N4K6K6,"WARNING!

First of all what is Krav Maga? Krav Maga is a style that takes from multiple combative styles...much like Bruce Lee's JKD system. Aggressive, effective, but with many flaws. Alain Cohen is a self decorated grandmaster of his own Krav Maga style. Where is the accountability? How does one know that he is a grandmaster? You don't...you only go on his word, and a few certificates that he took pictures of and stuck on his website. That does not make you a krav maga master, or a grand master in the art. It does however show one thing, and that is what is his intention, and why doesn't the Krav Maga Federation out of Israel endorse this guy? I mean they are internationally recognized, and this guy is self recognized.

Now all that aside look at his knife techniques. Do you really think that blocking a knife attack with a ridge hand and punching a dude in the face at the same time while timing the attack is going to work? Do you really think that combating someone with a knife with an  ineffective empty hand system is a good idea? The most proficient system within the combative arts to deal with that kind of threat is Arnis, or what we would call the Filipino Martial Arts, Kali, or the Indonesian art of Pekiti Tirsia. Research it for your self...better yet take a training knife, grab a buddy and role play. Have him hit you at an angle that you do not expect and see if what this guy teaches is effective. Have your training partner attack you with full force and block that knife attack the way Alain Cohen teaches you and see if you stop that blade from stabbing you. If you are small and weak then force on force blocks like that will not work for you and is very misleading to people who do not truly understand combat.

You need to educate yourself with the correct information before you formulate an opinion about combat and the art of fighting. Now I'm not saying that Krav Maga is bad, but what I am saying is it's a system that pulls from multiple styles, which is fine, but not every style of Krav Maga is the most effective style of Krav.

As for his business ethics. Do not get into business with this guy. He charges 13,000.00 plus to come and do a seminar. You pay this guy 1000.00 and he'll give you a level one belt. You bring him to do a seminar he'll give you a black belt. You have a Krav School, he'll up the belt prices for the cost of testing. This dude is about money, as most business's are but to dish out belts just because you pay him some money is just wrong and goes against the Martial Art Code of conduct.

You want to study the combative system? Look at Danny Inosanto, Rick Tucci, Remy Presas, Dr. Remy Presas,Sifu Kanishka Sharma, and Grand Tuhon Leo T. Gaje jr. Now once you research these guys you'll now have a good place to start. At that point look at their influences, teachers, styles, and years of study at which will validate their accreditation.

You won't have to go far. Save your money, and if it is too good to be true most likely it's not. Remember people are out to sell you things, take your money and mislead you, and to fill their own pockets and ego. No one can be a black belt in an art in 6 disks, and if you believe that you can then you will reap what you have sown.

Inform yourself.",1339027200,13,3267,4.300813008130081
