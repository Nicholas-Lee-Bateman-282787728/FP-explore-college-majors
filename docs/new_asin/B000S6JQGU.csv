8366380,1,B000S6JQGU,"The box claims that I Puke On Your Grave is ""one  of the most controversial horror films ever."" That load of crap makes me want to puke myself. This is not even a real movie. It's a collection of scenes from cheapo horror films from over the last 40 years, all edited together in some random montage.

The film opens with a short title card, and a video clip of some guy puking with other guys laughing in the background. Perhaps it was Johnny Knoxville's ""Jackass"" audition tape. Anyway...

The first scene looks promising as it depicts zombie schoolgirls with no pants on eating their head mistress, but the rest is downhill. Some scenes are creepy, and some are pointless as there is no action. And being that these are all scenes edited together from about 50 different films there is obviously no real cohesive story going on.

The ""movie"" ends with a clip of a chase scene through the woods. Just as the dumb girl is about to get it by this gigantic knife, the screen freezes and ""The End"" appears on the screen, a graphic that looks like it was done on a Mac, pre-Photoshop. What's even lamer is there are no credits; they don't tell you the titles of any of the films they used. How was that legal? So you're completely left in the dark unless you're one of the top horror buffs in the world. I've seen many a horror film in my day, and the only film I even recognized was a scene from Wes Craven's ""The Hills Have Eyes."" A couple other clips looked very Dario Argento.

The only reason I bought this was because I found it for $0.99 in a bargain bin. It's only about an hour long, but feels much longer. I'm surprised I even sat through the first 10 minutes.  This ""movie"" is definitely not worth the time or money.",1270598400,2,1724,4.355140186915888
