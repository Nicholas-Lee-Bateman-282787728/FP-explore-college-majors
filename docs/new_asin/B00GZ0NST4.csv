6124286,5,B00GZ0NST4,"I love to watch all of the documentary about Food Inc, Gas Hole, Who kill the electrict car, and etc..  I got this from the library and was glad our library has it.  Thank you so much for creating this video.  I hardly can stand the milk, but my kids consumed huge amount and mature faster rate than I expected.  I never heard of cancer, asthma, or heart attack from where I grow up.  Now, 90% of people I knew either died of cancer, having cancer, had bipass surgery, etc. Thanks again for the info.",1322179200,16,500,4.221052631578948
6124287,1,B00GZ0NST4,"I waited a long time for this film to be released. They have wonderful scientists featured who could have been organized into a logical informative documentary but most of the film is focused on making very poorly educated people look stupid. I had three friends over to watch it and they were bored and complained about it ""dragging"". I am sure there is footage on the cutting room floor that could still be made into a educational and influential film. An opportunity to get an important message out has been missed.",1321056000,16,518,4.7032967032967035
6124288,1,B00GZ0NST4,"I am already convinced about the benefits of a dairy free diet.  This documentary was completely lacking in credibility and was most unprofessional - a complete waste of time and money.  It was basically a road trip of a few college students attempting to inform us about dairy products and the detrimental effects on our health. I was increasingly irritated while viewing it and the fact that it had cost $25.  I wouldn't even GIVE this away - I threw it in the trash.  There is so much better, credible and professional information available on this subject and I'd hate to see the producers rip off anyone else.",1319932800,31,614,4.657407407407407

6124290,5,B00GZ0NST4,"Thank You! Finally, someone (Shira and her team) has the will and boldness (chutzpa)to show and tell it like it is; to teach us to question what we are told and almost forced to accept as true.

About a month before seeing this wonderfully presented documentary, I'd given up dairy products, hoping it would help inflammation/bursitis problems I've been having for far too long.  I'm feeling so much better, although it takes time.

Not only did the documentary reinforce my decision, it taught me to question everything - to think for myself about what is NATURAL and what now is so obvious.

It's not only about health, it is about the environment and education, about how the system works; MONEY, MONEY, MONEY:
From government and industry to our stomach. It's about government's best customers (mega-corporations - like the dairy industry) and their control over our education system, animals and the farming industry.  It's also about the effects of media and ignorance.

Shira utilizes media to educate and to open our eyes! I highly recommend this important documentary/movie, and suggest you do the same.",1316736000,48,1112,5.049180327868853
6124291,5,B00GZ0NST4,"I watched a ""backer copy"" of this film over the summer, since the filmmaker had to fundraise (kickstarter)to get the final funding to pay for audio rights and insurance to bring the film to market.
The film explores the American conceptions around milk and reveals that most Americans are well informed (by the dairy lobby, which controls the information about dairy in schools and media) and can repeat advertising slogans about dairy. Several scientists are brought in, notable Dr. Campbell of The China Study, to discuss the health implications of dairy, including the links to osteoporosis and some cancers. Also discussed are food subsidies, programs such as WIC, and the amount of dairy producs ""hidden"" in our foods.
I have a milk allergy as well, but unlike the filmaker, I lived with mine for over thirty years, consuming dairy and having consistent eczema, gas and congestion problems. When I quit dairy a year ago, the symptoms diminished immediately and I lost thirty pounds effortlessly over several months. Now if I have dairy I immediately have a runny nose, itchy eyes, eczema eruptions, and have had hives on occasion. Mainstream thinking is that ""kids grow out of"" dairy allergies, but I believe most just become manageable as mine did through constant exposure to the allergen.
The additional research is out there on the Internet. Try Google scholar to find some of those thousands of articles examining the health implications of dairy that the film mentions. It can open your eyes to something that may well be the backbone of disease in America.",1314662400,117,1568,5.011494252873563

6124294,2,B00GZ0NST4,"Well intentioned but not necessarily accurate but we learn as we go along.  My main complaint was the dropping of comments about soy being a good milk alternative in various places in the film.  IMO soy milk is probably one of the worst foods one can consume.  Soy milk is a strong IGF-1 promoter, more so than milk (just ask Dr McDougall); if you had cancer it would be a poor choice, known to damage thyroid function and suppress digestion.  Another realisation that I have come to about milk, is that much of the harm that we perceive from it, may not come from the milk itself but from the additives that it is fortified with, not to mention rBST.  Vitamin D is also a strong growth promoter and magnesium antagonist.  Drinking regular or organic store milk, my children would on occasion get nose bleeds, headaches, stomach aches - my son was also diagnosed borderline asthmatic and had a chronic cough.  Since our foray into vegan and back onto dairy, we now buy pasteurised additive free milk and have none of the complaints that existed before.  D has been added to milk since the 1930's and I'm sure that all the research linking milk to asthma was likely done using fortified milk.",1434412800,4,1191,4.584905660377358

6124299,1,B00GZ0NST4,"The producers mix the message and wind up with nothing.  On one hand there is the contrived controversy regarding the scientific facts surrounding the health impacts of drinking milk.  On the other. the deep seated confusion and ignorance and willful self-delusion among the public is portrayed very clearly.  So? The producer attempts to present himself as a noble and objective journalist showing both sides of a complex story but he ultimately chooses the role of buffoon in the last scene - as if he is just as incapable of discerning fact from propaganda as the general public. All that time and money invested and he has learned nothing.

In a clever slight of hand, he sheepishly leaves out the impact of the dairy industry on the animals themselves, choosing instead to show bucolic images of perpetually contented cows - leaving out the artificial insemination to produce a constant state of pregnancy, the infected udders,  the lifespan reduced to 25% of the cow's natural 20-year life, the immediate removal of male calves to the veal cages leaving the mother to wail in distress, and the final death sentence, the trip to the slaughterhouse, when the spent animal can no longer produce.

I suspect that the producers do understand the veracity of Drs T. Colin Campbell and Neal Barnard, but feel the public would turn away from their stark  message.  If so, the ploy has failed in my opinion. The collage of conflicting opinions is totally contrived and unnecessary - there is no attempt to enlighten.  The viewer walks away just as confused as he or she went in. There really is such a thing as the truth - it may be hard to discover - but a true journalist would not have stopped until he or she had done their best to reveal it.  If just you want to see hair-pulling examples of a low-information and apathetic public - this movie is for you.",1427414400,2,1857,4.7213622291021675

But I wouldn't recommend the video to others unless they were really, very, very interested in knowing what the dairy industry is doing and the effect dairy has on the human body.

6124307,5,B00GZ0NST4,"I admit to being a lifelong milk drinker.  I drink organic skim milk once a day.  I never knew or even thought about what was in milk until now.  And now, after watching this film I am thinking I will return the new, unopened carton of milk I just bought.

These filmmakers made an educational and fun, entertaining documentary about the health dangers of milk and, while making this movie picturesque, like a well done travelogue of the U.S., they also crammed it with alarming facts about the risks of drinking milk, chiefly the way hormones in milk can cause cancer.

How do you go about educating the American public on the dangers of milk, while making an interesting movie they want to watch?  It took a lot of skill and ingenuity and this was beautifully accomplished.  There was not one boring moment.  This was a cross country documentary showing some interesting towns and cities such as Roswell New Mexico, Shreveport, Raleigh, Memphis, all the while interviewing locals as they went along about what they thought or knew about milk.

Nutritionists and scientists with impeccable credentials were interviewed.  They emphasized, again and again, the negative health consequences of milk drinking, such as heart disease and cancer.  Milk has, by its nature, growth hormones to help calves grow into cows.  In humans, drinking these hormones can trigger cancer to grow.  It sound so obvious now that I don't know why I never thought of it before.

The milk industry spends millions on promoting milk.  Milk advertising is everywhere.  The facts about the milk industry this documentary presents are alarming.  The health risks, including asthma and auto immune diseases are described.  Anyone who has health concerns and is a milk drinker needs to see this film so they can make an informed choice about drinking cow's milk, armed with the facts.

This is the most eye opening film I've ever watched and its one that everyone who drinks milk needs to watch.  You will never feel the same way about milk.",1391817600,4,2011,4.876106194690266

I also bought FOODMATTERS, HUNGRY FOR CHANGE, FORKS OVER KNIVES, FOOD INC., SUPER SIZE ME, FAT SICK & NEARLY DEAD, GOT THE FACTS ON MILK, and TAPPED.

First I cut way, way, way back on sugar (not completely ought though.) I lost about 10 lbs in about 3 weeks. Then I bought a ""Hamilton Beach"" Big Mouth Pro Juicing Machine. I lost 20 lbs the first week doing the detox method (juicing fresh, almost all organic veggies and a little fruit.) I was not hungry, though I still had some cravings for sweets, steak, etc. It is important to know that I never let myself get hungry. I drank the 16 oz juice 3 times a day for 21 days snacking on cut up fresh veggies when I felt the need. My weight loss stalled a little, then slowly started moving again. It has been 6 weeks now and I currently have lost 40 lbs., went from a 38"" waist to a 34."" My shoes are now laced as tight as they will go and are now slip-ons. I feel & look healthier. I have a better attitude now and my doctor took me off most of my meds. He said over time, I may get off them all.

Honestly, you do have to have drive, enthusiasm, and determination. However, you do NOT have to be hungry and want to make sure you are not hungry. Otherwise you trigger a starvation involuntary bodily response to store fat due to the bodily perception of food shortage. This is only one reason why ordinary DIETS DO NOT WORK!

Are you tired of your life as it is? Hungry for dramatic change? GET BUSY! I am NOT sorry I decided to change.

6124320,2,B00GZ0NST4,"I agree with almost every substantive claim made by this documentary and bought it to play for a friend who drinks too much milk (and was undermining her immune system by the vast amount of antibiotics non-organic milk contains).  The kudos on the DVD cover make one hope for a clear coherent presentation of arguments and facts marshaled effectively against dairy products. Alas, a camera in hand and a good heart do not a movie or a movie-maker make.  The DVD is a crude piece of agitprop: dull, repetitious, mindless, and disorganized. Watching it is like hearing someone shout out what you are supposed to believe -- and just because they said so.  The few solid points were presented so quickly that there was barely time to hear them, and not enough time to think about them, let alone understand them, before the well intentioned director had distracted herself and her viewers with a zig to another sound bite, a zag to a sight-gag, or a repeat of an agitprop conclusion from a few minutes before.  Much as I wanted to inform and persuade my friend, we couldn't watch more than an hour of it and I returned the product - something that I rarely ever do.

If you want to learn about the harm caused by dairy products, the collusion of industry with the USDA, and the mass-marketing of lies to trick Americans into damaging their health for the sake of corporate profits, surf the web for serious articles.

I learned that it leaches calcium from the bones, thus osteoporosis is a problem. I learned that it is connected to prostate cancer, and my father had this form of cancer.

6124339,4,B00GZ0NST4,"An interesting doucmentary.  A point of view that most people do not hear, but should hear.  People need to educate themselves and make personal decisions rather than letting others make decisions for themselves.  This DVD is certainly helpful in educating the person that wants to be educated.",1339372800,6,294,5.212765957446808
6124340,3,B00GZ0NST4,"While its true that dairy product is not as good as they've advertised, I've always tried to inform my parents and friends who weren't well informed about milk, and they never seemed to listen, and never made an open mind to listen to the facts seriously, most of the facts presented in the film I have heard or read somewhere, its not a myth that milk products are generally bad for health.

Yet I do believed that this film itself, are biased in the way how it was edited and presented, everything have both sides, and I'm positive that there are also health benefits to dairy products as well. For example, if you're not lactose intolerance, fermented milks such as kefir and yogurt are actually very healthy for you, they were never mentioned in the film, that's about the facts about milk.

They also missed one very important pieces of fact, I believe dairy product is not as bad as it were suggested here compare to the pasteurization process itself, its that process that destroys most of the nutrients found in natural milk, I believe Natural milk or raw milk while consumed in controlled amount are actually beneficial. Go Google for milk pasteurization for more.

I would still recommend this movie to those people who are misinformed about the truth and facts about milk, because they really needed this, when TV is what influenced them to firmly believe milk is good, if there is anything, this should be the ""cure"" for them.

If I were the author, who's goal was to get the message across as far out to reach as many as possible, I would probably distribute this like how Iron sky(film) does it, they would still made enough to cover their costs but to get the film to distribute further. Think about it this way, if you were so passionate about getting an idea across to benefit society, why bother to put a price restriction on the film to limit the people who cannot afford it? I also do believe a film that are more extreme tend to sell better in comparison to those that are a bit moderate and less extreme, which tends to be less biased and more educational(ie:wikipedia's philosophy), so go figure, hence be advised and keep an open mind when watching the film.",1336953600,9,2182,4.6015424164524426

6124342,5,B00GZ0NST4,"I saw this documentary twice in 2 days because I didn't want to miss anything! It is such a great film, informative and it transmits its message in a very easy way so everyone can understand it. And it's even fun to watch!
I am a nutritionist and it's really hard to make people understand how bad milk is for you after years of getting the message from the media that milk is good for you. It is obvious that it's all about money, same as many medicines that we don't need and harm us!
Of course the USDA didn't want to comment when they were called. Such cowards! They have nothing to say because they know they are lying!",1332460800,12,624,4.208333333333333

The big dairy industry HATES local farmers who provide Raw milk to customers like me. I'm ok with paying $15 a gallon if it's good quality milk. I would NEVER drink industrial milk & I sure as hell wouldn't give it to my kids. It's POISON.,1322265600,10,338,4.467741935483871
6124346,5,B00GZ0NST4,"I fell on to this film from Dr. McDougal's emails.  Sooo glad to have found it.  I have watched it twice and would love to share it with everyone I know.  I laughed out loud many times, some of it out of sheer happiness that the message is getting out, and the other because I loved the ""realness"" of the people interviewed across the country.  It was extremely informative, bringing the theories and facts to the table without alot of gore and pain to witness.  (Which I know exists in the industry, but it can turn off viewers and lose the chance to get the message out to the masses.)  A MUST SEE!",1322179200,27,600,4.265486725663717

Many people drink the Kool Aid of TV commercials. Intermixed are interviews with scientists on what milk contains, how it is culled, and even that raising cows is more detrimental to Global Warming than...TRANSPORTION!

Upon reaching Washington they aspire to speak to someone at the USDA and shut down, which is rather frustrating to see that our government REFUSES to answer questions for general population. Topics include lactose, WIC, and Calcium. Insightful and troubling.",1526169600,,646,5.09433962264151
