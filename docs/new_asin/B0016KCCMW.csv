8262911,4,B0016KCCMW,"PLOT: 3 films in one set, Eva Braun home movies, Hitler's War....and Secret Weapons.

These are a good set. Hitler's War is pretty good shows~~~ Hitler's reasons and logic via the twisted mind of Adolph Hitler for the War. Maps and info some clearly taken from other film but over all 4 STARS~ Secret Weapons.....shows some video of the tanks and V1 and V2 rockets and what I especially found interesting is how the allies found out about them and bombed Peenemunde~ also how the Brits were able to bring down some of these terror weapons. Secret Weapons...including Jets, Rockets, Flying Bombs all..... promised by Hitler to Win the War and or turn the tide of the war....mostly produced  WAY too late in not enough quantity to turn the war in Hitler's Favor.~ Eva Braun~ she met Hitler as a photography assistant to Hoffman Hitler's official and favorite photographer and became the Mistress/Companion to Hitler. Her greatest legacy is some of these Home Movies that show Hitler and his inner circle at Berchestgartern and the Berghof.....some in Color~ This Is the BEST of the 3 DVD~ 4 STARS for Eva Braun. Worth buying the set for the Evan Braun DVD alone.",1459728000,2,1160,4.766169154228856
8262912,2,B0016KCCMW,"This set consists of three DVDs: ""Eva Braun: Hitler's Mistress,"" ""Hitler's War,"" and ""Hitler's Secret Weapons.""

The best of the three discs by far is ""Eva Braun."" If you are expecting a documentary about Braun, you'll be disappointed. The disc is actually home movies filmed by her. This DVD shows some of the personal life of Hitler and those around him. The film is not what usually shows up on most Hitler DVDs.

The same can't be said about the other two DVDs in the set. ""Hitler's War"" is an overview of the entire war using film that we've all seen a hundred times before. The soundtrack is annoying: the same Richard Wagner extract played over and over and over.

""Hitler's Secret Weapons"" is mis-titled. 95% of it is an overview of the war, and the remaining 5% is the most general and cursory review of the V1 and V2 rockets using film clips that we're all familiar with. No in-depth information is provided about the rockets.

To sum it up, if you can find this set for a few bucks, buy it for the Eva Braun home movie.",1315180800,3,1030,4.4338624338624335
