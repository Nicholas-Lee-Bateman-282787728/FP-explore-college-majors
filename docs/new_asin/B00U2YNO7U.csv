7028609,2,B00U2YNO7U,"I sorta liked it, and...
I'd LIKE to give this a FIVE-STAR rating, but, then again,
I'd like to win the lottery...
I bought this movie because of the COOL DVD-case cover-art.
The artist was GREAT;
the movie was Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, er, uh, it was 71-minutes... with NO CGI-F/X---it has stop-motion animation,
and, a hand-puppet that didn't match each other!---had 8 preview-trailers; Director's Commentary; Behind The
Scenes Featurette.
Produced by Mark Polonia; Line-Produceer, Anthony Palonia; Directed by Mark Polonia; Edited by Mark Palonia;
Lighting by Anthony Polonia; In association with Polonia Brothers Entertainment; Caterered by Maria Palonia.
Starring Danielle Donahue; Bob Dennis; Jeff Kirkendall; James Carolus; Tod Carpenter; Ken van Sant; Steve Di-
asparra, and, several friends and relatives of The Fabulous Polonia brothers!

It AIN'T Jurassic World/Park/Land... it IS a popcorn and Diet Coke B-flick.

I'll give it this much,
the bonus eight preview trailors were even l-e-s-s professional:

7028610,1,B00U2YNO7U,"first response was probably a friend of these ""Polonia"" brothers.....

this was Garage Video personified!!!!!!!!

I wouldn't even call most of the people in this movie ""actors"":  they looked like ordinary people that they just picked off the streets:  and I do mean ORDINARY:  some unusually ugly faces....

the Tyranosaurus  ""effects"" are like an amateur attempt by an 8th grader at stop motion:  there are NO CGI:  just a horrible attempt at Stop Motion, in between a mock up phony looking real life model.....

there are no words to describe just how bad this film was...and I like B dinosaur movies but this one , was below the Mendoza line....",1436400000,4,648,4.8090909090909095

7028612,4,B00U2YNO7U,"Dumb fun.  Don't go into it expecting a Jurassic Park Sci Fi channel ""mockbuster"".  This is several layers of quality below even that.  This is underneath the bottom of the barrell entertainment.  And I love it.  Its basically a remake of Mark Polonia's earlier classic ""Saurians"" but with a botched bank robbery thrown in.  Its pure Polonia style fun, done exactly the same as all their other movies.  If you love the Polonia Brothers films, you will love this.

7028616,3,B00U2YNO7U,"It had the potential to be an AMAZING piece of art. It had all of the things I expected it to have. Actors, a car, some trees, a horrible looking dinosaur that changes shape and size on a whim. The T-Rex in Jurassic Park stays the same size. That isn't scary. And it made WAY to much noise. (Well except for the visitor center scene) You always knew it was coming. Not this guy he sneaks up on you and munch munch munch. Movie had me on the edge of my seat. You never knew who was going to die next. I'm not sure if any of the deaths were scripted or just thrown in when one of the cast had to go home that night. (I assume it was shot in a day). The acting was about what you would expect from this type of movie, but for some reason, the version I saw had all of the sex scenes removed. I mean I wanted at least one anal scene, and I could tell those two chicks were going to go at it in the end. But it was missing. Still not bad acting for a porno.

7028645,2,B00U2YNO7U,"A dinosaur movie should be a dinosaur movie; not a subplot in a dinosaur movie. A poor man's stone cold Steve Austin in a Hyundai tracking down teenagers at payphones should not be the basis for a dinosaur film. When the dinosaur actually gets around to attacking people, using CGI blood spurt effects does not enhance that experience. If I was given $50 and a week, I would be able to create a dinosaur leg more convincing than the sack of marshmallows and bean bags used in this feature. They might as well have filmed chicken feet at a chicken farm which would at least be more convincing as those legs were actually descended from that of a dinosaur and not of styrofoam and plastic. 3/10",1467244800,,692,4.5

7028707,1,B00U2YNO7U,this is a movie from the stat which could give me nightmares from being so bad.  not to give  a spoiler but the dinosaur looks like a first grader idea of a monster,1446681600,,164,3.9393939393939394

7028712,1,B00U2YNO7U,"Pretty bad.... I didn't make it thru the whole movie but as bad as it was I can't imagine it improving enough to rate it better than 1 star. Acting, story, dialog all bad. It also has that look of HD video with everything in focus. Normally background is slightly out of focus to draw attention to what the director wants you to look at. Also film has that slightly grainy look.",1445558400,,378,4.263888888888889

7028722,1,B00U2YNO7U,The only value for this movie (if it ever comes out on DVD) is to use the DVD as a rear view mirror ornament in the car to scramble radar guns. (if that does in fact work) I have seen movies made by my 10-year old using his Lego blocks and a borrowed camera that are better than this trash!

7028725,1,B00U2YNO7U,"It does have the OMG! factor.  Within few minutes you will see why.  The body of the Dinosaur is so bad, you'll fall on floor laughing.  Yeah, no CGI graphics there.  Think about the previously worst monster/horror film you watched, then mix it with Blair Witch camera shots.  When it kills someone the camera moves so fast, you'll get motion sickness, you'll see some blood squirt and done. One reviewer lasted twenty five minutes.  I'm sorry I too like B movies, but twenty years ago B movies was in their prime.  Someone did a comparison with Sharknado series.  Which in comparison, Sharknado would be Big budget film.  You get want you pay for.  The creator might of put this on his credit card and this could of been his very first film.  Which if that is the case, good attempt, but please try again.",1441584000,2,806,4.527777777777778
7028726,3,B00U2YNO7U,"Good campy fun, but VERY low budget! I've made home movies of similar quality. but regardless, still a lot better than some movies out there lol",1441238400,,144,4.576923076923077

7028728,1,B00U2YNO7U,was a terrible movie I wasn't expecting Jurassic park graphics but the picture on the cover is better. Also commit to your style either do full claymation or full guy in suit don't half and half it because it makes the scenes even more disjointed since the suit looks nothing like the claymation.,1441152000,6,296,4.60377358490566
7028729,1,B00U2YNO7U,It wouldn't let me give it 0 stars. Absolutely horrible - there are no words to describe how bad this movie is.,1441065600,,111,4.090909090909091

8704347,5,B00U2YNO7U,"Well, this was, as all Polonia productions are, fantastic.  You don't go into a Polonia movie expecting state-of-the-art special effects, you do it to watch all these guys having fun and still cranking out movies old-school.  Todd Carpenter alone is worth the price of admission.  Bless 'em.  I hope they make a hundred more!",1507075200,,325,4.962962962962963

8704352,1,B00U2YNO7U,"This movie probably has the cheesiest dinosaur to ever grace the screen.  Mostly head shots and tail shots--with somebody in the head and wagging the tail, no doubt.  It just doesn't come off.  The dinosaur on the ""cover"" looks real--the one in the movie looks like a reject from a Barney audition.",1494979200,,298,4.6923076923076925
