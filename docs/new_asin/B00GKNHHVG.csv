8624157,4,B00GKNHHVG,"The two, 20 min workouts concentrate on firming the core. Both have plenty of planks with variations that challenge the obliques, and your upper body as you charge through each exercise at a quick pace. Each exercise is done for about a minute, and there's a modified version shown. Sometimes a more advanced version is offered. The music is upbeat, Cindy is positive and encouraging and the set is attractive. Unfortunately, Cindy and the U-Fit team, are wearing so much MAKEUP that they look like they're auditioning for one of those  ""Housewives of.."" shows! I don't get it. Although the cuing is good, there are a number of false-starts that could have been prevented by a rehearsal or two before recording.

Also, watch your lower back! If you're soft in the middle like me, you'll need to be sure that you keep those planks straight and don't ""bounce"" between moves. My back got sore so I alternate the 2 workouts and mix them with other DVD's that aren't as plank-centric. After doing the DVD for about a month, I can see solid results. Worth adding to your library.",1400630400,3,1073,4.702127659574468
8624158,5,B00GKNHHVG,"I started using Ultra Tight exactly one week ago today.  It includes 2 programs, but I've focused on the Abs.  I did this workout once every day for the week (except for the 2nd day which I skipped b/c I was super sore!)  Along with beginning this DVD, I began eating right--fruits, veggies, a balanced diet, small portions 6 times a day, and drinking water almost exclusively.  I've got results already and it's only been A WEEK!  I was only about 10 pounds overweight to begin with, but I've lost 2 pounds and toned muscle.  My stomach is noticeably flatter.  I even received a compliment yesterday: ""Wow! Your tummy is so nice and flat!""  Great motivation to keep doing what I'm doing!  Besides the results, I like Cindy's personality.  She's nice and actually does the workouts (I don't go for the trainers who yell at you and don't do the workouts themselves--ahem, Jillian Michaels).  The workouts are only 20 minutes--a time slot that can easily fit into anyone's day.",1389744000,3,975,4.710059171597633
8624159,4,B00GKNHHVG,"I know Cindy got a bad rep on some of her past dvds. I do enjoy her Incredible Ab series, as well as her appearances on exercise tv, so I asked for all 3 workouts in this series. I have only tried this one so far. Both routines are tough, thats for sure. Sometimes Ill do an ab routine on a ""rest"" day since its sometims not too much cardio, but this one is not ""rest-worthy"". It is a lot of up and down movements--- a lot in plank position. I do like the timer that lets you know when you are complete. I sometimes begged for it to ""whistle blow"" sooner, but the ticking means the end is near. I agree that you could complete a set instead of just stopping. In one instance she is pushing one of the women to go harder and faster, and then the whistle blows and she never had the chance. In any event, at least its consistent and they do that will every exercise.
Cindy is cheerful and bubbly like usual. Some may find this annoying. I just tune it out and do what needs to be done.
To sum it up, its definitely an advanced workout and if you are looking for a tough workout in a short amount of time, this is it.",1389312000,2,1114,4.0
8624160,3,B00GKNHHVG,"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level of exercise.

Pros:  Production quality overall is very good.  Film and sound quality, camera angles are good.  The moves change a lot so you do not get bored and are not difficult to follow along with.  The background exercisers are non-annoying.  I worked up a sweat and felt I got a decent workout.

Cons:  The first routine was a lot of up/down/up/down (stand up exercise, mountain climbers, stand up exercise, bicycle crunches. etc.) so depending on whether you like that, it will work for you.  I liked and disliked the minute buzzer.  I like having the obvious break point so I did not miss the quit mark, especially since you are face down half the time.  But sometimes you needed to finish a set instead of just quit so it became confusing.  For sets, it would have been better if they held off the buzzer until you reached the end of the set.  The second set was not so up/down but some of the moves were just not as enjoyable so I actually preferred the first set.  Unfortunately, the instructor was just a bit too much for me on this one.  I have other workouts by her that I was fine with but in this one she was just a little too peppy and seemed to be talking frenetically non-stop and there is no option for music only or something to cut out the chatter.  Others may find it cheerful and motivating, there is no pleasing everyone, after all.",1389225600,3,1410,4.44921875
