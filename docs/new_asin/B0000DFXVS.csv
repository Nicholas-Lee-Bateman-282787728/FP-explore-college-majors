8000931,4,B0000DFXVS,I love old movies but the movie where darker then they should have been .,1440374400,,73,3.933333333333333
8000932,3,B0000DFXVS,This is a nice selection but.. It is worth the money because the ones you don't like don't hurt so bad when you look at your wallet after you skipped the third movie you didn't care for. I would not recommend this as a gift. I feel it would be disappionting to the receiver but instead buy Columbo's first season that is awesome.,1192924800,,329,4.238095238095238
8000933,4,B0000DFXVS,"You can't go wrong with an older movie, these movies just seem to have higher standards.  They didn't rely completely upon special effects to hold the attention of those who have no attention span.",1170720000,2,197,4.794117647058823
8000934,5,B0000DFXVS,Just bought this as a time fill but was extremely impressed with the content. Good ol' black and white classic mystery flicks which even impressed me as a 19 year old movie going uni student! Get it!,1130112000,7,199,4.405405405405405
