3412053,5,B001875HG6,"Yes an Experience not necessarily stoned but beautiful...5 stars means 5 stars, the film cutaway for all back to mine says Jimi good for the director cinematically would be an extra in a DVD we're looking for uninterupted concert footage at the end Jimi's had a tough night at work but the flashes of sheer genius tops anybody for all time. So this is indirect[video] transfer I didn't want to wait any longer for this.",1383955200,,419,4.6
3412054,4,B001875HG6,"This item is a must for any Hendrix fan. The Experience had already disbanded a few months earlier, and was reunited for this concert. Hendrix is in fine form here, and so is Mitchel, tough Redding on bass just seems close to nausea, the music provided by the trio is great. Chris Wood from Traffic shows up with a frantic flute solo on ""Room full of mirrors"", which is probably his greatest moment ever filmed. Image quality: not excellent, but good enough.",1382140800,,458,4.597560975609756
3412055,5,B001875HG6,"Jimi Hendrix LIve At The Royal Albert Hall 1969
This CD is a must for any hard core Hendrix fan the picture quality isn't all that good. But the sound quality is excellent!!
I would first collect the official releases before buying this one.",1377388800,4,241,4.5
3412056,4,B001875HG6,"As a fan of Jimi's since '68 I've been aware of this concert for decades. Through the years there have been a few audio recordings from this legendary concert, and I've longed to hear the complete concert. So I was quite pleased to see this DVD available -and it is wonderful. My only complaint is that it is not the complete concert. I'd have paid extra if that would have been the case.

Still, I recommend any fan of Hendrix to get this DVD. It's a gem.",1376092800,5,456,4.241379310344827
3412057,5,B001875HG6,"This is Jimi in his classic behavior - JAMMIN'. Since we are denied access to the master reels by some greedy group of buzzards who are in the vein of MICHAEL JEFFREY, this is the best we got & i tell you what... this video DELIVERS! The bonus material w/ photo log & music is a must see. Excellent free gift! Like all things Jimi, IMAGINATION is the key to unlocking the experience of a lifetime & this concert is one of THE CONCERTS that closed an era just like Woodstock in August later that year. Only this one has SMASHING OF THE AMPS in all its glory & the frenzied crowd to boot. I highly recommend this one. Until the official concert footage is released this is your ticket to the EXPERIENCE!",1368057600,9,701,4.2781954887218046

3412060,4,B001875HG6,"I've seen Jimi in person the 3 times he performed live in Berlin ('67,'69 and '70). The biggest jaw dropper was the first one on May 15, 1967 in a hall for a few hundred people where I sat on a chair with table(!) directly in front of the stage. The show only lastet about 45 minutes but was absolutely overwhelming anyway because it was so fresh, spontaneous and innovative. By 1969 the initial coherence and joy of playing together had dwindled to a noticable degree in the Experience. I guess it was in part due to personal problems between Jimi and Noel (whose musical tastes were never fully in harmony with Jimi's but more limited to typical 60's Brit Pop). The main problem however was the way the management handled the Experience and forced them to constant touring while Jimi wanted to devote more time to creating new music in the studio and by getting new inspiration through jamming with other musicians from different backgrounds, including jazz. So his frustration grew and the drug use along with it. That frustration was evident in many live performances from early 1969 onwards.
However this performance at the Royal Albert Hall was clearly one of the better - maybe one of the best shows - of 1969. Jimi's playing had developed a lot since the start of the Experience and his singing too was very strong and confident in this show. This show was highlighted by an unusual quantity of high class blues performances, including a stellar version of ""Bleeding Heart"" never filmed anywhere else, great versions of ""Red House"" and ""Hear My Train A'Comin'"", a fine lyrical ""Little Wing"", great psychedelic rock songs, especially ""I Don't Live Today"" and ""Voodoo Child S.R."" and a successful jam with parts of Traffic (especially Chris Wood on flute) on ""Room Full Of Mirrors"", also not filmed anywhere else. So this is a successful and important Hendrix show. The picture quality of the film itself is low, however, because this is not an official release but one composed from the video collections of various fans. On the other hand the sound quality is great. Let's hope the petty legal quarrels that have up to now blocked the official release for over 40 (!) years will someday be overcome and this great concert film of Jimi Hendrix be released in the quality it deserves. If you learn about such a release, please let me know (mailto:hansbe@web.de).",1267056000,21,2368,4.778048780487805
3412061,2,B001875HG6,The techincal quality of this DVD is fine (filmed in the 60's) and the sound is good on my surround sound system. This review is more about the artist's performance. I am a big Hendrix fan over 30 years and am just building a library of Hendrix music that I did not know existed until I used the internet - more. The Hendrix performance on this DVD is much hyped but he is just jammin' and not full of energy as his reputation suggests. This recording is covered in several written biographies and after watching it I realize why it was dead panned. Apparently he was so excited leading up to this gig that he actually practiced in preparaton - however before going on stage he got so wasted he didn't have much energy to perform. The following weekend he did 2 more shows and silenced the critics of the one that was filmed. Definitely for a serious collector.,1265587200,8,861,4.421383647798742

8268688,2,B001875HG6,"What I ordered (as pictured in the sale advertisement) was an original ""rare"" DVD of Jimi Hendrix live at Royal Albert Hall. What I received was a DVD copy of the show and a CD-ROM of the show as well as a ""bonus"" DVD of Jimi at Newport. I believe this is a copyright violation and needs to be investigated. Maybe in this day of bootleg audio and video (I have plenty of both) I shouldn't be so judgmental but it makes me mad that it was purchased under false pretenses and sad that it was purchased on the eve of the anniversary of such an amazing guitarist's death.",1506902400,2,567,4.2110091743119265

8268696,1,B001875HG6,"There has been numerous home made DVDs of this footage....the 'Room Full of Hendrix' is the worst of the lot...
the VHS conversion to digital must have been done by amateurs and the VHS 'source' is the worst I've seen out of the 5 versions there are. Just look on the internet and burn your own DVD, don't be paying these people for this crap.
the simulated 5.1 is not a selling point either.
PS: there has been a new 2014 source found and is far superior to even the last 5 versions.",1395187200,9,484,4.21505376344086
