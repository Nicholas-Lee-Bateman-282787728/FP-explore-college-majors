8454519,4,B0052W9V4C,"These episodes are very good, but I do already have them on dvd. I would buy it if I didn't have scooby doo where are you seasons 1 & 2 and whats new scooby doo season 1.",1353974400,,170,3.6216216216216215
8454520,1,B0052W9V4C,"If you have bought ""Scooby-Doo! Where Are You? The Complete 1st and 2nd Season"" and all 3 seasons of ""What's New Scooby-Doo?"" don't be a sucker and buy this cause they got a new cover. This is WB way of trying to get more money off people cause they hope no one will think about looking at the back or paying too close attention to what's on the back. The episodes on this come from one of the 2 series I mentioned. There is a total of 3. ""Big Scare in the Big Easy"" and ""Lights! Camera! Mayhem!"" come from ""What's New Scooby-Doo?"" and ""Jeepers, It's the Creeper"" is from the second season of ""Scooby-Doo! Where Are You?"". So if you got any of the seasons don't buy this and if you don't buy them instead of wasting your money for 3 episodes, especially if you're a Scooby fan. Happy shopping.",1314489600,31,793,4.258278145695364
