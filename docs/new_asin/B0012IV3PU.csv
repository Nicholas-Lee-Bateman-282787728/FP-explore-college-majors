3089446,5,B0012IV3PU,"I saw this on the History Channel, and then bought it for use in my high school science classroom.  It has great animations of famous sites altered to show age and their ""fall.""  I think my teenage students will find it both entertaining, educational, and thought provoking.",1208476800,2,274,4.808510638297872
3089447,5,B0012IV3PU,"Wow, really gives one something to think about. Only styrofoam and plastic will be around in 10,000 years...oh my goodness! Something everyone MUST watch!",1207958400,3,154,5.458333333333333
3089448,5,B0012IV3PU,"I really enjoyed this objective, well-researched and thoroughly explained account of what would happen to the earth if mankind were to disappear. To me, it's not important how this happens, as that would be another film (or several) entirely. This one is about what the results would be on earth if this happened. It does not delve into the causes, but rather the effects, which I thought was enough for any 2-hour program. I was impressed by how well the visuals complimented the dialogue. I didn't feel sad about the loss of mankind's knowledge or achievements- who would they be passed on to, and would they be able to be understood, and would this knowledge only contribute to a faster demise of a future civilization? No, it's up to future beings to develop in their own way. It's good for us to occasionally be reminded how insignificant and expendable we all are. A little humility is not a bad thing!",1207612800,35,908,4.68125
3089449,4,B0012IV3PU,"Right up front this documentary states that they won't address how people disappear/die off--but that would seem to have a profound effect on what happens afterwards.  There is no discussion of the six and a half billion, or so, bodies that would be left behind after a massive die off--unless there was a large-scale alien abduction or some gradual dying off that allowed for most of the bodies to be disposed of, there would a lot of bodies left exposed and available as food to all sorts of species.  Also the cause of our extinction could have a major effect on the aftermath:  a major climate change, ecological disaster, or nuclear disaster large enough to wipe out all of mankind would likely take out a few more species and have major effects on what occurs afterwards.  This show describes a fascinating story of how most of our man-made structures would gradually disappear--which, depending on how humankind disappears, might be moot--most of them might be destroyed when mankind is destroyed.",1206144000,12,1004,4.923076923076923
3089450,5,B0012IV3PU,"This show, along with the National Geographic Channel's Aftermath: Population Zero, both bring across the interesting concept of what life on Earth would be like after Humans disappear from the face of the earth, though in the case of both these shows there is no explanation of how we disappeared and only that it was basically overnight. In any case, this and its consort both propose an idea which I myself find intriguing in the one of the most terrifying ways. A must see as well as something I simply could not take my eyes away from while watching it.
This one by the History Channel shows more over a broader range of years since our disappearance, and for a few of the earlier ones compares them to current examples that exist (i.e. 20 years to the land around Chernobyl).
All else I can say is that this is a MUST SEE!",1205625600,73,828,4.453947368421052
3089451,5,B0012IV3PU,"I watched this video on the History Channel.  It presents a realistic view of what earth will look like and become after man has managed to destroy himself. Makes you realize just how much we have manipulated earth to suit our needs. Sad to think that everything we've done will be lost and have to be discovered all over again, if human life re-emerges,
at some point in time. The movie doesn't give much hope of preserving
anything between the cock roaches and micro-organisms feeding on and changing the composition of all man made materials.  This video will
definitely cause you to think about what really matters.",1205107200,22,619,4.775700934579439
3089452,4,B0012IV3PU,"This is a fascinating video and well worth watching, but I don't know what depresses me more about ""Life After People"" -- to think that all of mankind's achievements and knowledge may one day be lost forever or the almost gleeful way the people involved in the story imply that it's all right if we disappear because at least the cockroaches will survive, and hey, we didn't deserve to be here anyway.  Also missing were any suggestions for averting a complete loss of our knowledge, such as improved recording media, possible changes in the way we build things, etc.  Sorry, human race, but so long, goodbye and good riddance!",1205107200,5,627,4.743119266055046
3089453,5,B0012IV3PU,"This is such a good documentary. It shows how the radiation leak from Chernobyl has started to grow back. It is very interesting to see how much we affect the world, and how in some aspect we help instead of harm it.",1486339200,3,216,4.166666666666667
3089454,4,B0012IV3PU,Not entirely what I expected.  Logic tells you that plant life will take over.  I was hoping to see what happens with plant life when the environment changes with or without people.,1486252800,,181,4.625

3089458,3,B0012IV3PU,"Disc  2  is  interesting.  Disturbing  but  interesting.  I  got  this  show  by  mistake  (after  people)  I  was  looking  for  (Life  after  people)  &  got  this  show  by  accident,  But  its  nice  to  own  it.  People  struggle  to  live  &  avoid  death.  Sudden  changes  in  power  loss,  first  off  no  internet,  refrigerators  that  stop  working,  water  stops  working  so  you  can't  do  the  dishes  or  take  a  shower.  &  electricity  failure,  force  people  to  resort  to  violence  &  gangs  with  guns,  A  small  family  must  abandon  their  city  to  try  &  stay  alive  &  look  for  food  &  water  as  the  source  of  it  becomes  more  scarce.  &  its  not  easy  trying  to  avoid  all  the  negative  people  around  them  pointing  the  guns  &  those  who'll  try  to  rob  you.
Its  about  a  world  experiencing  a  sudden  change  which  will  make  people  go  back  to  when  times  were  tougher  in  order  to  survive.  The  wife  in  this  show  thinks  this  is  only  a  temporary  thing.  &  things  will  go  back  to  normal  again.  But  the  change  is  for  good.  It  does  though  give  us  viewers  perfect  tips  on  what  to  do  if  this  ever  happened  in  reality.  Its  not  the  sort  of  thing  I'd  ever  want  to  go  through.  One  never  knows  exactly  what  the  future  will  bring.  I  realize  everybody  would  like  to  avoid  this  sort  of  thing  &  keep  all  electricity  power  stations  running  good.  I  think  people  ought  to  pay  attention  to  this  so  that  our  nation  does  not  push  itself  to  a  failure  point  to  where  this  becomes  our  society.  If  its  ever  predicted  then  we  better  be  prepared!  To  me  its  only  someone's  theory  about  how  things  would  turn  out  if  Power  plants  did  fail.  It  does  not  mean  it'll  become  society.  I  would  surely  assume  that  electricians  would  work  their  hardest  &  do  what  they  can.  &  our  president  &  all  the  government  agents  in  our  country  would  be  displeased  if  this  sort  of  thing  really  did  resort  to  violence  &  turning  on  each  other.  Let  me  just  say  that  I  think  (America  is  a  better  country  than  this)  helping  each  other  out  rather  than  defying  one  another  as  it  tells  in  this  story,  (After Armageddon).
It  makes  you  wonder  how  you'd  handle  things  exactly,  would  you  stay  &  fight  off  the  gangs,  shoot  your  way  in  &  out  of  towns  like  some  people  would  or  would  you  go  in  the  other  direction  to  maintain  a  positive  manner  in  a  tragic  sudden  change  in  society.  I  witnessed  humans  &  animals  dying  if  help  could  not  be  provided.  &  I  don't  think  anybody  would  want  to  accept  the  truth.  Because  of  the  shock.  Finding  proper  solutions  would  always  be  necessary.
This  copy  is  from  the (History  channel.  They  don't  however  have  all  the  solutions  if  this  ever  happens,  just  some  of  them,  &  being  as  it  is  the  world  is  growing  constantly,  &  us  not  seeing  our  foolishness  until  its  too  late,  this  event  is  possible.  I  can  understand  if  some  viewers  if  or  are  disturbed  by  disc  2  entitled  (After  Armageddon).  But  it  is  truly  an  inside  look  from  History  channel  of  an  unstoppable  fate  twisting  peoples  way  of  thinking  who  play  the  characters  in  the  film.  The  man  his  wife  &  young  son,  had  to  use  good  judgement.  It  is  a  time  &  place  where  you  must  get  what  you  can  from  the  convenient  stores  while  you  can,  &  get  well  stocked  if  you  do  not  like  the  idea  of  scavenging,  peoples  patience  will  also  be  tested  as  well.  Having  to  go  into  an  empty  mobile  home  to  find  food  &  water  like  they  did  where  a  dead  person  is  is  disgusting.  One  thing  they  did  was  good,  helping  a  person  in  need,  a  person  who  was  still  alive  on  the  side  of  the  road,  &  was  all  bloody,  &  must  have  gotten  wounded  by  the  gangs  or  a  suspicious  acting  person,  they  were  nice  enough  to  give  him  some  shots  of  medicine  to  help  save  his  life.  That  makes  a  huge  difference  to  me,  giving  someone  help,  which  before  hand  nobody  was  generous  enough  to  give  them.  It  is  hard  to  imagine  innocent  people,  (the  husband wife  &  son)  being  threatened  in  a  harsh  way,  or  being  rejected,  by  people  here  in  there,  in  a  world  that  has  almost  turned  cruel.  &  yes  it  would  take  an  awful  long  time  before  everyone's  thoughts  weren't  the  most  negative.  The  guy  asking  (Have  you  seen  Mike?  &  I'm  sitting  here  watching  the  show  wondering,  Who  the  hell  is  Mike?  Is  he  this  mans  son  or  something??  Then  he  just  turns  into  a  violent  nutcase!)  I'd  have  shot  that  guy  right  there!  You  would  find  crazy  people  for  quite  sometime,  before  things  started  to  calm  down,  &  people  adapted  &  accepted  what  society  has  become.  Law  &  order  I  believe  would  come  back  somehow  eventually.
History  channel  at  least  this  episode  in  the  Series  (after  People)  does  open  up  your  eyes  when  you  watch  it,  even  makes  you  stop  &  think  a  little  bit.
Scary, Disturbing, gross,  I  admit  it.  The  only  question  I  have  is,  (Will  we  have  a  solution  if  this  event  ever  takes  place  in  society  &  reality?)  &  get  our  world  up  &  running  again?  Surely  with  of  all the  knowledge  we've  gotten  since  we  humans  have  been  here,  all  the  inventions  we've  designed,  we  may  have  a  fighting  chance!  I'm  no  expert  or  nothing.  The  people  talking  as  I  watched  this  episode  entitled  (After Armageddon)  sure  knew  how  to  explain  things  to  us.  Wish they  could  have  mentioned  a  little  more  to  us.  I  didn't  like  disc  3.  Disc  1  tells  very  much  the  same  stuff  as  the  other  show  would  (Life  after  people).
I've  watched  History  channel  for  a  long  time.  This  is  one  of  the  best  shows  ever  viewed,  (After People)  &  the  other  show  entitled  (Life  after  People)  which  I  now  own  on  DVD.  Never  seen  anything  quite  like  it.",1480032000,2,6345,4.349301397205589

3089475,5,B0012IV3PU,"A great deal for less than $7 when a single one of these shows costs at least that much. While I love History Channel shows, the $25 price to own a single show is too high. I would probably own the entire library of History & Discovery Channel Shows if they sold them for $5-$10. Until then compilations like this are very nice to own at a great price.

3089516,5,B0012IV3PU,"If you're a fan of Shattered Ravings (my blog), then I'm sure you've seen me mention the zombie apocalypse every now and then.  I do this in half-humor and good fun...however, a part of me thinks something like that might be a possibility one day.  If a catastrophe does happen, how would humanity react?  And how long would it take until we die off?  Continuing with that thought, what would the world be like after we're gone?  The fine folks at The History Channel and Lionsgate offer us up a chilling and vivid glimpse of what the future without humankind might be like.

I've been a big fan of LIFE AFTER PEOPLE for a long time.  It's fascinating to me to see what Earth might be like after we are gone.  There are so many aspects to such a phenomenon, were it to happen, that it is staggering when you consider them.  So seeing LIFE AFTER PEOPLE in this three-disc collection was a huge treat for me.

But the others in this anthology are just as poignant.  MEGA DROUGHT shows us how the world could spiral out of control if global warming brought on massive water shortages.  Many of us in the U.S. take clean water for granted...but seeing what could happen if it were no longer in abundance is a terrifying concept.

MEGA FREEZE gives us a glimpse into how our world could quickly deteriorate if abrupt climate changes forced the planet into Ice Age-like freezing conditions.  Putting up with the occasional snow storm in the U.S. is one thing...but conditions like those portrayed in this piece go way beyond extreme.  The result is a horrifying scenario that will make your blood run cold.

But what happens if we as a species don't die off quickly?  AFTER ARMAGEDDON takes an interesting look into what might result after a catastrophic event.

This collection is an intense and well-made glimpse into how our future might just play out, and what the world will be like without us.  There is no preaching or underlying message in AFTER PEOPLE, just speculation and, where possible, fact.  This documentary is fun and entertaining, and I highly recommend giving it a look.  Be prepared to lose a few hours, though...this engrossing collection will suck you in and keep you riveted until the end.",1370995200,8,2206,4.648578811369509
3089517,3,B0012IV3PU,"It looks like the History Channel got some new software they wanted to try out. Most of what they have to put out is remedial: metal rusts, plants grow in odd places, and cockroaches adapt. Some of what it has is dumb speculation designed to generate interest and ratings such was gliding cats. I didn't find it well researched. It gave you the impression that if people suddenly were rapture, nuclear power plants would quietly shut themselves down without incident. What happens to all that hot spent fuel in the crowded pools once those cooling water pumps are turned off? We know the answer to that.

The film speculates that all the metal and concrete cities would be destroyed by fire without firemen, but then show how they would crumble due to rust and then grow up to be highrises for cats. Clearly they were pulling stuff out of their butts, saying whatever sounded good at the time. The filming at Chernobyl was boring and lasted way too long and they didn't have a clue as what to do about zoo animals.

This looked more like a seventh grade science report then something serious. It is a fluff piece for the enjoyment of the mindless masses.

3089520,5,B0012IV3PU,"This isn't a movie I'd want to have, but it was GREAT to watch once. It's a look at what would become of the world if we were to up and disappear one day.

It's divided into sections: one day after people, one week after, one month after, one year, ten years, 25 years, 100 years, 1000 years, and out to 50,000 years IIRC. So it starts with our pets having to find a way out of the house, then vermin going through the food on pantry and store shelves, to what happens to houses after decades of neglect. Eventually you see some of humanity's most durable structures collapse: the Eiffel Tower, the Space Needle, and other things come down--though they're replayed a few too many times.

Of course you have to suspend disbelief a little and assume that all of humanity has disappeared one day for no apparent reason. But I don't think that's a problem for this film, since it's not suggesting that's a realistic scenario, just a ""Hey, what if..."" kind of idea. The movie is remarkable for consulting heavily with scientists and engineers to get the details right.

So it's ironic that my one real criticism is that it gets the collapse of the Golden Gate Bridge WRONG. After thousands of years, the cables holding up the bridge weaken and snap, and then the support towers sag toward the middle. That's backward--as with any suspension bridge, the cables are anchored at either end, pulling outward with tons of force. If the cables were to snap, the support towers would be yanked *away* from the center. (See astronomer Phil Plait's review of The Core at badastronomy.com for details.) It's puzzling that they did the Golden Gate wrong, considering the effort they put into getting engineering details right in this film. But other movies have done the same, probably because it seems intuitive. I wouldn't say it spoiled the movie, but it did make me wonder what other technical blunders they may have made.",1351814400,,1910,4.678571428571429

3089535,4,B0012IV3PU,"Although the concept behind History's Life After People - what would/will happen to earth if/when the human race cease's to inhabit it - may not be new, the presentation, production value, special effects, and impact of this brilliantly produced documentary put it in a league of its own. ""Greenies,"" young people, and even those who aren't normally fans of documentaries or ""nature shows"" will thoroughly enjoy this documentary.

Life After People theorizes about the fate of the earth when humans no longer ""control"" it; how it would (re)turn to a more natural state ""if"" we went extinct. Which ecosystems would take over? What animals, plants and insects would survive? What remnants of the industrialized world would remain, and for how long? Based on both evidence of the demise of past civilizations and computer simulated models, this documentary explores the hypothetical (although sadly, all too likely) process our planet may embark on should/when we're no longer here.

Visually stunning and insightful, this special is especially thought provoking for young viewers, who also happen to hold the fate of the world in their hands. Taking on subjects as ""small"" as household pets, as complex as New York skyscrapers, and as large - philosophically and scientifically speaking - as the possibility of evolution happening all over again, Life After People is an outstanding, informative, and extremely entertaining documentary. Thanks to the engaging subject matter and excellent production, it's sure to live on as one of the History Channel's best presentations.

3089536,5,B0012IV3PU,"The basic premise of Life After People is that humans are suddenly gone and it doesn't matter how such a disappearance happens.  The movie explores the question of how long would it take the physical remains of human presence to completely disappear and/or be transformed.

The movie particularly resonated with me because I have often wondered the same thing.  I have even done sketches of, say, the Statue of Liberty toppled over and half-covered with sand, or Big Ben in London halfway submerged, or the Golden Gate Bridge collapsed.  I supposed that this line of thought was inspired by my observations, over the years, of the ruins of ancient civilizations, coupled with the realization that nothing lasts forever, leading to speculation as to what might the ruins of our current civilization look like.

By the way, the series is even better because it has the time to go into more detail.  Life After People is, above all, an excellent presentation of entropy in action.",1252454400,,977,4.926829268292683

3089538,3,B0012IV3PU,"Imagining our planet after people no longer exist is fascinating and I'm happy to see this and other books and DVDs dealing with it. I've purchased an assortment of both; Life After People was the first DVD I watched and I've not yet read any of the books.

I'm glad that the creators chose to just do away with people rather than spend a lot of time speculating on how we met our demise or even where our bodies disappeared to. (Maybe I still haven't gotten over the rotting bodies in ""The Stand"".) That wasn't the story I was interested in hearing when I purchased Life After People.

Life After People starts out promisingly enough and certainly manages to engage viewers emotionally by playing on our concern over the fate of house pets. And, for the most part, I found the entire show interesting. I particularly liked the visit to the abandoned town near Chernobyl.

Ultimately, though, I felt too much time was spent talking about corrosion and how human made structures would deteriorate and collapse. It seemed to get repetitive. I would have liked to have seen a lot more focus on plant, animal and insect life and how particular species might - or might not - adjust in their altered habitat. I also would have liked more focus on what part climate changes brought about by the absence of humans would play in flora and fauna behavioral changes, survival and evolution.

Still, I found this a good introduction to the subject and I particularly think it would appeal to younger viewers, spurring their curiosity. I hope I'll find more information on plants and animals, etc. - and a little less on corrosion - in some of the other materials I purchased.",1251072000,4,1664,4.6689419795221845

A.D.D. culture. Video game culture. This series is pretty good, but it should stay with one city or area at a time. But instead each episode jumps from city to city, back and forth, while skipping ahead into the future one year, 5 years, 50, 100, 200 etc., etc. Some of what they explain doesn't need explaining and but there are enough surprises to keep you interested unless your a structural enginer or specialist of some sort.

Audio is average, nothing spectacular, but then it's a documentary. Disc plays fine in my Samsung BDP-1500. Special features are interesting. Will probably buy more History Channel features on Blu-Ray as they become available.

As far as the feature and subject matter - absolutely, utterly amazing.

Personal anecdote. When I was around 12 years old, I lived in a neighborhood located next to a large cotton field. One summer a road building crew came out and constructed a  mile stretch of concrete road way off in the farthest reaches of the cotton field, for no apparent reason (it was advance work for a delayed urban expansion which did not to take place for another 15 years).

That stretch of brand new road, sitting out in the middle of the cotton field, decaying, grass and weeds growing up between the cracks, frogs, rabbits and other critters making it their home, just fascinated me. Sometimes, I would ride out to it on my bike and just sit, listen to the silence and the sounds of Nature as it slowly consumed the concrete, took back what It owned. Walking along the stretch of road, I would imagine I was the last person on Earth. That was the summer I read ""Earth Abides"" by George R. Stewart, a book that left a huge impression on me.

I've been a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction ever since.

UPDATE: Problem. On loading, the disc hang my Blu-Ray player about 50% of the time.

As soon as it was over I watched it again right after.
It's a somewhat disturbing take on what would happen if people just vanished.
I was very surprised that every trace of humanity would be more or less gone in about a thousand years.
I was even more surprised at what would happen within a few weeks.
The power going out and all that.
Scary indeed.
They never go into detail as to how the humans disappear but it really doesn't matter.
The awesome force of nature would pretty much eliminate everything we have done for thousands of years.
It's a film that really makes you think and is a definite eye opener.
It pointed out a lot of things I, along with the majority of people just don't give a whole lot of thought to.
The power going out.
The flooding of the subway systems.
London and Amsterday flooding into ruin.
I guess I never really realized how much effort man has put into reshaping the world around us and without us, how quickly everything would collapse.

3089543,5,B0012IV3PU,"WARNING: I have watched the first two 1 hour episodes of Life After People which begun airing on the History Channel April 2009.  The season is slated for a total of 10 hour long (including commercials) episodes, but this DVD is only 90 minutes.  So I'm guessing you only get 2 episodes, which is a shame, as I would gladly buy the entire season based on my experience so far.  However, knowing that, on to the review:

The premise is that some disease wipes humans completely off the planet, and the film begins 1 day after humans are gone.  This leaves you on your own to ponder how this extermination could happen, and how likely it is.  There was a fascinating book I heard about through the Daily Show/Colbert on this topic, but the cool thing about this History Channel special is that you get to visually experience what no human being would be able to see--dams crushing after the force of billions of gallons of water overwhelmed them, buildings collapsing after their steel rusted, animals escaping and running free, etc.  Several experts were interviewed and they filmed on location in several interesting spots such as a deserted island in Japan that was once the most populous spot in the world, where you can see how the saltwater has attacked the large buildings and plants attacked roadways.  It makes one think how quickly evidence of man would be removed.  I hope the entire boxed set is released at a future date!

Weisman shows us as part of nature, affecting its cycles and processes and affected by them; the film revives obsolete tropes of a struggle for mastery between man and nature. The combat-mastery approach isn't just misleading, it's dangerous - for, as Weisman's book (along with many others) shows, it is our inability to recognize that we are part of nature that makes us such a scourge. The film imagines all traces of human civilization (except perhaps Mount Rushmore) effaced, but Weisman reminds us that we will be survived by our plastics, our stainless steel, etc. ""The world without us"" points the way to a thoughtful ecological consciousness, ""Life after people"" points away from it, making the collapse of human civilization and the longterm scarring of nature more likely.

How or why this would happen is not covered: the subject of this DVD is the succession of events following such a disappearance, as things arranged and constructed by humans fail over time (out to 100,000 years after said disappearance).

Pros:
- The show is very dramatic and maintains interest.
- Graphical effects demonstrate likely outcomes, including spectacular sequences of large-scale collapses.
- Experts showcased on the show seem authoritative and provide relevant insight.

Cons (these are all minor, in my opinion):
- At times, this program seems a little too dramatic.  The narration sometimes comes from the perspective that nature is hostile, and surprise is expressed at the notion that ""the planet and life on it would go on without us"".
- One of the featured experts was a little too philosophical.  Though I liked hearing most of what he had to say, he was given too much air time.
- Given the extremely low cost of computer-generated special effects today, visual quality should have been better.

This is not a ""con"", but my guess is that the depicted timeline is somewhat accelerated.

In short, this production poses a very interesting hypothetical question, explores the likely answer with experts and presents the whole package very well.
Flaws are relatively small.

If one is interested in this subject, note that a similar program has been developed, ""National Geographic: Aftermath - Population Zero"" (2008).",1220486400,5,1536,5.140562248995984
3089554,4,B0012IV3PU,"I enjoyed this video very much.  It helps put in perspective how insignificant humankind's contributions to the global ecosystem really are.  It appears that even with all of our ""detrimental"" impact on the world's atmosphere, the planet will find a way to continue on without us.  It gives creedence to both Psalm 78:69 and to George Carlin (who says the planet is just fine).  People will go away and within five years nature will be taking over what we created.

I also couldn't help but think of the contribution of my own profession, building operational maintenance.  Senior management always wants to defer maintenance.  Well here is a classic case of what can happen if maintenance is pushed back too far.  Things fall apart, duh.

Anyway, this was an entertaining video with some good graphics and some interesting hypotheses.  If feral cats want to occupy former high rises, then learn how to glide (flying cats ala flying squirrels) that seems plausible.  Since we have a real life abandoned city in the Ukraine to show how nature can reclaim cities, some of what was shown is not merely specualtion and guessing.",1219276800,3,1124,4.894179894179894

Through computer graphics and real events the viewer is left with little doubt that as soon as the human race departs, the natural world begins to take over.  In a millenium, the great bridges, buildings and other edifices of man will all be gone save perhaps the pyramids, Mount Rushmore and Hoover Dam.

Overall, a well done and unsettling documentary. Except of course, if you are one of the scientists who was interviewed in the documentary.

It's gorgeous and profound. Although I do agree that there are some things that need to be addressed and so on, and it would be interesting to know the scenarios in which people would die off (but that's really not the point of it, the point is what happens to the Earth, not to us. I think that should be saved for a different documentary).

My kids felt bad about the fate of the pets, animals, and especially the dogs. They didn't believe Earth could ever be depopulated; they said there will always be people on Earth because we reproduce like crazy.
I felt the video needed to start with some reason for the total absence of human life. It would have been interesting to see what would have happened to the bodies. The animals feasting on human bodies would be gruesome, but kids like gore. Under what conidtions would only humanity die off? It is the kind of story you can start anywhere. Regardless, I'm glad I bought the video.",1211673600,5,716,4.6015625
3089560,5,B0012IV3PU,"I was mesmerized by this speculative look at how all of the works of our hands will begin to vanish -- if humans suddenly are removed from the Earth.

Watch this documentary, read Psalm 90 or Ecclesiastes -- or sections of Jesus' teachings, if you're Christian -- or sections of the Quran or the Vedas about the impermanence of life. There's also a fascinating connection here with Buddhist visions of the world around us. In other words, in addition to the science lessons and suspenseful, sci-fi tone of this documentary -- there's also a haunting and most likely a very healthy moment of spiritual reflection in viewing this film.

Try it with a small discussion group, in fact. There'll be no shortage of discussion after watching this film.

The documentary is produced in a fast-cut, MTV style, but that's the popular look and feel of the hit series on Discovery and other nonfiction cable channels these days.

The idea is quite simple: An array of scientists and engineers lay out how our homes, offices, roads and everything else we've made and built would begin crumbling the moment we leave the scene. It's fascinating to discover how fragile some of these systems really are!",1210550400,3,1187,4.832512315270936
3089561,4,B0012IV3PU,"This was a fascinating look ahead into a world without folks (us) to mess it up anymore.  There were no moralistic lessons to be learned or cautionary advice as in ""An Inconvenient Truth"" or ""11th Hour"".  The only point is that when people leave the earth and have all returned to their basic chemical elements, the earth itself will start it's transformation to slough off its skin of human construct.  A lot of thought went into the chronological layering of how and when this will be accomplished.  I'd never given much thought to when steel (if not protected by paint) would morph back to iron.  I'd never considered what would happen to the family pet if Purina weren't around.  I felt worse about the demise of books - the insight into the soul of man, the diary of our existence - disintegrating to no more than powder.

My only criticism is that the story lasted a little too long and often repeated itself. Overall, though, it's well worth watching.....bg",1210377600,5,964,4.668639053254438
3089562,5,B0012IV3PU,"This is an imaginative documentary on what might happen to all we have created if people simply disappeared.  This is a not an environmentalist video - it doesn't advocate people dying off nor does it explain why we vanish - it is more from the engineering/biological standpoint: what would happen to world famous landmarks if they were abandoned, how would domestic animal adapt (or not), what would happen to animal pests we fight off now? For the armchair engineer/biologist, it is imaginative and fascinating.

3323945,5,B0012IV3PU,"I really enjoyed this objective, well-researched and thoroughly explained account of what would happen to the earth if mankind were to disappear. To me, it's not important how this happens, as that would be another film (or several) entirely. This one is about what the results would be on earth if this happened. It does not delve into the causes, but rather the effects, which I thought was enough for any 2-hour program. I was impressed by how well the visuals complimented the dialogue. I didn't feel sad about the loss of mankind's knowledge or achievements- who would they be passed on to, and would they be able to be understood, and would this knowledge only contribute to a faster demise of a future civilization? No, it's up to future beings to develop in their own way. It's good for us to occasionally be reminded how insignificant and expendable we all are. A little humility is not a bad thing!",1207612800,35,908,4.68125
3323946,4,B0012IV3PU,"Right up front this documentary states that they won't address how people disappear/die off--but that would seem to have a profound effect on what happens afterwards.  There is no discussion of the six and a half billion, or so, bodies that would be left behind after a massive die off--unless there was a large-scale alien abduction or some gradual dying off that allowed for most of the bodies to be disposed of, there would a lot of bodies left exposed and available as food to all sorts of species.  Also the cause of our extinction could have a major effect on the aftermath:  a major climate change, ecological disaster, or nuclear disaster large enough to wipe out all of mankind would likely take out a few more species and have major effects on what occurs afterwards.  This show describes a fascinating story of how most of our man-made structures would gradually disappear--which, depending on how humankind disappears, might be moot--most of them might be destroyed when mankind is destroyed.",1206144000,12,1004,4.923076923076923

In any case, this and its consort both propose an idea which I myself find intriguing in the one of the most terrifying ways. A must see as well as something I simply could not take my eyes away from while watching it.
This one by the History Channel shows more over a broader range of years since our disappearance, and for a few of the earlier ones compares them to current examples that exist (i.e. 20 years to the land around Chernobyl).

3323955,3,B0012IV3PU,"Disc  2  is  interesting.  Disturbing  but  interesting.  I  got  this  show  by  mistake  (after  people)  I  was  looking  for  (Life  after  people)  &  got  this  show  by  accident,  But  its  nice  to  own  it.  People  struggle  to  live  &  avoid  death.  Sudden  changes  in  power  loss,  first  off  no  internet,  refrigerators  that  stop  working,  water  stops  working  so  you  can't  do  the  dishes  or  take  a  shower.  &  electricity  failure,  force  people  to  resort  to  violence  &  gangs  with  guns,  A  small  family  must  abandon  their  city  to  try  &  stay  alive  &  look  for  food  &  water  as  the  source  of  it  becomes  more  scarce.  &  its  not  easy  trying  to  avoid  all  the  negative  people  around  them  pointing  the  guns  &  those  who'll  try  to  rob  you.
Its  about  a  world  experiencing  a  sudden  change  which  will  make  people  go  back  to  when  times  were  tougher  in  order  to  survive.  The  wife  in  this  show  thinks  this  is  only  a  temporary  thing.  &  things  will  go  back  to  normal  again.  But  the  change  is  for  good.  It  does  though  give  us  viewers  perfect  tips  on  what  to  do  if  this  ever  happened  in  reality.  Its  not  the  sort  of  thing  I'd  ever  want  to  go  through.  One  never  knows  exactly  what  the  future  will  bring.  I  realize  everybody  would  like  to  avoid  this  sort  of  thing  &  keep  all  electricity  power  stations  running  good.  I  think  people  ought  to  pay  attention  to  this  so  that  our  nation  does  not  push  itself  to  a  failure  point  to  where  this  becomes  our  society.  If  its  ever  predicted  then  we  better  be  prepared!  To  me  its  only  someone's  theory  about  how  things  would  turn  out  if  Power  plants  did  fail.  It  does  not  mean  it'll  become  society.  I  would  surely  assume  that  electricians  would  work  their  hardest  &  do  what  they  can.  &  our  president  &  all  the  government  agents  in  our  country  would  be  displeased  if  this  sort  of  thing  really  did  resort  to  violence  &  turning  on  each  other.  Let  me  just  say  that  I  think  (America  is  a  better  country  than  this)  helping  each  other  out  rather  than  defying  one  another  as  it  tells  in  this  story,  (After Armageddon).
It  makes  you  wonder  how  you'd  handle  things  exactly,  would  you  stay  &  fight  off  the  gangs,  shoot  your  way  in  &  out  of  towns  like  some  people  would  or  would  you  go  in  the  other  direction  to  maintain  a  positive  manner  in  a  tragic  sudden  change  in  society.  I  witnessed  humans  &  animals  dying  if  help  could  not  be  provided.  &  I  don't  think  anybody  would  want  to  accept  the  truth.  Because  of  the  shock.  Finding  proper  solutions  would  always  be  necessary.
This  copy  is  from  the (History  channel.  They  don't  however  have  all  the  solutions  if  this  ever  happens,  just  some  of  them,  &  being  as  it  is  the  world  is  growing  constantly,  &  us  not  seeing  our  foolishness  until  its  too  late,  this  event  is  possible.  I  can  understand  if  some  viewers  if  or  are  disturbed  by  disc  2  entitled  (After  Armageddon).  But  it  is  truly  an  inside  look  from  History  channel  of  an  unstoppable  fate  twisting  peoples  way  of  thinking  who  play  the  characters  in  the  film.  The  man  his  wife  &  young  son,  had  to  use  good  judgement.  It  is  a  time  &  place  where  you  must  get  what  you  can  from  the  convenient  stores  while  you  can,  &  get  well  stocked  if  you  do  not  like  the  idea  of  scavenging,  peoples  patience  will  also  be  tested  as  well.  Having  to  go  into  an  empty  mobile  home  to  find  food  &  water  like  they  did  where  a  dead  person  is  is  disgusting.  One  thing  they  did  was  good,  helping  a  person  in  need,  a  person  who  was  still  alive  on  the  side  of  the  road,  &  was  all  bloody,  &  must  have  gotten  wounded  by  the  gangs  or  a  suspicious  acting  person,  they  were  nice  enough  to  give  him  some  shots  of  medicine  to  help  save  his  life.  That  makes  a  huge  difference  to  me,  giving  someone  help,  which  before  hand  nobody  was  generous  enough  to  give  them.  It  is  hard  to  imagine  innocent  people,  (the  husband wife  &  son)  being  threatened  in  a  harsh  way,  or  being  rejected,  by  people  here  in  there,  in  a  world  that  has  almost  turned  cruel.  &  yes  it  would  take  an  awful  long  time  before  everyone's  thoughts  weren't  the  most  negative.  The  guy  asking  (Have  you  seen  Mike?  &  I'm  sitting  here  watching  the  show  wondering,  Who  the  hell  is  Mike?  Is  he  this  mans  son  or  something??  Then  he  just  turns  into  a  violent  nutcase!)  I'd  have  shot  that  guy  right  there!  You  would  find  crazy  people  for  quite  sometime,  before  things  started  to  calm  down,  &  people  adapted  &  accepted  what  society  has  become.  Law  &  order  I  believe  would  come  back  somehow  eventually.
History  channel  at  least  this  episode  in  the  Series  (after  People)  does  open  up  your  eyes  when  you  watch  it,  even  makes  you  stop  &  think  a  little  bit.
Scary, Disturbing, gross,  I  admit  it.  The  only  question  I  have  is,  (Will  we  have  a  solution  if  this  event  ever  takes  place  in  society  &  reality?)  &  get  our  world  up  &  running  again?  Surely  with  of  all the  knowledge  we've  gotten  since  we  humans  have  been  here,  all  the  inventions  we've  designed,  we  may  have  a  fighting  chance!  I'm  no  expert  or  nothing.  The  people  talking  as  I  watched  this  episode  entitled  (After Armageddon)  sure  knew  how  to  explain  things  to  us.  Wish they  could  have  mentioned  a  little  more  to  us.  I  didn't  like  disc  3.  Disc  1  tells  very  much  the  same  stuff  as  the  other  show  would  (Life  after  people).
I've  watched  History  channel  for  a  long  time.  This  is  one  of  the  best  shows  ever  viewed,  (After People)  &  the  other  show  entitled  (Life  after  People)  which  I  now  own  on  DVD.  Never  seen  anything  quite  like  it.",1480032000,2,6345,4.349301397205589

3324013,5,B0012IV3PU,"If you're a fan of Shattered Ravings (my blog), then I'm sure you've seen me mention the zombie apocalypse every now and then.  I do this in half-humor and good fun...however, a part of me thinks something like that might be a possibility one day.  If a catastrophe does happen, how would humanity react?  And how long would it take until we die off?  Continuing with that thought, what would the world be like after we're gone?  The fine folks at The History Channel and Lionsgate offer us up a chilling and vivid glimpse of what the future without humankind might be like.

I've been a big fan of LIFE AFTER PEOPLE for a long time.  It's fascinating to me to see what Earth might be like after we are gone.  There are so many aspects to such a phenomenon, were it to happen, that it is staggering when you consider them.  So seeing LIFE AFTER PEOPLE in this three-disc collection was a huge treat for me.

But the others in this anthology are just as poignant.  MEGA DROUGHT shows us how the world could spiral out of control if global warming brought on massive water shortages.  Many of us in the U.S. take clean water for granted...but seeing what could happen if it were no longer in abundance is a terrifying concept.

MEGA FREEZE gives us a glimpse into how our world could quickly deteriorate if abrupt climate changes forced the planet into Ice Age-like freezing conditions.  Putting up with the occasional snow storm in the U.S. is one thing...but conditions like those portrayed in this piece go way beyond extreme.  The result is a horrifying scenario that will make your blood run cold.

But what happens if we as a species don't die off quickly?  AFTER ARMAGEDDON takes an interesting look into what might result after a catastrophic event.

This collection is an intense and well-made glimpse into how our future might just play out, and what the world will be like without us.  There is no preaching or underlying message in AFTER PEOPLE, just speculation and, where possible, fact.  This documentary is fun and entertaining, and I highly recommend giving it a look.  Be prepared to lose a few hours, though...this engrossing collection will suck you in and keep you riveted until the end.",1370995200,8,2206,4.648578811369509
3324014,3,B0012IV3PU,"It looks like the History Channel got some new software they wanted to try out. Most of what they have to put out is remedial: metal rusts, plants grow in odd places, and cockroaches adapt. Some of what it has is dumb speculation designed to generate interest and ratings such was gliding cats. I didn't find it well researched. It gave you the impression that if people suddenly were rapture, nuclear power plants would quietly shut themselves down without incident. What happens to all that hot spent fuel in the crowded pools once those cooling water pumps are turned off? We know the answer to that.

The film speculates that all the metal and concrete cities would be destroyed by fire without firemen, but then show how they would crumble due to rust and then grow up to be highrises for cats. Clearly they were pulling stuff out of their butts, saying whatever sounded good at the time. The filming at Chernobyl was boring and lasted way too long and they didn't have a clue as what to do about zoo animals.

3324017,5,B0012IV3PU,"This isn't a movie I'd want to have, but it was GREAT to watch once. It's a look at what would become of the world if we were to up and disappear one day.

It's divided into sections: one day after people, one week after, one month after, one year, ten years, 25 years, 100 years, 1000 years, and out to 50,000 years IIRC. So it starts with our pets having to find a way out of the house, then vermin going through the food on pantry and store shelves, to what happens to houses after decades of neglect. Eventually you see some of humanity's most durable structures collapse: the Eiffel Tower, the Space Needle, and other things come down--though they're replayed a few too many times.

Of course you have to suspend disbelief a little and assume that all of humanity has disappeared one day for no apparent reason. But I don't think that's a problem for this film, since it's not suggesting that's a realistic scenario, just a ""Hey, what if..."" kind of idea. The movie is remarkable for consulting heavily with scientists and engineers to get the details right.

So it's ironic that my one real criticism is that it gets the collapse of the Golden Gate Bridge WRONG. After thousands of years, the cables holding up the bridge weaken and snap, and then the support towers sag toward the middle. That's backward--as with any suspension bridge, the cables are anchored at either end, pulling outward with tons of force. If the cables were to snap, the support towers would be yanked *away* from the center. (See astronomer Phil Plait's review of The Core at badastronomy.com for details.) It's puzzling that they did the Golden Gate wrong, considering the effort they put into getting engineering details right in this film. But other movies have done the same, probably because it seems intuitive. I wouldn't say it spoiled the movie, but it did make me wonder what other technical blunders they may have made.",1351814400,,1910,4.678571428571429

For a much better treatment of the subject, try the excellent (although depressing) book by Allen Weisman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-Without-Us/dp/0312427905/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World Without Us</a>.)",1259366400,2,655,6.153846153846154

3324032,4,B0012IV3PU,"Although the concept behind History's Life After People - what would/will happen to earth if/when the human race cease's to inhabit it - may not be new, the presentation, production value, special effects, and impact of this brilliantly produced documentary put it in a league of its own. ""Greenies,"" young people, and even those who aren't normally fans of documentaries or ""nature shows"" will thoroughly enjoy this documentary.

Life After People theorizes about the fate of the earth when humans no longer ""control"" it; how it would (re)turn to a more natural state ""if"" we went extinct. Which ecosystems would take over? What animals, plants and insects would survive? What remnants of the industrialized world would remain, and for how long? Based on both evidence of the demise of past civilizations and computer simulated models, this documentary explores the hypothetical (although sadly, all too likely) process our planet may embark on should/when we're no longer here.

Visually stunning and insightful, this special is especially thought provoking for young viewers, who also happen to hold the fate of the world in their hands. Taking on subjects as ""small"" as household pets, as complex as New York skyscrapers, and as large - philosophically and scientifically speaking - as the possibility of evolution happening all over again, Life After People is an outstanding, informative, and extremely entertaining documentary. Thanks to the engaging subject matter and excellent production, it's sure to live on as one of the History Channel's best presentations.

3324033,5,B0012IV3PU,"The basic premise of Life After People is that humans are suddenly gone and it doesn't matter how such a disappearance happens.  The movie explores the question of how long would it take the physical remains of human presence to completely disappear and/or be transformed.

The movie particularly resonated with me because I have often wondered the same thing.  I have even done sketches of, say, the Statue of Liberty toppled over and half-covered with sand, or Big Ben in London halfway submerged, or the Golden Gate Bridge collapsed.  I supposed that this line of thought was inspired by my observations, over the years, of the ruins of ancient civilizations, coupled with the realization that nothing lasts forever, leading to speculation as to what might the ruins of our current civilization look like.

By the way, the series is even better because it has the time to go into more detail.  Life After People is, above all, an excellent presentation of entropy in action.",1252454400,,977,4.926829268292683

3324035,3,B0012IV3PU,"Imagining our planet after people no longer exist is fascinating and I'm happy to see this and other books and DVDs dealing with it. I've purchased an assortment of both; Life After People was the first DVD I watched and I've not yet read any of the books.

I'm glad that the creators chose to just do away with people rather than spend a lot of time speculating on how we met our demise or even where our bodies disappeared to. (Maybe I still haven't gotten over the rotting bodies in ""The Stand"".) That wasn't the story I was interested in hearing when I purchased Life After People.

Life After People starts out promisingly enough and certainly manages to engage viewers emotionally by playing on our concern over the fate of house pets. And, for the most part, I found the entire show interesting. I particularly liked the visit to the abandoned town near Chernobyl.

Ultimately, though, I felt too much time was spent talking about corrosion and how human made structures would deteriorate and collapse. It seemed to get repetitive. I would have liked to have seen a lot more focus on plant, animal and insect life and how particular species might - or might not - adjust in their altered habitat. I also would have liked more focus on what part climate changes brought about by the absence of humans would play in flora and fauna behavioral changes, survival and evolution.

Still, I found this a good introduction to the subject and I particularly think it would appeal to younger viewers, spurring their curiosity. I hope I'll find more information on plants and animals, etc. - and a little less on corrosion - in some of the other materials I purchased.",1251072000,4,1664,4.6689419795221845
3324036,3,B0012IV3PU,"Alan Weisman, author of ""A World Without Us"", should be getting some money for coming up with this idea.

I'm gettin' old. So most of the science and nature shows have loud ""music"" blast at you, lots of jittery, shaky cam action, weird camera angles, and you can't stay with one scene longer than about 10 seconds or so before jumping to the next image. A.D.D. culture. Video game culture. This series is pretty good, but it should stay with one city or area at a time. But instead each episode jumps from city to city, back and forth, while skipping ahead into the future one year, 5 years, 50, 100, 200 etc., etc. Some of what they explain doesn't need explaining and but there are enough surprises to keep you interested unless your a structural enginer or specialist of some sort. Pretty good series, but I'd recommend ""A World Without Us"" over this knockoff.",1246147200,,863,4.567741935483871
3324037,5,B0012IV3PU,"This review is regarding the Blu-ray version of this video. Nice, crisp video rendering (not great, but definitely worth the extra $$$ for the Blu-ray version). Audio is average, nothing spectacular, but then it's a documentary. Disc plays fine in my Samsung BDP-1500. Special features are interesting. Will probably buy more History Channel features on Blu-Ray as they become available.

As far as the feature and subject matter - absolutely, utterly amazing.

Personal anecdote. When I was around 12 years old, I lived in a neighborhood located next to a large cotton field. One summer a road building crew came out and constructed a  mile stretch of concrete road way off in the farthest reaches of the cotton field, for no apparent reason (it was advance work for a delayed urban expansion which did not to take place for another 15 years).

That stretch of brand new road, sitting out in the middle of the cotton field, decaying, grass and weeds growing up between the cracks, frogs, rabbits and other critters making it their home, just fascinated me. Sometimes, I would ride out to it on my bike and just sit, listen to the silence and the sounds of Nature as it slowly consumed the concrete, took back what It owned. Walking along the stretch of road, I would imagine I was the last person on Earth. That was the summer I read ""Earth Abides"" by George R. Stewart, a book that left a huge impression on me.

I've been a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction ever since.

UPDATE: Problem. On loading, the disc hang my Blu-Ray player about 50% of the time. Suspect defective mastering of the disc boot sector for the first batch of these discs (maybe why it reverted to ""unavailable"" status shortly after I bought it?).

3324039,5,B0012IV3PU,"I remember seeing the commercial for this on tv but never actually saw the program.
So I decided to plunk down the money for the DVD.
All I can say is I'm impressed.
As soon as it was over I watched it again right after.
It's a somewhat disturbing take on what would happen if people just vanished.
I was very surprised that every trace of humanity would be more or less gone in about a thousand years.
I was even more surprised at what would happen within a few weeks.
The power going out and all that.
Scary indeed.
They never go into detail as to how the humans disappear but it really doesn't matter.
The awesome force of nature would pretty much eliminate everything we have done for thousands of years.
It's a film that really makes you think and is a definite eye opener.
It pointed out a lot of things I, along with the majority of people just don't give a whole lot of thought to.
The power going out.
The flooding of the subway systems.
London and Amsterday flooding into ruin.
I guess I never really realized how much effort man has put into reshaping the world around us and without us, how quickly everything would collapse.
A brilliant film.
Great narration, great pacing.
Great Fx.
Zero complaints from me.
A must see for everyone.
Highly Recommended.",1242518400,15,1266,4.461206896551724
3324040,5,B0012IV3PU,"WARNING: I have watched the first two 1 hour episodes of Life After People which begun airing on the History Channel April 2009.  The season is slated for a total of 10 hour long (including commercials) episodes, but this DVD is only 90 minutes.  So I'm guessing you only get 2 episodes, which is a shame, as I would gladly buy the entire season based on my experience so far.  However, knowing that, on to the review:

The premise is that some disease wipes humans completely off the planet, and the film begins 1 day after humans are gone.  This leaves you on your own to ponder how this extermination could happen, and how likely it is.  There was a fascinating book I heard about through the Daily Show/Colbert on this topic, but the cool thing about this History Channel special is that you get to visually experience what no human being would be able to see--dams crushing after the force of billions of gallons of water overwhelmed them, buildings collapsing after their steel rusted, animals escaping and running free, etc.  Several experts were interviewed and they filmed on location in several interesting spots such as a deserted island in Japan that was once the most populous spot in the world, where you can see how the saltwater has attacked the large buildings and plants attacked roadways.  It makes one think how quickly evidence of man would be removed.  I hope the entire boxed set is released at a future date!

3324041,2,B0012IV3PU,"This program is made for television/ short-attention span piece of work.  It is more formatted around time for commercials than for its overall flow as a documentary.
I ordered it after reading the book ""The World Without Us"" by Alan Weisman.  I was hoping for commentary by Alan Weisman but there was none.  I feel like he did much better job in his work on an analysis of this scenario.
This effort by the history channel seems more like a Johnny-come-lately in comparison to Weisman's work and I was disappointed.",1231200000,7,516,4.711111111111111
3324042,2,B0012IV3PU,"Don't watch this: it's bad for you. Instead, read Alan Weisman's ""The World Without Us."" Weisman shows us as part of nature, affecting its cycles and processes and affected by them; the film revives obsolete tropes of a struggle for mastery between man and nature. The combat-mastery approach isn't just misleading, it's dangerous - for, as Weisman's book (along with many others) shows, it is our inability to recognize that we are part of nature that makes us such a scourge. The film imagines all traces of human civilization (except perhaps Mount Rushmore) effaced, but Weisman reminds us that we will be survived by our plastics, our stainless steel, etc. ""The world without us"" points the way to a thoughtful ecological consciousness, ""Life after people"" points away from it, making the collapse of human civilization and the longterm scarring of nature more likely. And in the meantime, Weisman shows the way to enjoy being part of nature, and so to accept our inevitable disappearance not as a disaster and defeat but as but one part of the remarkable unfolding of chemical and biological histories on this remarkable planet.",1229126400,10,1133,5.031914893617022

3324046,2,B0012IV3PU,"I had high hopes for this video but in the end it was essentially all about how the lack of maintenance will affect the corrosion and decay of various types of structures - concrete, steel, etc. etc.  I guess the feel was less apocalyptic than I had hoped.  In defense I suppose this would have come off as too political if the film dealt more directly with long term environmental impacts from a scientific peerspective. They did visit a town abandoned in the aftermath of Chernobyl and talked about the dogs and cats (avoided discussion of what domestication does to plants and animals), but the film would have had more impact if it dealt with these issues.",1222214400,15,660,4.632478632478633

3324050,5,B0012IV3PU,"This program explores the likely outcome of a sudden disappearance of all humans from the Earth.  How or why this would happen is not covered: the subject of this DVD is the succession of events following such a disappearance, as things arranged and constructed by humans fail over time (out to 100,000 years after said disappearance).

Pros:
- The show is very dramatic and maintains interest.
- Graphical effects demonstrate likely outcomes, including spectacular sequences of large-scale collapses.
- Experts showcased on the show seem authoritative and provide relevant insight.

Cons (these are all minor, in my opinion):
- At times, this program seems a little too dramatic.  The narration sometimes comes from the perspective that nature is hostile, and surprise is expressed at the notion that ""the planet and life on it would go on without us"".
- One of the featured experts was a little too philosophical.  Though I liked hearing most of what he had to say, he was given too much air time.
- Given the extremely low cost of computer-generated special effects today, visual quality should have been better.

This is not a ""con"", but my guess is that the depicted timeline is somewhat accelerated.

In short, this production poses a very interesting hypothetical question, explores the likely answer with experts and presents the whole package very well.
Flaws are relatively small.

If one is interested in this subject, note that a similar program has been developed, ""National Geographic: Aftermath - Population Zero"" (2008).",1220486400,5,1536,5.140562248995984
3324051,4,B0012IV3PU,"I enjoyed this video very much.  It helps put in perspective how insignificant humankind's contributions to the global ecosystem really are.  It appears that even with all of our ""detrimental"" impact on the world's atmosphere, the planet will find a way to continue on without us.  It gives creedence to both Psalm 78:69 and to George Carlin (who says the planet is just fine).  People will go away and within five years nature will be taking over what we created.

I also couldn't help but think of the contribution of my own profession, building operational maintenance.  Senior management always wants to defer maintenance.  Well here is a classic case of what can happen if maintenance is pushed back too far.  Things fall apart, duh.

Anyway, this was an entertaining video with some good graphics and some interesting hypotheses.  If feral cats want to occupy former high rises, then learn how to glide (flying cats ala flying squirrels) that seems plausible.  Since we have a real life abandoned city in the Ukraine to show how nature can reclaim cities, some of what was shown is not merely specualtion and guessing.",1219276800,3,1124,4.894179894179894

Some of the stuff that went into this film is absolutely amazing.

Though the graphics aren't fantastic fantastic, they're pretty good - at least one fantastic, and even if it gets a little repetitive towards the end - the information is what this move was made for - and it certainly delivers

In a millenium, the great bridges, buildings and other edifices of man will all be gone save perhaps the pyramids, Mount Rushmore and Hoover Dam.

Overall, a well done and unsettling documentary. Except of course, if you are one of the scientists who was interviewed in the documentary.

Although I do agree that there are some things that need to be addressed and so on, and it would be interesting to know the scenarios in which people would die off (but that's really not the point of it, the point is what happens to the Earth, not to us.

My kids felt bad about the fate of the pets, animals, and especially the dogs. They didn't believe Earth could ever be depopulated; they said there will always be people on Earth because we reproduce like crazy.
I felt the video needed to start with some reason for the total absence of human life. It would have been interesting to see what would have happened to the bodies. The animals feasting on human bodies would be gruesome, but kids like gore. Under what conidtions would only humanity die off? It is the kind of story you can start anywhere.

3324057,5,B0012IV3PU,"I was mesmerized by this speculative look at how all of the works of our hands will begin to vanish -- if humans suddenly are removed from the Earth.

Watch this documentary, read Psalm 90 or Ecclesiastes -- or sections of Jesus' teachings, if you're Christian -- or sections of the Quran or the Vedas about the impermanence of life. There's also a fascinating connection here with Buddhist visions of the world around us. In other words, in addition to the science lessons and suspenseful, sci-fi tone of this documentary -- there's also a haunting and most likely a very healthy moment of spiritual reflection in viewing this film.

Try it with a small discussion group, in fact. There'll be no shortage of discussion after watching this film.

The documentary is produced in a fast-cut, MTV style, but that's the popular look and feel of the hit series on Discovery and other nonfiction cable channels these days.

The idea is quite simple: An array of scientists and engineers lay out how our homes, offices, roads and everything else we've made and built would begin crumbling the moment we leave the scene.

There were no moralistic lessons to be learned or cautionary advice as in ""An Inconvenient Truth"" or ""11th Hour"".  The only point is that when people leave the earth and have all returned to their basic chemical elements, the earth itself will start it's transformation to slough off its skin of human construct.  A lot of thought went into the chronological layering of how and when this will be accomplished.  I'd never given much thought to when steel (if not protected by paint) would morph back to iron.  I'd never considered what would happen to the family pet if Purina weren't around.
