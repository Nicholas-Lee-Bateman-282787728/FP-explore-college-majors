8324987,5,B000BKXA3I,"I am responding to a previous reviewer who dinged this program because it didn't deliver enough ""dark secrets"" in Newton's life for his taste. I would have thought that the revelation of Newton's long-standing heretical beliefs, in a country just recovering from a half-century of religeous strife, which could have cost him, at the very least, his position and standing, would be enough. But I guess that muck-raking still has an audience.

I want to comment on the excellence of this program's narative describing Newton's scientific contributions to humanity. I teach high school physics and am reasonably well read on Newton. I am always on the look-out for alternate means of instruction in the history of science for my students. This video is the best that I have encountered for presenting a balanced view of this complex man's life and accomplishments. It moves quickly enough to maintain students' attention, and it doesn't shy away from Newton's falibilities. But it concentrates on the nature of his science and the revolutionary nature of his discoveries. A show that can achieve this deserves a better Amazon ""star"" ranking than one based solely on a reviewer's pique over its failure to deliver more dirt.",1157846400,3,1220,5.1
8324988,4,B000BKXA3I,"This program about Isaac Newton was very informative and entertaining.  For those who know nothing or little about Newton, this video serves as a good starting point.

My only complaint about it, is that there isn't very much about the ""dark secrets"" mentioned in the title.  Yes, there is some discussion about Newton's dabbles with alchemy, and a little about his unorthodox religious beliefs, but the bulk of the program focuses on Newton's achievements: his development of calculus, the theory of gravity, and his landmark work, the Principia.  And that's fine, I suppose.  But the title leads one to believe that the program will focus on a ""sinister side"" of Newton, and you don't really get that angle.  Aside from that, though, this was a very good program.

Four stars.",1134172800,,778,4.938461538461539
