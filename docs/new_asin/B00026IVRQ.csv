8022883,2,B00026IVRQ,"The movie itself only plays the first two episodes then automatically goes back to the main menu. For you to watch all of the episodes, you have to fast forward once it gets to the end of the 2nd episode. Then, there are only a handful of Popeye cartoons, I believe there is more Superman than just about anything on this DVD. But for only a few bucks, I do like all of the classic selections the DVD has.",1338854400,,405,4.139240506329114

8022886,1,B00026IVRQ,Warner Brothers is in the process of restoring the classic B&W and Color Popeye Cartoons for a 2007 release.  Original Paramount main & end titles will be a part of the restoration.,1149811200,,181,4.65625
8022887,2,B00026IVRQ,"I'm a Fleischer fan, so the prospect of having a copy of ""Alladin and His Wonderful Lamp"" was very appealing to me. There's good news and bad news: it's cheap (good), but low quality and fraudulently marketed (bad).

The CD promised ""Popeye and other cartoon treasures"". In fact, there are two Popeye cartoons and eight ""other"" cartoons (seven Superman and one Woody Woodpecker). OK, ""Aladdin"" is 30 minutes long, but the other one (""Assault and Flattery"") is not what was listed on the cover, and only 1/3 of the material is actuall Popeye. Meanwhile, Treasure Box Collection sells a DVD labeled ""Superman"", which is probably only 1/3 Superman. I guess the idea is to sell you an armload of them, so you actually get what you paid for eventually. Not quite bait-and-switch, but close enough for me.

The first Popeye cartoon is apparently pirated from another distributor. Even though it's in the public domain, they edited out all but two frames of the title shot, which was inconveniently labeled ""Copyright 1999 Burbank Video"". Oops.

The second Popeye cartoon is ""Aladdin"". Video quality is abysmal. This one was probably also pirated from a bad VHS tape. BUT it's a fabulous cartoon, even in a lousy stolen copy. For $2, you can't really go wrong.

If you're a big Popeye fan, all the cartoons you're looking for are on the ""Betty Boop"" disc. Only two or three are Fleischer productions, while the rest are the awful stuff from the late '40s and '50s.

So, if you want Popeye, buy Betty Boop. If you want Superman, buy Popeye. If you want Betty Boop, buy ...?",1099526400,5,1565,4.738970588235294
