2062048,5,B000244F2S,"What a treat & great bargain this set is ! Three key classics,and two other outstanding Films Noir. I thought the quality was fine considering the age of the films,available prints,and the price. Look at the cost of ""Pickup on South Street"" for example. My only complaint would be that they used prints that cut ,or cut themselves the end credits from ""Murder My Sweet"", and ""Gun Crazy"" .
This set says ""Vol. 1"" on the slip case,lets hope that means there will be more excellent collections like this at such a reasonable cost. I'd like to see a few of the classic Noirs that never made it to VHS included on future sets. Outstanding Films Noir such as ""The Big Carnival,[Ace in the Hole]""; ""Nightmare Alley"";""Angel Face"";""Thieve's Highway"", and many more that need to be released.

2062050,3,B000244F2S,"The mid to late 1940s produced a string of classic film noir motion pictures that effectively paved the road to more cynicism and realism in the movies. Now, Warner Brothers Home Entertainment effectively brings together five of the most riveting examples of the genre in one compelling box set. What follows is a brief plot outline of each of the five films included.

GUN CRAZY: Sigmund Freud would have a field day with Bart Tare (John Dall), the gun crazy marksman who just can't live without always having a firearm in his possession. Feeling more than a little inadequate, shall we say, Bart soon teams up with Laurie Starr (Peggy Cummins) a woman for who the moniker - girls gone wild - must have been invented. Laurie's high life fuels both their rabid passions for each other and a life of crime. The film is one of those cautionary tales that attempts to chart what happens to individuals to whom life does not follow the straight and narrow trajectory.

THE ASPHALT JUNGLE: is an artfully gritty jewel heist caper gone horribly wrong. Director, John Huston employs both an economy of plot and depth of his characters to flesh out the story. Sam Jaffe is Doc, the criminal mastermind with a weakness for hoop earrings and tight skirts. Louis Calhern is the middle aged, penniless fencer, Ennrich, and sugar daddy to Marilyn Monroe. There is nothing cartoonish or clich&eacute; about Sterling Hayden's particularly powerful Dix Handley, the tense enforcer of the group.

Jacque Tourneur's OUT OF THE PAST stars Robert Mitchum as sleepy-eyed Jeff Bailey, the ultra-cool, ultra savvy former P.I. hiding out from his former life as a gas station owner. But the past catches up with Bailey in the embodiment of Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas). Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) enters the picture as the atypical femme fatale, whose bite is more venomous than the poisonous web of destruction and deceit that she manages to ensnare everyone in.

In ""MURDER, MY SWEET Dick Powell is detective Philip Marlowe - hired by an ex-con (Mike Mazurki) to hunt down his old flame. But the plot spins out of control when a murder leads to Marlowe's engagement by a manipulative woman (Claire Trevor), to recover her missing jewels.

Finally, there's the forgotten gem, THE SET-UP, a taut and exciting 71 minute masterpiece that pulls no punches when it comes to exposing the seedy underworld racket of professional boxing. The sadly forgotten Robert Ryan stars as Stoker, a once optimistic, once handsome pugilist who falls prey to two unscrupulous fight promoters who make a deal with an underworld kingpin to throw the fight. The wrinkle: nobody tells Ryan that he's got to lose, hence he's driven to win.

THE TRANSFERS: In keeping with Warner's current trend of not doing all that is humanly possible to completely restore and remaster classic movies on DVD, the cumulative quality of these film is just above average. The gray scale for each is nicely balanced with deep solid blacks and relatively clean whites. There's a considerable amount of film grain and a lot of age related artifacts for a visual presentations that, while a considerable improvement over previously issued VHS tapes, are still below par for what might have been if more digital wizardry had been applied. There's also a considerable amount of fine detail shimmering, particularly in OUT OF THE PAST as well as pixelization and edge enhancement. Though the picture quality of all films in this box set can be solidly rendered, over all the quality for each is inconsistently rendered.  The audio is mono but nicely balanced.

EXTRAS: The real disappointment here is in the extra features which amounts to little more than a string of audio commentaries by film noir authors. But the commentaries aren't very informative. James Ursini's commentary - for example - boils down to the obvious with him telling the viewer throughout every scene how dark and starkly contrasted scenes are a hallmark of film noir. Drew Casper doesn't even introduce himself or his credentials for his audio commentary on THE ASPHALT JUNGLE until a good fifteen minutes into his rambling viewpoint. There are theatrical trailers too but hey, for a box set it would have been nice to have a retrospective of the history on film noir, don't you think?

BOTTOM LINE: These films are a definite must for anyone's home library. Their lack of consistent quality not withstanding, I recommend this box set.",1089072000,52,4438,4.946308724832215
2062051,5,B000244F2S,"A dark night. A rain-drenched sidewalk. A streetlight flickering on the pavement.  Murky shadows, creepy shapes. A gunshot. A beautiful woman chased down the street by a man whose body is encased in a trenchcoat and whose face is obscured by a fedora. Relax. Loosen up. Enjoy.  You haven't witnessed a crime, but are witness to the America's newest nostalgia craze: Film Noir. Shadows, Lies and Private Eyes: The Film Noir Collection is a set of five flicks overflowing with dames, gats and double-crosses, and packaged with bonuses including audio commentaries, trailers, interviews and other assorted gimcracks and gewgaws.
Gun Crazy, which film noir expert Eddie Muller refers to as ""a noir Bonnie and Clyde,"" stars Peggy Cummins and John Dall. (To noir buffs, these two are major stars. To all others ...who?) The blatant sexuality of Dall's love for guns and Cummins love for ... well ... killing people is extraordinary for 1949, and today, the creepy carnality is still disturbing.
The masterpiece The Asphalt Jungle (1950) walks the line between gangster and noir, but with a young Marilyn Monroe and a studly Sterling Hayden, John Houston's tale of dishonor among thieves torches the screen with lust and violence.
The Set-Up, directed by Robert Wise way, way before The Sound of Music and starring Robert Ryan, is the personal favorite of both the director and the star. Filmed in real time, it's a 72 minutes tale of life before, during and after the boxing match that defines a fighter's life. It's all here --- the smoke-filled rooms, the bloodthirsty fans, the savagery in the ring, the delusional dreams of boxing's palooka world.
Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer heat up Jacques Tourneur's Out of the Past (1947). With Mitchum spouting lines like ""Then build my gallows high, baby,"" this archetypal noir has a hoodwinked detective in Mitchum and a scary hood in Kirk Douglas. The Warner collection rounds out with Edward Dmytryk's Murder, My Sweet (1944), as quintessential film noir as you can get. Based on Raymond Chandler's novel Farewell, My Lovely, the flick stars Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe. The search for the treacherous Velma through the indigent void called Los Angeles powers this black excursion into near oblivion. As Powell/Marlowe says: ""I'm just a small businessman in a very messy business.""
So go, sweetheart. Enjoy. Get the lowdown on all the cats and kittens, molls and johns, and bad guys, hustlers and con-men who hawk their hearts on the streets of broken dreams called film noir.

From the technical point of view, the quality of image of those old films is very good and there are also English subtitles available for non-native speakers 'like me). Finally, the box is also quite beautiful and presents well on the shelf.

I recommend this collection with whole my heart. Below, if you are interested, more details about the five films, with some SPOILERS.
-------------------------------------------
ASPHALT JUNGLE: A film proving that after all, crime is only a left-handed form of human endeavor...,

This 1950 archi-classic of film noir is very famous - and every single ounce of this fame is well deserved! Below, more of my impressions, with some very limited SPOILERS.

As probably everybody knows in this film John Huston describes the story of a daring heist and its consequences for all those involved. I will not say anything about the plot, but here is the dramatis personae:

- Dr Erwin Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe): a middle aged genius of crime
- Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden): a stickup man addicted to gambling
- Alonzo Emmerich (Louis Calhern): a rich and influent mob lawyer
- Gus Minissi (James Whitmore): a hunchback, owner of a little bar; also occasionally a wheelman
- Louis Ciavelli (Anthony Caruso): a respectable family man, husband and father, who can open any safe in less than 3 minutes...
- Cobby (Marc Lawrence): a slimy, sleazy, cowardly bookmaker
- Lt. Ditrich (Barry Kelley): a cop - dirty in all meanings of this term
- Doll Conovan (Jean Hagen): an exotic dancer down on her luck
- Bob Brannom (Brad Dexter): a Private Eye moonlighting as repo man, enforcer and occasionally also as hit man
- Angela Phinlay (Marilyn Monroe): a gorgeous, young ""trophy mistress"" taking good care of her sugar daddy (Emmerich)
- Police Commissioner Hardy (Sam McIntire): a high ranking cop struggling to face an unprecendented crime wave
- May Emmerich (Dorothy Tree): Alonzo Emmerich's wife of many, many years; presently sick, bed-ridden and very unhappy

As we can see the characters are quite stereotyped, but the scenario, the dialogs and the masterful control of the whole film by the director made ""Asphalt Jungle"" into something REALLY unique! It is clear from the first moment, that all actors were enchanted to play in this film and gave EVERYTHING they had in themselves! The three main actors, Sam Jaffe, Sterling Hayden and Louis Calhern are purely INCREDIBLE! Marilyn Monroe appears here relatively briefly, but she is amazingly sexy and completely unforgettable. This role was a big step towards her legendary destiny with ""Niagara"" and ""How to marry a millionaire"" only three years ahead.

The greatness of this film is not only in the scenario but also in the message - we all have weaknesses and if we cannot resist temptation we are all finally doomed by our sins, may it be pride, lust, greed - or cowardice, a sin frequently underestimated, as for some reason it didn't make the famous short list... It also teaches us two well known truths:

1. You never know your own happiness until you wasted what you had and didn't respect
2. Payback is a bitch! And when it is payback time, the wicked are ultimately punished not only proportionally to their crimes, but also appropriately to their sins...

Bottom line, from the first to the last moment, this is a GREAT film, a great masterpiece of world cinema, to discover absolutely! Enjoy!
-----------------------------------
GUN CRAZY: ""Deadly is the female"" - a story about people who kill other people so they don't have to work...

Vaguely inspired by the crimes committed by Bonnie and Clyde gang, this is a very good, sad and shocking ""film noir"" from 1950. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

Before going further, one important precision: the initial title of this film was ""Deadly is the female"" - and we will see a little bit later why it was a much better title than ""Gun crazy""...

This film tells the story of Barton Tare, a man who always was fascinated by firearms, since his earliest childhood and of Annie-Laurie Starr, the love of his life, a girl who openly admitted that she is ""bad"". She later added ""but I will try to be good"" - but she never intended to try very hard...

Barton Tare is played by John Dall, born as John Jenner Thompson in 1918, a tall, handsome actor who played more in theater and on TV than in movies, albeit he was nominated for an Oscar for his big screen debut ""The corn is green"" in 1945 and was also very much noticed by the critics in Hitchcok's ""Rope"" in 1948. Dall died from heart attack in 1971. He is today mostly remembered by film noir amateurs precisely for his brilliant performance in ""Gun crazy"".

Annie-Laurie Starr is played by Peggy Cummins, born Augusta Margaret Fuller in 1925, a very attractive British actress, who, as a very young starlet was one of bilionnaire's Howard Hughes girlfriends, before dumping him in 1945 for a young war hero, a certain John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who was just beginning a political career. Their affair lasted a couple of years but ended when her career took off for real in 1947. Even if ""Gun crazy"" was not a box office success, she was very much noticed nevertheless and she kept playing a lot after that. Her greatest role was in the legendary horror ""The night of the demon"" by Jacques Tourneur in 1957 and she is still remembered for this film by cinephiles.

In 1950 she married a wealthy British businessman, Derek Dunnett and had two children with him. In 1961 she retired from acting to take care of her family. She and her husband remained married until his death in 2001. In the Year of Grace 2013 she is still very much with us - and in January 2013, at the occasion of Film Noir City Festival in San Francisco she was honored with a special award for her role in ""Gun crazy"".

I will not say too much about the story told in the film, except for one thing - the title ""Gun crazy"" is a little bit misleading, especially when we begin to watch the film. Barton Tare is certainly a gun fetishist and that from his early childhood - but he is NOT EXACTLY crazy and even if he enjoys target shooting, he certainly never intended to shoot PEOPLE. In fact, until the day he met the woman of his life, he was a slightly odd but ultimately harmless bloke... She on another hand... Well, believe me, there is a reason why this film was initially supposed to have for title ""Deadly is the female""...

There are many reasons why I liked this film, not the least of which is the moral tone it contains - very different and in my opinion much superior to the horribly nihilistic message given much later by the much more known ""Bonnie and Clyde"" film... In this film murder is shown for what it is - an evil thing, which automatically expels the perpetrator from the community. And killing people simply because you do not wish to work is even worse than evil - it is also dirty and ugly...

The ending is very poignant, very shocking, very surprising and very symbolic - and incredibly well filmed!

Bottom line, this is an excellent ""film noir"", to discover absolutely! Enjoy!
-------------------------------------------------------------
MURDER MY SWEET: ""I don't know on whose side I am. I don't know which side anybody's on. I don't even know who's playing today.""

This 1944 adaptation of Raymond Chandler novel is a great classic of film noir, an absolute treasure and an incredibly entertaining watch. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

The film begins with private detective Philip Marlowe (Dick Powell) being contacted by a recently out of prison giant, a certain ""Moose"" Malloy (""Peop'e call me Moose. Cause 'm large""). Played by the hulking wrestler Mike Mazurki, Moose is a pretty scary dude, in a kind of gently smiling low key way - it's not like he is actually trying to intimidate people, they are just scarred sh--tless by him kind of naturally...))) ""Moose"" Malloy hires Marlowe to find his long lost moll, a certain Velma (Claire Trevor) - and from the moment the detective starts the investigation, all the hell breaks loose (even if it happens initially in slow motion).

This film is so successful first because of INCREDIBLE narration in form of Marlowe's own monolog, to which are added equally incredible dialogs - but it is not the only reason. The gallery of characters which appear in this film is also a pure delight, from disarmingly cute ingenue Ann Grayle (Anne Shirley) through the tough cynical cop, Lt. Randall and his two even more cynical wingmen, all way until a certain ""gal who'd take a drink, if she had to knock you down to get the bottle""...)))

There is of course a complicated riddle to be solved (in fact, more than one), people play their cards pretty close to their chests and have more hidden agendas than private detectives have debts and all secrets are revealed only progressively, slowly, with everything being explained only at the end, during a pretty dramatic finale, which some people will not survive...

The tone of this film noir is of course pretty dark but the humour softens it a lot and ultimately (after the great finale) it ends on a rather light-hearted note and in a different way than the much darker and cynical novel - and I for one found this way to end the film a very good decision and really liked it.

Bottom line, this is an EXCELLENT film, to see absolutely! Enjoy!
-------------------------------------------
OUT OF THE PAST: A ""film noir"" so very ""noir"" that it is pure gold!

I loved this movie! This is an excellent ""oldie but goldie"" film noir, with magnificent actors and a great scenario. This review contains some limited SPOILERS!

In ""Out of the past"" all the necessary characters are present and accounted for. There is a (former) private investigator (Robert Mitchum), cynical but not entirely bad, bearing many scars on his body and soul, weary from carrying the weight of secrets of his somehow shadowy past. There is a ruthless, dangerous and very rich scoundrel, evil to the bone but brilliant, charismatic and in some (very dark) way even charming (Kirk Douglas). There is a woman so beautiful, intelligent and smoking hot that even the hardest men will melt when meeting her gaze (Jane Greer). And finally there is a vixen so venomous and depraved (Rhonda Fleming) that it is hard to believe that this film was actually shown in theaters in 1947.

At 97 minutes it is not a very long film, but it is VERY full of events and the story is so well organized that I had the impression that it was longer - but just so we are clear, I was never bored and I adored every second of it. French director Jacques Tourneur achieved here another of his masterpieces (he also made the first ""Cat people"" and the legendary ""Curse of the demon""). There was everything in it what one can ask from a ""film noir"": shady deals were made, people were double-crossed and then the double-crossers were triple-crossed, shots were fired, cops were called, shallow graves were dug, bodies were found (and sometimes lost again), women were kissed, hearts were broken, whisky was poured (a lot), cigarettes were smoked (even more), clever one liners were fired and smarting comebacks were shot in return, and above all there was a lot of sex - absolutely never shown but nevertheless present in almost every scene...

This film is a treasure, to buy, watch and keep for re-watching! Enjoy!
--------------------------------------------
SET UP: This film will punch you in the face, follow up with an uppercut and then knock you out cold - and later you will say ""THANKS!""

Made in 1949, ""Set up"" is one of greatest masterpieces of film noir! It is a rather short (72 minutes), black and white film made on a shoestring budget with no major stars amongst the cast - but this boxing tale mixed with social drama is nevertheless a SPLENDOR! Below, more of my impressions with some SPOILERS!

""Set up"" is a boxing film. It tells the story of ""Stoker"" Thompson (Robert Ryan), a boxer who is already 38 years old and who just realized that his next bout will take place exactly 20 years after his first fight... Julie (Audrey Totter), his devoted and loving wife of many years, begs him since already sometime to stop the fighting, as he gets being not only defeated but also more and more badly beaten. But ""Stoker"" still trusts his powerful punch and still believes that he can have his big break, one big victory which will give him a shot at the title... I will not say more, but the regularly increasing tension and the power of narration reminded me of my favourite Jack London's boxing stories, ""A piece of steak"" and ""The Mexican""...

Robert Wise, who already at this time was known for some good B-movies, realised here his first masterpiece. It was later followed by many other famous films, like ""The day the Earth stood still"", ""Desert rats"", ""Helen of Troy"", ""Run silent, run deep"", ""West side story"", ""Sounds of music"", ""The Andromeda strain"" and last but not least the first ""Star Trek"" big screen movie... In this film he shows an amazing mastery in all aspects of film making, beginning with time - this film is indeed a ""real time"" story! The whole story told in ""Set up"" takes place exactly in 72 minutes and we are reminded of the passage of time by the various watches and clocks appearing at the end of every chapter, signalling the closure of one scene and the transition to the next one.

Robert Wise knew also how to use actors. Today Robert Ryan is more remembered for the roles from his later career, when he played the secondary characters (""The professionals"") villains (""The outfit"") or both (""Dirty dozen""). In the 40s and 50s however he was frequently billed on the top - and here we can clearly see that he was one hell of an actor! Audrey Totter supports him valiantly, but her role is not very complicated. This being a film noir, some gangsters have to appear and their leader, Little Boy, is a really frightening character - the actor who plays him, Alan Baxter, was already well known and seemed to be promised to an even bigger career, but in fact it was his last really significant role, as he decided to go back to theatre after that. Little Boy's moll, a loud mouthed gambling addicted gal named (of course!) Bunny, played by a little known actress Lynn Milan, appears only briefly but makes quite a splash...)))

Another of many treasures to discover in this film is the public watching the successive boxing matches - in fact believe me, those people offer a show even better than the one on the ring...))) But I will say no more here, you will have to discover it yourself.

The boxing fight in this film is A GREAT MOMENT OF CINEMA - I found it in fact better than most of the fights I have seen in other boxing movies, including ""Rocky"" films. It is scheduled to last only four rounds but it packs more suspense and drama than the murderous 15 rounders from ""Rocky"" franchise... Even better - the result of the fight is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to guess...

The last 15 minutes of the film are even more tense than the epic boxing match. And the final scene is extremely powerful, dramatic, but also beautiful - in a way. This last scene reminds us gently but firmly that when one door closes in front of us, God always opens another one...

I am very surprised that this film was not nominated for any Oscars. Shame on the Academy - they really dropped the ball on that one... In United Kingdom the greatness of this film was more recognized however - it won BAFTA 1949 award for ""Best film from any source"". It also went to win - very deservedly - the Best Cinematography Award at Cannes in 1949.

To conclude, this is a real, genuine, bona fide masterpiece of film noir AND social drama. To see absolutely! Enjoy!",1392768000,,16023,4.693376068376068

Its moody and has the lighting down perfect , The redemptive female (not every woman needs to be evil or crazy in film noir)"".A protagonist who tells his story through his eyes and body motion (the boxer) . Take away half his dialogue and the camera focuses in body movements that telegraphs his next action or thought. We are left at the end of this movie trying to decide whether good or evil has triumphed. Most need to know by who lives and who dies. Can good triumph in a film we call noir.? How about the score. The music and sounds do set up whats  happening or going to happen on the screen and to you in your seat. The background conversations and quick glances the camera throws  at us is a very important element in this genre. Other film critics agree that The Set Up maybe one of the best and overlooked films with so many of the important elements that create suspense without having to sell it to the audience with breathtaking or exotic scenes. This is an underground workd. The vistas in the Set Up are neon signs . So much is said using so little while creating a gritty atmosphere. This film has the least amount of sets and the most camera angles per scene. This does show how creative this film is from cinimatography ,direction and actors who create mood by simple  gestures.
Sorry I do ramble I just feel so strongly about an audience missing what makes a movie great other than its stars.
A NEW LOOK 2 years later : As I am in the habbit of reviewing (multiple watchings) films that I believe are heads above most other films I have collected over many years I did so with all the films in this set. This time I researched the making of these films. The studios policies at the time of making each film and the directors lifetime visions in film making. With all this in mind I discovered a new appeciation for the brilliant Asphalt Jungle directed by John Houston. This film comes out of the MGM SCHOOL of  ""A"" level musicals and and comedies. MGM needed to show a reversal in lost profits. They created ""B"" level films hoping to reserse the $ trend. Known for their ""g "" rating films this is a major swing .This film is a crime film that delves deeply into the motivations of each character including a commentary on the hypocrisy of law enforcement in post war America. These are characters that we are privy to their motivations and driving forces. It isn't that we now like them but at we understand who they are and why they do what they do. That is Hustons intent and it works. The American audience and the motion picture academy recognizes this film for the gem that it is. Nominations and great profits result. It also reverses the trend of American studios and directors from copying the French schools of film making in this genre and how Hustons film will influence the world take on crime film.
Earlier I made a big deal over THE SET UP as being the only true film noir film in this series. From a text book definition it probably is but there is obviously more than atmosphere in creating great films in this genre. It is not just intent of the director in creating a film but also whether they and the actors pull it off. These films are great examples of the end product doing just that. It is a lesson for all of us that love film and level of depth in character development. It isn't just unusual camera angles and the film texture but so much more. Each film has to measured on its own merits and not by comparison to other films. I am still learning after 45 years of film watching and appreciating all things I missed or didn't understand before.
One last comment. A film can be appreciated just for its surface presentation. I always ask the watcher "" did this film engage you"" . In truth thats all that really matters. These films and many many others do just that. Enjoy you film pleasures at what ever level you wish. Just enjoy.",1370304000,,4833,4.327814569536423

2062074,5,B000244F2S,"There isn't a single misstep in this classic collection of film noir. The stand-outs are Out of the Past and Murder My Sweet, but the other films are classics as well. The transfer is clear as is the sound.

Out of the Past features Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer and Kirk Douglass and the witty dialogue, convoluted plot and femme fatale that gives noir its specific flavor. And then there is the tragic ending for the hero who tried to escape the past. This is a favorite of mine and it gets better with each viewing. Highly recommended.

Murder My Sweet is based on a Chandler novel and is stunning as well. Dick Powell searches for a stolen necklace and a lost girlfriend, not realizing that the two are connected until it is too late. Filmed in amazing experimental style and with a good girl and a bad girl to give contrast to the usual fatale stereotype. Another favorite.

The remaining three films are almost as good and feature great directors, actors and writers showing us the seamy side of war and post-war America. A definitive collection for the noir lover or for those who want to explore the genre beyond the best known classics such as The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep and the Thin Man. Recommended.",1329004800,2,1214,4.585253456221198
2062075,5,B000244F2S,"Gun Crazy
Gun Crazy and Bonnie and Clyde are thought about in tandem and it's an unfair comparison.  Gun Crazy is a much better film than Bonnie and Clyde.  After he called Bonnie and Clyde ""a cheap piece of slapstick comedy"" the New York Times fired film critic Bosley Crowther.  ""Slop is slop"" added New York Magazine film critic John Simon.

Gun Crazy has what is known in the trade as backstory; the ins and outs of personal history that make the actions of people plausible.  Bonnie and Clyde has no backstory.  It's a straight ahead shoot `em up.  Gun Crazy has inventive and daring camera work: forward zooms from the back seat of a car, low angle shots of the car driver through a steering wheel, even techniques of cinema verit mixing studio footage with ambient noise; anything to keep the film from bogging down.  In case your interest flags, director Joseph H. Lewis puts the criminals in a dancehall dressed to the nines in their ill gotten goods, the violinist in the band gets a full frame facial, as does the band's beautiful singer and you think, just for a moment, that this couple might get away with their crimes, escape to Mexico, and raise a pair of well behaved children.  Well, dear viewer, you have been seduced and deluded - qualities no one ever attributed to Bonnie and Clyde.

A final aspect making Gun Crazy different is its leading lady Annie Starr, played convincingly by British actress Peggy Cummins.  She's a creature of primal desire and unrepentant violence who kills  because she likes doing it. Her contemporary might be Charlize Theron's Eileen Warnos character in Monster but The New Yorker (a publication that should know better) called Warnos ""a victim"" rather than a perpetrator.  In sum, the reason they don't make movies like they used to is simple: they can't.  Gun Crazy springs from an era that's gone, and isn't coming back.

Out of The Past
As the film title implies, the past exerts a powerful pull on Robert Mitchum, and even a new identity isn't enough to escape its lurid magnetism.  The main characters are not as openly attracted to guns, but even though we sometimes don't see the violence, we see its results.  Mitchum's dilemma is that attractive female liaisons reside in past and present; he can't decide which to follow and which to leave behind.  As a result, he's forever hostage to the schemes of Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas) a man who knows what he wants, but not how to get it. Male and female characters work hard to exert their will and Mitchum seems caught in the middle.  Jane Greer as Kathie Moffat is just as deadly as Peggy Cummins in Gun Crazy, if not as obvious about it.  She shot Whit once and escaped, he's a glutton, but not for punishment.  She gives it to him anyway.

The film is less adventurous with technical wizardry than Gun Crazy but still deploys many of the staples of noir storytelling.  It comes with an especially interesting commentary on film noir history by noir historian James Ursini, co author with Alain Silver of Film Noir Reader.

The Asphalt Jungle
Gun Crazy and Out Of The Past concentrate on the destinies of individuals.  The Asphalt Jungle, directed by John Huston, aims to paint broad strokes and make a sweeping social commentary.  Police Commissioner Hardy (John McIntire) explains bluntly, ""without our effort, the jungle wins.  The predatory beast emerges.""  Huston chooses a mosaic style, highlighting the motivations of individuals then weaving them together to present a tapestry of American life at mid-century.

This time, New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther was appalled because viewers got to ""hobnob"" with criminals, know their likes, dislikes, needs and desires.  He resented humanizing criminals, a quality that became a bedrock principle of neo noir films like The Godfather and Goodfellas.  Comparing the choices people make also helped hold the film together.  Outwardly affluent lawyer Alonzo Emmerich (Louis Calhern) is so focused on his role in a jewel heist, he derives no joy from life, even with a nubile Marilyn Monroe in his lap, while the calculating Dr. Riedenschneider (Sam Jaffe), normally governed by cold logic and having stolen several lifetimes of fortune, gives it all up just to see a libidinous teenager hallapalloozing in a `50's juke joint.  The film ends on a sardonic note as Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden), stricken from a gunshot wound, makes it back to what used to be his father's Kentucky horse farm, and it may be Huston's bitter conclusion that in the asphalt jungle, we'll be lucky to get more sympathy from animals than from our fellow human beings.

Murder My Sweet
Despite the number of killings and the word ""murder"" in its title, this film is a comedy of manners, enhanced by impressionistic film techniques that were innovative for 1945.  Taken as comic relief, the film provides a well deserved let up from the intensity of Gun Crazy, Out Of The Past, and The Asphalt Jungle.  Dick Powell plays Raymond Chandler private eye Christopher Marlowe, and his description of a client's home as ""Buckingham Palace"" then his hopscotching across the black and white tile floor of the ""Palace"" take the edge off suspense built up at the film's beginning.  Claire Trevor, as Helen Grayle, is quite the vamp with her hair up early in the film, but when she lets it down later, she seems to predate Gilda Radner by 30 years.  And that is probably the point about this film: the hairstyles of women, their hemlines and footwear, along with snappy one liners in the dialog, and episodic comedy in the form of Dick Powell striking a match on Cupid's derriere are all a greater joy than the storyline itself.

Probably the best way to watch this film is with the accompanying commentary by film historian Alain Silver (Raymond Chandler's Los Angeles  Overlook Press  $23.95 ) which has its own human drama:  ""this actor playing Lt. Randall is Donald Douglas.  He played a lot of military officers and FBI agents during the war.... He's only 39 here.  About a year later he died from appendicitis.""

The Setup
There was a time when boxing, baseball, and college football were the most watched sports in America and at one point in The Setup, a fan watches the fight listening to a baseball game on a radio.  Today boxing movies might be more popular than boxing itself.  Even with the measures taken to make the ring action realistic, The Setup isn't about boxing, it's about a marriage disintegrating and it's about people pursuing their dreams even at huge expense to themselves.  Robert Ryan is aging fighter Stoker Thompson struggling to control what happens in the ring, not realizing his destiny is more fully shaped by events outside it.  The film is a swirl of visceral emotions in the arena, Stoker attracted to the ring, wife Julie (Audrey Totter) repulsed by it and willing to take her chances in the huckster atmosphere in town where fate and luck intermingle. Gritty and unsparing, with look back commentary by director Robert Wise.  Martin Scorsese acknowledges the influence of Wise and The Setup in the making of his fight classic Raging Bull.",1307145600,11,7111,4.821929101401484

2062091,5,B000244F2S,"If you want to buy one film noir collection, this ""Film Noir Classic Collection, Volume 1"" from Warner Brothers is the one to get. These are all 5-star films. ""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""Gun Crazy"", ""Murder, My Sweet"", and ""Out of the Past"" are top-notch films from the height of the film noir movement 1944-1950, each representing at least one iconic film noir motif. ""The Set-Up"" is not film noir, but it's brilliant nonetheless. All of the films in this collection are accompanied by audio commentaries that vary in quality and focus but are worthwhile for film noir buffs. A better sampler of crime films from Hollywood's Golden Era could not have been assembled.

""The Asphalt Jungle"" (1950) is a steadily paced, thoughtful heist film. The requisite crew of mastermind, safecracker, driver, stick-up man, and financier are assembled to pull a grand jewel heist. Complex characters and themes make this a great deal more than a typical heist flick. Based on the novel by W.R. Burnett and directed by John Huston, ""The Asphalt Jungle"" was nominated for 4 Academy Awards. The audio commentary is by film historian Drew Casper, and there is a short introduction to the film by John Huston.

""Gun Crazy"" (1949) is a Bonnie-and-Clyde-inspired fugitive couple film that might be the most blatant expression of the sexualization of violence in the film noir canon. Sharpshooting femme fatale Annie Laurie Starr lures her equally ""gun crazy"" nice-guy husband Bart into a life of crime. Their ""amour fou"" is irrational but, at the same time, completely fascinating. The audio commentary is by film critic Glenn Erikson.

""Out of the Past"" (1947) typifies the noir style so elegantly and in so many ways. Retired private detective Jeff Bailey has settled down to a quiet life in a small town when his past comes back to haunt him. Years before, he was hired by a wealthy gambler in New York to track down the man's errant mistress Kathie. But Jeff fell head over heels for the beautiful, duplicitous Kathie, and now both the lady and her lover insist on his loyalty. Actors Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer make a striking pair, accented by beautiful low-key light. The audio commentary is by film noir historian James Ursini.

""Murder, My Sweet"" (1944) exemplifies labyrinthine plots in the style of Raymond Chandler, upon whose novel the film is based. Private detective Philip Marlowe finds that two of his cases may be related when a quest to find the girlfriend of an insistent thug and a case of missing jewels lead him around in circles but always to Mrs. Helen Grayle, the lady whose jewels went missing. The audio commentary is by film noir historian Alain Silver.

""The Set-Up"" (1949) is not film noir, but an introverted character drama starring Robert Ryan as a boxer past his prime, clinging to hopes of moderate success in the ring. ""The Set-Up"" is perhaps best remembered for being shot in real time, including15-minutes in the ring. With a beautiful naturalistic visual style and a subdued, sympathetic performance from Robert Ryan, ""The Set-Up"" is one of the most memorable boxing films made. The audio commentary is by directors Robert Wise and Martin Scorsese, who were recorded separately.",1160438400,15,3195,4.942271880819367

Out of the Past (1947), directed by Jacques Tourneur and starring Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer, and Kirk Douglas.  Mitchum plays a once private eye now fulltime schlub whose past catches up to him after getting too close to a dame he was only supposed to find for a well to do client, and ultimately ends up on the wrong end of a murder investigation.  The picture, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1), is strong, and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes across well. As far as extras, included is a commentary track with author/film-noir specialist James Ursini and subtitles in English, Spanish, and French.

The Set-Up (1949), directed by Robert Wise and starring Robert Ryan as an aging boxer who gets crossed by his unscrupulous manager while going for his last, big shot.  The picture, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1), comes across well with few, if any, noticeable flaws, and the Dolby Digital mono comes through cleanly.  As far as extras, there's an audio commentary track featuring director Robert Wise and Martin Scorsese, along with subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.

While each film in this set is outstanding in its own right, my personal favorites are The Asphalt Jungle and Murder, My Sweet.

OUT OF THE PAST

The storyline of this movie revolves around a rural gas station owner in Nevada named Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum). Bailey is dating a sweet and innocent girl named a Meta Carson (Jane Greer). One day a man comes to town looking for Bailey. As it turns out, Bailey has a secret past as a private detective who was once hired to find a beautiful and dangerous woman named Kathy Moffit (Jane Greer) for a corrupt millionaire named Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas). The assignment went wrong in many ways, but Bailey is coerced back to do one more job for Sterling. From this point on there is an elaborate and convoluted scheme of deception and betrayal.

Overall, the film has a great film noir look to it and the story is gripping. Mitchum does a stellar job as the cunning detective and Jane Greer is absolutely irresistible. Kirk Douglas also sparkles in this movie. It's also worth noting that this movie was later remade in the early '80s starring Jeff Bridges and Rachel Ward in ""Against All Odds"".

The DVD quality is near pristine overall, but some small specs of film deterioration could be seen once in a while during the course of the movie. The only bonus feature is commentary by film noir author James Ursini.

Movie: A

THE ASPHALT JUNGLE

The basic plot of the movie is that a highly educated convict Doc Erwin Riedenschneider (Sam Jeffe) is just released from prison. He then organizes a team of dubious characters to rob a million dollars worth of diamonds and precious metals from a highly secured jewelry store. Riedenschneider decides he needs some muscle or a ""hooligan"", so he hires a big countryboy named Dix Handley (Sterling Hayden). Also, they include the financial and ""fencing"" services of a wealthy criminal attorney named Lon Emmerich (Louis Calhern). From that point on there is plenty of suspense and drama as the big heist unfolds.

This movie was directed by Hollywood legend John Huston. The story itself isn't the greatest in my opinion, but the look of the movie captures the full artistry of noir film making. The movie was filmed in the seedier part of urban Los Angeles. The use of shadows and local lighting in dingy inner city settings make this movie a cinematic masterpiece. My only personal criticism of the film is that Sterling Hayden character was miscast. He played the role of the tough guy but seemed to be too easygoing and lacked ruthlessness. The Doc Riedenschneider and Lon Emmerich characters carried this movie into the upper echelon of noir crime films with their intelligent, yet immorally criminal schemes. We also get to see some limited viewing of a young and very beautiful Marilyn Monroe.

The DVD transfer is excellent overall and very sharp. On occasion some very minor film deterioration can be observed. The picture quality is razor sharp. The look of the movie (just about all it was filmed at night ) is gorgeous. There is bonus commentary by author and noir expert Drew Casper and actor James Whitmore.

THE SET-UP

The Set-Up is a real-time boxing movie. In other words, it's a 72 minute movie that shows a continuous 72 minute story. The star is Stoker Thompson (Robert Ryan) who's a 35 year old boxer in the twilight of his less than glorious career. Even though he's taken some bad beatings of late, he still remains confident that he still has a promising future ahead of him. The plot involves Stoker's manager accepting a $50 bribe that will insure that Stoker will lose tonight's fight against a young and up-and-coming boxer. But since the manager is too cheap and too certain that Stoker will lose anyway, he fails to let Stoker know that a fix is on. The rest of the movie progresses on with gripping suspense and drama with plenty of boxing action.

I really liked this movie a lot. The name of the town where the story takes place is Paradise City, but its the furthest thing from utopia. The dingy boxing arena is in an old area of town surrounded with rundown hotels, bars, dance joints and arcades. Just about all of the main characters and the boxing patrons in the movie are unlikable people, but the underlying theme for everyone is optimism - trying to win an expensive item in an arcade game, or placing a bet on a boxing match or winning a boxing match - all hoping for a better future.

The DVD transfer is superb. There are virtually no signs of film deterioration throughout the entire film. The black and white tones are pure and the picture is razor sharp. The use of shadows and directed light is magnificantly done. The dark, urban setting works magic in this film. There is bonus commentary by director Robert Wise plus added comments by Martin Scoresese.

MURDER, MY SWEET

The storyline of this movie is that a private detective, Phillip Marlow (Dick Powell), gets involved in the recovery of a stolen jade necklace. The job initially seems simple, but the investigation gets more convulated and dangerous as time goes on. During the job, Marlow encounters two very attractive women (Claire Trevor and Anne Shirley) who also make the movie very watchable.

Overall, its a beautifully filmed movie. It clearly has the classic film noir style, but the substance of the plot gets so complicated that at times its too hard to follow, and finally has to end by explaining a lot of the twist and turns. It's a lot more of a murder-mystery movie than an crime-action film. I still strongly recommend this movie, but if you are like me, you will probably have to watch it twice to pickup all the subtle details of the story.

The DVD quality is excellent overall, but some small specs of film deterioration could be seen once in a while during the course of the movie. It's not a perfect picture presentation, but near perfect. The only bonus features are commentary by film noir author Alan Silver and the original theater trailer.

GUN CRAZY

The story starts with a teenage boy named Bart who is obsessed with guns. He's so obsessed that he has to steal one and gets caught and goes to reform school for four years. After finishing school he does four years in the army as a shooting instructor and then finally comes back to his hometown and sees his old friends. Bart (adult character played by John Dall) then goes with his friends to a carnival and sees a shooting exhibition by an attractive young blonde woman named Annie Laurie Starr (Peggy Cummins). He beats her in a shooting contest and then joins the act. From that point on, it sets the stage for strange romance, plus some action and adventure with the gun-happy couple.

This DVD was one of five DVD released by Warner Brothers in the Film Noir Classics Collection Volume 1. Unlike the four others, the acting and script seemed second rate compared to the other four. The main character Bart, didn't seem very convincing in his role. Also, the movie has the feel of one of those teen explotation movies from the 1950's preaching the evils of firearm use rather than a dark, crime film. But overall, the movie is still very watchable and at times quite entertaining.

The DVD picture quality was terrific. It was very rare to see a spec of film deterioration anywhere in the movie. The sound was satisfactory. The only bonus is commentary by Glenn Erickson.

2062097,5,B000244F2S,"Probably the best video collection I've ever bought... These movies are just too cool!  I thought that ""The Set-Up"" was the weakest of the bunch, but not by much.  Maybe it's just that I hate the phony ""sport"" of boxing (thanks for your help with that, Don King, you pathetic pile of crap!), but I surely can't argue with the direction (Robert Wise), acting and the quality of the film.
  ""Murder My Sweet""  Dick Powell, in a major switch from sappy crooner, does an excellent job as Philip Marlowe.
  ""The Asphalt Jungle""  Almost perfect ""caper"" film, filmed with moody intensity by the legendary John Huston.
  ""Out of the Past""  The true gem of this collection.  Robert Mitchum pretty much oozes ""noir"", while Jane Greer is just plain HOT.
  ""Gun Crazy""  The most ""B"" movieish of the bunch, but what a fun flick!  The bank robbery scene is as memorable as they come.
  All in all, great films, great casts, great plots, noir at it's finest.  Kudos to the folks who issued this set.  Rumour has it that second collection is in the works.  Let's hope that they throw in ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Blue Dahlia"" on the next one.  As a final note, the commentaries are absolutely fascinating.  A truly worthwhile collection, I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase, baby.
2006 UPDATE:  I've watched all of these more than once, and my opinion of ""The Set-Up"" has changed drastically... this is a great film!  It gets better with subsequent viewings.  Now, I think that ""Murder My Sweet"" is probably the weakest in the collection, and it's still damned good.... Oh, and Don King is still an idiot.",1107388800,15,1599,4.661870503597123
2062098,5,B000244F2S,"This is easily the best noir box set available, and as one reviewer has already pointed out, is a fine introduction to the world of noir. I had not seen two of these films (Gun Crazy and The Set-Up) but was wonderfully surprised by both. Gun Crazy is a hugely energetic and inventive road movie that, in the way of story and direction, follows few conventions of the day. The Set-Up is a marvellous slow-boil of a story that has Robert Ryan in a career-best, subtle performance, and again is wonderfully inventive. The other three films are widely acknowledged classics. The dialogue of Murder, My Sweet has to be heard to be believed (Marlowe: ""My fingers looked like a bunch of bananas""), but Dick Powell pulls it off with aplomb. The Asphalt Jungle generates unbearable tension and boasts a gorgeous performance from Sterling Hayden, trapped in a noir net he cannot escape from. And Out of the Past? Well, there is no better noir! Mitchum can't help oozing cool from every pore and Jane Greer is a perfect psychotic femme. The photography will leave you breathless and the plot dizzy!

To top it off, there are commentary tracks on each DVD. To hear Robert Wise, the man himself (!), commenting (very charmingly) on his The Set-Up, is simply magical. Also, all of the transfers are terrific, better than anything previously available. So go on, just get it!",1095206400,35,1360,4.738396624472574
2062099,5,B000244F2S,"Don't even think  about not buying this set even if you had one or two individual copies as I had OUT OF THE PAST on VHS and two others on tape. If you know the films no need to read on. THE ASPHALT JUNGLE is one of Mr Huston's best films and he made many.  A thinking man's noir about the burden of some vice each man carries, loyalty between men and duty and deservedly considered a minor classic in the tragic mold. OUT OF THE PAST has ripper dialogue, wit, style, Mr Kirk Douglas looking like an ad out of Gentlemen's Quarterly and a plot convoluted enough to rival THE BIG SLEEP. GUN CRAZY is a cult classic. MURDER MY SWEET Dick Powell gets drugged, beaten up and double crossed.  THE SET UP superbly shot, wonderfully acted by Mr Robert Ryan, and directed by Robert Wise, is another film of tragic proportions and perhaps one of the best on the boxing game. Buy two

copies of this set so there are no disputes during the divorce settlement.

AN ABSOLUTE BARGAIN AND ESSENTIAL PURCHASE FOR FILM LOVERS.",1093392000,116,1009,4.374331550802139
2062100,4,B000244F2S,"If you like film noir, and who doesn't, this collection is worth the money.  Out of the Past is the classic film noir and the best picture Jane Greer ever made.  Previously the movie, which was filmed dark, suffered from a murky print which made some viewers not sure which woman Jane Greer is (at the opening), but now restored she shines like a steady lighthouse beam through the fog of the plot she's involved in up to her pretty little neck.

The Asphalt Jungle, one of Marilyn Monroe's greatest ""serious parts"" has never looked better.  It was filmed at the end of the noir cycle and shows the signs of a movie from a genre that has seen better days.  It is to true film noir what Webster's THE WHITE DEVIL is to Shakespeare, a decadent afterthought, and yet what a delightful one.

Then there is GUN CRAZY, featuring the kittenish UK actress Peggy Cummins in what might be her best part, although she also did great work opposite Dana Andrews in a later Tourneur.  GUN CRAZY, it is said, influenced Scorsese and Altman.  It looks like a film from the so called ""New American Cinema"" of the early 70s.

In the extras to THE SET UP, hooray, we hear the master director Robert Wise speak.  He is a great raconteur and seems to be able to remember everything.  He is a national treasure despite the hideous low quality of his later films like STAR and TWO PEOPLE.  This one is a winner, and you will be bouncing off the ropes as the plot and suspense deliver one jab after another.

Finally, there is MURDER MY SWEET with one of Americam's greatest actors DICK POWELL.  Often thought of as a sugary sweet tenor from all the Busby Berkeley films he did with Ruby Keeler for Warners in the 30, Powell matured after a terrible personal tragedy and became hard as steel in his later roles.  Even in a trifle like SUSAN SLEPT HERE Powell is tougher than anything, he makes John Wayne look like ZaSu Pitts (OK, not really).

2062101,5,B000244F2S,"Five excellent films.  Five excellent transfers, Five excellent commentaries.  Personally I bought this set for ""Asphalt Jungle"" and ""Gun Crazy"" (I'd seen ""Out Of The Past"" and ""Murder My Sweet"" some years ago, and wasn't impressed).  ""The Set Up"" was a curiosity.

I assumed (DVD Market being what it is) that this would be the usual Public Domain junk transfers mastered in someone's basement.  The reviews on Amazon convinced me to risk the dough anyway, and I'm happy that I did.

This is a great boxed set.  Any two of this series is worth the price -- five is a steal.

2062102,5,B000244F2S,"If you are a die-hard film noir fan like I am, this boxed set is a great collection of classics that you are sure to love. The Asphalt Jungle is one of the first and greatest heist movies to come out of Hollywood. The atmosphere is classic Noir, and the plot makes for some great climax moments toward the end. Gun Crazy was the weakest of the five, with poor dialogue, worse acting, and an ending that just makes you think quietly to yourself: oh, well. However, it is the forerunner to Bonnie and Clyde, so it isn't all bad. Despite the corny title, Murder, My Sweet is a teriffic example of a Philip Marlowe detective novel brought to life on the early Hollywood screen. Why no one makes this type of hard-boiled detective movie today is beyond me. The dialogue is superb thanks to the talents of Raymond Chandler and the delivery from Dick Powell as the private dick is just as good. I would have to say that Out of the Past is the best of the lot, for the simple fact that there will never be anyone who plays the hard-boiled role better than Robert Mitchum. A nearly flawless story, acting that was way ahead of its time, and great direction compliment every second of this film. The set up, though tedious at times, allows this set of movies to have a better variety. The fight sequences are a bit long, and the plot lacks any kind of emotional aspect that helps you feel better about the extremely short climax. Overall, the box set is a must have for those who like the classic detective or the dark and depressing films that contrasted some of the Hollywood fluff that came out of the period.

During WW II no American movies were exported to Europe. After the wars end these movies were then seen in France and elsewhere. In June 1942 the OPA created rules for rationing food, clothing, gasoline, tires, etc. One rule restricted the lighting used for movies (to save electricity) and to require the reuse of movie sets (to save on construction). The darker tones of these movies led to the term Film Noir (dark films) which also describes its subject matter. This term was coined by French critics to describe the atmosphere of these stories which showed that Crime Does Not Pay. The use of scheming evil females was one way to provide an unexpected twist to these stories (like The Murder of Roger Ackroyd) unlike earlier movies from the 1930s. These stories tell about the culture and attitudes of that era. For more details read the individual reviews.

The Asphalt Jungle (1950) is the story of a perfect crime. A skilled criminal assembles the best criminals available to burglarize a jewelry store. It works perfectly as planned, but the greed that created the crime also provides poetic justice for the criminals.

Gun Crazy (1949) is the story of two young criminals who go on a robbery spree. It is based on the real life crimes of Bonnie and Clyde, who murdered twelve men in their short and deadly career. Does fascination with guns and killing denote a criminal mind?

Murder, My Sweet (1944) is based on Raymond Chandler's novel Farewell, My Lovely. Private detective Philip Marlowe is hired to investigate gambling debts of a young heiress and to look into the disappearance of the husband of her older sister. A simple job reveals a murder.

Out of the Past (1949) tells about a former private detective who found a runaway girlfriend and became her friend. Jeff is hired for another job but wonders if it is a frame-up. Will he escape the trap? What will he learn about his girlfriend?

The Set Up (1949) is about an aging boxer who refused to throw a boxing match. There are consequences for not following orders. Is his career over? [Robert Ryan was a boxer in the US Marines.]",1426204800,,2140,4.739247311827957
