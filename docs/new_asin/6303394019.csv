637456,5,6303394019,I currently own this VHS version.  But I would buy the DVD in a heartbeat if it were available.  And of course wide screen please.  With commentary if possible.  This movie and Gigi are both among my favorites.,1141862400,4,210,4.447368421052632

It was a great time at the movies, and I remember the scope of the widescreen and all those Can-Can dancers. I hope that we will soon see a DVD with the fully restored format in Letterbox, With Ovature and Intermission etc. While not the best musical every filmed I remember it fondly and would like to see a DVD that presents this move as it should be seen.

637458,5,6303394019,"Shirley MacLaine and Frank Sinatra kick up their heels in CAN-CAN, the sparkling film adaptation of the Cole Porter musical comedy.

The setting is the Montmatre district of Paris, circa 1896.  The can-can dance has been ruled as immoral and scandalous by the polite society, but that doesn't stop Simone Pistache (Shirley MacLaine) from performing the routine at her cafe.  She is helped by her boyfriend--crooked lawyer Francois Durnais (Frank Sinatra).  Simone's happy existence comes crashing down when she's arrested on the orders of the new district judge, Philipe Forrestier (Louis Jourdan).

Francois decides that the best way for Simone to continue her activities is to seduce Philipe.  Pretty soon, Simone has well and truly fallen for his charms, but the hilarious love triangle has only just begun!...

This version of Cole Porter's 1953 Broadway musical is a very enjoyable, breezy viewing experience.  The costumes from Irene Sharaff are lavish, and the art direction is flawless.  MacLaine and Sinatra (continuing the screen partnership they had established with ""Some Came Running"") have a very fun rapport.  Maurice Chevalier and Louis Jourdan switch on their Gallic charm to maximum effect here.

The original Cole Porter tunestack was augmented with ""You Do Something to Me"", ""Let's Fall in Love"", and ""Just One of Those Things""; whilst several extra character numbers were deleted (""If You Loved Me Truly"", ""Allez-Vous-En"", ""Never Give Anything Away"").  The score was lushly arranged and conducted by Sinatra's frequent collaborator Nelson Riddle.

Choreography from Hermes Pan is full of colour and excitement.  MacLaine (with the help of a life-sized dummy) is thrown and throttled in a precision-drilled ""Apache Dance"", and leads the troupe in the ""Garden of Eden"" Ballet.  Juliet Prowse, as Claudine, offers a top performance, too.

TRIVIA: During her early Broadway days, Shirley MacLaine briefly considered applying for Gwen Verdon's understudy in ""Can-Can"".

The brand-new 2-disc DVD from Fox's ""Marquee Musicals"" series presents a beautifully-restored print, in complete Roadshow length with overture, intermission and exit music sequences.  Extra features on the second disc include ""A Leg Up: The Making of Can Can"" which delves into the history of the Broadway musical (and features some superb rare footage of Gwen Verdon from the original production).  ""The Classic Cole Porter"" offers a brief glimpse into the life of the celebrated composer.  ""Book by Burrows"" is a salute to CAN-CAN's original author Abe Burrows with reminisces from his children.

The ""Restoration Comparison"" allows to you see the new DVD master with the earlier 1993 video/laserdisc release-print, and it's quite evident that the good people at Fox have gone above and beyond to restore CAN-CAN to it's original brilliance.  There are also some still galleries plus the trailer.  In addition, Fox has packaged a set of four postcard-sized lobbycards in the DVD case!

The new edition of CAN-CAN is a must for all fans of the classic musicals.",967248000,45,3048,5.355042016806722

637678,5,6303394019,"Somehow I missed this movie in my youth.  I ordered it to accompany Barbie CanCan dolls.  I wanted something that would show the real cancan without all the history of the Moulin Rouge.  This film was a comedic love story and managed to get the background of all the folderol that went along with the popularity of the dance and it's legal challenges without being too heavy.  The kids liked the music and the dance and were only mildly entertained by Sinatra and McLane, but I really enjoyed all of the film.  Takes you back to another time and place.  Difficult to believe that folks could get so upset about women showing their undergarments when you think of what they show today.

But the kids did think the dance was really fun and went to the dressup box for skirts and lots of petty coats. The idea that a dance could be against the law was beyond their comphrehension.  From there the talk went to denominational regilions and what they allow and forbid.  It's been a fun summer with the young girls",1411257600,,1008,4.4945054945054945

637680,3,6303394019,"I loved this when I first saw it way back in Todd-AO, which was a fabulous process, but re watching it now, I'm not so sure. The plus is the songs which are wonderful, and the ones they dropped from the original score were among Cole Porter's worst. The main problem is the two stars, who are about as French as a couple of over cheesed hamburgers. And why has Shirley McLaine taken over the lead in the big dance numbers that in the original were danced by the character played by Juliette Prowse? She was certainly a much better dancer. But in the same role of Broadway Gwen Verdon was even better. It's just okay, but it all looks a bit cheap, and when we finally get to the big can-can routine at the end, it's dead dreary. The orchestrations are great, but why on earth they cast two of the most American of American performer's in the leads in beyond me. Bums on seats I guess. Leslie Caron and Louis Jourdan in those roles might have been better. They had great charisma together in Gigi, so maybe this would have worked better with them?",1407369600,,1045,4.336734693877551

As for me, I remain riveted to the TV screen from the first scene of this classic film to the breathtaking can-can scene at the very end.
I highly recommend this movie!",1390089600,,446,4.779220779220779
637736,4,6303394019,"Strangely absent from the tribute to Shirley MacLaine in the recent Kennedy Center Honors was any reference to Can-Can, one of her few musicals, adapted from Cole Porter's stage success.  What a shame that this triple-threat (singer/dancer/actress) wasn't given more films in which to show off all that she could do as a performer. Though Sweet Charity is an even better example of MacLaine as a musical comedy star, Can-Can is a more-than-adequate showcase for her talents. Here she plays Simone Pistache, proprietor of a Parisian dance hall in the 1890s, where that ""lewd and lascivious"" dance, the can-can, is performed nightly, except when the local police haven't been paid off and choose to make an uninvited appearance in order to raid the joint.

Quite rightly given her talents, Pistache also performs as a dancer in her own establishment, and MacLaine does some of her most impressive work performing  Hermes Pan's choreography for the Appache Dance, the Adam and Eve Ballet, and the title number (along with another outstanding dancer, Juliet Prowse).  With a singing voice more charming than stirring, Shirley is not called upon to sing some of her character's more emotive songs in the score, which in the transfer from stage to screen were either eliminated (""Allez-vous-en"") or reduced to dance music deprived of their lyrics (the title song).

As far as the vocals go, MacLaine's co-stars were given the prize plums, and since Frank Sinatra, a movie star as well as a world-class vocalist, got top billing, it's obvious why he was given the choicest cuts, musically speaking; second tier stars Louis Jourdain and Maurice Chevalier also get a chance to display their singing ability to fine effect.  As Pistache's lawyer, Sinatra plays off his Ring-A-Ding-Ding rat-pack image, and is no more believable as a man of the law than he is as a Frenchman, but presumably his fans don't care as long as he gets to perform as only Ol' Blues Eyes can on screen.  Jourdain and Chevalier, charming if slightly underutilized, at least remind us what Frenchmen sound like, and give the film, which nominally takes place in Montmartre, what little Parisian authenticity it has.

Ultimately, however, for many of us this is Shirley's show and she does an outstanding job with it, by turns charming and playful, wistful and romantic, and, best of all, dancing like nobody else can or could. Fine as her screen work has been, if she'd been given several other musicals to perform in which were least as good as Can-Can, she might have proven herself to be even more accomplished than is generally supposed.",1389830400,,2604,4.970114942528736

637784,4,6303394019,"Can Can does not contain the charm and reality of Gigi, but Cole Porter's songs are the very best in musical theater. They are worth watching and listening to if nothing else. But the dancing is also superb. There is only one small let down in this show. The Can Can itself. I don't know who wrote the music, probably Cole Porter himself, but it was missing an essential ingredient - Offenbach's score from Gaite Parisienne. Whenever I visualize or think of the Can Can, I see and hear Offenbach. As skillful and well choreographed as the dancing in the Can Can was, it was not Offenbach and not the genuine Can Can. And it is the title piece. A substitute did not do.",1373846400,,668,4.395161290322581

It's 1890s Montmartre via the 20th Century Fox backlot with fairly little concession of being ""French"". Certainly not in the casting. While Maurice Chevalier and Louis Jourdan (fresh off of GIGI) lend authenticity, Frank Sinatra doesn't even try to alter his ""ring a ding ding"" persona and Shirley MacLaine may as well be straight off a Virginia farm. Still, if you can suspend your disbelief, it's quite a colorful and splashy entertainment. The Porter tunes are hummable, Hermes Pan's choreography high kicking, Irene Sharaff's costumes eye popping and it's all risible fun. The leggy Juliet Prowse and Marcel Dalio co-star.

That sub plot was very funny, and I remember it to this day although I saw the show in 1953.  This version had way too much talking and not enough music.  I like Cole Porter, but preferred to have the CAN CAN songs in CAN CAN.  If you like Frank Sinatra a lot, you might enjoy this.  If you like Louis Jordan and Maurice Chevalier, get GIGI.

I remember vaguely enjoying it in the sixties in Salisbury, Rhodesia on a big screen. Looking at Sinatra's performance today ,I am amazed that he delivered such a lackluster two-dimensional portrayal. He walked through the movie.  He looked completely bored. Shirley Maclaine screeched her way like a cat on a hot tin roof. I'm amazed that people could be paid for delivering such dreary performances. Juliet Prowse danced like a star.

637885,4,6303394019,"When then-Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev visited the U.S. in 1959, he made a storied visit to Hollywood where he almost started a minor international incident when he wanted to visit Disneyland but was waved off for security reasons.  He was also invited to visit the set of ""Can-Can"", then in filming, and he and his delegation were seated to view one of the movie's big set pieces with the can-can dancers.  He reacted _exactly_ like the bluenoses in the movie. :) According to him, Shirley MacLaine and her can-can girls were a perfect example of Western decadence.  One only wonders what he would have made of ""Girls Gone Wild"".

Be that as it may, this is a movie I've been waiting a very long time to see - I've never been able to find it on VHS.  I'm not an especial fan of Shirley MacLaine, to be candid (which is why I give this movie ""only"" 4 stars), but that wariness really applies more to her New Age kookiness in the 1980's and later; in the 1950's, she was a young, sprightly, cute, sexy redhead with great legs.  She's not half bad in the role of the cabaret owner who fights two comic battles; to save the can-can and to get the skittish Frank Sinatra to put a ring on her finger.  Sinatra, Louis Jourdan and Maurice Chevalier, the movie's three male leads, are also very good, and the film is full of gorgeous set-pieces, including (of course!) several can-can sequences full of whirling petticoats and royal flashes.

The pictures on the DVD are nice and crisp and a pleasure to watch. It is nice to See that the DVD is in the original Todd AO format of 2.2:1 as seen in the Cinema.

637888,5,6303394019,"It took ten long years, but the wait is over!

""Can-Can"" is certainly not very high on the list among the best film adaptations of Broadway musicals, but it contains lots of character charm and professional know-how, boasts a lushly orchestrated score, and is gorgeously designed in often daring color combinations. (For the stylish looking palette and fine-tuned overall detail of this film, I suspect we must thank not only the famous production designers and Ms. Sharaff's oddly chic costumes, but also very much styling consultant Tony Duquette and color consultant Leonard Doss.)

The first thing you see on your screen is a ""warning"" from Fox that they have used the best materials available for their transfer to DVD. This had me greatly worried for a couple of seconds, but when the credits came up on my screen I was both relieved and stunned. It looked super! Never had I seen ""Can-Can"" with colors as clean, bright and beautiful as on this disc! But some three minutes into the film I suddenly understood what Fox meant with their note: In many shots throughout the complete running-time, I could notice a certain discreet light-flickering that affected the colors somewhat, especially easy to spot in the darker areas of the image. This is, of course, distracting (at least for a while untill you get used to it), but I should think that Fox had found this problem impossible to correct completely. To my great relief and joy, it is quite obvious that the materials used for this DVD transfer originates from a 70mm negative in Technicolor. All previous transfers to VHS and LaserDisc must surely have used 35mm film in DeLuxe color. The difference is amazing, as the DVD has superb contrast, splendid color and a razor-sharp image all the way, which only 70mm film stock can produce. I suspect that when Fox had to decide between issuing a decent but dull 35mm (CinemaScope) transfer or a dazzling (but very lightly damaged) transfer from Todd-AO elements, they went for the later option. A good choice! Actually, the problematic shots are often very brief, and are mostly followed by longer shots or whole scenes that look picture-perfect. Even well kept negatives can unfortunately detoriate a little  with age, and some of the problems that occur can apparently not be 100 percent erased even in our age of digital high tech.

Disc 2 has some well made, newly produced featurettes and lots of other goodies, but even though many highly well researched people are talking ""Can-Can"" history and memories, none are able to solve a mystery that has often kept me wide awake at nights for 47 years: Why was the most applauded and beloved song from the stage show not included in the finished film version; only heard during the credits and in the Entr'acte? I'm thinking of ""I Love Paris""! Film historian Scott McIsaac incorrectly tells us that it is sung in the film by Sinatra and Chevalier. Not so! It is sung by these two gentlemen ONLY on the soundtrack album issued at the time of the film's release - and available on CD for a short time many years ago. But was it actually FILMED, and if so, was it cut out early or after maybe some not entirely happy preview? Can anyone out there explain this weird omission, or better, once and for all present all the facts concerning the rejection of this lovely Cole Porter evergreen?",1179100800,28,3342,4.77681660899654
637889,2,6303394019,"It even copies ""Gigi""'s titles with Toulouse Lautrec-looking paintings. Frank Sinatra is absolutely wrong for the era--he even says ""ring-a-ding-ding"" in the Belle Epoch. Shirley Maclaine is scintillating and Chevalier is lost. Hollywood had to take the Broadway show which wasn't very good and put all the glitters on little puff of a musical.

The arrangements are so sixties it could be a Sinatra solo album. They interpolated Cole Porter songs that just don't make it like ""Let's Do It.""

The ""I Love Paris"" ballet is one of the classic dances of the screen, surpassed in my opinion only by Astaire-Rogers in Top Hat, the final ballet in American in Paris, John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever & Patrick Swayze in Dirty Dancing.

Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

What does an old musical set in France need? Maurice Chevalier and Louis Jourdan, of course! And since theres also singing and a cute dancer who likes showing off her legs, what else does it need? Frank Sinatra and Shirley MacLaine! Can-Can has Shirley, both French charmers, and Ol Blue Eyes.

Set in the 1800s, when the can-can dance was forbidden in France because it was too risqu, Shirley MacLaine decides to buck the system and allows her and her nightclub dancers show off their legs. Lots of dancing from choreographer Hermes Pan, lots of pretty costumes, lots of Cole Porter songs, and a love triangle that will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time, Can-Can is definitely one to see if you like old musicals. Ive seen them all, and while this one doesnt make it to the top shelf in my collection, Im glad I saw it. Many famous songs come from this movie, including I Love Paris, Lets Do It, Just One of Those Things, and Its All Right With Me, so if you like any of those, rent it during your next musical-fest weekend.",1498435200,,1092,4.4278606965174125
