2750308,5,B000MV8JGO,"""Jesus, The Word Became Flesh"" is one of ten in The Footprints of God series created by Stephen Ray.  Seven are available at this time, and the series is scheduled to be completed in 2010.  Each of these DVD's is exciting and informative.

This DVD takes you through the life of Jesus.  What a blessing to feel like you are actually visiting the places where Jesus walked.  Many of us will never be able to visit the Holy Land and I thank Stephen Ray for taking us on an incredible journey.

Walk along the Jordan River, see the land where Jesus lived and taught.  Go with him to Jerusalem and walk the Way of the Cross.  Visit the many beautiful churches built on the holy places like the Transfiguration, Ascension, Birth of Jesus and more.

I learned a lot watching this documentary and the others in the series, and I plan on viewing them a second time to really soak in everything.  There is so much information, and they make scripture come alive!  Hearing the readings at Mass I feel I now better understand what is being read.",1198800000,19,1034,4.446808510638298

8172856,5,B000MV8JGO,"Steve Ray takes us on a real biblical adventure in this centerpiece film in his award-winning Footprints of God series. With his effective storytelling and ""Jerusalem Jones"" persona, Ray literally walks us through the places and stories in the life of Christ.

The stunning cinematography and ""man on the street"" narration brings the New Testament stories to life. From the youngest children to the most devout adult, everyone will find much to enjoy in this film. It's a great combination of documentary and travelogue adventure. With humor and great passion, Ray's enthusiasm for the greatest story ever told will give you new appreciation for your faith. I highly recommend all of Ray's Footprints of God films. Jesus: The Word Became Flesh is a great place to start your own bible adventure.
