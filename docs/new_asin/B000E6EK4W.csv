This movie has achieved that goal. The only drawback is that you have to put out of your mind is that she only imagined having sex with the beast, for I have found that the true road to maximum arousal is by violating the sexual restrictions our society has imposed on us. The first time I watched it I missed the fact that she only imagined it and I reacted as if I were a teenager again. I think the only reason Borowczyk had her only imagine it was to alleviate, somewhat, the public outcry due to the film involving such a taboo subject. However, I believe most critics overlooked the fact that she imagined it, as I did initially, because it was banned for years. Would love to find more like this one.",1504742400,3,990,4.356756756756757

8106554,5,B000E6EK4W,"There were three movies in the box, The first was ""The Beast"", which was the greatest movie I ever seen long time ago. What a great story, and perfect acting and the picture, the sound, the colors, the locations, everything was just perfect including the nudity, and the sexploitation parts. It is a wonderful movie and worth what I paid for, and I am sure lots of buyers will enjoy it as much as I did. Also it is perfect to turn on females and males. so you can watch it with your girl friend or boyfriend. But for the other movie 'Island of love""  was very strange, and worth watching, but I consider it a great movie regardless the year it was made, And for the third movie "" Love rites"" it is one of the new age movies,and it needs lots of concentration to understand it, and it has some nudity and sexuality. but the story was the main interest,and the end was just a shocking. Finally I think I got a bargain for what I paid for these three movies. and about the first movie ""The Beast"" it is worth buying and showing it to all friends proudly that you have a copy of a great movie like this.",1398902400,7,1099,4.183962264150943
8106555,4,B000E6EK4W,"Walerian borowczyk is a terribly misunderstood filmmaker primarily because of the way he uses sex in his movies, but this stuff is truly high art. i'm not going to go into too much depth here, but just touch on some high points. early in his career (with films like goto and his well received animations) he was an arthouse darling, but as he delved more into sexual themes the arthouse goons branded him a pornographer and he was kind of relegated to cult obscurity. but all the better for us cult fans!

goto is (i believe) his first feature. it's somewhat straightforward but it does hint at the depths of surrealism and modern life that he explores in later films.

the beast is a legend and is a fully realized surrealist film. it is primarily about the battle between modern and traditional, and the film covers this topic delightfully. my favorite sequence is probably them running around the house after the death of the main character (i cant remember his name). this is likely the most absurd sequence of the film and reminds me a lot of bunuel at around the same time (mid 70s).

my favorite of the 3 films included in this collection is the bizare and somewhat horrifying love rites. there are several sequences in this film that are just to die for: the conversation across the subway tunnel, the long walk to the apartment (particularly the long shot in the alley as the characters walk farther and farther away), etc. it becomes blatantly bizarre post coitum and does not let up from there. the ending is one that i will never forget and left me kind of uncomfortable, but in the good, thoughtful sort of way.

im definitely pleased with this collection and would recommend to all sorts from genre fans to the arthouse to people who are just looking for something different. enjoy!",1159833600,27,1796,4.638364779874214
