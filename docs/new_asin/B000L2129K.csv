8159906,4,B000L2129K,"Hard Times is not that well known. This is a well done British version and must be viewed realizing it in the context of the year produced 1977.  Well worth the viewing. Viewed with Amazon Prime Video.  Well done  Mr.  T. West et al.  I always enjoy the old  British versions of the classics. I am one for the period dramas. Charles Dickens gives the darker side of the often romanized Victorian era. It is Hard Times reading and viewing the conflicts of the laborers, poor and the merchants and the ruling rich.",1524960000,,512,4.451612903225806
8159907,1,B000L2129K,"Filmed in color in 1977. This movie moves way too slow for this sort of story. The Victorian film ""Emma"" moves slow, but there is the interest of the large manor houses, beautiful gardens, interesting costumes and lady's hairstyles, fun dancing, and a good story of Emma trifling in matchmaking. In this film, ""Hard Times"", all the characters are dull and there is nothing else of interest to look at. I paid $17, which includes shipping, which is way too much for a disappointing film, which I will donate to the library. Victorian films I did like are: ""Under the Greenwood Tree"", ""Emma"", ""North & South"", ""Pride & Prejudice"", ""Wives & Daughters"", ""Nicholas Nickleby"", ""PollyAnna"", ""Oliver Twist"", ""David Copperfield"", ""Silas Marner"", ""Old Curiosity Shop 1995 with Peter Ustinov"", ""Middlemarch"", and ""Great Expectations-1946"".",1497657600,,828,5.28030303030303
8159908,5,B000L2129K,"Perhaps Dickens' weakest novel, with one of his strongest themes, is very well done, superior to the movie made a couple decades later.  The circus folk outshine the cream of society in their humanity.  Dickens never forgot where he came from and he could sympathize with those of humbler origins.",1469923200,,297,4.92
8159909,4,B000L2129K,"Best video version of this lesser known Dickens life crisis allegory.

Harder heads than even in those days and heart breaks for some that deserved it and some who did not.",1394496000,,172,4.548387096774194
8159910,5,B000L2129K,"This movie saved my bacon a few weeks ago. I had a major book report on the book Hard Times as well as a test and without even reading the 1st page I got a 100 on the test :) Mind you I also had sparknotes handy and coupled together I was invincible. Definetley reccomend it but don't fool yourself into thinking the movie alone will help you pass, just have summaries available to fill in the missing stuff (although it isn't much). Its kinda captivating as well, gradgrinds sideburns are epic.",1331769600,5,495,4.391304347826087
8159911,5,B000L2129K,"This is an excellent TV version of Dickens' novel.  The actors portraying Gradgrind and Bounderby showed their respective fact-stressing and insensitive natures very well. Louisa was well shown as a woman whose feelings had been kept inside all of her life. There is also the gloom of Coketown, an atmosphere impossible for its citizens to escape from.  This adaptation is very close to the book and there are no great departures from the original story.  There is another version of Hard Times available (which I have not seen) that had some poor reviews, so I chose to purchase this one instead.  Surprisingly, this one was not included in any other Dickens DVD collection, but it is available separately here.  If you love Dickens, this is well worth getting since it's one of the best miniseries  created.  There's not much technology since the series was made back in 1977 on a limited budget, but in the viewing experience  there's a great story brought to the screen with some wonderful drama.",1218067200,12,1000,4.875739644970414
8159912,4,B000L2129K,"This unrelentingly gritty version of Dicken's novel does full justice to the book's tone
and the characters. I was especially impressed with Timothy West's performance as
the self-centered and blustery Bounderby. Jacqueline Tong (Daisy from Upstairs Downstairs)
also does a very good job playing the repressed Louisa. Less successful, though, are
Edward Fox as Harthouse (he gets the ennui right, but his passions are not convincing)
and Patrick Allen (the transition from grim authoritarian to loving father doesn't work).
Other minor characters (Tom, Rachel, and Stephen) do a fine job with their relatively
underdeveloped parts. Rosalie Crutchley makes the most of the thankless Mrs. Sparsit
role, but I would have liked to see her shaking her hand at Bounderby's portrait more
than once.

I was especially impressed with the look and feel of in this film. It
seems always to be winter in Coketown, never summer. The sky is always gray,
the air smoky, and the streets filthy. Factory workers wear patched and fraying
clothes and even the dresses worn by the wealthy folk are drab; the furnishings
are far from sumptuous and the vehicles looks worn as well. In short, the sets
and props are perfectly matched to Dickens' tone.

What a shame that the scriptwriters left out some of the irony in the book.
I was looking forward to Bounderby's humiliation when his mother is revealed
to be alive and loving! Ah well, something always has to go when Dickens
is adapted to the screen.

This film was made 30 years ago, and it has held up quite well. I recommend
it heartily to Dickens fans.",1186704000,30,1587,4.914179104477612
