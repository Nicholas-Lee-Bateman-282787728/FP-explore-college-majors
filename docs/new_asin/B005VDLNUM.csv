8487418,4,B005VDLNUM,For me Stuart Damon makes it well worth watching and he is really good in this series.  The format is a bit different than I'm used to perhaps because it - the show was produced in England; also it is from the 1960's.  Some of the language is not appropriate for today and really never was but the idea of the sitcom is clever.  I probably won't watch it often because it tends to be offensive but I still enjoy most of it.  If you like British comedy and can look past some of the remarks then you'll enjoy this.,1389744000,,513,4.1
