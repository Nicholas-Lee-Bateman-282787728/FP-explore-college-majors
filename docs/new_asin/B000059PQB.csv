1408407,5,B000059PQB,"It took this movie several years to find a distributor in the U.S., which is one of the reasons so few people have had the pleasure of seeing it.  While it has been noted that the plot tends to be slow in unravelling, this can be entirely forgiven, as you become completely immersed in the world that this film creates.  It deals with man's need to control nature and the craving of the spirit to be free.
Meener Chrome (Ewan McGregor) has been hired by a wealthy (and vain) land-owner named Smithers (Pete Postlewaite) and his wife Julianna (Greta Scacchi) to design a garden from the wilderness outside their inherited estate.  As the family attempts to convert this field into a model of order, they are also trying to tame their daughter Thea (also called Anne), whose wild spirit is being crushed in this world of obedience and rigidity.  It is only later that we learn that ""Meener Chrome"" is in the pay of Julianna's cousin, Fitzmaurice (Richard E. Grant).  Almost mad with jealousy that Julianna has married another, Fiztmaurice intends to use Smither's vainity against him and financially ruin him through this elaborate garden and drive Julianna back into his arms.
While Chrome tries to bring order to the world around him, the world inside Smither's home begins to spin out of control.  Julianna becomes captivated with Chrome, who in turn has completely fallen in love with Thea.  Against the orders of her 'physicians' and her parents, Chrome attempts to bring some calm into Thea's life and offer her freedom from the world that is driving her to madness.  Fitzmaurice, insensed that Chrome would pull out of the bargain rather than hurt Thea, and with Julianna's infatuation with him, descends deeper into his own insanity, which proves to be his destruction.  Eventually, Chrome rescues Thea and find their own happiness, while Smithers and his wife must try to begin again, with nothing left but their garden.
This film is visually stunning, as we see this wild landscape transformed to a vision of late 17th century order and beauty, and later destroyed by a windstorm.  The costumes and settings lend an almost surreal touch to this story that plays almost like a fairytale.  To watch it once is not enough.  McGregor's accent seems very half-hearted and sporadic, but in re-visiting the scenes, one can see 'Chrome's' true identity in his intentional misuse of his accents.  The film is mainly a character driven, psychological story that is not for those looking for quick entertainment.  Though the plot does tend to be a bit slow, the intense subtlety and power of the final scenes more than compensate.  If you wish to lose yourself in a world of beauty and intruigue, The Serpent's Kiss might very well be a dream come true.",1044403200,7,2750,4.833688699360341
1408408,3,B000059PQB,"It seems that our fine Mr. McGregor has a terrible propensity for duplicity. One minute he's starring in big-budget Hollywood productions (Moulin Rouge/ Star Wars), the next he appears in little unknown art house films such as The Serpent's Kiss, which no one saw along with Nora and failed terribly at the box office.
  As far as The Serpent's Kiss is concerned, I wish more people knew about this film. Not only is it well acted by a well assembled all-star cast (such notables as Greta Scacchi, Pete Postlethwaite, and Richard E. Grant), but is beautifully photographed and the plot is sure to thrill you - if you can sit still long enough to pay attention.
  I almost gave up on this film solely due to the irritating nature of Ewan's poor Dutch accent, but as the film continued I was relieved to discover that the accent was supposed to be that way due to the nature of the character (believe me, I was very relieved - for a while there I thought Ewan was getting lazy and had stopped trying).
  This film also manages to make gardening seem interesting - and erotic even, as the sexual tension between a few of the characters thickens very, very quickly.
  The DVD sadly is disappointing as there are no behind-the-scenes special features which is what I half bought the thing for. So you are buying the CD for the movie alone.
  This film is entertaining and beautiful, and Ewan is just gorgeous in it, but not his best work.",1030147200,35,1433,4.5408560311284045
1408409,5,B000059PQB,"Comparisons to Greenaway are misleading. It gets compared to him mostly because of one film (Draughtman's Contract, Greenaway's best if you ask me) and one fine actor (Ewan McGregor, who starred in another Greenaway film, the Pillow Book).
The characters are deeper and more human in this film, rather than simply representing ideas in some sort of post-modern satire. The acting is all around excellent. I can't think of a single performance that wasn't above average to astounding. To discuss the film's plot in detail is to risk giving too much away, as this is a film where there is a lot of surprise and mystery about the main character, Minier Chrome (Ewan McGregor) and his increasingly complex relationship with the Smithers family, for whom he is building a splendid baroque garden.
A better 'genre' comparison might be Robert Downey Jr. and Meg Ryan film set in almost the same time period, Restoration (just a bit before). However that film moved around a lot and centered on a wildly uneven character, and in this one, no characters truly dominate (though the actor who plays Fitz steals every scene he is in), and we hardly ever leave the estate where the garden is being built (an English estate, but filmed in Ireland, where apparently the countryside is far more intact).",1024012800,18,1287,4.8812785388127855
1408410,5,B000059PQB,"I have recently seen the film Serpeant's Kiss, and found it to be a true work of art. Ewan Magregor is sensational as a held back artist and deciever of minds. When I saw the previous reviews for this spectacular film I was astonished. I highly encourage you to see and buy this masterpiece the sights and sounds will truly touch your hearts and minds.",1023580800,6,352,4.430769230769231
1408411,4,B000059PQB,"Experiencing ""The Serpent's Kiss"" benefits from a re-reading of Andrew Marvell's poetry, the volume that figures so strongly in the film. Characters' lines, at times direct quotes, derive from ""The Garden,"" ""Holland,"" ""Bermudas,"" ""To His Coy Mistress,"" ""The Reaper"" and others. The characters, in costume, actions, motives and speech, enact the dualities that Marvell explores: Nature versus artifice, eros versus reason, the present versus posterity, humility versus vanity, love versus materialism.
The cinematography, production design and costumes recreate the world of Vermeer, Van Dyke and other 17th century Dutch painters. The film's visual aspects are emblematic of (and sometimes in contrast to) the spirit of late 17th century Northern Europe, especially Holland, England and Ireland, and reward symbolic readings of color, light, and composition.
The script makes fascinating use of imagery, involving flowers, water, industry and agriculture, darkness and light, which enriches the narrative when traced. Consider the use of brambles, the scent of flowers, their exotic versions from the ""dark side of the world"", tobacco and ""medicinal"" herbs. In effect, the film asks What is and where is the real garden? Who is barren and who is fertile, physically and spiritually?
Although somewhat simplistic and awkward in execution and with some uncomfortable anachronisms in the script (not ""f***"" by the way, which has been around a long time), this is a thoughtful, delicately humorous film, well-acted and produced with unusual commitment and deep feeling there within the esthetic feast. In any event, filmed poems are rare.
[Looking into the Glorious Revolution of 1689 when William and Mary became Britain's rulers, seeing pictures of their garden at Het Loo, so similar to Chrome's design, and researching details of Marvell's life reveals the filmmakers' attempt to ground this film in time, place and experience).",1000166400,29,1928,5.583617747440273
1408412,3,B000059PQB,"It helped to read a review of the movie before I watched it, otherwise I would not have understood the premise of the movie as you are almost finished watching before you realize why things are being done the way they are.  Orignially watched this movie to see Pete Postelwaite and Ewan McGregor (Love them both) but was carried away by Richard Grant. I really enjoyed his character, and the portrayals by all of the actors were very well done.  The movie itself is a little on the slow moving side. Does not require an R rating-Have seen PG movies with far worse language than this movie, and there is no nudity or graphic violence. I guess one F*** reduces you to an R...All in all, not a bad rental, or if you are a big fan of any of the actors, it is worth owning just for the wonderful acting.",996105600,9,798,4.2781456953642385
1408413,2,B000059PQB,"I own both the DVD and VCR of Serpent's Kiss, the long awaited film by Philippe Rousselot. While I am a fan of Ewan McGregor's work, of costume drama, and small obscure films in general, I can not recommend it.  While a visually attractive film largely due to Rousselot, a DP of merit in other work, this production is less than stellar.  McGregor, in 18th c. wig is wasted in the title role of Meneer Chrome, a landscape architect of considerable renown hired to create a monumental garden for a status conscious couple played by Pete Postlethwaite and Greta Sacchi.  In an over the top Snidley Whiplash role is Richard E. Grant, the cousin of Sacchi's character come to ruin the marriage of his lost lover.  Rambling through the scenery is Carmen Chaplin, a fey but boring beauty whose presence irritates her mother, fasinates McGregor, and upsets the servants.  The story never achieves the desired momentum despite its superior cast, costumes, and suspense-filled twists, but all in all, it's a dud.  Not recommended unless a collector of maudlin films by important British actors before they were famous.",991526400,13,1109,4.903743315508021
1408414,5,B000059PQB,"I thought Ewan's performance in The Serpent's Kiss was one of his finest ever. I have seen all of his movies, and he still amazes me every time with the depth of his talent. I found it to be a beautiful, sensual film. His scenes with Carmen Chaplin, who plays his love interest, were very romantic and moving. It is very refreshing today to see a film without all the violence, profanity, and explicit sex scenes. I also enjoyed knowing it was filmed in Ireland, because I have visited that beautiful country. Other co-stars include Pete Postlethwaite, Greta Scacchi, and Richard Grant. I waited a long time to see this film, and it was definitely worth the wait.",988416000,28,663,4.627118644067797

1408479,5,B000059PQB,"I saw this movie on late night tv recently for the first time. The poetry in the opening immediately grabbed me. Then enters Meneer Chrome, ooohh, so incredibly handsome. I know I got to have the DVD. I never had a movie library, just a few dance DVDs. This is the first movie ever I'm compelled to buy. On the surface, it's chick flick at its finest, thanks to the racy good looks of Ewan McGregor and his brilliant acting. It's a sexy little movie sans sex scenes.

Next I found myself watching it twice in 2 days. It feels like I'm viewing a painting...and you want to see it again. Variety magazine pointed out in their review that the literary aspect of the movie is partly to blame for the lack of mass distribution. Perhaps there should've been a few pony chase scenes, but I much prefer idyllic images and old fashioned flirtations and a world of sensual symbolisms...

The reviews here from other viewers offer superb analysis of the literary elements found throughout the movie. In a nutshell, the movie is built on opposites: the bitter tension, or coming together to form something bigger. Like Meneer and Thea, a marriage made in heaven...

The word ""heaven"" came out unintentionally but just as well -- I can't help but think of Garden of Eden...the snake...the ""forbidden fruit"" Fitzmaurice cautioned Meneer to stay away from ... Am I reading too much into it?  Probably...

Meneer's character evolves over the course of the movie -- from the worldly architect with a hidden agenda, to Juliana's boy-toy in her fantasy as well as ""parlor games"", to who he really is under the disguise -- an innocent little boy, eyes closed, lying on the beach while Thea strokes his hair...

What seems to be lacking is Meneer's feeling for Thea. He cares about her, but the movie didn't show he's secretly in love with her.  Despite that, I find the movie very engaging and I definitely recommend it.

(Some viewers might be concerned about Thomas and Juliana left with nothing but each other. No worries, the evil cousin can't take the gold coins with him, so the fortune (minus the portion now with the young lovers) will remain in Smithers' estate. They should do okay.)",1196812800,3,2173,4.670157068062827
1408480,3,B000059PQB,"The kiss of the serpent is rather a confusing film. Plots, people and ideas come and go such as Tara being a witch or not, the whole deal with the poisen, and even the background on Chrome seemed to me to be rather hazy and obscure. I love Ewan Mcgregor, but even he couldn't completely save this film. He lacked the enthusiasm that you see in such films like Down with Love or Big Fish. And Richard E. Grant, while being a very convincing villian, doesn't quite make us either fear or hate him as we are tend to be rather lukewarm towards him anyhow, so the evil character Fitzmaurice falls upon dead ears and becomes less then he should have been. I'm afraid the romance plot could have been better, but again, I've seen better. The whole desire/passion/obsession thing didn't quite work out and in turn makes the movie rather mundane. I think the only thing that made me interested was seeing how the garden turned out. Ewan showed more Passion towards his vegitation then Tara, and he only got properly excited when talking about his gardens.

However don't get me wrong, this isn't a completely wasted movie, and the five or so dollars I spent on it wasn't too much of a loss. But if you are on a budget, or rather unsure of this movie I'd suggest renting it from a friend, or waiting until your finances to improve. Then you might not regret the movie so much.",1155427200,2,1366,4.442231075697211

The plot is obvious, the sets cheap and flimsy, the language never convincing, and the dreadful, tedious, and completely uninteresting Carmen Chaplin makes a overwhelmingly telegraphed romance not only unbelievable but implausible.
Nice costumes, but this is a lame film, never really addressing its ""theme"" and containing all sorts of mysterious and silly developments that are never utilized. Maybe it would have been good if they left all the missing stuff in, but for a boring movie it sure felt rushed.

If you have slightly more patience than the average MTV-raised 15-25 yr. old you will be richly rewarded by watching this film.

It's plot, however, keeps pace with nature - most of the time developing at a glacial pace - with only brief moments of faster development.

Similar to a tree, without leaves after the winter, the movie starts out in a worn down environment, holding promises of an interesting future to come.  Like twigs growing buds, the initial characters are setup and are slowly developing, reminiscent of growing leaves.  A brief blossom displays a certain type of beauty, only to be eradicated by the forces of nature.

Eventually echoes of autumn settle in, with some of the protagonists falling like autumn leaves. Yet, on the other hand, new shades and colors reveal themselves in and for the remaining protagonists during this time of re-evaluation of their values; ultimately leading to a much more harmonious existence.",1050883200,4,965,4.968944099378882
