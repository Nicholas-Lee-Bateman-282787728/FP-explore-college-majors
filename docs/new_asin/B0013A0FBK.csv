3102644,5,B0013A0FBK,There are 18 excellent exercises and each is well explained and demonstrated.  I highly recommend this video if you want to tone up and maintain facial muscles.,1242518400,10,160,4.925925925925926
3102645,5,B0013A0FBK,"I'm an extreme skeptic.  I just turned 43, and I've always looked younger than my age, but recently, I have started noticing that my naso-labial folds (from nose to corners of mouth)and those ""elevens"" (the furrow between my brows from frowning and studying too much) were getting deeper.

I was looking on amazon for some look younger books/dvds, and what I started noticing is that there are a LOT of bogus reviews out there!

One author/publisher in particular (Carole Maggio's Facercise, ESPECIALLY) had a whole lot of 5 star reviews written by people whom had only ever just reviewed her book.  The one star reviews were all written by people like me, people who had several pages worth of reviews written.  Almost every one of those reviews said her exercises made the naso-labial folds WORSE...I wasn't going to chance THAT!

I even notcied that the AUTHOR HERSELF had given herself 5 stars and written a ""review"" saying she'd happily autograph boxes full of these dvds if you were having a party and wanted to give them as gifts!! Eww!

I only mention that because it really turned me off and taught me to look at the reviewer's info, before I trust what they had to say (next to any reviewer's name, above their review, there's a little down arrow button that if you scroll over, you can see how many reviews they've written)

So, I came to this item, and took a good, hard, skeptical look.  though it only had 4 reviews, they seemed to be real.

I looked up happyfaceyoga.com (Gary's website) and was pleasantly surprised that there were video clips to try out, and you can buy directly from his website (at $20 plus shipping--a WAY better deal than here on amazon and I could use my paypal account--extra points!)

I purchased it and it arrived super quickly, and I started doing the exercizes every other day.  I didn't follow his suggestion to learn the first 6, and do them for a few days, but rather, I do the disk start to finish, only one rep each, every other day.  Gary's exercises all stem from routines done by thespians (stage actors) in order to emote better during performances.

It's only been a little over a week, but I can already see the elevens have smoothed out, and the naso-labial folds look much better--comperable to maybe when I was between the ages of 30 and 35 years old.  My husband commented on it, even.

I'm a believer.
Gary ROCKS!

A note about the DVD--it's well laid-out.  As a health care professional, I like that he explains each exercize before doing it, sitting in front of a chart that shows the particular muscle groups you're going to be contracting and flexing.  This helped me isolate the muscles in my face while doing the exercise.  You might not care about this, but I found that it helped me.

Soon I hope to be able to do the whole dvd with as many reps as he suggests, or maybe I won't need to since I'm starting now, while the problems are just starting to emerge.  Maybe by starting early it will be maintenance, as opposed to ""rebuilding"" (there are some drastic before and afters on his website!)

I think it was worth every penny and I hope Gary follows it up with more dvds :)",1242000000,85,3143,4.5435168738898755
3102646,5,B0013A0FBK,"I recently began doing Gary's exercises using a sample of his instructions on youtube.  Not only did I INSTANTLY see and feel a difference, my whole mood improved.  I actually felt happier, smiled more readily and genuinely, and people reacted to me more positively.  I actually look forward to doing them every day.

I've done facial exercises before, bought and tried to use several books on the subject.  None had the degree of effectiveness as Gary's extremely well-explained techniques.

I did feel that my face was getting droppy and tired looking, so I am glad that I took the chance, it is well worth the 22.95. I recommend this to anyone who needs a lift in life and can't afford the risk or money of plastic surgery.",1220313600,17,408,3.869047619047619

3102649,5,B0013A0FBK,"First I would like to provide some background ;  I have been doing Eva Fraser facial exercises for as long as I can remember and they certainly were an excellent platform to start from and I still go back to these from time to time to change things up.  Somewhere around 2008 I started noticing my face changing, most probably because I use a computer all day and my posture wasn't that great.  I then stumbled upon Ageless if you dare and read the book in 1 sitting and started straight away.  The exercises took 2 weeks for me to notice a difference and from there on, the effects kept increasing.  The combination of the Eva Fraser's exercises and Ageless if you Dare were giving me good results, so much so that I even had family ask me what I was doing.  My friends and people at work would tell me I looked rested (even when I hadn't slept!).
THEN, a few years ago I came across Happy Face Yoga and thought I would give this a try as it looked good.
I contacted Gary directly as I had waited ages but the DVD had not arrived.  He was very helpful and put another DVD in the post to me straight away.  In the end, I had 2 DVDs as the first one also arrived albeit very late and Gary kindly said I could keep both.
Anyhow, I started doing the exercises straight away.  My exercise plan was Ageless if you dare on 3 days and Happy face yoga on 2 days.  I found the happy face yoga exercises quite hard to do initially because they really isolate and work the muscles.  The day after doing HFY I noticed my entire face seemed more lifted and alive.  The firming and lifting can be seen pretty soon with HFY, it is highly effective.
I don't use it as my main exercise DVD because the effects are so pronounced and I don't think I need that at the moment.  If one were to start doing these exercises in their 50s or 60s I think they would be blown away with the results.
I highly rate Gary's explanation of each exercise and the way in which he demonstrates the exercise.  The intro that he does is really sweet :-)
I hope this DVD never becomes unavailable because I have pretty much tried all the products on the market and although they all deliver to an extent, nothing delivers as much and Happy Face Yoga and other 2 I mentioned.
Thank you Gary.",1451865600,11,2251,4.216783216783217
3102650,5,B0013A0FBK,"I have tried many exercise program and like some of the exercises but not all. I wish I would have bought this sooner. The title is why I didn't...It sounded too spacey and new age for me. These exercises are serious. I feel every muscle in my face after these. He combines facial isometrics with resistance. The exercises are difficult to learn, so bought the training cards off his website, cost more but really helped me learn them. I have seen results with other programs, my favorites are Flex Effect and Facial Magic, but nothing seemed to help my genetic puffy bags. This seems to be working. Also the neck and double chin exercises are great. I would compare this to a barre workout for your face. (Getting into the right position before doing the exercise.) One word of advice- if I overwork my face it looks worse so I take a day or two off, like I would if I were doing muscle conditioning for my body. I do the exercises 3-4 days a week. I also do them at night as it makes my face very red. (blood getting to the face.) After two months of doing this program the skin on my face feels much firmer when I touch. Also he uses a lot of smiling, and smiling makes a person feel happy.",1392595200,3,1193,4.283185840707965
3102651,5,B0013A0FBK,"I've been doing exercises from the Happy Face Yoga DVD for almost 3 months now, on a 6 day a week basis. They really work! I was skeptical how much could be expected from any kind of facial toning exercises, but Gary has made me a believer. For a small commitment of time, you can expect to see significant results and rather quickly too, based on my own experience. Gary does a great job explaining each exercise on the DVD and they are easy to learn and do.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

3102652,5,B0013A0FBK,"I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoy doing this exercise program.  I am 55 years old and look younger than most my age but still...55 is getting up there!  I began this program figuring it would take months to really notice results but am amazed that I could see results from the very first workout.  I'm serious.  This workout brings the blood to your face and you will feel the muscle burn and after the workout you will see a difference.  It may not hold for very long after just one workout, but it will be there and you can see it for yourself.  As you continue the program the lift will hold for longer and longer.

I also use ""Wrinkies"" and ""Frownies"" on my face at night to augment the program.  I've been using them for years can highly recommend them - they really work.  I think they are a nice addition because they also re-train the muscles of your face and help you relax and will make you aware of how much tension you carry in your face.

You will quickly realize why it is called ""Happy Face"" because after each exercise you can't help smiling. I can only guess that I have been carrying around much more tension in my face and neck than I realized.  I do some of these exercises before meditation to help relax me.  I imagine it might be good for some types of headaches as well.

Here's my guess as to why these exercises work.  There are two different types of non-surgical face-lifts out there than involve a workout for your muscles that are very effective.  For thousands of dollars you can get a lift my having your muscles electronically stimulated, or you can do the exercises yourself and have a free lift for the rest of your life.  The expensive lifts only last about 6 months (until your muscles lose their tone) and then you have to have it done all over again.  Save yourself some money and buy the DVD!

I've been doing this program for a few months now and the results are amazing!

One last comment about the negative review from one woman who complained about these exercises creating more wrinkles - I can believe it.  Let me explain...I think you need to be extremely careful with how you perform the exercises and perhaps this is the one flaw in the DVD - there is not enough caution given about how much pressure to use or how hard to pull at your skin and so forth.  I just used some common sense and figured that you need to be really careful.  The exercises are harder to do than you might think because you have to isolate very small muscles and many of the moves are quite delicate and it is easy to over do it.  So go gently until you get a good feel for what you are doing.",1299888000,26,2627,4.294715447154472
3102653,2,B0013A0FBK,"Overall the dvd seems fine, but my jaw felt out of alignment after one of the exercises. I will probably continue with the regime but try to be more prudent about which ones I do.",1299369600,4,179,4.142857142857143
3102654,1,B0013A0FBK,"I take really good care of my skin, so I bought this thinking I was doing a good thing.  I am 40 but have very firm and wrinkle free skin. I do not smoke, avoid sun exposure, do martial arts, and eat an organic/ healthy diet (am saying this only for a background on how I care for myself so that this review may be helpful).

I used this DVD a SHORT amount of time and notice it was not only stretching my skin uncomfortably but also I started seeing lines form around the nose (nose to mouth area) very quickly. I was shocked. I stopped using the program and within a few days the lines started to disappear again. Thankfully!

I emailed to see if I could get my money back. The contact with the seller was not positive and at this point he refused to give me my money back, stating I didn't have the program long enough to notice negative results. I am not a scammer, I just didn't like the program and wanted my money back. I would not suggest purchasing this unless you already have a lot of wrinkles and really loose skin and have nothing to lose by using it.

If you have nice firm skin with little to no wrinkles DO NOT USE THIS! Try Oleda Baker's facial exercises booklet instead, it is much cheaper and will have better results!",1298592000,18,1237,4.206751054852321
3102655,5,B0013A0FBK,"I've only been doing the face exercises about a month.  The DVD says to do every day but I don't believe in exercising the same muscle so often.  I've noticed a big difference in my face and I've only done the exercises about 6 times!  Everything is firmer, eyes are brighter, wrinkle lines have gone away, and chin looks sharp and strong.  Incredible difference and leaves me wondering why more people don't realize the benefits of exercising your face muscles!",1292284800,10,462,4.7375
3102656,5,B0013A0FBK,"I reviewed and sampled every dvd on the subject before I chose Happy Face Yoga.

Prior to the exercise section the 2 basic, foundational positions are introduced. These are the starting points for the 18 exercises which are explained simply and thoroughly.

Before each exercise, a diagram showing the muscles to be used is shown. This is important. It helps you visualize what you're doing. The combination of visualizing and performing makes it easier to learn, makes the learning lasting and enhances your results.

Then the exercise is explained and demonstrated-usually with 1 or 2 full sets of repetitions. A recommendation on the number of repetitions and sets completes the instruction. The dvd then moves you to the next exercise or you can hit the arrow key to skip to what ever you want to do next.

Some of the exercises are easy to learn and do, some are more complicated as they work multiple areas at once. All of them make you feel ""the burn.""  A lot of them are the old standards that actors and actresses use. People with a theater background may recognize some of them.

This is a no-nonsense production. No time is wasted on long panning shots over flowy sets. No annoying music. No teenage models who haven't even made their faces yet. Just 3 average people on a plain set moving quickly, but not too fast, thru the exercises.

In the end, what you're paying for is good solid instruction on exercises that work. Happy Face Yoga does just that.

On top of a great product you get great service. Shipping is fast. Feedback on questions is super fast. And when my copy was stolen they sent me a replacement at no charge.

And finally, there's the name. Just saying Happy Face Yoga makes me smile. Especially when people ask me why I look good and notice that I'm smiling a lot. That's an additional bonus for me. Everyone knows that when you're happy you smile. But the act of smiling also makes you feel happy. And toning the facial muscles causes the corners of the mouth to turn up. you smile a little more and you're a little more happy. An inspired name if you ask me.",1272931200,19,2092,4.572192513368984
3102657,1,B0013A0FBK,I'm 26 and i have no wrinkles but now i have smile lines & smoker lines above my lip from using this dvd. I have never smoked in my whole life. The exercises hurt my face for days. Now i have to get collagen and a fraxel laser on my face because of this dvd.,1271289600,8,258,3.709090909090909
3102658,5,B0013A0FBK,"""Happy Face Yoga"" is a good program for toning and reshaping the face. Some of the exercises are rather weird; tricky to do and hold, but they will work multiple muscles simultaneously, so it can be an efficient way of achieving significant results in a short time. I think some people will have difficulty ever doing certain exercises, like ""The Jowl Eraser"" which is a little like patting your head and rubbing your stomach while doing sit-ups.
One of the women on the DVD is really bad at doing the exercises. Maybe she is comic relief, especially when she can't stop looking off screen and waving with her fingers to someone. Read: amateurish.
Worst of all is the way Mr. Sikorski mangles the pronunciation of some of the muscles. I want to scream each time he says ""mylohyoid"". ""Platysma"" is almost as bad. Hey, Gary, buy a dictionary and learn their pronunciation. It's easy, easier that doing theses exercises!
Nevertheless, this face exercise program is far better than the insipid and incompetent productions of Carole Maggio, of ""Facercise"" fame.
However, ""Miss Craig's Face-Saving Exercises"" is still the unrivaled bible of face exercise; comprehensive, intelligent (and humorous!) and effective. But, for a tough facial workout you will really feel, ""Happy Face Yoga"" does the job.
In spite of the drawbacks, most people who diligently practice the exercises on this DVD will probably notice an improvement within a month.
A revised version of this DVD is in order, with a menu that goes straight to the workout with the option of not having each exercise explained every time. And, of course, let's hear the muscle names correctly pronounced. We can probably do without the silly lady, too.",1253836800,31,1703,4.978947368421053

3337150,2,B0013A0FBK,"Overall the dvd seems fine, but my jaw felt out of alignment after one of the exercises. I will probably continue with the regime but try to be more prudent about which ones I do.",1299369600,4,179,4.142857142857143
3337151,1,B0013A0FBK,"I take really good care of my skin, so I bought this thinking I was doing a good thing.  I am 40 but have very firm and wrinkle free skin. I do not smoke, avoid sun exposure, do martial arts, and eat an organic/ healthy diet (am saying this only for a background on how I care for myself so that this review may be helpful).

I used this DVD a SHORT amount of time and notice it was not only stretching my skin uncomfortably but also I started seeing lines form around the nose (nose to mouth area) very quickly. I was shocked. I stopped using the program and within a few days the lines started to disappear again. Thankfully!

I emailed to see if I could get my money back. The contact with the seller was not positive and at this point he refused to give me my money back, stating I didn't have the program long enough to notice negative results. I am not a scammer, I just didn't like the program and wanted my money back. I would not suggest purchasing this unless you already have a lot of wrinkles and really loose skin and have nothing to lose by using it.

If you have nice firm skin with little to no wrinkles DO NOT USE THIS! Try Oleda Baker's facial exercises booklet instead, it is much cheaper and will have better results!",1298592000,18,1237,4.206751054852321
3337152,5,B0013A0FBK,"I've only been doing the face exercises about a month.  The DVD says to do every day but I don't believe in exercising the same muscle so often.  I've noticed a big difference in my face and I've only done the exercises about 6 times!  Everything is firmer, eyes are brighter, wrinkle lines have gone away, and chin looks sharp and strong.  Incredible difference and leaves me wondering why more people don't realize the benefits of exercising your face muscles!",1292284800,10,462,4.7375
3337153,5,B0013A0FBK,"I reviewed and sampled every dvd on the subject before I chose Happy Face Yoga.

Prior to the exercise section the 2 basic, foundational positions are introduced. These are the starting points for the 18 exercises which are explained simply and thoroughly.

Before each exercise, a diagram showing the muscles to be used is shown. This is important. It helps you visualize what you're doing. The combination of visualizing and performing makes it easier to learn, makes the learning lasting and enhances your results.

Then the exercise is explained and demonstrated-usually with 1 or 2 full sets of repetitions. A recommendation on the number of repetitions and sets completes the instruction. The dvd then moves you to the next exercise or you can hit the arrow key to skip to what ever you want to do next.

Some of the exercises are easy to learn and do, some are more complicated as they work multiple areas at once. All of them make you feel ""the burn.""  A lot of them are the old standards that actors and actresses use. People with a theater background may recognize some of them.

This is a no-nonsense production. No time is wasted on long panning shots over flowy sets. No annoying music. No teenage models who haven't even made their faces yet. Just 3 average people on a plain set moving quickly, but not too fast, thru the exercises.

In the end, what you're paying for is good solid instruction on exercises that work. Happy Face Yoga does just that.

On top of a great product you get great service. Shipping is fast. Feedback on questions is super fast. And when my copy was stolen they sent me a replacement at no charge.

And finally, there's the name. Just saying Happy Face Yoga makes me smile. Especially when people ask me why I look good and notice that I'm smiling a lot. That's an additional bonus for me. Everyone knows that when you're happy you smile. But the act of smiling also makes you feel happy. And toning the facial muscles causes the corners of the mouth to turn up. you smile a little more and you're a little more happy. An inspired name if you ask me.",1272931200,19,2092,4.572192513368984
3337154,1,B0013A0FBK,I'm 26 and i have no wrinkles but now i have smile lines & smoker lines above my lip from using this dvd. I have never smoked in my whole life. The exercises hurt my face for days. Now i have to get collagen and a fraxel laser on my face because of this dvd.,1271289600,8,258,3.709090909090909
3337155,5,B0013A0FBK,"""Happy Face Yoga"" is a good program for toning and reshaping the face. Some of the exercises are rather weird; tricky to do and hold, but they will work multiple muscles simultaneously, so it can be an efficient way of achieving significant results in a short time. I think some people will have difficulty ever doing certain exercises, like ""The Jowl Eraser"" which is a little like patting your head and rubbing your stomach while doing sit-ups.
One of the women on the DVD is really bad at doing the exercises. Maybe she is comic relief, especially when she can't stop looking off screen and waving with her fingers to someone. Read: amateurish.
Worst of all is the way Mr. Sikorski mangles the pronunciation of some of the muscles. I want to scream each time he says ""mylohyoid"". ""Platysma"" is almost as bad. Hey, Gary, buy a dictionary and learn their pronunciation. It's easy, easier that doing theses exercises!
Nevertheless, this face exercise program is far better than the insipid and incompetent productions of Carole Maggio, of ""Facercise"" fame.
However, ""Miss Craig's Face-Saving Exercises"" is still the unrivaled bible of face exercise; comprehensive, intelligent (and humorous!) and effective. But, for a tough facial workout you will really feel, ""Happy Face Yoga"" does the job.
In spite of the drawbacks, most people who diligently practice the exercises on this DVD will probably notice an improvement within a month.
A revised version of this DVD is in order, with a menu that goes straight to the workout with the option of not having each exercise explained every time. And, of course, let's hear the muscle names correctly pronounced. We can probably do without the silly lady, too.",1253836800,31,1703,4.978947368421053

8249548,5,B0013A0FBK,"Since I believe in weight resistant exercise for the body the facial yoga exercises seemed realistic. The method primarily uses isotonic methods and if done religiously, as in all exercise routines, I found can be very effective. Since I read an article in the NYTimes about a study abroad that gives credibility to the facial exercises I bought this video and am quite surprised at how quickly results followed. It is like any other exercise, especially weight resistant exercise, in that you need to challenge yourself, set a schedule and do the exercises daily. It is probably more effective with general sagging then fine lines, but this is more noticable for general improvement anyway. It's really worth it to just buy the video and get the full demonstration which also gives you a class on the facial muscles and some tips on supplements and healthy eating.",1518134400,3,865,4.931506849315069

8249552,5,B0013A0FBK,"I have to give Gary's DVD 5 stars. I am 28 and I am using his program for preventing the formation of wrinkles. In 2 days my eyebrows are lifted! At day 4 my skin is visibly firmer. I am thrilled with the results and I've used his competitors programs in past with no noticeable results. My routine is simple, every other day I alternate between The Face Yoga Method and Happy Face Yoga.  I have to space out his DVD because my face is red, tingles and is sore the following day. You won't hear any complaints here, his DVD is working, hooray to collagen!

Caution

When starting a facial fitness program keep your body hydrated, your face moist with a light oil and use cotton gloves to help isolate the muscles and prevent wrinkle formation. Most importantly, until you have the correct posture and hand placement always do your facial exercise in front of a mirror.

The four principles of facial exercises

1. Isolate the muscle to prevent wrinkles
2. Visualize the muscle
3. Concentrate on just one muscle
4. Hold (freeze) for the lactic burn

I noticed two negative reviews and feel they may not be aware on the basic principles of facial yoga. Be  an informed consumer before starting any new program and leaving negative stars.",1470614400,8,1235,4.586363636363636
8249553,5,B0013A0FBK,This is the best facial exercise program I have ever seen or used. The combination of breathing and using the smile position as a backdrop is superb.
