7900866,4,7885883035,"This is actually a two part film, directed by Roberto Rossellini, as a tribute to Magnani's talent.

'The Human Voice' is based on a story by Jean Cocteau. To me, this is a cinematic milestone in that it takes place in one room with one person on the telephone. I don't recall an earlier film in such a setting. Also, every person has been a participant on such a call before, the end of the affair ~ Magnani's performance doesn't require the caller's voice to even be heard.

The next short film is based on a treatment by Fellini, 'The Miracle.' It's delightful seeing a young, voiceless Fellini assuming the role of Saint Joseph. Magnani magestically plays a poor, dim-witted woman ~ a memorable and passionate performance.",1280793600,,726,4.708661417322834
