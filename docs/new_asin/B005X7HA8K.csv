4901961,4,B005X7HA8K,"I would say that I am giving this series four stars, because seasons four and five are not quite as good as the first three. This show was one of favorites in high school and early college. To own it on DVD is an awesome experience. Definitely this was an under rated show. I would recommend that anyone who like crime dramas buy this series. It's worth watching. Like the first reviewer said, many of the bike stunts in this show were amazing.",1326412800,11,444,4.36144578313253
4901962,5,B005X7HA8K,"Although a lot of people have likened this show to 'baywatch on wheels' I think this show stood on its own very well. Of course the actors are all very good looking, but the stunts and the music and the stories are what make the show. Some of the best bicycle stunts are employed, and its just a good time all around. Very under-rated show on USA!",1326326400,10,347,4.1940298507462686

4902141,4,B005X7HA8K,"Watching the first three seasons on DVD was GREAT ... totally LOVED this show & it clicked with the chemistry between the five main characters ... after Season 3, when Victor & Lt. Palairmo [NOT SURE OF THE SPELLING} left, the show seemed to go to an updated verson of THE MOD SQUAD, only the new characters were NOT likeable OR belivable as cops ... bringing Victor back in Season 4, for one episode, TO KILL HIS CHARCTER OFF was STUPID ... the ONLY REASON I watched Seasons 4 & 5 were because Paula Trickey {CORY} & Darlene Vogel {CHRIS} were still on the show ... was DISAPPOINTED that the DVD had no interview explaing WHY they gutted the show in Season 4 & 5 [the only WORSE EXAMPLE of this,  was how they gutted the TV show SILK STALKINGS] ... THE COMPLETE SERIES OF PACIFIC BLUE, for me, was Seasons 1 thru 3, & I have NO DESIRE to watch Seasons 4 & 5 on DVD ... that being said I LOVED THE SHOW ENOUGH, that it was definitely worth the purchase { I rate the first three seasons, 5 out of 5 stars}",1379721600,,1004,4.148717948717949

4902143,4,B005X7HA8K,"Varied storylines. Good action. Mostly simple-ish bike stunts. The crew changes over time, as in life, but it doesn't cut the entertainment.

4902186,3,B005X7HA8K,How had I forgotten that the show was littered with gratuitous shots of women in the slightest of bikinis? I recalled the hot guys (Jim Davidson) and the strong-willed women (Paula Trickey) but had forgotten that Pacific Blue was littered with marginal scripts. A weekly dose of bad scripts is one thing but a massive boxed set of them tough to handle.,1365379200,,352,4.693548387096774
4902187,5,B005X7HA8K,"I could not be more pleased with my purchase.  Where else can you purchase five seasons of a series for less than thirty dollars?  The quality of the episodes are great.

4902189,5,B005X7HA8K,"Please understand - this is *Mill Creek*, and *not* Warner Home Video or Sony, for example. They deal with public domain material and some other TV shows, movies, etc. They exist as a *budget* company. They bring things to DVD that the studios may never release from their own label. They keep the price way down because they do not remaster, have the DVDs in the regular type of holding format.
If you got this set pristine, not in paper sleeves, subtitles, etc - you would be paying the regular price for ""all 101 episodes from all five seasons"". The regular studios can have 1 season for $29-$59 dollars.
Please take note of the price vs. the studio releases from the show's makers, etc. The price is excellent, and I have waited so long for this series, I am glad *someone* has released it. Mill Creek seems to be more into getting more non-public domain stuff on DVD & I thank them for it.
You're getting this at full Amazon price of a mere $39.78 (Full retail is still *much* lower than a regular producer-studio release would be for 101 episodes over *5* seasons).
We could have waited for the studio that produced PB to release it - but they never did.
Please keep track of which company releases the TV series, movie, etc.
Please - buy and enjoy.
If it wasn't for Mill Creek, the *ONLY* option you would have *is* BOOTLEG.
Mill Creek is definitely better than bootleg.
Buy it.
Enjoy it.
Be thankful it is out at all from a commercial company.

4902192,3,B005X7HA8K,"The first three seasons was cutting edge, good storylines, (not great), great stunts and of course great looking stars for both male and female viewers. There was something about seeing crimes solved by cops in spandex.

Two of the original stars left the show, and three new cast members were added. It was a great show to watch for different reasons, like watching movies on Mystery Theater 3000 and for teh same reasons. Pacific Blue all of a sudden became F-Troup on bikes. The first episode of season 4 had the rookies go undercover at a college and one of the new cops, Jeff Stearns, did drugs and the blonde Shanna Moakly is constantly trying to pick-up the Lt. played by Jim Davidson while Darlene Vogel stews, meanwhile Paula Tricky has a thing for Mario Lopez after getting pregnant after a one-night stand and Amy Hunter has a sorrid past.

The three new additions are terrible cops, Davidson screws up constantly by allowing the nitwits to try to solve crimes and go undercover and there is always a sopa opera feel to the two final seasons although all of the stars are hardly worth cheering for. The writers must have done acid before writing the scripts, becuae there are so many plot holes and even with civil service protection for police officers everyone of them would and should have been fired. Santa Monica was never safe with these spandex clad crime fighters around.

It is one misadventure after another and great for pure laughs and seeing sexy women in spandex and revealing outfits, and for the girls the men may not be classic actors, but nice eye candy reading scripts. There was a good reason this show was never nominated for an Emmy, but surely if Mystery Theater 3000 ever does spoofs on tv shows this one is right there with My Mother The Car.",1350604800,,1778,4.6380952380952385

They were unaware of any issues as of yet but they are sending me out replacement discs for free. So before you send your box set back to amazon give them a call.

Just an update. I received the replacement discs within a week of calling. Both work perfectly",1328486400,22,541,4.520408163265306

4902232,5,B005X7HA8K,I loved watching Pacific Blue and I am glad that it finally came out on DVD.  I liked the first 3 years best.  Darlene Vogel/Chris Kelly was my favorite.,1326844800,3,153,4.241379310344827
4902233,5,B005X7HA8K,"What can I say, its the TV show that made me take up cycling as a hobby. Loved every chase and stunts sequences in this series! And its finally out on DVD.. Its been a long time coming!!! Even better is that its selling at such an affordable price for all five seasons of this show. At such an affordable price, don't expect fancy packaging for the DVDs. Its a simple packaging with a thick DVD hard box. Inside, there are 19 discs in total, each disc is kept in a paper disc sleeve. Picture quality is ok for the price, not digitally remastered or anything, but its standard DVD definition and definitely viewable. Sound is just as good.

The first 3 seasons of the show was great. New cast members were added in season 4 when Rick Rossovich and Marco Ferraez left after season 3. Unfortunately, the show went downhill from season 4 onwards when the writers/producers went for a different style of writing and look for the show. It ended after 101 episodes in season 5. But it was a good 5 year run of Pacific Blue, and not many expected the show to even last 5 years. I'm glad it did and its really great to have all the seasons finally out on DVD.

The only downside I found from this set is that it doesn't include any subtitles. Other than that, I'd still give it 5 stars for the fact that this show is finally out on DVD! Highly recommended! Let the bikes fly!!!!!!

Each  time  I  watch  the  show  &  I  get  to  the  last  DVD  in  season  5,  its  not  easy  believing  your  at  the  end  of  series.  &  I  just  wish  the  series  went  a  little  further.  I  really  do  get  use  to  the  show.
Amazing  bicycle  stunts,  &  they  stay  after  the  suspects  very  carefully  without  losing  them  in  large  crowds.
Stopping  thieves,  drug  dealers,
&  anything  that  seems  unusual.  I  have  to  give  this  show  credit.  Their  foes  try  their  best  at  being  sneaky  &  secretive  &  are  eventually  found  out  about  &  stopped.  You  take  for  example  in  season  2  or  3  a  young  girl  targets  victor  trying  to  be  his  girlfriend  but  soon  starts  playing  pranks,  Stalks  him  continually  &  tries  to  frame  him.  These  guys  do  not  tolerate  the  annoying  type  of  people  that  try  to  mess  with  them.  &  start  narrowing  down  on  a  whole  bunch  of  con artist  like  people.  The  unit  stops  the  slickest  people  on  the  beach.
Awesome  series.  I  looked  for  this  a  lot  for  about  5  years  to  buy  the  show  on  DVD.  But  failed  to  find  it.  The  theme  song  at  the  beginning  &  end  of  the  show  makes  the  show  worth  watching!
I  am  happy  to  find  it  on  amazon......
Pricing  is  reasonable.  Discs  work  perfectly,  Palmero,  Corey,  Chris,  TC,  Victor,  Bobby Cruz,  Russ Granger, Monica,  &  Jamie  Strickland,  Did  a  good  job  in  their  scripts.  Counting  everyone  of  them  its  really  9  people  who  star  in  this  show.  Its  too  bad  you  didn't  get  to  see  them  all  in  at  least  one  season.  That  would  have  been  interesting.
This  has  been  my  favorite  show  for  a  long  time.
When  it  quit  coming  on  TV  I  wasn't  happy  about  it,  the  first  3  seasons  were  the  only  ones  that  aired,  &  I  knew  I  wanted  to  watch  the  first  season  to  the  last.
So  I  looked  for  Pacific  blue  series  at  Walmart  &  a  place  where  they  sell  movies  in  the  mall.  It  took  me  forever  to  find  this.  I'm  glad  I  finally  did  though.
I  wish  there  were  subtitles  or  closed  captioning  for  the  hearing  impaired.
Its  not  always  easy  to  catch  everything  they  say.",1501891200,2,2333,4.184210526315789

8488296,5,B005X7HA8K,"Amazing show. Can't believe it never became a hit in the US. The first couple of seasons are far better though. It lost some of the appeal when Rick Rossovich and Marcos Ferraez left the show, but still pretty good. If you liked Baywatch, you're gonna like this show too. I would recommend everyone to check it out.",1497225600,,315,4.448275862068965
8488297,3,B005X7HA8K,I am kind or disappointed about it and I know it is over a year since I bought and received the product so I know nothing can be done but the problem is the 2nd disc of the first season was not in the set and the 3rd disc of the first season will not play so I am missing about 8 episodes between the 2 discs. I love this show so missing that many episodes in the beginning is very disappointing.,1496534400,,396,3.841463414634146

8488299,5,B005X7HA8K,"I really loved watching Pacific Blue when I was a teenager when it was airing on television so much that I would ride my bike pretending I was a cop from the show. I had toy police gear, and a toy police siren, and would wear it when I would go out and ride. I also watched it every single afternoon after school, and would not want to miss a single episode. When I found that they had the ENTIRE SEASON on DVD, I was ecstatic that my childhood favorite show was on DVD! Thank you Amazon for bringing it back.",1473552000,,509,4.0495049504950495
8488300,3,B005X7HA8K,I love that this series is available on DVD! The sound on the DVDs is not consistent- some episodes are louder or softer than others.,1470009600,,133,4.36
