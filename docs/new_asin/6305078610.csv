967338,3,6305078610,"Although the drama on stage was disappointing, Muti and the vocalists create terrific music. It is unfortunate that the recording quality is only mediocre. Furthermore, the stage lighting was inappropriately dim for capturing the opera on tape, and most of the scenes are excessively gloomy. All in all, this performance fails to demonstrate the strengths of the DVD format.",1049328000,2,374,5.3559322033898304
967339,4,6305078610,"Mozart's operas have never been the easiest to set, and this production's director does little to alleviate that stigma. The sets are austere and repetitive, the costume design is good but hackneyed by overuse, and the lighting often obscures the more delicate details of the staging. But, if the backdrop to the music is slightly disappointing, the music itself is anything but. Mutti leads a roaring interpretation that lets down neither his lightning fast tempo nor the jubilent spirit at the heart of Mozart's music. The casting is superb! From Zerlina (Metzner), meek and innocent (even through her final curtain call) to Leoporello (Desderi) whose antics on the stage make us fall in love with his character to Thomas Allen's Don Giovanni who is the perfect blend of regality and wickedness. All around this is the best recording of Don Giovanni available on DVD, and one those eager to aquire Mozart's grand masterpiece in this format first need look in to.",1021939200,9,964,4.9937888198757765
967340,5,6305078610,"This is the best performance of Don Giovanni that I have seen yet. Except for a little backround noise, it was really great. I loved Thomas Allen's and Natale De Carolis's singing. The sets were also very nice. I happen to think that Zerlina was a little smarmy, but she sang well. This opera was recorded nicely,and I would reccomend it to anyone. I wish I saw it live!",1020816000,3,370,4.3768115942028984
967341,4,6305078610,"I liked almost everything about this performance and have it on VHS and Laser, (not DVD yet), and the sound was fine.  I only found the camera shots too long and lighting too dim in places.  I thought the singing and conducting excellent.  Thomas Allen is still my favorite Don, however, I also like the Raimondi and Ramey videos as well and put the new Cologne DVD with Allen, Vaness, Rost, James & Furanlento (sp.) with James Conlon conducting as the top four videos of this opera.  They are all so different that all four are worth collecting. Recommend this one and sure DVD is probably improved over the media I own.",1020384000,5,621,4.517857142857143

It also gives the viewer that chance to see his very unique conducting style and as always an electric performance.  It also includes and incredible performance by Ms. Mutter that brings out the best in her.
I gave it only 4 stars because you could not see or get a feel of the audience.  It would have been much better if the audience reaction to this music were also included.",984700800,,510,4.451612903225806
967344,4,6305078610,"I have seen many, many stagings of this grandiose work.  Sadly it is rare to find musical qualities matching the dramatic ones, or viceversa.  This  is, however, not a bad production.  Musically it is more than adequate, and  I agree with other reviewers in giving high marks to Zerlina.  Sadly the  stage production is too rigidly classical.  The comical relief that  Leporello can provide is toned down and Don Giovanni's  seductive powers  are, at best, subdued. The nicely designed stage does lend itself for the  more somber scenes.",965088000,12,537,4.9772727272727275
967345,4,6305078610,"I have been listening to opera for my entire and in having listened to over 500 different recordings of opera on video and countless 100's of cd's, I have experienced all the different types of weakness and greatness  that make recordings what they are.  There is the infamous background noise  that drives you crazy, the poor balance of sound between the instruments,  voices and even the weak chorus microphoning that makes it impossible to  hear parts.  Sometimes even poor staging or simply poor casting for  different roles is the culprit for a poor opera recording.  I had  never heard the La Scala recording of Don Giovanni and guided only by the  reviews of DVD on Amazon.com and several otherreviews from several opera  magazines, I almost didn't buy this DVD because everyone seems to like to  put down this recording.  Although I agree with the opinions of some  reviewers that certain La Scala DVD recordings sound and look like VHS  recordings simply ""passed on to DVD,"" (i.e., Cosi Fan Tutti,  don't buy it! ) I did not have that feeling with this recording.  Riccardo Muti conducts with reasonable and controlled flair and tempo, the  singing is for the most part strong except in the part of Leoporello in  which he has somewhat of a tendency to fall off tempo, the musical parts  are fairly easy to differentiate in the orchestra, the costumes and sets  are pretty, and the interpretion of the libretto is a fabulous translation.  Yes, I would not give this recording 5 stars or say that it is the  favorite of my recordings of opera, but as Don Giovanni is probably (in my  opinion) one of the greatest 3 operas to ever be written, it is a shame for  people interested in opera and classical music to not accquaint themselves  with its beautiful music and plot before seeing it live in the opera house.  This recording is the only good production of the opera out there.  There  are two other recordings and if you think that this one isn't your cup of  tea, I promise you that you will hate the other two recordings.  It is  impossible to even differentiate parts in them.  Even for fanatics of  opera like me who rip their hair out when there is the slighest background  noise or difficulty in differentiating parts in the recording, I think that  this is a reasonably good production with good sound and video quality that  will give you great listening value.  Buy it and enjoy.  The sound quality  is great, I promise.  If the subtle psychological treatment of the staging  and acting doesn't do it for you, this recording sounds so good that you  can even turn off the picture and enjoy yourself (Although I believe that  the video heightens the enjoyment of the music).  If you want a great audio  recording of Don Giovanni, I recommend the Claudio Abbado recording with  Bryn Terfel for which I have also written a review.

967346,2,6305078610,"Don Giovanni is by far one of my favorite operas, so when I saw this DVD I bought it immediately. Big disappointing. The video quality is old-fashioned TV, illumination too dark. The most disappointing part was  not technical, but artistic; in the scene when the Comendatore comes to Don  Giovanni's house (my favorite scene, I was astonished when I first saw it  in Amadeus) the Comendatore is NOT THERE, just his voice. It lost all its  impact when you see Don Giovanni talking to the audience. People usually  wait two hours for this scene, and then it comes THIS?  Sometimes  originality is not better. I suggest to keep listening a CD version of the  opera, and use your imagination for the rest.",953164800,17,701,4.688524590163935

967526,2,6305078610,"With copious amounts of material swirling around in this over busy production, it is hard at times to concentrate on the performances. With cloaks flourished and hats put on and taken off ad-nauseum the two main performers Allen and Desdiri occasionally suffer from shortage of breath and at times you feel like screaming ""please just stand still"".

Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging. I don't want to be too unkind as all singers have off nights and the audience at La Scala obviously loved him and who am I to argue with them. A quick mention for Francisco Ariza - a wonderful singer whose voice here sounds tired but still melodious with hints of the beauty of his vocal youth.

Of the women Edita Gruberova, as you would expect, gives the overall polished performance, her pure voice ringing out like a bell with never a hint of a screech. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Ann Murray whose top notes are squally and jarr the ear, however her lower register is still lovely and she is a very good actress, able to communicate her anguish, her aria `Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata `is very touching.

The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.

This is a fairly enjoyable evenings viewing but I was left feeling slightly cheated and wanting to strangle the stage director.",1191283200,9,1670,4.593959731543624
967527,4,6305078610,"After reading his,I smiled. We must stop meeting this way. However, my opinion of Gruberova is less kind than his, i.e., she has no business singing a spinto bordering on dramatic role. Even in the Good Old Days, her Konstanze wasn't high on my list. (The first time I heard Martern aller Arten it was sung by Helen Traubel, just for instance). As for Ann Murray's Elvira, yes, not gutsy enough. I'm that crazy about Bartoli's take on the lady, although as I've mentioned elsewhere, she brings the same characterization to Fiodiligi who, it seems to me, cannot be nearly so enraged as Elvira, after all.

Sir Thomas is marvelous and Claudio Desderi is more than up to the Leporello. And I, too, very much like de Carolis and Mentzer is the off-again/on-again Masetto and Zerlina.

There are a number of really fine recordings of Giovanni, as you all know. I'd avoid the one with Terfel (whom I ADORE in some roles) and Kringelborn as Elvira - he's lacking in the suave department and she screaches.",1173657600,4,998,4.6647727272727275
967528,2,6305078610,"It seems easy to stage a Mozart's Opera. Well, it is terribly difficult..

The man was subject to a German education by His Father and ArchBishop Coloredo a powerful dictator of a mid size town. Milos Forman got it right in the movie ""Amadeus""..

The problem with this Opera is very simple to solve: The men should be Italian(ate) bass-baritones and, ideally the ""voices"" of Don Giovanni and of Leporello should be almost undistinguishable.

The ladies should be sopranno for Donna Anna, Mezzo-sopranno for D. Elvira and Zerlina can be either but she must absolutely sound fresh and ""peppy"".

Well, on this version, all the main roles are miscast. The English singers sound artificial, particularly Ann Murray, Gruberova sounds like an old sheep.

Giorgio Strheler should have refused ti direct this ""trouppe"". As for Muti, he is pardonned. Coming from Philadelfia ""under the Huge legs of a senile Eugene Ormandy (I witness it),  he had to take it. And musically this is a correct version.

967529,5,6305078610,This production of Mozart's Don Giovanni is great. Riccardo Muti is one of my favorite conductors and (being the La Scala orchestra) he has a great orchestra under him. The singers themselves are excellent. Thomas Allen's Giovanni is one of the best in the world (it's his signature role.) I am really looking forward to see him in the Chicago Lyric Opera's Cosi fan Tutte as Don Alfonso. Sergej Koptchak is among the best of the Commendatore's. Edita Gruberova is one of the best Anna's I have ever seen. Her Non mi dir shook La Scala that night. Francisco Arazia's Ottavio is THE best I have ever seen. Ann Murray's Elvira is a little wobbly but she pulls off the role of the jilted lover very well. Claudio Desderi's Leoporello is also the best I have ever seen. Natale de Carolis and Susanne Mentzer are wonderful as Masetto and Zerlina. The stage/production is also wonderful and seemed very well-rehearsed and acted.

Perhaps it's only a question of poor video equipment or lighting or God-knows-what, but almost every scene comes off as dark, gloomy, and indistinct - and the acting is...well, how can I put it? Was the entire cast hungover, or depressed, or what?  The visual aspects of the opera (lighting, costumes, acting) turned me off so thoroughly that I could hardly focus at all on the music and singing.

Special praise must be reserved for Edita Gruberova as Donna Anna, her singing is just impeccable, and Non mir dir aria is the highlight of the evening. She gets the biggest ovation at the of the show.

Very well sung and acted throughout; I especially liked the virile-sounding Don Ottavio of Araiza. Muti leads a dynamic, romantic rendition of the score, only slightly distracting when the camera repeatedly cuts to him during crucial arias. An altogether riveting performance.",1118188800,17,393,6.017857142857143
967534,4,6305078610,"This DVD of 'Don Giovanni' comes from 1987 at La Scala, in Giorgio Strehler's fairly mainstream production (and thank goodness for that!) with mostly top-notch singers. It has been available before on VHS and even on DVD (on a different label)  but at a much higher price. And it may be my imagination - I don't have the earlier releases at hand - but it seems to me that this issue is in cleaner sound and with clearer visuals. Riccardo Muti conducts the Scala forces in an exciting but well-controlled performance. Thomas Allen is outstanding as Don Juan, oozing charm as he snakes his way into the lives of all the women within sight. Claudio Desderi makes a suitably ambivalent (and rich-voiced) Leporello, disdaining his master at the same time he hopes to join in the debauchery. Suzanne Mentzer, looking absolutely delicious, looks (and sings) a wonderfully lively but nave Zerlina; hers is my favorite performance here. Ann Murray is a somewhat muted Donna Elvira, but that approach can work and she pulls it off. Her voice is lush and she never shrieks during the ferocious moments. Sergey Koptchak is splendid as the Commendatore, although I did wonder why at the end he was mostly heard and not seen. Francisco Araiza sings nicely but is a bit wooden as Don Ottavio. Natale de Carolis makes a handsome young Masetto, sings ardently and is possibly the most tellingly subtle actor on the stage; he and Mentzer make the most attractive Zerlina and Masetto I recall ever seeing. The only significant letdown, and one of the reasons I gave this production four stars instead of five, is the Donna Anna of Edita Gruberova. She has been noted for her silvery coloratura and her lovely tone (as in her recording of 'Rusalka,' since, of course, trumped by that of Rene Fleming) but here she sounds tired, particularly early in the opera. This improves slightly as we go along, but the voice still sounds a bit worn. Her acting, as well, is merely serviceable.
Sets, costumes, direction are all a credit to their creators: Enzo Frigerio, Franca Squarciapino, and Giorgio Strehler. Lighting by Vannio Vanni is just the tiniest bit muted in this production, but it is otherwise adequate.
The opera takes just one DVD. There are no extras, not surprising considering the opera itself is just shy of three hours. The only subtitles are in English; there are not even Italian subtitles, but the Italian libretto is printed in the enclosed booklet. This is a bit cumbersome if one is trying to follow the libretto closely. Further, the divisions and settings of the various scenes are not marked in the libretto - it's the sung text only. Fortunately, differing from some booklets I've seen lately, the text is printed in black against white; there seems to be a trend towards printing white text (or even gray text) again dark backgrounds, which makes reading the tiny print exceedingly difficult, at least for those of us of a certain age.
I do recommend this DVD, but with the minor provisos stated above.

7883160,5,6305078610,"... Lorenzo Da Ponte's greatest theatrical masterpiece, his portrayal of the infamous rake-hell Don Juan/Don Giovanni. Da Ponte's other libretti for Martin y Soler and for Mozart are thoroughly well crafted comedies, but with Don Giovanni he tapped a deeper level of the human psyche. The ambivalence of Da Ponte's moral attitude toward Don Giovanni -- not just a womanizing cad but a bullying aristocrat bent on brutalizing anyone of lower status -- permeates the whole libretto. It's the same ambivalence that permeates John Milton's ""Paradise Lost"". Just as Milton's Satan is by far the most fascinating character in his epic poem, Don Giovanni is really the only ""attractive"" personality in Da Ponte's drama. Given the number of treatments of vital rogues and charming rake-hells in 18th Century literature, it seems obvious that readers and theater-goers of the Enlightenment were obsessed with such figures. Given a magical choice, wouldn't most of them have taken the role of Giovanni in real life over that of the obsequious Don Ottavio or the plodding peasant Masetto? And wouldn't we make the same choice, vengeful statue be damned?

Portraying Don Giovanni on stage is a huge challenge for an actor of our times. He can't be a fool or a fop. He can't be an admirable bon vivant whose final defiance is to be taken as redemptively heroic... but some of that ""larger-than-life"" heroism must be included in a satisfactory portrayal. Don Giovanni portrayed as a sick sociopath or as merely a nasty rapist who gets properly punished ... well, such interpretations are defensible, but to my mind they miss the essence of Da Ponte's theatrical genius. Thomas Allen's portrayal of Giovanni is of the latter sort; he's a brutal tyrant whose only ""charm"" for the beautiful peasant Zerlina is his social status. The acting by all characters in this production consistently and effectively supports that central portrayal of Giovanni as a mere evil-doer who entraps himself and gets his just reward. It's well done, I have to say, but it's too blunt. The ambivalence of Da Ponte's libretto is what has made Don Giovanni perennially vivid and ultimately greater than any single interpretation.

Oh yeah, and there's the music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Do I need to say that it's not half bad?",1353283200,,2292,5.028947368421052
7883161,5,6305078610,"I beg to disagree with those reviewers who trashes this luscious recording of Mozart's greatest opera.
I owned quite a number (if not too many) of Don Giovanni recordings, and quite a number of dismal 'modern' productions pissed me off excessively for their irreconciliablility with the script.
This La Scala 1989 production has many credits to its favour: Muti's conducting is lively and alert, and he is generally (if not 100%) attentive to the singers on stage - a plus example is his tremendous collaboration with Araiza's Don Ottavio in 'Il Mio tersoro', the glaring minus example is Allen's 'Finch'han dal vino' (though the problem might not be solely Muti's).
The production is fabulous and beautiful - with the dim lighting, the great sets and costumes, making a very enjoyable visual impact on viewers. For instance, the Massetto and Zerlina pair is almost fairy-tale like, while the two Dons (Giovanni and Ottavio) are most magnificiently donned.
As for the cast, I agree that there are rooms left for desire in some of the major characters, but generally, each single actor/actress acquitted him/herself very well.
In the title role, Sir Thomas Allen is not a typical Don G. His smoky baritone is interesting, yet not biting enough, and he is not in the best of vocal forms here, while his valet Leporello is magnificiently sung and portrayed by veteran Claudio Desderi, who pulls off a terrific performance here. As so many reviewers have already noted, Natale De Carolis's Massetto is most interesting. This young baritone gives perhaps the most vividly memorable portrayal of an otherwise easily side-lined character.
The Commendatore is also well sung, but somehow I do not see him at curtain call.
As for the ingratiating character of Don Ottavio, the great Mexican tenor Francisco Araiza gives a totally unconventional yet fully convincing performance. The La Scala audience obviously could not take it, but as the hen-pecked fiance of the domineering Donna Anna, Araiza's portrayal is really spot on, and he sings two tremendous arias with terrific breath control and superb phrasing, fully in sync with Muti in both.
Gruberova leads the ladies' cast as Anna, and gives a fiery performance, if not totally beautiful. Her Anna is dominant and alert, quite unlike the usual lady-like Annas in other productions. Ann Murray scores an almost perfect Donna Elvira vocally, though hers may not be the most dramatic portrayal of this pivotal role.
Suzanne Mentzer is an ultra-lovely Zerlina, and makes an upstagingly striking pair with Massetto.
This is a highly enjoyable Don Giovanni production, and a sterling performance.",1348704000,3,2636,5.146853146853147

Perhaps, it's the fact that we don't ""see"" the ghost of the Commendatore in the final dramatic scene. Nevertheless, the ending is powerful enough to cap an enjoyable evening of opera and to renew one's appreciation of Mozart.",1236988800,3,571,5.355555555555555
7883166,4,6305078610,"Overall, I like this ""Don Giovanni,"" although because a review of the opera generally begins with the title character, I must start with the production's weakest link. Thomas Allen is not the seasoned Don one can see four years later in the 1991 DVD from the Cologne Opera. By 1991, he has perfected his suave seducer approach to the role. I know that Don Giovanni is considered his signature role, but in this La Scala production, he's flat (not in the musical sense). He just has no flare. Since his voice also sounds strained at times, perhaps he was having an off night.

Edita Gruberova's voice is well-suited for Mozart (her singing as Fiordiligi in the Ponnelle film of ""Cosi Fan Tutte"" is stunning). As Donna Anna, she doesn't disappoint. ""Non mi dir"" is a highlight of the second act (the audience thought so too). She puts her heart and soul into the aria, while at the same time maintaining impeccable voice control.

As Donna Elvira, Ann Murray is in magnificent voice (""Mi tradi"" is particularly notable). But, as others have also said, her portrayal of this key character is disappointing. As I've mentioned in other reviews of ""Don Giovanni,"" to me, Donna Elvira is the heart of the opera. Many play her as a madwoman, making her a buffa-type character who provides some comic relief. But that interpretation falls short because it's Elvira who steps in and, with the wild and short aria, ""Ah, fuggi il traditor,"" stops Giovanni from seducing Zerlina. Then again, it is Elvira who, in the great quartet with Don Giovanni, Donna Anna, and Don Ottavio, so rattles Giovanni that he gets too close to Donna Anna, allowing her to see that it's he who seduced her in the dark. And it's Donna Elvira who, right until the end, is ready to forgive this doomed man. However one thinks Elvira should be interpreted, Ann Murray, beautifully though she sings, doesn't develop a character.

Francisco Araiza's gentle tenor voice is a great match for Mozart's music. He plays Don Ottavio as sad and a bit bewildered by the events happening around him. Making exquisite use of pianissimo, his ""Dalla sua pace"" is one of the most moving renditions I've heard (helped by Muti's stirring use of strings at the end).

Susanne Mentzer (Zerlina) has a stunning voice. I'm surprised I haven't heard more of her. Natale de Carolis makes the most of the rather thankless role of Masetto, singing and acting with great energy. As Leporello, Claudio Desderi is excellent. His full-bodied baritone voice shines and he adds wonderful comic touches as the sidekick who both deplores and envies his master.

I like Muti's varied conducting, sometimes brisk and energetic, other times (as in ""Dalla sua pace"") romantic in feel. The ensemble pieces are a highlight of the production due in large part to Muti's leadership on the podium.

Although the DVD's sound quality is excellent (thank goodness), the picture quality is below par and many scenes are too dark (turning up the brightness on your TV helps). The traditional staging and costumes are refreshing in this era of so many modernized productions.

Despite its shortcomings, there is much to admire in this production. Contrary to some, I even enjoy seeing Muti's face superimposed over some of the pieces (he does the same in La Scala's 1989 ""Cosi Fan Tutte""). After all, it's a better view of the conductor than is had by those in the opera house!",1202256000,4,3392,4.81786941580756
