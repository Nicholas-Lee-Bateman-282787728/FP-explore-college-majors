8245426,5,B0012E2GQ4,"What a great, underrated, musician. One of the first concepts he introduced was to play free at the beginning of every practice session, and to record it. This was so helpful to me in at time when I was really frustrated and stagnant.  Need to watch it again (and again) but it's really more a ""concept"" DVD than a ""tabbed out example"" DVDthank God! Very helpful to me.",1400457600,2,369,4.426470588235294

8245428,5,B0012E2GQ4,"Joe Diorio is a legend among guitarists not only for his creative playing, but additional he's one of the best guitar instructor/mentors around today.  Joe besides teaching the musical tools the talks about the creative process and different things to do to help expand creativity.  This DVD touches a little on all those areas plus some of Joe playing.  I had this back when it was a VHS tape and just picked up the DVD and digging it all over again.",1281398400,4,451,4.54320987654321
