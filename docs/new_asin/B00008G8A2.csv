7982831,4,B00008G8A2,"This movie should, in effect, be a strictly chick-flick affair however given the quirky twists and genuinely amusing situations the characters get into it isn't so strictly pigeon-holed. Effectively the movie tells the story of two couples and a couple of other important characters as they try to settle into relationships. Like many romantic comedies the person someone is after isn't necessarily the right one for them. Nor is the morality in the film so cookie cutter clear. Not that there are any actually nasty characters in the film. It's far too polite for that.

A Spanish film and with English sub-titles this is a breezy little film to watch at a time when you just feel like something light and intermittently funny and sultry. Only on a couple occasions are a few premises taken beyond the point of funny to slightly painful. A fun flick.",1394755200,,851,4.828767123287672
7982832,5,B00008G8A2,"I consider this to be one of my favorite Spanish movies. It is the story of two best friends, one of which is secretly in love with the other's boyfriend and embarks on a plot have her friend fall in love with another guy. The whole movie is full of deception, but in a light-hearted way. All of the actors in this movie are attractive and play interesting characters that are likable in their own way. There is a lot of chemistry between all of the characters, and it builds towards a final resolution that is only partially suggested up to that point. This movie leaves you with both a good feeling and with remaining questions. How much did each character know along the way? Who was double-crossing whom? I've seen the movie numerous times and I'm still not sure I have the answers to these questions. At any rate, the ending is happy and so is the viewer at the end. I highly reccomend this movie if you are looking for a good romantic comedy from another country. There are a couple of explicit sex scenes and some loose talk about sexual situations, which seems to be pretty common for Spanish movies.",1227916800,3,1108,4.463054187192118

7982836,5,B00008G8A2,Ok. It was not made in holywood. Ok. It was filmed in a little country named Spain. But...can you imagine that maybe the funiest romantic comedy ever made is this one?
