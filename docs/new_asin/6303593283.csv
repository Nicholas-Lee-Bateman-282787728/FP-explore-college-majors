686058,3,6303593283,"""Rocco and His Brothers,"" a 1960, black and white crime/drama/sports film, is generally considered a primo example of the Italian neo-realist school.  It is a Franco-Italian film that runs 177 minutes.  The picture was directed by Luchino Visconti, who also gave us the much-praised&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-in-Venice/dp/B000LJ78VO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death in Venice</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Leopard/dp/B000VMTMWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Leopard</a>. It was filmed largely in Milan, Italy, the director's home town.

The plot is simple enough.  The widow - and mamma mia to end all mamma mias --Rosaria Parondi, moves to Milan from the poor Southern province of Lucania with her four handsome sons. They come seeking jobs.  Her fifth son, Vincenzo, is already in Milan; he is engaged to the gorgeous young Ginette, played by Claudia Cardinale, in a part very similar to her work in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Deal-on-Madonna-Street-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00005BCJZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Deal on Madonna Street (The Criterion Collection)</a>. Among the four sons are the saintly Rocco, as played by the stunningly young and handsome Alain Delon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Purple-Noon-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B009D0050I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Purple Noon (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Samourai-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000AQKUG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Samourai (The Criterion Collection)</a>.)  Simone, as played by Renato Salvatori, who gives another intense, passionate performance, is the first of the sons to take up boxing, and also the first to take up with Nadia, a beautiful prostitute whom the brothers meet.  Later, Rocco will take up boxing, and be more successful than Simone ever was.  He will also again meet Nadia, start a relationship with her, and make her happier than Simone ever did.  This will cause bitter anger between the brothers, and ultimately result in murder.

The acting is superb.  Mamma Rosaria is played by the Greek actress Katina Paxinou&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/For-Whom-the-Bell-Tolls/dp/B002A9O9GU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a>, who achieves Shakespearian levels of passionate intensity.  Though her performance doesn't really explain the snub to Italy's own Anna Magnani  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rome-Open-City/dp/B002X9CIZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rome, Open City </a>) who's no slouch at burning the screen with her passionate intensity as a mother, either.  Delon, of course, gives a luminous performance as Rocco; his dialog survives dubbing into Italian from his native French.  Nadia is played by the French actress Annie Girardot, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Witches/dp/B004MYFVQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Witches</a>), who gives an Oscar-worthy performance, though she, too, is dubbed from her native French into Italian.

Guiseppi Rotunno's cinematography is stark and dark. Nino Rota's music adds a heartbreaking dimension to the movie that, unfortunately, no matter how you consider it, is a nearly three hour downer.  The great city of Milan has never looked more down, dark, and dirty, and the film makes it seem like there is still a vast amount of bomb damage from World War II that has not yet been addressed.  Most viewers interpret the film's message to be that Milan has corrupted and ruined this honest, Christian peasant family, and I must agree with that reading.  One of the sons, Ciro, by dint of taking night courses, has gotten himself a job at the Alfa-Romeo plant, a job which Simone scorns.  Whyever?  What's wrong with a job at the Alfa Romeo plant?

I studied the Italian Renaissance at university, so I'm probably prejudiced, but it seems to me that Visconti here bites the hand that fed him all his life.  He was born into an ancient, aristocratic Milan family, the son of the Grand Duke of Modrone. (In 1395, Gian Galeazzo Visconti became Duke of Milan; the Visconti family ruled that city for more than a century and a half until the middle of the 15th century).  To return to the present day, Visconti's mother was the heiress to a major pharmaceutical company. So his generation of the family was rich, too.  From his earliest years, he had the privilege of being exposed to major figures in art, music and theatrical circles, such as the  composer Giacomo Puccini, the conductor Arturo Toscanini and the writer Gabriele d'Annunzio.  Visconti joined the Italian Communist party during World War II.  He was outspokenly gay, which was almost unheard of at the time; it seems clear that his high status protected him in this regard.  The director's last partner was the Austrian actor Helmut Berger; earlier lovers included Franco Zeffirelli, the much-admired theatrical, opera and film director.  (There is, in fact, in ROCCO a scene where the gay subtext is very plain, as Simone is taken home by a mysterious sports figure.  A scene that is beautifully lit and shot, by the way.)

Milan, the second-largest city in and of itself in Italy, has been a major world city for millennia.  It was founded about the year 400.  It flourished during the middle ages, from about 1100 on, as a center of the weaving trade, banking and commerce, and has long served as a beacon promising jobs to the poorer southern regions of the nation: in fact, there was a great boom of southerners coming to the city at about the time this movie is set.  The population of the city and its suburbs is today estimated at more than five million.  It is the main industrial, commercial and financial center of Italy and is a major world fashion and design capital. Thanks to its important museums, theaters and landmarks (including the Milan Cathedral, the fourth largest cathedral in the world, and Santa Maria delle Grazie, decorated with Leonardo da Vinci paintings, a UNESCO World Heritage Site), Milan attracts annually more than two million visitors.  I too have visited it, though only as a tourist, and seen a spacious, beautiful, clean and elegant city with excellent public transportation:  I treated myself and my husband to a once in a lifetime experience by attending an opera performance at the city's famed Teatro della Scala.  This is not to deny that Milan may have been the ruination of the Parondi family, but at least Ciro's children, on the strength of his job at Alfa-Romeo, will have a decent chance at life, if not the extraordinary, unlimited chances Visconti himself had.  Well, this film has been very difficult to get for some time now, and it does stand as one of the classics of Italian cinema.  You might want to watch it if you have three hours to spare.",1359936000,2,7065,5.873776908023483
686059,5,6303593283,"Aside from its great portrayal of family life (and, via Rocco, all the hypocrisies and evils therein), the film is also great study in the effects of World War Two on rejiggering the Italian lifestyle, especially with expanded urbanization. In the end, the three older brothers cannot deal with the move from the pastoral life of their youth. Ciro, who is easily the most ethically grounded brother (despite Rocco's constantly being called saintly), can do so, and the film ends with the jury out on young Luca. This is heightened by the fact that we are not shown any images, within the film, of the family's rural roots- not domestic nor geographic. It, as the past always is, is another country. But, many poor critics have mistakenly called the film a `tragedy,' when it clearly is not, for a tragedy demands a sense of grandeur or greatness, and there are no such people in this film. Instead, Rocco And His Brothers shows us dirt poor `real' people scraping to survive (in stark contrast to Visconti's campier melodramas on the rich and powerful), and one of the consequences of survival is that only the fittest make it. Thus, Nadia, Simone, and one suspects Rocco, are doomed. But this fact is far more related to the film's Neo-Realist roots than its melodramatic faux `tragedy.' And that all this is done so deftly, with an economy of narrative setup, is a testament to both the writing and acting in selling what could be a really bad clich.

  Rocco And His Brothers is a great film, which only deepens upon successive viewings (in meaning and complexity) just as its nominal successor (Hannah And Her Sisters) was a quarter century later, but for the same reason, achieved by different means: it takes one into another (past) time and era seamlessly- making any inquiry into what mis-en-scene is seem silly; and in doing so proves it is timeless. And that is usually never too far from greatness.",1359676800,,1909,4.761329305135952
686060,5,6303593283,"One of Alain Delon's earlier movies. And it is still good entertainment today. Many say he cannot act, that it was his looks that got him into pictures. Well, the same was said about Marilyn Monroe. Both are perfected actors and their movies testify to this. Although this is one of his earlier films, it is still one of his best. I am trying to collect every film he has made. Amazon has a lot of them.",1351382400,,403,4.246753246753247
686061,5,6303593283,"Luchino Visconti made some lavish films in his career.  Films with complexity and charm and visual grandeur and are highly regarded as some of the best films cinema has ever offered.  Films like `The Leopard' are still stunning to behold, and `Death in Venice' is a masterpiece of character development.  Of all his films (that I have had the pleasure of viewing), `Rocco and His Brothers' stands apart as the clear `best in show'.  Yes, `Rocco and His Brothers' is equal parts grit and depth to create an outstanding film of emotional complexity that far outlasts its near three hour running length.

Telling the story of four brothers who move to Milan with their recently widowed mother, `Rocco and His Brothers' fleshes these young men out over the course of time to deliver a beautifully composed film that reflects the emotional strain that falls on families as they struggle to adapt to the changing times and support their loved ones.  Dark and earnest, `Rocco and His Brothers' is not always easy to watch.  By that, I mean that the film can be unsettling (especially a particular scene that depicts an act of sexual violence) but it is always engrossing and serves as a rich depiction of life in general.  These young men are fleshed out (some more than others) in a way that completes the picture for the audience, delivering a film that feels full, rich and provocative.

And let's take a minute to talk about Renato Salvatori and Annie Girardot.  How they failed to take home his and hers Oscars is beyond me (and yet not beyond me since this is a film Oscar could easily have dismissed).  That being said, their devoted and emotionally stirring performances cement this film in its roots and serve as two of the finest acting moments in 60's cinema.  As aspiring boxer Simone, Salvatori delivers such heated passion into his performance, nailing his character's sad spiral to the bottom of the barrel; and Girardot attaches herself to her role with flawless intensity.  From her very first scene it is clear the camera is smitten with her, and the way she dissects her character's emotional arcs is outstanding.

As the film draws to a close the weight of the film's tale comes crashing down on us full force and the gritty squander of real life takes over in a way that makes `Rocco and His Brothers' one of the finest films ever made.",1341792000,2,2350,4.713936430317848
686062,5,6303593283,"This is a very engrossing and believable love triangle, about two brothers in love with the same woman (a prostitute) who leave their small peasant village for life in the big city of Milan.  It has very dramatic and passionate moments, particularly toward the end involving a violent, memorable confrontation with the woman played by Annie Girardot.  There are many terrific actors of that era in this movie including handsome Alain Delon and beautiful Claudia Cardinale, and the director Luchino Visconti won a lot of praise for this film (another of his greats is The Damned with Helmut Berger).

686064,5,6303593283,"Here's a textbook definition: Italian ""Neorealismo"" was an explicit movement of film-making characterized by stories set amongst the poor and working class, filmed on location, frequently using nonprofessional actors. Italian neorealist films mostly examined the difficult economic and moral conditions of post-World War II Italy, depicting the changes in the Italian psyche and the conditions of everyday life in poverty and desperation. The major exponents of Neorealism included Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Cesare Zavattini, Luchino Visconti, Giuseppe De Santis, Suso Cecchi d'Amico, Federico Fellini, and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Several of these directors, particularly Fellini and Pasolini, shifted far away from any sort of realism in their later careers. The philosophical tenets expressed by the neorealistic directors ranged from 'Christian Humanism"" to outright Communism (of the Italian variety, of course), but all of them were rightly perceived as radicals, anti-conventional, anti-establishment, anti-capitalist.

Well, them's the facts, ma'am. But the facts don't immediately declare that the ""neorealists"" produced twenty or more enduring classics of the cinema. Artistic masterpieces. No other movement or school of film-making ever achieved so much. Italian cinema was to the film-making of the 20th Century as Italian painting was to the 16th.

""Rocco and his Brothers"" is one of those masterpieces. I don't wish to explicate it, summarize it, deconstruct it, or defend it. I want only to urge everyone to watch it, especially since it has been expertly restored (though the restoration lacks a few minutes of the original). I was 'wowed' by it when I first saw it in the early 60s, at the Brattle Theater, the most important 'classroom' of my college education. I was re-wowed by it last night. It's a 'boxing movie' in part, by the way, so film fans of the kinetic persuasion needn't shun it.

One thing I need to rhapsodize about is the beauty of black-and-white photography. That goes for still photography as well as cinema. Graphic artists like Drer, painters like Andrea Mantegna, and sculptors like Tilman Riemenschneider always knew that 'color' obscured as much as it revealed. Nearly all the Italian Neorealist classics were shot in black-and-white,as a sort of unreal clarification of reality. The starkness of black-and-white -- can anyone doubt? -- emphasized the grimness of the social conditions on display, and intensified the affect of the scenes. If you like, you can ignore the socio-political message, you can smirk at the sentiment, but don't fail to appreciate the sheer visual artistry of ""Rocco and His Brothers"".",1320278400,,2664,5.476885644768856
686065,5,6303593283,"Visconti has always done his best filming in the black and white milieu with his infamous Ossessione, seaside fishermen story La Terra Trema, the romantic Le Notti Bianche, and this masterpiece - Rocco & His Brothers stack up stars against his behemoth, technicolor epics Senso and Leopard. The good news is Annie Girardot as the whore Nadia in this film can light up a fire under any man by himself or a room full of, especially if they are members of five farming brothers and their one very doting ""mamma mia"" mother. Journeying from the most southern rural reaches of Italy venturing into industrial Milan when the country was doubling exponentially each generation, confusion and disorientation rules. Arriving poor and clueless this blank canvass awaits the Visconti wash. He gets down to business showcasing this city in a way we will never see it again.

Accidentally stumbling into their cold apartment early one eve the sumptuous Nadia wrecks havoc amongst the older three brothers as they each have their stab as family bread winner vying as professional boxers per her dropped hints. Visconti wisely uses the boxing ring to showcase the individual strengths and pitfalls of each brother as they war among themselves which drives a stake right through what arrived as a close net family. Bewitching and beguiling, she finally gets her just desserts as we get a decent three full hours of the original finest 1960 Italian black and white celluloid print only as this package from Image Entertainment screams for the Criterion Collection retouch, re-release. If you have three hours more than once or twice, this film deserves, demands, and rewards multiple viewings as classical Italian realism as good as it gets some 50 years later. Subtitles and black and white never looked so good. Visconti may not have been part of the new wave generation of filmmakers but he was a master of his craft and equal to his peers - Fellini, De Sica, and Rossellini.",1314662400,3,1961,4.942424242424242

686067,5,6303593283,"After having seen ""Ossessione"", ""Death in Venice"", and ""Senso""--this is my favorite film by far of Visconti's.  The look of the film is fantastic; shot in black and white, this quality enhances the grittiness of the tale.  Although it is not a highly visual picture, the images serve the story, which is strong, simple and straightforward.  This picture has great momentum, an excellent by score by Nino Rota (that is different than those he composed for Fellini), and superb performances (Claudia Cardinale has a small role as the fierce Ginetta).  As several other Amazon reviewers accurately noted, what holds this film together is the strength of the three leads--the Brandoesque Renato Salvatori (as Simone, the self-destructive bad boy); sweet, saintly and self-sacrificing Alain Delon (as Rocco the good boy; this role made me finally admire him as an actor); and the charismatic Annie Girardot (as Nadia the prostitute).  As the possibly suicidal/girl with a death wish Nadia, Annie Girardot is the star of this film; in crucial moments in this picture, we hear her screaming, ""Voglio morire!"" (I want to die!).  Consequently and unfortunately, in a pivotal and horrifying scene (Chapter 16), she finally gets what she wants (or what she thought she wanted).  Rocco plays the Christ figure in Chapter 17, as he tells the Parondi family how he wants to return to his roots in the South.  In the end--in addition to Simone, Mamma Rosaria (another excellent portrayal by Katina Paxinou), and Rocco are also partly responsible--or at least they feel responsible--for what happens to Nadia.  Again, although I am in agreement with those Amazon reviewers of this film, who noticed its tendency towards melodrama and its quasi-melodramatic performances--somehow I didn't care.  I was willing to forgive, because what is strong in this picture completely overwhelms its minor weaknesses.  Everything fell into place to make this film a masterpiece.

'Rocco and his Brothers' begins as the Parondi clan move from their rustic life in Lucania, in the southern part of Italy, to the bustling northern metropolis of Milan. Head of the clan is the mother, Rosaria, a loud, obnoxious woman who can be best described as a worry wart. She brings her four sons, Rocco and Simone (in their early 20s), Ciro, a teenager, and Luca (about eight), to visit Vincenzo, the older brother who is engaged to Ginetta (played by Claudia Cardinale before she became famous). The expectation is that Vincenzo has arranged for his in-laws to put his mother and siblings up until they can obtain permanent lodging. Unfortunately, Rosaria and Ginetta's mother don't get along and Vincenzo is forced to find other quarters for them. Vincenzo consults a maintenance man who advises him that the family can move into an expensive apartment, stop paying the rent after a month and have the City of Milan then put them into decent housing since anyone who has officially been evicted, must be provided with social services by the City.

'Rocco' is divided into five segments, focusing on each of the brothers. The first segment involves Vincenzo whose character appears in stark contrast to his younger siblings. Whereas the newly arrived Parondi's are very unsophisticated (they've never seen snow before) and regarded as country bumpkins by the residents of Milan, Vincenzo is a virtual cosmopolitan. While he has a small part in the film, Vincenzo serves two important purposes: 1) He is held up as less stable than the the younger and more together domestic pillar, Ciro, in that he is never able to facilitate a reconciliation between his mother and in-laws and ends up marrying Ginetta, more out of obligation than complete love, after she accidentally becomes pregnant; and 2) He ends up bumping into Nadia, the prostitute, in the hallway of the family's apartment building, introducing her to his other brothers.

The next segment focuses on Simone who is the film's evil antagonist. All good melodramas need a good villain and Simone fits the bill to a tee. He dates Nadia for only a short time before she becomes sick of him; despite dumping him, in Simone's mind, Nadia has become his possession. Despite his professed love for Nadia, Simone has no guilt feelings about seducing the cleaning store manager where Rocco works. This is after he borrows (without permission) an expensive shirt from the cleaners to go on his date with Nadia. What's more he steals a broach from the store manager and gives it to Nadia as a gift; only to have it returned by Nadia to Rocco with a message to Simone that she doesn't want to see him ever again. For a short time, Simone has some success as a local boxer but soon falls from grace.

The next segment focuses on Rocco who can best be described as an 'enabler'. At the end of the film, Ciro describes Rocco as a 'saint' but criticizes him for forgiving everyone for their transgressions. Rocco's character is the linchpin of the film and he's not a convincing character at all. At first, he wants nothing to do with boxing as he regards it as sleazy. Rocco eventually wants to return to the South where his kind-hearted nature might flourish. After joining the Army, he runs into Nadia and they develop a hot and heavy relationship. This leads to the most dramatic moment in the film, when Simone rapes Nadia in front of Rocco out of jealousy and Rocco in turn orders Nadia to 'go back' to Simone out of some kind of misguided filial obligation. If you believe anyone would have been so attached to his brother after spending so much time trying to show a downtrodden prostitute a new life (and actually ending up transforming her), then perhaps I can sell you the Brooklyn Bridge. I know it's supposed to be an example of a 'family tragedy', but I just don't believe anyone would have done such a thing, especially after he's a direct witness to his girlfriend being raped. Equally unbelievable is the subsequent scene where Nadia is about to spit in Simone's face and tells him she'll never go back to him--and then ends up kissing him and agrees to be his concubine.

The next to last segment focuses on Ciro who is held up as the only well-adjusted brother in the clan. He is in effect, Rocco's better half. After Simone steals thousands of dollars from his former manager, Rocco (now a successful boxer himself), has his manager guarantee money to pay Simone's debts in exchange for a contract which will obligate him to fight for another 10 years. After Simone kills Nadia, Rocco keeps playing the part of the enabler by insisting that everyone in the family keep quiet. But Ciro wisely informs the police who pick Simone up for Nadia's murder. Ciro serves to restore order to the out of kilter Parondi clan. It's Ciro who also wisely tells Luca, in the final segment, that even returning to the south, the supposed fount of innocence, is not a panacea to life's problems since things are constantly changing and no one can predict the outcome of what life has in store for us.

'Rocco and his Brothers' is very well-acted coupled with excellent cinematography. It should have all the ingredients of a masterpiece but doesn't. That's because its main character is not believable. Sure there are plenty of people like Rocco who would bail their brothers out financially even with the knowledge they had done something wrong; but to order their true love back into a destructive relationship with their brother after he just raped her, that's something I couldn't believe.

One sad addendum: Annie Giardot (Nadia) who was married to Renato Salvatori (Simone) in real life, is still alive but has Alzheimer's and has no memory of her former life.",1293321600,3,5761,4.766533066132265

686099,4,6303593283,"For some reason, I had it in mind that ""Rocco and his Brothers"" was a comedy.  When I got the DVD, it appeared I was mistaken.  When I watched the movie, I KNEW I was mistaken.  My error but no bother; I like a good drama as well.  ""Rocco and his Brothers"" IS a good drama but, as in other Visconti films I've seen, this one is about 40 minutes too long.

The film begins with a rural Southern Italian family arriving in Milan.  They've come to join the eldest son/brother and ended up crashing his engagement party.  Nothing like an over-bearing and demanding mother to show up and spoil the party.  After that, the trials and tribulations eased up and the family of 5 sons and a widowed mother seem to go about their life with more distractions than challenges.  Nonetheless, credit must be given to Director Visconti's talent for showing us the life and times of the Italian worker.

There is a female character that seems as though she will end up being involved with all 5 brothers although the movie centers around her relationship with two of them; Simone and Rocco.  This triangle is the crux of the movie.  Family circles and lover's triangles don't always go together well, be it in geometry or life.  An apparent lack of imagination regarding the script leaves both brothers with the same profession as well as the same girl.  An ironic twist has each gaining the upper hand in the arena that the other one should have excelled in.  By the time the film ends, most viewers will likely feel exhausted (I did) from the emotional impact of the film (as well, for some, as from its' length).

""Rocco and his Brothers"" is a movie worth seeing.  I rank it below ""La Tierra Trema"" and ""Ossessione"" but well above ""The Damned"" and ""The Leopard"".  All of the aforementioned Visconti movies were longer than they should have been.  In some cases, the added footage was a gift.  In others it was a burden.

686101,5,6303593283,"(My copy is a Region 2, European version). A masterpiece by Italian director Lucino Visconti. Intense, emotional, realistic, passionate, dramatic story of an Italian family from the poor south (Lucania) who immigrates to the northern city of Napoli.

A 3-hour film that, alternatively, focuses on each one of the sons of the 'mamma'. If ""Il Gattopardo"" was the drama of the aristocratic Italian family from the south, this one corresponds to the poor family also from the south. Both are cinematic gems, worthy of being included among the best in film history. Although a long film, its intensity never diminishes. Every shot is full of emotion and meaningful and beautiful.

The only thing that disappointed me a little was the way it ended, the last half-hour. It's more of an open ending, no conclusion.

One of the most gorgeous films in b/w that I've seen. Italy to the bones.",1167264000,4,881,4.899328859060403
686102,5,6303593283,"If the Neo Realism was born with a forgotten film of 1934 named Tony directed by Jean Renoir, you can read frequently that Roberto Roselini has been designed as his Italian father. In these terms, if we assume the cycle initiates with Paisa (1945), Roma citt apperta and Germania Anno Zero, Vittorio De Sica would follow the traces, many people tend to forget a hidden film of Visconti dated in 1943  -Ossesione- , and best known as ""The postman always rings twice.""

In this sense Visconti knocked the door before Roselini, and his brilliant career,  during three decades until The innocent in 1976 that would constitute his Final Opus..

Rocco is a powerful, magisterial and still actualized film about the life and illusions of Rocco trying to bring back his family the lost dignity. Somehow the striking performance of Alain Delon in this movie meant for him his leap to fame, after his shining acting in Purple Noon 1959.

To talk about the art and influence of Luchino Visconti, his slender camera traveling and expressive close ups woul surpass the limits of this brief comment.

686103,5,6303593283,"Luchino Visconti is a master of the epic, however, his epic style always takes place within a family and always leads downward towards an inevitable doom. His movies tends to remind us of the 'Godfather' but Visconti, dare I say, even gets closer to the marrow of the issues than Coppola does at his best (I am nevertheless, a big fan of 'the Godfather'). To Visconti the finest details of a film are of the utmost importance - you can watch a film like 'Rocco' or the 'Leopard' several times and still miss things. Visconti's cinema is one which reveals itself in every character, in every piece of furniture, in every moment.

'Rocco and his Brothers' is if not my favorite Italian film - certainly one of the top ten. To see the brilliant camera work of Giussepe Rotuno combined with Visconti at his peak is simply magnificent. The film itself is extremely radical in structure - slowly revealing itself - focusing sometimes on what appear to be small conversations - but everything is woven to make a perfect whole - wherein the seams are all neat - and though at times are barely hanging together - it always holds as if there is some greater purpose in mind. Visconti reveals much about both the family and their society. One could be bold and comment that the whole film is about fighting to survive (sometimes fighting one another). Life - sometimes- is like a boxing match but the match is sometimes not the one you choose to fight - you are thrown into it and some of the factors working for or against you are money, pride, love, and family.",1101859200,14,1552,4.542857142857143

686173,4,6303593283,"""Rocco and His Brothers"" is certainly a grand movie. The acting is simply superb, especially that of Annie Girardot - her character is passionate, erotic and strong, exactly the kind of woman who can rouse such fatal feelings and change fates even though she's a prostitute.
I especially admire Visconti for being able to create such an accurate and vivid portrait of Italians. I could never understand their passions, their love-hate relationships, their family ties, honesty and betrayal being so close together. Which comes first - family or justness? In short, I don't think I'll ever be able to understand the way they lead their lives and their strange outlook on life. To an ordinary viewer, like me, most of the characters, ESPECIALLY Rocco, seem to be insane...
You'd probably like to know why I didn't give this truly unforgettable movie 5 stars. The answer is simple: it was difficult to watch. Painful almost. I found myself wishing I could kill one of the main characters more than half a time. There was no relief of tension. The movie was quite long. And - I simply cannot understand the way Italians live and treat each other. It's beyond me.
I'm glad I saw this movie; it had a great impact on me. However, it was so very 'heavy' I won't watch it again for a long time... but I will. Sometime.",1058659200,9,1310,4.675324675324675
686174,3,6303593283,"""Rocco and his Brothers"" is one of Visconti's most famous films, yet it seems to fall flat. Four brothers and their mother journey to northern Italy to join their brother Vincenzo. While there, one amazing even after another occurs to test the bonds of the family.
The film is divided into five sections, one for each of the brothers yet the film really centers around Rocco and Simone. Simone plays the stereotypical bad boy. He comes to the north and begins to see a prostitute and to steal. His criminal impulses lead him to rape his ex-girlfriend (who at the time is dating Rocco) which seems completely out of character. Yes he has a bad streak but the scene seems contrived. He rapes the girl to hurt noth her and Rocco and then proceeds to punch Rocco to the point of unconsciousness. Up until this point he seems more of a rebel and than suddenly he turns into a hard-core criminal. Rocco's character isn't much better. He is depicted in a saintly matter and while this is purposeful, he saintliness is so extreme that one gets aggravated with the character. He constantly forgives Simone and constantly ""turns his other cheek"". In short, all the character are extremely stereotyped and are manipulated to fit the script instead of being believable. Visconti just tries to cram too much into one film and in doing so loses track of his characters.
The only thing that saves the film in any way is the acting. The two main brothers, Simone and Rocco, and Nadia are all played remarkabley well inspite of the despicable script. Annie Girardot who plays Nadia puts in the best performance and makes the viewer wonder if she is the only sane person in all of Italy.",1051660800,3,1669,4.641891891891892

686176,4,6303593283,"For years now my favorite Luchino Visconti film has been ""Ludwig"". His grand sweeping epic. I've always felt that was his most ambitious film. True, Visconti has made other film that are great in their scope like ""The Leopard"", or ""The Damned"". But, none has touched me on such a personal level as ""Ludwig"", and then I saw this film. While, I admit, I don't think it's as grand as ""Ludwig"", ""Rocco and his Brothers"", is a powerful, emotional, saga.
 Luchino Visconti is a director whom I've always had wonderful things to say about. He is one of my favorite directors of all time. And I always feel there is something to admire about all of his films, even those I may not be crazy about, I still found something good to say about them.
 ""Rocco and his Brothers"" is a story about a family of five brothers and their mother who move from the country into the city. The brothers are played by Alain Delon (Rocco), Renato Salvatori (Simone), Spiros Focas (Vincenzo), Max Cartier (Ciro), & Rocco Vidolazzi (Luca). The movie creates little episodic chapters for each brother. Telling you briefly something about them, in about 30-40 minutes.
 Now, the only fault I have with the film is, I feel it doesn't devote enough time to all the brothers. For instance characters like Ciro or Luca are not given much depth. Very little is known about them. The role of Vincezo is so-so, over-all, it is better than the other two brothers. What really makes the movie so wonderful are the three focal characters; Rocco (Delon), Simone (Salvatori) & Nadia (Annie Girardot) a woman of the streets who begins a love affair with Simone, and then starts a rival between two of the brothers, I honestly don't want to give too much away. But they have the best parts. It is because of them the movie has as much heart as it does. Visconti does an amazing job directing them. And it is because of the story-line concerning these three characters that I can ""forgive"" the film's short comings with the other characters.
 Though the film is hard to find, just keep looking. It will all be worth it. I personally wouldn't recommend buying the film on vhs...if you have a dvd player, your better off buying the dvd... . I was lucky and saw the movie on TCM.
 ""Rocco and his Brothers"" is a film Visconti fans should be pleased with. Those of us who have seen will never forget the impact it left on us the first time we saw it.
 The rest of the cast includes; Katina Paxinou (Rosaria, the mother), Alessandra Panaro (Ciro's fiancess), and Claudia Cardinale (who plays Ginetta, Vincenzo's wife. She of course would be a major star appearing in other Visconti films like ""Conversation Piece"", and ""The Leopard"", also ""Big Deal On Madonna Street"" and Fellini's ""8 1\2"")
  Bottom-line: One of Luchino Visconti's most absorbing dramas. A film of tremendous heart and passion. With standout performances by it's three lead stars.",1046563200,14,2894,4.671905697445973
686177,4,6303593283,"Luchino Visconti's Marxist take on the changing Italian society circa 1960 was one of the most controversial and influential movies of the early 60's.  Like LA DOLCE VITA it caused a sensation in the US and made an instant, international star of Alain Delon.  Visconti mixes Old Testament themes starting with the expulsion from Eden & Cain and Abel, throws in lots of Dostoyevsky & even some of Bunuel's VIRIDIANA.  It's quite a stew but I never heard anyone say they were bored.  As the mother Katina Paxinou who was Jean Simmons' vile governess in THE INHERITANCE chews up enough scenery for 10 movies.  Annie Giradot playing a prostitute gives such a vibrant performance that you wonder why she appeared here in only 2 or 3 movies over the next 30 years.  Alain Delon's Rocco is a beautiful Prince Myshkin but he's very bland.  As Simone his immediate older brother Renato Salvatore exudes so much animal magnatism he may have you jumping out of your skin.  When he seduces Rocco's middleaged employer (to rob her) half the audience wishes they were she.  Giuseppe Rotunno's beautiful black & white cinematography often acts as a commentary on the action especially in the scenes of more than graphic violence.  Nino Rota wrote the fine score.",1027296000,22,1247,4.839622641509434

686179,3,6303593283,"Alternately striking and tedious, ""Rocco and His Brothers"" is an awkward blend of social realism and operatic melodrama. Presumably an attempt to dramatize the social consequences of Italy's internal Diaspora from South to North, the film suffers from the contradictory aims of trying to make one family socially typical while also individually compelling. All of the characters are at one level ""types,"" whose dramatic function is to reveal aspects of social transformation. Most, however, are also burdened with ""individual"" character touches that seem both contrived and overwrought.
Nowhere is this more the case than the central conflict between the unbelievably saintly Rocco (Alain Delon) and his wastrel brother Simone (Renato Salvatori) over the love of a prostitute, Nadia (Annie Girardot). The hackneyed triangular situation is compelling thanks to the strength of the performances and the larger-than-life passions it unleashes. Unfortunately, none of it feels very ""Realistic,"" in the sense of revealing aspects of experience through observed behavior and detail. We are far too aware of the broad brush strokes for the situation to work as anything other than heavy-handed, if undeniably effective, manipulation. The emotions are so out of keeping with the film's social goals as to tear the film apart. Or, to put it differently, there are no doubt many love triangles among the working class, and some may well result in the tragedies ""Rocco"" dramatizes. It is simply that this situation as depicted is not convincing as typical, nor does it reveal as much about social reality as it does about the filmmaker's desires and ambitions.
Visconti was one of the ""Big Three"" of Italian NeoRealism (the others being Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio de Sica). His work usually demonstrated a tension between his social realist interests (he was a member of the Italian Communist party) and his experience as a world renown opera director steeped in the Western aesthetic tradition. (He was also a Duke with a family lineage going back to Charlemagne's era.) These contradictions are at work in varying degree in all of his work, but are rarely as apparent as in ""Rocco."" The film is never anything less than a committed work of art. It may not make much sense, but it certainly isn't sloppy or shoddy. It is, however, almost fatally uneven, the perhaps inevitable result of a director uncertain where he wanted to go. Visconti's greatest work, ""The Leopard,"" his next film but one after ""Rocco,"" finally resolved that question. So when can we look forward to that appearing on DVD?",1008115200,14,2589,5.196172248803828
686180,3,6303593283,"The long-awaited DVD release of Visconti's great novel-like film is here. Sad to report, it is something of a disappointment.
The film itself looks quite good, transferred from a well-preserved source. But this is the 168-minute version of ""Rocco e i suoi Fratelli""--12 minutes of the original 180 minutes have been cut. To be fair, this version has been the ""standard"" on VHS for some time, presumably Image derived it from the source of earlier releases. It is really unfortunate that a full-length print could not be used here. Moreover, there are zero extras on the disc: just a static, hastily-produced menu. The English-only subtitles are removable.
Visconti's film is traditional. It is a contemporary of ""Shoot the Piano Player"", ""L'Avventura"" and ""La Dolce Vita"", yet it has virtually nothing in common with them. Watching ""Rocco"" is like reading a 19th century novel, with chapters devoted to the five brothers of the title. All characters are well-drawn, the film is beautifully shot, acting is often brilliant. There are many unforgettable moments in what feels like a vast, panoramic view of several years in one family's history. One element Visconti shares in this film with Antonioni is the great Italian theme of transition from the old world to the modern world. Characters are forced to accept change, change themselves, or perish.
