6074218,4,B00GEKO51U,"Going into this movie, I thought it was just going to be another Vince Vaughn's movie with his jokes left and right, which I would forget easy after, but no it's not that at all. In reality, it was much more. Yes, there were some jokes, and they were used well to represent the point of the movie. The main point of this movie is about family and that's exactly what you'll see here.

David (Vaugh), who is lost in life and has problems with his family and his love, needs to grow up and be more responsible. In the movie, you will see how he will grow into loving his family; how he will become a better person, how to he can live and love a family; and then have one of his very own. No sir, this is NOT another C- comedy movie, it's more than that. I do recommend this movie.",1387584000,,778,4.0519480519480515
6074219,4,B00GEKO51U,"Say what you will about Delivery Man one thing it has going for it is an original premise. That a man somehow in his careless youth provided 693 samples to a sperm bank which resulted in 533 children, of which 140 or so are engaged in a class action lawsuit to discover the identity of Starbuck their daddy. Meanwhile he has debts, and commitment issues with a girlfriend.

I went to this movie expecting to see a regular movie, with punch lines and much laughter, the kind of comedy one often goes to see, full of laughs yet instantly forgettable. What I did not expect was a sentimental and somewhat touching movie. I doubt if the Vince Vaughn of 10 years ago could have pulled off this role in quite this way. Yet at times this movie transcends comedy and becomes touching without ever becoming maudlin.

To tell you too much about it would be to render an injustice to the spontaneity of your experience. I found it a worthwhile, and enjoyable experience, and am glad I saw it, and I think most people will feel the same way, and it is an original premise, in a world where recycled premises are beaten to death through overuse, and if you're like me you long for something you have not seen before. Glad to see a comedy that breaks with convention.

I think you will love it and I hope this was helpful.",1387324800,10,1308,4.396694214876033
6074220,4,B00GEKO51U,"David (Vince Vaughn) has trouble delivering meat, but not fathering children. As a donor he has sired 533 children of which 142 remarkably including a mentally handicapped somewhat vegetated kid in a wheel chair, demand to know who their biological father is. David has financial problems and a pregnant girlfriend. David is given the profiles of the 142. He visits his biological children, helping them out without telling them who he is.

This is a lukewarm formulaic comedy. It shied away from an overly crude ""wrestle the dragon alone"" humor to make a film that more of the family could see. It is a story for modern times as we experience extended families. In David's world all men are truly brothers. More of a light feel good drama than comedy.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. PG-13 due to the theme.",1386460800,,821,4.774647887323944

(lol) I thought Vince did great in this - I thought it really showed his acting chops.  I wasn't really familiar with this Chris Pratt guy but I gotta say...I liked the dude. He was just as hilarious as Vince. So just go see it. (lol)

6074222,5,B00GEKO51U,"I saw this movie in the theater tonight.  Without going into the details of the movie - let me tell you how I feel about it.  I really have never been a fan of the star - Vince Vaughn.  I anticipated that his character David Wozniak would be a total screw-up - and would stumble through the movie, messing with the lives of his biological children.  I was HALF right - he WAS a royal screw-up, but as he 'stumbled' through the mess of having 533 children - you could see him grow, and improve himself.  He sought to be a better man, a better father, and a generally better human being all the way around.  This was a fabulous feel good movie.  Seeing this movie gave me a better outlook on life.  If a screw-up like David could turn around - and at least head in the right direction, then so can I and others. The portrayals by the other actors seemed genuine and believable.  I wouldn't take younger children to this show - it would probably take too much explaining.  I WILL look at future shows Vince Vaughn in a different light.",1385683200,3,1032,4.27319587628866
6074223,4,B00GEKO51U,"Very well acted and often poignant. Vince Vaugh, as usual, has the charisma and empathy to make you care about the character he plays. The fellow who plays his best buddy as well as his lawyer deserves an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor. The courtroom scene where he is wearing a suit two sizes too small is perfecty directed, cut and shot. the press interview after the case decided is one of those classic moments in film that sits frozen in memory just like ""show me the money"" when he says just a bit too much.
it was also nice to see a movie where the producer gave so many young, talented actors and actresses a chance at a film role. let's also not forget the handicapped, wheelchair bound person. Be prepared to have a lump in your throat.",1385596800,,766,4.439716312056738
6074224,3,B00GEKO51U,"For years now, weve seen Vince Vaughn play the role of the charismatic smart aleck.  He was a smooth talking mediator in Wedding Crashers, a bad boyfriend in The Break-Up, and quite possibly the laziest of all athletes in Dodgeball:  A True Underdog Story.  Love him or hate him, hes certainly been consistent playing the same old character in his roles.  While he is still highly enjoyable and obviously a gifted entertainer, his flare is no longer enough to sell movie tickets or justify home video purchases.  It was only a matter of time before he starred in one too many roles, all portraying the same tiresome character, before things went stale.  And, even though his newest film, Delivery Man, is an average addition to his resume, it provides more than enough evidence that Vaughn needs to move on to a more challenging genre in acting.

Ken Scott writes (with Martin Petit) and directs Delivery Man, a remake of the 2011 Canadian comedy, Starbuck (which was also directed by Scott).  The film stars Vince Vaughn as David Wozniak, a down-on-his-luck character that is basically coasting through life.  Upon meeting David, its quickly pointed out that hes not someone that can be heavily relied upon  for his job, running errands, or providing support for his girlfriend, Emma (Cobie Smulders).  He works for his fathers meat company, delivering meat to customers  at least thats what hes supposed to be doing when hes not growing pot in his apartment or ducking debt collectors.

Upon returning to his apartment one day, David is paid a visit by a lawyer that informs him that hes the father of 533 children, many of whom have petitioned the court to identify their father.  As it turns out, after making many, many donations as sperm donor (under the alias Starbuck), the clinic used his sperm for nearly all of their clients.  The lawyer also gives him a packet with the biographies of each of the children that is named in the pending lawsuit.  Naturally, his best friend and on-again, off-again lawyer, Brett (Chris Pratt) recommends that he not look at the bios  but does David listen?  Well, it wouldnt be much of a movie if he did.

Naturally, David takes it upon himself to start following a select few of his children, just to see what they're like and learn what theyve done with their lives.  Of course, it wouldnt be a Vince Vaughn film without a little bit of sports in it, so the first of his children that he visits is an NBA basketball player, named Adam (Dave Patten).  Next up, theres Josh (Jack Reynor), a coffee shop employee with aspirations of being an actor.  Then, David acts as a pizza delivery man to visit his daughter, Kristen (Britt Robertson), who turns out to be a troubled drug abuser that recently got a job at a department store.  Finally, theres Viggo (Adam Chanler-Berat), who discovers Davids identity as his father, but simply wants to keep all of his fathers attention for himself.

From there, this film focuses on the court proceeds and the predicament surrounding David paying his debts vs. revealing his identity to his children.  It would be nice to say theres more to this story than meets the eye, but sadly theres very little substance here.  Like many films these days, if youve seen the movie trailer, youve already received about 90% of the plot, and it shouldnt be too difficult to imagine how this film turns out.  After all, nine times out of ten a Vince Vaughn film will send you home with a smile on your face, or depending how judgmental you are about him  a begrudging frown.

Obviously, Delivery Man is a comedy, and there are a few brief moments of humor  but they don't come from Vaughn, they come from supporting cast member Chris Pratt.  Sadly, his character spends nearly the whole film preaching to Vaughns character about not doing anything stupid, yet Pratts character eventually commits about the dumbest possible act in the history of lawyering.  The act in question is funny, but would be best described as downright stupid and unbelievable.  To be honest, his lines aren't really even that humorous, just silly.  However, for the moviegoers that enjoy tame PG humor as opposed to the unfiltered sex talk that youd find in a recent film like Were the Millers, Delivery Man will be much more to your liking.

Overall, Delivery Man is the definition of an average comedy with more of the same from Vince Vaughn.  Hes just as entertaining as he was in his previous ten films.  Vaughn has more charisma than possibly anyone else in Hollywood, but he needs to take on a drama or maybe even a horror movie to change things up a bit. While this film does provide a clever concept, the endless array of punch-lines only solidify it as being nothing more than a petty, witless attempt at making a moderately compelling piece of entertainment.  You can only call so many movies entertaining for so long before you come to the realization this particular statement is just the nicest way you can think of to call a movie boring or uneventful.  Never the less, Vaughns fans should check this out at their leisure, while everyone else should feel free to add it to a list of movies to rent  eventually.

6074225,3,B00GEKO51U,"""This one was an unexpected choice as I did not anticipate to see it coming soon and I seen on the judgment that I could do multiple things near the town of the cinema. Nothing to brag about to the choir but Vince Vaughn's performance as an estranged and enthusiastic man (David Wozniak) in the American remake of the film, Starbuck or Delivery Man, is what keeps the film going.

Some of the things that made a draw for me over the overhyped, overrated, and annoying Hunger Games: Catching Fire was Delivery Man's closeness (as rumoured by Ken Scott, the director behind the original and this remake) to the original, Vaughn being a funny stand-alone comedian even without a posse or Owen Wilson, and the idea that I would get some of the American jokes better than the exclusively French-Canadian/Quebecois ones.

Nevertheless, it is the story of practically a schmuck and loner who wants to lend a helping hand and his persona captures it well and good performances all round from the encounters Wozniak meets. However, the film does suffers on the corners a bit by starting off too suddenly with the biological father of 533 children case with the mysterious intruder and the pregnant wife toward the end (as I do not support or believe in marriage or childbearing when you know the world is overpopulated and the divorce rate is 50%+). It felt encouraging to know the similarity paved for its remake (which are forms of filmmaking I have hang-ups about) and how the sperm donor concept would work out for comedy without it being a raunchfest (a la Hangover).

I wish there would be more of Vince Vaughn's crazy antics and humour present here but this film is commendable and believable enough in a way like he was in The Internship, a pretty good high-concept comedy that was lambasted and mocked by antics unfortuntately. While the film is fine and watchable from the start, it does suffer from things that are personal and possibly the whole idealism element and happy ending did not give it the edge it needed given Vaughn's persona.

Still, considering how much Catching Fire will fill up the auditoriums, why not pay $10.50 to go see Delivery Man (or see the original on Netflix) or even Philomena, another comedy-drama of epic proportions, instead.""",1385337600,2,2260,4.787179487179487
6074226,4,B00GEKO51U,"Everyone needs family, for support, love or help. The movie Delivery Man all emphasizes these factors. The plot follows David (Vince Vaughn) who delivers meat to businesses; his struggle is having a stable family for himself. His girlfriend has is pregnant but does not let him be the father. David then finds out there are 533 children who are his biological children due to his past donations to a donor bank. He decides to visit each of the children to see where they are now. But these children are not kids; they are all in their late teens. He decides to make a meeting date where all 533 children can come visit each other. He creates the name Starbuck as the name of the mystery father. These children then demand to know who their father is but the law of the court denies the release of father. The ending is bitter sweet, thus you have to watch this movie.

The moral of the story is to keep close people closer to you because they might help you. During the movie there are many scenes devoted to show what condition each child is presently enduring. From a musician to a beauty stylist all the children have different careers which are so important on effecting Davids emotional connection to each child. One child keeps David continuously visiting, the child with special needs. The child is in a care center and has no one visit until David comes. During the movie, David and special needs child create a family sense and warmth. This part of the movie stuck with me and really pulled my heart strings.

Overall the movie emphasizes on the importance of family. Furthermore, it also gives the audience the message of caring for other people you might not know. The comedy is apparent in this movie, but the jokes were a bit for adults. I rate this age range from 13 and above, due to the story and the adult jokes. I give this movie 4 star out of 5 because of the strong themes but awkward adult humor.

6074227,5,B00GEKO51U,"Maybe I'm a purist... but we soooo loved ""Starbuck,"" the Canadian original of this movie, that we were pretty hostile when we heard about this remake. This time we're in luck. Writer/director Ken Scott (""Starbuck"") used Martin Petit's original screenplay as his source, so we know this beloved script is in good hands, AND they didn't exaggerate or overplay anything as so often happens in American remakes. Whew!

Briefly, a young man made over 500 anonymous donations to a sperm bank a couple of decades ago because he was paid for each contribution (wait until you figure out how he used the money). Then, through a technical bungle, his were the only donations used for a year. Now, 142 of his offspring have filed a class action lawsuit to identify their father.

Here is the cast:
  *  Vince Vaughn (""Couples' Retreat"") David really needed the money back when he lived next door to the sperm bank, now he's a delivery man for his father's butcher shop, kinda going nowhere, but happily contented and blithely unaware of that former bungle.
  * Chris Pratt (""Zero Dark Thirty"") is Brett, our hero's best friend. He washed out of legal practice but wants to defend David and help him maintain his anonymity. Since the news hit the tabloids about that lawsuit, Starbuck has become a punch line!
  * Cobie Smulders (""Safe Haven"") is Emma, the woman in his life. Now that this cop is pregnant, she is having second thoughts about David's ability to be a good father. She thinks she would be better off going it alone.

This has a very, very large cast: we meet David's father and two married brothers, and then, when he takes a peek in the envelope that identifies all the parties to the lawsuit, we meet a number of those offspring. The casting director for this one did a great job!

Rated PG-13, we see absolutely no sweaty bodies, hear no gunshots, endure no vehicular mayhem and suffer through no blowie uppie stuff. (See my original review of ""Starbuck"" on JayFlix.net for any other comments.)

This film is absurd, heartwarming, funny and great entertainment. I am so relieved they kept the original Canadian team and didn't screw this up.

Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available so I can own both the Canadian version and the American one.",1383782400,48,2257,4.712468193384224
6074228,2,B00GEKO51U,"This film is about the hypothetical situation a man would be in if every single one of his ejaculatory emissions ended in the conception of a child, and what all those adult children would think and feel about their Father who is absentee their whole lives.

As a Christian I do not know the moral standpoint on sperm donation, but I will say--that despite a few quirks this is a very good movie. It was well put together, and humorous and a real tear-jerker as sisters and brothers band together and bond with their father in a very positive way. This movie proves that love of family and the bond of fatherhood, sisterhood and brotherhood always wins and saves the day!

6074297,4,B00GEKO51U,"'David' (Vince Vaughn) works as a delivery man for the family meat business
his life is a shambles, not only is he a useless Deliveryman, he's also $80,000 in debt.
There is nobody out there that can or will bail him out, he's got zero collateral.
One day he arrives home to find a lawyer waiting for him, several years ago he had been a
sperm donor, in fact a regular contributor, for payment of course.
The Lawyer informs him that his sperm had been used to help over 600, he'd actually fathered
533 children, 142 of which want to know who their biological father really is, the decision on
whether they find out or not, is 'David' himself, or should he leave the 142 wondering who
'Starbuck' really is ?
He is handed a folder with the profile of the 142, his friend 'Brett' (Chris Pratt) advises him not
to open the folder.
In the meantime 'David's' on-off girlfriend 'Emma' (Cobi Smulders) informs him that she's
pregnant....mmm,
Well curiosity gets the better of 'David' he opens the folder, then one by one try's to actually
meet, see each of the 142 without them being aware of who he is.
After a visit to a counselling meeting by the agency for the 142, several of the siblings that had
met him gather around him after the meeting, as a friend, despite 'Brett's help and advice,
'David's' family is about to expand some.
'David' at last begins to have a purpose in life, his love life with 'Emma' and the Baby also looks
to be falling into place.
One hell of a lot of 'Birthday' Cards to buy ?
It's a decent watch with several amusing moments and situations, maybe not as funny as it
might have been.
Good Picture and Sound Quality.

6074304,4,B00GEKO51U,"Meat-delivery guy David finds out he's fathered 530+ kids from the 690+ sperm donations to a sperm bank years ago. He also finds out that his girlfriend is pregnant with his baby. He's been known for being a slacker but he's realizing that he wants to be more involved in his kids lives. However, he's unsure how much he wants to be involved. Especially with the impending legality of his anonymity as a sperm donor.

Glad I put it on because the basic plot from some Amazon reviews sounded iffy to me. Vaughn's acting, the overall positive message of the movie, and the improvement of David's character from irresponsible & immature guy to a more considerate & responsible man made this movie a heartwarming one for me. It made me see past the character's questionable past choices & root for his overall welfare as well as those of his many kids, girlfriend, and family.

6074311,2,B00GEKO51U,"It's been a while since I watched a movie I couldn't understand even a *little* bit, but Delivery Man is one of those films.  First of all this isn't a comedy despite all the reviews that say otherwise.  It's a drama with lots of emotion.  The humor is there every so often but it's incredibly subtle to the point of barely even being noticeable.  It's about a man played by Vince Vaughn who finds out he has over 500 children because a long time ago he donated his sperm to a sperm bank literally hundreds of times.  Wow, that's what I call a sexually overactive drive!  The only part that really made sense is the knowledge Vince receives that he has all these children.  Whatever happens next... for the next hour and 30 minutes... is obviously way over my head.

Vince has a friend who wants to be an actor for a career, so this friend (who's personality never made a bit of sense to me because it was hard to figure out if he was being humorous or serious) often leaves to follow his aspirations.  Vince meets one of his biological sons and they play basketball and get along great until Vince, being the typical uninteresting deadbeat uncaring loser that he comes across as, messes up any opportunity to redeem himself with his son by mentioning that it's time to spend time with his real family.  Vince saves a woman's life after a botched suicide attempt after delivering a pizza to her.  Not sure if this woman was his real daughter or pretend daughter in an attempt to get her to clean her act up, because it wasn't really clear.  Later the story shifts into counter suing... somebody for some unclear reason, while his acting friend finds out he likes guys (and I thought he was joking at first but apparently not).

Then there's several occasions when all of Vince's sons and daughters get together for special occasions and meetings to rejoice in Vince's profession of meat delivery service.  It's all highly unusual, confusing and mind-boggling.  The story goes absolutely nowhere, the drama fails because nothing understandable happens (everyone feels like they're just going through the motions while accomplishing very little) and at least there's *some* kind of logic and resolution when Vince meets back up with a brunette woman that he made pregnant.  The story touches on this subject in the beginning but doesn't continue with it until a certain recess scene, and even more at the end.  Vince's father is another questionable aspect.  Was he Russian because of his accent, and why?

The writing is incredibly unfocused and unclear nearly 100% of the time with the exception of the brunette woman.  I'm guessing instead of laying things out logically for the viewer, the writers expect people who have experience in sperm bank donations and children to be able to put the pieces together.  Unfortunately for me I don't have experience in either one so it doesn't work.  I was lost.  The humor often falls flat to the point that it's impossible to refer to any of this as humor.  Vince comes across like a deadbeat dad constantly... always.  That's his character.  It doesn't seem like a suitable enough character for a movie.

I just don't get Delivery Man at all but this movie has mostly received positive reviews, so don't listen to anything I say.  However if anyone out there in cyberspace would like to drop a comment and explain the storyline in easy worded detail, please do!  I'd love to know what I just watched for an hour and 40 minutes.  At least the credits roll with a memorable song in T.Rex's ""Light of Love!""  Awesome band there folks.  Awesome band.",1441584000,,3589,4.6928

6074358,3,B00GEKO51U,I saw this movie Friday night Bill and I rented it. So I went into watching this movie thinking it was going to be your typical Vince Vaughn movie. But I was wrong this movie was complete comedy. This had both the story as well as the comedy to it and it even brought you a few tears. This is a remake of the 2011 movie Starbuck. Now this movie is about a man who sires 633 kids because the sperm bank he donated too used his sperm for all their clients. So then what happens is they want to know who the donor is and his name they know is Starbuck. Nothing else and he stalks his kids secretly and finds out about them and even helps some of them out. Now I don't want to give away too much of the movie if you haven't seen it. But there are very funny parts and then theres tear jerker parts. But I can actually say that I was very happy about this part that Vince played. Its much better then the slap knee comedies he usually does. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend you to see it. I cannot wait til it comes out on DVD so that I can enjoy it over and over again. I think that this movie should have gotten better reviews and comments on it. But because so many people are used to his other comedies they were disappointed.,1428278400,,1234,4.0

Does it sound like a reasonable premise?  The casting and acting is as bad as the premise.  I didn't enjoy seeing fatherhood being slighted when immediately after his marriage proposal to his girlfriend who just delivered a baby she says, ""you can be a daddy on probation.""  I was inclined to turn off this movie during most of it but I like Vince.  It fell short of comedic and dramatic expectations for me.

6074412,3,B00GEKO51U,"Vince Vaughn seldom fails, as an endearing failure of a man.  It is always a joy to watch him as an actor.  This comedy is no exception.  Chris Pratt who is almost unrecognisable from his role in ""Guardians of Galaxy"" is equally engaging as his wannabe lawyer friend.  Cobie, the actress who played VV's girlfriend, is lovely and promising.  The story has its limitations based on a single premise.  Another aggravating problem is the film is way too long.  86 mins instead of 105 would be a much better film.  Watchable.",1415491200,,521,4.648351648351649

His 2013 effort, Delivery Man finds him the unwitting biological father/sperm donor to 533 offspring due to a mix-up at the clinic some 20+ years prior. Suffice to say the plot is preposterous, the writing beyond flaccid and the acting (if you can call it that) is so toxic, it should come with a warning from the Surgeon General.

6074542,3,B00GEKO51U,"Vince Vaughn isn't the greatest actor but I like to watch him in roles that suit him.  This seemed like one of those films that would play to his strengths.  He plays David Wozniak who works in the family run butcher shop in NYC.  He's a one dimensional loser who blows his deliveries, pisses off his pregnant girlfriend Emma (Colbie Smulders) and owes loan sharks $80K.  It's never quite clear how he ran up such a tab, but OK.

His best friend is Brett (Chris Pratt), a sometime lawyer, sometime stay at home dad.  Brett has his hands full with 4 kids and cautions David of the perils of parenthood.  Suddenly David is faced with a lawsuit filed by 142 young adults who want to know who their father is.  It seems that years ago, in order to collect some cash, David sold his sperm and due to some error by the fertilization clinic, it was improperly distributed and he now has fathered 533 children.  An interesting, if unlikely premise, explored a couple years earlier in a Canadian movie called ""Starbuck"" which was David's pseudo name.  The same director, Ken Scott, comes to Hollywood and tells the same story with better known actors.

Actually I found the film pretty interesting early on as David began his search to learn something about his progeny.  Obviously we don't get too close to any of them or we would have a TV series instead of a 105 minute movie.  Actually that would probably be a better idea.  This movie however takes a turn as to whether David and Brett will fight the lawsuit (confidentiality agreement) and in fact, sue the clinic.  The movie is sold as a comedy but the laughs are few and far between.  Some of the antics, Pratt especially, will induce some smiles and even a chuckle but that's about it.  There are also some tender and emotional moments, but one in particular is so obviously geared to producing a tear, it's nonsensical.  I really can't recommend the movie, but it is watchable depending on what you're in the mood for.

The Blu ray transfer has a 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  There is certainly nothing wrong with the picture.  The detail is good and it has no unusual deficiencies.  Having said that, there's nothing that stands out either.  A good quality picture.  The audio has a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  Again, it is unremarkable but I can't complain either.  Surrounds come into play infrequently, just with some street noise and bar scenes.  The dialog is clear except for one scene where an exchange between David and Emma seemed unusually muffled.  There are Spanish, French and English SDH subtitles available.  Extras include a deleted scene, a behind the scenes featurette, a 5 minute piece with Vince Vaughn going off script and some bloopers.",1406505600,,2736,4.677148846960168

6074593,2,B00GEKO51U,"Even Vince Vaughn's massive charisma, smarts and charm cannot lift this movie from the molasses it seems mired in. It's a cute, if implausible story - frequent sperm bank donor is told his sperm bank screwed up and used his sperm too much, and he is the father of 533 kids, some of whom are suing the sperm bank to learn his ID. It's kind of a ""My Name is Earl"" story told sideways. Slacker Vaughn, who has a reputation (especially with himself) for being undependable and kind of worthless, kicks into gear and anonymously gets into the lives of and helps several of the 533 kids, who are in their late teens/early 20s.

The story is cute enough and Vince Vaughn is wonderful. But ...is a film's pacing the fault of the director or the editor? Because this movie drags and seems to take forrrrrr-evvvvvvv-verrrr. The slow pace interrupted every single interesting part of the story. It would get charming and interesting and clip along and then ....arrggh.

The lawyer had some great lines and moments. VV is struggling with what is right and what he would rather do. Think of this as ""that chick flick that didn't do well in the box office but finds a niche when it comes to TV"". It's heartwarming.
I love NY as part of the character and setting. Just watching movies set in real NY City is pleasing to me.
Yes, the family doesn't look like a possible match for VV. He looks like he was adopted by the island of misfits, but who cares. Get over it. It's just a story and actors are taught to play the role not fit the box office desires of commercialism.
I tire easily at VV movies because it seems that the directors just let him role with the ad libs and constant one liners gets tiresome. He had a little more depth here with some varying emotions and struggle.
If you go in expecting ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""Finding Private Ryan"" or some other epic film then you will be disappointed.

6074708,4,B00GEKO51U,"As a man, I think its safe to assume that Ive spent quite a few hours of my life lingering in the shower long after I was done getting cleaned up.  Its just a part of being a guy.  One thing Ive never done (well, I won't say never) is tended to particular duties in a public place.  While you may say that a sperm bank isn't public, it is a place where everyone knows what you are doing behind that closed door.  I have a hard time with that.

True story:

A few years back (quite a few) when my wife and I were attempting to start our family, we visited a fertility doctor and of course the first thing they did was hand me a plastic container and pointed to a small room in the corner of a bigger room that was full of women sitting at desks, all of the desks regrettably facing that small room.  I walked over there and had a very pretty young woman point to a box of magazines and tell me to make sure I didn't get any saliva in the cup.  Not sure what she thought I was going to do in there all by myself, but honest to god she told me that.  Leaving that room and facing all of those women while I was holding this plastic cup in my hands (because I didn't see the paper bag next to the sink that I was supposed to put it in) was reallywell, there are no words truthfully.

Im not a shy man by any means, but that was awkward.

How Vince Vaughn managed to do that 600+ times is beyond me.

Yup, Delivery Man tells the story of David, a single man with responsibility issues who is trying to commit to his girlfriend and his job when he finds out that the sperm bank he donated to hundreds of times (under the name Starbuck) made a really big oops.  That oops has made David a father of over 500 kids, and 142 (random number) have decided that they want to know who he is.  Of course, he is under no obligation to divulge his identity, since it is confidential, but he finds himself being sued by these kids and after taking an interest in them, he starts to get all paternal.

I don't know why, but I have a real soft spot for Vince Vaughn.  I always have.  I remember being a kid and being drawn to him, and this was back in the 90s when he thought that he could make it as a dramatic actor.  Thankfully, his career got a second wind (or maybe it was a first wind) when he realized he was far better suited for comedy, and I still remember how the world was kind of taken aback by the way he so causally floated across the screen next to Pitt and Jolie in 2005s Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  It was like a rebirth of sorts, and since then his career has been hotter than expected.  YES, Vaughn plays the same character in every single film, but hes so natural and endearing in each of these movies that I find myself compelled to see them all.  Sure, they don't always work as a whole, but he usually works, regardless of the film.

Delivery Man is a very dumb movie.  So much of this film makes no sense in retrospect, but it is handled so well that it almost doesnt matter.  I could sit here and poke at every plot-hole or dumb twist (that whole section with the addict daughter was ridiculous) and yet why should I bother.  Vaughn is funny, charming and endearing and by the end of the movie you are completely satisfied with his happy ending.  Sometimes that is all that matters.",1401408000,,3281,4.0875

Since then, he has somehow managed to bring enough charm to terrible movies to keep me curious enough to keep watching them despite how bad they have all been. Bravo, Mr. Vaughn. You are likeable.",1401321600,,251,4.478260869565218

6074712,2,B00GEKO51U,Not a comedy.  This movie had a slow start and was boring at times. I do not recommend. Save your money.,1401235200,,104,3.9523809523809526

6074717,5,B00GEKO51U,"Vince Vaughn is a jock-y, good-hearted dullard in this film.  That bull in a a china shop role is pretty much the role he is best at and may be what he is like in real life.  This is every man's nightmare of having lost track of his donated polliwogs and sired hundreds of children, many of whom are suing in a class action to identify him.  I think men will both enjoy and wince at his more than women because it is a risk that only men face.  However, Vaughn is likable, and clearly innocent enough that men will root for him and women will like the ending.",1401062400,,559,4.10091743119266

6074721,4,B00GEKO51U,"I was not sure what to expect from this movie since the premise is so outlandish, but it turned out to be an enjoyable movie with heart.  The main character turns his life around from one of selfishness and irresponsibility to one of caring.  It is an enjoyable ride along his transforming journey.  Not the best movie, but one I would suggest others watch for an enjoyable experience",1401062400,,384,4.617647058823529

6074724,3,B00GEKO51U,"not your typical Vince Vaughn.  He didn't do much of his rambling he's known for but again he plays a goofy, lovable, unreliable friend and family guy. It was a funny story and definitely worth seeing but it wasn't anything spectacular. If asked, I would say, if you want something light and silly and unreal to imagine for an hour and a half, this will def fit the bill. It was very touching at moments and Vaughn really has a way about him for communicating emotions realistically. It's never very dramatic but his characters always learn something and have to grow into their lives, and he makes it an amusing, believable ride.",1400976000,,630,4.625

6074726,3,B00GEKO51U,This is not a typical Vince Vaughn movie. It has some good comedic parts that make the movie worth renting.

The premise is silly for sure, but in the sheer magnitude of what this guy did makes the meaning clearer. I was actually moved to tears at one point. Sounds silly I know--but the longing that everyone has to belong is touching and presented here in a funny and loving way.

6074778,3,B00GEKO51U,I went into this movie with low expectations but was surprised that I enjoyed the film but not because I thought it was hilariously funny.  Delivery Man is a movie about an underachieving meat delivery man who finds out that he fathered over a 100 kids after donating sperm as a young man. While there are a few times during the movie I found myself laughing the real enjoyment comes while watching Vince Vaughn interact with the young men and women trying to find out the truth about their father. It has some touching parts and I would recommend this for a good family movie.,1399593600,,577,4.495238095238095
6074779,5,B00GEKO51U,Vince was perfect for this part. Great comedy w I th plenty of laughs through out the movie. Just enough drama to keep it real and make you wonder if it could really happen.

6074786,5,B00GEKO51U,"Great movie. How a fertility banks mistake turns Vince Vaughn's life upside down, that is until he decides to peek in the envelope that holds all the information to prosecute the fertility bank. What's in the envelope are bio's of every child he had fathered. Then he starts to go hang out with them, ends up becoming a big brother, mentoring and helping in small ways. He establishes relationships with each and every one but still wants to remain anonymous because he's afraid these kids are trying to find out who their father is because they are angry. But finds out that's not the case, they just want the right to have a relationship with the missing link. After reading about everyone he see's how he can enter into the lives of all these great all these kids who really just want a dad. Then he admits to them who he is, their biological father after making a difference in each young adults life. In the end it's all right side up. While this seems almost crazy, if you think about it for a moment and how po college students were and continued to be in the 60's ,70's and 80's. This was the easiest way to make money and a great source of revenue for many. It could have actually happened!!!:) so it's funny, sincere and a bit real.",1399420800,,1242,4.404347826086957

6074796,4,B00GEKO51U,Decent movie if you can't find anything else that looks more interesting to you.  But not one that I would give a rave review.  Maybe if I lower your expectations you will enjoy it more than I did.  It's not bad!,1399248000,,212,4.121951219512195

6074809,3,B00GEKO51U,Vince Vaughn is funny as always but this movie was not to my liking of his work.  It was not a movie I would watch over and over again like Fred Claus or Wedding Crashers or The Dilemma.  But worth a see on Sunday afternoon when no sports are on.,1398902400,,246,3.9

The movie was funny and it made me laugh out loud.  It also had a great story line.  I wasn't sure how this was going to be as a movie with this subject line, but it was a wonderful movie.  I loved it.  Well written and well acted.  Very enjoyable!",1398902400,,378,3.9466666666666668
6074812,4,B00GEKO51U,"I'm not always a fan of Vincent Vaughn films. For some reason it's the smaller, less commercial films that I enjoy more. It's just that the best stuff is usually shown in the TV ads & other than those laughs everything else is a let down. With this movie I was pleasantly surprised. The premise is a wild stretch but not entirely impossible. From the start we learn that Vaughns character is a slacker who owes more money then he can raise. He has a girlfriend who has lost faith in waiting for him to grow up and a father who is waiting for the same. When he is approached by a representative of the sperm bank he made MULTIPLY deposits in (which we find out later in the film why he did it) we learn he had in the words of the Rep. ""super sperm"". The rest of the story is how by becoming involved with his kids he learns more about himself. It's funny and sweet without being sapping.",1398902400,,886,4.187134502923977
6074813,3,B00GEKO51U,"Vince Vaughn is reaching his 'Adam Sandler' level (his comedy is not changing or growing). The movie attempts to be serious, moving and funny. Didn't quite get there. They should have kept it light and funny. Vaughns last couple of movies have attempted to 'be a little more than slapstick', my humble opinion - go back to the baseless humor, at least you're better at that.",1398902400,,374,4.681818181818182

Thousands!!Unfortunately the director decided he has IMPORTANT POINTS TO MAKE ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT FAMILY IS and spends the last half of the movie driving  home the same obvious point ..over and over and over....tedious, repetitive...insulting to anyone with half a brain.....rented it for $1.20 and felt cheated....",1398816000,3,408,5.476190476190476

6074820,5,B00GEKO51U,I thought this was a great movie! The acting was good and it was not the usual dumb plot that Vaughn and other get into.  Few if any bad words and so it is a movie for everyone.  Good story with some heart and some comedy and a good ending.  I would recommend it as a feel good movie about a guy trying to find his place in the world and make a life for himself.,1398729600,,362,3.736842105263158

6074829,5,B00GEKO51U,The movie was cute and enjoyed it very much. Watched with my husband and 13 year old daughter and both enjoyed very much. Wish they didn't have to always put bad language in so many movies but it wasn't near as bad as some we've looked at renting in past. Cute story ending.,1398643200,,274,4.188679245283019

6074857,5,B00GEKO51U,I would recommend this movie for any adult who likes comedy that also touches your heart. I really like the way Vince Vaughn played this character. He was very likable and sincere as a big-time screw-up that finally gets focused when he finds that he's a father to so many children. The story line was unusual. It was fun to watch.,1398124800,,331,4.442622950819672

Probably worth four and half stars since it's not a Rocky one or Lion the witch and the wardrobe, but it's still a real good fell good movie, if you like those.  So get the tissues and check it out.",1398124800,,390,3.911392405063291
6074860,5,B00GEKO51U,The movie was funny and heartwarming. A good balance of comedy and relationships without being annoying or cheesy. It's a good picture of modern culture and it's family-friendly.,1398124800,,178,5.392857142857143

6074863,4,B00GEKO51U,A different movie script refreshing started slow but ended good.  I would recommend to others not quite a chick Flix.,1398124800,,117,4.85
6074864,5,B00GEKO51U,"I have to admit, I've never been a Vince Vaughn fan. His style of manic comedy has never really grabbed me, he comes close, but just never quite gets there. THIS time, Vince clobbered it! He played the part comedically (there is really no way to play this part completely straight), but straight enough to keep his character likeable, relatable, and easy to sympathize with. THIS is the sort of film I could see making a successful series or sitcom, if handled properly, following David around as he gets to know each of his children, some of the family situations (can you imagine weddings or reunions?) they would have to deal with. But as far as the film goes, I can say this much: I have a private collection of favorite movies that I keep, and re-watch, time and again. I passed on this film 3 times. Today, I not only watched it, I added it to my library. Way to go, Mr. Vaughn. You finally delivered.",1398038400,,907,4.437125748502994
6074865,4,B00GEKO51U,Very funny! Vince is always such a jokster! He was perfect for that role and made the story seem real.,1398038400,,102,4.15
6074866,4,B00GEKO51U,Well worth watching but thought it would be funnier considering Vince Vaughn was in it.  There were still plenty of laughs.  Interesting topic too.,1398038400,,147,5.083333333333333

6074869,3,B00GEKO51U,Not bad not great. Vince Vaughn is always funny but the writing for this film just wasn't all that great. If your bored its worth a watch.,1398038400,,138,4.148148148148148

6074873,3,B00GEKO51U,"This film offers an original take on what happens if a sperm bank has ethics problems. Vince Vaughn is a good hearted guy who just wants to make a little cash on the side. Instead what he gets is 533 children whom he can't help feeling parental concern and love for what are truly his biological offspring. The acting is very good but the story line gets a little unreal as the film progresses.

6074875,3,B00GEKO51U,"So the story line is ridiculously stupid.  His girlfriend is angry at the sperm donor so he decides to keep it a secret.  He decides to file a reverse lawsuit to protect his identity (which is unnecessary because if the plantiff loses his identity is automatically protected).  He also wins $200,000 from the clinic who legally used his sperm for some undisclosed reason...using it too much?  The feel good moments were sweet.

6074891,3,B00GEKO51U,"Delivery Man had its moments, but it was far from a great movie.  The concept was interesting and creative.  A man donates sperm over 600 times in the span of 33 months, and because of limited supplies at the sperm bank and the potency of his semen, he ends up fathering a total of 533 kids.  If that wasn't enough, a class action suit is filed on behalf of around 142 of his children who would like to know the identity of their father.  Presented with the identities of 142 of his children, Vince Vaughns character sets out on a mission to get to know his children a little bit, all the while not revealing his true identity.  Some parts were funny, some were series, but none of them were even remotely believable.  For starters, it seemed as if none of the kids were even a little creeped out by the fact that same strange man was hanging around them, hugging them every chance he got.  All of the kids were extremely understandingwhen does that ever happen.  Vaughns girlfriend is perfectly fine with the situationwith him having 533 kids, and all.  And then theres Ryan.  How was he a part of the class action suit?  He was living in an assisted living facility, there was absolutely no reference to his birth mother (was she still in his life?), and he couldn't communicate in any facet.

6074911,4,B00GEKO51U,"Delivery Man is a comedy/drama that directed by Ken Scott, who wrote and directed the original movie for which this film is based on.  The film stars Vince Vaughn, Chris Pratt, and Cobie Smulders.  It is a remake of Scott's 2011 French-Canadian film Starbuck.  The plot of the film is pretty easy, it follows an underachiever (Vaughn) finds out he's fathered 533 children through anonymous donations to a fertility clinic 20 years ago.  Now he must decide whether or not to come forward when 142 of them file a lawsuit to reveal his identity.

I found that beyond Vaughn's and Smulder's good performances, Chris Pratt was great in this film.  This film shows you why he was cast in movies like Zero Dark Thirty and Moneyball.  I enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it to others.

If I didn't think my girlfriend was enjoying it...then I wouldn't have watched so long.  Then she got up to do the laundry in the last 10 minutes.

6074928,3,B00GEKO51U,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Every comedic actor will eventually receive a role that changes the way he or she is perceived by their audience. These roles are typically very different from their past work, and the film itself doesn't necessarily have to be good to show that the role could potentially lead to a lot of growth down the line. I personally can't remember the last time I have ever seen Vince Vaughn give a performance like the one I witnessed in Delivery Man, which is why I think this is one of those roles for him. Unfortunately, the film itself never completely executes on either the comedic or the emotional side of the story, but there is still a lot to love if you decide to give it your time.

Vaughn takes on the role of David Wozniak, a delivery man for his father's meat company, and someone who is about to have his life changed forever. As a young adult hurting for money, David donated sperm 693 times over the course of a few years. Unfortunately, there was a mix-up at the sperm bank, and only his sperm was used for a few months, which resulted in him ""fathering"" 533 children. Today, 142 of them want to know who their father is, and they are taking their case to court because they believe their right to know their father's identity exceeds his right to anonymity.

Aside from this highly unlikely situation, the main issue with Delivery Man is the constant absence of information. In addition to having to deal with the 142 children looking for him, David is also being pursued by thugs, to whom he owes $80,000, and his girlfriend, Emma (Cobbie Smulders), is pregnant. Although this debt is a constant area of discussion throughout the film, the viewer never learns why David owes them money, or even who ""they"" are. The audience is essentially told to accept the fact that it's just another problem in David's life, when really it was just sloppy writing.

Then there is Emma, who is nonexistent for majority of the film. The viewer only sees her briefly in the beginning, maybe once or twice about halfway through, and she appears a few times in the final act. To be fair, Emma is worried about whether or not she wants David to be a part of the baby's life because he is kind of failing at his own, but she never seemed to care about any of that the few times we see them together. Honestly, the worst part about this scenario is that Cobbie is criminally underused. Her work on How I Met Your Mother shows that she can make you laugh, but Emma felt like more of an afterthought, which didn't allow Cobbie any time to truly shine.

That's not to say that Delivery Man is deprived of comedic material, however. It just seems like it was reserved more for the male performers, and as a whole it kind of took a back seat to the more emotional side of the story. Although Vaughn may be the big name in this one, he only had a few laugh out loud moments throughout the entire film. Instead, it was Chris Pratt who delivered a majority of the laughs. Pratt plays Brett, David's friend and lawyer. He has yet to really prove himself as a legitimate lawyer, and he is also the father of four children, which is why he insists on helping David with this case.

I think the main reason Pratt was so enjoyable is because all of his lines felt natural and authentic. There was never a moment where he stuttered out of character, and the scene where we meet Brett is arguably one of the funniest moments in the movie, which brings me to my next point: he works extremely well with Vaughn. Whether they were providing laughs or having a serious moment about the case, the two of them bounced off of each other in a way that resembled genuine friendship. I've only seen Pratt in a few roles, but he has a long career ahead of him if he can get himself in a starring position.

All of this is only half of the experience, though, because Delivery Man is constantly trying to make you connect emotionally. Unfortunately, as previously stated, it fails to do so more than it succeeds. Don't get me wrong, there are numerous scenes that are very sweet, and even a little heartwarming, but their emotional impact is lessened by the pace in which we move from child to child. David attempts to get a glance at as many of these children as possible, and maybe even provide some assistance, even if it is something minor like taking out the trash, but a few seconds here and there don't allow you enough time to really care about any of them.

Overall Score: 6.9/10 - Delivery Man probably won't be considered one of Vaugn's best, but there is something to be said about his ability as an actor after watching this film. His comedic side is kept on a leash for majority of the film's running time, and seeing Vaughn be stoic and introspective was a surprisingly nice change of pace. In addition, Pratt provided a lot of laughs, and whenever we got to see David interact with a child for more than a few seconds it always managed to put a smile on my face. Although it may be littered with flaws, I would still recommend a viewing just to see Vaughn step out of his comfort zone.",1397260800,,5116,4.440894568690096
6074929,4,B00GEKO51U,"The core idea of this movie was great.  It's about a man who finds out that through an error in a sperm donation bank that he's the father of 500 plus people.  Exploring his relationships with his children is a joy... except there just isn't enough of it.  It just doesn't work in a short hour and half movie.  The relationships don't feel real.  Look, the writing is clever, the acting is well done, the characters and situations are interesting.  But it's all crammed into a little movie.  I recommend it, but this is one concept that should have been a 12 episode mini series on HBO or Showtime.  It's clever, it's funny, but it needs more space.",1397260800,,649,4.440677966101695

6074949,3,B00GEKO51U,"I usually like most films with Vince Vaughn as I find he has an every man kind of appeal.  He has enough of a screen presence to carry a film but his acting usually has enough real world nuances that most people can identify and/or root for him.  In this case I could not get past the fact that his character was too much of a loser so late in his life that his turnaround seemed improbable, especially with regards to the gambling.  Someone who has no money, but gets $80,000 behind in gambling debts is by definition an addict.  Yet we never really see this side of him addressed during the film - no counseling, therapy or even any direct admission that he has an addiction.  His gambling addiction felt like a plot device just to fill in the story line in so far as him needing money and his bookie threatening his father.  That he was lousy at a fairly menial job into his late 30's and that he was also poor at romantic relationships were the two defining parts of his character.  The gambling problem exaggerated his circumstances to the point he was almost too pathetic to root for his redemption.",1397001600,,1105,4.387254901960785

Vince Vaughn typically does some pretty ""content-filled"" movies.  However, I looked this one up on a site that I use regularly (pluggedin.com) to check on movies before I waste my time and money on them and this one seemed to be quite toned-down in the category of bad content compared to his other films, so we gave it a shot.  And, of course, with the general summary of the movie, there were some inappropriate innuendos - but in comparison to other movies that fit this category, it was actually very tactful.  I was pleasantly surprised and our family really enjoyed it!",1397001600,3,731,4.592307692307692

6074953,3,B00GEKO51U,"I like Vince V. -- that's what got me interested in the movie. the storyline that one man fathered over 500 kids via his sperm donations is plausible in our society today--the ramifications of that high number of sperm donations gives one pause. However, the storylilne is a bit stretched: to think that  would immediately change his ways and become their biological ""saviour"" is unbelievable--even for fiction.

Even the small part of Emma staring Cobie Smulders added to the possible realism of the story. This movie stands out for me because I laughed, I cried and even prayed that the movie would not end in a manner that would destroy the delicate fabric shown by the love of the children portrayed in this cute, funny, heart warming, crazy fun loving story perfectly portrayed in a manner that glorified the ideal family that we all wish for everyone. All the ""children"" with all their diversity really make me feel as if I were part of the family. Super movie, super story and really great believable ending.",1396915200,,760,4.554744525547445

I have always liked most of the movies Vince Vaughn has stared in, and this was no exception.

Honest; because have many people actually thought about the children born in a result in sperm donation? And the thought of one person being the birth father of 533 children is extremely funny.

Vince Vaughn is his normal comedic self in this movie with his quick witted humor throughout.  There are moments in the movie that are laugh out loud but this movie is more of a sentimental, heartwarming movie than a comedy with some really nice moments (the disabled child moment for example).  The movie has a great message about the diversity of family.

6075016,5,B00GEKO51U,"I watched this movie with people half my age and we agreed, why did it not win more awards.  It was a movie that held laughter and deep emotion; moving one on several level,s and after it ended, left a feeling similar to one of having had a marvelous meal.",1396137600,,256,4.12
6075017,4,B00GEKO51U,"Sweet movie with a kind, loving theme about family and fatherhood.  Not as many laughs as we expected for a Vince Vaughn movie, but funny enough.  Need to be careful if you have teens or kids watching since there are plenty of metaphorical references to self-stimulation in this comedy about a sperm donor.",1396137600,,306,4.754716981132075
6075018,1,B00GEKO51U,Not a comedy at all!! More like a drama.  Not terrible but if you want to laugh watch something else!!,1396137600,3,102,4.1
6075019,4,B00GEKO51U,Funny n heart warming. It's hard to write a review without spoiler alerts. Too bad you just can't give the movie stars and call it a day,1396137600,,136,4.074074074074074
6075020,1,B00GEKO51U,Not worth my time. It was a bad script and not funny or entertaining at all. Don't waste your time.,1396137600,4,99,4.0
6075021,3,B00GEKO51U,It was an average movie. Slow in some parts and predictible in other parts. Not my favorite comedy by Vince.,1396137600,,108,4.45
6075022,4,B00GEKO51U,"First off let me be clear, this is a film. A very good one. Times are changing and the items we are given to watch are drifting more towards murders ghosts and explosions and away from things with heart warming content. Vince Vaughn in my eyes is not a very talented actor. He  plays a certain kind of character that works in a certain kind of film. That being said I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie and how touching of a character he actually played. He has grown as an actor and however far fetched this story is it has something a lot of movies don't, character. Don't be put off by the trailer or go in comparing it to the Canadian made original. Go in and watch the way the events effect him, and how he grows a s a person while inspiring others to grow as people themselves.",1396137600,,799,4.222222222222222
6075023,3,B00GEKO51U,This far fetched story was not great to watch. They tried to make you laugh and cry over this story line. I felt like the story was to weak. I did not care about the main character as much as they wanted me to.,1396051200,,210,3.7954545454545454
6075024,5,B00GEKO51U,I thought this was going to be on of those high low high movies but it's pretty good straight across. No giant sad part that not a single comedy needs. It's Vince Vaughn... come on it's hilarious,1396051200,,195,4.297297297297297
6075025,5,B00GEKO51U,"Loved it! This is the best family comedy I've seen in a long time.  The story line is really unique and humorous.  It's a little ridiculous, but they did a good job with making it so funny that you don't care the story isn't very realistic.  I'd highly recommend it if you're in the mood for a light comedy.",1395964800,,307,4.169491525423729

The fact is, we are all brother and sisters. We all need to know we are loved, and are cared about by someone. Just knowing, puts the pieces of our life together. We all come from a sperm donor, but Our True Father in Heaven, Loves and cares about each and every one of us, He wants us to look for Him. When we find him, he's an Awesome  Dad. He listens, He reveals Himself to us, in a personal way. He's Wonderful, Powerful, Wise and in Every Way Perfect. Our desires changes to be just like Him. He blesses us in so many ways, Everyday, if our eyes our open. Ask Jesus in come into your heart, to be your Savior. Receive the Holy Spirit (The Spirit of Truth). To fill you, and give your life and Everything to God. Most Importantly Trust Jesus. You will find, your entire life has Changed! Believe it! You are Born Again! Jesus WILL NEVER LEAVE OR FORSAKE YOU. :)  We still need to learn to walk, Let Father help and guide, by taking us by the hand (trusting him and surrendering everything to him) like Babies need someone to help them walk. Soon you'll wanna Run down the street,  Yelling, proclaiming, telling everyone how Wonderful Jesus is. Jesus Is The Truth, The life, and The Way. I pray, you let Our Father into your life.

6075039,5,B00GEKO51U,"I have waited so long to see this movie but my first chance was when Delivery Man came out on Bu-Ray! With three kiddos at home and one still a newborn, I don't get out much! Thank goodness for Blu-Ray!

I adore Vince Vaughn! I think he is hilarious and this movie is no exception! I heard such rave reviews and it definitely lived up to its reputation. In fact, it was better than I expected!

I knew it would be laugh out loud hilarious but I didn't expect it to also be equally moving and touching and so all around good! To be honest, with a premise like a man having 533 children, I expected it to be slightly ridiculous. While fathering that many children is still a stretch any way you look at it, the movie was so well done it almost doesnt matter.

Vaughn is charming and funny and the movie was so well written and directed that the timing and duration were just perfect. I think he has a rep as strictly a comedic actor because hes so hilarious but the mans really got some great acting chops and he can do depth just as easily as he does funny.

Delivery Man was as heartwarming as it was fun and one that I know I will watch over and over again. And those that I do with what little time I have are few and far between!",1395792000,,1232,4.0995850622406635

6075041,4,B00GEKO51U,"Delivery Man is a comedy starring Vince Vaughn as David Wozniak, an underachiever who discovers he has fathered 533 children via donations he made to a sperm bank 20 years earlier.

Several of those children are now suing to learn the identity of their father and David finds that this might be the best thing that ever happened to him. Vaughn has made a career of playing various incarnations of the man boy  an irresponsible adult who redeems himself through a set of carefully scripted circumstances.

Vaughn has a pleasant screen presence and his trademark rapid-fire dialogue delivery provides plenty of laughs, but the movie often borders on maudlin as Vaughns David finds in himself the qualities and compassion that would have made him a pretty decent dad.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include outtakes of Vaughn improvising, bloopers, deleted scene, and a behind-the-scenes featurette.",1395446400,4,902,5.157534246575342

6075044,4,B00GEKO51U,"I watched this on a plane (as I do most movies any more).  I really enjoyed Delivery Man, although I have never been a huge fan of Vince Vaughn and I acknowledge some gaping holes in its plausibility (mostly related to the apparent absence of any of the 500 plus offsprings' parents other than David Wozniak, and a complete failure to acknowledge that something other than David's DNA made these kids what they are).  No matter how many faults he has (and David has many lapses of judgment) he learned from his father (and presumably his mother) one of the essentials of parenting - to see the positive in your children.

For many years I have had a book called ""Onions in the Stew"" by Betty MacDonald.  It was an autobiographical story that included an anecdote from a friend who said something to the effect that the secret of dealing with children was to look for something positive to say, even if it was only to compliment them on their neatly tied shoes (I think another part of this secret involved the consumption of alcohol, but that's neither here nor there).  Try it, it does work.

Many funny scenes ensue when David begins to make contact with his children (the sport parent behavior at the NBA game was one of the best I thought - ""why aren't they putting him in?"" is a classic).

Bottom line, the movie is at the very least a reminder about the possibilities in all of us and the importance of the parent who is willing to look for and nurture them.  The pride of a parent who can see skills and abilities in their child that they themselves lack (and I am not talking about basketball here) is also a beautiful thing to see and I thought that this was actually very well expressed by not only David Wozniak but by his own father.",1393977600,2,1745,4.43125
