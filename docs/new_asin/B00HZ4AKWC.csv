What makes the story interesting, is a piece of ""trailer trash"" gets all the way to the top through grit and hard work, and then falls. Its a sad story, whether you believe Harding or not.

In TV appearences Tonya Harding says that the finished product is not what she signed on for.

6243814,3,B00HZ4AKWC,"Both Tonya and Nancy came from blue collar backgrounds. Tonya's mom had four spouses, so not a very stable home. My mom had it worse (i.e. child slave labor), and numerous step fathers. Broken homes suck and are yes emotionally abusive. However, each person makes a choice in life what type of person they will be regardless of their parents. Happens all the time! Tonya performed well as did Nancy. The only thing I have against Tonya is that her handwriting on the document citing the Kent Tony arena (Massachusetts area) where Nancy trained was on a piece of paper in the dumpster along with other detail and used as strategy. Tonya denies the paper was her writing, experts disagree. That location was to be the initial assault attempt to Nancy. Detroit ended up being the second choice. Liars like Tonya will never admit wrongdoing or be honest. She could not even be honest in Lillehammer Norway during the Olympics when reporters asked if she got on well with her peers. She blew it off and was in a delusional state of mind. She was found guilty of  interfering with the investigation. However all gentleman who were charged for this crime stated she was the boss and it was her idea.

6243819,5,B00HZ4AKWC,"This is from Tonya's point of view, with Tonya being interviewed extensively. She is very bitter about how she was treated in skating, and her complaints are real. I mean, everyone (EVERYONE) wanted Nancy to win gold, because she had the right look, even though Tonya was a great skater. So Tonya has a lot of motive.  What really made this a good story is, it really is possible that her aggressive, controlling, idiot of an abusive husband really did think up this knee cap idea on his own, because he thought he was so smart, but was too dumb to know he couldn't get away with it. It's also possible that Tonya masterminded it. She has a lot of animosity. But sometimes the obvious suspect is not the guy, you know? I personally think she was involved, but I won't spoil it by discussing the evidence. You watch and decide for yourself!",1519171200,4,839,4.483660130718954

Tonya's story is sad, whether you believe her insistence that she did not have an active role in the assault on Nancy Kerrigan or not, and anyone who has struggled with poverty or ""white trash"" origins can see their own reflection in her journey. The entertainment industry loves spinning tales about a plucky underdog who overcomes social class issues to achieve all of their hopes and dreams, but Tonya's story is about what happens more often than not to the poor underdog in reality.",1515628800,5,761,4.686567164179104

The Price of Gold is brilliant because it's the perfect combination of incredible sports footage, dramatic media coverage, and inside interviews. It was very insightful to see both sides of the story so that Tanya had a chance to save face. I feel like a lot of us can relate to her feeling like we've had to fight for whatever we've achieved in life. The temptation to cheat is always there, it's unfortunate when people succumb to temptation and stuff like this happens, but hey, we're human.",1477353600,3,600,4.723809523809524
6243834,4,B00HZ4AKWC,"In this documentary, so much light was shed on Tonya Harding. Her name for one, doesn't help. Tonya is not, in my opinion, the classiest of names, and unfortunately there's the word ""hard"" in her last name, basically symbolizing her doom from the onset. She was a sweet and innocent child with a ton of talent on the ice. Realizing her situation with her mother, who basically ""groomed"" her mentally and emotionally, was desperate to get out from under her wickedness.

As is obvious, in her adult life, she didn't fall far from the tree, especially after marrying Galooly. The one thing she knew and had absolute faith in and believed in was her dream of becoming an Olympic champion. That was her way out of the gutter and the abuse. Again, as a result of her hard emotional and mental grooming, and these idiots who had every intention of riding her coattail to fame and mostly fortune, pulled her into their evil scheme and talked her into going through with this ugly deed to ensure her way to gold.

As Kerrigan said in a comment regarding the whole event, something to the effect of, ""it's sad, it wasn't necessary, she had talent."" But Tonya was a desperate young woman and at a certain point, knew she was losing her status at the top and HAD to secure that win. That's all there was to it, in her mind. She knew it would change everything in her sad life.

Now all I see in this woman is anger and bitterness and the same social status, which is exactly what she wanted to escape. The irony of it all.

I wished that the 11 year old friend of her's would have called child social services, despite being told not to, after seeing her being beaten repeatedly with a hair brush. Yes, that is disturbing, very disturbing. She many not have been a superstar, but perhaps her life would have changed for the better, nonetheless.

I think the real peace for Tonya Harding, in the end, may be, as her friend commented, is to ""have an examined life"". It may finally change her attitude and bring her peace of mind, which she deserved as a child. She has paid a huge price and desperately needs and deserves that now.

One question: Where were the coaches who guided here?  Why did they not ""take her in"", physically, knowing what she was going through?",1459814400,,2254,4.482926829268293
6243835,4,B00HZ4AKWC,"An above average 30 for 30 documentary. This one covers the ice skating rivalry of Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding. I found the sections dealing with the backgrounds of both the skaters most interesting. The comments from Tonya's childhood friend that she no longer talks to were most illuminating in my view. Nothing really new is settled or brought to light. It's more of a character study of Tonya Harding, what her life was like, her training, what she says she did, what her friends think she actually did, and how she copes with it.  It was not an apologia for her, but more of some matter of fact type journalism. Good job.",1437955200,,631,4.584070796460177
6243836,3,B00HZ4AKWC,"I watched the events that unfolded between Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan in 1994 and saw the Olympics competition too. Hearing the comments made in 30 for 30: The Price of Gold, I took offense that they did not believe that Oskana Baiul deserved the gold medal. I watched the competition and thought Oskana, who in fact was in pain the entire time, was the winner. Anyway, what was that stupid ass, Tony Kornheiser, doing on the show? The moron had no shred of credibility when it came to making opinions about sports, let alone figure skating. Connie Chung, a horrible interviewer (her husband is Maury Povich!), couldn't have looked more ridiculous; Tonya should have punched her lights out during the demeaning interview.

30 for 30: The Price of Gold didn't reveal anything much new to me, save for the fact that Tonya Harding looked almost unrecognizable. I knew that Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't appear on it because that was exactly her; she came out of nowhere to be famous under unfortunate circumstances and quietly disappeared after the saga was over.

Why I was giving points off for the documentary was, no matter how many times I had heard of the story of the 1994 attack, how the makers simply failed to clearly explain the sequence of the attack; it was like they rushed through it and moved straight for the Olympics stuff. They never took the time to put everything together piece by piece leading up to the attack. I was expecting something new that I didn't know only it turned out I wasted my time watching the documentary to relive the events.

Let's just be fair: Tonya Harding had spunk and overcame the impossible to be a National Champion in figure skating. I could understand where she was coming from in terms of looks and class because it was obvious Nancy Kerrigan was the darling that everybody preferred only to be undone by her offhand snide comments and bitchy behavior (Did you know why the documentary never aired her comments during the parade in Disneyland? It's because ESPN is owned by Disney, so much for objectivity). Tonya came from the gutter and had an abusive childhood. But it didn't excuse the attack on Nancy. When it happened, it was the moment that changed both of their lives forever. Because of the moment, from that point forward, whenever people thought of figure skating, all they could think of were Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan and for the wrong reasons. The infamy was what Tonya will carry straight to her grave. If I had to sum up everything about it in one word, it was ""bizzare.""

The bottom line was: the attack didn't have to happen. The excessive media attention on Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan was unwarranted and needless because, all of a sudden, figure skating became more popular than football overnight and just for a month. All in all, for anyone who experienced it already, 30 for 30: The Price of Gold had nothing new to say and revealed more about the worst side of the media that beat the story to death.",1425945600,,2987,4.694656488549619

6243838,4,B00HZ4AKWC,"20 years ago, yes it's REALLY been that long, Nancy Kerrigan stepped off the practice ice on a rink in Detroit and someone approached her, wacked her in the right knee, and ran off.  So began a media circus unlike anything seen before or since around the world of figure skating and the 1994 Winter Olympics all around Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan.  What exactly happened and why?  And was it possible that Tonya's husband Jeff and his bumbling friends conspired to do this?  Yes, yes it was.

Here we meet Tonya today (and seeing how much weight she as put on after her skating days are now behind her), telling her life story and how she got into ice skating as a kid and then how she thrived within it to escape her impoverished life.  She married her husband fully knowing how abusive and horrible he was, saying it was what she knew as her mom also hit her.  Hindsight is always 20/20 in abusive relationships, but still she was a tremendous athlete no matter what others say about her.  She was the first American woman who ever successfully completed the triple axel and she displayed a lot of great strength on the ice rather than that of a graceful ballerina that most women skaters aspire to.  She was a great skater, of that no doubt, but she was unable to do the triple axel again upon the ice in competitions even before the 94 plot was hatched.  And once the attack happened, the Dream Team attackers could not stop boasting about their doing it, there were a million and one jokes made about it, and everyone was going crazy.  In a plot which even the most talented of soap opera writers could not come up with, Tonya choked at the Olympics, Nancy recovered and skated her medley, and Oksana Bieul won the gold by a few fractions of a points.  And then Nancy showed her true colors to the media, and Tonya was banned from professional skating.  Sad but true.

Oddly enough, even though it's been twenty years since this odd event happened, we still do not completely believe Tonya when she says that she had nothing to do with the planning and execution of the attack against Nancy.  I think she did know that Jeff and his friends were plotting something, but did she know that they were actually going to do it or tell them to do it?  If yes then she's a sociopath, if no then she's a victim too.  Whatever the case may be, I was surprised I felt a sense of loss about this situation.  I did not feel pity for Tonya then, but today after seeing this documentary I do.  She did a bad thing and she is paying the price for it.",1417478400,,2544,4.3630573248407645

6243843,4,B00HZ4AKWC,"The 2014 E.S.P.N. television documentary THE PRICE OF GOLD revisits the 1994 attack on ice skater Nancy Kerrigan, in which rival skater Tonya Harding was implicated.  While this film reminds us that the first husband of Harding and his friends executed the assault, to this day proof that Harding was in on the plan is not airtight.

My thought, viewing THE PRICE OF GOLD scenes where reporters swarm the skaters after Kerrigan is hurt and Harding is accused?  If only the news media were as diligent in investigating the Bush administration's claims about Iraq before the bombs started dropping.

Tonya Harding admits she learned about what her first husband and his accomplices did to Nancy Kerrigan after it happened, but before the public would, and did nothing.  If that's true, or if Harding was in on it, pay attention as THE PRICE OF GOLD suggests the reason she did nothing: Tonya Harding was a battered wife.

If there is a public record of Tonya Harding exhibiting antisocial behavior before or after 1994, I am unaware of it.  Compare that to what THE PRICE OF GOLD reports on her first husband after their divorce, which is more domestic violence with his next wife.  I can understand why a woman in fear of the back of her husband's hand would keep silent.

Too bad Nancy Kerrigan does not sit for THE PRICE OF GOLD. One need not ask why she wants to keep her life private, but I wonder if twenty years of life since then has made Kerrigan reconsider what she thinks of her rival skater.  The last we hear of her feelings about Tonya Harding is when Kerrigan blows off Harding's attempt to talk when they both make the 1994 Olympic skating team.

I usually don't comment on women's looks.  But I have to say, in THE PRICE OF GOLD there are remarks about Tonya Harding's appearance such as, to cite one by news reader Connie Chung, ""ugly duckling.""  I'd be curious to know the reaction of people who don't know what Tonya Harding looks like were you to show them images of her and ask if such descriptions are fitting.  (You want ugly, Connie?

6243849,4,B00HZ4AKWC,what a great talent that just didn't know how to make good decisions in life. Still hard to know how involved  she was in the incident.,1394064000,,135,4.1923076923076925
6243850,3,B00HZ4AKWC,"I did like how you got the story from so many different people and angles, it wasn't one sided and left you to decide.  Truly, I forgot all about this, but they are correct, forever if you remember or hear one name, it will always be bookended with the other.",1393977600,2,259,4.18
6243851,5,B00HZ4AKWC,This video is from the perspective of Tonya Harding. It tells the story from the media's point of view and from Tonya's point of view.,1393545600,,134,4.4
6243852,3,B00HZ4AKWC,"I enjoyed this documentary, until I became so over Tonya Harding I had to force myself to keep watching. Hearing from the family ""friend"" of Tonya Harding's and the reporters/skaters/other people who were close observers at the time of the scandal was interesting, I will say. Obviously this ""inside scoop"" is skewed and people have formulated their own opinions at least partly based on the media (which I do think was against Tonya from the start). However, it is PAINFUL to hear Tonya Harding speak during the interview. As one of the final interviewees mentions, her lack of accountability and willingness to take responsibility for herself is what ultimately got her in trouble. Tonya comes across as whiny, unapologetic, and with a warped sense of reality and too smug for her own good. What Tonya has failed to ever realize is that she had (and has) control over her attitude, her actions, and what she says. Honestly, I think it was a mistake for her to do this interview. It throws away any chance she had to be viewed as having grown or changed from this experience. She is still the Tonya Harding that she always was. Not once has Nancy Kerrigan spoken out against Tonya Harding directly, but Tonya is quick to call Nancy a ""princess"" and insinuates that she is a spoiled brat. Nevermind Nancy Kerrigan also came from a disadvantaged, blue collar home. I literally almost could not finish the documentary because Tonya is such an unrelatable subject.",1393459200,5,1461,4.824701195219124
6243853,5,B00HZ4AKWC,"This is a great behind-the-scenes look at the Harding/Kerrigan debacle from years ago. I wish Nancy would have agreed to be interviewed.  I think it would have added much to the video.  Other than that, it really shed some light on the obstacles that Tonya had to overcome to make it as far as she did.  I had no idea her home life was so tumultuous.",1393200000,2,350,4.2727272727272725
6243854,4,B00HZ4AKWC,"Can't believe it's been 20 years.  As much as I want to like Harding for her tough beginnings and underdog status, the documentary shows the power of denial and refusal of person accountability. Kudos to Kerrigan for continually taking the high road and playing the best game of ""psyche"" ever after her unwanted eternal tying to the hooligans involved. Should be mandatory viewing for teens and young atheletes, only of to serve as an example of how one bad choice can ruin your name and career for life.",1393200000,,504,4.7272727272727275
6243855,4,B00HZ4AKWC,"Clearly the story is Tonya Harding's, not Nancy Kerrigan's, in this interesting retelling of the 1994 attack and Olympics.  Time has faded all of our memories of how this story all went down, this is a measured re-telling with great back-story.  Ultimately, it's a story of how broken people make bad decisions.

Main downside is that Kerrigan declined to be interviewed for the story, and the interview with Harding went too easy on her.  There were clear contradictions in her statements that should have been pushed back.

In the end, you end up feeling sorry for Tonya Harding.  Not because you believe her ""me against the world"" story, but because how how decades of abuse and struggle have shaped/distorted her view of the world.",1393027200,3,735,4.887096774193548
6243856,5,B00HZ4AKWC,"I was only 10 when all of this happened but I remember it clearly. My mother always made it out that Tonya was responsible. My husband was older, he was a senior. We both sat riveted through this film just soaking in all of the details that we never knew.

I now am unsure of her involvement, however I definitely believe she got the short end of the stick through everything.

You should watch this if you remember this event at all!",1392940800,3,434,4.280487804878049
6243857,5,B00HZ4AKWC,"This documentary presents all information in an ALMOST objective way- very interesting and well paced. It features fascinating, heartbreaking, and sometimes cringe-worthy interview footage from Tonya Harding today. Well worth a watch even for those that know the story.",1392940800,3,269,5.923076923076923
6243858,5,B00HZ4AKWC,i felt sorry for both of them. Tonya Harding could have enjoyed beautiful rivalry instead of dealing with media created drama...,1392681600,4,128,5.142857142857143
6243859,5,B00HZ4AKWC,"I remember the media pounding, Seemed like the story grew and got more exaggerated as time went on. I could have sworn it was a tire iron and Tonya herself broke Nancy's knee cap open! Guess it wasn't nearly that bad!

Tonya is a rather unpleasant person (Nancy is an annoying goody goody too), but I have to admire what Tonya accomplished. She came from a terrible family, no support, no money, had the skating crowd against her, the rest of world too by the end. But was still able to become good enough to go to two Olympics and do that complicated jump, win a bunch of other big competitions.

 I get so tired of people who are full of excuses why they can't do something. Worse yet, trying to knock somebody else down who wants to do something. Whatever that something is competing or opening a business or going back to college or whatever. Excuses are a dime a dozen. Tonya had a million excuses she could have used to not pursue ice skating and given her hard circumstances people would have praised her as being realistic. Yet she went after the dream anyway.

Its too bad that she turned into what she had been running from. The rest of her life is pretty sad.",1392595200,5,1170,4.377880184331797
6243860,5,B00HZ4AKWC,I never did think Tonya knew of the plot at the time.  She probably knew of it after the fact.  She is just a clich of many pretty young women controlled by a dead beat man and drug down to keep her there.  She really had the most natural talent at the time.  She did not have Vera Wang making her costumes.  Many she made herself and parents were pretty much nonexistent.  The thing that makes me still think she had no part in the plot is how positive she had been through all of it and her clear record before as well as for the most part after unless media people harassed her.  This is an extremely good documentary of her triumphs and how the media has tried and punished her.  Great footage of her skating when she was in her prime.  Every time I am reminded of this story it makes me ill and embarrassed to be a human being.  Would be nice if The other one that got hammered would forgive her and wish her well given all Tonya has been put through.,1392336000,5,956,4.091397849462366
6243861,3,B00HZ4AKWC,"Figure skating always bored me to tears.  Then along came Tonya Harding and her band of hooligans and sweet mother have mercy....

Solid doc that held my interest.  It's not a particularly original approach to this sort of filmmaking.  There's lots of talking heads and the story line is essentially linear.  But who cares???  When a story is this fascinating you don't have to use parlor tricks to hold my attention!  I didn't know all the details as I've never been much of a tabloid reader, nor did I ever really stop to consider how strange the sport of figure skating really is.  All in all, it was  fascinating film from start to finish and my wife and were both left scratching our heads and disagreeing with each other about Tonya's indictment.  Definitely worth my 3 bucks.",1392163200,9,782,4.642335766423358
6243862,4,B00HZ4AKWC,"Tonya was one of the sports greatestjumpers.  When i was watching her back in the day i didn't know how special her triple axle was.  Even today, as i write this the jumps have gotten more complex and difficult. , but only one female skater in the world is attempting a triple, and only a handful have completed one.  For me seeing her skate again and measuring her  jumps against todays ladies, she still impresses by the sheer height she obtains.  She belongs in the collection of what i call the powerhouse skaters.

Thats why i enjoyed this program so much it showed a good deal of tonyas skating.",1392163200,4,601,4.467889908256881
6243863,5,B00HZ4AKWC,"This was a dramatic piece of sports history that had faded from my memory but it is a story worth watching.  The real life characters and the well constructed story line held my interest even though I ""knew the ending.""  The film does a good job showing several angles of this rivalry.  The extremes these individuals will go to to achieve their dreams is epic and criminal.",1392163200,3,374,4.552238805970149

All of us in my 7th grade class were Team Nancy at the time but I never knew about Tonya's life at all. She was so talented yet with that mom of hers and her background, the broad never had a chance. This is a great companion to I, TONYA which I also loved. Very insightful and entertaining especially if you remember this when it happened. Class prejudice in the USA is very much alive... and come on, she knew.",1532217600,,579,4.178571428571429

8637414,5,B00HZ4AKWC,"Demonstrates the promise and potential of the 30 for 30 series and begins to make up for ESPN's inexplicably cancelling and never releasing SportsCentury for digital distribution. Tonya grants a full narrative with opinions and commentaries that clearly gauge her perceptions of fairness and capacity for personal accountability and truthfulness. Coupled with the recollections of investigators and a significant number of coaching and skating colleagues I think a viewer can reasonably infer whether or not Tonya was involved. A vivid recounting of events, doubly enjoyable for those of us old enough to remember it.",1530576000,,617,5.574468085106383

I learned long ago you can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear and that's exactly what Tonya is. Tonya paled beside the other contestants, esp. Nancy Kerrigan. What can you say about Tonya - overweight, gaudy, foul-mouthed trailer trash. I'm embarrassed to admit she was on the American team. I see today that she hasn't changed one bit. Kerrigan, on the other hand, was always beautiful, graceful on the ice and the perfect representative for team U.S.A. Yes, I said it. Being beautiful & graceful is what it's all about. Who cares about Tonya's triple axle? They should have called her The Cow On Ice.",1527984000,,699,4.6

8637420,5,B00HZ4AKWC,I feel very bad for Tonya Harding. She married an abusive man whose stupidity was surpassed only by that of his friends. For her to have achieved what she did facing the hardships she faced and have her life ripped away from her by the stupidity of a man who didn't have faith in her incredible talent is tragic. Not being allowed to skate professionally is far too punitive. I wonder if they would have been so harsh if she had lived up to their Barbie-doll ice-princess image of what a woman should be.,1525478400,,504,4.372340425531915
