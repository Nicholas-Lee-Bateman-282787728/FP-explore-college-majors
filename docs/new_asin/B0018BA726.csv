Not cheesy, but not big budget special effects, either.  Another notch in my vampire belt.  Bonus is some nudity and a love story backdrop,  Minus is the timeline for everything happening is non-existant.

It is somewhat euro trashy pseudo-intellectual but should either really commit to that or have more action. Still, you gotta love those nude vampire babes in blowing diaphanous veils posed in nighttime tableaux by a ruined castle.

Despite this, it's a charming French vampire tale in the fine tradition set down by Hammer Films in the 60's.  If you appreciate story over gore, this is a fine little flic.  Fans of the genre will recognize the blackened fence posts at the end of the movie from other Hammer vamp movies.

It's locked solidly into the style of the genre. The acting is oppressive, the special effects consist mainly of blood capsules, and the plot is a contrivance to hang the nudity on.

3414624,2,B0018BA726,i am a fan of vampire films but would not have missed anything had I skipped this one. The scenery was nice because they filmed in locations that were real and held a natural appeal ... castle ruins and ocean cliffs. It was a slow paced movie so fast forward did not hurt following the plot as it unfolded; It is not a gory bloody attempt to shock viewers and I prefer that style.

3414626,5,B0018BA726,"LIPS OF BLOOD opens w/ two men carrying a body into the crypt of a castle. The scene switches to a party, where a man becomes obsessed w/ a picture of a crumbling castle. The picture triggers memories of a beautiful woman from the man's childhood, driving him to track down the ruins. Of course, this is a Jean Rollin film, so the man encounters two stunning, naked women at the very beginning of his quest. Soon after, he begins seeing the woman from his childhood (she hasn't aged a bit), and follows her into a cemetery. Is she real? A ghost? He discovers a secret passage in a vault, and enters into the crypt from the movie's beginning! This is when things start getting weird! Coffins open, revealing giant bats (flying foxes), and a gaggle of blazing-hot vampire babes! A man is attacked in the cemetery and relieved of his blood. Meanwhile, our hero is led into the dark streets by a woman in face-paint. Need I say more? As w/ most Rollin films, by this point, you're either in or out. The rest is a surreal adventure of vampirism, a terrible family secret, and undying love. We are taken to the aquarium, then into the subway system, and into the fountains, as the man seeks answers, and is chased by a mysterious hit-man. The man's mum is convinced that he's insane, and has him taken to a mental institution. Will he ever find what he's looking for?

3414633,3,B0018BA726,"Jean Rollin is a name instantly recognizable to hardcore horror fans, yet meaningless to nearly everyone else. This ignorance is quite unfortunate because the French director concocted some of the sleaziest, most unusual films ever made during the 1970s and 1980s, films usually imbued with a disturbing mix of hypereroticism and bloody violence. I have often tossed Rollin's name around in impolite company with seeming aplomb even though I had never seen even one of the man's films. You read enough plot synopses about someone and you start to feel as though you know every intimate detail about their work. What I did hear from others about this director oftentimes did not bode well. He is apparently well versed in schlock filmmaking, which in and of itself is not a problem with me, a true lover of bad cinema, but several of his films continue to draw raves from a selected minority of genre fans. Well, I finally sat down with a Jean Rollin film, his 1979 effort ""Fascination,"" and was pleasantly surprised with the results. As I viewed the film with a growing sense of intrigue, I began mentally composing a list of other films from this director that I should watch in the near future. After watching the phenomenal ""Living Dead Girl,"" I finally stumbled over one of the man's lesser efforts.
""Lips of Blood"" introduces us to Frederic, an urbane French guy who looks a lot like a young Richard Wright from Pink Floyd. At a party overflowing with Eurotrash, a small poster depicting a heap of ruins out in the countryside happens to catch his attention. As he stares at the picture, he flashes back to an unusual experience he had at the age of twelve. One night he wandered to the gates of this castle whereupon he encountered an attractive French girl with a Joan of Arc haircut named Jennifer. The two shared a platonic doze but somehow fell in love. After Frederic left the castle, he never saw either the building or the girl again. He forgot all about her until the poster reminded him of that halcyon evening long ago. He immediately confronts his mother, who is also at the party, about the event. She acts strangely about what he says but denies any knowledge of it. Enraged, Frederic begins a quest to discover if what he remembers really happened or if it is all a dream. Sure enough, he begins seeing an apparition of this girl, an apparition that appears and disappears at random. Frederic tries to pry information about the location of the castle from the photographer of the picture in the poster, but to no avail. Will he ever find what he's looking for?
Yes, he does find the place much to the chagrin of his mother and others. It turns out that the whole thing deals with a bunch of nubile vampires locked away for eternity, some in Paris and another one at that castle. Frederic inadvertently lets a few of them out, at which point they begin preying on the inhabitants of Paris. These vampires are not your normal, everyday draped in black pasty-faced blood drinkers. Oh no, these female Dracula types wonder about in diaphanous gowns charming the male population with their wares prior to delivering the fanged coup de grace. Moreover, the girl Frederic remembers plays a greater role in the larger group of vampires. The conclusion to the film constitutes the cheesiest vampire hunt I have ever witnessed. Imagine a bunch of shaggy French guys walking around after female vampires as they clutch stakes. Walking! Not running, not slinking, but walking! The vampires, for their part, are the wimpiest vampires in film history. Instead of exploding into a murderous rage, or at least turning into bats, they shriek with terror when they see these guys carrying stakes and run away. Harrumph, I say! There's a surprise after these scenes that I won't spoil for you except to say it's a bit silly. But silly is this film's middle name.
""Lips of Blood"" is a cheap and cheesy piece of enjoyable schlock. If you must absolutely see it no matter what the cost, prepare to be underwhelmed. Most of the film consists of these long, pointless tracking shots of urban slums or the countryside. Rollin films his characters walking or running for what feels like hours. By the way, what's up with Paris? I thought people called this place ""The City of Lights."" Not in ""Lips of Blood,"" where nearly every cityscape lies clothed in darkness. Maybe the French power workers were on strike the week Rollin made his film. At least the picture quality is good enough to discern what's going on in the dark. And speaking of picture quality, ""Lips of Blood"" definitely has that distinct Rollin look and feel. It is the sparse atmosphere of this movie, along with the French women, that ultimately turned my frown upside down. Yep, I liked the movie well enough even though almost nothing interesting happened. Whether you like it or not will depend on your tolerance level for slower pacing, cheap set pieces, and ridiculous acting.
Redemption's DVD contains the usual racy introductory footage, a Rollin filmography, and nothing more which is surprising considering the ""Fascination"" and ""Living Dead Girl"" discs had stills and trailers. In French the film's title is ""Levres de Sang,"" and while there is a bit of the red stuff on a few pairs of lips, there's not much else to see. Rollin fans will want the disc, but the uninitiated should probably check out ""Fascination"" and ""Living Dead Girl"" first to see if this filmmaker is their cup of tea.",1087257600,,5459,4.7534246575342465
3414634,3,B0018BA726,"If it's fangs and lots of blood-drinking, this is not your film. Most of the vampirism is very understated... the vampire stalks a prey and turns back to camera to feed; that sort of thing. Be warned: the cover art is not taken from the film.
Levres de Sang/Lips of Blood...
A man recalls an experience as a boy at a castle when he meets a hauntingly beautiful woman. Somehow he's only reminded of this upon seeing a postcard of the castle. He then seeks to track it down, called on by visions of her. His mother tries to stop him, but he eventually is reunited with his pale ageless love.

8269177,4,B0018BA726,"""Lips of Blood"" (original French title Levres de Sang) is a surreal and artsy 1975 vampire film by Jean Rollin. I'm new to Rollin's films so I can't comment on how this compares to the director's other films. On its own, there are some merits to this slow-moving story of a man's search for the elusive young woman of his boyhood. Frdric's memory is triggered one evening after seeing a photo of the ruins of an old chateau along the sea. The photo makes him recall meeting a young woman dressed in white back when he was a young boy and this in turn sends him off on a search for the woman in question. The girl, Jessica, is trapped and it is only by remembering her that he is able to see her, although initially, she appears only as a silent vision before him.

The story of Jennifer is slowly unveiled as the film progresses. At heart, this is a love story of sorts - of two souls meant to be together over a bond formed decades ago, and I chose to focus on this rather than all the other strange things that to me, served only to clutter the film and detract from the actual focus. Female nudity abounds but is done in an artistic and tasteful manner. Overall, this film is a slow-paced atmospheric and erotic vampire film and is worth a watch for those who favor art and atmosphere over gore and violence.",1438819200,,1311,4.3076923076923075
