8404133,5,B003SAUX2E,"While this film is a visual hodgepodge (some might call it a tapestry) of scenes from various mine worker's strikes and struggles, it manages to make the point very well that the history of coal in America is bathed in blood.  It portends to be about the 1988 Pittston strike (and it is, in a way) it really is much more.  It is an incredible collection of documentary, docudrama and music telling the story of John L Lewis, violence against miners, told against the backdrop of the Pittston strike which coincidentally took on the tactic of non-violent and creative confrontation that eventually led to federal mediation and a settlement after about 18 months of strike.  Anyone collecting mining history or labor history films should own this film.",1365379200,,750,4.889763779527559
