4596997,1,B0057LQNGC,"I LOVE Breaking Bad, but this seller is trying to sell seasons 1-3 together, and at an inflated cost - compared to buying each season separately. Thank goodness I saw another reviewer who pointed out this fact.  Breaking Bad is an amazing TV series.  Just be careful that you don't make a mistake and spend extra money - save it and then spend it on season 4 when it is released.",1329609600,5,379,4.323943661971831
4596998,5,B0057LQNGC,"I had heard others talking about how much they loved this series. I was gripped from the first episode.  It was just so funny and heartbreaking. It was hard not to view Bryan Cranston as ""Hal"" to start, but he was briliant as Walter.  Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston will have you hooked on this series. I am anxious for season 4.  This has become one of my all time favorite TV series.",1324857600,6,384,4.232876712328767
4596999,1,B0057LQNGC,"This review has absolutely nothing to do with the show itself, as I'm completely obsessed and love it.  I'm actually coming here to buy all of the seasons for my brother for Christmas to get him hooked too. I'm confused -- why does it cost roughly $90 to purchase all 3 seasons together, but if you buy each season individually, it comes to about half the price (about $45 for you math whizzes). Am I missing something?  Um, I think I'm cool with buying them separately and saving $45. Besides, I can wrap them separately and make it look like I got him 3 presents instead of 1.",1322956800,29,578,4.342592592592593
4597000,5,B0057LQNGC,"I had heard of this award winning series from a friend, and seen is on TV guide listings. Never watched it due to interest in other shows that aired at the same time as this one. Decided to purchase the first 3 seasons from Amazon, and am extremely happy I did. I'm a fan of good ensemble acting, and this certainly has it in abundance. I can't wait to purchase season 4, and will as soon as it comes out. I highly reccommend this to anyong who liked serials, and strong plot lines.",1320451200,4,482,4.193548387096774
4597001,3,B0057LQNGC,"We are late comers to this series, and have been caught up in the latest escapades.  So it was with great expectations we ordered the first three series, unfortunately disc one didn't play properly, so had to return it, hence only three stars.  Seller was excellent and gave a full refund.  The experience wouldn't put me off using them again or recommending them.",1318550400,2,364,4.746031746031746
8460865,1,B0057LQNGC,"This is one of the great shows ever made.  But this set still costs far more than the seasons bought individually.  In fact, as of today you can buy the COMPLETE SERIES on DVD for LESS than what these 3 seasons are listed for as a bundle.",1418256000,,238,4.042553191489362
8460866,5,B0057LQNGC,Was better than the first season which was great.  Highly recommend it.  Thanks!,1411344000,,80,5.076923076923077

8460870,5,B0057LQNGC,Seasons 1 thru 4 are on Netflix.  Why mess with the DVD's when you can watch them HD from netflix?,1365379200,,98,3.9
8460871,5,B0057LQNGC,DOUBLY AWESOME.. Show is creative and some great character development. Definitely worth watching this show and there is shock factor in a few episodes,1356048000,,151,5.333333333333333
8460872,1,B0057LQNGC,"Be warned, this listing is meant to rip you off.  Buy them separately and save some money.  Greed drives too many people these days, LAME!",1348531200,2,138,4.48
8460873,1,B0057LQNGC,"Breaking Bad itself is an excellent show and I'd easily rate it 5 stars. The 1 star isn't for the show itself, but the ridiculous selling price, which other reviews have pointed out. If you were to buy these three seasons seperately on Amazon, it'd come up to about $45 instead of the $90 that this seller is charging. This is a ripoff, pure and simple. Pass on this unless you just like throwing away money.",1343433600,,408,4.381578947368421
8460874,5,B0057LQNGC,Making meth seems more complicated after watching this show.  I don't understand how so many trashy rednecks are pulling it off.,1339372800,,128,5.095238095238095
