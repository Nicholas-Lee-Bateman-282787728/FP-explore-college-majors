8217005,1,B000V78NTM,"The Cimmaron Strip TV series back in the 1960's with Stuart Whitman I enjoyed very much. When I saw it available on Amazon I ordered 2 episodes. ""The Search"" and ""Knife in the Darkness.""  The first was fine. But, this particular episode was blank. I mean there was absolutely nothing recorded on it, proved by various DVD players and computers. This experience has caused me not to order anymore Cimmaron Strips. So, beware. It could be like throwing dice, not knowing what you are going to get. I tried communicating with the Cimmaron Strip website but there is no e-mail / phone #, nor mailing address to communicate with these people.",1275350400,,637,4.738738738738738
8217006,5,B000V78NTM,"This is one of the best episodes of Cimarron Strip...which the entire collection is wonderful.  Best western series of its time, cut short way too soon.  Stuart Whitman is excellent, along with the supporting case and special guests.  They just don't have this type of quality on tv today.",1219017600,,289,4.857142857142857
8217007,5,B000V78NTM,"This is one of the best episodes of ""Cimarron Strip."" Bernard Herrmann's score is outstanding. His unnerving score combined with Harlan Ellison's script make this one of the most unsettling episodes of the Western genre. Tom Skerritt is excellent in this creepy episode as he is convinced he has tracked Jack The Ripper from London to Cimarron.",1196121600,,344,5.052631578947368
